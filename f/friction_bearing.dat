50|$|On April 24, 1918, {{during the}} height of the Finnish Civil War, there was an attempt to {{sabotage}} the bridge. An explosive charge was placed under the <b>friction</b> <b>bearing</b> at the north end of the bridge and detonated. The explosion caused some damage to the span, causing it to warp. The bridge was temporarily repaired, but complete repairs had to wait to be done until 1928.|$|E
50|$|The smaller nanotube(s) are {{fabricated}} {{using the}} Electrical driven vaporization (EDV) {{which is a}} variant of the electrical-breakdown technique. Passing current between the two electrodes typically results in failure of the outermost shell only {{on one side of the}} nanotube. Current is therefore passed between one electrode and the center of the MWNT which results in the failure of the outermost shell between this electrode and the center. The process is repeated on the opposite side to result in the formation of the short concentric nanotube that behaves like a low <b>friction</b> <b>bearing</b> along the longer tube.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} a theoretical approach and experimental analysis of <b>bearing</b> boxes <b>friction</b> from a parallel axes transmission. The bearings are {{components of a}} testing rig for determining friction losses in chain drives. Friction in chain is calculated by subtracting the <b>bearing</b> <b>friction</b> from the global (chain and <b>bearings)</b> <b>friction.</b> It is of maximal importance in the correct evaluation of results, to have accurate data on the <b>friction</b> in <b>bearings.</b> Theoretical estimation of <b>bearing</b> <b>friction</b> is performed {{in order to establish}} the parameters involved and as an over check of the measured friction. By using a special device, <b>bearing</b> <b>friction</b> measurements are made on the same rig, with the same running conditions and same measurement systems...|$|R
25|$|Many {{thermoplastic}} {{materials such as}} nylon, HDPE and PTFE are commonly used in low <b>friction</b> <b>bearings.</b> They are especially useful because the coefficient of friction falls with increasing imposed load. For improved wear resistance, very high molecular weight grades are usually specified for heavy duty or critical bearings.|$|R
50|$|The motor {{consists}} of a four-, five-, six- or eight-sided rotor block {{in the middle of}} a shaft. The rotor block has two sets of windings and a solar cell attached to each side. The shaft is positioned horizontally and has a magnet at each end. The magnets on the shaft provide levitation by repelling magnets in a base under the motor. This air <b>friction</b> <b>bearing</b> is required because a mendocino motor uses Lorentz force without iron core. There is an additional magnet that sits under the rotor block and provides a magnetic field for the rotor. Other motors hide the base magnet in a tube.|$|E
50|$|The {{silicon content}} {{leads to a}} {{strengthening}} of the metal matrix. The appearance is similar to ordinary brass. Silicon tombac has good <b>friction</b> <b>bearing</b> characteristics and is corrosion resistant but is not resistant to ammonia atmosphere. The strength properties are largely retained at application temperatures up to 200 °C.It is a special alloy {{in terms of the}} combination of casting process and casting temperature. In most cases, parts made of silicon tombac, are produced through the high pressure die casting process, which is normally specialized on metals with relatively low melting temperatures. But in this case the temperature melting range of silicon tombac is in the area of 950 to 1000 °C, which is relatively high for casting into permanent moulds. The advantage is the productivity of this highly automated casting process. The disadvantage is the temperature stress of the surface of the permanent mould, so that the lifetime of these moulds is limited.|$|E
5000|$|Rack slides are {{specifically}} intended for mounting equipment into 19-inch racks or 23-inch racks. These can be <b>friction</b> <b>bearing,</b> ball bearing, or roller bearing. They are sized {{to fit into}} racks with mounting flanges on the ends to mate to the mounting holes in racks. In some cases, one mounting flange is formed into the rack slide with an adapter bracket attached {{to the other end}} to accommodate different depths of the rack. The outer fixed member is attached to the rack and the inner moving member is generally screwed {{to the side of the}} mounted equipment. Rack slides are typically compound or 3-part slides allowing full extension of the mounted equipment and generally include provision for sliding the inner member completely free to allow removal of the equipment from the rack. They can also include stops to prevent accidentally pulling the equipment out of the rack without releasing the stop mechanism.|$|E

5000|$|Marks {{ending with}} the letter [...] "X" [...] are {{assigned}} to companies or individuals who own railcars, but are not operating railroads; for example, the TTX Company (formerly Trailer Train Company) is named for its original reporting mark of TTX. In another example, the reporting mark for state-funded Amtrak services in California is CDTX (whereas the usual Amtrak mark is AMTK) because the state transportation agency (Caltrans) owns the equipment used in these services. This may also apply to commuter rail, for example Metrolink in Southern California uses the reporting mark SCAX because the equipment {{is owned by the}} Southern California Regional Rail Authority—which owns the Metrolink system—even though it is operated by Amtrak. This is why the reporting mark for CSX Transportation, which is an operating railroad, is CSXT instead of CSX. Private (non-common carrier) freight car owners in Mexico were issued, up until around 1990, reporting marks ending in two X's, possibly to signify that their cars followed different regulations (such as bans on <b>friction</b> <b>bearing</b> trucks) than their American counterparts and so their viability for interchange service was impaired. This often resulted in five-letter reporting marks, an option not otherwise allowed by the AAR.|$|E

Hoarseness of voice occurs very early in life and airway obstruction may occur. Characteristic skin lesions include multiple brown atrophic scars over face and distal extremities, beaded papules over {{the margins of the}} eyelids and verrucous nodules over the <b>friction</b> <b>bearing</b> areas (elbows, knees).

40|$|Starting from {{a typical}} bridge from the {{inventory}} of FHWA concept designs, comparative analyses are conducted to evaluate the influence of <b>friction</b> <b>bearing</b> models on the dynamic characteristics and predicted seismic response of multi-span bridges. Refined 3 -dimensional idealizations of the selected nine-span bridge were assembled for assessment using two analysis platforms. Comprehensive {{analyses were conducted to}} estimate the dynamic characteristics and demands of the bridge components in the longitudinal and transverse directions. Contrary to the design assumption, it is concluded that the behavior is significantly and fundamentally affected by taking account of friction at bearings, especially with regard to forces. The study confirms that neglecting friction in design is non-conservative and may compromise safety of the structure...|$|E
50|$|Fluid {{bearings}} {{generally have}} very low friction—far better than mechanical bearings. One source of friction in a fluid bearing is the viscosity of the fluid. Hydrostatic gas bearings {{are among the}} lowest <b>friction</b> <b>bearings.</b> However, lower fluid viscosity also typically means fluid leaks faster from the bearing surfaces, thus requiring increased power for pumps or friction from seals.|$|R

The gearing losses associated with high speed gearing such as tooth mesh <b>friction,</b> <b>bearing</b> friction, churning, and windage are discussed with various ways shown to help reduce these losses and thereby improve efficiency. Several different methods of oil jet lubrication for high speed gearing are given such as into mesh, out of mesh, and radial jet lubrication. The experiments and analytical results for the various methods of oil jet lubrication are shown with {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of each method discussed. The analytical and experimental results of gear lubrication and cooling at various test conditions are presented.

30|$|Apple and pear (Malus domestica and Pyrus communis) are anatomically hard to distinguish, {{therefore}} they are discussed together. The wood {{of those two}} species is still appreciated for furniture making and veneer production. Nevertheless, the wood could be challenged much more. In former times apple and pear were often utilized because of their combination of high resistance against abrasion, hardness, strength and comparable low sliding friction (Fig.  5). It was used for planes, spindles, cogwheels, shafts, axis and rolls. There are also other parameters like lubricity, {{which is one of}} the properties difficult to measure. They can be evaluated by analyzing historical objects representing the result of a long-term empirical process. Pear and apple were conspicuously often used for <b>friction</b> <b>bearing</b> where the named property is of great importance. Folkloristic literature mentions rolls for prayers beads [19], pounders [20], plows [21], oil presses [22] and windmills [21].|$|E

50|$|Air {{bearings}} operate contact-free and {{so without}} abrasion. The only friction results from airflow {{air in the}} gap. Thus, the durability of air bearings is unlimited if they are designed and calculated correctly. Especially roller and <b>friction</b> <b>bearings</b> face a high friction when applied at high speed or acceleration or small strokes, causing high abrasion such that the precision decreases which in turn causes a breakdown.|$|R

40|$|The {{service life}} of a <b>friction</b> <b>bearing</b> which is {{subjected}} to transient stresses is often limited by the fatigue strength of the bearing material. Within {{the framework of a}} joint project on 'multilayer friction bearings subjected to dynamic stresses' the influence of the grain size on the dynamic load-bearing capacity of two customary aluminum-and tin-based materials was quantified through flexural-type tests of bearing metal/steel compound specimens. Factors which influence the specimen strength, e. g. the surrounding medium or the ambient temperature, were considered by varying the respective parameters. The compound specimen flexural-type test results were verified by random tests of existing friction bearings. For advanced interpretation of the test results additional tests were made to assess the structural composition the cracking characteristics, the state of internaal stress, the bimetal effect, and the surface topography.

40|$|Most {{recent history}} shows that {{polytetrafluoroethylene}} (PTFE) is widely used as antifrictional materials in industry for wide speed range. A high antifriction property of PTFE makes it suitable for dry <b>friction</b> <b>bearing.</b> Main disadvantage of using PTFE is its high wear rate, so extensive research had been carried out to improve the wear resistance with addition of filler material. This study focuses on four input parameters load, sliding speed, sliding distance, and percentage of glass fiber as a filler material. Taguchi method was used for experimentation; each parameter is having 3 levels with L 27 orthogonal array. Grey relational analysis is used to convert multiple response parameters, namely, wear and coefficient of friction, into single grey relation grade. The optimal input parameters were selected based on the S/N ratio. It was observed that load 3 [*]kg, sliding speed 5. 1836 [*]m/s (900 [*]rpm), sliding distance 2 [*]km, and 15 % of glass fiber are optimal input parameters for PTFE without significantly affecting the wear rate and coefficient of friction...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{analyzed}} a joint created {{for a medical}} walker currently in the prototyping stage of development. The walker {{is designed to help}} a user stand up from a seated position. The joint holds two legs of the walker together in an 'x ' shape. It must be able to lock in two positions and support the full weight of the user while he or she is getting up. We looked at four different locking mechanisms including a spring loaded pull pin, a <b>friction</b> <b>bearing,</b> a clutch, and an electronic solenoid. After weighing {{the pros and cons of}} each mechanism we recommend and present a design using the pull pin. In order to determine the strength and deflection of the loaded pin we modeled it both as a cantilevered beam, and a simply supported beam with three points of contact. We compared the hand calculations to FEA of solid models and found that modeling the pin as a simply supported beam is more accurate than the cantilever representation...|$|E

40|$|Grease {{is one of}} {{the major}} bearing {{components}} and the performance of a grease lubricated bearing is strongly determined by the performance of the grease. This paper describes how grease knowledge is linked to improved rolling bearing performance. First the various performance indicators will be described such as rolling bearing life, sealing performance, bearing <b>friction,</b> <b>bearing</b> noise and grease life. Next, the dominating grease parameters and specifications on these aspects will be given. It will also be shown how re-lubrication will enhance the bearing performance. There is synergy between grease formulation and bearing design. In the last years new generation grease lubricated bearings have been developed where grease technology was used to provide significantly lower friction and longer grease life. This was achieved by developing better greases but also by improving the internal bearing design, which could be done by using modern advancements in understanding the lubrication mechanisms. Finally, an outlook will be given on future developments in lubricating greases for rolling bearings. The various test methods are not described in this paper.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} {{increasing}} interest in the use of structured surfaces to provide specific functional performance. Such surfaces often consist of localised micro-scale surface features with predetermined geometries. The performance of the feature manufacturing process affects the functional performance of the surface, and can be assessed by measurement of the resulting surface features. Measurement of the resulting micromanufactured surface features necessitates use of areal optical surface topography instruments. However, conventional characterisation methods, based on areal surface texture parameters, often prove inadequate, and may fail to capture the relevant geometric properties needed for an effective dimensional verification. This paper investigates an alternative route to verification, based on the determination of geometric attributes of the microfabricated features. This approach allows for direct assessment of manufacturing process performance, by comparison of the geometric attributes with their nominal values. An example application is shown in which a micromachining process (laser texturing) is used to fabricate a periodic pattern of dimples, which provide a low <b>friction</b> <b>bearing</b> surface. In this paper, manufacturing process performance is assessed by characterisation of the diameter and out-of-roundness. Sources of uncertainty associated with these geometric parameters are also considered...|$|E
40|$|Ring rolling is a {{hot forming}} process used in the {{production}} of railway tyres, anti <b>friction</b> <b>bearing</b> races and different ring shaped workpieces for automotive and aerospace applications. The advantages of ring rolling process include short production time, uniform quality, closed tolerances, good material quality and considerable saving in material cost. Despite the benefits some problems still exist according to a correct selection of the process parameters. Due {{to the nature of the}} process different rolling mills (driving roll, mandrel and axial rolls) are involved and the correct selection of the process parameters is not so feasible. Moreover an experimental approach to solve this problem risks to be more expensive. Actually FE codes are available to simulate the non linear problem that characterizes a ring rolling process. In this work a FE model, based on Deform 3 D software, was tested versus experimental results acquired from an industrial plant. The accuracy of the FE model was analyzed through a dual comparison: by geometrical and by physical aspects. A good agreement was found between the experimental and the numerical results for both comparisons and, as a consequence, this code could be used in order to investigate and optimize the process parameters that characterize the ring rolling process in a virtual not expensive environment...|$|E
