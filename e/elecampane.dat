The Romans invented the trapetum for extracting olive oil. The olive orchards of Roman Africa attracted major investment and were highly productive, with trees larger than those of Mediterranean Europe; massive lever presses were developed for efficient extraction. Spain was also a major exporter of olive oil, but the Romans regarded oil from central Italy as the finest.

Using the phytochemist "screening" test a qualitative analysis of extracts has been made.

40|$|The paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} of six plants, naturalized in Estonia: butterbur (Petasites hybridus), chicory (Cichorium intubus), <b>elecampane</b> inula (Inula helenium), horseradish (Armoracia rusticana), soapwort (Saponaria officinalis) and sweet violet (Viola odorata). The approach to their naturalization is based on ethnobotanical rather than biological qualities. The first disseminators of foreign plants were merchants. The earliest cultivators may have also been monasteries, {{although it is not}} known what exactly was grown in these gardens. The most important plants cultivated in monasteries were herbs, which were planted in 4 - 12 beds, vegetables in 9 - 18 beds, whereas the rest of the garden was reserved for an orchard. The establishing of the first pharmacies in Estonian towns introduced the planting of new species in gardens for sale (the earliest pharmacy, the Tallinn Town Hall Pharmacy, dates back to 1422, with a herb garden founded in 1452). The oldest preserved list of plants growing in pharmacy garden originating from Narva pharmacy from the year 1677 contains already following herbs: chicory, <b>elecampane</b> inula, butterbur and sweet violet. Next to pharmacies, foreign species were also disseminated by grocers and drugstores. A century later, in 1777, the list of tracheophytes found in Estonia and Livonia was compiled; this list has been considered the first written source in the field of botany. In the list all the six plants were noted as natural species. The spread of the plants was speeded by their versatile usage - all these plants were used as medicines; chicory, horseradish and <b>elecampane</b> inula were also vegetable plants; <b>elecampane</b> inula, sweet violet, soapwort and butterbur were popular landscape plants; soapwort was used to clean silk and wool. Various legal acts, which have been applied to the plants, have also influenced their spread. <b>Elecampane</b> inula was listed in the first Estonian dictionary in 1660. Translated literature became an important factor in introducing herbs into broader use. Already the first journal (published in 1766 - 1767) and the earliest popular medical book (1771) in Estonian describe the use of horseradish, butterbur, <b>elecampane</b> inula and sweet violet. The plants, especially garden horseradish, are repeatedly mentioned in almanacs and books published since. The use of chicory is described only once in 1895, and soapwort once in 1870. The paper describes in more detail the formation of new ethnic names. The plant names were mostly derived from adaptations of German names (e. g. aland, pestilens-wurtsel, wiola, sigur, etc.), later from German translations (e. g. katkujuur for butterbur) and in some cases, the name of the local plant was used to mark a similar new plant (e. g. sinilill, or hepatica, for sweet violet and põierohi, or campion, for soapwort). In conclusion it has to be said that the important factors in distributing those plants were changes in landscape gardening and eating habits as well as the fact that the plants were eventually abandoned from use and thus, lost the most powerful natural enemy - the man...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the antioxidant activity and fructans content in ethanol and water extracts of roots of <b>elecampane</b> (Inula helenium L.), a Bulgarian medicinal plant. The extraction procedure included 95 % (v/v) ethanol extraction and subsequent water treatment. The antioxidant activity was evaluated by several reliable methods such as DPPH-, ABTS-, FRAP- and CUPRAC-assays, as well as the total phenolic content. In addition, the total fructans and sugar content were determinated by spectrophotomeric, TLC and HPLC-RID methods. The level of fructans in ethanol extracts was 14. 1 g / 100 g dry weight, as nystose and 1 -kestose were only 0. 3 g / 100 g dry weight, and 0. 5 g / 100 g dry weight, respectively. The absence of fructooligosacharides and sugars in water extracts after the ethanol pretreatment was established. Inulin content was evaluated to be 32 g / 100 g dry weight. The metabolites profile of roots revealed their potential application as radical scavengers due to the presence of polyphenols. Therefore, the root extracts of <b>elecampane</b> could be assumed as a rich source of biologically active substance, in particular dietary fiber with potential prebiotic effect, due to the presence of polysaccharide inulin and fructooligosacharides...|$|E

The {{shape of the}} investigated glands (five-armed star with rounded tips and deep incisions - observed from above) clearly differed from {{the shape of the}} nectaries of other Asteraceae, also the height of nectary was much lower (129 µm). The glandular tissue of the nectaries of <b>elecampane</b> was composed of a single-layered epidermis and 5 [...] 9 layers of secretory cells. Nectar was released through modified stomata, mainly arranged in the top part of the gland. The secretory cells were characterised by granular cytoplasm and the presence of a large, often lobate, cell nucleus. In the cytosol, numerous amoeboid plastids, mitochondria, Golgi bodies and ribosomes were present. In small vacuoles, myelin-like structures, fibrous material and vesicles with the content of substances which can be secretion, were observed. The plastid stroma showed different electron density and the presence of internal tubules and plastoglobules.

One route was {{the local}} manor lords and their wives, who disseminated the knowledge they had acquired both from the literature published in Germany {{as well as from}} personal experimentation. Another weighty source may have been the late 18 th-century almanacs that were published in the Estonian language and the popular medical literature, the publication of which escalated in the late 19 th century and which introduced recent news on medicine. The almanacs were the first literary sources for peasants to acquire medical wisdom from. Since their popularity, the almanacs had a profound influence on the population. This paper discusses the advices on medicines and treatment published in medical texts in the almanacs of the period. Since drugs used for treatment were not medicines in the contemporary sense of the word, the term “medicament” should be defined more generally. The most common food products used as remedies were salt, milk, and meal. A subtopic of the paper concerns various herbs, whereas a closer look is taken at herbs for home remedy and the possible usages. The most common herbs were camomile, blackcurrant and tobacco.

BMAW 5 ml was administered in 30 pts (the main group) twice a day (in the morning and in the evening) on the target knee joint. 30 pts of control group received placebo containing only components of stuff. Demographic and clinical parameters in the main and the control groups were comparable. Inclusion criteria: age from 40 to 70 years, pain intensity in the target joint at least 40 mm on VAS, I-III radiological stage according to Kellgren, Leqesne score 4 - 10, treatment with NSAIDs during the previous 3 months. Exclusion criteria: indications for intra-articular glucocorticoid injection, clinically significant disturbances of internal organs function and skin damages {{in the region of}} knee joint. Clinical efficacy was assessed by WOMAC index, pain at movement and at rest, time of 15 meters walking, general assessment of efficacy (separately by the pt and by the doctor).
