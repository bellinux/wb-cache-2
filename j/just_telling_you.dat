500|$|Asked {{about the}} {{greatest}} challenge in filming the battle, Sapochnik said: [...] "Every time we charge the horses it takes 25 minutes to reset all the fake snow {{on the field and}} rub out the horseshoe prints. So how many times can we afford to charge the horses each day knowing we need to give time for a reset that's 10 times longer than the actual shot? Another thing was how to make 500 extras look like 8,000 when you are shooting in a field where there's just nowhere to hide your shortfall. It becomes a bit like a bonkers math equation. And finally: How do you get these guys riled up enough to run at each other and get covered in mud and stand in the rain and then run at each other again and again for 25 days, 10 hours a day, without them <b>just</b> <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> to piss off?" [...] In an interview, he said that the single most difficult thing he was asked to depict was [...] "having 3,000 horses running at each other, especially after we discovered that horses cannot touch each other. It’s illegal — it’s a very valid rule about protecting the horses. So the very thing we were trying to do was not allowed. And we only had 70 horses ... you would have one guy run into the frame, and then the horse rider would pull the horse, which means make the horse fall and lie down on its side. Later we would digitally superimpose another C.G.I. horse and make it seem like it had impacted the live one." ...|$|E

6000|$|But here, as if playfully exhilarated by the naughty foaming soda, she {{regarded}} {{him with her}} head--and {{a good deal of}} her blonde hair--very much on one side, as she said, [...] "Do you know that all along o' you bein' so free with me in tellin' your affairs I kinder feel like <b>just</b> <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> mine?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No!" [...] he replied, {{trembling}} but standing {{his ground}} firmly. [...] "Every nice girl has {{a feeling of}} some sort {{for the man who}} is idiot enough to be in love with her.

6000|$|... "Now don't {{you go and}} get peeved {{after you}} and me been such good friends, Miss Golden.

But I {{can assure}} you I've never felt the depth and height or anything like the sort of Quiet Clear Conviction.... And now I'm <b>just</b> <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> these things, Miss Corner, I don't know whether it will interest you if I tell you that you're really and truly the very first love I ever had {{as well as my}} last. I've had sent over--I got it only yesterday--this lil' photograph of a miniature portrait of one of my ancestor's relations--a Corner just as you are. It's here...." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You don't see it?" [...] said Cashel. [...] "Well, I'll <b>just</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{all about}} myself, {{and then leave}} you to judge. May I sit down while I talk?" [...] He had risen {{in the course of}} his remarks on Lydia's {{scientific}} and military acquaintances.|$|R
6000|$|Now, if the {{professor}} {{had said to}} Ellie, [...] "Yes, my darling, it is a water-baby, and a very wonderful thing it is; and it shows how little I know of the wonders of nature, in spite of forty years' honest labour. I was <b>just</b> <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> {{that there could be}} no such creatures; and, behold! here is one come to confound my conceit and show me that Nature can do, and has done, beyond all that man's poor fancy can imagine. So, let us thank the Maker, and Inspirer, and Lord of Nature for all His wonderful and glorious works, and try and find out something about this one;"--I think that, if {{the professor}} had said that, little Ellie would have believed him more firmly, and respected him more deeply, and loved him better, than ever she had done before. But he was of a different opinion. He hesitated a moment. He longed to keep Tom, and yet he half wished he never had caught him; and at last he quite longed to get rid of him. So he turned away and poked Tom with his finger, for want of anything better to do; and said carelessly, [...] "My dear little maid, you must have dreamt of water-babies last night, your head is so full of them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Satisfied! Was I not <b>just</b> <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> I despised it? But, then, to {{come back}} to this point,--we were on this liberation business. I don't think my {{feelings}} about slavery are peculiar. I find many men who, in their hearts, think of it just as I do. The land groans under it; and, bad as it is for the slave, it is worse, if anything, for the master. It takes no spectacles to see that a great class of vicious, improvident, degraded people, among us, are an evil to us, as well as to themselves. The capitalist and aristocrat of England cannot feel that as we do, because they do not mingle with the class they degrade as we do. They are in our homes; they are the associates of our children, and they form their minds faster than we can; for they are a race that children always will cling to and assimilate with. If Eva, now, was not more angel than ordinary, she would be ruined. We might as well allow the small-pox to run among them, and think our children would not take it, as to let them be uninstructed and vicious, and think our children will not be affected by that. Yet our laws positively and utterly forbid any efficient general educational system, and they do it wisely, too; for, just begin and thoroughly educate one generation, and the whole thing would be blown sky high. If we did not give them liberty, they would take it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Rev. Leonidas W. H'm, Reverend Le--well, {{there was}} a feller here, once {{by the name of}} Jim Smiley, in the winter of '49--or maybe it was the spring of '50--I don't {{recollect}} exactly, somehow, though what makes me think it was one or the other is because I remember the big flume warn't finished when he first come to the camp; but anyway, he was the curiousest man about always betting on anything that turned up you ever see, if he could get anybody to bet on the other side; and if he couldn't he'd change sides. Any way that suited the other man would suit HIM--any way just so's he got a bet, he was satisfied. But still he was lucky, uncommon lucky; he most always come out winner. He was always ready and laying for a chance; there couldn't be no solit'ry thing mentioned but that feller'd offer to bet on it, and take ary side you please, as I was <b>just</b> <b>telling</b> <b>you.</b> If {{there was a}} horse-race, you'd find him flush or you'd find him busted at the end of it; if there was a dog-fight, he'd bet on it; if there was a cat-fight, he'd bet on it; if there was a chicken-fight, he'd bet on it; why, if there was two birds setting on a fence, he would bet you which one would fly first; or if there was a camp-meeting, he would be there reg'lar to bet on Parson Walker, which he judged to be the best exhorter about here, and so he was too, and a good man. If he even see a straddle-bug start to go anywheres, he would bet you {{how long it would take}} him to get to--to wherever he was going to, and if you took him up, he would foller that straddle-bug to Mexico but what he would find out where he was bound for and how long he was on the road. Lots of the boys here has seen that Smiley, and can tell you about him. Why, it never made no difference to him--he'd bet on any thing--the dangdest feller. Parson Walker's wife laid very sick once, for a good while, and it seemed as if they warn't going to save her; but one morning he come in, and Smiley up and asked him how she was, and he said she was considerable better--thank the Lord for his inf'nite mercy--and coming on so smart that with the blessing of Prov'dence she'd get well yet; and Smiley, before he thought, says, 'Well, I'll resk two-and-a-half she don't anyway.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Better!" [...] {{said the}} good woman, [...] "I'll <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what it is, Miss Patsey, I've been a {{thinking}} over the matter {{a deal for}} the last week, and I've been a-trying my appetite, and a-trying my eyes, and a-trying how I could walk about, and work, and sew, and I <b>just</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what it is, Miss Patsey, I'm well!" ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{know what}} answer will be ready, {{in some of}} your minds at least, to all this. You {{will be ready to}} reply, almost angrily, [...] "Of course if {{everyone}} was perfect, we should need no laws: but people are not perfect, and you cannot expect them to be." [...] My friends, whether or not WE expect baptized people, living in a Christian country, to be perfect, God expects them to be perfect; for He has said, by the mouth of His Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, [...] "Be ye therefore perfect, as our Father which is in heaven is perfect." [...] And He has told us what being perfect is like; you may read it for yourselves in His sermon on the Mount; and you may see also that what He commands us to do in that sermon, from the beginning to the end, is the exact opposite and contrary of the ways and rules of this world, which, as I have shown, make burdensome laws necessary to prevent our devouring each other. Now, do you think that God would have told us to be perfect, if He knew that it was impossible for us? Do you think that He, the God of truth, would have spoken such a cruel mockery against poor sinful creatures like us, as to command us a duty without giving us the means of fulfilling it? Do you think that He did not know ten thousand times better than I what I have been <b>just</b> <b>telling</b> <b>you,</b> that laws could not change men's hearts and wills; that commanding a man to love and like a thing will not make him love and like it; that a man's heart and spirit must be changed in him from within, and not merely laws and commandments laid on him from without? Then why has He commanded us to love each other, ay, to love our enemies, to bless those who curse us, to pray for those who use us spitefully? Do you think the Lord meant to make hypocrites of us; to tell us to go about, as some who call themselves religious do go about, with their lips full of meek, and humble, and simple, and loving words, while their hearts are full of pride, and spite, and cunning, and hate, and selfishness, which are all the more deadly for being kept in and plastered over by a smooth outside? God forbid! He tells us to love each other, only because He has promised us the spirit of love. He tells us to be humble, because He can make us humble-hearted. He tells us to be honest, because He can make us love and delight in honesty. He tells us to refrain ourselves from foul thoughts as well as from foul actions, because He can take the foul heart out of us, and give us instead the spirit of purity and holiness. He tells us to lead new lives after the new pattern of Himself, because He can give us new hearts and a new spring of life within us; in short, He bids us behave as sons of God should behave, because, as He said Himself, [...] "If we, being evil, know how to give our children what is good for them, much more will our heavenly Father give His Holy Spirit to those who ask him." [...] If you would be perfect, ask your Father in heaven to make you perfect. If you feel that your heart is wrong, ask Him to give you a new and a right heart. If you feel yourselves--as you are, whether you feel it or not--too weak, too ignorant, too selfish, to guide yourselves, ask Him to send His Spirit to guide you; ask for the Spirit from which comes all love, all light, all wisdom, all strength of mind. Ask for that Spirit, and you SHALL receive it; seek for it, and you shall find it; knock at the gate of your Father's treasure-house, and it shall be surely opened to you.|$|E
