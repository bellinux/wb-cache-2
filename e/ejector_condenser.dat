40|$|Failures at {{degumming}} and {{bleaching process}} in palm oil refining affect plant performance, production delay, and {{loss to the}} company. In current practice, troubleshooting in these process relies on human knowledge and {{trial and error method}} which can caused other failures and time consuming. In this study, fuzzy logic model was developed for troubleshooting degumming and bleaching process using Mamdani approached. Operating conditions at bleacher vessel, <b>ejector,</b> <b>condenser,</b> hotwell and cooling tower system were selected as input and output variables in the fuzzy logic model development. Qualitative and numerical data were collected in this study by interviewing plant workers, observing distributed control system (DCS), reviewing standard operating procedure (SOP), operation checklist and plant manuals. The relationship between input and output variables were described by fuzzy membership function and fuzzy rules. Centre of gravity method (COG) method was used for defuzzification. The proposed model was tested with real plant data and the model was shown successfully perform troubleshooting task and suggest necessary action. Therefore, this model has the potential to employed by operator and inexperience workers in palm oil industry...|$|E

30|$|Single flash {{power plants}} are {{classified}} {{according to their}} steam turbines types, i.e., the turbine exit conditions. Two such basic types are the single flash with a condensation system and the single flash back pressure system. In the first type, a condenser operating at very low pressure is used to condensate the steam leaving the steam turbine. The condenser should operate at low vacuum pressure to maintain a large enthalpy difference across the expansion process of the steam turbine, hence resulting in a higher power output. The geothermal fluid usually contains non-condensable gases which are collected at the condenser. Such a collection of gases may raise the condenser pressure, therefore the gases should {{be removed from the}} condenser. This can be achieved by installing vacuum pumps, compressors, or steam <b>ejectors.</b> The <b>condenser</b> heat removal is done either by using a cooling tower or through cold air circulation in the condenser.|$|R
40|$|<b>Condensing</b> <b>ejectors</b> {{utilize the}} {{beneficial}} thermodynamics of condensation {{to produce an}} exiting static pressure that can be in excess of either entering static pressure. The phase change process is driven by both turbulent mixing and interphase heat transfer. Semi-empirical models {{can be used in}} conjunction with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to gain some understanding of how <b>condensing</b> <b>ejectors</b> should be designed and operated. The current work describes the construction of a multidimensional simulation capability built around an Eulerian pseudo-fluid approach. The transport equations for mass and momentum treat the two phases as a continuous mixture. The fluid is treated as being in a non-thermodynamic equilibrium state, and a modified form of the homogenous relaxation model (HRM) is employed. This model was originally intended for representing flash-boiling, but with suitable modification, the same ideas could be used for condensing flow. The computational fluid dynamics code is constructed using the open-source OpenFOAM library. Fluid properties are evaluated using the REFPROP database from NIST, which includes many common fluids and refrigerants. The working fluids used are water and carbon dioxide. For ejector flow, simulations using carbon dioxide are more stable than with water. Using carbon dioxide as the working fluid, the results of the validation simulations show a pressure rise that is comparable to experimental data. It is also observed that the flow is near thermodynamic equilibrium in the diffuser for these cases, suggesting that turbulence effects present the greatest challenge in modeling these ejectors...|$|R
