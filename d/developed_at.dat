5|$|Hurricane Karl was a late-season {{and unusual}} {{tropical}} cyclone that formed during the 1980 Atlantic hurricane season. A minimal Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale, Karl <b>developed</b> <b>at</b> {{the center of}} another, larger extratropical cyclone over the North Atlantic. After being classified a subtropical cyclone on November 25, it became more independent of its parent storm and grew into a full-fledged hurricane. It peaked in intensity on November 26, and ultimately dissipated as it merged with another system.|$|E
