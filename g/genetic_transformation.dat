5|$|From {{her medical}} findings, Scully discovers that an alien virus {{is keeping the}} abductees alive long enough to cause a radical {{transformation}} to take place, {{similar to the one}} that Miles experienced. After Scully tells Doggett about the <b>genetic</b> <b>transformation,</b> he visits Absalom, who believes that the abductees are being resurrected into aliens who will eventually conquer Earth. Skinner—torn by his decision—decides to euthanize Mulder by pulling him off of life-support so that Krycek does not get his way. Doggett, however, catches Skinner attempting to remove the support. Skinner explains Krycek's demands, but Doggett argues that both options are unreasonable because either Scully's child will die, or Mulder will succumb to the virus. Doggett tries to locate Krycek {{in the parking lot of}} the FBI building, but Krycek nearly runs him down with a car, and purposely smashes the vaccine on the ground. Doggett tries to stop him but he escapes. Dejected, Doggett returns to the hospital and tells Skinner he was right not to trust Krycek. He finds Scully preparing Mulder for the now-destroyed vaccine; She tells Doggett that keeping Mulder on life-support was incubating the virus and hastening it along, and that Skinner effectively saved Mulder's life by pulling him off life-support, as it made his temperature drop rapidly without affecting his vital signs. She states that she will be able to use a combination of antiviral drugs to kill the alien virus if they can get him and his temperature to stabilize.|$|E

25|$|A peptide {{pheromone}} quorum sensing {{signaling system}} in S. mutans includes the Competence Stimulating Peptide (CSP) that controls genetic competence. Genetic competence {{is the ability}} of a cell to take up DNA released by another cell. Competence can lead to <b>genetic</b> <b>transformation,</b> a form of sexual interaction, favored under conditions of high cell density and/or stress where there is maximal opportunity for interaction between the competent cell and the DNA released from nearby donor cells. This system is optimally expressed when S. mutans cells reside in an actively growing biofilm. Biofilm grown S. mutans cells are genetically transformed at a rate 10- to 600-fold higher than S. mutans growing as free-floating planktonic cells suspended in liquid.|$|E

In recent years, a new methodology of <b>genetic</b> <b>transformations</b> has been extensively used in sugar beet breeding. The new methodology is used with the intention of introducing desirable genes, those that cannot be introduced by the classical breeding methods or which take a lengthy process to be introduced due to genetic barriers occur­ring during crossing. Conventional breeding methods and genetic engineering methods have been used to improve the sugar beet genome by the introduction of genes for resistance to Cercospora, rhizomania and nematodes. Presently, genes that modify the carbohydrate metabolism and genes that confer resistance to the active substances in certain herbicides may be introduced only by means of genetic engineering methods. ...|$|R
40|$|The gene {{expression}} process in nature evaluates the tness of a DNA through {{the production of}} different proteins in different cells. The production of protein from DNA goes through transcription that first produces the mRNA and subsequently translates the mRNA to the amino acid sequence in protein.

More precisely, such transformations can construct a Fourier representation with only a polynomial number of terms that are exponentially more significant than the rest. Polynomial-complexity approximation of functions from data is a fundamental problem in inductive learning, data mining, search, and optimization. Therefore the work has important implications in these areas. It is unlikely that such representations can be constructed for all functions.

Many methods have been conducted to improve the secondary metabolite yield and productivity of endophytes, such as mutagenesis (Zhou et al. 2010), <b>genetic</b> <b>transformations</b> (Liu et al. 2013), optimization of fermentation parameters (Wang et al. 2014), elicitor/inhibitor addition (Venugopalan and Srivastava 2015), precursor feeding (Guerrabubb et al. 2012), use of adsorbent resins/solid supports (Luo et al. 2014; Singh et al. 2010), co-cultivation and mixed fermentation (Kusari et al. 2011), and use of epigenetic modifiers (Brakhage 2013).
