5|$|In 1965, {{he stood}} to <b>inherit</b> his elder brother's baronetcy, {{together}} with a large estate. This inheritance was challenged by his cousin, who argued that the re-registration was invalid; under this interpretation, Forbes would legally be considered a woman, and thus unable to <b>inherit.</b> The legal position was unclear, and it took three years before a ruling by the Court of Session was finally upheld by the Home Secretary, granting him the title. The case was held in great secrecy, with the effect that it was unable {{to be considered in}} other judgments on the legal recognition of gender variance, but has become more widely known since his death in 1991.|$|E

5|$|Before version 3.0, Python had {{two kinds}} of classes: old-style and new-style. The syntax of both styles is the same, the {{difference}} being whether the class object is inherited from, directly or indirectly (all new-style classes <b>inherit</b> from object and are instances of type). In versions of Python 2 from Python 2.2 onwards, both kinds of classes can be used. Old-style classes were eliminated in Python 3.0.|$|E
5|$|Circumstantial {{evidence}} supporting the social pre-wiring hypothesis can be revealed when examining newborns' behavior.

Rather, newborns most likely <b>inherit</b> to some extent social behavior and identity through genetics.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Growing {{evidence}} indicates that <b>inherited</b> metabolic diseases are increasingly being recognised. Life expectancy for many patients is progressively improving because new therapeutic strategies are available. Because most <b>inherited</b> metabolic diseases are systemic disorders, virtually all organs may be involved. Respiratory disease complicates the management of several <b>inherited</b> metabolic diseases, either at presentation or as late-onset features. This review will describe the most exemplary respiratory manifestations of <b>inherited</b> metabolic diseases in childhood and adulthood. Since airways disease worsens the morbidity of many <b>inherited</b> metabolic disorders, leading to increased hospitalisations, mortality and overall healthcare costs, respiratory manifestations of <b>inherited</b> metabolic diseases need to be carefully recognised and treated. All patients with <b>inherited</b> metabolic disease and suspected airway disease should undergo a detailed diagnostic work-up. Current treatments for several <b>inherited</b> metabolic diseases (including enzyme replacement therapy, substrate reduction, bone marrow transplantation, or even more innovative strategies such as pharmacological chaperone or gene therapies) may provide significant benefits for associated respiratory disease. The integration of several specialists dedicated to airway disease management in a multidisciplinary team is essential to provide the most appropriate care to children and adults with <b>inherited</b> metabolic disease...|$|R

5|$|Progeny of {{two parents}} of {{different}} breeds are termed F1 hybrids, F1 crosses or first crosses. F1 hybrids generally have an extremely uniform phenotype {{and benefit from}} hybrid vigour. These advantages are observed in the breeding {{of a wide variety}} of animals and plants, and arise because progeny <b>inherit</b> one of each paired gene from each parent. When both parents are homozygous for different variants of genes (known as alleles), which is likely to be the case when a breed has been developed and selected over several generations, progeny will <b>inherit</b> both gene variants present in the parents. The F1 hybrid progeny will then be heterozygous for each gene variant, which in turn increases the likelihood that the genes will code for an optimal protein or enzyme. This is the genetic basis of hybrid vigour. While many gene variants have effects that are of little consequence to beef production, a few, such as the myostatin variants found in different cattle breeds, have a major effect.|$|E
