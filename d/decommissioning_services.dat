40|$|The law {{surrounding}} {{third party}} nuclear liability {{is important to}} all parties in the nuclear supply chain whether they are providing <b>decommissioning</b> <b>services,</b> project management expertise or a new reactor. This paper examines third party nuclear liability, and in particular, {{in relation to a}} Supplier in the nuclear energy sector in the United Kingdom (UK). The term "Supplier" is used in this paper and, depending on the context, is intended to cover all parties in the supply chain providing services, equipment or technology (e. g. the EPC contractor, the reactor vender, the owner engineer, architect engineer, or the Parent Body Organisation responsible for decommissioning one the UK legacy nuclear installations). With a return to nuclear new build expected in the UK, the clarification of the position of a Supplier and their potential to be liable for nuclear damage is of vital importance for a functioning nuclear supply chain. The research explores the nuclear liability legislation in the UK and identifies the gaps and limitations in existence. The latter problems pose a risk for the Suppliers to operators in the nuclear energy industry, and consequently some approaches that can mitigate those risks are advanced and assessed. The nuclear liability regime in the UK is largely based on international conventions and hence, the risks posed to the Supplier in the UK also exist for Suppliers in other countries. There are resource shortages already in the nuclear energy industry, and currently the Supplier to the nuclear industry is over exposed. This situation needs to be resolved and a new legal definition of nuclear damage enacted. Further, the level of liability exposure for a UK Supplier involved in a nuclear project outside the UK needs to be reviewed as there remains too much ambiguity regarding liability in an international nuclear law context...|$|E
40|$|Background: Since 1991, {{there has}} been a series of reforms of the English National Health Service (NHS) entailing an {{increasing}} separation between the commissioners of services and a widening range of public and independent sector providers able to compete for contracts to provide services to NHS patients. We examine the extent to which local commissioners had adopted a market-oriented (transactional) model of commissioning of care for people with long term conditions several years into the latest period of market-oriented reform. The paper also considers the factors that may have inhibited or supported market-oriented behaviour, including the presence of conditions conducive to a health care quasi-market. Methods: We studied the commissioning of services for people with three long term conditions - diabetes, stroke and dementia - in three English primary care trust (PCT) areas over two years (2010 - 12). We took a broadly ethnographic approach to understanding the day-to-day practice of commissioning. Data were collected through interviews, observation of meetings and from documents. Results: In contrast to a transactional, market-related approach organised around commissioner choice of provider and associated contracting, commissioning was largely relational, based on trust and collaboration with incumbent providers. There was limited sign of commissioners significantly challenging providers, changing providers, or <b>decommissioning</b> <b>services.</b> In none of the service areas were all the conditions for a well functioning quasi-market in health care in place. Choice of provider was generally absent or limited; information on demand and resource requirements was highly imperfect; motivations were complex; and transaction costs uncertain, but likely to be high. It was difficult to divide care into neat units for contracting purposes. As a result, it is scarcely surprising that commissioning practice in relation to all six commissioning developments was dominated by a relational approach. Conclusions: Our findings challenge the notion of a strict separation of commissioners and providers, and instead demonstrate the adaptive persistence of relational commissioning based on continuity of provision, trust and interdependence between commissioners and providers, at least for services for people with long-term conditions...|$|E

40|$|The {{landscape}} for public services is changing rapidly. In {{the context of}} significant and sustained reductions in public spending, changing public expectations and rising demand, those who design and deliver public services {{have to contend with}} a very different set of circumstances in which to innovate. They will also need to become more adept at creative decommissioning - taking resources out of less effective approaches in order to reinvest elsewhere. This research report confronts a more disruptive side to public services innovation - how to shut down or decommission what is already in place. Having looked at examples {{from all over the world}} where there have been efforts to decommission and innovate, the report presents a new model for truly transformational public innovation and includes lessons for practitioners and policymakers on how to navigate this difficult and contentious space. The research is based on a quantitative survey of over 200 public leaders from local government and health organisations on current drivers and approaches to decommissioning, qualitative analysis of over 60 cases of <b>decommissioning</b> in public <b>services</b> including interviews with key stakeholders, and interviews with informants with a range of perspectives on the issues.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{examine the}} {{challenges}} to using systematic review evidence to develop guidance for <b>decommissioning</b> ineffective health <b>services,</b> {{and the problems}} experienced by clinicians and commissioners when they attempt to implement the evidence from this guidance. METHODS: Interviews with 23 clinicians and 15 commissioners from nine commissioning organizations (Primary Care Trusts) {{in the south of}} England. RESULTS: Participants identified generic and intervention-specific barriers to using systematic review evidence to develop and implement decommissioning. Generic barriers included: contradictions within the health care system arising from policy; managing a high volume of evidence; difficulty in applying the evidence to the local context; and patient or parent expectations. Intervention-specific factors included: the influence of industry; an absence of systems for monitoring local implementation of guidance; and the availability of different codes for the same procedure which made monitoring some practices unreliable. CONCLUSIONS: The micro practices of commissioners are shaped by the wider system of health policy, the knowledge producing and delivery agencies associated with health care, and power dynamics within the health care system. If decommissioning is to be guided by evidence, then adequate resources to support the process are necessary. This includes long-term engagement of clinicians, providing alternatives to the decommissioned activity and tackling perverse incentives. An important precursor to decommissioning is obtaining data on {{the nature and extent of}} current clinical practice and using these data to monitor variation in the implementation of guidance...|$|R
40|$|The US DOE has {{initiated}} a multidisciplinary cross cutting project {{to develop a}} reasonable and credible set of tools to predict the structural, hydraulic and chemical performance of cement barriers used in nuclear applications over extended time frames (e. g., > 100 years for operating facilities and > 1000 years for waste management). A partnership that combines DOE, NRC, academia, private sector, and international expertise has been formed to accomplish the project objectives by integrating existing information and realizing advancements where necessary. The set of simulation tools and data developed under this project {{will be used to}} evaluate and predict the behavior of cementitious barriers used in near surface engineered waste disposal systems, e. g., waste forms, containment structures, entombments and environmental remediation, including decontamination and decommissioning (D&D) activities. The simulation tools will also support analysis of structural concrete components of nuclear facilities (spent fuel pools, dry spent fuel storage units, and recycling facilities, e. g., fuel fabrication, separations processes). Simulation parameters will be obtained from prior literature and will be experimentally measured under this project, as necessary, to demonstrate application of the simulation tools for three prototype applications (waste form in concrete vault, high level waste tank grouting, and spent fuel pool). Test methods and data needs to support use of the simulation tools for future applications will be defined. This is a national issue that affects all waste disposal sites that use cementitious waste forms and structures, decontamination and <b>decommissioning</b> activities, <b>service</b> life determination of existing structures, and design of future public and private nuclear facilities. The problem is difficult because it requires projecting conditions and responses over extremely long times. Current performance assessment analyses show that engineered barriers are typically the primary control to prevent the release of radionuclides from nuclear facilities into the environment. In the absence of an adequate predictive tool, assessments cannot fully incorporate the effectiveness of the concrete barriers, and the inventory of radionuclides (especially the long-lived radionuclides) that may be safely disposed of in shallow land disposal and the predicted service life of operating nuclear facilities. This project is 5 year effort focused on reducing uncertainties associated with current methodologies for assessing cementitious barrier performance and increasing the consistency and transparency of the assessment process. The results of this project will enable improved risk-informed, performance-based decision making, and supports several of the strategic initiatives in the DOE-EM Engineering & Technology Roadmap...|$|R
40|$|Public sector organisations {{are facing}} {{one of the}} most {{difficult}} financial periods in history and local decision-makers are tasked with making tough rationing decisions. Withdrawing or limiting services is an emotive and complex task and something the National Health Service has always found difficult. Over time, local authorities have gained significant experience in the closure of care homes – an equally complex and controversial issue. Drawing on local knowledge and best practice examples, this article highlights lessons and themes identified by those <b>decommissioning</b> care home <b>services.</b> We believe that such lessons are relevant to those making disinvestment decisions across public sector services, including health-care. The study employed semi-structured interviews with 12 Directors of Adult Social Services who had been highlighted nationally as having extensive experience of home closures. Interviews were conducted over a 2 -week period in March 2011. Results from the study found that having local policy guidance that is perceived as fair and reasonable was advocated by those involved in home closures. Many local policies had evolved over time and had often been developed following experiences of home closures (both good and bad). Decisions to close care home services require a combination of strong leadership, clear strategic goals, a fair decision-making process, strong evidence of the need for change and good communication, alongside wider stakeholder engagement and support. The current financial challenge means that public sector organisations need to make tough choices on investment and disinvestment decisions. Any such decisions need to be influenced by what we know constitutes best practice. Sharing lessons and experiences within and between sectors could well inform and develop decision-making practices...|$|R
