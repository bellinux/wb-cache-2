On the one hand, the detection of oscillations inside single behavior modules is based on analyzing the signal in the frequency domain using the Fast Fourier Transformation (fft). On the other hand, tracing oscillations through the behavior network helps to evaluate its propagation and to find its root cause. Results of the oscillation analysis are presented us-ing appropriate visualization techniques. The suitability of the proposed approach is shown by an <b>indoor</b> <b>application.</b> ...|$|R

50|$|Another {{example of}} a {{physical}} medium is optical fiber, which {{has emerged as the}} most commonly used transmission medium for long-distance communications. Optical fiber is a thin strand of glass that guides light along its length. Four major factors favor optical fiber over copper- data rates, distance, installation, and costs. Optical fiber can carry huge amounts of data compared to copper. It can be run for hundreds of miles without the need for signal repeaters, in turn, reducing maintenance costs and improving the reliability of the communication system because repeaters are a common source of network failures. Glass is lighter than copper allowing for less need for specialized heavy-lifting equipment when installing long-distance optical fiber. Optical fiber for <b>indoor</b> <b>applications</b> cost approximately a dollar a foot, the same as copper.|$|E
