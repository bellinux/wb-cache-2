40|$|International audienceThis paper {{proposes a}} {{flexible}} control framework for relational personal data that enforces data orig-inators' <b>dissemination</b> <b>policies.</b> Inspired by the sticky policy paradigm and mandatory access control, <b>dissemination</b> <b>policies</b> are linked with atomic data and are combined when different pieces of data are merged.

We show that the framework can capture a large class of policies {{similar to those of}} lattice-based access control models and that it can be integrated seamlessly into relational database management systems. In particular, we define a path oriented dissemination control model where policies define authorized chains of transfers between databases.

Diverse pieces of public information can {{be taken into account}} differently by different players and are likely to lead to different appreciations "ex post". This process defines players' expected private values of a successful attack. The main result shows that equilibrium uniqueness depends on two conditions: (i) signals are sufficiently dispersed and (ii) private beliefs about signals' relative precision differ sufficiently. We derive some implications for information <b>dissemination</b> <b>policy.</b> Transparency in this context is multidimensional: it concerns the publicity of announcements, the number of signals disclosed and their precision.

40|$|The {{authorities}} often {{disclose their}} economic forecasts {{to the public}} ambiguously. The more ambiguous {{the way in which}} they present the information, the more variously market participants interpret such announcements. Hence, an ambiguous public announcement mixes some private noise to the authorities’ economic forecasts. Using Keynesian beauty contest games, as in Morris and Shin (2002), we find that mixing private noise into public information is often socially beneficial. We also derive the optimal information <b>dissemination</b> <b>policy</b> and find that (i) for a given level of ambiguity, it may be better not to release information, and (ii) if ambiguity can be chosen freely, it is optimal to release the most precise information, but with an appropriate degree of ambiguity. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{analyze the}} {{performance}} limits of data dissemination with multi-channel, single radio sensors. We formulate {{the problem of}} minimizing the average delay of data dissemination as a stochastic shortest path problem and show that, for an arbitrary topology network, an optimal control policy {{can be found in}} a finite number of steps, using value iteration or Dijsktra’s algorithm. However, the computational complexity of this solution is generally prohibitive. We thus focus on two special classes of network topologies of practical interest, namely single-hop clusters and multi-hop cluster trees. For these topologies, we derive the structure of policies that achieve an average delay within a factor 1 +ɛ of the optimal average delay, in networks with large number of nodes. Through simulation, we show that these policies perform close to optimal even for networks with small and moderate numbers of nodes. Our analysis and simulations reveal that multichannel data <b>dissemination</b> <b>policies</b> lead to a drastic reduction in the average delay, up to a factor as large as the total number of channels available, even though each node can communicate over only one channel at any point of time. Finally, we present the foundations of a methodology, based on extreme value theory, allowing the implementation of our near-optimal <b>dissemination</b> <b>policies</b> with minimal overhead.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{economic}} forces that drive innovation in credit-risk assessment {{and the role}} of regulators in fostering technological progress. Recent regulatory proposals base capital-adequacy standards on banks' own internal systems and call for regulators to establish a set of "best practices" for the industry. We find that the dissemination of innovations mandated by this approach generates a tension between lowering aggregate banking-system risk ex post and providing banks with incentives to innovate ex ante. Moreover, this tension arises purely from regulatory concern for bank safety and not from any interest in promoting competition. We show that achieving the optimal level of innovation requires that regulators restrict the di#usion of technology. If regulators are unable to commit to specific <b>dissemination</b> <b>policies,</b> it may be beneficial to let banks assert intellectual property rights through, for instance, the patenting of their innovations...|$|R

40|$|Platooning {{is widely}} {{considered}} a promising approach to decrease fuel consumption by reducing the air drag. However, {{in order to achieve}} the benefits of aerodynamic efficiency, the inter-vehicle distances must be kept short. This implies that the intra-platoon communication must not only be reliable but also able to meet strict timing deadlines. In this paper, we propose a framework that reliably handles the co-existence of both time-triggered and event-driven control messages in platooning applications and we derive an efficient message dissemination technique. We propose a semi-centralized time division multiple access (TDMA) approach, which e. g., can be placed on top of the current standard IEEE 802. 11 p and we evaluate the resulting error probability and delay, when using it to broadcast periodic beacons and disseminating eventdriven messages within a platoon. Simulation results indicate that the proposed <b>dissemination</b> <b>policy</b> significantly enhances the reliability for a given number of available time-slots, or alternatively, reduces the delay, in terms of time-slots, required to achieve a certain target error probability, without degrading the performance of co-existing time-triggered messages. © 2015 IEEEACD...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We {{hypothesize that}} this {{variation}} in the extent and nature of financial data disseminated through corporate Web sites {{is associated with the}} factors that influence the initial disclosure of financial information. We consider information items that contain required disclosures separately from those that contain mainly voluntary disclosures, since most previous work that identifies factors affecting financial disclosures have focused on discretionary information. To test our hypotheses, we employ a sample of companies rated by the AIMR. We use the AIMR’s disclosure quality rating as an independent variable to investigate whether companies have disclosure profiles that carry over to their Web dissemination practices. Our results confirm that they do, although mainly with respect to the presentation of voluntarily produced financial data. Consistent with extant literature on voluntary disclosure, our evidence suggests that firms develop a Web-based <b>dissemination</b> <b>policy</b> based on their size, need to access the capital markets, need to reduce information asymmetry, and their non-Web-based disclosure personality. Of particular interest, these results indicate that some of the incentives thought to motivate initial voluntary disclosure also explain subsequent voluntary dissemination...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Data {{management}} {{issues in}} mobile computing environments have {{got lots of}} concerns of relevant researchers. Among these research topics, data broadcast has been extensively investigated due to its advantages such as scalability and bandwidth effectiveness. While plenty of works have been done on this subject, it is still less touched when data broadcast is used to deliver constantly updated real-time data to read-only transactions with deadlines. In this paper, we first deeply analyze the data dissemination requirements for readonly transaction processing in mobile real-time computing environments and formally define several performance objectives. Then a novel updates dissemination protocol called mixed real-time data broadcast is proposed. In mixed real-time data broadcast, a set of new techniques including reducing the length of consistency intervals, immediate updates <b>dissemination</b> <b>policy</b> and ondemand data delivery are incorporated seamlessly. Moreover, an enhanced index structure is designed for read-only transactions to judge precisely when to request the desired data. Simulation {{results show that the}} proposed protocol can provide higher data currency and lower miss rate compared with existing updates dissemination protocols and is more appropriate for mobile real-time computing environments. ...|$|E

Genomic selection also opens new avenues for more customized breeding across herds or production systems. A big challenge is to reduce the dependency of genomic predictions on relationship between candidates and the reference population. A strong effort is presently dedicated to integrating genome sequence information into predictions, to improve their accuracy and persistency.
