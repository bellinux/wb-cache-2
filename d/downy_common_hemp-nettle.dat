50|$|<b>Common</b> <b>hemp-nettle</b> is {{native to}} Europe and northwestern Asia. Its typical habitat is rough ground, arable land, logging {{clearances}} and waste places. It spreads readily as its sharp calyces adhere to clothing and animal pelts.|$|R
50|$|Galeopsis bifida is {{an annual}} plant native to Europe and Asia but now found in Canada and the northeastern, midwestern {{parts of the}} United States. It has many common names such as bifid <b>hemp-nettle,</b> split-lip <b>hemp-nettle,</b> <b>common</b> <b>hemp-nettle,</b> and large-flowered hemp-nettle. The genus name means weasel-like, {{referring}} to the corolla of the flower. It is often confused with other species of Lamiaceae such as Mentha arvensis, Dracocephalum parviflorum and Stachys pilosa.|$|R
50|$|<b>Common</b> <b>hemp-nettle</b> is an erect annual {{plant and}} grows to {{a height of}} about 20 to 70 cm. The stem {{branches}} occasionally and is squarish and hairy, with glandular hairs on {{the upper part of}} the plant. The nodes are swollen and widely spaced and the pale green, stalked leaves are in opposite pairs. The leaf blades are hairy and are ovate with a long tapered tip and with regular large teeth on the margin. The inflorescence forms a terminal spike and is composed of whorls of pinkish flowers with dark markings on the lower lip. The calyx has five sharp-pointed lobes and the corolla forms a two-lipped flower about 15 to 20 mm long with a fused tube. The upper lip of each flower is convex with dense, glandular hairs and the lower lip is three-lobed, the central lobe being the largest, squarish with a flat or rounded edge. There are four stamens, two long and two short, the gynoecium has two fused carpels and the fruit is a four-chambered schizocarp. The plant has a slightly unpleasant smell.|$|R

5|$|The white-breasted {{nuthatch}} often {{travels with}} small mixed flocks in winter. These flocks {{are led by}} titmice and chickadees, with nuthatches and <b>downy</b> woodpeckers as <b>common</b> attendant species. Participants in such flocks are thought to benefit in terms of foraging and predator avoidance. It {{is likely that the}} attendant species also access the information carried in the chickadees' calls and reduce their own level of vigilance accordingly.|$|R
50|$|Downy birch can be {{distinguished}} from silver birch with its smooth, downy shoots, which are hairless and warty in silver birch. The bark of the downy birch is a dull greyish white, whereas the silver birch has striking white, papery bark with black fissures. The leaf margins also differ, finely serrated in downy birch, coarsely double-toothed in silver birch. The two have differences in habitat requirements, with <b>downy</b> birch more <b>common</b> on wet, poorly drained sites, such as clays and peat bogs, and silver birch found mainly on dry, sandy soils.|$|R
50|$|Aphanes arvensis, {{known as}} parsley-piert, is a sprawling, <b>downy</b> plant <b>common</b> {{all over the}} British Isles where It grows on arable fields and bare wastelands, {{particularly}} in dry sites. The short-stalked leaves have three segments each lobed at the tip. Flowers April-September. The tiny green flower has four sepals and no petals, the fruit is oval pointed. Stipules form a leaf-like cup, enclosing the flower. The name of parsley piert {{has nothing to do}} with parsley. It is a corruption of the French perce-pierre, meaning 'stone-piercer' and was given to the plant because of its habit of growing in shallow, stony soil and emerging between stones. As in the case of saxifrage (from the Latin meaning 'stone-breaker') it was wrongly assumed that the plant could pierce stones; and it was thought that a medicine made of parsley piert would break up stones in the bladder and kidneys. Old folk-names for the plant include 'colicwort' and 'bowel-hive-grass' (hive meant inflammation), showing that it was also used for intestinal ailments.|$|R
40|$|Downy mildews are a {{group of}} closely related {{pathogens}} that can cause major damage in the nursery, greenhouse, and landscape {{in the form of}} leaf spots, blights, and distortions. Some <b>common</b> <b>downy</b> mildew hosts include alyssum (Alyssum spp.), aster (Aster spp.), butterfly bush (Buddleia spp.), coreopsis (Coreopsis spp.), crane’s bill or hardy geranium (Geranium spp.), Geum (Geum spp.), kale (Brassica oleracae), dead nettles (Lamium spp.), pansy (Viola x wittrockiana), phlox (Phlox spp.), rose (Rosa spp.), rosemary (Rosemarinus spp.), sage (Salvia spp.), snapdragon (Antirrhinum), veronica (Veronica spp.), viburnum (Viburnum spp.), and violets (Viola spp.).

50|$|The {{mountains}} {{near the}} border with Sweden have peaks up to 1500 m above sea level, and with a large glacier, Gihtsejiegŋa. There are several nature reserves in Tysfjord. Mannfjordbotn reserve has undisturbed forests {{at the head of}} a narrow fjord branch surrounded by granite mountain walls. From Hellemobotn, at the head of Hellemofjorden, the distance to the border with Sweden is only 6.3 km; this is also a scenic hiking terrain (Picture) with a canyon opening up in Hellemobotn (Picture). There are also caves, such as the very deep Raggejavreraige. Lakes in the region include Baugevatnet, Båvrojávrre, Kilvatnet, Langvatnet, and Skilvatnet. Silver birch occurs in Tysfjord, as one of few areas in North Norway (silver birch need more summer warmth than the more <b>common</b> <b>downy</b> birch).|$|R
5|$|B. pendula is {{distinguished}} from the related downy birch (B. pubescens, the other common European birch) in having hairless, warty shoots (hairy and without warts in downy birch), more triangular leaves with double serration on the margins (more ovoid and with single serrations in downy birch), and whiter bark often with scattered black fissures (greyer, less fissured, in downy birch). It is also distinguished cytologically, silver birch being diploid (with two sets of chromosomes), whereas downy birch is tetraploid (four sets of chromosomes). Hybrids between the two are known, but are very rare, and being triploid, are sterile. The two have differences in habitat requirements, with silver birch found mainly on dry, sandy soils, and <b>downy</b> birch more <b>common</b> on wet, poorly drained sites such as clay soils and peat bogs. Silver birch also demands slightly more summer warmth than does downy birch, which is significant in the cooler parts of Europe. Many North American texts treat the two species as conspecific (and cause confusion by combining the downy birch's alternative vernacular name 'white birch', with the scientific name B. pendula of the other species), but they are regarded as distinct species throughout Europe.|$|R
40|$|Availability of {{the oldest}} age-class of balsam fir (Abies balsamea) forest, the major forest type of western Newfoundland, is declining through logging, insect effects, and {{management}} for a 60 -year harvest rotation. Loss of old-growth balsam fir forests may limit the availability of woodpecker habitat if nesting trees and feeding substrates are most abundant in these later successional stages. We assessed abundance of black-backed woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus), downy woodpeckers (P. pubescens), and hairy woodpeckers (P. villosus) in 10 stands in each of 3 forest age classes (40 - 59, 60 - 79, and > 80 yr) of balsam fir in western Newfoundland. For each stand, we quantified 10 habitat variables that may have influenced habitat use by woodpeckers. Black-backed woodpeckers were almost exclusively found in > 80 -year-old forests. Density of black-backed wood-peckers {{was significantly related to}} number of large snags, but negatively to the total number of dead stems. <b>Downy</b> woodpeckers were <b>common</b> and similarly distributed among the 3 forest age classes, and hairy wood-peckers were uncommon and only observed in the 40 - and 60 -year age classes. Downy and hairy woodpeckers were significantly associated with the number of white birch snags in the stands, a resource that declined with forest age. A reduction in the amount of forest in the oldest age class is probably reducing the population of black-backed woodpeckers in western Newfoundland. We recommend a series of fixed-width transects, coupled with point counts using call broadcasts, as an effective means of surveying woodpeckers. Forest managers must maintain large areas of old forests, temporally and spatially, to maintain black-backed woodpeckers in Newfoundland...|$|R
