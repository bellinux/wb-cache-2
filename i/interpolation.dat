5|$|Shen Kuo was {{the first}} to discern {{magnetic}} declination of true north while experimenting with a compass. Shen theorized that geographical climates gradually shifted over time. He created a theory of land formation involving concepts accepted in modern geomorphology. He performed optical experiments with camera obscura just decades after Ibn al-Haytham {{was the first}} to do so. He also improved the designs of astronomical instruments such as the widened astronomical sighting tube, which allowed Shen Kuo to fix the position of the pole star (which had shifted over centuries of time). Shen Kuo was also known for hydraulic clockworks, as he invented a new overflow-tank clepsydra which had more efficient higher-order <b>interpolation</b> instead of linear <b>interpolation</b> in calibrating the measure of time.|$|E
50|$|The text of {{the play}} is very poor, and {{scholars}} have detected several <b>interpolations</b> in the text. Over the centuries large and small <b>interpolations</b> have been inserted into this tragedy. Some scholars even believe that the whole play is post-Euripidean, written {{in the style of}} the late Euripides. For more about <b>interpolations</b> in the text, see Donald J. Mastronarde, Phoenissae.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new two-dimensional (2 -D) cylindrical geometry to three-dimensional (3 -D) rectangular x-y-z splice option for multi-dimensional discrete ordinates {{solutions to the}} neutron (photon) transport equation. Of particular interest are the simple transformations developed and applied in order {{to carry out the}} required spatial and angular <b>interpolations.</b> The spatial <b>interpolations</b> are linear and equivalent to those applied elsewhere. The angular <b>interpolations</b> are based on a high order spherical harmonics representation of the angular flux. Advantages of the current angular <b>interpolations</b> over previous work are discussed. An application to an intricate streaming problem is provided to demonstrate the advantages of the new method for efficient and accurate prediction of particle behavior in complex geometries...|$|R
5|$|Some authors {{consider}} the marriage episode of Tulsidas to be a later <b>interpolation</b> and maintain {{that he was}} a bachelor. They include Rambhadracharya, who interprets two verses in the Vinayapatrika and Hanuman Bahuka to mean that Tulsidas never married and was a Sadhu from childhood.|$|E
5|$|The cantata is scored {{for four}} soloists—soprano, alto, tenor and bass—a four-part choir, two oboes d'amore, two violins, viola and basso continuo. It is {{structured}} {{in two parts}} of four movements each. Its <b>interpolation</b> of chorus and arias with chorales is unique in Bach's cantatas.|$|E
25|$|Other {{forms of}} <b>interpolation</b> can be {{constructed}} by picking a different class of interpolants. For instance, rational <b>interpolation</b> is <b>interpolation</b> by rational functions using Padé approximant, and trigonometric <b>interpolation</b> is <b>interpolation</b> by trigonometric polynomials using Fourier series. Another possibility is to use wavelets.|$|E

25|$|Like {{polynomial}} <b>interpolation,</b> spline <b>interpolation</b> incurs {{a smaller}} error than linear <b>interpolation</b> and the interpolant is smoother. However, the interpolant {{is easier to}} evaluate than the high-degree polynomials used in polynomial <b>interpolation.</b> It also does not suffer from Runge's phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|However, {{polynomial}} <b>interpolation</b> {{also has}} some disadvantages. Calculating the interpolating polynomial is computationally expensive (see computational complexity) compared to linear <b>interpolation.</b> Furthermore, polynomial <b>interpolation</b> may exhibit oscillatory artifacts, especially at the end points (see Runge's phenomenon).|$|E

We derive {{estimates}} for the truncation, amplitude and jitter type errors associated with Hermite-type <b>interpolations</b> at equidistant nodes of functions in Paley-Wiener spaces.

25|$|The {{simplest}} <b>interpolation</b> {{method is}} to locate the nearest data value, and assign the same value. In simple problems, this method {{is unlikely to be}} used, as linear <b>interpolation</b> (see below) is almost as easy, but in higher-dimensional multivariate <b>interpolation,</b> this could be a favourable choice for its speed and simplicity.|$|E

25|$|Polynomial <b>interpolation</b> is a {{generalization}} of linear <b>interpolation.</b> Note that the linear interpolant is a linear function. We now replace this interpolant with a polynomial of higher degree.|$|E

25|$|Generally, {{if we have}} n data points, {{there is}} exactly one {{polynomial}} of degree at most n1 going through all the data points. The <b>interpolation</b> error {{is proportional to the}} distance between the data points to the power n. Furthermore, the interpolant is a polynomial and thus infinitely differentiable. So, we see that polynomial <b>interpolation</b> overcomes most of the problems of linear <b>interpolation.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{different}} {{problem which}} {{is closely related}} to <b>interpolation</b> is the approximation of a complicated function by a simple function. Suppose the formula for some given function is known, but too complex to evaluate efficiently. A few known data points from the original function can be used to create an <b>interpolation</b> based on a simpler function. Of course, when a simple function is used to estimate data points from the original, <b>interpolation</b> errors are usually present; however, depending on the problem domain and the <b>interpolation</b> method used, the gain in simplicity may be of greater value than the resultant loss in precision.|$|E
25|$|When each {{data point}} {{is itself a}} function, it can be useful to see the <b>interpolation</b> problem as a partial {{advection}} problem between each data point. This idea leads to the displacement <b>interpolation</b> problem used in transportation theory.|$|E
