President Obama has indicated <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> veto the bill.|$|E
25|$|Gifford {{continued}} to play for Warwickshire into his late forties, and when he retired from playing {{at the age of}} 48 in 1988, he had taken 2,068 first-class wickets. The reduction in the amount of first-class cricket played means that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> remain the last man to have broken the 2,000 mark. Never much of a batsman, he made only three half-centuries in more than 800 innings, his 7,000 runs coming at an average of just 13. After retirement, Gifford went into coaching and became coach of first Sussex, and then Durham.|$|E
25|$|He scored his 212 against Canterbury in 260 minutes. He {{opened the}} batting {{on the first}} day, was 103 not out at lunch, and was fourth out not long after tea with the score at 343, on a day in which Wellington scored 494 for 9 wickets off 94 eight-ball overs. So <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have scored at a little under a run a ball. His 204 {{a few weeks later}} was {{probably}} a little slower, but no less impressive: he came to the wicket at 18 for 1, reached his double-century in 262 minutes, and was last out in a team total of 374 off 85.1 overs.|$|E

25|$|The right {{wall of the}} {{corridor}} show the scenes {{from the life of}} the Buddha. These include Sujata offering food to the Buddha with a begging bowl in white dress, Tapussa and Bhalluka next to the Buddha after they offering wheat and honey to the Buddha as monk, the future Buddha sitting alone under a tree, and the Buddha at a ploughing festival. One mural shows Buddha's parents trying to dissuade him from becoming a monk. Another shows the Buddha at the palace surrounded by men in dhoti and women in sari as his behavior presents the four signs that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> renounce. On this side of {{the corridor}} are also paintings that show the future Buddha as a baby with sage Asita with rishi-like looks. According to Spink, some of the Cave 16 paintings were left incomplete.|$|E
25|$|James Cook {{was born}} on 7 November 1728 (N.S.) {{in the village of}} Marton in Yorkshire and baptised on 14 November (N.S.) in the parish church of St Cuthbert, where his name {{can be seen in the}} church register. He was the second of eight {{children}} of James Cook, a Scottish farm labourer from Ednam in Roxburghshire, and his locally born wife, Grace Pace, from Thornaby-on-Tees. In 1736, his family moved to Airey Holme farm at Great Ayton, where his father's employer, Thomas Skottowe, paid for him to attend the local school. In 1741, after five years' schooling, he began work for his father, who had been promoted to farm manager. For leisure, he would climb a nearby hill, Roseberry Topping, enjoying the opportunity for solitude. Cooks' Cottage, his parents' last home, which <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have visited, is now in Melbourne, Australia, having been moved from England and reassembled, brick by brick, in 1934.|$|E
500|$|Harrison's musical biographer, Simon Leng, views [...] "Dark Horse" [...] as its {{composer}} addressing {{his critics}} {{by creating a}} [...] "new persona". [...] "This 'George' is a man {{one step ahead of}} his detractors," [...] Leng writes, [...] "triumphing with quicker feet and better gags. Commentators try to pin his character down at peril, for <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> change and take the least expected course." [...] In the song's choruses, Harrison declares himself [...] "a dark horse / Running on a dark race course", [...] "a blue moon", and a [...] "cool jerk" [...] who is [...] "Looking for the source". Leng paraphrases this self-depiction as meaning [...] "a loner" [...] and [...] "an elusive, cheeky maverick".|$|E

60|$|The {{thought of}} detectives, in this connection, led him <b>to</b> decide that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> shadowed. That {{was the most}} natural thing for his opponents to do. They could not prove Mershone's {{complicity}} in the disappearance of Louise Merrick, but they might easily suspect him, after that little affair of Weldon's arrest. Therefore if he went to the girl now <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> lead others to her. Better be cautious and wait until he had thrown the sleuths off his track.|$|R
5000|$|The Manchester Guardian {{observed}} that Morgan was putting [...] "a {{great deal of}} effort" [...] into his campaign, and hoped to attract votes from supporters of the Conservatives, Liberals and Communists. The paper speculated that, although <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> save his deposit, <b>he</b> would <b>be</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> receive fewer than 4,000 votes, while Evans might take as many as 28,000.|$|R
500|$|At {{the start}} of the 1902 rugby season in May, Verge was up for {{selection}} to the University first XV, either at fullback or threequarter, and also for NSW as fullback. He took the place at fullback on the University XV from A. J. McKenzie. By June 1902, Verge was gaining recognition in the press. The Referee reported: [...] "Verge, as full back, deserves a special word of praise for quickness and all-round ability: he has steadily improved until he now may be compared with any man we have in the position. And <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> still further improve." [...] After a lacklustre performance by John Maund at fullback in the first inter-state match between NSW and Queensland, Verge gained his first cap for NSW in the return match on 19 July 1902 at University Oval, Sydney.|$|E
500|$|The defence {{comes in}} two forms; where the {{defendant}} {{claims he was}} insane {{at the time of}} the crime, and where the defendant asserts he is insane at the time of trial. In the first situation, the defendant must show that he was either suffering from a disease which damaged the functioning of the mind and led to a defect of reason that prevented him from understanding what he was doing, or that he could not tell that what he was doing was wrong. In the second situation, the test is whether or not the defendant can differentiate between [...] "guilty" [...] and [...] "not guilty" [...] verdicts, instruct counsel and recognise the charges he is facing. If successful, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be detained under the Criminal Procedure (Insanity) Act 1964, although judges have a wide discretion as to what to do.|$|E
500|$|Beecham {{has been}} much quoted. In 1929, {{the editor of a}} music journal wrote, [...] "The stories {{gathered}} around Sir Thomas Beecham are innumerable. Wherever musicians come together, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be one of the topics of conversation. Everyone telling a Beecham story tries to imitate his manner and his tone of voice." [...] A book, Beecham Stories, was published in 1978 consisting entirely of his bons mots and anecdotes about him. Some are variously attributed to Beecham or one or more other people, including Arnold Bax and Winston Churchill; Neville Cardus admitted to inventing some himself. Among the Beecham lines that are reliably attributed are, [...] "A musicologist is a man who can read music but can't hear it"; his maxim, [...] "There are only two things requisite so far as the public is concerned for a good performance: that is for the orchestra to begin together and end together; in between it doesn't matter much"; and his remark at his 70th birthday celebrations after telegrams were read out from Strauss, Stravinsky and Sibelius: [...] "Nothing from Mozart?" ...|$|E

2500|$|When Sylvia Pankhurst {{was arrested}} under the Defence of the Realm Act for {{publishing}} articles [...] "calculated {{and likely to}} cause sedition among His Majesty's forces, in the Navy, and among the civilian population," [...] McKay had his rooms searched. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have been the author of [...] "The Yellow Peril and the Dockers" [...] attributed to [...] "Leon Lopez", {{which was one of}} the articles cited by the government in its case against Workers' Dreadnought.|$|E

2500|$|John the Rhaiktor ( [...] ; [...] ) was a Byzantine official, {{who served}} as the chief {{minister}} (paradynasteuon) of the empire in the early reign of Romanos I Lekapenos. Facing accusations, he left his office and retired to a monastery, but remained a confidante of the emperor, for whom he undertook a delicate diplomatic mission to Bulgaria in 929. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be identified as one of the conspirators who in 947 intended to depose Constantine VII and restore Romanos I's son Stephen Lekapenos to the throne.|$|E
2500|$|The Wisden end of series report stated: [...] "Excellent {{in style}} and a {{powerful}} driver, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> make a great mark before he is much older". In 1912/13 Taylor captained Natal as they won the Currie Cup. He started his captaincy career with a match against Transvaal, in the second innings of which he scored an unbeaten 250 in 225 minutes, out of a score of 384/5 declared. Only one other player [...] passed fifty in the match. This score remained the highest of his first-class career.|$|E
2500|$|James {{initially}} {{had difficulty}} finding a publisher, {{according to his}} widow Selma James, but on its publication by Hutchinson Beyond a Boundary was well received, and John Arlott wrote in Wisden:"1963 {{has been marked by}} the publication of a cricket book so outstanding as to compel any reviewer to check his adjectives several times before he describes it and, since <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be dealing in superlatives, to measure them carefully to avoid over-praise – which this book does not need … in the opinion of the reviewer, it is the finest book written about the game of cricket." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 392 {{he became}} emperor {{of the whole}} empire (the last one to be so). From this moment {{until the end of}} his reign in 395, while pagans {{remained}} outspoken in their demands for toleration, he authorized or participated in the destruction of many temples, holy sites, images and objects of piety throughout the empire in actions by Christians against major pagan sites. [...] He issued a comprehensive law that prohibited any public pagan ritual, and was particularly oppressive of Manicheans. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have suppressed the Ancient Olympic Games, whose last record of celebration is from 393.|$|E
2500|$|By 1610, however, Owen McHugh had {{effectively}} been sidelined by {{his cousin}} as {{master of the}} Fews {{and leader of the}} O'Neill of the Fews. For the son of a former chief of the Fews and holder of his families domains at Toaghie, the townlands of Aughanduff and Maphoner were something of a poor consolation but his grant reflected his status at the time. Indeed, Chichester wrote in 1608 as the plantation was being contemplated that [...] "In the settlement of this country and that of Tyrone wishes that some may be taken of Owyne More O’Neale, more for his honest simplicity than for any harm <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> do" ...|$|E
2500|$|Moore {{has earned}} {{significant}} national attention and controversy over his strongly anti-homosexual, anti-Muslim, and far-right views, {{his belief that}} Christianity should order public policy,, {{as well as his}} past ties to neo-Confederates and white nationalist groups. According to Vox, if Moore is elected, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be the most far-right Senator, [...] "far afield from even the most conservative Republican currently in the Senate." [...] Moore was also a leading voice in the anti-Obama birther movement, which promoted the debunked conspiracy theory that former President Barack Obama was not born in the United States, instead being born in Kenya. Moore had also argued that Obama was a secret Muslim.|$|E
