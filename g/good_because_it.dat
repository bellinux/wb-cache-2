25|$|Giving (Dāna) {{is seen as}} the {{beginning}} of virtue in Theravada Buddhism and as the basis for developing further on the path. In Buddhist countries, this is seen in the giving of alms to Buddhist monastics but also extends to generosity in general (towards family, friends, coworkers, guests, animals). Giving is said to make one happy, generate good merit as well as develop non-attachment, therefore it is not just <b>good</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> creates good karmic fruits, but it also develops one's spiritual qualities. In Buddhist thought, the cultivation of dana and ethical conduct will themselves refine consciousness to such a level that rebirth in one of the lower hells is unlikely, even if there is no further Buddhist practice. There is nothing improper or un-Buddhist about limiting one's aims to this level of attainment.|$|E
25|$|Halfway to Sanity is {{the tenth}} studio album by American punk band the Ramones. It was {{released}} on September 15, 1987 by Sire Records and was produced by Daniel Rey. Recording sessions began in April 1987 at Intergalactic Studios in New York City, and the band began recording instruments before vocals as a method to learn songs more quickly. Band members tended to disagree on many things at this time, and Rey described them to be impatient. The album's front cover was shot by previous Ramones' photographer George DuBose in Chinatown, New York City. The short lasted session resulted in a dimly lit album cover which guitarist Johnny Ramone said was <b>good</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> helped make them look younger. The band toured around the world following the album's release, but certain show dates were cancelled after drummer Richie Ramone left the band due to financial conflicts with the band. Clem Burke of Blondie was hired as Elvis Ramone to fill the drummer's spot for two shows, then was replaced the band's ex-member Marky Ramone, and the tour would continue with him.|$|E
500|$|The tale {{is about}} {{undesirable}} elements of society. Warne objected to Potter's opening paragraph: [...] "I am quite tired of making goody goody books about nice people. I {{will make a}} book about two disagreeable people, called Tommy Brock and Mr. Tod." [...] He altered the text to read, [...] "I have made many books about well-behaved people." [...] Potter responded:If it were not impertinent to lecture one's publisher—you are a great deal too much afraid of the public, for whom I have never cared one tuppenny-button. [...] I have always thought the opening paragraph distinctly <b>good,</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> gets away from [...] "once upon a time".|$|E

The designer talked {{of what was to}} happen to the dress after the awards show, [...] "The dress will be put in an archive with all of her dresses. The Gaga Archives, I suppose. It won't last, that's the beauty of it. When it is brought out again, hopefully it will be in a retrospective, {{and it will be a}} different dress, which is the best thing. I like the idea of it changing and evolving into something else". He later explained that the dress would be preserved and made into a type of jerky before being archived.|$|E
500|$|New Age religiosity is {{typified by}} its eclecticism. Generally believing {{that there is}} no one true way to pursue spirituality, New Agers develop their own worldview [...] "by {{combining}} bits and pieces to form their own individual mix", seeking what Drury called [...] "a spirituality without borders or confining dogmas". The anthropologist David J. Hess noted that in his experience, a common attitude among New Agers was that [...] "any alternative spiritual path is <b>good</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is spiritual and alternative". This approach that has generated a common jibe that New Age represents [...] "supermarket spirituality". York suggested that this eclecticism stemmed from the New Age's origins within late modern capitalism, with New Agers subscribing to a belief in a free market of spiritual ideas as a parallel to a free market in economics.|$|E
500|$|Manga Sanctuary {{praised the}} protagonist for being {{original}} and unique. It criticized {{the fact that}} the reader does not have access to some facts that could help to solve the mysteries. The reviewer said it is unfortunate because the readers feels passive, which is not desirable in a crime series. However, Manga News said that this impassivity is <b>good</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is what differentiates Neuro from Case Closed. Its design, setting, the [...] "interesting and well-constructed characters", and the development of the relationship between Neuro and Yako were also praised. The reviewer said the series is [...] "completely apart in the world of manga, Neuro is a genre unto itself which is between several styles and therefore appeal to a wider audience." [...] Animelands critic also compared it to Case Closed, but said its black humor, cruel and deadpan laughs were [...] "quite caustic." ...|$|E

The essence of camp is its love of the unnatural: of artifice and exaggeration. Camp sees everything in quotation marks.

500|$|Ryan Litsey {{described}} the Joker {{as an example}} of a [...] "Nietzschean Superman", arguing that a fundamental aspect of Friedrich Nietzsche's Superman, the [...] "will to power", is exemplified in all of the Joker's actions, providing a master morality to Batman's slave morality. The character's indomitable [...] "will to power" [...] means he is never discouraged by being caught or defeated and he is not restrained by guilt or remorse. Joker represents the master, who creates rules and defines them, who judges others without needing approval, and for whom something is <b>good</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> benefits him. He creates his own morality and is bound only by his own rules without aspiring to something higher than himself, unlike Batman, the slave, who makes a distinction between good and evil, and is bound to rules outside of himself (such as his avoidance of killing), in his quest for justice. The Joker has no defined origin story that requires him to question how he came to be, as like the Superman he does not regret or assess the past and only moves forward.|$|E
500|$|Code: Veronica {{producer}} Shinji Mikami said [...] "Claire {{became a}} lot tougher than I Imagined. I thought she should look the same, but the game director made her that way because she had such an experience in Resident Evil 2, she could handle any situation now!" [...] For Revelations 2, the now hardened and aggressive Claire was redesigned to be a contrasting character to the young, immature and easily scared Moira Burton, who {{was defined as a}} purely supporting character, and they both serve different roles in the story and have different functions. Producer Michiteru Okabe said: [...] "Really, only after did we look back and say, 'Oh, I guess they are both girls.' Which is <b>good,</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> means we’re treating them as whole characters and not just as their gender. What we settled on is the idea that you have different roles -- it isn’t two against the world, it’s one against the world with a helper." [...] Okabe also said the game's writer Dai Satō [...] "is a big fan of her personally" [...] {{which was one of the}} factors that led to Claire's return.|$|E
500|$|Ruck had {{previously}} auditioned for the Bender role in The Breakfast Club which went to Judd Nelson, but Hughes remembered Ruck and cast {{him as the}} 17-year-old Cameron Frye. According to Hughes, the character of Cameron was largely based on {{a friend of his}} in high school. [...] "He was sort of a lost person. His family neglected him, so he took that as license to really pamper himself. When he was legitimately sick, he actually felt <b>good,</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was difficult and tiring to have to invent diseases but when he actually had something, he was relaxed." [...] Ruck said the role of Cameron had originally been offered to Emilio Estevez who turned it down. [...] "Every time I see Emilio, I want to kiss him", said Ruck. [...] "Thank you!" [...] Ruck, then 29, worried about the age difference. [...] "I was worried that I'd be 10 years out of step, and I wouldn't know anything about what was cool, what was hip, all that junk. But when I was going to high school, I didn't know any of that stuff then, either. So I just thought, well, hell—I'll just be me. The character, he's such a loner that he really wouldn't give a damn about that stuff anyway. He'd feel guilty that he didn't know it, but that's it." [...] Ruck was not surprised to find himself cast young. [...] "No, because, really, when I was 18, I sort of looked 12", he said. [...] "Maybe it's a genetic imbalance." ...|$|E

2500|$|Aquinas affirms Aristotle's {{definition}} of happiness as [...] "an operation according to perfect virtue", and that [...] "happiness is called man's supreme <b>good,</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is the attainment or {{enjoyment of the}} supreme good." [...] Regarding what the virtues are, Aquinas ascertained the cardinal virtues to be prudence, temperance, justice, and fortitude. The cardinal virtues are natural and revealed in nature, and they are binding on everyone. There are, however, three theological virtues: faith, hope, and charity (which is used interchangeably with love {{in the sense of}} agape). These are supernatural and are distinct from other virtues in their object, namely, God.|$|E
2500|$|American Catholic writer Flannery O'Connor {{illustrated}} the sacramental {{understanding of the}} world in her work [...] "Novelist and Believer":St. Augustine wrote that the things of the world pour forth from God in a double way: intellectually into the minds of the angels and physically into the world of things. To the person who believes this – as the western world did up until a few centuries ago – this physical, sensible world is <b>good</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> proceeds from a divine source ... When [...] Conrad said that his aim as an artist was to render the highest possible justice to the visible universe, he was speaking with the novelist's surest instinct. The artist penetrates the concrete world in order to find at its depths the image of its source, the image of ultimate reality.|$|E
40|$|Digital piracy, {{although}} negatively {{altering the}} recorded music market, {{has a positive}} impact on other segments of the music market, such as live music or ancillary <b>goods,</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> generates a positive externality benefiting those activities. Through a 2 -player strategic game between a record company and an artist, this study shows that a renegotiation of music contracts could allow the internalizing of this positive externality, while being welfare-improving for both record companies and artists. This study also shows, however, that pervasive piracy is not desirable for an artist. ...|$|R

2500|$|This {{is perhaps}} why Camp often faces {{criticism}} from other political and aesthetic perspectives. For example, {{the most obvious}} argument is that camp is just an excuse for poor quality work and allows the tacky and vulgar {{to be recognized as}} valid art. In doing so, camp celebrates the trivial and superficial and form over content. This could be called the [...] "yuck factor". The power of the camp object may be found in its ability to induce this reaction. In a sense objects that fill their beholders with disgust fulfill Sontag's definition of the ultimate camp statement, “it's <b>good</b> <b>because</b> <b>it's</b> awful.” ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{his review}} for the DVD Talk, Paul Mavis {{positively}} {{reacted to the}} episode. He said [...] "'Dunces & Dragons' puts a new spin on the old A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court theme and it's fun {{to see how the}} show's writers have adapted the characters from the show into this medieval setting." [...] He added [...] "This episode is also <b>good</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> shows an abnormally self-confident SpongeBob. I can't fathom (get it?) why fans of the show wouldn't like these new episodes, because they certainly haven't lost their silliness ... or their occasional edge ... Fans of SpongeBob SquarePants will find something to love in this set, if for no other reason, because it brings back many familiar supporting characters and features SpongeBob at what he does best: making us laugh." ...|$|E
2500|$|Anna (Elizabeth Lail) {{arrives at}} Rumplestiltskin's (Robert Carlyle) tower {{and talks to}} him about the {{disappearance}} of her parents. Rumplestiltskin offers to help if she puts the contents of a vial into the Apprentice's drink telling her that he is an evil man. Anna states that she will do [...] "whatever it takes" [...] to find out why her parents visited The Enchanted Forest and Rumplestiltskin comments that he loves when people say they will do whatever it takes. Anna goes to the man's house and after a brief conversation she has a chance to put the vial's contents into his tea but instead decides to throw them into the fire thinking that it is poison. Anna arrives back at Rumplestiltskin's tower and informs him that she gave the contents of the vial to the Apprentice. Mr. Gold says that is <b>good</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is an antidote to a poison he was given yesterday. Anna, horrified by this, tells Rumplestiltskin the truth and says they must go back to the cottage. They look in Rumplestiltskin's crystal ball and see the man succumbing to the poison by turning into a mouse.|$|E
