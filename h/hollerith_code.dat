5000|$|By convention, buffers are {{preceded by}} a word count. The [...] assembles a count word and the {{following}} [...] reserves the required number of words for the buffer. The card buffer requires 80 words, one for each card column. Driver CARD0 reads each card column literally, using 12 of the 16 bits in the buffer word to describe {{whether there is a}} punch in the corresponding row for that column. The pattern of punches typically describes a text character using the <b>Hollerith</b> <b>code.</b> The console keyboard also gives input to the program in the <b>Hollerith</b> <b>code,</b> the only case of two devices using the same character encoding.|$|E
5000|$|This example {{contains}} no code {{to decide when}} to stop. A more complete program would check for cards that begin with , which denotes {{the start of the}} next job. To stop the card reader as soon as possible, a program could check for the <b>Hollerith</b> <b>code</b> of [...] before even converting the card to EBCDIC.|$|E

Defines ISO 7-bit and 8-bit character sets on punched cards {{as well as}} the representation of 7-bit and 8-bit combinations on 12-row punched cards. Derived from, and compatible with, the <b>Hollerith</b> <b>Code,</b> ensuring compatibility with existing punched card files.|$|E

5000|$|In 1931 IBM began {{introducing}} multiple punches for upper-case {{letters and}} special characters. A letter has two punches (zone 12,11,0 + digit 1-9); most special characters {{have two or}} three punches (zone none + digit 2-7 + 8); a few special characters were exceptions (in EBCDIC [...] "&" [...] is 12 only, [...] "-" [...] is 11 only, and [...] "/" [...] is 0 + 1). With these changes, the information represented in a column by a combination of zones 11 and digits 1-9 is dependent on the use of that column. For example, the combination [...] "12-1" [...] is the letter [...] "A" [...] in an alphabetic column, a plus signed digit [...] "1" [...] in a signed numeric column, or an unsigned digit [...] "1" [...] in a column where the [...] "12" [...] have some other use. The introduction of EBCDIC in 1964 allowed columns with as many as six punches (zones 12,11,0,8,9 + digit 1-7). IBM and other manufacturers used many different 80-column card character encodings. A 1969 American National Standard defined the punches for 128 characters and was named the <b>Hollerith</b> Punched Card <b>Code</b> (often referred to simply as <b>Hollerith</b> Card <b>Code),</b> honoring <b>Hollerith.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A signed {{overpunch}} is a code used {{to store}} {{the sign of a}} number by changing the last digit. It is used in COBOL, especially when using EBCDIC. Its purpose is to save a character that would otherwise be used by the sign digit. [...] The code is derived from the <b>Hollerith</b> Punched Card <b>Code,</b> where both a digit and a sign can be entered in the same card column.|$|R
50|$|The Potter Instrument Company of Great Neck, New York {{developed}} a photoelectric tag reader. The reader scanned 100 tags per minute. A lens system enlarged {{the image of}} a tag's holes projected by a gas-type photoflash tube onto an array of phototubes. The phototubes fired thyratrons that activated relay logic to translate the tag's coded digits into <b>Hollerith</b> <b>code</b> and punch a standard sized punched card.|$|E
50|$|The {{punched card}} acted as an {{insulator}} and an electrical contact was only {{completed in the}} presence of a punched hole. A control panel controlled what function was to be performed by directing the impulse to a series of ‘wire contact relays’ with the impulses de-coded according to the <b>Hollerith</b> <b>code.</b> (Mark Sense could not provide the current needed to ‘pick’ a wire contact relay and so needed vacuum tubes to amplify the current). After the card was read, a ‘Card Gate’ moved into the card path to stop the card for printing on the correct horizontal line.|$|E
40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} by which large quantities of data, generated at high and variable rates from {{a large number of}} test boxes, are recorded on a single eight-channel punched paper tape. The data, which include a record of the occurrence time of each event in 1 / 10 -sec units, are in a compact form, suitable for conversion to standard <b>Hollerith</b> punched card <b>codes</b> and for decoding and summarizing by a large digital computer. Experience with the system has demonstrated a high degree of accuracy and reliability, and low operating cost...|$|R
