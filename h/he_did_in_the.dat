5|$|In the {{off-season}} Shero {{decided that the}} team would be more successful if he coached them like he had coached his minor league teams. Upon being elevated to the NHL, he {{had decided not to}} employ systems like <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> minors, stating that he had too much respect for NHL players. However, he decided that since he had the same kind of players on the Flyers as <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> minors, he would use the same systems, becoming the first coach to employ systems.|$|E
5|$|Kenny is a third, later fourth-grade {{student who}} {{commonly}} has extraordinary experiences not typical of conventional small-town {{life in his}} hometown of South Park, Colorado, where he lives with his poverty-stricken family. Kenny is animated by computer to look as <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> show's original method of cutout animation. He also appears in the 1999 full-length feature film , in which his true appearance and voice was first revealed, and various South Park merchandise.|$|E
5|$|Some conversations, due {{to their}} private nature, were fictionalized; Ottaviani makes up Marsh's lobby to Congress and what {{happened}} during his meeting with President Grant, and P.T. Barnum never told off Marsh the way <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> novel. Ottaviani also wove the story Marsh tells about the Mastodon from several {{different versions of the}} legend.|$|E

5|$|In 1905, Alberta Lieutenant Governor George Bulyea asked Rutherford to {{form the}} new province's first government. As premier, his first task was to win a {{workable}} majority in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta, which <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1905 provincial election. His second was to provide the apparatus of provincial government: his government established everything from speed limits to a provincial court system. The legislature also controversially, and with Rutherford's support, selected Edmonton over rival Calgary as the provincial capital. Calgarians' bruised feelings were not salved when the government located the University of Alberta, a project dear to the Premier's heart, {{in his hometown of}} Strathcona, just across the North Saskatchewan River from Edmonton.|$|E
5|$|Jeff Reed {{concluded}} the first drive of Super Bowl XLIII with a field goal—giving the Steelers a 3–0 lead over the Arizona Cardinals. Gary Russell {{scored on a}} 1-yard touchdown rush on the Steelers' second drive and the Cardinals responded by scoring a touchdown on the ensuing drive. On the final play {{of the first half}} James Harrison intercepted a pass from Kurt Warner and returned it 100yards for a touchdown. As <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first quarter, Reed scored the sole points of the third quarter giving the Steelers a 20–7 lead entering the final quarter.|$|E
5|$|Much of what <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Senate can be {{described}} as the typical sponsorship of legislation that would benefit his state. With his sponsorship, the Senate passed a bill that would aid railroads in Florida, and another that would sell off some of the live oak reservations maintained by the Federal government for the Navy; both bills failed in the House of Representatives. He was more successful with bills aimed at prosecuting the ongoing campaign against the Seminole Indians, although the problem seems to have been overstated. His bills would provide compensation for persons who had suffered from the depredations of Indian raids, and would further the process of removing the aborigines from the state. He also introduced bills that provided for marine hospitals in port cities in Florida. None of this would have been considered exceptional for the era.|$|E

5|$|Rupert Murdoch {{announced}} in early February 2007 that Baron Cohen had {{signed on to}} do another Borat film with Fox. However, this was contradicted by an interview with Baron Cohen himself in which Baron Cohen stated that Borat was to be discontinued, as he was now too well known to avoid detection as <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film and on Da Ali G Show. A spokesman for Fox later stated {{that it was too}} early to begin planning such a film, although they were open to the idea.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{survived the}} last 15 {{minutes on the}} first evening to reach stumps on 0/17, with Morris on 10. Barnes and Morris took the score to 73 before the latter was bowled by Jim Laker's off spin for 31. Barnes batted confidently, while the {{hesitant}} Morris shuffled around the crease. At one stage, Morris scored only seven runs in 55 minutes, During this period, Morris unnecessarily played at a ball outside off stump from seamer Alec Bedser and edged it to wicket-keeper Evans, who dropped the catch. He recomposed himself and hit left arm orthodox spinner Jack Young's first ball—a full toss—for runs as Australia passed 50 without loss. Morris fell {{when he tried to}} force a ball from Laker away, but hit it from the middle of his bat into his back pad; the ball rebounded onto the stumps. Australia went on to amass 509, and when England batted again, they lost their third wicket at 150. Joe Hardstaff junior came in, and on the third ball he aimed a cut that went low to second slip, just as <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first innings. However, Morris dropped the catch. Hardstaff exploited his second chance to make 43 before falling at 4/243.|$|E
5|$|Robert Dudley was {{a pioneer}} of new industries; {{interested}} in many things from tapestries to mining, he was engaged in the first joint stock companies in English history. The Earl also concerned himself with relieving unemployment among the poor. On a personal level, he gave to poor people, petitioners, and prisons on a daily basis. Due to his interests in trade and exploration, {{as well as his}} debts, his contacts with the London city fathers were intense. He was an enthusiastic investor in the Muscovy Company and the Merchant Adventurers. English relations with Morocco were also handled by Leicester. This <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> manner of his private business affairs, underpinned by a patriotic and missionary zeal (commercially, these relations were loss-making). He took much interest in the careers of John Hawkins and Francis Drake from early on, and was a principal backer of Drake's circumnavigation of the world. Robert and Ambrose Dudley were also the principal patrons of Martin Frobisher's 1576 search for the Northwest Passage. Later Leicester acquired his own ship, the Galleon Leicester, which he employed in a luckless expedition under Edward Fenton, but also under Drake. As much as profit, English seapower was on his mind, and accordingly Leicester became a friend and leading supporter of Dom António, the exiled claimant to the Portuguese throne after 1580.|$|E

However following appeals to the Supreme Court of Canada in May 1919 and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (22 March 1920), both ships were found to have made navigational errors and were found equally at fault for the collision and its consequences.|$|E
