50|$|The Bass Excursions were {{a series}} of works outings laid on for the entire {{workforce}} of the Burton-on-Trent brewing firm of Bass, Ratcliff & Gretton. They took place every summer, and ran from the 1860s until 1914. The last one, to Scarborough, took place just weeks before {{the outbreak of the}} First World War. The excursions, which were originally just for workers, quickly expanded to include wives and children, along with managers and suppliers. So many townspeople were included that, on the day, the town's population of 50,000 was reduced by nearly a fifth. Workers travelled free - with family members at a greatly reduced rate - and were given their day's wages, plus extra pocket money of a half crown to a guinea, depending on their status. Once there, production of their <b>excursion</b> <b>ticket</b> allowed the free entrance to all the resort's attractions.|$|E

5000|$|Mrs Thompson {{slipped on}} a ramp while {{disembarking}} a train at 10pm, from Manchester to Darwen, and was injured. The train had pulled up {{just past the}} platform, and so the ramp she stepped out on was slippery. A special jury found the railway to have been negligent, and so Mrs Thompson sought damages for personal injury. She had been given an <b>excursion</b> <b>ticket</b> by her niece, which said ‘Excursion. For conditions see back’ which in turn referred to the Railway’s timetables and excursion bills. The timetables could be bought for sixpence said the tickets were issued on condition that holders ‘shall have no rights of action against the company .... in respect of .... injury (fatal or otherwise) .... however caused.’ A jury found {{that the company had}} not taken reasonable steps to bring the conditions to the notice of Mrs Thompson and awarded damages. But then the judge, as a matter of law, held that when the ticket was accepted the contract was complete, and so the jury was not entitled to find as they did. Mrs Thompson could not read.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the railways in the mid-19th century made the Lake District, and Keswick in particular, more accessible to visitors of modest means. The original impetus for building the Cockermouth, Keswick and Penrith Railway (CKP) line came from heavy industry: the new Bessemer process of steelmaking brought a great demand for the rich iron ore from west Cumberland and the coking coal from Durham {{on the east side}} of the country. The CKP was built to enable ore and coal to be brought together at steel foundries in both counties. The line opened for goods traffic in 1864, and the following year it began to carry passengers. Fares varied, but holidaymakers could buy <b>excursion</b> <b>tickets</b> at discounted prices, such as six shillings for the 170-mile return journey from Preston to Keswick.|$|R

Townsville Show competition categories were either [...] "District" [...] or [...] "Local". District events embraced any area North of the 24th parallel (approximately Gladstone) and {{west to the}} Queensland border. Local entries were drawn from Townsville, Thuringowa, Ayr, Dalrymple, Charters Towers and Hinchinbrook. The Railway Department continued to provide free livestock exhibit freightage for Show exhibits from and between local and regional show centres and for Show champions to the RNA. <b>Excursion</b> <b>tickets</b> were available for outlying towns and this practice continued into the 1970s. Road freightage was subsidized under The State Transport Act 1960 for the movement of livestock, machinery and produce {{to and from the}} Show.|$|R
5000|$|The {{gas fire}} {{continued}} to burn for 45 days. The Brisbane Courier {{reported that the}} resumption of boring had begun on or about 15 December. News of this sensation spread throughout Australia and caused a tourism boom in Roma, as people came far and wide to marvel at the fire, to see this [...] "Wonderful Outburst of Nature". One report states that visitors came {{from as far away}} as New Zealand. Roma Town Council asked the Railway Department to run special excursion trains. An article published in The Western Star suggests there was a bit of controversy, when over 250 people from Charleville wanted to purchase <b>excursion</b> <b>tickets</b> to Roma. Many thought the tickets would cost between 12 shillings and six pence to 15 shillings, but were [...] "disappointed" [...] to find out they were £1.|$|R
50|$|Unlike other State Transit Authority run buses, Newcastle Buses & Ferries {{historically}} used a time-based {{ticketing system}} which was {{separate from the}} MyZone ticketing system. Single tickets could be purchased for one, four or 23 hours, or a TimeTen ticket Multiride which equated to ten one hour tickets. Other than the 23-hour ticket, time-based tickets {{could not be used}} on the ferry. Newcastle Buses & Ferries also accepted, but did not sell, TravelPass, MyMulti, and <b>Excursion</b> <b>tickets</b> from the MyZone system, but not MyBus or TravelTen. As part of the Opal card rollout, 11 types of tickets including the 23 hours tickets were withdrawn on 20 November 2014. With Opal fares the time-based ticketing system ceased. From 1 January 2016 the 1 hour ticket was the only non Opal ticket available for use on Newcastle Buses. Paper tickets were withdrawn on 1 August 2016.|$|R
500|$|A {{professional}} architect {{was hired}} to design the Mountain Grove Campground. Major financial contributors to the campground included a Colonel Jackson from Berwick and the Low family from Lime Ridge. It was under the [...] of the Pennsylvania Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church's Danville District. The campground was initially laid out hurriedly, being constructed {{in less than two}} months. It opened {{for the first time on}} August 14, 1872. By this point, approximately 70 small and hastily constructed cottages (referred to as tents) had been built. Between the 1872 camp meeting season and the 1873 camp meeting season, the buildings of the campground were significantly renovated. Three more acres and a hotel were also added to the campground during this time, on land bought from George W. Klase. The purpose of the purchase was to stop the sale of alcoholic drinks within two miles of the campground. Between 1873 and 1874, further additions were made to the campground. In 1875, a special train started to run past the campground three times a week during the camp meeting season. By 1881, the special train ran past the campground once per day. In 1884, the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Philadelphia and Reading Railway began selling special fair <b>excursion</b> <b>tickets</b> for the campground. The campground was extended to 34 acres by 1885. The Lehigh Valley Railroad began doing so as well in 1887.|$|R

5000|$|In May 1895, Sir James Ramsden, by now 73, {{resigned}} due to ill-health. He was not replaced {{as managing}} director. A new general manager (Alfred Aslett) was {{recruited from the}} Cambrian Railways, where he had 'worked wonders ... from {{being one of the}} most sluggish it {{has become one of the}} most enterprising lines in the kingdom' The incumbent 'secretary and general manager' became 'secretary' only (his assistant (Ramsden's son) became 'superintendent of the line') before retiring in 1897 after thirty-three years in the post; the locomotive superintendent retired at the same time after forty-six years with the company.The new regime benefited from a recovery in the Furness iron and steel trade, and from a wholesale replacement of passenger rolling stock occasioned by the need to provide a continuous automatic brake, but also made strenuous efforts to develop passenger traffic, with day and weekend <b>excursion</b> <b>tickets</b> being introduced and advertised. Second class was abolished (1897) and new corridor bogie carriages introduced on Barrow-Yorkshire services were as good as anything to be found on major railways. To promote tourist traffic, the FR published guides to tours in the Lake District not only in English, but also in French and German. By 1903, passenger revenue was 40% higher than that for 1895, and passenger revenue per train-mile was tenpence (10d.) higher. The Railway Magazine of August 1898 described the Furness Railway as one [...] "which, though a comparatively small line, is noted for its enterprise and go-ahead management."; by the second half of 1899 the dividend had recovered to 4% per annum, [...] "entirely due to the ability an exertions of their excellent general manager" [...] according to the company chairman. The dividend, however fell back to ½% in 1904 because of a renewed depression in iron and steel; Mr Aslett having previously reported that pig iron could only be produced in Furness at a loss of 3s/6d per ton: England was the 'dumping ground' for German iron being sold at below its production cost. Vickers had taken over the Barrow Shipbuilding Company in 1897, and its construction of naval warships at Barrow (both as part of the Anglo-German naval arms race and for foreign navies) became an important prop of the prosperity of Barrow. Even with this prop, and the development of tourist traffic, the FR dividend for the last twenty-five years of its existence (up to grouping in 1923) averaged only marginally above 2% a year.|$|R
