5|$|<b>Dead</b> <b>trees</b> pose {{a safety}} risk, {{especially}} during high winds and severe storms, and removing <b>dead</b> <b>trees</b> involves a financial burden, whereas {{the presence of}} healthy trees can clean the air, increase property values, and reduce {{the temperature of the}} built environment and thereby reduce building cooling costs. During times of drought, trees can fall into water stress, which may cause a tree to become more susceptible to disease and insect problems, and ultimately may lead to a tree's death. Irrigating trees during dry periods can reduce the risk of water stress and death. Irrigation can be accomplished by use of a garden hose, soaker hose, sprinkler, or modified five-gallon bucket.|$|E
5|$|The Cuban iguana {{makes its}} burrow near cacti or thistles, {{sometimes}} {{even within the}} cactus itself. These thorny plants offer protection and their fruit and flowers offer the iguanas food. In areas without cacti, the lizards make their burrows in <b>dead</b> <b>trees,</b> hollow logs, and limestone crevices.|$|E
5|$|Mutualism is {{well known}} in a few beetles, such as the ambrosia beetle, which {{partners}} with fungi to digest the wood of <b>dead</b> <b>trees.</b> The beetles excavate tunnels in <b>dead</b> <b>trees</b> in which they cultivate fungal gardens, their sole source of nutrition. After landing on a suitable tree, an ambrosia beetle excavates a tunnel in which it releases spores of its fungal symbiont. The fungus penetrates the plant's xylem tissue, digests it, and concentrates the nutrients on and near the surface of the beetle gallery, so the weevils and the fungus both benefit. The beetles cannot eat the wood due to toxins, and uses its relationship with fungi to help overcome the defenses of its host tree in order to provide nutrition for their larvae. Chemically mediated by a bacterially produced polyunsaturated peroxide, this mutualistic relationship between the beetle and the fungus is coevolved.|$|E

I mean he couldn't tell from the ground.|$|R

5|$|The call of {{the great}} spotted {{woodpecker}} is a sharp kik, which may be repeated as a wooden rattling krrarraarr if the bird is disturbed. The courtship call, gwig, is mostly given in the display flight. The great spotted woodpecker drums on <b>dead</b> <b>trees</b> and branches, and sometimes suitable man-made structures, to maintain contact between paired adults and to advertise ownership of territory.|$|E
5|$|Freshmen were {{expected}} to build the early Bonfires to help prove their worth. For almost two decades, the students constructed Bonfire from debris and wood acquired through various, sometimes illicit, means, including appropriating lumber intended for a dormitory in 1912. In 1935, a farmer reported that students carried off his entire barn as fuel for Bonfire. To prevent future incidents, the university made Bonfire a school-sanctioned event. The following year, for the first time, the school provided axes, saws, and trucks for the students and pointed them toward a grove of <b>dead</b> <b>trees</b> {{on the edge of}} town.|$|E
5|$|The great spotted {{woodpecker}} {{occurs in}} all types of woodlands and is catholic in its diet, being capable of extracting seeds from pine cones, insect larvae from inside trees or eggs and chicks of other birds from their nests. It breeds in holes excavated in living or <b>dead</b> <b>trees,</b> unlined apart from wood chips. The typical clutch is four to six glossy white eggs. Both parents incubate the eggs, feed the chicks and keep the nest clean. When the young fledge they are fed by the adults for about ten days, each parent taking responsibility for feeding part of the brood.|$|E

5|$|The greater yellow-headed vulture roosts on high, exposed <b>dead</b> <b>trees</b> {{to observe}} {{surrounding}} terrain. When flying, it travels in pairs or alone and is rarely found in groups. Flight is heavy and steady. It flies with its wings held flat or very slightly above horizontal, {{in what is}} called the dihedral position. The flight of the greater yellow-headed is an example of static soaring flight, which uses thermals to maintain altitude without the need to flap its wings.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of woodpecker species {{live up to}} their name and feed on insects and other invertebrates living under bark and in wood, but overall the family is characterized by its dietary flexibility, with many species being both highly omnivorous and opportunistic. The diet includes ants, termites, beetles and their larvae, caterpillars, spiders, other arthropods, bird eggs, nestlings, small rodents, lizards, fruit, nuts and sap. Many insects and their grubs are taken from living and <b>dead</b> <b>trees</b> by excavation. The bird may hear sounds from inside the timber indicating where it will be productive to create a hole.|$|E
5|$|The {{removal of}} <b>dead</b> <b>trees</b> from forests may cause {{problems}} locally for this species {{because it requires}} cavity sites for nesting; declines have been noted in Washington, Florida, and more widely in the southeastern U.S. west to Texas. In contrast, the breeding range is expanding in Alberta, and numbers are increasing in the northeast due to regrown forest. This nuthatch is protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, to which the three countries in which it occurs (Canada, Mexico, and the United States) are all signatories.|$|E

5|$|Cases of {{sick and}} dying trees of C.australis were first {{reported}} {{in the northern part}} of the North Island in 1987. The syndrome, eventually called Sudden Decline, soon reached epidemic proportions in Northland and Auckland. Affected trees usually suffer total defoliation within 2 to 12 months. The foliage turns yellow, and the oldest leaves wither and fall off. Growth of leaves ceases, and eventually all the leaves fall, leaving dead branches, often with the dried-out flowering panicles still attached. At the same time, the bark on the trunk becomes loose and detaches easily. The greatest number of <b>dead</b> <b>trees</b> (18 to 26 percent) was recorded around Auckland.|$|E
5|$|Colder weather, {{bringing}} with it rain and snow on September 11 calmed the fires down substantially throughout the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Though the fires continued to burn {{well into the}} middle of November, they never again posed an immediate risk to life or property. Many fire crews were sent home, but additional manpower continued to arrive at Yellowstone to rehabilitate areas that had been affected by the firefighting efforts. Hundreds of miles of firelines, helicopter landing zones and fire camps needed to be restored to a more natural state, and thousands of hazardous <b>dead</b> <b>trees</b> needed to be cut down to protect roads and buildings. Finally, on November 18, all fires in Yellowstone were officially declared out.|$|E
5|$|It {{is usually}} a {{permanent}} resident throughout its range, although birds at the extreme north of its range may migrate short distances, and others across their range may undergo local movements in unfavourable conditions. In South America, its range stretches to central Chile and Argentina. It also is found as a vagrant on the islands of the Caribbean. It prefers open land interspersed with areas of woods or brush. It {{is also found in}} moist lowland forests, shrublands and grasslands, wetlands and swamps, pastures, and heavily degraded former forests. Preferring lowlands, it is rarely seen in mountainous areas. It is usually seen soaring or perched on fence posts or <b>dead</b> <b>trees.</b>|$|E

5|$|The most {{significant}} {{threat to the}} bristle-faced free-tailed bat {{is likely to be}} ongoing land clearing in semi-arid bioregions of Queensland and NSW. The eastern Australian Bioregions that comprise the core range of the bristle-faced free-tailed bat, particularly the Brigalow Belt (north and south), have been subjected to broad scale clearing and habitat modification since European settlement. Clearing of vegetation for agriculture and removal of hollow bearing trees for firewood collection and forestry are likely to reduce the availability of roosting sites for the bristle-faced free-tailed bat. Clearing of native vegetation and removal of dead wood and <b>dead</b> <b>trees</b> have been recognised as key threatening processes for the bristle-faced free-tailed bat in NSW.|$|E
5|$|Vikos-AoÃ¶s also {{contains}} a variety of suitable habitats that support dense populations of amphibians and reptiles. Vipera ursinii lives in the subalpine meadows and is considered a threatened taxon. The amphibian alpine newts (Triturus alpestris), living in the alpine lakes of the Tymfi region, mostly in Drakolimni, are associated with local folktales of dragons and dragon battles. Yellow-bellied toads (Bombina variegata) are also common in that same area. Numerous fish, such as brown trout, roach, and barbel {{are to be found}} in the park's rivers. Regarding invertebrate species, due to the structural complexity of the forests and the co-existence of various small biotopes, i.e. streams, ponds, forest openings, rocky sites, <b>dead</b> <b>trees,</b> old pollards, and coppices, a very diverse fauna exists. This occurs especially at the various ecotones, including often very specialized species.|$|E
5|$|Boise National Forest's 2010 forest plan {{recognizes that}} fire and other {{disturbances}} play {{important roles in}} maintaining the character and function of ecosystems. However, previous management strategies (as recently as the 1990 forest plan) treated fire as an undesirable process, and the Organic Act of 1897 explicitly stated that forests were {{to be protected from}} destruction by fire. In historic conditions fires naturally occurred on the landscape; the suppression of fires allowed <b>dead</b> <b>trees</b> to accumulate in excess of historic levels and land cover types to change, such as a shift to higher shrub and tree densities. An estimated 14 percent of the land in Boise National Forest has been affected by fires since the early 1990s, and about 10 percent of the land capable of timber production was burned so severely that land cover shifted from forest to grass and shrubland (as of 2010).|$|E

5|$|It soars high while {{searching for}} food, holding its wings {{horizontally}} when gliding. It flaps in short bursts which {{are followed by}} short periods of gliding. Its flight is less efficient than that of other vultures, as the wings are not as long, forming a smaller wing area. In comparison with the turkey vulture, the black vulture flaps its wings more frequently during flight. It is known to regurgitate when approached or disturbed, which assists in predator deterrence and taking flight by decreasing its takeoff weight. Like all New World vultures, the black vulture often defecates on its own legs, using the evaporation {{of the water in}} the feces and/or urine to cool itself, a process known as urohidrosis. It cools the blood vessels in the unfeathered tarsi and feet, and causes white uric acid to streak the legs. Because it lacks a syrinx, the black vulture, like other New World vultures, has very few vocalization capabilities. It is generally silent, but can make hisses and grunts when agitated or while feeding. The black vulture is , and roosts in large groups. In areas where their ranges overlap, the black vulture will roost on the bare branches of <b>dead</b> <b>trees</b> alongside groups of turkey vultures. The black vulture generally forages in groups; a flock of black vultures can easily drive a rival turkey vulture, which is generally solitary while foraging, from a carcass.|$|E
