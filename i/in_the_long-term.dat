When replacing a tooth with an implant, {{a band of}} strong, attached gingiva is {{needed to keep the}} implant healthy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>long-term.</b> This is especially important with implants because the blood supply is more precarious in the gingiva {{surrounding a}}n implant, and is theoretically more susceptible to injury because of a longer attachment to the implant than on a tooth (a longer biologic width).|$|E

5|$|Together {{with lines}} , R3, and R4, the R1 (then simply {{numbered}} line 1) started services in 1989 {{as one of}} the first lines of the Cercanías commuter rail system for Barcelona, known as Rodalies Barcelona. Originally, R1 services had two southern termini, L'Hospitalet de Llobregat and Barcelona–El Prat Airport stations. In 2005, all trains terminating at the airport moved their southern terminus to Molins de Rei. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>long-term</b> future, it is projected that the R1 will take over the southern section of line R2, creating a major north–south axis that will extend along the coast of the Barcelona metropolitan area.|$|E
5|$|Added to {{the state}} highway system in 1933, and defined in 1935, Route198 {{extended}} from US 80 onto La Mesa Boulevard and Palm Avenue to SR94 by 1938. In 1947, the San Diego County Highway Development Association requested that the highway from Sixth Avenue in Mission Valley to US 80 be constructed as a freeway. Although state senator Fred Kraft criticized the proposal in July 1953 because he believed {{that it would be}} too expensive and would not reduce congestion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>long-term,</b> especially around the junction with US 80 in Grossmont, approval for the Route 94 freeway extended to the junction with U.S. Route 80 (US80) by October, with the Grossmont part of the route signed as Route 67. The Route 67 freeway was completed in March 1957, from Campo Road and Route 94 to US 80; the project was completed for $1,625,000.|$|E
5|$|Following World War II, the communist-dominated Vietminh {{fought the}} French colonial forces {{in an attempt}} to gain Vietnamese independence. After the French defeat at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu in 1954, Vietnam was {{partitioned}} at the 17thparallel, pending national reunification elections in 1956. The elections were canceled, resulting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>long-term</b> existence of communist North Vietnam and anti-communist South Vietnam as separate states. In the late-1950s, South Vietnamese guerrillas known as the Viet Cong—covertly supported by North Vietnam—began an insurgency with the aim of forcefully reunifying the country under communist rule. With the Cold War at its height, the United States—the main backer of South Vietnam—sent military advisers into the country to help train and guide the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) in their fight against the Vietcong. By 1964, there were 23,000American military personnel in the country. The communists viewed the Americans as colonizers and the South Vietnamese as their puppets, and attacked both with force.|$|E

5|$|Within {{a week of}} the storm's passage, the Government of Thailand began distributing {{relief goods}} to {{residents}} throughout the affected provinces. Despite the effort by the government, 2,500 people from Pa Thiew and Tha Sae demonstrated for additional and more intensive aid on 9 November. These protests were soon dispersed. Following considerable criticism for downplaying {{the impact of the}} typhoon, Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan delayed his visit to the United States to oversee relief efforts. By 15 November the United States pledged to donate US$25,000 for recovery operations. Telephone connection was restored from Bangkok to Prachuap Khiri Khan by this time; however, areas further south remained disconnected. Generators were brought in to keep hospitals and government offices running since much of Chumphon Province remained without electricity for more than two weeks. As the scale of damage became more apparent, a request for international aid was made by 17 November to the United Nations Disaster Relief Organization. Upon the announcement of the request, six countries pledged to provide nearly US$510,000 in funds collectively. Agriculture across Surat Thani Province was severely affected by the typhoon <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>long-term</b> as well. In the four years following Typhoon Gay, land use for orchards, rubber, and oil palm plantations decreased from 33.32percent to 30.53percent. Additionally, rice paddy coverage decreased from 22.96percent to 13.03percent.|$|E
