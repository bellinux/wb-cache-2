2500|$|As {{children}} {{move forward}} with their reading skills, they {{learn a great deal}} about what is really inside a word; the stem, roots, prefixes and suffixes that make up morphemes of the language. [...] By this stage, children already know about the common bound morphemes such as [...] "s" [...] and [...] "ed" [...] because these are attached to many words. [...] Decoding readers become exposed to many types of morphemes such as prefixes and suffixes, and it is when they learn to read these as [...] "sight chunks" [...] that their reading and their understanding will speed up dramatically. Being able to read at a fluent level is not only about how fast a child can read, but {{it is a matter of}} being able to utilize all the special knowledge that they have about a word—its letters, letter patterns, meanings, grammatical functions, roots, and endings—fast enough that they have time to think and comprehend what they are seeing. [...] The point of becoming a proficient reader is to fluently read and comprehend what had just been read. Decoding readers are just beginning to understand and learn how to use their expanding knowledge of language and their growing powers of inference to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> are really reading.|$|E
2500|$|The vast {{majority}} of computer surveillance involves the monitoring of data and traffic on the Internet. In the United States for example, under the Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act, all phone calls and broadband Internet traffic (emails, web traffic, instant messaging, etc.) are required to be available for unimpeded real-time monitoring by Federal law enforcement agencies. Packet capture is the monitoring of data traffic on a computer network. Computers communicate over the Internet by breaking up messages (emails, images, videos, web pages, files, etc.) into small chunks called [...] "packets", which are routed through a network of computers, until they reach their destination, where they are assembled back into a complete [...] "message" [...] again. Packet Capture Appliance intercepts these packets as they are traveling through the network, {{in order to examine}} their contents using other programs. A packet capture is an information gathering tool, but not an analysis tool. That is it gathers [...] "messages" [...] but it does not analyze them and <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> mean. Other programs are needed to perform traffic analysis and sift through intercepted data looking for important/useful information. Under the Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act all U.S. telecommunications providers are required to install packet sniffing technology to allow Federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies to intercept all of their customers' broadband Internet and voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) traffic.|$|E

5000|$|RJ then {{asks the}} {{audience}} {{if they should}} tell him that the kids actually {{had a lot of}} boomerangs in a box. Verne then appears and <b>figures</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> are doing and throws the camera away and informs them that humans do the same thing. Hammy finds the camera in the meantime and claims it. He says the camera lens tastes [...] "shiny". RJ and the kids then inform Verne they will not do it again.|$|R
60|$|Still, {{when the}} burnings and torturings were brisk, the amount totalled up very handsomely. Thus, as the pair sat at their meal this morning, {{they were engaged}} in <b>figuring</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> might expect to receive from the estate of the late Heer Jansen, or at least Black Meg was so {{employed}} {{with the help of}} a deal board and a bit of chalk. At last she announced the result, which was satisfactory. Simon held up his fat hands in admiration.|$|R

5000|$|As {{discovered}} by Marco in the episode The Starzl Mutation; Seattle Presbyterian Hospital started using a flawed radiation machine {{to treat their}} cancer patients in 1969. The microswitches that controlled the machine were not functioning properly, so the doses were incorrect. This went on for just under five years. Once the hospital <b>figured</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were doing they tested everyone who had ever been exposed to it {{and in some cases}} the radiation induced a small mutation. This mutation was a slight alteration of the eleventh chromosome, named the [...] "Starzl mutation" [...] after the manufacturer of the faulty machine.|$|R

So we did two more and then by the third one, <b>they</b> had <b>figured</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were doing. I think it's dead, it's a couple of years since we did that now. Normally when these things go, they go pretty quickly because people have other commitments, and Charlie is busy. It's a real shame.

5000|$|Players {{have criticized}} the game for being too hard {{and that it had}} a steep {{learning}} curve.

5000|$|While {{describing}} the album, Allen said that [...] "we {{decided to try}} and make bigger sounding, more ethereal songs, real songs". She chose [...] "22" [...] as a single from the album, and later declared that, lyrically, the song describes a near thirty-year-old woman realizing she's {{at the end of her}} prime. The singer commented on the song's meaning: It's more about girls that haven't <b>figured</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> want to do with themselves. Especially really pretty girls. They can rely on their looks to an extent: people will pay for their dinners and drinks and they don't really have to think. And then suddenly it hits them that they're not doing anything with their lives and it's too late. And, yes, it's about a specific person. Most of my songs start like that and then become more general.|$|R
40|$|During a National Public Radio {{broadcast}} in the UnitedStates in March 1999, a sixth grader explained whatshe was learning from playing the Stock Market Game, an activity {{designed to help}} children become familiar with how the stock market functions. She said, “This game makes me think how to think ” (Prakash, 1999). What this statement re-veals is that this young learner was beginning to understand the real key to learning; she was engaged in metacognition. Metacognition can be defined simply as thinking about thinking. Learners who are metacognitively aware {{know what to do}} when <b>they</b> don’t know <b>what</b> to do; that is, they have strategies for finding <b>out</b> or <b>figuring</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> need to do. The use of metacognitive strategies ignites one’s thinking and can lead to more profound learning and improved performance, especially among learners who are struggling.

He adopts the name Johnny O'Rourke, and finds a room at a theatrical boarding house. He becomes friends with some other boarders (including O'Connor, Ryan and Gloria Jean) and {{falls in love with}} a woman (Frazee). His friends overhear him talking to his officer on the phone. They misinterpret the conversation and conclude that he is a deserter. They push him into giving himself up and returning to duty. Confused by their behavior at first, he <b>figures</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> are up to, and plays along. It all works out in the end. The closing song in the picture is a rousing patriotic number sung directly to the audience by the main players in the film.|$|R

5000|$|One {{person who}} was {{influenced}} by the Marlenites was a young Noam Chomsky, who was introduced to the group, {{partly as a result of}} the history professor Ellis Rivkin.

The game entered beta around May 2009, and had numerous play-testers exploring the game. About half of 5th Cell's staff worked on the game. It was developed alongside the DS version of Drawn to Life: The Next Chapter.|$|E
50|$|Right {{before the}} contest begins the assassins {{go to the}} same barn Dae Jo-yeong was locked in to form a plan (each of their swords are laced with a deadly poison). Dae Jo-yeong hears them talking and <b>figures</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> are up to, but he then makes a tiny noise which {{immediately}} catches the assassins' attention. One of the assassins tells the others to go ahead since the martial arts contest was beginning and stays to take care of Dae Jo-yeong. The princess enters the barn, and the assassin is about to kill her. Dae Jo-yeong is able to save the princess and knock out the assassin. When Sukyeong tries to prevent him from leaving, as she thinks that he is the assassin, he knocks her out. The assassination attempt fails, thanks to Dae Jo-yeong, but he is cut by one of the poisoned blades and falls unconscious. Yeon Gaesomun immediately orders a royal doctor to heal him.|$|R
50|$|The writ of {{election}} was issued after a sitting {{of the house}} on the night of 25 March 1913. The premier dropped the election writ and dissolved the house after he ensured that the governments legislation on new electoral boundaries had been given Royal Assent.

50|$|Roots & Shoots {{was founded}} in 1991, when Dr. Goodall started to give talks at local schools in Tanzania. A group of 12 of her {{students}} selected by their classmates met with her at her home to discuss their local environmental concerns and to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> could do.
