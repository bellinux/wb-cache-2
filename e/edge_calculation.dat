By this means, migrants were found to aggregate along borders of fields. There were variations to this pattern, but the same borders were generally infested in successive plantings of the same field. Within each field, population density decreased continuously with distance from the borders. This decline was shown to be described by the relationship log(m) = log(a) +bx, where m is {{the average number of}} migrants per plant at distance, x (in meters), from the edge, and a is the average per plant at the field <b>edge.</b> <b>Calculation</b> of b, the regression coefficient, and use of this information in pest surveillance are described...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the long}} term {{research}} goals has been to attain a quantitative theory of deep core X-ray spectroscopies. These spectroscopies include X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS), X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD), diffraction anomalous fine structure (DAFS), photoelectron diffraction (PD), and others. All are used extensively at modern synchrotron radiation facilities. Since they share in common the same excited state electronic structure, these spectroscopies have similar theoretical underpinings: they all {{can be described in}} terms of a curved wave multiple scattering (MS) formalism. These spectroscopies are important probes of local atomic structure, especially in non-crystalline materials where conventional diffraction techniques are inapplicable. However, their interpretation usually requires accurate theoretical models or experimental reference standards. With the development of the authors fast XAFS codes FEFF, they have taken a giant step toward these goals. MS codes are generally equivalent or better than experimental standards, and have been recognized as the best of those available. Accomplishments are summarized. They include an improved photoelectron self-energy approximation for near <b>edge</b> <b>calculations,</b> intrinsic and interference effects, improved <b>edge</b> <b>calculations,</b> background fine structure, improved FEFF code, full MS XANES calculations, and calculation of the fine structure in the XMCD of Gd...|$|R

30|$|The {{introduction}} of lifting implementations for image wavelet decomposition generated possibilities of several applications and several adaptive decomposition variations. The prediction step of a lifting stage constitutes the interesting {{part of the}} decomposition since it aims to reduce the energy {{of one of the}} decomposition bands by making predictions using the other decomposition band. In that aspect, more successful predictions yield better efficiency in terms of reduced energy in the lower band. In this work, we present a prediction filter whose prediction domain pixels are selected adaptively according to the local edge characteristics of the image. By judicuously selecting the prediction domain from pixels that are expected to have closer relation to the estimated pixel, the prediction error signal energy is reduced. In order to keep the adaptation rule symmetric for the encoder and the decoder sides, lossless compression applications are examined. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm provides good compression results. Furthermore, the <b>edge</b> <b>calculation</b> is computationally inexpensive and comparable to the famous Daubechies 5 / 3 lifting implementation.|$|E
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} set of autonomous, ice-ocean {{measurements were}} collected across the Canada Basin {{to study the}} summer evolution of the ice-ocean boundary layer (IOBL) and ocean mixed layer (OML). Evaluation of local heat and freshwater balances and associated turbulent forcing reveals that melt ponds (MPs) strongly influence the summer IOBL-OML evolution. Areal expansion of MPs in mid-June start the upper ocean evolution resulting in significant increases to ocean absorbed radiative flux (19 W m− 2 in this study). Buoyancy provided by MP drainage shoals and freshens the IOBL resulting in a 39 MJ m− 2 increase in heat storage in just 19 days (52 % of the summer total). Following MP drainage, a near-surface fresh layer deepens through shear-forced mixing to form the summer mixed layer (sML). In late summer, basal melt increases due to stronger turbulent mixing in the thin sML {{and the expansion of}} open water areas due in part to wind-forced divergence of the sea ice. Thermal heterogeneities in the marginal ice zone (MIZ) upper ocean led to large ocean-to-ice heat fluxes (100 – 200 W m− 2) and enhanced basal ice melt (3 – 6 cm d− 1), well away from the ice <b>edge.</b> <b>Calculation</b> of the upper ocean heat budget shows that local radiative heat input accounted for at least 89 % of the observed latent heat losses and heat storage (partitioned 0. 77 / 0. 23).

40|$|Several {{aspects of}} {{tunneling}} {{at the edge}} of a fractional quantum Hall (FQH) state are studied. Most examples are given for the non- abelian filling fraction ? = 5 2 Moore-Read Pfaffian state. For tunneling between opposite edges of an abelian fractional quantum Hall state at a quantum point contact, the perturbative calculation of tunneling current, conductance, and current noise, as a function of finite bias and temperature, is reviewed. We extend this formalism to include non-abelian FQH states as well. The crucial ingredient is conformal block decomposition. We argue the validity of perturbation theory to arbitrary order. A double point contact interferometer is considered for the v = 5 / 2 FQH state, for which a vanishing interference pattern in the tunneling current was predicted when a non-abelian quasiparticle is trapped inside the interferometer. We confirm this result in a dynamical <b>edge</b> <b>calculation.</b> We show how interference can be restored through a higher order tunneling process, which exchanges a charge neutral quasiparticle between the central island and one of the edges. On the edge of the v = 5 / 2 Pfaffian and anti-Pfaffian FQH states interactions can cause a transition to another phase. The relevant operator that condenses in this process consists of tunneling of electrons between the different edge branches. Under the phase transition a pair of counter propagating Majorana modes acquires a gap. The transition is an edge only phase transition, as the bulk state is unchanged. Such a transition can change the observed quasiparticle charge and exponent as measured in transport. The Majora-gapping transition shows similarities to a transition due to edge reconstruction. A setup is proposed that can probe slow edge velocities that may be present in certain abelian and non-abelian FQH state. At a long tunneling contact the coherent interference of tunneling quasiparticles causes a resonance in the tunneling current. From a high-precision observation of such a resonance not only the slow edge velocity can be determined, but also quasiparticle charge as well as neutral and charged tunneling exponents. Temperature is found to set an effective decoherence length scale. by Bas Jorn Overbosch. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Physics, 2008.

Iron forms several stable oxides and its phase diagram is more complicated than that of other transition metal as Ni or Co. The differences in the local symmetry of the three iron oxides are related with the distinguishable NEXAFS spectra.
