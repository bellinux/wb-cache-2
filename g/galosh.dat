25|$|Rubber was {{introduced}} to Europe and America and created a shift in shoes from the pattens and clogs to the <b>galosh.</b> The <b>galosh</b> was soft and gummy in warm weather and hard and stiff in the cold. The style of men's shoes closely mirrored that of women's, as they were narrow, heelless slippers with low-cut vamps. They were very flimsy looking, {{as though they were}} held on by suction cups, for the leather barely covered the toes and hardly gripped the heel.|$|E
25|$|Galoshes, {{also known}} as dickersons, gumshoes, or overshoes, are a type of rubber boot that is slipped over shoes {{to keep them from}} getting muddy or wet. In the United States, the word galoshes may be used interchangeably with boot, {{especially}} a rubberized boot. In the United Kingdom, however, a <b>galosh</b> is an overshoe made of a weatherproof material to protect a more vulnerable shoe underneath and keep the foot warm and dry.|$|E

25|$|The {{response}} {{to the threat of}} interception by ABM-1 <b>Galosh</b> missiles was to deploy an upgraded or Improved Front End (IFE) to Polaris A3T using the Antelope/Super Antelope/Chevaline technology. The Chevaline solution was to decrease the number of warheads carried by the Polaris system from three to two, using the space and weight to carry numerous decoys, and increase the likelihood of warhead survival by substituting a new super-hardened thermonuclear primary for the warhead contained in a new super-hardened RV.|$|E
25|$|The {{project was}} carried out in extreme secrecy by a team {{consisting}} of the Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) at Aldermaston, the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) at Farnborough, and Hunting Engineering at Ampthill, Sperry Gyroscope at Bracknell, Lockheed Aerospace in the United States, and others too numerous to mention, both in the US and the UK. The system was tested at the US Eastern Test Range, Cape Canaveral, and the warheads were tested with two full scale underground nuclear tests - 'UGT's - (Fallon UGT in 1974 and Banon UGT in 1976) at the Nevada Test Site. There were also numerous weapon effects tests to prove the RV/warhead resistance to the radiation-effects of the <b>Galosh</b> warhead; and there were numerous missile tests at the Woomera Missile Range, Australia, to develop various aspects of the RVs, the PAC and decoys. Recent declassifications of official files show that more than half the total project costs were spent in the United States, with industry and government agencies.|$|E
25|$|The Maniac, now impersonating Malipiero, finds Pissani and his lackey, the Constable, in {{the room}} where the anarchist was during his interrogation. Telling them that he is Malipiero, the Maniac asks for the Superintendent, who was {{involved}} with the interrogation with Pissani and the Constable. The Maniac orders the three policemen to re-enact the events of the interrogation; in turn fabricating many of the events, such as changing beating the anarchist to making jokes with him, incorporating new lines into the transcript and even breaking out in song. When the investigation reaches the matter of the fall, the Constable reveals he grabbed the anarchist's shoe, in an attempt to stop him from falling. However, the Maniac notes that witnesses reported that the anarchist had both shoes on. When Pissani surmises that the anarchist was wearing a <b>galosh,</b> the Superintendent breaks into a rage, making Pissani accidentally reveal that the Superintendent pushed the anarchist out of the window. The two policemen then realise that the Maniac was listening. The phone in the office suddenly rings, which Pissani answers. He tells them that it is a journalist called Maria Feletti, who the Superintendent agreed to meet to clear rumors about the interrogation, wanting to come up to the office.|$|E

2500|$|In 1982 Australian {{physicist}} Brian Martin, {{who frequently}} corresponded with John Hampson, penned a short historical synopsis {{on the history}} of interest in the effects of the direct NOx generated by nuclear fireballs, and in doing so, also outlined Hampson's other non-mainstream viewpoints, particularly those relating to greater ozone destruction from upper-atmospheric detonations as a result of any widely used anti-ballistic missile (ABM-1 <b>Galosh)</b> system. However, Martin ultimately concludes that it is [...] "unlikely that {{in the context of a}} major nuclear war" [...] ozone degradation would be of serious concern. Martin describes views about potential ozone loss and therefore increases in Ultraviolet light leading to the widespread destruction of crops, as advocated by journalist Jonathan Schell in his popular 1982 book The Fate of the Earth, as highly unlikely.|$|E
2500|$|By then, the {{historian}} lived a bohemian life, {{and was a}} regular at Fialcovsky Coffeehouse, where he appeared [...] "jocular and always absent minded". According to the recollections of Mariu Theodorian-Carada, although [...] "Boniface Florescu" [...] and Demetriade made efforts to keep it alive, by 1886 [...] "Fialkovsky was dwindling". Potra notes that Florescu was memorable as a Bucharest [...] "type", [...] "with his quite disheveled appearance, his paddling, slow and measured stride, and above all with his way of life". Reportedly, he always wore just one <b>galosh,</b> or sometimes one of his wife's boots, and his suits were covered in ink blots. Gheorghe Gh. Longinescu, who was schooled at Saint Sava, recalls that his teacher had an unusual, crooked, stride, which matched his handwriting. An unnamed Saint Sava alumnus recalled in 1926: [...] "Just about every day, he would walk the streets reading from a newspaper or a book, and, since he was shortsighted, he kept [...] very close to his eyes, and so he bumped into streetlights or street corners, after which he would present his excuses." ...|$|E

The <b>galoshes</b> do their work and suddenly the watchmen becomes the lieutenant, sitting at his desk. He notices the lieutenant had written a poem called, [...] "If Only I Were Rich", which confesses that the lieutenant actually feels he is short on money and is lonely as a result. Then he realizes he would rather be a watchman, because he at least has a wife and children who share his joy and sorrows. The <b>galoshes</b> then transform him back into himself. The watchman, still unaware what has happened, watches a falling star. He wishes he could travel to the moon and suddenly the <b>galoshes</b> send him there at the speed of light. There he meets several moon men who all wonder whether Earth is inhabited and decide this must be impossible. Back on Earth the lifeless body of the watchman is found and he is brought to a hospital, where they take his shoes off, breaking the spell again. He awakens and declares it to have been the most terrible night he had ever experienced.|$|R
