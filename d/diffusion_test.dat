50|$|The agar <b>diffusion</b> <b>test</b> (Kirby-Bauer {{antibiotic}} testing, KB testing, or disc diffusion antibiotic sensitivity testing) {{is a test}} of {{the antibiotic}} sensitivity of bacteria. It uses antibiotic discs to test the extent to which bacteria are affected by those antibiotics. In this test, wafers containing antibiotics are placed on an agar plate where bacteria have been placed, and the plate is left to incubate. If an antibiotic stops the bacteria from growing or kills the bacteria, there will be an area around the wafer where the bacteria have not grown enough to be visible. This is called a zone of inhibition.|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the reliability of resistant-reported results of disk <b>diffusion</b> <b>test</b> for 6 routinely used antibiotics against Gram-positive microorganisms of nosocomial origin, using E-test method. Over a 1 -year period, clinical specimens (e. g. blood, tracheal secretions, wound secretions, urine, etc.) were obtained from hospitalized patients with defined nosocomial infection and were cultured. Isolated Gram-positive bacteria underwent disk <b>diffusion</b> <b>test</b> for cephalothin, oxacillin, clindamycin, ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, teicoplanin (only for Enterococci), and meropenem antibiotics. E-test method was performed for all isolates resistant or intermediately sensitive to the disks of any mentioned antibiotics. Data showed compatible results of disk <b>diffusion</b> <b>test</b> with the results of E-test method for cephalothin, oxacillin, ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin.

40|$|Interpretive {{agreements}} {{among the}} results of fluconazole broth microdilution tests, Etests, and disk <b>diffusion</b> <b>tests</b> were documented by evaluating 495 Candida spp. Microdilution reference test results were in agreement with 96 % of the Etest results; most discrepancies were minor differences. Fluconazole resistance of Candida krusei strains often required a full 48 h of incubation {{in order to be}} observed by the standard method. For the disk <b>diffusion</b> <b>tests</b> that were performed on Mueller-Hinton agar with glucose and methylene blue, 97 % of results were in agreement with those of the reference test, especially when zones of inhibition were measured after the first 24 h of incubation. Some Candida glabrata isolates failed to grow satisfactorily until a full 48 h of incubation was completed. Precision was determined by testing 50 selected isolates in triplicate in each of three laboratories.

Tests with 579 clinical isolates yielded an unacceptably high rate of very major discrepancies between disk tests and microdilution tests; such discrepancies were especially common among Enterobacter spp. Additional studies support the concept that standard microdilution tests and standard disk <b>diffusion</b> <b>tests</b> may fail to detect a potential for resistance among some microorganisms...|$|R
40|$|Three tests, {{the disk}} <b>diffusion</b> <b>test,</b> the double-disc synergy {{test and the}} inhibitor-potentiated disc <b>diffusion</b> <b>test,</b> were {{compared}} for their abilities to detect production of extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL) in 702 Escherichia coli and 472 Klebsiella spp. strains from four hospitals. Eleven percent E. coli and 13 % Klebsiella spp. were found to produce ESBL. As an indicator of ESBL activity, the sensitivities of the five extended- spectrum β-lactams were as follows: cefotaxime (100 %), cefpodoxime (99. 3 %), ceftriaxone (98. 6 %), aztreonam (93 %) and ceftazidime (57. 7 %) when interpreted using the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards criteria. Their positive predictive values ranged from 67. 8 - 83. 8 %. Both the inhibitor- potentiated disc <b>diffusion</b> <b>test</b> and the double-disc synergy test (at three inter-disc widths of 20, 25 and 30 mm) were capable of identifying all the ESBL-producers. However, at a single inter-disc width of 30 mm, the double- disc synergy test has limited sensitivity (83. 8 %). As a second test for confirming ESBL activity in strains with reduced susceptibility to β- lactams, the inhibitor-potentiated disc <b>diffusion</b> <b>test</b> is therefore a simple and reliable option. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{cefoxitin}} {{disc test}} to detect Staphylococcus aureus {{that are likely}} to contain the mecA gene has been widely advocated since test was first suggested.

Three hundred strains of S. aureus isolated from clinical samples were included in the study. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was done for oxacillin (1 µg) and cefoxitin (30 µg). PCR for mecA gene was performed. Out of 300 isolates, 45 were found to be methicillin resistant, and 50 were resistant for cefoxitin. For all the 50 isolates mecA was positive. Results of cefoxitin disc <b>diffusion</b> <b>test</b> are in concurrence with the PCR for mecA gene. Thus, cefoxitin disc <b>diffusion</b> <b>test</b> can be used as an alternative to PCR...|$|E

The overall categoric agreement between participant disk <b>diffusion</b> <b>test</b> results and reference MIC results was 87 % for fluconazole and 95. 2 % for voriconazole.

Our primary objective was to compare the results of voriconazole disk diffusion testing of Candida spp. performed by centers participating in the ARTEMIS program with disk diffusion and MIC results obtained by the central reference laboratory. A total of 2, 934 isolates of Candida spp. were tested by CLSI disk diffusion and reference broth microdilution methods in the central reference laboratory. These results were compared {{to the results of}} disk diffusion testing performed in the 54 participating centers.

The overall categorical agreement between participant disk <b>diffusion</b> <b>test</b> results and reference laboratory MIC results was 94. 1 %, with 0. 1 % very major errors (VME) and 3. 4 % major errors (ME).

40|$|A {{prospective}} {{study on the}} susceptibility of Clostridium difficile to metronidazole and vancomycin using the Etest and disk <b>diffusion</b> <b>test</b> was performed over a 6 -month period. One hundred strains were tested; one strain was highly resistant to metronidazole (MIC = 64 μg/mL). The zone size of inhibition by the disk <b>diffusion</b> <b>test</b> correlated with the MIC {{as determined by the}} Etest (regression coefficient = - 0. 043 for metronidazole and - 0. 044 for vancomycin, p < 0. 001 for both antibiotics). However, the correlation coefficient was low for both metronidazole (r = 0. 574) and vancomycin (r = 0. 473); hence the zone of inhibition by disk <b>diffusion</b> <b>test</b> could not predict the MIC satisfactorily. Metronidazole is still the first-line antibiotic for the treatment of C. difficile-associated diarrhea because the incidence of metronidazole resistant strains remains very low. However, the efficacy of metronidazole in the treatment of infections attributable to isolates with high-level metronidazole resistance may be compromised because the fecal concentration of metronidazole is relatively low when compared with the MIC values of the less susceptible strains. Oral vancomycin is the drug of choice under such circumstances, as its fecal concentration is much higher than that of metronidazole.
