25|$|The {{country is}} divided into {{multiple}} zones, called circles (roughly along state boundaries). Government and several private players run local and long distance telephone services. Competition has caused prices to drop and calls across India {{are one of the}} cheapest in the world. The rates are supposed to go down further with new measures to be taken by the Information Ministry. Call drop fine: Telcos warn of raising tariff. In September 2004, the number of mobile phone connections crossed the number of fixed-line connections and presently dwarfs the wireline segment by a ratio of around 20:1. The mobile subscriber base has grown by a factor of over a hundred and thirty, from 5 million subscribers in 2001 to over 929 million subscribers as of May 2012. India primarily follows the GSM mobile system, in the 900MHz band. Recent operators also operate in the 1800MHz band. The dominant players are Airtel, Reliance Infocomm, Vodafone, Idea cellular and BSNL/MTNL. There are many smaller players, with operations in only a few states. <b>International</b> <b>roaming</b> agreements exist between most operators and many foreign carriers.

40|$|The Southern African Development Community (SADC) {{experiences}} {{high levels}} of cross border human traffic due to trade, cultural and language links across the fifteen countries. Technological advances and increased domestic competition have contributed to lower domestic retail tariffs for mobile cellular services. Unfortunately, this has not extended to <b>international</b> mobile <b>roaming</b> (IMR) retail tariffs which remain unacceptably high. These high tariffs have attracted harsh criticism from commentators and prompted calls for regulatory intervention. This study investigates the level of <b>international</b> mobile <b>roaming</b> (IMR) retail tariffs, usage and demand elasticity. It further considers whether competition or regulation play {{a greater role in}} reducing these tariffs and whether regulatory intervention is likely to reduce competition. The research took the form of a quantitative study and used an online survey questionnaire as the data collection tool. The results of the study confirmed that <b>international</b> mobile <b>roaming</b> (IMR) retail tariffs are indeed high, resulting in poor uptake by cost conscious travellers who pay for their own cellular usage. The finding that competition plays a greater role than regulation in reducing IMR retail tariffs is not significant. It was concluded that neither competition nor regulation are sufficient on their own to provide increased social welfare. The best result is obtained when competition is allowed to flourish, underpinned by an enabling regulatory framework. CopyrightDissertation (MBA) [...] University of Pretoria, 2011.

40|$|Explanatory Statement Issued by the Authority of the Minister for Communications.   Legislative Authority Subsection 125 AA(4) of the Telecommunications Act 1997 {{enables the}} Minister for Communications {{to direct the}} Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA), in writing, to {{determine}} a standard that applies to participants in a specified section of the telecommunications industry that deals {{with one or more}} specified matters relating to the telecommunications activities of those participants. Purpose The purpose of the Telecommunications (Amendment of <b>International</b> Mobile <b>Roaming</b> Industry Standard) Direction 2016 (Direction) is to direct the ACMA to amend the Telecommunications (<b>International</b> Mobile <b>Roaming)</b> Industry Standard 2013 (Standard). The amendments of the Standard required by the Direction are intended to allow for greater streamlining and simplification of the Standard, including: 	allowing the upfront warning and charging SMS messages to be combined into one SMS message 	increasing flexibility in the types of mechanisms {{that can be used to}} decline <b>international</b> mobile <b>roaming</b> (IMR) services 	adding the ability for suppliers of IMR services to voluntarily offer a mechanism for customers to opt out of spend management notifications 	delaying the application of parts of the Standard to mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) until 2019, after the completion of the review of the Standard These changes are expected to deliver net benefits to consumers and suppliers of IMR services by: 	reducing carriage service provider messaging costs, while also reducing unnecessary message load on customers 	providing greater flexibility for both carriage service providers and their customers to terminate unwanted IMR services and opt out of spend management notifications without imposing additional consumer costs 	avoiding potentially unnecessary costs on MVNOs and a loss of market competition and consumer options. Background In August 2012, a ministerial direction was made under section 125 AA of the Telecommunications Act 1997, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (<b>International</b> Mobile <b>Roaming</b> Industry Standard) Direction (No. 1) 2012 (2012 Direction), requiring the ACMA to make the Standard. The ACMA made the Standard in June 2013 in accordance with the 2012 Direction. It commenced progressively from September 2013 in three tranches, with the second tranche having commenced on 27 September 2014 and the third tranche currently required to commence on 23 May 2016. The first tranche requires mobile carriers to send SMS messages to customers upon arrival in their destination country containing information on the pricing of IMR services in that country. This tranche requires MVNOs to either send post-paid and automatically recharging prepaid customers the same SMS messages regarding pricing, or instead to provide information to a customer prior to agreeing to provide an IMR service to the customer. This tranche also requires all carriage service providers to allow customers to opt out of purchasing these services. The second tranche requires carriers to provide spend management tools, including at least one tool to allow customers to obtain current usage estimates for IMR services. Carriers must send SMS notifications to customers in the following circumstances: 	if the customer is using a post-paid service or automatically recharging prepaid service, for every $ 100 of IMR data used 	where the customer has an included value pack for data, calls or SMS, alerts for when 50 %, 85 % and 100 % of the included value has been used 	where the customer reaches 100 % of an include value pack, a notification of the maximum charges of continuing to use the service (i. e. excess charges). The third tranche would extend the application of the pricing SMS message requirements from the first tranche and spend management tools from the second tranche to MVNOs. Industry stakeholders put forward proposals in 2014 - 15 to amend the Standard to address concerns about potential unintended consequences on MVNOs and to streamline the operation of the Standard where possible...|$|R
