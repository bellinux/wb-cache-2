Canada's National Energy Program, which was announced just as prices peaked in 1980, imposed price controls on Canadian oil and further suppressed investment.|$|E

There was intense competition among drilling companies for the work available, and the cost inflation induced by the federal government's Petroleum Incentives Payments declined swiftly.|$|E

25|$|An {{observation}} of the Datta study is that the learning group spent 180% more time in SWS than did the control group during the post-trial sleep-recording session. This study shows that after spatial <b>exploration</b> <b>activity,</b> patterns of hippocampal place cells are reactivated during SWS following the experiment. Rats were run through a linear track using rewards on either end. The rats would then {{be placed in the}} track for 30 minutes to allow them to adjust (PRE), then they ran the track with reward-based training for 30 minutes (RUN), and then they were allowed to rest for 30 minutes.|$|E
