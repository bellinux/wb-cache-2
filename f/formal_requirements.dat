The program expanded to include Master of Laws (LL.M.) and Master of Civil Engineering in its early stages of growth, before a formal graduate school education was developed with a thesis not required to receive the degrees. This changed in 1924 with <b>formal</b> <b>requirements</b> developed for graduate degrees, including offering Doctorate (PhD) degrees.|$|E

25|$|Due {{to certain}} aspects of Orthodox Jewish marital laws, Rabbi Yosef ruled that upon arrival in Israel, the Beta Israel had to undergo a pro forma {{conversion}} to Judaism.

40|$|Abstract: The {{challenges}} of object-oriented design are {{to identify the}} objects and classes needed to implement the software, and to define the behaviors and the attributes of the objects from requirement specification. These are very complicated challenges because of there dependence on heuristic. <b>Formal</b> <b>requirement</b> specification have the additional advantage over informal requirement specification because they are amenable to machine analysis and manipulation. The greatest benefit of applying a <b>formal</b> <b>requirement</b> specification is that system designers gain {{a deeper understanding of}} the specified system, because they have forced to be more abstract and precise about desired properties. Another important application of formal specification is that they can be used as a base to reason about the behavior of the desired system. <b>Formal</b> <b>requirement</b> specification will be first important step for solving the difficulties and ill-defined tasks in the object model creation process, including identification of objects, attributes, behaviors and organization of objects with inheritance. In this paper, we propose methodological support for object identification from <b>formal</b> <b>requirement</b> specification...|$|R

25|$|Although Conservative Judaism's Committee on Jewish Law and Standards enacted an {{exception}} to the general rules of Sabbath observance to permit driving to attend a synagogue, it otherwise formally requires the same rules of Shabbat observance as Orthodox Judaism with respect to carrying a burden. Therefore, Conservative Judaism's rabbinate requires the use of an eruv for ordinary carrying outside this exception. Compliance with the <b>formal</b> <b>requirements</b> varies. In general, conservative authorities and organizations have not attempted to build or develop rules for eruvin distinct from ones established by Orthodox authorities and organizations.|$|E
25|$|In 1855, {{the newly}} elected city council passed {{ordinances}} to formally establish the Chicago Police Department. Chicago was divided into three police precincts, each served by a station house. Station No. 1 was located in a building on State Street between Lake and Randolph streets. Station No. 2 was on West Randolph Street near Des Plaines Street. Station No. 3 was on Michigan Street (since then renamed Hubbard Street) near Clark Street. Political connections were important to joining the force; <b>formal</b> <b>requirements</b> were few, until 1895. After 1856, the department hired many foreign-born recruits, especially unskilled, but English-speaking, Irish immigrants.|$|E

25|$|The {{satellite}} navigation system GLONASS was conceived {{in the late}} 1960s, and <b>formal</b> <b>requirements</b> were completed in 1970. The government of the Soviet Union {{made a decision to}} develop the system in 1976. Design work was carried out by specialists led by Vladimir Cheremisin at NPO PM in Krasnoyarsk-26. The first launch took place in 1982. Until its dissolution in 1991, the Soviet Union launched 43 GLONASS-related satellites. Work on the system was continued by the Russian Federation which brought it its full operational capability in 1995. In the following years, the system fell into disrepair due to the economic crisis in the country and diminished space funding. Starting from 2000, the government under President Vladimir Putin made the restoration of GLONASS a top priority; its funding was doubled and after a lull of several years, launches were restarted again. In 2003, a new satellite design, GLONASS-M, was introduced. By early 2011, GLONASS had 22 operational satellites, two short of the required constellation of 24 to provide global coverage. The latest and significantly improved satellite type, GLONASS-K, is set to be launched in February 2011.|$|E
500|$|In 1970, the then-Dean of Institute Relations, Benson R. Snyder, {{published}} The Hidden Curriculum, {{arguing that}} education at MIT was often slighted {{in favor of}} following a set of unwritten expectations, and that graduating with good grades was more often the product of figuring out the system rather than a solid education. The successful student, according to Snyder, {{was the one who}} was able to discern which of the <b>formal</b> <b>requirements</b> were to be ignored in favor of which unstated norms. For example, organized student groups had compiled [...] "course bibles"—collections of problem-set and examination questions and answers for later students to use as references. This sort of gamesmanship, Snyder argued, hindered development of a creative intellect and contributed to student discontent and unrest.|$|E
500|$|These were duly held {{everywhere}} except Tunstall, {{where the}} council refused to participate. Fenton council {{made it clear}} that it would not back any proposal that did not have the support of its electorate. In Burslem, a high turnout of 74 per cent of voters delivered a vote of 3:2 against federation. The Staffordshire Advertiser described the events surrounding this poll as [...] "unprecedented" [...] with both proponents and opponents—chiefly the Association for Promoting the Federation of the Pottery Towns and the Burslem Anti-Federation League—making every effort to ensure their supporters voted. An indication of the strength of feeling and interest in the proposal is that the events surrounding the federation proposal were used as a background setting by the author Arnold Bennett in his contemporary (1908) novel The Old Wives' Tale. With Fenton, Tunstall and Burslem all opposing federation it was left to Hanley, Stoke and Longton to submit proposals to the Local Government Board. The Local Government Board ruled that only the submission made by Longton met the statutory and other <b>formal</b> <b>requirements</b> and that it alone would form the basis of the subsequent local inquiry, held in January 1908.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{challenging}} tasks in specification engineering for a multi-agent robotic system is to formally specify and architect the system, especially as a multi-agent robotic system is concurrent having concurrent processing, and often having dynamic environment. The <b>formal</b> <b>requirement</b> and architecture specifications along with step-wise refinement from abstract to concrete concepts play major role in formalizing the system. This paper proposes the <b>formal</b> <b>requirement</b> and architecture specifications aspects of an approach that supports analysis with respect to functional as well as non-functional properties by step-wise refinement from abstract to concrete specifications and formal architecture definition. These formal specifications have been exemplified by a case study. As formal specification techniques are getting more mature, our capability to build a correct complex multi-agent robotic system also grows quickly. Comment: 6 page...|$|R

2500|$|The first satellite-based radio {{navigation}} system developed in the Soviet Union was Tsiklon, which had the purpose of providing ballistic missile submarines a method for accurate positioning. 31 Tsiklon satellites were launched between 1967 and 1978. The main problem with the system was that, although highly accurate for stationary or slow-moving ships, it required several hours of observation by the receiving station to fix a position, making it unusable for many navigation purposes and for {{the guidance of the}} new generation of ballistic missiles. In 1968–1969, a new navigation system, which would support not only the navy, but also the air, land and space forces, was conceived. <b>Formal</b> <b>requirements</b> were completed in 1970; in 1976, the government made a decision to launch development of the [...] "Unified Space Navigation System GLONASS".|$|E

[...] At this point all physicians were either self-taught or learned their trade through an apprenticeship. [...] Despite this, there was an attempt at organization, as the army did have a medical manual that was passed out to its physicians.
