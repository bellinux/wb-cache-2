50|$|Märklin offered many {{different}} decoders and kits to upgrade analog locomotives to digital control.

For many years, unlike Digital Command Control, Märklin did not use a plug in connector for the decoder and so conversion involved soldering output wires.|$|E

40|$|We {{present the}} {{development}} of a 512 -channel module for high count rate digital X-ray imaging systems with silicon strip detectors. This module has been characterized for noise and matching performance having in mind possible future applications like dual energy mammography and angiography. To obtain good detection efficiency at the relevant energies (10 - 50 keV) the module works edge-on with strips oriented parallel to the incoming X-ray beam. We have used silicon microstrip detectors cut at 60 and 20 μm from the active area. The readout ASIC consists of 64 analog front-end channels, 2 x 64 counters, an input-output block, a command <b>decoder,</b> <b>digital</b> to analog converters and a calibration circuit. Each analog channel contains a charge sensitive amplifier, a shaper with peaking time of 160 ns, two independent discriminators and two independent 20 -bit counters. The 512 -Channel module presented in this paper is a good candidate to build imaging systems based on dual energy techniques, using silicon strip detectors in edge-on mode, as a further development of the already reported angiographic and mammographic prototypes. The much reduced inactive region of the present detectors allows for increased efficiency at the low energy end of the diagnostic range, while the increased strip length allows to use the system with good efficiency up to at least 50 keV...|$|R

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 28 - 31, 1985 / Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, NevadaCommand Destruct Receivers {{are used}} on all launch {{vehicles}} {{for the purpose}} of initiating flight termination. The up-link command signal is a UHF carrier frequency modulated with Inter-Range Instrumentation Group (IRIG) audio tones. Typically three commands are used to control and terminate the flight: ARM, DESTRUCT, and OPTIONAL command. The combination and sequence of specified IRIG tones determines the command to be issued. The decoder portion of the command destruct receiver determines the presence and sequence of IRIG tones. Through the use of a microprocessor and digital signalprocessing-technology, Cincinnati Electronics has designed and developed a <b>digital</b> <b>decoder</b> which detects four IRIG tones simultaneously. The <b>digital</b> <b>decoder</b> provides stabilities and repeatabilities unattainable with analog decoders. Reliability and reproducibility are also superior when using the digital approach through the elimination of select and variable components. This improved performance of the decoder is a result of crystal controlled digital filtering and a constant false-alarm rate provided by the microprocessor. The digital filtering is achieved through Finite Impulse Response digital filters. There are a number of additional features provided by the <b>digital</b> <b>decoder.</b> Self-testing of portions of the receiver and correcting for temperature drift can be performed by the decoder. The <b>digital</b> <b>decoder</b> can have its command sequences reprogrammed in the field allowing separate control and termination of each vehicle in a multiple vehicle launch.

40|$|In digital {{communication}} systems, both random and burst errors may {{occur in the}} transmission channel. As a result, the signal will be distorted at the receiver. Error correction coding is required to eliminate such errors. In this study, a Reed Solomon (255, 191) error correction code is modelled to detect and correct the data transmitted in a noisy channel. Reed Solomon (RS) codec is a powerful error correction tool {{that is used to}} ensure the errors correction in {{digital communication}} systems. However, RS codec is computionally intensive and custom design is required for different <b>digital</b> systems. RS <b>decoder</b> modeling using Very High speed hardware Description Language (VHDL) made it suitable to be implemented on a Field Programmable logic Array (FPGA) based copocessor. The flexibility of FPGA in hardware reconfiguration greatly reduces the development time for RS decoder in all kinds of specialized circuit designs. The arithmetic operations which are used in RS code were Galois Fields (GF) addition and multiplication. This study presented: i) RS encoder modelled using MATLAB with data encoded in the noisy channel for functional verification. ii) RS decoder modelled in Very High speed hardware Description Language (VHDL) to recover the erroneous data. RS decoder has been successfully simplified to only four sub-modules {{in order to reduce the}} FPGA’s resources utilization. The VHDL modelled RS (255, 191) decoder has the capability of 32 symbol-errors detection and correction. It can be added into the VHDL designer library for future system designs...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{develops}} low-latency, low-complexity {{signal processing}} solutions for systematic source coding, or source coding with side {{information at the}} decoder. We consider an analog source signal transmitted through a hybrid channel that is the composition of two channels: a noisy analog channel through which the source is sent unprocessed and a secondary rate-constrained digital channel; the source is processed prior to transmission through the digital channel. The challenge is to design a <b>digital</b> encoder and <b>decoder</b> that provide a minimum-distortion reconstruction of the source at the decoder, which has observations of analog and digital channel outputs. The methods described in this thesis have importance to {{a wide array of}} applications. For example, in the case of in-band on-channel (IBOC) digital audio broadcast (DAB), an existing noisy analog communications infrastructure may be augmented by a low-bandwidth digital side channel for improved fidelity, while compatibility with existing analog receivers is preserved. Another application is a source coding scheme which devotes a fraction of available bandwidth to the analog source {{and the rest of the}} bandwidth to a digital representation. This scheme is applicable in a wireless communications environment (or any environment with unknown SNR), where analog transmission has the advantage of a gentle roll-off of fidelity with SNR. A very general paradigm for low-latency, low-complexity source coding is composed of three basic cascaded elements: 1) a space rotation, or transformation, 2) quantization, and 3) lossless bitstream coding. The paradigm has been applied with great success to conventional source coding, and it applies equally well to systematic source coding. Focusing on the case involving a Gaussian source, Gaussian channel and mean-squared distortion, we determine optimal or near-optimal components for each of the three elements, each of which has analogous components in conventional source coding. The space rotation can take many forms such as linear block transforms, lapped transforms, or subband decomposition, all for which we derive conditions of optimality. For a very general case we develop algorithms for the design of locally optimal quantizers. For the Gaussian case, we describe a low-complexity scalar quantizer, the nested lattice scalar quantizer, that has performance very near that of the optimal systematic scalar quantizer. Analogous to entropy coding for conventional source coding, Slepian-Wolf coding is shown to be an effective lossless bitstream coding stage for systematic source coding. by Richard J. Barron.
