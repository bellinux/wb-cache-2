A robust linear controller with three inputs and one output stabilized this eigenmode without destabilizing the acoustic mode. The controller facilitated a 1 % reduction in surging mass flow at 95 % N 1 corrected; this increases the engine’s choke to surge stable operating range by 11 %.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis {{research was conducted}} to study the effect of bound­ary layer and mass bleed on the starting (i. e., establishment of supersonic flow) and running of a short length supersonic diffuser for a gas dynamic laser. A one-dimensional diffuser geometry which diffused the flow by an isentropic turn was laid out by the method of characteristics. Extensive boundary layer bleed holes and slots were incorporated in the diffuser walls. Self-actuating, one-way valves installed in the walls bled excess flow during starting. Schlieren flow visualization was obtained through opposite glass diffuser walls. The diffuser was started and Mach 3. 5 flow established in a diffuser with a contraction ratio of 1. 69. This geometry would not start without utilizing boundary layer and mass bleed. A mode of operation called self bleed was discovered. The lower static pressure in the diffuser entrance, via suitable ducting, was used to bleed the boundary layer in the <b>diffuser</b> <b>throat.</b> This method reduced the minimum operating stagnation pressure 17. 0 % without utilizing vacuum tanks or pumps.

40|$|The {{centrifugal}} compressor for a marine use turbocharger with its design pressure ratio of 3. 2 was tested with a vaneless diffuser and various vaned diffusers. Vaned diffusers {{were chosen to}} cover impeller operating range as broad as possible. The analysis of the static pressure ratio in the impeller and the diffusing system, consisting of the diffuser and scroll, showed that there were four possible combinations of characteristics of impeller pressure ratio and diffusing system pressure ratio. The flow rate, QP, where the impeller achieved maximum static pressure ratio, was surge flow rate of the {{centrifugal compressor}} determined by the critical flow rate. In order to operate the compressor at a rate lower than QP, the diffusing system, whose pressure recovery factor was steep negative slope near QP, was needed. When the <b>diffuser</b> <b>throat</b> area {{was less than a}} certain value, the compressor efficiency deterio-rated; however, the compressor stage pressure ratio was almost constant. In this study, by reducing the <b>diffuser</b> <b>throat</b> area, the compressor could be operated at a flow rate less than 40 percent of its design flow rate.

As one of the nation's largest rocket testing facilities, the performance and design limitations of diffusers are of great interest to NASA's Stennis Space Center. This paper describes a series of tests conducted on four diffuser configurations to better understand the effects of inlet geometry and throat area on starting behavior and boundary layer separation. The diffusers were tested for a duration of five seconds with a 1455 -pound thrust, LO 2 /GH 2 thruster to ensure they each reached aerodynamic steady state. The effects of a water spray ring at the diffuser exits and a water-cooled deflector plate were also evaluated. Static pressure and temperature measurements were taken at multiple axial locations along the diffusers, and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations were used as a tool to aid in the interpretation of data. The hot combustion products were confirmed to enable the diffuser start condition with tighter second throats than predicted by historical cold-flow data or the theoretical normal shock method. Both aerodynamic performance and heat transfer were found to increase with smaller <b>diffuser</b> <b>throats.</b> Spray ring and deflector cooling water had negligible impacts on diffuser boundary layer separation.

40|$|Active {{magnetic}} bearings used on oil-free centrifugal refrigeration compressors {{have lower}} stiffness than conventional oil-lubricated journal or rolling element bearings. The lower stiffness of these bearings makes them sensitive to internal flow instabilities that are precursors of rotating stall or compressor surge. At operating conditions {{far away from}} surge the internal flow is very stable and the magnetic bearings keep the shaft centered, resulting in a minimal bearing orbit. The internal flow instabilities that arise when the compressor approaches the surge limit result in some radially fluctuating forces on the shaft. The active magnetic bearings correct for these fluctuating radial forces on the shaft. The bearing orbit increases {{with the size of}} these radial forces. Optimum compressor efficiency occurs close to surge at incipient stall conditions when maximum internal flow pressure recovery occurs. The positional feedback system of the active magnetic bearing control loop system indicates the bearing orbit which relates to compressor efficiency. At high flow conditions capacity is controlled by compressor speed for the imposed pressure ratio. At low flow conditions a combination of variable speed and a means of range extension (e. g. inlet guide vanes, variable geometry diffuser, or flow recirculation) are required to control capacity at the imposed pressure ratio and guarantee stable compressor operation. The bearing orbit signal can be used to determine which speed/geometry combination gives the highest compressor efficiency. If the bearing orbit is below a minimum value the compressor runs too close to choke and a reduction in speed combined with an opening of the <b>diffuser</b> <b>throat</b> area would increase compressor efficiency. If, on the other hand, the bearing orbit is above a maximum value the compressor runs too close to surge and an increase in speed combined with a closing of the <b>diffuser</b> <b>throat</b> area is required to increase compressor efficiency and guarantee surge-free compressor. Experience with this control scheme will be illustrated for a newly developed 350 ton two-stage centrifugal compressor where the variable geometry hardware is replaced with a controlled internal flow recirculation...|$|E

40|$|Second-throat {{diffusers}} {{serve to}} isolate rocket engines {{from the effects}} of ambient back pressure during testing without using active control systems. Among the most critical design parameters is the relative area of the <b>diffuser</b> <b>throat</b> to that of the nozzle throat. A smaller second throat is generally desirable because it decreases the stagnation-to-ambient pressure ratio the diffuser requires for nominal operation. There is a limit, however. Below a certain size, the second throat can cause pressure buildup within the diffuser and prevent it from reaching the start condition that protects the nozzle from side-load damage. This paper presents a method for improved estimation of the minimum second throat area which enables diffuser start. The new 3 -zone model uses traditional quasi-one-dimensional compressible flow theory to approximate the structure of two distinct diffuser flow fields observed in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations and combines them to provide a less-conservative estimate of the second throat size limit. It is unique among second throat sizing methods in that it accounts for all major conical nozzle and second throat diffuser design parameters within its limits of application. The performance of the 3 -zone method is compared to the historical normal shock and force balance methods, and verified against a large number of CFD simulations at specific heat ratios of 1. 4 and 1. 25.

Elevated temperatures allow the matching of the Mach numbers, Reynolds numbers, and ratio of wall-to-adiabatic-wall temperatures (TW/Taw) between this and the Langley 20 -inch Mach 6 CF 4 Tunnel. This ratio is also matched for Langley's 31 -inch Mach 10 Tunnel and is an important parameter useful in the simulation of slender bodies such as National Aerospace Plane (NASP) configurations currently being studied.

This test section is an open-jet type, with an injection system capable of injecting a model from retracted position to nozzle centerline between 0. 5 and 2 seconds. Preliminary calibrations with the new test section resulted in Tunnel blockage. This blockage phenomenon was eliminated when the conical center body in the diffuser was replaced. The issue then, is to provide a new and more efficient variable area diffuser configuration with the capability to withstand testing of larger models without sending the Tunnel into an unstart condition. Use of the 1 -dimensional steady flow equation with due regard to friction and heat transfer was employed to estimate the required area ratios (exit area / throat area) in a variable area diffuser.

A two-stage prototype with cooling capacity 5 kW was optimized and built. Later, the CRMC prescription {{for the design of}} the supersonic diffuser was focused. By a gradual reduction of the fluid velocity and a continuous profile, the CRMC design promises a reduction of the normal shock that usually develops in the mixing chamber. A second 40 kWf prototype was designed in 2010 for an industrial partner (Frigel Firenze s. p. a.). The design procedure used a thermodynamic code accounting for real gas behavior. This code gives a first design of the mixing chamber and diffuser according to the CRMC criterion. It also gives an estimation of the friction loss along the diffuser. A comparison between different operating fluids was performed and resulted in the selection of R 245 fa. A first design of the ejector was manufactured in carbon fiber. The primary nozzle is mounted on a movable support, in order to change its axial position with respect to the mixing chamber. In terms of COP, first results were below the values predicted by the simulation code. Meanwhile a numerical simulation was in progress with FLUENT. From the first CFD results it was decided that the <b>diffuser</b> <b>throat</b> had to be moved forward from the primary nozzle exit, in order to allow a complete mixing between the primary and secondary flows, and enlarged, the losses encountered in the mixing process being higher than expected and hence the fluid density lower. This produced a second ejector design, which was manufactured and tested in 2012, showing improved performance. These results suggested a third design, with a further lengthened diffuser, which has undergone a complete testing campaign, allowing validation of the CFD results. The activity performed till now suggests that ejector refrigeration plants have a robust operation and can be easily manufactured at relatively low cost with off-the-shelf components, a part from the ejector itself, which however represents {{a small fraction of the}} system cost. However, the COP is lower with respect to absorption refrigeration and hence needs substantial improvement through detailed thermodynamic and CFD design optimization...|$|E
40|$|This thesis quantifies the {{relative}} importance of the impeller outflow angle, Mach number, non-uniformity and unsteadiness on diffuser performance, through diffuser experiments in a compressor stage and in a swirling flow test rig combined with steady and unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes computations. The test article is a pressure ratio 5 tur-bocharger compressor with an airfoil vaned diffuser. The swirling flow rig is able to generate rotor outflow conditions representative of the compressor except for the periodic pitchwise unsteadiness, and ts a 0. 86 scale diffuser and volute. In both rigs, the time-mean impeller outflow is mapped across a diffuser pitch using miniaturized traversing probes developed for the purpose. Diffuser performance is well correlated to the average impeller outflow angle when the metric used is effectiveness, which describes the pressure recovery obtained relative to the maximum possible given the average inflow angle, Mach number and the vane exit metal angle. This is reflective of the strong mixing processes that occur in the diffuser inlet region. Utilizing effectiveness captures density changes through the diffuser at higher Mach numbers; a 10 % increase in pressure recovery is observed as the inlet Mach number is increased from 0. 5 to 1. Further, effectiveness is shown to be largely independent of the unsteady pitchwise non-uniformity from the rotor. The observed exception is for operating points with high time-averaged vane incidence. Here, it is hypothesized that excursions into high-loss flow regimes cause a non-linear increase in loss as large unsteady angle variations pass by from the rotor. Given that straight-channel diffuser design charts typically used in preliminary radial vaned diffuser design capture neither streamtube area changes from impeller exit to the <b>diffuser</b> <b>throat</b> nor vane incidence effects, their utility is limited. An alternative approach, utilizing effectiveness and vane leading edge incidence, is proposed. Finally, strong pressure fluctuations downstream of the diffuser vane leading edge, but not upstream, are strongly suggestive of a leading edge vortex previously proposed as the mechanism for short-wavelength stall inception. A preferential location for the stall onset is observed due to the circumferential pressure non-uniformity imposed by the volute. by Jonathan Everitt. Thesis: Ph.
