The concept of functional efficiency is formulated. Based on the examples of cranes of different types, there were shown the formation features of structural interrelationships of large assembly units of crane constructions; the example of synthe-sis of the corresponding structural formulas is provided; the building of the mathematical model of functional interac-tion of large assembly units inside the crane is shown; the matrix of interaction is semantically decoded...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Mast crane {{integral}} installation technology {{is one of}} the ten new technologies in the construction field, which are put forward by the ministry of construction and are in key application. It is widely applied in the field of construction engineering. However, at present, the design of the mast crane hoisting is generally based on traditional mechanical model and adopts manual calculation, which is lack of safety and reliability, and the model needs to be perfect. As a result, this paper studies the lattice mast crane hoisting system, explores and improves the traditional mechanical model, and develops the lattice mast hoisting aided design system (WGCAD 1. 0), {{in order to meet the}} design requirements. Main content includes: introduction to the development in engineering of the lattice mast <b>hoisting</b> <b>crane</b> and the application status in hoisting engineering of computer technology; introduction of the development environment of ViusalBasi 6. 0 and Access database which are used in cad system development of the lattice mast hoisting. By using the reasonable lattice mast lifting design mechanics model, from the lattice mast hoisting system designer's perspective, the software adopts Visual Basic 6. 0 development environment and Microsoft Access database as development tools, the design idea of engineering design are simulated...|$|E
