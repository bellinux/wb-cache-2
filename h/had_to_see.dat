5|$|In 1955 the Bergen businessperson Fritz Rieber {{launched}} {{an idea for}} the shortening of Bergensbanen; the Ulriken Tunnel through the Bergen mountains, electrification from Voss to Bergen, {{and the construction of}} the Ringerike Line. Private financing would be provided through a dedicated limited company taking a surcharge on tickets, equal to the reduction in fare induced by the shorter line; within twenty years the debt would be covered. Passed by parliament in 1955, a year later they had changed their minds and only the investments around Bergen were supported; removing the support for Ringerike. Prime Minister Trygve Bratteli commented that private debt financing would have to compete with the debt taken up by the government on other railway projects, since politicians <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the national economy as a whole, and that private financing would not allow more lines to be built. The cost was estimated at NOK 100 million.|$|E
5|$|At 03:00, {{just before}} dawn, Spragg took {{command of the}} trench in the {{southern}} sector of No.3 Post, opposite where the Turks appeared to be gathering their forces to assault the post. He successfully deployed his men {{so that when the}} attack began, it was met and broken up by the New Zealanders' small arms fire. But by 03:30 the post was under sustained Turkish rifle and grenade attack and the relieving 2nd Squadron was still held up on a ridge to the south of the post. Between them and No.3 Post was a strong Turkish force which had dug in and were in communication with the Turkish attackers in the gully {{to the north of the}} post. However, the 2nd Squadron could now bring their own small arms fire onto the Turks attacking No.3 Post, making them keep their heads down. At daylight Elmslie led a troop in an attack which captured a Turkish trench to the left of the post. At 06:30 communications were re-established with No.3 Post by using signal flags, and Allied artillery were able to bring harassing fire onto the Turkish communications trenches. But by now the defenders were running short of supplies, especially ammunition, and no one could be spared to look after the wounded, who <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> to themselves.|$|E

25|$|Despite Graeme Smith {{making a}} 53-ball century, and pairing up with Matthew Wood for 129 {{for the first}} wicket, Somerset Sabres still lost the match at Taunton. Smith's 105 helped Somerset set a target of 190, {{but none of the}} bowlers conceded less than seven an over to Northamptonshire Steelbacks' batting. Simon Francis was the worst, ending with 57 conceded runs in four overs, while Riki Wessels hit 49 not out with four sixes off 22 balls, and the Sabres <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that Northamptonshire won with an over to spare.|$|E

25|$|Newland toured England in 1905 as {{a reserve}} wicket-keeper and {{understudy}} to Jim Kelly. While in the United Kingdom {{he played in}} 10 first-class matches with the Australian team, but could only score 67 runs at 9.57 and effect 13 dismissals. His disappointing performances may have been {{as a result of}} an eye injury he received during the trip over, which was bad enough that he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> an oculist in London. He had earlier, in 1904/05, toured New Zealand and played two matches against the national team. At that stage, New Zealand weren't a Test playing country so the matches had only first-class status.|$|E

25|$|The chase {{was never}} really on for Bangladesh, who kept their run rate {{steadily}} above 4 an over but <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the required rate explode to nearly nine an over. When {{that happened in the}} 28th over, and the score was at 121 for 2, the Bangladeshis tried to hit out, and duly lost three wickets to Dilshan's off spin. Shahriar Nafees was first to fall to Dilshan's spin, having made his second ODI fifty in six games, while Rafique and Ashraful followed shortly afterwards. Forced onto the back foot with the score 140 for 5, Bangladesh put on substitute Tushar Imran, who joined in a partnership of 71 with Bashar in 13 overs. However, the pair scored too slowly to have any chance of winning, instead just trying to save face. Sri Lanka saved their pace bowlers again, opting for Dilshan, Upul Chandana and even the medium pace of Mahela Jayawardene, as they used eight of their eleven possible bowlers in the innings.|$|E

25|$|In the 1840s, {{when the}} {{railways}} reached {{the coasts of}} Picardy, Normandy and Brittany, the market changed suddenly. The railway saw to the rapid transit aspect of the trade. The chasse-marée vehicle was redundant {{on the main road}} routes but was still used more locally. The important thing then was for the fisherman to make his landing in time to catch the early morning train which took the product to the morning markets in inland towns. In order to make a living, he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that with or without wind, he was ashore in time. He would therefore choose his fishing ground and the time of leaving it with a view to how the tide would carry him to the fish quay for 4 a.m. or thereabouts. Nonetheless, now that he was working to city time rather than the tide, the railway fish quay had to be accessible at all states of the tide. Over the years, the canneries took ever more of his catch so that missing the train did not represent a total loss.|$|E

Armitage himself had been the first actor to read {{for the role}} of John Thornton and even though his performance had impressed producer Kate Bartlett and casting director Jill Trevellick, they still <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> many other possible Thorntons.

If Hamilton's administrative republic was to succeed, Americans <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> themselves as nation citizens, and experience an administration that proved firm and demonstrated the concepts found within the United States Constitution.

500|$|IGN's regular Fringe {{reviewer}} Ramsey Isler {{rated the}} episode 8/10. He compared the plot to Lost, remarking [...] "Apparently one thoroughly confusing and unnecessarily convoluted TV series wasn't enough... But hey, I understand why J.J. and his Fringe collaborators... {{might have done}} this. They had kind of written themselves into a corner {{where one of the}} universes had to go, and they couldn't stretch that storyline out forever. A restart like this {{is a good way to}} allow themselves room to write something new, even if it may require some clever thinking to explain themselves out of this situation adequately."

500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed at the Warner Bros. Television studios in Burbank, California on October 15, 1997.

The Full Monty cast members came to the set to offer advice and watch the taping. The remainder of the episode was filmed before an audience later that same night. Gomez quipped that having two guys paint his body in make-up was [...] "more embarrassing" [...] than filming the routine, while Stiles joked that the episode {{was the first time}} he had been [...] "totally naked" [...] since he was cast in the show. Carey admitted that he was grateful that stripping during prime-time had to be PG and apologized that viewers <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> his naked buttocks. He also clarified that the cast wore pouches to protect their modesty.|$|E
500|$|Temple and Davies {{thought that}} the episode was not a [...] "fun reappearance" [...] of an old monster; instead, they {{felt that there was}} [...] "an actual story to tell". Temple {{emphasised}} in his script that the Doctor overlooked the Ood under the shadow of the Devil, and the character <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> his shortcomings. Temple's script also emphasised the Ood's slavery; both Temple and lead actor David Tennant commented that the existence of a species born to serve was complicated, the latter stating complications with Richard Dawkins' selfish gene theory. Donna's role in the episode was to further humanise the Doctor, and her opinion of the Ood changing from her initial disgust at their appearance to empathy for them was important to the episode and her character development. Susie Liggat cited the writing as part of Doctor Whos importance—she thought the story about [...] "liberating oppressed people" [...] could be applied domestically or globally.|$|E

500|$|Still {{hoping to}} work on Cheers, Mirkin sent a spec script of an episode of Taxi to Cheers writers Ken Levine and David Isaacs. The two {{approved}} and offered Mirkin a freelance job writing one of the final nine episodes of the show's first season, pending their commissioning by NBC. The episodes were commissioned, but Mirkin's agent rejected the Cheers job without telling his client, failing to see why Mirkin would want {{to work on}} {{what was then the}} lowest-rated comedy on television. Mirkin sacked the agent and signed on with Robb Rothman. Rothman knew Dan Wilcox, the executive producer of Newhart, which like Cheers was more character-focused. Rothman persuaded Wilcox to hire Mirkin. Mirkin wrote a freelance script and in 1984 beat seven other writers to a staff position on the series. He served as a writer and supervising story editor, before being promoted to executive producer and showrunner after one and a half years. Mirkin [...] "felt [...] was where I belonged. I'd finally come to a place in my life where everything I'd ever wanted had come together." [...] In 1987, he received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series for Newhart. It was the first nomination the show had received in that category and for the first episode Mirkin wrote as the series' showrunner. Mirkin directed several of the Newhart episodes he wrote because he saw directing as [...] "a means of protecting the writing". A philosophy he carried into his later work, Mirkin felt that [...] "being the head writer... was not enough; you <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the material through its execution– especially the weirder stuff. You had to be right there to make sure every sick idea didn't lose any disturbing nuance." [...] Mirkin left Newhart in 1988, desiring to work on a single-camera sitcom.|$|E
500|$|The {{anniversary of}} the game was not widely commemorated until its silver anniversary in 1987. By that time, the NBA had grown to be a popular sports league with average {{attendance}} of 13,000 fans per game and star players like Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, and Michael Jordan. The Warriors' PR director Harvey Pollack said an impossible 40,000 people claimed to have seen the game, and some even testified it took place in Madison Square Garden. Chamberlain later stated {{it was one of}} his favorite games, but not the favorite: that title belonged to the match in which he grabbed an NBA record 55 rebounds against perennial rival Bill Russell. He did not want to feed the criticism that he was more interested in personal stardom than winning. Although Chamberlain won two NBA championships and was the NBA's all-time leading scorer and rebounder when he retired, he was mostly remembered as the man who had single-handedly scored 100 points in a game. Chamberlain publicly embraced the 100-point game in his final years. On a radio show commemorating the game's 31st anniversary in 1993, he said, [...] "As time goes by, I feel more a part of that 100-point game." [...] He explained that growing up on the streets, he would have been derisively labelled a gunner, a glory-hound, for attempting 63shots. [...] "You take that many shots on the playground, and no one ever wants you on their team again." [...] He said he took shots he normally would not, noting that in contests which he considered to be better he scored 50 to 60 points on around 75 percent shooting, as opposed to his 57 percent shooting in the 100-point game. He was proud that people who knew nothing about basketball would point out the game to their kids when they saw him. [...] "I know that it has been my tag. I am definitely proud of it. But it was definitely a team effort. You <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> some of the things my teammates did to get me the ball ... It was almost like a circus out there for a while." ...|$|E
