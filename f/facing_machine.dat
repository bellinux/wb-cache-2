We derive soft constraints from the source de-pendency parsing to directly address the re-ordering problem for the hierarchical phrase-based model.

Moreover, when we switch the tuning function from BLEU to the LRscore which promotes reordering, we observe total improvements of 1. 21 BLEU, 1. 30 LRscore and 3. 36 TER over the baseline.

40|$|AbstractStandard {{univariate}} {{analyses of}} brain imaging data have revealed {{a host of}} structural and functional brain alterations in schizophrenia. However, these analyses typically involve examining each voxel separately and making inferences at group-level, thus limiting clinical translation of their findings. Taking into account the fact that brain alterations in schizophrenia expand over a widely distributed network of brain regions, univariate analysis methods {{may not be the}} most suited choice for imaging data analysis. To address these limitations, the neuroimaging community has turned to machine learning methods both because of their ability to examine voxels jointly and their potential for making inferences at a single-subject level. This article provides a critical overview of the current and foreseeable applications of machine learning, in identifying imaging-based biomarkers that could be used for the diagnosis, early detection and treatment response of schizophrenia, and could, thus, be of high clinical relevance. We discuss promising future research directions and the main difficulties <b>facing</b> <b>machine</b> learning researchers as far as their potential translation into clinical practice is concerned...|$|E
40|$|Setting {{aside the}} {{problems}} of recognising consciousness in a machine, this article considers what would be needed for a machine to have human-like consciousness. Human-like consciousness is an illusion; that is, it exists but {{is not what it}} appears to be. The illusion that we are a conscious self having a stream of experiences is constructed when memes compete for replication by human hosts. Some memes survive by being promoted as personal beliefs, desires, opinions and possessions, leading to the formation of a memeplex (or selfplex). Any machine capable of imitation would acquire this type of illusion and think it was conscious. Robots that imitated humans would acquire an illusion of self and consciousness just as we do. Robots that imitated each other would develop their own separate languages, cultures and illusions of self. Distributed seflplexes in large networks of machines are also possible. Unanswered questions include what remains of consciousness without memes, and whether artificial meme machines can ever transcend the illusion of self consciousness. I am going to set aside some of the major problems <b>facing</b> <b>machine</b> consciousnes...|$|E

To process variously workpiece according to shape, size and materials, the rotating and contacting forces of the developed grinding machine can be changed by air pressure. The surface roughness of processed workpiece can be also attained to state of mirror face by grinding precisely the sliding face with changing the rotating speed of diamond wheel. It is possible to {{be attached to the}} various machine tools because the super-mirror <b>face</b> grinding <b>machine</b> using variable air pressure is a small size. The grinding efficiency is elevated because it can be worked by two or more grinding machines attached to concurrently a machine tool for the large workpiece. In this study, results show that the cusp height of the super-mirror <b>face</b> grinding <b>machine</b> for the particle size of 100 and 1500 No. /mm 2 is lower than that of the conventional one because the vibration is reduced by rotating very fast the diamond wheel with a pressed air and it can be processed by rotating the diamond wheel with a constantly varied air pressure perpendicular to workpiece surface, and that the workpiece in the super-mirror <b>face</b> grinding <b>machine</b> for the particle size of 3000 No. /mm 2 can be processed to state of mirror face that is rarely seen by the cusp height.

40|$|To date {{there has}} only been one {{implementation}} of Holland's Learning Classifier System (LCS) on real robots. In this paper the use of Wilson's ZCS system is described for an obstacle avoidance task. Although the task is simple it does present some advances and change of emphasis over the previous LCS robotic implementation. The controller model is "event" based. Instead of the robot being assigned fixed length actions, continuous actions are taken. These actions are taken until an "event" occurs. An event {{can be thought of}} as a change of state. This division of the world into states is usually part of the problem description, and to do this automatically is currently one of the challenges <b>facing</b> <b>machine</b> learning. The paper then introduces TCS, a form of ZCS that attempts to address this issue. LCS have the ability to generalise over the state action-space. In TCS this generalisation ability can also be used to determine the extent of this space. TCS also implements components from SMDP reinforcement learning theory to weight the influence of time on the reward functions of the LCS. A simple light-seeking task on the robot platform using TCS is presented which demonstrates desirable adaptive characteristics for the use of LCS on real robots...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge of the {{accuracies}} of {{air bearing}} spindles in the sub-micrometre to nanometre range {{is required for}} the design, commissioning and operation of ultra-precise machine tools, measurement systems and other machines employing high precision rotational motion. In order to verify the dynamic performance of a spindle, measurement is required of its error motions in the unwanted five degrees of freedom (one axial, two tilts and two radial motions). Presentation of these error motions (eg in the form of polar charts) can then be used to provide critical spindle metrology data including total, asynchronous and average error motion rosette profiles and their average and peak values. This thesis describes a metrology system based on optical interferometry for measuring such unwanted error motions in three degrees of freedom involving motion along the spindle axis (axial rectilinear displacement and tilts about orthogonal axes), incurred with rotation of a precision air spindle over its specified speed-range. The system is not sensitive to orthoaxial translations which may be measured using alternative methods. Possible alternative techniques for measuring any of the degrees of freedom include an array of proximity sensors, (one for each translational degree of freedom and a further one for each of the other rotational degrees of freedom), to measure the run-out of an artefact. Proximity sensors based upon capacitive or optical fibre back-scatter techniques each offer the required single degree-of-freedom non-contacting capability and bandwidth. In the current work, a Fizeau interferometer is used to monitor the motion of the spindle of a vertical axis ultra-precision <b>facing</b> <b>machine</b> using a test-artefact. This is a mirror with less than one fringe departure from planarity from which interferogram. fringe-patterns are captured, digitised and analysed synchronously as the spindle rotates. The issue of the prediction of the dynamic form and motions of the observed interferograrn arises and the earlier theory is extended to optimise the set-up, including provision of automatic servo- alignment of the optical axis with the axis of the spindle. Measurement interferograrn data is sampled at selected angular incremental positions of spindle-rotation and image processing techniques used to filter the fringe pattern, enabling measurement of spindle tilt and axial displacement. Issues of sampling with respect to the anticipated spatial angular frequency of the spindle run-out are considered with respect to the speed/frequency capability of data-acquisition and processing arrangements. Essentially, with a spindle rotating at typical machining speeds of 300 - 3000 rev/min, for consistent error motions, the resolution of an error plot is principally a function of observational time. It is foreseen that the system will be applicable in research and production-support in ultra-precision machining production processes and in rotational metrology...|$|E
