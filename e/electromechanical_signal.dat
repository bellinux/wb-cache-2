40|$|A This work {{presents}} unreleased RF bulk acoustic resonators using Deep Trench (DT) capacitors {{for both}} transduction and acoustic isolation. While {{the majority of}} Si MEMS resonators require a release step to freely suspend the resonant cavity, these unreleased resonators are formed entirely in solid media. This {{eliminates the need for}} complex release steps and costly packaging. The resonators use 1 D periodic DT structures etched into a bulk Si substrate for both electrostatic transduction and to form Acoustic Bragg Reflectors (ABRs) for energy localization. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Deep Trenches as ABRs, and provide analysis, simulation, and experimental verification of their use for high-Q resonators. A 3. 3 GHz unreleased Si resonator is demonstrated with Q of 2057 and motional impedance RX of 1. 2 kΩ.

Piezoelectric force microscopy is used to investigate both the in-plane and out-of- plane <b>electromechanical</b> <b>signals</b> around domain walls in congruent and near-stoichiometric lithium niobate. The observed asymmetry is shown {{to have a strong}} correlation to crystal stoichiometry, suggesting defect-domain wall interactions. A defect-dipole model is proposed. Finite element method is used to simulate the electromechanical processes at the wall and reconstruct the images. For the near-stoichiometric composition, good agreement is found in both form and magnitude. Some discrepancy remains between the experimental and modeling widths of the imaged effects across a wall.

The development of a rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective nucleic acid detection platform is sought for the detection of pathogenic microbes in food, water and body fluids. Since 16 S rRNA sequences are species specific and are present at high copy number in viable cells, these nucleic acids offer an attractive target for microbial pathogen detection schemes. Here, target 16 S rRNA of E. coli at 10 fM concentration was detected against a total RNA background using a conceptually simple approach based on <b>electromechanical</b> <b>signal</b> transduction, whereby a step change reduction in ionic current through a pore indicates blockage by an electrophoretically mobilized bead-peptide nucleic acid probe conjugate hybridized to target nucleic acid. We investigated the concentration detection limit for bacterial species-specific 16 S rRNA at 1 pM to 1 fM and found a limit of detection of 10 fM for our device, which is consistent with our previous finding with single-stranded DNA of similar length. In addition, no false positive responses were obtained with control RNA and no false negatives with target 16 S rRNA present down to the limit of detection (LOD) of 10 fM. Thus, this detection scheme shows promise for integration into portable, low-cost systems for rapid detection of pathogenic microbes in food, water and body fluids...|$|E
40|$|Monitoring of {{respiratory}} effort is paramount {{in the clinical}} diagnostic recording of sleep. Increased respiratory effort {{is a sign of}} obstructive sleep-disordered breathing and is associated with arousals from sleep. Respiration is the result of muscle activity that induces negative intrathoracic pressure and expansion of the thoracic and abdominal cavities. Therefore respiratory effort may be recorded from mechanical, electrical and <b>electromechanical</b> <b>signals.</b> Several techniques are available for the recording {{of respiratory}} effort. Monitoring of esophageal pressure is still the method of choice, as the pressure signal directly reflects the respiratory muscle force. However, esophageal pressure monitoring is cumbersome and may be replaced with noninvasive techniques. In order to be reliable, these techniques must be validated against the esophageal pressure standard. The present review presents a concise description of the technical principles and, if available, a comparison with esophageal pressure data, based on a systematic literature search. Most data are available on respiratory inductance plethysmography, and confirm that this technique is suitable for routine diagnostic investigation of respiratory effort during sleep. Pulse transit time, diaphragmatic electromyography, snoring loudness, suprasternal pressure monitoring, midsagittal jaw movement and forehead venous pressure monitoring are promising alternative techniques although only limited validation is available...|$|R

40|$|Concrete {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{materials}} used to construct a variety of civil infrastructures. However, since concrete might be susceptible to brittle fracture, it is essential to confirm the strength of concrete at the early-age stage of the curing process to prevent unexpected collapse. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel method to estimate the early-age strength of concrete, by integrating an artificial neural network algorithm with a dynamic response measurement of the concrete material. The dynamic response signals of the concrete, including both electromechanical impedances and guided ultrasonic waves, are obtained from an embedded piezoelectric sensor module. The cross-correlation coefficient of the <b>electromechanical</b> impedance <b>signals</b> and the amplitude of the guided ultrasonic wave signals are selected to quantify the variation in dynamic responses according to the strength of the concrete. Furthermore, an artificial neural network algorithm is used to verify a relationship between the variation in dynamic response signals and concrete strength. The results of an experimental study confirm that the proposed approach can be effectively applied to estimate the strength of concrete material from the early-age stage of the curing process...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- The {{proposed}} {{diagnostic method}} {{is based on}} signal processing procedures applied to information coming from the structure under investigation and generated by both natural and designed stimuli which may also be different in nature. The discrimination of signals acquired by each sensor and coming contemporarily from different sources allows to identify various anomalies in the {{different parts of the}} structure. An effective mathematical procedure is proposed with an aim to distinguish the contribution of each source from the entire information collected. After a preliminary calibration performed using designed stimulation, the diagnostic system is applied to apparatuses under normal operating conditions through the following steps: data acquisition by means of sensors and transducers; processing and discrimination of the acquired data using specific analysis software; comparisons of the processed information so as to isolate common characteristics and consequently identify significant diagnostic parameters; data post-processing to recognize a number of belonging classes so as to define the state of the different parts of the structure. The method was applied with slight changes to diagnose a number of different electromechanical structures such as power transformers, circuit breakers, railway components, joints and terminations of MV and HV cables.

40|$|An {{approach}} for combined imaging of elastic and electromechanical properties of materials, {{referred to as}} piezoacoustic scanning probe microscopy (PA-SPM), is presented. Applicability of this technique for elastic and electromechanical imaging with nanoscale resolution in such dissimilar materials as ferroelectrics and biological tissues is demonstrated. The PA-SPM signal formation is analyzed based on the theory of nanoelectromechanics of piezoelectric indentation and signal sensitivity to materials properties and imaging conditions. It is shown that simultaneous measurements of local indentation stiffness and indentation piezocoefficient provide the most complete description of the local electroelastic properties for transversally isotropic materials, thus making piezoacoustic SPM a comprehensive imaging and analysis tool.

Concerning the balance laws, the simplest form consisting of balance of momentum and Gauss' Law was derived by physically motivated assumptions step by step from nonlinear thermomechanics and Maxwell's Equations.

40|$|A Hemispherical Resonator Gyro (HRG) is the Coriolis Vibratory Gyro (CVG) that {{measures}} rotation angle or angular velocity using Coriolis force acting the vibrating mass. A HRG {{can be used}} as a rate gyro or integrating gyro without structural modification by simply changing the control scheme. In this paper, differential control algorithms are designed for a 2 -piece HRG. To design a precision controller, the <b>electromechanical</b> modelling and <b>signal</b> processing must be pre-performed accurately. Therefore, the equations of motion for the HRG resonator with switched harmonic excitations are derived with the Duhamel Integral method. Electromechanical modeling of the resonator, electric module and charge amplifier is performed by considering the mode shape of a thin hemispherical shell. Further, signal processing and control algorithms are designed. The multi-flexing scheme of sensing, driving cycles and x, y-axis switching cycles is appropriate for high precision and low maneuverability systems. The differential control scheme is easily capable of rejecting the common mode errors of x, y-axis signals and changing the rate integrating mode on basis of these studies. In the rate gyro mode the controller is composed of Phase-Locked Loop (PLL), amplitude, quadrature and rate control loop. All controllers are designed on basis of a digital PI controller.

5000|$|... 1. Digital ArchitecturePrior art and {{traditional}} signal timing methods and responsive adaptive systems use {{the concepts of}} cycle lengths, splits and offsets. These are components of the analog signal control architecture that was developed with the very earliest <b>electromechanical</b> traffic <b>signal</b> controllers. If the window for serving a particular phase has already passed, that vehicle will not be served until the controller has moved {{all the way through}} its sequences and returns to the allowed window for that phase. For example, a minor street call comes in {{near the end of the}} minor street window but it is too late for the minor street to be served before returning to the main street left turn phase. The minor street will not be served until the cycle goes all the way around the “dial”. This is a direct result of the fact that the controller is operating in an analog fashion. InSync is a digital finite state machine. Its patent-protected digital model is fully digital and is able to initiate any phase at will.2. Global OptimizerThe power in the Global Optimizer is built on the foundation of the digital architecture. The Global Optimizer model creates time tunnels through the entire corridor and if a vehicle is within the time tunnel, it can travel through the entire corridor without stopping. The longest corridor currently (November, 2015) is 26 signals on Washington Road in Richmond and Columbia Counties, GA. Commuters experience the phenomenon of driving through 26 signals in both East and West directions without stopping.3. Local OptimizerThe local optimizer is built on a greedy algorithm. Imagine a person standing at an intersection with a basket of cookies. The person has to give a cookie for every vehicle that arrives at the intersection. The person also has to give another cookie every time a vehicle waits 5 seconds. However, the person is greedy. He has the power to change the traffic signals so that he can conserve the cookies. This is the function that optimizes the traffic signals based on the number of cars waiting for green (volume) and the duration of their wait (delay). Since InSync processors are distributed without any central control, the local optimizer ensures a very high degree of green optimization.Installation and Configuration of InSync ...|$|R
40|$|How nerves {{transmit}} their {{signals to}} regulate activity of smooth muscle is of fundamental importance to autonomic and enteric physiology, clinical medicine, and therapeutics. A traditional view of neurotransmission to smooth muscles {{has been that}} motor nerve varicosities release neurotransmitters that act on receptors on smooth muscles to cause their contraction or relaxation via <b>electromechanical</b> and pharmacomechanical <b>signaling</b> pathways in the smooth muscle. In recent years, an old hypothesis that certain interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) may transduce neural signals to smooth muscle cells has been resurrected. This later hypothesis is based on indirect evidence of closer proximity and presence of synapses between the nerve varicosities and ICC, gap junctions between ICC and smooth muscles, and presence of receptors and signaling pathways for the neurotransmitters and ICC. This indirect evidence is at best circumstantial. The direct evidence {{is based on the}} reports of loss of neurotransmission in mutant animals lacking ICC due to c-Kit receptor deficiency. However, a critical analysis of the recent data show that animals lacking ICC have normal cholinergic and purinergic neurotransmission and tachykinergic neurotransmission is actually increased. The status of nitrergic neurotransmission in c-Kit deficient animals has been controversial. However, reports suggest that 1) nitrergic neurotransmission in the internal anal sphincter does not require ICC and 2) the in vivo phenotype of ICC deficiency does not resemble nNOS deficiency. 3) The most recent report, in this issue of the Journal, concludes that impaired nitrergic neurotransmission may be due to smooth muscle defects associated with c-Kit receptor deficiency...|$|R

Alterations in gastrointestinal tissues from DMD patients and mdx mice are not yet completely understood. Thus, we investigated the possible relationships between morphological (light and electron microscopy) and contractile function (by recording the isometric contractile response) with alterations in Ca 2 + handling in the ileum of mdx mice. We evidenced a 27 % reduction in the ileal muscular layer thickness, a partial damage to the mucosal layer, and a partial damage to mitochondria of the intestinal myocytes. Functionally, the ileum from mdx presented an enhanced responsiveness during stretch, a mild impairment in both the <b>electromechanical</b> and pharmacomechanical <b>signaling</b> associated with altered calcium influxinduced contraction, with no alterations in the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 + storage (maintenance of the caffeine and thapsigargin-induced contraction) compared with control animals.
