5|$|A Jonline {{is a short}} line used by scuba divers {{to fasten}} {{themselves}} to something. The original purpose was to fasten a diver to a shot line during decompression stops <b>in</b> <b>current.</b> The line is typically around 1m (3 feet) long and equipped with a clip at each end. One clip is fastened to the diver's harness, {{and the other is}} used to fasten the line to the anchor line. <b>In</b> <b>current</b> this relieves the diver from holding on to the anchor line during the decompression stop.|$|E
5|$|After the 1913 season, Evers {{was offered}} $100,000 ($ <b>in</b> <b>current</b> dollar terms) {{to jump to}} the Federal League, but he opted to take less money to remain with the Cubs. In February 1914, after Evers signed his players to contracts, Murphy fired Evers as manager and traded him to the Boston Braves for Bill Sweeney and Hub Perdue. Murphy insisted that Evers had {{resigned}} as manager, which Evers denied. Evers insisted he was a free agent, but the league assigned him to the Braves. He signed a four-year contract at $10,000 per season ($ <b>in</b> <b>current</b> dollar terms), with a $20,000 signing bonus.|$|E

He served as player-manager for the Cubs in 1915, but was released when his batting average slipped. As the rival Federal League collapsed and the Cubs merged with the Chicago Whales of the Federal League, the Cubs decided to replace Bresnahan with Whales manager Joe Tinker.|$|E

He served as player-manager the Tigers {{at the start of the}} 1913 season, but stepped down as manager, hiring Russ Hall to serve as manager in June.

McGinnity considered retiring from baseball, but ultimately jumped to the AL, signing with the Baltimore Orioles of the AL before the 1901 season. He received a salary of $2,800 ($ <b>in</b> <b>current</b> dollar terms), choosing less money in an upstart league for the chance to be reunited with McGraw, who was player-manager and part-owner of the Orioles.|$|E

40|$|The <b>currents</b> <b>in</b> three <b>current</b> paths (14, 15, 16) can be {{controlled}} by a phase shifter for alternating currents to shift the phase of an input signal by means of field effect transistors (7, 8, 10, 11) whose gates are connected to phase lines (9, 12) of the input signal. The strength {{and the relationship of}} the intensities between the currents of identical size <b>in</b> the <b>current</b> paths (14, 15) and the <b>current</b> <b>in</b> the <b>current</b> path (16) are preset by means of a control circuit. An alternating current coupling device (13) is switched between the current paths (14, 15) so that a phase shift occurs between the <b>currents</b> <b>in</b> the <b>current</b> paths (14, 15) and the <b>current</b> <b>in</b> the <b>current</b> path (16). The output currents from the field-effect transistors (7, 8, 10, 11) are superimposed cross-wise in a superimposition circuit (3) in each phase line (21, 22) of the output signal which is also shifted in phase in relation to the input signal in the phase lines (9, 12) ...|$|R
