5000|$|The splake or slake (Salvelinus {{namaycush}} X Salvelinus fontinalis) is {{a hybrid}} of two fish species resulting from the crossing of a male brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and a female lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush). The name itself is a portmanteau of speckled trout (another name for brook trout) and lake trout, {{and may have been}} used to describe such hybrids as early as the 1880s. Hybrids of the male lake trout with the female brook trout (the so-called [...] "brookinaw") have also been produced, but are not as successful.The <b>intrageneric</b> hybrid is of the genus Salvelinus and, hence, is most properly known as a char or charr. In some locales, the fish {{is referred to as the}} wendigo. Although the hybrid is genetically stable and is, theoretically, capable of reproducing, splake reproduction is extremely rare, for behavioural reasons, outside the hatchery environment. The only known natural reproduction has occurred in five lakes in Algonquin Provincial Park in Ontario, Canada and, in each case, only a handful of progeny were produced. Because splake typically do not reproduce, they are used as a sport fish in many lakes across the US. Fishery managers are able to control populations numbers due to the extremely poor spawning success rate.|$|E

40|$|Most human oral viridans streptococci {{participate}} in <b>intrageneric</b> coaggregations, the cell-to-cell adherence among genetically distinct streptococci. Two genes relevant to these <b>intrageneric</b> coaggregations {{were identified by}} transposon Tn 916 mutagenesis of Streptococcus gordonii DL 1 (Challis). A 626 -bp sequence flanking the left end of the transposon was homologous to dltA and dltB of Lactobacillus rhamnosus ATCC 7469 (formerly called Lactobacillus casei). A 60 -kb probe based on this flanking sequence was used to identify the homologous DNA in a fosmid library of S. gordonii DL 1. This DNA encoded d-alanine-d-alanyl carrier protein ligase that was expressed in Escherichia coli from the fosmid clone. The cloned streptococcal dltA was disrupted by inserting an ermAM cassette, {{and then it was}} linearized and transformed into S. gordonii DL 1 for allelic replacement. Erythromycin-resistant transformants containing a single insertion in dltA exhibited a loss of d-alanyl esters in lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and a loss of <b>intrageneric</b> coaggregation. This phenotype was correlated with the loss of a 100 -kDa surface protein reported previously to be involved in mediating <b>intrageneric</b> coaggregation (C. J. Whittaker, D. L. Clemans, and P. E. Kolenbrander, Infect. Immun. 64 : 4137 – 4142, 1996). The mutants retained the parental ability to {{participate in}} intergeneric coaggregation with human oral actinomyces, indicating the specificity of the mutation in altering <b>intrageneric</b> coaggregations. The mutants were altered morphologically and exhibited aberrant cell septa in a variety of pleomorphs. The natural DNA transformation frequency was reduced 10 -fold in these mutants. Southern analysis of chromosomal DNAs from various streptococcal species with the dltA probe revealed the presence of this gene in most viridans streptococci. Thus, it is hypothesized that d-alanyl LTA may provide binding sites for the putative 100 -kDa adhesin and scaffolding for the proper presentation of this adhesin to mediate <b>intrageneric</b> coaggregation...|$|E

Cuticle structure {{was used to test}} some current hypotheses of phylogeny of Heteroderidae and to evaluate <b>intrageneric</b> variability in cuticle layering. Verutus, Rhizonema, and Meloidodera possess striated cuticle surfaces and have the simplest layering, suggesting that striations have not necessarily arisen repeatedly in Heteroderidae through convergent or parallel evolution. Atalodera and Thecavermiculatus possess similar cuticles with derived characteristics, strengthening the hypothesis that the two genera are sister groups. Similarly, the cuticle of Cactodera resembles the specialized cuticle of Globodera and Punctodera in having a basal layer (D) and a surface layer infused with electron-dense substance. Heterodera betulae has a unique cuticle in which the thickest layer (C) is infiltrated with an electron-dense matrix. Little <b>intrageneric</b> difference was found between cuticles of two species of Meloidodera or between two species of Atalodera. However, Atalodera ucri has a basal layer (E) not found in other Heteroderidae.

40|$|Daphniphyllum is {{the sole}} genus of the family Daphniphyllaceae {{consisting}} of dioecious species with inconspicuous reduced unisexual mostly caducous flowers. The paucity of helpful taxonomic characters from vegetative and reduced reproductive organs has led to difficulties in <b>intrageneric</b> classification and species identification. The pistillate flowers have characters of higher taxonomic value {{than those of the}} vegetative organs, staminate flowers and fruits, but pistillate flower information is rarely reported. Here pistillate flowers of 19 taxa were studied to reveal pistillate floral diversity and major developmental features with a view to <b>intrageneric</b> classification. Four types of stigma shape were recognized: punctiform, reniform, linear and oblong. Daphniphyllum stigmas, except for the punctiform type, elongate variously after an early stage of anthesis. The pistillate flowers of three taxa are asepalus. The calyces of other taxa were categorized into three types, free, cleft and parted, which are consistent within taxa. The existence and persistence of staminodes are diagnostic characters. This study shows that the characteristics of pistillate flowers provide helpful information for identification at the species and even the variety level. Our results do not support the currently accepted two sections, Daphniphyllum and Lunata.

The incidence of polyploidy is discussed in relation to taxonomic groups, their phylogenetic position, habit classes and phytogeographic regions. The more archaic subfamilies i. e. Caesalpinioideae and Mimosoideae show the retention of higher basic numbers (x= 12 - 14) with secondary cycle of polyploidy non-existent in the former (in our sample) while exhibited by some species like Acacia spp., and Prosopis juliflora in the latter. In Papilionoideae, the comparatively archaic tribes like Sophoreae and Millettieae exhibit higher basic numbers, but more advanced herbaceous tribes have lower basic numbers (x= 6 - 8). In habit classes, woody species show the retention of high basic numbers with little <b>intrageneric</b> polyploidy (1. 92 %), while the herbaceous and weedy species show lower basic numbers but higher <b>intrageneric</b> polyploidy. The highest percentage of intragenetic polyploidy among various habit types in the sample is met with in annual herbs (3. 8 %), which are mostly weedy species belonging to the tribes Indigofereae and Trifolieae.

Counts for 406 species {{are new to}} flora of Pakistan and counts for 187 species are new to science. Twelve genera are cytologically investigated for the first time. Maximum number of new counts is in the family Compositae (20), followed by Scrophulariaceae (14), Cruciferae, Boraginaceae, Labiatae (12 each) and Apiaceae (10). New cytotypes are reported in Consolida stocksiana (Boiss.) Nevski, Dianthus crinitus Sm., Salsola kali L., Indigofera linnaei Ali, Bupleurum exalratum M. Bieb., Conyza albida Willd. ex Spreng., Artemisia vulgaris L., Scorzonera tortuosissima Boiss., Alisma,elantago-aquatica L. and Poa annua L.

In addition to original counts {{the information about the}} species known from Pakistan available in other works carried out in Pakistan, Kashmir, neighboring parts of India, Afghanistan and Iran are also incorporated. By pooling all the available data, the overall number of chromoso. nal 1 y known species in the flora of Pakistan comes to be 1671 that makes 34 % of the total angiosperms in our flora. In the larger families of the sample, the highest frequency of <b>intrageneric</b> polyploidy is met with in Gramineae, followed by Cyperaceae, Cruciferae, Compositae, Scrophulariaceae, Boraginaceae,. Labiatae and Papilionaceae. In the larger families, lowest frequency of polyploidy is found in Umbelliferae in this sample. Some smaller families do not show any polyploidy. The families with higher frequencies of lntrageneric polyploidy are found t? be mainly herbaceous in habit and cosmopolitan in distribution, whereas families with greater frequencies of higher basic numbers (though showing little <b>intrageneric</b> polyploidy) are found to be mainly arboreal in habit and tropical in distribution. The overall <b>intrageneric</b> polyploidy in the flora of Pakistan on the basis of present sample is calculated to be 32 % and the total polyploidy (i. e. <b>intrageneric</b> plus palaeopolyploidy) is found to be 55 % which is considerably lower than the world average. In the phytogeographic analysis of polyploidy, the highest frequency of palaeopolyploidy is met with in the Sino-Japanese element which indicates the antiquity of this flora. In the uni or biregional phytogeographic elements of more humid and tropical areas also the palaeopolyploidy is met with in higher frequencies. In the biregional or pluriregional elements of temperate areas, the difference between <b>intrageneric</b> polyploidy and total polyploidy is found to be lower, that means these elements contain comparatively lower proportions of palaeopolyploids. However, in every phytogeographic region, the families retain their general pattern of the distribution of polyploidy {{to a greater or lesser}} extent.

Here we rigorously test the phylogenetic signal of the genome signature, which consists of the genome-specific relative frequencies of dinucleotides, on 334 sequenced prokaryotic genome sequences. Results <b>Intrageneric</b> comparisons show that in general the genomic dissimilarity scores are higher than in intraspecific comparisons, in accordance with the suggested phylogenetic signal of the genome signature. Exceptions to this trend, (Bartonella spp., Bordetella spp., Salmonella spp. and Yersinia spp.), which have low average <b>intrageneric</b> genomic dissimilarity scores, suggest that members of these genera might be considered the same species. On the other hand, high genomic dissimilarity values for intraspecific analyses suggest that in some cases (e. g. Prochlorococcus marinus, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Buchnera aphidicola and Rhodopseudomonas palustris) different strains from the same species may actually represent different species. Comparing 16 S rDNA identity with genomic dissimilarity values corroborates the previously suggested trend in phylogenetic signal, albeit that the dissimilarity values only provide low resolution. Conclusion The genome signature has a distinct phylogenetic signal, independent of individual genetic marker genes. A reliable phylogenetic clustering cannot be based on dissimilarity values alone, as bootstrapping is not possible for this parameter. It can however be used to support or refute a given phylogeny and resulting taxonomy. </p...|$|E
