500|$|Tommy Lee Jones as Harvey Dent / Two-Face [...] Formerly {{the good}} {{district}} attorney of Gotham City, half of Harvey's face is scarred with acid during {{the conviction of}} a crime boss. Driven insane, he becomes the criminal Harvey Two-Face obsessed with killing Batman. <b>He</b> <b>flips</b> a two-headed coin to determine if he kills (damaged side) or not (clean side). Billy Dee Williams, the actor that portrayed Dent in the first film, was supposed to reprise the role, but Joel Schumacher gave the role to Jones, as he had worked with him previously in The Client.|$|E
500|$|Courtship and mating in {{the yellow}} {{stingray}} involves one or more males closely following a female, seeking to bite and grip the rear margin of her disc; the high, pointed teeth of males serve to aid in this endeavor. Once the male successfully holds onto the female, <b>he</b> <b>flips</b> under her so that the two are aligned abdomen-to-abdomen, and inserts a single clasper into her cloaca. Rival males may attempt {{to interfere with the}} mating pair by biting or bumping them. In one observation that took place in water [...] deep near Tobacco Caye on the Belize Barrier Reef, the male pursuit lasted between 30 and 60 seconds and copulation lasted four minutes.|$|E

500|$|After {{approximately}} {{less than}} a minute, Sideshow Bob suddenly cuts off Jeremy's signal and takes control of the screen, telling the riders that he has taken over every area of Krustyland {{and that there is}} no place for the riders to be safe from him. He then announces [...] "And now, enjoy your ride, that's about to be DEMOLISHED! WHILE YOU'RE RIDING IT!!! MWA HA HA HA HAAAA!!!!!" [...] as <b>he</b> <b>flips</b> a switch from [...] "thrilling" [...] to [...] "killing", which activates the vehicles and makes them rise out of the room, starting the ride with the Simpsons in front of them. The roller coaster begins going down various drops before Homer gets hit by a wrecking ball controlled by Sideshow Bob before it smashes into the track and breaks it. Homer and the riders fly into {{a different part of the}} roller coaster track before the [...] "steel" [...] wrecking ball breaks free from its cable and starts chasing them.|$|E
500|$|About Ocean's writing, Pitchfork Media's Jordan Sargent {{stated that}} the [...] "strength of his songwriting {{is his ability to}} make the {{unfamiliar}} feel intensely personal, as if you're a friend that has long known all the particulars of his relationships." [...] He continued, [...] "Thinking About You" [...] is also more primal, though. The yearning in his falsetto is almost palpable as <b>he</b> <b>flips</b> gender roles and admits that he's been [...] "thinking about forever," [...] while simultaneously questioning if the [...] "girl" [...] even had that kinda thing on her mind." [...] Erika Ramirez of Billboard wrote that the track [...] "gives prominence to his songwriting prowess and sonic versatility, as he intertwines the parallel styles of soul, R, jazz and even a bit of funk." [...] The song has been described as incredibly personal in nature, the [...] "sort of thing that's best sung by the person who wrote it." [...] The track telepathically serenades the person who took Ocean's virginity, and in the [...] "motel room of memories Frank talks eternal love, breaking into a sublime Maxwell-esque falsetto that makes a good case for restoring the style to contemporary mainstream R" ...|$|E
500|$|On the {{characterization}} of Catwoman, Waters explained [...] "Sam Hamm {{went back to the}} way comic books in general treat women, like fetishy sexual fantasy. I wanted to start off just at the lowest point in society, a very beaten down secretary." [...] Harvey Dent appeared in early drafts of the script, but was deleted. His disfiguring appearance of Two-Face would have appeared in the climax when Catwoman kisses him with a taser to the face, which was replaced with Max Shreck. Waters quoted, [...] "Sam Hamm definitely planned that. I flirted with it, having Harvey start to come back and have one scene of him where <b>he</b> <b>flips</b> a coin and it's the good side of the coin, deciding not to do anything, so you had to wait for the next movie." [...] In early scripts Max Shreck was the [...] "golden boy" [...] of the Cobblepot family, whereas Penguin was the deformed outsider. It turned out that Shreck would be the Penguin's long-lost brother. Max Shreck was also a reference to actor Max Schreck, known for his role as Count Orlok in Nosferatu.|$|E

500|$|In Joe Macbeth (1955), {{the first}} film to {{transpose}} Macbeth into a gang and Mafia-like setting, Fleance {{is replaced by a}} character named Lenny. Lenny's father, Banky, is killed, but Lenny escapes, and gathers a group of angry mobsters to overthrow Macbeth, who has, through a series of murders, made himself the kingpin gangster in the area. Lenny is successful in killing Macbeth in the end, but only after Macbeth has murdered most of his family. In another gangster adaptation, Men of Respect (1991), Fleance is replaced by a character named Phil, who similarly helps overthrow Mike (Macbeth) after his father, Bankie (Banquo), is murdered. Phil is inducted into the gang {{at the end of the}} film, when Mal (Malcolm) has taken over, suggesting that the violent gang culture will continue through generations. This sentiment echoes into the final scenes of Penny Woolcock's Macbeth on the Estate. Macduff shoots Macbeth and takes a ring (representing his high status) off Macbeth's finger. Entering a bar, <b>he</b> <b>flips</b> it to Malcolm, saying, [...] "Hail, king." [...] Malcolm puts it on with some show and elbows his way to the front of the bar. One of the characters he elbows is Fleance (a skinhead), who makes a mock gun out of his fingers and [...] "shoots" [...] at the back of the darker-skinned Malcolm's skull. Again this makes it clear that the violence will not end with the new generation.|$|E
2500|$|The finals {{took place}} on Friday February 25, 2011 and {{featured}} what was described as [...] "teacher against teacher (Atlantis and Blue Panther), Young against Youth (Dorada and Rojo), Warrior against Warrior" [...] (Both Atlantis and Rojo were members of Los Guerreros del Infierno or [...] "The Infernal Warriors"). At {{the end of the}} first fall Máscara Dorada forced Dragón Rojo Jr. to the floor, then leap over the top rope onto Rojo Jr.. executing a difficult, high risk move. While the two young wrestlers were on the floor Atlantis pinned Blue Panther to take the first fall of the match for his team. In the second fall Dragón Rojo Jr. kicks Dorada out of the ring and is then almost pinned by Atlantis, but Panther saved his Rudo partner, putting aside their issues for the good of the tournament. The second fall comes to an end as Blue Panther forces Atlantis to submit. The first two falls came quickly, while the third fall was prolonged, seeing both teams have the advantage at different times during the match. At one point Máscara Dorada uses the tension of the top rope to propel him over fifteen feet over the floor as <b>he</b> <b>flips</b> onto Dragón Rojo Jr. on the floor, flawlessly executing a move known as an Asai Moonsault. The deciding fall comes when Atlantis forces Blue Panther to submit simultaneously with Dorada forcing Rojo Jr. to submit as well to win the tournament for the second time in a row.|$|E
2500|$|Jack {{pulls out}} a car from his garage and begins the race. After {{escaping}} from San Francisco by driving off the unfinished replacement span of the Eastern San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, Jack passes through Altamont Pass, Yosemite National Park, and Death Valley, before making it to Las Vegas in the top 150. Upon arrival, two female team racers interrogate him about his skills, and he is nearly apprehended after police shut down the city. However, he manages to escape out of Fremont Street, but is nearly crushed by a semitrailer truck. He manages to acquire a new vehicle, and heads to Chicago {{to make it in}} the top 50. On the way, he passes through the desert and up into the Rocky Mountains, where a one-on-one race against an opponent unfolds as the mountain slopes are detonated with dynamite to remove excess snow for the year. He races through Denver and the Badlands and across the Mississippi River, and upon arrival in Chicago, Marcus Blackwell, Jack's biggest rival and the main antagonist of the game, uses his connections with the mob to organize a [...] "welcome committee". Jack is then forced out of his car and pursued on foot by the mob's machine gun-mounted helicopter. After Jack temporarily escapes from the helicopter, he acquires a stolen police car, but is pursued by the helicopter again down Lower Wacker Drive and along the river. He tries to stay out of the spotlight of the helicopter to avoid getting the vehicle shot and destroyed, but ends up crashing in a train yard. Jack escapes from the overturned police car seconds before a freight train runs it down. Escaping Chicago and entering Cleveland, he drives through an industrial train yard filled with high explosives, trying to escape the mob. Crashing through the window of a warehouse, Jack wrecks the helicopter by slamming into its tail and sending it into the side of a building. After this, Jack is directed to and see a man named Uri for a new car. On the final leg to New York, Jack races through rural Pennsylvania, the Appalachians and Big Run State Park, defeating the final racers in the process. Jack makes it to New York in the top 2, passing through New Jersey. He races Marcus Blackwell (who drives a heavily modified Tier 6 Aston Martin One-77) through the crowded morning streets of Manhattan and Brooklyn, and on the final stretch Marcus is killed after <b>he</b> <b>flips</b> his car. As a result, Jack wins The Run and claims the $25,000,000 jackpot.|$|E
