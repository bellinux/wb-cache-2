2500|$|In Emery's judgement, {{claims that}} the Reagan administration's later [...] "tilt" [...] in favor of Iraq during the Iran–Iraq War was merely a {{continuation}} of Carter-era policies cannot be supported by available evidence: [...] "The policy that emerged was characterized {{by a desire to}} preserve all options, while trying to avoid actions that would undermine the Carter Doctrine or establish an opening for the Soviet Union. The impetus <b>for</b> <b>America</b> <b>to</b> adjust its policy of neutrality, and take a definitive position on which side to back, came in 1982, when the Iranian military threatened to overrun Iraq." [...] Indeed, [...] "the State Department's transition team advised the incoming government" [...] to avoid threatening Iran militarily or assisting the Iranian opposition, as doing so would [...] "make an eventual rapprochement with Iran more difficult." [...] In Carter's own account, [...] "I despised Saddam Hussein, because he attacked Iran when my hostages were being held. It was President Reagan who established diplomatic relations with Saddam Hussein after I left office." [...] Gibson averred: [...] "If Washington had any foreknowledge of the invasion, logic would suggest that the timing would be postponed until after the hostages were successfully released." [...] Regardless of whether the U.S. provided any express [...] "green light" [...] to Saddam, Iranians continue to view the failure of the United Nations Security Council to condemn Iraq's invasion—or to recognize Iraq as the aggressor until after Iraq's Invasion of Kuwait nearly a decade later—as a form of tacit complicity in Iraq's aggression against Iran—not just {{on the part of the}} U.S., but the entire world.|$|E
2500|$|An exultant Stilwell {{immediately}} delivered {{this letter}} to Chiang despite pleas from Patrick J. Hurley, Roosevelt's special envoy in China, to delay delivering {{the message and}} work on a deal that would achieve Stilwell's aim in a manner more acceptable to Chiang. Stillwell wrote in his diary about handing over Roosevelt's message: [...] "I handed this bundle of paprika to the Peanut and than sank back with a sigh. The harpoon hit the little bugger right in the solar plexus and went right through him. It was a clean hit, but beyond turning green and losing his powers of speech, he did not bat an eye". The British journalist Jonathan Fenby wrote about Roosevelt's letter: [...] "Unless the President was ready <b>for</b> <b>America</b> <b>to</b> take over effective control of China, or halt Lend-Lease supplies and abandon the KMT to its fate, his stern words merely amounted to bluff". Seeing this act as a move toward the complete subjugation of China, Chiang gave a formal reply {{in which he said}} that Stilwell must be replaced immediately and he would welcome any other qualified U.S. general to fill Stilwell's position. Chiang called Roosevelt's letter the [...] "greatest humiliation I have been subjected to in my life" [...] and stated it was [...] "all too obvious that the United States intends to intervene in China's internal affairs". Chiang told Hurley the Chinese people were [...] "tired of the insults which Stillwell has seen fit to heap upon them". Chiang delivered a speech before the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang, which was leaked to the press, which called Roosevelt's letter a form of imperialism and stated that to accept Roosevelt's demands would make him no different from the Japanese collaborator Wang Jingwei in Nanking. On 12 October 1944, Hurley reported to Washington that Stilwell was a [...] "fine man, but was incapable of understanding or co-operating with Chiang Kai-shek", going on to say that if Stilwell remained in command, all of China might be lost to the Japanese. Before sending his cable, Hurley showed it to Stilwell who accused Hurley [...] to his face of [...] "cutting my throat with a dull knife".|$|E
