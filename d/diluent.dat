50|$|<b>Diluents</b> (or thinners) {{are usually}} added to {{lacquers}} {{to reduce their}} viscosity (they are used to adjust the rheology). In thermal cured lacquers, such <b>diluents</b> added are volatile substances which evaporate from the lacquer during drying. In the case of radiation-curing lacquers (for example UV lacquers), those <b>diluents</b> should be avoided. The addition of reactive <b>diluents</b> facilitates the processing of the lacquers, allows the addition of more fillers and improves the wetting behavior on the substrate. If volatile <b>diluents</b> are replaced by reactive <b>diluents,</b> flammability, smell, skin irritation and environmental compatibility (by lower or no VOC emissions) can be improved.|$|R
30|$|Furthermore, the {{viscosity}} of the blended {{mixture is}} determined by the dilution rate as well as the viscosities and densities of the heavy crude oil and bitumen and the used <b>diluents.</b> The resulting blend of heavy crude oil and <b>diluents</b> has lower viscosity and therefore it is easier to pump at reduced cost. The dilution of heavy crude oil and bitumen to enhance transportation by pipelines requires two pipelines, one for the oil and another for the <b>diluents.</b> The use of <b>diluents</b> to enhance the transportability of heavy crude oil and bitumen in pipelines would be cost-effective, if the <b>diluents</b> are relatively cheap and readily available. The amount of <b>diluents</b> required for heavy crude oil, i.e. the ratio of <b>diluents</b> in the blended mixture, ranges from 0 to 20  %, while for bitumen it is in the range of 25 – 50  %.|$|R

40|$|Compatibility {{studies were}} {{conducted}} of sulbactam/ampicillin in infusion <b>diluents</b> that {{are reported to}} be compatible with ampicillin sodium. A high-performance liquid chro-matographic system that simultaneously detects sulbactam and ampicillin {{was used to determine}} whether the infusion <b>diluents</b> and the conditions of use recommended for am-picillin sodium are applicable to sulbactam/ampicillin. The results show that the sulbac-tam/ampicillin preparation for parenteral administration is compatible with all <b>diluents</b> recommended for ampicillin sodium. In all <b>diluents</b> sulbactam was more stable tham am-picillin. At the end of the reported use periods, the average retention value for sulbactam in the combination solutions was 96070 (range, 91 %- 101 %), whereas the average retention value for ampicillin in the same solutions was 90 % (range, 84 %- 95 %). The presence of sulbactam had no adverse effect on the stability of ampicillin. The average retention value for ampicillin alone in the same <b>diluents</b> was 92 % (range, 82 %- 99 %). The conditions of use for sulbactam/ampicillin in <b>diluents</b> for parenteral administration are unrestricted by the presence of sulbactam and are, in fact, governed by those of ampicillin sodium.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to investigate the morphological and mechanical properties of composite materials and porous materials prepared by thermally induced phase separation. High melting crystallizable <b>diluents</b> were mixed with polymers so that the phase separation would be induced by the solidification of the <b>diluents</b> upon cooling. Theoretical phase diagrams were calculated using Flory-Huggins solution thermodynamics which show good agreement with the experimental results. ^ Porous materials were prepared by the extraction of the crystallized <b>diluents</b> after cooling the mixtures (hexamethylbenzene/polyethylene and pyrene/polyethylene). Anisotropic structures show strong dependence on the identity of the <b>diluents</b> and the composition of the mixtures. Anisotropic crystal growth of the <b>diluents</b> was studied in terms of thermodynamics and kinetics using DSC, optical microscopy and SEM. Microstructures of the porous materials were explained in terms of supercooling and dendritic solidification. ^ Dual functionality of the crystallizable <b>diluents</b> for composite materials was evaluated using isotactic polypropylene (iPP) and compatible <b>diluents</b> that crystallize upon cooling. The selected <b>diluents</b> form homogeneous mixtures with iPP at high temperature and lower the viscosity (improved processability), which undergo phase separation upon cooling to form solid particles that function as a toughening agent at room temperature. Tensile properties and morphology of the composites showed that organic crystalline particles have the similar effect as rigid particles to increase toughness; de-wetting between the particle and iPP matrix occurs at the early stage of deformation, followed by unhindered plastic flow that consumes significant amount of fracture energy. The effect of the <b>diluents,</b> however, strongly depends on the identity of the <b>diluents</b> that interact with the iPP during solidification step, which was demonstrated by comparing tetrabromobisphenol-A and phthalic anhydride. A simple method to prepare composite surfaces that can change the wettability in response to the temperature change was proposed and evaluated. Composite surfaces prepared by nanoporous alumina templates filled with polymers showed surface morphology and wettability that depend on temperature. This effect is attributed to the significant difference in thermal conductivity and the thermal expansion coefficient between the alumina and the polymers. The reversibility in thermal response depends on the properties of the polymers. ...|$|R

25|$|Modernized and new large {{refineries}} such as {{are found}} in the Midwestern United States and on the Gulf Coast of the United States, as well as many in China, can handle upgrading heavy oil themselves, so their demand is for non-upgraded bitumen and extra-heavy oil rather than SCO. The main problem is that the feedstock would be too viscous to flow through pipelines, so unless it is delivered by tanker or rail car, it must be blended with <b>diluent</b> to enable it to flow. This requires mixing the crude bitumen with a lighter hydrocarbon <b>diluent</b> such as condensate from gas wells, pentanes and other light products from oil refineries or gas plants, or synthetic crude oil from oil sands upgraders to allow it to flow through pipelines to market.|$|E

40|$|Several {{alkylated}} cyclohexanones {{were investigated}} as potential <b>diluents</b> for the selective extraction of Am(III) and Eu(III) from nitric acid solutions by the CyMe 4 -BTBP ligand.

For the monomethylated <b>diluents,</b> DAm and SFAm/Eu decreased {{in the order of}} alkyl substitution 2 > 4 ~ 3.

25|$|Typically, blended bitumen {{contains}} about 30% natural gas condensate or other diluents and 70% bitumen. Alternatively, bitumen {{can also be}} delivered to market by specially designed railway tank cars, tank trucks, liquid cargo barges, or ocean-going oil tankers.

25|$|The {{increased}} {{partial pressure}} of oxygen {{due to the}} higher oxygen content of nitrox {{increases the risk of}} oxygen toxicity, which becomes unacceptable below the maximum operating depth of the mixture.

25|$|Although Venezuelan {{extra-heavy}} oil is less viscous than Canadian bitumen, much of {{the difference}} is due to temperature. Once the oil {{comes out of the}} ground and cools, it has the same difficulty in that it is too viscous to flow through pipelines. Venezuela is now producing more extra heavy crude in the Orinoco oil sands than its four upgraders, which were built by foreign oil companies over a decade ago, can handle. The upgraders have a combined capacity of , which is only half of its production of extra-heavy oil. In addition Venezuela produces insufficient volumes of naphtha to use as <b>diluent</b> to move extra-heavy oil to market. Unlike Canada, Venezuela does not produce much natural gas condensate from its own gas wells, and unlike Canada, it does not have easy access to condensate from new US shale gas production. Since Venezuela also has insufficient refinery capacity to supply its domestic market, supplies of naptha are insufficient to use as pipeline <b>diluent,</b> and it is having to import naptha to fill the gap. Since Venezuela also has financial problems – {{as a result of the}} country's economic crisis -, and political disagreements with the US government and oil companies, the situation remains unresolved.|$|E
