5000|$|The war has {{received}} widespread criticism {{and had a}} dramatic worsening effect on the humanitarian situation, that reached {{the level of a}} [...] "humanitarian disaster" [...] or [...] "humanitarian catastrophe". After the Saudi-led coalition declared the entire Saada Governorate a military target, the UNs Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen and Human Rights Watch said that air strikes by the Saudi-led coalition on Saada city in Yemen were in breach of international law. On 1 July UN declared for Yemen a [...] "level-three" [...] emergency - the highest UN <b>emergency</b> <b>level</b> - for a period of six months. Human rights groups repeatedly blamed the Saudi-led military coalition for killing civilians and destroying health centers and other infrastructure with airstrikes. The de facto blockade left 78% (20 million) of the Yemeni population in urgent need of food, water and medical aid. Aid ships are allowed, but the bulk of commercial shipping, on which the country relies, is blocked. In one occasion, coalition jets prevented an Iranian Red Crescent plane from landing by bombing Sanaa International Airports (SIA) runway, which blocked aid delivery via air. As of 10 December, more than 2,500,000 people had been internally displaced by the fighting. Many countries evacuated more than 23,000 foreign citizens from Yemen. More than 1,000,000 people fled Yemen for Saudi Arabia, Djibouti, Somalia, Ethiopia, Sudan and Oman.|$|E

The intelligence was confirmed by Air Intelligence who recommended the acquisition of Mirage-2000 or F-16 Falcon Fighters at an <b>emergency</b> <b>level.</b> Shamim advocated for the F-16s and acknowledged General Zia about the plans. In 1981, Air Intelligence command became alerted of suspected F-16s jets who had landed near the Indian borders. Shamim alerted the Pakistan Air Force, and a counter operation was launched, Operation Sentinel. Pakistan Air Force jets intercepted the suspected F-16s and confirmed their Israeli identity. Pakistan Air Force jets took aggressive measures and their tactics surprised the Israeli Air Force F-16s. Panicked and surprised, the mission was cancelled and Israeli Air Force F-16s were called off immediately. Pakistan then used Munir Ahmad Khan who was attending IAEA General Conference along with his Indian counterpart Dr. Raja Ramana. The Foreign Office directed a secret-coded message, through Ambassador of Pakistan to Austria Abdul Sattar, to Munir Khan who soon met Dr. Raja Ramana at the Imperial Hotel at Vienna, Austria. There, his Indian counterpart confirmed the possible surgical attack on Pakistani nuclear facilities. During their conversation, Munir Khan told the Chairman of India's Atomic Energy Commission that an Indian attack on Pakistani nuclear facilities would trigger a possible Pakistan retaliatory strike on Indian nuclear facilities at Trombay, which {{will result in the}} release of radioactivity causing a major disaster. Dr. Raja Ramana held a meeting with Indira Gandhi and conveyed Pakistan's possible response. Indira Gandhi immediately postponed the surprise attack, and subsequently the matter was shelved. Following these events, Indian and Pakistani officials met for negotiations and agreed that both countries would not attack each other's nuclear facilities.|$|E

40|$|Background and aims  Chlorine gas is a {{dangerous}} material that is used in chemical industries. In spite of the attempts for chlorine gas release control, sudden releases still occur in the related installations. Not taking proper emergency measures after chlorine gas dispersion may result in serious harm to health of the personnel and the people residing around the industrial area. The present study considers chlorine gas dispersion scenarios, determines emergency levels and presents an optimized pattern for more effective and faster response with the least required measures for emergency conditions control.   Methods   In the present paper by using Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP) and risk matrix the possible scenarios of chlorine gas dispersion in storage tanks unit of a petrochemical complex were considered. Then the intervals of these scenarios were determined {{with a view to}} Emergency Response Planning Guideline 1 - 2 - 3. With a view to the intensity of pollution extension and the population exposed to risk the scenarios were classified in the four emergency levels defined by Center for Chemical Process Safety (CCPS). Finally for each class of scenarios with a view to the related <b>emergency</b> <b>level</b> an optimum pattern of response plan in emergency conditions was presented.   Results  On the basis of the results of this study, chlorine gas dispersion scenario of the catastrophic explosion of the tank and scrubber system failure in the summer was classified in <b>emergency</b> <b>level</b> 4, in the winter in <b>emergency</b> <b>level</b> 3, chlorine gas dispersion due to chlorine lines rupture in the summer and winter in <b>emergency</b> <b>level</b> 3 and chlorine gas dispersion due to leakage of flanges and gaskets in <b>emergency</b> <b>level</b> 2 according to emergency levels of CCPS.   Conclusion The results of this study showed that systematic process risks analysis by use of risks recognition methods such as HAZOP and consequence analysis may have an effective role in recognition of the possible major events. Also by classification of release scenarios in CCPS emergency levels, we can select the best pattern for emergency conditions management...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} a cooperative collision-avoidance (CCA) scheme for intelligent transport systems. Unlike contemporary strategies, the envisioned scheme avoids flooding the considered vehicular network with high volumes of emergency messages upon accidental events. We present a cluster-based {{organization of the}} target vehicles. The cluster is based upon several criteria, which define {{the movement of the}} vehicles, namely, the directional bearing and relative velocity of each vehicle, as well as the intervehicular distance. We also design a risk-aware medium-access control (MAC) protocol to increase the responsiveness of the proposed CCA scheme. According to the order of each vehicle in its corresponding cluster, an <b>emergency</b> <b>level</b> is associated with the vehicle that signifies the risk of encountering a potential emergency scenario. To swiftly circulate the emergency notifications to collocated vehicles to mitigate the risk of chain collisions, the medium-access delay of each vehicle is set as a function of its <b>emergency</b> <b>level.</b> Due to its twofold contributions, i. e., the cluster-based and risk-conscious approaches, our adopted strategy {{is referred to as the}} cluster-based risk-aware CCA (C-RACCA) scheme. The performance of the C-RACCA system is verified through mathematical analyses and computer simulations, whose results clearly verify its effectiveness in mitigating collision risks of the vehicles arising from accidental hazards...|$|E
