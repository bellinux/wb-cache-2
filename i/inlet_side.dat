50|$|There are {{two main}} types of {{stormwater}} drain (highway drain or road gully in the UK) inlets: <b>side</b> <b>inlets</b> and grated <b>inlets.</b> <b>Side</b> <b>inlets</b> are located adjacent to the curb (kerb) and rely {{on the ability of}} the opening under the backstone or lintel to capture flow.

40|$|Integration of <b>side</b> <b>inlet</b> and/or <b>side</b> outlet {{expansion}} chambers {{into the}} rest of the muffler system for prediction of overall transmission loss (TL) or insertion loss requires knowledge of the four-pole parameters of these elements for propagation of plane waves in a moving medium. In this paper, transfer matrices have been derived for <b>side</b> <b>inlet</b> and <b>side</b> outlet elements for typically small mean flow Mach numbers. These are validated against the 3 -D model existing in the literature for a stationary medium and for acoustically long chambers. The effect of mean flow on TL of the side inlet/outlet chambers has been demonstrated.

40|$|AbstractA fixed-geometry {{two-dimensional}} mixed-compression supersonic inlet with sweep-forward high-light and bleed slot in {{an inverted}} “X”-form layout was {{tested in a}} wind tunnel. Results indicate: (1) with increases of the free stream Mach number, the total pressure recovery decreases, while the mass flow ratio increases to the maximum at the design point and then decreases; (2) when the angle of attack, α, is less than 6 °, the total pressure recovery of both <b>side</b> <b>inlets</b> tends to decrease, but, on the lee <b>side</b> <b>inlet,</b> its values are higher than those on the windward <b>side</b> <b>inlet,</b> and the mass flow ratio on lee <b>side</b> <b>inlet</b> increases first and then falls, while on the windward side it keeps declining slowly with the sum of mass flow on both sides remaining almost constant; (3) with the attack angle, α, rising from 6 ° to 9 °, both total pressure recovery and mass flow ratio on the lee <b>side</b> <b>inlet</b> fall quickly, but on the windward <b>side</b> <b>inlet</b> can be observed decreases in the total pressure recovery and increases in the mass flow ratio; (4) by comparing the velocity and back pressure character- ristics of the inlet with a bleed slot {{to those of the}} inlet without, {{it stands to reason that}} the existence of a bleed slot has not only widened the steady working range of inlet, but also made an enormous improvement in its performance at high Mach numbers.

40|$|The {{content of}} this Master thesis is the {{characterization}} of three different cross unmixed flow heat exchangers.

The heat transfer measurements were done with and without applying indirect evaporative cooling {{in order to find}} out the influence of indirect evaporative cooling. This research was done with the objective to find out which heat exchanger presents the best performance. The purpose is to install the heat exchanger in the novel solar driven open air SorLuKo system. This system was developed in Fraunhofer ISE and works under the same principe as the ECOS system.

50|$|A new-generation straight-6 F-head (overhead <b>inlet,</b> <b>side</b> exhaust valve) it {{differed}} from its predecessor by having redesigned big end and main bearings using an improved alloy, improved tappets {{and a more}} efficient drive to the timing gear. Piston crowns were raised and rectangular combustion chambers provided. Externally an oil filter was mounted on the forward right hand side. Without a beam axle the engine could be mounted further forward and particular care was taken to mount it so as to minimise noise and vibration to the passengers.|$|E
50|$|Much effort, {{and many}} {{different}} designs of piston crown, went into developing improved scavenging. The crowns developed {{from a simple}} rib to a large asymmetric bulge, usually with a steep face on the <b>inlet</b> <b>side</b> and a gentle curve on the exhaust. Despite this, cross scavenging was never as effective as hoped. Most engines today use Schnuerle porting instead. This places a pair of transfer ports in {{the sides of the}} cylinder and encourages gas flow to rotate around a vertical axis, rather than a horizontal axis.|$|E
