25|$|The {{standard}} sanitation {{technology in}} urban areas is the collection of wastewater in <b>gravity</b> <b>driven</b> sewers, its treatment in wastewater treatment plants for reuse or disposal in rivers, lakes or the sea. Sewers are either combined with storm drains or separated from them as sanitary sewers. Combined sewers are usually found in the central, older parts or urban areas. Heavy rainfall and inadequate maintenance can lead to combined sewer overflows or sanitary sewer overflows, i.e., more or less diluted raw sewage being discharged into the environment. Industries often discharge wastewater into municipal sewers, which can complicate wastewater treatment unless industries pre-treat their discharges.|$|E
25|$|Large shield volcanoes grow {{not only}} by adding {{material}} to their flanks as erupted lava, but also by spreading laterally at their bases. As a volcano grows in size, the stress field underneath the volcano changes from compressional to extensional. A subterranean rift may develop {{at the base of}} the volcano, causing the underlying crust to spread apart. If the volcano rests on sediments containing mechanically weak layers (e.g., beds of water-saturated clay), detachment zones (decollements) may develop in the weak layers. The extensional stresses in the detachment zones can produce giant landslides and normal faults on the volcano's flanks, leading to the formation of a basal escarpment. Further from the volcano, these detachment zones can express themselves as a succession of overlapping, <b>gravity</b> <b>driven</b> thrust faults. This mechanism has long been cited as an explanation of the Olympus Mons aureole deposits (discussed below).|$|E

50|$|The Zarn's {{spacecraft}} {{is located}} in the Mist Marsh. Like the Zarn himself the spacecraft is largely invisible, its streamlined shape outlined by spots of light that dot its surface. The Zarn's ship uses a <b>gravity</b> <b>drive.</b> When operating, it can cause significant increases in the local gravity field. This causes lots of activity in the Pylons and Skylons, but the Land of the Lost cannot counteract it all. In an attempt to escape the Land, the Zarn at one point attempts to use the <b>gravity</b> <b>drive</b> to destroy it entirely. The Marshalls prevent this by distracting him at a key moment, and the uncontrolled gravity badly damages the Zarn's ship instead.|$|R

A rescue vessel is dispatched to recover the Event Horizon, a starship that had disappeared seven years before, during its maiden voyage to Proxima Centauri. It was using an experimental <b>gravity</b> <b>drive</b> to generate an artificial black hole that could bridge two points in spacetime.

50|$|Turned down by {{the medical}} authorities, they are refused after they steal a ship to plead their case {{directly}} {{to the people of}} Earth. Returning to their asteroid hospital, they rig a working <b>gravity</b> <b>drive</b> and escape from the solar system. They head towards the Centauri system, solving problems such as overcoming a limited supply of needed pharmaceuticals and improving the drive. Earth sends out a ship, the Star Victory with a better version of the new drive in a bid to beat them there, on the theory that any aliens they encounter might make the mistake of thinking of them as normal humans. The Victory does beat them by a few days, arriving a year after they left, but they settle on a Mars-like planet near Alpha Centauri, before the Victory makes contact with butterfly-like aliens on a methane gas giant in the Proxima Centauri system. The aliens are somewhat similar in technology, but lacking a reliable <b>gravity</b> <b>drive.</b> They want a reasonable sampling of humans to study, but the crew of the Victory are all specialists and they are not welcome. The victory leaves the system to the Accidentals, promising to return, someday.|$|R
5000|$|Upon {{boarding}} the Event Horizon, {{the crew}} finds {{evidence of a}} massacre. As they search for survivors, the ship's <b>gravity</b> <b>drive</b> automatically activates. Justin is briefly pulled into the resulting portal. The activation also causes a shock wave that damages the Lewis and Clark, forcing the entire crew to board the Event Horizon. After Justin is pulled out, {{he is in a}} catatonic state, terrified by what he saw on the other side. He attempts suicide, forcing the crew to place him in stasis.|$|R

These systems utilize natural circulation based on simple laws of physics to transfer the decay heat outside containment while maintaining water levels inside the reactor, keeping the nuclear fuel submerged in water and adequately cooled.|$|E

When the Marshalls refuse to leave, believing that the amount of energy it would take to physically leave the Land of the Lost would destroy the Land of the Lost itself, the Zarn sends a robotic dinosaur named Fred to chase them off.|$|R

Einstein's field equations can be used to work out the detailed dynamics of space and time and to calculate the emergence of large-scale structure in the distribution of galaxies and radiation. Over the past few years, it has become clear that cosmological observations can be used not only to constrain different world models within the context of Einstein gravity but also to constrain the theory of gravity itself. In this article, we look at different aspects of this new field in which cosmology is used to test theories of gravity with a wide range of observations...|$|R
50|$|A Kelvin wave is any {{progressive}} wave that is channeled between two boundaries or opposing forces (usually between the Coriolis force and a coastline or the equator). There are two types, coastal and equatorial. Kelvin waves are <b>gravity</b> <b>driven</b> and non-dispersive. This means that Kelvin waves can retain their shape and direction {{over long periods}} of time. They are usually created by a sudden shift in the wind, such as the change of the trade winds {{at the beginning of the}} El Niño-Southern Oscillation.|$|E

50|$|Any {{escapement}} with {{sliding friction}} will need lubrication, but as this deteriorates the friction will increase, and, perhaps, insufficient power will {{be transferred to}} the timing device. If the timing device is a pendulum, the increased frictional forces will decrease the Q factor, increasing the resonance band, and decreasing its precision. For spring driven clocks, the impulse force applied by the spring changes as the spring is unwound, following Hooke's law. For <b>gravity</b> <b>driven</b> clocks, the impulse force also increases as the driving weight falls and more chain suspends the weight from the gear train; in practice, however, this effect is only seen in large public clocks, and it can be avoided by a closed-loop chain.|$|E
30|$|Nonetheless, SAGD {{has been}} field tested since 1984, {{with more than}} 20 field pilots (Komery et al. 1998) and {{recovery}} factor {{in the range of}} 20 – 60  % OOIP. Its applicability, however, requires high reservoir permeability, large formation thickness, labour intensive, the efficiency at later stage of the process decreases due to heat losses, the counter-current flow in the drainage area limits the utilisation of the <b>gravity</b> <b>drive</b> and reservoir energy (natural drive) (Greaves et al. 2000). In addition, steam EOR processes (i.e. CSS, SAGD, THSF, and Steam flooding) are faced with the problems of heat losses to the adjacent formations, which lower the thermal efficiency as the process progresses and also the use of large amount of gas and water for energy and steam generation makes them expensive and uneconomical. On the other hand, the <b>gravity</b> <b>drive</b> and the forced flow drive in THAI–CAPRI process make it more efficient, the continuous air flux stabilises the performances, creates ideal condition for an in situ upgrading with high oil recovery factor of range 79 – 85  %, eliminates the need for blending with costly diluents to aid transportation, addresses the downstream challenges associated with heavy oil processing as the impact contaminants are minimised, and the finally produced oil has high API gravity and lower viscosity, sulphur, heavy metals and nitrogen content compared to the original heavy oil. Nevertheless, THAI–CAPRI process is faced with problem of rapid catalyst deactivation due to asphaltenes and coke deposition, possible plugging of the catalyst bed leading to high pressure drop as well as early shutdown of the process.|$|R

The authors thought that if they could transport natural snow or ice from the highlands to living quarters using simple means, it might be of benefit to people living in dry or massed regions nearby the highlands to obtain not only cold heat but also water. In this paper, the possibility of long distance transportation of ice and water mixture through a pipe using only <b>gravity</b> <b>drive</b> was investigated.

Captain Miller of the Lewis and Clark - along with second in command Lieutenant Starck, pilot Smith, medical technician Peters, engineer Ensign Justin, Doctor D.J., and rescue technician Cooper are also joined by Dr. William Weir. Dr. Weir, who designed the Event Horizon, briefs the crew on the ship's experimental <b>gravity</b> <b>drive.</b> The drive generates an artificial black hole and uses it to bridge two points in spacetime, reducing travel time over astronomical distances.|$|R
50|$|Single fluid {{fluoride}} {{molten salt}} reactors feature fissile, fertile and actinide radioisotopes in molecular bonds with the fluoride coolant. The molecular bonds provide a passive safety feature in that a loss-of-coolant event corresponds with a loss-of-fuel event. The molten fluoride fuel can not itself reach criticality but only reaches criticality {{by the addition}} of a neutron reflector such as pyrolytic graphite. The higher density of the fuel along with additional lower density FLiBe fluoride coolant without fuel provides a flotation layer passive safety component in which lower density graphite that breaks off control rods or an immersion matrix during mechanical failure does not induce criticality. <b>Gravity</b> <b>driven</b> drainage of reactor liquids provides a passive safety component.|$|E
50|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{different}} types of submarine mass movements. All of the movements are mutually exclusive, for example a slide cannot be a fall. Some types of mass movements, such as slides, can be distinguished by the disrupted step like morphology which shows that there was only minor movement of the failed mass. The displaced material on a slide moves on a thin region of high strain. In flows the slide zone will be left bare and the displaced mass may be deposited hundreds of kilometres away from the origin of the slide. The displaced sediment of fall will predominantly travel through the water, falling, bouncing and rolling. Despite the variety of different landslides present in submarine environment, only slides, debris flow and turbidity currents provide a substantial contribution to <b>gravity</b> <b>driven</b> sediment transport.|$|E

40|$|A nearby {{analytic}} {{model of a}} <b>gravity</b> wave <b>driven</b> middle atmosphere circulation is formulated. The simplified model represents the one-dimensional interaction of a single gravity wave mode with a zonal-mean flow. Solutions of this model are shown to agree very well with numerical results from a more complete mean-flow/gravity-wave model (essentially the model developed by Holton, 1982). A single nondimensional parameter, the ratio of a mean flow radiative forcing parameter, and the gravity wave momentum flux incident into the middle atmosphere from below largely determine {{the solution of the}} model. For typical middle atmosphere parameter values, an approximate solution can be obtained, and this solution permits the parameter dependence of the circulation to be characterized very simply. The <b>gravity</b> wave <b>driven</b> circulation extends downward from the level (the breaking level, approximately) where the momentum flux equals the mean flow radiative forcing...|$|R
5000|$|An {{important}} {{part to the}} functioning of blimp society, the symbiauts are biomechanical creations that are organically constructed by and actually within the blimp body. Blimps evolved this ability after migrating to Jupiter (which they call [...] "Secondhome") where the element-rich atmosphere necessitated the ability to filter and pass metallic waste. While blimps of old used to merely let this waste fall back into the atmosphere, the new society learned over time to guide the construction and programming of basic machines. In time, the art of offcasting (or producing a symbiaut) grew more refined, producing mobile designs with wheels (what the humans would later dub 'Wheelers') and eventually <b>gravity</b> <b>drives</b> (though vestigial wheels remained {{as a means of}} energy-conserving locomotion).
