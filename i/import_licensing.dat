25|$|Ford New Zealand's Seaview {{plant in}} Lower Hutt built 1.1 and 1.3-litre versions, {{initially}} as Deluxe (1.1) and Super (1.3) two-door sedans plus panel vans. The four-door sedan was added in 1970. Trim levels were revised after the 1972 UK facelift {{with just one}} run of 1.3XLs (with the GT instrument pack) before these were downgraded to 'L' trim. Base and L trims were offered {{to the end of}} the Mk I run. Some 1.6 Mexicos were imported in 1973–74 after the government temporarily freed up <b>import</b> <b>licensing</b> owing to a shortage of new cars. Estate versions were mostly imported.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the move}} to fixed {{exchange}} rates together with <b>import</b> <b>licensing</b> drastically curtailed exports, and the balance of payments problem became acute. The system became nearly unmanageable, and in 1953 a more flexible, multiple-exchange-rate system was introduced. Under the latter, imports considered essential were brought in at a favored rate; imports of goods that could be supplied domestically faced high rates and were allotted small portions of the available foreign exchange. Similarly, some exports were stimulated with a higher exchange rate than those of traditional exports. This system continued {{to be the main}} instrument for the promotion of import substitution industrialization, but the performance of the export sector improved only modestly.|$|E
25|$|Pessimistic {{about the}} future of Brazil's exports, the {{government}} feared that the crisis would {{have a negative impact on}} inflation. Consequently, instead of devaluing the cruzeiro, it decided to deal with the crisis through exchange controls. In 1951 the newly elected government of Getúlio Vargas enforced a recently established system of <b>import</b> <b>licensing,</b> giving priority to imports of essential goods and inputs (fuels and machinery) and discouraging imports of consumer goods. These policies had the unanticipated effect of providing protection to the consumer goods industry. Early in the 1950s, however, convinced that the only hope for rapid growth was to change the structure of the Brazilian economy, the government adopted an explicit policy of import substitution industrialization. An important instrument of this policy was the use of foreign exchange controls to protect selected segments of domestic industry and to facilitate the importation of equipment and inputs for them.|$|E

50|$|An <b>import</b> <b>license</b> is a {{document}} issued {{by a national}} government authorizing the importation of certain goods into its territory. <b>Import</b> <b>licenses</b> {{are considered to be}} non-tariff barriers to trade when used as a way to discriminate against another country's goods in order to protect a domestic industry from foreign competition.|$|R

50|$|The U.S., {{along with}} Japan, filed their {{complaints}} over the <b>import</b> <b>licensing</b> system earlier in August (2012) and the European Union lodged a nearly identical case in May. Following others complaints, Mexico became the fourth country {{to challenge the}} Argentine policies. The four challengers assert the same basic allegation: That Argentina has used <b>import</b> <b>licensing</b> and registration requirements as an informal trade balancing program to favor domestic producers, withholding the licenses from importers unless they agree to certain export quotas. In March, 2012, 14 members of the WTO Council for Trade in Goods, including the U.S., EU and Mexico, said the regulations were creating long delays and resulting in huge costs {{for many of the}} companies doing business with Argentina. The countries said the policies were unbefitting a WTO nation, and urged Argentina to dismantle the licensing program.|$|E

5000|$|Import quotas: To {{reduce the}} {{quantity}} and therefore increase the market price of imported goods. The economic effects of an import quota {{is similar to that}} of a tariff, except that the tax revenue gain from a tariff will instead be distributed to those who receive <b>import</b> <b>licenses.</b> Economists often suggest that <b>import</b> <b>licenses</b> be auctioned to the highest bidder, or that import quotas be replaced by an equivalent tariff.|$|R
40|$|Analyses of {{import quota}} regimes {{typically}} ignore institutional features {{under which the}} quota licenses are administered. However, distributing the bulk of <b>import</b> <b>licenses</b> to {{a small number of}} firms can create oligopsony power and hence affect the level of quota rent and the potential success of auctioning licenses. In this paper I test formally for this phenomenon in the U. S. dairy import quota regime.

40|$|Recent {{discussions on}} U. S. trade {{policies}} suggest that import quotas should be auctioned {{to ensure the}} U. S. Treasury acquires the quota rent. However, studies estimating the potential benefits have ignored important details of import quota regimes and have assumed perfect competition and no exporter retaliation. We explore these three issues with an application to the U. S. cheese import quota regime. We show that when features of the U. S. dairy quota regime {{and structure of the}} cheese processing sector are accounted for, likely quota rents and potential welfare consequences of selling <b>import</b> <b>licenses</b> change significantly. While quota license sales may raise Treasury receipts, they may also cause a net welfare loss. Key words: imperfect competition, <b>import</b> quotas, <b>licenses,</b> quota rents, U.

50|$|The {{economic}} liberalisation of 1991, initiated by then Indian prime minister P. V.

40|$|Despite valid criticisms, many {{developing}} countries have issued non-transferable <b>import</b> <b>licenses</b> to {{a limited number of}} final-good producers so as to restrict imports of an input capital equipment.

Under pure competition, domestic welfare falls relative to the use of marketable quota licenses, but if foreigners would get the quota rents, or if external economies cause decreasing costs, then bureaucratic allocation can dominate. ...|$|R
