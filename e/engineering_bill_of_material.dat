Product design and simulation have been long {{used to support}} their enterprise-wide engineering activities. This paper describes, in detail, a case study and solution of a simulation process management project called performance simulation model (PSM). We focus on several research issues, including integration of design process and simulation process, simulation data management, simulation flow management, and the architecture of PSM. A prototype for PSM that allows a unification of design process and simulation process by PDM’s <b>engineering</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>Material</b> (EBOM) is presented. The prototype has been used successfully for static analysis of transmission system...|$|E

During the design process, they must use a variety of CAD softwares and connect all the PDM systems of their customers. After defining the specific needs of these companies, we show that the available commercial CAD / PDM integrations, as well as the current literature, are inappropriate for a multiCAD / multiPDM collaborative design. Are first defined the few simple processes required to ensure an efficient collaboration. Then, the instantiation of these processes in our CAD / PDM integration can be split into four points: the general definition of a CAD product structure tree and its associated model, the conversion algorithm of the product structure to an <b>Engineering</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Of</b> <b>Material</b> (EBOM), the creation of an UML data model, an implementation based upon COM and Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) technologies. We conclude by presenting the results obtained from the demonstrator developed...|$|E

This requires companies to plan production capacity to meet market demand in a timely manner and with the appropriate amount, which is expected to increase corporate profits. In fulfillment of consumer needs for propducts, companies need to consider the capacity planning and production control activities should be done in fulfillment of orders in the market. PT. Jasmine Tunas Perkasa Sidoarjo own, especially in the vermicelli (white noodles), sometimes have different numbers of production with demand for the previous product data. That’s because the differences between each – each work station has an excess or shortage of working hours of production, which also can affect consumer demand. The purpose of this study, namely to analyze the capacity planning of optimal production time in order to meet consumer demand in each – each work station during the first years. Given these objectives, the required method of Rough Cut Capacity Planning (RCCP), which is an “analysis to test the availability of the available capacity of production facilities in the master production schedule to meet a predetermined” by the <b>Engineering</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Of</b> <b>Material</b> (BOM).

So that as many overtime hours needed to be 23011. 6 hours / year for work stations mixing of materials, 46507. 6 hours / year for work stations presses and printing dough, 409926. 4 hours / year for work stations drying, and 252470 hours /...|$|E

In process industries, the BOM is also known as the formula, recipe, or ingredients list.

5000|$|Digital Prototyping is {{a viable}} {{alternative}} to PLM for these small-to-midsized manufacturers. Like PLM, Digital Prototyping seeks to link otherwise unconnected, siloed activities, such as concept development, design, engineering, manufacturing, sales, and marketing. However, unlike PLM, Digital Prototyping does not support the entire product development process from conception to disposal, but rather focuses on the design-to-manufacture portion of the process. The realm of Digital Prototyping ends when the digital product and the <b>engineering</b> <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> are complete. Digital Prototyping aims to resolve many of the same issues as PLM without involving a highly customized, all-encompassing software deployment.

To achieve a comprehensively connected production it is necessary to identify interdependencies between elements within a production process. Elements, in this context, are for example the inventory, the machine utilization or the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>material.</b> This paper shows a method to identify direct dependencies and influences of these elements between each other. An example therefore is the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>material.</b> The <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>material</b> gives an overview of required parts. An inventory check shows if these parts are available. Missing parts are ordered, available parts are send into production.
