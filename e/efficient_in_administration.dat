40|$|The {{purpose and}} thesis of this {{dissertation}} {{project is to}} develop a resource manual which will facilitate the effective administration and management of small membership and Ethnic Minority congregations in the United Methodist denomination. The manual is significant in that it is designed specifically to address the need of small membership and Ethnic Minority Local Churches’ congregations. The manual provides the basic steps in the administrative process, and outlines keys for effective mission and ministry. The dissertation is divided into the following sections: an acknowledgement, preface, glossary, introduction, six chapters, a bibliography, and statistical tables. The introduction defines the designs and aims of the project. The rationale for small membership church administration is also included in the introduction. Chapter I, “Theological Foundation of Church Administration,” outlines the foundational understanding of theological and biblically—based church administration. The goals of church administration, ecclesiology, history and practical aspects of small membership church administration are delineated. The fundamental question of why, what, who and how of administration are addressed. Also, a brief look at liberation theology and its relation to the small membership church and Ethnic Minority Local Church is highlighted. The chapter concludes by listing what effective churches do. Chapter II looks at the basic characteristics of the small membership church and Ethnic Minority Local Church. The several ways in which these churches are unique are listed. Analyses of these churches are offered, with descriptions. In Chapter III, ‘~Organization for Administration,” specific guidelines in organizing for the administrative task are spelled out. Chapter IV gives the “Keys” of administration. Three (3) key ways to vital and effective churches are highlighted in this important chapter. Chapter V, a “nuts and bolts” approach is taken, which includes several practical ways to effective church administration. If these ways and suggestions are carefully followed, assurance of accomplishment is apparent. This chapter is important to the day—by—day, week—by—week, month—by—month administration of the church, its program, mission and outreach. Included in this chapter are the important concerns of time management and blocks to administration. Chapter VI “conclusion” describes in summary fashion the appropriateness of administration within small membership churches and Ethnic Minority Churches. A future projection for administration and a challenge to all to become more <b>efficient</b> <b>in</b> <b>administration</b> is offered. The monumental challenge of church administration is presented in the manual. The appendix includes examples of a way to contemporary administration and communication. Charts, graphics and tables have been included to aid the reader in ascertaining the information presented. Included in the overall project is the writer’s theory of ministry. The focus of the dissertation is the equipping of pastors and leaders for the effective execution of their responsibilities and duties, as servants of God...|$|E

40|$|The general {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to investigate the relevance and efficiency of Yoruba gods <b>in</b> the <b>administration</b> of punishment and justices on crime commitment. Two Yoruba gods (Sango and Ogun) were principally chosen. Six hundred (600) participants were conveniently sampled from three localities from three geo-political states {{in the western part of}} Nigeria.

The results show that Yoruba natives still fear and respect these gods. The gods are still relevant and <b>efficient</b> <b>in</b> the <b>administration</b> of punishment on crime commission. The Yoruba natives show preference for the non-conventional punishments of these gods to modern criminal justice systems. Finally, the paper recommends the opinion survey polls on the inclusion of the invocations of these gods in the criminal justice systems of Nigeria and the likely implementations of the invocations in official swearing in ceremony for political and public office holders and the administration of the invocations in Nigerian courts of law...|$|R

40|$|De-facto states {{constitute}} {{an interesting and}} important anomaly {{in the international system}} of sovereign states. No matter how successful and <b>efficient</b> <b>in</b> the <b>administration</b> of their territories they are, they fail to achieve international recognition. In the past, their claims for independence were based primarily on the right to national self-determination, historical continuity and claim for a remedial right to secession, based on alleged human-rights violations. Since 2005, official representatives of several de facto states have repeatedly emphasised the importance of democracy promotion in their political entities. A possible explanation of this phenomenon dwells in the belief that those states which have demonstrated their economic viability and promote the organization of a democratic state should gain their sovereignty. This article demonstrates the so called “democracy-for-recognition strategy” in the case study of Abkhazia. On the basis of the field research in Abkhazia we identify factors that promote, as well as those that obstruct the democratisation process in the country...|$|R

500|$|Ahmad ibn Tulun ( [...] ; ca. 20 September 835 – 10 May 884) was {{the founder}} of the Tulunid dynasty that ruled Egypt and Syria between 868 and 905. Originally a Turkic slave-soldier, in 868 Ibn Tulun was sent to Egypt as {{governor}} by the Abbasid caliph. Within four years Ibn Tulun had established himself as a virtually independent ruler by evicting the caliphal fiscal agent, Ibn al-Mudabbir, taking over control of Egypt's finances, and establishing a large military force personally loyal to himself. This process was facilitated by the volatile political situation in the Abbasid court and the preoccupation of the Abbasid regent, al-Muwaffaq, with the wars against the Saffarids and the Zanj Rebellion. Ibn Tulun also took care to establish an <b>efficient</b> <b>administration</b> <b>in</b> Egypt. After reforms to the tax system, repairs to the irrigation system, and other measures, the annual tax yield grew markedly. As a symbol of his new regime, he built a new capital, al-Qata'i, north of the old capital Fustat.|$|R

Instead of passing the civil service examination, Yuxian purchased a degree that qualified him {{to serve as an}} official. Although he bought a position of prefect in Shandong province in 1879, only in 1889 did he start to serve in Caozhou, an unruly prefecture in southwestern Shandong that was prone to flooding and plagued by bandits. The departure of local troops for the front of the Sino-Japanese War in 1894 led to a sharp increase in banditry in the area. Yuxian managed to keep bandits under control with the help of local self-defense groups like the newly founded Big Swords Society.

40|$|As {{a result}} of welfare state {{policies}} in the 20 th century, public institutions grew, diversified, and the field of public <b>administration</b> expanded considerably <b>in</b> terms of public services. This has brought about cumbersome, resource waste, paperwork and similar problems <b>in</b> public <b>administration.</b> But especially after the economic crisis of the 1970 s, the debate about public administration's fundamental change and transformation has been intensified. These debates, which also constitute {{the foundations of the}} New Public Management, led to a re-questioning of the public administration and a radical transformation. Changing systems have foreseen a state that provides faster and more efficient services and the state has to adopt a structural transformation that limits its activities to provide efficient services instead of operating in every field. In this transformation process, it is being argued that the private sector and the public sector are not different from each other and that the techniques successfully applied in the private sector can also be implemented by the public <b>administration.</b> <b>In</b> this context, the most important tool that comes out to provide effective and <b>efficient</b> service <b>in</b> public <b>administration</b> is performance concept and performance management process. But management tradition and culture have a great influence in the implementation and success of this technique. AngloSaxon state tradition, which attaches importance to organizational understanding and practice, is more inclined to adapt modern management techniques to public administration; Continental Europe state tradition seems to be more distant from these techniques by giving more importance to theory and public institutions...|$|R

It has been observed that Nigerian universities has for decades been faced with so many crisis ranging from conflict between academic staff and university administrators, students versus academic staff, students versus university authorities, non-academic staff versus university administrators. The conflicts {{have given rise to}} distrust and hostility among professionals and academics, thus, contributing in hampering smooth, effective and <b>efficient</b> <b>administration</b> <b>in</b> the universities.

If this role conflict is not checked it can be descriptive and negative as people involved will often see one another as enemies. This is unwholesome for the University community and Nigeria educational system as a whole. This paper examined conflict management in higher institutions of learning with specific reference to Nigerian Universities. Some causes of conflict were identified as well as ways these conflicts could be managed. Well-fashioned recommendations on how conflict could be more effectively managed for the achievement of the system's mission, goals and objectives and in particular the pursuit of industrial harmony in the system were also made...|$|R

BALB/c fetuses at 14 - 15 days' gestation received lentiviral vectors carrying the transgene lacZ {{under the control of}} the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter by intramuscular (i. m.) or intrahepatic (i. h.) injection. We pseudotyped the lentiviral vectors with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G), with Mokola virus, or with Ebola virus envelope glycoproteins. We harvested the pups at time points between 5 days and 9 months following injection and performed a detailed histologic assessment. The efficiency and distribution of transduction after <b>in</b> utero <b>administration</b> was highly dependent upon the route of administration and the pseudotype of vector used. Biodistribution studies showed widespread distribution of vector sequences in multiple tissues, albeit at very low levels, and transduced cells were found in significant numbers only in liver, heart, and muscle. Overall, VSV-G was the most <b>efficient</b> <b>in</b> transducing hepatocytes, whereas Mokola and Ebola were more <b>efficient</b> <b>in</b> transducing myocytes. Transduction of cardiomyocytes was observed after both i. m. and i. h. injection of all three vectors.

40|$|Muscle {{represents}} an important tissue target for adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector-mediated gene {{transfer of the}} factor IX (FIX) gene in hemophilia B (HB) subjects with advanced liver disease. Previous studies of direct intramuscular administration of an AAV-FIX vector in humans showed limited efficacy. Here we adapted an intravascular delivery system of AAV vectors encoding the FIX transgene to skeletal muscle of HB dogs. The procedure, performed under transient immunosuppression (IS), resulted in widespread transduction of muscle and sustained, dose-dependent therapeutic levels of canine FIX transgene up to 10 -fold higher than those obtained by intramuscular delivery. Correction of bleeding time correlated clinically with a dramatic reduction of spontaneous bleeding episodes. None of the dogs (n = 14) receiving the AAV vector under transient IS developed inhibitory antibodies to canine FIX; transient inhibitor was detected after vector delivery without IS. The use of AAV serotypes with high tropism for muscle and low susceptibility to anti-AAV 2 antibodies allowed for <b>efficient</b> vector <b>administration</b> <b>in</b> naive dogs and {{in the presence of}} low- but not high-titer anti-AAV 2 antibodies.
