50|$|The device used {{to achieve}} {{vertebral}} fixation {{is usually a}} permanent rigid or semi-rigid prosthesis made of titanium; examples include rods, plates, screws, and various combinations thereof.

50|$|This {{treatment}} {{also requires}} surgery by an orthopedist. Pins or screws are placed into the fractured bone {{above and below}} the fracture site. The orthopedic surgeon repositions the bone fragments and pins or screws are connected to a metal bar or bars outside the skin which holds the bones in their proper position so they can heal. The external <b>fixation</b> <b>device</b> is removed after an appropriate time period.|$|E
50|$|Dudek {{made his}} first start of 2010-11 in the same competition, against AJ Auxerre on 8 December, but after making two {{impressive}} saves saw his action terminated after sustaining a jaw injury in a clash with opposing forward Roy Contout just before half-time.

50|$|Cervical collars {{are also}} used therapeutically to help realign the spinal cord and relieve pain, {{although}} they are usually not worn {{for long periods of}} time. Another use of the cervical collar is for strains, sprains or whiplash. If pain is persistent, the collar might be required to remain attached to help in the healing process. A person may also need a cervical collar, or may require a halo <b>fixation</b> <b>device</b> to support the neck during recovery after surgery such as cervical spinal fusion.|$|E

50|$|A single {{nanotube}} {{experiences a}} change in electrical resistance when experiencing stress or strain. This piezoresistive effect changes the current flow through the nanotube, which {{can be measured in}} order to accurately quantify the applied stress. A semi-random positioning of many overlapping nanotubes forms an electrically conducting network composed of many piezoresistive nanotubes. If the variance of the tube lengths and angles are known and controllable during manufacture, an eigensystem approach can be used to determine the expected current flow between any two points in the network. The tube network is embedded within orthopedic plates, clamps, and screws and in bone grafts {{in order to determine the}} state of bone healing by measuring the effect of a load on the plate, clamp, screw, or other <b>fixation</b> <b>device</b> attached to the bone. A healed bone will bear most of the load while a yet unhealed bone will defer the load to the <b>fixation</b> <b>device</b> wherein the nanotube network may measure the change in resistivity. Measurement is done wirelessly by electrical induction. This allows the doctor to accurately assess patient healing and also allows the patient to know how much stress the affected area may safely tolerate. Wolff's law indicates that bone responds positively to safe amounts of stress, which may be necessary for proper healing.|$|E
5000|$|A spinal <b>fixation</b> <b>device</b> stabilizes {{an area of}} the {{posterior}} spine while allowing for a significant range of motion and limiting the compression of the affected vertebrae. The device consists of two or more arm assemblies (lateral) connected by one or more telescopic assemblies (vertical). Each arm assembly is composed of a central portion, which connects to the telescopic assembly or assemblies. Left and right arms attach to the corresponding side of the central portion of the arm assembly. Each arm section is directly connected to its individual pedicle by means of pedicle fasteners.|$|E
50|$|In another setback, Barbaro {{developed}} a deep abscess {{in his right}} hind foot, a problem generally caused by lack of grip exercise. Additional surgery was performed on January 27 to insert two steel pins into the healed bones of Barbaro's right foot {{as part of an}} external skeletal <b>fixation</b> <b>device.</b> This would allow the right foot to bear more weight, but the procedure was risky, with the major danger being that the bones might break again. Later that same weekend, Barbaro's front feet, which had remained healthy throughout the ordeal, displayed clear signs of laminitis due to him not being able to bear weight on his hind legs. Thus, Barbaro could not then comfortably put his weight on any of his legs.|$|E

5000|$|In 1947 Leksell visited Wycis in Philadelphia and than {{developed}} and described his instrument in a publication in 1949 {{and this was}} the first example of a stereotactic system based on the principle of ‘‘center-of-arc’’. In contrast to the Cartesian coordinate system of the Spiegel-Wycis device, Leksell’s frame employed used three polar coordinates (angle, depth and anterior-posterior location). This ‘‘arc-quadrant’’ device provided maximum flexibility in choosing probe entry point and trajectory, and was therefore much easier to use. The frame has been modified over the ensuing years, but remarkably remains very similar in function and appearance to the original 1949 device. The use of a movable semi-arc with an electrode carrier implies that the tip of a probe can reach the target regardless of the position of the carrier or the angling of the arc relative to the skull <b>fixation</b> <b>device,</b> a frame or base plate with bars for bone fixation screws. This construction permits also transphenoidal, straight lateral and suboccipital probe approaches.Leksell was in many respects a perfectionist {{and for the rest of}} his life he continued to change and revise the design of virtually every small part of his instrument though the basic semicircular frame was retained. He focused not only on upgrading the function of the instrument but also on its aesthetic appearance. An important feature was that ‘‘the apparatus should be easy to handle and practical in routine clinical work’’ and ‘‘a high degree of exactitude is necessary.’’ An oft-cited quotation is ‘‘Tools used by the surgeon must be adapted to the task and where the human brain is concerned, no tool can be too refined.’’ ...|$|E
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} a <b>fixation</b> <b>device</b> for internally fixing fractures. The <b>fixation</b> <b>device</b> has an elongated support plate and a transverse plate and a fin member extending transversely from the elongated support plate. The elongated support plate and the transverse plate define {{a plurality of}} holes for receiving fixing elements to mount the <b>fixation</b> <b>device</b> onto a bone. The holes can be so located that the fixing elements can prevent the <b>fixation</b> <b>device</b> from rotating relatively to the bone after the <b>fixation</b> <b>device</b> is mounted onto the bone. Additionally, the fin member is formed to be more flexible than the transverse plate. Thereby, the fin member can be bent {{to conform to the}} contour of the bone for fixing or stabilizing a fractured fragment. As a result, the <b>fixation</b> <b>device</b> can both support the injured bone and fix/stabilize the fractured fragment. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|Endoscopic submucosal {{dissection}} {{is considered}} a curative and minimally invasive treatment for early gastric cancer; however, precise pathologic assessment of resected specimens is required to develop further treatment plans. Human error during specimen handling can affect objective assessment of resected specimens. In this study, we investigated whether a novel tissue <b>fixation</b> <b>device</b> offered more objective and standardized pathologic evaluation than conventional manual tissue fixation. We developed a novel tissue <b>fixation</b> <b>device</b> for endoscopic submucosal dissection specimens. Two circular tissue samples 2, 3, and 4 cm in diameter {{were obtained from the}} body of 45 porcine stomachs. One specimen sample was placed in a fixation device; the other was manually fixed on corkboard. We used a pressure indicator to ensure constant pressure in the resected specimens in the <b>fixation</b> <b>device.</b> We measured submucosal diameter and thickness after 24 hr. The diameters for 2, 3, and 4 cm resected tissue samples were 23. 85, 32. 30, and 45. 0 mm and 21. 0, 32. 0, and 44. 50 mm for the <b>fixation</b> <b>device</b> and manual pinning groups, respectively. The submucosal thicknesses in the <b>fixation</b> <b>device</b> group were 397. 09, 381. 43, and 415. 51 μm and 393. 76, 529. 69, and 603. 82 μm by manual pinning for 2, 3, and 4 cm tissue samples, respectively. Analysis of standard deviation revealed that the submucosal thickness in the manual fixation group was much more variable than in the <b>fixation</b> <b>device</b> group (p = 0. 012, 0. 042, and 0. 001 for 2, 3, and 4 cm tissue specimens, respectively; Fligner-Killeen test of homogeneity of variances). Among variously sized resected tissue specimens, submucosal thicknesses were more variable in the conventional fixation group, while the thicknesses were comparatively consistent in the <b>fixation</b> <b>device</b> group. After endoscopic submucosal dissection, pathologic preparation using this <b>fixation</b> <b>device</b> could offer more objective assessment of specimens...|$|E
40|$|Spinal <b>fixation</b> <b>devices</b> {{can be used}} to form a rigid {{construct}} {{with the}} spine to replace bone, restore alignment, maintain position, and prevent motion in the treatment of fractures, degenerative disease, neoplasm, and congenital deformities. Because most spinal constructs will eventually fail if bone fusion does not occur, bone graft material is often used along with the implant to promote fusion. Conventional radiographs, obtained in two projections, remain the mainstay of implant evaluation, demonstrating the position of the spinal elements, hardware, graft material, and evidence of complication. Possible complications connected with use of <b>fixation</b> <b>devices</b> include intraoperative soft-tissue injuries, postoperative hematomas, and infection. The components (through incorrect use, malpositioning at surgery, and later dislodgment or fracture) may also contribute to complications such as instability; failure of fusion; or pain, with possible resultant neurologic damage. Bone graft material can migrate or hypertrophy, resulting in impingement on the spinal canal or neural foramen. Radiologists should be familiar with the various spinal <b>fixation</b> <b>devices</b> and techniques to better identify evolving complications. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe blade-plate is the {{earliest}} {{of the contemporary}} internal <b>fixation</b> <b>devices</b> introduced for distal femoral fractures. The recent development of dedicated, <b>fixation</b> <b>devices</b> has considerably limited its use. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate outcomes after blade-plate fixation and after <b>fixation</b> using other <b>devices.</b> HypothesisOutcomes after blade-plate fixation are similar to those after condylar screw-plate, distal femoral nail, or locking condylar plate fixation. Material and methodsWe reviewed outcomes after 62  patients managed with blade-plate fixation and included in a multicentre retrospective study (n= 57) or a multicentre prospective study (n= 5) and we compared them to outcomes after fixation using condylar screw-plates (n= 82), distal femoral nail (n= 219), or locking condylar plates (n= 301). The four groups were comparable for age, gender distribution, occupational status, prevalence of skin wounds, patient-related factors, type of accident, and type of fracture. The evaluation relied on the clinical International Knee Society (IKS) score and on radiographs. ResultsNo significant differences existed across the four groups for operative time, blood transfusion use, complications, need for bone grafting, non-union rate, or IKS score values. The early surgical revision rate for removal of the fixation material was 4 % with the blade-plate and 16 % with the other three <b>fixation</b> <b>devices</b> (P= 0. 02). Post-operative fracture deformity was similar in the four groups with, however, a higher proportion of residual malalignment in the screw-fixation group. The final anatomic axis was 3. 3 ± 1. 4 ° with the blade-plate versus 2. 3 ± 3. 7 ° with the other three <b>fixation</b> <b>devices.</b> The blade-plate group had few patients with axial malalignment, and the degree of malalignment was limited to 3 ° of varus and 10 ° of valgus at the most, compared to 10 ° and 18 ° respectively, with the other three <b>fixation</b> <b>devices.</b> ConclusionDespite the now extremely limited use and teaching of blade-plate fixation, as well as the undeniable technical challenges raised by the implantation of this device, the blade-plate is a simple, strong, and inexpensive fixation method. It remains reliable for the fixation of distal femoral fractures. The disfavour into which the blade-plate is currently falling is not warranted. Level of evidenceIII, case-control study...|$|R

30|$|The {{stability}} {{provided through}} the <b>fixation</b> <b>device</b> (irrespective of {{whether this is}} external or internal) is not static.

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis {{is focused on}} comparative stress strain analysis of a spinal segment with a malleable <b>fixation</b> <b>device</b> and a physiologic spinal segment. In its opening a research study from available sources is carried out. It covers the contemporary state of scientific studies in the given area, anatomy of individual components of the spine, material properties, ways and magnitudes of loadings and also the most common FE model used in similar problems solved. To create a model of geometry of a spinal segment CT scans of a spinal segment of a 38 -year-old woman are used. Then they are subsequently used in the modeling software SolidWorks to create the model of geometry of two lumbar vertebras L 4 - L 5 and a malleable <b>fixation</b> <b>device.</b> Using the computational system ANSYS Workbench, the complete computational model of the spinal motional segment with a malleable <b>fixation</b> <b>device</b> is compiled, covering models of material, loading and bonds. On {{the basis of the}} computational solution of FEM models for different ways of loading, a stress-strain analysis is performed. To compare obtained results a detailed comparative analysis with the physiological spinal segment, the segment with the degenerated disc and the segment with applied "rigid" <b>fixation</b> <b>device</b> is carried out. Within the stress strain analysis of the spinal segment with malleable <b>fixation</b> <b>device,</b> an analysis of the magnitude of the strain intensity of spongious bone tissue around the implanted transpedicular screw, depending on the cord pretension of the malleable <b>fixation</b> <b>device,</b> is performed...|$|E

30|$|Many {{different}} <b>fixation</b> <b>devices</b> {{are used}} to maintain the correction angle after medial open wedge high tibial osteotomy (MOWHTO). Each device must provide at least sufficient mechanical stability to avoid loss of correction and unwanted fracture of the contralateral cortex until the bone heals. In the present study, the mechanical stability of following different implants was compared: the TomoFix small stature (sm), the TomoFix standard (std), the Contour Lock, the iBalance and the second generation PEEKPower. Simplified loading, usually consisting of a vertical load applied to the tibia plateau, is used for experimental testing of <b>fixation</b> <b>devices</b> and also in numerical studies. Therefore, this study additionally compared this simplified experimental loading with a more realistic loading that includes the muscle forces.|$|R
