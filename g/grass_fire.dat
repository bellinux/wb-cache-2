5|$|A {{wildfire}} or {{wildland fire}} is {{a fire in}} an area of combustible vegetation that occurs in the countryside or rural area. Depending on the type of vegetation where it occurs, a wildfire can also be classified more specifically as a brush fire, bush fire, desert fire, forest fire, <b>grass</b> <b>fire,</b> hill fire, peat fire, vegetation fire, or veld fire. Fossil charcoal indicates that wildfires began soon after the appearance of terrestrial plants 420 million years ago. Wildfire’s occurrence throughout the history of terrestrial life invites conjecture that fire must have had pronounced evolutionary effects on most ecosystems' flora and fauna.|$|E
5|$|Also at {{dawn the}} first {{attack by the}} Fallschirmjäger Machine Gun Battalion to the south began, when they opened fire with their machine guns and mortars. Their first assault was against the 2nd Parachute Battalion's positions, and was unsuccessful. However, their next assault, later in the morning, succeeded in {{capturing}} Johnny II, {{the second of the}} small hills. Lieutenant Colonel John Frost, in command of the 2nd Parachute Battalion, immediately counterattacked, but his men were repulsed after sustaining a number of casualties. At 09:00 a forward observation officer attached to the 2nd Parachute Battalion managed to make radio contact with the British cruiser HMS Newfoundland, which then used its 6-inch guns to target the Fallschirmjäger positions. The naval gunfire had the desired effect, causing the Germans some casualties and keeping them under cover. From then on, German resistance from the south was restricted to harassing machine gun fire. A <b>grass</b> <b>fire</b> they started did force the 2nd Parachute Battalion to abandon Johnny I, and the remnants of the battalion now concentrated on Johnny III.|$|E
5|$|Most Pokémon {{evolve into}} other forms when certain {{conditions}} are met, {{such as when}} they reach a certain level—levels range from 1 to 100—or have a certain item used on them. They can learn up to four moves, including attacking moves, healing moves, and moves that inflict status conditions on the opponent. They have six stats that affect battle performance: maximum HP (hit points), Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed. Attack and Special Attack are distinguished from Defense and Special Defense by the types of moves being considered: generally, moves involving physical exertion are physical, while moves involving supernatural or elemental powers are special. Moves are classed as one of seventeen types, (Normal, Water, <b>Grass,</b> <b>Fire,</b> Electric, Ghost, Bug, Fighting, Ice, Steel, Rock, Poison, Psychic, Dark, Dragon, Ground, and Flying); Pokémon can {{have one or two}} types. Generally, most of a Pokémon's moves correspond to its typing. A Pokémon's type makes it vulnerable or resistant to others; for example, Fire-type Pokémon are weak to Water-type moves, while Grass-type moves do little damage to them and Electric-type moves do normal damage.|$|E

50|$|First {{described}} in 1994, {{it is most}} closely related to Cycas maconochiei. The <b>grass</b> <b>fires</b> that are so beneficial to Cycas armstrongii, seem to do some damage to this species populations. With these <b>grass</b> <b>fires,</b> many seeds are easily killed off, as are seedlings in these ever more common events. However, the conservation status is considered stable due to its inhospitable habitat and healthy number of individuals.|$|R

25|$|Around 2015 Yellow <b>Grass</b> <b>Fire</b> Rescue {{moved into}} their current fire hall at 308 Railway Ave. E. In early 2015 Yellow <b>Grass</b> <b>Fire</b> Rescue {{purchased}} a used Freightliner FL80 pumper truck, designated Engine 1, {{to accommodate the}} increasing amount of necessary equipment. Due {{to the number of}} accidents on Highway 39, the need for hydraulic extrication tools arose, and in 2014 YGFR purchased Jaws of Life. In 2017 YGFR purchased a Ram 2500 utility/brush truck. Around the same time, Engine 2, a 1984 Ford fire engine, and the Rescue Unit, a modified ambulance, were retired.|$|E
25|$|Radiochemistry also {{includes}} {{the study of the}} behaviour of radioisotopes in the environment; for instance, a forest or <b>grass</b> <b>fire</b> can make radioisotopes become mobile again. In these experiments, fires were started in the exclusion zone around Chernobyl and the radioactivity in the air downwind was measured.|$|E
25|$|On 9February a man {{was arrested}} in {{connection}} with the fires at Narre Warren; it was alleged by police that he had been operating a power tool, sparks from which ignited a <b>grass</b> <b>fire,</b> destroying two houses. On 12February, two people were arrested {{in connection with the}} fires, having been observed by members of the public acting suspiciously in areas between Yea and Seymour, however they were subsequently released without charges being laid.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{causing the}} {{destruction}} of lands, foods and belongings, fire {{could also be used}} to divert manpower. 13th century Mongol armies regularly sent out small detachments from their main forces to start <b>grass</b> <b>fires</b> and fire settlements as diversions.|$|R
50|$|The northernmost subspecies, G. b. cactorum, {{commonly}} called the cactus ferruginous pygmy owl, was a listed Endangered species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. This protected it in south-central Arizona from loss of habitat and buffel <b>grass</b> <b>fires.</b> Buffel <b>grass</b> catches <b>fire</b> very easy, which spreads to cacti, burning the owl's primary habitat.|$|R
50|$|These {{swallows}} {{are usually}} found over grassland where they hawk insects. They may sometimes {{take advantage of}} <b>grass</b> <b>fires</b> and grazing cattle that flush insects into the air.|$|R
25|$|The number 4 engine {{ripped through}} {{the roof of a}} cabinet shop in San Bruno. Slashing through a wooden beam, the jet engine then {{penetrated}} an 8-inch thick concrete wall, damaging equipment outside, and came to rest on a mound of dirt. A large section of wing came down on Grand Avenue in South San Francisco, starting a <b>grass</b> <b>fire.</b> A 6-foot section of the wing hit the ground in Holy Cross cemetery and a charred chunk of the engine exhaust struck the rear of a housing area, also in South San Francisco. No injuries were reported.|$|E
25|$|Thousands of coal {{fires are}} burning around the world. Those burning {{underground}} {{can be difficult}} to locate and many cannot be extinguished. Fires can cause the ground above to subside, their combustion gases are dangerous to life, and breaking out to the surface can initiate surface wildfires. Coal seams can be set on fire by spontaneous combustion or contact with a mine fire or surface fire. Lightning strikes are an important source of ignition. The coal continues to burn slowly back into the seam until oxygen (air) can no longer reach the flame front. A <b>grass</b> <b>fire</b> in a coal area can set dozens of coal seams on fire. Coal fires in China burn an estimated 120 million tons of coal a year, emitting 360 million metric tons of CO2, amounting to 2–3% of the annual worldwide production of CO2 from fossil fuels. In Centralia, Pennsylvania (a borough located in the Coal Region of the United States), an exposed vein of anthracite ignited in 1962 due to a trash fire in the borough landfill, located in an abandoned anthracite strip mine pit. Attempts to extinguish the fire were unsuccessful, and it continues to burn underground to this day. The Australian Burning Mountain was originally believed to be a volcano, but the smoke and ash come from a coal fire that has been burning for some 6,000 years.|$|E
500|$|Fort Livingstone {{continued}} {{to serve as}} a small outpost until being totally destroyed by a prairie <b>grass</b> <b>fire</b> in 1884. The nearest modern settlement to the original Fort Livingstone site is Pelly, Saskatchewan, [...] to the south. The fort is sometimes referred to as Fort Pelly or Swan River. The Fort Livingstone site is marked with a plaque as was declared a Saskatchewan provincial heritage site and contains no resident population.|$|E
25|$|There is {{also some}} {{evidence}} that road-killed birds and animals are also consumed both on the wintering grounds and on the breeding grounds. The species commonly follows tractors and other agricultural equipment during haying or ploughing, where rodents are exposed for the hawks to capture, or insects are uncovered after crop cutting. Wildfires often attract foraging Swainson's hawks, especially <b>grass</b> <b>fires</b> in their South American wintering range. In South American <b>grass</b> <b>fires,</b> the hawks frequently wait {{around the edges of}} the fire, picking off not only insects but also vertebrates including nothuras, lizards and snakes.|$|R
40|$|Sequential band- 6 {{imagery of}} the Zambesi Basin of {{southern}} Africa recorded substantial changes in burn patterns resulting from late dry season <b>grass</b> <b>fires.</b> One example from northern Botswana, indicates that a fire consumed approximately 70 square miles of grassland over a 24 -hour period. Another example from western Zambia indicates increased fire activity over a 19 -day period. Other examples clearly define the area of widespread <b>grass</b> <b>fires</b> in Angola, Botswana, Rhodesia and Zambia. From the fire patterns visible on the sequential portions of the imagery, and the time intervals involved, the rates of spread of the fires are estimated and compared with estimates derived from experimental burning plots in Zambia and Canada. It is concluded that sequential ERTS- 1 imagery, of the quality studied, clearly provides the information needed to detect and map <b>grass</b> <b>fires</b> and to monitor their rates of spread in this region during the late dry season...|$|R

2500|$|Following several defeats and massacres in 1812, {{notably the}} Fort Dearborn Massacre and the Pigeon Roost Massacre, a joint punitive {{campaign}} {{was sent to}} Illinois Territory under the commands of Major General Samuel Hopkins and Colonel William Russell. [...] Russell, coming from the Siege of Fort Harrison, led a force of Illinois militia and Indiana Rangers, and was successful in destroying a hostile Kickapoo village on Peoria Lake. [...] Russell had to retreat to Cahokia, however, when he could not locate the forces under Hopkins. [...] Hopkins could not get his Kentucky militia to engage, and had been driven back to Vincennes when the Kickapoo started a prairie <b>grass</b> <b>fire.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Under {{the terms}} of the exclusive-use contract, Tanker 910 was {{activated}} against the 2007 White Fire, where it flew two runs before incurring its incident. After repairs were completed, it was activated for use on the massive Zaca Fire, the second-largest fire in modern California history, in August 2007. Tanker 910 was also activated for the Moonlight Fire in Plumas County in September 2007. On October 22, Tanker 910 became involved in the effort to extinguish several California wildfires, including the Slide Fire and the <b>Grass</b> <b>Fire</b> near Lake Arrowhead. The next activation came on November 24, 2007, when the tanker joined the effort to fight the Corral Fire above Malibu, California ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{seasonally}} dry climates oaks {{are often}} fire-resistant, particularly in open grasslands, as a <b>grass</b> <b>fire</b> {{is insufficient to}} ignite the scattered trees. In contrast a eucalyptus forest tends to promote fire because of the volatile and highly combustible oils produced by the leaves, {{as well as the}} production of large amounts of litter which is high in phenolics, preventing its breakdown by fungi and thus accumulates as large amounts of dry, combustible fuel. Consequently, dense eucalypt plantings may be subject to catastrophic firestorms. [...] In fact, almost thirty years before the Oakland firestorm of 1991, a study of eucalyptus in the area warned that the litter beneath the trees builds up very rapidly and should be regularly monitored and removed. It has been estimated that 70% of the energy released through the combustion of vegetation in the Oakland fire was due to eucalyptus. In a National Park Service study, {{it was found that the}} fuel load (in tons per acre) of non-native eucalyptus woods is almost three times as great as native oak woodland.|$|E

60|$|Half an {{hour later}} Beatrice was in the saddle riding across the bare sweep of prairie {{to one of the}} distant homesteads. When she reached the river, the stream was turbid and running fast, but a narrow trail through the poplars on its bank led to the ford, and she urged her horse into it fearlessly. On the other side the trail was very faint, and a stake upon a rise {{indicated}} where the crossing was safe. A large <b>grass</b> <b>fire</b> was burning some miles away, for a tawny cloud of smoke trailed across the plain.|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} of the emergence and spread of <b>grass</b> <b>fires</b> {{is a matter for}} many years of research in the countries where they are one of the major natural and man-made environmental and economic risks. Burning non-forest vegetation in Russia can occur not only in the steppe and forest-steppe, and forest and limitrophe (located between them) areas. This is facilitated by the natural conditions and human factors associated with the burning of dry grass, so called agriculture fell, in autumn and spring. Fires cause significant damage to the grass plant ecosystems. They may be the cause of occurrence of forest and peat fires and cause material damage to businesses and population. Monitoring and elimination of <b>grass</b> <b>fires</b> is a difficult problem because firefighting should engage municipal and private entities Patterns of burning herbs are different from forest and peat fires, but model for predicting forest fires are mainly developed in Russia. Therefore, the aim {{of this study is to}} develop a method for assessing and forecasting the potential for <b>grass</b> <b>fires</b> on the example of the southern part of the Far East and the geographic information system for its implementation. </p...|$|R

50|$|Cycas campestris is {{a species}} of cycad in the genus Cycas, native to southeastern Papua New Guinea in the lowland region near Port Moresby. It grows in open, grassy locations, often in areas with {{frequent}} <b>grass</b> <b>fires.</b>|$|R
60|$|In the meantime, Gallwey and {{the young}} trooper picked their way {{along the edge of}} the bluff. The night was dark and hazy, and there were no stars in the sky. The smoke of a big <b>grass</b> <b>fire</b> drifted in a grey mist athwart the sweep of the plain. Now and then a crimson blaze leapt up and faded on the horizon, and the still air was heavy with the smell of burning. It was {{advisable}} to ride cautiously, for there were a good many badger-holes, and here and there the ground was seamed by a watercourse. Brittle branches occasionally snapped in the dense silence.|$|E
6000|$|The Sergeant nodded. [...] "It {{will be the}} whisky boys," [...] he said. [...] "You can bluff the law for awhile, if you're smart enough, but it's quite hard to keep it up, and {{the first}} mistake you make, it's got you sure. In another way, Mr. Leland's right. I'd have done nothing with my few troopers if he hadn't brought you in. We have nothing to raise trouble over--a few steers and horses missing, a <b>grass</b> <b>fire</b> raised. They're things that happen all the time. The whisky boys know {{it as well as}} I do, and, since I can't get more troopers, it means that what is done must be done by you. They know that, too, and it's running up quite a big account against the man who's leading you." ...|$|E
60|$|Beatrice spent a {{pleasant}} hour {{with her friend}} and started home alone as dusk was falling. The sky was clear, and the moon hung some distance above the horizon. A cold breeze had sprung up, and the <b>grass</b> <b>fire</b> had grown fiercer. Beatrice could see it stretching toward the river in a long red line; {{and after a while}} she rode into the smoke. It grew thicker and more acrid; she could not see her way; and her horse was getting frightened. When an orange glare leaped up not far away, the animal broke into a gallop, pulling hard, and after some trouble in stopping it Beatrice changed her direction. She was not afraid of prairie fires, which, as a rule, can be avoided easily, but this one would necessitate her making a round.|$|E
50|$|Annual <b>grass</b> <b>fires</b> {{are common}} in its natural habitats. The species is {{extremely}} fire tolerant, and the usually early spring fires initiate a profusion of new leaf growth in the plants, thus the common name, fire fern.|$|R
5000|$|This {{species is}} unusual in that it sprouts from the stump when cut or burned, which has {{probably}} allowed it {{to remain in the}} grasslands in spite of periodic <b>grass</b> <b>fires</b> that kill all other juniper species.|$|R
50|$|It rarely hovers, {{preferring to}} hunt from a perch {{in a tree}} or on a rock. It feeds on insects, lizards and small mammals. It {{generally}} catches food on the ground but also hunts for flying insects escaping from <b>grass</b> <b>fires.</b>|$|R
