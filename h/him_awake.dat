5|$|As Jerry is {{sleeping}} on the plane he dreams of returning to his apartment only to find several FBI agents there interrogating Kramer, who apparently has ratted out Jerry. When Jerry protests that {{he had nothing to}} do with it, they reveal that the Russian was an undercover FBI agent. Jerry tries to flee only to be gunned down by the agents. This jolts <b>him</b> <b>awake.</b> He finds his show is canceled due to bad weather, and George picks up Jerry at the airport. Jerry is initially amazed that George is perfectly willing, even anxious to drive Jerry home. When he informs George they cannot go back to his apartment because of the baby shower, George insists and Jerry discovers that George is wearing the red shirt and is just using the favor as a chance to encounter Leslie at the baby shower. Meanwhile, Kramer and the two Russians crash the shower to install cable television, start to eat all the food and get into a heated argument. When George and Jerry arrive, George's plan proves unsuccessful, as he cannot muster the courage confront Leslie and instead awkwardly tries to curry her favor. He is interrupted when one of the other party guests (Margaret Reed as Mary) suddenly confronts Jerry because he never called her back after a date. This unpleasant scene is the final straw and the guests leave hurriedly. On the way out of the bathroom the angry woman bumps Leslie and her dessert into George, adding a chocolate cake stain to the Bosco stain already on the shirt. Jerry changes his mind about the cable hook-up, but is still charged with a large amount of money. When he refuses to pay, the Russians break the picture tube of his television set.|$|E
25|$|After 1875, many of Amasa Stone's {{businesses}} suffered severe financial setbacks, {{and some}} of them failed. He suffered from stomach ulcers which often kept <b>him</b> <b>awake</b> for two hours each night. It was widely believed by the public that the Ashtabula River bridge disaster had deeply affected Stone emotionally, causing his health to worsen after 1876.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after leaving}} Beamont Secondary Technical School, Clark {{attended}} the Regional College of Art in Manchester at aged 16. Ossie {{had to get}} up very early in the morning to make the long trip from home to college each day. Anne Clark would give Ossie prescribed pills to keep <b>him</b> <b>awake</b> and alert. This would be the start of a lifelong addiction to both prescribed and illegal drugs.|$|E
60|$|She flung {{her head}} saucily for answer. In the {{meantime}} his Grace, talking coldly to Comyn, {{had been looking}} unutterable thunders at me. I thought of <b>him</b> <b>awaking</b> in the dew at Covent Garden, and could scarce keep from laughing in his face. Mr. Marmaduke squirmed to the front.|$|R
50|$|The {{official}} releases through Viz and Hakusensha {{included two}} bonus stories. The first, Jigoku Kokyuu no Hitsuyou, {{centers on a}} boy that finds <b>him</b> <b>awoken</b> from his nap by a girl's kiss, while the second story, Fureru Ondo deals with a male student that hates being touched by anyone other than the female biology teacher.|$|R
60|$|He undressed 'imself and {{got into}} the bed he shared with Peter, and kept <b>'im</b> <b>awake</b> for hours by telling 'im in a loud voice about all the gals he'd made love to in his life, and partikler about one gal that always fainted dead away {{whenever}} she saw either a red-'aired man or a monkey.|$|R
25|$|In January 1987, MacKenzie {{published}} a totally unfounded front-page story alleging that pop singer Elton John had {{had sex with}} underage rentboys. Shortly afterwards, MacKenzie published further entirely false allegations that the singer had had the voiceboxes of his guard dogs removed because their barking kept <b>him</b> <b>awake</b> at night. MacKenzie confirmed their inaccuracy shortly after publication by sending a reporter to the singer's house, who quickly discovered that all of his guard dogs were quite capable of barking.|$|E
25|$|On November 24, 1966 (Thanksgiving Day), Hughes {{arrived in}} Las Vegas by {{railroad}} car {{and moved into}} the Desert Inn. Because he refused to leave the hotel and to avoid further conflicts with the owners, Hughes bought the Desert Inn in early 1967. The hotel's eighth floor became the nerve center of Hughes' empire and the ninth-floor penthouse became his personal residence. Between 1966 and 1968, he bought several other hotel-casinos, including the Castaways, New Frontier, the Landmark Hotel and Casino, and the Sands. He bought the small Silver Slipper casino {{for the sole purpose}} of moving its trademark neon silver slipper. Visible from Hughes' bedroom, it had apparently kept <b>him</b> <b>awake</b> at night.|$|E
25|$|The race to win {{the prize}} {{required}} time-saving design compromises, Donald A. Hall decided that the empennage (tail assembly) and wing control surfaces would not be altered from his original Ryan M-2 design, thus minimizing redesign time that was not available without delaying the flight. The result was less aerodynamic stability; nevertheless, the experienced Lindbergh approved the unaltered design. This setup resulted in a negatively stable design that tended to randomly introduce unanticipated pitch, yaw, and bank (roll) elements into its overall flight characteristics. There is dispute regarding whether Hall and Lindbergh also preferred this design because they anticipated that the continuous corrections to the random movements of the aircraft would help to keep Lindbergh awake during the estimated 40-hour flight. Whether or not the unstable design was deliberately retained to help fight fatigue, Lindbergh did later write how these random unanticipated movements helped keep <b>him</b> <b>awake</b> at various times during the flight. The stiff wicker seat in the cockpit was also purposely uncomfortable, although custom fitted to Lindbergh's tall and lanky frame.|$|E
6000|$|... "I knew I {{could trust}} to your sympathy; you haven't failed me yet," [...] he said gently. [...] "I wonder why Gerald {{broke away from}} the rascal at last. I may be wrong, but I'd like to believe that when the time came he found he could not betray his friends; that his heart spoke, and a trace of the honor we tried to teach <b>him</b> <b>awoke</b> to life." ...|$|R
6000|$|But up she got, and up {{she made}} them get, [...] With some pretence about the sun, that makes [...] Sweet skies {{just when he}} rises, or is set; [...] And 't is, no doubt, a sight to see when breaks [...] Bright Phoebus, while the {{mountains}} still are wet [...] With mist, and every bird with <b>him</b> <b>awakes,</b> [...] And night is flung off like a mourning suit [...] Worn for a husband,--or some other brute.|$|R
6000|$|The river {{suggested}} {{fishing and}} so he dawdled upon its shores, catching fish after a fashion of his own devising and eating them raw. When night came he {{curled up in a}} great tree beside the stream--the one from which he had been fishing during the afternoon--and was soon asleep. Numa, roaring beneath <b>him,</b> <b>awoke</b> <b>him.</b> He was about to call out in anger to his noisy neighbor when something else caught his attention. He listened. Was there something in the tree beside himself? Yes, he heard the noise of something below him trying to clamber upward. Presently he heard the click of a crocodile's jaws in the waters beneath, and then, low but distinct: [...] "By George! The beggar nearly got me." [...] The voice was familiar.|$|R
500|$|In The King of Fighters: Kyo, a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} situated before KOF '97, Iori appears as Kyo's antagonist in his journey around the world. Iori {{appears in the}} spin-off video games [...] In the North American editions of Maximum Impact, Iori is voiced by Eric Summerer. Iori also appears as a sub-boss during The King of Fighters Ex: Neo Blood, which is situated after his fight against Orochi. Although Iori enters the tournament to fight Kyo, Geese Howard, the organizer of the tournament, tries to make <b>him</b> <b>awake</b> his Riot of the Blood to absorb his powers, but fails. In The King of Fighters EX2: Howling Blood, Iori enters another tournament, and is joined by two {{women who want to}} find a man controlled by the Orochi power. The [...] shooter game KOF: Sky Stage also features him as a boss.|$|E
2500|$|Hussain was {{captain of}} both the Test and One Day International England teams until after the 2003 Cricket World Cup, when England {{failed to make the}} second round after boycotting their match against Zimbabwe in Harare, citing {{security}} concerns. But as he stated in his autobiography Playing With Fire, the whole Zimbabwe question and the responsibility of whether or not to play against Zimbabwe was left to the captain and it was a question that [...] "kept <b>him</b> <b>awake</b> at night".|$|E
2500|$|In January 1965, Tezuka {{received}} a letter from American film director Stanley Kubrick, who had watched Astro Boy and wanted to invite Tezuka to be the art director of his next movie, [...] (1968). Although flattered by Kubrick's invitation, Tezuka could not afford to leave his studio for a year to live in England, so he had to turn it down. Although he could not work on it, he loved the film, and would play its soundtrack at maximum volume in his studio to keep <b>him</b> <b>awake</b> during long nights of work.|$|E
6000|$|... "Caught in a tree, by Jupiter!" [...] and all {{visions of}} heaven {{vanished}} in a breath, {{as he sat}} up and stared about <b>him,</b> wide <b>awake</b> now, and conscious of many aching bones.|$|R
60|$|At length, {{as he lay}} {{sleeping}} in a flower-bell, a little bee came wandering by, and knew him for the wicked Thistle; so he called his friends, and, as they flew murmuring around <b>him,</b> he <b>awoke.</b>|$|R
50|$|Thomas Edison also {{endorsed}} the wine, claiming it helped <b>him</b> stay <b>awake</b> longer. Ulysses S. Grant {{was also a}} fan of the wine, which he began drinking while writing his memoirs towards the end of his life.|$|R
2500|$|Dominic Monaghan as Dr. Simon Campos– {{a quantum}} {{physicist}} and research partner of Stanford academic Lloyd Simcoe, who doesn't {{believe he is}} responsible for the blackout. He told people that in his flashforward he sees himself fighting and later killing a man, which was actually a lie. In [...] "Revelation Zero (Part 2)", it is revealed that he is [...] "Suspect Zero;" [...] he was given a ring that kept <b>him</b> <b>awake</b> during the blackout. His uncle is the middle man in the deal, and Simon's younger sister is kidnapped by the people that want to control the blackouts. Simon's uncle had previously killed Simon's father, and after he also kills Simon's professor, Simon kills him. (15 episodes) ...|$|E
60|$|Apart {{from this}} he had few worries, {{certainly}} none {{serious enough to}} keep <b>him</b> <b>awake.</b>|$|E
60|$|Charlie said {{it took a}} {{good deal}} to keep <b>him</b> <b>awake,</b> {{and that he should}} {{probably}} get accustomed to it, ere long.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Mrs. Markham positively, [...] "when he's {{able to be}} out again, I shall {{consider}} it my duty to look him up, {{and try to keep}} <b>him</b> sufficiently <b>awake</b> in the daytime to ensure his resting better at night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sometimes {{the devil}} of strong gin makes <b>him</b> keep <b>awake,</b> and {{he walks up}} and down the {{verandah}} all night, cursing; then we stand afar off," [...] explained Mrs. Almayer, with the fuller knowledge born of twenty odd years of married life.|$|R
60|$|Courthorne stood still, {{looking at}} her, {{for almost a}} minute, while the wild {{reckless}} devil that was in <b>him</b> <b>awoke.</b> Clever as he was, he was apt {{now and then to}} fling prudence to the winds, and he was swayed by an almost uncontrollable impulse to stay beside the girl who, he realized, though she recognized his worthlessness, loved him still. That he did not love her, and, perhaps, never had done so, did not count with him. It was in his nature to find pleasure in snatching her from a better man. Then some faint sense of the wantonness and cruelty of it came upon him, and by a tense effort he made her a little inclination that was not ironical.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{too tired}} to look. If you find {{anything}} interesting, read it out," [...] said Midwinter, thinking that the reading might help to keep <b>him</b> <b>awake.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Only {{from the}} doorway. It seems he ate and drank hardly at all, and the {{sergeant}} had some difficulty in keeping <b>him</b> <b>awake</b> until you came." ...|$|E
60|$|Indeed, {{he needed}} the strongest sleep he could get; for the earth was still full of {{darkness}} {{and a kind of}} morning fog when his fellow-fugitive shook <b>him</b> <b>awake.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Silent, open-mouthed, staring, Stinchfield {{heard the}} zither descend {{to the table}} before <b>him.</b> Then he <b>awoke.</b> [...] "I must {{photograph}} that!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Nonetheless, Manthor desired Chieftainship, {{and when}} Húrin {{returned}} to Brethil {{and found his}} wife Morwen dying, the [...] "shadow" [...] of the Curse of Morgoth that followed <b>him</b> <b>awoke</b> Manthor's dormant ambitions. He perceived that Húrin had come with no good intentions, but used the fear surrounding his appearance to overthrow Hardang. Cunningly using the laws of Brethil, he summoned the Folkmoot where he accused the Halad of dishonouring the guest. Although Manthor had [...] "a great natural concern for 'courtesy' - sc. civilized behaviour and mercy", he now in eloquent words set the people against Hardang and his following, the chief of whom was Avranc. This resulted in the burning of the Hall of the Chieftains and slaying of Hardang; Manthor {{tried to stop the}} Folk, but his attempts were futile.|$|R
60|$|When Earl awoke it {{was still}} dark. He roused up with a start, to find the wind blowing violently. Outside it was raining and snowing together, and it was some snow on his face which had caused <b>him</b> to <b>awake.</b> He {{was about to get}} up, when Randy called to him.|$|R
60|$|And {{he chewed}} the corn till {{he felt he}} was growing sleepy, and then he put some grit into his mouth, and that kept <b>him</b> <b>awake</b> till the bird came.|$|E
60|$|I {{was left}} alone with Tom, whom we had laid on a couch. He lay very still, {{and his eyes were}} half closed. I began my work of keeping <b>him</b> <b>awake.</b>|$|E

6000|$|As he spoke, Tommy {{opened his}} eyes, gave a stretch, and said, [...] "Hollo, Billy," [...] as calmly {{as if in}} his own bed at home. Then the rustle of the leaves, the {{moonlight}} in his face, {{and the sight of}} several men staring down at him startled <b>him</b> wide <b>awake.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] she replied, {{so violently}} that it {{appeared}} to <b>awake</b> <b>him</b> {{to the fact that}} there was some one besides himself to consider.|$|R
50|$|A dull, office {{dwelling}} loser named Wes Selman gets {{a strange}} birthday present from an uncle {{to get his}} house painted forcing <b>him</b> to <b>awake</b> at 6 a.m. and leading him on a two-hour odyssey through a strange other world where everything magically goes his way till 8 a.m. that Saturday morning.|$|R
