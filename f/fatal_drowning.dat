40|$|Introduction Drowning {{remains a}} {{leading cause of}} {{preventable}} death in children across the world. This systematic review identifies and critically analyses studies of interventions designed to reduce <b>fatal</b> and non-fatal <b>drowning</b> events among children and adolescents or reduce the injury severity incurred by such incidents. Methods A systematic search was undertaken on literature published between 1980 and 2010 relating to interventions around <b>fatal</b> and non-fatal <b>drowning</b> prevention in children and adolescents 0 – 19  years of age. Search methods and protocols developed and used by the WHO Global Burden of Disease Injury Expert Group were applied. Results Seven studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Interventions were categorised into three themes of Education, Swimming Lessons and Water Safety, and Pool Fencing. All are possible effective strategies to prevent children from drowning, particularly young children aged 2 – 4  years, but very little evidence exists for interventions to reduce drowning in older children and adolescents. There were methodological limitations associated with all studies, so results need to be interpreted in the context of these. Conclusions Relatively few studies employ rigorous methods and high levels of evidence {{to assess the impact of}} interventions designed to reduce drowning. Studies are also limited by lack of consistency in measured outcomes and drowning terminology. Further work is required to establish efficacy of interventions for older children and adolescents. There is a need for rigorous, well-designed studies that use consistent terminology to demonstrate effective prevention solutions...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The World Health Organization (WHO) {{estimates}} {{that there are}} at least 372, 000 deaths by drowning each year, making drowning the third leading cause of unintentional injury death worldwide. Despite its global impact, drowning remains a neglected public health issue and relatively under-researched area. Objective: (1) To conduct a comprehensive epidemiological investigation and address gaps in our understanding of the drowning problem at the global, national, and local level; and (2) to provide policy-makers and advocates with comprehensive information to inform their drowning prevention efforts. Methods: This study involved retrospective reviews of five data sources: (1) global drowning data were extracted from the WHO mortality database for all countries that reported deaths using ICD- 10 drowning codes; (2) data on non-fatal drowning victims who required hospital admission in Canada were obtained from the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) s Discharge Abstract Database; (3) data on non-fatal drowning victims who required an emergency department visit were obtained from CIHIs National Ambulatory Care Reporting System; (4) data on unintentional <b>fatal</b> <b>drowning</b> deaths in Canada were obtained from the Drowning Prevention Research Centre (DPRC) database; (5) data on child drowning fatalities in private backyard pools in Ontario were collected from the case files at the Office of the Chief Coroner for Ontario using a structured questionnaire. Results: The results presented in this dissertation can inform drowning prevention globally, nationally, and locally. Internationally, official data categorization methods contribute to an underestimation of the burden of <b>fatal</b> <b>drowning.</b> In Canada, <b>fatal</b> <b>drowning</b> {{is only part of the}} problem; non-fatal drowning presents a substantial burden and the characteristics of non-fatal drowning differ significantly from <b>fatal</b> <b>drowning.</b> Further, although bystander intervention plays an important role in the survival of a drowning person, non-professional bystanders often intervene with high-risk, contact rescues, or do not attempt a rescue at all. Finally, children who drown in private backyard pools in Ontario often access the pool directly from the residence, yet most municipalities have not enacted isolation fencing bylaws.

Design, Setting and Participants: Retrospective population-based study used data linkage to capture both <b>fatal</b> and non-fatal <b>drowning</b> cases (N = 1299) among children aged 0 - 19 years in Queensland, from 2002 - 2008 inclusive. Patient data were accessed from pre-hospital, emergency department, hospital admission and death data, and linked manually to collate data across the continuum of care. Main Outcome Measures: Incidence rates were calculated separately by age group and gender for events resulting in death, hospital admission, and non-admission. Trends over time were analysed. Results: Drowning death to survival ratio was 1 : 10, and {{two out of three}} of those who survived were admitted to hospital. Incidence rates for <b>fatal</b> and non-fatal <b>drowning</b> increased over time, primarily due to an increase in non-fatal drowning.

40|$|Objective: This {{retrospective}} population-based {{study examined}} drowning location by {{the site of}} immersion for both <b>fatal</b> and non-fatal <b>drowning</b> events in Queensland. Drowning location is not routinely collected, and this study used data linkage to identify drowning sites. The resulting enhanced quality data quantify drowning incidence for specific locations by geographic region, age group and by severity for the first time. Design: Linked data were accessed from the continuum of care (prehospital, emergency, hospital admission and death data) on <b>fatal</b> and non-fatal <b>drowning</b> episodes in children aged 0 - 19  years in Queensland for the years 2002 - 2008 inclusive. Results: Drowning locations ranked in order of overall incidence were pools, inland water, coastal water, baths and other man-made water hazards. Swimming pools produced the highest incidence rates (7. 31 / 100   000) for overall drowning events and were more often privately owned pools and in affluent neighbourhoods. Toddlers 0 - 4  years were most at risk around pools (23. 94 / 100   000), and static water bodies such as dams and buckets-the fatality ratios were highest at these 2 locations for this age group. Children 5 - 14  years incurred the lowest incidence rates regardless of drowning location. Adolescents 15 - 19  years were more frequently involved in a drowning incident on the coast shoreline, followed by inland dynamic water bodies. Conclusions: Linked data {{have resulted in the}} most comprehensive data collection on drowning location and severity to date for children in the state of Queensland. Most mortality and morbidity could have been prevented by improving water safety through engaged supervision around pools and bath time, and a heightened awareness of buckets and man-made water hazards around the farm home for young children.

Results: Between 1 July 2002 and 30 June 2012 drowning deaths among people known to be international travelers accounted for 4. 3 % (N[*]=[*] 123) of the 2870 drowning deaths reported in Australian waterways. Key locations for drowning deaths included beaches (39. 0 %), ocean/harbour (22. 0 %) and swimming pools (12. 2 %). Leading activities prior to drowning included swimming (52. 0 %), diving (17. 9 %) and watercraft incidents (13. 0 %). Discussion: International travelers pose a unique challenge from a drowning prevention perspective. The ability to exchange information on water safety is complicated due to potential language barriers, possible differences in swimming ability, different attitudes to safety in the traveler’s home country and culture, a lack of opportunities to discuss safety, a relaxed attitude to safety which may result in an increase in risk taking behaviour and alcohol consumption.

40|$|Introduction: Drowning is {{a leading}} cause of unintentional death. Rivers are a common {{location}} for drowning. Unlike other location-specific prevention efforts (home swimming pools and beaches), little is known about prevention targeting river drowning deaths. Methods: A systematic literature review was undertaken using English language papers published between 1980 and 2014, exploring gaps in the literature, with a focus on epidemiology, risk factors and prevention strategies for river drowning. Results: Twenty-nine papers were deemed relevant to the study design including 21 (72. 4 %) on epidemiology, 18 (62. 1 %) on risk factors and 10 (34. 5 %) that proposed strategies for prevention. Risk factors identified included age, falls into water, swimming, using watercraft, sex and alcohol. Discussion: Gaps were identified in the published literature. These included a lack of an agreed definition for rivers, rates for <b>fatal</b> river <b>drowning</b> (however, crude rates were calculated for 12 papers, ranging from 0. 20 to 1. 89 per 100 000 people per annum), and consensus around risk factors, especially age. There was only one paper that explored a prevention programme; the remaining nine outlined proposed prevention activities. There is a need for studies into exposure patterns for rivers and an agreed definition (with consistent coding). Conclusions: This systematic review has identified that river drowning deaths are an issue in many regions and countries around the world. Further work to address gaps in the published research to date would benefit prevention efforts...|$|R

This study explores community attitudes towards {{the effectiveness of these}} legislative changes and examines child (< 5 years) drowning deaths in pools. Data from the 2011 Queensland Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) Social Survey include results from questions related to pool ownership and pool fencing legislation. <b>Fatal</b> child <b>drowning</b> cases between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2015 were sourced from coronial data.

40|$|I {{appreciate}} Dr. James M. Cross in his observation about theterm electrocution specially 'non fatal electrocution' in myarticle. I {{agree with}} him about his comment. According to dictionary meaning author is right and even many publications supports his opinion. However in my article I used the term 'electrocution' as {{the name of an}} injury mechanism. Many of the authors have also used this term in the same way. According to the WIKI books, electrocution is a related set of injuries caused by direct contact with live electrical connections varying from minor to cardiac arrest [1].

Lee mentioned ''electrocution burns result in approximately 3000 admissions to burn centers every year, while injuries due to electrocution result in death in about 1000 patients yearly''[3]. Shetty et al. used the term fatal-electrocution which in turn agrees with the term non fatal electrocution [4]. I desire to use the word 'electrocution' as a name of an injury mechanism which is caused by electricity and electrocution can be both fatal and non fatal.

MethodWe contacted patients with all types of epilepsy except childhood absence from the Nova Scotia Childhood Epilepsy population-based cohort. Seizure onset was between 1977 and 1985. Patients and parents were asked about serious injuries resulting from a seizure, defined as severe enough for an urgent physician or dentist visit. ResultsOf 595 eligible patients, we contacted 472 (79 %). During an average follow up of 23. 9 ± 8 years, 52 (11 %) experienced ≥ 1 serious injury {{for a total of}} 81 injuries. Of all injuries, 24 (30 %) were lacerations requiring sutures, 15 (19 %) fractures, 11 (14 %) broken teeth, 8 (10 %) concussions, 4 (5 %) burns, and 20 (25 %) other. “Other” included 1 <b>fatal</b> <b>drowning,</b> 2 near-drownings, 3 shoulder dislocations and 1 severe eye injury. Four injuries occurred with the first seizure; all others after a long gap from seizure onset (range 1. 5 – 30 years). Injuries occurred in all epilepsy syndromes, most commonly with symptomatic generalized epilepsy (17 % vs. 11 % p= 0. 03) and intractable epilepsy (28 % vs. 8 % p< 0. 0001).

50|$|Based on data {{gathered}} from the Australia National Coroners' Information System, stepchildren under five years of age are two to fifteen {{times more likely to}} experience an unintentional <b>fatal</b> injury, especially <b>drowning,</b> than genetic children. Additionally, the study finds that the risks of unintentional fatal injury are not significantly higher for genetic children in single parent homes versus two-parent homes. This difference suggests that removing one biological parent from the home does not significantly increase risk to the children, but that adding a nonbiological parent to the home results in a drastic increase in the risk of unintentional fatal injury. Despite the fact that adding a stepparent to the home increases the available resources in terms of supervision in comparison to a single-parent home, risk of unintentional fatal injury still significantly rises. This higher risk of injury for stepchildren {{can be attributed to the}} fact that stepparents occupy the same supervisory role as a genetic parent, yet they have a lower intrinsic commitment to protecting the child and therefore are less likely to be adequately vigilant. The authors conclude that the Cinderella effect applies not only to purposeful abuse by stepparents, but is also relevant to explaining increased rates of accidental fatalities among stepchildren.|$|R
40|$|Drowning {{is a major}} global {{public health}} problem. Effective {{prevention}} of drowning requires programmes and policies that address known risk factors throughout the world.

40|$|Background: Annual global death due to {{drowning}} {{accounts for}} 372, 000 lives, 90 % of which occur in low and middle income countries. Life in Bangladesh exposes {{adults and children}} to may water bodies for daily household needs, {{and as a result}} drowning is common. In Bangladesh, due to lack of systemic data collection, drowning among adults is unknown; most research is focused on childhood drowning. The aim {{of the present study was}} to explore the epidemiology of adulthood drowning deaths in Bangladesh. Methodology: A nationwide cross-sectional survey was conducted from January to December in 2003 among 171, 366 rural and urban households, with a sample of 819, 429 individuals to determine the epidemiology of adulthood drowning in Bangladesh.   Results:  Annual <b>fatal</b> <b>drowning</b> incidence among adults was 5. 85 / 100, 000 individuals. Of these, 71. 4 % were male and 28. 6 % were female (RR 2. 39). In total, 90 % of the fatalities were from rural areas. Rural populations were also found to have a 8. 58 times higher risk of drowning than those in urban areas. About 95 % of drowning occurred in natural water bodies. About 61. 6 % of the deaths occurred at the scene followed by 33. 5 % at the home. Of the drowning fatalities, 67 % took place in water bodies within 100 meters of the household. Among the drowning fatalities 78. 4 % occurred in daylight between 7. 00 and 18. 00. Over 97 % of the victims were from poor socio economic conditions with a monthly income tk. 6, 000 ($ 94) or less. Only 25. 5 % of incidences were reported to the police station. Conclusions: Every year a significant number of adults die due to drowning in Bangladesh.  Populations living in rural areas, especially men, were the main victims of drowning. This survey finding might help policy makers and scientists to understand the drowning scenario among adults in Bangladesh...|$|E

40|$|Background: Drowning in {{developing}} countries is a major, but often neglected, public health problem. However, {{due to a lack}} of reliable or statistical data concerning the impact of drowning in Iran, the need for drowning-prevention measures has not been recognized. The prevention of drowning requires adequate knowledge of its epidemiological characteristics and associated risk factors, and effective interventions. Aim: The overall aim of this thesis is to analyze the magnitude and burden of drowning events, using both epidemiological and economic studies, and to evaluate the feasibility of a drowning intervention package in northern Iran. Material and methods: The geographical range of the studies mainly encompassed water- recreation areas near the Caspian Sea in northern Iran. The main focus of the studies was on describing factors associated with drowning among residents and tourists in northern Iran from 2005 / 6 through to 2008 / 9. Four studies were undertaken. The incidence of drowning fatalities in northern Iran was investigated in a cross-sectional household survey. Age group, gender, place and date of occurrence, and external causes were assessed (Paper I). A capture-recapture analysis was performed to estimate the incidence of drowning using two data registries (Paper II). The costs of drowning were assessed on the basis of case studies in northern Iran. The main cost elements were income, as adjusted by family and years, income impact on the family, and cost of treatment (Paper III). A quasi-experimental design was used to evaluate the feasibility of an intervention package, including pre- and post-observations, in both an intervention and a comparison community, in a water-recreation area by the Caspian Sea in northern Iran and in a residential population near the Caspian Sea coastline. Cross-sectional data were collected at pre-intervention and post-intervention in the study areas (Paper IV). Data for the four studies were derived from Iran’s Death Registry System and Forensic Medicine System, national weekly reports, household surveys, and focus group discussions. Results: During the first year of investigation, 342 unintentional drowning deaths (4. 24 per 100, 000 residential population) occurred in the study area. More than one-third of all victims were under the age of 20, and the male-female risk ratio was 6. 4 : 1 (Paper I). The capture- recapture method estimated that the Forensic Medicine System covered 54 % of cases, and the Death Registry System 70 % (Paper II). When additional information was considered, the estimated economic burden increased dramatically. In fact, the drowning cost of one drowned victim was equivalent to 17 times the country’s per-capita gross domestic product (Paper III). The risk of death from drowning was observed to be greater during the pre-intervention period than during the implementation period (OR= 1. 15 versus 0. 24) in a water-recreation area by the Caspian Sea in northern Iran. The <b>fatal</b> <b>drowning</b> rate in the studied resident population, in two provinces, fell from 4. 24 per 100, 000 residents at baseline to 3. 04 per 100, 000 residents at endline. Drowning rates for tourists could not be computed since denominator data were incomplete. The knowledge and practice of drowning prevention in the resident population increased from 22 % at baseline to 35 % at endline. Overall, the all-risk factors associated with drowning incidents declined to a greater extent in the intervention area than in the control area (Paper IV). Conclusions: The intervention package, developed through research, was found to be feasible in the community considered. However, we need a longer time interval for impact analysis, and adjustment for seasonal variation, to be able fully to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention. We also need to test the package in other, similar communities before we can recommend spread of the package. Further studies are needed to provide a standard instrument for drowning prevention...|$|E
40|$|Background: Drowning is {{a global}} public health problem of children. Children of low- and middle-income {{countries}} are the most susceptible victims. Prevention measures implemented in high-income countries have effectively reduced drowning. However, in low- and middle-income countries, due to a severe lack of information, drowning has not been recognized as a child survival issue. Moreover, prevention efforts remain non-existent {{as there is no}} proven effective measure applicable for these countries, including Bangladesh. Objectives: The objectives of the research activities were to determine the current child drowning situation and risk-factors in rural areas of Bangladesh (Paper I); to understand the community perception of drowning problems and the possible solutions for designing a preventive programme in the rural area of Bangladesh (Paper II); to develop, pilot and assess initial community response to an intervention package in terms of acceptability, feasibility and sustainability (Paper III) and to evaluate the package for its effectiveness (Paper IV). Methods: A cross sectional survey and a case-control study were conducted to determine the magnitude and identify risk-factors of child drowning respectively (Paper I). Community perception on drowning prevention was explored by using a qualitative method (Paper II). Intervention measures were identified through workshops with the relevant stakeholders. Utilizing qualitative methods community acceptability, feasibility and sustainability of the intervention package were initially assessed (Paper III). A quasi-experimental design was used {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the intervention package (Paper IV). Two sub-districts were selected each having a population of 200, 000. One was allocated as an intervention area and the other as a comparison area. Quantitative data was collected through structured pre-tested questionnaires and the qualitative data was gathered through Focus Group Discussions (FDGs) and in-depth interviews. Results: The drowning rate of Bangladeshi rural children aged 1 - 4 years was found to be 156. 4 per 100, 000 (95 % CI 138. 5 - 176. 6 per 100, 000). The proportional mortality due to drowning in the children was about 28. 0 percent. Natural water bodies were the most frequent places of drowning, and over 40 percent occurred in ponds. The child's sex, mother's age and literacy, family income and ownership of agricultural land by the families were identified as risk factors (Paper I). Community people wrongly perceive that children 5 - 10 years are at the greatest risk of drowning. Participants of the FGDs, parents, adolescents and community leaders, knew the common causes of drowning and were able to mention a few preventive measures. However, they do not act on this knowledge (Paper II). Increased supervision of children through the creation of drowning-safe homes and the establishment of community crèches, raising water safety awareness, and educating the community on first response skills were the three core aspects identified through workshops to include in the intervention package. Qualitative study revealed that these measures are accepted by the community, feasible and sustainable (Paper III). After three years of implementation of the intervention package the evaluation showed that 36 percent of households became drowning safe and through 100 community crèches 2, 680 children aged 1 - 4 years were kept safe under direct supervision. Nearly all the population of the intervention area were reached through various behaviour change communication materials. In the intervention area <b>fatal</b> <b>drowning</b> rate declined from 120. 8 to 53. 7 per 100, 000; however, in the comparison area the rate remained the same in the base-line and the end-line data (Paper IV). Conclusion: Drowning is one of the major survival issues among children aged 1 - 4 years in rural Bangladesh. The intervention model developed through these research activities was found to be effective in reducing child drowning. Improved supervision, creating a heightened water safety culture of the community and utilizing low cost locally available resources are the fundamental intervention strategies identified in reducing child drowning in rural Bangladesh. This model is developed in such a way that it could be applicable in similar low-income settings...|$|E
