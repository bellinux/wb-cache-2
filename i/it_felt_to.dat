He acted in Renoir's 1936 film Partie de campagne and in the 1939 La Règle du jeu, for which he played a butler and served as second assistant. Renoir made Cartier-Bresson act so he could understand how <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>to</b> {{be on the other}} side of the camera. Cartier-Bresson also helped Renoir make a film for the Communist party on the 200 families, including his own, who ran France. During the Spanish civil war, Cartier-Bresson co-directed an anti-fascist film with Herbert Kline, to promote the Republican medical services.|$|E

Todd blackmails Dussander by threatening to turn him in to the police.

Reviewers recommended the game, in particular, for short bursts of {{play with the}} portable Nintendo Switch.

Nintendo Life said HD Rumble made the Switch's portable mode [...] "the definitive way to play" [...] TumbleSeed. Its haptic sensation approximated how <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>to</b> play the mechanical Ice Cold Beer. Reviewers additionally compared the Ice Cold Beer conceit to the core mechanic of Shrek n' Roll (2007) and portable, plastic maze puzzles.|$|E

500|$|From the beginning, Crane {{wished to}} show how <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>to</b> be in a war by writing [...] "a {{psychological}} portrayal of fear." [...] Conceiving his story {{from the point of}} view of a young private who is at first filled with boyish dreams of the glory of war and then quickly becomes disillusioned by war's reality, Crane borrowed the private's surname, [...] "Fleming", from his sister-in-law's maiden name. [...] He later said that the first paragraphs came to him with [...] "every word in place, every comma, every period fixed." [...] Working mostly nights, he wrote from around midnight until four or five in the morning. [...] Because he could not afford a typewriter, he wrote carefully in ink on legal-sized paper, seldom crossing through or interlining a word. [...] If he did change something, he would rewrite the whole page.|$|E

I just thank God for the opportunity." [...] In July 2011, the overseas Chinese Vivid Magazine named Lin one of its top eight influential Chinese-Americans. In April 2012, Lin was named to Time Magazines 2012 list of the [...] "Top 100 Most Influential People in the World". On June 18, 2012, NBA TV announced that Lin was the first-ever winner of the [...] "Social Breakout Player of the Year" [...] Award. He was also the winner of [...] "The EPIC Award". In July 2012, Lin won the ESPY Award for Breakthrough Athlete of the Year.|$|E

500|$|After {{retiring}} from the NFL, Greene spent one year, 1982, as a color analyst for NFL on CBS before becoming an assistant coach under Steelers' head coach Chuck Noll in 1987. He spent the next 16 years {{as an assistant coach}} with the Pittsburgh Steelers (1987–1991), Miami Dolphins (1991–1995), and Arizona Cardinals (1996–2003). In 2004, he retired from coaching and was named the special assistant for player personnel for the Steelers. In this position, he earned his fifth Super Bowl ring after the Steelers won Super Bowl XL. When asked how <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>to</b> finally win [...] "one for the thumb", he replied, [...] "That's all utter nonsense. It's one for the right hand. It's one for this group, for this team." [...] He earned a sixth ring from Super Bowl XLIII. Greene is one of four people outside the Rooney family to have Super Bowl rings from the first six championship teams. He retired from his position in the Steelers front office in 2013.|$|E
500|$|In {{taking over}} the role, Cortese felt [...] "conflicted over where Ruby is now versus where she's come from" [...] and {{explained}} that her own portrayal of the character was a [...] "total 180 from [...] last season", being calmer and [...] "more fear-driven"; after a discussion with Kripke on the character's mindset, Cortese saw Ruby as being in a [...] "lonely, desperate" [...] situation. She tried to make Ruby seem [...] "as innocent as possible" [...] to make viewers question her true allegiance, and to [...] "bring more of a humanity" [...] to Ruby than Cassidy had. For example, taking from the third season finale in which Dean is sent to Hell, Cortese portrayed the character as having some guilt over his death, even though Ruby was not responsible for it. The actress also acknowledged that Ruby was likely manipulating Sam when she claimed to remember how <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>to</b> be human, but suggested that {{there was also an}} element of truth to her character's words.|$|E

[...] He drew his {{inspiration}} from his experiences as a boy around Kyoto, where he explored nearby fields, woods, and caves, and through the Zelda titles he always tries to impart to players some of the sense of exploration and limitless wonder he felt. [...] "When I was a child," [...] he said, [...] "I went hiking and found a lake. It was quite a surprise for me to stumble upon it. When I traveled around the country without a map, trying to find my way, stumbling on amazing things as I went, I realized how <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>to</b> go on an adventure like this."

She entered him in the late September Awesome Again Stakes, where he earned his first Grade I win and free entry fees for the Breeders' Cup Classic. At the Classic in early November, going off as the second favorite, the horse won by a nose. [...] With the win, Ritvo became the first woman trainer to win the Breeders' Cup Classic, and was also only the fifth woman trainer to win any Breeders' Cup race. [...] Ritvo's fellow trainers in the race included Americans D. Wayne Lukas, Todd Pletcher, Bill Mott, and Bob Baffert, as well as Irish trainer Aidan O'Brien. In response to a reporter's question about how <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>to</b> beat several major trainers, she said, [...] "It feels great," [...] but also credited the team behind the horse, and added, [...] "I’m just blessed to be here.” ...|$|E
500|$|Actor Henry Ian Cusick {{and actress}} Georgina Haig guest {{starred in the}} episode {{as a pair of}} Federal agents. Cusick had worked with co-creator J.J. Abrams and {{executive}} producer Pinkner on the ABC series, Lost. Cusick stated that most of his scenes were filmed with Haig and John Noble (Walter Bishop), and that the story leaves a possibility for the return of their characters in the future. Noble found it unusual to film an episode that did not involve the lead actors. He explained, [...] "That was Walter with two really big, important guest stars, Henry Ian Cusick and Georgina Haig. <b>It</b> <b>felt,</b> <b>to</b> me, like it was a really strong episode. The two guest actors did a fantastic job, which is not easy to do, to step into an established company. It is out of the box and is somewhere else completely. I think that the fans will love it. Some fans of this type of material will like it anyway because Henry Ian Cusick was such a big star in Lost, but also, this new girl is just full of wonderful energy, too." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{isolation}} {{from the rest of}} the episode, many critics were baffled by the drastic changes to the Dorne storyline. [...] For io9, Charlie Jane Anders called it [...] "the absolute worst" [...] part of the episode, and criticized the Dorne storyline in general for giving Doran Martell [...] "a grand total of ten minutes' screentime" [...] before suddenly killing him off, given that he is alive in the novels and his major subplot from the books - that he was simply feigning a desire for peace while planning to betray the Lannisters - was not introduced at all before his departure. Alan Sepinwall from HitFix also disliked the Dorne scenes and summarized, [...] "I'll settle for not needing to audibly groan every time the story returns to Dorne, frankly." [...] For Vulture, Nate Jones wrote an op-ed piece specifically criticizing the Dorne storyline in seasons five and six, culminating in the changes in the season six premiere, which <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>to</b> be bizarre and illogical - purely relying on shock value when the characters' actions don't make sense upon closer analysis. [...] Jones was also critical of how it was altering the female characters in Dorne, saying that they were changed from the novels to be [...] "the kind of violent, scantily clad women that emerge when creators want to pay lip service to feminism, but don't have the time or inclination to create actual three-dimensional female characters." ...|$|E

500|$|The Final Fantasy VI poem {{follows the}} journey of Terra Branford, [...] "the heroine born with the gift of magic". The poem explores the stages of her life through the game, as she escapes from slavery, faces her amnesia, discovers the source of her powers, and saves {{the world from the}} insane Kefka Palazzo. Final Fantasy VI was the first Final Fantasy game that Wanamo had played, and he wanted {{to tell the story of}} the game as <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>to</b> him. Wanamo has {{described}} the arrangement as the most difficult one he had done to date. Originally, the poem was going to follow the story of the group of heroes, before Wanamo made Terra the focus, and ended up dropping the themes of the other heroes due to length. The Final Fantasy X piano concerto was arranged by Hamauzu not to tell the story of the game, but to express the [...] "continuum" [...] of the series through the lens of the game. While inspired by the game's story, Hamauzu also drew inspiration from the rest of the franchise to make the concerto more than [...] "a series of separate scenes and stories". He feels that a hallmark of Böcker's concerts is that they are not limited to directly translating the original works, but instead tie them to a wider creative process. Valtonen created the three movements of the Final Fantasy VII symphony to show three aspects of the game's setting. The first movement, [...] "Nibelheim Incident", follows the villain Sephiroth in his journey through the game; the second, [...] "Words Drowned by Fireworks", explores the relationship between Cloud Strife, Aerith Gainsborough, and Tifa Lockhart; while the third movement, [...] "The Planet's Crisis", depicts the final clash between Cloud and Sephiroth. He tried to [...] "bring out both the darkest moments as well as the heart" [...] of the game.|$|E
