5|$|In {{the past}} century {{agriculture}} has been characterized by increased productivity, the substitution of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides for labor, water pollution, and <b>farm</b> <b>subsidies.</b> Other applications of scientific research since 1950 in agriculture include gene manipulation, hydroponics, {{and the development of}} economically viable biofuels such as ethanol.|$|E
5|$|He was {{the only}} Republican senator {{to vote against the}} Freedom to Farm Act in 1996, saying that it catered to special {{interests}} rather than representing true reform of <b>farm</b> <b>subsidies</b> policy. He was one of only five senators to vote against the Telecommunications Act of 1996, {{on the grounds that it}} put the economic interests of corporations ahead of those of consumers.|$|E
5|$|Since 1900, {{agriculture}} in the developed nations, {{and to a lesser}} extent in the developing world, has seen large rises in productivity as human labour has been replaced by mechanization, and assisted by synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and selective breeding. The Haber-Bosch process allowed the synthesis of ammonium nitrate fertilizer on an industrial scale, greatly increasing crop yields. Modern agriculture has raised social, political, and environmental issues including water pollution, biofuels, genetically modified organisms, tariffs and <b>farm</b> <b>subsidies.</b> In response, organic farming developed in the twentieth century as an alternative to the use of synthetic pesticides.|$|E
25|$|A Freedom of Information request in 2005 {{revealed}} that Eton had received £2,652 in <b>farming</b> <b>subsidies</b> in 2004 under the Common Agricultural Policy. Asked to explain under what grounds it was eligible to receive <b>farming</b> <b>subsidies,</b> Eton admitted {{that it was}} 'a bit of a mystery'. Panorama revealed in March 2012 that <b>farming</b> <b>subsidies</b> were granted to Eton for 'environmental improvements', in effect 'being paid without having to do any farming at all'.|$|R

5|$|Domestic sheep {{provide a}} wide array of raw materials. Wool {{was one of the first}} textiles, {{although}} in the late 20th century wool prices began to fall dramatically as the result of the popularity and cheap prices for synthetic fabrics. For many sheep owners, the cost of shearing is greater than the possible profit from the fleece, making subsisting on wool production alone practically impossible without <b>farm</b> <b>subsidies.</b> Fleeces are used as material in making alternative products such as wool insulation. In the 21st century, the sale of meat is the most profitable enterprise in the sheep industry, even though far less sheep meat is consumed than chicken, pork or beef.|$|E
5|$|By early April, pro-Heiner ads from Citizens for a Sound Government revived {{charges of}} taking bailouts and tax {{delinquency}} against Bevin and attacked Comer for accepting {{thousands of dollars}} in <b>farm</b> <b>subsidies.</b> Within days, the candidates appeared at a debate where Bevin challenged Heiner to publicly denounce the ads; Heiner responded with a silent smile. Bevin's public challenge to the ad prompted a Lexington television station to pull it after two weeks on the air. Bevin made a $200,000 combined television and radio ad buy to defend himself against the ads and began a telephone survey that touted his conservative credentials while highlighting Heiner's past positions on issues such as gun control before asking how these statements affect the person's view of each candidate. Heiner said the survey was a negative push poll, but Bevin insisted it was a legitimate poll. By the end of April, polls showed that Heiner's lead had evaporated and that the race was essentially a three-way dead heat between him, Bevin, and Comer.|$|E

25|$|After the war, however, Iowa farmers soon saw wartime <b>farm</b> <b>subsidies</b> eliminated. Beginning in 1920, {{many farmers}} had {{difficulty}} making the payment for debts they had incurred during the war. The 1920s were {{a time of}} hardship for Iowa's farm families and for many families, these hardships carried over into the 1930s.|$|E

Alum Davies believed this caused a conflict of interest, however the Minister’s actions led directly to his sacking by First Minister Carwyn Jones and Alun Davies subsequently issued a personal apology to all AMs involved regarding EU <b>farming</b> <b>subsidies</b> received by their respective family businesses.|$|R

25|$|Rooted {{in congressional}} logrolling, {{the act was}} part of a larger {{appropriation}} that raised price supports for cotton and wheat. Rural lawmakers supported the program so that their urban colleagues would not dismantle <b>farm</b> <b>subsidies.</b> Food stamps, along with Medicaid, Head Start, and the Job Corps were foremost among the growing anti-poverty programs.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} legislation for wheat {{production in the}} United States today are the farm bills which authorized <b>farm</b> <b>subsidies,</b> the Conservation Reserve Program, and other programs.

25|$|As the Depression wore on, Franklin D. Roosevelt tried public works, <b>farm</b> <b>subsidies,</b> {{and other}} devices to restart the U.S. economy, but never {{completely}} {{gave up trying to}} balance the budget.

40|$|A "hybrid" spatial price {{equilibrium}} {{model is}} developed to evaluate changes in production, consumption, and trade of feed and malting barley under alternative domestic and agricultural trade policy regimes. The analysis includes the economic welfare impacts {{of changes in}} various <b>farm</b> <b>subsidy</b> programs on the United States, Canada, Australia, and European Union (EU- 15) which are the four major barley exporting countries in the world. The actions of competitive U. S. grain traders under the Export Enhancement Program cause feed barley exports to be segmented into two distinct markets. A spatial equilibrium is established in which the Canadian Wheat Board and Australian marketing boards behave as oligopolists in export markets under arbitrage conditions induced by U. S. and EU- 15 grain traders. Malting, Feed, <b>Farm</b> <b>Subsidy,</b> Trade Policy, Export Market, Welfare, International Relations/Trade,...|$|R
25|$|After the FTA was signed, {{there were}} {{initially}} {{concerns that the}} American agricultural sector would lobby against the agreement, due to a fear that it could interfere with the government's <b>farm</b> <b>subsidies</b> program. However, the agreement, with time limits on importation of Australian agricultural products such as beef and sugar cane managed to allay {{the concerns of the}} American agricultural market (while greatly frustrating many Australian producers).|$|E
25|$|Less radical {{theories}} {{suggest that}} economic protectionism {{in developed countries}} hampers Africa's growth. When developing countries have harvested agricultural produce at low cost, they generally do not export as much as would be expected. Abundant <b>farm</b> <b>subsidies</b> and high import tariffs in the developed world, most notably those set by Japan, the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy, and the United States Department of Agriculture, {{are thought to be}} the cause. Although these subsidies and tariffs have been gradually reduced, they remain high.|$|E
25|$|In theory, Iranian {{agricultural}} policy {{is intended to}} support farmers and encourage the production of strategically important crops. The policy is twofold: first, to purchase certain crops at guaranteed prices and second, to encourage the production of specific crops through <b>farm</b> <b>subsidies.</b> The policy of purchasing agricultural crops from farmers at guaranteed prices {{was put in place}} in the 1989 crop year. On average, the guaranteed prices increased at the rate of inflation over the past 15 years. Individual subsidy levels for major crops, however, vary annually.|$|E

25|$|From 1947 to 1949, {{when the}} Republicans {{controlled}} the Senate, Taft was his party's leading voice in domestic policy. He {{was reluctant to}} support <b>farm</b> <b>subsidies,</b> a position that hurt the party in rural areas (especially in the Midwest) in the 1948 elections. Taft engineered {{the passage of the}} Housing Act of 1949, which funded slum clearance and the construction of 810,000 units of low-income housing over a period of six years. It {{was one of the few}} Fair Deal proposals of Truman that he liked.|$|E
25|$|During {{his first}} term in the Senate, Taft criticized what he {{believed}} was the inefficiency and waste of many New Deal programs and {{of the need to}} let private enterprise and businesses restore the nation's economy instead of relying upon government programs to end the Great Depression. He condemned the New Deal as socialist and attacked deficit spending, high <b>farm</b> <b>subsidies,</b> governmental bureaucracy, the National Labor Relations Board, and nationalized health insurance. However, he did not always follow conservative ideology; for instance, after investigating the lack of adequate housing in the nation, he supported public housing programs. He also supported federal aid to the states to fund public schools.|$|E
