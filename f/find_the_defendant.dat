25|$|List of U.S. {{states by}} Alford plea usage {{documents}} {{usage of the}} form of guilty plea known as the Alford plea {{in each of the}} U.S. states in the United States. An Alford plea (also referred to as Alford guilty plea and Alford doctrine) in the law of the United States is a guilty plea in criminal court, where the defendant does not admit the act and asserts innocence. Under the Alford plea the defendant admits that sufficient evidence exists with which the prosecution could likely convince a judge or jury to <b>find</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.|$|E
25|$|If a {{defendant}} is {{sentenced to death}} at the trial level, the case then goes into a direct review. The direct review process is a typical legal appeal. An appellate court examines the record of evidence presented in the trial court and the law that the lower court applied and decides whether the decision was legally sound or not. Direct review of a capital sentencing hearing will result {{in one of three}} outcomes. If the appellate court finds that no significant legal errors occurred in the capital sentencing hearing, the appellate court will affirm the judgment, or let the sentence stand. If the appellate court finds that significant legal errors did occur, then it will reverse the judgment, or nullify the sentence and order a new capital sentencing hearing. Lastly, if the appellate court finds that no reasonable juror could <b>find</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> eligible for the death penalty, a rarity, then it will order the defendant acquitted, or not guilty, of the crime for which he/she was given the death penalty, and order him sentenced to the next most severe punishment for which the offense is eligible. About 60 percent survive the process of direct review intact.|$|E
500|$|The Chief Justice also {{suggested}} that the rationale in the Reynolds case might be given effect by continuing to <b>find</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> liable for defamation but {{reducing the amount of}} damages payable depending on how much care he or she took to ensure the accuracy of the information published. He noted: [...] "There is no reason why a defendant who has published a defamatory statement should be allowed to get off scot-free for injuring the plaintiff's reputation simply because he has satisfied the 'responsible journalism' test." ...|$|E

2500|$|William Brennan {{made the}} {{argument}} {{once again for}} the [...] "objective" [...] entrapment standard from previous concurrences and dissents, and said that this would necessitate overturning the conviction. He {{also said that he}} did not <b>find</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> predisposed to commit the crime either. [...] "(T)he Government's role in the criminal activity involved in this case was more pervasive than the Government involvement in Russell ... In my view, the police activity in this case was beyond permissible limits." ...|$|E
2500|$|Defense {{attorney}} Cheney Mason {{then followed}} {{with an additional}} closing argument. Addressing the jury to discuss the charges against Casey Anthony. [...] "The burden rests {{on the shoulders of}} my colleagues at the state attorney's office", Mason said, referring to proving that Casey Anthony committed a crime. Mason said that the jurors are required, whether they like it or not, to <b>find</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> not guilty if the state did not adequately prove its case against Casey Anthony. Mason emphasized that the burden of proof is on the state, and that Casey Anthony's decision not to testify is not an implication of guilt.|$|E
2500|$|Goetz {{was tried}} before a Manhattan jury of 10 whites and 2 blacks, of whom 6 had {{been victims of}} street crime. He was acquitted of the {{attempted}} murder and first-degree assault charges and convicted of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree – carrying a loaded, unlicensed weapon in a public place. He was sentenced to six months in jail, one year's psychiatric treatment, five years' probation, 200 hours community service, and a $5,000 fine. An appellate court affirmed the conviction and changed the sentence to one year in jail without probation. The order of the appellate court was affirmed because the trial court had not erred in instructing the jury that, if it found the People had proved each {{of the elements of}} the crime beyond a reasonable doubt, it [...] "must" [...] <b>find</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> guilty. This was not a directed verdict. Goetz served eight months.|$|E

50|$|A {{person who}} uses force within the {{parameters}} of the law is immune from criminal prosecution or civil action and cannot be arrested unless a law enforcement agency determines there is probable cause that the force used was unlawful. If a civil action is brought and <b>the</b> court <b>finds</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> to be immune under <b>the</b> law, <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> will be awarded all costs of defense.|$|R
2500|$|When Kumamoto {{came out}} in support of Hakamada in 2007, it shocked the Japanese public, casting light on the usually secretive justice system. Hakamada's case caused people to {{question}} {{the validity of the}} death penalty and brought attention to what critics describe as [...] "inhumane" [...] elements of the Japanese justice system. In Japan, the police may interrogate a suspect for up to 23 days, and the suspect is not permitted to have a lawyer present during interrogation. Because a false confession could be obtained easily under such harsh conditions, and because it was legal before WWII for police to torture suspects in order to obtain a confession, Japanese criminal courts will admit a confession as evidence only when a secret known by the perpetrator of the crime is contained therein. Moreover, Japanese courts do not permit guilty pleas; and so, even if the accused declares guilt, the courts may <b>find</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> innocent if the confession of guilt is determined to be inadequate.|$|E
2500|$|Explanations other than, or emphasizing, the prosecution's lack of {{forensic}} evidence were {{given for the}} jury's decision. A number of media commentators reasoned that the prosecution overcharged the case by tagging on the death penalty, concluding that people in good conscience could not sentence Anthony to death based on the circumstantial evidence presented. The CSI effect was also extensively argued—that society now lives [...] "in a 'CSI age' where everyone expects fingerprints and DNA, and we are sending a message that old-fashioned circumstantial evidence is not sufficient". Likewise, commentators such as O. J. Simpson case prosecutor Marcia Clark believe that the jury interpreted [...] "reasonable doubt" [...] too narrowly. Clark said instruction on reasonable doubt is [...] "the hardest, most elusive" [...] instruction of all. [...] "And I think it's where even the most fair-minded jurors can get derailed", she said, opining the confusion between reasonable doubt and a reason to doubt. [...] "In Scotland, they have three verdicts: guilty, not guilty, and not proven. It's one way of showing {{that even if the}} jury didn't believe the evidence amounted to proof beyond a reasonable doubt, it didn't <b>find</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> innocent either. There's a difference." ...|$|E
50|$|Oregon is {{the only}} state where someone can be convicted of a capital crime without a {{unanimous}} verdict from the jury: 11 jurors are enough to <b>find</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> guilty, unless the prosecution requests a unanimous verdict.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{considerable}} {{pressure on}} <b>the</b> jury to <b>find</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> guilty, with Judge Advocate of the Admiralty Sir Dr Thomas Newton reminding {{the jury that}} the consequences of an acquittal would be [...] "the total loss of the Indian trade, and thereby the impoverishment of this kingdom," [...] the jury passed a verdict of not guilty.|$|R
25|$|The defense {{called the}} only {{witnesses}} {{they had had}} time to <b>find</b> - <b>the</b> <b>defendants.</b> No new evidence was revealed.|$|R
50|$|The jury took 10 {{minutes to}} <b>find</b> all <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> not guilty and award them their legal costs. It {{was not a}} popular decision. The crowd hissed and booed the jurors, and tried to attack <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> {{as they left the}} courtroom.|$|R
5000|$|The {{case went}} to the jury on Friday 8 March 1895 at 11:30 AM. At 2:15 PM, the jury {{returned}} with the verdict, [...] "We, the jury, <b>find</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant,</b> Harry T. Hayward, guilty {{of murder in the}} first degree." ...|$|E
50|$|In {{criminal}} jury trials, {{the court}} is permitted (but not required) to instruct jurors that they can <b>find</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> guilty {{of the most serious}} crime charged, or of a lesser included offense of that crime (in English law, this is termed an alternative verdict).|$|E
50|$|For petty misdemeanors {{like most}} traffic violations, {{suspected}} offenders may either plea nolo contendere {{and pay a}} set fine amount (amende forfaitaire) or contest the charge in court. The court may then <b>find</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> innocent or guilty, but if found guilty, they are liable to be sentenced a higher fine.|$|E
50|$|In {{his first}} {{case with the}} Special Victims Unit, he prosecutes a rape similar to a best selling erotic novel Twenty-Five Acts by Jocelyn Paley (Anna Chlumsky), who is the rape victim. Barba tells the detectives to uncover {{anything}} and everything about Paley and her attacker. After rushing to put Paley on the stand to testify, Barba and the detectives discover that Paley did not write the book, which forces Barba to get creative with the trial. Barba taunts <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> with a belt tied around his neck, resulting in him lashing out and choking Barba from behind {{the way he did}} to the victims. After this, <b>the</b> jury <b>finds</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> guilty.|$|R
50|$|On 9 December 1987, the {{appellant}} {{attacked and}} shot {{a man in}} a fish and chip shop, following an argument. The victim was admitted to hospital and underwent surgery, though he developed a respiratory problem requiring a tracheostomy tube to be inserted into his windpipe. On 8 February 1988, and again on 14 February, the victim complained that he was having difficulty breathing, dying shortly after. Medical evidence at <b>the</b> <b>defendant's</b> trial was given that the victim's death was the result of his doctor's failure to diagnose the reason behind his breathlessness and respiratory obstruction. Nevertheless, <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> was convicted, with the trial Judge instructing the jury they could <b>find</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant's</b> chain of causation could only be broken if they were satisfied that the medical staff had been reckless in their treatment.|$|R
5000|$|Dougherty {{then brought}} suit against Stepp for {{trespass}} quare clausum fregit. [...] A trial {{was held in}} Buncombe before Judge Martin. Judge Martin held that since Stepp, <b>the</b> <b>defendant,</b> had not damaged Dougherty's land in any way, Stepp had not committed a trespass. [...] He therefore directed <b>the</b> jury to <b>find</b> for <b>the</b> <b>defendant.</b>|$|R

5000|$|In {{criminal}} cases, jury nullification arguments sometimes {{focus on}} the precise language of the jury instruction on the burden of proof. Many jury instructions {{on the issue of}} the burden of proof invite nullification arguments. According to these instructions juries must <b>find</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> not guilty if the case has not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Conversely the jury should <b>find</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> guilty if the case has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. [...] The permissive language [...] "should" [...] arguably allows juries to consider nullification arguments. It is also possible to receive a specific jury instruction on nullification, though most judges simply avoid the topic and do not tell jurors of their power to judge the fairness of the law and how it is applied as well as to judge the facts of a case.|$|E
50|$|The {{plaintiff}} {{brought a}} wrongful death action {{alleging that the}} defendant doctor negligently failed to diagnose the decedent's esophageal cancer. The trial court instructed the jury to <b>find</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> liable if the failure to diagnose was deemed a substantial factor in the decedent's death. The jury found for the plaintiff and the defendant appealed.|$|E
5000|$|After the {{statements}} had been read out in court Bromley ordered <b>the</b> jury to <b>find</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> not guilty, stating that: God hath delivered you beyond expectation, I pray God you may use this mercie and favour well; and take heed you fall not hereafter: And so the court doth order that you shall be delivered. Potts concludes {{his account of}} the trial with the words: [...] "Thus were these poore Innocent creatures, by the great care and paines of this honourable Judge, delivered from the danger of this Conspiracie; this bloudie practise of the Priest laid open".|$|R
25|$|On December 18, 2006, U.S. {{regulators}} filed 101 civil {{charges against}} chief executive Franklin Raines; {{chief financial officer}} J. Timothy Howard; and the former controller Leanne G. Spencer. The three were accused of manipulating Fannie Mae earnings to maximize their bonuses. The lawsuit sought to recoup more than $115 million in bonus payments, collectively accrued by the trio from 1998 to 2004, and about $100 million in penalties for their involvement in the accounting scandal. After 8 years of litigation, in 2012, a summary judgment was issued clearing the trio, indicating the government had insufficient evidence that would enable any jury to <b>find</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> guilty.|$|R
25|$|File sharing {{researcher}} Daniel Johansson {{called the}} ruling {{the most important}} file sharing related verdict in Europe so far, comparing it to the Napster verdict in the US. The sentence is the longest ever awarded under Swedish copyright law, and the prison time and damage compensation high by Swedish standards. While most legal experts expected <b>the</b> court to <b>find</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> guilty, they were surprised at the harsh verdict. Sociology of law professor Håkan Hyden criticised the exceptionally harsh sentence on both the prison time and large amount of compensation awarded, and some legal analysts expect the punishments to be radically lowered in higher courts.|$|R
50|$|The trial {{took place}} in Guildhall (now demolished) in Guildhall Street. The {{presiding}} judges were the new mayor Thomas Bele, Sir Christopher Hales and probably Baron John Hales. It was a very short trial. A jury confronted with an indictment for High Treason had {{no alternative but to}} <b>find</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> guilty. The sentence was handed down on 6 December. John Stone was taken to Westgate tower to await his execution.|$|E
5000|$|As {{the number}} of Rule B {{attachment}} claims increased, the Second Circuit narrowed the rule in several ways, such as holding that the Court has discretion to vacate the order of attachment if there is another convenient, available forum where the plaintiff may <b>find</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendant</b> or that a foreign corporation may be [...] "found" [...] within the Southern District simply by registering with the State of New York.|$|E
50|$|An Alford plea (also {{called a}} Kennedy plea in West Virginia, anAlford guilty plea, and the Alford doctrine) in United States {{law is a}} guilty plea in {{criminal}} court, whereby a defendant {{in a criminal case}} does not admit to the criminal act and asserts innocence.

50|$|The {{three were}} tried on Niue by a rapidly {{constituted}} court and {{a panel of}} 2 European and 4 native assessors (this was not a jury, because it had no power to seek clemency) chosen by the local administration. The case was heard before Auckland magistrate Leonard George Herston Sinclair, made a judge of the Niue High Court for the occasion, and the government-appointed defence lawyer was Auckland lawyer Erl Travice Pleasants. The assessors took {{less than an hour}} to <b>find</b> <b>the</b> <b>defendants</b> guilty of murder, and they were sentenced to hang by Sinclair, whose normal powers in New Zealand were limited to maximum sentences of 3 years’ jail.|$|R
