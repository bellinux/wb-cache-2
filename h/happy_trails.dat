25|$|Quicksilver Messenger Service {{released}} their eponymous {{debut album}} in 1968. It {{was followed by}} <b>Happy</b> <b>Trails,</b> released in early 1969 and largely recorded live at the Fillmore East and the Fillmore West. Like most live albums of the time, <b>Happy</b> <b>Trails</b> made extensive use of studio overdubs, and the last two songs were recorded entirely in the studio, but it has nonetheless been called the most accurate reproduction of the band's acclaimed live performances. <b>Happy</b> <b>Trails</b> was awarded a gold album in the United States.|$|E
500|$|At over twenty-five minutes, {{the song}} was too long for {{commercial}} radio airplay. [...] Capitol Records prepared an edited 3:35 version for release as a single. [...] It became Quicksilver's first appearance on Billboard's Hot 100 singles chart, where it reached number 91 in 1969. [...] The <b>Happy</b> <b>Trails</b> record album, with the song taking up the entire first side, became a best seller at number 27 in the album chart, also in 1969. Rolling Stone included the album at number 189 on its list of the [...] "500 Greatest Albums of all Time" ...|$|E
5000|$|The trail {{begins at}} the <b>Happy</b> Isles <b>trail</b> head in Yosemite Valley and travels {{generally}} east-southeast. This {{is one of the}} shortest (1.3 mi)—though in places steep—and most popular trails in Yosemite. The trail is mostly shaded and is progressive in incline until it reaches the base of the waterfall where mist sprays onto the hikers.|$|R
2500|$|Loos {{would become}} a virtual New York institution, an assiduous partygoer and diner-out, {{conspicuous}} at fashion shows, theatrical and movie events, balls and galas. A celebrity anecdotalist, she was also never one to let facts spoil a good story: With each book came a new spate of interviews and {{as one of the}} last survivors of the silent era, Anita's stories became more exaggerated and she was soon reported to have sold her first scenario at the age of 12. She continued to thrive on interesting people and interesting activities – and held an opinion on everything – but worked hard on keeping the vivacious and flippant image and hiding her loneliness. She once commented, [...] "I've enjoyed my <b>happiest</b> moments when <b>trailing</b> a Mainbocher evening gown across the sawdust-covered floor of a saloon." ...|$|R
5000|$|In November 2002, while imprisoned at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles {{awaiting}} trial, Rubin's {{throat was}} cut {{and then he}} tumbled off an 18- to 20-foot balcony. He had been threatening suicide in the days before. The injuries from the fall resulted in his death at Los Angeles County General Hospital several days later. [...] Some people consider the circumstances surrounding his death to be suspicious, and Rubin's wife demanded an investigation. But defense attorney Mark Werksman said that Rubin had been despondent for months, losing 40 pounds, and that the pressure of an upcoming trial [...] "may have pushed him over the top." [...] The Rubin family launched a wrongful death suit against the government. The Cameras on {{that day in the}} Jail, were not on or shared for investigation , His Family and Friends said ,Irv was <b>happy</b> about upcoming <b>trail</b> and looked forward to see them [...]|$|R
500|$|The Cannons' {{final game}} was played on September 2, 2002, against the Edmonton Trappers. [...] It ended in a wild 14–13 victory over Calgary's provincial rival before a sellout crowd of 8,512. [...] The Cannons scored four runs {{in the bottom of}} the ninth inning to win the game, with the winning run scored on a strikeout/wild pitch. The team left the field to the song <b>Happy</b> <b>Trails</b> while the cannon in right field that had been fired every time a Calgary player hit a home run fired off a 21-gun salute.|$|E
500|$|However, by mid-1968 [...] "Who Do You Love" [...] {{took on a}} {{different}} arrangement. [...] Unterberger calls it a [...] "template upon which to hang long instrumental guitar improvisations, [...] the tempo and the melody of the original tune all but disappearing". [...] A 25-minute live adaptation was included on Quicksilver's second album, <b>Happy</b> <b>Trails,</b> that was edited from 1968 recordings at the Fillmore East and/or Fillmore West. [...] The group performs it as a six-part suite that [...] "weave into and {{back out of the}} main theme", with sections allow for instrumental exploration by the individual band members.|$|E
2500|$|These albums, {{which have}} been hailed as [...] "...two of the best {{examples}} of the San Francisco sound at its purest," [...] emphasize extended arrangements and fluid twin-guitar improvisation. Cipollina's highly melodic, individualistic lead guitar style, combined with Gary Duncan's driving minor scale, jazzy guitar playing, resulted in a clear, notable contrast to the heavily amplified and overdriven sound of contemporaries like Cream and Jimi Hendrix. In 2003 <b>Happy</b> <b>Trails</b> was rated at No.189 in the Rolling Stone Top 500 albums survey, where it was described as [...] "...the definitive live recording of the mid-Sixties San Francisco psychedelic-ballroom experience..." [...] Archetypal Quicksilver Messenger Service songs include the elongated rendition of Bo Diddley's [...] "Who Do You Love?" [...] on <b>Happy</b> <b>Trails.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{educational}} trail Dobrošov fort {{is situated}} {{in the village of}} the same name. It is an advance specified marked route which leads in the footsteps of the border fortification from 1935 - 1938. The length of the route is approximately 4 km and visitors are mainly informed about historically interesting places in the surrounding and about the events before World War II. Historical affairs are presented in the form of information panels at individual stops. The panels tell visitors not only about historical military facts of 20 th century but also about the building of the fortress fortification Dobrošov. The educational trail has eight official stops. On the route, visitors can see additional panels with the description of the light fortification and they learn interesting things about the surrounding. The content of this thesis is a brief characteristic of events in Czechoslovakia before World War II. There is a description of the fortification system of a fort at that time in Europe and Czechoslovakia. Furthermore, this thesis deals with educational trails in general from the viewpoint of their functionality and equipment. This study points out legislation and illustrates new trends of this form of tourism. The aim of this thesis was to document the educational trail Dobrošov fort, with the focus on historical events of fortification building in Czechoslovakia before World War II. The analysis of the trail and information panels was conducted. A questionnaire survey found out the needs of visitors and highlights the usefulness of this trail. The questionnaire survey had another important role for findings of stated hypotheses. Four scientific hypotheses were formulated. The first one is if the access to more objects increases, its attractiveness and attendance will also increase. The second hypothesis is whether the visitors are satisfied with the infrastructure of the educational trail. Furthermore, the awareness of the educational trail helps to its high attendance, and both citizens and tourists will be happy about a fortification extension which also includes the preservation of decaying objects in the surrounding. The used methods for achieving these aims were the observation and questionnaire survey in the location of the educational trail. The conclusion shows that the access to more objects will increase the attractiveness and attendance of the trail. However, the visitors are not satisfied with the infrastructure of the trail. The awareness of the educational trail contributes to the high attendance. The hypothesis that local citizens and tourists will be <b>happy</b> about the <b>trail</b> extension which includes the preservation of decaying objects in the surrounding was disproved...|$|R
