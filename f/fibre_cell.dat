The detergent was clearly detected at the transverse {{sections of the}} pulp <b>fibre</b> <b>cell</b> walls. The detergent was also detected at the lumen region of the pulp fibres. Hence, the pulp decolouring mechanism occurring with the detergent addition can be proposed as follows: the detergent permeates into the pulp <b>fibre</b> <b>cell</b> wall and promotes the solution-exchange between the inside and the outside parts of the <b>fibre</b> <b>cell</b> wall, finally washing away the chromophoric substances such as lignin and its degradation products owing to the enhanced dewatering efficiency.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the kraft pulp decolouring mechanism on using a nonionic detergent, the pulp washing process and the resulting pulp handsheets were investigated by examining the brightness, kappa number, thioacidolysis product yield, and dewatering efficiency in the pressing sheet making process. The pulp decolouring could be attributed to a decrease in the lignin content and an improvement in the dewatering efficiency. Furthermore, the detergent distribution in the aqueous pulp suspension obtained during the pulp washing process was visualised using cryo-time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry/scanning electron microscopy (cryo-TOF-SIMS/SEM). The detergent was clearly observed at the transverse surface of the pulp <b>fibre</b> <b>cell</b> wall and was also detected in the lumen of the fibres, suggesting the permeation of the detergent into the pulp <b>fibre</b> <b>cell</b> wall.

Mature <b>fibre</b> <b>cells</b> contain a very high protein concentration, which {{is important for the}} transparency and refractive power of the lens. These proteins are protected from oxidation by reducing substances, like glutathione, and by the low-oxygen environment around the lens. Glutathione reaches the mature <b>fibre</b> <b>cells</b> by diffusing from the metabolically active cells at the lens surface. With age, the cytoplasm of the nucleus becomes stiffer, reducing the rate of diffusion and making nuclear proteins more susceptible to oxidation. Low pO 2 is maintained at the posterior surface of the lens by the physical and physiological properties of the vitreous body, the gel filling the space between the lens and the retina. Destruction or degeneration of the vitreous body increases exposure of the lens to oxygen from the retina. Oxygen reaches the lens nucleus, increasing protein oxidation and aggregation and leading to nuclear cataract. We suggest that maintaining low pO 2 around the lens should prevent the formation of nuclear cataracts...|$|R

Judged by immunoblotting, greater amounts of Na,K-ATPase alpha 1 and beta 1 polypeptides were found in <b>fibre</b> <b>cell</b> membrane material than in epithelial cell membrane material. However, the NA,K-ATPase activity in epithelial cell membrane material was 20 times that measured in <b>fibre</b> <b>cell</b> membrane material. In 86 Rb uptake experiments with intact lenses, ouabain-inhibitable 86 Rb uptake was observed for lens epithelium but not for lens fibres. These findings are consistent with a low Na,K-ATPase activity in lens fibre cells even though these cells express a considerable amount of Na,K-ATPase alpha 1 and beta 1 polypeptides. The lipid composition of lens <b>fibre</b> <b>cell</b> membranes causes them to be more ordered than epithelial cell membranes; this was confirmed by measurements of the infrared CH 2 symmetric stretching band frequency. Because lipid composition can influence Na,K-ATPase activity, experiments were conducted to determine whether the activity of Na,K-ATPase alpha 1 beta 1 is inhibited by lens fibre lipid. However, no significant difference in Na,K-ATPase activity was detected when Na,K-ATPase alpha 1 beta 1 was purified from rabbit kidney and then reconstituted with lipid that had been isolated from either lens epithelium or lens fibre cells. These studies indicate that lens fibre cells contain both Na,K-ATPase alpha 1 and beta 1 polypeptides but have low Na,K-ATPase activity. However, the results do not support the notion that {{this is due to the}} lipid composition of lens <b>fibre</b> <b>cell</b> membranes...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The {{anatomy of}} bamboo culms and the {{multilayered}} structure of <b>fibre</b> <b>cell</b> walls {{are known to}} be the main determinant factors for its physical and mechanical properties. Studies on the bamboo cell wall have focussed mainly on fully elongated and mature fibres. The main aim {{of this study was to}} describe the ultrastructure of primary and secondary cell walls in culm tissues of Dendrocalamus asper at different stages of development. METHODS: The development of fibre and parenchyma tissues was classified into four stages based on light microscopy observations made in tissues from juvenile plants. The stages were used as a basis for transmission electron microscopy study on the ultrastructure of the cell wall during the process of primary and early secondary cell wall formation. Macerations and phloroglucinol-HCl staining were employed to investigate <b>fibre</b> <b>cell</b> elongation and <b>fibre</b> <b>cell</b> wall lignification, respectively. KEY RESULTS: The observations indicated that the primary wall is formed by the deposition of two distinct layers during the elongation of the internode and that secondary wall synthesis may begin before the complete cessation of internode and fibre elongation. Elongation was followed by a maturation phase characterized by the deposition of multiple secondary wall layers, which varied in number according to the cell type, location in the culm tissue and stage of shoot development. Lignification of <b>fibre</b> <b>cell</b> walls started at the period prior to the cessation of internode elongation. CONCLUSIONS: The structure of the primary cell wall was comprised of two layers. The fibre secondary cell wall began to be laid down while the cells were still undergoing some elongation, suggesting that it may act to cause the slow-down and eventual cessation of cell elongation...|$|E

The {{relationship}} between culm anatomy and the rht (reduced height) system of wheat was studied in rhtl (GA-sensitive, tall) and Rhtl (GA-insensitive, semidwarf) spring wheat F isolines.

Counting the number of <b>fibre</b> <b>cell</b> files in the cortex of the first internode at heading time, we found no structural differences between the tall (rhtl) and the semidwarf (Rhtl) isolines. It appears that stem elongation and the determination of cell fate to fibres are regulated by two different mechanisms.

40|$|Different {{electron}} microscopy techniques including SEM (scanning {{electron microscopy}}), FE-SEM (field emission-scanning electron microscopy), TEM (transmission electron microscopy) and Immuno-gold TEM (immuno-gold transmission electron microscopy) were applied {{in order to}} gain a better understanding of the influence of the native softwood <b>fibre</b> <b>cell</b> wall ultrastructure including morphology and topochemistry (i. e. lignin and glucomannan distribution) during mechanical pulping. In thermomechanical pulp (TMP) processing, wood fibres undergo structural changes (cell wall delamination and fibrillation) that are regulated by the native fibre micro- and ultrastructure. In addition, novel information was obtained on the <b>fibre</b> <b>cell</b> wall architecture. In contrast, the stoneground wood (SGW) process inflicted severe damage to the fibre structure resulting in transverse and longitudinal fibre breakage. However, juvenile wood SGW fibres showed improved properties (strength and light scattering) compared to mature wood. Ultrastructural aspects of fibre processing and development explained the differences in physical properties observed. During the SGW process, the native morphological <b>fibre</b> <b>cell</b> wall ultrastructure and microfibrillar organization governed the manner of juvenile wood fibre development similar to TMP fibres. Ultrastructural studies on Norway spruce and Scots pine TMPs revealed fundamental features that governed the different behaviour exhibited by the two wood species. Specific ultrastructural characteristics of pine TMP <b>fibre</b> <b>cell</b> walls were explored in relation to both morphology and topochemistry and that regulating the different pine fibre development mechanisms compared to spruce. The negative behaviour shown by Scots pine during TMP processing was most likely attributable to the observed fibre development mechanism. Histochemical techniques were applied to study wood resin associated problems during mechanical and kraft pulping. Studies provided information on the spatial micro-morphological distribution/redistribution of lipophilic extractives that were visualized on single fibre and cell wall fractions. Results from histochemical staining and chemical analysis performed on Norway spruce and Scots pine TMPs showed that there were morphological and chemical differences in the redistribution of extractives between the two species. This may further contribute to the effects of extractives on pulp- and paper properties and processing. Localization of lipophilic birch wood extractives involved in pitch problems was performed using histochemical techniques. Correlated information from gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and specific staining methods gave details on how extractives are removed during processing as well as information on the mechanisms of removal...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{organisation}} {{of individual}} cells into a functional three-dimensional tissue {{is still a}} major question in developmental biology. Modulation of epithelial cell shape is a critical driving force in forming tissues. This is well illustrated in the eye lens where epithelial cells elongate extensively during their differentiation into fibre cells. It is at the lens equator that epithelial cells elongate along their apical–basal axis. During this process the elongating epithelial cells and their earliest <b>fibre</b> <b>cell</b> derivatives remain anchored at their apical tips, forming a discrete region or modiolus, which we term the lens fulcrum. How this is achieved has received scant attention and is little understood. Here, we show that conditional depletion of aPKCλ, a central effector of the PAR polarity complex, disrupts the apical junctions in elongating epithelial cells so that the lens fulcrum fails to form. This results in disorganised <b>fibre</b> <b>cell</b> alignment that then causes cataract. Interestingly, aPKCλ depletion also promotes epithelial–mesenchymal transition of the lens epithelial cells, reducing their proliferation, leading ultimately to a small lens and microphthalmia. These observations indicate that aPKCλ, a regulator of polarity and apical junctions, is required for development of a lens that is the correct size and shape...|$|E

The cotton fibre middle lamella (CFML) is crucial for both cell adhesion and detachment processes occurring during fibre development.

Results: Cotton <b>fibre</b> <b>cell</b> adhesion, through the cotton fibre middle lamella (CFML), is a developmentally regulated process determined by genotype.

40|$|Posterior capsular {{opacification}} (PCO) is {{the major}} complication arising after cataract treatment. PCO occurs when the lens epithelial cells remaining following surgery (LCs) undergo a wound healing response producing a mixture of a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA) -expressing myo-fibroblasts and lens fibre cells, which impair vision. Prior investigations have proposed that integrins {{play a central role}} in PCO and we found that, in a mouse <b>fibre</b> <b>cell</b> removal model of cataract surgery, expression of aV integrin and its interacting b-subunits b 1, b 5, b 6, b 8 are up-reg-ulated concomitant with a-SMA in LCs following surgery. To test the hypothesis that aV integrins are functionally important in PCO pathogene-sis, we created mice lacking the aV integrin subunit in all lens cells. Adult lenses lacking aV integrins are transparent and show no apparent morphological abnormalities when compared with control lenses. However, following surgical <b>fibre</b> <b>cell</b> removal, the LCs in control eyes increased cell proliferation, and up-regulated the expression of a-SMA, b 1 -integrin, fibronectin, tenascin-C and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-b) –induced protein within 48 hrs, while LCs lacking aV integrins exhibited much less cell proliferation and little to no up-regulation of any of the fibrotic markers tested. This effect appears to result from the known roles of aV integrins in latent TGF-b activation as aV integrin null lenses do not exhibit detectable SMAD- 3 phosphorylation after surgery, while this occurs robustly in control lenses, consistent with the known roles for TGF-b in fibrotic PCO. These data suggest that therapeutics antagonizing aV integrin function could be used to prevent fibrotic PCO fol-lowing cataract surgery...|$|E

To address this and relate SCW synthesis to candidate genes in willow, a tractable bud culture-derived system was developed in Salix purpurea, and cell wall composition and RNA-Seq transcriptome were followed in stems during early development. A large increase in SCW deposition in the period 0 - 2 weeks after transfer to soil was characterised by a big increase in xylan content, but no change in the frequency of substitution of xylan with glucuronic acid, and increased abundance of putative transcripts for synthesis of SCW cellulose, xylan and lignin.

40|$|During the {{differentiation}} of secondary lens <b>fibre</b> <b>cells</b> from the lens epithelium, the <b>fibre</b> <b>cells</b> lose {{all of their}} cytoplasmic organelles {{as well as their}} nuclei. The <b>fibre</b> <b>cells,</b> containing crystallins, which confer optical clarity, then persist in the adult lens. The process of denucleation of these cells has been likened to an apoptotic event which is not followed by the plasma membrane changes that are characteristic of apoptosis. We have examined the expression and subcellular translocation of molecules of the apoptotic cascade in differentiating lens epithelial cells in culture. In this culture system, the epithelial cells differentiate into lentoids composed of lens <b>fibre</b> <b>cells.</b> We find that caspase- 9, which is expressed and activated before embryonic day 12 in intact lenses, is localized in the cytosol outside mitochondria in non-differentiating cultured cells. In lentoid cells, caspase- 9 migrates into mitochondria after the latter undergo a membrane permeability transition that is characteristic of apoptotic cells. At the same time, caspase- 9 co-localizes with cytochrome c in the cytosol. The cytochrome c is apparently released from the mitochondria in lentoid cells after the mitochondrial membrane permeability transition and during the period of nuclear shrinkage. Also during this time, the mitochondria aggregate around the degenerating nuclei. Cytochrome c disappears rapidly, while mitochondrial breakdown occurs approximately coincident with the disappearance of the nuclei, but mitochondrial remnants persist together with cytochrome c oxidase, which is a mitochondrial marker protein. Apaf- 1, another cytosolic protein of the apoptotic cascade, also migrates to the permeabilized mitochondria and also co-localizes with caspase- 9 and cytochrome c in the cytosol or mitochondria of denucleating cells, thus providing evidence for the formation of an ‘apoptosome’ in these cells, as in apoptotic cells. At no time did we observe the translocation of molecules between cytoplasmic compartments and the nucleus in differentiating lentoid cells. We suggest that the uncoupling of nuclear and membrane apoptotic events in these cells {{may be due to the}} early permeability changes in the mitochondria, resulting in the loss of mitochondrial signalling molecules, or to the failure of molecules to migrate to the nucleus in these cells, thus failing to activate nuclear-plasma membrane signalling pathways...|$|R

Ring width decreases from the pith to the bark, and the breakpoint between JW and AW was at 19 years old when trees from both plantations were pooled together. No differences in Dw or radial and tangential shrinkage occurred with cambial age. EL increased significantly up to the cambial age of 12 - 14 years, after which the increase with age was only slight and no breakpoint between JW and AW was found. With regard to mean longitudinal shrinkage, AW was found to form after the age of 13 years but <b>fibre</b> <b>cell</b> length was significantly longer after the age of 14. 5 and 20 years, depending on the plantation of origin. Therefore, the boundary between JW and AW in plantation grown okoumé occurs between the ages of 13 and 20 years, depending on the characteristic examined...|$|E
40|$|While {{the role}} of growth factors in lens {{development}} has been investigated extensively, {{the role of}} extracellular matrix signalling is less well understood. The developing lens expresses predominantly laminin-binding integrins (such as α 3 β 1, α 6 β 1), which are cooperatively required in the lens epithelium during development. We investigated the role of ILK, a downstream mediator of integrin signalling in mice conditionally null for Ilk. Mutant lenses showed epithelial thinning at E 17. 5 with reduced proliferation and epithelial cell number and aberrant fibre differentiation. There was complete loss of the central epithelium from postnatal day (P) 2 due to cell death followed by <b>fibre</b> <b>cell</b> degeneration and death by P 10 as well as rupture of the lens capsule between P 10 and P 21. At E 17. 5 there was significant inhibition (∼ 50 %) of epithelial cell cycle progression, as shown by BrdU incorporation, cyclin D 1 /D 2 and phospho-histone H 3 immunostaining. The epithelial marker, E-cadherin, was decreased progressively from E 17. 5 to P 2, in the central epithelium, {{but there was no}} significant change in Pax 6 expression. Analyses of ERK and Akt phosphorylation indicated marked depression of MAPK and PI 3 K-Akt signalling, which correlated with decreased phosphorylation of FRS 2 α and Shp 2, indicating altered activation of FGF receptors. At later postnatal stages there was reduced or delayed expression of <b>fibre</b> <b>cell</b> markers (β-crystallin and p 57 (kip 2)). Loss of Ilk also affected deposition of extracellular matrix, with marked retention of collagen IV within differentiating fibre cells. By quantitative RT-PCR array there was significantly decreased expression of 19 genes associated with focal adhesions, actin filament stability and MAPK and PI 3 K/Akt signalling. Overall, these data indicate that ILK is required for complete activation of signalling cascades downstream of the FGF receptor in lens epithelium and fibre cells during development and thus is involved in epithelial proliferation, survival and subsequent fibre differentiation.

30|$|Endophytic fungi such as S. globuliferum and Cladosporium sp. can {{penetrate}} {{plant tissue}} while producing pectinase and cellulase enzymes (Brown and Sharma 1984; Wang and Dai 2011). A. infectoria {{has also been}} reported to perform enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose (Silva et al. 2014). This confirms that pectin and carbohydrate degrading enzymes were produced during field retting giving decay in the hemp <b>fibre</b> <b>cell</b> walls (Table  1) and agrees with the measured enzyme activities (Fig.  3). Cryptococcus can produce cutinase enzymes (Masaki et al. 2005) involved in cutin degradation in the cuticle on hemp stem surface, which explains why it was present initially. The zero laccase activity {{is consistent with the}} lack of Basidiomycota fungi in field retting. The higher Klason lignin content of the field retted fibres (Table  1) is presumably due to the zero laccase activity (Fig.  3, and consistent with lack of ligninolytic Basidiomycota fungi (Table  3).|$|E
40|$|Bovine lens epithelium, cortex and nucleus were {{screened}} {{for the presence}} of red-cell-membrane band 4. 1 -like proteins by using an immunoblot method. Lens epithelial cells were found to contain proteins of Mr 78 000 and higher (approximately 150 000) that cross-reacted with anti-(protein 4. 1) sera. <b>Fibre</b> <b>cells</b> of the superficial cortex were also found to contain these two proteins, as well as an additional protein of approx. 80 000 Mr. In contrast, deep layers of the cortex and the lens nucleus contained no detectable cross-reactive protein at these Mr values. Treatment of a crude membrane fraction prepared from superficial bovine cortices with a low-ionic-strength buffer resulted in release of the high-Mr band 4. 1 -like protein. The 80 000 - and 78 000 -Mr proteins remained with the membrane fraction in low-ionic-strength buffer, but were released into solution by high-ionic-strength-buffer treatment. We have also demonstrated that the human red-blood-cell membrane, like lens epithelial <b>cells</b> and <b>fibre</b> <b>cells,</b> also contains a high-Mr band 4. 1 -like protein that is released from membranes by low-ionic-strength-buffer treatment...|$|R
