500|$|In the {{beginning}} of the episode, Liz and Josh Girard (Lonny Ross) are exchanging Yo Mamma Jokes. According to Fey, Liz's joke, [...] "What's the difference between your mama and a washing machine? When <b>I</b> <b>drop</b> a load in the washing machine, it doesn't follow me around for a week", was [...] "pretty dirty", and was surprised that the show was able to get away with the joke. It has since been censored in syndication.|$|E
500|$|Ling is {{not above}} using her {{ethnicity}} {{as a means}} of gaining advantage. [...] In one episode, as she delivers her closing arguments to a jury, she says [...] "There's a very old expression in China," [...] and then begins to speak in Chinese. In the subtitles we see her saying, [...] "It really doesn't matter what I say here, because none of you speak Chinese. But you can see from my sad face I'm sympathetic. You hear from my tone it's appropriate to feel sorry for me. As <b>I</b> <b>drop</b> to a faint whisper (which she does), you'll feel the sorrow yourself. I'm going to finish now, pretend to cry", which she does as she walks off.|$|E
500|$|On September 4, 1995, Simms' jersey was {{retired in}} a halftime {{ceremony}} {{of a game}} versus the Dallas Cowboys. During an emotional speech, Simms stated {{that he wanted to}} don his jersey one final time, and throw [...] "one more pass" [...] to teammate Lawrence Taylor. Simms later commented, [...] "ll of a sudden it kind of hit me, I've put Lawrence in a really tough spot; national TV, he's got dress shoes and a sports jacket on, and he's had a few beers and he's going to run down the field and I'm going to throw him a pass." [...] Simms then motioned for Taylor to run a longer pattern, and after 30–40yards, threw him the pass. Taylor later stated that the situation made him more nervous than any play of his career, [...] "I'm saying to myself (as the pass is being thrown), 'If <b>I</b> <b>drop</b> this pass, I got to run my black ass all the way to Upper Saddle River because there ain't no way I'm {{going to be able to}} stay in that stadium'." [...] Taylor caught the pass however, and the capacity crowd in attendance cheered in approval. Since he has been retired for more than five years, Simms is eligible for selection into the Pro Football Hall of Fame; he has yet to be inducted, however.|$|E

500|$|After {{his career}} ended, Taylor worked in several regular {{television}} jobs. He first {{worked as a}} football analyst for the now defunct TNT Sunday Night Football. In a one-off show, Taylor also appeared as a wrestler in the World Wrestling Federation, defeating Bam Bam Bigelow in the main event of WrestleMania XI. He also worked as a color commentator on an amateur fighting program entitled Toughman on the FX channel. On September 4, 1995, the Giants retired Phil Simms' jersey during halftime of {{a game against the}} Cowboys (Taylor had his number retired the year before). Simms celebrated the moment by throwing an impromptu ceremonial pass to Taylor. Simms recalled, [...] "ll of a sudden it kind of hit me, I've put Lawrence in a really tough spot; national TV, he's got dress shoes and a sports jacket on, and he's had a few beers and he's going to run down the field and I'm going to throw him a pass."

[...] Taylor caught the pass, however, and the capacity crowd in attendance cheered in approval.|$|E
500|$|Moore {{began writing}} the series very early on, hoping to avoid {{publication}} delays {{such as those}} faced by the DC limited series Camelot 3000. When writing the script for the first issue, Moore said he realized, [...] "I only had enough plot for six issues. We were contracted for 12!" [...] His solution was to alternate issues that dealt with the overall plot of the series with origin issues for the characters. Moore wrote very detailed scripts for Gibbons to work from. Gibbons recalled that [...] "he script for {{the first issue of}} Watchmen was, I think, 101 pages of typescript—single-spaced—with no gaps between the individual panel descriptions or, indeed, even between the pages." [...] Upon receiving the scripts, the artist had to number each page [...] "in case <b>I</b> <b>drop</b> them on the floor, because it would take me two days to put them back in the right order", and used a highlighter pen to single out lettering and shot descriptions; he remarked, [...] "It takes quite a bit of organizing before you can actually put pen to paper." [...] Despite Moore's detailed scripts, his panel descriptions would often end with the note [...] "If that doesn't work for you, do what works best"; Gibbons nevertheless worked to Moore's instructions. In fact, Gibbons only suggested a single change to the script: a compression of Ozymandias' narration while he was preventing a sneak attack by Rorschach, as he felt that the dialog was too long to fit with the amount of action expressed; Moore agreed and re-wrote the scene. Gibbons {{had a great deal of}} autonomy in developing the visual look of Watchmen, and frequently inserted background details that Moore admitted he did not notice until later. Moore occasionally contacted fellow comics writer Neil Gaiman for answers to research questions and for quotes to include in issues.|$|E
2500|$|Actor Fenella Fielding, {{who worked}} with him on Follow a Star, commented “Not a very {{pleasant}} man. Always making a pass – hand up your skirt first thing in the morning. Not exactly a lovely way to start a day’s filming.” while Lynda Bellingham said with reference to A Little Bit of Wisdom [...] "I did a comedy series where Norman Wisdom, bless his little cotton socks, said, [...] "We're going to do this scene now where <b>I</b> <b>drop</b> a pencil down the front of your dress and I look for it." [...] "Oh, I see, is that funny?" [...] "Oh, it'll be hysterical." [...] So for ten minutes I stood there while he basically touched me up and you couldn't say anything because he was the master of comedy." ...|$|E

2500|$|In August 2013, Schoolboy Q {{called the}} album his [...] "best work yet." [...] He also {{called it a}} classic, but hoped his fans will have the final say: [...] "It's a classic album I would like to say, but I would like the people to say it's a classic. But in my eyes it's a crazy album…I'm really proud of myself for this record." [...] Schoolboy Q further commented on the album as he {{compared}} it to past releases including 2012's Habits & Contradictions and his independent debut, Setbacks. The rapper stated that the major difference between the three projects is that he wasn't forced to compromise on Oxymoron: [...] "It's me. This album is really me. It's my life. Habits & Contradictions and Setbacks was more like—I compromised a little bit also with them projects. 'Hands on the Wheel' was like I really was like 'I'mma go to radio with this'…I made this project the way I wanted it to make. I wanted it to sound [...] So, this album is crazy. It's my best work. I {{know a lot of}} rappers say that when they dropping they albums, but I'm one of those dudes it ain't like <b>I</b> <b>drop</b> mixtapes. It ain't like I do that type of stuff. Drop songs every month to let you know I'm really in the studio perfecting things." [...] In addition to losing the need to compromise, Schoolboy Q hinted Oxymoron may boast a [...] "more comfortable Q." [...] While speaking exclusively with HipHopDX earlier in the year, the rapper shared a few words of advice for his fellow emcees as he touched on his increased comparability with music: [...] "I feel like all rappers, the more comfortable you are, the better your raps are gon' be. When I was in the studios , I wrote the verse, and I wasn't comfortable, but I just did it anyway. The more comfortable you are with your music, the iller you gon' get. You feel confident and comfortable in your voice and find yourself." [...] In September 2013, Schoolboy Q discussed how gang history would be included in his album: [...] "I've never said this in an interview," [...] Schoolboy Q {{said in an interview with}} Life+Times: [...] "This album is about me taking care of my daughter and Crip history from 1969 to present." ...|$|E
