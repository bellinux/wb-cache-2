2500|$|The comedian/lyricist Tom Lehrer penned {{a number}} of humorous and well known songs {{relating}} to nuclear weapons.

It assumes that the entire planet will be instantaneously wiped clean by nuclear fire, and bypasses the much grimmer idea of radiation poisoning. [...] A third song by Lehrer, So Long Mom (A Song From World War III), was introduced as existing because, [...] "If any songs are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> World War III, we had better start writing them now," [...] and tells the tale of a young soldier marching off to nuclear war, promising his mother that [...] "Although I may roam, I'll come back to my home/ Although it may be a pile of debris" [...] and also satirizing the likely extremely short duration of a major nuclear war ("And I'll look for you when the war is over/ An hour and a half from now!").|$|E

5000|$|When {{asked how}} they have evolved as artists, Grey offers an {{insightful}} perspective. “I think it’s about the art of letting go. Not having preconceived expectations of what is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> you. I think for me personally {{it was a really}} fluid process. I tried {{to have a lot more}} fun with the making of this record. We wanted to go back to our more electronic roots.

Animals were incorporated into the game to convey a mood of adventure, in contrast to the digital pet-based Chao creatures highlighted in previous project Sonic Adventure 2. The GameCube was chosen for development over the competing PlayStation 2 and Xbox because of its wide audience that Naka felt would appreciate such a family-friendly game. The game uses an engine that Naka called [...] "an evolution of the Sonic Adventure 2 engine." [...] The game was exhibited at Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) 2003.|$|E
