40|$|International audienceImplementation of {{electrical}} propulsion on new generation satellites involves development of high voltage solar arrays which supposes to solve some technological problems. One {{of these problems}} is {{the interaction between the}} solar panel and the environment knowing that this environment is modified by the plasma created by electrical propulsion. Concurrently to a numerical approach conducted with SPIS computations, presented in a dedicated presentation, we have carried out an experimental work in order to validate these simulation results. Tests are performed in JONAS plasma facility on a semi-solar panel sizing 4 x 1 m². The solar panel is polarized up to Vbus = 350 V to simulate the voltage generated by lightened solar cells. All the electrical setup and solar panel <b>are</b> <b>kept</b> <b>electrically</b> floating versus the chamber walls. Two electrical layouts of solar cell strings are studied with 3 plasma densities from 10 e 11 to 10 e 13 m- 3. For each electrical layout, plasma density and Vbus value, we measure the floating potential of the solar panel and the collected plasma current by solar cells strings...|$|R
40|$|Theoretical {{analysis}} and some experiments {{have demonstrated that}} siliconon- insulator (SOI) 4 -gate transistors the type known as G(exp 4) FETs could be efficiently used for in-plane crossing of signal paths. Much of the effort of designing very-large-scale integrated (VLSI) circuits is focused on area-efficient routing of signals. The main source of difficulty in VLSI signal routing is the requirement to prevent crossing, in the same plane, of wires that are meant to <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>electrically</b> insulated from each other. Consequently, it often becomes necessary to design and build VLSI circuits in multiple layers with vias (connections between conductors in different layers at selected locations). Suitable devices that would prevent, or at least sufficiently suppress, undesired electrical coupling (cross-talk) between wires crossing in the same plane would enable compact, simpler implementation complex interconnection networks with in-plane crossings that, heretofore, have not been possible in VLSI circuitry. The use of G 4 FETs as in-plane signal-crossing devices or routers, {{in combination with the}} use of G(exp 4) FETs as universal programmable logic gates, would create opportunities for reducing complexity in VLSI design...|$|R

5000|$|Circle graphs {{arise in}} VLSI {{physical}} design as an abstract representation {{for a special}} case for wire routing, known as [...] "two-terminal switchbox routing". In this case the routing area is a rectangle, all nets are two-terminal, and the terminals are placed on {{the perimeter of the}} rectangle. It is easily seen that the intersection graph of these nets is a circle graph. [...] Among the goals of wire routing step is to ensure that different nets stay <b>electrically</b> <b>disconnected,</b> and their potential intersecting parts must be laid out in different conducting layers. Therefore circle graphs capture various aspects of this routing problem.|$|R

40|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} is {{the most}} common arrhythmia and in symptomatic patients with a drug-refractory form, catheter ablation aimed at <b>electrically</b> <b>disconnecting</b> the pulmonary veins (PVs) has proved more effective than use of antiarrhythmic drugs in maintaining sinus rhythm during follow-up. On the other hand, this ablation procedure is complex, requires specific training and adequate clinical experience. A main challenge is represented by the need for accurate sequential positioning of the ablation catheter around each veno-atrial junction to deliver point-by-point radiofrequency energy applications in order to achieve complete and persistent electrical disconnection of the PVs. Imaging integration is a new technology that enables guidance during this procedure by showing a three-dimensional, pre-acquired computed tomography or magnetic resonance image and the relative real-time position of the ablation catheter on the screen of the electroanatomic system. Reports in the literature suggest that imaging integration provides accurate visual information with improvement in the procedure parameters and/or clinical outcomes of the procedure...|$|R
40|$|The term “shoulder formation” {{refers to}} an {{increase}} of the density decay length in the scrape-off layer (SOL) observed in many tokamaks during L-mode operation when a density threshold is reached. Recent experiments in ASDEX Upgrade (AUG) and JET {{have shown that the}} shoulder forms when the divertor collisionality in the divertor <b>electrically</b> <b>disconnects</b> filaments from the wall. This leads to a transition from the sheath limited to the inertial regime and to an enhancement of radial particle transport, in good agreement with analytical models. In the present work, the validity of such a mechanism is investigated in the more reactor-relevant H-mode regime. For this, a cold divertor H-mode scenario is developed in AUG using different levels of D puffing and N seeding, in which inter-ELM filaments and SOL density profiles are measured. The basic relation between filament size and divertor collisionality is still valid in H-mode plasmas, albeit an additional condition related to the gas fueling rate has been found for the formation of the shoulder...|$|R
50|$|Safety {{meetings}} are typically held {{before and during}} shutdowns. Other safety measures include providing adequate ventilation to hot areas or areas where oxygen may become depleted or toxic gases may be present and checking vessels and other enclosed areas for adequate levels of oxygen and insure absence of toxic or explosive gases. Any machines {{that are going to}} be worked on must be <b>electrically</b> <b>disconnected,</b> usually through the motor starter, so that it cannot operate. It is common practice to put a padlock on the motor starter, which can only be unlocked by the person or persons who is or are endangered by performing the work. Other disconnect means include removing couplings between the motor and the equipment or by using mechanical means to keep the equipment from moving. Valves on pipes connected to vessels that workers will enter are chained and locked closed, unless some other means is taken to insure that nothing will come through the pipes.|$|R
40|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) is an arrhythmia {{associated with}} increased morbidity and mortality. The pulmonary veins (PVs) {{play an important role}} not only in the onset but also the maintenance of AF. Therefore, the goal of present AF ablation is to <b>electrically</b> <b>disconnect</b> the PVs {{from the rest of the}} atrium by ablating around the origin of the PVs. Several groups using ablation of all 4 PVs outside the tubular portion have reported that the success rate without antiarrhythmic drugs is much more consistent, at 75 to 95 %. A further 10 % to 20 % of patients may become responsive to previously ineffective antiarrhythmic drugs. Although the success rate of AF ablation appears high, a very low incidence of complications has been reported including cardiac tamponade, embolism, esophageal injury, PV stenosis, and proarrhythmia resulting from reentrant tachycardias. However, the complication rates can be decreased by more recent modifications to the technique and presently available technologies. Thus, AF ablation is an effective, safe, and established treatment for AF that offers an excellent chance for a lasting cure...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{evaluation}} of cracks in PV modules {{is a difficult}} task: cracks do not necessarily lead to a strong degradation in the power output of the module directly after the crack initiation. However, PV modules with cracks suffer from a lower stability of the power output under artificial ageing. This is partly because cracked cell areas can become <b>electrically</b> <b>disconnected</b> from the active cell area. Here we present {{the analysis of the}} criticality of cracks formed in a uniform load test. For this we evaluate cracks which may isolate cell areas. We observe 667 cracked cells in 27 PV modules with 60 cells each. Cracks parallel to the busbars constitute 50 % of the crack orientations in our experiments. This crack orientation has a high probability of having a potentially separated cell area Acrack of 16 to 24 % and can thus be considered to be of high criticality. We proceed by subjecting 12 of these PV modules to 200 cycles of a humidity-freeze test. A significant part of 29 % of the cracked cells shows an increased resistance across the cracks and 7 % show isolated cell areas...|$|R

40|$|An {{electrical}} protection system, {{which can be}} connected between an electrical power supply and an electrical load, firstly includes a switch switchable between a normal state in which the switch is electrically connected in series between the power supply and the load such that an operating current passes through the switch and the load, and a fault sate in which the switch is disconnected with the load such that no current passes through the load. The switch switches to the fault state in an over-current or an over-temperature situation. The system further includes a controller operable in an open state when the switch operates in the normal state, in which state the controller is <b>electrically</b> <b>disconnected</b> from the power supply such that no current passes through the controller, or a closed state when the switch operates in the fault state, in which state the controller is electrically connected in series between the switch and the power supply such that a self-holding current passes through the switch and the controller. The controller operates to automatically set the switch to the normal state when the self-holding current is off.

40|$|Despite {{the promise}} of {{extremely}} high theoretical capacity (2 Li + O_ 2 ↔ Li_ 2 O_ 2, 1675 mAh per gram of oxygen), many challenges currently impede development of Li/O_ 2 battery technology. Finding suitable electrode and electrolyte materials remains the most elusive challenge to date. A radical new approach is to replace volatile, unstable and air-intolerant organic electrolytes common to prior {{research in the field}} with alkali metal nitrate molten salt electrolytes and operate the battery above the liquidus temperature (> 80 °C). Here we demonstrate an intermediate temperature Li/O_ 2 battery using a lithium anode, a molten nitrate-based electrolyte (e. g., LiNO_ 3 –KNO_ 3 eutectic) and a porous carbon O_ 2 cathode with high energy efficiency (∼ 95 %) and improved rate capability because the discharge product, lithium peroxide, is stable and moderately soluble in the molten salt electrolyte. The results, supported by essential state-of-the-art electrochemical and analytical techniques such as in situ pressure and gas analyses, scanning electron microscopy, rotating disk electrode voltammetry, demonstrate that Li_ 2 O_ 2 electrochemically forms and decomposes upon cycling with discharge/charge overpotentials as low as 50 mV. We show that the cycle life of such batteries is limited only by carbon reactivity and by the uncontrolled precipitation of Li_ 2 O_ 2, which eventually becomes <b>electrically</b> <b>disconnected</b> from the O_ 2 electrode...|$|R
