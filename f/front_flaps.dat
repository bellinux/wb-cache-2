60|$|Quarter of an {{hour later}} all of the boys had turned in. Blumpo picked out {{a corner of the}} tent nearest the rear. Harry slept in the middle, while Jerry took up a place not far from the <b>front</b> <b>flaps.</b>|$|E
60|$|A hundred packers, bending {{under their}} loads, stopped to watch him. He yelled frantic warnings, {{and those in}} his path {{stumbled}} and staggered clear. Below, on the lower edge of the glacier, was pitched a small tent, which seemed leaping toward him, so rapidly did it grow larger. He left the beaten track where the packers' trail swerved to the left, and struck a patch of fresh snow. This arose about him in frosty smoke, while it reduced his speed. He saw the tent the instant he struck it, carrying away the corner guys, bursting in the <b>front</b> <b>flaps,</b> and fetching up inside, still {{on top of the}} tarpaulin {{and in the midst of}} his grub-sacks. The tent rocked drunkenly, and in the frosty vapour he found himself face to face with a startled young woman who was sitting up in her blankets--the very one who had called him a tenderfoot at Dyea.|$|E
50|$|The Carrera RS is a {{lightweight}} {{variant of the}} Carrera. It features a naturally aspirated 3.8 liter engine with 300 hp (DIN). On the outside it is easily distinguishable by a special non-retractable rear wing, small <b>front</b> <b>flaps</b> and 3-piece 18 in aluminum wheels. The headlight washers were deleted for weight saving reasons. Inside the rear seats were removed, and special racing seats and spartan door cards were installed. Sound proofing was also reduced to a minimum.|$|E

50|$|The dustjacket <b>front</b> <b>flap</b> of {{the first}} edition carried no {{specially}} written blurb. Instead, both the <b>front</b> and back <b>flap</b> carried advertisements for Christie's five other Bodley Head books together {{with one or two}} short quotes from reviews of those books.|$|R
5000|$|In clothing, {{the term}} {{double-breasted}} {{refers to a}} coat or jacket with wide, overlapping <b>front</b> <b>flaps</b> and two parallel columns of buttons or snaps; by contrast, a single-breasted coat has a narrow overlap and only one column of buttons. In most modern double-breasted coats, one column of buttons is decorative, while the other is functional. The other buttons, placed on the outside edge of the coat breast, allow the overlap to fasten reversibly, right lapel over left lapel. To strengthen the fastening, a functional inner-button, called the jigger (or anchor button), is usually added to parallel-fasten the over-lapped layers together from the inside.|$|E
5000|$|The TM was {{originally}} introduced in 1974, and {{was of a}} clean and modern design. A thorough update in 1982 left the appearance mostly untouched - perhaps {{to the detriment of}} sales of the mostly new model. Improvements included the new Detroit Diesel [...] "Silver 92" [...] engine, a new frame, many new engine and transmission options, {{and a variety of other}} updated fittings. The Fuller transmissions now received a new telescopic shift mechanism, allowing for a sealed cabin floor. The cab is counterbalanced so as to allow one-man tilting, while two <b>front</b> <b>flaps</b> allow access to check on vitals.|$|E

A large umbrella-like {{overhang}} is visible to the right, while a portion of another tent is visible to the left in the foreground. A rug and table are visible in the second tent, while both tents rest upon wooden palates. Egg-shaped paper lamps are visible hanging from lines, while one has a Chinese or Japanese character written on it. The trunks of redwood trees are visible throughout and obscure portions of the tents...|$|E

5000|$|A lap-lap is a waistcloth or loincloth worn in Papua New Guinea and the South Pacific. This item of {{clothing}} has three parts: a <b>front</b> <b>flap,</b> a back flap, and a thread to tie {{them around the}} waist. The sides are generally open. How much is covered by the <b>front</b> and back <b>flaps</b> varies.|$|R
40|$|Low Reynolds number {{airfoils}} {{have become}} of interest recently for applications on Micro-air Vehicles (MAVs). Airfoils at low Reynolds numbers and high angles of attack {{are known to}} be unstable due to low lift to drag ratios. This study investigates the effect of a movable leading edge flap on the lift to drag ratio of an airfoil for use on MAVs. Direct numerical simulation (DNS) is used to fully resolve the flow around a thin airfoil at high angles of attack. The airfoil is represented numerically using a fictitious domain approach and assuming two-dimensional flow. The solver is validated using the standard case of a cylinder in cross-flow. Preliminary experimental data for the lift of the airfoil compares well with the numerical results for two angles of attack. Cases were run at a Reynolds number of 14, 700 and an angle of attack of 20 degrees to study the effect of the <b>front</b> <b>flap</b> at a static angle and the effect of an oscillating <b>front</b> <b>flap.</b> Lowering the <b>front</b> <b>flap</b> to an angle of 20 degrees increased the lift to drag ratio to 5. 84 compared to 2. 47 for the no flap case. Cases with a moving <b>front</b> <b>flap</b> were run at 1, 3, and 5 Hz. The flapping motion caused the time-varying lift coefficient to become more predictable and periodic. The presence of lift and drag fluctuations is found to depend on how vortices are shed from {{the leading edge of the}} airfoil...|$|R

25|$|Mego Corporation {{released}} {{a line of}} dolls in 1976 to correspond with the TV series. The boxes originally featured Lynda Carter as Wonder Woman on the <b>front</b> <b>flap.</b> However, in 1977, her image on the box was dropped and the line was revamped with only the Wonder Woman doll being featured and revised.|$|R
50|$|The dustjacket <b>front</b> <b>flap</b> of {{the first}} edition carried no {{specially}} written blurb. Instead it repeated the text which appeared on the jacket of The Mysterious Affair at Styles (the back jacket flap carrying review quotes of the earlier novel). In later editions, blurbs first published {{in the back of}} Poirot Investigates were used.|$|R

5000|$|A {{hardcover}} {{issue of}} this book was released through the Book-of-the-Month Club (USA) in late 1969 and remained available through 1970. It is an octavo-sized book, bound in gray textured paper boards, stamped in green on the spine, in a dust-cover with [...] "Book Club Edition" [...] printed {{in lieu of the}} price on the bottom <b>front</b> <b>flap.</b> It remains the only hardcover edition of this title ever printed.|$|R
500|$|The áo ngũ thân had two flaps sewn {{together}} in the back, two flaps sewn {{together in}} the front, and a [...] "baby flap" [...] hidden underneath the main <b>front</b> <b>flap.</b> The gown appeared to have two-flaps with slits on both sides, features preserved in the later ao dai. Compared to a modern ao dai, the <b>front</b> and back <b>flaps</b> were much broader and the fit looser and much shorter. It had a high collar and was buttoned {{in the same fashion}} as a modern ao dai. Women could wear the dress with the top few buttons undone, revealing a glimpse of their yếm underneath.|$|R

50|$|The {{traditional}} Oxford and Cambridge style satchel is {{a simple}} design that features a simple pouch with a <b>front</b> <b>flap.</b> Variations include designs with a single or double pocket {{on the front and}} sometimes a handle {{on the top of the}} bag. The classic school bag satchel often had two straps, so that it could be worn like a backpack, with the design having the straps coming in a V from the centre of the back of the bag, rather than separate straps on each side. This style is sometimes called a satchel backpack.|$|R
50|$|This {{style is}} {{commonly}} {{made from the}} head of an animal such as the badger, otter, fox, kangaroo mouse, pine marten, or other small animals. The animal's head typically forms the <b>front</b> <b>flap</b> of the pouch, and the body of the pouch is made from the same pelt. This style displays the Scottish tradition, since the earliest pouches probably included the head with the pelt. Today, people do not wear this style very often for standard formal occasions, though it may be worn in historic re-enactments and festivals as a costume accessory.|$|R
5000|$|In 1999, when {{compiling}} all of O'Flaherty's {{short stories}} A. A. Kelly found {{a total of}} 183. [...] These were published in a 3 volume set, Liam O'Flaherty: The Collected Stories.
