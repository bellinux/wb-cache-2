For these applications, and are generally retrieved with seismic refraction tomography combining P and SH (shear-horizontal) waves, thus requiring two separate acquisitions. Surface-wave prospecting methods are proposed here as an alternative to SH-wave tomography in order to retrieve pseudo- 2 D Vs sections from typical P-wave shot gathers and assess the applicability of combined P-wave refraction tomography and surface-wave dispersion analysis to estimate Vp/Vs ratio. We carried out a simultaneous P- and surface-wave survey on a well-characterized granite-micaschists contact at Ploemeur hydrological observatory (France), supplemented with an SH-wave acquisition along the same line in order to compare Vs results obtained from SH-wave refraction tomography and surface-wave profiling. Travel-time tomography was performed with P- and SH- wave first arrivals observed along the line to retrieve Vtomo p and Vtomo s models. Windowing and stacking techniques were then used to extract evenly spaced dispersion data from P-wave shot gathers along the line. Successive 1 D Monte Carlo inversions of these dispersion data were performed using fixed Vp values extracted from Vtomo p the model and no lateral constraints between two adjacent 1 D inversions. The resulting 1 D Vsw s models were then assembled to create a pseudo- 2 D Vsw s section, which appears to be correctly matching the general features observed on the section. If the pseudo-section is characterized by strong velocity <b>incertainties</b> in the deepest layers, it provides a more detailed description of the lateral variations in the shallow layers. Theoretical dispersion curves were also computed along the line with both and models. While the dispersion curves computed from models provide results consistent with the coherent maxima observed on dispersion images, dispersion curves computed from models are generally not fitting the observed propagation modes at low frequency. Surface-wave analysis could therefore improve models both in terms of reliability and ability to describe lateral variations. Finally, we were able to compute / sections from both and models. The two sections present similar features, but the section obtained from shows a higher lateral resolution and is consistent with the features observed on electrical resistivity tomography, thus validating our approach for retrieving Vp/Vs ratio from combined P-wave tomography and surface-wave profiling...|$|R

40|$|We propose in {{this study}} an initial {{estimation}} of the annual organic matter yield induced by chemical weathering of carbonates and shales considering their global surface at outcrop and their organic matter content. The calculation also uses data on river fluxes resulting from carbonate rocks and shales weathering in major world watersheds, published by numerous authors [1]. The results obtained from the studied watersheds have been extrapolated to a global scale. Despite rather large <b>incertainty</b> inherent to such an approach, the calculated value [2] of ca. 0. 1 Gt implies that the annual organic carbon yield related to carbonates and shales chemical weathering might be a non-negligible component of the global carbon cycle. The calculated yield does not constitute a direct supply to soils and the rivers because {{a part of the}} produced organic matter can be mineralised, thus escaping recycling. Depending on the real fate of the organic carbon released from weathered ancient formations, i. e. mineralisation or recycling, this process might affect the efficiency of chemical weathering as a carbon sink, the global soil organic carbon amount estimation, or the evaluation of the total amount of the organic matter occurring in rivers. Whatever the hypothesis considered, this study suggests that the inherited organic yield is a key-component of the global organic carbon cycle understanding that has been to much omitted up to now. Because it exists and in addition because it might represent a non negligible carbon pool, fossil organic carbon deserves {{to be taken into account}} for a better evaluation of the organic stocks in soils and rivers presently only based on climatic data and current vegetal production.

40|$|Defined Benefit and Defined Contribution {{plans have}} {{significantly}} different characteristics {{with respect to}} the risks faced by employers and employees, the sensitivity of benefits to inflation, the flexibility of funding, and the importance of governmental supervision. In this paper, we examine some of the main tradeoffs involved in the choice between DB and DC plans. Our most general conclusion is that neither plan type can be said to wholly dominate the other from the perspective of employee welfare. The major advantage of DB plans is the potential they offer to provide a stable replacement rate of final income to workers. If the replacement rate is the relevant variable for worker retirement utility, then DB plans offer some degree of insurance against real wage risk. Of course, protection offered to workers is risk borne by the firm. As real wages change, funding rates must correspondingly adjust. However, to the extent that real wage risk is largely diversifiable to employers, and nondiversifiable to employees, the replacement rate stability should be viewed as an advantage of DB plans. The advantages of DC plans are most apparent during periods of inflation uncertainty. These are: the predictability of the value of pension wealth, the ability to invest in inflation-hedged portfolios rather than nominal DB annuities,and the fully-funded nature of the DC plan. Finally, the DC plan has the advantage that workers can more easily determine the true present value of the pension benefit they earn in any year, although they may have more <b>incertainty</b> about future pension-benefit flows at retirement. Measuring the present value of accruing defined benefits is difficult at best and imposes severe informational requirements on workers. Such difficulties could lead workers to misvalue their total compensation, and result in misinformed behavior. ...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{provides}} a novel molecular {{demonstration of the}} hybrid origin of two rare Potamogeton natans hybrids, namely P. × gessnacensis (=P. natans × P. polygonifolius) and P. × vepsicus (=P. natans × P. praelongus), based on nuclear and plastid DNA sequence data. The results of the DNA-based survey were somehow unexpected due to incongruence with the primary background of a preliminary morphological identification of the putative hybrid collections. Our results further demonstrate the <b>incertainty</b> in treatment of hybrids in several taxa of Potamogeton based on morphological characteristics. In this context, we suggest that morphological characters and chorological data {{of at least a}} part of P. natans hybrids, particularly P. × sparganiifolius (=P. gramineus × P. natans) and P. × vepsicus, should be verified. Taking into account the new data, other recently published records and rectification of erroneous reports, we also present a reappraisal of the current knowledge on Potamogeton hybrid diversity in Poland as compared with selected other European areas well studied in this respect (British Isles, Czech Republic, Germany), with a notion on general rules shaping the distribution pattern of these taxa in Europe. According to the current data, 12 Potamogeton hybrids have been recorded so far in Poland. Among 32 Potamogeton hybrids reported at least in one of the aforementioned areas, Potamogeton × angustifolius, P. × nitens and P. × salicifolius are the most common taxa, while 18 hybrids are based on records from a single country and predominantly from few localities only. Sparse records of {{at least part of the}} rare hybrid taxa reflect a still insufficient state of knowledge on the regional hybrid diversity. However, both at the scale of Poland and Europe, the likely general pattern of the occurrence of Potamogeton hybrids in Europe may indicate that their diversity and frequency of occurrence increase with latitude...|$|E
