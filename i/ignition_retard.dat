This paper evaluates the application of an electrically heated catalyst on a hybrid vehicle equipped with a Natural Gas (NG) engine.

Soylu and Gerpen developed a two zone thermodynamic model to investigate the effects of ignition timing, fuel composition, and equivalence ratio on the burning rate and cylinder pressure for a natural gas engine [5].

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of combustion phasing and combustion descriptors to ignition timing, load and mixture quality on fuelling a multi-cylinder {{natural gas engine}} with bio-derived H- 2 and CO rich syngas is addressed. While the descriptors for conventional fuels are well established and are in use for closed loop engine control, presence of H- 2 in syngas potentially alters the mixture properties and hence combustion phasing, necessitating the current study. The ability of the descriptors to predict abnormal combustion, hitherto missing in the literature, is also addressed. Results from experiments using multi-cylinder engines and numerical studies using zero dimensional Wiebe function based simulation models are reported. For syngas with 20 % H- 2 and CO and 2 % CH 4 (producer gas), an <b>ignition</b> <b>retard</b> of 5 +/- 1 degrees was required compared to natural gas ignition timing to achieve peak load of 72. 8 kWe. It is found that, for syngas, whose flammability limits are 0. 42 - 1. 93, the optimal engine operation was at an equivalence ratio of 1. 12. The same methodology is extended to a two cylinder engine towards addressing the influence of syngas composition, especially H- 2 fraction (varying from 13 % to 37 %), on the combustion phasing. The study confirms the utility of pressure trace derived combustion descriptors, except for the pressure trace first derivative, in describing the MBT operating condition of the engine when fuelled with an alternative fuel. Both experiments and analysis suggest most of the combustion descriptors to be independent of the engine load and mixture quality. A near linear relationship with ignition angle is observed. The general trend(s) of the combustion descriptors for syngas fuelled operation {{are similar to those}} of conventional fuels; the differences in {{sensitivity of}} the descriptors for syngas fuelled engine operation requires re-calibration of control logic for MBT conditions.

50|$|At {{start the}} {{ignition}} point is 10° BTDC. To facilitate start when coolant temperature is below 0°C the ECU will ground each trigger line 210 times/second between 10° BTDC and 20° ATDC, at which a “multi spark” will appear. The function is active up to an engine speed of 900 RPM. At idle a special ignition matrix is utilised. Normal ignition point is 6°-8° BTDC. If the engine stalls e.g. cooling fan activation the ignition point is advanced up to 20 ° BTDC {{in order to increase}} the engines torque to restore the idle RPM. In the same way the <b>ignition</b> is <b>retarded</b> if the engines RPM is increased. When the TPS senses an increase in throttle opening the ECU leaves the idle ignition timing map and regulates the ignition timing in respect of load and engine speed.|$|R
50|$|Twincharging's largest benefit over anti-lag {{systems in}} race cars is its reliability. Anti-lag systems work {{in one of}} two ways: by running very rich AFR and pumping air into the exhaust to ignite the extra fuel in the exhaust manifold; or by {{severely}} <b>retarding</b> <b>ignition</b> timing to cause the combustion event to continue well after the exhaust valve has opened. Both methods involve combustion in the exhaust manifold to keep the turbine spinning, and the heat from this will shorten the life of the turbine greatly.|$|R

Two-stroke engines, when running at low power, are less sensitive to ignition timing changes than four-stroke engine. If the timing is retarded for low throttle positions, from perhaps 35° BTDC at normal speeds to TDC or even 10° after TDC at slow idle, the engine runs well without four-stroking. Opening up the throttle and simultaneously advancing the timing, allows a rapid pickup in speed. This system is widely used for outboard motors, particularly when used to pull water skiers.|$|R

There are instances when traction control is undesirable, such as trying to get a vehicle unstuck in snow or mud.

Three different lance configurations, including a single lance, a double air-cooled coaxial lance, and an oxy-coal lance with different oxygen enrichment patterns, are taken into consideration. The {{coal combustion}} efficiency by the double lance injection is 5. 1 % higher than that by single lance injection. From the calculated temperature by the oxy-coal lance, coal <b>ignition</b> is <b>retarded</b> due to the cooling effect of enriched oxygen flowing through the lance annulus, resulting in the moderation of pressure loss within the raceway.

Consequently, the coal burnout under the oxy-coal lance injection is comparative to that under the double air-cooled lance injection. The performance of blast furnace may be improved with the advantages provided by the oxy-coal lance injection.

An initial counterflow of unmixed nitrogen-diluted hydrogen and heated air is perturbed by two-dimensional homogeneous turbulence. The {{temperature of the}} heated air stream is chosen to be 1, 100 K which is substantially higher than the crossover temperature at which the rates of the chain branching and termination reactions become equal. Three different turbulence intensities are tested {{in order to assess}} the effect of the characteristic flow time on the ignition delay. For each condition, a simulation without heat release is also performed. The ignition delay determined with and without heat release is shown to be almost identical up to the point of ignition for all of the turbulence intensities tested, and the predicted ignition delays agree well within a consistent error band. It is also observed that the ignition kernel always occurs where hydrogen is focused, and the peak concentration of HO{sub 2 } is aligned well with the scalar dissipation rate. The dependence of the ignition delay on turbulence intensity is found to be nonmonotonic. For weak to moderate turbulence the ignition is facilitated by turbulence via enhanced mixing, while for stronger turbulence, whose timescale is substantially smaller than the ignition delay, the <b>ignition</b> is <b>retarded</b> due to excessive scalar dissipation, and hence diffusive loss, at the ignition location.

40|$|The {{auto-ignition}} {{quality of}} diesel fuels, quantified by their cetane number or derived cetane number (DCN), {{is a critical}} design property to consider when producing and upgrading synthetic paraffinic fuels. It {{is well known that}} auto-ignition characteristics of paraffinic fuels depend on their degree of methyl substitution. However, there remains a need to study the governing chemical functionalities contributing to such ignition characteristics, {{especially in the case of}} methyl substitutions, which have not been studied in detail. In this work, the auto-ignition of 2, 6, 10 -trimethyltridecane has been compared with the reference hydrocarbons used for cetane number determination, i. e. n-hexadecane and heptamethylnonane, all of them being C 16 isomers. Results from a constant-volume combustion chamber under different pressure and temperature initial conditions showed that the ignition delay time for both cool flame and main combustion events increased less from n-hexadecane to trimethyltridecane than from trimethyltridecane to heptamethylnonane. Additional experimental results from blends of these hydrocarbons, together with kinetic modelling, showed that auto-ignition times and combustion rates were correlated to the concentration of the functional groups indicative of methyl substitution, although not in a linear manner. When the concentration of these functional groups decreased, the first stage OH radical concentration increased and ignition delay times decreased, whereas when their concentration increased, H 2 O 2 production was slower and <b>ignition</b> was <b>retarded.</b> Contrary to the ignition delay times, DCN was correlated linearly with functional groups, thus homogenizing the range of values and clarifying the differences between fuels...|$|R
40|$|Increasingly {{stringent}} {{regulations and}} rising fuel costs require that automotive manufacturers reduce their fleet CO 2 emissions. Gasoline engine downsizing {{is one such}} technology {{at the forefront of}} improvements in fuel economy. As engine downsizing becomes more aggressive, normal engine operating points are moving into higher load regions, typically requiring over-fuelling to maintain exhaust gas temperatures within component protection limits and <b>retarded</b> <b>ignition</b> timings in order to mitigate knock and pre-ignition events. These two mechanisms are counterproductive, since the <b>retarded</b> <b>ignition</b> timing delays combustion, in turn raising exhaust gas temperature. A key process being used to inhibit the occurrence of these knock and pre-ignition phenomena is cooled exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). Cooled EGR lowers temperatures during the combustion process, reducing the possibility of knock, and can thus reduce or eliminate the need for over-fuelling. It has also been shown to reduce exhaust gas temperature and improve combustion efficiency through improved combustion phasing. This paper reviews data collected on ‘ULTRABOOST’, a collaborative research project which is co-funded by the Technology Strategy Board, the UK's innovation agency. The project is based on a prototype, heavily downsized 2. 0 L DISI engine running under controlled boost conditions, featuring low pressure or ‘long route’ EGR.

40|$|Autoignition of an {{initially}} quiescent stratified {{layer of}} n-heptane and air is numerically studied using multistep kinetic mechanisms. The {{influence of the}} level of stratification on the ignition characteristics of the mixture is investigated. The pressure and temperature conditions selected are relevant to compression-ignited internal combustion engines. As previously reported, for uniform temperature conditions, ignition always occurs in fuel-rich regions whereas the stable flame is located at the stoichiometric mixture condition, i. e. there is a spatial offset between the initial location and the final stabilization location of the flame. The time in which the final stabilization location is reached, once ignition initiates, is dependent on the level of mixture stratification. Consider the Damköhler number (Da) defined as the product of the inverse of scalar dissipation rate and the inverse of the chemical reaction time scale. In the presence of small gradients in the flow field, i. e. below a critical level of mixture stratification, the Da exceeds a critical value and the response of the ignition to changes in mixture stratification is controlled by the ratio of the offset distance to a diffusion length scale. In this high Da limit, an increase in gradients reduces the time required to reach the stable flame condition. Above the critical level of mixture stratification, when the Da is below the critical value, losses of species and heat from the ignition location become significant, and <b>ignition</b> is <b>retarded</b> with increasing gradients in the flow field. In a two-stage ignition event, the influence of the stratification is primarily reflected in the second stage of ignition. Saumyadip Mukhopadhyay, John Abraha...|$|R

40|$|The {{cold start}} {{catalyst}} warm-up operation {{is seen as}} one of the most important modes in Direct Injection Spark Ignition (DISI) Engine operation. When the catalyst is cold the engine out emissions become the tailpipe out emissions, so it is vital for the catalyst to obtain its working temperature as quickly as possible. A very high exhaust temperature can be achieved with a very <b>retarded</b> <b>ignition</b> - the engine can be made to operate at no load with a close to wide open throttle. With a <b>retarded</b> <b>ignition,</b> a split injection strategy has been shown to improve combustion stability which is critical for the trade-off between tailpipe emissions and vehicle idle stability. The spray guided DISI engine has a multi- hole injector centrally located in the chamber with the spark plug. For catalyst heating operation, the first injection occurs during induction, which forms a relatively well mixed but lean mixture in the cylinder before ignition, and the second injection occurs close to a <b>retarded</b> <b>ignition,</b> which produces a stratified fuel rich mixture in the central region of the combustion chamber near the spark plug. Combustion initialization is found to be sensitive to spark plug protrusion and orientation, injector orientation and 2 nd injection timing relative to ignition. High tension current and voltage measurements have been taken in order to characterize the effect of the 2 nd injection timing on both the breakdown and the glow phase of the arc discharge. Both phases are shown to be influenced by the timing of the 2 nd injection. The richer mixture causes the breakdown voltage to increases while the airflow entrained in the 2 nd injection has been shown to stretch the spark and in the worst case extinguish it prematurely. In-cylinder spray imaging by Mie scattering has been taken with frame rates up to 6000 fps, with high speed video photography of chemiluminescence and soot thermal radiation. Tests have studied the effect of the spark plug orientation and injector orientation, with timing sweeps for the phasing of the second injection. The images show interaction of a fuel jet with the earth electrode, stretching of the arc, variable location for the start of combustion and significant cycle-by-cycle variations with the same operating point leading to normal combustion, slow combustion and misfiring cycles. Spectroscopic measurements have confirmed the presence of OH *, CH * and C 2 *; emissions lines, and their relative magnitude compared to soot radiation. Filtering for CH * has been used with a photo-multiplier tube. These signals show the arc discharge, the delay between the arc and the kernel growth and (depending on the timing of the 2 nd injection) small kernels which do not subsequently fully develop and can cause misfiring cycles. Unburned hydrocarbon emissions have been measured with a fast-response FID, so that emissions can be related to: misfiring cycles, slow burning cycles (0 < GMEP < 0. 5), and normal cycles. These measurements show that only the misfiring cycles lead to significant unburnt hydrocarbon emissions. The misfire mechanism depends on the timing of the 2 nd injection. When the 2 nd injection ends at the spark, no kernel is seen for a misfiring cycle. However, a kernel is shown to grow in the lean background mixture indicating that the misfire mechanism, when the 2 nd injection ends close to the spark, is that the local air/fuel ratio is too rich for the onset of combustion. However, when the 2 nd injection is significantly retarded from the spark a different misfire mechanism is present. A small kernel is shown to exist between the spark and the arrival of the fuel from the 2 nd injection. For the misfiring cycle, this kernel is extinguished early, possibly due to an interaction between the kernel and the 2 nd injection. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
