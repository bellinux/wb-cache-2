40|$|International audienceThe {{introduction}} of live insects into human food has been rare in developed countries. This work documents, {{for the first}} time, an emerging risk that exists from <b>dried</b> <b>fruit</b> in Central Europe. Recently, massive and frequent infestation of <b>dried</b> <b>fruit</b> imported from the Mediterranean region by the mite Carpoglpyhus lactis L. (Acarina: Carpoglyphidae) has been found. In 180 analyzed samples taken from supermarkets, 13 % were contaminated; the contamination levels ranged from 0 to 660 mites per g of <b>dried</b> <b>fruit.</b> The contamination was found in dried apricots, figs, plums and raisins. To estimate the risks and food preferences of C. lactis, its growth rate was examined under laboratory conditions. Starting with a hypothetical population of 10 mites per g of <b>dried</b> <b>fruit,</b> the risk level of 1, 000 mites per g of <b>dried</b> <b>fruit</b> is reached at 42 days for dried figs, 49 days for dried pineapple and 63 days for dried apricots, dates and plums at 25 ºC and 85 % of relative humidity following exposures of 21 days. The experiment found that mites are able to enter to every <b>dried</b> <b>fruit</b> packing material tested, including polypropylene and aluminum foils. This indicates that mites can disperse from package to package in supermarkets. Mites are known as allergen producers and vectors of mycotoxin-producing fungi. These findings indicate that {{an increased risk of}} C. lactis contamination exists in <b>dried</b> <b>fruit...</b>|$|R

25|$|The Feria de la Alegría y el Olivo (“Alegria” and Olive Fair) {{has been}} an annual event since the 1970s in Santiago Tulyehualco.

25|$|Mannitol {{increases}} {{blood glucose}} {{to a lesser}} extent than sucrose (thus having a relatively low glycemic index) so is used as a sweetener for people with diabetes, and in chewing gums. Although mannitol has a higher heat of solution than most sugar alcohols, its comparatively low solubility reduces the cooling effect usually found in mint candies and gums. However, when mannitol is completely dissolved in a product, it induces a strong cooling effect. Also, it has a very low hygroscopicity – it does not pick up water from the air until the humidity level is 98%. This makes mannitol very useful as a coating for hard candies, <b>dried</b> <b>fruits,</b> and chewing gums, and it is often included as an ingredient in candies and chewing gum. The pleasant taste and mouthfeel of mannitol also makes it a popular excipient for chewable tablets.|$|E
