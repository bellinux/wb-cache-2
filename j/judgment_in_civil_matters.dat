The thesis {{focuses on the}} analysis of the problems that its name suggests. The procedural rules of private international law underwent during the past fifteen years relatively significant changes. Due to the application of the principles of free movement of persons, capital, goods and services, it results necessary to develop effective instruments for performing the law accross the member states borders. It occurs in procedural area primarily through the adoption of instruments of the European secondary legislation, particularly through regulation.

Amongst other matters, the Regulation updates existing jurisdiction rules for a consumer contracts. The rules for consumer contracts apply where a consumer and a business are domiciled in a Member State or the business has a:“branch, agency or other establishment” in a Member State. Importantly, the Regulation clarifies jurisdiction rules for consumer contracts conducted over the World Wide Web (WWW). These rules are to be welcomed, as they provide guidance on what rules of jurisdiction apply to consumer contracts over the Web, albeit that they are limited to where the parties are domiciled in Europe. This article outlines the rules of jurisdiction for consumer contracts provided by the Regulation, and where appropriate, highlights some aspects of the new rules that will possibly require further discussion and clarification by the European Court of Justice once the new rules are in force...|$|R

The term domicile, employed as the most important connecting factor for the determination of jurisdiction under the Brussels I Regulation, is the key word thereof. Domicile as such is a very interesting, although complicated, legal concept. This holds true even in the case of domicile for the purposes of Brussels I Regulation. At the European level, the tradition of domicile, being the connecting factor in most cases of the determination of jurisdiction, was established by the Brussels Convention. Nevertheless, it did not provide for a uniform definition. Instead, it referred to the national laws of the then contracting states. By adopting, with an exception, a uniform definition of a legal person's domicile, the Brussels I Regulation has partially deviated from this practice. However, as regards the natural person's domicile, the reference to the national laws of the European Union Member States was upheld. As the understanding of this concept differs from [...] ...|$|R
