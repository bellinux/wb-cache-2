50|$|Dark Adaptation Threshold (DAT) is {{a vision}} test that {{measures}} the adjustment {{of the eye}} occurring under low levels of illumination. When light enters the eye, it ultimately reaches the rods and cones, which {{are two types of}} cells in the retina. Rods handle vision in low light conditions and cones handle color vision and detail. The rods and cones each react differently during the <b>DAT</b> <b>test,</b> and are measured on a graph. The test determines the threshold, or minimum light intensity required to produce a visual sensation in the child's eye. In order to perform this test, the child is asked to sit in the dark for a half-hour. This allows the eyes to be most sensitive for the test. Once the eyes have fully adapted, the child stands in front of a black projection screen. Dim spots of light are projected onto the screen, one at a time, on either the right or the left side. The spots get dimmer as the test goes on. The child is asked to point to the spots until he or she can no longer distinguish them. In order to keep the child's attention on the screen, sometimes the doctor will wave a brighter light on the screen to hold the child's interest when the test becomes harder to see. When an infant is being tested, an observer with a night vision camera records the head and eye movements of the child as they look at the spots. Once the patient can no longer see the spots, the dark adapted threshold is determined. The <b>DAT</b> <b>test</b> lasts for about 10 to 15 minutes.|$|E

40|$|Introduction & Objective: Visceral {{leishmaniasis}} (Kala-azar) is {{a disease}} caused by intracellular protozoa parasites of the genus Leishmania. Kala–azar in Iran is usually seen in children below 10 years old. Kala-azar is endemic {{in some areas of}} Iran including Ardebil, Fars, and East Azerbaijan. The present study was designed to assess the situation of Kala–azar in children of ten and below ten years in Boyer Ahmad township in Kohgiloyeh and Boyer Ahmad province in 1384. Materials & Methods: Blood samples were collected from all the children of 10 and less than 10 years old. In this survey 1628 blood samples were collected from finger tip of children on filter paper. Collected samples were evaluated by direct agglutination test (DAT). Collected data were analyzed by SPSS software. Results: Result of this study showed that from 1628 samples collected, 50 cases (3. 07 percent) were become positive with <b>DAT</b> <b>test.</b> Infection in females was less than male.

This {{research}} project aims {{to establish the}} predictive validity {{of a set of}} aptitude tests for the first year Biosciences programme at a merging South African University. The study aims {{to address the problem of}} selection and placement to higher education and also to suggest how the results of aptitude tests might be used to inform curriculum development at first year level. The Differential Aptitude Test (DAT-L) was conducted on the 2004 Biosciences student cohort (228 students). The instructions that were given to the students followed the instructions laid out in Owen and Vosloo (1999). Normally there are ten tests in this battery of tests, however only eight of the tests were given to the students. The tests included; Vocabulary, Verbal reasoning, Non-Verbal reasoning: Figures, Calculations, Reading Comprehension, Comparisons, Price Controlling and Memory. Exam results of the participating students were collected. These included; Final Biosciences 101 mark, Class mark (Biosciences 101), Practical exam mark (Biosciences 101) and Theory exam mark (Biosciences 101). The final marks for Physics (mixed modules), Mathematics (mixed modules) Computer Sciences (CSCI 103) and Chemistry (CHEM 131) were also collected. The indicator for the concept of academic potential in the Biosciences was taken as the marks achieved during the course of the first semester. Biographical information from the Student Management System (SMS) was also recorded this included; Race, Gender, Home language and Matric points. These various categories were compared against the students' performance in DAT-L tests. The average for the stanine points for a student of university "quality' is seven, according to Owen et al. (2000), while the average of this cohort of students is 5. 16. The correlation for the different <b>DAT</b> <b>tests</b> when compared with the final result for Biosciences shows that the best correlation is with test 1 at r =. 47292 (Vocabulary) while the worst correlation is with test 6 at r=. 24722 (Comparison). The sequence of correlation is from Vocabulary through Reading Comprehension, Verbal Reasoning, Calculation, Memory, Price Controlling, Non-Verbal Reasoning: Figures, and finally Comparisons. The correlation of the average of all tests and the final result is a reasonable r =. 50396. The best correlation with DAT and other subjects is Computer Science with r =. 41165, with a declining correlation between Physics and the mark of r =. 34085 followed by extremely poor correlations for Chemistry and Mathematics of r =. 20313 and r =. 08700 respectively. The best correlation that was obtained during this research was with the correlation between matric points and the average of all the <b>DAT</b> <b>tests.</b> While the correlation with DAT and the Final mark for Biosciences is r =. 50396 that for the matric points is r =. 57150. Females attained a significantly higher average on the <b>DAT</b> <b>tests</b> but the difference between female and male on their final results in Biosciences is not significant. White students perform significantly better than the other race designations when it comes to the final result. Within the categories African, Indian and Coloured there is no significant difference. When it comes to the different <b>DAT</b> <b>tests,</b> Africans perform significantly worse than the other three groupings and the Indian grouping did significantly worse when compared to Whites. If we were to use the DAT as a means of selecting students it would be fairly effective for biology but not for the other basic science subjects. The fact that the test would have to be administered to all applicants applying to do first year in the Science and Agriculture Faculty makes the choice of this set of tests questionable. Should the Faculty require a means of determining election into biological subjects then the tests show great promise.

A specific aim was to determine if having a medical degree is a predictive factor for dental students ’ scores on the Austrian Dental Admission Test (Austrian DAT), performance in the dental clinic, and scores on final exam. The study consisted of a retrospective analysis of 122 students (thirty-nine with a medical degree and eighty-three without a medical degree) who were enrolled in the Dental Clinic at Innsbruck Medical University, Innsbruck, Austria, between 2001 and 2006. Three perfor-mance categories were considered: Austrian DAT results, clinical performance after the first clinical year in dental school, and performance on the final dental licensure examination. Information on students ’ age, gender, and previous medical degree was collected from official records. Analyses with student’s t-test and Pearson’s chi-square test revealed that the students with a medi-cal degree had significantly higher Austrian DAT total test scores, grade point averages after the first clinical year, and scores on the final exam. Additionally, those students had significantly better performance on the final exam in prosthodontics and oral and maxillofacial surgery.

Evidence suggests that visceral leishmaniasis is prevalent {{in some areas}} of Mazandaran and Golestan provinces. This study aimed to investigate the cases and also determining the causative agents of VL in these provinces. In this study, seven VL patients (mean age 1. 5 years) admitted to the pediatric departments in Sari Booali Sina and Gorgan Taleghani hospitals, 2013 – 2016, were examined. The most common clinical and laboratory findings included prolonged fever, hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, pancytopenia, and hypergammaglobulinemia. Blood and bone marrow (B. M) samples were taken. Direct agglutination <b>test</b> (<b>DAT)</b> and rapid rK 39 strip test were used as serologic tests and B. M microscopic slides were checked by species-specific PCR to identify the parasite species. All patients had positive rK 39 and <b>DAT</b> <b>tests.</b> Examination of bone marrow smears demonstrated amastigotes of Leishmania (Leishman bodies) in the samples. The species of Leishmania in all B. M smears was Leishmania infantum. According to the identification of L. infantum as the major agent of VL in Mazandaran and Golestan provinces, increasing physician awareness (especially pediatric specialists) of the disease and conducting control programs in these areas are recommended. © 2016, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences.

Both cognitive deficits and gender have been associated with the development of tardive dyskinesia. the aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the effects of reserpine administration on the development of orofacial dyskinesia and on plus-maze discriminative avoidance task (DAT-an animal model of associative learning) in male and female mice. Male and female mice received 1. 0 mg/kg reserpine or saline subcutaneously on day 1. On days 3, 6 and 8, the frequency of vacuous chewing movements (VCM) was quantified. On day 6, the DAT conditioning was performed, in a modified elevated plus-maze. in one of the enclosed arms, the animals received aversive stimulation (light and noise). On day 8, a test session was performed and the time spent by the animals in each of the enclosed arms was recorded. Our results showed that reserpine-treated male and female mice presented significantly higher VCM when compared with respective control groups in all observation days. On day 6, reserpine-treated female mice presented significantly higher VCM when compared with male mice injected with this drug. the <b>DAT</b> <b>test</b> performed on day 8 showed that the time spent in the aversive arm by saline-treated mice was significantly lower than the time spent in the non-aversive arm. This difference was not observed for reserpine-treated mice. Our results demonstrate the development of reserpine-induced oral dyskinesia in both male and female mice. While this oral dyskinesia is accompanied by a cognitive deficit in both genders, female mice tended to have more severe oral dyskinesia.

50|$|The K39 {{dipstick}} test {{is easy to}} perform, {{and village}} health workers can be easily trained to use it. The kit may be stored at ambient temperature and no additional equipment needs to be carried to remote areas. The <b>DAT</b> anti-leishmania antigen <b>test,</b> standard within MSF, is much more cumbersome to use and appears {{not to have any}} advantages over the K39 test.|$|R
50|$|Rho(D) immune {{globulin}} {{is composed}} of IgG antibodies and therefore is able to cross the placenta. In rare cases this can cause a baby to have a weakly positive <b>DAT</b> (direct antiglobulin <b>test)</b> due to sensitization of fetal cells from mothers who have received multiple doses of Rho(D) immune globulin. However, no treatment is necessary as the clinical course is benign.|$|R
40|$|A case of hyperhemolysis in a 2 -year-old {{boy with}} &# 946; {{thalassemia}} major was noted. After several transfusions, he developed hyperhemolysis {{with a positive}} (C 3 d only) direct antiglobulin <b>test</b> (<b>DAT)</b> and no clinically significant RBC allo- or auto-antibodies.

40|$|Hyperthermia exacerbates and {{hypothermia}} attenuates methamphetamine (METH) -induced dopamine (DA) neurotoxicity. The mechanisms underlying these temperature {{effects are}} unknown. Given the essential {{role of the}} DA transporter (DAT) in the expression of METH-induced DA neurotoxicity, we hypothesized {{that the effect of}} temperature on METH-induced DA neurotoxicity is mediated, at least in part, {{at the level of the}} <b>DAT.</b> To <b>test</b> this hypothesis, the effects of small, physiologically relevant temperature changes on DAT function were evaluated in two types of cultured neuronal cells: (1) a neuroblastoma cell line stably transfected with human DAT cDNA and (2) rat embryonic mesencephalic primary cells that naturally express the DAT. Temperatures for studies of DAT function were selected based on core temperature measurements in animals exposed to METH under usual ambient (22 °C) and hypothermic (6 °C) temperature conditions...|$|R
40|$|Background: Visceral {{leishmaniasis}} (VL) {{as one of}} {{the most}} important human parasitic disease is endemic in some parts of Iran. Several cases of VL have been reported recently in the Ilam Province. The current study aimed to assess the pre-sent status of human VL in the region. Methods: A random cluster sampling method was used to collect 456 serums samples from the children up to 12 years of age and 10 % of adults living in urban and rural areas of the province. All the collected serum samples were tested by di-rect agglutination <b>test</b> (<b>DAT)</b> to detect anti- Leishmania infantum antibodies. Results: Of the examined 456 serum samples with direct agglutination <b>test</b> (<b>DAT),</b> only 21 (0. 43 %) sera showed anti- Leishmania antibodies at titers 1 : 400 and higher. Distribution of anti- Leishmania antibodies titers were: 1 : 400 (n= 4), 1 : 800 (n= 11), 1 : 1600 (n= 3), 1 : 3200 (n= 1), and 1 : 6400 (n= 1). Individuals with titers ≥ 1 : 3200 showed clinical signs and symptoms such as fever and splenomegaly. The highest and lowest seropositivity were observed in the age groups of 5 – 9 and> 15 year...|$|R

40|$|Leishmania (Kinetoplastida: Trypanosomatidae) are {{protozoan}} parasites {{of significant}} medical and veterinary importance. Over the last decade, visceral leishmaniasis (VL) {{has emerged as}} a major opportunistic infection associated with HIV/AIDS in North Western Ethiopia. This paper reports on serological evidence of possible Leishmania donovani (L. donovani) infection in dogs using two serological tests: direct agglutination <b>test</b> (<b>DAT)</b> and Kalazar detect rapid test (KDRT). Two hundred and seventeen asymptomatic local breed dogs were examined for L. donovani antibodies. Performance of the DAT and KDRT was assessed in 162 matching samples of blood collected on filter paper and serum, respectively. Using <b>DAT</b> and KDRT <b>testing</b> in parallel, the overall seroprevalence of L. donovani infection was 27. 7 % and 14. 8 %, respectively. The degree of agreement was found to be fair (68. 8 %, k = 0. 234). Univariable logistic regression analysis of some risk factors for L. donovani infection in dogs using DAT indicates that place of residence, sex, age, dog keeping purpose and dog housing condition were not significantly associated with seropositivity. The high proportion of positive dogs suggests the exposure of these animals to L. donovani infection and needs further investigation. Isolation and typing of the parasite aiming at confirming the role of these animals in maintenance and transmission of kala-azar is advocate...|$|R
30|$|Patients {{and methods}} Patients with AIHA {{admitted}} to the ICU of Saint Louis University Hospital between years 2002 and 2015 were retrospectively identified using a computerized database. Clinical and biological data including past medical history, etiologic diagnosis, type of direct antiglobulin <b>test</b> (<b>DAT),</b> organ failures, treatments and follow-up were abstracted from the patients’ charts. Primary outcome was ICU mortality. Data are presented as numbers (%) or medians (interquartile range). Survivors (S) and decedents (D) were compared using Chi squared test for binary variables and Mann–Whitney test for continuous variables.|$|R
