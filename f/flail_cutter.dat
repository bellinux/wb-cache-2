5000|$|An {{alternative}} to hedge laying is trimming using a tractor-mounted <b>flail</b> <b>cutter</b> or circular saw, or a hedge trimmer [...] The {{height of the}} cutting can be increased a little every year. Trimming a hedge helps to promote bushy growth. If a <b>flail</b> <b>cutter</b> is used, then the flail must be kept sharp {{to ensure that the}} cutting is effective on the hedge. The disadvantage of this is that the hedge species takes a number of years before it will flower again and subsequently bear fruit for wildlife and people. If the hedge is trimmed repeatedly at the same height, a 'hard knuckle' will start to form at that height - similar to the shape of a pollarded tree.|$|E

These machines can only be used in certain terrains, and are expensive to operate. In most situations they are also not 100% reliable, and the work needs to be checked by other techniques.|$|R
