25|$|In 1864, Hubbard {{became an}} Anglican deaconess and became {{active in the}} deaconess {{movement}} after a friend introduced her to the society. The movement, which had been present in the Anglican church since 1850, focused on providing community life for women and training them work with the poor as nurses or teachers. She began serving with the society and organized a number of gatherings. In 1871, she published a pamphlet entitled Anglican Deaconesses; or <b>Is</b> <b>There</b> <b>No</b> Place for Women in the Parochial System? This work contained descriptions of meetings that she had with church leaders, including Harold Browne. She also met with potential donors {{to tell them about}} the movement. She also published a letter in John Bull detailing the aims of the movement. However, she later became discouraged by the slow pace of growth that came to characterise the movement. She ceased active involvement with the group in 1874.|$|E

500|$|In 1856, Marochetti had {{the statue}} cast in bronze at the {{workshop}} {{that he had}} established in the early 1850s in Sydney Mews, off Fulham Road. The casting and the statue's gifting to {{the nation in the}} summer of 1856 made the question of its location all the more essential to resolve. Other sites were considered, including outside Buckingham Palace, Carlton Gardens near the Horse Guards and even on top of Marble Arch. Prince Albert himself suggested locating it outside the west entrance of Westminster Abbey, looking down the newly created Victoria Street.

500|$|Despite these {{diplomatic}} manoeuvrings, {{according to}} a series of letters of Innocent III dated to autumn 1210, Michael engaged in combat with the Prince of Achaea Geoffrey I of Villehardouin (r. 1209–1229) and his barons; the letters do not give any further details. Modern researchers have linked this reference either with his supposed leadership in the battle of Kountouras, or, more plausibly, with an abortive campaign in the Peloponnese sometime in 1207–09 in order to aid the beleaguered ruler of Argos and Corinth, Leo Sgouros, who was being besieged by the Crusaders in his citadel on the Acrocorinth. Traditionally, several scholars, such as Karl Hopf and Antoine Bon, have furthermore identified a certain Theodore, who appears as [...] "lord of Argos" [...] and Sgouros' successor in leading the resistance against the Crusaders, with Michael's half-brother Theodore Komnenos Doukas. Loenertz points out, however, that not only <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>no</b> evidence for such an assumption, but that Theodore Komnenos Doukas is known to have been {{in the service of the}} Nicaean emperor, Theodore I Laskaris (r. 1205–1222), at the time.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{mention of}} any {{tensions}} between Jane {{and her husband}} came long after their deaths, when George Wyatt called her [...] "wicked wife, accuser of her own husband, even to the seeking of his own blood," [...] in his biography of [...] Queen Anne, but this view would have been informed by the disastrous Katherine Howard episode, where both she and the queen were executed for treason, and Wyatt's own attempts to exonerate the late Queen. Subsequent generations of historians also believed that Jane's testimony against her husband and sister-in-law in 1536 was motivated by spite rather than any actual belief in their guilt, hence her generally unfavourable historical reputation. A century later, an historian asserted that the reason Jane had testified against them was based purely on her [...] "inveterate hatred" [...] of Queen Anne, which sprang from jealousy at Anne's superior social skills and George's preference for his sister's company to his wife's. This assertion, while romantic, does not hold merit {{when looking at the}} actual records of the period; not only <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>no</b> mention of any serious rift between the couple (and the few mentions of their marriage imply at least a tolerable relationship), but by the death of Jane Seymour, Jane had already rebuilt her reputation at court and been one of the Queen's chief mourners (she would go to serve two more of Henry's queens). Georgian and Victorian histories pointed to Jane's own eventual violent death in 1542 to suggest that moral justice had triumphed because [...] "the infamous Lady Rochford... justly deserved her fate for the concern which she had in bringing Anne Boleyn, as well as her own husband, to the block". This view of Jane as accuser, despite lacking historicity, gained traction after her death, and was popularized by subsequent historians.|$|E
