For example, Paul Volcker suggested that for most people, {{the creation of the}} ATM was a greater <b>financial</b> <b>innovation</b> than asset-backed securitization.

30|$|Finally, {{evolutionary}} theory considers issues of natural selection, which {{are critical to}} <b>financial</b> <b>innovation.</b> Here, {{the question of whether}} natural selection applies to <b>financial</b> <b>innovation</b> can be explored. Several factors can influence the process of natural selection in the development of <b>financial</b> <b>innovation.</b> Bettzüge and Hens (2001), for instance, present a model in which the survival of new financial products depends on sufficiently high trading volumes, marketing, and new hedging opportunities. Johnston and McConnell (1989) find that the success and diffusion of financial securities may depend on which <b>financial</b> <b>innovation</b> has the best security design.|$|R
30|$|Given {{both the}} {{positive}} and negative effects of <b>financial</b> <b>innovation,</b> many studies have explored the positive association between <b>financial</b> <b>innovation</b> and economic growth in a host country. Sood and Ranjan (2015), for example, studied India while Qamruzzaman and Jianguo (2017) studied Bangladesh. Despite the positive associations, negative aspects have also been found in the nexus between <b>financial</b> <b>innovation</b> and economic growth. Adu-Asare Idun and Aboagye (2014) used ARDL to explore the negative association between <b>financial</b> <b>innovation</b> and economic growth in Ghana. They argued that innovative financial products negatively influenced saving propensity in Ghana, encouraging the withdrawal of savings from banks and thus creating a problem of bank liquidity. Similarly, Ansong et al. (2011) argued that excessive <b>financial</b> <b>innovation</b> adversely affected banks with diversified financial products.|$|R

30|$|For {{the long-run}} estimations (see Table 5, panel A), {{we found that}} a {{positive}} shock in <b>financial</b> <b>innovation</b> was positively linked with economic growth in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka while a negative shock was negatively linked with economic growth. This indicates that <b>financial</b> <b>innovation</b> in a <b>financial</b> system can stimulate economic growth. According to Chou (2007) and Chou and Chin (2011), <b>financial</b> <b>innovation</b> brings changes to a financial system that increase financial efficiency and increase saving propensity among the population by offering new and improved financial assets; this eventually aids capital formation and thus boosts economic growth. Mishra (2010), moreover, argued that <b>financial</b> <b>innovation</b> promotes the economic growth of emerging economies through welfare enhancement. For the short run (see Table  4, panel C), we found that a positive shock in <b>financial</b> <b>innovation</b> influenced economic growth in Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan but not Sri Lanka. Meanwhile, a negative shock in <b>financial</b> <b>innovation</b> produced mixed associations regarding {{economic growth in the}} sample countries.|$|R
30|$|Empirical {{research}} in finance has proposed four distinct hypotheses {{to explain the}} nexus between <b>financial</b> <b>innovation</b> and economic growth. First, the supply-leading hypothesis suggests that <b>financial</b> <b>innovation</b> can positively affect a country’s economic growth (Beck 2010). This hypothesis suggests that <b>financial</b> <b>innovation</b> in a <b>financial</b> system accelerates economic growth by expediting the process of capital accumulation, enhancing efficiency in financial institutions, improving financial services, and making financial intermediation more efficient. Shittu (2012) found that efficient financial intermediation significantly influenced economic growth in Nigeria. Second, the demand-leading hypothesis suggests that economic growth attracts <b>financial</b> <b>innovation</b> in an economy. This hypothesis suggests that the expansion of economic activities, real sector development, and increased domestic and international trade place pressure on financial systems to improve payment mechanisms, make financial institutions more efficient, and diversify financial assets to reduce investment risks. Third, the feedback hypothesis suggests bidirectional causality between <b>financial</b> <b>innovation</b> and economic growth. Bara and Mudxingiri (2016) and Bara et al. (2016), for example, confirmed bidirectional causality between <b>financial</b> <b>innovation</b> and economic growth. Lumpkin (2010) and Sekhar (2013), however, found no causality between <b>financial</b> <b>innovation</b> and economic growth.|$|R

30|$|We {{recommend}} policymakers {{encourage a}} positive relationship between <b>financial</b> <b>innovation</b> and economic growth. First, the government should encourage a competitive financial environment with greater interactions by including both formal and informal financial institutions in the financial system. Second, the appropriate initiatives should be undertaken to merge and adopt new financial assets, services, and payment mechanisms for efficient financial development with <b>financial</b> <b>innovation.</b> <b>Financial</b> <b>innovation</b> in the economy not only causes economic growth but also promotes the financial development of the country, as well. An efficient financial system is a driver for economic growth (Ram 2007). In order to support <b>financial</b> <b>innovation,</b> the government and private sector should participate in supporting and formulating financial policy {{in such a way that}} <b>financial</b> <b>innovation</b> can be developed at its own pace.|$|R

30|$|The NARDL {{findings}} also support {{the existence of}} long-run relationships. They also reject the null hypothesis regarding the nonexistence of an asymmetric relationship between <b>financial</b> <b>innovation</b> and economic growth, both {{in the short run}} and the long run. Thus, we can infer an asymmetric relationship between <b>financial</b> <b>innovation</b> and economic growth. In addition, we observed positive changes in <b>financial</b> <b>innovation</b> positively linked in both the long run and short run. These findings suggest that any improvement in <b>financial</b> <b>innovation</b> can bring about positive changes in the economy. However, negative changes in <b>financial</b> <b>innovation</b> were adversely linked with economic growth.

40|$|Everybody {{talks about}} <b>financial</b> <b>innovation,</b> but (almost) nobody empirically tests {{hypotheses}} about it. ” Frame and White (2004) The financial turmoil from 2007 onwards has spurred renewed debates on the “bright” and “dark ” sides of <b>financial</b> <b>innovation.</b> Using bank-, industry- and country-level data for 32, mostly high-income, countries between 1996 and 2006, {{this paper is}} the first to explicitly assess the relationship between <b>financial</b> <b>innovation</b> in the banking sector and (i) real sector growth, (ii) real sector volatility, and (iii) bank fragility. We find evidence for both bright and dark sides of <b>financial</b> <b>innovation.</b> On the one hand, we find that a higher level of <b>financial</b> <b>innovation</b> is associated with a stronger relationship between a country’s growth opportunities and capital and GDP per capita growth and with higher growth rates in industries that rely more on external financing and depend more on innovation.
