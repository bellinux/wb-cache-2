40|$|The paper {{presents}} mathematical {{relationships that}} allow us to forecast the estimated main <b>engine</b> <b>power</b> of new container ships, based on data concerning vessels built in 2005 - 2015. The presented approximations allow us to estimate the <b>engine</b> <b>power</b> based on the length between perpendiculars and the number of containers the ship will carry. The approximations were developed using simple linear regression and multivariate linear regression analysis. The presented relations have practical application for estimation of container ship <b>engine</b> <b>power</b> needed in preliminary parametric design of the ship. It follows from the above that the use of multiple linear regression to predict the main <b>engine</b> <b>power</b> of a container ship brings more accurate solutions than simple linear regression...|$|R

5|$|Hydrogen was {{liquefied}} for {{the first}} time by James Dewar in 1898 by using regenerative cooling and his invention, the vacuum flask. He produced solid hydrogen the next year. Deuterium was discovered in December 1931 by Harold Urey, and tritium was prepared in 1934 by Ernest Rutherford, Mark Oliphant, and Paul Harteck. Heavy water, which consists of deuterium in the place of regular hydrogen, was discovered by Urey's group in 1932. François Isaac de Rivaz built the first de Rivaz engine, an internal combustion <b>engine</b> <b>powered</b> by a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen in 1806. Edward Daniel Clarke invented the hydrogen gas blowpipe in 1819. The Döbereiner's lamp and limelight were invented in 1823.|$|E
5|$|In 1897, Frank Shuman, a U.S. inventor, {{engineer}} and solar energy pioneer, built a small demonstration solar engine that worked by reflecting solar energy onto square boxes filled with ether, {{which has a}} lower boiling point than water, and were fitted internally with black pipes which in turn powered a steam engine. In 1908 Shuman formed the Sun Power Company {{with the intent of}} building larger solar power plants. He, along with his technical advisor A.S.E. Ackermann and British physicist Sir Charles Vernon Boys, developed an improved system using mirrors to reflect solar energy upon collector boxes, increasing heating capacity to the extent that water could now be used instead of ether. Shuman then constructed a full-scale steam <b>engine</b> <b>powered</b> by low-pressure water, enabling him to patent the entire solar engine system by 1912.|$|E

40|$|Nebraska law {{requires}} the Nebraska Tractor Test Board of Engineers to compare {{results of the}} tests of an agricultural tractor model with the manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s claims regarding power, fuel use, and other performance ratings in order to recommend a permit to sell that tractor model in the state. PTO tests are conducted to verify the manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s PTO power and fuel claims for tractor models. In recent years, several tractor manufacturers have been producing models of large tractors either without a PTO or with a PTO not capable of transmitting the full <b>engine</b> <b>power</b> and, therefore, have chosen to advertise <b>engine</b> <b>power.</b> The objective of this project was to determine a reasonable alternative to removing engines from these tractors for tests to determine whether these tractors met their power claims. Linear regression analyses of advertised <b>engine</b> <b>power</b> claims and OECD Code 2 drawbar power test results from 48 tracked (R 2 = 0. 98) and 43 4 WD tractors (R 2 = 0. 99) were used to establish two linear relationships to verify the <b>engine</b> <b>power</b> claims for these tractors.

25|$|Today, most general {{aviation}} piston <b>engine</b> <b>powered</b> aircraft are naturally aspirated. Modern aviation piston engines designed {{to run at}} high altitudes typically include a turbocharger (either high pressure or turbonormalized) rather than a supercharger. The change in thinking {{is largely due to}} economics. Aviation gasoline was once plentiful and cheap, favoring the simple, but fuel-hungry supercharger. As the cost of fuel has increased, the supercharger has fallen out of favor.|$|E

25|$|Early experimenters used gases. In 1806, Swiss {{engineer}} François Isaac de Rivaz {{built an}} <b>engine</b> <b>powered</b> by internal combustion of a {{hydrogen and oxygen}} mixture. In 1826, Englishman Samuel Brown tested his hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engine by using it to propel a vehicle up Shooter's Hill in south-east London. Belgian-born Etienne Lenoir's Hippomobile with a hydrogen-gas-fuelled one-cylinder internal combustion engine made a test drive from Paris to Joinville-le-Pont in 1860, covering some nine kilometres in about three hours. A later version was propelled by coal gas. A Delamare-Deboutteville vehicle was patented and trialled in 1884.|$|E

25|$|The lack of {{a gearbox}} and the {{simplified}} rotor coupling to the aircraft meant that the design could employ a tilting rotor hub, and did not need drag hinges. The low torque coupling at the mast meant that very little was needed {{in the form of}} lateral control. The P.74 rotor was expected to be quieter in operation than tip jets, following tests with a Derwent <b>engine</b> <b>powered</b> rotor. The stainless-steel rotors were thick in cross section to accommodate the necessary ducting to the tips. They also were non-feathering, so ailerons were fitted to the blades.|$|E
25|$|The {{octagonal}} {{brick and}} terracotta chimney {{of the engine}} house dates from 1888, and is grade II* listed, as is the hydraulic engine house itself. It replaced the original pumping house which is now The Pump House public house. It is built of red brick with a slate roof and originally contained two steam <b>engine</b> <b>powered</b> pumps. These were replaced in 1907 by the current electrically powered machines from Fullerton, Hodgart and Barclay of Paisley (the currently installed electric motors were manufactured by JH Holmes & Co, Hebburn-upon-Tyne and so date at least from 1928). It powered the docks hydraulic system of cranes, bridges and locks.|$|E
25|$|The 8C engine, {{first entered}} at the 1931 Mille Miglia road race through Italy, had a common crankcase, now with two alloy four-cylinder blocks, which also {{incorporated}} the heads.

As far as production cars are concerned, the 8C <b>engine</b> <b>powered</b> two models, the 8C 2300 (1931–1935) and the even more rare and expensive 8C 2900 (1936–1941), bore increased to 68mm and stroke to 100mm (2,905cc).|$|E
