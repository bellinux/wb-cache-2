5|$|A priori, it is {{not clear}} whether the new local <b>frames</b> in free fall {{coincide}} with the reference <b>frames</b> in which the laws of special relativity hold—that theory is based on the propagation of light, and thus on electromagnetism, which could have a different set of preferred <b>frames.</b> But using different assumptions about the special-relativistic <b>frames</b> (such as their being earth-fixed, or in free fall), one can derive different predictions for the gravitational redshift, that is, the way in which the frequency of light shifts as the light propagates through a gravitational field (cf. below). The actual measurements show that free-falling <b>frames</b> are the ones in which light propagates as it does in special relativity. The generalization of this statement, namely that the laws of special relativity hold to good approximation in freely falling (and non-rotating) reference <b>frames,</b> is known as the Einstein equivalence principle, a crucial guiding principle for generalizing special-relativistic physics to include gravity.|$|E

In a tense final against {{defending}} champion Mark Selby, neither player {{was able to}} obtain a sizeable lead, with <b>frames</b> littered with both big breaks and close finishes. After leading 3–1, O'Sullivan ended the afternoon session at 4–4, and took the first frame of the evening session. Selby, however, then won the next 3 <b>frames</b> to lead 7–5. O'Sullivan responded by taking three <b>frames</b> in succession himself, to lead 8–7. The following two <b>frames</b> were shared, and at 9–8, after both players had wasted chances, O'Sullivan constructed a break of 55, beating Mark Selby 10–8 and thereby claiming the title for the fourth time. In doing this he became only the second player, after Stephen Hendry, to win the trophy more than three times. In his post-match interview, O'Sullivan proclaimed his victory, composed with a cue that he had obtained only the previous Saturday, as his greatest achievement in snooker. During an exhibition in Ireland in January 2009, O'Sullivan and Jimmy White made maximum breaks in consecutive <b>frames.</b> In {{the first round of}} the 2009 World Championship O'Sullivan compiled three centuries in his 10–5 win against Stuart Bingham.
