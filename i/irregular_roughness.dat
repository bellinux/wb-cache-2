40|$|A {{review of}} {{predictive}} {{methods used to}} determine the frictional drag on a rough surface is presented. These methods utilize a wide range of roughness scales, including roughness height, pitch, density, and shape parameters. Most of these scales were developed for regular roughness, limiting their applicability to predict the drag for many engineering flows. A new correlation is proposed to estimate the frictional drag for a surface covered with three-dimensional, <b>irregular</b> <b>roughness</b> in the fully rough regime. The correlation relies solely on a measurement of the surface roughness profile and builds on previous work utilizing moments of the surface statistics. A relationship is given for the equivalent sandgrain roughness height {{as a function of the}} root-mean-square roughness height and the skewness of the roughness probability density function. Boundary layer similarity scaling then allows the overall frictional drag coefficient to be determined as a function of the ratio of the equivalent sandgrain roughness height to length of the surface.

40|$|This study {{presents}} the results {{from a series of}} wind-tunnel experiments designed to investigate the aerodynamic roughness length z 0 of fresh snow under no-drift conditions. A two-component hot-film anemometer was employed to obtain vertical profiles of velocity statistics in a zero pressure gradient turbulent boundary layer for flow over naturally deposited snow surfaces. The roughness of these snow surfaces was measured by means of digital photography to capture characteristic length scales that can be related to z 0. Our results show that, under aerodynamically rough conditions, the mean value of the roughness length for fresh snow is [z 0] = 0. 24 z 0 = 024 mm with a standard deviation ?(z 0) = 0. 05 mm. In this study, we show that variations in z 0 are associated with variations in the roughness geometry.

Both pasting small glass spheres and sand gives regular and measurable surface roughness but they are irrelevant for the rotation of solid spherical particles because of the broking of roughened surface after a small period of time because of the liquid's resistance to the accelerated spheres motion. The chemical method gave one grade of surface roughness only and it is relevant and the surface roughness is measurable.

It has been verified that the formation of tiny lamellae is a direct consequence of the thermal treatments applied; for example, a solutioning at high temperature (> 600 °C) followed by an annealing at low temperature (> 100 °). The crucial step of the transformation seems to be the ageing at low temperature.

40|$|Turbulent flow in {{a channel}} with {{irregular}} two-dimensional rough surfaces is analysed through wall-resolving large eddy simulation (LES). Both {{walls of the}} channel are roughened through the superimposition of sinusoidal functions having random amplitude and four different wavelengths. The downward shift of the velocity profile in the log region due to the roughness, known as roughness function, is well captured in the simulations. The spanwise and wall-normal turbulence intensities are found to increase with the roughness height, while the streamwise component decreases. The analysis of the Reynolds stress anisotropy tensor highlights a tendency towards isotropisation, confirmed by the vorticity rms. The analysis of the statistics shows {{that the effects of}} the roughness on the turbulent flow are greatly related to the increase of the height of the maximum peaks of the corrugations. Although the inner layer is dramatically affected by the wall irregularities, the outer layer appears not affected by the specific wall shape and a collapse of the turbulence statistics in smooth- and rough-wall conditions is observed. Much of the present results are consistent with the observations made over regular roughness, nevertheless the turbulence structures and the turbulent kinetic energy production analysis shows that the turbulence dynamics are directly affected by the local shape of the irregularities. The spatial inhomogeneities of the height of the roughness peaks and of the cavity region locally modifies the structures introducing variable length-scales. Overall the <b>irregular</b> <b>roughness</b> destroys the coherent pattern of the flow selectively, depending on the spatial distribution of the higher roughness peaks...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} a predictive, physics-based model, i. e., the so-called tilted-mirror model (tm-model), for optical modeling of rough rear surfaces on silicon solar cells. An enhanced method of using transfer matrices at the rear-side interface of solar cells is developed and combined with Monte Carlo ray tracing. As a result, a physically consistent and precise simulation of the spectral reflectance is achieved, thus {{leading to a}} predictive quality of the simulations that could previously {{not be reached for}} solar cells with a remaining <b>irregular</b> rear-surface <b>roughness.</b> This advance in optical simulation enables the researcher to directly analyze the effects of varying rear-side passivation materials and thicknesses, as well as the impact of different surface morphologies on the gained charge-carrier generation rate of a solar cell. A comparison with the Phong model shows that the tm-model is able to simulate the generated photocurrent Jph more accurately, as it is shown that the Phong model tends to overestimate this value due to imprecise calculation of charge-carrier generation. In an application of the tm-model to passivated emitter and rear cells, it is shown that a strong planarization of the rear surface leads to an improvement in photogenerated current up to 0. 13 mA/cm 2 compared with a weak planarization...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of inertial particles in turbulent flows is highly non-uniform and {{is driven by}} the local dynamics of the turbulent structures of the underlying carrier flow field. In the specific context of dilute particle-laden wall-bounded flows, deposition and resuspension mechanisms are dominated by the interaction between inertial particles and coherent turbulent structures characteristic of the wall region. The macroscopic behavior of these two-phase systems is influenced by particle inertia, which plays a role at the microscale of a single dispersed element. These turbulent structures, which control the turbulent regeneration cycles, are strongly affected by the wall roughness. The effect of the roughness on turbulent transport in dilute suspension has been still poorly investigated. The issue is discussed here by addressing direct numerical simulation (DNS), at friction Reynolds number Ret = 18 0, of a dilute dispersion of heavy particles in a turbulent channel flow, spanning two orders of magnitude of particle inertia. The <b>irregular</b> wall <b>roughness</b> is obtained through the superimposition of four sinusoidal functions of different wavelengths and random amplitudes.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{equations}} {{have been proposed}} to determine dispersion coefficient of stream analytically since 1950. However, it is realized {{that it is difficult}} to use these equations for predicting the dispersion coefficients because they require the detailed information on velocity profile and cross-sectional geometry. To solve the problem, researchers tried to introduce empirical equations. This research presents an attempt to get back to the fundamental analytical equations, because it is believed that a simple model proposed by Maghrebi can provide a good prediction of the normalized isovel contours in the cross-section of open or closed channels that are <b>irregular</b> in <b>roughness</b> as well as geometry. The input data for the model are the bed profile and its shear and roughness distributions. Having obtained the isovel contours, the depth-averaged velocity profile at a cross-section can be extracted. In order to extract the parameters that characterize the longitudinal dispersion coefficients, applications of the model to the cross-sections of the Sacramento Delta in the Northern California and Clinch River near Speers Ferry in the US are presented. The evaluated parameters are the velocity deviation intensity ratio r, a dimensionless parameter I and the dispersion coefficient K, which is derived from the depth-averaged velocity profile by triple integration suggested by Fischer. The results of this study show that the longitudinal dispersion coefficient predicted by the use of isovel contours is close to the coefficients produced by measurement as well as theoretical methods...|$|R
40|$|Structural {{adhesive}} joints involving Selective Laser Melting (SLM) titanium {{bonded to}} titanium or to a composite material have significant potential for weight and cost saving in aerospace and other industries. However, the bonding potential of as-manufactured SLM titanium is largely unknown, {{and the use}} of additional hierarchical surface features has not been explored or characterised. Here we demonstrate with the use of SLM that a hierarchy of two surface features at different length scales can improve the fracture toughness of metal-metal and metal-composite bonded joints. At one length scale (10 - 15 μm), we established through fracture toughness testing that the intrinsic <b>irregular</b> <b>roughness</b> of the SLM surface maximises the bonding potential for both metal-metal adhesive joints (KIc= 1. 38 kJ/m 2) and hybrid metal-composite co-cured joints (KIc = 1. 20 kJ/m 2). We then combined this with surface features at a larger length scale (200 μm). For metal-composite joints, the use of groove surface features was found to deflect the crack path, which increased the fracture toughness of the joint by up to 50 % for outward protruding grooves to a value of KIc= 1. 65 kJ/m 2. We identified the rise in fracture toughness as a combination of an increase in the crack path length and a shift from pure mode I to a mixed-mode crack growth. We found that the relative contributions of these two factors were approximately equal. This work demonstrates that SLM-manufactured titanium can have significant advantages over conventional titanium for bonded joints. In comparison with conventional techniques, SLM surfaces can be used in adhesive bonds without the need for expensive and time-consuming surface preparation, and the design freedom allows for surface features that can significantly improve performance...|$|E
40|$|At present surface {{roughness}} {{is one of}} the main indications of component quality. During the operation mainly the outer layer of the component is exposed to external action, and depending on the roughness structure conclusions can be drawn about the service properties of the surface. Because cylindrical grinding today is rather widely used and precise method of treatment of bodies of revolution in the field of mechanical engineering the given paper pays attention to the surfaces treated on cylindrical grinding machines, and more exactly to their roughness, determining the possible use of the given surfaces. For the analyses of the roughness parameters the ISO standard ISO 25178 - 2 : 2012 ”Geometrical product specifications (GPS) — Surface texture: Areal — Part 2 : Terms, definitions and surface texture parameters” was used, in which there were determined the texture parameters of the surface. Contrary to other standards, such as ISO 4287, ISO 13565 the new standard allowed to assess real surface properties, since in the given case the surface is being viewed in three-dimension space. During the research three cylindrically ground samples treated at different cutting conditions were chosen. By the help of modern measuring equipment Taylor Hobson Talysurf Intra 50 the topography of the given samples was taken in order to obtain and compare the roughness parameters and for the purpose of setting relation between the cutting regime and roughness parameters, and determining mathematical model of cylindrically ground samples.

After {{a large number}} of pulses, modification of the stainless-steel surface was observed, such as the formation of a wavy structure, <b>irregular</b> <b>roughness,</b> and cracks on the target surface. X-ray and optic microscopic analyses of targets revealed changes in the orientation and dimensions of crystallites (grains) over a depth of up to 20 μm for 316 L(N) -IG stainless steel after 200 pulses and up to 40 μm for 12 Cr 18 Ni 10 Ti stainless steel after 50 pulses, which is significantly larger than the depth of the layer melted in one pulse (∼ 10 μm). In a series of 200 tests of ITER-grade 316 L(N) -IG ITER stainless steel, a linear increase in the height of irregularity (roughness) with increasing number of pulses at a rate of up to ∼ 1 μm per pulse was observed. No alteration in the chemical composition of the stainless-steel surface in the series of tests was revealed. A model is developed that describes the formation of wavy irregularities on the melted metal surface with allowance for the nonlinear stage of instability of the melted layer with a vapor/plasma flow above it. A decisive factor in this case is the viscous flow of the melted metal from the troughs to tops of the wavy structure. The model predicts saturation of the growth of the wavy structure when its amplitude becomes comparable with its wavelength. Approaches to describing the observed stochastic relief and roughness of the stainless-steel surface formed in the series of tests are considered. The recurrence of the melting-solidification process in which mechanisms of the hill growth compete with the spreading of the material from the hills can result in the formation of a stochastic relief...|$|E
40|$|The present effort {{explores the}} {{relative}} impact of various topographical scales present within <b>irregular</b> surface <b>roughness</b> on a {{turbulent boundary layer}} under both developing- and developed-flow conditions. Low-order representations of highly <b>irregular</b> surface <b>roughness</b> replicated from a turbine-blade damaged by deposition of foreign materials were generated using singular value decomposition to decompose the complex topography into a set of topographical basis functions of decreasing importance to the original “full” surface character. The low-order surface models were then formed by truncating the full set of basis functions at the first 5 and 16 modes (containing approximately 71 % and 95 % of the full surface content, respectively) so that only the most dominant and large-scale topographical features {{were included in the}} models, while the finer-scale surface details are excluded. Physical replications of the full surface and the two low-order models were created using rapid prototyping methods to generate short and long streamwise fetches of roughness, and 2 -D particle-image velocimetry (PIV) was used to acquire ensembles of instantaneous velocity fields in the streamwise–wall-normal plane for developing- and developed-flow conditions at moderate Reynolds number followed by stereo PIV measurements in a wall-parallel plane deep in the roughness sublayer (y = 0. 047 δ). Comparison of both single- and multipoint statistics (mean velocity and Reynolds normal and shear stresses) as well as quadrant analysis of the instantaneous events contributing to the mean Reynolds shear stress from the 2 -D PIV measurements indicates that a 16 -mode model of the full surface faithfully reproduces the characteristics of flow over the full surface for both developing- and developed-flow conditions. For the latter scenario, both the 5 - and 16 -mode models reproduce the outer-layer characteristics for flow over the full surface in accordance with Townsend’s wall similarity hypothesis. However, neither low-order surface representation fully reproduces important details of the Reynolds-shear-stress-producing events within the roughness sublayer, particularly the contributions of the most intense ejection and sweep events. The stereo-PIV measurements deep within the roughness sublayer at y = 0. 047 δ reveal a wealth of information about roughness-induced effects, including the tendency of the roughness to promote ‘channeling’ of the flow in the form of low- and high-momentum pathways as noted in contour maps of the mean velocity defect. Similarly, enhanced turbulent and vortical activity is observed both between and along the spanwise boundaries of these streamwise-elongated large-scale pathways. Taken together, these observations support the idea that these persistent low-momentum pathways might represent the statistical imprint of trains of hairpin vortex packets that are channeled along preferred paths over the roughness. Conditional averaging and two-point correlations of velocity further support these structural observations, particularly clear large- scale streamwise coherence of these motions. Of interest, while the M = 5 results show important differences from the full-surface results, the M = 16 results are virtually indistinguishable from those of the full surface, including in the single-point turbulence statistics as well as the analysis of the average spatial structure. This consistency is not simply qualitative but is indeed quantitative as the magnitudes of the M = 16 model single-point statistics mirror those of the full surface as do the spatial locations of the low- and high-momentum pathways identified in the mean velocity defect results as well as the enhanced turbulent and vortical activity along the spanwise boundaries of these large-scale motions. Hence, these observations provide significant evidence supporting the importance of the intermediate topographical scales in setting the flow conditions within the roughness sublayer, not only in a statistical sense but also in a structural sense...|$|R

This approach has been previously explored by other researchers and what is presented here is an improved version. In this approach, the track is represented by an infinitely long periodic structure with the period equal to the sleeper spacing and the vertical <b>irregular</b> profile (<b>roughness)</b> of the railhead {{is assumed to be}} periodic in the track direction with the period equal to the length of a number (integer), N, of sleeper bays. By assuming linear dynamics for the wheel/track system and for steady state, each wheel/rail force is a periodic function of time and can be expressed as a Fourier series. Fourier coefficients are then shown to be determined by solving, separately, N sets of linear algebraic equations. The coefficient matrix of each set of equations is independent of rail roughness and therefore this {{approach is}} particularly useful in modelling the generation and growth of rail roughness of short wavelengths. Excitation purely from the axle loads moving over the periodic track structure is realised by assuming a smooth railhead surface, and subsequently roughness equivalent to such an excitation is defined and evaluated. This equivalent roughness may, in addition to the actual rail roughness, be input into models in which the effect of moving axle loads has been excluded, so that the predictions from those models can be improved. Results are produced using the improved Fourier-series approach to investigate the effects of wheel speeds, roughness wavelengths and interactions between multiple wheels on wheel/rail contact forces...|$|R

In vitro tumor-oids developed in this study recapture important features of the temporal-spatial organization of solid tumors, including the presence of necrotic areas at the center and higher levels of cell division at the tumor periphery.

The initial radii of the micelles were R similar to 15 A, while the corresponding polar solvent-to-surfactant molar ratios were intermediate between w(0) = 4. 3 for FM and w(0) = 7 for W.

The high-frame-rate sPIV measurements in the spanwise 9 ̆ 6 wall-normal plane were conducted at a lower momentum thickness Reynolds number of 4500 and revealed the dynamical nature of the flow both in the outer region and in the roughness sublayer...|$|R
