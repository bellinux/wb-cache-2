2500|$|Sigismund sent Oswald back to Tyrol {{to prepare}} the county for an {{expected}} Hussite invasion of the Empire and invited the Hussites to the Council of Basel to negotiate. Sigismund himself fled to Milan and later to Piacenza under the pretext {{that he had to}} <b>go</b> <b>now</b> <b>to</b> Rome to be crowned emperor. During this time Oswald commissioned the cloister Neustift to create a second manuscript collection of his songs. Sigismund called him to join him in Piacenza and Oswald obliged. The unpleasantness of his visit inspired him to write the complaint-song [...] "Wer die ougen vil verschüren", which he set to a French melody. In May of the same year, Oswald was sent by Sigismund to Basel. After over a year of negotiations, Sigismund was crowned Holy Roman Emperor on 31 May 1433 by Pope Eugenius IV, with Oswald probably in attendance.|$|E
