5|$|The mid-engine {{complicated}} {{the design of}} the four-wheel drive system, and an <b>innovative</b> <b>solution</b> was needed to get drive {{from the rear of the}} engine to the front wheels. The chosen design took the front-wheel drive from the central differential on the rear transaxle and sent it through the V in the centre of the engine using a quill drive, before joining an inverted differential. The clutch was a twin-plate unit designed by AP Racing.|$|E
5|$|As Syzygy and Nutting {{prepared}} for the MOA show, Bushnell learned that another pair of engineers were also creating an arcade version of Spacewar. In August 1971 Bushnell called Bill Pitts and Hugh Tuck, operating as Mini-Computer Applications, {{so that they could}} meet and discuss their solutions to the problem of running Spacewar on an inexpensive computer. Pitts and Tuck were developing a prototype machine of Galaxy Game when they met with Bushnell; the game, however, while a faithful recreation of Spacewar, ran on an externally-connected DEC PDP-11 with a Hewlett-Packard 1300A Electrostatic Display, and the total cost of the prototype unit was US$20,000. The Syzygy duo were relieved, though also somewhat disappointed, to find that Galaxy Game was not using an <b>innovative</b> <b>solution</b> Syzygy had missed to build an economically-competitive arcade game. Pitts and Tuck, conversely, felt that Computer Space was a pale imitation of Spacewar, while Galaxy Game was a superior adaptation of the game. They eventually produced two game prototypes, both displayed in the Stanford student union building, but never produced the game commercially due to the high cost of the cabinet.|$|E
25|$|Creativity-relevant skills (ability to {{concentrate}} on a problem {{for long periods of}} time, to abandon unproductive searches, and to temporarily put aside stubborn problems). The ability to put aside stubborn problems is referred to by Jex & Britt as productive forgetting. Creativity-relevant skills also require the individual contributor to evaluate a problem from multiple vantage points. One must be able to take on the perspective of various users. For example, an Operation Manager analyzing a reporting issue and developing an <b>innovative</b> <b>solution</b> would consider the perspective of a sales person, assistant, finance, compensation, and compliance officer.|$|E

25|$|Solaris Urbino 12 series {{were the}} first of the new series of Solaris 12.0 metre buses. It is the most popular model series {{in the history of the}} brand. Urbino 12 debuted in mid-1999 during an International Trade Fair. Since the turn of 2001-2002 the series {{produced}} its second generation. Since 2005 the series had produced the third generation of the bus. During the Transexpo Trade Fair in 2008 in Kielce the new prototype for the Solaris Urbino series was branded as the New Edition Generation 3.5". The structure for the fourth generation uses the same one like that of the third generation of buses. The refurbished interior has more lighting located behind the green overhead panels. The panel extends for the entire length of the bus roof in the central part of the bus. Another <b>innovative</b> <b>solution</b> was to hide the engine compartment with first passengers of the bus.|$|E
25|$|One {{subject the}} laws did cover {{is how the}} king fit within {{the rest of the}} legal system. The king was not {{supposed}} to be above the law. In fact, some stipulations applied specifically to the king. However, as the king was the most powerful individual, and the one with the highest honour in an area, it was difficult to enforce the law against him. Although it might have been possible to proceed against the king as against any other, the laws also had an <b>innovative</b> <b>solution</b> to this quandary. Instead of enforcing against the king directly, a dependent of the king known as an aithech fortha (substitute churl) was enforced against instead, and the king was responsible for repaying the substitute churl. The laws also specified certain cases in which a king lost his honour price. These included doing the work of a commoner, moving around without a retinue, and showing cowardice in battle; again, though, it is unclear how often such stipulations were followed.|$|E
25|$|Officially {{registered}} {{teams can}} also be nominated by their region for the Global Innovation Award, where they could win a grant to make their <b>innovative</b> <b>solution</b> to the annual challenge theme's problem a reality. As of the ANIMAL ALLIES Season, the First Place team wins $20,000 and two other Finalists each win $5,000. The money {{can be used to}} further the team's ideas or to continue in FIRST programs. All three finalist teams also receive a LEGO Mindstorms Education EV3 Robot Set. All submissions are reviewed by a panel of judges consisting of experts from engineering and industrial fields as well as experts in the challenge theme for that year. Teams are judged on problem identification, innovation, implementation, and effective use of STEM principles. From all of the teams nominated by every FIRST LEGO League region, twenty teams are selected as semi-finalists and are invited to attend the Global Innovation Award Celebration in Washington, D.C. At the D.C. event, the first place and other finalist teams wining the cash prizes are announced.|$|E

25|$|By mid-2003, {{the canal}} trust {{has succeeded in}} getting the whole route of the canal {{protected}} by inclusion in the local council structure plans. By this time, the estimated cost of restoration had risen to Â£34 million, but they launched a major initiative to raise the funding over a 10-year period. Grants from the Derbyshire City Partnership received from 2008 enabled the Trust Development Group {{to begin the process}} of applying for outline planning permission for reinstatement. The route of the canal passes through three local council regions, and so separate applications had to be made to Derby City Council, Erewash Borough Council and South Derbyshire District Council. All three applications had been approved by 24 August 2011, paving the way for actual reinstatement to begin, subject to the necessary funding being available. The restoration plans do not include reinstatement of a level crossing of the River Derwent. The site of the original crossing has been lost to development, and there would be issues with water supply and flood risk associated with a crossing on the level. An <b>innovative</b> <b>solution</b> has been suggested in the form of the Derby Arm, which would transport a caisson containing water and a boat in a semi-circular arc from one side of the river to the other. Its design is similar to a medieval trebuchet.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} aspects of Australia's conduct of the Vietnam War had been the employment of a barrier minefield around Phuoc Tuy from 1967 to 1969. Wilton maintained that the minefield was already under construction when he first learned of it, and that he considered the decision within the purview of the commander on the ground, Brigadier Stuart Graham. When confronted with the increasing casualties among Australian troops from mines evidently lifted from the area by the Viet Cong, he pointed out that the South Vietnamese, who had been expected to patrol the minefield, were not playing their part. Wilton further believed that the barrier minefield was an <b>innovative</b> <b>solution</b> to the problems facing the task force and that the commander's decision to implement it was [...] "better than sitting on his backside and not trying anything". He rejected suggestions by critics that the minefield was [...] "the biggest blunder" [...] Australia made in Vietnam, declaring that this was [...] "like being wise after the event".|$|E

The school occupies three floors of the nine-floor wing (two floors are occupied by retail uses, with an above-grade parking garage occupying the remaining three storeys). The integration of the Ryerson faculty with commercial uses in the same building has been praised as an <b>innovative</b> <b>solution</b> for the downtown university.|$|E

2500|$|In early November 2007, a {{group of}} hackers (fronted by a Russian hacker known as Netkas), using an already {{modified}} Boot-132 source root from David Elliot (also known as dfe), developed a method of emulating an EFI environment using a specially modified Darwin bootloader. In practical terms, this meant that regular PCs meeting a minimum set of hardware requirements could now be [...] "seen" [...] as real Macintosh computers by the OS, allowing the use of unmodified, [...] "stock" [...] Apple kernels (as long as the CPU supports it) and thus giving a more transparent and reliable operation. Several methods for real world deployment of this <b>innovative</b> <b>solution</b> have arisen around the Internet.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the live robot run, the competition has three additional judged sections {{with the purpose of}} providing teams with feedback on their achievement of the FIRST LEGO League learning objectives. The first judging session, Core Values, is designed to determine how the team works together and uses the FIRST LEGO League Core Values in everything they do, which include inspiration, teamwork, Gracious Professionalism, and Coopertition. In most regions, teams are also asked to perform a teamwork activity (usually timed). Secondly, in the Robot Design, or technical judging, the team demonstrates the mechanical design, programming, and strategy/innovation of their robot. Thirdly, in the Project, the students must give a 5-minute presentation on research a topic related to the current challenge. The required steps of the project as teams to first identify a problem, then create an <b>innovative</b> <b>solution</b> to their identified problem by modifying something that already exists or creating something completely new (an [...] "innovative solution"), and then they must share that solution with others, such as real world professionals who have expertise in the annual challenge theme.|$|E
