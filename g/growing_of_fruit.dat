500|$|At the {{opposite}} end of the parish is part of the 580 acre East Malling Research Station. This began in 1913 with 23 acres in response to a need among Kent farmers for assistance with their fruit growing activities. Since fruit was an important part of the Kent economy, the station performed a valuable role is carrying out research experiments and advising farmers on fruit production. The land that forms the research station grounds is conducive to the <b>growing</b> <b>of</b> <b>fruit,</b> with good water retention and drainage properties. The station was also well placed in terms of transport links, since the nearby railway connected with London in one direction and the agricultural college at Wye in the other. It was an indication of the importance of the research station that the government and fruit producers were prepared to give financial support for its work. In 1938 the 360 acre Bradbourne House estate was added to the site. As a result of research work carried out on the site, the station established a reputation as a world centre for the research of perennial crops. Horticultural Research International operated the site until 2009 until 1 April 2010, since when the research station has been owned by the East Malling Trust. The station is fully engaged with local business and contains a lecture hall that can take 200 delegates.|$|E

40|$|A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} on the present condition of farmlands in Kogi State. Farmers ’ knowledge and experience of tree growing, their preferences and perceptions, and obstacles to planting in fifteen villages that form a cross-section of the state geo-political zones. Fifteen household heads were interviewed in each of the fifteen villages. Thus 150 households from the fifteen villages were randomly selected for the study. 150 copies of structured questionnaires were administered to elicit response from the respondents. The survey revealed that almost every farmland contains a combination of different tree species. Farmers generally prefer to grow fruit trees because they can provide income, timber, fuel and fodder for their livestocks. 40 % of the respondents are involved in <b>growing</b> <b>of</b> <b>fruit</b> trees for food while 30 % grow trees for lumber, 12 % and 10 % grow trees for fuelwood and environmental protection respectively. Kogi State farmers are aware of the value of multipurpose trees and want to plant more if given the opportunity. Lack of land, technical know – how, inputs, time and labour are major constraints preventing more tree planting. The design of an agroforestry programme to awaken and strengthen extension services and provide seedlings and supports to farmers in Kogi State are recommended...|$|E

Introduction: The term pomology in {{its general}} sense {{applies to all}} those subjects, both {{practical}} and scientific, which {{have to do with}} the <b>growing</b> <b>of</b> <b>fruit.</b> The word comes from the Latin, pomum, a word that was used generically for"fruit. " In later Latin it came to be associated more particularly with apple -like fruits. The word is also handed down to us in the French,pomme, meaning "apple". In English we know it as pome, a botanical term used to designate fruits that have the peculiar morphological structure of the apple,pear,and quince. In its true sense we may define pomology as the science of fruits, and its limitations as a science or an art depends upon the use of the term fruit. A concise definition of a fruit,in a horticultural sense is, we may say, impossible. The science may be divided into three parts: systematic pomology, the classification of fruits, practical pomology,the science of growing fruit, and commercial pomology, the science of marketing fruits. In this treatise I shall limit myself to the field of "Systematic Pomology"with reference to the pone fruits, namely:the apple, pear and quince...|$|E
