60|$|She slowly {{replaced}} all her simple maiden underlinen with garments which, {{while still}} simple, were wrought with beautiful French embroidery, tucks, and drawnwork. She crocheted fine edgings on the inexpensive <b>knitted</b> <b>underwear</b> she wore in winter. She made little corset covers and chemises of fine but fairly inexpensive lawns, and, with simple flowered designs and perfect laundering, her nightgowns were always sweetly fresh and dainty. In some publication she ran across a brief printed {{note to the}} effect that French women were just beginning to wear fascinating beruffled caps at the breakfast table. It meant nothing to her that in her case she must first prepare the breakfast. Promptly appeared in the house a yard of dotted Swiss muslin, and Saxon was deep in experimenting on patterns for herself, and in sorting her bits of laces for suitable trimmings. The resultant dainty creation won Mercedes Higgins' enthusiastic approval.|$|E
50|$|Brugger {{was born}} 16 June 1918 in Kenosha, Wisconsin. He never {{attended}} college but had strong mechanical aptitude and mathematical skills. He {{worked as a}} mechanic in his father's garage until World War II, when {{he worked in the}} cryptology section of the U. S. Signal Corps. After the war he went to work for Jockey International and rose to the position of chief engineer for Jockey's worldwide knitting operations. He designed innovative knitting machines, including a compactor that minimized shrinkage in <b>knitted</b> <b>underwear.</b> Following a divorce in 1965 he moved to Mexico to work as a textile consultant.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. With the {{improvement}} of people’s living standard, the traditional warm clothing already cannot satisfy people’s diversified demands about clothes ’ comfortableness, functionality and aesthetics. Hygroscopic exothermic fibers as a positive heat production type of warm fibers have attracted much attention. Softwarm heating warm fiber {{is a kind of}} new functional material {{and at the same time}} it is a representative of hygroscopic exothermic fiber. It can absorb the moisture by skin breathe and transfer it into heat energy through chemical reaction so as to achieve the purpose of warmth. In this paper, warmth property, tensile property, and drapability of softwarm fiber plain knitted fabric were tested, and comfort property, mechanical property and appearance performances of softwarm heating warm fiber fabric were investigated. Our study showed that the wearability of softwarm fiber fabric is fine, especially the warmth property which can meet our needs of warmth to <b>knitted</b> <b>underwear...</b>|$|E

40|$|The main {{functional}} {{purpose of}} knitted materials intended for warm underwear is to vouch-safe the comfort property while composing {{and maintaining a}} satisfactory microclimate on the human skin. This research seeks to investigate the liquid moisture management proper-ties of knitted fabrics of different fibre blends of different ratios suitable for the base layer of underwear. Two groups of fabrics were knitted in combined and plain and plated single jersey with laid-in yarn patterns, and their moisture management properties were assessed using a moisture management tester. The usage of fleecy yarn in knitted fabric structure has improved the moisture management properties of fabrics in comparison to combined pattern fabrics. Out of ten fabrics studied, three were classified as moisture management fabrics that are suitable for the base layer of underwear.

5000|$|Following the Civil War, {{the shoe}} {{business}} boomed and numerous factories were built. Despite {{a fire in}} 1875 which destroyed much {{of the center of}} town, Farmington was known as [...] "The Shoe Capital of New Hampshire." [...] Other factories produced knives, <b>knit</b> <b>underwear,</b> wooden boxes, wooden handles and carriages. Brushes were manufactured by the F. W. Browne Company, from which Booker T. Washington ordered twelve street brooms in 1915 for use at the Tuskegee Institute. The town had five blacksmith shops. But the Panic of 1893 closed all but two large shoe factories. The industry faded in the 20th century, when most of the factories were demolished.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Heat and {{moisture}} comfort of several <b>knitting</b> <b>underwear</b> fabrics were measured and grey clustering analysis {{was applied to}} evaluate the heat {{and moisture}} comfort of these fabrics. According to the experimental data and grey clustering analysis results, the fibers can be ranked in terms of heat and moisture comfort as modal, bamboo and cotton, respectively. The evaluated fabrics were ranked as modal, bamboo, cotton/bamboo and cotton, in terms of heat and moisture comfort.

50|$|After {{learning}} how to make socks and mitts, Cowichan women began to <b>knit</b> knee-length <b>underwear</b> and sweaters. Like the other garments, sweaters were and are today knit in the round with no seams, using multiple needles in the European style of the period. The earliest Cowichan sweaters were all of one colour, knitted with a turtle-neck. Some knitters used a raised stitch {{similar to that of}} a gansey, possibly inspired by the clothing of the many British fishermen who had settled in the area.|$|R
40|$|Assuring {{the thermal}} {{stability}} {{of the human body}} {{is one of the most}} important functions of the clothing, especially for sportswear, casual wear and <b>underwear.</b> <b>Knitted</b> fabrics not only posses stretch and provide freedom of movement, but they also good handle, high level of clothing comfort and easily transmit vapor from the body. In this paper, the influence of cotton knitted structure on the thermal comfort properties was investigated. The thermal properties of knitted fabrics based single jersey, 1 x 1 rib and interlock structures were measured using method of Boc. The results indicate that each knitted structure tends to yield rather different thermal comfort properties. Interlock and 1 x 1 rib fabrics have a high thermal conductivity. On the other hand, single jersey fabrics have lower water vapor and air permeability values than 1 x 1 and interlock fabrics and give a warmer feeling based on lower thermal absorptivity values.
