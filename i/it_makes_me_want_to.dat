Rater called it [...] "her favorite scene", explaining: [...] "I loved the scene where Owen, Derek and Mark take Cristina, Meredith and Lexie to the baseball field. This {{is one of the first}} times Owen has seen Cristina's intensity. And I love that he makes her leave the hospital, focus on something else. That's why he's so good for her. The scene was actually inspired by Shonda saying, let's do a scene where they're all playing baseball. But when I finally saw it, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> write more scenes like that, with our doctors outside of the hospital, little glimpses of them in real life." ...|$|E

500|$|Formby {{returned}} to Britain at Christmas and appeared in Dick Whittington at the Grand Theatre, Leeds for nine weeks, and then, in February 1947, {{he appeared in}} variety for two weeks at the London Palladium. Reviewing the show, The Times thought Formby was [...] "more than ever the mechanized perfection of naive jollity. His smile, though fixed, is winning, and his songs... are catchy". In September that year he went on a 12-week tour of Australia and New Zealand. On his return he was offered more film roles, but turned them down, saying [...] "when I look back {{on some of the}} films I've done in the past <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> cringe. I'm afraid the days of being a clown are gone. From now on I'm only going to do variety". He began suffering increasing health problems including a gastric ulcer, and was treated for breathing problems from his heavy smoking. He finished the year in pantomime, appearing as Buttons in Cinderella at the Liverpool Empire Theatre, with Beryl playing Dandini.|$|E

The parole officer eventually called the Concord police. Upon the arrival of a police sergeant, Garrido admitted he had kidnapped and raped her. Only after this did Dugard identify herself as Jaycee Dugard. It was later suggested that Dugard was beginning to show signs of Stockholm syndrome. In a 2016 interview with Diane Sawyer of ABC News, Dugard stated that her compassion and willingness to interact with her captor were only means of surviving. Dugard: [...] "The phrase [...] implies that hostages cracked by terror and abuse become affectionate towards their captors." [...] "Well it's, really, it's degrading, you know, having my family believe that I was in love with this captor and wanted to stay with him. I mean, that is so far from the truth that <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> throw up. ...I adapted to survive my circumstance." [...] said Dugard. Repeatedly during this segment of the interview she states that, as a way to survive, and hoping to end abuse, many victims are forced to sympathize with their captors.|$|E

2500|$|For Pet Sounds, Wilson {{desired to}} make [...] "a {{complete}} statement", {{similar to what}} he believed the Beatles had done with their newest album Rubber Soul, released in December 1965. Wilson was immediately enamored with the album, given the impression {{that it had no}} filler tracks, a feature that was mostly unheard of at a time when 45rpm singles were considered more noteworthy than full-length LPs. Many albums up until the mid-1960s lacked a cohesive artistic goal and were largely used to sell singles at a higher price point. Wilson found that Rubber Soul subverted this by having a wholly consistent thread of music. Inspired, he rushed to his wife and proclaimed, [...] "Marilyn, I'm gonna make the greatest album! The greatest rock album ever made!" [...] He would say of his reaction to Rubber Soul: [...] "I liked the way it all went together, the way it was all one thing. It was a challenge to <b>me...</b> <b>It</b> didn't <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>want</b> to copy them but {{to be as good as}} them.

By {{the time the}} album was released on 18 October 2004 via Laughing Outlaw Records the group had started gigging in Sydney and Simon Gibson of Sneeze replaced Gallaway on drums as she returned to Smudge. Soph Gyles of Oz Music Project described the album as [...] "quite pleasant, melodic pop with tempered female vocals, but <b>it</b> doesn't exactly <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>want</b> to have a bakesale in celebration".

He loved the Beatles' later music when they evolved and started making intelligent, masterful music, but before that Phil was it." [...] According to Mike Love, Carl followed the Beatles more closely than anyone else in the group, but Brian was the most [...] "rattled" [...] by the Beatles, feeling tremendous pressure to [...] "keep pace" [...] with them. Brian once characterized himself as [...] "fucked up" [...] and [...] "jealous" [...] of Spector and the Beatles, saying; [...] "i was flipping out. I couldn't understand how [...] could be just yelled and screamed at. The music they made, 'I Want to Hold Your Hand' for example, wasn't even that great a record, but they just screamed at it." [...] On another occasion, he's said that he was overwhelmed by the [...] "electricity" [...] of their voices on the song ("It really turned me on"). He recalled that he and Love immediately felt threatened by the Beatles and added that he knew the Beach Boys could never match the excitement created by the Beatles as performers, and that this realization led him to concentrate his efforts on trying to outdo them in the recording studio.|$|R
