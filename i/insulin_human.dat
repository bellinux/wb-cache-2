50|$|The use {{and abuse}} of {{exogenous}} insulin is claimed to be widespread amongst the bodybuilding community. <b>Insulin,</b> <b>human</b> growth hormone (HGH) and {{insulin-like growth factor 1}} (IGF-1) are self-administered by those looking to increase muscle mass beyond the scope offered by anabolic steroids alone. Their rationale is that since insulin and HGH act synergistically to promote growth, and since IGF-1 is a primary mediator of musculoskeletal growth, the 'stacking' of insulin, HGH and IGF-1 should offer a synergistic growth effect on skeletal muscle. This theory has been supported in recent years by top-level bodybuilders whose competition weight is in excess of 50 lb of muscle, larger than that of competitors in the past, and with even lower levels of body fat.

DESIGN [...] Matched case-control study of insulin treated diabetic patients admitted to hospital because of hypoglycaemia during 1984 - 7, the period when <b>human</b> <b>insulin</b> was introduced into treatment. SETTING [...] Case admissions and control admissions were obtained from eight public hospitals within the Swiss canton of Berne and a second control group comprised members of the Bernese section of the Swiss Diabetes Association. SUBJECTS [...] 94 patients with insulin treated diabetes with a total of 112 admissions for hypoglycaemia during 1984 - 7 (case admissions), 182 patients with insulin treated diabetes seen in the same hospitals for reasons other than hypoglycaemia with a total of 225 admissions (control admissions), and 86 insulin treated diabetic patients who were members of the Bernese section of the Swiss Diabetes Association. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Type of insulin used at time of admission, glycaemic control as measured by amount of glycated haemoglobin or glucose concentration; severity of hypoglycaemia. RESULTS [...] Treatment with <b>human</b> <b>insulin</b> at admission was more common in cases than controls (52 / 112 (46 %) admissions v 77 / 225 (34 %); p = 0. 003). 116 out of 129 (90 %) of admissions taking <b>human</b> <b>insulin</b> had been transferred from animal insulin, mainly because of non-availability of porcine insulins. The ratio of rate of hypoglycaemia in those taking <b>human</b> <b>insulin</b> to the rate in those taking animal insulin was 2. 4 (95 % confidence interval 1. 3 to 4. 4). Other risk factors for hypoglycaemia were a history of hypoglycaemic coma (rate ratio of history to no history 3. 8, 2. 3 to 6. 4) and good glycaemic control (rate ratio of good to poor control 3. 9, 1. 4 to 7. 5).
