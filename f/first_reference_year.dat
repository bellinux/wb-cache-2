[...] By John Laycock. 3s. 9d. net. Refuge Press, Manchester.". It was also referenced in the club documents of several climbing clubs at the time, including by the Yorkshire Ramblers' Club in 1913, who stated: [...] "In his little volume, Some Gritstone Climbs, Mr. J. Laycock speaks of the Buxton Boss, an excrescence of gritstone {{on the side of}} Coombs Moss, not far from Buxton. If this be the boulder I have in my mind, it is also known as the Buckstone and Robin Hood's Stone and, in addition to presenting several attractive little problems, possesses a peculiar historic interest all its own." ...|$|R
40|$|Buildings are {{generally}} modelled for compliance using <b>reference</b> weather <b>years.</b> In the UK {{these are the}} test <b>reference</b> <b>year</b> (TRY) used for energy analysis and the design summer year (DSY) used for assessing overheating in the summer. These <b>reference</b> <b>years</b> currently exist for 14 locations around the UK and consist of either a composite year compiled of the most average months from 23 years worth of observed weather data (TRY) or a single contiguous year representing a hot but non-extreme summer (DSY). In this paper, we compare simulations run using the <b>reference</b> <b>years</b> and the results obtained from simulations using the base data sets from which these <b>reference</b> <b>years</b> were chosen. We compare the posterior statistic to the <b>reference</b> <b>year</b> for several buildings examining energy use, internal temperatures, overheating and thermal comfort. We find that while the <b>reference</b> <b>years</b> allow rapid thermal modelling of building designs they are not always representative of the average energy use (TRY) exposed by modelling with many weather years. Also they do not always give an accurate indication of the internal conditions within a building and as such can give a misleading representation {{of the risk of}} overheating (DSY). Practical applications: An understanding of the limitations of the current <b>reference</b> <b>years</b> is required to allow creation of updated <b>reference</b> <b>years</b> for building simulation of future buildings. By comparing the <b>reference</b> <b>years</b> to the base data sets of historical data from which they were compiled an understanding of the benefit of multiple simulations in determining risk can be obtained...|$|R

The investigation has shown that using the Danish <b>reference</b> <b>year</b> based on the period 1975 - 1990 will result in deviations of up to 39 % compared with thermal performance calculated with multi-yearmeasured weather data. For the newer local <b>reference</b> <b>years</b> based on the period 2001 - 2010 the maximum deviation becomes 25 %. The investigation further showed an increase in utilization with an increase in global radiation. This means that besides increasing the thermal performance with increasing the solar radiation, the utilization of the solar radiation also becomes better...|$|R

40|$|New {{climate change}} {{projections}} for the UK were {{published by the}} United Kingdom Climate Impacts Programme in 2009. They form the 5 th and most comprehensive set of predictions of climate change developed for the UK to date. As one of main products of UK Climate Projections 2009 (UKCP 09),the Weather Generator, can generate a set of daily and hourly future weather variables at different time periods (2020 s to 2080 s) and carbon emission scenarios (low, medium, high) on a 5 km grid scale. In {{a radical departure from}} previous methods, the 2009 Projections are statistical- probabilistic in nature. A tool has been developed in Matlab to generate future Test <b>Reference</b> <b>Year</b> (TRY) and Design <b>Reference</b> <b>Years</b> (DRY) weather files from these Projections and the results were verified against results from alternative tools produced by Manchester University and Exeter University as well as with CIBSE's Future Weather Years (FWYs) which are based on earlier (4 th generation) climate change scenarios and are currently used by practitioners. The Northumbria tool is computationally efficient and can extract a single Test <b>Reference</b> <b>Year</b> and 2 Design <b>Reference</b> <b>Years</b> from 3000 years of raw data in less than 6 minutes on a typical modern PC. It uses an established ISO method for generating Test <b>Reference</b> <b>Year</b> data and an alternative method of constructing future Design Reference data is proposed.
