5|$|In 1974 most of River Oaks was {{assigned}} to River Oaks Elementary School. Prior to desegregation, it had around 800 children. After desegregation, many parents removed their children from River Oaks Elementary, and the school was far below capacity. In 1986 the neighborhood component of the school closed. At the time River Oaks had mainly older <b>families.</b> <b>At</b> the time the remaining families who did have children {{had the money to}} send their children to private school and preferred to do so.|$|E

5|$|The {{children}} {{were put into}} {{the care of a}} nanny, as was usual in upper-class <b>families</b> <b>at</b> the time. The first nanny was dismissed for insolence and the second for abusing the children. This second woman, anxious to suggest that the children preferred her to anyone else, would pinch Edward and Albert whenever they were about to be presented to their parents so that they would start crying and be speedily returned to her. On discovery, she was replaced by her effective and much-loved assistant, Charlotte Bill.|$|E

5|$|The {{classification}} {{most commonly}} adopted is that proposed by Beier in 1968. He divided the order into eight families. Klass, in 1997, studied the external male genitalia and postulated that the families Chaeteessidae and Metallyticidae diverged {{from the other}} <b>families</b> <b>at</b> an early date. However, the Mantidae and Thespidae are both polyphyletic, so the Mantodea {{will have to be}} revised.|$|E
5|$|The {{film crew}} {{recorded}} the students on campus, at home, {{with their friends}} and <b>families,</b> <b>at</b> medical appointments, and at transgender-related events. Some footage was recorded by the students themselves. In February 2005, the administration at Smith College prohibited the crew from continuing to film one of the documentary's subjects, Lucas Cheadle, on campus (except in his apartment). Cheadle asked the dean of students to reconsider, but his appeal was denied. Smith College has received considerable media attention about questions regarding transgender students.|$|E

5|$|Ashford {{has been}} {{associated}} with the German town Bad Münstereifel since the 20th century. British forces occupied the town in 1919 under the command of Major J Goode, following the end of the war. Goode subsequently formed close friendships with some Bad Münstereifel residents. John Wiles, Major Goode's brother in law, later became mayor of New Romney in 1946, and subsequently arranged a visit to the Rhineland with Winston Churchill. Wiles arranged several other exchange visits between British and German <b>families,</b> <b>at</b> a time where travel between the two countries was rare. He was declared an honorary citizen of Bad Münstereifel in 1961, which led to the two towns being formally twinned in 1964. Bad Münstereifel was twinned with the French town of Fougères, Brittany two years later, which led to a twinning with Ashford in 1984.|$|E

5|$|In August 1970, Les Solomon, {{his wife}} and {{daughter}} were on vacation in the southwest and arranged to visit Mims, Roberts and their <b>families.</b> <b>At</b> that time, Dan Meyer and Don Lancaster were among the most prolific authors in Popular Electronics. Meyer had built a million dollar a year business that sold kits of parts to build the project that he and Lancaster wrote about. Mims and Roberts wanted to do the same and quizzed Solomon on the kit business. Solomon gave them some statistics but said there was no way of knowing how many kits an article would sell, maybe a hundred, maybe a thousand.|$|E
5|$|The rural {{nature of}} his new home in Iwama allowed Ueshiba to {{concentrate}} on the second great passion of his life: farming. He had been born into a farming family and spent much of his life cultivating the land, from his settlement days in Hokkaidō to his work in Ayabe trying to make the Ōmoto-kyō compound self-sufficient. He viewed farming as a logical complement to martial arts; both were physically demanding and required single-minded dedication. Not only did his farming activities provide a useful cover for martial arts training under the government's restrictions, it also provided food for Ueshiba, his students and other local <b>families</b> <b>at</b> a time when food shortages were commonplace.|$|E
5|$|While some {{ships and}} units such as No 49 Squadron {{returned}} to the UK, most personnel had to remain on Christmas Island. The Minister of Supply gave assurances that no personnel would have {{to remain on the}} island {{for more than a year}} unless absolutely necessary, in which case home leave would be given. To maintain morale, units were given periodic briefings on the importance of their work. Junior officers took a keen interest in the welfare of the men and their <b>families</b> <b>at</b> home, since they were not permitted to bring them to the island. An efficient mail system was maintained to allow them to keep in contact. The quality of Army rations was better than at any other British base. The men were given one day a week off work, and sports such as soccer, cricket, tennis, volleyball sailing, fishing and water skiing were organised. Leave was provided that could be taken in Fiji, Hawaii or the Gilbert Islands. To relieve the monotony, some Army personnel ashore exchanged places with some Navy personnel afloat. A Christmas Island Broadcasting Service was established with nightly radio programs.|$|E
