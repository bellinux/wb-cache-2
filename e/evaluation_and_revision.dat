In other words, {{an appropriate}} instructional design for this course was not sufficiently available. It became plausibly prominent to conduct a research which was focused on developing an instructional design for this subskill. This research aimed at constructing an instructional design for speaking skills which was considered suitable with the students’ characteristics and their needs as well. The System Approach by Dick and Carey (1990) was used as the bases. This involved several well-sequenced important components, namely (1) identifying the instructional goals, (2) conducting an instructional analysis, (3) identifying the students’ entry behaviour and characteristics, (4) writing objective performance, (5) constructing criterion-reference tests, (6) developing an instructional strategy, (7) designing instructional materials, (8) constructing <b>and</b> conducting formative <b>evaluation,</b> <b>and</b> (9) revising the instructional materials. To obtain the intended instructional design, a try out of the design to the teachers and students as well as several crosschecks by the experts were unavoidably important to revise the design.
