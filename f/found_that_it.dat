5|$|COBOL 2002 {{suffered}} from poor support: no compilers completely supported the standard. Micro Focus <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{was due to}} a lack of user demand for the new features and due to the abolition of the NIST test suite, which had been used to test compiler conformance. The standardization process was also found to be slow and under-resourced.|$|E

5|$|After {{it first}} came to light in October, it was <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had been posted to YouTube several months earlier, along with a {{similarly}} threatening message in binary code. The poster of that video, known as AETBX, has suggested to inquiring journalists that GadgetZZ is {{not telling the truth}} about how it came to possess the video. Internet investigators managed to establish that it was filmed in the former Zofiówka Sanatorium outside Otwock, Poland, sometime between November 2013 and the video's release.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time, Franz-Joseph Müller von Reichenstein {{produced}} a similar substance, {{but could not}} identify it. The oxide was independently rediscovered in 1795 by Prussian chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth in rutile from Boinik (German name of Bajmócska) village of Hungary (now Bojničky in Slovakia). Klaproth <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> contained a new element and named it for the Titans of Greek mythology. After hearing about Gregor's earlier discovery, he obtained a sample of manaccanite and confirmed it contained titanium.|$|E
5|$|Because {{bulk cargo}} is so {{difficult}} to discharge, bulkers {{spend more time in}} port than other ships. A study of mini-bulkers <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> takes, on average, twice as much time to unload a ship as it does to load it. A mini-bulker spends 55hours at a time in port, compared to 35hours for a lumber carrier of similar size. This time in port increases to 74hours for Handymax and 120hours for Panamax vessels. Compared with the 12-hour turnarounds common for container ships, 15-hour turnarounds for car carriers, and 26-hour turnarounds for large tankers, bulker crews have more opportunities to spend time ashore.|$|E
40|$|Cable方程是模拟神经元动力学最重要的方程之一，有关该方程的研究得到了越来越多的关注。最近的研究发现，用带有分数阶导数的Cable方程来模拟神经元的动力学行为效果更好。本文旨在考察时间分数阶Cable方程的初边值问题，提出了一个数值计算方法，其中在时间方向上采用有限差分格式，在空间方向上采用Legendre谱方法。对于时间半离散格式，我们证明了格式的稳定性，并给出了误差估计式。对于全离散格式，我们证明了它是无条件稳定的，其收敛阶为O(△t+N^(-m)) ，其中△t、N和m分别为时间步长、多项式的阶数和精确解的正则度。特别是我们改进了[Lin，Li&Xu， 2011]中类似方法的误差估计，将N^ [...] .

When the Sauks returned to the village in 1829 after their annual winter hunt in the west, they <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had been occupied by white squatters who were anticipating the sale of land. After months of clashes with the squatters, the Sauks left in September 1829 for the next winter hunt. Hoping to avoid further confrontations, Keokuk told Forsyth {{that he and his}} followers would not return to Saukenuk.|$|E
5|$|By {{early on}} August 27, the {{tropical}} storm became slightly better organized, although {{the most intense}} winds were still removed from the center. Danny peaked with maximum sustained winds of 60mph (95km/h) and a minimum pressure of 1006 mbar (hPa; 29.71 inHg). It held this strength for about 12 hours before wind shear caused the storm to gradually weaken as it meandered northward. By August 28, Danny further deteriorated, and reconnaissance aircraft <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was barely a tropical storm. After stalling during the afternoon, the center resumed a north or north-northwestward drift.|$|E
5|$|During that year, Tesla {{worked in}} Pittsburgh, helping {{to create an}} {{alternating}} current system to power the city's streetcars. He found it a frustrating period because of conflicts with the other Westinghouse engineers over how best to implement AC power. Between them, they settled on a 60-cycle AC current system that Tesla proposed (to match the working frequency of Tesla's motor), but they soon <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would not work for streetcars, since Tesla's induction motor could run only at a constant speed. They ended up using a DC traction motor instead.|$|E

5|$|Emilio Segrè and Glenn Seaborg at the University of California {{produced}} 28 μg {{of plutonium}} in the 60-inch cyclotron there in May 1941, and <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had 1.7 times the thermal neutron {{capture cross section}} of uranium-235. At the time plutonium-239 had been produced in minute quantities using cyclotrons, {{but it was not}} possible to produce large quantities that way. Compton discussed with Eugene Wigner from Princeton University how plutonium might be produced in a nuclear reactor, and with Robert Serber how the plutonium produced in a reactor might be separated from uranium.|$|E

Glenn requested investigations from the General Accounting Office of Congress and held several hearings on the issue.

He also sat on the Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees and the Special Committee on Aging.|$|E
5|$|Gregson-Williams' {{score is}} darker {{to follow suit}} with the film. Gregson-Williams wanted Caspian's theme to convey a vulnerability, which would sound more vibrant as he became more heroic. It {{originally}} used a 3/4 time signature, but the opening scene required a 4/4 and thus it was changed. To represent Miraz's cunning, the heroic theme from the first film was inverted. For Reepicheep, a muted trumpet was used to present his militaristic and organised character. Gregson-Williams considered arranging his theme for a small pennywhistle, but <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> sounded too cute and broke the tension of the night raid.|$|E

5|$|Helicobacter pylori, {{previously}} Campylobacter pylori, is a gram-negative, microaerophilic bacterium found {{usually in}} the stomach.

It is also linked {{to the development of}} duodenal ulcers and stomach cancer. However, over 80% of individuals infected with the bacterium are asymptomatic, and it may {{play an important role in}} the natural stomach ecology.|$|E

Their analysis reaffirmed that O.emmonsae was a distinct species and <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was closest to O.macconnelli and O.russatus, differing from both by about 12% in the cytochrome b sequence; O.nitidus was more distantly related, differing by 14.7%.

The Australian troops made good progress, six tank crossings were readied and mines between them and the wire had been detected. Five minutes later, the 23 Matildas of the 7th Royal Tank Regiment advanced, accompanied by the 2/2nd Infantry Battalion. Passing through the gaps, they swung right along the double line of posts.|$|E
