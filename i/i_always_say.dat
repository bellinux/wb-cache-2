Wenger {{believed}} the trips to Eastern Europe threatened his team's {{chances of winning}} the Premier League: [...] "The other English teams have more comfortable groups than we do. It is tough to go to Russia – <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>say</b> {{that if you have}} to travel more than two hours it is difficult. Sometimes the players pay a high price in the games that follow the Champions League matches." ...|$|E
500|$|Growing up in a Jewish-American {{household}} {{where the}} parents demanded high achievement, Juster was intimately familiar with expectations, though {{in his case}} many of his parents' hopes were centered on his older brother, an academic star. The Terrible Trivium, the well-dressed, polite demon who sets the questers to mindless tasks, was Juster's way of representing his own tendency to avoid what he should be doing {{in favor of a}} more congenial occupation, such as his evasion of the grant project to write The Phantom Tollbooth. Juster drew on Feiffer's life experiences as well; the Whether Man's adage [...] "Expect everything, <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>say,</b> and the unexpected never happens" [...] was a favorite of the cartoonist's mother.|$|E
500|$|... "Behind the Crooked Cross" [...] {{is rarely}} played live as Hanneman hates the track, though King has {{always wanted to}} play it [...] "because it's got a cool intro" [...] despite it not being his {{favorite}} song. King said [...] "that's fine" [...] when speaking of the situation, noting [...] "there are songs {{that he wants to}} play that I always shoot down". [...] "Ghosts of War" [...] isn't King's favorite song either, which he attests [...] "everybody always wants to hear" [...] performed live. He confessed; [...] "I like the ending, you know, I like the big heavy part and <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>say,</b> 'Let's put the heavy ending at the end of [...] "Chemical Warfare" [...] and just do the last half.'

500|$|She {{has been}} labeled by the French media as [...] "the female Zidane" [...] - like Zinedine Zidane, she has Algerian ancestry, {{grew up in}} Marseille and {{possesses}} immense skill, especially as a playmaker with an eye for goal. As such, she has been nicknamed [...] "Ziza", a variant of Zidane's [...] "Zizou". In an interview with FIFA.com just before the 2012 Olympics, she alluded to the comparison, saying, [...] "Zidane is {{a role model for}} me. He was always the player that I most enjoyed watching. The comparison was made frequently when I was starting out, and now, as the years pass, it happens less and less often. But I wouldn't say I’m tired of it." [...] She often attempts to downplay the comparison, though, stating [...] "Being compared to Zidane is really nice, but I don’t think it can harm me because I’ve been hearing it since I was very young. It always makes me proud, but as <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>say,</b> I don’t think you can compare anyone to him. He’s unique". While training at the Clairefontaine academy in 2004, Nécib met Zidane, who was at the training center in preparation for qualifying for the 2006 World Cup (the finals would eventually be his last act as a professional). The two players exchanged shirts, and the shirt Nécib acquired from Zidane is currently in the possession of her father.|$|E

I feel it's important for me to continue to let my generation know how important he was to music." [...] Ciara also cites Whitney Houston, Aaliyah, TLC, SWV, Monica and Salt-n-Pepa, as influences. Her second studio album [...] (2006) was influenced by Michael Jackson, Prince, and pop singer Madonna.|$|E

2500|$|On 8 October, Wurst {{performed}} {{to a crowd}} of 2000 delegates and their staff at an anti-discrimination event held at the European Parliament in Brussels; her speech emphasised the values of tolerance, stating that [...] "As <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>say,</b> you don't have to love me, {{but you have to}} respect that I'm here." [...] Her appearance had been organised by the Austrian Member of the European Parliament (MEP) Ulrike Lunacek, a member of the Green Party, and while it had the backing of most of the European Parliament groups, it was not supported by the right-wing Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy and European Conservatives and Reformists groups.|$|E
2500|$|The album's , [...] "Who You Are", was {{released}} to the US iTunes Store on 22 February 2011. [...] It is the song from the album of which she is proudest. It's the song that draws the most messages from fans, on YouTube, Twitter and Facebook. [...] "The other day I had a girl message me saying 'I was ready to take my life and then I heard [...] "Who You Are"'. That pressure is beautiful but scary at the same time. I {{want to be a}} positive role model for young people. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>say</b> that I'm half-artist, half-therapist," [...] she laughs. She wrote the song {{at the end of a}} lonely three-month trip to Los Angeles when she was 20, having been shunted from studio to studio with various producers. [...] "I'm very much someone that lives to be happy. It's not just about the parties and I know so-and-so – I'm not that girl. So I looked in the mirror and started to cry and said 'who am I?' Music is my therapy." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 2004, Gaahl again {{received}} a prison sentence, for aggravated assault. He appealed for a reduced sentence, and in February 2005 he was re-sentenced to fourteen {{months in prison}} and ordered to pay the victim 190,000 NOK (about 30,400 US$) in compensation. The incident happened in February 2002 during a late-night party at Gaahl's house in Espedal, when he became involved in a confrontation {{with a man who}} arrived at his house. Gaahl was accused of severely beating the man, collecting his blood into a cup and threatening to make him drink it. Gaahl said [...] "I {{was the one who was}} attacked, but they think I punished him too hard. As <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>say,</b> when people cross my line and I let them know where the line is many steps before they cross it, and still they choose to cross it, then I will be the one to decide what their punishment will be". He also claimed to have given the man the cup [...] "so that he would not make such a mess in my house with all the blood". In March 2006, Gaahl recorded vocals for Gorgoroth's next album, Ad Majorem Sathanas Gloriam. According to band members, he was in prison from April to December 2006.|$|E

2500|$|The British {{historian}} Donald Cameron Watt {{wrote that}} Papen's general incompetence {{could be seen}} in that he [...] "… was so careless of his secret documents as to betray to British intelligence most of the activities of the German sabotage ring organized by Captain von Rintelen". One of the documents lost in the briefcase left on a New York tram was a letter that was leaked to the American press where Papen wrote to his wife: [...] "How splendid are things on the Eastern Front. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>say</b> to these idiotic Yankees that they should shut their mouths, or better still, express their admiration for all that heroism". The American press hounded Papen on his [...] "idiotic Yankees" [...] remark, and during a visit to San Francisco, Papen told a journalist that he only meant certain New York newspapers were [...] "idiotic", not the American people in general, claiming that American media were out to defame him, a statement that only made matters worse for him as any reading of his letter clearly did not support that interpretation. Unknown to Papen, the British had broken the German diplomatic codes, and in late 1915 presented the American government with intercepts of messages showing that Papen had been raising a [...] "legion" [...] for the invasion of Canada; was involved in acts of sabotage and plans for sabotage all over Canada, the United States and Mexico; and sundry other violations of American neutrality.|$|E
2500|$|On March 7, 2007, Rosselló {{stated that}} he was no longer {{interested}} in the Senate Presidency and then focused his attention in preventing Resident Commissioner Luis Fortuño from winning the March 2008 gubernatorial primary, and allowed his name to be placed in nomination for the party's gubernatorial primary. McClintock and four other senators won in San Juan Superior Court a suit to nullify the sanctions and expulsions that the party leadership has levied against them. The Puerto Rico Supreme Court confirmed the lower court decision by a 5-to-1 vote. As a result, McClintock and his supporters were recognized as NPP members and free to run under the party banner. [...] Shortly after the primary polls closed on March 9, 2008, Pedro Rosselló conceded the victory to Luis Fortuño after a large margin of votes in favor of his opponent in the NPP party primaries for the presidency of the party and gubernatorial nomination. Rosselló admitted defeat even before the votes were completely tallied claiming Fortuño as the next candidate of the PNP party. In Rosselló's conceding speech he said [...] "Luis Fortuño has been selected by the people to be the new president of this party and the candidate for governor. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>say</b> the people speak and I obey, Fortuño here is your party and here is your office (signaling the party's official headquarters). Now it's up to you, the loyal members of this party, {{to make sure that this}} new leadership works for statehood for Puerto Rico". After this conceding speech it was rumored and even announced at Fortuño's headquarters that the former Governor would arrive there along with his loyal supporter and mayor of the capital city of San Juan, Jorge Santini, but after Fortuño's followers waited for hours to see their leaders united neither Rosselló or Santini arrived. After the primary was over it was heavily rumored by many that Rosselló would not be campaigning for Fortuño and that he'd resign as senator to go back to his home in Virginia. On March 10, 2008, Rosselló sent the media a written statement regarding his future in which he confirmed he will be retiring from active politics and will not be campaigning for any candidate, however he would finish his term as senator for the Arecibo District, which he did.|$|E
