25|$|The {{availability}} and affordability of new consumer-level technology allowed {{many more people}} to get <b>involved</b> <b>into</b> VJing. The dramatic increase in computer processing power that became available facilitated more compact, yet often more complex setups, sometimes allowing VJs to bypass using a video mixer, using powerful computers running VJ software to control their mixing instead. However, many VJs continue to use video mixers with multiple sources, which allows flexibility {{for a wide range}} of input devices and a level of security against computer crashes or slowdowns in video playback due to overloading the CPU of computers due to the demanding nature of realtime video processing.|$|E
25|$|In 846, Muslim Arabs unsuccessfully {{stormed the}} city's walls, {{but managed to}} loot St. Peter's and St. Paul's basilica, both outside the city wall. After the decay of Carolingian power, Rome fell prey to feudal anarchy: several noble {{families}} kept fighting against the pope, the emperor and each other. These were the times of Theodora and her daughter Marozia, concubines and mothers of several popes, and of Crescentius, a powerful feudal lord, who fought against the Emperors Otto II and III. The scandals of this period pushed the papacy to reform itself: {{the election of the}} pope was reserved to the cardinals, and a reform of the clergy was attempted. The driving force behind this renewal was the monk Ildebrando da Soana, who once elected pope under the name of Gregory VII became <b>involved</b> <b>into</b> the Investiture Controversy against Emperor Henry IV. Subsequently, Rome was sacked and burned by the Normans of Robert Guiscard who had entered the city in support of the Pope, who was besieged in Castel S. Angelo.|$|E

25|$|Among tank units, {{equipped}} with the T-26, {{the actions of the}} 35th Light Tank Brigade (commander – colonel V.N. Kashuba, from January 1940 – colonel F.G. Anikushkin) were the most noteworthy. The brigade had 136 T-26 tanks of different models, 10 KhT-26 flame-throwing tanks and 3 ST-26 engineer tanks on 30 November 1939. In the beginning, the brigade was <b>involved</b> <b>into</b> combat for Kiviniemi and later it was redeployed to Hottinen area where its tanks, suffering high losses and shortage of repair facilities, supported the attacks of the 123rd and the 138th Rifle Divisions till the end of December. On 17 December 1939, Colonel V.N. Kashuba was heavily wounded while raised infantrymen hitting the dirt during the attack of Finnish defense line. In January tankers of the 35th Brigade evacuated and repaired their T-26s, practised in cooperation with artillery, engineer and rifle units (the last ones often retreated under enemy fire and left tanks alone), manufactured wooden fascines for trench crossing which were placed in special towed sleds. By the breakthrough of the main defensive positions of the Mannerheim Line, battalions of the brigade were attached to the 100th, the 113th and the 123rd Rifle Divisions.|$|E

Clearly not." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{spite of}} {{numerous}} past {{attempts to find}} the mutant that overacumulates protochlorophyllide under usual conditions, only one such gene (flu) is currently (2009) known. Flu (first described in [...] ) is a nuclear-encoded, chloroplast-located protein that appears containing only protein-protein interaction sites. It is currently not known which other proteins interact through this linker. The regulatory protein is a transmembrane protein that {{is located in the}} thylakoid membrane. Later, it was discovered that Tigrina mutants in barley, known a long time ago, are also mutated in the same gene. It is not obvious why no mutants of any other gene were observed; maybe mutations in other proteins, <b>involved</b> <b>into</b> the regulatory chain, are fatal. Flu is a single gene, {{not a member of the}} gene family.|$|E
2500|$|While Jerkins {{maintained}} {{his status as}} the album's executive producer, contributing most to its track listing with his team, Norwood also worked with regular collaborators Mike City and Keith Crouch, as well as Warryn [...] "Baby Dubb" [...] Campbell, Stuart Brawley, Jason Derlatka, and Jerkin's cousin Robert [...] "Big Bert" [...] Smith, with whom she became romantically involved during the project. In addition, she also recorded with Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo from The Neptunes. With Norwood fearing that the pair's material would not fit {{the concept of the}} album and break her type of production unit, it was left unused however. Rapper Ja Rule, singer Babyface and production duo Soulshock & Karlin were reportedly also <b>involved</b> <b>into</b> the project but none of their songs eventually made the album's final track listing.|$|E

That Lieutenant D'Hubert {{should be made to}} [...] "pay for it," [...] whatever it was, seemed to her just and natural. Her principal concern was that Lieutenant Feraud should not excite himself. He appeared so wholly admirable and fascinating to the humility of her heart that her only concern was to see him get well quickly even if it were only to resume his visits to Madame de Lionne's salon.|$|E
