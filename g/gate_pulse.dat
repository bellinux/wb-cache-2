50|$|The Wilkinson ADC was {{designed}} by D. H. Wilkinson in 1950. The Wilkinson ADC {{is based on the}} comparison of an input voltage with that produced by a charging capacitor. The capacitor is allowed to charge until its voltage is equal to the amplitude of the input pulse (a comparator determines when this condition has been reached). Then, the capacitor is allowed to discharge linearly, which produces a ramp voltage. At the point when the capacitor begins to discharge, a <b>gate</b> <b>pulse</b> is initiated. The <b>gate</b> <b>pulse</b> remains on until the capacitor is completely discharged. Thus the duration of the <b>gate</b> <b>pulse</b> is directly proportional to the amplitude of the input pulse. This <b>gate</b> <b>pulse</b> operates a linear gate which receives pulses from a high-frequency oscillator clock. While the gate is open, a discrete number of clock pulses pass through the linear gate and are counted by the address register. The time the linear gate is open is proportional to the amplitude of the input pulse, thus the number of clock pulses recorded in the address register is proportional also. Alternatively, the charging of the capacitor could be monitored, rather than the discharge.|$|E
