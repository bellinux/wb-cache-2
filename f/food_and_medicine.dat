Trucks transporting <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>medicine</b> from the Jalisco state government were forced to turn back because of flooded roads. The army then decided on an aerial transport. This effort was hampered because, after three federal helicopters and Air Force planes touched down at the local airport, the road into the city was still flooded, meaning the aid could not be distributed.|$|E
5|$|After Babs {{passed the}} hardest hit areas, workers were {{initially}} unable to distribute <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>medicine</b> due to ferry service being halted. Many provinces and islands were isolated after the storm, necessitating helicopter travel to be reached by national aid workers. The Department of Public Works and Highways worked quickly to clear the landslides and reopen closed roads. The country's National Food Authority provided about 73,000sacks of rice to storm victims, and the country planned to import 300,000tonnes of rice to overcome the lost crops.

5|$|The {{response}} {{to requests for}} international aid was moderate. American church groups, Cuba, and Mexico collectively contributed around 2,500tons of <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>medicine.</b> The Canadian, Swedish, West German, Spanish, and Dutch Governments contributed aid amounting to 2million dollars (1988) each. No aid was sent by the United States government. The Soviet Union contributed an unknown sum. The slow {{response to}} requests for aid was contributed to by the Sandinista Government's actions, which was viewed by a few anonymous diplomats from other countries who commented to the press, as undermining the peace process championed by Óscar Arias. Those actions were the July 10 arrests of opposition activists and the closing down of independent radio stations. In addition, the government also barred foreign humanitarian groups from receiving American aid, as well as turning back a relief shipment days before the storm.|$|E
5|$|Within {{two days}} of Phet's passage, most of the {{evacuees}} were allowed to return home. In Gwadar however, storm flooding caused shortages of <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>medicine,</b> leading to price increases. Balochistan Chief Minister Aslam Raisani allocated RS500million toward reconstructing damaged areas. The Sindh provincial government declared six districts as disaster areas. The government opened 214relief camps, with 160 in Karachi alone; these facilities also gave out food to storm victims. These relief camps were also opened in schools to service as temporary hospitals, with 24medical teams dispatched {{by the government to}} helped injured residents. The Pakistani military helped in search and rescue missions, and also traveled by air and sea to bring emergency blankets, tents, and medicine to damaged coastal towns. Responding to the storm damage, the Save the Children organization sent supplies to its Hyderabad office, including medical kits for two weeks of care for 8,000people, as well as 34,000water purification tablets. The International Red Cross's Disaster Relief Emergency Fund provided US$45,935 to support the Pakistan Red Crescent Society, which gave out 5,000mosquito nets, along with food and tents to affected families.|$|E
5|$|After the storm, the Nicaraguan {{government}} {{declared a}} state of disaster in the North and South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Regions, as well as Tisma in the Masaya Department. The government sheltered those made homeless in Bluefields along the Atlantic coast. Relief efforts were coordinated by the Comité Nacional de Emergencia to provide aid to the affected storm victims. Officials sent medical crews to the hardest hit areas. This was due to an increased potential for the spread of water-born diseases, the result of ongoing floods and damaged sanitation facilities. Meanwhile, planes flew overhead {{to determine the extent of}} damage. On August18, the government requested international assistance to cope from the disaster. In response, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the UNDP sent US$70,000 in emergency aid, some of which to be used for fuel to transport medicine and food. The World Food Programme sent 72tons of food and milk. The countries of Japan and the United States were the first to respond; the former provided $100,000, and the latter sent a Lockheed C-130 Hercules to distribute food. Switzerland later sent US$81,000 as a cash donation, while the European Economic Community sent US$227,000 worth of <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>medicine.</b> After Tropical Storm Gert struck in early September, various other countries sent additional money, food, medicine, and other goods.|$|E

From July 1971, she {{used to go to}} the hospital with <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>medicine</b> for the injured people of war. At that time there was an acute crisis of <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>medicine</b> in the hospital.

They would take the <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>medicine</b> to the freedom fighters. She was able to establish closer contact with the freedom fighters such as Abul Barak Alvi, Shafi Imam Rumi, Masud Sadek Chullu and Jwel in August. As the Pakistani army kept their strong watch on her, she would try to help the freedom fighters in different ways ignoring the risks. Except Abul Barak Alvi, all others died in the hand of the Pakistani Army. The Pakistan Army and their collaborators killed Sufia Kamal's son-in-law, Kahar Chowdhury, because they were very angry with her. Early December 1971 Shahidullah Kaiser, Munier Chowdhury and Dr. Fazle Rabbi cautioned her to leave Dhaka but they themselves did not leave and got caught and later got killed.|$|E
