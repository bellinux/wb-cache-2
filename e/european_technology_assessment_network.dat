It draws upon some of the data collected for the 'ETAN' (<b>European</b> <b>Technology</b> <b>Assessment</b> <b>Network)</b> report, Science Policies in the European Union: promoting excellence through mainstreaming gender equality, published recently by the European Commission. The data demonstrate how irrespective of discipline, proportion of female undergraduates in the discipline, and country, women leave scientific careers in disproportionate numbers at every stage, but particularly after the post-doctoral level. The article outlines three approaches to developing gender equality: equal treatment, positive action and gender mainstreaming, and shows how the position of women in science might be improved by the application of these three approaches by universities and research institutes. It concludes by asking some questions about whether more women at the top in science {{would make a difference}} to how science is done, what science is done and what is regarded as excellent in science...|$|E

40|$|Digitalization, {{automation}} {{and increasing}} robotisation in health care, industry and beyond, {{coupled with the}} advent of platform-based competitive mediation of work (crowdworking) – all impact on the future of work and labour. The associated challenges to the labour market, working conditions, wages, and the blurring boundary between private and professional life are the topic of intensive political and societal debate in many countries. Just take the conflicts surrounding Uber and AirBnB and their entry to traditional markets, as well as the vision of the so-called Internet of Things or cyber-physical systems, as the most prominent issues. <b>Technology</b> <b>assessment</b> (TA) always tries to be at the forefront of such debates. It is therefore not surprising that the member institutions of the <b>European</b> Parliamentary <b>Technology</b> <b>Assessment</b> (EPTA) <b>network</b> have already devoted a number of projects on labour issues related to digitalisation. The Annual EPTA Conference 2016 “The future of labour in the digital era: Ubiquitous computing, virtual platforms and real-time production” was thus devoted to this timely and exciting topic. This report continues a series of similar reports compiled by the respective presidency of the EPTA network.

40|$|In {{a market}} economy demands for {{commodities}} are met through various technologies and resources. Markets select the technologies and resources to meet these demands based on their costs. Over time, the competitiveness of different technologies can change due to the exhaustion of resources they depend on, the introduction of newer, more efficient technologies, or even shifts in user demands. As this happens, {{the structure of the}} economy changes. The Market Equilibrium and <b>Technology</b> <b>Assessment</b> <b>Network</b> Modelling System, META{center_dot}Net, has been developed for building and solving multi-period equilibrium models to analyze the shifts in the energy system that may occur as new technologies are introduced and resources are exhausted. META{center_dot}Net allows a user to build and solve complex economic models. It models` {{a market economy}} as a network of nodes representing resources, conversion processes, markets, and end-use demands. Commodities flow through this network from resources, through conversion processes and market, to the end-users. META{center_dot}Net then finds the multiperiod equilibrium prices and quantities. The solution includes the prices and quantities demanded for each commodity along with the capacity additions (and retirements) for each conversion process, and the trajectories of resource extraction. Although the changes in the economy are largely driven by consumers` behavior and the costs of technologies and resources, they are also affected by various government policies. These can include constraints on prices and quantities, and various taxes and constraints on environmental emissions. META{center_dot}Net can incorporate many of these mechanisms and evaluate their potential impact {{on the development of the}} economic system...|$|R

40|$|STOA, the <b>European</b> Parliament’s <b>technology</b> <b>assessment</b> body, and the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies {{recently}} organised {{a workshop}} on {{the impacts of}} the economic crisis on European health systems. Evidence {{of the impact of}} the recent financial crisis on health outcomes is only just beginning to emerge. Data suggests that this latest recession has led to more frequent poor health status, rising incidence of some communicable diseases, and higher suicide rates. Further, available data are likely to underestimate the broader mental health crisis linked to increased rates of stress, anxiety, and depression among the economically vulnerable. Not only does recession affect factors that determine health, but it also affects the financial capacity to respond. Many European governments have reduced public expenditure on health services during the financial crisis, while introducing or increasing user charges. The recession has driven structural reforms, and has affected the priority given to public policies that could be used to help protect population health. The current economic climate, while challenging, presents an opportunity for reforming and restructuring health promotion actions and taking a long-term perspective...|$|R
50|$|Since 2007, Congress has {{established}} a permanent TA function within GAO. This new operational role augments GAO’s performance audits related to S&T issues, including effectiveness and efficiency of U.S. federal programs. In 2010, GAO joined <b>European</b> Parliamentary <b>Technology</b> <b>Assessment</b> (EPTA) as an associate member. In the last three years, GAO has completed TA reports on three topics, the most recent one being released in 2011 - rail security, climate engineering, and alternate neutron detectors. In the climate engineering report, Congress requested GAO to examine three areas: the current S&T state of climate engineering, views of experts {{on the future of}} climate engineering research, and potential public responses to climate engineering. When the GAO receives a request to conduct TA, it follows five phases: Acceptance, Planning, Data Gathering and Analysis, Product development and Distribution and Results. Phases one and two include selecting the topic and initiating the TA plan while the other ones are respectively: conducting TA, followed by developing the report and ensuring its accuracy and integrity, and finally receiving feedback from Congress and developing lessons learned to enhance the TA process.|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to identify the possible barriers and critical success factors for the implementation of European collaboration in the field of relative effectiveness assessment (REA) of drugs. MethodsData were gathered through semi-structured interviews with representatives from eight <b>European</b> health <b>technology</b> <b>assessment</b> (HTA) organisations involved in assessment of drugs for coverage decision-making (AAZ, AIFA, AHTAPol, HAS, HVB, IQWIG, NICE and ZiN). ResultsPotential barriers identified mainly relate to methodology, resources and challenges with implementation in the respective national processes (e. g. legal restrictions). The most critical success factors for production of cross-border assessments were the continuous cooperation of competent partners, and the quality and timely availability of the assessment. ConclusionFurther adaptation of the process and methods is required for optimal collaboration. In the near future it can be expected that cross-border assessments will meet in particular the needs of smaller/middle-sized European countries and also European countries with less developed HTA systems as the potential efficiency/quality gains are the highest for these countries. Therefore, national implementation of cross-border assessments is especially likely in these countries in the coming years. Once more experience is gained with cross-border assessments, and successes become more evident, efficiency/quality gains may also be likely for some larger countries with well established processes...|$|R

40|$|Background In many {{healthcare}} systems, affordability concerns {{can lead}} to restrictions {{on the use of}} expensive efficacious therapies. However, there {{does not appear to be}} any consensus as to the terminology used to describe affordability, or the thresholds used to determine whether new drugs are affordable. Objectives The aim of this systematic review was to investigate how affordability is defined and measured in healthcare. Methods MEDLINE, EMBASE and EconLit databases (2005 -July 2016) were searched using terms covering affordability and budget impact, combined with definitions, thresholds and restrictions, to identify articles describing a definition of affordability with respect to new medicines. Additional definitions were identified through citation searching, and through manual searches of <b>European</b> health <b>technology</b> <b>assessment</b> body websites. Results In total, 27 definitions were included in the review. Of these, five definitions described affordability in terms of the value of a product; seven considered affordability within the context of healthcare system budgets; and 15 addressed whether products are affordable in a given country based on economic factors. However, there was little in the literature to indicate that the price of medicines is considered alongside both their value to individual patients and their budget impact at a population level. Conclusions Current methods of assessing affordability in healthcare may be limited by their focus on budget impact. A more effective approach may involve a broader perspective than is currently described in the literature, to consider the long-term benefits of a therapy and cost savings elsewhere in the healthcare system, as well as cooperation between healthcare payers and the pharmaceutical industry to develop financing models that support sustainability as well as innovation...|$|R

40|$|By today’s {{standards}} it is {{not much}} more than a surprisingly small, yellow and black lacquered plywood box. But in the 1840 ’s, drawn by ve horses, it grandly ushered in a new era, putting Switzerland at the crossroads of major transport corridors in Europe and thereby reshaping the country’s geographic, polit- ical and social contexts: The rst stagecoach negotiating the hair-raising hairpin turns of the then newly opened road over the Gotthard pass. As in many industrialized countries, the transport system in Switzerland has since evolved with ever increasing speed. Not just in the Gotthard region, where in 1882, the pass road was outclassed by the opening of the railway tunnel. Almost exactly one hundred years later, the motorway tunnel started oper- ating, dwarfed today by the rail base tunnel whose 57 km make it the world’s longest tunneling project. <b>Technology</b> <b>Assessment</b> (TA) is well-placed to know that such technological feats entail op- portunities as well as risks. Greater mobility, better means of communication and improved transport systems have to be balanced with ever increasing numbers of infrastructure users, traf c congestion, pollution and environmental impacts as well as exploding costs in nancial as well as social terms. By furnishing independent and credible analyses, TA provides policy options intended to guide technolog- ical developments for the good of society. This report provides an overview of mobility pricing in different countries as well as their plan to tackle the challenge of managing mobility in the near future. It is part of a series of similar reports compiled every year by the respective presidency of the EPTA network. As in previous editions, it is a col- lection of contributions written from the perspectives of different full and associate members of EPTA. As such, it can be read as a stand alone survey of the transport policy situation in a number of industri- alized countries, but it also provides an information basis for the issues addressed by the international EPTA conference “Shaping the Future of Mobility” hosted by TA-SWISS in the Swiss Transport Museum in Lucerne on November 8, 2017 – by the way, Switzerland’s most popular museum.
