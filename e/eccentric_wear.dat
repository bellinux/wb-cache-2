In order to analyze the cause of <b>eccentric</b> <b>wear</b> based on the upper-convected Maxwell model, the flow equation of viscoelastic fluid in eccentric annulus was established in cylinder coordinate system. Then the equation was transformed in bipolar coordinate system and dispersed by control-volume method. The velocity distribution was solved by ADI methods and example was calculated which provides theory basis for solving <b>eccentric</b> <b>wear</b> problems...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Because {{of complex}} flow characteristics, polymer {{flooding}} produced liquid can bring many {{problems such as}} serious <b>eccentric</b> <b>wear</b> of rod and tube, breaking and divorcing of rod, and shortened cycle of pump-check. Flow resistance experiment was carried out aimed at these problems. Experimental results show that on-way resistance that sucker rod acts on polymer flooding produced liquid mainly depends on the viscosity of liquid and its elasticity can be ignored; Local resistance caused by couplers and centralizers is mainly related to the velocity of produced liquid, while the effect brought by mass concentration can be neglected; Resistance that pump valve endued and rate of flow agree to the exponential law; Total resistance of pump valves is generated mainly by down-valve and the law of resistance that water and polymer solution act on valves are similar. The problems that <b>eccentric</b> <b>wear</b> of rods and tubes is serious and the cycle of pump-check is shortened are not completely caused by up stress increasing after polymer flooding...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn recent years, {{with the}} {{increasing}} of the directional wells or high angle wells, and the growing of containing water of oil wells, the problem of <b>eccentric</b> <b>wears</b> is becoming more seriously and restricting the normal production of oilfield. Self-lubricating tubing with anti-wear and anti-corrosion coating was invented, based on {{the analysis of the}} mechanism of <b>eccentric</b> <b>wears.</b> The coating microstructure was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The corrosion resistance was evaluated by the Cortest high temperature and pressure autoclave. The wear resistance was analyzed by the MG- 200 wear tester. The results show that the microstructure of the coating is fine and netted. The coating is no impurities and good integrity. The problem of softening, blistering, or loose was not found after 168 h corrosion tests under the high temperature and pressure conditions. In addition, the adhesive ability of the coating can meet the industry standard 1. The coating is 5 times the corrosion resistance of N 80 tubing. And the friction coefficient is 75. 79 % lower than that of N 80 tubing. The wear resistance of N 80 tubing is increased by 29. 3 times. So the coating can play dual role of friction-reducing and anti-wear. According to oilfield application results, the technology can solve the problem of <b>eccentric</b> <b>wears</b> and extend significantly the period of well-repair according...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{analyzes}} {{the stress of}} the pick-shaped cutter of rotary cutting machine in process of tunnel excavation in soft and hard interbedded formation, results show that the resistance of pick is obviously jumping fluctuations comparing to that of homogeneous formation. When pick transits from cutting hard rock to soft rock, cutting resistance and driving resistance of pick decrease instantaneously, which leads to momentary decreasing of rotation torque. And mud ball is compacted by high impact force of rotary cutting machine when cutting hard rock strata, as a consequence, resistance torque increases. When the sum of resistance torque and starting torque is greater than rotation torque, pick can`t rotate, leading to <b>eccentric</b> <b>wear</b> of pick.

40|$|International audienceHypothesis The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to improve our understanding of the pathogenesis and symptoms of ganglion cysts (GCs) in the spinoglenoid notch. Two hypotheses were tested: (1) the labral tears responsible for these cysts are mainly degenerative and nontraumatic, (2) spinoglenoid cysts are early magnetic resonance image (MRI) markers of <b>eccentric</b> posterior glenoid <b>wear.</b> Materials and methods This was a descriptive diagnostic study. Patients were included when a spinoglenoid cyst was discovered after complaints of pain in the posterosuperior aspect of the shoulder. MRI and arthroscopy were used to classify the glenoid GC and characterize the glenohumeral joint. The GCs were classified into 1 of 3 types: GC 0 (isolated cyst), GC 1 (cyst and associated labral lesion), and GC 2 (cyst and associated labral and cartilage lesion). Results Twenty patients (average age, 43 years) were included between 2000 and 2014. There were 7 GC 0, 8 GC 1, and 5 GC 2 type cysts. Isolated labral tears (GC 1) were always located posteriorly, without anterior extension or glenoid detachment. The humeral subluxation index was above 55 % in 75 % of shoulders, including all of the type GC 2 shoulders. The 5 GC 2 shoulders had type B 1, B 2, or C glenoids. Conclusions The management of paraglenoid labral cysts must go beyond addressing the suprascapular nerve compression related to traumatic labral detachment, and surgeons should look automatically for associated degenerative joint damage. The diagnosis of GCs should be supplemented by humeral subluxation index measurement on computed tomography scan or MRI, and the patient should be informed that joint-related posterior shoulder pain might persist in cases of GC 1 and GC 2.
