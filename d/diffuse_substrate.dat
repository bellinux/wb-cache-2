Using a combination of dissolved nutrient ratios, nutrient <b>diffusing</b> <b>substrates,</b> and benthic productivity responses to nutrient supplementation, we evaluated whether nitrogen (N) or phosphorus (P) limited periphyton productivity near Kigoma, Tanzania, during the dry seasons of 2001 and 2002. The relative effects of grazers and nutrients on periphyton were quantified by manipulating grazer access to nutrient <b>diffusing</b> <b>substrates.</b> We found very low ambient concentrations of inorganic N and soluble reactive P, but generally higher concentrations of dissolved organic nutrients. Nutrient <b>diffusing</b> <b>substrates</b> indicated a shift from P limitation in 2001 to co-limitation by N and P in 2002, probably {{as a consequence of}} unusual coastal upwelling in 2002. Productivity responses of natural epilithic algae to nutrient supplementation also indicated N–P co-limitation in 2002. However, fish and other large grazers had much stronger effects on periphyton than nutrients. Grazers strongly suppressed periphyton biomass, but had weaker negative effects on area-specific gross primary productivity as a result of large increases in biomass-specific gross primary productivity.

Assuming a density of the phosphor of 4.56  g/cm 3 as it is typical for Ce-YAG based systems [34] and of 0.96  g/cm 3, which is an order of range value for PDMS [35], the required amounts of phosphor for the three globe-top radii in case of the <b>diffuse</b> <b>substrate</b> are given by 0.00048  g (1  mm), 0.00171  g (2  mm) and 0.00378  g (3  mm) for a CIE x value of 0.33 as well as 0.00079  g (1  mm), 0.00272  g (2  mm) and 0.00592  g (3  mm) {{in the case of a}} CIE x value of 0.38.

Field experiments were conducted to determine the effects of 2, 4 -D and glyphosate on biofilms in a pond next to agricultural land in Athabasca, Alberta. <b>Diffusing</b> <b>substrates</b> consisted of specimen jars filled with agar that contained low levels of nitrogen and phosphorus, and different concentrations (15, 9. 0, 1. 5 mM) of either 2, 4 -D or glyphosate.

The model {{relies on the}} laws of geometrical optics and on {{a description of the}} multiple reflection–transmission of light between the different layers and interfaces. The highly complex multiple reflection–transmission process occurring between several superposed layers is described by Markov chains. An optical element such as a layer or an interface forms a biface. The multiple reflection–transmission process is developed for a superposition of two bifaces. We obtain general composition formulas for the reflectance and the transmittance of a pair of layers and/or interfaces. Thanks to these compositional expressions, we can calculate the reflectance and the transmittance of three or more superposed bifaces. The model is applicable to regular compositions of bifaces, i. e., multifaces having on each face an angular light distribution that remains constant along successive reflection and transmission events.

In this paper, we investigate the gettering effectiveness of light phosphorus diffu-sions for removing Fe impurities, applied on an underlying boron diffusion, similar to the buried emitter concept, as an option for achieving effective gettering on boron <b>diffused</b> <b>substrates.</b> Our ex-perimental results on monocrystalline silicon samples demonstrate that the underlying boron diffusion does not affect the gettering effectiveness of the phosphorus diffusion, even though much of the phosphorus diffused region is overdoped by the boron diffusion. Furthermore, we investigate the gettering effectiveness of low sur-face concentration phosphorus diffusions that can result in reduced recombination in the n+ region. Our results show that the gettering effectiveness decreases when the surface phosphorus concentration is reduced, either through manipulating the deposition gas flows or through subsequent driving in.

40|$|Stream {{ecosystems}} {{are influenced by}} environmental factors that occur {{at a variety of}} scales (Minshall 1988). Biological monitoring within the Minnesota River Assessment project has focused on comparisons of large watersheds in relation to fish and invertebrate communities. The primary objectives of the present study were to make a preliminary evaluation of benthic algal communities that exist among several representative streams in the Minnesota watershed and to attempt to identify limiting features to their abundance and productivity. Algal communities play an important role within stream systems due to their importance to invertebrates and fish as food, as moderators of ambient nutrient concentrations, and as indicators of stream condition. Stream periphyton communities can be limited by a variety of factors including light (Mclntire et al. 1964, Hill and Knight 1988), nutrients (Patrick 1966, Pringle and Bowers 1984), and turbidity (Munn et al. 1989).

The lakes were all phosphorus poor and spanned a gradient of dissolved organic carbon availability. Ag slowly accumulated in the exposed periphyton, which decreased periphyton carbon and chlorophyll a content and increased periphyton C:P and N:P in the carbon rich lakes. We found significant interactions between AgNP and P treatments on periphyton carbon, autotroph standing crop and periphyton stoichiometry in the carbon poor lake such that P enhanced the negative effects of AgNPs on chlorophyll a and lessened the impact of AgNP exposure on periphyton stoichiometry. Our results contrast with those of other studies demonstrating that P addition decreases metal toxicity for phytoplankton, suggesting that benthic and pelagic primary producers may react differently to AgNP exposure and highlighting the importance of in situ assays when assessing potential effects of AgNPs in fresh waters...|$|R

Our study explored how the relative balance of autotrophic and heterotrophic constituents in stream biofilms influences nutrient limitation at sixteen sites in three urban watersheds in Utah. We measured nutrient limitation with nutrient <b>diffusing</b> <b>substrates</b> containing nitrogen (NH 4 -N), phosphorus (PO 4 -P), both nitrogen and phosphorus, or no nutrients. Biofilm responses to nutrient additions were measured as chlorophyll a (autotrophs) and ash-free dry mass (autotrophs + heterotrophs). Nutrient additions affected chlorophyll levels at ten sites. Most commonly, autotrophs were co-limited by N and P (three sites) or primarily limited by N and secondarily limited by P (three sites). Nutrient additions suppressed chlorophyll levels at four sites. Nutrient additions affected ash-free dry mass at only three sites, suppressing biomass at two sites, and increasing biomass at one site. At a given site, chlorophyll a and ash-free dry mass never had the same response to nutrient additions. These preliminary results indicate autotrophs and heterotrophs respond differently to nutrient additions.

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate what factors determine algal growth in Swedish headwater streams. Nutrients, in terms of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), and light are factors known to affect algal growth. By using nutrient <b>diffusing</b> <b>substrate</b> (NDS) and different gradients of light, it was possible to test the importance of these factors. To determine the effect of the experiment, the study was carried out in a forested reference stream, which is largely shaded with extreme low nutrient levels, and in a stream running through a clear-cutting plantation with high nutrient levels and incident light. In the forested reference stream it became clear that algal growth increased by experimentally adding N (P< 0. 005), although light did not affect the productivity. In the stream running through the clear-cut, algal productivity increased significantly with higher levels of light (P< 0. 005), regardless of nutrient addition. The results from this study suggest that light only becomes the depending factor when sufficient amounts of nutrients are available. However, it is still unclear at what nutrient levels this shift occur, and therefore future research is recommended...|$|R

By the way, the microbial ecology of cheese in the sense of “microorganisms real life within cheese” has been much less investigated.

This thesis presents two studies aimed at increasing the utility of periphyton analysis as a tool for water resource managers to address eutrophication. In the first study, artificial channels were used to investigate the response of periphyton to different nutrient delivery mechanisms. In two channels, nutrients were delivered via diffusion to periphyton growth surfaces using modified Matlock Periphytometers. In two additional channels, nutrients were delivered by dosing water in the channel. The data showed that nutrient delivery via diffusion elicits a significantly greater periphyton response. The use of <b>diffusing</b> <b>substrates</b> for periphyton studies remains a viable tool for some objectives, but results should be extrapolated to natural conditions with caution. In the second study, modified Matlock Periphytometers and inexpensive light meters were used to investigate the relationship between periphyton growth and light availability in two fourth-order Texas streams. The data indicate that light availability explains 91. 9 percent of the variability of observed periphyton growth under control conditions, and 99. 7 percent under nutrient-enriched conditions. The strong correlation suggests that efforts to address eutrophication should recognize the importance of riparian shade.

Harbored in these meltwater streambeds are diatom communities, which {{are part of}} a {{microbial}} mat matrix. These mat assemblages endure desiccating winters and become reactivated upon rehydration during the austral summer. Water is considered the major limiting resource in the dry valley stream ecosystems, and the variable flow of meltwater has been shown to regulate the biomass and growth of these algal mats. However, other environmental variables could influence the structure of these mat communities. In this thesis, the influences of nutrients are examined as a regulatory control on diatom community structure. This thesis draws from previous experimentation using Nutrient <b>Diffusing</b> <b>Substrates</b> (NDS) with nitrate and phosphate amendments that were left in Green Creek for algae to colonize. Characterization of diatom communities that grew on NDS units showed that nitrate enrichments significantly altered diatom relative abundance, with an increase in Fistulifera pelliculosa to 21 % relative abundance in nitrate treatments compared to other nutrient amendments, which had less than 5 % F. pelliculosa abundance. Other nutrient amendments showed only a marginal influence on diatom relative abundance. In addition, nitrate and phosphate amendments showed greater average diatom densities relative to the control treatments, with the greatest densities occurring in nitrate amendments. These results suggest that nutrients influence diatom growth and accrual, although stream hydrology and geomorphology likely have a greater influence on regulating the structure of these diatom communities within the microbial mat matrix. Moreover, the results from this thesis can help to predict the response by diatom communities to expected landscape changes in McMurdo Dry Valley streams as a function of climate change, such as increase flow and subsequent nutrient enrichment...|$|R

Nutrient <b>diffusing</b> <b>substrates</b> (NDS) containing four nutrient treatments (C, N, P, N+P) {{were placed in the}} rivers for a 9 d incubation period. Upon retrieval, each NDS was analyzed for remaining nutrient content of the agar, periphyton accumulation (determined by chlorophyll a extraction), organic content (AFDM) of adhering materials, and macroinvertebrate colonization. NDS that were incubated in streams for 9 d were analyzed for residual nutrient content in spring and autumn. Spring samples retained more nutrients than autumn samples. To determine the distributional pattern of nutrients within the agar of the NDS, samples were removed and divided into three segments. No significant variation in vertical distribution of nutrients was detected within the agar of NDS. In spring, chlorophyll a values were consistently higher in agricultural rivers than in forested ones regardless of nutrient treatment. Significantly more Orthocladius and Dicrotendipes, colonized NDS in agricultural than forested rivers in spring. In the autumn, there was a significant interaction between land use and nitrogen for AFDM values obtained in the autumn. There were significantly more Tanytarsus, Dicrotendipes, and Caenis in the autumn than in the spring. Significantly more Tanytarsus, and Caenis colonized NDS that were incubated in agricultural than forested rivers. In summary, the nutrients that were added to agar in NDS remained stable over the duration of 256 d freezer storage, were retained in NDS after incubation in rivers, and did not segregate vertically. Periphyton and chironomid (Orthocladius, Dicrotendipes in the spring, Tanytarsus in the autumn) colonization were higher on NDS incubated in agricultural rivers than forested rivers.

40|$|The {{development}} of fully-implantable therapeutic and diagnostic devices represents {{a new paradigm}} in biomedical device design. However, designing materials that can perform as injectable matrices for the delivery of sensing and therapeutics chemistries while retaining control over sensor and drug release behaviors is a complex problem. The novel material described herein, microporous alginate composite (MPAC), allows for controllable in situ gelation?and hence enables injection?as well as encapsulation of functional elements such as sensing chemistries or therapeutics. As this material has never been described before, individual component materials, bulk mechanical and gelation properties, and sensing composite response characteristics were examined. The use of polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMs) in fabrication of MPACs resulted in a porous composite in which macromolecules and nanoparticles were retained within the pores, while allowing for free movement of these materials. Entrapped enzyme molecules were shown to react with <b>diffusing</b> <b>substrates</b> from outside the matrix, confirming the ability of materials from within the pores to interact with small molecules in the local environment. Increasing numbers of PEMs used in composite fabrication was found to result in increased gelation times of hydrogels, while increasing particle concentration reduced gelation times. Changes in pH during MPAC gelation was also dependent on microsphere concentration and PEM numbers. After gelation, MPAC hydrogels immersed in water displayed complex swelling and stiffening behavior dependent on particle concentration and PEM numbers. Oxygen-sensing MPAC hydrogels displayed minor PEM-dependent behavior, while glucose-sensing MPAC hydrogels displayed strong dependence on concentration and PEM numbers. As concentrations increased, sensitivities increased and analytical ranges decreased indicating cooperative behavior among enzyme-containing pores. Utilizing low permeability nanofilms, sensitivities and ranges of sensors could be modulated based upon the number of layers used in fabrication. The {{development of}} this new composite system architecture permits an added level of control over injectable hydrogel physical and functional properties such as gelation time and sensor response characteristics. This added control could broaden the usage of alginate as an injectable material and {{lead to the development}} of a wide variety of new functional injectable devices...|$|R
