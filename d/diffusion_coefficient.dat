5|$|Where ν and Ediff are as {{described}} above, Γ is the jump or hopping rate, T is temperature, and kB is the Boltzmann constant. Ediff must be {{smaller than the}} energy of desorption for diffusion to occur, otherwise desorption processes would dominate. Importantly, equation 1 tells us how very strongly the jump rate varies with temperature. The manner in which diffusion takes place {{is dependent on the}} relationship between Ediff and kBT as is given in the thermodynamic factor: when Ediff < kBT the thermodynamic factor approaches unity and Ediff ceases to be a meaningful barrier to diffusion. This case, known as mobile diffusion, is relatively uncommon and has only been observed in a few systems. For the phenomena described throughout this article, it is assumed that Ediff >> kBT and therefore Γ << ν. In the case of Fickian diffusion it is possible to extract both the ν and Ediff from an Arrhenius plot of the logarithm of the <b>diffusion</b> <b>coefficient,</b> D, versus 1/T. For cases where more than one diffusion mechanism is present (see below), there may be more than one Ediff such that the relative distribution between the different processes would change with temperature.|$|E

Quasi-linear perpendicular velocity <b>diffusion</b> <b>coefficients</b> are used to describe the effect of wave-particle interactions, therefore it is essential to determine the correct <b>diffusion</b> <b>coefficients</b> that must be used to model the outflow of ions. In this study a Monte Carlo method is used to assess the role of different <b>diffusion</b> <b>coefficients</b> for O+ and H+ ions at high altitudes above the polar cap. Two different sets of <b>diffusion</b> <b>coefficients</b> obtained from Barghouthi [1997]; Barghouthi et al. [1998] and Nilsson et al. [2013] are used. Barghouthi [1997]; Barghouthi et al. [1998] used spectral density measurements from Dynamic Explorer 1 spacecraft (DE- 1) observations to calculate the <b>diffusion</b> <b>coefficients,</b> while Nilsson et al.

Also <b>diffusion</b> <b>coefficients</b> from Cluster spectral density measurements produce reasonable results for high altitudes and unreasonably low parallel velocities and temperatures for the low altitude region.

25|$|There are {{two parts}} to Einstein's theory: {{the first part}} {{consists}} {{in the formulation of}} a diffusion equation for Brownian particles, in which the <b>diffusion</b> <b>coefficient</b> is related to the mean squared displacement of a Brownian particle, while the second part consists in relating the <b>diffusion</b> <b>coefficient</b> to measurable physical quantities. In this way Einstein was able to determine the size of atoms, and how many atoms there are in a mole, or the molecular weight in grams, of a gas. In accordance to Avogadro's law this volume is the same for all ideal gases, which is 22.414 liters at standard temperature and pressure. The number of atoms contained in this volume is referred to as Avogadro's constant, and the determination of this number is tantamount to the knowledge of the mass of an atom since the latter is obtained by dividing the mass of a mole of the gas by Avogadro's constant.|$|E
25|$|Diffusion is a {{fundamental}} physical phenomenon, which Einstein characterized as Brownian motion, that describes the random thermal movement of molecules and small particles in gases and liquids. It is an important phenomenon for small distances (it {{is essential for the}} achievement of thermodynamic equilibria), but, as the time necessary to cover a distance by diffusion is proportional to the square of the distance itself, it is ineffective for spreading a solute over macroscopic distances. The <b>diffusion</b> <b>coefficient,</b> D, is typically quite small, and its effect can often be considered negligible (unless groundwater flow velocities are extremely low, as they are in clay aquitards).|$|E
500|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} has {{a higher}} <b>diffusion</b> <b>coefficient</b> compared to oxygen and the only enzyme {{in the human body}} that produces carbon monoxide is heme oxygenase which is located in all cells and breaks down heme. Under normal conditions carbon monoxide levels in the plasma are approximately 0 mmHg because it {{has a higher}} <b>diffusion</b> <b>coefficient</b> and the body easily gets rid of any CO made. [...] When CO is not ventilated it binds to hemoglobin, which is the principal oxygen-carrying compound in blood; this produces a compound known as carboxyhemoglobin. The traditional belief is that carbon monoxide toxicity arises from the formation of carboxyhemoglobin, which decreases the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood and inhibits the transport, delivery, and utilization of oxygen by the body. The affinity between hemoglobin and carbon monoxide is approximately 230 times stronger than the affinity between hemoglobin and oxygen so hemoglobin binds to carbon monoxide in preference to oxygen.|$|E
40|$|The need {{to update}} the <b>diffusion</b> <b>coefficients</b> stems from the {{theoretical}} understanding that the repulsive part of the Lennard-Jones (L-J) 12 - 6 potential function is too stiff to accurately account for <b>diffusion</b> <b>coefficients</b> at high temperatures [1]. Replacing the repulsive part of the potential by a softer, exponential function led {{to an increase in}} most of the <b>diffusion</b> <b>coefficients</b> involving H and H 2 [1] from those predicted by the Sandia Transport subroutine library [2]. Recent studies [3, 4] showed that even the exponential function may be too restricted and suggested that the <b>diffusion</b> <b>coefficients</b> of key pairs be directly modeled without resorting to the use of tabulated L-J 12 - 6 collision integrals. In this work an update for <b>diffusion</b> <b>coefficients</b> is provided for selected pairs.

In this study, non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulation was applied to calculate mutual <b>diffusion</b> <b>coefficients</b> from the molecular flux at a given concentration gradient.

The simulated self- and tracer <b>diffusion</b> <b>coefficients</b> of both components were in good agreement with literature data except in the case that methane molar fraction was nearly equal to zero.
