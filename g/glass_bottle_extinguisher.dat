5000|$|<b>Glass</b> <b>bottles</b> and <b>glass</b> jars {{are in many}} {{households}} {{around the}} world. The first <b>glass</b> <b>bottles</b> were produced in south east Asia around 100 BCE, and in the Roman Empire around 1 AD. America's <b>glass</b> <b>bottle</b> and <b>glass</b> jar industry {{was born in the}} early 1600s, when settlers in Jamestown built the first glass melting furnace. The invention of the automatic <b>glass</b> <b>bottle</b> blowing machine in 1880 industrialized the process of making bottles.|$|R
50|$|Between 1919 and 1967 a large <b>glass</b> <b>bottling</b> factory {{operated}} by the United <b>Glass</b> <b>Bottle</b> Manufacturers {{was based on the}} site.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>glass</b> <b>bottle</b> is a <b>bottle</b> {{created from}} <b>glass.</b> <b>Glass</b> <b>bottles</b> can vary in size considerably, but are most {{commonly}} found in sizes ranging between about 10ml and 5 litres. Common uses for <b>glass</b> <b>bottles</b> include food condiments, soda, liquor, cosmetics, pickling and preservatives. These types of bottles are utilitarian and serve a purpose in commercial industries.|$|R
50|$|The soda {{was also}} {{produced}} in <b>glass</b> <b>bottles,</b> which carried {{the same image}} {{that is on the}} can today. The <b>glass</b> <b>bottled</b> root beer was not as popular as the canned products.|$|R
50|$|Meadow Fresh was {{the last}} company in New Zealand to produce milk in <b>glass</b> <b>bottles.</b> On 30 November 2005, {{production}} of <b>glass</b> <b>bottled</b> milk at their Christchurch production plant ceased, ending this era.|$|R
2500|$|Heinz {{introduced}} its octagonal <b>glass</b> <b>bottle</b> {{for the first}} time in 1889; the bottle was patented in 1890. While other <b>glass</b> <b>bottle</b> designs have existed, the octagonal <b>glass</b> <b>bottle</b> is still in use and is considered an [...] "iconic" [...] example of package design. In the United States, the <b>glass</b> <b>bottle</b> commonly used by restaurants holds [...] of ketchup. A small bottle containing about [...] of ketchup also exists for hotel room service and other situations where it is desirable to serve individual meals with a more personal or luxurious presentation than might be perceived with the foil or plastic packets associated with fast food dining.|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of ascorbic acid, beta-carotene and alpha-tocopherol contents was assessed during {{the storage of}} a fortified juice packed in PET or <b>glass</b> <b>bottles.</b> During the course of storage, oxygen transfer rates and partial oxygen pressures were evaluated {{as well as the}} vitamins. During the first month, a decrease of dissolved oxygen was observed for both PET and <b>glass</b> <b>bottles.</b> A strong degradation of ascorbic acid was noted after 3 months of storage (up to 54 at 72 % in <b>glass</b> and PET <b>bottles</b> respectively) and the beta-carotene content was virtually nil after 80 days. The ascorbic acid degradation was clearly stronger in PET comparing to <b>glass</b> <b>bottles</b> while no difference was observed for beta-carotene between both packaging. However, beta-carotene isomers (13 -cis-beta-carotene and 9 -cis-beta-carotene) were identified and their total concentrations were higher in <b>glass</b> <b>bottles.</b> The degradation reaction scheme of beta-carotene seems to be mainly oxidation in PET bottles and isomerisation and then oxidation in <b>glass</b> <b>bottles.</b> Concerning tocopherol, its limited oxidation may be explained by regenerative action of ascorbic acid. From a nutritional point of view, the juice packed in <b>glass</b> <b>bottles</b> is more interesting since beta-carotene isomers still have pro-vitamin activity...|$|R

50|$|Containers {{thereafter}} {{continued to}} develop along with related advances in human technology, {{and with the}} development of new materials and new means of manufacture. Early <b>glass</b> <b>bottles</b> were produced by the Phoenicians; specimens of Phoenician translucent and transparent <b>glass</b> <b>bottles</b> have been found in Cyprus and Rhodes generally varying in length from three to six inches. These Phoenician examples from the first millennium BC were thought to have been used to contain perfume. The Romans learned glass-making from the Phoenicians and produced many extant examples of fine <b>glass</b> <b>bottles,</b> mostly relatively small. By the beginning of the eighteenth century, sizes for retail containers such as <b>glass</b> <b>bottles</b> had become standardized for their markets.|$|R

25|$|Cradle-to-cradle is a {{specific}} kind of cradle-to-grave assessment, where the end-of-life disposal step for the product is a recycling process. It is a method used to minimize {{the environmental impact of}} products by employing sustainable production, operation, and disposal practices and aims to incorporate social responsibility into product development. From the recycling process originate new, identical products (e.g., asphalt pavement from discarded asphalt pavement, <b>glass</b> <b>bottles</b> from collected <b>glass</b> <b>bottles),</b> or different products (e.g., glass wool insulation from collected <b>glass</b> <b>bottles).</b>|$|R
50|$|As with pint glasses, {{the main}} {{solution}} to <b>glassing</b> with <b>bottles</b> {{is not to}} dispense <b>glass</b> <b>bottles</b> where there is risk of fights or accidents, most simply either using plastic <b>glasses</b> or plastic <b>bottles</b> (or aluminum cans).|$|R

40|$|An {{explosive}} {{can cause}} a huge fracture of energy at low doses. A small 'cullet' was generated by using this energy to crush a <b>glass</b> <b>bottle,</b> and the recycling efficiency improvement was examined. Up to now, {{the influence of the}} cullet sizes against the amount of explosive, the distance from the explosive to the <b>glass</b> <b>bottles</b> and the bottle arrangement have been studied. During this time, the fracture phenomenon of the <b>glass</b> <b>bottle</b> by an underwater shockwave has been analysed with a high-speed camera and FEM simulation...|$|R

5000|$|By {{the early}} 20th century {{machines}} developed {{the ability to}} perform more complex operations {{that had previously been}} done by skilled craftsmen. [...] An example is the <b>glass</b> <b>bottle</b> making machine developed 1905.

2500|$|In 1892, the [...] "Crown Cork Bottle Seal" [...] was {{patented}} by William Painter, a Baltimore, Maryland machine shop operator.
