40|$|A novel {{surgical}} treatment sequence for secondary orbitozygomatic complex (OZC) reconstruction is described. Orbital reconstruction is performed before OZC repositioning. A surgical plan is made: the affected OZC is virtually osteotomized and aligned with a mirrored {{model of the}} unaffected OZC. A patient-specific implant (PSI) is designed for orbital reconstruction. <b>Screw</b> <b>holes</b> from the primary reconstruction are used for fixation. Primary <b>screw</b> <b>hole</b> positions at the repositioned OZC are embedded in the design, to guide OZC repositioning. A second patient-specific design is made for guidance at the zygomaticomaxillary buttress. The workflow was utilized in two patients. The PSI was positioned using navigation feedback. After repositioning of the zygomatic complex, the <b>screw</b> <b>hole</b> positions at the infraorbital rim and zygomaticomaxillary buttress seemed to align perfectly: no <b>screw</b> <b>hole</b> adjustments were necessary. Minor deviations were seen between planned and acquired PSI position; the mean errors between planned and acquired OZC position were 1. 5 and 1. 2 mm. Orbital reconstruction with a PSI before OZC repositioning ensures true-to-original orbital reconstruction. The use of old <b>screw</b> <b>hole</b> positions enables the PSI {{to be used as}} a static guide for ON repositioning. The combination of static and dynamic guidance increases predictability in secondary OZC reconstruction.

30|$|As {{the plate}} is pre-contoured, {{it does not}} seat equally well in all {{patients}} and bending the plate can potentially damage the locking <b>hole</b> <b>screw</b> threads and can also change the screw direction to a certain extent. Improperly locked screws can compromise {{the stability of the}} construct, and the change in screw direction can pose a problem in the distal screws which are directed into the capitellum and trochlea. To circumvent this problem, plate bending should be done after blocking the <b>screw</b> <b>holes</b> with locking sleeves and bending the plate only in between the <b>screw</b> <b>holes.</b>|$|R
40|$|Aim: As {{more and}} more dental {{practitioners}} are focusing on implant-supported fixed restorations, some clinicians favor the use of cement retained restorations while others consider screw retained prosthesis {{to be the best}} choice. Discussion: In screw-retained restorations, the <b>fastening</b> <b>screw</b> provides a solid joint between the restoration and the implant abutment, while in cement-retained prostheses the restorative screw is eliminated to enhance esthetics, occlusal stability, and passive fit of the restorations. The factors that influence the type of fixation of the prostheses to the implants like passivity of the framework, ease of fabrication, occlusion, esthetics, accessibility, retention and retrievability are discussed in this article with scientific studies demonstrating superior outcomes of one technique over another. Screwretained implant restorations have an advantage of predictable retention, retrievability and lack of potentially retained subgingival cement. However, a few disadvantages exist such as precise placement of the implant for optimal and esthetic location of the <b>screw</b> access <b>hole</b> and obtaining passive fit. On the other hand, cement retained restorations eliminate unesthetic <b>screw</b> access <b>holes,</b> have passive fit of castings, reduced complexity of clinical and lab procedures, enhanced esthetics, reduced cost factors and non disrupted morphology of the occlusal table. Conclusion: This article compares the advantages, potential disadvantages and limitations of screw and cement retained restorations and their specific implications in the most common clinical situation...|$|R
40|$|There have been, in some rare cases, {{difficulties}} with clamping of inserts with U-holes in their tool holder. According to the complaints, the inserts {{could not be}} properly clamped or could fracture when clamped. A study has shown that variations in clamping behaviour are mainly depending by {{the position of the}} <b>screw</b> <b>hole</b> in the tool holder and the centering of the <b>screw</b> <b>hole</b> in the insert. The focus of this project has been the centering of <b>screw</b> <b>hole</b> in insert. It has been shown that the <b>screw</b> <b>holes</b> are not always enough centered in the insert. The problem may occur after a certain step in the production, i. e. peripheral grinding. Today, the centering can be measured by a certain measurement jig. The measurement jig has a very good Gauge R and R value but is not easy to use, especially {{if it is to be}} reinstated into the production. The aim of this thesis has been to use SmartScope for developing a new method for measuring the centering of <b>screw</b> <b>hole</b> in insert. The goal with the new method was to be able to measure faster and to be easier to use than the existing one. The project was started with exercises and exploration of some of the functions of SmartScope and its software Measuremind 3 D. Parallel with this, a study was made of the existing documentation for a better understanding of the problem. A method which measures how well the <b>screw</b> <b>holes</b> are centered in their inserts has been developed. The method consists of a number of measuring tools which are joined into a measurement sequence. Measurements of single inserts are fully automated. Provided that a system which picks and puts the inserts in specific locations can be implemented, a series of inserts can be measured fully automated. This method is faster and especially more automated than the current measurement jig. Measurements have shown that the accuracy of the method is well within the tolerance and that it has a good repeatability...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical EngineeringScrews {{are common}} {{orthopaedic}} hardware used {{to secure a}} fractured bone. After the bone has healed, the screws may be removed, and the vacant <b>screw</b> <b>holes</b> introduce a potential site for re-fracture, which is a known complication. The current study simulated a laboratory torsional fracture test of a composite analogue tibia with vacant <b>screw</b> <b>holes</b> by using a finite element (FE) model, and {{the results from the}} simulation were compared to those obtained experimentally. Variations of the FE model were also analyzed to investigate the effects of failure model, <b>screw</b> <b>holes,</b> element size, rotation direction, and simplification of the model's geometry. This FE model was set up the same as the experimental torsion test, with a section from the distal portion of the tibia. The proximal end of the section was subjected to an axial load and rotated, while the distal end was fixed. The FE model contained 102, 126 first order tetrahedral elements and 24, 817 nodes, and it utilized an isotropic linear elastic material law with material properties obtained from the composite analogue manufacturer. Comparisons between the FE model variations considered the fracture torque, fracture angle, torsional stiffness, principal stress contour, and maximum shear stress contour. The results predicted a fracture torque within the standard deviation of the experimental data, and the percent of strength reduction caused by the <b>screw</b> <b>holes</b> agreed with experimental data...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundAccurate {{positioning}} of locking screws depends on accurate insertion of the drill sleeve into the locking compression plate (LCP). The {{purpose of the}} present study was to determine factors affecting accurate drill sleeve insertion. HypothesisTilting and shallow locking <b>screw</b> <b>holes</b> and combination-type holes make it difficult to insert the drill sleeve in the LCP. Materials and methodsTwenty-seven 3. 5 mm LCP metaphyseal insertion holes were selected (Philos®, LPHP®, DMTP®, low-band DMTP® [Synthes, Solothurn, Switzerland]). Two orthopedic surgeons checked the time taken for accurate insertion of the drill sleeve into the plate. Variables relating to LCP drill sleeve insertion time were analyzed. ResultsIt took an average 6. 6 seconds to insert the drill sleeve accurately in the holes. Insertion time increased with the tilt of the <b>screw</b> <b>hole</b> but not with shallowness. Insertion time in combination-type holes was longer (8. 8 seconds) than in single locking holes (5. 6 seconds).

The design and material of these cages are of great importance to the fusion process. Methods such as screw fixation are sometimes used to secure these cages in vivo. However, access to the cage <b>screw</b> <b>holes</b> is partially obscured by the vertebral bodies. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of side-holes {{on the design of}} a cage, assess the feasibility of a bioactive/biodegradable composite as a cage material and develop an instrument to aid screw access to the cage <b>screw</b> <b>holes.</b> Computer models of cages with between 0 and 10 side-holes were produced to model compression between adjacent vertebrae. The bioactive/biodegradable composite as a cage material was analysed using a range of Young’s modulus values for the composite.
