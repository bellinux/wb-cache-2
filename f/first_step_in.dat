5|$|Having {{declared}} his {{disdain for the}} 1956 reunification elections, Diệm saw the referendum as the <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> creating a long-term state to rule over South Vietnam.

5|$|A stereospecific form of (S)-mephedrone {{could be}} {{prepared}} via Friedel–Crafts acylation. The <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> the synthesis {{would be to}} react toluene and (S)-N-trifluoroacetylalanoyl chloride {{in the presence of}} aluminium chloride, then deprotect the intermediate with hydrochloric acid-propyl alcohol. This would produce (S)-4-methylcathinone, which could then be methylated to produce mephedrone.|$|E
5|$|Efforts to {{save the}} forests of the region began in the 19th century under Major Ramsay, the British Officer who was in-charge of the area during those times. The <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> the {{protection}} of the area began in 1868 when the British forest department established control over the land and prohibited cultivation and the operation of cattle stations. In 1879 these forests were constituted into a reserve forest where restricted felling was permitted.|$|E
5|$|For Greece {{is already}} entirely obedient to you, {{and will remain}} so: the Achaeans from genuine affection; the Aetolians from the terror which their {{disasters}} in the present war have inspired them.

And now is the moment to act when the Romans have suffered a reverse.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, some Han {{literary}} sources provide crucial information.

5|$|Parthia {{had always}} posed {{a threat to}} Rome in the east, but the real battlefront was along the Rhine and Danube rivers. Before the final fight with Antony, Octavian's campaigns against the tribes in Dalmatia were the <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> {{expanding}} Roman dominions to the Danube. Victory in battle was not always a permanent success, as newly conquered territories were constantly retaken by Rome's enemies in Germania.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of tadpoles lack lids, but at metamorphosis, {{the cornea}} becomes more dome-shaped, the lens becomes flatter, and eyelids and {{associated}} glands and ducts develop. The adult eyes are an improvement on invertebrate eyes and were a <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> {{the development of}} more advanced vertebrate eyes. They allow colour vision and depth of focus. In the retinas are green rods, which are receptive {{to a wide range of}} wavelengths.|$|E

5|$|The <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> symptom {{control is}} {{drainage}} of cerebrospinal fluid by lumbar puncture.

5|$|All {{corticosteroid}} hormones share cholesterol as {{a common}} precursor. Therefore, the <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> steroidogenesis is cholesterol uptake or synthesis. Cells that produce steroid hormones can acquire cholesterol through two paths. The main source is through dietary cholesterol transported via the blood as cholesterol esters within low density lipoproteins (LDL). LDL enters the cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis. The other source of cholesterol is synthesis in the cell's endoplasmic reticulum. Synthesis can compensate when LDL levels are abnormally low. In the lysosome, cholesterol esters are converted to free cholesterol, which is then used for steroidogenesis or stored in the cell.|$|E

5|$|Bonaparte {{sought to}} invade Egypt as the <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> a {{campaign}} against British India, part of a greater effort to drive Britain out of the French Revolutionary Wars. As Bonaparte's fleet crossed the Mediterranean, it was pursued by a British force under Nelson who had been sent from the British fleet in the Tagus to learn {{the purpose of the}} French expedition and to defeat it. He chased the French for more than two months, on several occasions only missing them by a matter of hours. Bonaparte was aware of Nelson's pursuit and enforced absolute secrecy about his destination. He was able to capture Malta and then land in Egypt without interception by the British naval forces.|$|E
5|$|Diệm {{reportedly}} saw {{the poll}} {{as an opportunity}} to legitimise him as a symbol of Vietnamese democracy, so that he could frame and justify his refusal to participate in national elections as a struggle between freedom and communist authoritarianism. Diệm asserted that South Vietnam would eventually reunify the nation under a democratic administration and liberate their northern compatriots from communist oppression, and championed the referendum as a <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> nurturing democracy. His support base was to use this as a means of justifying the deposal of Bảo Đại, citing past decisions that according to them, were pro-communist.|$|E
5|$|If one {{of these}} tests shows a {{deficiency}} of hormones produced by the pituitary, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the pituitary is the <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> identifying an underlying cause. MRI may show various tumors and may assist in delineating other causes. Tumors smaller than 1cm {{are referred to as}} microadenomas, and larger lesions are called macroadenomas. Computed tomography with radiocontrast may be used if MRI is not available. Formal visual field testing by perimetry is recommended, as this would show evidence of optic nerve compression by a tumor.|$|E

5|$|In 1816 the RIAL was {{authorized}} to operate two new Royal Grammar Schools, in Quebec City and in Montreal. This {{was a turning point}} for public education in Lower Canada as the schools were created by legislation, the District Public Schools Act of 1807, which showed the government's willingness to support the costs of education and even the salary of a schoolmaster. This was an important <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> the creation of nondenominational schools. When James McGill died in 1813 his bequest was administered by the RIAL.|$|E

5|$|Most men {{typically}} just {{wear the}} towel provided. According to bathhouse etiquette, {{it is perfectly}} acceptable, even friendly, to put one's hand under someone else's towel to feel his penis, which, if well received, is the <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> sexual intimacy. Some bathhouses permit and others not only permit but encourage total nudity. In some bathhouses nudity is forbidden in the common areas of the establishments. Some men may wear underwear or fetish-wear, but it is unusual for customers to remain fully or even partially dressed in street clothes. Bare feet are customary, though some men prefer to wear flip flops or sandals, sometimes provided by the establishment, for foot protection. The room or locker key is usually suspended from an elastic band which can be worn around the wrist or ankle.|$|E
