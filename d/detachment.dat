5|$|A <b>detachment</b> of four Australian F/A-18 Hornet fighter {{aircraft}} provided {{air defence}} for the US military {{base on the}} island of Diego Garcia during the campaign against the Taliban, which was called Operation Slipper. The initial <b>detachment</b> was provided by No. 77 Squadron RAAF between December 2001 and 10 February 2002. This <b>detachment</b> was replaced by a <b>detachment</b> from No. 3 Squadron RAAF which was deployed between 10 February 2002 and 20 May 2002. No further Australian units have been deployed to Diego Garcia. The United States Air Force commented favourably on the RAAF contingent's professionalism during this deployment.|$|E
5|$|After {{several months}} of {{increasing}} tension between the factions struggling for power within the insurgency, {{the first of the}} pro-Chetnik coups occurred, in the Ozren Partisan <b>Detachment.</b> It was sparked by the arrest and execution on 18 April of pro-Chetnik agitator Bogdan Jovićić by Vukmanović-Tempo and the newly formed 1st East Bosnian Shock Battalion. Fighting ensued between pro-Chetnik members of the <b>detachment</b> and the Shock Battalion. Vukmanović-Tempo then abandoned the Ozren Partisan <b>Detachment,</b> taking the <b>detachment</b> staff and remaining loyal Partisans with him.|$|E
5|$|More pro-Chetnik coups {{occurred}} {{in the second half}} of April. The first was in one of the remaining battalions of the Romanija Partisan <b>Detachment,</b> followed by all three battalions of the Zvijezda Partisan <b>Detachment.</b> The political commissars of every company were killed. By the start of May, coups had also {{occurred in}} battalions of the Kalinovik Partisan <b>Detachment</b> and the Foča Volunteer <b>Detachment.</b>|$|E

5|$|After initial {{organizational}} problems, the weakened <b>detachment</b> {{reached an}} {{area near the}} village of Košute where they were engaged by Ustaše Militia backed by Italian reinforcements. After a day of fighting and the death of one of their commanders, members of the <b>detachment</b> began to retreat. In the end, the Partisans suffered four killed in action and 25 taken prisoner, while 13 managed to escape. All but three of the prisoners were later executed by firing squad. A Split <b>Detachment</b> was reformed, but most of its fighters were part of the 3rd Dalmatian Assault Brigade.|$|E

The Birač Partisan <b>Detachment</b> was the only Partisan or volunteer <b>detachment</b> in East Bosnia not to suffer a pro-Chetnik coup in March–May 1942. By June–July 1942, the Partisans in eastern Bosnia had been reduced to a strength of around 600 fighters.|$|E

5|$|In the 7th Army sector, about 09:45, the LI Infantry Corps began {{crossing}} the Drava, but {{construction of a}} bridge near Maribor was suspended because the river was in flood. Despite this, the 183rd Infantry Division managed to secure an alternative crossing point, and established a bridgehead. This crossing point was a partially destroyed bridge, guarded by a single platoon of the 1st Bicycle Battalion of <b>Detachment</b> Ormozki, the far left formation of the 4th Army. This crossing, combined with {{the withdrawal of the}} 38th Infantry Division Dravska from the line from Slovenska Bistrica to Ptuj, exposed the left flank of <b>Detachment</b> Ormozki. The <b>Detachment</b> attempted to withdraw south, but began to disintegrate during the night of 10/11 April.|$|E

As a result, rhegmatogenous retinal <b>detachments</b> form in a predictable manner around the retinal break of their origin. The shape of the <b>detachments</b> points to the position of the break. The purpose of this review is to describe the characterstic contours of subretinal fluid in rhegmatogenous retinal <b>detachments,</b> and to highlight some rules and methodology which can help in the detection of the retinal break in phakic, psuedophakic and recurrent retinal <b>detachments.</b> </b...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE. To {{investigate}} {{the source and}} protein content of sub-retinal fluid in self-forming experimental serous retinal <b>detachments.</b> METHODS. <b>Detachments</b> were induced in Dutch rabbit eyes using rose bengal photosensitization to cause choriocapillaris injury and thrombosis. Serous <b>detachments</b> formed spontaneously within the next 24 h. Subretinal fluid was withdrawn 2, 8 and 24 hrs after photosensitization, and was analyzed for osmolality and albumin content by gel electrophoresis. RESULTS. The albumin concentration in the subretinal fluid of light-induced <b>detachments</b> was 68 % of serum level at 3 h after light damage, and rose close to serum level by 24 h. The osmolality of subretinal fluid 24 h after light damage was {{essentially the same as}} serum and vitreous fluid. CONCLUSIONS. The subretinal protein and fluid in light-induced <b>detachments</b> in the central retina of the rabbit must come from the choroid, since there are no intrinsic retinal blood vessels in that region of the fundus. These data demonstrate that serous retinal <b>detachments</b> can form from choroidal fluid...|$|R
5|$|In {{the areas}} of the 42nd Infantry Division Murska and <b>Detachment</b> Ormozki, the Germans cleared the {{territory}} north of the Drava, and border guard units were withdrawn south of the river.

5|$|Just as they {{finished}} their report, the <b>detachment</b> was fired on by Ustaše Militia. The Ustaše called {{for help from}} Sinj, and by 18:00, Italian reinforcements had arrived and began encircling the <b>detachment,</b> engaging them with mortars and light artillery. Outnumbered and facing an enemy with greater firepower, the Partisans planned to hold their positions until evening then retreat using the cover of darkness. About 20:00, Kovačević-Lala, {{one of the most}} experienced members of the <b>detachment,</b> was killed after being hit by a mortar round, which had a significant effect on the morale of the remaining fighters. Borovčić-Kurir issued the order to retreat, but it turned into chaos as individuals fled the area.|$|E

5|$|No. 38 Squadron {{moved from}} Richmond to RAAF Base Amberley, west of Brisbane, in October 1992. At {{this time the}} {{squadron}} continued {{to be responsible for}} all Caribou conversion training, as well as conducting tactical transport operations. The permanent <b>detachment</b> of No. 38 Squadron aircraft to RAAF Base Pearce ceased in 1999, and <b>Detachment</b> B of the squadron was established at RAAF Base Townsville in North Queensland during 2000. From 1999 until early 2001, elements of No. 38 Squadron, designated No. 86 Wing <b>Detachment</b> C, were stationed in East Timor and supported the international peacekeeping force which had been deployed there to end the violence that had broken out following a successful referendum on independence conducted in August 1999. At its peak strength, four Caribous were assigned to the <b>detachment.</b> The air and ground crew deployed to East Timor endured difficult living conditions until their accommodation and recreation facilities were upgraded in mid-2000, and the pilots were regularly required to fly into poorly maintained air strips. Despite the age of the Caribous and shortages of spare parts, <b>Detachment</b> C's ground crew managed to maintain a high aircraft serviceability rate. In 2000 No. 35 Squadron was deactivated, leaving No. 38 Squadron the RAAF's sole Caribou operator. By September 2002, No. 38 Squadron was equipped with 14 Caribous. In July 2003, two aircraft were deployed to the Solomon Islands as part of the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands peacekeeping force. Both Caribous were based at Honiara International Airport, and a <b>detachment</b> remained in the country until July 2004. All of No. 38 Squadron moved to RAAF Base Townsville during 2008.|$|E
5|$|On 22January 1942, at the {{headquarters}} of the 1st Krajina <b>Detachment</b> in the village of Majkić Japra, Stojanović presided over a conference of the <b>detachment</b> staff and political activists of Grmeč. He criticised the <b>detachment</b> headquarters because it had no division of functions and there was no personal accountability among its members. He also stated {{the headquarters}} had no communication with the companies of the <b>detachment,</b> did not act as a military-political leadership, and there were no designated couriers available at all times {{at the headquarters}}. Stojanović was generally pleased with the Grmeč Partisans, describing them as courageous, enthusiastic, firm, and trustworthy but somewhat inexperienced. However, he said that the platoons of the <b>detachment</b> were dispersed in villages and had no contact with each other. In this way, according to Stojanović, the Partisans were losing their soldierly characteristics and becoming more like peasants. Stojanović criticised the views of some Partisans that political commissars should be abolished. He warned that the Partisans who wore emblems other than the red star would be punished for indiscipline.|$|E
