50|$|The <b>Throstle</b> <b>frame</b> was a {{descendant}} of the water frame. It used the same principles, was better engineered and driven by steam. In 1828 the Danforth <b>throstle</b> <b>frame</b> was invented in the United States. The heavy flyer caused the spindle to vibrate, and the yarn snarled every time the frame was stopped. Not a success. It was named throstle, as the noise it made when running was compared to {{the song of the}} throstle (thrush).|$|R
5000|$|The <b>throstle</b> <b>frame</b> was a {{spinning}} machine for cotton, wool, and other fibers, differing from a mule {{in having a}} continuous action, the processes of drawing, twisting, and winding being carried on simultaneously. It [...] "derived {{its name from the}} singing or humming which it occasioned," [...] throstle being a dialect name for the song thrush.|$|R
50|$|Ring frame (1929) {{developed}} {{out of the}} <b>Throstle</b> <b>frame</b> (19th century) {{an improvement}} on the Arkwright's Water frame. Originally rings were only suitable for coarse counts, they were lower and heavier than mules so needed stronger floors but lower rooms. Over time, rings became suitable for finer counts and because of cheaper labour costs they replaced mules. By 1950 all mills had converted to the Ring frame. The Hawk mill in Shaw near Oldham was still operating cotton mule frames in 1964/65.|$|R
50|$|Ring {{spinning}} is {{a method}} of spinning fibres, such as cotton, flax or wool, to make a yarn. The ring frame developed from the <b>throstle</b> <b>frame,</b> which in its turn was a descendant of Arkwright's water frame. Ring spinning is a continuous process, unlike mule spinning which uses an intermittent action. In ring spinning, the roving is first attenuated by using drawing rollers, then spun and wound around a rotating spindle which in its turn is contained within an independently rotating ring flyer. Traditionally ring frames could only {{be used for the}} coarser counts, but they could be attended by semi-skilled labour.|$|R
50|$|The <b>throstle</b> <b>frame</b> was {{an early}} method of {{spinning}} yarn, and was a direct descendant of the spinning wheel. The rovings were attenuated by rollers as in the later ring frame. The thread was collected on free spinning spindles which had a flyer above which acted as the twisting mechanism. The flyer always maintains a uniform velocity, though the bobbin retarded by friction, is pulled around the spindle by the tension of the yarn allowing the variation needed {{to account for the}} increasing diameter. It was very suited to producing high quality yarn of the coarser counts.|$|R
25|$|The {{spinning}} mule spins {{textile fibres}} into yarn by an intermittent process. In the draw stroke, the roving is pulled through rollers and twisted; {{on the return}} it is wrapped onto the spindle. Its rival, the <b>throstle</b> <b>frame</b> or ring frame uses a continuous process, where the roving is drawn, twisted and wrapped in one action. The mule {{was the most common}} spinning machine from 1790 until about 1900 and was still used for fine yarns until the early 1980s. In 1890, a typical cotton mill would have over 60 mules, each with 1,320 spindles, which would operate four times a minute for 56 hours a week.|$|R
5000|$|The {{spinning}} mule or {{mule jenny}} {{was created in}} 1779 by Samuel Crompton. It {{was a combination of}} Arkwright's water frame and Hargreaves' spinning jenny. It was so named because it was a hybrid of these two machines. The mule consisted of a fixed frame containing a creel of bobbins holding the roving, connected through the headstock to a parallel carriage containing the spindles. It used an intermittent process: On the outward traverse, the rovings were paid out, and twisted, and the return traverse, the roving was clamped and the spindles reversed taking up the newly spun thread. The rival machine, the <b>throstle</b> <b>frame</b> or ring frame was a continuous process, where the roving was drawn twisted and wrapped in one action. The spinning mule became self-acting (automatic) in 1830s. The mule was the most common spinning machine from 1790 until about 1900, but was still used for fine yarns until the 1960s. A cotton mill in 1890 would contain over 60 mules, each with 1320 spindles.|$|R
