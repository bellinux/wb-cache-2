50|$|There {{are three}} broad {{categories}} of <b>forest</b> <b>definitions</b> in use: administrative, land use, and land cover. Administrative definitions are based primarily upon the legal designations of land, and commonly bear little {{relationship to the}} vegetation growing on the land: land that is legally designated as a forest {{is defined as a}} forest even if no trees are growing on it. Land use definitions are based upon the primary purpose that the land serves. For example, a forest may be defined as any land that is used primarily for production of timber. Under such a land use definition, cleared roads or infrastructure within an area used for forestry, or areas within the region that have been cleared by harvesting, disease or fire are still considered forests even if they contain no trees. Land cover definitions define forests based upon the type and density of vegetation growing on the land. Such definitions typically define a forest as an area growing trees above some threshold. These thresholds are typically the number of trees per area (density), the area of ground under the tree canopy (canopy cover) or the section of land that is occupied by the cross-section of tree trunks (basal area). Under such land cover definitions, and area of land only be defined as forest if it is growing trees. Areas that fail to meet the land cover definition may be still included under while immature trees are establishing if they are expected to meet the definition at maturity.|$|E

Despite Italian forests are subject of protection since long time, the first forest definition legally binding has been enacted only in 2001. However, thanks to the action of international, national and regional institutions, 25 <b>forest</b> <b>definitions</b> are effective today on the Italian territory. All definitions of forest are fully described and their qualification analyzed using four definition types: legislation, policies, technical and allocative.

The first group includes all regional definitions due to the details of their content, while the second group includes definition adopted by international and national institutions. Three aspects have been emphasized in the conclusion: (a) all definitions, except that adopted by the Lombardy Region, are based on the “forest land” and not on the “forest”; (b) most definitions do not include the multifunctional nature of the forest thus neglecting one of the most relevant forest profiles; (c) the first part of all definition is devoted to technical details as if the main motivation for their elaboration were the quantification of the forest area...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{delineation}} of forested {{areas is}} a critical task, because the resulting maps are a fundamental input for a broad field of applications and users. Different national and international <b>forest</b> <b>definitions</b> are available for manual or automatic delineation, but unfortunately most definitions lack precise geometrical descriptions for the different criteria.

For loosely stocked areas, this criterion is especially critical, because {{the size and shape of}} the reference area for calculating CC is not clearly defined in most definitions. Thus current forest delineations differ and tend to be non-comparable because of different settings for checking the criterion of CC in the delineation process. This paper evaluates a new approach for the automatic delineation of forested areas, based on airborne laser scanning (ALS) data with a clearly defined method for calculating CC.

40|$|Estimates of {{tropical}} deforestation and forest degradation are misleading, partly because different studies {{make use of}} different <b>forest</b> <b>definitions.</b> This paper investigates the influence of this confusion on the assessment of forest extent and its spatial distribution, by means of fine-scaled land cover maps and landscape metrics. The state of Rondônia, Brazil, located in the southwestern part of the Amazon basin and known for its fishbone-like pattern of deforestation, {{is used as a}} study area. A 1 : 250 000 vector data product from the Brazilian Geography and Statistics Institute (IBGE), describing the land cover type in a three-step hierarchy specifying canopy density, topography, and dominant life forms, was rasterized and analyzed. Forest subcategories were aggregated into a seven level gradient, ranging from a level that is very specific and only includes dense multi-layered rain forest, to less strict levels containing open forest systems, secondary vegetation, and tree savannas. We show that there is a consistent difference between the initial class aggregation level, and all other levels, which gradually broaden the forest definition and are characterized by very distinct ecological parameters, such as a higher mean patch size, increased levels of landscape connectivity and slightly more irregularly shaped patches. We recommend a harmonization of the major <b>forest</b> <b>definitions</b> in use today, while taking care not to lose the relevant ecological information that can be extracted from its most detailed classification level. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Using data from Indonesia, we show that the choice of a forest definition can have a large impact on estimates of deforestation and forest degradation areas, on assessment of drivers of deforestation and on the development of a REL. The total area of deforestation between 2000 and 2009 was 4. 9 million ha when using the FAO definition, 18 % higher when using a ‘natural forest definition’ and 27 % higher when using the national definition.

International {{forestry}} programs frequently seem to operate on the assumption that they do. However, recent advances in the language sciences show that languages vary greatly as to how the landscape domain is lexicalized and grammaticalized. Different languages segment and label the large-scale environment and its features according to astonishingly different semantic principles, often in tandem with highly culture-specific practices and ideologies. Presumed basic concepts like mountain, valley, and river cannot in fact be straightforwardly translated across languages. In this paper we describe, compare, and evaluate some of the semantic diversity observed in relation to forests.

Our results, based on a limited sample size, indicate that the homegardens also store significant amount of carbon, with above ground biomass carbon stocks in dry zone homegardens (n = 8) ranging from 10 to 55 megagrams of carbon per hectare (Mg C ha− 1) with a mean value of 35 Mg C ha− 1, whereas carbon stocks in wet zone homegardens (n = 4) range from 48 to 145 Mg C ha− 1 with a mean value of 87 Mg C ha− 1.

A total of 20 land cover classes were described with the standardized Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) developed by the FAO. Based on a semi-automatic processing chain, the forest types map was produced by combining 19 months of observations from the ENVISAT MERIS full resolution products (300 m) and 8 yr of daily SPOT VEGETATION (VGT) reflectances (1 km). Four zones (north, south and two central) were delineated and processed separately according to their seasonal and cloud cover specificities. The discrimination between different vegetation types (e. g. forest and savannas) was significantly improved thanks to the MERIS sharp spatial resolution. This work achieved a better discrimination in cloudy areas by taking advantage of the temporal consistency of the SPOT VGT observations. This resulted in a precise delineation of the spatial extent of the rural complex in the countries situated along the Atlantic coast. Based on this new map, more accurate estimates of the surface areas of forest types were produced for each country of the Congo Basin. The impact of two <b>forest</b> <b>definitions</b> was then assessed in the framework of the reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD) initiative and carbon stocks were evaluated. Furthermore, the phenology of the different vegetation types was illustrated systematically with EVI temporal profiles. This Congo Basin forest types map reached a satisfactory overall accuracy of 71. 5 % and even 78. 9 % when the two savanna classes are aggregated...|$|E
40|$|Tree {{crown cover}} (CC) {{provides}} {{means for the}} continuous land cover characterization of complex tropical landscapes with multiple land uses and variable degrees of degradation. It is also a key parameter in the international <b>forest</b> <b>definitions</b> that are basis for monitoring global forest cover changes. Recently, airborne laser scanning (ALS) {{has emerged as a}} practical method for accurate CC mapping, but ALS derived CC estimates have rarely been assessed with field data in the tropics. Here, our objective was to compare the various field and ALS based CC estimates across multiple land cover types in the Taita Hills, Kenya. The field data was measured from a total of 178 sample plots (0. 1 ha) in 2013 and 2014. The most accurate field measurement method, line intersect sampling using Cajanus tube, was used in 37 plots. Other methods included CC estimate based on the tree inventory data (144 plots), crown relascope (43 plots) and hemispherical photography (30 plots). Three ALS data sets, including two scanners and flying heights, were acquired concurrently with the field data collection. According to the results, the first echo cover index (FCI) from ALS data had good agreement with the most accurate field based CC estimates (RMSD 7. 1 % and 2. 7 % depending on the area and scan). The agreement with other field based methods was considerably worse. Furthermore, we observed that ALS cover indices were robust between the different scans in the overlapping area. In conclusion, our results suggest that ALS provides a reliable method for continuous CC mapping across tropical land cover types although dense shrub layer and tree-like herbaceous plants can cause overestimation of CC. * Corresponding author 1...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1989 The use of {{mechanized}} harvest equipment {{has been}} increasing as an economical method to harvest small diameter timber. While {{the use of this}} equipment is increasing, little is known about associated soil compaction. In particular, little information exists on soil compaction caused by feller [...] bunchers. This study measured soil compaction caused by a mechanized harvest operation using 2 swing-boom, tracked feller-bunchers and 2 rubber-tired grapple skidders. The study took place on the LaGrande Ranger District of the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest, located in eastern Oregon on volcanic ash soils.

40|$|Forest mapping is an {{important}} source of information for assessing woodland resources and a key issue for any National Forest Inventory (NFI). In the present study, a detailed wall-to-wall forest cover map was generated for all of Switzerland, which meets the requirement of the Swiss NFI <b>forest</b> <b>definition.</b> The workflow is highly automated and based on digital surface models from image-based point clouds of airborne digital sensor data. It fully takes into account the four key criteria of minimum tree height, crown coverage, width, and land use. The forest cover map was validated using almost 10, 000 terrestrial and stereo-interpreted NFI plots, which verified 97 % agreement overall. This validation implies different categories such as five production regions, altitude, tree type, and distance to the forest border. Overall accuracy was lower at forest borders but increased with increasing distance from the forest border. Commission errors remained stable at around 10 %, but increased to 17. 6 % at the upper tree line. Omission errors were low at 1 %– 10 %, but also increased with altitude and mainly occurred at the upper tree line (19. 7 %). The main reasons for this are the lower image quality and the NFI height <b>definition</b> for <b>forest</b> which apparently excludes shrub forest from the mask. The presented forest mapping approach is superior to existing products due to its national coverage, high level of detail, regular updating, and implementation of the land use criteria...|$|R
