50|$|Newer engines {{typically}} use computerized ignition systems. The {{computer has}} a <b>timing</b> <b>map</b> (lookup table) with spark advance values for all combinations of engine speed and engine load. The computer {{will send a}} signal to the ignition coil at the indicated time in the <b>timing</b> <b>map</b> in order to fire the spark plug. Most computers from original equipment manufacturers (OEM) cannot be modified so changing the timing advance curve is not possible. Overall timing changes are still possible, depending on the engine design. Aftermarket engine control units allow the tuner to make changes to the <b>timing</b> <b>map.</b> This allows the timing to be advanced or retarded based on various engine applications.|$|R
2500|$|One {{critical}} maintenance issue {{specific to}} the Yugo 55 and 65 (the 45 was a 903 cc pushrod <b>engine,</b> with a <b>timing</b> chain) was the need for regular replacement of the interference <b>engine's</b> <b>timing</b> belt— every [...] In a non-interference <b>engine,</b> <b>timing</b> belt failure does not cause further damage to the engine. However, in an interference engine, failure of the timing belt disrupts the synchronization between pistons and poppet valves, causing them to collide with one another (hence the name interference engine), thus potentially destroying the engine. Though this requirement was stressed in owners' manuals, it was frequently overlooked by owners. The factory also {{stressed the need for}} 89-octane fuels for the low-compression engines.|$|R

40|$|The current {{trend in}} {{automotive}} industry {{is to achieve}} compact, efficient, reliable systems. <b>Engine</b> <b>timing</b> drives used in engines {{are one of the}} most critical systems. Timing belts are subjected to excessive elongation and wear, while timing gears contribute excess mass and inertia in the system. Hence timing chains are preferred widely, in various high performance engines. Chain drives are easy to assemble and adjust, highly efficient, durable, reliable, compact and capable of attaining a wide range of power and speed capacities. In spite of these advantages their complex dynamic behaviour is not well researched. With the improvement of the speed and load of the automotive engine, and silent chain technology, as silent chain has a compact structure, high transmitting efficiency, high reliability and high wear resistance, its vibration and noise is low, and the silent chain have the advantage of life-long maintenance-free, it significant overcomes the gear drive and belt drive performance, therefore, the silent chain is increasingly widely used in automotive <b>engine</b> <b>timing</b> system. In this present review dynamic analysis as well as analysis of automotive <b>engines</b> <b>timing</b> silent chain system are studied...|$|R
50|$|A belt {{tensioner}} is a device designed to maintain {{tension in the}} <b>engine’s</b> <b>timing</b> belt. There is a spring device in the {{belt tensioner}} where the bearing is located. The spring device oscillates back and forth at 2° for about 60 cycles per minute.|$|R

This adaptation was used only for the suspension. Power steering and brakes were conventional hydraulic- and vacuum-powered, respectively.|$|R
5000|$|Vehicles are {{increasingly}} computerized, with <b>engine</b> <b>timing,</b> cruise control, anti-lock brakes, seat belt tensioners, door locks, airbags and advanced driver-assistance systems on many models.

40|$|A {{principle}} of best <b>engine</b> valve <b>timing</b> is proposed {{based on the}} requirements of best <b>engine</b> valve <b>timing.</b> A novel variable valve timing system is designed according to the principle. The construction of the mathematical model {{of the system and}} its dynamic simulation are also presented. The adjust performance of system and the oil pressure are studied in the paper. Simulation and experimental results show that the system can achieve fully variable valve timing adjustment by regulating electromagnetic valve closing time according to the engine speed, and the system satisfies the {{principle of}} best <b>engine</b> valve <b>timing</b> proposed in the paper...|$|R

50|$|The {{advantage}} of a rotary valve is that it enables the two-stroke <b>engine's</b> intake <b>timing</b> to be asymmetrical, which is not possible with piston-port type engines. The piston-port type <b>engine's</b> intake <b>timing</b> opens and closes before and after top dead center at the same crank angle, making it symmetrical, whereas the rotary valve allows the opening to begin and close earlier.|$|R
50|$|In a spark {{ignition}} engine, a mixture is ignited by an electric spark from {{a spark plug}} — the timing of which is very precisely controlled. Almost all gasoline engines are of this type. Diesel <b>engines</b> <b>timing</b> is precisely controlled by the pressure pump and injector.The normal plug distance between the spark plug is 1mm apart, and the voltage is 3000v at normal atmospheric conditions.|$|R
2500|$|As {{illustrated}} under production numbers, SM sales declined {{starting in}} 1972. This {{appears to be}} attributable to maintenance issues. [...] Like an exotic Italian car, the Weber carburetors require frequent adjustment. Many engines experienced failure at 60,000km - it was unclear to most owners that the interference <b>engine</b> design has <b>timing</b> chains that require manual adjustment, an issue not corrected until long after production ceased. The 90° <b>engine</b> <b>timing</b> was unfamiliar to mechanics in the 1970s. Only Buick (1962–66; 1975-) and Jeep (1966–71) used a V6 with 90° between banks of cylinders. Another issue that has been resolved with retrofit was unreliable ignition breaker cassettes.|$|R
50|$|The car {{made its}} debut at the 1989 IMSA Miami GTP race (car #99), but retired from the event with an <b>engine</b> <b>timing</b> belt malfunction. The team {{concentrated}} its efforts on the #98 car; AAR would not enter the HF89 until the Lime Rock GTP race. The car then completed its first race with a 5th-place finish at the following event at the Mid-Ohio GTP race. The HF89 did not finish any other races that season.|$|R
5000|$|The six-cylinder 2½-litre engine has {{inclined}} {{overhead valves}} {{on either side}} of the cylinder head. They are opened by rockers operated by a single overhead camshaft which is driven by double roller chain. The S.U. carburettor is bolted to the cylinder head which may be removed with the valve train without affecting <b>engine</b> <b>timing.</b> The crankshaft has been given four bearings. The pistons are of aluminium and the connecting rods are steel. Cooling water circulates by pump.|$|R
50|$|Most engine {{systems have}} {{idle speed control}} built into the ECU. The engine RPM is {{monitored}} by the crankshaft position sensor which plays a primary role in the <b>engine</b> <b>timing</b> functions for fuel injection, spark events, and valve timing. Idle speed is controlled by a programmable throttle stop or an idle air bypass control stepper motor. Early carburetor-based systems used a programmable throttle stop using a bidirectional DC motor. Early Throttle body injection (TBI) systems used an idle air control stepper motor. Effective idle speed control must anticipate the engine load at idle.|$|R
50|$|<b>Engine</b> <b>timing</b> was {{controlled}} by the all-steel, silent Morse timing chain (some early production engines had double-row roller timing sets), which was located beneath the aluminum timing cover {{at the front of}} the <b>engine</b> block. The <b>timing</b> chain sprockets, one each for the camshaft and crankshaft, were all-steel; for the last few years the LA engine came with nylon teeth on the sprockets. At the rear of the camshaft was cut a set of helical gear teeth, these being used to spin the distributor. Mounted to the front of the timing cover was a new-design counter-clockwise-rotation water pump, with much improved flow. Externally, the accessory drive belt was changed to a serpentine system; coupled with an automatic belt tensioner this increased belt life, reduced maintenance and contributed to lower noise and vibration levels.|$|R

50|$|In the {{internal}} combustion engine, this task is performed by cams on a camshaft driving poppet valves, but this arrangement is not commonly used with steam engines, partly because achieving variable <b>engine</b> <b>timing</b> using cams is complicated. Instead, {{a system of}} eccentrics, cranks and levers is generally used to control a D slide valve or piston valve from the motion. Generally, two simple harmonic motions with different fixed phase angles are added in varying proportions to provide an output motion that is variable in phase and amplitude. A variety of such mechanisms have been devised over the years, with varying success.|$|R
50|$|Smaller and quieter V-6s were {{introduced}} in 1991 {{in the form of}} the Evinrude Spitfire and the Johnson Silver-Star series. These outboards featured a new flushing device that could be used to flush the engine with fresh water while it was running. The Spitfire and Silver-Star models also used an infra-red sensor system called Optical Ignition System (OIS 2000). This system automatically advanced the <b>engine</b> <b>timing</b> to eliminate unwanted timing changes. Other advancements in 1991 included smaller, more fuel efficient diesel stern drive models. The OMC Cobra Diesel was a 970-pound, 3.2 liter, six-cylinder monoblock inline powerhouse that produced 205-hp at 4300 rpm.|$|R

Back to back single cylinder research engine tests were conducted with watercooled, metal hardware and oil-cooled, thermal barrier coating insulated hardware to determine apparent heat release and fuel economy. Apparent heat release data revealed that the insulated engine had a shorter ignition delay and a longer combustion duration than the metal engine. The insulated engine fuel economy was approximately two percent worse on average for this series of tests.
