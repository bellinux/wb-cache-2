50|$|In {{spite of}} the criticisms {{of the way in}} which the rule in Dearle v Hall has developed, there is much to be said for the concept that the {{priority}} of assignments or charges over debts should, as a general rule, depend on the date notice is given to the person who owes the debt. Not least, this is because the person who owes the debt will get a <b>good</b> <b>discharge</b> by paying the creditor unless he has been notified of the assignment or charge. Once a debt has been paid, it ceases to exist, and the priority rule recognises this fact. That is not to say that, in appropriate cases, it would not be possible for one creditor to trace the proceeds of the debt into the hands of another. But a simple rule that both priority and discharge depend on notice has much to recommend it.|$|E

50|$|Decker's fame as {{a writer}} on trade rests on two tracts.

The second, an Essay on the Causes of the Decline of the Foreign Trade, consequently {{of the value of the}} lands in Britain, and on the means to restore both (1744), has been attributed to W.

Objectives: the aims of this study were to compare the importance of chorological age, gender, co-morbidities and frailty in the prediction of adverse outcomes for patients admitted to an acute geriatric rehabilitation ward. Design: prospective observational cohort study. Subjects and setting: two hundred and sixty-five patients admitted consecutively to an acute geriatric rehabilitation ward at a tertiary care teaching hospital. Methods: frailty status was measured by an index of accumulated deficits, giving a potential score from 0 (no deficits) to 1. 0 (all 40 deficits present). Patients were stratified into three outcomes: <b>good</b> (<b>discharged</b> to original residence within 28 days), intermediate (discharged to original residence but longer hospital stay) and poor (newly institutionalised or died). Results: patients were old (82. 6 ± 8. 6 years) and frail (mean frailty index (FI) 0. 34 ± 0. 09).
