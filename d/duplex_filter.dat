40|$|Coal is {{the most}} {{abundant}} fossil-fuel resource in the United States. `Clean coal` technologies, such as pressurized fluidized-bed combustion (PFBC) and integrated gasification combined-cycle (IGCC), require a hot gas filter to remove the corrosive and erosive coal ash entrained in the combustion gas stream. These hot gas filters, or candle filters, must be cost-effective while able to withstand the effects of corrosion, elevated temperature, thermal shock, and temperature transients. Ash loadings may range from 500 to 10, 000 ppm by weight, and may contain particles as fine as 0. 008 mils. The operating environment for the hot gas filter can range in pressure from 10 to 20 atm, in temperatures from 700 to 1750 {degrees}F, and can be oxidizing or reducing. In addition, the process gases may contain volatile chloride, sulfur, and alkali species. Field testing of various commercially available, porous, ceramic filter matrices has demonstrated a loss of up to 50 percent of as-manufactured strength after 1, 000 to 2, 000 hours of exposure to these operating conditions, although full-scale elements have remained intact during normal process operations. Ultramet, a small business specializing in advanced materials R&D, has developed {{a new class of}} hot gas filter materials that offers lower back-pressure, higher permeability, longer life, and high filtration efficiency in the PFBC and IGCC environments. Subscale Ultrafoam <b>Duplex</b> <b>Filter</b> elements have undergone accelerated corrosion testing at temperatures of up to 2370 {degrees}F (at Ultramet), and have been subjected to over 2, 800 hours of exposure to hot PFBC gases (in the Westinghouse Advanced Particulate Filtration System at Brilliant, OH) without any loss in strength in either case. The Ultrafoam <b>Duplex</b> <b>Filter</b> matrix demonstrated 100 percent particle- capture efficiency of coal ash, and had an initial pressure drop of 0. 1 to 0. 6 in-wc/fpm. The Ultrafoam <b>Duplex</b> <b>Filter</b> is composed of a chemical vapor deposition (CVD), silicon carbide (SiC), reticulated, open-cell foam filter body supporting a porous mullite membrane filter. The reticulated foam structure is 70 to 90 percent porous, enabling high permeability, while the 3 -D interconnected cellular lattice resists crack propagation. The CVD SiC material is fine-grained for maximum strength and corrosion resistance, and has no binders or impurities. The porous, mullite, membrane filter is impregnated into the outer surface of the CVD SiC Ultrafoam filter element. The membrane bonds to the foam ligaments, while the foam ligaments reinforce and support the membrane. The mullite membrane, which acts as a barrier filter, is resistant to thermal shock and corrosion. The thin membrane minimizes pressure drop and thermal gradients. The composite Ultrafoam <b>Duplex</b> <b>Filter</b> was designed to combine optimal material selection with functional structural design to maximize corrosion resistance, thermal shock resistance, strength, toughness, and life while minimizing pressure drop and weight. Oxidation rate, corrosion resistance, creep strength, compressive strength, and C-ring strength of the CVD SiC Ultrafoam filter body, and pressure drop and filtration efficiency for subscale Ultrafoam <b>Duplex</b> <b>Filter</b> elements, are reported. Future work is targeted at the construction of full-scale hot gas filters, and will include further strength and accelerated corrosion testing of subscale sections of the filter body, the membrane, and the composite <b>duplex</b> <b>filter</b> elements...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Active {{duplexing}} is {{a frequency}} flexible solution for software radio systems {{to reduce the}} need for many single band <b>duplexing</b> <b>filters</b> in a multiband environment. The duplexer in Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) is essential for blocking the transmitted noise and transmitted signal leakage into the receiver. Active duplexer eliminates the need for filters by using a cancellation process. A key problem with active duplexer is to keep the transmitted noise level below the Rx noise floor. We propose to embed a pilot signal into the transmitted noise. The known pilot signal can then be used to control the cancellation loop and so eliminate the transmitter noise and leakage. The overall pilot power should not be more than- 63 dBm over the channel bandwidth...|$|R
40|$|The {{popularity}} of smart phones, cloud computing {{and the growing}} market for machineto- machine communications is fuelling the growth of mobile broadband. More frequency bands are therefore being allocated to mobile services. Unfortunately, for historical reasons, these band allocations are fragmented, poorly harmonised between different countries and no longer large enough for the ever-increasing broadband data rates. Carrier aggregation, the operation on two or more bands at once, will be necessary. A future wireless terminal capable of global roaming would therefore have to handle 35 bands, and be capable of carrier aggregation. This is the research challenge. Duplexing is a technique to simultaneously transmit and receive information from the same antenna. Frequency Division Duplex uses two frequency bands for uplink and downlink communications, enabling the transmitter and receiver to operate continuously. <b>Duplexing</b> <b>filters</b> are essential for isolating the receiver from the strong self transmitted signal. Unfortunately the filters are expensive, non tunable and not suitable for integration into silicon. Each new frequency band requires its own <b>duplexing</b> <b>filter</b> and a complex array of switches and filters is required for multi-band operation This work presents an adaptive duplexer architecture compatible with silicon integration. It is tunable over a wide frequency range and capable of carrier aggregation. The structure uses {{a combination of a}} low isolation device with multiple analog cancelling loops controlled by a normalised least mean square algorithm to track changes in signal leakage. The control is a multi-input multi-output problem. However the use of the ”inverse plant control technique” enables orthogonalisation into multi single-input single-output problems, simplifying the structure and reducing convergence time over previous search algorithms. Convergence takes 10 ms from ’cold’ and tracking has a latency of 1. 5 ms. Low power pseudo noise pilot signals placed in the receive bands measure the cancelling error residues used as feedback to the controller. The pilot generator is integrated into silicon using the Peregrine UltraCMOSr GC process. The generator was programmable to four sequence lengths and 8 delays for correlation purposes. The maximum chip rate of 100 Mchip/s was more than the 10 Mchip/s required for an LTE channel...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was the {{assessment}} of the safety, efficacy, and hospital charges of bedside duplex ultrasound–directed inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement. Methods: All <b>duplex</b> ultrasound–directed IVC <b>filters</b> that were placed from August 8, 1995, to December 31, 2000, are reviewed. Chart review combined with mailed questionnaires and telephone follow-up examinations were used to collect demographic and outcome data. Results: Three hundred twenty-five patients underwent evaluation, and 284 underwent <b>duplex</b> ultrasound–directed IVC <b>filter</b> placement. Two hundred three (71 %) were male patients, and 81 (29 %) were female patients. Poor IVC visualization, IVC thrombosis, and unsuitable anatomy prevented duplex-directed filter placement in 41 patients (12 %). Indication for filter placement included venous prophylaxis in the absence of thromboembolism in 235 patients (83 %), contraindication to anticoagulation therapy in 34 patients (12 %), prophylaxis with therapeutic anticoagulation therapy in the presence of thromboembolism in 7 patients (2 %), and complication of anticoagulation therapy in 8 patients (3 %). There were no procedure-related deaths or septic complications. Technical complications occurred in 12 patients (4 %). Filter misplacement occurred in 6 patients (2 %), access thrombosis in 1 (< 1 %), migration in 1 (< 1 %), bleeding in 1 (< 1 %), and IVC occlusion in 3 (1 %). Pulmonary emboli after IVC filter placement occurred in one patient with a misplaced filter. Average hospital charges related to <b>duplex</b> ultrasound–directed <b>filter</b> placement were $ 2388 less than fluoroscopic placement charges in the year 2000.

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} {{a new theory}} of tuning filters based on the time-domain response of the filter. These methods are shown to work very well for all-pole coupledresonator filters in particular, and may be applied to automated tuning of filters. Numerous filter-tuning methods are reviewed, and the attributes and limitations of each are discussed. Key results about transfer functions, filter theory and Laplace transform theory are reviewed as applied to all-pole filters. The Fourier Transform theory is reviewed and a new, {{detailed analysis of the}} Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) time-domain transform, including gating and windowing is presented, including new work in area of the compensation for the masking effects of time-domain gating. A complete description of the time-domain tuning method is presented, which includes experimental and empirical results from simulations and measurements on filters. The theoretical underpinning supporting the novel method of time-domain tuning is developed, along with a rigorous mathematical relationship between VNA timedomain response of a simple filter, and the analytic impulse response. The timedomain results observed in experiments are shown to be directly correlated to the filter transfer functions and the specific effects that differentiate the VNA time-domain transform from the analytically derived impulse response. This thesis includes previously unpublished work that is the basis for two U. S. patents, as well as the development of a commercial filter tuning software program. An improved method for filter tuning, which uses time-domain gating on the S 11 response of the filter is introduced, and shown to be a key improvement for developing automated tuning techniques. The details of a software application for filter tuning are presented, along with methods for determining and compensating the interactions from other resonators. A case study of applying the FTS method to a complex <b>duplex</b> <b>filter</b> is described. Areas for extension into other filter types are discussed.

40|$|The STEAMR {{instrument}} {{is based on}} a linear array of 14 heterodyne receivers. In the instrument, a linear fixed array is used instead of 1 - 2 single channels being scanned in altitude, thus providing an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity and simplification in parts of the optics. Omnisys Instruments AB has currently a contract {{for the development of the}} radiometer core, including frontends, back-ends, control and power interface electronics. The optics will not be covered in this presentation. The Front-Ends consist of subharmonic Schottky mixers with integrated low noise amplifiers and local oscillator chains. The instrument will operate with an effective local oscillator frequency of 337. 5 GHz and with an IF frequency coverage of 6 - 18 GHz, and both sidebands, 12 GHz wide, will be used. The Back-End spectrometers consist of broadband IQ-mixer based <b>duplex</b> <b>filter</b> stages with consequent wideband autocorrelator chips. The subharmonic mixers use VDI diodes and both DSB and SSB versions have been developed. A large effort has been focused on realizing an integrated Front-End unit with low noise amplifier and local oscillator chain. Operation will be in either sideband separating mode or dual sideband mode, or with a mix depending on altitude covered. Three different types of local oscillator chains are being prototyped. The first use an active chain up to 84 GHz followed by a schottky doubler, the second an active chain followed by a HBV tripler and the third an all active chain with buffer amplifiers at 167. 5 GHz. Test results will be presented for the mixers, the first and third LO chain alternatives and possibly for the HBV alternative as well. Both alternatives have shown compliance to our requirements and the all active chain is currently the baseline. Omnisys has developed a single chip autocorrelation spectrometer capable of processing more than 6 GHz of bandwidth with up to 1024 channels of resolution. For the STEAMR instrument, two of these will be operated in parallel to cover 12 GHz with each configured to process 256 channels, i. e. 512 channels will be used over the 6 - 18 GHz bandwidth.

40|$|An active {{wideband}} duplexer {{reduces the}} need for multiple switched <b>duplexing</b> <b>filters</b> in multiband software radio implementations. The technique {{is based on a}} two-step isolation process: 1) a low isolation device and 2) an active double-loop canceling technique that leads to two nulls, one at the desired receive frequency and the other at the transmit frequency. Two cancellation paths generate replicas of the residual transmitter interference signal and noise signal for subtraction from the output of the low isolation device. The feasibility of wideband cancellation mainly depends on the duplexing offset and the operating range of delays in the main path and the cancellation paths. The adjustment range of the coefficients in the cancellation path puts further constraints on these delays. This paper presents a theoretical analysis of double-loop cancellation using geometrical representations. The delay boundaries are derived for a given adjustment range of the vector attenuators (coefficients) used in the cancellation paths. The relationship between cancellation bandwidth and residual cancellation level is shown to be linear (6 dB/octave) and related to the loop delays and the duplexing offset...|$|R
40|$|Different geographies {{and localities}} {{around the world}} have adopted various {{wireless}} interface standards for mobile communications. As a result roaming users will require multiple handsets with multiple standards and multiple band capabilities. Triple-band hand sets are currently offered for high end users. In the future quad-band handsets including GSM 850 will become common in the market. This trend will continue. The addition of third generation functionality to second generation platforms will be even more difficult and complex. The radio handset should {{be able to use the}} same hardware for communications anywhere in the world. Therefore users will require small low cost terminals with multimode/ multi-band capability. The software radio concept has been developed to address these challenges. The replacement of fixed frequency components in the front end of the software radio is one of the key architectural changes required. The duplexer is one such component. Since <b>duplexing</b> <b>filters</b> are not normally tuneable, each band requires a separate duplexer in a multi-band system. The duplexers are passive devices (ceramic or SAW) and multiple duplexers lead to a dramatic increase in terminal cost and size. Abstract Adaptive Duplexer for Software Radio iv This thesis proposes a new adaptive duplexer architecture to reduce/eliminate the multiple duplexer problem in software radio. This technique is based on combining a low isolation device with an adaptive double loop cancelling scheme. The proposed double loop cancellation provides the required transmitter leakage and transmitter noise isolation over wideband using a delay element and an adjustable vector attenuator in each cancellation path. This thesis analyses the double loop cancellation technique. The cancellation path delay constraints are derived for coefficients with limited adjustment range in the cancellation paths. A linear relationship between the bandwidth and the achievable cancellation level is obtained. It is shown that the residual signal power is proportional to the square of the duplexing frequency. It is concluded that the delays in the cancellation paths should be chosen to straddle the expected range variation of the delay in the main path, predominantly caused by variations in antenna matching. The new algorithm uses a single cost function to achieve simultaneous cancellation in both the transmit band and the receive band. A direct conversion receiver architecture was chosen for the hardware prototype, since it is more suitable for multi-band systems. Alternate structures are also possible. A prototype of the adaptive duplexer using a 20 dB circulator and a single loop cancelling technique was designed and implemented. It achieved a total Tx leakage cancellation of 69 dB at 2 GHz with 45 MHz duplexing frequency. However it was not possible to simultaneously cancel the transmitter noise in the receiver band. The original prototype was extended to include the second loop. The achieved isolation between the transmit and the receive signals and the achieved reduction of the transmitter noise in the receiver band were 66. 8 dB and 58 dB respectively. These results were obtained over 5 MHz bandwidth and using a 190 MHz duplexing frequency. The performance is more than adequate for W-CDMA applications. Lowering the duplexing frequency improves the cancellation bandwidth and so the scheme performs better with other standards, such as IS- 95 (CDMA), using 45 MHz duplexing offset...|$|R
40|$|The {{increase}} in the demand for high data rates {{has led to the}} deployment of wider bandwidths and complex waveforms in wireless communication systems. Multicarrier waveforms such as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) employed in modern systems are very sensitive to the transmitter chain nonidealities due to their high peak-to-average-power-ratio (PAPR) characteristic. They are therefore affected by nonlinear transmitter components particularly the power amplifier (PA). Moreover, to enhance power efficiency, PAs typically operate near saturation region and hence become more nonlinear. Power efficiency is highly desirable especially in battery powered and portable devices as well as in base stations. Hence there is a clear need for efficient linearization algorthms which improve power efficiency while maintaining high spectral efficiency. Digital predistortion (DPD) has been {{recognized as one of the}} most effective methods in mitigating PA nonlinear distortions. The method involves the application of inverse PA nonlinear function upstream of the PA such that the overall system output has a linear amplification. The computation of the nonlinearity profile and the inversion of the PA function are particularly difficult and complicated especially when involving wideband radio access waveforms, and therefore memory effects, which are being employed in modern communication systems, such as in Long Term Evolution/Advanced (LTE/LTE-A). In the recent technical literature, different approaches which focus on the linearization of specific frequency bands or sub-bands only have been developed to alleviate this problem, thereby reducing the complexity of DPD. In this thesis, we focus on the development and characterization of a bandlimited DPD solution specifically tailored towards the linearization at and around the main carrier(s) in single carrier deployment or contiguous carrier aggregation of two or more component carriers. In terms of parameter identification, the solution is based on the reduced-complexity closed-loop decorrelation-based parameter learning principle, which is also able to track time-varying changes in the transmitter components adaptively. The proposed bandlimited solution is designed to linearize the inband and out-of-band (OOB) distortions in the immediate vicinity of the main carrier(s) while assuming the distortions more far away in the spectrum are suppressed by transmit or <b>duplex</b> <b>filters.</b> This is implemented using FIR filters to limit the bandwidth expansion during basis functions generation and to restrain the bandwidth of the feedback observation signal, thus reducing the DPD sample rates in both the main path processing and the parameter learning. The performance of the proposed bandlimited DPD solution is evaluated using comprehensive simulations involving memoryless and memory-based PA models, as well as true RF measurements using commercial LTE-A base station and mobile device PAs. The achieved results validate and demonstrate efficient suppression of inband and OOB distortions in real-world application scenarios. Furthermore, the bandlimited DPD consistently outperforms the conventional DPD solutions in the memory-based PA model and practical PA scenarios in suppressing the OOB distortion in the immediate vicinity of the main carrier(s) by approximately 1 - 2 dB. The results provide sufficient grounds for the application of the bandlimited DPD solution in the classical single carrier deployment or in contiguous carrier aggregation of two or more component carriers where conventional DPD solutions would otherwise be highly complex...|$|R

40|$|Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) {{analyses}} {{were used to}} assess on a molecular level, the relationships among representatives of the genera Streptomyces, Nocardia and Mycobacterium. The methods developed in this study have been used for routine analysis of DNA from a large number of actinomycetes and have given reliable and reproducible data. DNA isolated from various actinomycetes was characterized by buoyant density determinations in CsCl from which the mole fraction guanine plus cytosine (GC) content was calculated. All the streptomycete DNA preparations studied had buoyant densities in the range of 1. 7287 to 1. 7312 g cm- 3 which corresponded to GC compositions of 70 % to 73 % GC respectively. The nocardial DNA preparations tested fell in two groups, one with a GC content in the range of 62 to 64 % GC and another in a 68 to 70 % GC group. The mycobacterial DNA tested had GC values overlapping those of the nocardial DNA specimens; moreover, mycobacterial DNA exhibited a bimodal clustering of GC values, 64 to 65 % GC and 67 to 70 % GC. All DNA preparations examined by equilibrium buoyant density centrifugation in CsCl contained a single component with no satellite bands. The method of Warnaar and Cohen for assay of DNA/DNA reassociation on membrane filters was modified for studying reassociation of DNA in high GC organisms, DNA isolated from selected actinomycetes was tested for homology with Streptomyces venezuelae S 13 mycelial DNA by direct reassociation experiments. Unlabeled DNA from the various actinomycetes was immobilized on Schleicher and Scheull nitrocellulose B- 6 membrane filters and then incubated for 15 to 20 hr at 70 C with 14 c-labeled DNA. The measure of relatedness was the relative percentage of renaturation of a denatured test DHA with labeled, dentured homolocous DNA. Unrelated DNA having GC contents of 50 and 70 % were included as controls. The streptomycetes studied were relatively homogeneous in that measurable interspecific duplexes were formed between the reference DNA and all streptomycete DNA examined. Significantly, the results also suggested that S. venezuelae S 13 was related to the nocardial specimens examined but was not related to the mycobacterial cultures studied. The results agreed generally with prior agar-gel studies on DNA reassociation and with previous classifications. Nucleotide sequence divergence in DNA extracted from streptomycetes and nocardiae was determined by measuring the extent of renaturation at 60 C and 70 C. The use of thermal elution of labeled, renatured <b>duplexes</b> from <b>filters</b> substantiated the existence of a class of nucleotide sesquences which can reassociate at 60 C but cannot reassociate at the more exacting 70 C incubation temperature. The use of exacting incubation conditions (70 C) permitted the formation only of t hose DNA duplexes that exhibited a high degree of thermal stability and hence, closely related to the reference DNA. The non-exacting 60 C incubation allowed those sequences to associate which were distantly related. The ratio of binding at 70 C to the binding at 60 C was designated the Divergence Index (DI). The DI was useful for gauging {{the presence or absence of}} closely related genetic material and for determining divergence patterns. The conclusions obtained from this method were corroborated by the much more time consuming thermal elution method. The divergence studies suggested that the streptomycetes contain a wide spectrum of related sequences compared to the reference DNA. Interestingly, the nocardiae examined seemed to have a small but significant amount of conserved nucleotide sequence compared to the S. venezuelae Sl 3 reference. During these studies on actinomycete DNA it was realized that DNA from S. venezuelae S 13 spores had novel properties. As spores aged the buoyant density in CsCl decreased from 1. 727 to 1. 707 g cm- 3, the midpoint of thermal denaturation (Tm) in 0. 1 x SSC increased from 85 to 88. 5 C, and the apparent reassociation with mycelial DNA decreased from 100 to 30 %. Spore DNA in 5 M NaCl 04 had the same Tm as mycelial DNA. Spore DNA (1. 707 g cm- 3) after heat denaturation showed a single band in CsCl (1. 722 g cm- 3). Spore DNA was resistant to pancreatic deoxyribonuclease I, but became progressively sensitive after treatment with 0. 5 M sodium acetate. Chemical nucleotide analysis of spore and mycelial DNA showed no detectable difference in GC content. The aberrant nature of spore DNA was not affected by pronase or ribonuclease. Washing the spores with ethanol and acetone prior to DNA extraction restored the isolated DNA to normal buoyant density and Tm values. When alcohol and chloroform extracts of spores were dried and mixed with authentic DNA preparations, no change in Tm or buoyant density was found. Spore DNA was yellow in color at pH values below 12 and pink in color at values above 12. Spore DNA heated in high salt showed three characteristic peaks in Sephadex G- 100 column chromatography, but only one peak was found with comparably treated mycelial DNA. Attempts to characterize these peaks have been inconclusive to date. Chemical analyses of spore DNA showed 15 to 20 % Folin positive material, 40 to 50 % more phosphorus than mycelial DNA and no detectable sugars. It appeared that whatever was bound to the spore DNA could be partitioned to added DNA. Experiments of this type were successful only if the test DNA was added to freshly disrupted, dehydrated spores with crushed dry ice. Rehydration of spores showed loss of this binding activity. No chromatographically identifiable compounds or characteristic colors were extracted from spore DNA by a number of solvents and conditions including: acetone, ethanol, ethanol-ether, ethyl acetate, butanol, 8 M urea, 5 % cold trichloroacetic acid and 1 N KOH at 100 C for 30 min. A crude pigmented fraction was isolated from spores which had similar chemical characteristics as aberrant spore DNA. This pigment could not be demonstrated in mycelia; moreover, pigment production seemed to be directly correlated with the age of the spores. The data suggested that this pigment is probably bound to spore DNA and is responsible for the aberrant characteristics of S. venezuelae S 13 spore DNA...|$|R
