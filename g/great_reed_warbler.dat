25|$|The {{number of}} bird {{species of the}} river basin reduced sharply over the past 100–150 years. The {{disappeared}} species include steppe eagle, tirkusha, sociable lapwing, bustard, black and winged lark. Less common are geese, swans, golden eagle, white-tailed eagle, peregrine falcon, honey buzzard and osprey. The reduction is mainly caused by the destruction of forests, especially old groves along the river banks. The creation of artificial forest belts (windbreaks) in the basin in the 1960s brought insectivorous birds new to this area, such as Streptopelia, European magpie and shrikes. From the traditional bird types, still common are several species of ducks, crows, Charadriiformes, Podiceps, <b>great</b> <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> and much less common are herons and storks. Only 12 individuals of demoiselle cranes remain in the area, near Svyatogorsk city. During the migratory season, the region is visited by greylag and black geese.|$|E
2500|$|There are 185 [...] {{species of}} birds in the reservation, of which 120 are {{resident}} birds. Because of such large number of birds, including rare ones like night heron and spotted crake, Zasavica {{is included in the}} list of IBA, important bird areas. Since 1998, 20 artificial nesting platforms are placed throughout the reservation. Other species include common moorhen, little grebe, Eurasian coot, <b>great</b> <b>reed</b> <b>warbler,</b> little bittern, mallard, common quail, white stork, black stork, Eurasian bittern, white-tailed eagle, western marsh harrier, common kestrel, mute swan, northern lapwing, etc.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>great</b> <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> (Acrocephalus arundinaceus) {{is one of}} the few {{bird species}} that is {{polygynous}} and has a harem. Males provide resources to their harem, such as nest protection and varying levels of parental care. Females in the harem are able to breed at the same time, indicating that harem size and the number of male offspring are related. The most important factor when determining male fitness is the order in which he arrives to the territory. Males who arrive earlier increase the likelihood that they will obtain good nesting sites, improving their odds for attracting more females. Additionally, a greater song repertoire is correlated with an increase in harem size and increased male fitness because females prefer to mate with males that have a more extensive song repertoire. [...] It is also possible that broad song repertoires are a supplementary cue for a good mate, in conjunction with male territory size and quality. A wide-ranging song repertoire develops with age, and older males are more likely to dominate better territories, giving a plausible reason as to why females prefer older males. Although highly debated, female choice in the <b>great</b> <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> may be explained by the good genes theory. False paternity and decreased offspring survival are two factors which might contribute to a decrease in male fitness.|$|E
50|$|Notable {{animals in}} the park include the red deer, the crane, the white-tailed eagle and the osprey. Other animals include <b>great</b> bittern, <b>reed</b> <b>warbler,</b> redshank, greenshank, black stork, crane, teal, {{garganey}} and little stint.|$|R
50|$|Large {{numbers of}} ducks winter {{on the lake}} {{including}} tufted duck, pochard, goldeneye, teal and wigeon. Roosting birds include up to 10,000 black-headed gulls, 1000 common gulls and 300 cormorants. Breeding birds include <b>great</b> crested grebe, <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> and sedge warbler while lesser spotted woodpecker and little owl occur in the surrounding area.|$|R
50|$|In Hlinka {{district}} {{near the}} village of Slezské Pavlovice Velký Pavlovický rybník (The great pond) Natural Reserve is situated. This natural reserve was created to protect the unique habitat as this pond serves as a stopping place for birds during its spring and autumn migrations. During this time you may see many protected birds there such as the blue winged teal, bittern, water crake, snipe and <b>great</b> <b>reed</b> - <b>warbler</b> and during the summer time also many protected wetland and aquatic animals.|$|R
2500|$|The {{western edge}} of Coimbra is covered by the Reserva Natural do Paul de Arzila (Arzila Swamp Natural Reserve), which is {{designated}} both as a Special Protection Zone (...) and Special Conservation Zone (...) , coincident with the civil parish of Arzila (sometimes {{referred to as the}} Paul de Arzila or marsh of Arzila). It is a wetland that has sheltered migratory birds, and supports other animal and plant species; this has included predominantly avian species, such as the: Eurasian reed warbler (Acrocephalus scirpaceus), sedge warbler (Acrocephalus schoenobaenus), melodious warbler (Hippolais polyglotta), willow warbler (Phylloscopus trochilus), little bittern (Ixobrychus minutus), <b>great</b> <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> (Acrocephalus arundinaceus), and the Savi's warbler (Locustella luscinioides). The 482 hectare area, under threat from industrial, residential and agricultural pollution, expansion of aquatic plants and eutrophication, has forced the governmental reorganization of land use in order to promote models of sustainability, and rural use that does not affect the migratory and aquatic bird populations.|$|E
50|$|The Eurasian {{reed warbler}} looks {{similar to the}} <b>great</b> <b>reed</b> <b>warbler,</b> but the <b>great</b> <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> is larger in size and has a {{stronger}} supercilium.|$|E

5000|$|Studies {{were made}} of 90 <b>great</b> <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> nests in central Hungary. There was an [...] "unusually high" [...] {{frequency}} of common cuckoo parasitism, with 64% of the nests parasitised. Of the nests targeted by cuckoos, 64% contained one cuckoo egg, 23% had two, 10% had three and 3% had four common cuckoo eggs. In total, 58% of the common cuckoo eggs were laid in nests that were multiply parasitised. When laying eggs in nests already parasitised, the female cuckoos removed one egg at random, showing no discrimination between the <b>great</b> <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> eggs {{and those of other}} cuckoos.|$|E

It is considered monotypic, meaning there are no recognised subspecies. The species is known by the English common names Finsch's reed-warbler, Nauru warbler, pleasant warbler, the Nauru reed-warbler, and the Nauru <b>reed</b> <b>warbler.</b> In the native Nauruan language, it is known as Itsirir.

50|$|More than 100 {{host species}} have been recorded: meadow pipit, dunnock and Eurasian reed warbler {{are the most common}} hosts in {{northern}} Europe; garden warbler, meadow pipit, pied wagtail and European robin in central Europe; brambling and common redstart in Finland; and <b>great</b> <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> in Hungary.|$|E
50|$|When cuckoo chicks were {{reared in}} the nests of four hosts (reed warbler, <b>great</b> <b>reed</b> <b>warbler,</b> dunnock and meadow pipit), dunnock-cuckoos began begging {{more rapidly than}} reed warbler-cuckoos despite growing at the same rate.

50|$|Clamorous {{reed warbler}} {{is a large}} song thrush-sized warbler at 18-20 cm. The adult has an unstreaked brown back and whitish underparts.
