Repatriation also refers to the {{payment of a dividend}} by a foreign corporation to a U.S. corporation. This happens often where the foreign corporation is considered a [...] "controlled foreign corporation" [...] (CFC), which means that more than 50% of the foreign corporation is owned by U.S. shareholders. Generally, foreign direct investment in CFC's are not taxed until a dividend is paid to the controlling U.S. parent company, and is thus repatriated. The foreign <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> <b>income</b> of the CFC is taxed only by the country where it is incorporated until repatriation. At that time, income is subject to the (typically higher) U.S. tax rate minus the Foreign Tax Credits. (FN: See IRC 951-965) There are currently {{hundreds of billions of dollars}} of Foreign direct investment in CFC's because of the disincentive to repatriate those earnings.

The {{acceleration}} from the previous quarter reflected a pick up in household consumption, exports (net trade) and stockbuilding as businesses increased their holdings of inventories for the first time since late 2008. The UK corporate sector remains a net‐lender to the rest of the economy, mainly due the weakness of fixed capital spending. Cash reserves have been used to reduce liabilities (loans) rather than purchase new assets. The household sector became a net borrower in 2010 Q 2 for the first time since 2009 Q 1, mainly due to the fall in the saving ratio to 3. 2 per cent.

40|$|China's {{widening}} regional {{income inequality}} coupled with its pronounced regional disparity in {{foreign direct investment}} stock since 1990 has claimed the attention of many scholars. While some researchers confirm regional disparity in China's foreign direct investment, others attribute the widening regional income inequality to this regional disparity. This paper thus assesses the impacts of China's stock of foreign direct investment on its regional income inequality using simultaneous equation model and the Shapley value regression-based decomposition approach. Our results suggest that China's stock of foreign direct investment has accounted for merely 2 % of its regional income inequality. Furthermore, the contribution ratio of per capita foreign direct investment stock to China's regional income inequality has relatively been on a steady decline since 2002. The decomposition results also reveal that provincial per capita physical assets account for over 50 % of the nation's income inequality and 65 % of the increases in income inequality since 1990. The other two important determinants of regional income inequality are province location and educational level. However, educational level is {{found to have a}} decreasing effect on regional income inequality. Foreign <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> <b>Income</b> inequality Region...|$|E
40|$|The BPM {{contains}} {{the concept of}} direct investment. Direct investment {{is the relationship between}} an enterprise and a foreign investor which owns 10 per cent or more of the ordinary shares or voting power of an incorporated enterprise or the equivalent for an unincorporated enterprise. The internationally accepted OECD Benchmark Definition describes direct investment as an investment which has: " [...] . the objective of obtaining a lasting interest by a resident entity in one economy ("direct investor") in an enterprise resident in an economy other than that of the investor ("direct investment enterprise"). The lasting interest implies the existence of a long-term relationship between the direct investor and the enterprise and a significant degree of influence on the management of the enterprise [...] . " Earnings of direct investment enterprises which are not distributed as dividends or remitted to direct investors are called reinvested earnings. The BPM 5 records reinvested earnings as being distributed to direct investors in proportion to their equity ownership in the enterprise, and then being reinvested into the same enterprise. Reinvested earnings are recorded as <b>Direct</b> <b>Investment</b> <b>Income</b> in the Current Account and as a transaction in equity in the Financial Account...|$|E
40|$|According to the {{environmental}} Kuznets curve hypothesis, environmental degradation increases {{in the early stages}} of growth, but it eventually decreases as income exceeds a threshold level. It is thus often argued that if international trade increases incomes then it can also have a positive impact on environmental quality. So far, these hypotheses have been widely empirically tested for the developed countries. However, it is still uncertain whether positive effects of international trade on growth and on the environment may also hold in developing countries. One of the major difficulties in testing these relations in developing countries is the poor quality of environment related data. In this analysis this problem is reduced by constructing a structural equation model (SEM) with three latent variables defined as environment quality, health care and structural changes. It is further assumed that these latent variables are correlated with each other and are described by their available outcomes, access to an improved water source, health-adjusted life expectancy, fertilizer use intensity, industrial carbon dioxide emissions etc., and indicators, structure of international trade by region and by commodity group, amount of international aid received by the country, foreign <b>direct</b> <b>investment,</b> <b>income</b> per capita etc. Using LISREL software, these structural relationships are combined into one comprehensive model.

40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to investigate a}} supply function for electricity in Portugal through cointegration and causality analysis over the sample period of 1970 to 2008 to test hypotheses related to the electricity-economic growth nexus in the literature. Evidence is found in favour of cointegration among electricity generation from renewable sources, real gross domestic product, inward foreign <b>direct</b> <b>investment,</b> carbon emissions from electricity production and population size in Portugal by using the bound testing approach to cointegration and error correction models developed within an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) framework. Evidence from Granger causality tests show that unidirectional causality is running from renewable electricity production to foreign <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> in the short-run, and indicate the presence of bilateral causality among renewable electricity production, inward foreign <b>direct</b> <b>investment,</b> real <b>income</b> and population. The joint short- and long-run Granger causality tests provide further support for the feedback hypothesis. These findings have important policy implications, since the promotion of appropriate structural policies aiming at attracting foreign <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> can induce conservation and efficient electricity use without obstructing economic growth. The promotion of foreign <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> is crucial in boosting Portugal’s socio-economic development towards a more efficiency-orientated and less resource-depleting economy. ...|$|R
40|$|Recognizing {{the complex}} inter-correlation between FDI, {{emission}} {{and the three}} economic determinants of emission, we constructed a simultaneous model to study the FDI-emission nexus in China by exploring both the dynamic recursive FDI entry decision and the linkage from FDI entry to final emission results under the intermediation of the scale, composition and technique effects. The model is then estimated on the panel data of China’s 29 provinces’ industrial SO 2 emission. Result shows that, exerting through different channels; the total impact of FDI on industrial SO 2 emission is very small. With 1 % increase in FDI capital stock, industrial SO 2 emission will increase by 0. 099 %, in which the emission increase caused by impact of FDI on economic growth and composition transformation cancels out the emission reduction result due to FDI’s role in reinforcement of environmental regulation. By introducing to the simultaneous system the recursive dynamism that supposes FDI entry decision to depend on last period’s economic growth and environmental regulation stringency, our model also provides convincing supportive evidences for ‘Pollution haven’ hypothesis. Although FDI enterprises in China generally produce with higher pollution efficiency, the rise in environmental regulation stringency still has modest deterrent effect on FDI capital inflow. Furthermore, the composition transformation impact of FDI in China seems {{to be dominated by}} the inflow of foreign capital pursuing a ‘production platform’ that provides lower pollution regulation compliance cost. composition effect, scale effect, simultaneous system, industrial SO 2 emission, foreign <b>direct</b> <b>investment,</b> <b>income</b> effect, and pollution haven hypothesis...|$|E
40|$|Most {{studies of}} tax {{competition}} and the {{race to the bottom}} focus on potential host countries competing for mobile capital, neglecting the role of corporate tax planning and of home governments that facilitate this planning. This neglect in part reflects the narrow view frequently taken of the policy instruments that countries have available in tax competition. But high-tax host governments can, for example, permit income to be shifted out to tax havens as a way of attracting mobile companies. Home countries will cooperate in this shift if their companies? gain is greater than any reduction in the domestic tax base. We use various types of U. S. data, including firm level tax files, to identify the role of the three parties (host governments, home governments and MNCs) in the evolution of tax burdens on U. S. companies abroad from 1992 to 2002. This period is of particular interest because the United States introduced regulations in 1997 that greatly simplified the use of more aggressive tax planning techniques. The evidence indicates that from 1992 to 1998 the decline in effective tax rates on U. S. companies was driven largely by host governments defending their market share. But after 1998, tax avoidance behavior seems much more important. One indication is that effective tax rates on U. S. companies had a much weaker link with local statutory tax rates. After 1997, the new regulations motivated a very large growth in intercompany payments and a parallel growth of holding company income abroad. We attempt to estimate how many of these payments were deductible in the host country, and conclude that by 2002 the companies were saving about $ 7. 0 billion per year by using the more aggressive planning strategies. This amounts to about 4 percent of companies? foreign <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> <b>income</b> and about 15 percent of their foreign tax burden...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the authors {{undertake}} an ex-post evaluation {{of whether the}} special economic zones (SEZs) introduced in Poland in 1994 {{have been successful in}} meeting regional development objectives. They evaluate the policy of as many of its objectives as possible: employment creation, business creation (which includes attracting foreign <b>direct</b> <b>investment),</b> <b>income</b> or wage effects, and environmental sustainability. They use different panel data methods to investigate this question at the powiat and gmina levels in Poland during the 1995 - 2011 period. It is also possible to include numerous controls to reduce the problem of the omitted variables bias such as education level, dependency rates, state ownership, general subsidies and whether the area is urban or rural. The results indicate that SEZs in Poland have been successful in a number of their objectives such as private business creation. The positive effect of the policy however mainly comes through foreign direct investment (FDI), whereas the effects on e. g. investment and employment are small or insignificant. In other areas, such as securing higher income levels and locking firms into the sustainability agenda through the adoption of green technologies and reduced air pollution, the authors find only a small positively moderating effect of the policy on what are traditionally economically disadvantaged areas in Poland that used to be dependent on the socialist production model. Hence, despite high levels of FDI, the zones policy has not managed to overcome the legacy of backwardness or lagging regions. The main policy implication of the paper is that SEZs may be successful in stimulating activity in the short run but the policy must be seen as one of necessary temporality and can therefore not stand alone. Before launching SEZs, policymakers must have plans in place for follow up measures to ensure the longer term competitiveness and sustainability implications of such an initiative. There is a need to understand the connection between the specific incentive schemes used (in this particular case tax incentives were used) and the kinds of firms and activities they attract, including the behavioral models that those incentives promote...|$|E

40|$|This thesis’ aim was {{to explore}} the {{diffusion}} of the internet, and which capabilities were necessary to successfully diffuse the technologies in low- and middle income countries. The thesis is a panel data analysis of fifteen mainland African countries with {{a significant number of}} internet users today, through a time series of ten years – 2006 - 2015. The study aims to give indications to implications for investors and policy makers where internet technology investments are concerned, and to contribute to the current academic research on the field of internet diffusion in low and middle income countries. The literature review showed that some research has already been done in this field, but the research is mostly focused on other regions or different stages of economic development or even outdated – as studies quickly become in a field with as quick development as information and communication technology. The literature review is the background for the hypothesis for this thesis, that foreign <b>direct</b> <b>investment,</b> <b>income,</b> technological infrastructure and adoptability – proxied through mobile phone subscriptions, access price and education were the most important variables to explain growth in internet users. These variables were all analyzed. The panel data study showed that of these explanatory variables, mobile phone subscriptions, secondary education and access point were the significant variables in the study. While the other variables were insignificant, it is likely that some are insignificant due to other reasons than that they are insignificant themselves. Foreign direct investment has in other research been linked strongly to human capital, and because the countries in this study is varying highly in human capital, this could lead to an expected insignificance. Primary and tertiary education both has very variable data, and on primary school, some countries reduce their enrollment over the time period while others increase. This makes the regression pull in different directions. The findings in this study may be generalized to countries of similar development, and to countries about to enter the same levels of economic development, even though they are now on the lower end, and can give some indication to the many initiatives working with internet infrastructure in low income countries in the region. However, it is important to not only look at what grows internet usage in the country, even though it is closely linked to economic growth, but also remember how internet access can help grow other parts of the society, and increase the value of health care, education etc. This study is rather limited in both number of samples and number of variables, and even though the results in this analysis is quite clear, more research is needed on the area to give a clearer and more precise picture of the capabilities countries needs to successfully diffuse internet technologies...|$|E

First, the theoretical and empirical literature on the distributional effect of FDI is outlined. Second, we discuss briefly general trends in FDI inflow and income inequality in the countries from CEE after 1990. Third, we estimate several fixed effects regression models and find that FDI {{has the potential to}} exert influence on income inequality but this effect varies depending on the level of education and economic development of the host countries...|$|R
40|$|Tax {{policy is}} one of the most {{important}} policy in consideration of investment development in certain industry. Research by Newlon (1987), Swenson (1994) and Hines (1996) concluded that tax rate {{is one of}} the most important thing considered by investors in a foreign <b>direct</b> <b>investment.</b> One of tax policy could be used to attract foreign <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> is <b>income</b> tax incentives. The attractiveness of income tax incentives to a foreign <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> is as much as the attractiveness to a domestic investment (Anwar and Mulyadi, 2012). In this paper, we have conducted a study of income tax incentives in food and agriculture industry; where we conduct a thorough study of income tax incentives and corporate performance in Indonesian and Australian food and agriculture industry. Our research show that there is a significant influence of income tax incentives to corporate performance. Based on our study, we conclude that the significant influence of income tax incentives to Indonesian corporate performance somewhat in a higher degree than the Australian peers. We have also concluded that Indonesian government provide a relatively more interesting income tax incentives compare to Australian government. However, an average method of net income –a method applied in Australia– could be considered by Indonesian government to avoid a market price fluctuation in this industry.  </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} we explore the {{relationship}} between the investments of multinational corporations (foreign <b>direct</b> <b>investment)</b> and <b>income</b> inequality in Mexico. We argue that Mexico s liberalization of foreign <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> (FDI) inflows in the 1990 s provides a natural experiment to test how FDI affects income inequality in a middle-income country. We use an instrumental variables approach as our identification strategy to mitigate problems of endogeneity and omitted variable bias. In an empirical test of the determinants of changes in income inequality from 1990 to 2000, we find that increased FDI inflows are associated with a decrease in income inequality within Mexico s thirty-two states.

40|$|We {{develop an}} {{overlapping}} generations {{model of a}} developing economy in which ‘culture’ and technology interact to determine savings, investment and growth. Investment is assumed to involve intermediation or other costs which may, in each period, result in either of two stable equilibria for the savings rate. At the “good” equilibrium, savings and growth are higher than at the “bad” equilibrium, whether the country attains the good or bad equilibrium in any period depends on each individual’s belief about the savings behavior of other agents in the economy. The model implies that fiscal policy or public activities to facilitate private investment can influence saving. In particular, a sustained period of fiscal restraint can shift the economy onto a higher savings and growth path.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} state corporate income taxes on the location of foreign <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> in the U. S., {{taking into account the}} endogeneity of taxes and the outside options of investors. States have a set of characteristics that influence investors' decisions, some of them are not observable by a researcher but states take them into account when they set taxes. States can also act strategically with respect to other states when setting taxes. The former behavior bias the estimated tax effects because it creates correlation between the error term and the tax rate. The latter behavior directly implies an endogenous tax rate. I adapt a discrete choice model of differentiated products to estimate the tax effects. This approach allows me {{at the same time to}} control for the outside options of investors and to use instrumental variables to solve the problem of tax endogeneity. I find the tax elasticity to be consistently around - 1. Foreign <b>Direct</b> <b>Investment,</b> State Corporate <b>Income</b> Taxes, Tax Endogeneity. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{government}} of Sri Lanka {{is to move}} their policy both taxes and foreign <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> as an <b>income</b> factors. The main objective {{of this study is}} to explore the Cointegration relationship between tax revenue and foreign <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> in Sri Lanka and also this study has some sub objectives. To achieve these objectives, both TAX and FDI data are collected from the year 1990 to 2013 as a sample periods. All collected data are analyzed based on the regression method. Especially this analyze is considering the constant elasticity model. As per the results of the regression outcome, the FDI is contributing 77 percent on the TAX revenue in the Sample period. As well as, both TAX and FDI variables encompass long run relationship between them. Finally this study suggests to policy makers of the Sri Lankan government that, they have to take indispensable action to increase the FDI, for the reason that, the FDI is one of the income generating factors of the Sri Lankan economy...|$|R

Using panel co-integration and causality techniques that are robust to omitted variables, slope heterogeneity, and endogenous regressors, we find that: (1) FDI has a positive short-run effect on income inequality in Europe, (2) the long-run effect of FDI on inequality, however, is negative on average, (3) long-run causality runs in both directions, suggesting that an increase in FDI reduces income inequality and, in turn, higher inequality leads to lower FDI inflows, and (4) there are large differences in the long-run effect of FDI on income inequality, with two countries (Ireland and Spain) exhibiting {{a positive relationship between}} FDI and income inequality...|$|R

40|$|This study employs state-level panel data {{to explore}} the {{relationship}} between inward foreign <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> (FDI) and <b>income</b> inequality in the United States. Using panel cointegration techniques that allow for cross-sectional heterogeneity, cross-sectional dependence, and endogenous regressors, {{we find that the}} short-run effects of FDI on income inequality are insignificant or weakly significant and negative. In the long run, however, FDI exerts a significant and robust negative effect on income inequality in the United States. This result for the United States as a whole does not imply that FDI narrows income gaps in the long run in each individual state. There is considerable heterogeneity in the long-run effects of FDI on income inequality across states, with some states (21 out of 48 cases) exhibiting a positive relationship between FDI in income inequality...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we examine the {{relationship}} between the establishment of the Kayelekera Uranium Mine in northern Malawi and HIV/AIDS incidence. The establishment of mining industries is on the rise in this region and the subsequent health impacts are a major concern to governments and the general public. To analyse this topic, we use both a qualitative and a quantitative approach. We find that HIV incidence peaked during 2009 and that this to a large extent is explained by higher income levels in the district. Higher incomes were shown to affect HIV prevalence through increased consumption of alcohol and subsequent risky sexual behaviour. This paper contributes to the literature of how large foreign <b>direct</b> <b>investments</b> and positive <b>income</b> shocks affect HIV/AIDS incidence and risky sexual behaviour in Sub-Saharan Africa...|$|R
