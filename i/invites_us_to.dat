500|$|Nobody, {{according}} to Hazlitt (voicing his disagreement with Dr. Johnson), excelled Shakespeare in tragedy; although his comedies could be first rate, other writers, such as Molière, Cervantes, and Rabelais, excelled {{him in some}} types of comedy. It was in the comedy of [...] "Nature" [...] that Shakespeare was supreme. This is not comedy that satirises the [...] "ridiculous" [...] but is rather the comedy of [...] "convivial laughter", which gently mocks human foibles and <b>invites</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> share in innocent pleasures. [...] Of this kind of comedy, Twelfth Night is [...] "one of the most delightful". Unlike the [...] "comedy of artificial life, of wit, of satire," [...] Shakespeare's more gentle comedy [...] "makes us laugh at the follies of mankind, not despise them [...] Shakespear's comic genius resembles the bee rather in its power of extracting sweets from weeds or poisons, than in leaving a sting behind it." ...|$|E

Writing for the Idolator, Mike Wass noted that the cover artwork gives one a clear idea regarding what to expect from the video, seeing that it [...] "reinvents Gaga as a rockstar" [...] and the [...] "epilepsy induced editing brings the whole thing to life". However he missed the theatricality associated with the singer's previous videos. Caitlyn Callegari from Bustle compared the clip with that of experiencing a Gaga concert from the front row and called it [...] "appealing" [...] since it had the singer's [...] "patented stylistic melodrama while also maintaining an air of realness to it".

Furthermore, we discover that no physical changes have occurred in our brains or bodies that would explain this phenomenon.

Accordingly this text raises significant questions about the development of ‘affective’ modes of piety and the concept of Marian compassion, both of which are closely linked with meditations on Mary’s presence at the cross in the later Christian tradition. In particular, this new evidence <b>invites</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> rethink certain explanations of these phenomena that would link their genesis to the end of iconoclasm in the East (the ninth century) and the beginnings of the High Middle Ages in the West (the eleventh century). In the case of the Christian East, the importance of this early Life of the Virgin for understanding the emergence of new styles of Marian devotion is unmistakably clear. Yet its potential influence on similar developments in the Christian West is somewhat less certain and difficult to ascertain. Nevertheless, even if it may ultimately prove impossible to connect all of the dots between this late ancient text and the piety of the Western High Middle Ages, it seems increasingly clear that we have to reckon with the initial emergence of Marian lament and compassion and affective devotion in rather different historical circumstances than have traditionally been envisaged.|$|E
