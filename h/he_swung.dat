5|$|In August 1979, {{the band}} entered Wessex Studios to begin {{recording}} London Calling. The Clash asked Guy Stevens {{to produce the}} album, much {{to the dismay of}} CBS Records. Stevens had alcohol and drug problems and his production methods were unconventional. During a recording session <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> a ladder and upturned chairs – apparently to create a rock & roll atmosphere. The Clash, especially bassist Paul Simonon, got along well with Stevens, and found Stevens' work to be very helpful and productive to both Simonon's playing and their recording as a band. The album was recorded during a five- to six-week period involving 18-hour days, with many songs recorded in one or two takes.|$|E
5|$|John {{initially}} {{adopted a}} defensive posture {{similar to that}} of 1199: avoiding open battle and carefully defending his key castles. John's operations became more chaotic as the campaign progressed, and Philip began to make steady progress in the east. John became aware in July that Arthur's forces were threatening his mother, Eleanor, at Mirebeau Castle. Accompanied by William de Roches, his seneschal in Anjou, <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> his mercenary army rapidly south to protect her. His forces caught Arthur by surprise and captured the entire rebel leadership at the battle of Mirebeau. With his southern flank weakening, Philip was forced to withdraw in the east and turn south himself to contain John's army.|$|E
5|$|Sherman {{settled into}} a siege of Atlanta, {{shelling}} the city and sending raids west {{and south of the}} city to cut off the supply lines from Macon, Georgia. Both of Sherman's cavalry raids were defeated by superior southern horsemen. Following the failure to break the Confederates' hold on the city, Sherman began to employ a new strategy. <b>He</b> <b>swung</b> his entire army in a broad flanking maneuver to the west. Finally, on August 31, at Jonesborough, Georgia, Sherman's army captured the railroad track from Macon, pushing the Confederates to Lovejoy's Station. With his supply lines fully severed, Hood pulled his troops out of Atlanta the next day, September 1, destroying supply depots as he left to prevent them from falling into Union hands. He also set fire to eighty-one loaded ammunition cars, which led to a conflagration watched by hundreds.|$|E

5|$|As Wing Commander Kellett {{was taking}} off, Schumacher was dismissing {{any idea that}} the British would attempt a bombing raid in clear weather. On the island of Wangerooge, Leutnant Hermann Diehl of Regiment 3, battery LN-Vers was demonstrating the Freya set to a visiting naval officer. Diehl was using Falck's 2./ZG 76 to test the set. After some demonstration, <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> the set north, {{pointing}} to the Heliogoland Bight. As soon {{as he did so}} he picked up an echo. He telephoned Schumacher's Geschwader at Jever. They were told that the naval radar reported nothing, and that it was ridiculous to think the British would attack in such clear skies. Diehl spoke to von Bülow-Bothkamp. No one wanted to know. Some 20 minutes later, naval Freyas also picked up the formation, but still no fighters were scrambled. German radar was just as efficient as its British counterpart, the problem lay in communication. The British married their radar to an efficient fighter control system. The Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine had poor communication and their areas of responsibility overlapped, creating confusion over who was responsible. Added to this was the German disbelief that RAF Bomber Command would expose itself on a day when conditions favoured the fighter. Only when observers on the ground confirmed that the formation existed were fighters scrambled. The observers described a formation of 44 British aircraft, twice its actual strength.|$|E
5|$|Ayutthaya sat on {{an island}} {{surrounded}} by three rivers—the Lopburi River to the north, the Chao Phraya River {{to the west and}} south, and the Pa Sak River to the east, forming a formidable natural moat. The Chao Phraya basin where Ayutthaya is situated was low and prone to flooding—especially intense during the rainy season when torrential waters flowed in great quantity from the north along the Lopburi River. This flood would begin approximately in July and end somewhere between October and November, giving Tabinshwehti only five months to capture Ayutthaya—otherwise his camp grounds and supply routes would be flooded. There was also the possibility that the flood could trap his forces. The low, swampy area around the city was laced with numerous canals thronging with gun boats armed with cannon to repulse any attempt at an attack on the city. Also, the Burmese had only small cannon that they had brought with them, while the Siamese had large cannon mounted along the city walls. The Burmese had the city surrounded, but without the ability to cross the rivers or breach the city walls with cannon fire, were left to camp around it instead, while the interconnected waterways to the north and south made it fairly easy to resupply the defenders in the city. Fifty Portuguese mercenaries, who had elected Galeote Pereira as their captain, defended the weakest part of the city wall for Maha Chakkraphat. Unable to take the city conventionally, Tabinshwehti offered bribes to these defenders. The Portuguese reacted with derision, and refused. When a Siamese commander heard of this, <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> open the gates of the city and dared the Burmese King to bring the money—a dare that was ignored.|$|E
25|$|Farmer Weaver was a catcher-outfielder for Louisville. I {{tipped his}} bat several {{times when he}} had two strikes on him one year, and each time the umpire called him out. He got even, though. One time there were two strikes on him and <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> as the pitch was coming in. But he didn't swing at the ball. <b>He</b> <b>swung</b> right at my wrists. Sometimes I think I can still feel the pain. I'll tell you I didn't tip his bat again. No, sir, not until the last {{game of the season}} and Weaver was at bat for the last time. When he had two strikes, I tipped his bat again and got away with it.|$|E

25|$|Taylor {{was noted}} for his {{deliberate}} {{approach to the}} wicket and the rhythmical nature of his bowling action that involved him first swinging his bowling arm, joining hands as <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> forwards then completing a loop of his joined hands before delivering the ball. He was noted as a heavy spinner of a cricket ball and comparisons were made with Ashley Mallett, the former Australian spin bowler.|$|E
25|$|The two men {{moved to}} {{face each other}} within a few feet. At some point, Smith {{suddenly}} swung his rifle off his shoulder and struck at Reid. Whether intending to shoot at that moment or to club Reid aside is uncertain. Reid raised his left arm to block the fast-approaching barrel. It struck and cut his arm, {{but he managed to}} grab the barrel and yank it away from the general direction of his head and press it downward. The Daily Alaskan wrote that Reid grabbed the rifle barrel without being cut, but that during the scuffle, Smith pulled it free and hit Reid’s arm as <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> the rifle at Reid again.|$|E

25|$|An {{opponent}} of the British Empire, Hearst opposed American involvement in the First World War and attacked {{the formation of the}} League of Nations. His newspapers abstained from endorsing any candidate in 1920 and 1924. Hearst's last bid for office came in 1922 when he was backed by Tammany Hall leaders for the U.S. Senate nomination in New York. Al Smith vetoed this, earning the lasting enmity of Hearst. Although Hearst shared Smith's opposition to Prohibition, <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> his papers behind Herbert Hoover in the 1928 presidential election. Hearst's support for Franklin D. Roosevelt at the 1932 Democratic National Convention, via his allies William Gibbs McAdoo and John Nance Garner, can also be seen as part of his vendetta against Smith, who was an {{opponent of}} Roosevelt's at that convention.|$|E
25|$|In the {{continuation}} of the reading, Moses instructed that when the Israelites had settled in the land, they were to divide the land into three parts and set aside three Cities of Refuge, so that any manslayer could have a place to which to flee. And if the Israelites faithfully observed all the law and God enlarged the territory, then they were to add three more towns to those three. Only a manslayer who had killed another unwittingly, without being the other's enemy, might flee there and live. For instance, if a man went with his neighbor into a grove to cut wood, and as <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> an axe, the axe-head flew off the handle and struck and killed the neighbor, then the man could flee to one of the cities of refuge and live. The second open portion ends here.|$|E
25|$|As {{the entire}} Balkans became an {{integral}} part of the growing Ottoman Empire (a process that concluded with the fall of Constantinople to Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror in 1453), Wallachia became engaged in frequent confrontations in the final years of the reign of Mircea I (r. 1386–1418). Mircea initially defeated the Ottomans in several battles, including the Battle of Rovine in 1394, driving them away from Dobruja and briefly extending his rule to the Danube Delta, Dobruja and Silistra (c. 1400–1404). <b>He</b> <b>swung</b> between alliances with Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, and Jagiellon Poland (taking part in the Battle of Nicopolis), and accepted a peace treaty with the Ottomans in 1417, after Mehmed I took control of Turnu Măgurele and Giurgiu. The two ports remained part of the Ottoman state, with brief interruptions, until 1829. In 1418–1420, Michael I defeated the Ottomans in Severin, only to be killed in battle by the counter-offensive; in 1422, the danger was averted for a short while when Dan II inflicted a defeat on Murad II with the help of Pippo Spano.|$|E
50|$|At Dresden on 25 July 1920, Görner {{lifted the}} {{enormous}} weight of nearly 200 kg overhead in the Two Hands ‘Anyhow’ style, performing the feat with four kettleweights {{in the following}} manner. <b>He</b> first <b>swung</b> with the right hand to arms length, two kettleweights, one weighing 110+1/4 lb. and the other 99+1/4 lb. Still holding the bells overhead, he then bent {{down and picked up}} with the left hand a third kettleweight weighing 110+1/4 lb, which <b>he</b> then <b>swung</b> to arms length and transferred to the thumb of the right hand. Then, still holding the three kettleweights overhead in his right hand, he lowered his body carefully and with the left hand picked up the fourth kettleweight, which <b>he</b> slowly <b>swung</b> to arms length. The combined weight then held overhead for the referee’s court was, as has been stated, no less than 430 English pounds, or 195.5 kilograms.|$|R

25|$|On the January 4, 2010, live-three-hour, Monday night {{edition of}} Impact! Sting {{returned}} to the Impact! Zone appearing in the rafters of the arena. Sting reappeared two months later on March 8, appearing as {{he was going to}} help a bloodied Hulk Hogan and Abyss during a match {{at the beginning of the}} show against A.J. Styles and Ric Flair. Instead <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> his baseball bat on Hogan and Abyss, turning heel as a result. He was later defeated by the debuting Rob Van Dam. Sting would continuously attack Van Dam with his bat after the match, completing his heel turn by attacking security guards and Hulk Hogan. On the March 22 edition of Impact! Sting was announced as the captain of Team Flair in the annual Lethal Lockdown match, where they would meet Team Hogan, captained by Abyss. At Lockdown Team Flair (Sting, Desmond Wolfe, Robert Roode and James Storm) were defeated by Team Hogan (Abyss, Jeff Jarrett, Rob Van Dam and Jeff Hardy). On May 3, Sting explained his actions to Hogan and was later attacked from behind by Jeff Jarrett. At Sacrifice Sting assaulted Jarrett prior to their match and then dragged him in to the ring, where he managed to score a pinfall in seconds over his bloodied opponent, leaving him injured. On the following edition of Impact! the TNA Championship Committee ranked Sting number one in the rankings and as a result he was granted a shot at Rob Van Dam's World Heavyweight Championship at Slammiversary VIII. Sting then attacked Eric Bischoff with his baseball bat, biting the hand that fed him. Sting later promised that he would reveal the motives behind his actions after winning the World Heavyweight Championship. At Slammiversary VIII Jeff Jarrett made his return and cost Sting his title match against Rob Van Dam.|$|E
25|$|The England innings {{began with}} 10 extras from Jeff Thomson with Rod Marsh leaping behind the stumps in vain as one ball lifted {{over the heads}} of the batsman and wicketkeeper for four. Thereafter wickets fell {{regularly}} with the Hillites cheering on the fast bowlers, but it was Max Walker (2/77) who made the breakthrough when <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> the ball to the edge of Dennis Amiss's bat to see it superbly caught by Mallett in the gully. Thomson took a surprisingly good catch to dismiss Lloyd off a Lillee bouncer and then beat Cowdrey three balls in a row before the master was caught by McCosker at short leg. This left England 69/3, but Edrich and Fletcher saw the day out safely enough. One ball from the captain was driven full into McCosker's face, knocking him unconscious for five minutes and he was helped off the field. Mallet was brought on at the end of the day, but asked to be taken off after one over because of his bruised had from that morning. Returning on the third day Thomson was bowling at his fastest and took 1/12 off five overs, having Edrich missed by Redpath in the slips, Greig caught by Greg Chappell and almost having Alan Knott out on the second, third and fourth balls he faced, dropped by Marsh, a caught behind not given and almost bowled by an inswinger. Fletcher was hit on the head by a bouncer and was caught by Redpath off Walker to leave England were 123/5, their top order failing again. After his escape Knott rode his luck and sliced 11 fours in an innings of 82, adding 57 with Edrich (50), 60 with Fred Titmus (22) and 33 with Derek Underwood (27). Knott and Underwood took 14 runs off one Lillee over and Ian Chappell had to set a defensive field for the first time in the series. The wicketkeeper was finally dismissed leaning back ready to cut the short ball and had his stumps flattened by a Thomson half-volley, but Lillee repeatedly bounced the tailenders and gave Bob Willis a beamer which fortunately missed his head. Willis was bowled by Thomson (4/74) and Lillee took the last wicket, having Underwood caught by Walker when he drove high into the covers. England were out for 295, having saved the follow on, which looked unlikely at one point, but still 110 runs behind.|$|E

500|$|Aside from {{swinging}} {{with increased}} line-drive contact and hitting fastballs with more authority, very little has actually {{changed in the}} catcher's approach. [...] One trait that has always persisted is that Molina is an aggressive and free-swinging – but high-contact – hitter. [...] Through 2012, <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> at more than 51% percent of the pitches he saw – he {{has a reputation for}} swinging at pitches {{in and out of the}} strike zone, low and away and even in toward his hands. [...] Because of his free-swinging tendency, he naturally has a walk rate (7.1%) below the Major League average (8.4%). [...] Combined with his ability to put the bat on the ball quite frequently (87%) and his improved approach at the plate, he increased his career-high single-season batting average five times between 2006 and 2013.|$|E
500|$|After {{getting married}} in early 1946 to Jeanne Dillinger, Seerey started the 1946 Cleveland Indians season working with Boudreau to fix his hitting, as his lunge when <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> the bat was causing him to strike out too often and not hit enough home runs. The change worked, as {{by the start of}} July Seerey had a team-leading 11 home runs. His second half {{performance}} included a doubleheader against the Chicago White Sox where he hit a home run in each game; the second home run landed in the upper deck of Cleveland Municipal Stadium, a feat that at the time had only been matched by fellow Indians outfielder Jeff Heath. He finished the season with a [...]225 batting average, 26 home runs, 62 RBIs, and 101 strikeouts. The 26 home runs were fourth in the league, and for the third straight year Seerey led the league in strikeouts.|$|E
500|$|Carlo De Marchis, {{the special}} make-up effects supervisor, and Colin Arthur, former Studio Head of Madame Tussaud's, were {{responsible}} for the human dummies and fake body parts used in the film. The dummies inflated crowd numbers and stood in as dead bodies, while the body parts were used in scenes showing the aftermath of fights and the cult's cannibalistic feast. In Thulsa Doom's beheading scene, Schwarzenegger hacked at a dummy and pulled a concealed chain to detach its head. [...] The decapitation of Conan's mother was more complex: a Plexiglas shield between Jones and Nadiuska stopped his sword as <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> at her and an artificial head then dropped into the camera's view. [...] A more elaborate head was used for the close-up shots; this prop spurted blood and the movements of its eyes, mouth, and tongue were controlled by cables hidden beneath the snow.|$|E
