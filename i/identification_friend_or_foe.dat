5|$|By the summer, 1940, the Chain Home radar {{stations}} {{along the}} English and Scottish coasts {{was able to}} track incoming aircraft from continental Europe at all but the lowest altitudes. The best detection altitude was 20,000 feet. Aircraft at this height could be detected over 100 miles away. To assess their identity, IFF (<b>Identification</b> <b>Friend</b> <b>or</b> <b>Foe)</b> could, {{by means of a}} distinctive blip on radar screens, distinguish German and British aircraft.|$|E
5|$|A {{subsequent}} USAF investigation {{blamed the}} accident on several factors. The F-15 pilots were faulted for misidentifying the helicopters as hostile. Also, {{the crew members}} of the AWACS aircraft were blamed for their inaction in failing to exercise appropriate control and for not intervening in the situation. In addition, the <b>identification</b> <b>friend</b> <b>or</b> <b>foe</b> (IFF) systems had not functioned to identify the helicopters to the F-15 pilots. Furthermore, USAF leaders had failed to adequately integrate U.S. Army helicopter operations into overall OPC air operations. As {{a result of the}} investigation several USAF officers received administrative discipline but only one, Jim Wang, an AWACS crew member, was tried by military court-martial, in which he was acquitted.|$|E
5|$|The {{difficulties}} of night fighting {{was evident in}} the performance of the night-fighter squadrons. One Fairey Battle was shot down in error by a Blenheim which could not correctly identify the aircraft; some other Blenheims crashed after being caught in the glare of search lights at low-level and return-fire from German bombers had inflicted at least one loss whilst 29 Squadron succeeded on bring down only one German aircraft. While <b>identification</b> <b>friend</b> <b>or</b> <b>foe</b> (IFF) devices had been fitted to some British aircraft they were not always switched on. Braham also experienced technical malfunctions in the Blenheims which prompted him to call into question their reliability. On one occasion the hydraulic pipe fractured in the Blenheim he was flying which caused the landing gear to fail and prompted Braham to force-land. At this time he was joined by his gunner/observer Bill Gregory with whom he was to fly frequently.|$|E

5|$|The {{two largest}} {{users of the}} Harrier were the Royal Air Force and the United States Marine Corps (USMC). The {{exported}} model of the aircraft operated by the USMC was designated the AV-8A Harrier, which was broadly similar to the RAF's Harrier GR.1. Changes included the removal of all magnesium components, which corroded quickly at sea, and the integration of American radios and <b>Identification</b> <b>Friend</b> <b>or</b> <b>Foe</b> (IFF) systems; furthermore the outer pylons, unlike the RAF aircraft, were designed from delivery to be equipped with self-defence AIM-9 Sidewinder heat-seeking air-to-air missiles. Most of the AV-8As had been delivered with the more powerful Pegasus engine used in the GR.3 instead of the one used in the earlier GR.1. Two-seat Harriers were operated for training purposes; the body was stretched and a taller tail fin added. The RAF trained in the T.2 and T.4 versions, while T.4N and T.8 were training versions the Navy's Sea Harrier, with appropriate fittings. The US and Spain flew the TAV-8A and TAV-8S, respectively.|$|E
5|$|In 1940 Alvarez {{joined the}} Radiation Laboratory (MIT), where he {{contributed to a}} number of World War II radar projects, from early {{improvements}} to <b>Identification</b> <b>friend</b> <b>or</b> <b>foe</b> (IFF) radar beacons, now called transponders, to a system known as VIXEN for preventing enemy submarines from realizing that they had been found by the new airborne microwave radars. Enemy submarines would wait until the radar signal was getting strong and then submerge, escaping attack. But VIXEN transmitted a radar signal whose strength was the cube of the distance to the submarine so that as they approached the sub, the signal—as measured by the sub—got progressively weaker, and the sub assumed the plane was getting farther away and didn't submerge. The radar system for which Alvarez is best known and which has {{played a major role in}} aviation, most particularly in the post war Berlin airlift, was Ground Controlled Approach (GCA). Alvarez spent a few months at the University of Chicago working on nuclear reactors for Enrico Fermi before coming to Los Alamos to work for Robert Oppenheimer on the Manhattan project. Alvarez worked on the design of explosive lenses, and the development of exploding-bridgewire detonators. As a member of Project Alberta, he observed the Trinity nuclear test from a B-29 Superfortress, and later the bombing of Hiroshima from the B-29 The Great Artiste.|$|E

40|$|Target {{recognition}} and identification in battlefields {{has been a}} crucial determinant to the ultimate {{success or failure of}} modern military campaigns. Since World War II, the <b>Identification</b> of <b>Friend</b> <b>or</b> <b>Foe</b> (IFF) systems installed in radar systems have served as the primary cooperative target identification techniques based on the "question and answer" interrogation loop of unidentified aircraft. However, the IFF system has a number of limitations that pose significant challenges in the positive identification of hostile and neutral aircrafts, which can lead to a catastrophic outcome of fratricide and the possible elimination of a friendly or commercial aircraft. To reduce the probability of fratricide and enhance the effectiveness and robustness of target identification, this research will examine the radar Non-Cooperative Target Recognition (NCTR) technique of using the bi-spectral signatures of backscattered radar signals. The basic idea is that the geometry of the target scatterers and their mutual interactions impose features in the reflected radar signal that are typical and unique to the target of interests. The bi-spectrum can be used to detect these multiple interactions features which then may be used to match against a reference database that contains signatures of different target types for {{recognition and}} identification...|$|R
40|$|Changes in {{military}} operations in recent years underscore changes in the requirements of military units. One of the largest underlying changes is the transformation from large-scale battles to quick-reaction mobile forces. There is also pressure {{to reduce the number}} of warfighters at risk in operations. One resultant need of these two factors is the increased need for situation awareness (SA); another is the use of unmanned vehicles, which increases the difficulty for the dismounted warfighter to maintain SA. An augmented reality (AR) system is a type of synthetic vision system that mixes computer-generated graphics (or annotations) with the real world. Annotations provide information aimed at establishing SA and aiding decision making. The AR system must decide what annotations to show and how to show them to ensure that the display is intuitive and unambiguous. We analyze the problem domain of {{military operations in}} urban terrain. Our goal is to determine the utility a synthetic vision system like AR can provide to a dismounted warfighter. In particular, we study the types of information that a warfighter is likely to find useful when working with teams of other warfighters. The problem domain is challenging because teammates may be occluded by urban infrastructure and may include unmanned vehicles operating in the environment. We consider the tasks of dynamic planning and deconfliction, navigation, target identification, and <b>identification</b> of <b>friend</b> <b>or</b> <b>foe.</b> We discuss the issues involved in developing a synthetic vision system, the usability goals that will measure how successful a system will be, and the use cases driving our development of a prototype system...|$|R

40|$|RFID (Radio Frequency Identification Technology), {{came into}} {{existence}} during the Second World War, when the military used this technology for IFF (<b>Identification</b> of <b>Friend</b> <b>or</b> <b>Foe)</b> purposes. In recent years RFID is used extensively. Wal-Mart the multinational retail enterprise have invested {{millions of dollars to}} replace their bar code system with RFID technology. The main advantage of using an RFID system is that it is simple, inexpensive, maintenance free, flexible and portable. The entire system consists of a reader, tag, IC, antennas and a controller. There can be numerous readers present in a particular area, and these readers network via a controller. However, it is vital to test the RFID system to ensure it performs optimally. The tags can be placed virtually on any material, but it is necessary to analyze how the tag will perform on the different materials under various environmental conditions. It should be possible for the tag to provide accurate results with changing environmental conditions, for instance, in the presence of moisture. Sensor tags provide a solution to this problem. Sensor tag is a type of RFID tag which can sense moisture, temperature or pressure levels and adjust the readings accordingly. Sensor code and RSSI code values are important factors determining the performance of the sensor tag. This thesis mainly focuses on the analysis of the performance of a sensor tag known as sensor dogbone tag on different materials under different environmental conditions using a reader (NordicID), which is specifically used to read sensor tags. A comparative study is made on the above conditions to determine the most suited position for the tag to be placed, in order to obtain results. The tag is placed on reference materials at constant read range and measurements are taken using a NordicID reader under various instances like, sunny outdoors, presence of moisture, embedded inside materials, enclosed inside a cardboard box etc. This thesis also offers an introduction to the RFID technology, its components and the communication of the RFID network...|$|R
5000|$|In 1985, {{inventor}} Harry Wainwright {{created the}} first fully animated sweatshirt. The shirt consisted of fiber optics, leads, and a microprocessor to control individual frames of animation. The result was a full color cartoon displayed {{on the surface of}} the shirt. in 1995, Wainwright went on to invent the first machine enabling fiber optics to be machined into fabrics, the process needed for manufacturing enough for mass markets and, in 1997, hired a German machine designer, Herbert Selbach, from Selbach Machinery to produce the world's first CNC machine able to automatically implant fiber optics into any flexible material. Receiving the first of a dozen patents based on LED/Optic displays and machinery in 1989, the first CNC machines went into production in 1998 beginning with the production of animated coats for Disney Parks in 1998. The first ECG bio-physical display jackets employing LED/optic displays were created by Wainwright and David Bychkov, the CEO of Exmovere at the time in 2005 using GSR sensors in a watch connected via Bluetooth to the embedded machine washable display in a denim jacket and were demonstrated at the Smart Fabrics Conference held in Washington, D.C. May 7, 2007. Additional smart fabric technologies were unveiled by Wainwright at two Flextech Flexible Display conferences held in Phoenix, AZ, showing infrared digital displays machine-embedded into fabrics for IFF (<b>Identification</b> of <b>Friend</b> <b>or</b> <b>Foe)</b> which were submitted to BAE Systems for evaluation in 2006 and won an [...] "Honorable Mention" [...] award from NASA in 2010 on their Tech Briefs, [...] "Design the Future" [...] contest.
