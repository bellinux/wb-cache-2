40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to {{investigate}} intrinsic motivation factors across multinational organisations located in Ireland. The thesis explored the extent to which intrinsic motivation factors such as autonomy, mastery and purpose affect multicultural workforces. The research addressed employees in Ireland motivated by intrinsic incentives. The examination concentrated on autonomy as the ability to freely choose the task, technique, team and the time related to completing the work. Mastery represents another element of staff’s <b>inside</b> drives, <b>dealing</b> with the need to become increasingly better at completing jobs. Purpose, meanwhile, is the final important intrinsic factor, and relates to doing meaningful work that can be beneficial to others. To gather the data, a quantitative method, in the form of an online survey was used, with 200 respondents providing reliable replies. The research compared two groups of employees, Irish and non-Irish, to understand what motivates them and to what extent the incentives are different based on nationality. The findings have been summarised and presented using the SPSS program. The findings proved that intrinsic motivation is important for employees. However, Irish workers are more intrinsically motivated than non-Irish. All three: autonomy, mastery and purpose, are highly necessary for staff, regardless of nationality. The research disagreed with the assertion that autonomy is an element of inside incentive, as no correlation was indicated between it and intrinsic motivation. Mastery and purpose can be named as the factors affecting intrinsic incentives, as a significant correlation was found between them. Moreover, non-Irish staff were found to place more value in development and the ability to learn at work than Irish personnel. Finally, the level of intrinsic motivation depends strongly on salary satisfaction. The thesis has been built on a broad literature review and primary research. The findings can be used by company owners, HR representatives and managers to understand what factors currently motivate employees, and help them to create reliable, successful and effective motivational programmes based on fulfilling their inside desires...|$|R

40|$|Constraint integer {{programming}} (CIP) {{is a novel}} paradigm which integrates constraint programming (CP), mixed {{integer programming}} (MIP), and satisfiability (SAT) modeling and solving techniques. In this paper we discuss the software framework and solver SCIP (Solving Constraint Integer Programs), which is free for academic and non-commercial use and can be downloaded in source code. This paper gives {{an overview of the}} main design concepts of SCIP and how {{it can be used to}} solve constraint integer programs. To illustrate the performance and flexibility of SCIP, we apply it to two different problem classes. First, we consider mixed integer programming and show by computational experiments that SCIP is almost competitive to specialized commercial MIP solvers, even though SCIP supports the more general constraint integer programming paradigm. We develop new ingredients that improve current MIP solving technology. As a second application, we employ SCIP to solve chip design verification problems as they arise in the logic design of integrated circuits. This application goes far beyond traditional MIP solving, as it includes several highly non-linear constraints, which can be handled nicely within the constraint integer programming framework. We show anecdotally how the different solving techniques from MIP, CP, and SAT work together <b>inside</b> SCIP to <b>deal</b> with such constraint classes. Finally, experimental results show that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques for proving the validity of properties on circuits containing arithmetic...|$|R
