25|$|This 200 MW {{station has}} three <b>hydraulic</b> <b>turbine</b> {{generator}} units, causes {{less than one}} half square kilometre of new flooding, and has only a small reservoir. This project had the most extensive environmental review of any generating project in Manitoba. Participation of the Nisichawayasihk Cree Nation (NCN) First Nation was passed by a June 2006 referendum by NCN members. This partnership between NCN and Manitoba Hydro will allow advancement of the in-service date to 2012 and opportunities for additional export revenue. Otherwise the domestic load growth would not require this new capacity until several years later.|$|E

40|$|The {{energy market}} imposes new {{requirements}} in <b>hydraulic</b> <b>turbines</b> operation. Usually, the old <b>hydraulic</b> <b>turbines</b> are {{not designed to}} meet these new requirements. Therefore, the refurbished solutions for <b>hydraulic</b> <b>turbines</b> {{are expected to be}} robust and flexible in operation in order to regulate the grid. A methodology is developed for a hydropower plant equipped with Francis turbines. Firstly, the solution available in the hydropower plant is examined. Secondly, two new solutions are designed for the hydraulic passage available in situ. Next, several scenarios from peak load operation to wide range operation are investigated in order to asses the performance of each technical solution. Consequently, the performances are compared proving the best solution for hydropower plant refurbishment...|$|R

2500|$|Also in {{the city}} {{outskirts}} is Hacienda Buena Vista, an estate built in 1833 originally to grow fruits. It was converted into a coffee plantation and gristmill in 1845. [...] It remained in operation until 1937, then fell into disrepair, but was restored by the government's Fideicomiso de Conservación de Puerto Rico. All the machinery works (the metal parts) are original, operated by water channeled from the 360m Vives waterfall; there is a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>turbine</b> which makes the corn mill work.|$|E
2500|$|The {{building}} of the now-historic Barker engine also came under son Carlos Vives tenancy: [...] "In 1847, with the demand for milled corn rising given the increase in sugar plantation slaves around Ponce, Carlos constructed another building for a new corn mill powered with a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>turbine</b> from the West Point Foundry, in Cold Spring, New York. The turbine was patented in the United States, in 1843, by James Whitelaw, of Scotland. The flour from Hacienda Buena Vista gained islandwide prominence due to its excellent quality. From 1847 to 1873, the corn flour of the hacienda reigned supreme over other local mills. Shortly afterwards, a corn mill to pulverize the corn was mounted, and the hacienda's white and yellow corn flour received the gold medal for excellence in the second public exposition celebrated in San Juan in June 1855." [...] In 1860, the hacienda won awards again at the Puerto Rico Exposition Fair.|$|E
