5|$|The merger {{led to a}} {{clash of}} two {{organisational}} cultures. While VAT had a flat organisation, open communication among its workforce and a spirit of togetherness, SAT's organisation was strictly hierarchical. The division of portfolios between Karis and Hämeenlinna was changed after the merger. Lorry production was gradually concentrated at Karis and Sisu-Hämeenlinna focused on producing mobile cranes, bus chassis, terminal tractors and military vehicles. Former VAT personnel had to increase production of the new portfolio and simultaneously adopt new processes, so <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>three</b> to four years before the Hämeenlinna factory could deliver results in line with its capacity.|$|E
5|$|Although the feigned flights did {{not break}} the lines, they {{probably}} thinned out the housecarls in the English shield wall. The housecarls were replaced {{with members of the}} fyrd, and the shield wall held. Archers appear to have been used again before and during an assault by the cavalry and infantry led by the duke. Although 12th-century sources state that the archers were ordered to shoot at a high angle to shoot over the front of the shield wall, there is no trace of such an action in the more contemporary accounts. It is not known how many assaults were launched against the English lines, but some sources record various actions by both Normans and Englishmen that took place during the afternoon's fighting. The Carmen claims that Duke William had two horses killed under him during the fighting, but William of Poitiers's account states that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>three.</b>|$|E
5|$|For the People's Republic of Poland, 1956 {{was a year}} of transition. The {{international}} situation significantly weakened the hard-line Stalinist faction in Poland; Polish communist leader Bolesław Bierut died in March; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>three</b> years since Stalin had died and his successor at the Soviet Union's helm, Nikita Khrushchev, denounced him in February. Protests by workers in June in Poznań had highlighted the people's dissatisfaction with their situation. In October, the events set in motion resulted in the rise in power of the reformers' faction, led by Władysław Gomułka. After brief, but tense, negotiations, the Soviets gave permission for Gomułka to stay in control and made several other concessions resulting in greater autonomy for the Polish government. For Polish citizens this meant a temporary liberalization. Eventually though, hopes for full liberalization were proven false, as Gomułka's regime became more oppressive. Nonetheless, the era of Stalinization in Poland had ended.|$|E

5|$|In April 634, Abu Bakr {{invaded the}} Byzantine Empire in the Levant and decisively {{defeated}} a Byzantine army at the Battle of Ajnadayn. The Muslim armies marched north and laid siege to Damascus. The city was taken after a monophysite bishop informed Khalid ibn al-Walid, the Muslim commander in chief, {{that it was}} possible to breach city walls by attacking a position only lightly defended at night. While Khalid entered the city by assault from the Eastern gate, Thomas, commander of the Byzantine garrison, negotiated a peaceful surrender at the Jabiyah gate with Abu Ubaidah, Khalid's second in command. After the surrender of the city, the commanders disputed the terms of the peace agreement. The commanders finally agreed that the peace terms given by Abu Ubaidah would be met. The peace terms included an assurance that no pursuit will be undertaken by Muslims against the departing Roman convoy for three days. Having acquiesced to the peace terms, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>three</b> days after the surrender of the city that Khalid set out after the Damascan refugees towards Antioch and defeated them in battle six days later, near present day Al Jayyad.|$|E
5|$|The All Blacks' first-half {{play was}} {{generally}} considered poor—with aimless kicking to Welsh fullback Winfield who returned much better kicks into touch. The first ten minutes saw New Zealand's Roberts break the line twice only, {{to be caught}} by Winfield without support. Eventually Wales had a scrum-feed 25 yards out from the All Blacks' try-line. From this Wales executed a planned move—Owen got the Wales scrum-ball and dummied on his right to Bush. He then turned left and passed to Cliff Pritchard. Pritchard then passed to Gabe, who passed to Bush, who eventually passed to Morgan. Morgan then raced 25 yards down the touchline, eluding Gillett, to score for Wales. Winfield missed the resulting conversion—leaving the score at 3–0. In {{the final stages of}} the first half the All Blacks began to assert themselves and were attacking strongly when half-time was sounded. Dixon claimed half-time was called two minutes early, and Wallace that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>three</b> minutes early.|$|E

Another three-year gap followed, before he made his first-class debut for Ireland, against London County in May 1902, in what was also Ireland's first first-class match. This was a rare period of consistent selection for Ireland, and he played three further first-class matches again that month, against the MCC, Oxford University and Cambridge University.|$|E

It was, at the time, the largest privately owned Elizabethan house in England. It contained 123 huge glass windows, in the days when glass was very expensive (indeed, a good show of wealth was how many windows you could afford in your house).

25|$|On October 29, 1901, outside Lexington, North Carolina, {{a freight}} train crashed into one unit of the train {{carrying}} Buffalo Bill's show from Charlotte, North Carolina, to Danville, Virginia. The freight train's engineer had thought that the entire show train had passed, not realizing <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>three</b> units, {{and returned to the}} tracks; 110 horses were killed in the crash or had to be killed later, including his personal mounts Old Pap and Old Eagle. No people were killed, but Annie Oakley's injuries were so severe that she was told she would never walk again. She did recover and continued performing later. The incident put the show out of business for a while, and this disruption may have led to its eventual demise.|$|E
25|$|During the war, HASAG had {{factories}} in eight German cities and three Polish ones. Most {{of the workers}} were either forced laborers, primarily from eastern Europe, or prisoners from concentration camps. The forced laborers lived under heavy police surveillance in barracks near the factories. In 1942 and 1943, such labor camps were set up near all six of the {{factories in}} Poland. Few workers were there voluntarily {{and most of those}} were Germans in managerial positions. At the beginning of 1942, HASAG had 13,850 employees. They began bringing in Polish forced laborers in spring 1944, and in 1945, had eight Außenkommandos, first from Ravensbrück concentration camp and then from Buchenwald, setting up a labor subcamp next to every HASAG factory in Germany. At Birkenau, the mortality rate for an Außenkommando was officially calculated. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>three</b> and a half months. There were 16,581 prisoners in these labor subcamps, including 10,557 women, both Jews and non-Jews and 4,025 Jewish men.

25|$|On 13 March, {{the first}} leg at Aggborough ended 51 to Stevenage. Borough took the lead half way into the first half when David Bridges latched onto a Michael Bostwick cross. Kidderminster {{equalised}} shortly after through defender Gavin Caines who drove the ball home {{from the edge of}} the area. However, it was not level for long, Mitchell Cole beat his full-back for pace and squared the ball to Yemi Odubade, who bundled the ball home. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>three</b> before the interval; Bridges scoring again, heading in a perfectly weighted Joel Byrom cross. Chris Beardsley scored a second half brace to ensure a four-goal cushion for the Hertfordshire side going into the second leg at Broadhall Way. His first came when he met an Andy Drury delivery; his initial effort cannoned off the crossbar, but he was on hand to head in the rebound. His second came when he dispossessed Martin Riley on the touchline, cut in and curled the ball into the corner of the net. The second leg took place a week later at Broadhall Way, which ended 00 - ultimately meaning Stevenage progressed to the final at Wembley Stadium after winning 51 on aggregate over the two legs.|$|E

25|$|A week later, at the {{beginning}} of March, Stevenage won their second away game on the bounce; beating Eastbourne Borough 60. Captain Mark Roberts gave Stevenage the lead just before the break, following a well-worked free-kick involving both Joel Byrom and Scott Laird. After the interval, Stevenage doubled their lead when David Bridges headed in Joel Byrom's cross. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>three</b> shortly after following a mistake from Eastbourne goalkeeper Danny Knowles, Chris Beardsley blocked the goalkeepers clearance and slid the ball into an empty net. It got worse for the home side ten minutes from time when Beardsley chased a long through ball and was hauled down by Darren Baker just inside the area - the defender being shown a straight red. Substitute Mitchell Cole slotted the penalty home, before adding another after good work from Eddie Odhiambo. Cole completed his hat-trick moments later slotting home Stacy Long's through ball. A third successive victory followed in a 20 win at home to Crawley Town. In a tight game, Stevenage took the lead just after the interval thanks to a rasping effort from Michael Bostwick after a well-worked corner. A second goal came deep into injury-time, Chris Beardsley countering and setting up Lee Boylan to slide the ball into the net. Three days later, Stevenage beat Barrow 40 to ensure a fourth consecutive win. In a tight first half, the home side took the lead through Yemi Odubade. Borough doubled their lead shortly before the interval; left-back Scott Laird firing the ball home. Odubade then scored his second after countering a Barrow corner, and subsequently completed his hat-trick late on with an effort drilled high into the net. Stevenage recorded their fifth straight win, beating Histon 10 at Broadhall Way. Jon Ashton scored the only goal of the game when he swept home Stacy Long's corner.|$|E
