Eventually this effective binding energy has become zero so that the highest occupied energy level, the Fermi energy, is equal to the rest mass of a nucleon. At this point adding a nucleon of the same isospin to the nucleus is not possible, as the new nucleon would have a negative effective binding energy — i.e. it is more energetically favourable (system will have lowest overall energy) for the nucleon to be created outside the nucleus.

The strong {{electric}} {{field at the}} surface of a strange star is discussed, and a self-consistent model is proposed to calculate its capability of supporting a “normal ” nuclear material crust.

40|$|The {{presented}} paper analyses how fog precipitation affects interception and throughfall in spruce mountain {{forests in}} the temperate zone of Europe. The plots selected for the collection of rainfall and throughfall were located within the area of nature reserve Babia hora, from which {{the data were collected}} from the year 2001 to 2005. The gauges were situated in four different locations (open space, crown's periphery, young stand and forest opening) at an elevation ranging from 1330 to 1350  m above sea level. The results indicate that in the examined region, the deposition of horizontal precipitation on vegetation surfaces occurs, which reduces the interception losses, and even causes the net gain of water. The positive effect of horizontal precipitation on water regime grows with the decreasing gross precipitation at open space, while this effect is evident for the precipitation in the form of rain, but not snow. The correlation coefficients between throughfall and rainfall fluctuated from 0. 69 to 0. 99 in the case of rainfall, and from 0. 424 to 0. 955 in the case of snowfall, which indicates strong correlation between throughfall and gross precipitation. High values of throughfall indices underneath crown's periphery suggest that under <b>drip</b> <b>points</b> we can expect the net gain of water, which has a positive effect on natural regeneration and understorey vegetation.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the boundary conditions used in the Wigner-Seitz (WS) approximation applied to the neutron star inner crust is examined. The generalized energy functional method which includes the neutron and proton pairing correlations is used. Predictions of {{two versions of the}} boundary conditions are compared with each other. The uncertainties in the equilibrium configuration (Z,R_c) of the crust, where Z is the proton charge and R_c, the radius of the WS cell, correspond to variation of Z by 2 - 6 units and of R_c, by 1 - 2 fm. The effect of the boundary conditions is enhanced at increasing density. These uncertainties are smaller than the variation of Z and R_c coming from the pairing effects. In the case of high densities, k_F greater than 1 1 /fm, the most important uncertainty occurs {{in the value of the}} neutron gap.

The {{partitioning}} of incident precipitation by a forest canopy into throughfall and stemflow varies as a function of meteorological conditions, tree species, leaf morphology and surface roughness, among other factors. Nanko et al (2016) examined the throughfall drop size signature of precipitation events relative to changes in leaf canopy state of deciduous forests. However, little work has been done to quantify the influence of meteorological variables (air temperature, wind speed, wind direction, rainfall intensity and duration) on drop size among discrete rain events. To quantify individual throughfall drops, a laser disdrometer gauge was deployed below an observed <b>drip</b> <b>point</b> under a Liriodendron tulipifera L. (yellow poplar) tree, in northeastern Maryland, USA. Using multiple correspondence analysis, lower air temperature (4. 0 - 12. 0 °C), low precipitation intensity (0. 1 - 1. 5 mm. 5 min- 1), and low wind speed (0. 1 - 1. 0 m. s- 1) were found to associate with periods of large throughfall drop production. Two canopy storage systems were identified, static and dynamic, with the static storage system being dominant during the foliated period and the dynamic during the unfoliated period.

For {{most of the}} record, the trace element ratios show small absolute variability but similar patterns, which are also consistent with stable isotope variations. Higher trace element-to-calcium values are interpreted as responses to decreasing moisture, inducing changes in the residence time of percolation, producing prior calcite precipitation and/or variations in the hydrological routing. Statistically meaningful levels of covariability were determined using anomalies of Mg/Ca, d 18 O and d 13 C. Combining these three time series into a single ‘palaeomoisture-trend’ parameter, we highlight several events of reduced moisture (ca. 8. 9 – 8. 4, 6. 2, 4. 2, 3. 1 and 2. 0 ka), a humid period between ca. 7. 9 and 8. 3 ka and other shorter-term wet events at ca. 5. 8, 5. 3 and 3. 7 ka.

The spray was applied until <b>drip</b> <b>point</b> three times during the experiment with 15 days intervals, after which the plants were harvested to quantify growth and shoot concentration of nitrogen (N), P, magnesium (Mg), sulphur (S) and manganese (Mn). The responses of sugarcane plants to foliar P spray at different levels of P supply in the rooting medium was not genotype-dependent. It was demonstrated for the averaged values across varieties, that foliar P application enhanced sugarcane performance under low P, as revealed by improvements of leaf area and dry matter production of shoot and root of PD plants. Under P limitation we also observed diminished shoot concentration of N, P, Mg, S and increased concentration of Mn. However, foliar P spray increased the concentrations of N, P, S and reduced shoot Mn. Furthermore, shoot P:N, P:Mg, P:S, P:Mn and Mg:Mn concentration ratios exhibited a positive relationship with shoot dry matter production. In conclusion, low P supply in the rooting medium impairs nutrient balance in shoot tissues of sugarcane at early growth; however, this effect was ameliorated by foliar P application which merits further study under field conditions...|$|E

40|$|Data for the {{volumetric}} {{mass transfer}} coefficient, kLa, and the effective area, of structured packings have rarely {{been reported in}} the literature. This is despite the ever-increasing importance of structured packings in industrial separation columns for absorption and distillation processes. This work verified that the CO 2 -NaOH reaction is suitable for the determination of effective mass transfer area. The kinetic parameter of this reaction which governs the absorption flux, was evaluated with a wetted wall column, which provides a known mass transfer area. Normally, this kinetic parameter is calculated with data obtained from other literature sources. Since there is a large disagreement, the value obtained with the wetted wall column was used in absorption columns packed with MELLAPAK for the determination of effective areas. The desorption of O 2 from demineralized water into air is suitable for the determination of kLa values. The measured desorption rates are actually related to the overall volumetric liquid side mass transfer coefficient, which in turn is very close to kLa since O 2 is sparingly soluble in water, even by comparison with CO 2. Therefore the gas side resistance is negligible. The effective area for mass transfer and the kLa of the SULZER packings MELLAPAK 125. Y, 250. Y and 500. Y were measured under industrial-scale operating conditions, with a broad range of gas and liquid flows, in a pilot plant with a column having an internal diameter of 295 mm and a packing height of 420 mm. The experimental procedure and apparatus employed in this work were checked by making additional measurements of effective area for 25 mm ceramic ring packing; these values were compared with literature data. The influence of the <b>drip</b> <b>point</b> density of the liquid distributor and of a higher packing height of MELLAPAK 125. Y were also studied. This contribution shows that the effective mass transfer area for MELLAPAK 125. Y, 250. Y and 500. Y can be higher than the defined geometric area of the packing. The ratio of the effective area to the geometric area is a function of a Reynolds number defined with the liquid characteristic velocity and packing hydraulic diameter. For MELLAPAK with relatively low specific geometric area in particular, the space between the sheets is sufficient to permit droplet formation and turbulence enhancement, both of which magnify effective area. Empirical correlations for the kLa of MELLAPAK 250. Y and 50 O. Y are proposed. The kLa values for MELLAPAK 250. Y and 500. Y are higher than for irregular packings with the same geometric area. The kLa for MELLAPAK 125. Y varies with the liquid and gas flowrates in a different way than that for MELLAPAK 250. Y, 500. Y and irregular packings. A model for predicting the liquid phase mass transfer coefficient, kL, for MELLAPAK 250. Y and 500. Y is proposed. In the development of this model, the experimental data from this work were considered together with the penetration theory. The value of kL increases with the liquid and gas flow and decreases with the geometric area of the packing. Higher kL values are associated with irregular packings with equal geometric area. Recommendations for improvements in the surface structure of MELLAPAK, enhancing liquid film renewal rate, as well as suggestions for future research projects end this thesis...|$|E
