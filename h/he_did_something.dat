5|$|Marko was {{associated}} with large, solitary boulders and indentations in rocks; the boulders {{were said to be}} thrown by him from a hill, and the indentations were his footprints (or the hoofprints of his horse). He was also connected with geographic features such as hills, glens, cliffs, caves, rivers, brooks and groves, which he created or at which <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>something</b> memorable. They were often named after him, and there are many toponyms—from Istria in the west to Bulgaria in the east—derived from his name. In Bulgarian and Macedonian stories, Marko had an equally strong sister who competed with him in throwing boulders.|$|E

25|$|Baker {{was born}} on Scotland Road in Liverpool. His parents were working class; his mother, Mary Jane (née Fleming), a cleaner, was a devout Catholic, and his father, John Stewart Baker, was a seaman. Baker {{attended}} Cheswardine Boarding School. At 15 he became a novice monk with the Roman Catholic Brothers of Ploermel in Jersey and later in Shropshire, but left the monastery six years later after losing his faith. As {{he wrote in his}} autobiography he realised he wanted to break each of the Ten Commandments in order and thought he should get out before <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>something</b> serious. He did his national service in the Royal Army Medical Corps, serving from 1955 until 1957. At the same time, he took up acting, studying at the Rose Bruford College of Speech and Drama, Sidcup in 1956 where he met his first wife. He {{went on to become a}} professional actor in the late 1960s after the marriage broke down.|$|E

25|$|On {{the death}} of the Conqueror in 1087 Lanfranc secured the {{succession}} for William Rufus, in spite of the discontent of the Anglo-Norman baronage; and in 1088 his exhortations induced the English militia to fight {{on the side of the}} new sovereign against Odo of Bayeux and the other partisans of Duke Robert. He exacted promises of just government from Rufus, and was not afraid to remonstrate when the promises were disregarded. So long as he lived he was a check upon the worst propensities of the king’s administration. But his restraining hand was too soon removed. In 1089 he was stricken with fever and he died on 24 May amidst universal lamentations. Notwithstanding some obvious moral and intellectual defects, he was the most eminent and the most disinterested of those who had co-operated with William I in riveting Norman rule upon the English Church and people. As a statesman <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>something</b> to uphold the traditional ideal of his office; as a primate he elevated the standards of clerical discipline and education. Conceived in the spirit of popes such as Pope Leo IX, his reforms led by a natural sequence to strained relations between Church and State; the equilibrium which he established was unstable, and depended too much upon his personal influence with the Conqueror.|$|E
25|$|In episode 4, Agnes urges Kat {{to return}} to Spain, and when Dermott learns of this, he confronts Agnes about taking him from his mother. In episode 5, Agnes tells Dermott to keep Kat away from the christening of Bernie Kelly's (Susan Ateh) baby, but Dermott says Kat has made him feel welcome and invited him to meet his {{brothers}} in Spain, so Agnes reveals that Dermott has a twin sister. Dermott confronts Kat over this, {{who said she was}} waiting for the right time and insists there is nothing else that Dermott does not know. In episode 6, Bernie, a local garda, asks Kat about the last time she saw Lance and Kat wonders if she suspects something happened, but Bernie denies this. Meanwhile, Kat is unaware that Alfie is having an operation on his brain tumour. Alfie asks Dermott to find Kat and bring her to the hospital, as it means they are unable to go back to Spain. Bernie works out that Dermott was involved in Lance's death, and sees him on the beach with Kat. Kat tells Dermott that Bernie was asking about him. He sees the garda arriving so takes Kat in a boat, saying they will try to find the whale that was recently seen off the coast. Bernie shouts at him to stop and calls the coastguard. Kat asks Dermott if <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>something</b> to Lance. Dermott then accidentally crashes the boat into a rock and Kat is thrown into the water and then cut by the propellor. Dermott gets Kat out of the sea but there is nobody around to help. Meanwhile, Alfie has his operation but loses his pulse and the medical staff start to resuscitate.|$|E

[...] Five hours out of Japan, the airmen in Number 2 were over Kamchatka when they were met by three Bell P-63 Kingcobra fighters wearing the red star insignia of the Soviet Air Force. The Soviet fighter pilots inspected the unarmed B-29 at close range and then performed aerobatic maneuvers for the Americans. The three dipped their wings in salute and left the Superfortress to continue its journey. After Kamchatka, LeMay and Blanchard replaced Kingsbury and Potts at the controls.|$|E

500|$|On October 4, 2010, {{the release}} date was {{announced}} as November 22, 2010. Prior to its release, West initiated the free music program GOOD Fridays through his website on August 20, 2010, offering a free download of previously unreleased songs each Friday of the week, {{a portion of}} which were included on the album. Titled after his imprint label GOOD Music, the program generated considerable publicity {{in the months leading}} up to the album's release. Online marketing coordinator Karen Civil said of the program in retrospect, [...] "It's a genius idea. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>something</b> no one had ever done before, and at a point when he was the most hated person in music, he brought excitement back with his Friday releases". G.O.O.D. Fridays was originally intended to continue through December, but was extended by West through January 2011. My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was released as a digital download on Amazon.com at a list price of $3.99, which coincided with the site's $3 discount promotional offer on MP3 purchases made valid through the release week.|$|E
500|$|The {{music of}} Lightning Returns was {{composed}} by Masashi Hamauzu, who composed {{the music for}} Final Fantasy XIII, Naoshi Mizuta and Mitsuto Suzuki, who co-composed the music for Final Fantasy XIII-2 with Hamauzu. Japanese band Language was also contracted by Suzuki to help with recording and remixing. Several of the musicians in Japan had worked with the composers before on XIII-2 and The 3rd Birthday. Recording {{took place at the}} Mixer's Lab recording studios in Tokyo. The Video Game Orchestra, founded by Shota Nakama, was contracted by Hamauzu to perform, record and mix the orchestral music at their studio on Boston. According to Hamauzu, they were his first and only choice for recording the score. Nakama received the final score in April 2013, and Hamauzu was regularly at the studios to help with the recording process. Nakama was told by Hamauzu that he was allowed to do as he wished unless <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>something</b> [...] "really wacky", with Hamauzu relying on Nakama and mostly interacting and working on their tracks if he disliked some aspect of them. The orchestra worked on nearly all of Hamauzu's music, including the opening and ending themes.|$|E

2500|$|Agha Mohammad Shah did not {{construct}} or repair much {{during his}} reign, {{due to the}} campaigns and battles which occupied his time. In Tehran, he ordered {{the creation of a}} mosque named the Masjid-e Shah (meaning [...] "the Shah's mosque"), while in Mashhad he ordered the reparation of the Imam Reza shrine. In Astarabad, he repaired (or fortified) the walls, emptied the ditch, built several buildings, one of them being a palace for the governor. Furthermore, he also improved the overall condition of the city. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>something</b> similar in Babol, Ashraf and Sari. Of all these constructions and reparations, his best and most lasting achievement is debatably making Tehran his capital, which till this day is the country's capital and largest city.|$|E

2500|$|On another occasion, when Cao Pi {{was out on}} {{a hunting}} excursion, the fences built to trap the deer in an {{enclosed}} area were not properly secured so the deer broke through the fences and escaped.

2500|$|From London, Wild had {{obtained}} an assistant research officer {{job with the}} Council for Scientific and Industrial Research at the Radiophysics Laboratory near Sydney. He described the position as [...] "a humble one": to maintain and develop test equipment.

The only two really powerful groups in radio astronomy were the Australian one and Cambridge; and... we all thought we had the edge over the Cambridge group. [...] Joe Pawsey {{was the sort of}} father of radio astronomy in Australia.

2500|$|It is at {{this point}} that Wilson's own {{memories}} end, but the Scarecrow Guide informs him that all Dreamscapes are connected, and {{he will be able to}} uncover the truth of Amelia's disappearance if he continues searching. He begins by going back to the barn and discovering Amelia's necklace. It is also while he is here that he remembers a conversation he had with Amelia the day before the wedding, where she expressed concern for Frank after he called her and told her to cancel the wedding. As a result of this, she told Wilson she didn't want him at the wedding in case <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>something</b> stupid. Wilson recalls a telephone conversation he overheard Frank having one day at the airfield, and realizes that this conversation was the one Amelia was referring to. He remembers that Frank told her to meet him at their special spot so they can talk. This special spot is the lake, which is the location where Amelia and Frank had their one and only date many years prior. After he discovered that Amelia intended to follow through and marry Wilson, he drowned her in a fit of anger, telling her that [...] "If I can't have you, no one can." ...|$|E
