5|$|Aposematic species do {{not need}} to hide or stay still as cryptic organisms do, so aposematic {{individuals}} benefit from more freedom in exposed areas and can spend more time foraging, allowing them to <b>find</b> <b>more</b> and better quality food.

5|$|Although {{the size}} of noble {{households}} shrank slightly during the 16th century, the number of guests at the largest castle events continued to grow. 2,000 came to a feast at Cawood Castle in 1466, while the Duke of Buckingham routinely entertained up to 519 people at Thornbury Castle {{at the start of}} the 16th century. When Elizabeth I visited Kenilworth in 1575 she brought an entourage of 31 barons and 400 staff for a visit that lasted an exceptional 19 days; Leicester, the castle's owner, entertained the Queen and much of the neighbouring region with pageants, fireworks, bear baiting, mystery plays, hunting and lavish banquets. With this scale of living and entertainment the need to <b>find</b> <b>more</b> space in older castles became a major issue in both England and Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{television}} series Smallville, the character of Chloe Sullivan appeared in her own web-based spin-off series, titled Smallville: Chloe Chronicles. Allison Mack continued her duties as the investigative, high school reporter, with the series originally airing exclusively on AOL.com. The first volume aired between April 29, 2003 and May 20, 2003. The web series eventually {{made its way to}} Britain's Channel 4 website. Smallville: Chloe Chronicles was created by Mark Warshaw, with the scripts written by Brice Tidwell; Allison Mack was given final script approval.

5|$|Bushnell and Gene Lipkin, Atari's {{vice-president}} of sales, approached toy and electronic retailers to sell Home Pong, but were rejected. Retailers felt {{the product was}} too expensive and would not interest consumers. Atari contacted the Sears Sporting Goods department after noticing a Magnavox Odyssey advertisement in the sporting goods section of its catalog. Atari staff discussed {{the game with a}} representative, Tom Quinn, who expressed enthusiasm and offered the company an exclusive deal. Believing they could <b>find</b> <b>more</b> favorable terms elsewhere, Atari's executives declined and continued to pursue toy retailers. In January 1975, Atari staff set up a Home Pong booth at a toy trade fair in New York City, but was unsuccessful in soliciting orders {{due to the fact that}} they did not know that they needed a private showing.|$|E
5|$|Enraged by this, and by {{accusations of}} fraudulently passing off foreign moths as British, Cribb gave up {{collecting}} {{and left the}} rest of the specimens with his landlady as security for a debt. Here the stories from Manchester University and The Australian Museum, Victoria differ as to whether it was Cribb's pub landlady or the landlady of his lodgings, but either way the result was the same. The debt was not paid on time and when Cribb went back for the moths, which he had already sold to another collector, his landlady had burnt them. Subsequent efforts by other collectors to <b>find</b> <b>more</b> of the moths were unsuccessful, and the three specimens left in existence are thought to be the only representatives of an extinct species.|$|E
5|$|Having become {{versed in}} Kuba {{language}} and culture, Sheppard took {{a team of}} men {{to the edge of}} Kuba territory in 1892. His original plan was to ask for directions to the next village under the guise of purchasing supplies, but the chief of the village only allowed one of his men to go. Sheppard used a variety of tricks to make his way further into the kingdom, including having a scout follow a group of traders and, most famously, eating so many eggs that the townspeople could no longer supply him and his scout was able {{to gain access to the}} next village to <b>find</b> <b>more</b> eggs. Eventually, however, he encountered villagers that would allow him to go no further. While Sheppard was formulating a plan, the king's son, Prince N'toinzide, arrived and arrested Sheppard and his men for trespassing.|$|E

5|$|John {{had spent}} the {{conflict}} travelling alongside his father, and was given widespread possessions across the Angevin empire {{as part of the}} Montlouis settlement; from then onwards, most observers regarded John as Henry II's favourite child, although he was the furthest removed in terms of the royal succession. Henry II began to <b>find</b> <b>more</b> lands for John, mostly at various nobles' expense. In 1175 he appropriated the estates of the late Earl of Cornwall and gave them to John. The following year, Henry disinherited the sisters of Isabelle of Gloucester, contrary to legal custom, and betrothed John to the now extremely wealthy Isabelle. In 1177, at the Council of Oxford, Henry dismissed William FitzAldelm as the Lord of Ireland and replaced him with the ten-year-old John.|$|E
