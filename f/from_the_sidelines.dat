5|$|McCabe {{spent most}} of the 193435 Australian season {{watching}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidelines.</b> The first match of the summer was a testimonial for retiring Australian captain Woodfull. McCabe was forced to retire hurt when on five, and he missed more than two months of cricket. He returned for only one match, scoring 92 and 53 as New South Wales were defeated by arch-rivals Victoria.|$|E
5|$|A second {{experimental}} {{course was}} held at Philmont in New Mexico beginning on June 17, 1967. Bob Perin was Scoutmaster, Louis Adin of the Circle Ten Council in Dallas was senior patrol leader, and John Larson was assistant senior patrol leader.

5|$|Healthy {{throughout}} the 1991–92 season, Mullen rebounded offensively to score 42 goals and 87 points in 77 games. Midway through the season, {{he became the}} first player in Penguins' history to have consecutive four-goal games, doing so against the New York Islanders on December 23, 1991, and the Toronto Maple Leafs three days later. He appeared in only nine playoff games, however, as he suffered a knee injury that required surgery to repair in the second game of Pittsburgh's second-round series against the New York Rangers. Mullen watched <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidelines</b> as the Penguins repeated as Stanley Cup champions.|$|E
5|$|Karthik then {{played in}} the First Test at Chittagong after Dhoni was forced to {{withdraw}} due to injury. He made a duck in the first innings as India stumbled to 243 on the first day. He then made 27, falling in pursuit of quick runs for a declaration after India recovered in the second innings. India {{went on to win}} the match, and Karthik watched the next match <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidelines</b> after Dhoni recovered and steered India to a clean sweep.|$|E
5|$|Several radio {{stations}} {{were set to}} broadcast the game, including Ball State student radio WCRD, which featured Tyler Bradfield doing play-by-play and Sean Stewart as the analyst, and Ball State's flagship radio station WLBC-FM, which featured a four-person crew – Joel Gedett (play-by-play), Mark O'Connell (analyst), Luke Martin (sidelines), and Jeff Weiler (host).

5|$|Kartik {{was called}} into the Test squad to tour New Zealand in late 2002 after Kumble withdrew, but in the warm-up match he bowled one only over, {{in which he was}} {{hammered}} for 23 runs. He then watched <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidelines</b> as India only fielded one spin bowler—Harbhajan—in the Tests, held on green, pace-friendly surfaces. Kartik returned to India and was ineffective in the zonal one-dayers, taking a total of 1/148 from 24 overs in three matches, conceding more than a run a ball. Combined with his results against the West Indies, the poor returns saw him left out of the 2003 Cricket World Cup squad, with Harbhajan and Kumble preferred.|$|E
5|$|Louisville's {{second drive}} {{of the game}} was much quicker than the Cardinals' first. After {{beginning}} at their own 20-yard line, it took the Cardinals just seven plays to travel 80yards and earn a touchdown. Louisville was helped throughout the drive by repeated Virginia Tech personal foul penalties. Tech players committed three separate 15-yard personal fouls during the drive, one of which came after Louisville's successful extra point kick when cornerback Jimmy Williams bumped a game official. Williams was ejected from the game for the contact and {{was removed from the}} field after watching the next series <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidelines.</b> The touchdown and extra point extended Louisville's first-quarter lead to 14–3.|$|E
5|$|Up to this point, Brown {{had scored}} 800 runs on tour {{at an average}} of 72.72, while Loxton had made 310 runs at 51.66. Harvey had scored only 296 runs at 42.29. The other five places in the top six were firmly entrenched in the hands of Barnes, Morris, Bradman, Hassett and Miller, who had all played in those {{positions}} regularly since the end of World War II. Brown gained selection out of position in the middle order in the First Test at Trent Bridge, while Loxton and Harvey watched <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidelines.</b> There was a chance one of them would receive a last-minute call-up as Barnes was ill with food poisoning in the week leading up to the Test, but the opener recovered. Brown made only 17 as Australia won by eight wickets.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 2008–09 season, Ebsary gained {{selection}} to the Australian national team and made her One Day International (ODI) debut in the home series against India. She made 37 runs at 18.50, and after scoring 207 runs in the WNCL season, was retained in the national team. After making her ODI top-score of 86 in the Rose Bowl series against New Zealand, she was selected for the 2009 World Cup, but {{was in and out of}} the team, making 106 runs at 35.33. In June 2009, she played in all of Australia's matches at the 2009 World Twenty20 and made her Test debut against England in a bilateral series after the World Twenty20. Ebsary scored 211 runs during the 2009–10 WNCL season to retain her position in the national squad for the Rose Bowl series, but after a series of poor performances, she spent the latter half of the campaign watching <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidelines.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the Australian season, Poulton was {{selected}} for the ODI team the ICC Women's Quadrangular Series in Chennai, India. In addition to the hosts and Australia, New Zealand and England were also participating, and each team played each other twice in the round-robin phase. Poulton scored only 8 and 0 from 21 and 8 balls respectively as Australia lost their first two matches against New Zealand and India respectively. She was then dropped for the next two games. She was recalled for the penultimate round-robin match against England but did not bat in a six-wicket win, and then made 27 as Australia defeated India by four wickets in the last match. The Australians needed 231 for victory—4.62 runs per over—and Poulton got their innings off to a slow start, taking 75 balls to accumulate her runs, scoring at {{less than half of the}} required rate. However, her teammates sped up and reached the target from the last ball of the match to qualify for the final against New Zealand. Australia won by six wickets with the dropped Poulton watching <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidelines.</b> She ended the series with 35 runs at 11.66 with a strike rate of only 33.65, was then overlooked for the Rose Bowl series against New Zealand held in Darwin in July.|$|E
5|$|Kartik {{started the}} 2004–05 season by scoring 56 and 16 and taking 2/42 and 2/49 as the Rest of India {{defeated}} Mumbai in the Irani Trophy, {{but it was}} not enough to prevent Harbhajan from resuming his position in the team for the home Test series against Australia. He got an opportunity in the Third Test in Nagpur, when Harbhajan was ill, taking 3/57 and 2/74 as India were 342 runs to lose their first home series to Australia since 1969–70. Kartik held his place when Harbhajan returned for the final Test in Mumbai as India fielded three spinners, and took 4/44 and 3/32 in a man of the match performance which saw India win by 13 runs. Both of these performances occurred under the captaincy of Rahul Dravid with Ganguly injured, in which Kartik netted his wickets at an average of 17.50 compared to 51.08 under Ganguly's leadership. Kartik played the last of his eight Tests in a subsequent opening match against South Africa in Kanpur, taking a total of 2/93 under Ganguly's command, being dropped after India chose to only use two spinners in subsequent matches. Kartik spent the next month watching <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidelines</b> as the reserve slow bowler, as only Kumble and Harbhajan played during the tour of Bangladesh. During this campaign, he was allowed to play in the second ODI, taking 2/43 as India lost to Bangladesh for the first time. Kartik returned to India and took seven wickets at 35.42 at an economy rate of 4.69 in the zonal one-dayers and Challenger Trophy, and then played four first-class matches to end the season, taking 10 wickets at 19.10. At the end of the season, he took 2/54 in a home ODI against Pakistan, who scored 7/319 to overhaul the target.|$|E
