5|$|A weak trough {{existed in}} the eastern Gulf of Mexico on September29. A {{circulation}} developed within the storm, becoming a tropical depression on October1. Later that day, the system intensified into Tropical Storm How. Initially, the tropical storm moved west-northwestward and its sustained winds peaked by October2, estimated at 45mph (75km/h). Officials advised small boats to remain at port along the Louisiana coast due to the storm. On October3, Tropical Storm How turned toward the southwest as it began weakening, {{and the next day}} it moved ashore near La Pesca, Tamaulipas as a tropical depression. About six hours after making landfall, How dissipated over the Sierra Madre Oriental in northeastern Mexico. <b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> only named storm in the season not to attain hurricane status.|$|E
5|$|The 1951 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was the first}} {{hurricane season}} in which tropical cyclones were officially named by the United States Weather Bureau. The season officially started on June15, when the United States Weather Bureau began its daily monitoring for tropical cyclone activity; the season officially ended on November15. It was the first year since 1937 in which no hurricanes made landfall on the United States; as Hurricane <b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> only tropical storm to hit the nation, the season had the least tropical cyclone damage in the United States since the 1939 season. As in the 1950 season, names from the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet were used to name storms this season.|$|E

It was the eighth storm of the season, forming on September 28 in the northwest Caribbean and, after entering the Gulf of Mexico, turned eastward and became a tropical storm. The storm brought heavy rainfall to Florida, causing flooding and $2million in damage. Tropical Storm How later became a hurricane, passing near the Outer Banks of North Carolina where it produced strong winds and high tides. A ship called the [...] "Southern Isles" [...] capsized off Cape Hatteras, killing 17 out of the crew of 23. Rains and high tides occurred in southeastern New England, before the hurricane moved out to sea and became extratropical.|$|E

This textbook also explicates how the research included was selected (e.g. controlled study looking at two different approaches, appearing in a peer reviewed journal, sufficient power to find significant differences if they occurred) and how each study was checked for validity (<b>how</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> outcome measured?) and reliability (did the research do what they said they did?), etc. to create a Cumulative Evidence Score weighted by the quality of the study (and not by the outcome) such that better studies with [...] "stronger designs" [...] and better methodological quality ratings carry more weight than weaker studies. The results lead to a rank ordering of the 48 treatment modalities included and provide a basis for selecting supportable treatment approaches beyond anecdotes, traditions and lore.|$|E
