5|$|Si Tjonat was {{directed}} by Nelson Wong, who produced the film in conjunction with his business partner Jo Eng Sek. The two had established Batavia Motion Picture in 1929. Wong had previously directed a single fiction film, the commercial flop Lily van Java (1928), with funding from a high-ranking General Motors <b>employee</b> <b>in</b> Batavia named David Wong. Jo Eng Sek, a shop owner, had never produced a film.|$|E
5|$|This {{activism}} was not {{compatible with}} his professional career, {{as he was}} a municipal <b>employee.</b> <b>In</b> this situation, Hol chose to formally leave the radical organizations, resigning {{as a member of}} the board of Kristiania Arbeidersamfund and Kristiania Folkevæbningssamlag. He thereby retained his job. However, in early 1884 he was fired by the municipality.|$|E
5|$|Nelson Wong, who had {{formerly}} been booked {{with his}} brothers Joshua and Othniel to record a film for Tio Tek Djien, approached David Wong (no relation), a high-ranking General Motors <b>employee</b> <b>in</b> Batavia, for funding.

5|$|The Brazilian {{system was}} {{relatively}} democratic {{for a period}} during which indirect elections were common in democracies. The income requirement was much higher in the United Kingdom, even after the reforms of 1832. At the time the only nations not requiring a minimum level of income as a qualification for voting were France and Switzerland where universal suffrage was introduced only in 1848. It is probable that no European country at the time had such liberal legislation as Brazil. The income requirement was low enough that any employed male citizen could qualify to vote. As an illustration, the lowest paid civil <b>employee</b> <b>in</b> 1876 was a janitor who earned Rs600$000 annually.|$|E

5|$|Initially, screenwriter Dan Sterling {{wrote his}} script {{based on a}} fake {{dictator}} from a fake country, but Rogen, Goldberg, and Sony executives asked him to rewrite the script focusing on Kim. The screenplay was then titled Kill Kim Jong Un. Previous iterations of the story revolved around Kim Jong-il, but put the project on hold until Jong-il died and his son Kim Jong-un assumed power in 2011. Development resumed when Rogen and Goldberg realized that Jong-un is closer to their own age, which they felt would be more humorous. To write the story, co-written with Daily Show writer Dan Sterling, they researched meticulously by reading non-fiction books and watching video footage about North Korea. The script was later reviewed by an <b>employee</b> <b>in</b> the State Department. Rogen and Goldberg aimed to make the project more relevant and satirical than their previous films while retaining toilet humor. They were pleased when former NBA star Dennis Rodman visited North Korea, as it reinforced their belief that {{the premise of the}} film was realistic.|$|E

30|$|<b>Employees</b> <b>in</b> {{personal}} service occupations, sales {{and customer service}} occupations and elementary occupations tend {{to be found in}} the lower earning quintiles. Together, in 2009, these three occupational groups accounted for 61  % of all <b>employees</b> <b>in</b> the lowest quintiles and 50  % of <b>employees</b> <b>in</b> the second lowest quintile. The average situation of <b>employees</b> <b>in</b> personal and occupation services 19 barely changed between 2006 and 2009, with a probability of 91.5  % of being employed by the end of the period in 2006 and of 91  % <b>in</b> 2009. For <b>employees</b> <b>in</b> sales and elementary occupations, their low performance in 2006 mainly reflected their concentration in the two lowest quintiles, where average employment rates are also lower. In 2009, sales and elementary occupation <b>employees</b> <b>in</b> the middle quintile had a 7  % higher probability than the average to be employed by the end of the period. The relative situation of <b>employees</b> <b>in</b> these occupations at the very top, however, worsened significantly, although this concerns fewer employees. This trend suggests a reverse pattern than that found for professional and associated professionals, who are clustered at the top of the distribution. <b>Employees</b> <b>in</b> these occupations were relatively more penalised in top quintiles at the onset of the crisis.|$|R

5|$|Karmal {{was born}} in Kamari, a village close to Kabul. He {{attended}} Nejat High School, a German-speaking school, and graduated from it in 1948, and applied to enter the Faculty of Law and Political Science of Kabul University. Karmal's application was turned down because of his student union activities. He studied at the College of Law and Political Science at Kabul University from 1951 to 1953. In 1953 Karmal was arrested because of his student union activities, but was released three years later in 1956 in an amnesty by Muhammad Daoud Khan. Shortly after, in 1957, Karmal found work as an English and German translator, before quitting and leaving for military training. Karmal graduated from the College of Law and Political Science in 1960, and in 1961, he found work as an <b>employee</b> <b>in</b> the Compilation and Translation Department of the Ministry of Education. From 1961 to 1963 {{he worked in the}} Ministry of Planning. When his mother died, Karmal left with his maternal aunt to live somewhere else. His father disowned him because of his leftist views.

5|$|Salesforce Marketing Cloud {{was founded}} {{under the name}} ExactTarget in late 2000 by Scott Dorsey, Chris Baggott, and Peter McCormick with $200,000 in financing. Joanna Milliken joined ExactTarget as the first <b>employee</b> <b>in</b> 2001. It raised $10.5 million in funding from Insight Venture Partners in 2004. The firm grew from $11.5 million in its second year of {{operations}} to $41.1 million in 2006, which was its first profitable year. In December 2007, ExactTarget filed an intent for {{an initial public offering}} with the Securities Exchange Commission, but withdrew its filing in May 2009. Instead, it announced $70 million in venture funding had been raised for international expansion, which was followed by another $75 million round later that year. An office was established in London with the acquisition of a UK-based ExactTarget reseller, Keymail Marketing, in September 2009. The company also hired 200 additional employees. In 2010, ExactTarget acquired CoTweet, a company founded in 2008 that develops and markets software for managing multiple Twitter accounts.|$|E
5|$|The 1938 Anschluss—the {{annexation}} of Austria into Greater Germany by the Nazi regime—led to the Nazification of Viennese publishing house Universal Edition. Boosey & Hawkes {{seized the opportunity}} to sign up composers Béla Bartók and Zoltán Kodály, and also rescued Universal's Jewish staff, who later {{played an important role in}} developing the company. One such <b>employee</b> <b>in</b> particular, Ernst Roth, facilitated the signing of Richard Strauss and Igor Stravinsky, and was instrumental in the production of Strauss's Vier letzte Lieder (Four Last Songs) (1948; premièred 1950) and Stravinsky's The Rake's Progress (premièred 1951). Another significant figure from Vienna who occupied an editorial role was composer Arnold Schoenberg's pupil Erwin Stein, and after the war the composer Leopold Spinner, a pupil of Anton Webern, was also on the editorial staff. Stein was instrumental in founding the modern-music journal Tempo in 1939, which began as Boosey & Hawkes' own newsletter but later became a more independent publication.|$|E
40|$|This study {{explores the}} level of {{alienation}} among Russian <b>employees</b> <b>in</b> state-owned and private business organizations {{over a period of}} 2 years. Based on the employment situation <b>in</b> Russia, <b>employees</b> <b>in</b> private companies were expected to be more alienated from their work than <b>employees</b> <b>in</b> state-owned companies. Survey data have been collected from 725 <b>employees</b> <b>in</b> five state-owned and three private Russian companies in 1994 and 1995. The results indicate that <b>employees</b> <b>in</b> private companies are more alienated than their counterparts in state-owned companies. Moreover, while {{the level of}} personal alienation has not changed over the 2 -year period, social alienation has become more prevalent. It is concluded that as opposed to social alienation, which tends to change with a transition in the political and economic systems, Western style personal alienation is a steady measure of individual's attitude towards life that hardly changes in reaction to environmental changes. Logistic Regression analysis revealed Self-Estrangement to be more prevalent among <b>employees</b> <b>in</b> private companies than among <b>employees</b> <b>in</b> state-owned companies.

5|$|Upon {{leaving the}} country, Emperor Pedro I {{selected}} three {{people to take}} charge of his children. The first was his friend José Bonifácio, whom he nominated as guardian, a position which was later confirmed by the National Assembly. The second was Mariana de Verna, who had occupied the position of aia (supervisor) from the birth of Pedro II. The third person was Rafael, an afro-Brazilian veteran of the Cisplatine War. Rafael was an <b>employee</b> <b>in</b> the Palace of São Cristóvão whom Pedro I deeply trusted and asked to look after his son—a charge which he carried out during the rest of his life. São Cristóvão was Pedro II's primary residence from infancy. At the end of 1832 Princess Paula became severely ill (likely with meningitis) and died three weeks later on 16 January 1833. Her loss reinforced the sense of abandonment already felt by Pedro II and his remaining two sisters.|$|E
5|$|The post {{system was}} the {{cornerstone}} of Abir's commercial activity. Each post was run by one or two European agents to oversee local operations. The salary for an agent was 1,800 fr per year, sometimes increasing to 2,100 fr in the second year, and the standard contract period was three years. Agents also received 60 fr of trade goods each month with which to buy their food. Despite the low wages the 2% commission that each agent received on rubber production made {{up the majority of}} the agents' pay, for example the agent at Bongandanga received 16,800 fr in commission in 1903. As a result, there were many applicants for each post and agents were hired with the expectation that they would increase production by 0.5–3 tons per month. This was implemented by extending the post to include more villages or increasing the quotas expected from the villagers, often indirectly forcing women and children to harvest the rubber as well. If production fell below the quota agents made up the shortfall in lost profits to the company from their pay. Each post consisted of a residence for the agent, barracks for armed sentries and sheds for rubber drying and storage, all built using labour conscripted from the villagers. A typical post employed ten African workmen to sort and dry the rubber, seven servants for the agent and thirty canoemen for local river transport. These were paid around 36.5 fr per year in goods, commonly 5kg of salt, one blanket, five machetes and trade goods to the value of 6.35 fr. The post system was managed by the Director of Congo Operations at the central office in Basankusu. He was assisted in his job of keeping production up and expenses down by the only Free State <b>employee</b> <b>in</b> the concession, the commander of the police. The police commander was in charge of suppressing revolts and punishing villages which dropped below the quota. He had access to a large force of men and river steamers which was stationed at Basankusu and could redeploy quickly to the site of large scale rebellions. Effective police commanders would receive bonuses paid for by Abir.|$|E
