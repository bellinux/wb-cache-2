50|$|<b>Elschnig</b> <b>spots</b> are {{commonly}} caused by acute hypertensive {{events of the}} choroidal vascular system, mostly in the young, because their system of vessels {{is not ready to}} handle the changes in blood pressure. These changes in blood pressure cause an infarct of the vessels leading to death of the RPE and photoreceptors they support creating this window defect.|$|E

40|$|Background: Malignant {{hypertension}} {{is defined}} by marked systemic arterial hypertension with retinal haemorrhages, exudation or papilloedema. Due to the rarity of this disease and due to its non-specific symptoms and lesions, the diagnosis can be challenging. Patients and Methods We investigated the types of symptoms and ocular lesions observed with ocular fundus examination, ocular fundus photography, fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography in a small case series of 7 patients with malignant hypertension. Results: Median systolic blood pressure (BP) was 205 [*]mmHg[*]±[*] 21. Median diastolic BP was 150 [*]mmHg[*]±[*] 16. Decrease in visual acuity (6 / 7 patients) and scotoma (5 / 7) were the main symptoms and <b>Elschnig</b> <b>spot,</b> flamed shaped haemorrhage, serous retinal detachment, cotton wool spots and optic nerve oedema were the five most frequently observed lesions. A regression of lesions was observed after therapy of systemic hypertension. Conclusion: The association of multiple lesions strongly suggests malignant hypertension. However even in cases with only one lesion malignant hypertension {{should be kept in}} mind...|$|R
