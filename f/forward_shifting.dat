40|$|Objective: <b>Forward</b> <b>shifting</b> of the {{posterior}} cervical dural sac {{is the most}} important sign in diagnosing Hirayama disease but can also be seen in normal subjects, causing potential diagnostic dilemma. We aim to explore the degree of forward displacement of posterior dural sac in normal subjects compared to that with Hirayama disease. Materials and methods: 50 healthy male teenagers and 3 patients with Hirayama disease were recruited into the control group and patient group, respectively. MR imaging of the cervical spine was performed in both neutral and flexion positions for all subjects, with the following parameters measured: maximal distance of <b>forward</b> <b>shifting</b> of posterior dural sac, dimension of dural sac and spinal cord. Results: <b>Forward</b> <b>shifting</b> of {{the posterior}} cervical dural sac was depicted in 46 % of normal subjects upon flexion position but without associated cord compression due to intrinsic expansion of the spinal canal volume. This intrinsic compensatory mechanism was inadequate in diseased patients leading to cord compression with significant increment in ratio of anteroposterior diameter of forward displacement of posterior dural wall/anteroposterior diameter of spinal canal ("x/y"), and decrement in ratio of anteroposterior diameter of spinal cord/perpendicular transverse diameter of spinal cord ("a/b"). Conclusion: Depicting of <b>forward</b> <b>shifting</b> of posterior dural sac alone on flexion position cannot reliably diagnose Hirayama disease, which should be established only if there is <b>forward</b> <b>shifting</b> of posterior dural sac, plus increased ratio of x/y and decreased ratio of a/b on flexion position from associated mass effect on the spinal cord. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|The work {{deals with}} the problem of changes in the {{relative}} prices of industrial outputs due to the imposition of a tax. Furthermore, the imposition of a tax induces changes in all of the components of the input-output table. The magnitude of the changes {{is a function of the}} degree of <b>forward</b> <b>shifting</b> of the tax under consideration. Although the analysis can be applied to any tax with due consideration to its shifting characteristics, the wellhead tax was selected as an illustrative example for several reasons. The tax has been proposed as an alternative to the existing system of controls and entitlements imposed on the production of crude oil in the United States after the oil embargo of 1974. The wellhead tax is equivalent to the tax on profits when the elasticity of supply of crude oil is zero. The tax on profits in another alternative which has been proposed to replace the system of controls and entitlements. The input-output tables of the U. S. Department of Commerce were analyzed in regard to their sources of data and methods of construction. From this analysis the conclusion was reached that the only possible interpretation of the tables is in "value" terms. That is, dollars for the transactions table and dollars per dollar for the direct requirements table. Three philosophically different methods were developed to analyze the price effects and to recompute the direct requirements table. The three methods yield identical results. The treatment of direct and indirect taxes in the American tables does not agree with accepted concepts of shifting in public finance. Namely, in the tables, indirect taxes are fully shifted forward while direct taxes are not shifted. In this work, simulations were run assuming different percentages of <b>forward</b> <b>shifting</b> for the wellhead tax. Comparison of the results, with analysis by Robert E. Hall, indicates that his study is equivalent to a sixty percent <b>forward</b> <b>shifting</b> of the tax.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a simple analytic approach {{for measuring the}} burden of carbon pricing that does not require sophisticated and numerically intensive economic models but which {{is not limited to}} restrictive assumptions of <b>forward</b> <b>shifting</b> of carbon prices. We also show how to adjust for the capital income bias contained in the Consumer Expenditure Survey, a bias towards regressivity in carbon pricing due to underreporting of capital income in higher income deciles in the Survey. Many distributional analyses of carbon pricing focus on the uses-side incidence of carbon pricing. This is the differential burden resulting from heterogeneity in consumption across households. Once one allows for sources-side incidence (i. e. differential impacts of changes in real factor prices), carbon policies look more progressive. Perhaps more important than the findings from any one scenario, our results on the progressivity of the leading cap and trade proposals are robust to the assumptions made on the relative importance of uses and sources side heterogeneity. ...|$|E

Production of copepodites and adults was estimated in 2 ways: (1) Peaks were separated and the <b>forward</b> <b>shifting</b> of peaks in consecutive stages was used to estimate stage durations; (2) the size frequency method was applied. Both estimates of the production of copepodites and adults are in good agreement: 1. 10 g dwt m - 2 and 1. 02 g dwt m - 2. Egg production amounts to 0. 31 g dwt m - 2; naupliar production is roughly estimated at 1. 11 g dwt m - 2.

40|$|Many memory models {{focus on}} {{encoding}} of sequences by excitatory recurrent synapses in region CA 3 of the hippocampus. However, data and modeling suggest an alternate mechanism for encoding of sequences in which interference between theta frequency oscillations encodes the position within a sequence based on spatial arc length or time. Arc length can be coded by an oscillatory interference model {{that accounts for}} many features of the context-dependent firing properties of hippocampal neurons observed during performance of spatial memory tasks. In continuous spatial alternation, many neurons fire selectively depending on the direction of prior or future response (left or right). In contrast, in delayed non-match to position, most neurons fire selectively for task phase (sample vs. choice), with less selectivity for left versus right. These seemingly disparate results are effectively simulated by the same model, based on mechanisms similar to a model of grid cell firing in entorhinal cortex. The model also simulates <b>forward</b> <b>shifting</b> of firing over trials. Adding effects of persistent firing with reset at reward locations addresses changes in context-dependent firing with different task designs. Arc length coding could contribute to episodic encoding of trajectories as sequences of states and actions...|$|E

To {{evaluate}} the <b>forward</b> <b>shifting</b> of cervical spinal cords in different segments {{of patients with}} Hirayama disease {{to determine whether the}} disease is self-limiting. Methods. This study was performed on 11 healthy subjects and 64 patients. According to the duration, the patients were divided into 5 groups (≤ 1 year, 1 - 2 years, 2 - 3 years, 3 - 4 years, and ≥ 4 years). Cervical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of flexion and conventional position was performed. The distances between the posterior edge of the spinal cord and the cervical spinal canal (X), the anterior and posterior wall of the cervical spinal canal (Y), and the anterior-posterior (A) and the transverse diameter (B) of spinal cord cross sections were measured at different cervical spinal segments (C 4 to T 1).

All the records of the genus from the Early Floian to Early Katian were confined to eastern peri-Gondwanan plates and terranes in low-latitude zones. It was only restricted to the South China, Tarim and North China plates until the Middle Darriwilian, but the Late Darriwilian eustatic sea-level rise and especially the Sandbian–Early Katian immense transgression may have brought about its dispersal to Alborz, Sibumasu and central Asian terranes. Following the closure of the Tornquist Sea, the genus was even able to spread to Baltica during the latest Katian, and the pre-Hirnantian warming (the Boda event) may have promoted a wider distribution of Ovalocephalus to western peri-Gondwana (the Taurides and Armorica terranes) in the then-high latitudes...|$|E
