5|$|In {{response}} to the historic September collapse by the Red Sox, they hired outspoken manager Bobby Valentine to take Francona's place. After his signing, Valentine immediately inserted himself into the rivalry {{when he said he}} <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> Yankees.|$|E
5|$|Richardson's last stage role of {{the decade}} was in 1969, as Dr Rance in What the Butler Saw by Joe Orton. It was a {{conspicuous}} failure. The public <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> play and made the fact vociferously clear at the first night.|$|E
5|$|Coronel was {{replaced}} by session musician Ron Leejack, and the group continued their efforts to finish the album. Some songs were completely re-recorded to accommodate Leejack's different playing style. The entire recording process, which followed a haphazard schedule, took nearly a year to complete. When the completed album was presented to Don Ellis, Epic's A director, he stated that he <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> album and {{was not going to}} release it. The next day, Wicked Lester manager Lew Linet requested and received the group's release from Epic Records.|$|E

5|$|The Zelda team, however, had {{exhausted}} its {{ideas for}} this style and format. Aonuma <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> demo, finding it derivative of past Zelda games. The team explored other directions until designer Yoshiki Haruhana created a cartoonish {{drawing of a}} young Link that caught their eye. Design manager Satoru Takizawa drew up an enemy Moblin in a similar style, and the team seized on the new gameplay and combat possibilities afforded by the stylized cartoon aesthetic. To achieve this look, they used cel shading on 3D models, giving the look of an interactive cartoon. The developers built the game with Alias/Wavefront's Maya 3D tool and a custom game engine.|$|E
5|$|When previewed, {{the focus}} group liked the concept but <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> way the pilot was produced. Among the {{problems}} with the original pilot was the believability of the Eppes family in terms of both physical appearance and chemistry, with the chemistry of the actors being the larger issue. Although Heuton and Falacci liked Cariou, Macht, and Krumholtz, Heuton and Falacci did not know how the three actors playing the Eppes family would interact with each other until filming began.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} their mutual dislike, the Electress and Violante Beatrice {{attempted}} to improve Gian Gastone's poor public image together. Rumours abounded that the Grand Duke had died; it was a rarity {{for the public to}} see him. To dispel the said rumours, the Electress compelled him to make an appearance—his last one—in 1729, on the feast day of the patron saint of Florence, John the Baptist. The Ruspanti, Gian Gastone's morally corrupt entourage, <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> Electress; and she, them. Violante Beatrice tried to withdraw the Grand Duke from their sphere of influence by organising banquets. His conduct at these literally sent those in attendance scrambling for their carriages: he vomited repeatedly into his napkin, belched and told rude jokes. These distractions ceased upon Violante Beatrice's death in 1731.|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} few weeks, the buzz about the {{internal}} battles inside the Republican Party has been growing. <b>The</b> Roveites <b>hate</b> <b>the</b> Libertarians, <b>the</b> Libertarians <b>hate</b> <b>the</b> mainstream Republicans, <b>the</b> mainstream Republicans <b>hate</b> <b>the</b> Tea Partiers and everybody hates President Obama. It feels more like a Tom Lehrer song than the plight of a serious political party facing a serious struggle...|$|R
5000|$|Daisy's {{adoptive father}} Orlee Smith gave her some last advice while on his death bed. He said, [...] "You're filled with hatred. Hate can destroy you, Daisy. Don't hate white people just because they're white. If you hate, make it count for something. <b>Hate</b> <b>the</b> humiliations {{we are living}} under in <b>the</b> South. <b>Hate</b> <b>the</b> {{discrimination}} that eats away at <b>the</b> South. <b>Hate</b> <b>the</b> discrimination that eats away at the soul of every black man and woman. <b>Hate</b> <b>the</b> insults hurled at us by white scum - {{and then try to}} do something about it, or your hate won't spell a thing." ...|$|R
60|$|She sat apprehensively on {{the edge}} of a chair, <b>hating</b> <b>the</b> women at <b>the</b> windows, <b>hating</b> <b>the</b> dull, {{persistent}} flies, <b>hating</b> <b>the</b> wetness of her forehead and the dampness of her palm; repenting of her hate and hating again--and taking another cold bath to be fresh for the home-coming of Carl, the tired man whom she had to mother and whom, of all the world, she did not hate.|$|R
5|$|On October 28, Persis Khambatta {{was hired}} to portray Ilia. She had been {{required}} to wear a bald cap for her screen test, although {{at this point the}} character also wore elaborate headgear in some footage. Roddenberry was insistent on this as a character attribute, but others such as Eisner <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> idea of a bald female character. His notes said that while a bald female character would be an interesting addition, it may prevent the audience from feeling at ease with Ilia and so the style may need to be given to a different character entirely. The auditions by this time were not held under the pretence that they were to play a part in a television series, but were openly talking about Star Trek becoming a feature film. The casting for Willard Decker had been delayed, both because of a slight delay in the production but also because the writers were no longer sure that the character was needed at all. This was despite auditions being conducted {{at the same time that}} Gautreaux was cast as Xon, during which, in his second audition with Barrett, he also read lines against ten actors competing for the role of Decker.|$|E
5|$|Setting up an encampment in the jungle, the survivors, {{including}} the Castros, Che Guevara, and Camilo Cienfuegos, began launching raids on small army-posts to obtain weaponry. In January 1957 they overran the outpost {{near to the}} beach at La Plata; Guevara treated the soldiers for any injuries, but the revolutionaries executed the local mayoral (land-company overseer) Chicho Osorio, whom the local peasants despised and who boasted of killing one of the MR-26-7 rebels several weeks previously. Osorio's execution aided the rebels in gaining the trust of locals, who typically <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> mayorals as enforcers of the wealthy landowners, although they largely remained unenthusiastic and suspicious of the revolutionaries. As trust grew, some locals joined the rebels, although most new recruits came from urban areas. With increasing numbers of volunteers, who now numbered over 200, in July 1957 Castro divided his army into three columns, keeping charge of one and giving control of the others to his brother and Guevara. The MR-26-7 members operating in urban areas continued agitation, sending supplies to Castro, and on 16 February 1957 he met with other senior members to discuss tactics; here he met Celia Sánchez, who would become a close friend.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} with this, Poporanist critic Garabet Ibrăileanu argued that Caragiale actually <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> people who inspired his works, {{and claimed that}} the writer had made this clear during one of their conversations. His account was considered doubtful by researcher Ştefan Cazimir, who believed that Ibrăileanu was using it to back a polemic and singular overview of Caragiale's work.|$|E

25|$|Barbara Kelly {{was born}} in Vancouver, British Columbia in 1924.

Kelly's first professional role was playing the Virgin Mary in a Nativity Play. Kelly's father, an Irishman, was a lorry driver in Vancouver. Her mother, who was from Manchester, forced ballet classes and elocution lessons on her.|$|E

If the crime is a small one, then you ought to be angry with the crime and reluctant to punish the criminal; but when there are great crimes, then you may hate them together. What! am I to love Nero? {{to fall in love with}} Heliogabalus? is Domitian to be the subject of my affection? No, we <b>hate</b> <b>the</b> crime, and we <b>hate</b> <b>the</b> criminal ten times more; and if I use indignant language, if I use the language of scorn and horror with respect to the criminal, I use the language that becomes me.|$|R
25|$|Shiism did {{not become}} fully {{established}} until the reign of Abbas I of Persia (1587–1629). Abbas <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> Sunnis, and forced the population to accept Twelver Shiism. Thus by 1602 most of the formerly Sunnis of Iran had accepted Shiism. A significant number, however, did not accept Safavid rule, prompting Abbas to institute a number of administrative changes {{in order to further}} transform Iran into a Twelver Shia state.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year, at age 13, Abdurahman {{was sent}} to Jihad Wel al-Farouq for seven days; US officials have said the training camp was run by al-Qaeda personnel to train their militants. On August 20, 1998, the Al Farouq training camp was bombed by American cruise missiles and Amr Hamed, a friend of Khadr's, was killed. Khadr later said that as a youth, he had <b>hated</b> <b>the</b> Americans for killing his friend.|$|E
