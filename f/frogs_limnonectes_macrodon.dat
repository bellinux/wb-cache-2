40|$|Several {{millions}} frogs {{captured in}} the wild in Indonesia are sold for food yearly in French supermarkets, as deep frozen frog legs. They are commercialized as Rana macrodon, but up to 15 look-alike species might also be concerned by this trade. From December 2012 to May 2013, we bought 209 specimens of deep frozen frog legs, and identified them through a barcoding approach based on the 16 S gene. Our results show that 206 out of the 209 specimens belong to Fejervarya cancrivora, two to <b>Limnonectes</b> <b>macrodon</b> and one to F. moodiei. Thus only 0. 96 % of the frogs were correctly identified. Unless misclassification was intentional, it seems that Indonesian frog leg exporters {{are not able to}} discriminate between the species. The quasi absence of L. macrodon in our samples might be an indication of its rarity, confirming that its natural populations are declining rapidly, in agreement with its “vulnerable” status according to the IUCN Red List.

As part of a population study of three species of edible frogs in Indonesia, we examined phalanges taken from toe clips of Fejervarya limnocharis, F. cancrivora, and <b>Limnonectes</b> <b>macrodon</b> to determine whether it is possible to estimate the ages of individuals of these tropical species using skeletochronology. For every frog captured, we recorded sex, body size as measured by SVL (snout-vent length) and mass, and clip code.

2500|$|Size is {{important}} in male-male competition, with larger males having an advantage, due to the [...] "male combat hypothesis" [...] which suggests that male combative behavior is positively related to male body size.

40|$|Amphibians are {{the most}} {{threatened}} of all vertebrates. Alarming declines of amphibian species {{is considered to be}} a direct consequence of extreme vulnerability associated with specific requirements of the micro - environmental conditions. Disruption of these conditions causes irreversible changes in species composition of amphibians, affected area tends to have lower diversity and abundance of native species. The most threatened amphibian species are those with narrow habitat preferences, living in specific areas where any intervention can lead to rapid decrease or complete disappearance of species. Habitat loss, intensive land use, fragmentation, invasive species, diseases, pesticides and climate change are the main causes of dramatic decline in amphibian species richness worldwide. Habitat loss, endangering many species worldwide, is considered the biggest threat to amphibians. Southeast Asia is currently experiencing one of the largest global deforestations. Many factors are involved in forest losses, e. g. Population growth, logging, changes in cultivation practices, infrastructure growth, politics, forest fires and global environmental factors. At least half of the forest loss is associated with human activity. Deforestation due to agriculture or livestock expansion causes degradation and loss of soil, microclimate changes and loss of biodiversity. An extent reduction in space required for preservation and development of biodiversity is the result of devastation of the environment. This process particularly affects the presence and abundance of native amphibian species. It has been proven that even low to moderate levels of anthropogenic disturbance have a measurable and profound impact on tropical species. Examples are conversion of rainforests to oil palm monoculture plantations, destroying the entire ecological niche, disrupting complex food chains and natural migration corridors of animals. Compare to forests or other woody crops plantations, significantly fewer species are found in areas with oil palm. The main aim of the practical part of this thesis is a field research carried out in two different island areas in Indonesia. The research was primarily focused on frog species composition in different habitats. Selected target areas were the islands of Simeulue and Bangkaru that are a part of a chain of islands on the west coast of Sumatra. These research areas were chosen for various types of biomes represented on them. Biotope of the first of the islands was largely affected by human activity hence a significant part of it is used for agriculture. The second island was never affected by human activity and is entirely covered with primary rainforest. On the base of research performed in farm area of the island of Simeulue, following frog species were confirmed to occure: Duttaphrynus melanostictus (Schneider, 1799), Odorrana hosii (Boulenger, 1891), <b>Limnonectes</b> <b>macrodon</b> (Duméril a Bibron, 1841) and Amnirana nicobariensis (Stoliczka, 1870). Presence of two frog species not described on Simeulue yet was proven - Microhyla fissipes Boulenger, 1884 and Rhacophorus margaritifer (Schlegel, 1837). Presence of Hylarana parvacola (Inger, Stuart & Iskandar, 2009) was confirmed on the island of Bangkaru. Furthermore one, on Bangkaru previously undescribed species, <b>Limnonectes</b> <b>macrodon</b> (Duméril a Bibron, 1841) was discovered. Richer frog species diversity was found in economically utilized areas on inhabited island of Simeulue. Frog diversity in the primary forest on Bangkaru, which has never been colonized, was lower. The results may collide with literature, indicating that a greater diversity of species is occurring in less disturbed areas. This proves that the abundance of species can be influenced not only by environment disturbance but also by other factors. In this case, different sizes and levels of isolation of the islands are probably involved. These findings are supported by the theory of island biogeography, which states that large islands have more species than small ones and islands close to the mainland have more species than isolated ones. The objective of this work was only a basic research; its findings should be supported by more detailed studies carried out in the area...|$|R

Some physico-chemical parameters that characteristic for giant frog habitat i. e. air and water temperatur, relative humidity, dissolved oxygen, free CO 2 and NH 3 in water were measured. Moreover, the reproduction aspects being observed were gonad characteristics, egg size and form, and sperm density. The {{results indicated that the}} giant frog habitat was river stream with physical characteristics as following air temperature : 27 o– 28 oC, water temperature : 24 o- 26 oC, relative humidity : 83 %– 87 %, water turbidity : 1, 2 – 11, 6 nephelometric turbidity unit (NTU), and altitude : 20 - 40 m above sea level.

40|$|Bradykinin-related {{peptides}} (BRPs) {{are significant}} {{components of the}} defensive skin secretions of many anuran amphibians, and these secretions represent {{the source of the}} most diverse spectrum of such peptides so far encountered in nature. Of the many families of bioactive peptides that have been identified from this source, the BRPs uniquely appear to represent homologues of counterparts that have specific distributions and receptor targets within discrete vertebrate taxa, ranging from fishes through mammals. Their broad spectra of actions, including pain and inflammation induction and smooth muscle effects, make these peptides ideal weapons in predator deterrence. Here, we describe a novel 12 -mer BRP (RVALPPGFTPLR-RVAL-(L 1, T 6, L 8) -bradykinin) from the skin secretion of the Fujian large-headed <b>frog</b> (<b>Limnonectes</b> fujianensis). The C-terminal 9 residues of this BRP (-LPPGFTPLR) exhibit three amino acid substitutions (L/R at Position 1, T/S at Position 6 and L/F at Position 8) when compared to canonical mammalian bradykinin (BK), but are identical to the kinin sequence present within the cloned kininogen- 2 from the Chinese soft-shelled turtle (Pelodiscus sinensis) and differ from that encoded by kininogen- 2 of the Tibetan ground tit (Pseudopodoces humilis) at just a single site (F/L at Position 8). These data would imply that the novel BRP is an amphibian defensive agent against predation by sympatric turtles and also that the primary structure of the avian BK, ornithokinin (RPPGFTPLR), is not invariant within this taxon. Synthetic RVAL-(L 1, T 6, L 8) -bradykinin was found to be an antagonist of BK-induced rat tail artery smooth muscle relaxation acting via the B 2 -receptor...|$|R
