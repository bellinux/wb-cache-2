500|$|The {{character}} of Tim Riggins has developed over time from an unfocused and moody alcoholic {{to a young}} man of character and dependability. Sometimes that dependability is reflected in his uncanny ability to make the wrong choices <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>reasons,</b> which usually involve his brother. Even though he has proven his ability to help others correct their misguided choices, unfortunately there is no one who does this for Tim. In this season, his irresponsible, headstrong, but lovable brother again entices Tim into another wrong choice by convincing Tim that {{the only way they can}} make any money is by transforming their newly opened garage into a chop shop. Just as they finally end this side business and Tim has enough for the down payment on a large amount of land he's been dreaming about, the police show up to arrest him at the garage. The police officers recognize Tim as [...] "number 33" [...] giving Tim no chance to deny that it's his chop shop. True to his character, he makes the decision to take the rap and allows his brother to be with his new wife and child. The season ends as Tim walks toward the jail.|$|E

2500|$|According to Kierkegaard, {{the human}} self desires {{that which is}} beyond reason. Desire itself {{appears to be a}} desire for the infinite, as Plato once wrote. Even the desire to propagate, {{according}} to Plato, is a kind of desire for immortality—that is, we wish to live on in time through our children and their children. Erotic love itself appears as an example of this desire for something beyond the purely finite. It is a taste of what could be, if only it could continue beyond the boundaries of time and space. As the analogy implies, humans seek something beyond the here and now. The question remains, however, why is it that human pathos or passion is the most precious thing? In some ways, it might have to do with our status as existential beings. It is not thought that gets us through life—it is action; and what motivates and sustains action is passion, the desire to overcome hardships, pain, and suffering. It is also passion that enables us to die for ideals {{in the name of a}} higher reality. While a scientist might see this as plain emotion or simple animal desire, Kierkegaard sees it as that which binds to the source of life itself. The desire to live, and to live in the right way, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>reasons,</b> and with the right desires, is a holy and sacred force. For Kierkegaard all Christian action should have its ground in love, which is a passion.|$|E
2500|$|In 2003 Dom {{underwent}} a storyline where he fell for {{his best friends}} sister, 15-year-old Delphi Greenlaw. Cortese was at first uncomfortable with the storyline, stating; [...] "I was very worried about the age difference but the way it's been done and written is really respectful." [...] Cortese also believed despite the age difference, Dom was truly in love with Delphi; [...] "Dom sees Delphi as his soul mate, she affects {{him in a way}} no one has before because he's always been suspicious of relationships. He doesn't have to pretend to be anyone else for her to like him." [...] Producer Harriet Crampton enjoyed the romance and how it contrasted with Dom's evil character, stating; [...] "To have a villain who has a strong sincere love or passion makes you think, ‘Okay, he’s an absolute bastard but we know he does love Delphi." [...] The two first get together when Delphi turns 16, sharing a kiss. The two eventually start a relationship but break up when Dom comes under question of Geoff's murder in arguably one of the soap's most memorable storylines. Dom flees when Delphi confronts him about the murder but later returns, with Cortese suggesting it was for love; [...] "But the thing about Dominic is he believes he's doing everything <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>reasons.</b> He's done everything he can for Delphi— that's his main reason for coming back." [...] Dom later scares Delphi into fleeing the country, ending the once seemingly perfect relationship.|$|E

60|$|A Blot on the 'Scutcheon {{followed}} The Return of the Druses. In {{connection with}} the performance of this very fine play a quarrel arose which would not be worth mentioning if it did not happen to illustrate the curious energetic simplicity of Browning's character. Macready, who was in desperately low financial circumstances at this time, tried by every means conceivable to avoid playing the part; he dodged, he shuffled, he tried every evasion that occurred to him, but it never occurred to Browning to see what he meant. He pushed off the part upon Phelps, and Browning was contented; he resumed it, and Browning was only discontented on behalf of Phelps. The two had a quarrel; they were both headstrong, passionate men, but the quarrel dealt entirely with the unfortunate condition of Phelps. Browning beat down his own hat over his eyes; Macready flung Browning's manuscript with a slap upon the floor. But all the time it never occurred to the poet that Macready's conduct was dictated by anything so crude and simple as a desire for money. Browning was in fact by his principles and his ideals a man of the world, but in his life far otherwise. That worldly ease which is to most of us a temptation was to him an ideal. He was as it were a citizen of the New Jerusalem who desired with perfect sanity and simplicity to be a citizen of Mayfair. There was in him a quality which can only be most delicately described; for it was a virtue which bears a strange resemblance to one of the meanest of vices. Those curious people who think the truth a thing that can be said violently and with ease, might naturally call Browning a snob. He was fond of society, of fashion and even of wealth: but there is no snobbery in admiring these things or any things if we admire them <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>reasons.</b> He admired them as worldlings cannot admire them: he was, as it were, the child who comes in with the dessert. He bore the same relation to the snob that the righteous man bears to the Pharisee: something frightfully close and similar and yet an everlasting opposite.|$|E

40|$|In 'Against Agent-Based Virtue Ethics' (2004) Michael Brady rejects {{agent-based}} virtue ethics on {{the grounds}} that it fails to capture the commonsense distinction between an agent's doing <b>the</b> <b>right</b> thing, and her doing it <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>reason.</b> In his view, the failure to account for this distinction has paradoxical results, making it unable to explain why an agent has a duty to perform a given action.

If we reject this view, and instead provide a version of agent-basing that determines obligations in terms of the motives of the hypothetical virtuous agent, the paradox disappears...|$|R

50|$|Aristotle {{asserted}} that man had three natures: body (physical/metabolism), animal (emotional/appetite) and rational (mental/conceptual). Physical nature can be assuaged through exercise and care, emotional nature through indulgence of instinct and urges, and mental through human reason and developed potential. Rational development {{was considered the}} most important, as essential to philosophical self-awareness and as uniquely human. Moderation was encouraged, with the extremes seen as degraded and immoral. For example, courage is the moderate virtue between the extremes of cowardice and recklessness. Man should not simply live, but live well with conduct governed by moderate virtue. This is regarded as difficult, as virtue denotes doing <b>the</b> <b>right</b> thing, to <b>the</b> <b>right</b> person, at <b>the</b> <b>right</b> time, to <b>the</b> proper extent, in <b>the</b> correct fashion, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>reason.</b>|$|R
