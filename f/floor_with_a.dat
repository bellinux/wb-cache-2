5|$|Ivall's Cottage, a Grade II listed {{building}} since 1985, is located opposite the post box {{near the village}} green. The cottage was originally built during the 16th century, with late 18th century and early 19th century additions with contemporary extensions at the sides. The cottage is built from red brick and flint in Flemish bond, with cambered openings on the ground <b>floor</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> part-thatched, part-tiled roof. The roof is hipped at the west end, with lower eaves at the rear intercepted by eyebrow dormers.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} has two rooms and an attached kitchen {{on the ground}} <b>floor</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> staircase between them leading to the living quarters in the first floor rooms. The front room may originally have been a shop but was not used for trade after {{the installation of the}} new front wall in the 16th century. The front room has recesses {{on either side of the}} arched fireplace. The rear room on the ground floor was the hall and still has its 16th-century ceiling panels and four-light window. The ceiling has plaster decorations from the Elizabethan era, when the kitchen block was also added.|$|E

5|$|The temple is at {{the edge}} of a {{triangular}} cliff which overlooks the ravine of the Azat River and the Gegham mountains. It is part of the fortress of Garni. One of the oldest fortresses in Armenia, it is mentioned as Gorneas in the first-century Annals of Tacitus. The fortress was strategically significant for the defense of the major cities in the Ararat plain. The site is in the village of Garni, in Armenia's Kotayk Province and includes the temple, a Roman bath with a partly preserved mosaic <b>floor</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Greek inscription, a royal summer palace, the seventh century church of St. Sion and other minor items (e.g., medieval khachkars).|$|E
5|$|Christians {{believed}} in a bodily {{resurrection of the}} dead at the Second Coming of Christ, and the Catholic Church only relaxed its opposition to cremation in 1963. Although mass ossuaries have also been used, burial {{has always been the}} preferred Christian tradition, at least until recent times. Burial was, for as long as there was room, usually in a graveyard adjacent to the church, with a gravestone or horizontal slab, or for the wealthy or important clergy, inside it. Wall tombs in churches strictly include the body itself, often in a sarcophagus, while often the body is buried in a crypt or under the church <b>floor,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> monument on the wall. Persons of importance, especially monarchs, might be buried in a free-standing sarcophagus, perhaps surrounded by an elaborate enclosure using metalwork and sculpture; grandest of all were the shrines of saints, which became the destinations of pilgrimages. The monument to MaximilianI, Holy Roman Emperor in the Hofkirche, Innsbruck took decades to complete, while the tomb of Saint Dominic in Bologna took several centuries to reach its final form.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 18th century Henry Hare, 3rd Baron Coleraine (1694–1749) oversaw a remodelling {{of the north}} of the house, that added a range of rooms to the north and the Coleraine coat of arms to the {{pediment}} of the north facade. In the late 18th century, under the ownership of James Townsend, the narrow east facade of the house was remodelled into an entrance front, and given the appearance of a typical Georgian house. At the same time, the south front's gabled attics were removed, giving the house's southern elevation its current appearance. An inventory of the house made in 1789 in preparation for its sale listed a hall, saloon, drawing room, dining room and breakfast parlour on the ground <b>floor,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> library and billiard room on the first floor.|$|E

5|$|On Monday 4 February, William {{bought some}} rope {{at the local}} grocer's shop, and {{spent the rest of}} the day observing cases at the Sheriff Court from the public gallery. He was later {{reported}} to have listened attentively to the proceedings. On 7 February, he attended the court sessions again. On 10 February, he visited his acquaintance, Walker, who lent him a newspaper that featured a woman's suicide by hanging. Walker asked Bury to look up any news of Jack the Ripper, at which Bury threw down the newspaper with a fright. That evening, he walked into the Dundee Central Police Station on Bell Street and reported his wife's suicide to Lieutenant James Parr. He said they had been drinking heavily the night before her death, and he had woken in the morning to find his wife's body on the <b>floor</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> rope around her neck. Bury had not summoned a doctor, but had instead cut the body and concealed it in one of the packing cases brought from London. Bury told Parr that his actions were now preying on his mind, and he was afraid that he would be arrested and accused of being Jack the Ripper.|$|E

5|$|Shay {{was found}} dead in a Kansas City hotel room on December 1, 1927. He was found with a gunshot wound to the head. Police {{officials}} initially said that the manner of death could have been either suicide or murder. Shay stayed in his room on the day that he died. A porter went to check on him that evening and found him on the <b>floor</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> pistol a few inches from his right hand. When physicians examined Shay's body, they found that a bullet had entered the right ear and exited the back of the head. Shay had lost the use of his right arm and hand after a stroke. Police said that if Shay were holding the gun in his left hand, {{it would not have been}} easy for him to shoot himself in the right side of the head.|$|E

5|$|The Ultimate Warrior {{gained the}} early {{advantage}} in his steel cage match with Rick Rude. After the Warrior missed a splash attempt, Rude attempted {{to win the}} match by escaping the cage. The Warrior stopped him, and both wrestlers unsuccessfully attempted to perform their finishing moves. Rude was then able to perform a Rude Awakening neckbreaker but chose to continue attacking the Warrior rather than escape the cage. Rude performed a shoulderblock and tried to leave through the cage door. The Warrior held him back while Bobby Heenan, Rude's manager, tried to pull Rude out. The Warrior pulled both Rude and Heenan into the cage. He punched Heenan and then threw {{him out of the}} cage with an atomic drop. Warrior then knocked Rude down three times with clotheslines and threw him onto the ring <b>floor</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> gorilla press drop. Warrior climbed over the cage and dropped to the arena floor to win the match and retain the WWF World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E
5|$|The chapel was {{designed}} by Sir Charles Barry, shortly before he designed the Palace of Westminster. It was constructed between 1837 and 1839 out of sandstone, with a slate roof. It is in English neogothic style. The building has seven narrow bays, with buttresses and a lancet in each bay. The west end has a giant moulded archway, with an arched doorway at the ground <b>floor</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> window above. On the east end there is a rose window. The corners are square, with pinnacles. The inside of the chapel had galleries on three sides, and a ribbed, vaulted ceiling. The attached two-storey Sunday School {{is in the same}} style as the chapel, and has a triple-gabled north side, with large arched windows on the first floor. It also has a canted apse on the west end, and a lean-to porch. The building was listed on 3 October 1974, and is currently classed as Grade II*.|$|E
5|$|The monastery (called St. Seiriol's monastery) grew in {{size and}} had a wooden church {{building}} by the 10th century. This wooden building was, however, destroyed in 971 and then rebuilt in the 12th century in stone, from 1120 to 1123. The oldest parts of the Priory Church of St Seiriol date to 1140. It survived the initial Norman invasion of Gwynedd between 1081 and 1100, defended by Prince Gruffudd ap Cynan of Gwynedd. The priory church was enlarged in the early 13th century, {{at the time of}} the Augustinian Rule. There are records for the election of Priors in the Calendar of Patent Rolls back to 1306, when one Iowerth the Prior is mentioned. The dining hall was on the first <b>floor,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> cellar below and dormitory above. In the 16th century, a kitchen and a warming house were added at the east of the building. The eastern range of buildings has gone, but the southern one, containing the refectory with a dormitory above, still stands.|$|E
