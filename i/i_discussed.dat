500|$|I {{was visiting}} {{my friend and}} generous benefactor, Prof. Edward C. Pickering. With {{characteristic}} kindness, he had volunteered to have the spectra observed for all the stars—including comparison stars—which had been observed in the observations for stellar parallax which Hinks and I made at Cambridge, and <b>I</b> <b>discussed.</b> This piece of apparently routine work proved very fruitful—it led to the discovery that all the stars of very faint absolute magnitude were of spectral class M. In conversation on this subject (as I recall it), I asked Pickering about certain other faint stars, not on my list, mentioning in particular 40 Eridani B. Characteristically, he sent a note to the Observatory office and before long the answer came (I think from Mrs Fleming) that the spectrum of this star was A. I knew enough about it, even in these paleozoic days, to realize at once {{that there was an}} extreme inconsistency between what we would then have called [...] "possible" [...] values of the surface brightness and density. I must have shown that I was not only puzzled but crestfallen, at this exception to what looked like a very pretty rule of stellar characteristics; but Pickering smiled upon me, and said: [...] "It is just these exceptions that lead to an advance in our knowledge", and so the white dwarfs entered the realm of study! ...|$|E
500|$|Science fiction Grand Masters, Sir Arthur C. Clarke and Frederik Pohl collaborated for {{the first}} time on The Last Theorem. The novel {{initially}} was Clarke's, and he began working on it in early 2004. But in 2006, at the age of 88, ill health brought on by complications from post-polio syndrome, and writer's block, impeded his progress, and he asked Pohl for help. Pohl explained: [...] "Arthur said to me that he woke up one morning and didn't know how to write any of the books he had contracted. The stories had just gone out of his head." [...] Clarke gave Pohl a 40–50 page manuscript plus roughly 50 pages of notes, and over the next two years, Pohl wrote the book. Pohl said that [...] "Everything in the novel is something he either suggested or wrote or <b>I</b> <b>discussed</b> with him." [...] Some of Clarke's notes were so obscure that even Clarke himself could not understand them. Pohl, only two years younger than Clarke, had health problems of his own: he could no longer type and wrote the book out in longhand, leaving it up to his wife to translate his [...] "indecipherable scribbles". Clarke reviewed and approved the final manuscript of The Last Theorem in early March 2008, just days before he died. Pohl died five years later in September 2013.|$|E

500|$|Matt Norris of Cinema Blend {{stated that}} most of the events portrayed in the episode were unexpected, {{including}} Dualla's suicide, Starbuck finding her own supposed body, discovering the thirteenth tribe were Cylons, and that Ellen Tigh is the final model, but still thought the episode was among the top five Battlestar Galactica episodes in its run. Marc Bernardin of Entertainment Weekly stated that a lot had been going on in the episode, but criticised the writers' decision of having Ellen as the fifth Cylon. While Dualla's suicide was surprising for Bernardin, he was critical about the Adama scene after her suicide, stating it as [...] "some of Olmos' worst acting in the series", and that the answered questions for the episode raised more questions, but felt the episode was good overall. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger commented: [...] "What really grabs me about the show (as <b>I</b> <b>discussed</b> in today's column) is its humanity, the way its characters react to situations the way you imagine real, contemporary people might" [...] and felt that [...] "as the stakes for the characters has risen, so has the intensity of [...] performances," [...] with even the extras in character. Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune praised Nankin's directing, particularly [...] "the moment in which we see Kara Thrace, silhouetted in black against a dark blue sky, preparing to burn “her” body—that’s sent a shiver down my spine. That was just such a beautifully operatic image, spot-on in tone and perfectly executed." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{appearing}} on the show in series 6, Richard Herring wrote on his blog: [...] "What a delightful and fascinating programme this is (and one that I think might benefit from an extended podcast release - two hours of material is recorded for the 27 minute show and it's pretty much all gold!). At times I was so enjoying listening to the others talking that I almost forgot that I {{was meant to be}} taking part. It was a wide-ranging discussion taking in ants on stilts, pianists with crippling, mechanical little fingers, the changing meridian and okapi sex (can you guess what I contributed?). The show has a dedicated team of nerds behind it who have dug out amazing facts and I love the way it has a panel comprising comedians, scientists and experts and attempts to link each contribution to similar areas of the different disciplines. While most TV panel shows (including to some extent even QI) gravitate to putting in the same well-known comedy faces, you get a lot more interesting stuff by mixing it up a bit. The zoologist, Dr Christofer Clemente, came up with the funniest lines of the show. But would they book him on Mock The Week? It's intelligent and stimulating programming that is increasingly being edged out of TV and even radio, leaving a gaping open goal for independent internet productions to score in. <b>I</b> <b>discussed</b> this with one of the razor-minded team after the show. The TV companies insist on getting big names into all shows, which takes up all the budget and seems to ignore the fact that the pool of possible contributors gets smaller and more boring. But glad that a few shows designed to expand the mind rather than crush the spirit still exist." ...|$|E

[...] "The order impinged directly on an area of artistic prerogative ... <b>I</b> <b>discussed</b> the problem with cast members and... they were very supportive of my stand." [...] The Post editorial complained of the state-sponsored Virginia Museum's [...] "Big Brother government" [...] interference in theater art. [...] A museum trustee was quoted as saying, [...] "Accountability {{is the name of}} the game," [...] to which the editorial replied, [...] "Maybe in government, but not in theater. [...] Theater goers have a right to assume that the art they pay to hear and see reflects the genius and biases of the playwright, players and play director, not the government." [...] Local letter writers noted ironically that the sense of scandal that accompanied Byron in his lifetime seemed reflected in the new storm attending his stage debut. [...] "Throughout his life," [...] commented one correspondent, [...] "Byron and his poetry drew both acclaim and outrage. [...] The controversial reception of Childe Byron is a tribute to its success." [...] Patrons on either side threatened to cancel subscriptions. [...] Letters to editorial pages grew heated for and against the museum's attempt to impose revisions on the play.|$|E
