Three of these fibers have greatly contributed {{to the safety of}} all the space missions since the Apollo program. Beta alumina-silica microfiber developed for the outer layer of the space suit after the Apollo 1 fire is no longer used and has been replaced by other glass fibers. Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (e-PTFE) fiber used in the current spacesuit is mostly known today through its trade mark Gore-Tex. Polybenzimidazole (PBI) filament fiber used in many applications from the Apollo to the Space Shuttle program is no longer available. More recently, TOR"TM" copolymer of polyimide fiber developed during the space shuttle program to resist the atomic oxygen present in Low Earth Orbit has been barely used. The high cost and narrow range of aeronautical and aerospace applications have, however, led to a limited production of these fibers. Only fibers that found niche markets survived. Yet, deep space exploration will require more of these inherently <b>flame</b> <b>retardant</b> fibers than what is available today. There is a need for new <b>flame</b> <b>retardant</b> <b>fabrics</b> inside the space vehicles as well as a need for logistics reduction for long term space missions.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Flame</b> <b>retardant</b> <b>fabrics</b> {{have been}} broadly used for {{protective}} clothing, which have strictly requirements on both flame retardancy and thermal protection. Usually, domestic laundering {{will be carried}} out frequently to clean these protective garments. However, little research on the performance durability of this type of fabrics after domestic laundering has been reported. This paper selected fabrics of 8 types of cotton and its blend fibers, which were treated with <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> Pyrovatex CP, Proban, CFR- 201, SCJ- 968 respectively. The damaged length, after flame time, after glow time, TPP value, thermal resistance value, weight, thickness, air permeability and water vapor permeability (WVP) of the samples were measured before and after 15 cycles domestic laundering cycles. Results show that the flame retardancy of the 8 fabrics reduce with launderings as measured by the increase in damaged length and after glow time. The TPP increase probably resulted from the increase in the thickness and thermal resistance of the finished fabrics. Domestic laundering resulted in only a slight change in the comfort properties of the fabrics. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis aims at {{developing}} {{a method of}} chemical aftertreatment for reduction of free formaldehyde release of a tetrakis (hydroxymethyl) phosphonium chloride (THPC) urea precondensate, ammonia cured durable <b>flame</b> <b>retardant</b> finished cotton <b>fabric,</b> by preventing the formation of free formaldehyde. Formaldehyde is toxic and carcinogenic. According to the worldwide standards, acceptable limit of free formaldehyde release, for the fabrics that have skin contact, is only 75 ppm (measured by water extraction method). In this research, a cotton <b>fabric</b> <b>flame</b> <b>retardant</b> finished in an industrial plant in Pakistan is used. Fabric is finished by the application of THPC urea precondensate and ammonia cured, oxidized and washed. After finishing, it is not aftertreated with sodium metabisulfite that is a commonly used aftertreatment method for the reduction of free formaldehyde release. Aftertreatment with sodium metabisulfite has various problems that include large number of hot washings {{and there is an}} increase in the formaldehyde release during fabric storage. If the fabric has 75 ppm of free formaldehyde, there is often an increase in free formaldehyde release during fabric storage. There is a very limited research on the aftertreatment methods and few reports of application of these aftertreatments on <b>flame</b> <b>retardant</b> <b>fabrics</b> have been published. In this research, two methods of aftertreatments are developed to reduce the free formaldehyde contents to 75 ppm or less. One is the aftertreatment with a combination of resorcinol 1 % and diethylene glycol 4 %. The other is the combination of resorcinol 1 % and boric acid 6 %. For both these aftertreatments, ammonium acetate 0. 5 % is used as a catalyst. Fabric is padded with the solution and then dried at 130 ̊ C for 8 minutes. After drying, fabric is rinsed with water at 40 ̊ C. The aftertreatment methods developed in this research have shown a long term effect in keeping the formaldehyde release below 75 ppm during fabric storage that is not available with other conventional aftertreatment methods. These aftertreatment methods have no adverse effect on the flame retardancy of the THPC ammonia cured finished fabric and the fabric is soft as compared to the original <b>flame</b> <b>retardant</b> finished <b>fabric</b> and to the fabric after treated with existing methods.

40|$|The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has led in the {{development}} of unique <b>flame</b> <b>retardant</b> fibers for human spaceflight {{since the beginning of the}} Apollo program. After the Apollo 1 fire which killed Command Pilot Virgil I 'Gus' Grissom, Senior Pilot Edward H. White II, and Pilot Roger B. Chaffee from cardiac arrest on January 27, 1967, the accident investigators found severe third degree burns and melted spacesuits on the astronauts bodies. NASA immediately initiated an extensive research program aimed at developing <b>flame</b> <b>retardant</b> and <b>flame</b> resistant fibers for the enriched oxygen atmosphere of the Apollo crew cabin. Fibers are <b>flame</b> <b>retardant</b> when they have been modified by chemical and thermal treatments. Fibers are flame resistant when they are made of inherently flame resistant materials (i. e. glass, ceramic, highly aromatic polymers). Immediately after this tragic accident, NASA funded extensive research in specifically developing <b>flame</b> <b>retardant</b> fibers and <b>fabrics.</b> The early developmental efforts for human spaceflight were for the outer layer of the Apollo spacesuit. It was imperative that non-flammable fabrics be used in a 100 % oxygen environment. Owens-Corning thus developed the Beta fiber that was immediately used in the Apollo program and later in the Space Shuttle program. Aside from the urgent need for protective fabrics for the spacesuit, NASA also needed <b>flame</b> <b>retardant</b> <b>fabrics</b> for both clothing and equipment inside the spacecraft. From the mid- 1960 s to the early 1980 's, NASA contracted with many companies to develop inherently <b>flame</b> <b>retardant</b> fibers and <b>flame</b> <b>retardant</b> finishes for existing fibers. Fluorocarbons and aromatic polyamides were the polymers of great interest for {{the development}} of new inherently <b>flame</b> <b>retardant</b> fibers for enriched oxygen environments. These enriched environments varied for different space programs. For example, the Apollo program requirements were for materials that would not support combustion in a 70 %/ 30 % oxygen/nitrogen environment at 6. 3 pounds per square inch (psi). The Skylab program flammability requirements were set at 80 %/ 20 % oxygen/nitrogen ratios at 5 psi. While many fibers produced under several NASA contracts were never used, a few have become commercial products. The intent of this paper is to present the developmental history of some of these new or modified textile fibers. These developmental efforts are presented at various levels of details depending on the source of the historical records...|$|R

Due {{to the complexity}} of the composition of laboratory and com-mercial samples, in which along with N-methylol- 3 -dimethoxyphosphoryl-propionamide are N-methoxymethyl- 3 -dimethoxyphosphorylpropionamide, N N’-oxydimethylenebis(3 -dimethoxyphosphorylpropionamide) and 3 -dimeth-oxyphosphorylpropionamide, various chemical reactions proceed in the aging of these samples. The main path of conversion is transformations of the compo-nents to each other. From them, the formation of N,N’-oxydimethylenebis(3 -di-methoxyphosphorylpropionamide) and-methoxymethyl- 3 -dimethoxyphos-phorylpropionamide from-methylol- 3 -dimethoxyphosphorylpropionamide should be noted.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to produce {{environmentally}} safe flame-proofing compositions to give a wash-durable finish on textile and other substrates. Thus this work describes the preparation and application of new urea condensates formed from the reaction of urea {{with a variety of}} chemicals including phosphoric acid, phosphorous acid and sulphamic acid; the condensates gave different degrees of flame retardancy (FR) on a variety of substrates. Studies of urea thermal decomposition showed the production of isocyanic acid and ammonia, above "the urea melting point (l 3 S•C). Using an open reaction vessel, urea, sulphamic acid and phosphorous acid gave an exothermic reaction over the temperature range 120 - 140 'C with gas liberation. The condensates thus formed contained aliphatic polyamide chains, containing urea groups and sulphur and phosphorus residues. According to the type and amount of initial materials, various urea condensates, capable of imparting different degrees of flame retardancy, were synthesized. The sulphamic acid/urea (SIU), phosphoric acid /urea (P AIU), sulphamic acid/phosphoric acid/urea (SJPAIU) and also sulphamic acid/phosphorous acid/urea (S/PH/U) condensates were produced. When these urea condensates were cooled down, Water-soluble products were produced, and these materials could be applied to the textile substrate using a pad-bake technique. Cotton fabrics were treated with these condensates: typically a pad-liquor contained 500 g/l of urea condensate, 10 g/I of wetting agent; fabric was padded to 80 % wet pick-up, dried (80 'C) and cured for two minutes (l 65 'C). These urea condensates, when cured on cotton at high temperature (16 S'C), change to water-insoluble products; as a result of reactions between cellulose hydroxyl group and the urea condensate a complicated polymer structure network can be produced on the surface of a <b>fabric</b> and a <b>flame</b> <b>retardant</b> effect imparted. The SIU condensate only produced partial FR properties, {{while the rest of the}} compounds produced completely <b>flame</b> <b>retardant</b> <b>fabrics.</b> FT-IR analysis and NMR analysis was carried out on the urea condensates and also on the <b>flame</b> <b>retardant</b> <b>fabrics.</b> DSC thermal analysis was performed on the initial materials, urea condensates and also the treated fabrics. The characterization of urea condensate treated fabrics were studied further using SEM and energy dispersion X-ray micro analysis. In the case of the urea condensates a small amount of sulphamic acid has a significant influence on the reaction between phosphating agents and urea; in fact the presence of SA reduces the exothennic reaction. However, at high concentrations of urea, the exothermic reaction occurred at a higher temperature and a hard crystalline product was produced, thus application required dissolution in warm water (50 •C). A urea condensate of 1 mole sulphamic acid, 1 mole phosphorus acid and up to 18 moles of urea could produce a durable <b>flame</b> <b>retardant</b> finish on cotton fabric. A higher amount of phosphorous acid in the urea ~ondensate products (IS/ 2 PH/IOU) reduced the exotherm temperature and a high quality <b>flame</b> <b>retardant</b> effect was produced on cotton fabric. The evenness of phosphorus and sulphur elemental distribution on the surface and cross section of treated fibre was confirmed using SEM. Desirable flame retardancy effects from the urea condensate treated fabrics were obtained with comparatively low levels of sulphur and phosphorus (in comparison with the current commercially available Proban and Pyrovatex treated fabrics). However, in the washing process of the condensate-treated fabr ics, no significant reduction in P or S concentration/level was found. The excellent flame retardancy of the new system can be explained due to the N/P/S containing polymer formed on the surface of the fabric. DSC results from the treated fabrics confirmed these observations. Fabrics treated with Pro ban and Pyrovatex showed a very sharp exotherm after 300 'C, but for fabrics treated with the urea condensates only a small exotherm effect appeared. In FT-IR analysis and NMR analysis, the production of aliphatic polymer chains of different length was verified, however, for the insoluble product formed in situ by heating at 160 'C, and also for the condensates formed on the fabric at high temperature, a complicated polymer structure was shown to contain a possible combination of cyanuric acid, cyclic urea, triazine and melamine. All these materials have been identified in the FT-IR spectra of a water- insoluble urea product formed at 160 •C. To make a model reaction with other hydroxyl group-containing substrates, starch and polyvinyl alcohol were treated with the ISI 2 PH/IOU condensate. The flame retardancy effect on both these treated substrates was confirmed by DSC thermal analysis. Advantages of this new wash-durable FR system over the currently available Proban/Pyrovatex systems include: no formaldehyde, low cost, ready availability of materials, simplicity of the treatment (no specific equipment required), and maintenance of all the desirable physical properties of the fabric, such as soft handle, acceptable tensile strength, no effect on dyed grounds and also no yellowing of the fabric.

Print cloth and twill fabrics were treated with CN- 3 to achieve different levels of add-on (7 – 22 wt% add-ons for print cloth and 3 – 18 wt% add-ons for twill). Thermogravimetric analysis, vertical flame test, and limiting oxygen index (LOI) were performed on the treated cotton fabrics and showed promising results. When the treated print cloth and twill fabric samples were tested using the vertical flame test (ASTM D 6413 - 08), we observed that the ignited fabrics self-extinguished and left behind a streak of char.

In recent years, organophosphate <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> were used as substitutes for Brominated <b>Flame</b> <b>Retardants.</b> The consume amounts of organophosphate <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> in 2001 was about 5 times than that of 2000 in Japan. Recently, several studies have shown the carcinogenicity and neurotoxicity of organophosphate <b>flame</b> <b>retardants.</b> Reducing the risk of fire is the main advantage of using organophosphate <b>flame</b> <b>retardants.</b> However, there are possible health risks from the toxicity of organophosphate <b>flame</b> <b>retardants.</b> Health and fire risk assessment methods of organophosphate <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> were established in this study. Optimum additive level of <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> was proposed by comparing the two kinds of risks. The method was applied to estimate the optimum additive level of TCPP in wall covering materials. Practicality of the risk minimization approach was proved. However, because it is an interdisciplinary study, there are some problems such as data deficiency etc. Accuracy of the risk assessment method should be promoted in the further study...|$|R
