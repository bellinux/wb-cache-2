The {{present study}} aimed to {{evaluate}} the effi-cacy of <b>krypton</b> <b>laser</b> photodynamic therapy (PDT) with PsD- 007 {{for the treatment of}} oral mucosa dysplasia in 9, 10 -dimethyl- 1, 2 -benzanthracene (DMBA) -treated hamsters. A DMBA-induced hamster cheek pouch model of precan-cerous lesions was created and the resultant 25 hamsters were divided into five groups. The right side was treated with PDT and the left side was used as the positive control. Following systemic anesthesia, an incision was made in the groin area to expose the femoral vein. PsD- 007 was administered intravenously through the femoral vein. Various doses of photosensitizer were used to treat groups A‑E. Subsequent to closing the incision, {{the right side of the}} buccal mucosa was irradiated with light using the <b>krypton</b> <b>laser</b> at a wavelength of 413 nm, a power density of 150 mW/cm 2 and an irradiation time of 20 min. At six weeks post‑surgery, the response was analyzed using histological examinations of the buccal pouch mucosa. A total of 24 hamsters completed the six-week obser-vation period, as one hamster from group C died in the second week following the PDT. Of all 24 irradiated sides, 15 formed normal mucosal tissues and nine demonstrated mild dysplasia. Of the total control sides, six developed moderate dysplasia, five developed severe dysplasia and 13 progressed to carcinoma in situ or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).

40|$|AIMS—To {{investigate}} the longevity and reproducibility of choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) induced by <b>krypton</b> <b>laser</b> photocoagulation in the rat. The presence of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) {{during the development}} of CNV was also studied.  METHODS— 67 pigmented rats underwent retinal photocoagulation by <b>krypton</b> <b>laser.</b> The eyes were examined by either single or serial fluorescein angiography at 3  days, 1,  2 - 3, 4 - 5, 7 - 8, and 12  weeks post photocoagulation. The expression of CAMs (ICAM- 1, E-selectin, and CD 44) and VEGF post photocoagulation was studied by immunohistochemistry.  RESULTS—CNV related fluorescein leakage appeared in 46. 4 % of 766  laser spots delivered to the 58  eyes that were tested at 2 - 3 weeks post treatment. The ratio of hyperfluorescent laser sites did not change significantly at 8  weeks post laser. The number of leaky spots was independent {{of the total number}} of lesions delivered to each eye (at 2 - 3 weeks post laser 10 - 15 spots/eye: 44 % and 25 - 30 spots/eye: 49 %; t= 0. 7673; p= 0. 3903). Nine eyes were followed by serial angiography between 2  and 12  weeks. The laser spots with fluorescein leakage at 2  weeks (51. 5 %) remained leaky at 12  weeks (51. 5 %). Histopathologically, macrophage accumulation peaked at 5  days and CNV was firstly observed at 1  week post photocoagulation. ICAM- 1, E-selectin, CD 44, and VEGF were maximally induced at 3 - 5 days post laser photocoagulation, and were localised to RPE, choroidal vascular endothelial, and inflammatory cells. VEGF was also detected in intravascular leucocytes at the sites of laser lesions.  CONCLUSIONS—These studies demonstrated that <b>krypton</b> <b>laser</b> photocoagulation can be successfully used to produce lesions similar to those of human CNV. The response induced remained present for an extended period of time (12  weeks), thus offering a potential model to screen candidate CNV inhibitory agents. In addition, it is proposed that the expression of ICAM- 1, E-selectin, CD 44, and VEGF before new vessel formation might be linked to the initiation of CNV.    Keywords: choroidal neovascularisation; cell adhesion molecules; vascular endothelial growth facto...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze the retina and choroid {{response}} following <b>krypton</b> <b>laser</b> photocoagulation. Ninety-two C 57 BL 6 /Sev 129 and 32 C 57 BL/ 6 J, 5 - 6 -week-old mice received one single krypton (630 nm) laser lesion: 50 microm, 0. 05 s, 400 mW. On the following day, every day thereafter for 1 week and every 2 - 3 days for the following 3 weeks, serial sections throughout the lesion were systematically collected and studied. Immunohistology using specific markers or antibodies for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (astrocytes, glia and Muller's cells), von Willebrand (vW) (vascular endothelial cells), TUNEL (cells undergoing caspase dependent apoptosis), PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) p 36, CD 4 and F 4 / 80 (infiltrating inflammatory and T cells), DAPI (cell nuclei) and routine histology were carried out. Laser confocal microscopy was also performed on flat mounts. Temporal and spatial observations of the created photocoagulation lesions demonstrate that, after a few hours, activated glial cells within the retinal path of the laser beam express GFAP. After 48 h, GFAP-positive staining was also detected within the choroid lesion center. "Movement" of this GFAP-positive expression towards the lasered choroid was preceded by a well-demarcated and localized apoptosis of the retina outer nuclear layer cells within the laser beam path. Later, death of retinal outer nuclear cells and layer thinning at this site was followed by evagination of the inner nuclear retinal layer. Funneling of the entire inner nuclear and the thinned outer nuclear layers into the choroid lesion center was accompanied by "dragging" of the retinal capillaries. Thus, from days 10 to 14 after <b>krypton</b> <b>laser</b> photocoagulation onward, well-formed blood capillaries (of retinal origin) were observed within the lesion. Only a few of the vW-positive capillary endothelial cells stained also for PCNA p 36. In the choroid, dilatation of the vascular bed occurred at the vicinity of the photocoagulation site and around it. Confocal microscopy demonstrates that the vessels throughout the path lesion are located within the neuroretina while in the choroid (after separation of the neural retina) only GFAP-positive but no lectin-positive cells can be seen. The involvement of infiltrating inflammatory cells in these remodeling and healing processes remained minimal throughout the study period. During the 4 weeks following <b>krypton</b> <b>laser</b> photocoagulation in the mouse eye, processes of wound healing and remodeling appear to be driven by cells (and vessels) originating from the retina...|$|E
