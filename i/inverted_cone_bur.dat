40|$|A maxillary {{obturator}} for the edentulous patient {{must be as}} lightweight {{as possible}} and provide for retention, stability, patient comfort, and cleanliness. The weight of a maxillary obturator is often a dislocat-ing factor. Patients who have hollow obturators may complain of food, fluid, and mucous accumulations that result in bad odors and altered taste sensation. This tip describes a simple, quick technique for using an autopolymerizing resin to convert an existing hol-low obturator into a hollow bulb (Fig. 1). PROCEDURE 1. Use utility wax to fill in and shape the bulb por-tion of the obturator (Fig. 2). 2. Use impression plaster to fabricate a matrix of the obturator bulb (Fig. 3). 3. Remove the utility wax, and relieve the area where bonding with autopolymerizing resin will take place. Make dovetail groves with an <b>inverted</b> <b>cone</b> <b>bur</b> for added retention. Wet the obturator area with fresh monomer. 4. Place mixed autopolymerizing acrylic resin into the matrix, making sure the acrylic touches and coats all surfaces of the matrix (Fig. 4). 5. Firmly place the prosthesis into the matrix, keeping the lid side down. Allow ample time for it to cure with a rubber band wrapped firmly around the prosthesis and matrix (Fig. 5). Use the unused portion of the autopolymerizing acrylic as a gauge for determining when the acrylic has set. It is crucial that the obturator not be placed in warm water or a pressure pot during curing. Heat will cause the gas inside the bulb to expand and push through the seal, cre-ating a hole; a pressure pot will cause the gas to shrink, creating a suck-in defect that will disrupt the bulb’s seal. 6. On curing, remove the prosthesis and trim the flash. Pumish, polish, and deliver the prosthesi...|$|E
40|$|Three-dimensional {{heat and}} {{momentum}} transfer for the peaked, leveled, and <b>inverted</b> <b>cone</b> grain mass configurations in a corn silo was studied with aeration airflow rate ranged from 0. 26 to 0. 31 m³/min-t (0. 24 to 0. 28 cfm/bu) using the 3 D finite element stored grain ecosystem model. Non-uniform airflow models for peaked, leveled, and <b>inverted</b> <b>cone</b> grain mass configurations were developed using the finite volume method. Airflow resistance due to porous media of grain material was implemented using Ergun’s equation and a linear porosity variation with low porosity {{at the center}} and maximum at the side. The velocity profile and heat transfer during aeration were quantified for the peaked, leveled and <b>inverted</b> <b>cone</b> grain mass configurations. The change in grain temperature in the <b>inverted</b> <b>cone</b> grain mass configuration was the fastest followed by the leveled and peaked configurations. It took 102, 114, and 186 h, respectively, for cored, leveled, and peaked grain mass configurations to cool the grain from 40 °C to below 20 °C. For the peaked cone volume, the model predicted an 84 -h delay in the cooling front movement (or about 55 %) compared to the <b>inverted</b> <b>cone</b> configuration. This has significant implications with respect to fan run time hours, electricity consumption, {{and the potential for}} grain spoilage...|$|R

40|$|A tapered microstrip-fed printed <b>inverted</b> <b>cone</b> antenna with band-notched {{characteristics}} {{suitable for}} Ultra-Wideband (UWB) wireless systems is proposed. The antenna design {{consists of a}} semicircular slot embedded in a planar <b>inverted</b> <b>cone</b> as the radiating patch and a partial tapered ground plane. The proposed antennas are printed on a substrate of permittivity 4. 4 and operate over a wide impedance bandwidth from 2. 71 GHz to 16 GHz for VSWR 2 : 1.

50|$|In botany, an obconic is an <b>inverted</b> <b>cone</b> shape. The term is most {{frequently}} applied to certain fruit or hypanthium structures with the apical end {{attached to the}} stem; however, less frequently the usage may apply to the pistil structure. In the case of fungi the designation is often made to the ascospore. The use of obconic in botany dates to at least {{as early as the}} nineteenth century; however, some modern usage applies to an entire plant form, such as the shape of a whole shrub. More broadly, in geometry or design, the term can be assigned in an abstract manner to shapes in the natural or man-made world which show an <b>inverted</b> <b>cone</b> design.|$|R
