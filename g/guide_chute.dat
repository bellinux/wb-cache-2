50|$|Trebuchet: There {{are five}} major {{components}} of a trebuchet: beam, counterweight, frame, <b>guide</b> <b>chute,</b> and sling. After the counterweight drops from a platform on the frame, gravity pulls the counterweight and pivots the beam. Without the counterweight, the beam could not complete the arc that allows the sling to accurately release the projectile.|$|E

This adjusting mechanism was taken as research object, the distance between hinge axis {{and the center of}} blade connection seat, the distance between hinge axis and sliding limited post axis, the rotation angular velocity of cam ring and the angular velocity of blade rotating around hinge axis were taken as objective function, the diameter of fertilizer through-hole, the number of blades and the changing range of curvature radius of <b>guide</b> <b>chute</b> were taken as constraint conditions, the aided design and analysis software for fertilizer amount adjusting mechanism was programmed by VB software, through which kinematics optimization was carried out for fertilizer amount adjusting mechanism. The obtained optimal parameter ranges are: the radius of inner ring of cam is 30 mm, the number of blade is 6, the distance between the hinge axis and the center of blade connection seat is 47. 5 mm, the distance between hinge axis and sliding limited post axis is 12. 5 mm, the rotation angular velocity of cam ring is 25 - 35 r/min, the angular velocity of blade rotating around hinge axis is 30 - 35 r/min. According to optimization results, the fertilizer amount adjusting mechanism was simulated by Pro/E software, the simulation results were validated by experiment. The results show that the adjustable range of diameter of fertilizer through-hole for fertilizer amount adjusting mechanism is 9 - 56 mm, the sliding limited post of blade and the guiding chute of cam ring have good sliding performance, and the designed fertilizer amount adjusting mechanism can satisfy the expected design requirements...|$|E
40|$|A {{conceptual}} design {{study of the}} ARIM- 1 sounding rocket mission, whose goal is to study atmospheric turbulence in the tropopause region of the atmosphere, is presented. The study was conducted by an interdisciplinary team of students at the University of Alaska Fairbanks who were enrolled in a Space Systems Engineering course. The implementation of the ARIM- 1 mission {{will be carried out}} by students participating in the Alaska Student Rocket Program (ASRP), with a projected launch date of August 1997. The ARIM- 1 vehicle is a single stage sounding rocket with a 3 : 1 ogive nose cone, a payload diameter of 8 in., a motor diameter of 7. 6 in., and an overall height of 17. 0 ft including the four fins. Emphasis is placed on standardization of payload support systems. The thermosonde payload will measure the atmospheric turbulence by direct measurement of the temperature difference over a distance of one meter using two 3. 45 -micron 'hot-wire' probes. The recovery system consists of a 6 ft. diameter ribless <b>guide</b> surface drogue <b>chute</b> and a 33 ft. diameter main cross parachute designed to recover a payload of 31 pounds and slow its descent rate to 5 m/s through an altitude of 15 km. This document discusses the science objectives, mission analysis, payload mechanical configuration and structural design, recovery system, payload electronics, ground station, testing plans, and mission implementation...|$|R
