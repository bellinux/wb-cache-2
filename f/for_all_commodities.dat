60|$|There can never, it is said, be a want {{of buyers}} for all commodities; because whoever offers a {{commodity}} for sale, desires {{to obtain a}} commodity in exchange for it, and is therefore a buyer by the mere fact of his being a seller.

60|$|First, let us {{suppose that}} the {{quantity}} of commodities produced is not greater than the community {{would be glad to}} consume; is it, in that case, possible {{that there should be a}} deficiency of demand <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>commodities</b> for want of the means of payment? Those who think so can not have considered what it is which constitutes the means of payment for commodities. It is simply commodities. Each person’s means of paying for the productions of other people consists of those which he himself possesses. All sellers are inevitably and ex vi termini buyers. Could we suddenly double the productive powers of the country, we should double the supply of commodities in every market; but we should, by the same stroke, double the purchasing power.|$|E
60|$|It is, however, of {{the utmost}} {{importance}} to observe that excess of all commodities, in the only sense in which it is possible, means only a temporary fall in their value relatively to money. To suppose that the markets <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>commodities</b> could, in any other sense than this, be overstocked, involves the absurdity that commodities may fall in value relatively to themselves; or that, of two commodities, each can fall relatively to the other, A becoming equivalent to B-x, and B to A-x, at the same time. And it is, perhaps, a sufficient reason for not using phrases of this description, that they suggest the idea of excessive production. A want of market for one article may arise from excessive production of that article; but when commodities in general become unsaleable, it is from a very different cause; there cannot be excessive production of commodities in general.|$|E

40|$|The National Rail Administration is {{analysing}} {{how different}} levels and designs of freight rail user fees influence {{the demand for}} rail transport. Changes in demand are calculated {{with the help of}} price elasticities. These elasticities are mainly related to the total transport costs, where rail user fees are one part. The Swedish rail user fees (that include different components for wear and tear, safety etc.) are among the lowest in Europe and correspond to about five percent of the freight transport costs. In our literature review, we did not find studies explicitly related to elasticities for freight rail user fees. The elasticities that we found have transport costs (or prices) as independent variable and the majority has tonne-km as dependent variable. The elasticities lie in the range of - 0. 9 to - 1. 7. Regardless if one calculates the demand effect in tonnes, tonne-km or train-km in principle all elasticities in the literature are higher in absolute terms than 0. 4, which is the elasticity that the National Rail Administration applies today <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>commodity</b> groups and train types...|$|R
40|$|This paper valuates {{the price}} and income {{sensitivity}} of demand for consumer goods in rural households over the period 1971 to 2008 using the linear almost ideal demand system (LAIDS) and the iterative seemingly unrelated regressions (ISUR). The {{results of this study}} show that the based on the Marshalian price elasticity, the highest price sensitivity is in the transportation group and lowest price sensitivity is in the clothing group. The absolute value of price elasticity for clothing, food, health, furniture and housing groups is less than unit, in other words, this group of goods, are low elasticity goods, that is if their price change by a percent, the demand for that goods will change less than one percent. The sign of income elasticity is positive <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>commodity</b> groups which suggest that <b>all</b> <b>commodity</b> groups are normal goods for the rural consumers. In other words, if income increases, the demand for these commodity groups will be increased. The value of this elasticities shows that the three groups of food, shelter and health have less than unit income elasticity indicates that they are placed in the category of essential goods and income elasticity for the three groups of clothing, furniture and transportation is greater than unit indicates that they are placed in the category of luxury goods...|$|R

The functional principle does not limit {{the technology to}} any kind of segment or mineral application but makes the technical viability mainly depend on the liberation characteristics at the size range 25 - 100 mm, which is usually sorted. If physical liberation is present there is a good potential that one of the sensors available on industrial scale sorting machines can differentiate between valuable and non-valuable particles. The separation is based on features measured with a detection technology that are used to derive a yes/no decision for actuation of usually pneumatic impulses. Sensor-based sorting is a disruptive technology in the mining industry which is universally applicable <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>commodities.</b> A comprehensive study examines both the technology's potential and its limitations, whilst providing a framework for application development and evaluation.

50|$|Walras's law is ensured {{if every}} agent's budget {{constraint}} holds with equality. An agent's budget constraint is an equation {{stating that the}} total {{market value of the}} agent's planned expenditures, including saving for future consumption, must be {{less than or equal to}} the total market value of the agent's expected revenue, including sales of financial assets such as bonds or money. When an agent's budget constraint holds with equality, the agent neither plans to acquire goods for free (e.g., by stealing), nor does the agent plan to give away any goods for free. If every agent's budget constraint holds with equality, then the total market value of all agents' planned outlays <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>commodities</b> (including saving, which represents future purchases) must equal the total market value of all agents' planned sales of all commodities and assets. It follows that the market value of total value of excess demand in the economy must be zero, which is an the statement of Walras's law.
