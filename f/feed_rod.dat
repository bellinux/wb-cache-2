Due to the strong segregation problems as expected form the phase diagram already arose during preliminary runs.

As {{the main}} {{substrates}} materials for solar cell, Czochralskisilicon (CZ-Si) has more crystal defects, higher impurities content and so on, which limit the further improvement of conversion efficiency (η).

During FZ process, the resistivity is controlled by gas doping and the process is adjustable. CFZ-Si combines advantages of CZ-Si with FZ-Si. It has less crystal defects, lower impurities content especially oxygen content (< 0. 2 ppm) and excellent consistency of axial resistivity. Meanwhile, poly rod used has lower price and easier fabrication, so CFZ-Si cost is much lower and the further cost reduction is easy.

40|$|Commonly, {{germanium}} crystals {{are grown}} after the Czochralski (CZ) method. The crucible-free pedestal and floating zone (FZ) methods, which {{are widely used}} for silicon growth, are hardly known to be investigated for germanium. The germanium melt {{is more than twice}} as dense as liquid silicon, which could destabilize a floating zone. Additionally, the lower melting point and the related lower radiative heat loss is shown to reduce the stability especially of the FZ process with the consequence of a screw-like crystal growth. We found that the lower heat radiation of Ge can be compensated by the increased convective cooling of a helium atmosphere instead of the argon ambient. Under these conditions, the screw-like growth could be avoided. Unfortunately, the helium cooling deteriorates the melting behavior of the <b>feed</b> <b>rod.</b> Spikes appear along the open melt front, which touch on the induction coil. In order to improve the melting behavior, we used a lamp as a second energy source as well as a mixture of Ar and He. With this, we found a final solution for growing stable crystals from germanium by using both gases {{in different parts of the}} furnace. The experimental work is accompanied by the simulation of the stationary temperature field. The commercially available software FEMAG-FZ is used for axisymmetric calculations. Another tool for process development is the lateral photo-voltage scanning (LPS), which can determine the shape of the solid-liquid phase boundary by analyzing the growth striations in a lateral cut of a grown crystal.

Simultaneous coating and sputtering stimulates high rates of diffusion and forms an interfacial region of graded composition responsible for good adhesion. To obtain such coatings on components far industrial applications, the design and construction Of an ion plater with a 24 " (O. 6 rn) diameter chamber were investigated and modifications of the electron beam gun were proposed. A 12 " (O. 3 m) diameter ion plater was designed and constructed. The equipment was used to develop surfaces for solar energy applications. The conditions to give extended surfaces by sputter etching were studied. Austenitic stainless steel was sputter etched at 20 and 30 mTorr working pressure and at 3, 4 and 5 kV. Uniform etching was achieved by redesigning the specimen holder to give a uniform electrostatic field over the surfaces of the specimens. Surface protrusions were observed after sputter etching. They were caused by the sputter process and were independent of grain boundaries, surface contaminants and inclusions. The sputtering rate of stainless steel was highly dependent on the background pressure which should be kept below 10 - 5 Torr. Sputter etching improved the performance of stainless steel used as a solar selective surface. A twofold improvement was achieved on sputter etching bright annealed stainless steel. However, there was only slight improvement after sputter etching stainless steel which had been mechanically polished to a mirror finish.

40|$|The {{present study}} is {{concerned}} with the single crystal growth of functional oxides by the floating zone technique using a four mirror image furnace. This thesis attempts to extend our knowledge of the subject by firstly studying the optical floating zone method as a technique in terms of the experimental growth parameters and then by performing crystal growth and characterization on a number of functional oxides such as rutile (TiO_ 2), Co-doped rutile and rare earth orthoferrite crystals (RFeO_ 3, R=Er and Y). When growing high quality, large and homogeneous crystals using an image furnace, finding the optimum growth parameters (such as growth speed, rotation rate, gas pressure and type of atmosphere) is a crucial first step since it has been found that these parameters can all affect the eventual crystal quality and properties. Comprehensive characterization of an image furnace revealed that the growth behaviour, and consequently, the quality of the as-grown crystal, {{can be explained by the}} effects that varying these growth parameters have upon the temperature profiles within growing crystals. Characterization of as-grown crystals has been performed using a combination of different techniques such as scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive x-ray analysis, x-ray diffractometry, back reflection x-ray Laue, polarised optical microscopy and vibrating sample magnetometry. The best quality TiO_ 2 crystals were prepared when neither the growing crystal nor the <b>feed</b> <b>rod</b> were rotated during crystal growth. When rotation was employed, this was found to introduce sub-grain boundaries in crystals when the linear growth rate was low, or bubble inclusions when the linear rate was high. The use of lower molten zone temperatures was found to give pale-yellow crystals, while crystals grown using higher molten zone temperatures tended to have the blue colour characteristic of oxygen deficient material. A study of Co-doped TiO_ 2 single crystals, prepared from the melt using the FZ technique, revealed that Co does not dissolve into the rutile matrix and that the type of atmosphere used during FZ affects the type of cobalt-based second phases formed. Magnetization measurements of Co-doped rutile bulk samples (both single crystals prepared using the FZ technique and polycrystalline powders prepared using a solid state reaction) also indicated that the magnetic properties depend upon the material preparation conditions. An oxygen deficient environment during the preparation of Co-doped TiO_ 2 powders and single crystals was crucial for the observation of room temperature ferromagnetism, since preparation in oxygen rich conditions led to the formation of paramagnetic material that included the second phase CoTiO_ 3. Finally, growth of ErFeO_ 3 and YFeO_ 3 single crystals by the FZ technique revealed that the best quality crystals were prepared when the growth rate was 6 mm/h or less, since the use of higher growth rates (12, 18 and 24 mm/h) was found to result in the formation of second phase inclusions within the crystals. The magnetic properties of these crystals, as represented by the hysteresis loops, showed that crystals of both materials grown at higher rates have significantly lower coercivities; this was attributed to the effect of the second phase in nucleating reverse magnetic domains and so aiding the demagnetization process.

40|$|AbstractThe {{identification}} {{and understanding of}} material properties influencing the float zone process is important to crystallize high purity silicon for high efficiency solar cells. Also the knowledge of minimal requirements to crystallize monocrystalline silicon with the float zone process is of interest from an economic point of view. In the present study, <b>feed</b> <b>rods</b> for the float zone process composed of a central slim rod and the deposited silicon from the Siemens process are investigated. Previous {{studies have shown that}} the slim rod has a significant impact on the purity and suitability for further crystallization processes. In particular, contaminations like substitutional carbon and the presence of precipitates as well as the formation of oxide layers play an important role and are investigated in detail. For this purpose different slim rod materials were used in deposition and float zone crystallization experiments. Samples were prepared by cross sectioning and core drilling of Siemens rods, which were recrystallized with the float zone process. Recrystallized drilled cores are analyzed with FT-IR spectrometry concerning the carbon and oxygen content. To estimate the grain growth behavior on the slim rod surface in dependence of the used slim rod material, EBSD mappings inside a SEM are performed on squared and circular slim rods. TEM analysis was used to investigate the presence of an oxide layer at the interface between slim rod and deposited polycrystalline silicon. Additionally the influence of a nitrogen-containing gas atmosphere during the slim rod pulling is investigated by IR microscopy and ToF-SIMS regarding Si 3 N 4 precipitation...|$|R
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the progress {{made on the}} project ``Growth of High {Tc} Superconducting Fibers Using a Miniaturized Laser-Heated Float Zone Process`` during the 14 month period from Nov. 6, 1990 to Dec. 31, 1991. The studies during this period focused primarily on phase diagram studies, phase relations in the calcium aluminate system and on Bi{sub 2 }Sr{sub 2 }CaCu{sub 2 }O{sub 8 } (BSCCO). Some work was also done on the Advanced Fiber Growing Station. Because of the complicated phase relationships found in the incongruently melting BSCCO system, the incongruently melting CA{sub 3 }Al{sub 2 }O{sub 6 } phase of the calcium oxide-aluminum oxide system was studied as a model material. The data obtained was in agreement with well known solidification theory. Fibers grown from calcium oxide rich sources contained calcium oxide nodules which transported from the melting source interface to the growth interface, while those grown from aluminum oxide rich sources contained continuous inclusions of a divorced eutectic. The melt compositions were also found to follow theoretical predictions. The agreement of this data with the phase diagram and solidification theory demonstrates that phase equilibrium information can be extracted from fiber growth experiments. BSCCO <b>feed</b> <b>rods</b> were made from 12 different compositions. Fibers were grown from these rods and the melts were abruptly quenched which preserves the as-grown 2212 fiber, a glassy frozen melt and the source. A future study of these sections will reveal the phase relationships {{that exist in the}} BSCCO system. Melt temperature gradients of 500 [...] 1, 000 C/cm were measured near the interface in these experiments. During this reporting period, work continued on the mechanical components of the Advanced Fiber Growth Station...|$|R
40|$|The {{mammalian}} retina provides several {{pathways to}} relay {{the information from}} the photoreceptors to the ganglion cells. Cones feed into ON and OFF cone bipolar cells that excite ON and OFF ganglion cells, respectively. In the "classical" <b>rod</b> pathway, <b>rods</b> <b>feed</b> into <b>rod</b> bipolar cells that provide input to both the ON and the OFF pathway via AII amacrine cells. Recent evidence suggests an alternative rod pathway in which rods directly contact some types of OFF cone bipolar cells. The mouse has become an important model system for retinal research. We performed an immunohistochemical analysis on the level of light and electron microscopy to identify the bipolar cells and ganglion cells that are involved in the alternative rod pathway of the mouse retina. 1) We identify a new bipolar cell type, showing that type 3 OFF cone bipolar cells comprise two distinct cell types, that we termed 3 a and 3 b. Type 3 a cells express the ion channel HCN 4. Type 3 b bipolar cells represent a hitherto unknown cell type that can be identified with antibodies against the regulatory subunit RIIbeta of protein kinase A. 2) We show that both 3 a and 3 b cells form flat contacts at cone pedicles and rod spherules. 3) Finally, we identify an OFF ganglion cell type whose dendrites costratify with type 3 a and 3 b bipolar cell axon terminals. These newly identified cell types represent the basis of a neuronal circuit in the mammalian retina that could provide for an alternative fast rod pathway...|$|R
