25|$|The {{subscription}} {{approach was}} the prevailing business model {{until the early}} 1970s, when Moody's, Fitch, and finally Standard & Poor's adopted the issuer-pays model. Several factors contributed to this transition, including increased investor demand for credit ratings, and widespread use of information sharing technology—such as fax machines and photocopiers—which allowed investors to freely share agencies’ reports and undermined demand for subscriptions. Today, eight of the nine nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (NRSRO) use the issuer-pays model, only Egan-Jones maintains an investor subscription service. Smaller, regional credit rating agencies may use either model. For example, China's oldest rating agency, Chengxin Credit Management Co., uses the issuer-pays model. The Universal Credit Ratings Group, formed by Beijing-based Dagong <b>Global</b> <b>Credit</b> Rating, Egan-Jones of the U.S. and Russia’s RusRatings, uses the investor-pays model, while Dagong Europe Credit Rating, the other joint-venture of Dagong <b>Global</b> <b>Credit</b> Rating, uses the issuer-pays model.|$|E
25|$|In March 2008, Carlyle Capital Corporation, {{established}} in August 2006 {{for the purpose}} of making investments in U.S. mortgage-backed securities, defaulted on about $16.6 billion of debt as the <b>global</b> <b>credit</b> crunch brought about by the subprime mortgage crisis worsened for leveraged investors. The Guernsey-based affiliate of Carlyle was very heavily leveraged, up to 32 times by some accounts, and it expects its creditors to seize its remaining assets. Tremors in the mortgage markets induced several of Carlyle's 13 lenders to make margin calls or to declare Carlyle in default on its loans. In response to the forced liquidation of mortgage-backed assets caused by the Carlyle margin calls and other similar developments in credit markets, on March 11, 2008, the Federal Reserve gave Wall Street's primary dealers the right to post mortgaged-back securities as collateral for loans of up to $200 billion in higher-grade, U.S. government-backed securities.|$|E

2500|$|Despite the <b>global</b> <b>credit</b> crisis, {{automobile}} {{sales and}} the real-estate sector {{continued to grow}} in Bihar. Auto sales grew by 45% to 1,33,000 in the last 11 months of 2008, against 92,147 sold in 2007. Due to the <b>global</b> <b>credit</b> crunch, many Indian states have reported a decline of 20-25 percent in the automobile sales. Deputy Bihar Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi said [...] "The rise in sales figure of vehicles in the state {{at the rate of}} 45 percent shows that the recession has not affected the sector at all in the state". November 2008 reported 19,729 vehicle sales in different categories, whereas 15,326 vehicles were sold in the same period of the prior year. The revenue collection department in Bihar has registered a growth of 28.02 per cent in revenue collection until November 2008. The department collected Rs 192.01 crore in 2008 against Rs 149.99 crore in 2007. Also the real-estate sector earned Rs 37 crore in revenue from flat registrations in October and November 2008 alone. Altogether 3,139 flats were registered, which indicates there is good cash flow. The real estate sector has been badly hit by the global recession in other parts of India, which have compelled the builders to slash rates and offer attractive packages to push through their sales. The small industrial base, brought on by political mis-management in the 1990s, the small-scale nature of the loans sector, and that employment is generally with public sector, or semi government owned businesses, are all key factors in Bihar avoiding the recession. The service sector, which is the other large employer, is not as mature as other Indian states and caters for a large market. Modi added that the rate of real estate properties had increased tremendously since it was the middle-class population who dominated the state. Another factor was that a huge number of development projects had been launched in Bihar since the NDA government came to power in 2005, which had drawn many construction companies, builders and suppliers. In 2008 alone, the state government was investing Rs 13,500 crore (135 billion Rupees) on development projects.|$|E
