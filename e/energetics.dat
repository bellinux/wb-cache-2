The payload was managed by Goddard Space Flight Center's Special Payloads Division. The GPP studied the Earth's thermosphere, ionosphere and mesosphere <b>energetics</b> and dynamics using broadband spectroscopy. GPP also studied spacecraft interactions with the atmosphere by observing shuttle and Mir glow, shuttle engine firings, water dumps and fuel cell purges.|$|E
5|$|When {{originally}} {{conceived by}} Nuckols, laser-driven inertial fusion confinement {{was expected to}} require lasers {{of a few hundred}} kilojoules and use fuel droplets created by a perfume mister arrangement. LLNLs research since that time has demonstrated that such an arrangement cannot work, and requires machined assemblies for each shot. To be economically useful, an IFE machine would need to use fuel assemblies that cost pennies. Although LLNL does not release prices for their own targets, the similar system at the Laboratory for Laser <b>Energetics</b> at the University of Rochester makes targets for about $1 million each. It is suggested that NIF's targets cost more than $10,000.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} {{naturally}} occurring isotope of hydrogen, known as protium, {{has a single}} proton and no neutrons. In ionic compounds, it can take on either a positive charge, becoming a cation composed of a bare proton, or a negative charge, becoming an anion known as a hydride. Hydrogen can form compounds with most elements and is present in water and most organic compounds. It plays a particularly important role in acid-base chemistry, in which many reactions involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules. As the only neutral atom for which the Schrödinger equation can be solved analytically, study of the <b>energetics</b> and spectrum of the hydrogen atom has {{played a key role}} in the development of quantum mechanics.|$|E
5|$|The {{universal}} {{emergence of}} atomic hydrogen first {{occurred during the}} recombination epoch. At standard temperature and pressure, hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, nonmetallic, highly combustible diatomic gas with the molecular formula H2. Since hydrogen readily forms covalent compounds with most nonmetallic elements, most of the hydrogen on Earth exists in molecular forms such as water or organic compounds. Hydrogen plays a particularly important role in acid–base reactions because most acid-base reactions involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules. In ionic compounds, hydrogen can {{take the form of}} a negative charge (i.e., anion) when it is known as a hydride, or as a positively charged (i.e., cation) species denoted by the symbol H+. The hydrogen cation is written as though composed of a bare proton, but in reality, hydrogen cations in ionic compounds are always more complex. As the only neutral atom for which the Schrödinger equation can be solved analytically, study of the <b>energetics</b> and bonding of the hydrogen atom has played a key role in the development of quantum mechanics.|$|E

25|$|Fast ignition: This method uses two laser blasts. The first blast {{compresses}} {{the fusion}} fuel, {{while the second}} high energy pulse ignites it. Experiments have been conducted at the Laboratory for Laser <b>Energetics</b> using the Omega and Omega EP systems and at the GEKKO XII laser at the Institute for Laser Engineering in Osaka Japan.|$|E
25|$|<b>Energetics</b> is {{important}} for explaining the evolution of foraging economic decisions in organisms; for example, {{a study of the}} African honey bee, A. m. scutellata, has shown that honey bees may trade-off the high sucrose content of viscous nectar for the energetic benefits of warmer, less concentrated nectar, which also reduces their consumption and flight time.|$|E
25|$|Exergy {{analysis}} is {{performed in the}} field of industrial ecology to use energy more efficiently. The term exergy, was coined by Zoran Rant in 1956, but the concept was developed by J. Willard Gibbs. In recent decades, utilization of exergy has spread outside of physics and engineering to the fields of industrial ecology, ecological economics, systems ecology, and <b>energetics.</b>|$|E
25|$|Results {{can also}} depend heavily on sample {{preparation}} {{and how it}} was run/introduced. An important example is the issue of which matrix is used for MALDI spotting, since much of the <b>energetics</b> of the desorption/ionization event is controlled by the matrix rather than the laser power. Sometimes samples are spiked with sodium or another ion-carrying species to produce adducts rather than a protonated species.|$|E
25|$|The {{intricacies of}} {{schooling}} {{are far from}} fully understood, especially the swimming and feeding <b>energetics.</b> Many hypotheses to explain the function of schooling have been suggested, such as better orientation, synchronized hunting, predator confusion and reduced risk of being found. Schooling also has disadvantages, such as excretion buildup in the breathing media and oxygen and food depletion. The way the fish array in the school probably gives energy saving advantages, though this is controversial.|$|E
25|$|Direct drive: In this technique, lasers {{directly}} blast a pellet of fuel. The goal is {{to ignite}} a fusion chain reaction. Ignition was first suggested by John Nuckolls, in 1972. Notable direct drive experiments have been conducted at the Laboratory for Laser <b>Energetics,</b> Laser Mégajoule and the GEKKO XII facilities. Good implosions require fuel pellets with close to a perfect shape in order to generate a symmetrical inward shock wave that produces the high-density plasma.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the role}} of inter-domain {{interactions}} in protein folding and in <b>energetics</b> of stabilisation of the native structure, probably differs for each protein. In T4 lysozyme, the influence of one domain on the other {{is so strong that}} the entire molecule is resistant to proteolytic cleavage. In this case, folding is a sequential process where the C-terminal domain is required to fold independently in an early step, and the other domain requires the presence of the folded C-terminal domain for folding and stabilisation.|$|E
25|$|The harsh {{environment}} in which the southern hairy-nosed wombat lives is further reflected in its <b>energetics.</b> In captivity, their standard metabolic rate was found to be 130 kl/kg^0.75 per day, which is very low compared to most placental animals and other marsupials. They also have the lowest thyroid hormone levels among mammals. The food wombats eat provides more than enough energy. As long as enough food is available, the forage consumed by the wombat can support it during late lactation. It is more effective than a donkey at maintaining its weight on low-quality food.|$|E
25|$|Sidewinders have an {{extraordinarily}} accelerated lifecycle, with natural life expectancies of females {{of about five}} years. Males may live quite a bit longer (maximum known natural lifespan of 13 years). Sidewinders can live more than 20 years when well fed in captivity (even females). Thus, <b>energetics</b> apparently factor heavily into natural female mortality, whereas predation might be the primary pressure on males. In the wild, females often die of exhaustion after giving birth, but the lives of sidewinders are also cut short by predation, diseases, and vehicle encounters.|$|E
25|$|Thermal {{cracking}} was {{the first}} category of hydrocarbon cracking to be developed. Thermal cracking {{is an example of}} a reaction whose <b>energetics</b> are dominated by entropy (∆S°) rather than by enthalpy (∆H°) in the Gibbs Free Energy equation ∆G°=∆H°-T∆S°. Although the bond dissociation energy D for a carbon-carbon single bond is relatively high (about 375 kJ/mol) and cracking is highly endothermic, the large positive entropy change resulting from the fragmentation of one large molecule into several smaller pieces, together with the extremely high temperature, makes T∆S° term larger than the ∆H° term, thereby favoring the cracking reaction.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to mixing, the substances {{in a solution}} {{interact with each other}} at the molecular level. When something is dissolved, molecules of the solvent arrange around molecules of the solute. Heat transfer is involved and entropy is increased making the solution more thermodynamically stable than the solute and solvent separately. This arrangement is mediated by the respective chemical properties of the solvent and solute, such as hydrogen bonding, dipole moment and polarizability. Solvation does not cause a chemical reaction or chemical configuration changes in the solute. However, solvation resembles a coordination complex formation reaction, often with considerable <b>energetics</b> (heat of solvation and entropy of solvation) and is thus far from a neutral process.|$|E
25|$|Systems ecology {{can be seen}} as an {{application}} of general systems theory to ecology. It takes a holistic and interdisciplinary approach to the study of ecological systems, and particularly ecosystems. Systems ecology is especially concerned with the way the functioning of ecosystems can be influenced by human interventions. Like other fields in theoretical ecology, it uses and extends concepts from thermodynamics and develops other macroscopic descriptions of complex systems. It also takes account of the energy flows through the different trophic levels in the ecological networks. In systems ecology the principles of ecosystem energy flows are considered formally analogous to the principles of <b>energetics.</b> Systems ecology also considers the external influence of ecological economics, which usually is not otherwise considered in ecosystem ecology. For the most part, systems ecology is a subfield of ecosystem ecology.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, a major {{article was}} {{published}} in Physics Today by Robert McCory at the Laboratory for laser <b>energetics</b> outlying {{the current state of}} ICF and advocating for a national ignition facility. This was followed up by a major review article, from John Lindl in 1995, advocating for NIF. During this time a number of ICF subsystems were developing, including target manufacturing, cryogenic handling systems, new laser designs (notably the NIKE laser at NRL) and improved diagnostics like time of flight analyzers and Thomson scattering. This work was done at the NOVA laser system, General Atomics, Laser Mégajoule and the GEKKO XII system in Japan. Through this work and lobbying by groups like the fusion power associates and John Sethian at NRL, a vote was made in congress, authorizing funding for the NIF project in the late nineties.|$|E
25|$|Boltzmann spent a {{great deal}} of effort in his final years {{defending}} his theories. He did not get along with some of his colleagues in Vienna, particularly Ernst Mach, who became a professor of philosophy and history of sciences in 1895. That same year Georg Helm and Wilhelm Ostwald presented their position on <b>Energetics</b> at a meeting in Lübeck. They saw energy, and not matter, as the chief component of the universe. Boltzmann's position carried the day among other physicists who supported his atomic theories in the debate. In 1900, Boltzmann went to the University of Leipzig, on the invitation of Wilhelm Ostwald. After the retirement of Mach due to bad health, Boltzmann returned to Vienna in 1902. In 1903 he founded the Austrian Mathematical Society together with Gustav von Escherich and Emil Müller. His students included Karl Przibram, Paul Ehrenfest and Lise Meitner.|$|E
25|$|Chirped pulse {{amplification}} (CPA) is {{a technique}} for amplifying an ultrashort laser pulse up to the petawatt level with the laser pulse being stretched out temporally and spectrally prior to amplification. CPA is the current state-of-the-art technique which all of the highest power lasers (greater than about 100 terawatts, {{with the exception of}} the ~500 TW National Ignition Facility) in the world currently utilize. Some examples of these lasers are the Vulcan Petawatt Upgrade at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory's central laser facility, the Diocles Laser at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, the Gekko Petawatt laser at the Gekko XII facility in the Institute of Laser Engineering at Osaka University, the OMEGA EP laser at the University of Rochester's Lab for Laser <b>Energetics</b> and the now dismantled petawatt line on the former Nova laser at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Apart from these state-of-the-art research systems, a number of commercial manufacturers sell -based CPAs with peak powers of 10 to 100 gigawatts.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{polymeric}} mixtures are {{far less}} miscible than mixtures of small molecule materials. This effect results {{from the fact that}} the driving force for mixing is usually entropy, not interaction energy. In other words, miscible materials usually form a solution not because their interaction with each other is more favorable than their self-interaction, but because of an increase in entropy and hence free energy associated with increasing the amount of volume available to each component. This increase in entropy scales with the number of particles (or moles) being mixed. Since polymeric molecules are much larger and hence generally have much higher specific volumes than small molecules, the number of molecules involved in a polymeric mixture is far smaller than the number in a small molecule mixture of equal volume. The <b>energetics</b> of mixing, on the other hand, is comparable on a per volume basis for polymeric and small molecule mixtures. This tends to increase the free energy of mixing for polymer solutions and thus make solvation less favorable. Thus, concentrated solutions of polymers are far rarer than those of small molecules.|$|E
25|$|The {{so-called}} long-duration gamma-ray bursts {{produce a}} total energy output of about 1044 joules (as much energy as our Sun will produce in its entire life-time) {{but in a}} period of only 20 to 40 seconds. Gamma rays are approximately 50% of the total energy output. The leading hypotheses for the mechanism of production of these highest-known intensity beams of radiation, are inverse Compton scattering and synchrotron radiation from high-energy charged particles. These processes occur as relativistic charged particles leave the region of the event horizon of a newly formed black hole created during supernova explosion. The beam of particles moving at relativistic speeds are focused for a few tens of seconds by the magnetic field of the exploding hypernova. The fusion explosion of the hypernova drives the <b>energetics</b> of the process. If the narrowly directed beam happens to be pointed toward the Earth, it shines at gamma ray frequencies with such intensity, that it can be detected even at distances of up to 10 billion light years, which is close {{to the edge of the}} visible universe.|$|E
25|$|Herring {{are among}} the most {{spectacular}} schooling fish. They aggregate together in huge numbers. Schools have been measured at over four cubic kilometres in size, containing about four billion fish. These schools move along coastlines and traverse the open oceans. Herring schools in general have very precise arrangements which allow the school to maintain relatively constant cruising speeds. Herrings have excellent hearing, and their schools react very fast to a predator. The herrings keep a certain distance from a moving scuba diver or cruising predator like a killer whale, forming a vacuole which can look like a doughnut from a spotter plane. The intricacies of schooling is far from fully understood, especially the swimming and feeding <b>energetics.</b> Many hypotheses to explain the function of schooling have been suggested, such as better orientation, synchronized hunting, predator confusion and reduced risk of being found. Schooling also has disadvantages, such as excretion buildup in the breathing media and oxygen and food depletion.

25|$|Rochester is {{a leading}} private {{university}} and a major center for diverse fields of research. The university has eight Nobel Prize winners among its faculty and alumni. The university consistently ranks among the top 40 colleges and universities nationwide in federally financed science, engineering, medical, and other research, with a total research budget of around $395 million spread across many departments and research centers, including the Laboratory for Laser <b>Energetics,</b> a laser-based nuclear fusion facility, and the extensive research facilities at the University of Rochester Medical Center. Recently, the university has also engaged {{in a series of}} new initiatives to expand its programs in biomedical engineering and optics, including the construction of the new $37 million Robert B. Goergen Hall for Biomedical Engineering and Optics on the River Campus. Other new research initiatives include a cancer stem cell program and a Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute. UR also has the ninth highest technology revenue among U.S. higher education institutions, with $46 million being paid for commercial rights to university technology and research in 2009. Notable patents include Zoloft and Gardasil. WeBWorK, a web-based system for checking homework and providing immediate feedback for students, was developed by University of Rochester professors Gage and Pizer. The system is now in use at over 800 universities and colleges, as well as several secondary and primary schools. Rochester scientists work in diverse areas; for example, physicists developed a technique for etching metal surfaces, such as platinum, titanium and brass, with powerful lasers, enabling self-cleaning surfaces that repel water droplets and will not rust if tilted at a 4 degree angle; and medical researchers are exploring how brains rid themselves of toxic waste during sleep.|$|E
500|$|The {{three-dimensional}} {{wind field}} in a tropical cyclone can be separated into two components: a [...] "primary circulation" [...] and a [...] "secondary circulation". [...] The primary circulation is the rotational {{part of the}} flow; it is purely circular. The secondary circulation is the overturning (in-up-out-down) part of the flow; {{it is in the}} radial and vertical directions. The primary circulation is larger in magnitude, dominating the surface wind field, and is responsible {{for the majority of the}} damage a storm causes, while the secondary circulation is slower but governs the <b>energetics</b> of the storm.|$|E
500|$|In 1971, with Byungkook Lee, Richards {{introduced}} {{the concept and}} a quantitative measure for the solvent-accessible surface (SAS) of amino acid residues in folded protein structures (...) [...] The surface is constructed by tracing {{the center of an}} imaginary ball, its radius that of a water molecule (taken as 1.4Å), as it rolls over the van der Waals surfaces of the proteins. Thus defined, the surface is continuous and each point on it is unambiguously associated with a specific protein atom (the nearest). The Lee & Richards definition has been widely adopted as the standard measure for solvent accessibility, for instance to evaluate exposure per residue as a percentage of accessible vs total surface area, and as the basis of the buried-surface-area method for estimating the <b>energetics</b> of protein/protein contacts.|$|E
500|$|Type Ia supernovae {{derive their}} energy from a runaway nuclear fusion of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf. The {{details of the}} <b>energetics</b> are still not fully understood, but {{the end result is}} the {{ejection}} of the entire mass of the original star at high kinetic energy. [...] Around half a solar mass of that mass is 56Ni generated from silicon burning. [...] 56Ni is radioactive and decays into 56Co by beta plus decay (with a half life of six days) and gamma rays. [...] 56Co itself decays by the beta plus (positron) path with a half life of 77 days into stable 56Fe. [...] These two processes are responsible for the electromagnetic radiation from Type Ia supernovae. In combination with the changing transparency of the ejected material, they produce the rapidly declining light curve.|$|E
500|$|A {{tropical}} cyclone's {{primary energy}} source is heat from the evaporation {{of water from the}} ocean surface, which ultimately recondenses into clouds and rain when the warm moist air rises and cools to saturation. The <b>energetics</b> of the system may be idealized as an atmospheric Carnot heat engine. First, inflowing air near the surface acquires heat primarily via evaporation of water (i.e. latent heat) at the temperature of the warm ocean surface (during evaporation, the ocean cools and the air warms). Second, the warmed air rises and cools within the eyewall while conserving total heat content (latent heat is simply converted to sensible heat during condensation). Third, air outflows and loses heat via infrared radiation to space at the temperature of the cold tropopause. Finally, air subsides and warms at {{the outer edge of the}} storm while conserving total heat content. [...] The first and third legs are nearly isothermal, while the second and fourth legs are nearly isentropic. This in-up-out-down overturning flow is known as the secondary circulation. [...] The Carnot perspective provides an upper bound on the maximum wind speed that a storm can attain.|$|E
