In its next weekend at the box office, the film dropped to number 13 in the charts, only earning $1,836,177.

5|$|In Vagrant Story, the Iocus priesthood of {{the kingdom}} of Valendia is shown to use the Kildean rood as a symbol, {{although}} they follow the teachings of a saint named Iocus instead of the original Kildean teachings of the Kiltia religion of Leá Monde. Müllenkamp, founder of the city of Leá Monde featured in the story, used to be a priestess of Kiltia, and bore the rood on her back. The followers of St. Iocus are outwardly intolerant of magic, seeing it as an abomination, and yet its higher members continue to use <b>it</b> <b>behind</b> the scenes. This hypocrisy is revealed {{over the course of the}} story, though it goes unresolved.|$|E
5|$|It remains {{close to}} the Interstate Highway for about , {{intersecting}} NY237 {{less than a mile}} (1.6km) north of the overpass taking that highway over the Thruway, but leaves <b>it</b> <b>behind</b> for good shortly thereafter as it turns even more to the north, taking it into the town of Bergen and the small village of the same name in the county's northeast corner. Here, NY33 crosses NY19, a long north–south route. Shortly afterward, NY33A begins to the east while the main route turns to the north yet again and becomes Buffalo Road. Just east of this point, NY33A connects to I-490, which briefly runs along the Monroe County line through this area. From the west end of NY33A to the county line, NY33 and I-490 follow virtually identical northeasterly alignments.|$|E

5|$|Mr. Burns reveals to Smithers that {{he misses}} his {{cherished}} bear Bobo and desperately wants it back {{but has no}} idea where it is. Another flashback reveals Bobo's history: after Mr. Burns leaves <b>it</b> <b>behind,</b> the bear eventually finds its way to Charles Lindbergh, who tosses the bear into a crowd, where it is caught by Adolf Hitler. In 1945, Hitler blames Bobo for losing World War II and tosses him away. Bobo is seen again in 1957 on board the USS Nautilus headed for the North Pole. Bobo becomes encased in a block of ice until picked up by an ice-gathering expedition in 1993. The bag of ice with Bobo in it {{is sent to the}} Kwik-E-Mart in Springfield. Bart buys the bag of ice, finds Bobo inside and gives it to Maggie to play with.|$|E
5|$|The {{question}} {{who shot}} down Sayn-Wittgenstein is unanswered. Friedrich Ostheimer remained {{convinced that they}} were shot down by a long range intruder de Havilland Mosquito night fighter. However, no Mosquito pilot claimed an aerial victory that night. A closer analysis reveals that three Mosquitos, two Serrate-equipped aircraft from No. 141 Squadron RAF and one from No. 239 Squadron RAF, participated in the attacks on Magdeburg. Only one Mosquito had enemy contact: No. 141's squadron Mosquito F.II, DZ303, piloted by Pilot Officer Desmon Snape with Flying Officer L. Fowler as his radar operator reported radar contact at 23:15south of Brandenburg. After three to four minutes of pursuit they encountered a Ju 88with its position lights on. They attacked the Ju 88and believed to have damaged <b>it</b> <b>behind</b> its cockpit, {{but they did not}} claim a victory. This encounter exactly matches the time and area in which Sayn-Wittgenstein was killed.|$|E
5|$|The score {{remained}} unchanged {{until the second}} period. Montreal held the advantage in play {{for much of the}} frame, taking 21 shots on Miikka Kiprusoff. They earned their only power play opportunity of the game midway through the frame when Jay Bouwmeester was penalized for interference. The Flames had the better chances despite being shorthanded; Curtis Glencross was unable to deflect a pass into the net while rushing towards the Montreal goal, but fought to retrieve the puck and sent it back out front of the net, where Anton Babchuk snapped <b>it</b> <b>behind</b> Price to extend Calgary's lead to 2–0. Bourque made the score 3–0 with five minutes left in the period when he cut in front of Price from {{the left side of the}} ice and put the puck in before being sent airborne over the fallen goaltender's pads. The goal was the 100th of Bourque's career.|$|E

5|$|Queen's Park {{took the}} {{advantage}} {{early on in}} the second half, and a series of rapid attacks followed the break. The Scottish team were only prevented from scoring in one goal mouth scramble by the teamwork of Arthur and Suter. Rovers appeared to have switched to a defensive posture, and conceded a further corner kick, but nothing came of it as Gow kicked <b>it</b> <b>behind</b> the goal. A further handball just inside the Queen's Park half resulted in a solitary attack for Blackburn, ending in Brown sending the ball over the crossbar. Further attacks Queen's Park followed, but one further attack from Blackburn led to a shot from Brown which many in the crowd thought crossed the line before Gillespie cleared it. Blackburn dominated the final five minutes of the game, and the match ended 2–1; all three goals were scored in the first half. The medals and trophy had been expected to be awarded by Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, however due to his death on the day before the final, they were not presented publicly. Instead, Major Marindin handed them over in the dressing rooms.|$|E

5|$|The {{second season}} begins {{six weeks after}} the end of the first, where Magnus works hard to defeat the Cabal and save Ashley, whom the Cabal {{transformed}} to a vampire-hybrid superabnormal, one of six tasked to destroy the Sanctuary Network. When the superabnormals arrive at the Old City Sanctuary, Magnus is able to get through to Ashley, who recognises her in time to save her from another superabnormal, and then teleports. Because an electromagnetic field is active, it would mean whoever teleports inside would be vaporized. Despite this, Magnus believes Ashley's life energy may be in the electromagnetic field's buffer. When it does not, she is forced to accept that Ashley has died. Because of her death, and other loved ones because of her longevity, she tried to find a way to age at a normal rate again. She finds an elixir used by the Mayans in Honduras, but it has the side effect of turning humans into zombie-like creatures. After being shown the potential consequences of the elixir's release by an incorporeal guardian, she decides to leave <b>it</b> <b>behind.</b>|$|E

5|$|With {{no other}} choices left, Feige {{drew up a}} plan for another offensive. The thinly {{stretched}} forces of the 169th division had to split up {{to take over the}} defense line along the entire frontline between Kayrala and its adjacent lakes. The Finnish 6th Division would then be freed to undertake another massive flanking operation. Coming from the very south, they would circumvent the Soviet positions at Kayrala and thrust to a position east of <b>it</b> <b>behind</b> the Soviet lines at Lake Nurmi. The 169th Division would do the same, but from the north, resulting in a large pincer movement to trap the Soviets. At the beginning of August 1941 this plan was launched with the Finnish 6th Division heading the renewed drive of the XXXVI Corps with the 169th Division following. The plan met with unexpected success. The attack completely surprised the Soviets and a large firefight developed around Kayraly. The German-Finnish force was able to encircle large parts of the Soviet 42nd Rifle Corps and its 104th Division. Although some units escaped, large Soviet formations were subsequently destroyed and the Soviets had to leave most of their equipment behind. In the face of the new German thrust, the Soviets retreated to the Tuutsa River. They tried to establish a new defensive line around Alakurtti, but were unable to hold out against the pursuing Finnish-German units. After the Soviets lost Alakurtti they withdrew to the Voyta River where the old 1939 Soviet border fortifications were situated.|$|E
