2500|$|After {{the first}} few years of publication, the {{magazine}} began using itinerant artists and engravers to produce local illustrations. [...] In 1881, the magazine hired its first full-time artist, Henry Epting. [...] His first illustrations appeared in the July 1881 issue. [...] Illustrator Junius F. Whiting joined the staff in early 1882, and Albert B. Burr was hired a year later. [...] These excellent artists produced numerous illustrations for <b>each</b> <b>addition</b> of the magazine. [...] In 1883 alone, there were 282 illustrations used in the magazine’s twelve regular issues. [...] In 1884, Clarence L.

60|$|It is {{only when}} the instances, being indefinitely multiplied and varied, {{continue}} to suggest the same result, that this result acquires any high degree of independent value. If there are but two instances, A B C and A D E, though these instances have no antecedent in common except A, yet as the effect may possibly have been produced in the two cases by different causes, the result is at most only a slight probability in favor of A; there may be causation, but it is almost equally probable {{that there was only}} a coincidence. But the oftener we repeat the observation, varying the circumstances, the more we advance toward a solution of this doubt. For if we try A F G, A H K, etc., all unlike one another except in containing the circumstance A, and if we find the effect a entering into the result in all these cases, we must suppose one of two things, either that it is caused by A, or that it has as many different causes as there are instances. With <b>each</b> <b>addition,</b> therefore, to the number of instances, the presumption is strengthened in favor of A. The inquirer, of course, will not neglect, if an opportunity present itself, to exclude A from some one of these combinations, from A H K for instance, and by trying H K separately, appeal to the Method of Difference in aid of the Method of Agreement. By the Method of Difference alone can it be ascertained that A is the cause of a; but that it is either the cause, or another effect of the same cause, may be placed beyond any reasonable doubt by the Method of Agreement, provided the instances are very numerous as well as sufficiently various.|$|E
