5|$|Even by Sammarinese standards, {{qualification}} for the 1998 World Cup was disappointing. Losing {{every game}} by three <b>goals</b> <b>or</b> more, San Marino failed {{to score a}} single goal. This is the only World Cup qualifying tournament {{in which they have}} failed to score. Qualification for Euro 2000 again resulted in defeats in every game. The closest game was against Cyprus, a 1–0 defeat on 18 November 1998.|$|E

5|$|Due to the NHL's {{decision}} to lock out the players {{at the start}} of the 2012–13 season until a new collective bargaining agreement could be reached, Johansen was reassigned to the Blue Jackets' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Springfield Falcons. On February 24, 2013, Johansen was re-called by the Blue Jackets for the remainder of the season, which began on January 19 after an agreement was reached. In the 2013–14 season, Johansen had a break-out year, scoring 33 goals and 30 assists for a total of 63 points, a career high. He was the third Blue Jacket in franchise history to post 30 <b>goals</b> <b>or</b> more in one season.|$|E

5|$|Meredith had to {{deal with}} {{extremely}} physical defences, and was often boxed into the corner of the pitch by as many as four players. As his talents became widely regarded, more well organised defences would designate him with a man-marker, to try and isolate him from his teammates. This often left him reliant on an unselfish inside-right partner willing to fetch and carry the ball for him without expecting much in terms of <b>goals</b> <b>or</b> glory in return. A hard-working wing-half would also improve Meredith's effectiveness by winning the ball and sending him a pass down the flank. The best teams he played in also had a centre-forward able {{to make the most of}} his accurate crosses.|$|E

5|$|Hershey {{began its}} regular season with major {{offensive}} problems. They were outshot in 17 {{of their first}} 18 games, and were held to one or fewer goals in seven of those games. Their 6–10–1–0 start was the lowest total through 17 games since 2004–05, which was the last season they {{failed to make the}} playoffs. After losing their season opener to the Syracuse Crunch, the Bears beat the Binghamton Senators on October 19 despite being outshot 44 to 21. Hershey lost their first home game on October 20, falling 8–7 to the Rochester Americans; the 15-goal total marked the most combined goals from a Bears home opener, up from the previous record of 12 in 1987. Hershey center Ryan Potulny exited the game with an undisclosed injury, and would not return until November 16 after a nine-game absence. The team's defense improved in subsequent games, allowing two <b>goals</b> <b>or</b> fewer in four of their next five matches.|$|E

50|$|The golden <b>goal</b> <b>or</b> golden {{point is}} a rule used in {{association}} football, bandy, lacrosse, field hockey, ice hockey and korfball to decide the winner of a match (typically a knock-out match) in which scores are equal {{at the end of}} normal time. It is a type of sudden death. Under this rule, the game will end when a <b>goal</b> <b>or</b> point is scored; the team that scores that <b>goal</b> <b>or</b> point during extra time will be the winner. Introduced formally in 1992, though with some history before that, the rule ceased to apply to most FIFA authorized football games in 2004. The similar silver goal supplemented the golden goal between 2002 and 2004.|$|R

5|$|Team {{effectiveness}} (also {{referred to}} as group effectiveness) is the capacity a team has to accomplish the <b>goals</b> <b>or</b> objectives administered by an authorized personnel or the organization. A team {{is a collection of}} individuals who are interdependent in their tasks, share responsibility for outcomes, and view themselves as a unit embedded in an institutional or organizational system which operates within the established boundaries of that system. Teams and groups have established a synonymous relationship within the confines of processes and research relating to their effectiveness (i.e. group cohesiveness, teamwork) while still maintaining their independence as two separate units, as groups and their members are independent of each other's role, skill, knowledge or purpose versus teams and their members, who are interdependent upon each other's role, skill, knowledge and purpose.|$|E
5|$|The {{player is}} free to join {{any one of the}} servile groups and share common <b>goals,</b> <b>or</b> remain unaligned. Geneforge can be {{completed}} without joining any group. Trajkov can be killed through combat or tricked into killing himself by using the Geneforge. He can also be aided in activating the device, if the player steals the shaper gloves from Goettsch. Goettsch offers the player fake shaper gauntlets, which do not protect Trajkov from the Geneforge's energy should he be convinced they are genuine shaping gloves. The player can complete the game by using the last boat on Sucia Island. The small vessel is moored in a guarded dock {{on the far side of}} the island. Finishing the game unlocks one of more than a dozen game endings, dependent on the player's actions during the game.|$|E
5|$|In Challenge mode, {{the player}} must sneak around and deliver food to hungry NPCs. Hunger is {{indicated}} above thought bubbles which float above {{the heads of}} the NPCs. An NPC with a burger icon over their head is able to be given food, but they will lose their appetite if they spot the player. NPCs move around the map in a set pattern and have a narrow cone of vision to detect player. Erik Brudvig of IGN described this narrow cone of vision as being similar to those of Metal Gear Solid. NPCs can also detect the player by excessive noise, the amount of sound a player is making is indicated by a noise meter. Challenges can be failed if a player alerts NPCs to their presence. Successful delivery of an item requires sneaking up behind an NPC or surprising them from a hiding place. Points are awarded based on how hungry a character is, the player's stealth and proximity to the NPC and style points on delivery. When presenting food, a Flourish meter appears which quickly fills and empties, requiring a timed button press. The higher the flourish meter, the more style points. Each level has 20 associated challenges and fulfilling half the challenges on a level opens the way to the next level. Once all 80 challenges are completed, an alternative costume is unlocked.

5|$|Robert Campbell was {{appointed}} by a 13-man sub-committee to be the club's first secretary-manager from a shortlist of 30applicants. Secretarial duties were carried out by committee member Whyte, with Campbell's role more on the playing side. The committee assembled a squad {{at the cost of}} £917 10s 0d. Their first game was a 2–0 defeat away at Grimsby Town on 1 September 1903, and first home game was six days later against Gainsborough Trinity, played in front of a crowd of 11,000 including the Lord Mayor and Lady Mayoress of Bradford. It was not until the third game against Burton United that the club recorded their first victory, {{on the way to a}} 10th-placefinish in Division Two. The club faced having to apply for re-election in their second season, until five wins in the final six games lifted the club to eighth position. In November 1905, Peter O'Rourke, one of the club's centre-halves, {{was appointed}} manager, with his last game as a player coming the following month. He guided City to finishes of 11th and fifth and then earned promotion to Division One in 1907–08. The season had started with an 8–1 victory over Chesterfield and included another six victories when City scored five <b>goals</b> <b>or</b> more, before promotion and then the title were assured with successive victories over Derby County and Burnley in April.|$|E
5|$|He {{made his}} debut for Millwall {{in the opening}} game of the 2009–10 season, {{starting}} in the club's 1–1 draw with Southampton; providing the assist for Millwall's equaliser. A month later, he scored his first goal for Millwall in a 3–1 victory over Huddersfield Town. Playing in a deeper role than when at Stevenage, Morison struggled for goals, but made the majority of Millwall's goals throughout October, whilst also netting in a 5–0 win over Tranmere Rovers. In December 2009, he scored a 91st-minute winner in a 3–2 victory over Milton Keynes Dons, and also scored a similar goal in a 4–0 win over Staines Town in the FA Cup. Three days later, Morison scored twice in Millwall's 2–1 victory over Walsall. His fine form through December continued, scoring twice in a 4–4 draw against Charlton Athletic at The Valley. He scored his seventh goal in as many games in a 2–0 win over Bristol Rovers, whilst also assisting the second goal. Morison scored his second goal of Millwall's FA Cup campaign against Derby County at Pride Park in early January 2010; scoring in the 108th minute as Millwall were knocked out 5–3 on a penalty shootout. He provided the assists for both of Millwall's goals in games against Southampton and Oldham Athletic respectively, before scoring the winner in a 1–0 victory over Brighton & Hove Albion; his 11th goal of the season. This was followed up with a brace in a 3–1 win away to Carlisle United, whilst also setting up Millwall's third goal. Morison scored another brace four days later, as Millwall beat Charlton Athletic 4–0. His 17th of the season came {{in front of the}} Sky cameras against Leeds United at Elland Road. Shortly after, Morison scored his 18th goal of the campaign, scoring a header from an acute angle in Millwall's 5–0 win over Stockport County. As a result of his fine goalscoring form throughout March, Morison was named Football League One Player of the Month. Another goal followed for Morison in a 2–1 win away at Colchester United. Morison's 20th goal of the season came in a 2–1 victory over Leyton Orient, scoring Millwall's second goal from the penalty spot. The goal subsequently means that Morison has now scored 20 <b>goals</b> <b>or</b> more in his last six seasons for three different clubs. On {{the last day of the}} season, Morison scored a brace against Swindon Town in a 3–2 victory. Morison's first was a coolly dispatched penalty, whilst he supplied the cross that led to an own goal. Morison's second goal of the game was a half-volley from outside the area; looping into the top right-hand corner of the net. He scored his 23rd goal of the season in Millwall's 2–0 win against Huddersfield Town as Millwall progressed to the League One play-off final, where they beat Swindon Town 1–0 at Wembley Stadium; Morison's third successive victory at the stadium.|$|E
