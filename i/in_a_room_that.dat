25|$|Another famous thought reader was {{the magician}} Stuart Cumberland. He {{was famous for}} {{performing}} blindfolded feats such as identifying a hidden object <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>room</b> <b>that</b> a person had picked out or asking someone to imagine a murder scene and then attempt to read the subject's thoughts and identify the victim and reenact the crime. Cumberland claimed to possess no genuine psychic ability and his thought reading performances could only be demonstrated by holding the hand of his subject to read their muscular movements. He came into dispute with psychical researchers associated with the Society for Psychical Research who were searching for genuine cases of telepathy. Cumberland argued that both telepathy and communication with the dead were impossible and that the mind of man cannot be read through telepathy, but only by muscle reading.|$|E
25|$|Walter Richard Sickert (31 May 1860 – 22 January 1942) was a German-born {{artist of}} British and Danish ancestry, who was first {{mentioned}} as a possible Ripper suspect in Donald McCormick's book The Identity of Jack the Ripper (1959). He had a fascination with the Ripper murders, {{going so far as}} to stay <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>room</b> <b>that</b> was rumoured to have once had Jack the Ripper himself as a lodger, and depicted similar scenes in many of his paintings. Sickert subsequently appeared as a character in the , who claimed to be Sickert's illegitimate son. The theory was later developed by author Jean Overton Fuller, and by crime novelist Patricia Cornwell in her book Portrait of a Killer (2002). However, Sickert is not considered a serious suspect by most who study the case, and strong evidence shows he was in France at the time of most of the Ripper murders.|$|E
500|$|Morehead {{was later}} {{transferred}} to Fort Warren in Boston Harbor. He complained to his captors {{about the conditions}} in the prison; specifically, the difficulty of writing letters when confined with nine other men <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>room</b> <b>that</b> measured just ten feet by twenty feet. Petitions for Morehead's release were delivered to President Lincoln, but Lincoln told Secretary of State Seward that Morehead and those arrested with them would be released [...] "when James Guthrie and James Speed [...] think they should be". Later, Guthrie told Lincoln that Morehead's arrest had [...] "not been beneficial" [...] to their cause in Kentucky. Morehead was paroled on January 6, 1862, {{on the condition that}} he swear an oath not {{to take part in the}} Confederate insurgence. On March 19, 1862, he was unconditionally discharged from his parole.|$|E

500|$|The {{control center}} for the {{synchronization}} of images, water flow, and lighting color and intensity is beneath one of the towers, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>room</b> <b>that</b> covers [...] The room houses high-definition video servers and equipment temperature sensors. Hard drives contain all the individual electronic computer files of the face videos. Generally, the computer programs automatically perform tasks such as determining when the face will pucker and, if weather conditions permit, when to turn the water on and off. Using low- rather than high-resolution images was both less expensive and created a better display for the average viewer. A Barco show controller selects the sequence of faces {{one at a time}} and determines a random tower lighting selection of one of eight LED colors programmed into an Electronic Theatre Controls (ETC) Emphasis control system. [...] At night, the ETC system controls spotlights that illuminate the cascading water and that are dimmed by special wet-use location ground fault circuit interrupters. [...] The control room covers an area equal to 26parking spaces in the underground parking garage, which costs the city $100,000 annually in terms of the opportunity cost of lost revenue (in 2004dollars). Maintenance issues for the fountain range from kids removing the adhesive between the bricks to pipes in need of maintenance. [...] , annual upkeep costs were approximately $400,000.Typically, the fountain’s water features function between mid-spring and mid-fall, but the images remain on the screen year-round.|$|E
500|$|The land {{developed}} for the permanent capitol buildings was Salem block 84, sold to the state for this purpose by pioneer and Salem founder W. H. Willson. Construction of the first capitol building began in 1854, shortly after Congress confirmed Salem as the capital city. However, with the capital moving to Corvallis the next year, construction was temporarily halted. After the capital's return to Salem, the building was nearly completed by late 1855. This territorial capitol, of Greek Revival-style, stood [...] wide and [...] long (15 by 23 m), with a stone facade and a 10-foot (3 m) portico. Built of native ashlar blocks, the exterior walls, two stories high, ranged in color from a deep sky blue to white. [...] The first floor was [...] tall and the second [...] tall with an eight-foot (2.4 m) entablature. The building was decorated with four Ionic columns on the front (west) end. The building housed a variety of rooms, including a federal courthouse with a chamber measuring 20 by 27 feet (6 by 8 m) and an executive office of 18 by 20ft (5.5 by 6 m) {{on the first floor}}. Also on the first floor was the House chamber, measuring 36 by 46 feet (11 by 14 m) and having three entrances. The first floor also held the main hall, which included an entrance [...] wide. On the second floor was the Senate chamber, 26 by 36 feet (8 by 11 m). Additionally, the Territorial Library was housed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>room</b> <b>that</b> was 20 by 36 feet (6 by 11 m). The second story also had a gallery viewing area for the House, three committee rooms, and several rooms for government clerks. The capitol was designed by Captain Charles Bennet, who participated in the discovery of gold at Sutter's Mill in 1848, and construction supervised by William H. Richter at a total cost of $25,000.|$|E

2500|$|Among {{the major}} hotels {{at or near}} Potsdamer Platz were two {{designed}} by the same architect, Otto Rehnig (1864–1925), and opened in the same year, 1908.

2500|$|The series uses green {{screen to}} augment the live action, {{inserting}} views of outdoor scenes in windows and broadcast images on TV monitors, often in post-production. The Production Designer, Steve Arnold, also describes in detail {{the use of a}} three-sided green screen to insert street scenes outside car windows, with synchronized LED screens above the car (and out of camera shot), that emit the appropriate light onto the actors and parts of the car, such as window frames: [...] "All the driving in the show, anything inside the vehicle is done on stage, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>room</b> <b>that</b> is a big three-sided green screen space. The car does not move, the actors are in the car, and the cameras are set up around them. We have very long strips of LED monitors hung above the car. We had a camera crew go to Washington, D.C. to drive around and shoot plates for what you see outside when you’re driving. And that is fed into the LED screens above the car. So as the scene is progressing, the LED screens are synched up to emit interactive light to match the light conditions you see in the scenery you’re driving past (that will be added in post). All the reflections on the car windows, the window frames and door jambs is being shot while we’re shooting the actors in the car. Then in post the green screens are replaced with the synced up driving plates, and it works really well. It gives you the sense of light passing over the actors’ faces, matching the lighting that is {{in the image of the}} plate".|$|E
2500|$|Madonna's {{inspiration}} {{to direct the}} film came from the controversial lives of Edward and Simpson. She recalled from her experience that if she brought up King Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson {{at a dinner party}} or a social gathering, [...] "it's like throwing a Molotov cocktail into the room. Everyone erupts into an argument about who they were. I mean, they were very controversial– and continue to be. So, of course, I'm very attracted to that." [...] She investigated the history behind the abdication and tried to understand what led Edward to leave his royal throne. The singer spent two years researching the life of Simpson and writing the script. She wallpapered an empty room in her house with pictures from auction catalogues and photographs of the Duke and Duchess throughout their lives. [...] "I was sitting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>room</b> <b>that</b> was completely and utterly inundated with their images so I could soak up their energy. I was trying {{to understand the nature of}} their love story and trying to figure out for myself if there is such a thing as perfect love," [...] she said. However, not interested in making a biopic about Simpson, Madonna created the modern-day story about the character Wally Winthrop, so that she could have a point of view in which to tell the narrative. She explained later: [...] "We can all read the same history book and have a different point of view. So it was important for me to not present the story and say, 'This is the one and only story,' but to say, 'This story moved me and inspired me.' That's how the two love stories were created." ...|$|E
