5|$|Adenanthos obovatus hybridises with A.detmoldii {{to produce}} A.× pamela. Known only from road verges in the Scott River region, {{it was first}} {{discovered}} in 1979, {{and it is now}} known from more than twenty individual plants. The discovery of <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>such</b> large numbers, together with its recognised horticultural potential, prompted Nelson to formally describe and name it in 1986. Morphologically it is intermediate between its parents; that is, taller than A.obovatus, with longer leaves and light red flowers. It is fertile, raising the possibility of the establishment of a hybrid swarm.|$|E
5|$|Theistic {{evolution}} was {{the idea}} that God intervened in the process of evolution, to guide <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>such</b> a way that the living world could still be considered to be designed. The term was promoted by Charles Darwin's greatest American advocate Asa Gray. However, this idea gradually fell out of favor among scientists, as they became more and more committed to the idea of methodological naturalism and came to believe that direct appeals to supernatural involvement were scientifically unproductive. By 1900, theistic evolution had largely disappeared from professional scientific discussions, although it retained a strong popular following.|$|E

25|$|The five-needle telegraph, {{which was}} mainly, if not entirely, due to Wheatstone, {{was similar to}} that of Schilling, and based on the {{principle}} enunciated by André-Marie Ampère – that is to say, the current was sent into the line by completing the circuit of the battery with a make and break key, and at the other end it passed through a coil of wire surrounding a magnetic needle free to turn round its centre. According as one pole of the battery or the other was applied to the line by means of the key, the current deflected the needle to one side or the other. There were five separate circuits actuating five different needles. The latter were pivoted in rows across the middle of a dial shaped like a diamond, and having the letters of the alphabet arranged upon <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>such</b> a way that a letter was literally pointed out by the current deflecting two of the needles towards it.|$|E
25|$|During his {{period at}} Contimporanul, Dan {{embarked}} on a conflict with the Surrealist and far leftist group at unu, the magazine of poet Sașa Pană. This controversy reflected the major discrepancies between Contimporanul and other avant-garde venues. By 1930, Sergiu's brother Mihail Dan had left Bilete de Papagal and had become involved with unu, {{of which he was}} later editor in chief. However, documents first made public in 2008 show that he was secretly an informant for the Kingdom of Romania's intelligence agency, Siguranța Statului, with a mission to supervise unus ongoing flirtations with communism. He had for long been suspected of this by the literary society at Sburătorul. Also in 1930, shortly after the forceful return of Romanian King Carol II to the throne, Sergiu Dan was working, as political editor, on the staff of Dreptatea, the platform of the National Peasants' Party (PNȚ). According to the later account of communist journalist Petre Pandrea, Dan and Vinea together stole the original draft of an article by PNȚ economist Virgil Madgearu, and forged <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>such</b> manner as to make it seem that Madgearu was an anti-Carlist; they then sold a copy to Madgearu's rival, the corporatist theorist Mihail Manoilescu. Manoilescu took a copy of this document to Carol, discrediting himself when the forgery was exposed. Pandrea claimed that, between them, Dan and Vinea made off with 150,000 lei from the affair, whereas their victim Manoilescu fell into permanent disfavor.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1917, Werfel left the {{frontline}} for the Military Press Bureau in Vienna, where he joined other notable Austrian writers serving as propagandists, among them Robert Musil, Rilke, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, and Franz Blei. Through the latter, Werfel met {{and fell in love}} with Alma Mahler, widow of Gustav Mahler, the former lover of the painter Oskar Kokoschka, and the wife of the architect Walter Gropius, then serving in the Imperial German Army on the Western Front. Alma, who was also a composer, had already set one of Werfel’s poems to music, reciprocated despite Werfel being much younger, shorter, and having Jewish features that she, being both anti-Semitic and attracted to Jewish men, found initially distasteful. Their love affair culminated in the premature birth of a son, Martin, in August 1918. Martin, who was given the surname of Gropius, died in May of the following year. Despite attempts to save his marriage to Alma, with whom he had a young daughter, Manon, Gropius reluctantly agreed to a divorce in 1920. Ironically, Alma refused to marry Werfel for the next nine years. However, Alma, more so than with her first two husbands and lovers, lent herself to the development of Werfel’s career and influenced <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>such</b> a way that he became an accomplished playwright and novelist as well as poet. They married on 6 July 1929.|$|E

25|$|When Cicero {{returned}} to Rome, he reconciled with Pompey. Food shortages caused popular unrest. The people {{threatened to kill}} the senators. Cicero persuaded them pass a law to elect Pompey as praefectus annonae (prefect of the provisions) in Italy and beyond for five years. This post was instituted at times of severe grain shortage to supervise the grain supply. Clodius alleged that the scarcity of rain had been engineered to propose a law that boosted Pompey’s power, which had been decreasing. Plutarch noted that others {{said that it was}} a device by Lentulus Spinther to confine Pompey to an office so that he himself would be sent to Egypt to help king Ptolemy XII of Egypt with a rebellion he was facing instead of Pompey. A plebeian tribune had proposed a law to send Pompey to Egypt as a mediator without an army. The senate rejected it on the ground of fears about his safety. As praefectus annonae Pompey sent agents and fiends to various places and sailed to Sardinia, Sicily and the Roman province of Africa (the breadbaskets of the Roman empire) to collect grain. He collected <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>such</b> abundance that the markets were filled and there was also enough to supply foreign peoples. Both Plutarch and Cassius Dio thought that the law made Pompey ‘the master of all the land and sea under Roman possession’. Appian wrote that this success gave Pompey great reputation and power. Cassius Dio also wrote that Pompey faced some delays in the distribution of grain because many slaves had been freed prior to the distribution and Pompey wanted to take a census to ensure they received it in an orderly way.|$|E

Series creator Chris Carter later emphasized that the theme of the episode was more on personal belief rather than organized religion, noting, [...] " [...] deals with faith, not religion with a capital 'R' or Catholicism with a capital 'C'". The producers for the series were cautious about presenting an overtly religious episode of the series for fear of [...] "pissing certain people off", but, according to Carter, the show [...] "handled <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>such</b> a way as to make it about miracle belief, or lack of belief." ...|$|E
500|$|Occasionally, the {{distinction}} between errors of law and errors of fact can be fuzzy.

This can be the case where a statutory term evaluated by the authority is so general and ambiguous that reasonable people may peg different meanings to <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> <b>such</b> a situation, it is generally left to the authority to evaluate the meaning of the term. This is illustrated by Puhlhofer v. Hillingdon London Borough Council (1986), which involved a public authority that bore a statutory responsibility for providing homeless people with accommodation. The applicants were a married couple who lived with their two children in a single room in a guest house. Their application for permanent accommodation was rejected because the authority claimed they were not [...] "homeless" [...] within the meaning of the statute. The House of Lords upheld this decision, determining that the issue of whether the applicants had accommodation was a question of fact to be determined by the public authority: ...|$|E

500|$|Even if the {{subject-matter}} {{of a case}} {{is generally}} non-justiciable, there are exceptions where the courts will still review the case. For instance, a dispute may prima facie involve a non-justiciable area but, on a closer look, the courts may decide {{that there is a}} justiciable matter within <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> <b>such</b> a situation, the courts will intervene and review the case. An example of this was given by Judicial Commissioner Menon in Lee Hsien Loong: [...] "here what appears to raise a question of international law in fact bears on the application of domestic law, that is something the court may well find justiciable." [...] In Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, the court similarly distinguished a pronouncement on the interpretation of a treaty generally, which is impermissible, from the consideration of [...] "the application of an international treaty by reference to the facts of an individual case" [...] which is allowed.

Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, ex parte Everett (1988), the Court of Appeal of England and Wales took the view that a decision by the Secretary of State exercised under the royal prerogative to deny a passport to a British citizen residing abroad raised a justiciable issue because it was not a high policy matter involving foreign affairs but [...] "a matter of administrative decision, affecting the rights of individuals and their freedom of travel".|$|E
