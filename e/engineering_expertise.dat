5|$|The rebels {{made the}} first move in the war, seizing the {{strategic}} Rochester Castle, owned by Langton but left almost unguarded by the archbishop. John was well prepared for a conflict. He had stockpiled {{money to pay for}} mercenaries and ensured the support of the powerful marcher lords with their own feudal forces, such as William Marshal and Ranulf of Chester. The rebels lacked the <b>engineering</b> <b>expertise</b> or heavy equipment necessary to assault the network of royal castles that cut off the northern rebel barons from those in the south. John's strategy was to isolate the rebel barons in London, protect his own supply lines to his key source of mercenaries in Flanders, prevent the French from landing in the south-east, and then win the war through slow attrition. John put off dealing with the badly deteriorating situation in North Wales, where Llywelyn the Great was leading a rebellion against the 1211 settlement.|$|E

25|$|On 24 May 1956, Wärtsilä and Sudoimport, the Soviet {{foreign trade}} {{organization}} with a monopoly {{for the foreign}} trade of ships, signed a shipbuilding contract {{for the construction of}} two polar icebreakers. While only half as powerful as the 44,000hp Lenin, the new icebreakers featured the most powerful diesel-electric power plant ever installed on a ship at the time. The Soviet negotiators had additional requirements for deep draught and fuel consumption, which Wahlforss promised Wärtsilä to reach. In practice, the demands put the company's <b>engineering</b> <b>expertise</b> to a tough test. At the end, however, Wärtsilä could deliver what Wahlforss had promised.

25|$|In 1853 {{the company}} again sought an {{extended}} lease. Again {{they were planning}} a new even lower level to exploit ore reserves at greater depths in the mine, and this would require years of work. This time the landowners {{took the opportunity to}} introduce some changes to the terms of the lease. William Marshall in particular was critical of the company’s lack of <b>engineering</b> <b>expertise</b> and poor long-term planning. A key provision of the new lease was the appointment of an independent consultant engineer as mineral agent, paid for by the company but appointed jointly by the landowners and the company. Other provisions sought to mitigate some of the nuisances caused by a working mine in the area, from pollution of the river and the lake, to the state of the roads and the cleanliness of the workers’ accommodation.|$|E
40|$|The {{three key}} {{elements}} of <b>engineering</b> design <b>expertise</b> [...] -framing, systemic thinking and the conscious application of first principles [...] -have {{been shown to be}} difficult to acquire by both students and practicing professionals. Because of this, it is of value to investigate how framing, systemic thinking and the application of first principles can be better developed in engineering students which will in turn develop better graduate design engineers. This paper reports on a project to do this in two mechanical engineering design subjects. Students were introduced to one or all of the three {{key elements of}} <b>engineering</b> design <b>expertise,</b> encouraged to apply them in a design project and practice questions throughout the semester of study. Finally, students were examined on their framing ability and their ability to apply first principles. It was found that only around 15 % to 20 % had a developed framing ability. Further, the ability to apply first principles appeared to be bimodal some students could apply them almost completely, some could not apply them at all and only a few could apply them partially. This suggests that skills related to <b>engineering</b> design <b>expertise</b> can only be learned by some students or that the current education system (including earlier schooling) has not developed sufficient related skills in the majority of students. This requires further research...|$|R

25|$|During this period, Americans watched {{closely the}} {{development}} of railways in the United Kingdom. The main competition came from canals, {{many of which were}} in operation under state ownership, and from privately owned steamboats plying the nation's vast river system. In 1829, Massachusetts prepared an elaborate plan. Government support, most especially the detailing of officers from the Army Corps of Engineers - the nation's only repository of civil <b>engineering</b> <b>expertise</b> - was crucial in assisting private enterprise in building nearly all the country's railroads. Army Engineer officers surveyed and selected routes, planned, designed, and constructed rights-of-way, track, and structures, and introduced the Army's system of reports and accountability to the railroad companies. More than one in ten of the 1,058 graduates from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point between 1802 and 1866 became corporate presidents, chief engineers, treasurers, superintendents and general managers of railroad companies. Among the Army officers who thus assisted the building and managing of the first American railroads were Stephen Harriman Long, George Washington Whistler, and Herman Haupt.|$|E
25|$|The last {{problem to}} be solved was how to {{separate}} the Lunar Module a safe distance away from the Command Module just before re-entry. The normal procedure was to use the Service Module's reaction control system (RCS) to pull the CSM away after releasing the LM along with the Command Module's docking ring, but this RCS was inoperative because of the power failure, and the useless SM would be released before the LM. To solve the problem, Grumman called on the <b>engineering</b> <b>expertise</b> of the University of Toronto. A team of six UT engineers, led by senior scientist Bernard Etkin, was formed {{to solve the problem}} within a day. The team concluded that pressurizing the tunnel connecting the Lunar Module to the Command Module just before separation would provide the force necessary to push the two modules a safe distance away from each other just prior to re-entry. The team had 6 hours to compute the pressure required, using slide rules. They needed an accurate calculation, as too high a pressure might damage the hatch and its seal, causing the astronauts to burn up; too low a pressure would not provide enough separation distance of the LM. Grumman relayed their calculation to NASA, and from there in turn to the astronauts, who used it successfully.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{research}} into the effects of background (national and cultural) on design thinking and practice has shown that background does indeed affect the way an individual approaches a design problem. Given the role of design within engineering and national diversity of students within many engineering courses, {{an understanding of how}} this happens can be used to inform engineering design curricular. To inform how engineering design curricula can be modified to benefit a greater diversity of students. Prior art on <b>engineering</b> design <b>expertise,</b> theory on the effects of background upon psychology (specifically comparing Sino and occidental groups) and theory on engineering design education will be reviewed. The outcomes of these reviews will then be used to draw conclusion on likely problems and potential solutions. Cultural attitudes toward the nature of knowledge can affect the way a student thinks a problem should be solved, which can lead them away from developing proper <b>engineering</b> design <b>expertise.</b> Further, national background can affect what one thinks is important, and how a problem is framed, which can prevent a student from taking on engineering problems objectively to find optimum solutions. Because background does affect the way one approaches a design problem {{it is important to note}} that all students will have something in their background that might help or hamper their ability to tackle design problems and develop their <b>engineering</b> design <b>expertise.</b> Helping students understand and confront this will help them to improve their engineering design ability and make the most of other educational tools used to develop design skills...|$|R

500|$|In 1869, the Illinois state {{legislature}} established the West Park Commission, which {{was responsible for}} three large parks and interlinking boulevards. Later that year, on November 4, 1869 the commissioners named the southernmost park in honor of Stephen A. Douglas (1813–1861). Best remembered for his pre-Civil War presidential defeat by Abraham Lincoln despite superb oratorical skills, Douglas was a United States Senator who helped bring the Illinois Central Railroad to Chicago. In 1871, designer William Le Baron Jenney completed plans for the entire West Park System which included Douglas, Garfield, and Humboldt parks. Jenney's <b>engineering</b> <b>expertise</b> was especially helpful for transforming Douglas Park's poor natural site into parkland. He had manure from the Union Stock Yards and sand added to the marshy site. [...] This process brought the [...] of land to grade level. In {{the center of the}} landscape, Jenney created a picturesque lake, and a small section of the park was formally opened in 1879. Inflated construction costs and post Great Chicago Fire tax collection difficulties resulted in phased projects. The first improvements were made to the park by Oscar DuBuis in the 1880s. [...] Between 1886 and 1888 Douglas Park, like the other West Park System parks, replaced its greenhouse with a conservatory. In 1895, members of several German turners' clubs petitioned for an outdoor gymnasium, and the following year one of Chicago's first public facilities was constructed with an outdoor gymnasium (pictured right), swimming pool, and natatorium.|$|E
