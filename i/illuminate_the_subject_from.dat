50|$|In {{lighting}} design, backlighting is <b>the</b> {{process of}} <b>illuminating</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> back. In other words, the lighting instrument and the viewer face each other, with <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> in between. This creates a glowing {{effect on the}} edges of <b>the</b> <b>subject,</b> while other areas are darker. The backlight can be a natural or artificial source of light. When artificial, the back light is usually placed directly behind <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> in a 4-point lighting setup. A back light, which lights foreground elements from the rear, is {{not to be confused with}} a background light, which lights background elements (such as scenery).|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{technique}} for creating an animatable image-based appearance {{model of a}} human face, able to capture appearance variation over changing facial expression, head pose, view direction, and lighting condition. Our capture process makes use of a specialized lighting apparatus designed to rapidly <b>illuminate</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> sequentially <b>from</b> many different directions {{in just a few}} seconds. For each pose, <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> remains still while six video cameras capture their appearance under each of the directions of lighting. We repeat this process for approximately 60 different poses, capturing different expressions, visemes, head poses, and eye positions. The images for each of the poses and camera views are registered to each other semi-automatically with the help of fiducial markers. The result is a model which can be rendered realistically under any linear blend of the captured poses and under any desired lighting condition by warping, scaling, and blending data from the original images. Finally, we show how to drive the model with performance capture data, where the pose is not necessarily a linear combination of the original captured poses...|$|R

50|$|An {{environmental}} portrait is {{a portrait}} executed in <b>the</b> <b>subject's</b> usual environment, {{such as in}} their home or workplace, and typically <b>illuminates</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject's</b> life and surroundings. The term is most frequently used of a genre of photography.|$|R
50|$|The three light {{setup is}} a {{standard}} method used in photography and, although {{is not the only}} method used, it is the most common. This method uses three separate positions that help <b>the</b> photographer <b>illuminate</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject.</b> It is formed by; the Key or main light, the fill light, and the back light.|$|R
50|$|Using just a {{key light}} {{results in a}} high-contrast scene, {{especially}} if the background is not illuminated. A fill light decreases contrast and adds more details to the dark areas of an image. An alternative to the fill light is to reflect existing light or to illuminate other objects in the scene (which in turn further <b>illuminate</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject).</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{one common}} arrangement, the laser beam is split into two, one {{known as the}} object beam and the other as the {{reference}} beam. The object beam is expanded by passing it through a lens and used to <b>illuminate</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject.</b> <b>The</b> recording medium is located where this light, after being reflected or scattered by <b>the</b> <b>subject,</b> will strike it. The edges of the medium will ultimately serve as a window through which <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> is seen, so its location is chosen with that in mind. The reference beam is expanded and made to shine directly on the medium, where it interacts with the light coming <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> to create <b>the</b> desired interference pattern.|$|R
5000|$|... "Stooky" [...] or [...] "stookie" [...] is Scots for stucco or plaster of Paris, {{or for a}} {{plaster cast}} used to immobilise bone fractures. The term is also used someone who is slow-witted or awkward in his movements. <b>The</b> {{incandescent}} lights <b>illuminating</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> to be televised generated so much heat that Baird couldn't use a human for the testing, so Stooky Bill was used. Eventually the hair became singed and the painted face became cracked by the heat.|$|R
40|$|A robust {{method of}} camera {{response}} function estimation, using pictures taken by differently <b>illuminating</b> <b>the</b> same <b>subject</b> matter, is presented. The method solves for the response function directly using superposition constraints imposed by {{different combinations of}} two (or more) lights to <b>illuminate</b> <b>the</b> same <b>subject</b> matter. Previous methods of computing camera response functions typically used differing exposures of identical subject matter, leading to uniqueness problems (underconstrained due to comparametric periodicity or fractal ambiguity). The method used in this paper overcomes this problem. Finally, we compare the method of the paper to previous methods and find the new method outperforms the previous work...|$|R
50|$|This {{technique}} is often combined with using coloured gels {{in front of}} the flash unit to provide different colours in order to <b>illuminate</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> in different ways. It is also common to flash the unit several times during the exposure while swapping the colours of the gels around to mix colours on the final photo. This requires some skill and a lot of imagination since {{it is not possible to}} see how the effects will turn out until the exposure is complete. By using this technique, <b>the</b> photographer can <b>illuminate</b> specific parts of <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> in different colours creating shadows in ways which would not normally be possible.|$|R
25|$|Although {{the goals}} of any {{discussion}} will change depending upon what's under discussion, some goals will always be <b>the</b> same: to <b>illuminate</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject,</b> to unravel its mysteries, to interpret and share and learn from other points of view, {{to piece together the}} puzzle using everyone's contribution. Discussion skills are important. Everyone must be aware of how to get this discussion rolling and keep it rolling and interesting. Just as in any sport, a number of skills are necessary to work on and use at appropriate times. Everyone is expected to contribute by using these skills.|$|R
50|$|The {{back light}} (a.k.a. the rim, hair, or {{shoulder}} light) shines on <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>from</b> behind, often (but not necessarily) {{to one side}} or the other. It gives <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> a rim of light, serving to separate <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> background and highlighting contours.|$|R
40|$|Donald Preziosi’s {{investigations}} {{of art history}} and museology work toward unmasking the ideological apparatus of the museum institution. With the current proliferation of museum studies programs in academia, Preziosi’s disciplinary critique becomes a key pedagogical device to <b>illuminate</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> of museum ethics. In classroom discussions on museological practices of collection, repatriation and exhibition, complex subjects that are further complicated by the politics of imperialism and globalization, I propose organizing students to stage mock trials of specific controversies in which the colonial legacy of the museum resurfaces in the accusations leveled at one another by the contending parties. This strategy helps tackle the problematic ethics of museums and their colonial legacies without compromising the nuanced complexity of <b>the</b> <b>subject...</b>|$|R
40|$|Inner resistanceThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the existence of an internal resistance to a work-related change in people who are long-term sick, and if this is related to an identification as “long-term sick”. A second purpose to the study was to research in which way this internal resistance to a work-related change manifests and point to possible solutions. A qualitative study was conducted with interviews of experts and people on sick leave to <b>illuminate</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject.</b> <b>The</b> main result was divided into interviewed groups. The result of the experience suggest that internal resistance to a work-related change associated with an identification exists and is ingrained thought patterns that often manifests itself as learned helplessness, learned limitations and fear of an unknown future. As solutions were suggested mental training, improved goal setting and more positive attitude. The focus of these answers pointed in the same direction for both the interviewed groups. ...|$|R

5000|$|Flying-spot scanner {{technology}} was later implemented by DuMont Laboratories in the Vitascan color television system, released in 1956. Vitascan produced NTSC color video using a [...] "camera" [...] that acted in reverse by housing the flying-spot CRT which was projected through the [...] "camera"'s lens and <b>illuminated</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> {{in a special}} light-tight studio. The light from the CRT [...] "camera" [...] was then picked up by special [...] "scoops" [...] housing 4 photomultiplier tubes (2 for red, 1 for green, and 1 for blue), which then would provide video of the talent in the studio. Unlike earlier FSS systems that relied on the studio being entirely darkened, Vitascan used a special strobe light would <b>illuminate</b> <b>the</b> studio for the talent's convenience, and would turn on during the photomultiplier scoop's blanking interval pulses, {{so as not to}} interfere with the scanning.|$|R

5000|$|The assist light (also {{known as}} AF illuminator) [...] "activates" [...] passive {{autofocus}} systems in low-light and low-contrast situations in some cameras. The lamp projects visible or IR light onto <b>the</b> <b>subject,</b> which <b>the</b> camera's autofocus system uses to achieve focus. Many cameras {{that do not}} have a dedicated autofocus assist lamp instead use their built-in flash, <b>illuminating</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> with stroboscopic bursts of light. The strobe bursts aid the autofocus system in the same fashion as a dedicated assist light, but have the disadvantage of startling or annoying living subjects. Another disadvantage is that if the camera uses flash focus assist and is set to an operation mode that overrides the flash, it may also disable the focus assist and autofocus may fail to acquire <b>the</b> <b>subject.</b> Similar stroboscopic flashing is sometime used to reduce the red-eye effect, but this method is only intended to constrict <b>the</b> <b>subject's</b> eye pupils prior to the actual shot being taken, and thus reduce retinal reflections.|$|R

5000|$|In its pure form, {{holography}} {{requires the}} use of laser light for <b>illuminating</b> <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> and for viewing the finished hologram. In a side-by-side comparison under optimal conditions, a holographic image is visually indistinguishable <b>from</b> <b>the</b> actual <b>subject,</b> if <b>the</b> hologram and <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> are lit just as they were at the time of recording. A microscopic level of detail throughout the recorded volume of space can be reproduced. In common practice, however, major image quality compromises are made to eliminate the need for laser illumination when viewing the hologram, and sometimes, to the extent possible, also when making it. Holographic portraiture often resorts to a non-holographic intermediate imaging procedure, to avoid the hazardous high-powered pulsed lasers otherwise needed to optically [...] "freeze" [...] living subjects as perfectly as the extremely motion-intolerant holographic recording process requires. Holograms can now also be entirely computer-generated and show objects or scenes that never existed.|$|R
