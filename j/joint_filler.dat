In the dry joint, the effect of epoxy on the strength improvement was investigated. The effectiveness of cast-in-place UHPC as a wet <b>joint</b> <b>filler</b> between UHPC segments {{was one of the main}} concerns. Basically, it can be expected that the strength of a joint needs to be similar to that of the main body to avoid the joint becoming a weak part. The number and height of shear keys were considered as variables to investigate the difference of failure mechanism and ultimate capacity at the joint. Three different curing temperatures of the UHPC filler of a wet joint were considered to account for the inferior condition of the construction site in terms of temperature control, when compared to a precast concrete plant where steam curing is available (Park et al. 2015). Lateral compressive stress was applied at several levels to account for various prestress introduced at the joint by the prestressing tendons that connect a number of segments. As explained earlier, shear keys having a 30  mm-height or shorter were used to investigate the improved performance of UHPC.|$|E

In this study, growth chamber experiments investigated the ability of various water permeable joint filling materials for pavements to prevent weed growth. <b>Joint</b> <b>fillers</b> included in the tests comprised five innovative (iron slag sand, polymeric bound sand and three sodium silicate enriched fillers) and eight standard <b>joint</b> <b>fillers</b> (four fine materials, for example, sea sand, white sand, sandstone and fine limestone, and four coarse materials based on porphyry and limestone). Their ability to suppress weeds was investigated by examining seedling emergence and biomass production of seven test species in pure or organically polluted (5 %, 10 %, 20 %, 40 % and 80 % compost by volume) filler substrate. Selected test species were dominant, hard-to-control weeds found on pavements. Seedling emergence and weed biomass were lowest in iron slag sand, polymeric bound sand and most sodium silicate enriched fillers, irrespective of pollution level or test species. Within standard <b>joint</b> <b>fillers,</b> pure white sand, sandstone and the coarse materials also reduced biomass, but their inhibitory effect dropped quickly once organically polluted, in contrast to fine limestone and sea sand for which weed suppression lasted longer (up to 40 % compost by volume).

40|$|Taking the {{underground}} powerhouse of a {{pumped storage power station}} as the engineering background, this study established a 3 D {{finite element model}} of the main and auxiliary powerhouse and performed the dynamic harmonica calculation for its fluctuating pressure. Based on the power flow theory, the ANSYS Parametric Design Language (APDL) procedure was completed to calculate the power transmission in the powerhouse. The law of dominant path recognition was first proposed to assess the structure’s dominant transmission using a numerical solution on nodes in the model. The conductivity of the closed-cell foam that filled the structure’s joints was examined, as were the dynamic transmission features of the rock around and beneath the powerhouse. The results indicated that, as a structural <b>joint</b> <b>filler,</b> closed-cell foam could actively restrict vibration transmission, and the directions of dynamic transmission were mainly perpendicular to and along the river in the foundation rock. Approximately 20 percent of the foundation rock beneath the auxiliary powerhouse was disturbed by the concrete around the spiral case and induced vibrations in the powerhouse’s lower floors. Vibration in the higher floors was derived from downstream rock, and the dynamic transmission effect had a clear advantage along the horizontal direction...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental {{study on the}} interaction of ultrasonic guided waves with delamination in the web-flange interface of a co-cured, co-bonded composite T-joint. A complex interaction of waves is induced, first, by one, and, later, by two piezoceramic wafer(s) bonded on the inner surface of the flange. The flange surface velocity distributions are reconstructed from the scanning laser Doppler velocimeter (LDV) measurements to study {{the effect of a}} delamination overlapping the web-flange interface. The surface-bonded piezoelectric actuator(s) placed remotely on the flange produce primarily anti-symmetric wave incidence to the delamination. A two-stage wave mode conversion process, one due to the web and <b>joint</b> <b>filler,</b> and the other due to the delamination underneath the flange is observed. First, we address the problem of identification of delamination by ultrasonic contrast imaging of the web-flange interface using a single actuator. This study is extended further to enhance the ultrasonic contrast imaging at the web-flange interface using a standing wave. A quantitative methodology based on mode conversion strength is developed to monitor different structural features like free-edge, web-flange interface and delamination. The results show the complex nature of the conversion of flexural waves to in-plane waves through the deltoid and along the web-flange interface. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

Here we report a detailed study on the propagation of guided ultrasonic wave modes in a composite T-joint and their interactions with delamination in the co-cured co-bonded flange. A well designed guiding path is employed wherein the waves undergo a two step mode conversion process, one {{is due to the}} web and <b>joint</b> <b>filler</b> on the back face of the flange and the other is due to the delamination edges close to underneath the accessible surface of the flange. A 3 D Laser Doppler Vibrometer is used to obtain the three components of surface displacements/velocities of the accessible face of the flange of the T-joint. The waves are launched by a piezo ceramic wafer bonded on to the back surface of the flange. What is novel in the proposed method is that the location of any change in material/geometric properties can be traced by computing a frequency domain power flow along a scan line. The scan line can be chosen over a grid either during scan or during post-processing of the scan data off-line.

40|$|Since 2015, {{chemical}} {{weed control}} on public pavements in Flanders has been banned. This necessitates alternative weed control strategies. In this study, growth chamber experiments evaluated the weed suppressive ability of different joint filling materials under various water regimes. The tested materials comprised five unbound standard fillers (white quartz sand, sea sand, limestone 0 / 2 mm, limestone 2 / 6. 3 mm and porphyry 2 / 6. 3 mm) and two innovative materials (Dansand (R) and Eco Fugensand (R)). Their weed suppressiveness was tested in pure and organically polluted states. Germination and biomass accumulation of two weed species that are abundantly found on public pavements (Lolium perenne and Taraxacum officinale) were investigated. Germination and biomass accumulation were lowest in both innovative materials, irrespective of organic contamination level, plant species and water regime. Weed growth in the standard materials was affected by plant species and water regime. Monthly biomass accumulation increased with increasing monthly water supply and number of irrigation days. Furthermore, the materials best capable of reducing weed growth, under all water regimes, even when organically polluted, were the innovative materials and sea sand.

40|$|Based on {{different}} welding parameters, a welding process between mild steel {{and stainless steel}} were performed in this experiment using metal inert gas (MIG) machine. The objective of this experiment {{was to investigate the}} effect of welding voltages (15 V, 20 V and 25 V) wire feed rates (80 ipm and 100 ipm) and filler metals (ER 70 S- 6 and ER 308 L) to the microstructure and mechanical properties of the welded mild steel to stainless steel specimens. The microstructure changes and the mechanical properties result from tensile and hardness test were analyzed and compared between the welded zones, heat affected zone (HAZ) and base metal. From the results obtained the grain size of weld zone and HAZ increases when the welding voltage and wire feed rate increases. The strength of the welded joint was directly proportional to the increasing in voltage and wire feed rate but their hardness value was irreversibly proportional towards the increasing parameter value. Filler metal of ER 70 S- 6 shows better result in hardness test while filler metal of ER 308 L shows better strength in the joint. In conclusion, increasing voltage and wire feed rate will increases the strength but lowered the hardness of the <b>joint.</b> <b>Filler</b> ER 308 L was suitable to be used to increase strength of the joint while filler ER 70 S- 6 was more suitable in increasing the hardness of the joint...|$|E
40|$|Thiokol Propulsion {{encountered}} {{a situation where}} gas path can form in the Filler material in joints between the phenolic in the Space Shuttle Reusable Solid Rocket Motor nozzle. An investigation determined that the method for injecting the filler material into the joint created a pressurized pocket of air that forced {{its way to the}} surface while the filler was curing. The path that the air took remained open some situations leaving a path for hot gas to get deep into the joint. The condition that created the gas path has been corrected by modifications to the manufacturing process, but a design solution that would reduce processing time is being pursued. A strip of open cell installed deep into the joint, can serve as a barrier to the Filler material. Testing indicates that the foam eliminates the pressure pocket, and does not prevent detection of leakage of the o-ring seals during leak test. Open cell foam does not have thermal resistance capability and mechanical structure, which would be required {{in the event of a}} gas path. A replacement to open cell foam is now being considered. Braided carbon fiber rope has the permeability characteristics of foam and it has thermal resistance characteristics as well. Braided carbon fiber rope (BCFR) has been tested in simulated joints in subscale rocket motor.

40|$|A homogenized limit {{analysis}} {{model for}} the prediction of collapse loads and failure mechanisms of masonry walls reinforced with near surface bed joint GFRP bars is presented. Reinforced masonry homogenized failure surfaces are obtained {{by means of a}} compatible identification procedure, where each brick is supposed interacting with its six neighbors by means of finite thickness mortar <b>joints,</b> <b>filler</b> epoxy resin and FRP rods. In the framework of the kinematic theorem of limit analysis, a simple constrained minimization problem is obtained on the unit cell, suitable to estimate – with a very limited computational effort – reinforced masonry homogenized failure surfaces. A FE strategy is adopted to solve the homogenization problem at a cell level, modeling <b>joints,</b> bricks, <b>filler</b> and FRP rods by means of eight-noded infinitely resistant parallelepiped elements. A possible jump of velocities is assumed at the interfaces between contiguous elements, where plastic dissipation occurs. For mortar and bricks interfaces, a frictional behavior with possible limited tensile and compressive strength is assumed, whereas for epoxy resin and FRP bars some formulas available in the literature are adopted in order to take into account in an approximate but effective way, the delamination of the bar from the epoxy and the failure of the filler at the interface with the joint. In order to validate the model proposed, two meaningful examples are critically analyzed. The first relies on a reinforced masonry beam in four-point bending, whereas the second is a full scale wall constrained at three edges and loaded until failure with a distributed out-of-plane pressure. While the first example is useful to test the model at a cell level, since only horizontal ultimate bending moment is involved in the failure mechanism, the second provides a full assessment of the procedure proposed at a structural level. In both cases, very good agreement is found with literature data, meaning that the model proposed may provide useful information for all practitioners interested in the design of masonry walls reinforced with bed joint FRP bars...|$|R

The NGNP will demonstrate the use of nuclear power for electricity, hydrogen production, and process heat applications. The NGNP Project is currently investigating the use of metallic, diffusion welded, compact heat exchangers to transfer heat from the primary (reactor side) heat transport system to the secondary heat transport system. An intermediate heat exchanger will transfer this heat to downstream applications such as hydrogen production, process heat, and electricity generation. The channeled plates that make up the heat transfer surfaces of the intermediate heat exchanger will have to be assembled into an array by diffusion welding. This report describes the preliminary results of a scoping study that evaluated the diffusion welding process parameters and the resultant mechanical properties of diffusion welded joints using Alloy 800 H. The long-term goal of the program is to progress towards demonstration of small heat exchanger unit cells fabricated with diffusion welds.

The butt <b>joint</b> (<b>filler)</b> was injection molded from 20 % short carbon fiber filled with PEKK thermoplastic. The skin and web were co-consolidated together with the butt joint {{in the form of}} a hybrid T-shaped structure. A three point bending (3 PB) set-up was used to investigate the mechanical response of the hybrid composite. The crack initiation and propagation mechanisms for the filler and the delamination at the skin-filler interface were captured using a high speed camera. It was found from the experimental observations that the crack initiated in the filler and then propagated towards the skin-filler interface. A numerical model was also developed using the finite element method in ABAQUS including the crack initiation and growth in the filler together with the delamination at the skin-filler interface. For this purpose the virtual crack closure technique (VCCT) was employed for the crack growth in the filler and the traction separation law was applied at the skin-filler interface using a cohesive surface. The residual stresses and deformations coming from the co-consolidation process were predicted by applying a thermal load and taken into account in the quasi-static analysis. A good agreement was found between the predicted and measured force-displacement curves. The developed numerical model was further employed to address the crack initiation and growth in the filler and delamination at the skin-filler interface using the mix mode effective fracture energies.

40|$|M. Ing. This {{research}} project was initiated by a well-known international company (MAKRO SA), which had experienced floor joint problems occurring in their industrial floors. Floor joint problems i. e. joint damage and spalling {{of the joint}} area result, {{from a combination of}} construction workmanship and quality control problems, as well as from operational hard wheeled vehicle loading conditions. Damaging and spalling of joint edges are general problems occurring on warehouse floor slabs because of hard wheeled loads trafficking joints. In addition, <b>joint</b> <b>filler</b> detachment from the joint wall surface looks aesthetically poor and leaves the possibility of hygienic problems developing. In the case of MAKRO SA stores, the above problems are not acceptable and should be avoided at all costs. The objective of the report is to investigate solutions {{to solve the problem of}} joint damage in industrial floors due to problems occurring in practice, as described below. Floor joint edge problems are a result of three main reasons. First, subsoil quality. The quality of the subsoil is determined by the compaction effort and type of filler materials used, which in turn determine the amount of deflection that will be detected at joint edges. Subgrade quality determines whether deflection of the top concrete layer will occur. Poor compaction and filler material contributes to excessive deflection occurring due to inadequate support of the concrete floor slabs. Water penetration through the floor slab results in the fines of the subsoil being eroded or washed out, resulting in a less dense material, which will deflect under large vehicle and store racking loads. It is concluded that good quality subsoil conditions will result in less deflection and level irregularities of the top concrete floor slab, resulting in less joint damage and spalling. Secondly, the effect of floor and joint workmanship on damage and joint edge spalling. Level irregularities occur due to poor troweling or floating efforts at the joint area. Poor joint edge workmanship results from incorrect formwork removal from the joint wall resulting in a damaged joint edge and additional spalling of the joint to that occurring from wheel load impact. Joints undergo damage as forklifts traffic the joint area as wheel load and energ...|$|E

Where FRP external strips cannot be applied for some reasons, {{the utilization of}} FRP bars embedded near the external surface becomes a very interesting and effective alternative. In this paper, a kinematic Finite Element limit analysis model to predict collapse loads and failure mechanisms of masonry curved structures reinforced with near surface mounted FRP bars regularly distributed is presented. Reinforced masonry homogenized failure surfaces are obtained {{by means of a}} compatible identification procedure, where a central brick is supposed interacting with its neighbors by means of finite thickness mortar <b>joints,</b> <b>filler</b> epoxy resin and FRP rods. In the model, it is required only that the curved structure results from a periodic disposition of bricks, mortar and FRP bars. Therefore, any pattern (multi-leaf, multi-head and single leaf) may be potentially investigated with the procedure proposed. In the framework of the kinematic theorem of limit analysis, a simple constrained minimization problem is obtained on the unit cell, suitable to estimate – with a very limited computational effort – reinforced masonry homogenized failure surfaces. A FE strategy is adopted to solve the homogenization problem at a cell level, modeling <b>joints,</b> bricks, <b>filler</b> and FRP rods by means of 8 -noded infinitely resistant parallelepiped elements. A possible jump of velocities is assumed at the interfaces between contiguous elements, where plastic dissipation occurs.

In order to validate the model proposed, two numerical examples are analyzed, consisting of a circular masonry arch and a hemispherical dome. For both the examples presented, comparisons with experimental evidences, where available, and alternative non-linear FE procedures are reported. Reliable predictions of collapse loads and failure mechanisms are obtained with the model proposed for all the cases analyzed, meaning that the approach may be used by practitioners for a fast and reliable evaluation of the effectiveness of a strengthening intervention...|$|R
40|$|Thirty-one {{years have}} passed since the United States Congress passed the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) [1]. The 1976 law {{essentially}} eliminated future production of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) within the United States and greatly limited the use of previously manufactured PCBs and PCB products. The ultimate objective of the law was the complete elimination of these chemicals due to concerns about their potentially toxic effects on health and the environment. PCBs were manufactured in the United States between 1929 and 1977. They were highly valued for their fire and heat-resistance properties and for their chemical stability. As a result, PCBs were used in a variety of thermally and/or chemically stressful applications. They did not conduct electricity and therefore were particularly well-suited for use as insulating fluids in high-voltage electric equipment. PCBs were also used in various other applications, such as in hydraulic and heat transfer fluids. Strict controls on the use and disposal of PCBs were imposed by the TSCA implementing regulations at 40 CFR 761 [2]. As a result, most heavy users of PCB products worked hard to curtail their PCB use. Many organizations that once used substantial amounts of PCBs, subsequently declared themselves ''PCB free''. Unfortunately, in many cases, these ''PCB-free'' declarations were premature, as PCBs were used in many more applications than insulating fluids. From the 1990 s and to the present day, PCBs increasingly have been discovered in non-liquid forms. These materials were used or installed in facilities constructed before the 1979 ''PCB ban''. Examples include applied paints and coatings, caulking, pre-formed <b>joint</b> <b>filler,</b> and plastic or rubber wire and cable insulation. Proper identification of these materials is necessary for appropriate and compliant waste management during decommissioning and deactivation (D&D) activities. PCBs can pose other significant waste management issues for D&D projects, particularly for nuclear facilities. Depending upon the waste form and the intended disposal path, PCBs can be regulated at thresholds in the low parts-per-billion (ppb). These low regulatory thresholds often are overlooked due to the erroneous belief by many waste management professionals that materials containing PCBs are regulated by TSCA only if their PCB concentration is at least 50 parts-per-million (ppm). Failure to recognize when and how the lower thresholds apply can lead to rejection of the waste materials by treatment, storage and disposal (TSD) facilities as well as potential regulatory non-compliance. Furthermore, re-use of ''excess'' materials with PCBs is also regulated by TSCA. In the event of a characterization error, the costs required to make necessary corrections can be very high. This paper will focus on PCB characterization and waste management issues associated with D&D of DOE nuclear facilities. It will identify PCB materials that are likely to be present in such facilities, with emphasis on the nonliquid PCB forms. The paper will discuss characterization pitfalls associated with Non-Liquid PCBs (NLPCBs), including circumstances in which NLPCBs can migrate into other materials. The paper also will identify TSCA requirements for materials with very low concentrations of PCBs; certain materials are regulated at concentrations as low as 0. 5 {micro}g/L PCBs (approximately 0. 5 ppb). The paper will then examine the potentially extensive impacts to a facility if the materials are not managed in a TSCA-compliant manner. Examples from a recent D&D project at the DOE Savannah River Site will be used to illustrate key points and lessons learned. It is expected that this information would be useful to other DOE sites, DoD installations and commercial nuclear facilities constructed prior to 1979...|$|E

From extensions harsh zone (HZ), soft zone (SZ), rough grain region (HAZRG) and fine grain region (HAZFG) of the heat affected zone obtained by performing microhardness and optical microscopy, better energy ratio was found, which promotes tempering and refining the microstructure of HAZ. Joints of AISI 8630 M and ASTM A 182 F 22 were buttery with energy ratios obtained using the PTA process and filled using the MIG process.

40|$|Abstract. The {{grinding}} {{experiments on}} titanium alloy Ti- 6 Al- 4 V are conducted with monolayer brazed CBN wheels which are manufactured with rare earth Lanthanum modified Ag-Cu-Ti filler. Grinding force and temperature are measured {{as well as}} the topography of wheel surface. Brazed CBN wheels fabricated with Ag-Cu-Ti filler are used for comparison. The results indicate that Lanthanum restrains spread of filler, and keeps the integrity of cutting edges, which increased the sharpness, reduced the grinding force and temperature. Meanwhile, the compounds on the surface of CBN grits are finer and compacter with the addition of Lanthanum, which improves the bonding strength of <b>joint</b> between <b>filler</b> and CBN grits. Lanthanum improves the performance of the brazed CBN wheels while grinding Ti- 6 Al- 4 V...|$|R

40|$|Joining of Si_ 3 N_ 4 to Si_ 3 N_ 4 {{was carried}} out using Ag-Cu filler metal {{containing}} Ti, Zr, V and Nb as an active metal. Bonding treatment was performed at 1173 to 1473 K for 1 h in a vacuum. The shear strengths of the joints brazed at 1173 to 1473 K using active filler metals containing Ti and Zr were 150 to 250 MPa. The fracture position of the joints after shear test was the filler metal or mixture of the filler metal and Si_ 3 N_ 4. On the other hand, the average shear strengths of the joints brazed at 1373 K using active filler metals containing V and Nb were 144 and 163 MPa, respectively. The fracture position of the <b>joints</b> using theses <b>filler</b> metals was the interface between filler metal and Si_ 3 N_ 4 in all cases. The active filler metals containing Ti and Zr yielded TiN and ZrN fine grains close to the Si_ 3 N_ 4. No fine grains were observed in the <b>joint</b> using active <b>filler</b> metal containing V and coarse columnar grains os V_ 3 Si wer observed. Therefore, it is concluded that the fine grains of the nitrides formed close to the Si_ 3 N_ 4 {{is responsible for the}} substantial bonding between filler metal and Si_ 3 N_ 4...|$|R
40|$|The main aims of {{the present}} study are {{simultaneously}} to relate the brazing parameters with: (i) the correspondent interfacial microstructure, (ii) the resultant mechanical properties and (iii) the electrochemical degradation behaviour of AISI 316 stainless steel/alumina brazed <b>joints.</b> <b>Filler</b> metals on such as Ag– 26. 5 Cu– 3 Ti and Ag– 34. 5 Cu– 1. 5 Ti were used to produce the joints. Three different brazing temperatures (850, 900 and 950 °C), keeping a constant holding time of 20 min, were tested. The objective was to understand the influence of the brazing temperature on the final microstructure and properties of the joints. The mechanical properties of the metal/ceramic (M/C) joints were assessed from bond strength tests carried out using a shear solicitation loading scheme. The fracture surfaces were studied both morphologically and structurally using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD). The degradation behaviour of the M/C joints was assessed by means of electrochemical techniques. It was found that using a Ag– 26. 5 Cu– 3 Ti brazing alloy and a brazing temperature of 850 °C, produces the best results in terms of bond strength, 234 ± 18 MPa. The mechanical properties obtained could be explained {{on the basis of the}} different compounds identified on the fracture surfaces by XRD. On the other hand, the use of the Ag– 34. 5 Cu– 1. 5 Ti brazing alloy and a brazing temperature of 850 °C produces the best results in terms of corrosion rates (lower corrosion current density), 0. 76 ± 0. 21 μA cm− 2. Nevertheless, the joints produced at 850 °C using a Ag– 26. 5 Cu– 3 Ti brazing alloy present the best compromise between mechanical properties and degradation behaviour, 234 ± 18 MPa and 1. 26 ± 0. 58 μA cm− 2, respectively. The role of Ti diffusion is fundamental in terms of the final value achieved for the M/C bond strength. On the contrary, the Ag and Cu distribution along the brazed interface seem to play the most relevant role in the metal/ceramic joints electrochemical performance...|$|R

The lap joint of aluminium-galvanize iron was analyzed by using the NDT test, microstructure of joint, tensile test and hardness test. It {{was found that the}} thickness of the IMC layer decreased and the tensile strength of the lap joint increased with the increasing of Si content in the filler metals. The decreasing of the Si content in the filler metals increases the hardness value of samples due to smaller grain size formation. The aluminium that was positioned on {{the upper part of the}} lap <b>joint</b> with <b>filler</b> type Al- 4043 has the optimum mechanical properties with the tensile strength of 76. 59 MPa and the average hardness value of 72 to 82 HV...|$|R
40|$|Mechanical {{properties}} of “cermet-steel ” joints have been studied. Chromium and titanium based cermets were joined using diffusion welding and bonding processes. Several types of interlayers and amorphous filler metals were tested. Vacuum bonded <b>joints</b> using amorphous <b>filler</b> metals have shear strength up to 260 MPa – 350 MPa. The applicability of mechanical metallization process with rotating titanium brushes {{to get a}} thin film on the cermets was tested. Electrochemically and mechanically deposited films of Ag, Ni and Ti were used to improve the wettability and strength of the joints.

50|$|Single {{butt welds}} {{are similar to}} a bevel joint, but instead of only one side having the beveled edge, {{both sides of the}} weld joint are beveled. In thick metals, and when welding can be {{performed}} {{from both sides of the}} work piece, a double-V joint is used. When welding thicker metals, a double-V <b>joint</b> requires less <b>filler</b> material because there are two narrower V-joints compared to a wider single-V joint. Also the double-V joint helps compensate for warping forces. With a single-V joint, stress tends to warp the piece in one direction when the V-joint is filled, but with a double-V-joint, there are welds on both sides of the material, having opposing stresses, straightening the material.|$|R
