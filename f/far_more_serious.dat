This—finally!—philosophically interesting problem appears not, however, to be solvable by purely Bayesian means.

25|$|By AD 17, the Roman proconsul of Africa, Marcus Furius Camillus (II) {{was in a}} quandary. The {{threat to}} his {{province}} was now <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> than the usual border raiding by the desert tribes. But while Tacfarinas relied on hit-and-run raids, he had little effective response. Although his own forces (the 3rd legion and at least {{the same number of}} auxiliaries, totalling ca. 10,000 men) were now greatly outnumbered by Tacfarinas' followers, Camillus decided to capitalise on the Romans' advantages in armour and training by offering Tacfarinas a decisive pitched battle. To this end, he led out into the field most of his force. Tacfarinas felt confident that with superior numbers, his newly modelled army, combining the best elements of Roman and Numidian warfare, was equal to the challenge. His men joined battle with the Romans - and were utterly routed. Tacitus gives no details on how this was accomplished, but later events suggest that the Numidian line was probably broken by the legionary infantry charge. Tacfarinas fled into the desert with the shattered remnants of his army and Camillus was awarded triumphal honours.|$|E
25|$|The {{reign of}} King Æthelred the Unready {{witnessed}} {{the resumption of}} Viking raids on England, putting the country and its leadership under strains as severe as they were long sustained. Raids began on a relatively small scale in the 980s, but became <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> in the 990s, and brought the people to their knees in 1009–12, when {{a large part of}} the country was devastated by the army of Thorkell the Tall. It remained for Swein Forkbeard, king of Denmark, to conquer the kingdom of England in 1013–14, and (after Æthelred's restoration) for his son Cnut to achieve the same in 1015–16. The tale of these years incorporated in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle must be read in its own right, and set beside other material which reflects in one way or another on the conduct of government and warfare during Æthelred's reign. It is this evidence which is the basis for Simon Keynes's view that the king lacked the strength, judgement and resolve to give adequate leadership to his people in a time of grave national crisis; who soon found out that he could rely on little but the treachery of his military commanders; and who, throughout his reign, tasted nothing but the ignominy of defeat. The raids exposed tensions and weaknesses which went deep into the fabric of the late Anglo-Saxon state and it is apparent that events proceeded against a background more complex than the chronicler probably knew. It seems, for example, that the death of Bishop Æthelwold in 984 had precipitated further reaction against certain ecclesiastical interests; that by 993 the king had come to regret the error of his ways, leading to a period when the internal affairs of the kingdom appear to have prospered.|$|E

They pressed the issue in the summer of 1918 and, {{near the end of the}} year, Mayor Andrew Peters offered salary increases that would affect about one-fourth of the officers. O'Meara died in December 1918, and Governor Samuel McCall appointed Edwin Upton Curtis, former Mayor of Boston, as Commissioner of the Boston Police Department. After another meeting where representatives of the Social Club repeated their salary demands, Peters said: [...] "while the word 'strike' was not mentioned, the whole situation is <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> than I realized." [...] He also made it clear to the rank and file that they were not entitled to form their own union. Curtis did not share his predecessor's or the mayor's sympathy for the police, but in February 1918 he offered a wage compromise that the police rejected. In May, Governor Coolidge announced raises, which were also rejected. When the Social Club's representatives tried to raise grievances with him, Curtis set up his own grievance committee to handle management-employee disputes, based on the election of representatives from each precinct house by secret ballot, and it met just once.|$|E

The present proposition {{is an attempt to}} suggest some important changes in provisions that regulate penalization of special recidivism. These are changes which however still do have a chance to be accepted by the parliamentary commission. The propositions in question aim at adapting in a clearer way the purposes and means of statutory penalty to the there different areas of facts resulting in relapse into crime. They also intend to adopt as a basis for punishing the recidivists first of all the character of the last crime committed and the importance of the latter rather than the category itself of perpetrators relapsing in crime. 1. Where more trivial offence is involved and within the scope where tendencies not to decree imprisonment penalties should be dominating - the provision on special recidivism permits the court to increase these penalties without opposing general trends in penal policy. 2. As <b>far</b> as <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> crime is concerned - j u s t for the reason of its importance and of the scale of sanctiofs - the author proposes a confinement to advising the court to take into consideration the relapse into crime when fixing up penalty of deprivation of liberty decided within the framework of statutory punishability. 3. In relation with most serious misdemeanors and their most threatening perpetrators (what more is - expecting badly for the future) the author proposes to apply here the isolating function of the punishment as an exception from the guilt principle which is accepted as a pattern for sentencing. In case of a relapse into the statutory cited crime, the court is legally bound to decree the penalty of deprivation of liberty without conditional stay of the carrying out of a sentence decided. The upper limit of the punishment may be then augmented by a half but may not exceed 15 years.
