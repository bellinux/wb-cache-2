5000|$|Digit {{selectors}} {{were similar}} to emitters, with one exit hub for each cycle point, but they also had an <b>entry</b> <b>hub</b> that was switched to the successive exit hubs as the cycle progressed. A digit selector could be converted to a digit emitter by wiring its <b>entry</b> <b>hub</b> to {{a constant source of}} cycle pulses. But it could also be fed other signals and used to detect a particular digit. Wiring a first read brush to a digit selector's entry and connecting, say, its 4 exit to a pilot selector's D entry would cause that selector to transfer on the next read cycle if a 4 was punched in that first read brush's column.|$|E
5000|$|IBM {{removable}} {{control panels}} ranged {{in size from}} 6 1/4" [...] by 10 3/4" [...] (for machines such as the IBM 077, IBM 550, IBM 514) to roughly one to two feet (300 to 600 mm) on a side and had a rectangular array of hubs. Plugs {{at each end of}} a single-conductor patch cord were inserted into hubs, making a connection between two contacts on the machine when the control panel was placed in the machine, thereby connecting an emitting hub to an accepting or <b>entry</b> <b>hub.</b> For example, in a card duplicator application a card column reading (emitting) hub might be connected to a punch magnet <b>entry</b> <b>hub.</b> It was a relatively simple matter to copy some fields, perhaps to different columns, and ignore other columns by suitable wiring. Tabulator control panels could require dozens of patch cords for some applications.|$|E
5000|$|Selectors {{directed}} a pulse {{from a common}} entry to either of two outputs, depending on whether a relay magnet was energized. Many types of selectors were employed that differed in how the [...] "pickup" [...] relay was energized. In the simplest case, immediate (I) entries, the magnet was energized when a pulse was received and held {{for the remainder of}} the cycle. More complex selectors, called pilot selectors, had a D <b>entry</b> <b>hub</b> that caused the selector magnet to pick up on the next machine cycle, and X <b>entry</b> <b>hub</b> that also delayed but was only triggered by an 11 or 12 pulse. The one-cycle delay was needed because in most cases, by the time a pulse was detected it was too late to reliably take action in that cycle. Co-selectors had only an immediate input, but five sets of contacts and were typically triggered by a pilot selector's coupling exit, hence the names.|$|E
5000|$|Conditional jump [...] - [...] {{the program}} exit code (P field) {{specifies}} a Program exit hub {{on the control}} panel, which has a wire plugged into it and the appropriate Condition selector common hub to be tested, the corresponding two Condition selector output hubs have wires plugged into them and the Program <b>entry</b> <b>hubs</b> specifying the instructions to jump to or the Program advance hub to continue in sequence. Complicated conditions involving many Condition selectors could be wired to execute in a single instruction (e.g., Testing the sign and zero states of multiple accumulators), with one of several Program <b>entry</b> <b>hubs</b> activated.|$|R
5000|$|Multi-way jump [...] - [...] the {{destination}} track (T2 field) {{is set to}} [...] and the appropriate Character selector hubs on the control panel have wires plugged into them and the Program <b>entry</b> <b>hubs</b> specifying the instructions to jump to or the Program advance hub to continue in sequence.|$|R
5000|$|Unconditional jump [...] - [...] {{the program}} exit code (P field) {{specifies}} a Program exit hub {{on the control}} panel, which has a wire plugged into it and, via distributors, to Program <b>entry</b> <b>hubs</b> specifying the first, second and third address digit of the instruction to jump to.|$|R
5000|$|Counter total exits. A counter's Total <b>entry</b> <b>hub</b> caused that {{counter to}} emit total pulses {{which could be}} wired to print positions. After a total was printed, the counter was reset. Special {{circuits}} allowed negative values to be printed correctly, not as nines complements, and a special exit was provided to allow an appropriate symbol ("cr" [...] or [...] "-") to be printed next to the number when it was negative.|$|E
5000|$|Counter entries. An IBM tabulating machine, {{such as the}} 402 or 407 series {{would have}} several {{counters}} available in different sizes. (For example, the IBM 402/403 had four sets each of 2, 4, 6 and 8 digit counters, labeled 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D, 4A, 4B etc.) Each counter had two counter control entries to specify either addition (plus) or subtraction (minus). If neither were pulsed, no operation was performed. If addition was commanded, a digit impulse wired from a column to a counter <b>entry</b> <b>hub</b> started the counter wheel turning. It stopped automatically at zero time. Thus a pulse at 8 time caused the wheel to advance 8 steps, adding the value 8 to that counter position. Carries within a group were performed automatically. Carry in and carry out hubs allowed counters to be coupled, permitting longer numbers to be accumulated. Subtraction was more complicated and used nines complement arithmetic.|$|E
50|$|The {{operation}} of the 407 was directed {{by the use of}} a removable control panel and a carriage tape. Exit hubs (impulse emitting) on the control panel are wired to <b>entry</b> <b>hubs</b> (impulse accepting) for the task to be done (see Wiring of unit record equipment). There are hubs for each card column (at both reading stations), print position, counter digit, and so on. Logic tests were also available.|$|R
5000|$|From Mach number prospective, fluid inside rotor is in {{supersonic}} phase {{except at}} initial <b>hub</b> <b>entry.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Print <b>entries,</b> one <b>hub</b> {{for each}} print position. Impulses to these entries {{controlled}} {{the motion of}} print bars or wheels to place the correct type element under the print hammers. The 407 also had exits from each print wheel that could then feed the counters for addition or subtraction. This insured that totals always matched what was printed.|$|R
5000|$|Punch magnets Machines {{that could}} punch cards, {{such as a}} {{reproducing}} punch, had <b>hub</b> <b>entries</b> for each card column. An impulse {{to one of those}} entries triggered the electromagnet that initiated the punching of a hole at that column position.|$|R
50|$|The {{control panel}} for each machine type {{presented}} exit (output) and <b>entry</b> (input) <b>hubs</b> in logical arrangements. In many places, {{two or more}} adjacent common hubs, would be connected, allowing more than one wire {{to be connected to}} that exit or entry. A few groups of hubs were wired together but not connected to any internal circuits. These bus hubs could be used to connect multiple wires when needed. Small connector blocks called wire splits were also available to join three or four wires together, above the control panel. Several are visible in the photo of an IBM 402 panel.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the responses of}} incumbent hub-and-spoke carriers to low cost carrier (LCC) entry on routes served to and from their hubs over the past decade. Our analysis finds that the typical price and capacity response by incumbent hub-and-spoke carriers to LCC entry has been fairly accommodating. Moreover, our analysis also finds–somewhat surprisingly–that the likelihood of an LCC’s <b>entry</b> into a <b>hub</b> market being successful is unrelated to the relative response of the incumbent...|$|R
50|$|Puerto Williams is {{the port}} of <b>entry</b> and major <b>hub</b> for {{scientific}} activity linked to Antarctica and the islands south of Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego. The University of Magallanes has a university centre in Puerto Williams. Weather stations and lighthouses at Cape Horn and Diego Ramírez Islands are supplied from Puerto Williams. The town has been a base for Chile to assert sovereignty around Cape Horn and support its Antarctic bases.|$|R
5|$|The 1st Sustainment Brigade {{provides}} a full spectrum support including: configuring for, distributions and retrogrades {{to and from}} maneuver Brigade Combat Teams, other support brigades, and to joint interagency and multinational elements as directed. The 1st SB supports Early <b>Entry</b> Operations or <b>Hub</b> operations with augmentation, providing postal, replacement, and casualty operations as well as essential personnel services and Trial Defense Services on an area basis. The brigade is assigned as the sustainment unit of the 1st Infantry Division, however it can also operate independently, being assigned other units and other missions independent of the division.|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} to a new initiative, “Knowledge Exchange” (KE), at The University of Hong Kong (HKU), a collaboration between The HKU Libraries (HKUL) and CILEA created “ResearcherPages” or author profiles to show in addition to publication items in The HKU Scholars Hub (The Hub), the HKU IR, which is hosted in DSpace. The HKU authors were quick to realize the potential these pages have for correctly, or incorrectly, showing their achievements to the public, and very vocally asked that their data be displayed in certain ways and not others. In {{response to}} these requests, we created new methods of display and a limited content management system within The Hub, for HKU authors to actively control their data {{and the ways in}} which it is displayed. Our HKUL Scholarly Communications Team imports most of the data shown in these ResearcherPages from different silos at HKU, and beyond. Our main source of publication data is the HKU Research Output System (ROS). However authors found that this data was many times erroneous or lacking. In order to present a publication list to meet the standards expected by our authors, we import data from Scopus, Web of Knowledge, and others. This required HKUL to design a new system, which CILEA engineered, for de-duplication, that would match incoming <b>entries</b> to existing <b>Hub</b> <b>entries,</b> and then allow a batch process or an operator to choose which incoming data element, say, “subjects”, should overwrite the existing element. These regular imports ensure that ResearcherPages are consistently current, unlike ones usually maintained by individuals or departments. After import, HKU authors can add certain fields such as research interests, or change their picture. However, although they cannot delete or change imported data elements, they can hide any of them. With HKUL design and CILEA engineering, this same function has now been extended to publications in The Hub; allowing HKU authors to hide certain publications, or choose others to appear in a “Selected Publications”. Publications that are marked “hidden”, will still be visible in The Hub, but will not display on the ResearcherPages. Many HKU authors want their more important publications to appear first, and hide less important ones; such as a conference presentation which later became a refereed journal article. Therefore ResearcherPages show publications in this order: i) Selected Publications, ii) Journal articles, iii) Books & book chapters, iv) Conference papers & presentations, v) Patents, and vi) Others. Because The Hub has set up data harvesting and import from many silos, bringing disparate data together in one mash-up, it is now the source for other projects that would also re-use this data. At the request of the HKU Law Faculty, The Hub resends designated data to SSRN’s Legal Scholarship Network, to display there in a branded HKU Law Faculty page of Research Paper Series. The HKU Faculty of Dentistry harvests Hub data to build their own departmental author profiles. The Bibliographic Knowledge Network People (BKNpeople) hosted by UC Berkeley, funded by the US NSF harvests Hub metadata on researchers in mathematics. The Hub displays bibliometrics for each publication, collection, community, and author. The Hub generates and displays view counts and download counts for each of these, and allows RSS and email alerts on these statistics and on content newly added. Users may choose on which publication, collection, community, or author to receive these statistics and content alert, and the time frequency; daily, weekly or monthly. Users may also export publications with or without fulltext, in RIS and other formats, which has proved useful in preparing new grant applications. The Hub also imports and displays article-level and author-centric hyperlinked bibliometrics from Scopus, ResearcherID, Biomed Experts, SSRN, RePEc, ACM Digital Library, MathSciNet, and Mathematics Genealogy Project, with some imports in real time on-the-fly, and others done weekly. In the beginning a handful of authors objected to certain numbers, say the h index from Scopus, being shown on them. As The Hub allows them to hide these individual numbers, while still displaying a hyperlink into the source, these authors were satisfied. Other authors in the humanities and social sciences were not happy with the bibliometrics shown by Scopus or others. For these we created a procedure in which they can use Harzing’s Publish or Perish on Google Scholar data, to gather bibliometrics, and then load into their ResearcherPage. As Google Scholar covers all subjects, includes books and book chapters, and begins from the beginning of time, some HKU authors have chosen to hide Scopus, and show Google Scholar instead. Outsourcing this work to CILEA has been successful. On HKUL’s design, CILEA has quickly engineered an elegant product integrated logically and physically with the original DSpace 1. 6 structure, easily extensible into future releases of DSpace, and easily maintained by existing HKUL staff. This collaboration has allowed HKUL to meet deadlines set by the University’s Office of Knowledge Exchange, without hiring new expert staff. These several features allow reputation management to be done collaboratively by the individual authors and their institution. Individual author reputation management benefits the authors, their university, and their library, which has created and now maintains this reputation management platform. The desire for enhanced reputation by the authors complements and drives The Hub in fulfilling its role as a vehicle of HKU KE, which is to make HKU research and researchers more visible. Greater visibility will result in increased readership, increases in research collaboration, and mutual benefit between HKU and its community in Hong Kong, China, and the world. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
