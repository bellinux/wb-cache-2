50|$|Drugs can undergo {{one of four}} {{potential}} biotransformations: Active <b>Drug</b> <b>to</b> Inactive Metabolite, Active <b>Drug</b> <b>to</b> Active Metabolite, Inactive <b>Drug</b> <b>to</b> Active Metabolite, Active <b>Drug</b> <b>to</b> Toxic Metabolite (biotoxification).|$|R
5000|$|It {{may allow}} other {{indications}} for the <b>drug</b> <b>to</b> be identified. Discovery that sildenafil inhibits phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) proteins, for example, enabled this <b>drug</b> <b>to</b> be repurposed for {{pulmonary arterial hypertension}} treatment, since PDE-5 is expressed in pulmonary hypertensive lungs.|$|R
50|$|The {{mechanisms}} of antiprotozoal drugs differ significantly <b>drug</b> <b>to</b> <b>drug.</b> For example, {{it appears that}} eflornithine, a <b>drug</b> used <b>to</b> treat trypanosomiasis, inhibits ornithine decarboxylase, while the aminoglycoside antibiotic/antiprotozoals used to treat leishmaniasis are thought to inhibit protein synthesis.|$|R
5|$|Heterodimeric {{antibodies}} have {{a greater}} range in shapes they can take and the drugs that {{are attached to the}} arms don’t have to be the same on each arm, allowing for different combinations of <b>drugs</b> <b>to</b> be used in cancer treatment. Pharmaceuticals are able to produce highly functional bispecific, and even multispecific, antibodies. The degree to which they can function is impressive given that such a change shape from the natural form should lead to decreased functionality.|$|E
5|$|His {{frustration}} {{turned to}} depression, and in 1971 Drake was persuaded {{by his family}} to visit a psychiatrist at St Thomas's Hospital, London. He was prescribed a course of antidepressants, but felt uncomfortable and embarrassed about taking them, and tried {{to hide the fact}} from his friends. He knew enough about <b>drugs</b> <b>to</b> worry about their side effects, and was concerned about how they would react with his regular cannabis use.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Malawi's Ministry of Health and Population began {{developing}} {{a plan to}} distribute antiretroviral <b>drugs</b> <b>to</b> the population, and, as of 2003, there were several sites providing antiretroviral drugs in Malawi. The Lighthouse, a trust in Lilongwe that fights HIV/AIDS, provides antiretroviral drugs {{at a cost of}} 2,500 kwacha per month. Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre provides antiretroviral therapy through its outpatient department, and Médecins Sans Frontières distributes antiretroviral <b>drugs</b> <b>to</b> patients for free in the Chiradzulu and Thyolo Districts. Many different private providers sell antiretroviral drugs, particularly in cities; however, very few patients can afford to receive drugs from the private sector in Malawi. In addition, private providers are not currently required to obtain certification before selling antiretroviral drugs, and, therefore, this practice is not closely monitored. Finally, some employees receive access to antiretroviral drugs through the health insurance policies provided by their employers, but this practice is not widespread.|$|E
50|$|Many drugs control blood {{pressure}} by interfering with angiotensin or aldosterone. However, when these drugs are used chronically, the body increases renin production, which drives {{blood pressure}} up again. Therefore, pharmacologists {{have been looking}} for a <b>drug</b> <b>to</b> inhibit renin directly. Aliskiren is the first <b>drug</b> <b>to</b> do so.|$|R

5|$|The Federation {{starship}} Enterprise, {{under the}} command of Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart), brings aboard the elderly Admiral Mark Jameson and his wife Anne (Marsha Hunt) on request of Karnas (Michael Pataki), the Governor of Mordan IV. Karnas warns that a dissident terrorist group has taken a Federation Ambassador and his staff hostage, and demand to speak to a negotiator. Jameson had negotiated a previous settlement on Mordan IV. As the ship travels to Mordan IV, they find that Jameson is becoming stronger and more able to move about on his own, and is no longer showing signs of the terminal Iverson's Disease he was known to have before he was beamed aboard. The crew discovers that Jameson has been taking an array of <b>drugs</b> <b>to</b> reverse the aging process over the last two years, and only recently has taken an overdose of the <b>drugs</b> <b>to</b> prepare himself for the negotiations. Jameson begins to appear younger and full of energy, but has frequent pains {{as a result of the}} overdose. By the time they are nearing Mordan, Jameson now appears as a young adult.|$|E

50|$|Drug {{development}} {{is the process of}} bringing a new pharmaceutical <b>drug</b> <b>to</b> the market once a lead compound has been identified through the process of drug discovery. It includes pre-clinical research on microorganisms and animals, filing for regulatory status, such as via the United States Food and Drug Administration for an investigational new <b>drug</b> <b>to</b> initiate clinical trials on humans, and may include the step of obtaining regulatory approval with a new <b>drug</b> application <b>to</b> market the <b>drug.</b>|$|R

Jasper proposes getting Syd, a camp guard to whom he frequently sells <b>drugs,</b> <b>to</b> smuggle them into Bexhill masquerading as refugees. The Fishes discover Jasper's house, and the group flees while Jasper stays behind to stall the Fishes. Luke brutally murders Jasper as Theo watches from the woods.|$|E
5|$|To further {{improve the}} {{function}} of heterodimeric antibodies, many scientists are looking towards artificial constructs. Artificial antibodies are largely diverse protein motifs that use the functional strategy of the antibody molecule, but aren’t limited by the loop and framework structural constraints of the natural antibody. Being {{able to control the}} combinational design of the sequence and three-dimensional space could transcend the natural design and allow for the attachment of different combinations of <b>drugs</b> <b>to</b> the arms.|$|E

The United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) were investigating the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative (BALCO); the workplace of both Chambers' coach Remi Korchemny and nutritionist Victor Conte. Both men faced charges of distributing illegal <b>drugs</b> <b>to</b> athletes in the United States. The BALCO Scandal uncovered drug use {{in a wide range}} of sportsmen and women, including sprinters Marion Jones and Tim Montgomery.|$|E

5|$|Abra's initial role in {{the show}} was that of Third World rights {{champion}} and humorous surgical , whose major storylines centered on serious rule breaking (including stealing returned anti-retroviral <b>drugs</b> <b>to</b> send to African countries in need, performing an experimental xenotransplantation without authorisation, and secretly using Holby City Hospital's theatres at night to perform charity operations on African children) {{as well as his}} relationship with colleague nurse Kyla Tyson. Upon returning to the show in April 2008, the character took a darker turn, resorting to self-harm as a symptom of post-traumatic stress, following a harrowing experience in the war torn Congo.|$|E
5|$|Despite not testing {{positive}} {{during the race}} or season, the Gewiss-Ballan team has since been speculated to have executed a systematic doping program that utilized EPO throughout the 1994 season. The team achieved several victories in stage races and one-day races during the year, including a sweep of the podium at La Flèche Wallonne weeks {{before the start of}} the Giro. Team doctor Michele Ferrari was banned for life from sports in 2012 by United States Anti-Doping Agency for distribution of performance-enhancing <b>drugs</b> <b>to</b> several of his clients.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the scale}} of the cyclone damage, the {{government}} issued an international appeal for assistance. As a result, the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs provided a grant of $30,000. UNICEF provided about $48,000 to secure drug kits for children impacted by the cyclone. The Red Cross of Seychelles donated about one tonne of clothing and 20tonnes of tuna, and the Red Cross of Réunion sent <b>drugs</b> <b>to</b> Madagascar. The government of France also sent a crew from Réunion to Madagascar to assist in the aftermath, as well as a plane to airdrop the aid. The governments of Germany, Japan, France, the United Kingdom each donated about $100,000 to Madagascar, while the United States provided about $25,000 and 500tons of food. The government of Japan also sent 2,040blankets and 10tents. By February18, the total contributions by the international community reached about $3million.|$|E

One entry noted that Braun owed the clinic between $20,000 and $30,000. Braun's name was not listed next to any specific PEDs, unlike {{some of the other}} players mentioned in the records. Braun released a statement maintaining that his attorneys had retained the clinic's operator, Anthony Bosch, as a consultant during his appeal of his positive drug test the previous season, and denied any further dealings with the clinic.|$|E
5|$|In case {{of failure}} with PVS, {{spermatozoa}} are sometimes collected by electroejaculation: an electrical probe is {{inserted into the}} rectum, where it triggers ejaculation. The success rate is 80–100%, but the technique requires anaesthesia and {{does not have the}} potential to be done at home that PVS has. Both PVS and electroejaculation carry a risk of autonomic dysreflexia, so <b>drugs</b> <b>to</b> prevent the condition can be given in advance and blood pressure is monitored throughout the procedures for those who are susceptible. Massage of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles is another method to retrieve stored sperm. If these methods fail to cause ejaculation or do not yield sufficient usable sperm, sperm can be surgically removed by testicular sperm extraction or percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration. These procedures yield sperm in 86–100% of cases, but nonsurgical treatments are preferred.|$|E
