5000|$|K. Ahmed Khan is an Indian {{scientist}} and businessman who made success in using plastic for road construction. [...] He {{is the founder}} of KK Plastic Waste Management Pvt.Ltd.He along with his brother Rasool Khan,stung by protests to ban plastic, hit upon the idea of recycling plastic and mixing it with bitumen to lay roads. Thanks to their enterprising spirit, they have so far laid almost 1,000 km of roads — Lalbagh Road, Cunningham Road, Old Madras Road and many others — in the city with recycled plastic. RESEARCH & IMPLEMENT Rasool, the director of K K Plastic Waste Management Private Limited, tells Bangalore Mirror how the brothers {{came up with the idea}} of recycling plastic for roads: [...] "In 1996, there were demands for a ban on plastic. Our entire livelihood depended on plastic as we manufacture plastic bags for our company called K K Polyflex. We also had about 100-odd employees working with us. So we thought of researching on alternate uses of plastic." [...] During their research the Khans realised that plastic could be used along with bitumen to make roads. After reading up about Bangalore roads, they thought of laying such roads in the city. In 1996, Rasool (59) made the first trial use of plastic with bitumen. He successfully used the bitumen-plastic mixture to fill about 100-200 potholes on Rajalakshmi Nursing Home Road in Jayanagar. He then asked his son Amjad Khan, who was then studying chemical engineering at RV College of Engineering, to take this up as a research project and also funded it. After two years of research work, Amjad concluded that it was feasible to use bitumen-plastic in laying roads. Next, they needed the approval from experts in highway Engineering. Highway engineering professors Justo and Vir Raghavan from the Bangalore University took special interest in the idea and studied it. Now, they had to get the approval of Central Road Research Institute, Delhi. After a two-year they got the green signal from CRRI. Armed with approvals from all quarters, the brothers met the then Karnataka CM S M Krishna. Thanks to the CM's encouragement, the Khans laid their first plastic waste road in front of Rajarajeshwarinagar front gate in 2002. In the first year of their road work, they were paid Rs 11 lakh by the government. [...] "In 2003-04 we signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the BBMP to lay 250 km of roads," [...] says Rasool. Some of the roads they have laid include Millers Road, Cunningham Road, Old Madras Road, J C Road, Lalbagh Road, almost all roads in Jayanagar, and Mysore Road till Kanakpura Junction. FROM WASTE TO ROAD The company gets approximately five tons of plastic waste every day. It buys plastic waste at Rs 6 per kg from apartments, schools, ITC factory, and pourakarmikas. Rasool says, [...] "We also have our own auto and lorry that picks up plastic waste strewn around the city." [...] The plastic waste thus collected is cleaned and put in a shredder. The shredded bits are then stored in bags for six to seven days to drain out the moisture in them. The shredded plastic is then taken to a <b>hot</b> <b>mixing</b> plant located on the city outskirts, where it is mixed with bitumen to make roads. The bitumen-plastic mix is called K K Poly Blend. Ahmed Khan (61), an alumnus of St Joseph's College of Commerce, says, [...] "Normally the life of a road is about three years. But with K K Poly Blend it increases to about six to seven years. This is because the melting point of bitumen is about 60 to 70 degrees where as plastic's melting point is about 130 to 140 degrees. Moreover, Bangalore generates 5,000 tonnes of solid waste every day, out of which at least 50 tonnes is plastic. If all that plastic waste is used the remaining solid waste can be used to make organic manure." [...] He reasons, [...] "Every day India produces 1,23,000 tonnes of waste, out of which about 2000 tonnes is plastic. If we can use all that plastic, the plastic waste problem can be solved." [...] Their plastic road concept has even attracted attention from the Burmese government and entities in Italy. THE MAKING OF ‘PLASTIC’ ROADS ...|$|E

Although numerous laboratory tests have been developed {{over the last several}} decades, the premature failure of <b>hot</b> <b>mix</b> {{asphalt concrete}} is still prevalent. The failure of <b>hot</b> <b>mix</b> asphalt concrete has always been linked to the failure of test method in consistently and accurately predicting moisture sensitivity. ^ The factor most commonly disregarded is the acceptance criteria of the placed properties of <b>hot</b> <b>mix</b> asphalt concrete. To account for production and construction variability, state highway agencies typically allow a range of <b>hot</b> <b>mix</b> asphalt concrete properties to be acceptable. For instance, 7 percent of voids in total mix are specified but contractor is allowed to place <b>hot</b> <b>mix</b> asphalt concrete within 2. 7 to 9. 9 percent voids in total mix.

Similarly, state highway agencies allow variations in binder content and gradation. Therefore, the influence of binder content and gradation at higher voids in total mix was also evaluated. ^ To achieve objectives of this study, three different aggregate types with two different binders were evaluated.

For tests with smoke, the difficulties raised by the harsh environment involving a <b>hot</b> <b>mixing</b> of gas plus soot and vapor carrying water droplets were circumvented with an original device involving an optical fiber network. Mean infrared transmission was found equal to 12 % for the water mist (with a 25 L/min water flowrate) and 37 % for the sprinkler (with a 91 L/min water flowrate). Fitting the infrared transmission spectra with results obtained using a Monte Carlo simulation provided an estimation of the water volumetric fraction in the spray. It was shown that the better attenuation capability of the water mist is due to two factors: (1) a higher extinction coefficient of the water mist for a given water volumetric fraction due to {{the small size of}} the injected droplets and (2) a higher water volumetric fraction. Opacity measurements in the visible range yielded a measured extinction coefficient in good agreement with an estimation obtained with the Mie theory and the identified water volumetric fraction. Moreover, the water sprays (sprinkler or water mist) was seen to lead to a quick de-stratification of the smoke layer.

40|$|Nanoemulsion {{is one of}} the {{alternative}} nano-lipid delivery systems of lipophilic active ingredients into the human skin in pharmaceutical and cosmetic applications. Palm vitamin E extract is a natural lipophilic active that contains a-, β-,δ-, γ-tocotrienols and a-tocopherol. Palm vitamin E has the potency as an antioxidant for delaying the skin ageing process in cosmetic application, although the skin absorption of palm vitamin E in conventional formulations is considered low. The high lipophilicity of palm vitamin E isomers causes the limitation in the skin permeation. The skin penetration can be enhanced by the loading of palm vitamin E extract in an oil phase of a nanolipid-delivery system such as nanoemulsion. Therefore, the potency of nanoemulsion loaded with palm vitamin E extract was studied. Palm vitamin E extract was loaded in two nanoemulsions prepared by two different techniques and then incorporated into polymeric hydrogels. The skin absorption and pharmacokinetics of vitamin E isomers loaded in nanoemulsion hydrogels were investigated. Liquid chromatography assay method of a-, δ-, γ-tocotrienols and a-tocopherol in various samples of the different stages of this study was successfully validated and revalidated. Nanoemulsion formulations were developed firstly by the formation of lyotropic phase system as a pro-nanoemulsion (nanophase gel) by heat mixing, and secondly by using self nano-emulsifying technique by cold mixing. Two oils were used in the nanoemulsion formulation development; palm oil was formulated as a nanoemulsion by using <b>hot</b> <b>mixing</b> technique and, Nigella saliva oil nanoemulsion was prepared by using cold mixing of self emulsifying system. Palm oil nanoemulsion was formulated with the aid of design experiment as semisolid hydrogel by loading carbomers (Carbopol 934 and 940) and then characterized by the droplet size distribution to determine the best formulation for loading with palm vitamin E extract. The effect of carbomers incorporated in nanoemulsion formulations on the droplet size distribution, semisolid rheology and texture was determined by using expert design experiment to select a stable formulation for permeation studies. The in vitro vitamin E isomers permeation through the polycarbonate membrane was investigated using Franz diffusion cells. The vitamin E isomers permeation through polycarbonate membrane depended on the pore size of membrane and the concentration of Carbopol 940 in nanoemulsion hydrogel formulations. The different formulation of nanoemulsion formulation has not shown any affect on the permeation profiles of vitamin E isomers. Finally, the in vivo skin penetration of a-, δ-, γ-tocotrienols and atocopherol loaded in nanoemulsion hydrogel by topical application on the hairless rat abdominal skin was investigated. The accumulative amount of vitamin E isomers in rat skin epidermis and the bioavailability of vitamin E isomers measured in the rat plasma showed that nanoemulsion hydrogels with small droplets size provided high skin absorption. 8 -tocotrienol in the form of nanoemulsion hydrogel with mean droplet size of l 00 nm was preferably absorbed through the rat skin compared to γ-, octocotrienols and a-tocopherol...|$|E

These calculations validate favorable a priori considerations to the cold techniques, and quantify the environmental benefits regarding conventional <b>hot</b> <b>mix</b> asphalts...|$|R

40|$|The {{modification}} {{process of}} <b>hot</b> <b>mix</b> asphalts in which crumb rubber is initially {{mixed with the}} mineral aggregates before {{the addition of the}} binder is known as dry process. This process has as main advantages the use of conventional mixing plants and, at least in principle, has no limitation of the incorporated rubber content. The aim {{of this paper is to}} study the influence of the incorporated crumb rubber content in the mechanical behavior of dense graded mixes (grade envelope C of Brazilian specification DNER-ES 313 / 97). For this purpose, laboratory tests were carried out to determine the main properties to be used in numerical analyses of a structure of flexible pavement executed with that type of asphalt mixture. The mechanical properties of asphalt <b>hot</b> <b>mixes</b> used in the numerical analysis were determined by laboratory tests (stiffness modulus and fatigue life). The studied asphalt <b>hot</b> <b>mixes</b> were produced with a crumb rubber obtained by the milling process at ambient temperature and a straight binder AC 50 / 70 (classification by penetration). The incorporated rubber content varied from 2 % up to 3, 6 % in relation to the mineral aggregate mixture. For the sake of comparison, a conventional asphalt mixture produced with straight binder AC 50 / 70 and an asphalt-rubber <b>hot</b> <b>mix</b> produced by wet process were also studied. The results showed that the asphalt <b>hot</b> <b>mixes</b> modified with crumb rubber by dry process presented a significant improvement in terms of mechanical behavior in relation to conventional asphalt <b>hot</b> <b>mixes,</b> especially in terms of increase of fatigue life, as can be observed in the numerical analysis performed.
