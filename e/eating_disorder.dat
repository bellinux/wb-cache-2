40|$|Purpose {{of review}} Culture {{has long been}} {{recognized}} as significant to the cause and expression of <b>eating</b> <b>disorders.</b> We reviewed the recent literature about recent trends in the occurrence of <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> in different cultures. Recent findings While historically, <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> were conceptualized as primarily afflicting Caucasian adolescent or young adult women within high-income, industrialized Western Europe and North America, <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> are increasingly documented in diverse countries and cultures worldwide. This study highlights recent trends that reflect the changing landscape of culture and eating disorders: stabilization of the incidence of anorexia nervosa and possibly lower incidence rates of bulimia nervosa in Caucasian North American and Northern European groups; increasing rates of <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> in Asia; increasing rates of <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> in the Arab region; and increasing rates of binge eating and bulimia nervosa in Hispanic and Black American minority groups in North America. Summary The changing face of <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> calls for a new conceptualization of culture in both the emergence and spread of <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> across the globe...|$|R

Medical illnesses that increase obesity risk include several rare genetic syndromes (listed above) {{as well as some}} congenital or acquired conditions: hypothyroidism, Cushing's syndrome, growth hormone deficiency, and the eating disorders: binge <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> and night eating syndrome. However, obesity is not regarded as a psychiatric disorder, and therefore is not listed in the DSM-IVR as a psychiatric illness.

5|$|DKA most {{frequently}} occurs {{in those who}} already have diabetes, {{but it may also}} be the first presentation in someone who had not previously been known to be diabetic. There is often a particular underlying problem that has led to the DKA episode; this may be intercurrent illness (pneumonia, influenza, gastroenteritis, a urinary tract infection), pregnancy, inadequate insulin administration (e.g. defective insulin pen device), myocardial infarction (heart attack), stroke or the use of cocaine. Young people with recurrent episodes of DKA may have an underlying <b>eating</b> <b>disorder,</b> or may be using insufficient insulin for fear that it will cause weight gain.|$|E
40|$|Background: Parents have {{a control}} {{role in the}} {{development}} and treatment of <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> among teenagers. Aim: To compare attitudes, beliefs and behaviors between mothers of patients with <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> and mothers of teenagers without these disorders. Material and methods: Twenty one mother-sibling pairs of adolescents with <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> and 15 pairs of adolescents without this condition, but of similar age, were studied. The <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> inventory (EDI- 2), a self administered questionnaire that includes 91 items, was applied. Results: No differences in any of the subscales of EDI- 2 were observed between mothers of teenagers with or without <b>eating</b> <b>disorders.</b> No differences in perfectionism, maturity fears, impulsivity and interpersonal distrust were observed between adolescents with and without <b>eating</b> <b>disorders.</b> The latter had a lesser drive for thinness and inefficacy. Conclusions: In this sample, no differences in behaviors, attitudes and beliefs about food, were observed between mothers of adolescents with and without <b>eating</b> <b>disorders...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} the second paper for {{comparing}} the "transitional" self-help groups of <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> in Japan with the mature self-help groups for <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> in the West.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{analyzed}} {{the importance of}} exercise frequency on <b>eating</b> <b>disordered</b> behaviors and psychological well-being {{and the ability of}} various exercises, individual, and psychological variables to predict <b>eating</b> <b>disordered</b> behaviors. The following characteristics were measured: <b>eating</b> <b>disordered</b> behaviors, dieting habits, physical activity, goal orientation, social physique anxiety, and self-esteem. The results showed that regular exercise was reported more frequently by males, those with high attraction towards exercise, and adolescents with fewer dieting behaviors. Moreover, adolescents who exercised regularly showed fewer <b>eating</b> <b>disordered</b> behaviors and had more positive psychological functioning. The results also confirmed the importance of various exercises, individual, and psychological variables in predicting <b>eating</b> <b>disordered</b> behaviors. In conclusion, this study validates the importance of regular exercise for promoting psychological well-being and preventing <b>eating</b> <b>disordered</b> behaviors in adolescence...|$|R
40|$|Some studies {{claim that}} <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> have a narcissistic {{character}} and this makes treating <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> difficult. In this study, I {{try to explain}} the narcissism in <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> by previous research. The results indicate that narcissism in <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> is perceived as grandiose and withdrawing from external objects, and that <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> are a form of self-control to satisfy the subject's narcissistic world. However, there are a lack of self, self-insufficiency, {{and the fear of}} being evaluated evaluated by others, behind their narcissism. Furthermore, there is self-alienation in <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> from the perspective of Lacan's mirror stage, so suffers have difficulties concerning themselves with others. Finally, I conclude that because we have a relationship with them as their therapist, {{we have to deal with}} their alienation and our being alienated by them...|$|R

In November 1992, Michael won the case and was awarded $6.8 million by the jury, later reduced to $2 million as Terri was found partly at fault for her condition. After attorneys' fees and other expenses, Michael received $300,000 and $750,000 was put in a trust fund for Terri's medical care. According to Michael, in early 2003 the Schindlers demanded that he share the malpractice money with them.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Studies {{show that}} primary care clinicians {{struggle}} with the assessment and treatment of <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> in adults. There are no known studies examining current practices of clinicians with respect to <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> in children and adolescents. The following study describes the key practices of primary care clinicians in Ontario, Canada, around the screening, assessment, and treatment of <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> in children and adolescents. Method: A 24 -item survey was developed to obtain information from family physicians and psychologists about presenting complaints and current practices related to the assessment and treatment of <b>eating</b> <b>disorders.</b> Results: Findings {{of this study suggest}} that despite discipline-specific differences, a large proportion of clinicians do not routinely screen for <b>eating</b> <b>disorders,</b> and when <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> are assessed and treatment is initiated, family members are not routinely involved in the process. Conclusion: In Ontario, primary care clinicians may benefit from more training and support to better identify and treat children and adolescents with <b>eating</b> <b>disorders.</b> In particular, clinicians may require additional training around screening, multi-informant assessment methods, as well as appropriate therapy techniques.

40|$|The {{present study}} was, first, aimed at {{examining}} {{the relationship between}} <b>eating</b> <b>disorders,</b> feminine gender role stress {{and other types of}} stress. In addition, we investigated whether <b>eating</b> <b>disordered</b> women compared to non-clinical controls use depressogenic coping more often. We hypothesized that women with <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> would, compared to controls, suffer from more stress, irrespective of the type of stress, and that they would use depressogenic coping more frequently. Participants were 36 women suffering from <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> (mean age 25. 8 years) and 53 controls (mean age 21. 2 years). Questionnaires were administered reflecting the presence (or absence) of anorexia nervosa and/or bulimia nervosa, feminine gender role stress, perceived life stress, and coping styles. Compared with controls, <b>eating</b> <b>disordered</b> women reported higher levels of feminine gender role stress, but also higher levels of masculine gender role stress as well as recently experienced stress. Stress in general rather than femininity-related stress exclusively was related to <b>eating</b> <b>disorders.</b> In addition, women suffering from <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> used emotional coping more often than the control group. We tend to conclude that not their relatively high stress levels are constitutive for <b>eating</b> <b>disorders,</b> but rather a specific way of coping with negative emotions, emotion-focused coping by means of emotional eating. ...|$|R
