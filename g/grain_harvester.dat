5000|$|Stimpson {{was born}} in 1870 on a farm west of Mooreville. In 1892 {{he got his first}} patent, a {{mechanism}} to lower the wheels of a <b>grain</b> <b>harvester.</b> At that time he was a graduate of Cleary Business School and he was teaching school. That same year, he noticed a local grocer frustrated by the scales which were so complicated in figuring out the price of the product. Stimpson spent some time with the blacksmith tools at his father's farm, and tinkered on an old scale. He came up with a revolutionary idea for a [...] "computing scale." [...] Stimpson's ideas to improve scales made a tremendous impact on industry in the US and worldwide because business depends on accurately knowing how much is being bought or sold. He developed scales for large items such as farm scales, such as a wagon full of pumpkins, a cow, or a load of coal. He built a Stimpson factory in Milan on Plank Road at Dexter Road, later the Ideal Foundry. He worked on scales to weigh small items such as envelopes, for postage; candy; or diamonds. In about 1903, Stimpson built a fantastic and imposing brick hotel in downtown Milan, the Stimpson Hotel. The Italianate-style building was later known in Milan as the Danube Inn. It is no longer standing, having been destroyed by fire in 2011. Stimpson set up factories early in his career in Tecumseh, MI; Northville, MI; Detroit; and Elkhart, IN. He settled finally in Louisville, KY. One of Stimpson's Detroit companies eventually merged with a company involved with clocks and a company dealing in cash registers, called the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company. That company later changed its name to International Business Machines or IBM. In later years, customers of Stimpson Scales, if they needed parts for their scales, contacted IBM as the successor corporation. Stimpson was living in Louisville in 1941 when he died. He left behind a widow and a large, modern factory making coffee grinders, meat slicers, and of course scales.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{main issue}} in the joint {{operation}} of a <b>grain</b> <b>harvester</b> and a transport vehicle is determining {{the moment when the}} vehicle has to start travelling to the harvester, so that it will arrive at it when the hopper is full. The result of the incorrect determining of that moment is that the productivity of the transport vehicle is not efficiently used and in the case when the hopper is unloaded at a harvester stantstill position, the harvester productivity is also reduced due to more frequent stops. The article proposes a method for determining the part of the <b>grain</b> <b>harvester</b> hopper volume after the filling of which the signalling shall be switched on indicating to the vehicle driver when to start moving toward the harvester. The results of real measurements are shown on different farms of the time of movement of the vehicle to the harvester for unloading.

The field tests {{were carried out}} in two years. The variety of the experimental winter wheat was Jingdong 12, and the test area was divided into 60 zones with 5 m× 5 m grids. The sampling point was put {{in the center of}} the zone, and the depth of the sampling point was 5 cm. Soil EC was measured by a DDB- 307 EC meter, and the winter wheat yield data were provided by a CASE 2366 <b>grain</b> <b>harvester</b> with GPS receiver. Gray theory were used to analyze the gray relation between soil EC value and each of other soil parameters, such as total nitrogen content, K[*]+[*]、NO_ 3 ^ - and pH of soil. Results showed that there were high gray relation between soil EC and three other indexes, total nitrogen content, K[*]+[*], pH of soil. Since soil organic horizons had high correlation with soil negative charge capacity, when soil had more organic horizons, there were more soil negative ions, and the soil EC was higher. Hence, the gray relation between K[*]+[*]and EC was high. Using nitrogen fertilizer could removal caution from soil, and increase the content of K[*]+[*],Na[*]+[*], Ca 2 [*]+[*]and Mg 2 [*]+[*], so that there was also high correlation between total nitrogen content and EC. The reason of high correlation between EC and soil pH was attributed to that the change of pH had influence on negative charge. After analyzing the correlation between winter wheat yield and soil EC, total nitrogen content, K[*]+[*], NO_ 3 ^ -, pH of soil in different growth period respectively, two prediction algorithms of yield were proposed, Least Square-Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) and Fuzzy Least Square-Support Vector Machine (FLSSVM). LSSVM prediction model took soil EC, total nitrogen content and K[*]+[*] as the input factors and winter wheat yield as output. While FLSSVM prediction model took soil EC, nitrogen content, K[*]+[*] and gray relation as input factors and also winter wheat yield as output. Results showed that the prediction and validation R 2 of LSSVM model were 0. 772 and 0. 685 respectively. Prediction R 2 of FLSSVM was 0. 8625, and validation R 2 of FLSSVM model was 0. 8003. FLSSVM used Fuzz Similar Extent to fuzz input samples so that it could avoid over-training. Also because it was based on membership function, it had several advantages such as simple structure, efficient convergence, precise forecasting, and etc. FLSSVM had high accuracy prediction result and could be used in estimating yield and providing theory and technical support for precision management of crops...|$|E

40|$|The V-belt {{drive is}} a rather popular, widely used form of power {{transmission}} in agricultural and food industry engineering. At the same time, its stability, the lifetime of V-belt is influenced by several environmental factors, namely in the food industry by the contamination affecting the belt sides, the ambient temperature, humidity and the occasionally aggressive (acidic, alkaline air, air saturated with gases, etc.) medium. In the case of agricultural machinery, the vibration caused by uncertainly oriented pulleys with bearing in different plate structures (often being shaken in the fields) as well as alignment adjustment inaccuracies jeopardize {{the reliability of the}} parameters of the drive. Furthermore, the efficiency is determined by several factors together: the slippage occurring during drive transmission, the hysteresis loss resulting from the external and internal friction occurring with the belt entering and exiting the pulley. Experimental equipment and calculation methods were developed to determine the dynamics of temperature increase generated by the belt and pulley relationship. The temperature generated in the V-belt was measured as a function of pretension, pulley diameter and bending frequency. The so-called damping factor characterizing the contact with the pulley (the external friction when entering and exiting the groove) and the hysteresis loss (inner friction) are also determined. On the basis of the damping factor (ζ ≈ 400 Ns/m 2) of the V-belt involved in the experiments the other losses (P oth) occurring from the pulley—V-belt contact and internal friction may be estimated. The drive parameters may be optimized with the mathematical model describing the effect of the pulley diameter and belt frequency on the increase in temperature. A standardized calculation method as well as design factors valid for the properly adjusted drive and normal operating conditions determined through empirical and laboratory experiments are used for the sizing of V-belt drives. The lifetime of V-belt drives designed in this way, used in extreme conditions typical of agricultural machinery will not be appropriate and will not provide clear, predictable information for maintenance planning. In such cases the results of our own many lifetime tests conducted in the given circumstances can be safely relied on. The agricultural harvesting machines are large plate-body self-propelled structures on which most of the power supply of the (threshing, cleaning, moving, etc.) machine units handling the crop is realized via belt drives. The distance and angular displacement of the axes involved in the drive can vary within wide limits. The misalignment and angular displacement of the pulleys can be the result of installation instability — due to the plate structure — and the deformation of the plate structure occurring during the operation as well. V-belt drives operate satisfactorily under such conditions as well, however these faults are unfavourable in terms of belt lifetime and result in the reduction of drive efficiency. A further aim of our research is to examine through experiments the lifetime and efficiency of V-belts used in agricultural machines as a function of drive adjustment errors. According to the results of the measurements of the geometrical adjustment errors of V-belt drives performed in the field, the pulleys of agricultural equipment are not always positioned in the medium plane of the drive. In our experiments these data served as independent variables. Figure 1 shows the arrangement of a V-belt drive in a <b>grain</b> <b>harvester</b> with the laser pulley alignment measuring instrument installed as an accessory. In the case of many machine types in 80 % of the tested drives three times the permissible error was measured, and because of off-road use, due to dynamic load these errors further increased {{as a result of the}} frame deformation. The results of both the belt bending testing and the geometrical adjustment testing of the drive offer great help in the design of belt drives. At the same time they can be the source of lifetime and efficiency forecasts...|$|E

The Krasnodar region has considerable experience in agriculture in the preceding period. The article discusses the process of creating the material and technical base in the Kuban, and the reasons for insufficiently effective use of technology in 1960 - 1980. The main attention is paid to changes in the logistics that have influenced the production and processing of agricultural products. In this period covering four five-year plans, there had been a significant transformation in strengthening the material-technical base of agriculture, as well as observed changes in social conditions, created for mechanics and their families. Measures developed by the March Plenum of the CPSU Central Committee in 1965, contributed to the strengthening of material and technical base of collective and state farms. Comprehensive mechanization of grain production of cereal crops was completed in the eighth plan period. As a result, the cost of labour in the production of a hundredweight of grain in the kolkhozes was reduced. In the ninth five-year on Kuban the growth of equipment of the collective farms and state farms caused the increase of expenses on its maintenance. Therefore, the issues of radical improvement of machinery and equipment utilization occupied an important place in the decision of problems of agriculture efficiency increase. Significant increases in the cost of one tractor, the <b>grain</b> combine <b>harvester</b> and other agricultural machinery, and the cost of repair led to the fact that farms in the region raise steadily the cost of one conventional hectare of completed work. Various reasons for insufficiently effective use of technology in the country received coverage in a number of scientific publications, however, the organization of MTB use, maintenance and repair and storage of machinery in agriculture and the supply of collective and state farms in the Kuban region in 1960 - 1980 have not been studied. Therefore, the aim {{of this article is to}} explore them...|$|R
50|$|For {{production}} agriculture, {{past and}} present, two-wheel tractors accept {{a wide range}} of implements, such as the following: For soil-working: rototillers, moldboard plows, disc-plows, rotary plows, root/tuber harvesting plows, small subsoiler plows, powered and non-powered harrows, seeders, transplanters, and planters. Even zero till/no-till planters and seeders have become available. In plant protection and weed control, two-wheel tractor implements consist of various inter-cultivators and sprayers. For harvesting, available implements are: Forage: Sickle bar mowers, disk mowers, hayrakes, hay tedders, haybalers and bale wrappers silage production. For <b>grain</b> harvest: reaper/grain <b>harvesters,</b> reaper-binders, and even combine harvesters are available typically only for Asian two-wheel tractors. For transport, trailers with capacities from 0.5 to 5 plus ton cargoes are available. General mowing implements consist of lawn mowers, brush mowers, and flail mowers. For snow removal, implements consist of snowblowers, power sweepers, and snow/dozer blades. Other implements include: chipper/shredders, log splitters, electrical generator, pressure washer, crimper-roller, fertilizer/salt/lime spreader, and stump grinder. This list of implements (which may not be complete) means that two-wheel tractors can execute practically all of the chores done by larger 4-wheel tractors, with the exception of items like front-loaders, which obviously have the physical stability requirements of a 4-wheel (two-axle) tractor.|$|R
5000|$|Grain Mass flow is most {{commonly}} measured using a load cell with an impact plate {{attached to the}} load cell located {{at the top of}} the clean grain elevator. As the clean grain elevator paddles rotate around the top of the clean grain elevator, the grain is expelled from the elevator by centrifugal force and makes contact with the impact plate attached to the load cell. [...] The force applied by the grain is converted to an electrical signal by the load cell that is used to estimate the mass flow of the grain. A calibration of the sensor to develop a relationship of the amplitude of the electrical signal to grain mass flow and is calibrated on a harvester specific basis with the grain mass reported on a wet basis. This technology was developed and first commercialized by Ag Leader Technology. [...] The clean grain elevator speed is also measured and used in the calibration from electrical signal to mass flow as the elevator has a direct impact on the amount of force applied to the impact plate and load cell. This is the most common method for measuring <b>grain</b> flow in <b>harvesters</b> today and exists in different variations.|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} {{primarily}} concerned with the working career of John Ridley (1806 - 1887), and with his contributions to the flour-milling industry of South Australia, to wheat harvesting technology, and to {{the progress of the}} colony generally. Ridley emigrated to South Australia from the north of England in 1840, and remained there until early 1853. Although still a relatively young man, he then returned to England to live in semi-retirement. The following text will show that Ridley contributed substantially to the technical and economic progress of the young- colony in at least two separate ways :- (i) He built the first flour-mill in South Australia in the year 1840, and subsequently operated it as a very successful business until he left the colony in 1853. The mill was steam-driven, of substantial capacity for the time, and of considerable economic significance to the colony. The local flour-milling industry which grew up soon afterwards freed the colony from crippling expenditures for imported flour and other breadstuffs, thus permitting a sound local economy to be developed. During 1842 Ridley leased a second (inoperative) flourmill near Adelaide, completely refitted it, and brought it too into successful operation. As well as helping to alleviate the financial difficulties of the colony at the time, these two mills provided a timely stimulus to local wheat growing. Ridley exerted a considerable influence upon the early development of South Australia's flour-milling industry, by virtue of the high standards for efficiency, operating reliability, and sound profitability he established in his own businesses. The competitors he attracted were forced to achieve similarly high standards in order to survive. His work was thus of importance in helping to secure a sound base for the future growth of the industry. (ii) In late- 1843 Ridley invented, constructed, and demonstrated a unique mechanical <b>harvester</b> for gathering <b>grain</b> crops. This machine, later known as the "Ridley Reaper" or the "South Australian Stripper", was subsequently manufactured and used in thousands within the colony. For {{more than half a century}} the machine played a major part in stimulating wheat production in the region by providing the simplest and cheapest harvesting method in the world at that time. Ridley's invention embodied a principle of operation which was entirely novel at the time it was introduced. In the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries this same principle was incorporated into the designs of many other widely used <b>grain</b> <b>harvesters.</b> Ridley's machine therefore occupies an important place in the evolution of modern grain-harvesting machinery. The first two machines (both built by Ridley) were directly responsible for averting a serious harvesting crisis in South Australia at the 1843 - 44 season. Afterwards, when ever-increasing numbers of the machines went into service, a dramatic expansion of the colony's wheat-growing industry became possible. This in turn led to the development of a large export trade in wheat, and thus to an enviable economic prosperity for the colony. Whilst there is unanimous agreement that Ridley constructed and demonstrated the first successful machine of the "Stripper" type, his claim to have also invented the principle of its operation has been disputed. John Wrathall Full, another. pioneer South Australian settler, insisted that he and not Ridley originated the fundamental principle. In fact, he directly accused Ridley of stealing his idea and putting it into practice. The resulting controversy is examined in detail, and Bull's claim shown to be falsely based. Two further points of historical interest are also made and substantiated. Firstly, the "Stripper" was the first ever harvesting machine to successfully combine the operations of gathering and threshing the grain. And secondly, Ridley's "Stripper" was the first machine in the world to substantially displace hand-methods of cereal harvesting in its region. In the light of all the above considerations, it is suggested that Ridley's machine has not received either fair or sufficient notice in the histories of agricultural technology published to date. John Ridley's importance in the story of the development of mechanical harvesting has thus been unjustly neglected. Restricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|R
40|$|Farm {{injuries}} {{have long}} been recognized as an im-portant health problem encountered by rural physicians. 1 – 3 These injuries are especially notable be-cause of their frequency, their patterns of recurrence 4 – 6 and the severe trauma that often results (unpublished data). In this article we analyse agri-cultural injuries occurring during the harvest season in Canada and {{provide an overview of}} the harvest-related injuries resulting in death or admission to hospital, as well as problems treated in the outpatient setting. Methods The data for this study were re-trieved from existing registries that form part of the Canadian Agricul-tural Injury Surveillance Program: the Canadian registry of fatal farm injuries (for 1991 – 1995), 7 the On-tario registry of injuries caused by farm machinery and resulting in ad-mission to hospital (for 1985 – 1994) 8 and data from the Manitoba De-partment of Labour database (for 1994 – 1996) for a sample of physi-cian clinics in Manitoba. For farm injuries resulting in death or admission to hospital, we defined “harvest-related injuries ” as those involving the most common agents of acute traumatic injury associated with the har-vest (i. e., tractors, power take-offs, balers, combines and <b>harvesters,</b> <b>grain</b> augers, conveyers and elevators, and farm wagons) and occurring in the months of July to November inclusive. From the data provided in the reg-istries, we could not identify all injuries related to har-vest tasks, so we had to limit our analysis to injuries caused by certain types of farm machinery. Because of differences in coding for the dif-ferent registries, a slightly differ-ent definition was used for outpa-tient cases: all injuries resulting from agricultural activities be-tween July and November. Our intention was to provide examples of the types and patterns of harvest injury and the specific diagnoses 9 that are likely to be ob-served in various clinical situa-tions. Our approach was therefore descriptive...|$|R
