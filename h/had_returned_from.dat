5|$|The 1919 {{season began}} with high expectations; World War I was over, and key players <b>had</b> <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> service. However, things {{did not go}} Warner's way; at the {{beginning}} of the season, problems with the offensive line and on the flanks became apparent. Their first defeat was at Syracuse, where the Orangemen won 20–3. The 1919 Panthers had six wins, two losses and one tie.|$|E
5|$|Tho was apprehended {{during the}} coup and put {{under house arrest}} while the {{plotters}} consolidated their grip on power; he was then removed from the political scene.

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1940, SS-Nordland and SS-Westland {{had become}} {{the basis for the}} {{formation}} of the fourth division, SS-Division Wiking. Casting about for another source of recruits, Berger struck upon the idea of enlisting convicted criminals, who were concentrated in the Sonderkommando Dirlewanger, commanded by Berger's friend, Dirlewanger. Dirlewanger <b>had</b> <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> Spain and been reinstated as a SS-Standartenfuhrer der Reserve in the Allgemeine SS at Berger's instigation. In September 1940, Dirlewanger's unit had been deployed to the area of occupied Poland, where they established defensive positions and provided guards for a Jewish labour camp.|$|E

5|$|Dr Sadiq Alekry, a 44-year-old plastic surgeon, voluntarily {{offered his}} {{services}} at the roundabout {{on the evening of}} 16February, shortly after he <b>had</b> <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> Houston. According to Human rights watch, Alekry along with other staff were wearing special medical jackets showing the Red Crescent. During the raid, riot police attacked his tent and cut through it; despite telling them he was a physician, police handcuffed him from his back and a number of security officers repeatedly punched, kicked and hit him with sticks on his head {{and other parts of the}} body.|$|E
5|$|In 653 {{or early}} 654, after Anna <b>had</b> <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> exile, Penda {{was able to}} direct a {{military}} assault upon the East Angles. The Mercian and East Anglian armies fought at Bulcamp (near Blythburgh in Suffolk), where Anna and his son were slain and the East Anglian army was slaughtered in large numbers. Æthelhere then succeeded his brother as Penda's client-king, although Barbara Yorke has suggested that Æthelhere and his surviving brother Æthelwold may have reigned jointly, as Bede separately refers to both men as Anna's successor.|$|E
5|$|On 15 May 1971, the DISCOM was reorganized and {{designated}} as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 1st Cavalry Division Support Command. Most major subordinate {{units of the}} DISCOM <b>had</b> <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> Vietnam in 1971 and were stationed at Fort Hood. By the end of June 1971, the DISCOM was a large command composed of HHC, Support Command, 15th Adjutant General Company/Band, 15th Medical Battalion, 15th Supply and Transport Battalion, 27th Maintenance Battalion, 8th Engineer Battalion, 315th Composite Support Battalion, 15th Finance Company (the latter two units had been transferred from the 1st Armored Division), and the 15th Data Processing Unit.|$|E

5|$|The maindeck of Chesapeake {{was almost}} deserted, having been swept by Shannons gunfire; the {{surviving}} gun crews had either {{responded to the}} call for boarders or had taken refuge below. Two American officers, Lieutenant Cox (who <b>had</b> <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> carrying Captain Lawrence down to the surgeon) and Midshipman Russell saw that the aftmost 18-pounders on the port side, still bore on Shannon and working between them managed to fire both.|$|E
5|$|The {{training}} of B-29 aircrews and {{the testing of}} prototype atom bombs was the last major contribution of Wendover Field during World War II. After war's end, some crew training continued, but at a reduced level. For a while, B-29s which <b>had</b> <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> the Marianas were flown to Wendover for storage. In the summer of 1946, the Ogden Air Technical Service Command at Hill Army Air Field north of Salt Lake City assumed jurisdiction over all operations at Wendover Field except engineering and technical projects.|$|E

5|$|In February 1943, Lieutenant General Walter Krueger's Sixth United States Army {{headquarters}} {{arrived in}} Australia. Since Sixth Army would {{do all the}} planning, and there was as yet little scope for corps-sized operations, Eichelberger found himself with a training role, preparing the 24th Infantry Division, which had arrived from Hawaii, and the 32nd and 41st Infantry Divisions, which <b>had</b> <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> Papua, for future missions. The War Department asked in May 1943 if Eichelberger could be released to command the First United States Army, but MacArthur would not release him. Later, it {{asked if he could}} be released to command the Ninth United States Army, but this was also refused, and this job went to Eichelberger's West Point classmate William H. Simpson. Instead, he was given responsibility for Eleanor Roosevelt's visit to Australia in September 1943. She visited Sydney and Melbourne, and had dinner with the Governor General of Australia, Lord Gowrie, and the Prime Minister of Australia, John Curtin, in Canberra.|$|E
5|$|Known as Double Seven Day, July 7 was {{the ninth}} anniversary of Diệm's 1954 {{ascension}} to Prime Minister of the State of Vietnam. In October 1955, following a fraudulent referendum, Diệm established the Republic of Vietnam, generally known as South Vietnam, and declared himself President. The night of July 6, 1963, had started in a festive mood as Diệm awarded decorations to military officers at a ceremony. Among {{those in the}} audience were Generals Trần Văn Đôn and Dương Văn Minh, the Chief of Staff of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam and the Presidential Military Advisor, respectively. They <b>had</b> <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> observing SEATO military exercises in Thailand, {{where they had been}} informed about the regional disquiet over Diem's policies towards the Buddhists.|$|E
5|$|Laurie Mains <b>had</b> <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> South Africa {{to coach}} Otago in the 2001 National Provincial Championship (NPC), and was {{appointed}} the Highlanders coach for 2002. Their season {{started with a}} narrow 30–28 loss to the Crusaders at Jade Stadium. That year the Highlanders also achieved a win over all four South African teams. The Gordon Hunter Memorial Trophy was also introduced that season to be contested between the Highlanders and Blues. Gordon Hunter had coached both teams before dying from cancer in 2001. The match was played at Eden Park, and the Highlanders were ahead 15–3 at half time, and eventually won 20–13. Their last home match of the season was against the Reds at Carisbrook. The Highlanders' 40–26 win meant that they had gone three seasons undefeated at Carisbrook. The Highlanders finished fourth and played the Crusaders in Christchurch where they lost 34–23, although Jeff Wilson did score a try in his last match for the franchise.|$|E

5|$|On 7 September La Fleche {{ran in the}} St Leger on a wet day at Doncaster. Orme, who <b>had</b> <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> his {{problems}} to win the Eclipse Stakes started favourite, with La Fleche, ridden on this occasion by John Watts, strongly supported at 7/2. Watts settled the filly {{in the early stages}} as Orme set off in front. Just after the turn into the straight, La Fleche, travelling strongly, moved alongside her stable companion and then pulled clear. She won easily by two lengths from the fast-finishing Sir Hugo, with Orme fading into fifth. On 24 September, La Fleche ran against older and younger horses in the £10,000 Lancashire Plate over one mile at Manchester Racecourse. Ridden by Barrett, she tracked the leaders until the straight, where she accelerated impressively to win by three lengths from Orvieto, with Sir Hugo unplaced.|$|E
5|$|The King, {{weakened}} by illness, became progressively less {{active in the}} last years of his reign, devoting an increasing amount of time to prayer, as did his aging mother, who <b>had</b> <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> Poland in 1374. These circumstances allowed Elizabeth to assume a more prominent role at court. Her influence had grown steadily since she had given her husband heirs. It appeared probable that the crowns would pass to one of Elizabeth's underage daughters and by 1374, their rights were confirmed. Behind the scenes, Elizabeth began ensuring that the succession would be as smooth as possible by encouraging a slow but decisive change in the personnel of the government. Warlike and illiterate barons were gradually replaced by a small group of noblemen who excelled in their professional skills but were not distinguished by birth or military ability. Palatine Nicholas I Garai led the movement and enjoyed the full support of the Queen, and their power eventually became virtually unrestricted.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of the}} Orient Express {{came from}} two sources: Fleming <b>had</b> <b>returned</b> <b>from</b> the Istanbul conference in 1955 by the train, but found the {{experience}} drab, partly because the restaurant car was closed. He also knew {{of the story of}} Eugene Karp and his journey on the Orient Express: Karp was a US naval attaché and intelligence agent based in Budapest who, in February 1950, took the Orient Express from Budapest to Paris, carrying a number of papers about blown US spy networks in the Eastern Bloc. Soviet assassins were already on the train. The conductor was drugged and Karp's body was found shortly afterwards in a railway tunnel south of Salzburg. Fleming had a long-standing interest in trains and, following his involvement in a near-fatal crash in 1927, associated them with danger; they also feature in Live and Let Die, Diamonds Are Forever and The Man with the Golden Gun.|$|E
