6000|$|Conceive, Tresham, an {{extensive}} range of low-browed, dark, and twilight vaults, such as {{are used for}} sepulchres in other countries, and had long been dedicated to the same purpose in this, a portion of which was seated with pews, and used as a church. The part of the vaults thus occupied, though capable of containing a congregation of many hundreds, bore a small proportion to the darker and more extensive caverns which yawned around what may be termed the inhabited space. In those waste regions of oblivion, dusky banners and tattered escutcheons indicated the graves {{of those who were}} once, doubtless, [...] "princes in Israel." [...] Inscriptions, which could only be read by the painful antiquary, in language as obsolete as the act of devotional charity which they employed, invited the passengers to pray for the souls of those whose bodies rested beneath. Surrounded by these receptacles of the last remains of mortality, I found a numerous congregation engaged in the act of prayer. The Scotch perform this duty in a standing instead of a kneeling posture--more, perhaps, to take as broad a distinction as possible from the ritual of Rome than for any better reason; since I have observed, that in their family worship, as doubtless in their private devotions, they adopt, in their <b>immediate</b> <b>address</b> to the Deity, that posture which other Christians use as the humblest and most reverential. Standing, therefore, the men being uncovered, a crowd of several hundreds of both sexes, and all ages, listened with great reverence and attention to the extempore, at least the unwritten, prayer of an aged clergyman,* who was very popular in the city.|$|E

50|$|A stored-program design {{also allows}} for self-modifying code. One early {{motivation}} for such a facility was {{the need for a}} program to increment or otherwise modify the address portion of instructions, which had to be done manually in early designs. This became less important when index registers and indirect addressing became usual features of machine architecture. Another use was to embed frequently used data in the instruction stream using <b>immediate</b> <b>addressing.</b> Self-modifying code has largely fallen out of favor, since it is usually hard to understand and debug, as well as being inefficient under modern processor pipelining and caching schemes.|$|R

50|$|The {{purpose of}} autonomation {{is that it}} makes {{possible}} the rapid or <b>immediate</b> <b>address,</b> identification and correction of mistakes that occur in a process. Autonomation relieves the worker of the need to continuously judge whether the operation of the machine is normal; their efforts are now only engaged when there is a problem alerted by the machine. As well as making the work more interesting this is a necessary step if the worker is to be asked later to supervise several machines. The first example of this at Toyota was the auto-activated loom of Sakichi Toyoda that automatically and immediately stopped the loom if the vertical or lateral threads broke or ran out.|$|E
5000|$|The {{contents}} of an index register {{is added to}} (in some cases subtracted from) an <b>immediate</b> <b>address</b> (one {{that is part of}} the instruction itself) to form the [...] "effective" [...] address of the actual data (operand). Special instructions are typically provided to test the index register and, if the test fails, increments the index register by an immediate constant and branches, typically to the start of the loop. Some instruction sets allow more than one index register to be used; in that case additional instruction fields specify which index registers to use. While normally processors that allow an instruction to specify multiple index registers add the contents together, IBM had a line of computers in which the contents were or'd together.|$|E

5000|$|The pound sign or hash symbol {{is often}} used in {{information}} technology to highlight a special meaning. (It {{should be noted that}} the words [...] "Pound Sign" [...] in the UK refer specifically to currency [...] "£"—extended ASCII character 156—and not weight.) In 1970 for example, the number sign was used to denote <b>immediate</b> <b>address</b> mode in the assembly language of the PDP-11 when placed next to a symbol or a number. In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie used # in the C programming language for special keywords that had to be processed first by the C preprocessor. In the 1986 SGML standard, ISO 8879:1986 (q.v.), # is a reserved name indicator (rni) which precedes keyword syntactic literals,--e.g., the primitive content token #PCDATA, used for parsed character data. In usage predating the current meaning of hashtag, the pound sign was called the [...] "hash symbol" [...] in some countries outside of North America so as to avoid confusion with the UK currency symbol.|$|E

25|$|Yet another impetus of both RISC {{and other}} designs came from {{practical}} measurements on real-world programs. Andrew Tanenbaum summed up many of these, demonstrating that processors often had oversized immediates. For instance, he showed that 98% {{of all the}} constants in a program would fit in 13 bits, yet many CPU designs dedicated 16 or 32 bits to store them. This suggests that, {{to reduce the number}} of memory accesses, a fixed length machine could store constants in unused bits of the instruction word itself, so that they would be immediately ready when the CPU needs them (much like <b>immediate</b> <b>addressing</b> in a conventional design). This required small opcodes in order to leave room for a reasonably sized constant in a 32-bit instruction word.|$|R

40|$|A {{reversal}} in {{the burden of}} proof in regards to sexual violence cases is an issue that has been discussed and debated both publically and politically. The focus of this paper involves a {{reversal in}} {{the burden of proof}} in regards to the mens rea element. A defendant in a sexual violence trial would be compelled to testify as to why they reasonably believed consent to have existed. The standard this element would need to be proved to would be on the balance of probabilities. In this paper I offer a critique of the current criminal justice process and outline how a partial reversal in the burden of proof could directly address the most pressing concerns for complainants of sexual violence. I argue that this proposal is certainly worth informed discussion and public debate. My overarching argument consists of the recognition that sexual violence is a prevalent and detrimental issue in New Zealand society and requires <b>immediate</b> <b>address.</b> It is therefore important that useful discussions such as the reversal of the burden of proof receive attention...|$|E
40|$|Background: Ladakh {{has less}} than optimal oral health care {{services}} and a poor transport and connectivity with {{other areas of the}} country during most part of the year. Therefore, <b>immediate</b> <b>address</b> to any dental pain is not possible. This study aims to determine the prevalence of dental pain among 12 - 15 -year-old schoolchildren of Leh, Ladakh after the commutation impairing time of the year. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in May 2014 to determine the prevalence and impact of dental pain among adolescents residing in Leh, Ladakh. A total of 264 students in the age group of 12 - 15 years participated in the study. The data were obtained using a pretested questionnaire that elicited information on past experience (6 months) of dental pain and the resultant impact on their daily lives. Statistical Analysis Used: Descriptive statistics was used for distribution of frequencies. Results: The response rate was 75. 7 %. Seventy-seven percent of the students reported dental pain in the past 6 months. About 89 % of the students reported, at least, one impact due to dental pain. Females reported more than their male counterpart. Difficulty in eating was found to be commonly reported impact followed by difficulty in sleeping. Conclusions: The prevalence of dental pain and its impact was found to be high. There is a need for a paradigm shift in focus of oral health services from urban areas to remote and rural areas. Knowledge about the magnitude of dental pain can be used to evaluate and plan preventive and curative services in remote and rural areas...|$|E

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effectiveness of}} mindfulness in helping after-degree nursing students manage stress. Two 4 -hour brief Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR-B) training sessions were delivered involving sitting meditation, yoga, and body scan. Participants used the techniques 30 minutes per day for four weeks. Qualitative, individual, semi-structured interviews were conducted after the 4 -week practice period. Most felt the intervention structure was effective for learning MBSR-B. The benefit of MBSR-B was stronger for some, likely related to individual learning styles, comfort with self-discovery and sharing. The group setting helped maintain focus and accountability, but could also inhibit sharing. All participants indicated mindfulness helped reduce their stress. Enhanced self-awareness resulted in early detection of stress, ability to change negative perception, development of self-compassion, acceptance of competence, <b>immediate</b> <b>addressing</b> of stress, and use of internal coping mechanisms. Findings indicate this type of stress management support may benefit after-degree nursing students, which may prove useful when developing nursing curriculums...|$|R
5000|$|The x86 {{architecture}} is a variable instruction length, primarily [...] "CISC" [...] design {{with emphasis on}} backward compatibility. The instruction set is not typical CISC, however, but basically an extended version of the simple eight-bit 8008 and 8080 architectures. Byte-addressing is enabled and words are stored in memory with little-endian byte order. Memory access to unaligned addresses is allowed for all valid word sizes. The largest native size for integer arithmetic and memory addresses (or offsets) is 16, 32 or 64 bits depending on architecture generation (newer processors include direct support for smaller integers as well). Multiple scalar values can be handled simultaneously via the SIMD unit present in later generations, as described below. <b>Immediate</b> <b>addressing</b> offsets and <b>immediate</b> data may be expressed as 8-bit quantities for the frequently occurring cases or contexts where a -128..127 range is enough. Typical instructions are therefore 2 or 3 bytes in length (although some are much longer, and some are single-byte).|$|R
