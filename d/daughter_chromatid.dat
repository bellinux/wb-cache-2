40|$|The caspase-related {{protease}} separase (EXTRA SPINDLE POLES, ESP) plays a {{major role}} in chromatid disjunction and cell expansion in Arabidopsis thaliana. Whether the expansion phenotypes are linked to defects in cell division in Arabidopsis ESP mutants remains elusive. Here we present the identification, cloning and characterization of the gymnosperm Norway spruce (Picea abies, Pa) ESP. We used the P. abies somatic embryo system and a combination of reverse genetics and microscopy to explore the roles of Pa ESP during embryogenesis. Pa ESP was expressed in the proliferating embryonal mass, while it was absent in the suspensor cells. Pa ESP associated with kinetochore microtubules in metaphase and then with anaphase spindle midzone. During cytokinesis, it localized on the phragmoplast microtubules and on the cell plate. Pa ESP deficiency perturbed anisotropic expansion and reduced mitotic divisions in cotyledonary embryos. Furthermore, whilst Pa ESP can rescue the chromatid nondisjunction phenotype of Arabidopsis ESP mutants, it cannot rescue anisotropic cell expansion. Our data demonstrate that the roles of ESP in <b>daughter</b> <b>chromatid</b> separation and cell expansion are conserved between gymnosperms and angiosperms. However, the mechanisms of ESP-mediated regulation of cell expansion seem to be lineage-specific...|$|E
5000|$|Anaphase (from the Greek ἀνά, [...] "up" [...] and φάσις, [...] "stage"), is {{the stage}} of mitosis after the {{metaphase}} when replicated chromosomes are split and the <b>daughter</b> <b>chromatids</b> are moved to opposite poles of the cell. Chromosomes also reach their overall maximum condensation in late anaphase, to help chromosome segregation and the re-formation of the nucleus.|$|R
50|$|Cytokinesis largely {{resembles the}} prokaryotic process of binary fission, {{but because of}} {{differences}} between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell structures and functions, the mechanisms differ. For instance a bacterial cell has only a single chromosome {{in the form of}} a closed loop, in contrast to the linear, usually multiple, chromosomes of eukaryotes; accordingly bacteria construct no mitotic spindle in cell division. Also, duplication of prokaryotic DNA takes place during the actual separation of chromosomes; in mitosis duplication takes place during the interphase before mitosis begins, though the <b>daughter</b> <b>chromatids</b> do not separate completely before the anaphase.|$|R
50|$|Flemming {{investigated}} {{the process of}} cell division {{and the distribution of}} chromosomes to the daughter nuclei, a process he called mitosis from the Greek word for thread. However, he did not see the splitting into identical halves, the <b>daughter</b> <b>chromatids.</b> He studied mitosis both in vivo and in stained preparations, using as the source of biological material the fins and gills of salamanders. These results were published first in 1878 and in 1882 in the seminal book Zellsubstanz, Kern und Zelltheilung (1882; Cell substance, nucleus and cell division). On the basis of his discoveries, Flemming surmised {{for the first time that}} all cell nuclei came from another predecessor nucleus (he coined the phrase omnis nucleus e nucleo, after Virchow's omnis cellula e cellula).|$|R
40|$|Centered in the Chinese hamster {{dihydrofolate reductase}} origin of {{replication}} is a prominent nuclear matrix attachment region (MAR). Indirect lines of evidence suggested that this MAR might be required for origin activation in early S phase. To test this possibility, we have deleted the MAR from a Chinese hamster ovary variant harboring a single copy of the dihydrofolate reductase locus. However, 2 D gel replicon mapping shows that removal of the MAR has no significant effect either on the frequency or timing of initiation in this locus. Rather, {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} studies on cells swollen under either neutral or alkaline conditions show that deletion of the MAR interferes with local separation of <b>daughter</b> <b>chromatids.</b> This surprising result provides direct genetic evidence that at least a subset of MARs performs an important biological function, possibly related to chromatid cohesion and separation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{biophotonics}} {{hypothesis is}} suggested {{for the scientific}} origin of the Turin Shroud. Presuming its historical authenticity the Shroud’s image may have arisen via the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. Two separate but synergistic biophotonic reactions involving ultraviolet (UV) radiation are considered to interact: (a) UV emission by Christ’s body and (b) UV absorption by the flax Shroud may explain the photo-negative image of the tortured and crucified Christ on the Shroud. A source of UV biophotons transmitted mainly from within the epidermis of Christ’s body struck the Shroud where melanin within its fibres created a colourization {{on the surface of}} the Shroud in the form of the photo-negative image of Christ’s wholebody. The dynamics of cell replication may be scientifically related to resurrection. UV photons emitted by chromosomes during the cell cycle evolve from a trickle into a cascade at metaphase as the chromosomes suddenly cleave into <b>daughter</b> <b>chromatids</b> followed by the dividing of the parent cells int...|$|R
40|$|For proper development, cells must retain {{patterns}} of gene expression and repression through cell division. Repression via methylation of histone H 3 on Lys 27 (H 3 K 27 me) by Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC 2) is conserved, but its transmission {{is not well}} understood. Our studies suggest that PRC 2 represses the X chromosomes in Caenorhabditis elegans germ cells, and this repression is transmitted to embryos by both sperm and oocytes. By generating embryos containing some chromosomes with and some without H 3 K 27 me, we show that, without PRC 2, H 3 K 27 me is transmitted to <b>daughter</b> <b>chromatids</b> through several rounds of cell division. In embryos with PRC 2, a mosaic H 3 K 27 me pattern persists through embryogenesis. These results demonstrate that H 3 K 27 me and PRC 2 each contribute to epigenetically transmitting the memory of repression across generations and during development...|$|R
40|$|Mitosis in {{free-living}} dinoflagellates {{is unusual}} in that the nuclear envelope remains intact {{but a number of}} cytoplasmic channels containing microtubules run completely through the nucleus (8, 9, 13). The chromosomes are known to be attached to the nuclear envelope (1, 8, 13) and during division this connection appears to {{take the form of a}} narrow stalk of chromosome material which fits into a depression in the nuclear membrane lining the channels. No centrioles or basal bodies have been observed adjacent to the dividing nuclei and until recently no connection had been seen between the microtubules and any other structure. It has been suggested that the microtubules merely provide a structural framework for mitosis and that the segregation of <b>daughter</b> <b>chromatids</b> might be brought about by movement of the nuclear envelope (8, 10, 12, 13). More recently it has also been suggested (6) that there are probably connections between the microtubules and the chromosomes, just as there are in most eucaryotic organisms and also in the parasitic dinoflagellate Oodinium (2) ...|$|R
40|$|AA 8 Chinese hamster ovary {{cells were}} treated with {{halogenated}} nucleosides analogues of thymidine, namely CldU, 5 -iodo- 2 ′-deoxyuridine (IdU), and 5 -bromo- 2 ′-deoxyuridine (BrdU), following different experimental protocols. The purpose was to see whether incorporation of exogenous pyrimidine analogues into DNA could interfere with normal chromosome segregation. The endpoint chosen was endoreduplication, that arises after aberrant mitosis when <b>daughter</b> <b>chromatids</b> segregation fails. Treatment {{with any of the}} halogenated nucleosides for two consecutive cell cycles resulted in endoreduplication, with a highest yield for CldU, intermediate for IdU, and lowest for BrdU. The frequency of endoreduplicated cells paralleled in all cases the level of analogue substitution into DNA. Our results seem to support that thymidine analogue substitution into DNA is responsible for the triggering of endoreduplication. Besides, the lack of any effect on endoreduplication when CldU was present for only one S-period strongly suggest that it is the nature of template, and not nascent DNA, that {{plays a major role in}} chromosome segregation. Taking into account that topoisomerase II cleaves DNA at preferred sequences within its recognition/binding sites, the likely involvement of the enzyme is discussed...|$|R
50|$|The first meiotic {{division}} effectively ends when the chromosomes {{arrive at the}} poles. Each daughter cell now has half the number of chromosomes but each chromosome consists {{of a pair of}} chromatids. The microtubules that make up the spindle network disappear, and a new nuclear membrane surrounds each haploid set. The chromosomes uncoil back into chromatin. Cytokinesis, the pinching of the cell membrane in animal cells or the formation of the cell wall in plant cells, occurs, completing the creation of two <b>daughter</b> cells. Sister <b>chromatids</b> remain attached during telophase I.|$|R
40|$|The {{final stage}} of cell {{division}} (mitosis), involves the compaction of the duplicated genome into chromatid pairs. Each pair is captured by microtubules emanating from opposite spindle poles, aligned at the metaphase plate, and then faithfully segregated to form two identical <b>daughter</b> cells. <b>Chromatids</b> that are not correctly attached to the spindle are detected by the constitutively active spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). Any stress that prevents correct bipolar spindle attachment, blocks the satisfaction of the SAC, and induces a prolonged mitotic arrest, providing the cell time to obtain attachment and complete segregation correctly. Unfortunately, during mitosis repairing damage is not generally possible due to the compaction of DNA into chromosomes, and subsequent suppression of gene transcription and translation. Therefore, {{in the presence of}} significant damage cell death is instigated to ensure that genomic stability is maintained. While most stresses lead to an arrest in mitosis, some promote premature mitotic exit, allowing cells to by-pass mitotic cell death. This mini-review will focus on the effects and outcomes that common stresses have on mitosis, and how this impacts on the efficacy of mitotic chemotherapies...|$|R
40|$|For {{the proper}} {{partition}} of chromosomes to <b>daughter</b> cells, sister <b>chromatids</b> {{must be held}} together before mi-totic chromosome segregation. This cohesion of sister chromatids is established during DNA replication depend-ent on the cohesin complex and is maintained until metaphase when sister kinetochores attach to micro-tubules (MTs) emanating from the opposite spindle poles (bipolar attachment) (Nasmyth et al. 2000). In animal mi-totic cells, however, most cohesin dissociates from the chromosome arms during prophase (called “prophase pathway”), in a manner dependent on the phosphorylation of cohesin by mitotic kinases such as Polo-like kinase (Losada et al. 2002; Hauf et al. 2005). However, cen-tromeric cohesin is retained until metaphase through the function of shugoshin (Sgo/MEI-S 332) (Lee et al. 2005...|$|R
40|$|Meiosis poses unique {{challenges}} to chromosome dynamics. Before entry into meiosis, each chromosome is duplicated and {{gives rise to}} two sister chromatids linked to each other by cohesion. Production of haploid gametes requires segregation of homologous chromosomes in the first meiotic division and of sister chromatids in the second. To ensure precise distribution of chromosomes to the <b>daughter</b> cells, sister <b>chromatid</b> cohesion (SCC) has to be dissolved in two steps. Maintenance and regu-lation of SCC is performed by the cohesin protein complex. This short review will primarily focus on the core cohesin proteins before venturing into adjacent territories {{with an emphasis on}} interacting proteins and complexes. It will also concentrate on mammalian meiosis and only occasionally discuss cohesion in other organisms. Reproduction (2005) 130 783 – 79...|$|R
40|$|To retain cell {{identity}} during development, cells must remember patterns of gene expression through cell division. The MES proteins in Caenorhabditis elegans are key regulators of gene {{expression in the}} germline and are necessary in parents for fertility in the next generation. MES- 2, MES- 3, and MES- 6 form the C. elegans Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC 2) and generate a repressive histone modification, methylation on Lysine 27 of Histone H 3 (H 3 K 27 me), on genes repressed in the germline. MES- 4 generates a different histone modification, H 3 K 36 me, on genes expressed in the germline. To further define the targets of MES protein regulation, determine if they work together to regulate gene expression, and investigate when they are important during germline development, I used genomics, genetics, and microscopy approaches. Transcript profiling of dissected mutant germlines revealed that MES- 2 / 3 / 6 and MES- 4 cooperate to promote expression of germline genes and repress somatic genes and genes on the X chromosome. Loss of MES- 4 from germline genes causes H 3 K 27 me 3 to spread to germline genes, resulting in reduced H 3 K 27 me 3 elsewhere on the autosomes and especially on the X. This finding supports the model that methylation of H 3 K 36 antagonizes methylation of H 3 K 27 on the same histone tails. My finding that loss of MES- 2, 3, or 6 results in expression from the X chromosomes and sterility, unless the X chromosome is repressed by other means, showed that the essential role of MES- 2 / 3 / 6 in worms is repression of the X chromosomes in germ cells. I determined that repressive H 3 K 27 me 3 is transmitted to embryos by both sperm and oocytes. By generating embryos containing some chromosomes with and some lacking H 3 K 27 me 3, I showed that in embryos lacking MES- 2 / 3 / 6 function, H 3 K 27 me 3 is transmitted to <b>daughter</b> <b>chromatids</b> through several rounds of cell division. In embryos with MES- 2 / 3 / 6 function, the mosaic pattern of H 3 K 27 me 3 is perpetuated through embryogenesis. Subsequently, during germline proliferation in larval stages, H 3 K 27 me 3 accumulates on all chromosomes. During germline proliferation in larvae is also when I found MES- 3 to be most important for germline development in the next generation. These latter two findings suggest that germline memory is reset during germline proliferation. Taken together, my findings support a "germline memory model" in which MES- 4 and H 3 K 36 me act as a memory of germline gene expression and help concentrate MES- 2 / 3 / 6 repression on the X chromosome. MES- 2 / 3 / 6 and H 3 K 27 me 3 act as a memory of germline gene repression, most importantly on the X chromosomes. The germline memory generated by the MES proteins is epigenetically transmitted across generations and is critical for the proper development of nascent germ cells...|$|R
40|$|Eukaryotic genomes are {{organized}} into chromosomes. In {{order to maintain}} genomic stability during cell proliferation, a series of elaborate processes is employed to ensure that chromosomes are duplicated and segregated equally into <b>daughter</b> cells. Sister <b>chromatid</b> cohesion, a tight association of duplicated sister chromatids, allows their attachment to the opposite centrosomes. Sister chromatid cohesion depends on the cohesin complex, a proteinaceous ring that entraps the chromatids together. At the metaphase-to-anaphase transition, a protease called separase is activated and completely dissolves the cohesion by cleaving SCC 1, a subunit of the cohesin complex. As {{one of the key}} executors of anaphase, separase is regulated temporally and spatially by often redundant mechanisms. A recent study revealed that chromosomal DNA is required as a cofactor for the cleavage of cohesin to occur. This DNA dependence is the underlying biochemical mechanism that allows separase to selectively cleave only the chromosome-associated cohesin. We propose that the chromosomal DNA dependent cohesin cleavage by separase is a component of a regulatory pathway that cells utilize to protect the bulk of cohesin. This intact cohesin becomes immediately available in G 1 to resume its other function—regulation of gene transcription by means of chromatin insulation...|$|R
