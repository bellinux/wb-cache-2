50|$|Robert Clark. Art {{critic for}} The Guardian. Mere Jelly catalogue. 2004.Paul Frank Lewthwaite makes sculptures {{that make a}} {{fragmented}} poetic rather than coherent practical sense. Timber boxes open to reveal spray-painted MDF flat packs {{for the construction of}} not domestic shelves or furniture but what the artist calls “motifs of fragmentation”. Ship for the Sinking is a steel kit for a sea-going suicide. A Place of Blindness is a steel model house spray painted black with plywood boarded-up windows. Three Diaries: Hopes, Dreams, Desires is a set of three steel diary-sized locked safes. The mystifying strength of Lewthwaite’s work lies in its half-resemblance to quite ordinary things. Often made from <b>DIY</b> <b>materials,</b> these constructions look like they should be of some use, yet like a DIY joke, their use escapes us. A recent series of even more mysterious plywood sculptures were based on a combination of drawings done at Madrid’s Museo Arqueologico Nacional and reproductions taken from The War Illustrated publications 1940-1946. These are plywood semi-abstracts but again take on the significance of skeletal relics or fossilised remains. Then again they could be bits of furniture gone weird, furnishings from a DIY nightmare. Lewthwaite’s mock-domestic sculptures bring home the fact that an artwork is an immaculately crafted object that is of absolutely no use to anyone other than being its own deeply suggestive self.|$|E
40|$|The DIY {{movement}} is expanding beyond {{products to the}} materials which embody products; namely, DIY-Materials. DIY-Materials are created through individual or collective self-production practices, often by techniques and processes of the designer’s invention. In this paper, we elaborate on the sources that {{can serve as a}} departure point for <b>DIY</b> <b>material</b> practices. Analyzing above 150 design cases, we introduce five main categories of DIY-Materials based on the material sources. Inspired by the biological classification of elements of earth, we name these categories as DIY-Materials Kingdoms. We present each kingdom with example cases supported by rich visuals to illustrate the process and the outcome of the DIY-Materials design effort...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of a}} {{research}} {{about the relationship between}} time and design through the topic of materials and processes, this paper presents experimentation on a novel material. New materials are emerging through a Do-It-Yourself approach encouraged by Open source behaviors and trans-disciplinary design. These materials become representative of new values, aesthetics and dynamics, which lead to an emotional bonding with the user and the designer. The need of applying a method suitable for the design of these materials is emerging. New tools for selecting, exploring and designing materials based on experience, senses and emotion are starting to be available and applied. Mycelium-based <b>DIY</b> <b>material</b> have a strong potential and might be a perfect candidate to experiment with an experience-based method, that is the Material Driven Design method. Through this method a material experience related to the passing of time and consistent with the material qualities and characteristics was developed. Combining a novel material with a novel method might lead to development both on the material and on the method itself...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new way}} of thinking about designing personalized artefacts for dyads (a group of two people) in long-distance relationships, whether they are family members, close friends or romantic couples. In this paper I am presenting the idea of a playful, yet useful tangible design for people who are often not able to see their loved ones in person. I strive to ideate a highly personalized and meaningful design through a Do It Yourself (DIY) activity for users, which will {{give them a chance to}} personalize the product according to their own needs. For this research, littleBits electronics have been used as a prototyping and <b>DIY</b> <b>material.</b> They allow you to create and connect two devices together and use them for different purposes. User testing with two close friends who live in different countries has been conducted. They received three different half-way done prototypes that they could choose from to build. The results showed that the idea of DIY artefact for presence in absence is worth researching, since the activity creates a meaningful shared experience which adds a bigger value to the device. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{democratization of}} {{personal}} fabrication technologies in {{parallel to the}} rising desire of individuals for personalizing their products offers great opportunities to experiment with advanced, distributed and shared production processes as well as design new materials. In this article, we introduce the notion of Do-It-Yourself (<b>DIY)</b> <b>Materials,</b> which are created through individual or collective self-production practices, often by techniques and processes of the designer's own invention. They can be totally new materials, modified, or further developed versions of existing materials. In order to provide an operational vocabulary to discuss <b>DIY</b> <b>materials,</b> we have collected 27 DIY material cases developed {{in the last five}} years. We group the collected cases under two main categories: (1) DIY new materials: which focus on creative material ingredients (e. g. a material made of dried, blended waste citrus peel combined with natural binders); and (2) DIY new identities for conventional materials: which focus on new production techniques, giving new expressions to existing materials (i. e. they do not necessarily contain new ingredients, such as 3 D printed metal). Grounded on the commonalities of collected cases, we discuss the design opportunities, including new aesthetic impressions offered through DIY material design practices. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E

40|$|Knowledge about {{materials}} {{is a fundamental}} element in product design education. It involves learning engineering concept about the technical properties and selection tools. More important, this concerns developing a sensitivity to the sensorial and experiential qualities of materials. We propose Material Tinkering as a practical and creative approach to develop this sensitivity through experiential learning. Integrated with envisioning and abstract conceptualization, it leads to richer and more complete projects. The paper uses a case study. This case is an experimental educational activity applying the tinkering approach to self-produced materials, i. e. <b>DIY</b> <b>materials.</b> This method fosters students’ creativity and educates them to understand, evaluate, and design the experiential, expressive, and sensorial characteristics of materials, i. e. the concept of Materials Experience, Tactual Experience, and the Expressive-sensorial dimension of materials. In conclusions, we suggest strategies to facilitate Material Tinkerin...|$|E

40|$|Where {{do we go}} from here?” One {{way that}} the Vassar College Library is {{answering}} this question is by making concerted efforts to promote unique or rarely held materials—that is, nurturing collections that will make us stand out from the crowd. With that goal in mind, the Vassar College Library has spent the past year working to create a collection of zines. This article will discuss the importance of social media in the acquisition of zines, using the Vassar College Library’s experience as an example. Zines are <b>DIY,</b> self‐published <b>materials</b> that are a vibrant and creative way to represent diverse points of view in your collection; however, with DIY publications come a host of new collection development and acquisition hurdles to consider. Since zines are produced outside of the purview of for‐profit publishers, librarians cannot rely on our comfortable and well‐established mechanisms to explore and acquire these materials. Using social media to inform collection development can be daunting, but if zines are a medium your library wants to pursue, doing a little bit of networking can go a long way. Readers will learn about the Vassar zine collection development plan, and different ways that we use social media (particularly Twitter) to fulfill our mission. Different online zine distributors (or distros) will also be discussed, as well as the wealth of materials to be found from individual zinesters via avenues typically not utilized by libraries, such as Etsy. The topic of ethical zine acquisitions will also be explored...|$|R
40|$|In the {{panorama}} of materials for design, a novel phenomenon is emerging. We already individuated it and called DIY-Materials. In {{the developed countries}} (mostly in Europe and North America), DIY-Materials are the response to an increasing standardized industrialization {{in the field of}} materials and technologies. Thanks to the democratization of technologies, today more people, designers included, have access to technology to create, edit, print, modify, share and act on anything, even on materials. The contemporary diffusion of making and the maker`s space phenomena also known as FabLabs are spreading a kind of low-tech approach conversely to the classic industrial one. The designers, as well as the people, demonstrate more often a will to return to do things by themselves; by touching the source of a form, feeling the emotion of a particular surface effect, or the surprise of an unexpected color, one can gain control of any single creation. The aim of the paper is to speak about DIY-Materials and define a new framework to explain their possible role as enabling agents of innovative social practices and future social businesses. We will present concepts like <b>DIY</b> practices, <b>Material</b> Activism, Creative Communities, Social Business and Social Innovation about materials. It is our assumption that the DIY-Materials can also arise from the creativity of a community in which the designer acts as a facilitator. The definition of DIY-Materials becomes richer as it includes the materials as ideas that simultaneously meet social needs and create new social relationships or collaborations. In other words, they are innovations that are both good for society and enhance society’s capacity to act and create social businesses...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} the implementation in shopping areas of two survey methods focused on energy efficiency. Based on {{the hypothesis that}} DIY centres’ customers plan to modify their houses, we assume that they constitute a relevant sample to approach the question of housing energy consumption. Because the costumers can be skilled or be looking for advice, we state that DIY centres are essential places for knowledge-sharing and capability-building on the stores’ products. Given that ethnographic surveys in shopping areas are commonly focused on either consumers’ behavior or internal store stakeholders’ practices, we propose two methods aiming to study the information flows on energy efficiency in these spaces. In particular, we {{pay special attention to}} how information is exchanged between salesmen (or advisers) and inhabitants as well as how it is understood and interpreted by both of them. These exchanges, moreover, are essential {{in the construction of the}} inhabitants’ expertise in house upgrading for energy efficiency. Firstly, we present a shorter research that studies how inhabitants interpret and understand technical representations of daylight and lighting analysis, which are used for the early design stages. To do so, we develop a campaign of customer surveys in a DIY centre. We ask the participants to discuss about several technical images resulting from a single house lighting simulation. As a result, they recalled their personal experience their house to explain the physical phenomena of light. Furthermore, the images strike up a conversation on the intimacy knowledge and sensory memories of light and home. We state that another method would not reveal the same results. In a second research, we conduct several surveys in <b>DIY</b> centres and <b>material</b> retailers’ departments that offer energy saving products for housing. Through a method of passive observation, our aim is to analyze the energy advice scenes to discern the exchange modalities between both inhabitant and salesman. We seek to understand the technical basis and the practical forms that lead the offer of advice and the support on energy efficiency for the inhabitants. As a result, we show that inhabitants deal with several criteria for their works. Energy efficiency seems to be only one of them, not being a current priority among the different choices to make. Moreover, they distrust in the salesmen’ knowledge and aims. Therefore, they have already taken a decision when they visit the store: the expertise in energy efficiency is already built and the inhabitants only want to compare their information. Despite of the physical constraints of the DIY centres environment for the survey, conducting interviews about housing inside them encourages inhabitants to describe their houses as accurately as possible proceeding from memory, both in technical and sensory aspects. Their stories are inevitably different when they are at home. Furthermore, during their discussion with the salesmen, the inhabitants unveil their point of views, their personal notion of comfort and their priority criteria about house’s energy efficiency. These surveys show that the energy efficiency of housing can only be discussed in connection with the emotional and cultural values intimately involved with the qualities which inhabitants project on their houses. Lastly, the method of “delocalized surveys” contribute to unveil the images of their housing that inhabitants have...|$|R
