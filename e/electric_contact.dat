25|$|In 1843 Wheatstone communicated an {{important}} {{paper to the}} Royal Society, entitled 'An Account of Several New Processes for Determining the Constants of a Voltaic Circuit.' It contained an exposition of the well known balance for measuring the electrical resistance of a conductor, which still {{goes by the name}} of Wheatstone's Bridge or balance, although it was first devised by Samuel Hunter Christie, of the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, who published it in the Philosophical Transactions for 1833. The method was neglected until Wheatstone brought it into notice. His paper abounds with simple and practical formulae for the calculation of currents and resistances by the law of Ohm. He introduced a unit of resistance, namely, a foot of copper wire weighing one hundred grains (6.5 g), and showed how it might be applied to measure the length of wire by its resistance. He was awarded a medal for his paper by the Society. The same year he invented an apparatus which enabled the reading of a thermometer or a barometer to be registered at a distance by means of an <b>electric</b> <b>contact</b> made by the mercury. A sound telegraph, in which the signals were given by the strokes of a bell, was also patented by Cooke and Wheatstone in May of that year.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{limitations}} of the classic commutator DC motor are due to the need for brushes to press against the commutator. This creates friction. Sparks are created by the brushes making and breaking circuits through the rotor coils as the brushes cross the insulating gaps between commutator sections. Depending on the commutator design, this may include the brushes shorting together adjacent sections – and hence coil ends – momentarily while crossing the gaps. Furthermore, the inductance of the rotor coils causes the voltage across each to rise when its circuit is opened, increasing the sparking of the brushes. This sparking limits the maximum speed of the machine, as too-rapid sparking will overheat, erode, or even melt the commutator. The current density per unit area of the brushes, in combination with their resistivity, limits the output of the motor. The making and breaking of <b>electric</b> <b>contact</b> also generates electrical noise; sparking generates RFI. Brushes eventually wear out and require replacement, and the commutator itself is subject to wear and maintenance (on larger motors) or replacement (on small motors). The commutator assembly on a large motor is a costly element, requiring precision assembly of many parts. On small motors, the commutator is usually permanently integrated into the rotor, so replacing it usually requires replacing the whole rotor.|$|E

Most firm catalogues and prospects offer information about the <b>electric</b> <b>contacts</b> in general. The paper solves some problems, concerning tribologic aspects regarding the functioning of sliding <b>electric</b> <b>contacts</b> by a set of experimental verifications. The analyse of the main factors which influence the behaviour of sliding <b>electric</b> <b>contacts</b> imposes proofing and testing programs with modification, control and measuring of some tribologic parameters, that intervene in the working process, for a better understanding and optimisation, regarding information and energy transfer. The used equipment consists of a proofing stand (for the study of the main process parameters). The novelty consists of a contact study on the couple sintered metal – graphite brushes with bronze rings. Despite the fact that the value of the volumic wear of the brush is situated under normal limits, by mentaining a constant velocity and by doubling the value of the contact pressure, the intensifying energy loss process leeds to a doubling wear of the averted layer...|$|R
