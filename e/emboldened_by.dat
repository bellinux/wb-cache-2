5|$|A second labor action {{took place}} in July 1935, as {{construction}} on the dam wound down. When a Six Companies manager altered working times to force workers to take lunch on their own time, workers responded with a strike. <b>Emboldened</b> <b>by</b> Crowe's reversal of the lunch decree, workers raised their demands to include a $1-per-day raise. The company agreed to ask the Federal government to supplement the pay, but no money was forthcoming from Washington. The strike ended.|$|E
5|$|Although {{no longer}} {{employed}} by the New Zealand Company, Heaphy, <b>emboldened</b> <b>by</b> {{the success of his}} report and the public reception to his paintings, sought further opportunities for similar work. From London, he wrote to the company secretary seeking support for exploration of the area inland of Nelson. The response was unenthusiastic, the company was concentrating on developing its settlements, rather than undertaking in further exploration of the country. Despite this, Heaphy returned to New Zealand and arrived in Nelson on 22 December 1842.|$|E
5|$|The Naked Brothers Band is a 2005 American children's film {{written and}} {{directed}} by Polly Draper, which stars her sons, Nat Wolff and Alex Wolff, who portray members of a fictional rock group. It tells of the boys' struggles with their fame and an internal dispute that causes the band to split before reuniting in the end. The musical comedy was <b>emboldened</b> <b>by</b> Nat's genuine band, The Silver Boulders, which he created in preschool with his friends who all portray themselves. The movie also includes the band's manager, Nat's faux female interest, the siblings' real life cousin as the group's babysitter, and the siblings' genuine father playing their inept accordion-playing dad.|$|E

To his relief, she tells Bertie she cannot marry him, as she has {{fallen in love with}} Gussie. Bertie relays the good news to Gussie, but even with this encouragement, Gussie remains too timid to propose, and Bertie decides to <b>embolden</b> him <b>by</b> lacing his orange juice with liquor.|$|R

Andy vehemently protests the breakup and says their {{relationship}} can work out if she just pretends to still love him. Erin walks outside to Pete, saying she could not do it. Pete tells her he is okay with this, since all he wants is for her to be happy. <b>Emboldened</b> <b>by</b> this, she gives him a kiss, runs back up to Andy's office, and breaks up with him. In her brief breakup speech she repeats her complaints about his three-month absence, not realizing that he is talking to David Wallace on speakerphone.|$|E
5|$|<b>Emboldened</b> <b>by</b> his success, Diệm {{began to}} plot Bảo Đại's downfall. He {{scheduled}} a referendum for 23 October 1955 and pushed Bảo Đại {{out of the}} political scene, hindering the former emperor's attempts to derail the poll. In the period {{leading up to the}} vote, campaigning for Bảo Đại was banned, while Diệm's election campaign focused on personal attacks against Bảo Đại. These included pornographic cartoons of the head of state and unverified rumours claiming he was illegitimate and linking him to various mistresses. The government-controlled media launched polemical attacks on Bảo Đại, and police went door-to-door, warning people of the consequences of failing to vote. After his brother Ngô Đình Nhu successfully rigged the poll, Diệm proclaimed himself president of the newly created Republic of Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|For a while, he was {{uncertain}} {{whether he would}} attend college, but ultimately he applied and was accepted to Hampden–Sydney College in Virginia, where a friend had also enrolled. Arriving in 1982, he continued to participate in plays while studying mainly philosophy. He found the curriculum rigorous, but was more focused {{than he had been}} in high school and was able to apply himself to his studies. Despite the lack of a significant theater community at Hampden–Sydney, Colbert's interest in acting escalated during this time. After two years, he transferred in 1984 to Northwestern University as a theater major to study performance, <b>emboldened</b> <b>by</b> the realization that he loved performing, even when no one was coming to shows. He graduated from Northwestern's School of Communication in 1986.|$|E

2500|$|A common claim {{among those}} arguing that President Obama {{was not born}} in Hawaii is that all doubt would be settled if Obama {{released}} his [...] "long form" [...] birth certificate. However, commentators noted that doing so would be disadvantageous to Obama. First, it would encourage speculation as to why {{it took so long}} to release the document. Second, caving in to his political adversaries' demands would <b>embolden</b> them <b>by</b> giving them a victory. Finally, it would open the door to demands for other personal records unrelated to his birth certificate. Despite these concerns, both Obama and his press secretary have responded to reporters' questions about the issue.|$|R
5|$|In September 1839, Juan Lavalle {{returned}} {{after ten years}} in exile. He allied with the governor of Corrientes, which revolted once again, and invaded Buenos Aires province {{at the head of}} Unitarian troops armed and supplied by the French. <b>Emboldened</b> <b>by</b> Lavalle's actions, the provinces of Tucumán, Salta, La Rioja, Catamarca and Jujuy formed the Coalition of the North and also rebelled against Buenos Aires. Great Britain intervened on behalf of Rosas, and France lifted the blockade on 29 October 1840. The struggle with his internal enemies was hard-fought. By December 1842, Lavalle had been killed and the rebellious provinces subdued, except for Corrientes, which was only defeated in 1847. Terrorism was also employed on the battlefield, as the Rosistas refused to take prisoners. The defeated men had their throats cut and their heads put on display.|$|E
5|$|Many of Wolff and Draper's show {{business}} friends {{appeared in the}} film. Wolff had been the music director for jazz singer Nancy Wilson and she introduced him to Arsenio Hall, who later chose Wolff as the bandleader of his talk show. Tony Shalhoub portrayed Phil in Draper's screenwriting debut The Tic Code, which was <b>emboldened</b> <b>by</b> Wolff's difficulties with Tourette syndrome {{as well as his}} exploits as a jazz pianist. Draper guest starred in the first season of Shalhoub's hit sitcom Monk. Other guest stars in the movie include Cyndi Lauper, David Thornton, Brent Popolizio, Cindy Blackman, and Ricki Lake. In addition, Draper had also made a cameo alongside her Thirtysomething co-stars Tim Busfield, Mel Harris, Peter Horton, Melanie Mayron, Ken Olin, and Patricia Wettig.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon's triumph at Marengo secured his {{political}} authority and boosted his popularity back home, {{but it did}} not lead to an immediate peace. Bonaparte's brother, Joseph, led the complex negotiations in Lunéville and reported that Austria, <b>emboldened</b> <b>by</b> British support, would not acknowledge the new territory that France had acquired. As negotiations became increasingly fractious, Bonaparte gave orders to his general Moreau to strike Austria once more. Moreau and the French swept through Bavaria and scored an overwhelming victory at Hohenlinden in December 1800. As a result, the Austrians capitulated and signed the Treaty of Lunéville in February 1801. The treaty reaffirmed and expanded earlier French gains at Campo Formio. Britain now remained the only nation that was still at war with France.|$|E

60|$|What was Bedloe's {{recognition}} of Prance worth? Manifestly nothing! He had probably seen Prance (not as a 'waiter') in the Queen's Chapel. Now he {{found him in}} custody. Cautious as regards Atkins, six weeks earlier, Bedloe was <b>emboldened</b> now <b>by</b> a train of successes. He had sworn away Coleman's life. His self- contradictions had been blindly swallowed. If Prance could prove an alibi, what was that to Bedloe? The light of the dark lantern had been very bad; the rogue, under that light, had worn a periwig, which 'doth disguise a man very much.' Bedloe could safely {{say that he had}} made an innocent error. Much worse blunders had not impaired his credit; later he made much worse blunders, undetected. He saw his chance and took it.|$|R
5|$|According to legend, in 832 A.D. Óengus II led {{an army of}} Picts and Scots {{into battle}} against the Angles, led by Æthelstan, near modern-day Athelstaneford, East Lothian. The legend states that whilst engaged in prayer {{on the eve of}} battle, Óengus vowed that if granted victory he would appoint Saint Andrew as the Patron Saint of Scotland; Andrew then {{appeared}} to Óengus that night in a dream and assured him of victory. On the morning of battle white clouds forming the shape of an X were said to have appeared in the sky. Óengus and his combined force, <b>emboldened</b> <b>by</b> this apparent divine intervention, took to the field and despite being inferior in terms of numbers were victorious. Having interpreted the cloud phenomenon as representing the crux decussata upon which Saint Andrew was crucified, Óengus honoured his pre-battle pledge and duly appointed Saint Andrew as the Patron Saint of Scotland. The white saltire set against a celestial blue background {{is said to have been}} adopted as the design of the flag of Scotland on the basis of this legend.|$|E
5|$|Pelotas was besieged and conquered by the Ragamuffins on 7 April 1836. Marques de Sousa {{was taken}} {{prisoner}} and removed to Porto Alegre, capital of Rio Grande do Sul, {{which had been}} under rebel control {{since the beginning of}} the conflict. He was held in a presiganga (prison ship). During his imprisonment, with the aid of the people of Porto Alegre, he managed to convince some of the rebel soldiers to switch sides, taking control of the entire town during the early hours of 15 June and arresting the remaining Ragamuffins. He repulsed rebel land and sea assaults against Porto Alegre on 18 June, 30 June, 15 July and 20 July; after that, the town remained in the hands of the legitimate government until the end of the conflict. The central government in Rio de Janeiro promoted Marques de Sousa to permanent major on 18 February 1837 in recognition of his vital role. The balance of power tipped against the Ragamuffins only a few months after the declaration of Rio Grande do Sul's independence on 11 September 1836. The Ragamuffins, although <b>emboldened</b> <b>by</b> their initial successes, never managed to gain control of the entire province.|$|E
5|$|<b>Emboldened</b> <b>by</b> {{the victory}} over Crassus, the Parthians {{attempted}} to capture Roman-held territories in Western Asia. Crown prince Pacorus I and his commander Osaces raided Syria {{as far as}} Antioch in 51 BC, but were repulsed by Gaius Cassius Longinus, who ambushed and killed Osaces. The Arsacids sided with Pompey in his civil war against Julius Caesar and even sent troops to support the anti-Caesarian forces at the Battle of Philippi in 42BC. Quintus Labienus, a general loyal to Cassius and Brutus, sided with Parthia against the Second Triumvirate in 40 BC; the following year he invaded Syria alongside Pacorus I. The triumvir Mark Antony was unable to lead the Roman defense against Parthia due to his departure to Italy, where he amassed his forces to confront his rival Octavian and eventually conducted negotiations with him at Brundisium. After Syria was occupied by Pacorus' army, Labienus split from the main Parthian force to invade Anatolia while Pacorus and his commander Barzapharnes invaded the Roman Levant. They subdued all settlements along the Mediterranean coast {{as far south as}} Ptolemais (modern Acre, Israel), with the lone exception of Tyre. In Judea, the pro-Roman Jewish forces of high priest Hyrcanus II, Phasael, and Herod were defeated by the Parthians and their Jewish ally Antigonus II Mattathias (r.40–37BC); the latter was made king of Judea while Herod fled to his fort at Masada.|$|E
2500|$|After Sun Ce {{was assassinated}} in 200 CE, Lady Wu (the mother of Sun Ce and Sun Quan) was worried that Sun Quan, who had succeeded his elder brother, would be too young to handle the {{precarious}} situation in Jiangdong. She consulted Dong Xi about her incertitude, and Dong <b>emboldened</b> her <b>by</b> saying, [...] "The lands in Jiangdong enjoy natural barriers from mountains and rivers, while the good government and virtue of Sun Ce have already won {{the hearts of the}} people. The young lord can build on these foundations so that everyone can follow his commands. Zhang Zhao can take charge of internal affairs, while others like me can serve as 'claws and teeth' (a euphemism for military servicemen). With both geographical advantage and popular support, there is certainly nothing to worry about." [...] His sanguine speech was applauded by many.|$|R

A pretty sight would it have been for young Perkins to see strangers so unceremoniously devouring his feast. She drank--Mr. Scully drank--and so <b>emboldened</b> was he <b>by</b> the draught that he actually seated himself by the side of Lady Gorgon, on John Perkins's new sofa.|$|R
5|$|Seward was an expansionist, {{and sought}} {{opportunities}} to gain territory for the United States. By 1867, the Russian government saw its North American colony (today Alaska) {{as a financial}} liability, and feared losing control as American settlement reached there. It instructed its minister in Washington, Baron Eduard de Stoeckl, to negotiate a sale. De Stoeckl did so deftly, getting Seward to raise his offer from $5 million (coincidentally, the minimum that Russia had instructed de Stoeckl to accept) to $7 million, and then getting $200,000 added by raising various objections. This sum of $7.2 million is equivalent to $ in present-day terms. On March 30, 1867, de Stoeckl and Seward signed the treaty, working quickly as the Senate was about to adjourn. Johnson and Seward took the signed document to the President's Room in the Capitol, {{only to be told}} {{there was no time to}} deal with the matter before adjournment. The President summoned the Senate into session to meet on April 1; that body approved the treaty, 37–2. <b>Emboldened</b> <b>by</b> his success in Alaska, Seward sought acquisitions elsewhere. His only success was staking an American claim to uninhabited Wake Island in the Pacific, which would be officially claimed by the U.S. in 1898. He came close with the Danish West Indies as Denmark agreed to sell and the local population approved the transfer in a plebiscite, but the Senate never voted on the treaty and it expired.|$|E
5|$|The new Ottoman army {{arrived on}} the island {{during the winter of}} 1666/1667, and in May, the final phase of the siege, overseen by the Grand Vizier himself, began. It would last for 28 months and cost the lives of 70,000 Ottoman soldiers, 38,000 conscripted Cretans and slaves who labored in the Ottoman siege works and 29,088 of the city's Christian defenders. Faced with the renewed Ottoman assault and a {{struggling}} economy, despite the prospect of considerable reinforcements from Western Europe, in 1668 the Signoria hoped to end the war by striking a peace settlement with the Ottomans. Indeed, the Venetians hoped to use the imminent arrival of reinforcements to secure concessions from the Ottomans. Admiral Andrea Valier was at first appointed as envoy, but fell ill and was quickly replaced by the elderly nobleman Alvise da Molin. Molin and his embassy traveled to Larissa, where the Ottoman court resided during one of the Sultan's hunting expeditions. The Ottomans proposed that Venice keep one half of Crete, but the Signoria, <b>emboldened</b> <b>by</b> further pledges of reinforcements, especially from France, and renewed turmoil at the Ottoman court and within the Empire, refused the offer. Molin, in the meantime transported by the Ottomans to Canea in Crete, was ordered to continue negotiations and to continue observing the Ottomans' strength and intentions, but not commit himself or the Republic.|$|E

5000|$|In Spring 1540, the Caxcanes {{and their}} allies struck back, <b>emboldened</b> perhaps <b>by</b> the fact that Governor Francisco Vásquez de Coronado had taken more than 1,600 Spaniards and Amerindian allies from the region northward with him on his {{expedition}} to {{what would become the}} United States’ Southwest. [...] The province was thus bereft of many of its most competent soldiers. The spark that set off the war was apparently the arrest of 18 rebellious Indian leaders and the hanging of nine of them in mid 1540. Later in the same year the Indians rose up to kill, roast, and eat the encomendero Juan de Arze. [...] Spanish authorities also became aware that the Indians were participating in “devilish” dances. After killing two Catholic priests, many Indians fled the encomiendas and took refuge in the mountains, especially on the hill fortress of Mixtón. Acting Governor Cristobal de Oñate led a Spanish and Indian force to quell the rebellion. The Caxcanes killed a delegation of one priest and ten Spanish soldiers. Oñate attempted to storm Mixtón, but the Indians on the summit repelled his attack. [...] Oñate then requested reinforcements from the capital, Mexico City.|$|R

France promised to pay Sweden desperately needed war subsidies only on the condition that it moved in force on Brandenburg. A Swedish army of around 22,000 men under Carl Gustaf Wrangel advanced into Brandenburg in December 1674 and suffered a minor tactical defeat at the Battle of Fehrbellin in June 1675.
