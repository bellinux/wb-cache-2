5|$|Silent Alarm was shortlisted for the 2005 Mercury Music Prize, but {{was beaten}} by Antony and the Johnsons' second album I Am a Bird Now. It was also {{nominated}} for the 2005 Shortlist Music Prize, but lost to Sufjan Stevens' fifth album Illinois. The record was named Album of the Year for 2005 by NME ahead of Arcade Fire's debut album Funeral, by Intro in Germany, and by Rumore in Italy. URB included Silent Alarm in its unnumbered shortlist of the best records of 2005. It figured highly in other end-of-year best album lists: at number two by <b>Hot</b> <b>Press</b> and by Stylus, at number four by Drowned in Sound, at number six by Spin, at number seven by Metacritic's chief editor, and at number nine by The Denver Post. Silent Alarm earned Bloc Party several nominations, including Best Alternative Act at the 2005 MTV Europe Music Awards, Best British Band at the 2006 NME Awards, and Artist of the Year at the 2006 PLUG Awards. The record itself won Indie Rock Album of the Year at the 2006 PLUG Awards. It was also nominated as Best Album at the 2006 NME Awards, and as Album of the Year at the 2006 PLUG Awards.|$|E

25|$|Prior to {{the launch}} of the Prevé and Suprima S, Proton cars {{suffered}} from a poor safety reputation. The Proton Jumbuck infamously scored one star out of a potential five in its ANCAP test in 2009. Proton responded by raising safety standards significantly during the development of the Prevé. The Reinforced Safety Structure (RESS) frame was developed specifically for the new car. Proton employs the use of <b>Hot</b> <b>Press</b> Forming (HPF), a process which was pioneered in Germany, during the frame's manufacturing process. Twelve incorporated HPF components help in the reinforcement of the passenger compartment for improved occupant safety. The end result is an increased tensile strength and torsional body rigidity of 19,000 Nm/degree. The usage of HPF in the Prevé's manufacturing process also helps in weight-saving, which translates into improved fuel efficiency, handling and performance. Proton is the only Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) in South East Asia to use <b>Hot</b> <b>Press</b> Forming in their manufacturing processes.|$|E
25|$|Linehan and Mathews {{first met}} {{while working at}} <b>Hot</b> <b>Press.</b> In the late 1980s, Mathews, Paul Woodfull and Kieran Woodfull formed The Joshua Trio, a U2 tribute band. The trio began writing comedy {{sketches}} to accompany their act. Mathews created the Father Ted character for his short-lived stand-up routine. Before The Joshua Trio played at gigs, Mathews would occasionally come on-stage as Father Ted and tell jokes involving his great friend, Father Dougal McGuire.|$|E
25|$|Through an ad {{she placed}} in <b>Hot</b> <b>Press</b> in mid-1984, she met Colm Farrelly. Together they {{recruited}} {{a few other}} members and formed a band called Ton Ton Macoute. The band moved to Waterford briefly while O'Connor attended Newtown, but she soon {{dropped out of school}} and followed them to Dublin, where their performances received positive reviews. Their sound was inspired by Farrelly's interest in world music, though most observers thought O'Connor's singing and stage presence were the band's strongest features.|$|E
50|$|ZrB2 {{parts are}} usually <b>hot</b> <b>pressed</b> (pressure {{applied to the}} heated powder) and then {{machined}} to shape. Sintering of ZrB2 is hindered by the material's covalent nature and presence of surface oxides which increase grain coarsening before densification during sintering. Pressureless sintering of ZrB2 is possible with sintering additives such as boron carbide and carbon which react with the surface oxides to increase the driving force for sintering but mechanical properties are degraded compared to <b>hot</b> <b>pressed</b> ZrB2.|$|R
40|$|As an {{alternative}} to mechanical alloying, high temperature synthesis (HTS) of ultra-hard, super-abrasive AlMgB 14 was performed under normal pressure. The reaction mixture consisted of elemental Al and B, whereas Mg was added {{in the form of}} a Mgprecursor which liberates elemental magnesium approximately 400 ºC above the melting point of Mg, in this way reducing its evaporation during heating-up. 95 wt % conversion to AlMgB 14 and 5 wt % to MgAl 2 O 4 was achieved. The synthesized AlMgB 14 baseline powder, as well as mixtures of AlMgB 14 consisting of 30, 50 and 70 wt% of TiB 2, were <b>hot</b> <b>pressed</b> to near theoretical density. The various samples produced were characterized for microstructure and hardness. A microhardness of 29. 4 GPa in <b>hot</b> <b>pressed</b> AlMgB 14 and a maximum Vickers hardness of 30. 2 GPa in <b>hot</b> <b>pressed</b> samples of AlMgB 14 reinforced with 70 wt% of TiB 2 particles (d 50 = 4, 1 µm) was achieved. Future project milestones necessary for achieving a higher AlMgB 14 reaction yield, reducing the MgAl 2 O 4 content and producing sinter-active AlMgB 14 powder, as well as <b>hot</b> <b>pressed</b> composites processing improvement for gaining maximum hardness are also presented...|$|R

25|$|Structural aircraft-grade plywood is most {{commonly}} manufactured from African mahogany, spruce or birch veneers that are bonded {{together in a}} <b>hot</b> <b>press</b> over hardwood cores of basswood or poplar or from European Birch veneers throughout. Basswood is another type of aviation-grade plywood that is lighter and more flexible than mahogany and birch plywood but has slightly less structural strength. Aviation-grade plywood is manufactured {{to a number of}} specifications including those outlined since 1931 in the Germanischer Lloyd Rules for Surveying and Testing of Plywood for Aircraft and MIL-P-607, the latter of which calls for shear testing after immersion in boiling water for three hours to verify the adhesive qualities between the plies and meets specifications.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, Mathews {{left his}} job at <b>Hot</b> <b>Press</b> and moved into Linehan's London home. Over {{the next three to}} four years, they worked on rough ideas for shows {{while at the same time}} writing for sketch shows such as The All New Alexei Sayle Show and The Fast Show. One of these ideas was for a comedy mockumentary series called Irish Lives, with six episodes, each {{focusing}} on a different character living somewhere in Ireland. They scripted an episode centring on a priest named Father Ted Crilly, who visits his friends in the seminary in Maynooth College. Producer Geoffrey Perkins suggested that the episode's concept be dramatised and rewritten as a sitcom.|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{work was}} {{continued}} {{on the development}} and characterization of bulk and <b>hot</b> <b>pressed</b> powders and tapecast materials in the Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O and Tl-Ba-Ca-Cu-O systems. A process for producing warp-free, sintered, superconducting tapes of Bi composition Bi 1 Sr 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 O(x) was established. The procedure requires a triple calcination at 830 C for 24 hours and sintering at 845 C from 20 to 200 hours. Hot pressing the triple calcined powder at 845 C for 6 hours at 5000 psi yielded a dense material, which on further heat treatment at 845 C for 24 hours, exhibited a Tc of 108. 2 K. The Bi compositions {{were found to be}} much less oxygen sensitive than the Y compositions. This was especially noted {{in the case of the}} <b>hot</b> <b>pressed</b> materials which were superconducting as <b>hot</b> <b>pressed,</b> a condition that could not be achieved in the Y compositions.

40|$|To assure {{reliable}} {{performance of}} ceramic materials in gas turbine engines, where performance at 1400 °C for up to 10, 000 hours is required, {{it is necessary to}} screen out material with defects in the size range 10 to 100 μm (0. 0004 to 0. 004 inches). Investigation of high frequency ultrasonic techniques has led to development of longitudinal and shear wave methods capable of detecting defects at least down to 25 μm In size. The approach is to use a high frequency (45 MHz) ultrasonic pulse-echo Immersion mode technique, making C-scan recordings of the results. Inspections have been performed on <b>hot</b> <b>pressed</b> and reaction bonded silicon nitride and <b>hot</b> <b>pressed</b> and sintered silicon carbide.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of hot pressing on the shear bond strength of a CoCrMoSi alloy to a low-fusing feldspathic porcelain, for two types of surface treatments: polished and grit-blasted. Moreover, the shear strength of <b>hot</b> <b>pressed</b> porcelain was also compared with that of conventional vacuum sintered porcelain. Bond strength of metal–porcelain composites were assessed by the means of a shear test performed in a universal test machine until fracture. Fracture surfaces and interfaces were investigated by optical microscope, stereomicroscope and SEM/EDS. Data was analyzed with Shapiro–Wilk test to test the assumption of normality. The 2 -way ANOVA followed by Tukey HSD multiple comparison test was used to compare shear bond strength results and the t-test was used to compare the porcelain shear strength (pb 0. 05). <b>Hot</b> <b>pressed</b> specimens exhibited significantly (pb 0. 001) higher bond strength values than those obtained by conventional PFM technique. Significant differences (pb 0. 001) were found in the shear bond strength between grit-blasted and polished specimens. Significant differences (pb 0. 05) were also found between the shear strength of vacuum sintered and <b>hot</b> <b>pressed</b> porcelain. This study revealed that metal–ceramic bond strength is maximized for <b>hot</b> <b>pressed</b> porcelain onto rough metal substrates, with lower variability in results.
