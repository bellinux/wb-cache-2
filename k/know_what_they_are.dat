5|$|Bart and Lisa {{begin to}} hear strange noises {{coming from the}} attic. Homer claims not to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> talking about, {{even though he is}} seen heading into the attic with a bucket of fish heads. Bart and Lisa investigate, and {{discover}} there really is a monster. Homer and Marge go into the attic, and discover that the creature has escaped, prompting Marge to call Dr. Hibbert. He explains that Bart has a twin brother named Hugo. The two were separated at birth, but it was discovered that Hugo was too evil to live in society, so the Simpsons kept him chained in the attic, where Homer fed him a bucket of fish heads once a week. The rest of the family leaves to find Hugo, leaving Bart behind, but he discovers that Hugo never left the house. Hugo takes Bart to the attic and ties him up, so that he can reattach himself, but Dr. Hibbert bursts in and knocks out Hugo. He then realizes that Hugo's scar is on the wrong side, and Bart is the evil twin. In an attempt to correct their wrong, Dr. Hibbert and the Simpson family sit down to a turkey dinner with Hugo, leaving Bart locked in the attic.|$|E

He believes that the concealed carrying of weapons should be allowed. He has said that whenever he hears people start talking about hunting when referring to the Second Amendment, he realizes they do not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> talking about, because the Second Amendment was to allow an armed citizenry the opportunity to protect themselves in case a tyrannical government ever came into power.|$|E

'It will serve as a challenge for me, they do not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> saying, before I have also experienced this before I started boxing, but I proved them wrong.', Pacquiao said.|$|E
25|$|The concept {{goes back}} {{at least as far}} as Aristotle who, in Poetics, {{referred}} to narration and action as different modes or manner of representing something. For many years, fiction writing was described has having two types: narration and dialogue. Evan Marshall, in The Marshall Plan for Novel Writing (1998) noted that writers should <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> doing at all times. He described what he called fiction-writing modes—the types of writing of which all fiction is made. He listed five modes: action, summary, dialogue, feelings/thoughts, and background, each with its own set of conventions regarding how, when, and where it should be used.|$|E

500|$|Conservapedia {{hosts the}} [...] "Conservative Bible Project", a project aiming {{to rewrite the}} English {{translation}} of the Bible in order to remove terms described as [...] "liberal bias". The project intends to remove sections of the Bible which are judged by Conservapedia's founder to be later liberal additions. These include {{the story of the}} adulteress in the Gospel of John in which Jesus declares [...] "Let him who is without sin cast the first stone". The project also intends to remove Jesus's prayer on the cross, [...] "Father, forgive them, for they do not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> doing", since it appears only in the Gospel of Luke and since, according to Schlafly, [...] "the simple fact {{is that some of the}} persecutors of Jesus did know what they were doing. This quotation is a favorite of liberals but should not appear in a conservative Bible".|$|E
500|$|Hand's {{democratic}} {{respect for}} legislation {{meant that he}} hardly ever struck down a law. Whenever his decisions went against the government, he based them only on the boundaries of law in particular cases. He adhered to the doctrine of presumptive validity, which assumes that legislators <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> doing when they pass a law. Even when a law was uncongenial to him, or when it seemed contradictory, Hand set himself to interpret the legislative intent. Sometimes, however, he was obliged {{to draw the line}} between federal and state laws, as in United States v. Schechter Poultry. In this important case, he ruled that a New Deal law on working conditions did not apply to a New York poultry firm that conducted its business only within the state. Hand wrote in his opinion: [...] "It is always a serious thing to declare any act of Congress unconstitutional, and especially in a case where {{it is part of a}} comprehensive plan for the rehabilitation of the nation as a whole. With the wisdom of that plan we have nothing whatever to do..." ...|$|E

2500|$|There {{is always}} {{disagreement}} between fishermen and government scientists... Imagine an overfished {{area of the}} sea {{in the shape of}} a hockey field with nets at either end. The few fish left therein would gather around the goals because fish like structured habitats.

The fishermen would make a beeline to the goals, catch the fish around them, and say the scientists do not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> talking about. The subjective impression the fishermen get is always that there's lots of fish - because they only go to places that still have them... fisheries scientists survey and compare entire areas, not only the productive fishing spots. – Fisheries scientist Daniel Pauly ...|$|E
2500|$|Moore was {{the subject}} of a {{transfer}} offer from Brackley Town at the end of the 2009–10 season, with the club offering him a reported £1,000 per week to join them. After a season finishing just outside the play-off positions despite facing a 10-point deduction for going into administration, Moore criticised the owners of the club in local newspaper Halesowen News. He claimed that the owners [...] "do not really <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> doing" [...] and commented on their [...] "lack of ambition". Halesowen responded with an official club statement via their official website, stating that they had fined Moore one month's wages for his actions.

2500|$|A seventeen-year-old Prague art {{student named}} Karou leads an {{interesting}} life: she has blue hair that grows from her head, speaks {{a variety of}} languages, has three bullets in her stomach, and has been raised by creatures with human and animal features called chimaera. These are Brimstone, with lion legs and ram horns; Issa, with a snake's lower body, hood, and fangs; Twiga, with a giraffe neck; and Yasri, with a parrot beak. Kishmish, a crow with bat wings, acts as a messenger from Brimstone to Karou. Karou is often sent on missions to gather teeth for Brimstone, although she does not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> used for and why there are certain rules such as [...] "no baby teeth" [...] and [...] "no rotting". In return she gets wishes; the higher the price, the greater the wish.|$|E
2500|$|Relatively {{early in}} his career, the {{literary}} scholar [...] observed the specific form of critique within Leitner's verse: [...] "By way of his language, Leitner creates the resistance that reality is {{no longer able to}} offer him." [...] In his review entitled [...] "Love and social critique," [...] has verified that observation while exploring Leitner's collection of poems [...] "Schreite fort, Schritt." [...] Leitner, says Lutz Rathenow in an analysis of the poem Angel in Die Welt, often varies the motif of uncertainty: [...] "Anton G. Leitner goes beyond that: and what is there to do, when angels no longer <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> and what their mission is? In this slender poem of no more than 27 words, angels are, above all, exhausted. The author is able to place each word with such ambiguity that the poem raises more questions than answers." ...|$|E

The event was being broadcast live on Fox Sports Net (FSN), which has a policy against advertising [...]com websites, and Ulliott was banned from appearing in any forthcoming FSN productions. Ulliott later responded that he only paid the entry money so he could advertise his site; it was originally agreed that {{he would be able to}} promote the site, so he decided to advertise his site through the publicity stunt regardless. Despite supporting online poker sites, Ulliott indicated that many online players do not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> doing when playing, which makes them harder to play against.|$|E
