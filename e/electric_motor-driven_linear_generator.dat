40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} {{the feasibility of}} confocal profiling in measuring surface roughness and obtaining 3 -dimensional reconstructions of mechanically dissected and femtosecond (fs) -laser photodisrupted endothelial lamellae. To {{determine the}} predictability of single-pass dissection of ultrathin endothelial lamellae using a novel <b>motor-driven</b> <b>linear</b> microkeratome. METHODS: Thirty (n = 30) human corneas were harvested using a <b>motor-driven</b> <b>linear</b> microkeratome (n = 20); a hand-driven rotatory microkeratome (n = 6); and a 60 -kHz fs laser (n = 4). Surface roughness was measured using an optical profiler operated in confocal microscopy mode followed by environmental scanning-electron-microscopy. RESULTS: Mean surface roughness for the fs laser, <b>motor-driven</b> <b>linear</b> microkeratome, and hand-driven rotatory microkeratome measured 1. 90 ± 0. 48 µm, 1. 06 ± 0. 42 µm, and 0. 93 ± 0. 25 µm, respectively. Femtosecond photodisrupted lamellae were significantly rougher than mechanically dissected lamellae (P 2 ̆ 6 lt; 0. 001). Mean (±SD) cutting depth with the <b>motor-driven</b> <b>linear</b> microkeratome measured: 552 ± 11 µm (550 -µm head); 505 ± 19 µm (550 -µm head); 459 ± 19 µm (450 -µm head); and 392 ± 20 µm (400 -µm head). CONCLUSIONS: Confocal microscopy allows quantitative surface roughness analysis and 3 -dimensional reconstruction of human corneal lamellae. Femtosecond-laser photodisruption at 60 kHz results in rougher surfaces compared with mechanical dissection. The <b>motor-driven</b> <b>linear</b> microkeratome allows single-pass dissection of ultrathin endothelial lamellae {{with a standard deviation}} = 20 µm...|$|R
