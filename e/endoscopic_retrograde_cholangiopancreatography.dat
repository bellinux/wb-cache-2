5|$|While {{abdominal}} imaging can {{be useful}} in the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma, direct imaging of the bile ducts is often necessary. <b>Endoscopic</b> <b>retrograde</b> <b>cholangiopancreatography</b> (ERCP), an endoscopic procedure performed by a gastroenterologist or specially trained surgeon, has been widely used for this purpose. Although ERCP is an invasive procedure with attendant risks, its advantages include the ability to obtain biopsies and to place stents or perform other interventions to relieve biliary obstruction. Endoscopic ultrasound can also be performed at the time of ERCP and may increase the accuracy of the biopsy and yield information on lymph node invasion and operability. As an alternative to ERCP, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) may be utilized. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a non-invasive alternative to ERCP. Some authors have suggested that MRCP should supplant ERCP in the diagnosis of biliary cancers, as it may more accurately define the tumor and avoids the risks of ERCP.|$|E
5|$|The gold {{standard}} test for biliary obstruction is still <b>endoscopic</b> <b>retrograde</b> <b>cholangiopancreatography</b> (ERCP). This {{involves the use}} of endoscopy (passing a tube through the mouth into the esophagus, stomach and thence to the duodenum) to pass a small cannula into the bile duct. At that point, radiocontrast is injected to opacify the duct, and X-rays are taken to get a visual impression of the biliary system. On the endoscopic image of the ampulla, one can sometimes see a protuberant ampulla from an impacted gallstone in the common bile duct or the frank extrusion of pus from the common bile duct orifice. On the X-ray images (known as cholangiograms), gallstones are visible as non-opacified areas in the contour of the duct. For diagnostic purposes, ERCP has now generally been replaced by MRCP. ERCP is only used first-line in critically ill patients in whom delay for diagnostic tests is not acceptable; however, if the index of suspicion for cholangitis is high, an ERCP is typically done to achieve drainage of the obstructed common bile duct.|$|E

An 84 -year-old man underwent ERCP because of recur-rent cholangitis with intrahepatic bile duct dilatation, as seen on MRCP.

40|$|This {{international}} survey {{analyzes the}} long-term follow-up of 31, 212 <b>endoscopic</b> <b>retrograde</b> <b>cholangiopancreatographies.</b> No late complication is described for the diagnostic exams. Among the 1888 sphincterotomized patients followed during more than 3 months, 1738 are symptomatically healed. Seventy-one relapsing {{stones of the}} common bile duct are described. Among these, the remaining gallbladder {{does not seem to}} be a risk factor. The majority have been treated by a simple endoscopic manoeuvre. Twenty-four angiocholites should be related to the sphincterotomy, if the emptiness of the common bile duct is certain. The other observations are 15 stenoses of the common bile duct, preexisting or not, 7 acute pancreatites, 2 persisting cholestases without jaundice, and 1 hepatic abscess. Eighty-one patients have been later cholecystectomized, 30 for acute cholecystitis. The long-term morbidity of biliary and pancreatic endoscopy, especially the operative one, is low and always light. It is often due to a wrong initial diagnosis. SCOPUS: NotDefined. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
25|$|Another {{advantage}} of MRI is its utilization of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) sequences. MRCP provides useful {{information regarding the}} etiology of acute pancreatitis, i.e., the presence of tiny biliary stones (choledocholithiasis or cholelithiasis) and duct anomalies. Clinical trials indicate that MRCP can be as effective a diagnostic tool for acute pancreatitis with biliary etiology as <b>endoscopic</b> <b>retrograde</b> <b>cholangiopancreatography,</b> but with the benefits of being less invasive and causing fewer complications.|$|E
25|$|Acute {{pancreatitis}} {{is usually}} treated with intravenous fluids, pain medication, and sometimes antibiotics. Typically no eating or drinking is allowed and a tube may be placed into the stomach. A procedure {{known as an}} <b>endoscopic</b> <b>retrograde</b> <b>cholangiopancreatography</b> (ERCP) may be done to open the pancreatic duct if blocked. In those with gallstones the gallbladder is often also removed. In chronic pancreatitis, {{in addition to the}} above, temporary feeding through a nasogastric tube may be used to provide adequate nutrition. Long-term dietary changes and pancreatic enzyme replacement may be required. And occasionally surgery is done to remove parts of the pancreas.|$|E
500|$|<b>Endoscopic</b> <b>retrograde</b> <b>cholangiopancreatography</b> (ERCP) is {{the most}} common {{approach}} in unblocking the bile duct. This involves endoscopy (passing a fiberoptic tube through the stomach into the duodenum), identification of the ampulla of Vater and insertion of a small tube into the bile duct. A sphincterotomy (making a cut in the sphincter of Oddi) is typically done to ease the flow of bile from the duct and to allow insertion of instruments to extract gallstones that are obstructing the common bile duct; alternatively or additionally, the common bile duct orifice can be dilated with a balloon. Stones may be removed either by direct suction or by using various instruments, including balloons and baskets to trawl the bile duct in order to pull stones into the duodenum. Obstructions that are caused by larger stones may require the use of an instrument known as a mechanical lithotriptor in order to crush the stone prior to removal. Obstructing stones that are too large to be removed or broken mechanically by ERCP may be managed by extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. This technique uses acoustic shock waves administered outside the body to break down the stones. [...] An alternative technique to remove very large obstructing stones is electrohydraulic lithotripsy, where a small endoscope known as a cholangioscope is inserted by ERCP to directly visualize the stone. A probe uses electricity to generate shock waves that break down the obstructing stone. [...] Rarely, surgical exploration of the common bile duct (termed choledochotomy), which can be performed with laparoscopy, is required to remove the stone.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction Bile duct {{injury is}} a severe and {{potentially}} life-threatening complication of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Several series have described a 0. 5 % to 0. 6 % incidence of bile duct injury during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The {{aim of this}} study was to analyze the presentation, characteristics, related investigation, and treatment results of major bile duct injuries after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Case presentation A rare case of a 48 -year-old Greek woman with a triple bile duct injury (right and left hepatic duct ligation and common bile duct cross-section) is presented. A Roux en Y hepaticojejunostomy was performed after repeated <b>endoscopic</b> <b>retrograde</b> <b>cholangiopancreatographies,</b> percutaneous transhepatic catheterization of the ducts and magnetic resonance cholangiographies to delineate the biliary anatomy and assess the level of injury. Conclusion Early recognition and an adequate multidisciplinary approach are the cornerstones for the optimal final outcome. Suboptimal management of injuries often leads to more extensive damage to the biliary tree and its vasculature. Early referral to a tertiary care center with experienced hepatobiliary surgeons and skilled interventional radiologists would appear to be necessary to assure optimal results. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background:Current methods {{available}} {{for assessing the}} learning curve, such as a predefined number of procedures or direct observation by a tutor, are unsatisfactory. A new tool, the cumulative summation test for learning curve (LC-CUSUM), has been developed that allows quantitative and individual assessment of the learning curve. Methods: Some 532 <b>endoscopic</b> <b>retrograde</b> <b>cholangiopancreatographies</b> (ERCPs) performed by one endoscopist over 8 years were analysed retrospectively using LC-CUSUM to assess the learning curve. The procedure was new to the endoscopist and monitored prospectively in the initial study. Success of the procedure was defined as cannulation and proper visualization of the duct(s) selected before the examination. Results: Fifty ERCPs were considered unsuccessful. There was a gradual improvement in performance over time from a success rate of 82 · 0 per cent for the first 100 procedures to 96 · 1 per cent for the last 129 procedures. The LC-CUSUM signalled at the 79 th procedure, indicating that sufficient evidence had accumulated {{to prove that the}} endoscopist was competent.

40|$|BACKGROUND: There is no uniformly {{accepted}} {{classification system}} for the range of cholangiographic abnormalities encountered in primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). The aims {{of this study were}} to evaluate a previously developed classification system and to test the hypothesis that the pancreatic duct can be involved in PSC. METHODS: Two observers scored 132 <b>endoscopic</b> <b>retrograde</b> <b>cholangiopancreatographies</b> (ERCPs) from established PSC patients. From 30 patients, subsequent ERCPs were scored and compared with the initial ERCPs. The pancreatic duct was judged with regard to morphologic abnormalities. RESULTS: The classification system was applicable in 107 patients. In 10 ERCPs (7. 6 %), no clear intrahepatic abnormalities were found; 15 other ERCPs (11. 4 %) did not show extrahepatic abnormalities. In 30 cases, a subsequent ERCP was judged. The difference in scoring between the initial and the subsequent ERCPs was statistically significant, with the subsequent ERCP having higher intrahepatic and extrahepatic scores. Sixty-four adequately filled pancreatic ducts were analyzed. In two cases (3. 1 %), morphologic abnormalities were found. CONCLUSIONS: The previously developed scoring system is very applicable for almost all PSC patients when supplemented with a type 0 category.

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all <b>endoscopic</b> <b>retrograde</b> <b>cholangiopancreatographies</b> (ERCPs) performed between July 2013 and May 2015 at a single tertiary referral center. A total of 1187 ERCPs were performed during the study period. Among them, 114 patients who underwent ENBD were enrolled in this study. In those patients, we used the endoscopic hands-off technique between July 2013 and May 2014 (endoscopy group) and the conventional technique between June 2014 and May 2015 (conventional group).

40|$|Summary  Eightly five {{malpractice}} {{claims against}} gastroenterologists have been analysed. Thirty seven (44 %) arose from adverse events {{as a result}} of endoscopy and 48 (56 %) from clinical practice. In 31 (84 %) of the endoscopy cases (including all 13 <b>endoscopic</b> <b>retrograde</b> <b>cholangiopancreatographies)</b> there seemed to be significant fault. In nine cases the procedure was not clearly indicated and in 10 recognition and treatment of the adverse event was delayed. In no case had the patient given adequate informed consent. Diagnostic error was responsible for most of the claims related to clinical practice (31 of 48) of which 13 were indefensible. Failure to obtain an adequate history (17 cases) and insufficient awareness of disorders of the small intestine (12 cases) were major factors. In 26 cases a key investigation was not performed. Seventeen claims were related to management or treatment but only one of these cases was difficult to defend.   Overall, there was evidence of serious fault in 50 % of claims. Greater care in selecting patients for endoscopic procedures and in providing postprocedural care would have eliminated the basis of more than half the claims arising from endoscopy. There would have been few claims if properly informed consent had been obtained. Over-ready acceptance of the diagnosis of a functional disorder (for example, irritable bowel, dyspepsia) was the usual cause of delays in diagnosis. ...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Specialist {{training}} in gastroenterology and hepatology is not standardised in different European countries. Aim: The {{aim of this}} survey {{was to assess the}} different teaching and socioeconomic aspects of training programmes in Europe. METHODS: Seventy questionnaires were distributed to last year trainees or newly graduated gastroenterologists. Forty two respondents (60 %) from 34 major training centres in 10 different European countries replied. RESULTS: Overall, the data revealed major diversity for all aspects analysed, between and within the different European countries. Both the duration of training (range 4 - 10. 4 years) and workload (range 48. 5 - 89. 2 hours per week) differed markedly between countries. The average number of endoscopic procedures (gastroscopies, range 300 - 2600; colonoscopies, range 73 - 550; <b>endoscopic</b> <b>retrograde</b> <b>cholangiopancreatographies,</b> range 1 - 385) differed also. One third of last year trainees reported that they felt uncertain in some endoscopic procedure. The European trainee was on call for 5 - 6 nights a month on average (range 1 - 8). Monthly wages differed considerably between countries, ranging from 767 to 2180 Euro. CONCLUSION: We found major differences in the professional aspects and socioeconomic conditions of gastroenterologist/hepatologist {{training in}} 10 different European countries, probably leading to differences in quality of training.

Retrospective review of <b>endoscopic</b> <b>retrograde</b> <b>cholangiopancreatographies</b> (ERCPs) performed for biliary SOD between 2003 and 2007 and proposal for new management guidelines. Patients were identified from the ERCP database. All patients {{had a history of}} typical biliary pain and were classified into three groups - group 1 : patients with dilated common bile duct and abnormal laboratory investigations at time of pain; group 2 : either of the above; group 3 : none of the above. All patients underwent ERCP and endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES). Sphincter of Oddi manometry was not carried out. Patients were contacted 18 months after procedure with regard to relief of pain and complications. Seventy-two patients were included - 16. 7 % male and 83. 3 % female with an average age of 54. 2 years. Ampullary stenosis was found in 76. 2 % of patients in group 1 and 70 % in group 2 compared with 30 % in group 3. In group 1, 90. 5 % of patients reported complete relief of pain compared with 75 and 50 % in groups 2 and 3, respectively. Among them 55. 6 % of patients had previous cholecystectomy. Overall 85 % of cholecystectomized patients and 81. 3 % of patients with an intact gallbladder had complete response to ES. There were no complications in all three groups. Our findings are similar to other studies documenting response rates to ES in manometry proven SOD. Our simpler guidelines are more applicable to clinical practice. Group 3 remains the most challenging group. Risk and benefits of ERCP and ES should be discussed with patients in centres where sphincter of Oddi manometry is unavailable, noting that 50 % of patients respond favourably to ES...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntroductionFocal {{intrahepatic}} strictures {{are becoming}} more common owing to more prevalent and accurate cross‐sectional imaging. However, data relating to their management are lacking. The {{purpose of the present}} review was to synthesize the current evidence regarding these lesions and to formulate a strategy for diagnosis and management. MethodsA literature search of relevant terms was performed using Medline. References of papers were subsequently searched to obtain older literature. ResultsFocal intrahepatic strictures involve segmental hepatic ducts and/or left and right main hepatic ducts during their intrahepatic course. Most patients are asymptomatic while the minority present with vague abdominal pain or recurrent sepsis and only rarely with jaundice. Investigations used to distinguish benign from malignant aetiologies include blood tests (CEA, Ca 19. 9), imaging studies [ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and fluorodeoxyglucose‐positron emission tomography (FDG‐PET) ], <b>endoscopic</b> modalities [endoscopic <b>retrograde</b> <b>cholangiopancreatography</b> (ERCP) /endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) /cholangioscopy] and tissue sampling (brush cytology/biopsy). ConclusionsA focal intrahepatic stricture requires thorough investigation to exclude malignancy even in patients with a history of biliary surgery, hepatolithiasis or parasitic infection. If during the investigative process a diagnosis or suspicion of malignancy is demonstrated then surgical resection should be performed. If all diagnostic modalities suggest a benign aetiology, then cholangioscopy with targeted biopsies should be performed...|$|R

An algorithmic approach for the management of these injuries is proposed. METHODS: During a 6 -year period 234 patients who had undergone major hepatobiliary surgery were retrospectively reviewed in order to study postoperative bile leakage. Diagnostic workup included <b>endoscopic</b> and magnetic <b>retrograde</b> <b>cholangiopancreatography</b> (E/MRCP), scintigraphy and fistulography. RESULTS: Thirty (12. 8 %) patients who developed postoperative bile leaks were identified. Endoscopic stenting and percutaneous drainage were successful in 23 patients with bile leaks from the liver cut surface. In the rest seven patients with injuries of hepatic duct confluence, biliary variations were recognized and a stepwise therapeutic approach was considered. Conservative management was successful only in 2 patients. Volume of the liver remnant and functional liver reserve as well as local sepsis were used as criteria for either resection of the corresponding liver segment or construction of a biliary-enteric anastomosis. Two deaths occurred in this group of patients with hepatic duct confluence variants (mortality rate 28. 5 %). CONCLUSION: Management of major biliary fistulae that are disconnected from the mainstream of the biliary tree and related to injury of variants of the hepatic duct confluence is extremely challenging.
