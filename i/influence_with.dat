5|$|Alexander was {{nominated}} to the see of Lincoln in April 1123 and was consecrated bishop on 22 July 1123, {{at a ceremony}} held in Canterbury. He owed his appointment to his uncle's <b>influence</b> <b>with</b> King Henry I; the Peterborough version of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle noted that Alexander's elevation to the episcopate was done entirely {{for the love of}} Roger.|$|E
5|$|All Bismarck's {{resources}} were deployed; he even asked Empress Victoria {{to use her}} <b>influence</b> <b>with</b> her son on his behalf. But the wizard had lost his magic; his spells were powerless because they were exerted on {{people who did not}} respect them, and he who had so signally disregarded Kant's command to use people as ends in themselves had too small a stock of loyalty to draw on. As Lord Salisbury told Queen Victoria: 'The very qualities which Bismarck fostered in the Emperor in order to strengthen himself when the Emperor Frederick should come to the throne have been the qualities by which he has been overthrown.' The Empress, with what must have been a mixture of pity and triumph, told him that her <b>influence</b> <b>with</b> her son could not save him for he himself had destroyed it.|$|E
5|$|As the Celtic {{domination}} in {{this part}} of Europe {{was coming to an end}} and the borders of the Roman Empire had gotten much closer, the Przeworsk culture people were being subjected to the Greco-Roman world's <b>influence</b> <b>with</b> a rapidly growing intensity.|$|E

5|$|Doug Sweetland {{made his}} directorial debut with Presto. Sweetland {{provides}} the dialogue-free voice acting {{for both of}} the movie's characters. He pitched the film {{at the start of}} 2007 and began production late in the year, completing it in May 2008. Prestos gag based format was heavily influenced by classic cartoons. Looney Tunes cartoons directed by Tex Avery were a major <b>influence,</b> <b>with</b> Alec being easily compared to Bugs Bunny. Other influences include Tom and Jerry, the Marx Brothers, and Charlie Chaplin. The character design for Presto was based on William Powell.|$|E
5|$|Frusciante's {{first major}} {{influence}} was Jimi Hendrix. He then saw The Red Hot Chili Peppers (at that point, The {{was part of}} their name) in concert in 1985, after which their then-guitarist Hillel Slovak became his second major <b>influence,</b> <b>with</b> Frusciante coming to idolize Slovak. Although Hendrix and Slovak were arguably Frusciante's most profound influences, he was also inspired by glam rock artists David Bowie, and T. Rex; as well as avant-garde acts such as Syd Barrett, Captain Beefheart, The Residents, The Velvet Underground, Neu!, Van der Graaf Generator, Frank Zappa, and Kraftwerk.|$|E
5|$|Germany is {{the second}} largest music market in Europe, and fourth largest in the world. German popular music of the 20th and 21st century {{includes}} the movements of Neue Deutsche Welle, pop, Ostrock, heavy metal/rock, punk, pop rock, indie and schlager pop. German electronic music gained global <b>influence,</b> <b>with</b> Kraftwerk and Tangerine Dream pioneering in this genre. DJs and artists of the techno and house music scenes of Germany have become well known (e.g. Felix Jaehn, Paul van Dyk, Paul Kalkbrenner, and Scooter).|$|E

5|$|Houston City Council District J now covers Gulfton. District J {{was created}} in 2011 to allow Hispanic voters to more easily select {{candidates}} who cater to them. Robert Jara, a political consultant of the group Campaign Strategies, drew the boundaries of District J {{in order to ensure}} that Gulfton and Sharpstown were together in one area. That way, the Hispanic residents could lobby for <b>influence</b> <b>with</b> their city council representative, whether he or she is of Hispanic origin or not.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{served as}} Vice President from March 4, 1837, to March 4, 1841. His term was largely unremarkable, and he enjoyed little <b>influence</b> <b>with</b> President Van Buren. His penchant for {{wielding}} his power {{for his own}} interests did not abate. He lobbied the Senate to promote Samuel Milroy, whom he owed a favor, {{to the position of}} Indian agent. When Lewis Tappan requested presentation of an abolitionist petition to the Senate, Johnson, who was still a slaveholder, declined the request.|$|E
5|$|Kennan lost <b>influence</b> <b>with</b> Acheson, who in {{any case}} relied much less on his staff than Marshall had. Kennan {{resigned}} as director of policy planning in December 1949 but stayed in the department as counselor until June 1950. In January 1950, Acheson replaced Kennan with Nitze, who was much {{more comfortable with the}} calculus of military power. Afterwards, Kennan accepted an appointment as Visitor to the Institute for Advanced Study from fellow moderate Robert Oppenheimer, Director of the Institute.|$|E

5|$|Minton {{received}} a death {{threat in the}} form of an envelope containing a shotgun shell and a message advising him to not vote for the court packing plan. Many Democrats, fearing their re-election prospects, joined with Republicans and defeated the bill. Minton was unhappy with the loss and it cost him considerable support among his voters, but as a result of his close connection with the bill and the leaders of his party, he gained more <b>influence</b> <b>with</b> the Democrats.|$|E

In 2009, two separate documents from Jilin province and Liaoning Province described how legal cases against Falun Gong practitioners {{must be approved}} and/or audited by the 610 Office. The 610 Office's organizational proximity to the CPC's Political and Judicial Committee better enables it to exercise <b>influence</b> <b>with</b> the Supreme People's Court and Ministry of Justice, both at the central level and with their counterparts at local levels.|$|E
5|$|On Baker's retirement, Gould was {{unanimously}} elected President on 20 February 1907. He endeavoured to {{keep the}} Senate representative of the states' interests and free from party politics, and his rulings focused on unparliamentary language and relevance. Gould, appointed Knight Bachelor in 1908, differed from his predecessor in his adherence to British <b>influence.</b> <b>With</b> {{the election of the}} Fisher Labor Government in 1910, Gould was defeated by Harry Turley for the presidency.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} battle, Tissaphernes {{had arrived in}} the Hellespont and Alcibiades left the fleet at Sestos to meet him, {{bringing}} gifts and hoping to once again try to win over the Persian governor. Evidently Alcibiades had gravely misjudged his standing with the satrap, and he was arrested on arrival. Within a month he would escape and resume command. It was now obvious, however, that he had no <b>influence</b> <b>with</b> the Persians; from now on his authority would depend on what he actually could accomplish rather than on what he promised to do.|$|E
5|$|Tammany Hall, a Democratic Party {{political}} machine, {{began to}} grow in <b>influence</b> <b>with</b> the support {{of many of the}} immigrant Irish, culminating in the election of the first Tammany mayor, Fernando Wood, in 1854. Tammany Hall dominated local politics for decades. Central Park, which opened to the public in 1858, became the first landscaped public park in an American city.|$|E
5|$|The gallery {{itself was}} a fashionable hit with the public. Newspapers carried updates of the {{construction}} of the gallery, down to drawings for the proposed façade.

5|$|The {{potential}} political {{threat to}} Apollo blew over, {{due in large}} part to the support of President Lyndon B. Johnson, who at the time still wielded a measure of <b>influence</b> <b>with</b> the Congress from his own Senatorial experience. He was a staunch supporter of NASA since its inception, had even recommended the Moon program to President John F. Kennedy in 1961, and was skilled at portraying it as part of Kennedy's legacy.|$|E
5|$|The {{short and}} unworthy reigns of Radu V’s successors only {{increased}} {{the crisis of}} Wallachia. Starting with Mircea the Shepherd (15451559), the first prince placed on the throne by the sultan, the crown became negotiable, according to the largest tribute offered. Even Michael the Brave who in time would turn against the Ottomans ascended the throne {{with the support of}} some people who had <b>influence</b> <b>with</b> the Sublime Porte, among them Sir Edward Barton, the English ambassador to Istanbul.|$|E
5|$|A {{rapprochement}} {{between the}} two men was achieved in the winter of 1384, when Carrouges and Le Gris were both invited to the estate of a mutual friend, Jean Crespin, to celebrate the birth of his son. For the first time, Carrouges brought his wife Marguerite into society and it was at this party that she made her first acquaintance with Le Gris. Despite the tension between them, Carrouges and Le Gris shook hands and drank together, putting their quarrel behind them before their peers and neighbours. A few months later Jean de Carrouges departed on campaign to Scotland and Le Gris took the opportunity to increase his <b>influence</b> <b>with</b> the Count, making substantial financial and territorial gains in the his rival's absence. Carrouges returned a year later, now a knight but bankrupt, ill and suffering the aftermath of a long and unsuccessful campaign. When Carrouges appeared at Argentan in January 1386 he was involved in a confrontation with his erstwhile friend. Although it is not known what was said, the two men separated on poor terms and Carrouges departed for Paris in a state of agitation.|$|E
