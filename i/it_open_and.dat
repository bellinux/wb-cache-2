However, her stone corner freezes to shot rock, leaving <b>it</b> <b>open,</b> <b>and</b> giving Jones an intricate shot for two or three. Jones hits the Saskatchewan stone at the wrong angle, and only takes the one.|$|E

They didn't know it, but they were only a few metres from Ceaușescu. The lift's electricity failed just before it reached the top floor, and Ceaușescu's bodyguards forced <b>it</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> ushered the couple onto the roof.|$|E

25|$|The regular {{garrison}} of Stirling {{had actually}} been reduced to bolster the forces at Edinburgh. However Major General William Blakeney could call on {{the service of the}} remaining regulars, 320 (eight companies) of militia, his Volunteer Battalion of 200 men and a number of armed townsmen. The castle was strong both by its nature and also thanks to a recent programme of re-fortification. The Jacobites would need a heavy cannon to crack <b>it</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> their French allies had landed a consignment of such artillery at Montrose, including two 18-pounders, two 12-pounders and two 9-pounders, which Lord John Drummond was bringing from the north-east.|$|E
25|$|For the 12 seasons (1984–96) {{prior to}} the Phantoms' founding, the National Hockey League (NHL)'s Philadelphia Flyers had {{maintained}} a highly-successful affiliation with the AHL's oldest franchise, the Hershey Bears, which included a Calder Cup title in 1988. In September 1996, however, the Flyers left their long-time home arena, the Spectrum, and moved {{across the parking lot}} into the soon-to-be-completed CoreStates Center. Instead of demolishing the Spectrum, Comcast Spectacor, the owner of both arenas as well as the Flyers, elected to keep <b>it</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> active, but doing so would require a tenant to fill the 80 to 100 NHL and National Basketball Association (NBA) dates the Spectrum would lose to the CoreStates Center.|$|E
25|$|Traffic to Stowmarket did not recover, {{but there}} was some traffic through the lower four locks, with barges serving the Fison's and Packard's {{fertiliser}} factories at Bramford. By 1917, {{it was no longer}} economical to keep <b>it</b> <b>open,</b> <b>and</b> it closed in 1922, although a formal closing order was not obtained until the early 1930s. After a period of decay, the local branch of the Inland Waterways Association raised the idea of restoring it. The River Gipping Trust now spearhead this work, and several of the lock chambers have been restored, while the Gipping Valley River Path had been established along the towpath. There are many listed buildings along the course of the river, including some of the locks and bridges, several of the mill buildings, and Fison's fertiliser warehouse at Bramford.|$|E

25|$|On July 13, 1991, Bruce Hamill {{went to a}} {{hardware}} store, bought a plumber's wrench, hatchet, knives and a sleeping bag, {{then went to the}} Brockville hospital and signed out Krueger on his first publicly escorted day pass. During the first hour of his first weekend pass (unsupervised release) in 34 years, Krueger arranged to meet Dennis Kerr in the woods near Brockville where Krueger would loan Kerr five hundred dollars. When Dennis Kerr arrived as instructed, Krueger struck him in the head with the pipe wrench and continued to beat him into unconsciousness. Krueger and Hamill then seized the hatchet and knife they had hidden in the bushes while waiting for Kerr's arrival and hacked and stabbed Kerr, mutilating his body, cutting <b>it</b> <b>open,</b> <b>and</b> nearly severing his head. Drenched in Kerr's blood, they then stripped themselves naked and sodomized the corpse. Krueger then left the scene, walked to a police station about two miles away, and turned himself in.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} based on actual recent {{research}} and involved much collaboration among the series' different departments. For the scene in which they remove the victim's eyeball, the special effects crew created a mold based on actress Elizabeth Stanley's head. Using plaster to make a prosthetic, they [...] "drilled out the eyeball and sculpt <b>it</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> [...] {{through a series of}} molds." [...] Stanley stated that [...] "it's really cool to see the head because it really does look just like me, even though it's very gruesome because the eyeball's popping out." [...] The prop department rigged a weapon which they called a [...] "photon gun"; according to prop master Peter Gelfman, this gun {{was based on}} real devices employed in airport security that look through people's clothing for concealed weapons. VFX Supervisor Christopher Scollard explained that for the eye's last vision, they used [...] "a lot of actual photographic reference on the set and on the location," [...] which they then used to [...] "take that imagery and composite it into the various computer monitors and displays in the lab." ...|$|E
500|$|The French action {{drew the}} {{attention}} of not just the British, but also the Indian tribes of the area. [...] Despite good Franco-Indian relations, British traders had become highly successful in convincing the Indians to trade with them in preference to the Canadiens, and the planned large-scale advance was not well received by all. [...] In particular, Tanacharison, a Mingo chief {{also known as the}} [...] "Half King", became decidedly anti-French as a consequence. [...] In a meeting with Paul Marin de la Malgue, commander of the French and Canadien construction force, the latter reportedly lost his temper, and shouted at the Indian chief, [...] "I tell you, down the river I will go. [...] If the river is blocked up, I have the forces to burst <b>it</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> tread under my feet all that oppose me. [...] I despise all the stupid things you have said." [...] He then threw down some wampum that Tanacharison had offered as a good will gesture. [...] Marin died not long after, and command of the operations was turned over to Jacques Legardeur de Saint-Pierre.|$|E

500|$|Worcester was {{occupied}} by Sir John Byron on 16 September 1647, who {{was on his way}} to deliver wagons of silver plate from Oxford to the Charles I at Shrewsbury. Byron realising that he could not hold Worcester with a Parliamentary army under the command of Earl of Essex already approaching city, he had sent a request to the King for additional forces to aid him. The Parliamentarians were aware of Byron's mission and an advanced force under the command of Colonel Nathaniel Fiennes arrived at the Sidbury Gate early on 22 September. What followed was typical of the inexperienced soldiery on both sides. The Parliamentarians were not challenged as they approached the gate and had they but known it they could have pushed <b>it</b> <b>open</b> <b>and</b> been into the town without difficultly. However they struck the gates with an axe which made a hole in it and then fired a musket through the hole. This aroused the lax Royalist guard who called out the Royalist garrison. The Parliamentarian assault team quickly withdrew. They then loosely [...] invested the north of the city. In doing so they hoped to prevent Byron and his convoy leaving the city, which could be taken by Essex's main force in a day or so.|$|E
