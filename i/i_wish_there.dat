5|$|Those {{lyrics are}} crazy. I {{listen to that}} like, 'What was she doing?' Pharrell's just so creative, I {{remember}} back then, and he's always kind of been the same. He's always so positive and so sure and he never wants to repeat himself. Like, 'How can I make something different and new and not like anything else?' I look back at that whole record, and I think, 'Wow <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>there</b> was more time to do more singles.' You only get {{so many things that}} people hear.|$|E

[...] Kapeau was {{appointed}} Secretary of the Treasury. In 1843, he and Jonah Kapena served as clerks in the 1843 {{session of the}} Legislature of Hawaii at Lahaina.|$|E
500|$|Belcher's {{merchant}} interests {{included the}} occasional trafficking in slaves. [...] He {{is known to}} have owned slaves, ordering them from his friend, Isaac Royall, Sr. [...] He presented an enslaved Indian to Electress Sophia on his second visit to Hanover in 1708. [...] Despite this, he expressed a distaste for slavery, writing in 1739, [...] "We have but few in these parts, and <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>there</b> were less." ...|$|E

500|$|A year later, {{while working}} with Tin Machine on their second album, he mused on his {{previous}} few albums: [...] "You can tell I was terribly unhappy {{in the late}} '80s. ... I was in that netherworld of commercial acceptance. It was an awful trip. 1983, '84, '85, '86, '87 - those five years were simply dreadful. ... Never Let Me Down had good songs that I mistreated. I didn't really apply myself. I wasn't quite sure what I {{was supposed to be}} doing. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>there</b> had been someone around who could have told me." ...|$|E
500|$|In a 2001 Interzone essay, author Gene Wolfe defended Brooks' {{derivation}} {{of material}} from Tolkien: [...] "Terry Brooks {{has often been}} disparaged for imitating Tolkien, particularly by those reviewers who find his books inferior to Tolkien's own. I can say only that <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>there</b> were more imitators -- we need them -- and that all imitations of so great an original must necessarily be inferior." [...] In a commentary for The New York Times Book Review, Frank Herbert, author of the science fiction novel Dune, also defended Brooks, saying: ...|$|E
500|$|The {{length of}} time between album {{releases}} has led to rumours in the media concerning her health or appearance. In 2011 Bush told BBC Radio 4 {{that the amount of}} time between album releases is extremely stressful, noting: [...] "It's very frustrating the albums take as long as they do... <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>there</b> weren't such big gaps between them". In the same interview Bush denied she was a perfectionist in the studio, saying: [...] "I think it's important that things are flawed... That's what makes a piece of art interesting sometimes – the bit that's wrong or the mistake you've made that's led onto an idea you wouldn't have had otherwise", and reiterated her prioritisation of her family life.|$|E

500|$|During 1940, Friedman was {{appointed}} {{an assistant professor}} teaching Economics at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, but encountered antisemitism in the Economics department and {{decided to return to}} government service. From 1941 to 1943 Friedman worked on wartime tax policy for the federal government, as an advisor to senior officials of the United States Department of the Treasury. As a Treasury spokesman during 1942 he advocated a Keynesian policy of taxation. He helped to invent the payroll withholding tax system, since the federal government badly needed money in order to fight the war. He later said, [...] "I have no apologies for it, but I really wish we hadn't found it necessary and <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>there</b> were some way of abolishing withholding now." ...|$|E
500|$|Champion {{held out}} for several hours, {{wounding}} three of the vigilantes, and {{was said to have}} killed four others. Another settler by the name of Jack Flagg passed by Champion's ranch on his wagon together with his stepson and witnessed the siege. The Invaders recognized Jack Flagg as one of the men on the list and they started shooting at him. Flagg then rode away and as the Invaders gave chase, he grabbed his rifle and beat them back. During the siege, Champion kept a poignant journal which contained a number of notes he wrote to friends while taking cover inside the cabin. [...] "Boys, I feel pretty lonesome just now. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>there</b> was someone here with me so we could watch all sides at once," [...] he wrote. The last journal entry read: [...] "Well, they have just got through shelling the house like hail. I heard them splitting wood. I guess they are going to fire the house tonight. I think I will make a break when night comes, if alive. Shooting again. It's not night yet. The house is all fired. Goodbye, boys, if I never see you again." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1994–95, McManaman {{got a new}} million pound contract, and {{was given}} a central, freer role by new coach Roy Evans, who wanted to utilise McManaman's natural running and {{dribbling}} ability to drift all over the park. It proved a successful decision as McManaman began mesmerising defences with runs that were later to become hallmarks of the Liverpool side of the 1990s. That season he collected a League Cup winner's medal after scoring twice in his side's 2–1 win over Bolton Wanderers; such was his performance that fans named it [...] "The McManaman Final". For his second Wembley final appearance in succession he was awarded man of the match, earning the Alan Hardaker Trophy and a tribute from guest of honour, celebrated veteran winger Sir Stanley Matthews, who exclaimed after the final, [...] "He reminds me of me when I was playing... <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>there</b> are more dribblers like him." ...|$|E

2500|$|As the PBS series Frontline explored, MTV was {{a driving}} force that catapulted music videos to a {{mainstream}} audience, turning music videos into an art form {{as well as a}} marketing machine that became beneficial to artists. Danny Goldberg, chairman and CEO of Artemis Records, said the following about the art of music videos: [...] "I know when I worked with Nirvana, Kurt Cobain cared as much about the videos as he did about the records. He wrote the scripts for them, he was in the editing room, and they were part of his art. And I think they stand up as part of his art, and I think that's true of the great artists today. Not every artist is a great artist and not every video is a good video, but in general having it available as a tool, to me, adds to the business. And <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>there</b> had been music videos in the heyday of The Beatles, and The Rolling Stones. I think they would've added to their creative contribution, not subtracted from it." ...|$|E

5000|$|Greville {{is famous}} for having read ‘Uncle Dodgson’s’ (Reverend Charles Dodgson, {{otherwise}} known as Lewis Carroll) Alice in Wonderland when he was wondering whether to publish it. Greville’s mother read the book to the children to gauge its worth if published, and Greville remembers his ‘braggart avowal that <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>there</b> were 60,000 volumes of it’. [...] Carroll had been uncertain as to its potential for publication, until he tried the manuscript with the MacDonald children and had an enthusiastic reception.|$|R

60|$|Indeed, {{the insistence}} with which this article of {{furniture}} throughout the evening called attention to its sufferings was really quite distracting. With every breath that Mrs. Sellars took it moaned wearily. There were moments when it literally shrieked. I could not have accepted Mrs. Sellars' offer had <b>I</b> <b>wished,</b> <b>there</b> being no chair vacant and no room for another. A young man with watery eyes, sitting just behind me between a fat young lady and a lean one, rose and suggested my taking his place. Miss Sellars introduced me to him as her cousin Joseph something or other, and we shook hands.|$|R
