Distributing water to achieve social equity will exclude economic efficiency if government provides subsidies, free services, or administratively sets water pricing to make water available to those not able to pay market price for water. Equity is also a concern for water markets in the sense participating buyers and sellers should perceive equal opportunity gains in a transaction (which theoretically should occur if water is priced according to the <b>equimarginal</b> principle).|$|E

Our <b>equimarginal</b> condition for optimal budget allocation equates the relative marginal economic benefits per dollar spent across regions. The model was applied to Florida Public Conservation Land regions, and {{results indicate that the}} magnitude of an annual management budget affects its distribution among species management regions, but the size of the intrinsic growth rate does not affect the pattern of budget allocation among regions. budget allocation, <b>equimarginal</b> condition, Florida invasive species, invasive plants, optimal control, B 41, C 02, Q 51, Q 57,...|$|E

In TAC SCM, manufacturers compete to procure com-puter parts from suppliers, and then sell assembled comput-ers to customers in reverse auctions. To address the bidding problem, an agent decides how many computers to sell and at what prices to sell them. We propose a greedy solution, Marginal Bidding, inspired by the <b>Equimarginal</b> Principle, which states that revenue is maximized among possible uses of a resource when the return on the last unit of the resource is the same across all areas of use.

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} fast and {{effective}} bidding {{strategy for the}} Trading Agent Competition in Supply Chain Management (TAC SCM). In TAC SCM, manufacturers compete to procure computer parts from suppliers (the procurement problem), and then sell assembled computers to customers in reverse auctions (the bidding problem). This paper is concerned only with bidding, in which an agent must decide how many computers to sell and at what prices to sell them. We propose a greedy solution, Marginal Bidding, inspired by the <b>Equimarginal</b> Principle, which states that revenue is maximized among possible uses of a resource when the return on the last unit of the resource is the same across all areas of use. We show experimentally that certain variations of Marginal Bidding can compute bids faster than our ILP solution, which enables Marginal Bidders to consider future demand as well as current demand, and hence achieve greater revenues when knowledge {{of the future is}} valuable. ...|$|E

In a model that represents explicitly low-carbon capital accumulation, optimal marginal investment costs differ across sectors. They are equal {{to the value of}} avoided carbon emissions over time, minus the value of the forgone option to invest later. It is therefore misleading to assess the cost-efficiency of investments in low-carbon capital by comparing levelized abatement costs, measured as the ratio of investment costs to discounted abatement. The <b>equimarginal</b> principle applies to an accounting value: the Marginal Implicit Rental Cost of the Capital (MIRCC) used to abate. Two apparently opposite views are reconciled. On the one hand, higher efforts are justified in sectors that will take longer to decarbonize, such as transport and urban planning; on the other hand, the MIRCC should be equal to the carbon price at each point in time and in all sectors. Equalizing the MIRCC in each sector to the social cost of carbon is a necessary condition to reach the optimal pathway, {{but it is not a}} sufficient condition. Decentralized optimal investment decisions at the sector level require not only the information contained in the carbon price signal, but also knowledge of the date when the sector reaches its full abatement potential...|$|E
