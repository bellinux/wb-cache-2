50|$|<b>Himalayan</b> <b>goral</b> often form small {{bands of}} four to twelve individuals, {{although}} they are also known to pair off or, {{especially in the case}} of older males, be solitary. The animal is crepuscular, being most active in the early morning and late evening. After a morning meal, it often drinks and then rests on a rock ledge through the day. It feeds on leaves and associated softer parts of plants, mainly grasses.The <b>Himalayan</b> <b>goral</b> is very agile and can run quickly. Due to its coloration it is very well camouflaged, so that it is extremely difficult to sight it, especially since it spends much of the day lying still. However, it is hunted by various predators. When threatened, the <b>Himalayan</b> <b>goral</b> will vocalize with hissing or sneezing sounds.|$|E
50|$|<b>Himalayan</b> <b>gorals</b> {{are found}} in the forests of the Himalayas {{including}} Bhutan, northern India including Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh, Nepal, southern Tibet, and possibly western Myanmar. They inhabit most of the southern slopes of the Himalayas from Jammu and Kashmir to eastern Arunachal Pradesh. In India and Nepal they are present at elevations from 900 to 2750 m. In Pakistan they have been recorded from 1000 to 4000 m altitude but their present occurrence in Punjab is doubtful. Group home range size is typically around 40 ha, with males occupying marked territories of 22 - 25 ha during the mating season.In Pakistan, a minimum of 370-1017 grey goral are distributed in seven isolated populations as of 2004.|$|R

40|$|<b>Himalayan</b> grey <b>goral</b> (Naemorhedus goral bedfordi) is a Red List (Near Threatened) {{member of}} Caprinae endemic to Asia, occupying the south-facing {{slopes of the}} Himalaya Mountains. The species is listed as Vulnerable on the National Pakistan Red List, but the {{distribution}} and abundance of the species within the nation is poorly known. We conducted a national census of <b>Himalayan</b> grey <b>goral</b> in Pakistan during 2002 – 2004, {{with the objective of}} documenting the geographic locations of populations, estimating population size, and describing group sizes and sex ratios. We conducted a direct count census in 98 sites distributed over the 4839 km 2 of suitable grey goral habitat. We counted 172 unique grey goral individuals: 143 adults and 29 subadults. We estimated a minimum of 370 – 1017 grey goral in Pakistan distributed in seven isolated populations. The adult sex ratio was female-biased nearly 2 : 1, and the mean size of social groups was 1. 72 ± 0. 11 SE individuals. Our data support the National Red List status of <b>Himalayan</b> grey <b>goral</b> as Vulnerable, because no subpopulation probably contains 3 ̆e 1000 individuals. We are unable to account for the sex ratio bias. Social group size is comparable with contemporary observations from India, but much lower than that reported a century ago.

HGG population is isolated into 7 - 8 subpopulations and is facing male-biased mortality, therefore is likely to face bottleneck effects and subsequent population crash ascribed to loss of males and genetic diversity. HGG population has a slow growth rate, attributable to internal species potentials and the natural predation of fawns/ sub-adults, which is difficult to be enhanced therefore range management strategy is suggested as management solution, with emphasis on protection from hunting, habitat management, mass awareness and supportive research.

25|$|The diet of {{the snow}} leopard varies across its range and with the time of year, and depends on prey availability. In the Himalayas, it preys mostly on bharals (Himalayan blue sheep), but in other {{mountain}} ranges, such as the Karakoram, Tian Shan, Altai and Tost Mountains of Mongolia, its main prey consists of Siberian ibex and argali, a type of wild sheep, although the latter has become rarer in some parts {{of the snow}} leopard's range. Other large animals eaten when available can include various types of wild goats and sheep (such as markhors and urials), other goat-like ruminants such as <b>Himalayan</b> tahr and <b>gorals,</b> plus deer, red panda, wild boars, and langur monkeys. Smaller prey consists of marmots, woolly hares, pikas, various rodents, and birds such as the snow cock and chukar.|$|R

The area is now an important habitat for the snow leopard, grey wolf, musk deer, blue sheep and the Himalayan tahr.|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} highlands include lower elevation {{areas of}} Potohar and Azad Kashmir regions and higher elevation areas embracing {{the foothills of}} Himalayan, Karakorum and Hindukush mountain ranges.

50|$|The {{largest of}} these goat {{antelope}} is the takin, {{a relative of}} the musk ox. It lives in highlands from the eastern foothills of the Himalayas to the Qinling and shares habitat with the giant panda in Sichuan and Shaanxi. The takin is a Class I protected species.Serows are smaller than takins but significantly larger than gorals. Both serows and gorals live in rainy mountainous regions and are excellent climbers. Serows have shorter and coarser wool than gorals. The mainland serow is spread across southern China. The range of the Chinese goral is even broader, extending to Korea in the northeast. The long-tailed goral lives in the northeast, along the borders with Russia and North Korea. The Himalayan serow, <b>Himalayan</b> <b>goral,</b> and red goral are found in southern Tibet. The Taiwan serow is endemic to Taiwan.|$|E
5000|$|At high altitudes, {{the elusive}} and {{endangered}} snow leopard {{is the main}} predator. Its prey includes members of the goat family grazing on the alpine pastures and living on the rocky terrain, notably the endemic bharal or Himalayan blue sheep. The Himalayan musk deer is also found at high altitude. Hunted for its musk, it is now rare and endangered. Other endemic or near endemic herbivores include the Himalayan tahr, the takin, the Himalayan serow, and the <b>Himalayan</b> <b>goral.</b> The critically endangered Himalayan subspecies of the brown bear is found sporadically across the range as is the Asian black bear. In the mountainous mixed deciduous and conifer forests of the eastern Himalayas, Red panda feed in the dense understories of bamboo.

The tahr is common, the serow, goral, musk deer and bharal, blue sheep are rare. The common leopard Panthera pardus is reported from lower parts of the valley closer to the villages. Local people have also reported evidence of brown bear Ursus arctos and bharal or blue sheep Pseudois nayaur. A recent faunal survey in October 2004 has established the presence of snow leopard Panthera uncia (EN) in the national park. The area is within the West Himalayan Endemic Bird Area but there have been no surveys specific to the Valley. 114 species were seen in 1993 in Nanda Devi Park. Species frequently seen in the valley include lammergeier Gypaetus barbatus, Himalayan vulture Gyps himalayensis, yellow billed and red billed choughs Pyrrhocorax graculus and P. pyrrhocorax, koklass pheasant Pucrasia macrolopha, the nationally listed Himalayan monal pheasant Lophophorus impejanus, found in rhododendron thickets, scaly-bellied and yellow-nape woodpeckers Picus squamatus and P. flavinucha, great and bluethroated barbets Megalaima virens and M. asiatica, snow pigeon Columba leuconota and spotted dove Stigmatopelia chinensis. The area is relatively poor in reptiles: most often seen are the high altitude lizard Agama tuberculata, Himalayan ground skink Leiolopisma himalayana and Himalayan pit viper Gloydius himalayanus. Along with the flowers are wild bees and many species of butterfly which need to be more researched. A few of the more evident species are lime butterfly Papilio demoleus demoleus, common yellow swallowtail Papilio machaon, common Mormon Papilio polytes romulus, spangle Papilio protenor protenor and common blue apollo Parnassius hardwickei.|$|E
