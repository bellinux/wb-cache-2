50|$|A <b>depositum</b> was {{a deposit}} for safekeeping. It did not {{transfer}} ownership nor possession, {{and was also}} gratuitous. Land could not {{be the subject of}} a deposit.

If the depositee used the thing, then this was considered theft by furtum usus.|$|E

50|$|Justinian {{identifies}} {{four types}} of real contract - contracts in re (in a thing) - mutuum, commodatum, <b>depositum</b> and pignus. Common to all four was an agreement, and the delivery of a res corporalis. They are in contrast to consensual and inominate contracts. Real contracts were of limited significance, although they are featured prominently {{in the works of}} jurists. If a stipulatio had to be created to cover any interest, then it could be used to cover the other elements of the transaction as well.|$|E
5000|$|According to Catholic teaching, the Church has {{received}} the complete faith by Jesus Christ through the apostles (<b>depositum</b> fidei). Led by the Holy Spirit, as promised by Christ (John 16:12-14), the Church progressively during the times [...] "unpacks" [...] and displays the germ of the creed, such keeping it actual and alive. May there be reductions or unbalances in single ages or regions, the Church as a whole, however, is trusted to be sustained in the truth and to maturate towards its complete understanding.|$|E
5000|$|According to Catholic teaching, the {{essential}} note of faith {{lies in the}} complete and unhesitating acceptance of the whole <b>depositum</b> {{on the ground that}} it is the revealed word of God. The conscious rejection of a single article of this deposit is sufficient to render a man guilty of heresy. The question is not as to the relative importance of the article in question but solely as to whether it has been revealed by God to man. This is clearly put by Thomas Aquinas in the Summa Theologica II-II:5:3: ...|$|E
50|$|In earlier medieval law, {{especially}} in Germanic law, {{two types of}} pledge existed, being either possessory (cf. Old English wed, Old French gage, Old High German wetti, Latin pignus <b>depositum),</b> i.e. delivered from the outset, or non-possessory (cf. OE bād, OFr nam, nant, OHG pfant, L pignus oppositum), i.e. distrained on the maturity date, and the latter essentially {{gave rise to the}} legal principle of distraint. This distinction still remains in some systems, e.g. French gage vs. nantissement and Dutch vuistpand vs. stil pand. Token, symbolic reciprocal pledges were commonly incorporated into formal ceremonies as a way of solidifying agreements and other transactions.|$|E
50|$|There {{were two}} special types of deposit. The {{first was the}} <b>depositum</b> irregulare of fungibles, {{normally}} money. In contrast to a usual deposit, ownership did pass, granting more rights to the depositee to protect the property. It had to be returned on request, and the transferee could derive no benefit from it. The second was sequestrio, whereby a thing whose ownerhsip was disputed was deposited with a third party, bound to {{return it to the}} successful party in a vindicatio or similar action. Because possession passed, both parties were prevented from usucapting until the disagreement was settled. It could be used in relation to land or movables.|$|E
50|$|Inst. 2.23.1 {{shows it}} was Augustus {{who made the}} fideicommissum legally binding by favouring it in {{individual}} cases. Thus its acceptance was directly based on Emperor’s Acts, but even previous to this the fideicommissum never lacked enforceability. The true reason for it lies {{in the nature of}} the institution itself. Personal security in Rome was far more important than it is today, mostly because the Romans attached more weight to the duties of a friendship. Therefore certain legal institutions were simply based on bona fides (e.g. the tutela, societas, <b>depositum),</b> which did not decrease but rather enforce their security. Breach of a fiduciary agreement lead inevitably to being infamis, which meant the lifetime incapability of taking part in any commercial actions. This threat was force enough, and ensured the fiduciaries would not fail. As a matter of honores, consideration was not required.|$|E

5000|$|Sanctification he {{described}} in 1790 as the [...] "grand <b>depositum</b> which God has lodged {{with the people}} called 'Methodists'." [...] Wesley taught that sanctification was obtainable after justification by faith, between justification and death. He did not contend for [...] "sinless perfection"; rather, he contended that a Christian could be made [...] "perfect in love". (Wesley studied Eastern Orthodoxy and particularly the doctrine of Theosis). This love would mean, first of all, that a believer's motives, rather than being self-centred, would be guided by the deep desire to please God. One {{would be able to}} keep from committing what Wesley called, [...] "sin rightly so-called." [...] By this he meant a conscious or intentional breach of God's will or laws. A person could still be able to sin, but intentional or wilful sin could be avoided.|$|E
5000|$|The word [...] "tradition" [...] {{is taken}} from the Latin trado, tradere meaning [...] "to hand over, to deliver, to bequeath". The teachings of Jesus Christ and the holy Apostles are {{preserved}} in writing in the Scriptures as well as word of mouth and are handed on. This perpetual handing-on of the Tradition is called a living Tradition; it is the faithful and constant transmission of {{the teachings of the}} Apostles {{from one generation to the}} next. This [...] "includes everything which contributes towards the sanctity of life and increase in faith of the People of God; and so the Church, in her teaching, life and worship Creeds, the Sacraments, the Magisterium, and the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass, perpetuates and hands on to all generations all that she herself is, all that she believes." [...] The Deposit of Faith (fidei <b>depositum)</b> refers to the entirety of Divine revelation. And there is, according to Roman Catholic theology, two sources of Revelation which constitute a single Deposit of Faith, meaning that the entirety of Divine Revelation and the Deposit of Faith is transmitted to successive generations in Sacred Scripture and Sacred Tradition (through the teaching authority and interpretation of the Magisterium).|$|E
40|$|The study {{deals with}} Huerta de Soto’s thesis about the “mistaken {{doctrine}} of common law”, {{which is based}} on the equalization of <b>depositum</b> irregulare and mutuum contracts. He concluded that equalization of these contracts resulted in the creation of business cycles. According to this study, Huerta de Soto made a mistake when considering contracts inspired by the continental law based on Roman law. The study shows that mutuum was even in Roman law an ancient contract that was not codified, and that Huerta de Soto’s interpretation of this contract in the Anglo-American legal system is based more on civil law, not on common law as he stated in his work. Finally, the problem of common law did not lie in the equalization of the mentioned contracts, but rather in the absence of <b>depositum</b> irregulare contracts applied to monetary questions...|$|E

40|$|It {{is not a}} rare {{phenomenon}} in present day theology that some opinions are presented as the teaching of faith. Sometimes they reach such dimensions {{that we can find}} them in many theological manuals {{with the exception of the}} main works such as the documents of the Magisterium. The cause of these phenomena is the fact that the secondary source of theological science, which is the mind, is given greater relevance than the primary sources, which are the Holy Bible, Tradition and Magisterium. Furthermore, these documents are not studied and unknown although they are decisive for the knowledge of the content of faith. In reference to the documents of the Second Vatican Council, the words of Pope Paul VI are apropos: “Absurd situations are maintained by the fact that they are fed by the carelessness of many post-Council interpretations. ” Pope Benedict XVI, when still a Cardinal, said: “Today it is especially relevant to go back to the documents of the Council. It was not the intention of Pope John XXIII and Paul VI to put <b>depositum</b> fidei up for discussion. <b>Depositum</b> fidei was for both untouchable and not a matter of discussion“. The Council’s intention was not to modify faith but to introduce it in a new, more effective form. If the Popes and Council fathers came to the conclusion that they could open themselves with trust to everything new that was positive in the modern world, they did so only because they were aware of their identity and their faith...|$|E

We shall first look at the context in which Plato situates this idea, then go on to examine the occasions on which Aquinas draws on it: in the Summa, when discussing the question as to whether the natural law is the same for everyone; in his Commentary on the Nicomachean Ethics, when he explains in what sense natural law may change, and in what sense it remains the same; and finally, where he examines the virtues of gnome and epieikeia, also in the Summa...|$|E
40|$|Mensarius {{is one of}} {{the terms}} {{describing}} Roman bankers. It is the Latin equivalent of the Greek trapezites – the term first used to describe persons making bank operations. This term was used by Titus Livius and from Ab urbe condita we can take important information about bankers. We find quinqueviri mensarii and triumviri mensarii. The first of them were appointed as a committee in 352 B. C., and according to plebiscitium de quinqueviris mensariis creandis. Quinqueviri mensarii were supposed {{to solve the problem of}} Roman citizens’ debts, arising from loans – nexum. They acted as as public banks. The results of the works of this committee were outstanding – they helped citizens and did not cause any loss for the treasury. It so happened, because they used public funds to cover the debts only when the debtors could give a sufficient guarantee. The rest of the debtors had to transfer their goods, which were then evaluated and sold. Triumviri mensarii were appointed as three independent clerks, having wide competences, to stop the crisis doming from the lack of money in circulation (propter penuriam argenti). They were appointed by lex Minucia de triumviris mensariis, from 216 B. C. The committee had probably the same competence as this from 352 B. C. However triumviri mensariis, contrary to the previous committee, were not appointed ad hoc, but they have operated as an office until 210 B. C. Their competence was wide. They registered citizens’ debts and were making payments. They were collecting money as <b>depositum</b> irregulare. Triumviri mensariis were clerks acting as state officials. You can claim that both described categories of Roman officials were acting as a sui generis public bank. niczyporukpiotr@wp. plUniwersytet w Białymstok...|$|E
