40|$|The {{potential}} of dielectric heating with microwaves at 2450 MHz <b>for</b> <b>drying</b> <b>grapes</b> into raisins was studied. Feasibility studies {{in a conventional}} microwave oven were successful. A new microwave drying system equipped with specialized instrumentation and data acquisition components and permitting full control of microwave power levels and duration of application was then developed and used for detailed experimental work. It was found that when the grapes were dipped in surfactants, as is common practice in the raisin industry, microwave drying was not only faster than convective drying but also had a much lower specific energy requirement. However, it was also possible to obtain raisins of adequate quality without dippings. Good quality light coloured raisins were obtained without sulphur dioxide fumigation. Thus, microwave drying has potential in reducing both the quantity of chemicals entering {{at this point in}} the food chain and the energy consumed for food preservation. The shrinkage and density of grapes were found to be linearly related to moisture content; initial size and method of drying had no influence. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R

There {{has been a}} remarkable achievement in solar <b>drying</b> of <b>grapes</b> due to sustained research and development associated with the adoption of advanced technologies. Simulation is an important tool for design and operation control. For the designer of a drying system, simulation {{makes it possible to}} find the optimum design and operating parameters. For the designer of the control system, simulation provides a means to device control strategies and to analyze the effects of disturbances. In the present thesis the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tool has been used to simulate the solar collector for better understanding the heat transfer capability. 3 D model of the collector involving air inlet, wavy structured absorber plate,glass cover plate, and pebble block is modeled by ANSYS Workbench and the unstructured grid was created in ANSYS ICEM. The results were obtained by using ANSYS FLUENT software. The objective of this work is to compare theoretically and experimentally work done with the work done by using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tool with respect to flow and temperature distribution inside the solar collector.

Drying was carried out under sun and also at 45, 55 and 65 °C in heat pump dryer. The initial moisture content of 456. 54 per (db) {{has been reduced to}} a final moisture content of 18 per cent (db). The time taken <b>for</b> <b>drying</b> varies with respect to different treatment and drying temperature. Drying at 45, 55 and 65 °C took 32, 27 and 21 hours for Ethyl oleate plus K 2 CO 3   pretreatment. The highest drying rate observed in heat pump dryer was 1. 549 kg/kg min. at 65 °C. The initial drying rate was found to be higher in case of heat pump dryer. The energy requirement <b>for</b> <b>drying</b> of <b>grapes</b> in heat pump dryer was found to be 35 per cent less than that of cabinet dryer. The efficiency of the evaporator and condenser coils was found to be 68 and 60 per cent respectively.

40|$|ABSTRACT The aim of {{this study}} was to obtain the {{equilibrium}} moisture content of grape (variety &# 8216;Tannat&# 8217;) pomace through desorption isotherms, to evaluate the drying kinetics, determine the coefficient of effective diffusivity and physico-chemically characterize the grape pomace and the product obtained after drying. The desorption isotherms were determined at 50, 60 and 70 ºC and the experimental data were fitted using the GAB model (Gugghenheim, Anderson and de Boer). Drying was evaluated using a 22 factorial experimental design with three center points and effective diffusivity was obtained through the diffusion model of Fick&# 8217;s second law. The grape pomace was characterized regarding the contents of moisture, protein, carbohydrates, lipids, ash and dietary crude fiber. The obtained isotherms showed sigmoid shape and the experimental data fitted well to the GAB model. The drying curves showed only a decreasing rate period. The effective diffusivity values were within the range <b>for</b> organic materials. <b>Dry</b> <b>grape</b> pomace showed high contents of protein and fiber and can be used in the development of new products, in order to increase the nutritional content and add value to this byproduct...|$|R
40|$|Several {{human skin}} {{diseases}} {{are associated with}} fungi as dermatophytes and Malassezia. Skin mycoses are increasing and new alternatives to conventional treatments with improved efficacy and/or safety profiles are desirable. For the first time, the anti-dermatophytes and the anti-Malassezia activities of Vitis vinifera seed extracts obtained from different table and wine cultivars have been evaluated. Geometric minimal inhibitory concentration ranged from 20 to 97 [*]µg/mL for dermatophytes and from 32 to 161 [*]µg/mL <b>for</b> Malassezia furfur. <b>Dried</b> <b>grape</b> seed extracts analyzed by HPLC/DAD/ESI/MS showed different quali-quantitative compositions in terms of monomeric and polymeric flavan- 3 -ols. The minimal inhibitory concentrations for Trichophyton mentagrophytes and for M. [*]furfur were inversely correlated {{with the amount of}} the polymeric fraction (r[*]=[*]- 0. 7639 and r[*]=[*]- 0. 7228, respectively). Differently, the antifungal activity against T. [*]mentagrophytes was not correlated to the content of flavan- 3 -ol monomers (r[*]=[*] 0. 2920) and only weakly correlated for M. [*]furfur (r[*]=[*]- 0. 53604). These results suggest that extracts rich in polymeric flavan- 3 -ols, recovered from V. [*] vinifera seeds, could be used for the treatment of skin fungal infections.

Its removal has been so far carried out by using several chemical pre-treatments. However, they cause heterogeneity in the waxes removal and create microscopic cracks. In this paper an abrasive pretreatment <b>for</b> enhancing the <b>drying</b> rate and preserving the grape samples is proposed. Two cultivars of grape were investigated: Regina white grape and Red Globe red <b>grape.</b> The <b>drying</b> kinetics of untreated and treated samples were studied using a convective oven at 50 ˚C.

40|$|During {{alcoholic}} {{fermentation of must}} from <b>dried</b> <b>grapes,</b> yeasts are subjected to very high sugar concentrations, besides other environmental stresses, and they modify their metabolic behaviour giving low ethanol yield and abnormally high acetic acid production.

A significant (p< 0. 01 or p< 0. 05) relationship between the addition of 100 mg/L of catechin, inositol or SO 2 to the grape must and the change in the metabolic behaviour of the yeasts was observed. Compared to the control and depending on strain and protectant, the fermentation rate after 3 days in-creased up to 55 %, the ethanol content of the wines increased up to 16 %, the unitary suc-cinic acid production increased up to 55 %, the unitary acetic acid production decreased up to 53 %, and the unitary glycerol production decreased up to 69 %.
