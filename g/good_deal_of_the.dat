5|$|Princess Ida (1884) spoofed women's {{education}} and male chauvinism and continued {{the theme from}} Iolanthe of the war between the sexes. The opera is based on Tennyson's poem The Princess: A Medley. Gilbert had written a blank verse farce {{based on the same}} material in 1870, called The Princess, and he reused a <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dialogue from his earlier play in the libretto of Princess Ida. Ida is the only Gilbert and Sullivan work with dialogue entirely in blank verse and is also the only one of their works in three acts. Lillian Russell had been engaged to create the title role, but Gilbert did not believe that she was dedicated enough, and when she missed a rehearsal, he dismissed her.|$|E
5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{attempts}} to make everyone's Christmas wishes come true. At a conference meeting, he vows to keep his promise to make wishes and asks the office members to also be nice to his new girlfriend Jessica (Eleanor Seigler). An emotionally confused Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) tries {{to be nice to}} Jessica, but ends up drinking too much at the party. In a drunken stupor, she tells Andy that her Christmas wish is for Jessica to die. Offended, he tells her to get over their breakup before storming off. Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) does her part as a friend of Erin's by being mean to Jessica. Andy becomes concerned about Erin's behavior, not least because Robert California (James Spader) has revealed that his marriage is ending, spends a <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> party hanging out with Erin and pressures her into drinking shots. When Andy has to drive a drunken Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) home, he sees Erin getting into Robert's car and he follows them with a look of panic on his face. However, he covertly witnesses Robert being a gentleman and sending Erin off to her apartment with a hug and words of encouragement. Andy subsequently drives away with a smile on his face.|$|E

25|$|On 6 May 1791, a tearful {{confrontation}} on {{the floor}} of the Commons (officially, and rather irrelevantly, during a debate on the particulars of a bill for the government of Canada) finally shattered the quarter-century friendship of Fox and Burke, as the latter dramatically crossed the floor of the House to sit down next to Pitt, taking the support of a <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> more conservative Whigs with him. Later, on his deathbed in 1797, Burke would have his wife turn Fox away rather than allow a final reconciliation.|$|E
25|$|Included in {{his design}} was a frieze sculpted by Caspar Buberl. Because a {{sculpture}} {{of that size}} was well out of Meigs's budget, he had Buberl create 28 different scenes, totaling 69 feet (21 m) in length, which were then mixed and slightly modified to create the continuous 1,200-foot (365-m) parade of over 1,300 figures. Because of the 28 sections' modification and mixture, {{it is only in}} careful examination that the frieze is seen to be the same figures repeated several times. The sculpture includes infantry, navy, artillery, cavalry, and medical components, as well as a <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> supply and quartermaster functions, for it was in that capacity that Meigs had served during the Civil War.|$|E

25|$|The {{privatization}} programme {{was launched}} on 22 January 1991 by Prime minister Nawaz Sharif in a vision to promote free-market economic principles, private-ownership and the mainstream goal to attract {{foreign investment in}} the country. But, as a result a <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> national wealth fell {{into the hands of}} a relatively small group of so-called business oligarchs (tycoons), and the wealth gap increased dramatically in the 1990s that halted the programme by Benazir Bhutto. Revisions were made in 1999, and finally launched the much more intensified privatization programme under the watchful presiding leadership of Prime minister Shaukat Aziz in 2004. Finally, the programme was ended effectively at the end of 2007 when ~80%–90% of the industries were put under the management of private ownership of enterprises by Prime minister Shaukat Aziz.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Kinsale in 1601 saw {{the defeat}} of Hugh O'Neill, despite his {{alliance}} with the Spanish, and the ultimate victory in the Elizabethan conquest of Ireland came with his surrender to crown authority in 1603. In consequence, the system of education and patronage that underpinned the professional bardic schools came under pressure, and the hereditary poets eventually engaged in a spat - the Contention of the bards - that {{marked the end of}} their ancient influence. During the early 17th century a new Gaelic poetry took root, one that sought inspiration in the margins of a dispossessed Irish-speaking society. The language of this poetry is today called Early Modern Irish. Although some 17th-century poets continued to enjoy a degree of patronage, many, if not most, of them were part-time writers who also worked on the land, as teachers, and anywhere that they could earn their keep. Their poetry also changed, with a move away from the syllabic verse of the schools to accentual metres, reflecting the oral poetry of the bardic period. A <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poetry of this period deals with political and historical themes that reflect the poets' sense of a world lost.|$|E

25|$|Some {{argue that}} almost all of the above is based on an unhistorical {{projection}} of present concerns, onto the past. This alternative view argues that there are immense complexities of time, space, climate, geology and topography which, when combined with our extremely fragmentary information, makes generalizations almost impossible. Tree crops, dates, figs, olives, chestnuts etc, played a very important role in Roman agriculture. Grains were often intercultivated with these tree crops. Almost all species of trees grow again when cut down. Cutting down a wood does not, by itself, destroy woodland. Coppicing is one way in which wood could be harvested on a sustainable basis for example. Hypocausts were pre-adapted to burn poor quality fuels like straw as well as coal. There is good reason to believe that both straw and coal were important fuels in antiquity, especially in Roman Britain where coal was abundant in many areas. A great deal of protection against soil erosion arises from terracing hillsides. We do not know how extensive terraces were in antiquity but a <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soil erosion, here assumed to be caused by the Romans, may well date to the dark ages when the maintenance of terraces broke down. Changes in tree cover may well arise from differences in climate, which are still not well understood. But {{there is some evidence that}} the decline of the Roman West is linked to climate change.|$|E
25|$|He {{sided with}} the {{parliament}} in consequence of the assurances conveyed in the 'propositions and orders' of both houses on 10 June 1642, viz. that any subsidies received by the parliament should be employed only in maintaining 'the Protestant religion, the king's authority, his person in his royal dignity, the free course of justice, {{the laws of the}} land, the peace of the kingdom, and the privileges of parliament, against any force which shall oppose them'. For a short time he was (according to Wood) chaplain to Essex's regiment of horse. Subsequent proceedings, {{at a time when the}} parliament was overridden by the army, he openly declared to be subversive of the fundamental constitution of the kingdom. Burges's name stands thirty-second on the list of Westminster Assembly divines appointed by the ordinance of 12 June 1643. Twisse was named in the ordinance as prolocutor. On 8 July the assembly appointed Burges one of the two assessors or vice-presidents, and as Twisse was in feeble health, and John White, the other assessor, had fits of gout, on Burges, 'a very active and sharpe man' (as Baillie calls him), fell a <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> duty of keeping the assembly in order, at least until the appointment of Charles Herle to succeed Twisse, who died 19 July 1646. Burges was also convener of one of the three committees into which the assembly divided itself at the beginning of its work. His liturgical knowledge (he had a fine collection of the various issues of the common prayer-book) may be traced, Alexander Ferrier Mitchell thinks, in the composition of the 'Directory'.|$|E

500|$|Little {{is known}} of this period of Alkan's life, other than that apart from {{composing}} he was immersed {{in the study of}} the Bible and the Talmud. Throughout this period Alkan continued his correspondence with Ferdinand Hiller, whom he had probably met in Paris in the 1830s, and with Masarnau, from which some insights can be gained. It appears that Alkan completed a full translation into French, now lost, of both the Old Testament and the New Testament, from their original languages. In 1865, he wrote to Hiller: [...] "Having translated a <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Apocrypha, I'm now onto the second Gospel which I am translating from the Syriac... In starting to translate the New Testament, I was suddenly struck by a singular idea– that you have to be Jewish to be able to do it." ...|$|E

It was an inevitable development for Malayalam cinema, as the film focused mainly on cinema rather than its story. The film also introduced film-goers to a new cinematic art through the impulses generated by the film, which in turn were more important than the film itself.

500|$|A direct {{reaction}} to prog {{came in the}} form of the punk movement, which rejected classical traditions, virtuosity, and textural complexity. Post-punk, which author Doyle Green characterizes [...] "as a kind of progressive punk", was played by bands like Talking Heads, Pere Ubu, Public Image Ltd, and Joy Division. It differs from punk rock by balancing punk's energy and skepticism with a re-engagement with an art school consciousness, Dadaist experimentalism, and atmospheric, ambient soundscapes. It was also majorly influenced from world music, especially African and Asian traditions. In the same period, new wave music was more sophisticated in production terms than some contemporaneous progressive music, but was largely perceived as simplistic, and thus had little overt appeal to art music or art-music practice. Musicologist Bill Martin writes; [...] "the [...] Heads created a kind of new-wave music that was the perfect synthesis of punk urgency and attitude and progressive-rock sophistication and creativity. A <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> more interesting rock since that time is clearly 'post-Talking Heads' music, but this means that it is post-progressive rock as well." ...|$|E
500|$|The term [...] "post-progressive" [...] {{identifies}} progressive {{rock that}} returns {{to its original}} principles while dissociating from established 1970s prog styles, and may be located after 1978. Martin credits Roxy Music's Brian Eno as the music's most important catalyst, explaining that his 1973–77 output merged aspects of progressive rock with a prescient notion of punk and new wave. New wave, which surfaced around 1978–79 {{with some of the}} same attitudes and aesthetic as punk, was characterised by Martin as [...] "progressive" [...] multiplied by [...] "punk". Bands in the genre tended to be less hostile towards progressive rock than the punks, and there were crossovers, such as Fripp and Eno's involvement with Talking Heads, and Yes' replacement of Rick Wakeman and Jon Anderson with the pop duo the Buggles. When King Crimson reformed in 1981, they released an album, Discipline, which Macan says [...] "inaugurated" [...] the new post-progressive style. According to Martin, Talking Heads also created [...] "a kind of new-wave music that was the perfect synthesis of punk urgency and attitude and progressive-rock sophistication and creativity. A <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> more interesting rock since that time is clearly 'post-Talking Heads' music, but this means that it is post-progressive rock as well." ...|$|E
500|$|Mary Shelley {{had called}} the baby Allegra [...] "the little Commodore" [...] because of her sturdy body and alert, {{intelligent}} look. Byron was also pleased with Allegra's resemblances to himself in appearance and temperament. When she was eighteen months old, {{he wrote in a}} letter to a friend: [...] "My bastard came three days ago—very like—healthy—noisy & capricious." [...] In an 1818 letter to his half-sister Augusta Leigh, Byron wrote that [...] "She is very pretty—remarkably intelligent ... She has very blue eyes—that singular forehead—fair curly hair—and a devil of a spirit—but that is Papa's." [...] In 1819, in another letter to Leigh, Byron described two and a half-year-old Allegra as [...] "very droll" [...] and again commented on her resemblance to himself in physical appearance, temperament and interests: [...] "(She) has a very <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Byron. Can't articulate the letter 'r' at all—frowns and pouts quite in our way—blue eyes—light hair growing darker daily—and a dimple in the chin—a scowl on the brow—white skin—sweet voice—and a particular liking of Music—and of her own way in every thing—is that not B. all over?" [...] The child had forgotten any English she had learned and now spoke only Venetian Italian. In March 1820, he complained in a letter that three-year-old Allegra was vain and [...] "obstinate as a mule". Her behaviour was sometimes unmanageable, probably as a result of her unstable living arrangements and frequent changes in caregivers. [...] At age four, the naughty child terrorised Byron's servants with her temper tantrums and other misbehavior and told frequent lies.|$|E
