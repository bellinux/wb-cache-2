5|$|After its {{perihelion}} passage, {{the comet}} moved into dark skies, {{and although it}} <b>faded</b> <b>as</b> it receded from the Sun it remained {{one of the most}} prominent objects in the sky. On 30 September, observers, including Finlay and E. E. Barnard, began to notice that the comet's nucleus was elongated and broken into two pronounced bright balls of light, and by 17 October it was clear that it had broken into at least five fragments. Observers reported that the relative brightness of the fragments varied from day to day.|$|E
5|$|During the summer, with United only losing three matches, {{and either}} winning or drawing their other league fixtures, the club ascended {{in the standings}} and eventually, into a {{position}} that offered a berth into the wildcard round of the playoffs. United held a spot within the league's top ten overall standings throughout July and August. By September, the luck <b>faded</b> <b>as</b> the club ran into {{a bit of a}} slump.|$|E

5|$|For a while, the calutrons {{suffered}} {{from a series of}} debilitating breakdowns and equipment failures, exacerbated by a shortage of spare parts. Hopes that the Alpha II racetracks would be more reliable soon <b>faded,</b> <b>as</b> they were plagued by insulator failures. These problems were gradually overcome. The first shipments of enriched uranium to the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory were made in March 1944, consisting of Alpha product enriched to 13 to 15 percent uranium-235. While of no use in a bomb, it was urgently required for experiments with enriched uranium. The last shipment of Alpha product was made on 11 May 1944. On 7 June 1944, Y-12 made its first delivery of weapons-grade Beta product, enriched to as high as 89% uranium-235.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{took his}} fifth win {{of the season}} when he crossed {{the line at the}} end of the 56th lap, almost 15seconds ahead of the second-placed Massa. Räikkönen took third ahead of Alonso. Heidfeld managed to jump from ninth on the grid to finish in fifth place, just ahead of his {{teammate}} Kubica, who climbed from eleventh on the grid. A one-stop pit strategy worked well for Glock as he finished seventh; Piquet took eighth. Vettel, Coulthard, Barrichello and Nakajima took the next four places; Bourdais recovered from his early contact with Trulli to take 13th. Webber's initial success with a two-stop strategy <b>faded</b> <b>as</b> he finished 14th. Rosberg took 15th, ahead of Button and Fisichella. Trulli, Sutil and Kovalainen were the three retirements from the 56lap race.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, {{former vice}} {{president}} and presidential candidate Walter Mondale, seen as an underdog, selected Ferraro to be his running mate in the upcoming election. Ferraro became the only Italian American to be a major-party national nominee {{in addition to being}} the first woman. The positive polling the Mondale-Ferraro ticket received when she joined soon <b>faded,</b> <b>as</b> damaging questions arose about her and her businessman husband's finances and wealth and her Congressional disclosure statements. In the general election, Mondale and Ferraro were defeated in a landslide by incumbent President Ronald Reagan and Vice President George H. W. Bush.|$|E

5|$|By March 1854, Britain and Russia were {{embroiled in}} the Crimean War. Albert devised a master-plan {{for winning the}} war by laying siege to Sevastopol while {{starving}} Russia economically, which became the Allied strategy after the Tsar decided to fight a purely defensive war. Early British optimism soon <b>faded</b> <b>as</b> the press reported that British troops were ill-equipped and mismanaged by aged generals using out-of-date tactics and strategy. The conflict dragged on as the Russians were as poorly prepared as their opponents. The Prime Minister, Lord Aberdeen, resigned and Palmerston succeeded him. A negotiated settlement eventually {{put an end to}} the war with the Treaty of Paris. During the war, Albert arranged to marry his fourteen-year-old daughter, Victoria, to Prince Frederick William of Prussia, though Albert delayed the marriage until Victoria was seventeen. Albert hoped that his daughter and son-in-law would be a liberalising influence in the enlarging but very conservative Prussian state.|$|E
5|$|In late 1832, the Democratic Party {{convention}} nominated Pierce {{for one of}} New Hampshire's five {{seats in}} the U.S. House of Representatives. This was tantamount to election for the young Democrat, as the National Republicans had <b>faded</b> <b>as</b> a political force, while the Whigs had not yet begun to attract a large following. Democratic strength in New Hampshire was also bolstered by Jackson's landslide re-election that year. New Hampshire had been a marginal state politically, but from 1832 through the mid-1850s became the most reliably Democratic state in the North, boosting Pierce's political career. Pierce's term began in March 1833, {{but he would not}} be sworn in until Congress met in December, and his attention was elsewhere. He had recently become engaged and bought his first house in Hillsborough. Franklin and Benjamin Pierce were among the prominent citizens who welcomed President Jackson to the state on his visit in mid-1833.|$|E
5|$|Though rivals, Morrison and The Miz {{faced the}} {{dysfunctional}} tag team of Matt Hardy and Montel Vontavious Porter on the November 16 episode of SmackDown! for the WWE Tag Team Championship in a winning effort, marking Morrison's fourth WWE Tag Team Championship. At Survivor Series, Morrison and The Miz were both defeated by CM Punk in a triple threat {{match for the}} ECW Championship. After the defeat, the rivalry aspect of Miz and Morrison's relationship <b>faded,</b> <b>as</b> they were now portrayed as trusting friends. In February 2008, Morrison and The Miz were given a streaming segment on WWE.com named The Dirt Sheet in which they mocked other wrestlers and facets of pop culture. Morrison and The Miz co-wrote each episode of The Dirt Sheet each week, and he credits his time in college studying film with contributing {{to the success of}} the show. On July 4 episode of Smackdown, Morrison lost to Jeff Hardy who re-debuted on Smackdown after the 2008 WWE Draft. The team had many successful title defenses over the next few months, before dropping the titles to Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder at The Great American Bash in a fatal four-way match which also featured Jesse and Festus and Finlay and Hornswoggle. Neither The Miz nor Morrison were pinned, as Hawkins pinned Jesse to win the titles.|$|E

5|$|When Thorpe {{broke the}} 200m {{freestyle}} Olympic {{record in the}} heats the following morning, his main rival Pieter van den Hoogenband of the Netherlands (with World No. 2 ranked and teammate Michael Kim bypassing the 200 metres) conceded defeat. However, van den Hoogenband showed {{his hand in the}} semi-finals by cutting more than a second off his personal best, to set a new world record of 1min 45.35s. Thorpe qualified second with a personal best of his own, 0.02s slower, and was under immense pressure to win the final the following day after his double gold on the first night. Van den Hoogenband started quickly and Thorpe chased him, reaching the 100m mark just 0.04s behind. Both swimmers turned at 150m in identical times. As a result of starting harder than usual, Thorpe <b>faded</b> <b>as</b> van den Hoogenband drew away to claim gold and equal his world record, stunning the home crowd. Thorpe touched in 1min 45.83s, {{the first time that he}} had swum slower in the final than in the qualifying rounds. Thorpe though would never again lose to Van Den Hoogenband in a long course 200 metres race again. Thorpe returned to victory when he led off the 4×200m freestyle relay the following night, setting up a 10m lead over American Scott Goldblatt in the first leg. Although Thorpe was unable to reclaim the individual world record, he, Klim, Kirby and Todd Pearson lowered their world record to 7min 07.05s, over five seconds ahead of the Americans—the largest winning margin in an Olympic relay for half a century. Thorpe rounded off his Olympics by swimming in the heats of the 4×100m medley relay, and collected a silver medal when the finals quartet finished behind the Americans. Thorpe's performances as Australia's leading medalist for the Games were recognised when the Australian Olympic Committee granted him the honour of carrying the flag at the closing ceremony. With three gold and two silver medals, Thorpe was the most successful athlete at the 2000 Olympic Games. At year's end, he was again named by Swimming Australia as the Swimmer of the Year, but van den Hoogenband usurped him as the leading male swimmer chosen by Swimming World Magazine.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the first}} season of Sports Night is a sitcom, it often is portrayed {{as more of a}} comedy-drama {{representative}} of some of Sorkin's later work on The West Wing. Sorkin intended for the series' humor to be drier and more realistic than typical sitcoms. He initially wanted the show to be recorded without a laugh track, but ABC network executives insisted on including one. The volume of the laugh track <b>faded</b> <b>as</b> Season One continued and was abandoned at the beginning of Season Two.|$|E

25|$|The {{traditional}} constraints {{gave way}} to more liberal conditions for women.

Society emphasized the role of mothers in child rearing, especially the patriotic goal of raising republican children rather than those locked into aristocratic value systems. There was more permissiveness in child-rearing. Patriot women married to Loyalists who left the state could get a divorce and obtain control of the ex-husband's property.|$|E
