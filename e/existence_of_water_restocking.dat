40|$|An {{anodized}} TiO 2 sensor {{equipped with}} a Pd-Pt electrode was subjected to heat treatment in air (air-treated) and additionally in N 2 (N 2 -treated), and then its responses to H 2 balanced with air or N 2 were investigated under dry and wet conditions. Among the conditions tested, the N 2 -treated sensor showed the largest H 2 response in dry N 2 atmosphere. But, H 2 response of the air-treated sensor increased with the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> vapor, while that of the N 2 -treated sensor decreased with the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> vapor.

30|$|The Nankai Trough is {{an active}} {{convergent}} region in southwest Japan and mega-thrust earthquakes have repeatedly occurred {{in some areas of}} its plate-boundary interface. Generation of mega-thrust earthquakes is inferred {{to be related to the}} <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> The resistivity structure is very sensitive to the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> For that reason, it is important to obtain the resistivity image around the rupture area of mega-thrust earthquakes. We carried out land and marine magnetotelluric surveys in the Kii Peninsula and the offshore Kii Peninsula where the 1944 Tonankai earthquake occurred. We constructed a 2 D resistivity model using an inversion technique. The modeled resistivity structure portrayed the Philippine Sea Plate as a resistive region. However, its resistivity becomes more conductive as the plate subducts, showing 10 Ω-m around the down-dip limit. These characteristics are considered to relate to the water. Therefore, we infer that water might control the generation of mega-thrust earthquakes.|$|R

30|$|Nano/micro-manufacturing under wet {{condition}} {{is an important}} consideration for various tool-based processes such as indentation, scratching, and machining. The <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> liquids adds complexity to the system, changes the tool/work interfacial condition, and affects material behaviors. For indentation, it may also affect material property measurements. However, little effort {{has been made to}} study this challenging issue at nano- or atomistic scale. In this study, we tackle this challenge by investigating nano-indentation processes submerged in water using the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation approach. Compared with dry indentation in which no water molecules are present, the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> molecules causes the increase of indentation force in initial penetration, but the decrease of indentation force in full penetration. It also reduces the sticking phenomenon between the work and tool atoms during indenter retraction, such that the indentation geometry can be better retained. Meanwhile, nano-indentation under {{wet condition}} exhibits the indentation size effect, while dry nano-indentation exhibits the reverse indentation size effect. The <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> leads to higher computed hardness values at low indentation loads and a smaller value of Young's modulus. In addition, the friction along the tool/work interface is significantly reduced under wet indentation.|$|R
