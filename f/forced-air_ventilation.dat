[...] On All-Electric cars the dynamics were effective to 0.75-mph where the lockout relay then allowed a spring applied friction brake to engage a drum on each of the four motor drive shafts; this completed the stop and held the car in park. [...] Drum brakes were released by an electric solenoid operating from low-voltage battery power; a power failure would prevent the drums from releasing which would prevent power application, a fail-safe feature. Drum brakes were quite popular and greatly reduced maintenance thus some [...] "Air" [...] cars were retrofitted with drums.

5000|$|The {{acquisition}} {{marked the}} introduction of the first air-conditioned trains to the line. Earlier LRT Line 1 rolling stock was notorious for its lack of air conditioning, relying instead on <b>forced-air</b> roof <b>ventilation</b> for cooling. Unfortunately, this resulted in hot and stuffy rides. The problem was addressed more fully after a preparatory rehabilitation program completed in 2001 allowed the installation of air conditioners to the older rolling stock. [...] By June 2004, all Yellow Line trains had air conditioning.|$|R
5000|$|In 2006, IQAir {{introduced}} its first air cleaning system {{to work in}} conjunction with ducted <b>forced-air</b> heating, <b>ventilation</b> and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. The Perfect 16 derives its name from being the first independently tested residential and commercial air cleaning system for HVAC systems to achieve the highest minimum efficiency reporting value (MERV 16) under the ASHRAE 52.2 test format. [...] Other characteristics of the system include very low pressure drop and a filter life of up to 3 years.|$|R

40|$|Model {{predictive}} control (MPC) strategies show {{great potential for}} improving the performance and energy efficiency of building heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems. A challenge in the deployment of such predictive thermostatic control systems {{is the need to}} learn accurate models for the thermal characteristics of individual buildings. This necessitates the development of online and data-driven methods for system identification. In this paper, we propose a piecewise linear thermal model of a building. To learn the model, we present a Kalman filter based approach for estimating the parameters. Finally, we fit the piecewise linear model to data collected from a residential building with a <b>forced-air</b> heating and <b>ventilation</b> system and validate the accuracy of the trained model...|$|R
40|$|This report evaluates {{residential}} {{ventilation systems}} for the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) ENERGY STAR{reg_sign} Homes program and recommends mechanical ventilation strategies for new, low-infiltration, energy-efficient, single-family, ENERGY STAR production (site-built tract) homes in four climates: cold, mixed (cold and hot), hot humid, and hot arid. Our group in the Energy Analysis Department at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab compared residential ventilation strategies in four climates according to three criteria: total annualized costs (the sum of annualized capital cost and annual operating cost), predominant indoor pressure induced by the ventilation system, and distribution of ventilation air within the home. The mechanical ventilation systems modeled deliver 0. 35 {{air changes per hour}} continuously, regardless of actual infiltration or occupant window-opening behavior. Based on the assumptions and analysis described in this report, we recommend independently ducted multi-port supply ventilation in all climates except cold because this strategy provides the safety and health benefits of positive indoor pressure as well as the ability to dehumidify and filter ventilation air. In cold climates, we recommend that multi-port supply ventilation be balanced by a single-port exhaust ventilation fan, and that builders offer balanced heat-recovery ventilation to buyers as an optional upgrade. For builders who continue to install <b>forced-air</b> integrated supply <b>ventilation,</b> we recommend ensuring ducts are airtight or in conditioned space, installing a control that automatically operates the forced-air fan 15 - 20 minutes during each hour that the fan does not operate for heating or cooling, and offering ICM forced-air fans to home buyers as an upgrade...|$|R
50|$|The maximum {{design speed}} limit is 80 km/h (average speed 35.5 km/h) for rubber-tyred rolling stock and 100 km/h (average speed 42.5 km/h) for steel-wheeled rolling stock. Unlike the rolling stock of other metro systems in the world, the trains do not utilise air-conditioning; instead <b>forced-air</b> <b>ventilation</b> is {{employed}} in all trains and the top portion of windows can be opened so that passenger comfort is ensured by {{the combination of these}} two types of ventilation. Like the rolling stock used in the Paris Métro, the numbering of the Mexico City Metro's rolling stock are specified by year of design (not year of first use).|$|E
50|$|Following this, {{the next}} order, {{numbered}} from C3551 and T4217, were also fitted with <b>forced-air</b> <b>ventilation,</b> {{and were the}} first to be fitted with air-conditioning.The first 100 cars had their upper deck windows at the unpopular lower height of the earlier Goninan cars, the final 60 were modified and these final 60 were distinguished by their front end being painted into the 'candy' white, orange and red State Rail livery of the time. The final batch (C3551-3580 & T4217-4246) also featured bright yellow internal walls. The forced ventilation cars were later retrofitted with air-conditioning, and the Beclawat sliding windows replaced by fixed panes in the late 1990s. Also at this time, the standard light grey internal livery was adopted, and the seats were replaced with blue upholstery. 160 of these cars were delivered until 1985, and continue to operate in 2011 as K sets.|$|E
5000|$|The Stampede Pass {{railroad}} tunnel is arched in the center; that is, daylight in {{not detectable}} {{at either end}} of the tunnel when looking through to the other end; unlike both the first (2.6 mile, 1900) and second (7.8 mile, 1929) Cascade Tunnels of the Great Northern Railway at Stevens Pass, which were [...] "boresighted" [...] and ran in a straight line and at a constant downward angle from northeast to southwest. Steam engines ascending in either direction within the confines of the Stampede Tunnel was the cause of many train crews and passengers being nearly choked to death by the buildup of exhaust gasses within the tunnel; this led to a <b>forced-air</b> <b>ventilation</b> equipment being added at the west end of the tunnel at a later date.

5000|$|In April 1904, the {{prominent}} New York City architectural firm of Carrère and Hastings was retained. John Carrère {{took charge of}} the Senate Office Building project, while Thomas Hastings oversaw the construction of an almost identical office building (now named the Cannon House Office Building) for the United States House of Representatives. Their Beaux Arts designs were restrained complements to the Capitol. Architecturally, their elevations are divided into a rusticated base and a colonnade with an entablature and balustrade. The Constitution AV side is a quasi replica of the easternmost façade of the Palais du Louvre in Paris [...] The colonnades, with 34 Doric columns that face the Capitol, are echoed by pilasters {{on the sides of the}} buildings. Both buildings are faced with marble and limestone; the Russell Building's base and terrace are gray granite. Modern for their time, they included such facilities as <b>forced-air</b> <b>ventilation</b> systems, steam heat, individual lavatories with hot and cold running water and ice water, telephones, and electricity. Both are connected to the Capitol by underground passages. Originally there were 98 suites and eight committee rooms in the Russell Building; the First Street Wing, completed in 1933, added two committee rooms and 28 suites.|$|E

40|$|In {{the current}} soil drying {{protocol}} of the 0. 01 M calcium chloride (CaCl 2) procedure, soils are oven dried at 40 °C for 24 h. At this drying temperature, {{as well as}} at lower drying temperatures, a change of the actual soil nutrient element status cannot be excluded because microbes will be active during part of the drying period. However, a higher drying temperature may affect soil characteristics and soil processes and also lead to a misinterpretation of the soil nutrient element status. An explanatory study was conducted to get more insight into the effect of i) oven drying temperature and ii) the use of <b>forced-air</b> <b>ventilation</b> at low drying temperatures on nutrient elements extracted with the 0. 01 M CaCl 2 procedure. The goal {{of the study was to}} investigate the perspectives of optimization of the soil drying protocol of the 0. 01 M CaCl 2 procedure. Three moist test soils with different soil characteristics were oven dried at 20 and 40 °C with and without forced air ventilation and at 70 and 105 °C without <b>forced-air</b> <b>ventilation.</b> The moist test soils and the dried soils were extracted with a 0. 01 M CaCl 2 solution and pH and total N (N), ammonium-nitrogen (NH 4 -N), nitrate-nitrogen (NO 3 -N), ortho-phosphate (ortho-P), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na), and manganese (Mn) determined in the supernatant after centrifugation. Soluble organic N (org-N) was calculated as the difference between N and the summation of NH 4 -N and NO 3 -N. In the temperature range from 40 to 105 °C, ortho-P, NH 4 -N, org-N, and Mn extracted tended to increase two or threefold for each 30 – 35 °C increase in drying temperature. Differences in ortho-P, NH 4 -N, org-N, and Mn extracted at 20 and 40 °C were relatively small. The pH, K, Na, and NO 3 -N extracted were affected by drying temperature but the effect was variable. Magnesium extracted was not affected by drying temperature. The use of forced air ventilation at 20 and 40 °C had no significant effect on the amount of org-N, NH 4 -N, ortho-P, K, and Mg extracted. There were significant effects of <b>forced-air</b> <b>ventilation</b> on pH and NO 3 -N, Na, and Mn extracted but the effects were variable. Test values (60 – 70 €of the moist test soils were significantly different from the respective test values of the test soils dried at 20 and 40 °C with and without <b>forced-air</b> <b>ventilation.</b> Based on the differences between moist and dried soils, it is questionable if soil drying should be recommended in the 0. 01 M CaCl 2 procedure. Therefore, further research should focus on the relationship between soil test values of moist and dried soils with crop response. If soil drying is preferable drying temperature should not exceed 40 °C...|$|E

40|$|Local {{emissions}} from poultry production appear to significantly {{contribute to the}} spatial distribution of N and pitch canker disease in managed slash pine ecosystems. Pitch canker disease (Fusarium circinatum Nirenberg & O’Donnell) causes serious shoot dieback, reduced growth and mortality in pines found in the southern and western USA, and {{has been linked to}} nutrient imbalances. Poultry houses with <b>forced-air</b> <b>ventilation</b> systems produce nitrogen (N) emissions. This study analyzed spatial correlations between pitch canker disease and foliar, forest floor, soil, and throughfall N in a slash pine (Pinus elliottii var. elliottii Engelm.) plantation adjacent to a poultry operation in north Florida, USA. Tissue and throughfall N concentrations were highest near the poultry houses and remained elevated for 400 m. Disease incidence ranged from 57 e 71 % near the poultry houses and was spatially correlated with N levels. Similarly, stem mortality ranged from 41 e 53 % in the most heavily impacted area, and declined to 0 e 9 % at distances greater than 400 m. These results suggest that nutritional processes exacerbate changes in disease susceptibility and expression in slash pine...|$|E
40|$|The w e {{history is}} {{presented}} {{of the successful}} installation of an insulated and ventilated foundation pad for a two million gallon (9100 m 3) fuel storage tank in Inuvik, N. W. T. Because the tank is only heated locally in the winter at the fuel pick-up point near the tank bottom, the tank temperature is rela-tively low, ranging from 12 to 39 °F (- 1 1 to 4 ’C), {{with an average of}} 24 °F (- 4. 4 ”C). The foundation design employs no <b>forced-air</b> <b>ventilation</b> system, thus saving the related energy cost for operating such a system. Instead, the winter ventilation is accomplished by a wind draft. During the winter months, the average rate of heat removal through the culverts per unit of tank area is cal-culated to be about 2. 4 Btu/hr. ftZ (7. 6 W/m 2). This rate of heat removal is sufficient to freeze back the foundation pad in the winter and to allow the pad to absorb heat from the tank and the ambient air in the summer. Although the foundation pad undergoes annual freeze-thaw cycles, the lower insula-tion layer dampens the temperature variation in the subsoil and prevents it from thawing. Le present document relate le cas de I’installation d’une dalle de fondation calorifugte et ventilke pour un reservoir de stockage de combustible de 9100 m 3 a Inuvik (T. N. - 0.). Puisque le reservoir n’est chauffe en hiver qu’au point de prise de combustible, pres du fond du reservoir, sa temperature est relativement basse, variant entre- 1 1 et 4 ”C, avec une moyenne de- 4. 4 ”C. La ventilation de la fondation n’est pas assurk par un systtme a air pulse, ce qui permet d’eviter les coats inherents a I’utilisation d’un tel systtme. La ventilation d’hiver est plutdt assurke par le vent. Pendant I’hiver, les conduits permettent d’enlever la chaleur a un t a w moyen d’environ 7. 6 W/m 2 de surface de reservoir. Ce t a w d’enlkement de chaleur est suffisant pour geler la dalle de fondation en hiver et pour lui permettre d’absorber la chaleur du reservoir et de I’air ambiant en ete. Bien que la dalle de fondation subisse les cycles annuels de gel et de dkgel, la couche inferieure d’isolant amortit les variations de temperature dans le sous-sol et I’empEche de degeler.
