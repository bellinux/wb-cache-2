Edgar Martins was described by pioneering video artist Bill Viola as “the most interesting photographer working today”.

The paper marshals evidence and argument from a number of domains – including philosophy, Japanese aesthetics, popular astrophysics – in pursuit of these two questions...|$|R

40|$|The {{subject of}} the master thesis was a <b>fine</b> <b>arts</b> colony for primary school pupils as {{motivation}} for <b>fine</b> <b>arts</b> activity. In general, {{there have been few}} studies and papers on <b>fine</b> <b>arts</b> colonies for primary school pupils. A <b>fine</b> <b>arts</b> colony is organised outside the standard space, classroom, and provides a possibility of a wider and deeper exploration of all <b>fine</b> <b>arts</b> fields and techniques. Each year, educators receive tenders for <b>fine</b> <b>arts</b> colonies, but can apply {{only a limited number of}} pupils. Therefore, our current practice is to only apply pupils gifted in <b>fine</b> <b>arts.</b> We can consequently conclude that there are likely many pupils also gifted in <b>fine</b> <b>arts</b> that do not attend the <b>fine</b> <b>arts</b> colony. The objective of the study was to determine the interest for attending the <b>fine</b> <b>arts</b> colony, whether the colony motivates pupils for additional <b>fine</b> <b>arts</b> activity, or is it just another competition, or <b>fine</b> <b>arts</b> contest, which stimulates pupils for <b>fine</b> <b>arts</b> with its external motivational assets (high prizes for selected works for an exhibition, recognition for award-winning works, etc.). The objective of the study was to prove that a <b>fine</b> <b>arts</b> colony is a means of motivation for <b>fine</b> <b>arts</b> activities for all pupils. In the theoretical section, we have emphasised motivation in the learning process, motivation for <b>fine</b> <b>arts</b> creativity, goals and purpose of organising the <b>fine</b> <b>arts</b> colony, comparison of <b>fine</b> <b>arts</b> colonies with contests and ex tempore and <b>fine</b> <b>arts</b> colonies as additional work with gifted pupils. The empirical section of the study is composed of two parts: quantitative non-experimental questionnaire for pupils that attended the colony and for those that did not attend the colony. The qualitative research includes case study of pupils that were identified and included in a personalised programme for gifted pupils and those that were not. By analysing <b>fine</b> <b>arts</b> works, we have presented the difference in motivation for work in a classroom and <b>fine</b> <b>arts</b> activity in a <b>fine</b> <b>arts</b> colony. The results of the qualitative and quantitative study will contribute to a new didactic quality of <b>fine</b> <b>arts</b> courses in the <b>fine</b> <b>arts</b> colony framework. They will contribute an insight into methods of teaching and work with gifted pupils in the field of <b>fine</b> <b>arts.</b> We have designed a model for planning and implementing a <b>fine</b> <b>arts</b> colony, where pupils will acquire quality <b>fine</b> <b>arts</b> experience and will be additionally motivated for <b>fine</b> <b>arts</b> activity. ...|$|R
