5000|$|... : The RH-03 Rabbit is Yellow Buster's Buster Machine, which Usada Lettuce {{combines}} with to {{form the}} control mechanism - its ears becoming the vehicle's <b>flight</b> <b>sticks.</b> Its Buster Vehicle mode {{takes the form of}} a helicopter, while its rabbit Buster Animal mode can jump very high. The [...] "RH" [...] in its name stands for [...] "Rabbit Helicopter".|$|R
50|$|The guide stick. A typical bottle rocket, with no fins {{or other}} stabilizers, relies entirely on its stick for {{stability}} in <b>flight.</b> The <b>stick's</b> length and weight are chosen to achieve this.|$|R
50|$|The player uses a <b>flight</b> <b>stick</b> {{to steer}} the plane up, down, right, and left to get the enemy {{in his or her}} sights. The {{top-mounted}} fire button is then used to shoot the enemy plane and gain points.|$|E

50|$|The game {{is housed}} in a custom wide cabinet modeled {{to look like a}} World War I biplane cockpit. It {{includes}} a similarly modeled <b>flight</b> <b>stick</b> with top-mounted fire button. The game's PCB is composed of discrete technology and includes Atari/Kee's Durastress technology. One overlay provides the onscreen crosshair.|$|E
2500|$|The SR-series {{remains the}} only {{production}} airplane in its class to include side <b>stick</b> <b>flight</b> controls that combine aspects of a traditional yoke handle (referred to in the industry as a [...] "side yoke").|$|R
5000|$|HOTAS, {{an acronym}} of Hands On Throttle-And-Stick, {{is the name}} given {{to the concept of}} placing buttons and {{switches}} on the throttle lever and <b>flight</b> control <b>stick</b> in an aircraft's cockpit, allowing pilots to access vital cockpit functions and fly the aircraft without having to remove their hands from the throttle and flight controls. Application of the concept was pioneered with the Ferranti AIRPASS radar and gunsight control system used by the English Electric Lightning and is widely used on all modern fighter aircraft such as the F-16 Fighting Falcon, the A-10A/A-10C and others.|$|R
5000|$|The gloves {{are also}} {{attached}} via a locking ring and are likewise in international orange color. These {{can be put}} on more easily and more quickly than was possible with the launch entry suit, and ball bearings allow the wrist to [...] "swivel". When the suit is pressurized, the gloves are also pressurized. The palm of the gloves is textured to allow crews to throw switches, push buttons, turn knobs (especially the [...] "ABORT MODE" [...] knob on the commander's panel), and, for the Commander and Pilot, to operate the <b>flight</b> control <b>stick</b> during the final approach during landing.|$|R
50|$|In {{the arcade}} version, the jet itself employs {{a machine gun}} and a limited set of heat-seeking missiles, in the Mastersystem version there is an unlimted amount of missiles. These weapons are {{replenished}} by another aircraft after beating a few stages. The aircraft, cannon and missile buttons are all controlled from an integrated <b>flight</b> <b>stick.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1985, Sega's third-person arcade rail shooter game Space Harrier {{introduced}} a true analog <b>flight</b> <b>stick,</b> used for movement. The joystick could register movement {{in any direction}} as well as measure the degree of push, which could move the player character at different speeds depending on how far the joystick was pushed in a certain direction.|$|E
5000|$|Like After Burner, Sky Target places {{players in}} control of a modern fighter jet. Players can select from four planes: the F-14D Super Tomcat, Rafale M, F-16C, and F-15S/MTD. The camera follows in chase view (with two {{selectable}} follow distances), and players control movement with an analog <b>flight</b> <b>stick.</b> As in After Burner, moving the reticule over a target allows the player to lock on (denoted by a voice shouting [...] "Fire!") and fire homing missiles.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} incorporates other unusual design elements. All Cirrus aircraft use {{a mechanical}} side yoke {{instead of the}} traditional yoke or <b>stick</b> <b>flight</b> controls. The aircraft also use a single power lever that adjusts both throttle and propeller RPM via a mechanical cam actuated throttle and propeller control system. Construction {{is dominated by the}} use of composite materials, although traditional aluminum is used for flight control surfaces.|$|R
5000|$|By 1942 Westland was {{building}} mostly Spitfires under contract. One {{of the problems}} with the early marks of Spitfire was variability of longitudinal stability, leading to aircraft getting dangerously out of control and contributing to the risk of structural failure [...] Petter made a significant contribution to improving the longitudinal stability of the Spitfire because {{he was the first to}} appreciate that aerodynamic modification to the elevator could provide additional stability. On his own initiative he had Penrose collect <b>flight</b> test <b>stick</b> force data and trim curves on a Spitfire at various center of gravity loadings, then produced a prototype elevator with a bulged aerodynamic section, which produced a 'remarkable' improvement in stability, later being known as the 'Westland Elevator'.|$|R
25|$|There {{are three}} primary <b>flight</b> controls: control <b>stick,</b> rudder pedals, and throttle. Typically, the control stick is termed the cyclic and tilts the rotor in the desired {{direction}} to provide {{pitch and roll}} control (some autogyros do not tilt the rotor relative to the airframe, or only do so in one dimension, and have conventional control surfaces to vary the remaining degrees of freedom). The rudder pedals provide yaw control, and the throttle controls engine power.|$|R
5000|$|... 6DoF (Six {{degrees of}} freedom): A fully {{simulated}} three dimensional {{model of the}} cockpit is presented, which the player can not only [...] "look around", but move the camera/head freely in three dimensional space. Combined with head tracking hardware, this allows player/pilots to [...] "lean around" [...] the <b>flight</b> <b>stick</b> to see controls on the panel in front of them, crane their head {{to look over the}} dash, or turn around and lean around the seat to look behind the plane in flight.|$|E
50|$|A {{steep turn}} {{increases}} the load factor of an aircraft. Simply put the aircraft feels heavier {{due to the}} effect of centrifugal force. At a 45 degree bank angle the load factor of an aircraft is 1.4 i.e. the aircraft effectively becomes 40% heavier. This requires the pilot to exert backward pressure on the <b>flight</b> <b>stick</b> or column to raise the nose, thereby creating more lift to maintain altitude. In the event that backward pressure is not exerted on the stick / column, the aircraft will tend to lose altitude.|$|E
50|$|The arcade {{version of}} Blazing Angels: Squadrons of WWII was {{developed}} by Global VR and released in 2008, based upon the PC version of the game. The initial arcade cabinet was a sit-down model that used a <b>flight</b> <b>stick</b> and throttle control scheme {{as well as a}} seat thumper to simulate the plane being shot at. An up-right model followed in 2011. Among the various locations where one is found at, a sit-down cabinet is currently available at DisneyQuest, located in Downtown Disney at the Walt Disney World Resort in Florida.|$|E
60|$|What {{on earth}} was he,--man or beast? What {{did he want}} with me? I had no weapon, not even a <b>stick.</b> <b>Flight</b> would be madness. At any rate the Thing, {{whatever}} it was, lacked the courage to attack me. Setting my teeth hard, I walked straight towards him. I was anxious not to show the fear that seemed chilling my backbone. I pushed through a tangle of tall white-flowered bushes, and saw him twenty paces beyond, {{looking over his shoulder}} at me and hesitating. I advanced a step or two, looking steadfastly into his eyes.|$|R
40|$|We {{review a}} series of {{experimental}} investigations of anomalous transport in quasi-geostrophic flow. Tracer particles are tracked {{for long periods of}} time in two-dimensional flows comprised of chains of vortices generated in a rapidly rotating annular tank. The tracer particles typically follow chaotic trajectories, alternately sticking in vortices and flying long distances in the jets surrounding the vortices. Probability distribution functions (PDFs) are measured for the <b>sticking</b> and <b>flight</b> times. The flight PDFs are found to be power laws for most time-dependent flows with coherent vortices. In many cases the PDFs have a divergent second moment, indicating the presence of L'evy flights. The variance of an ensemble of particles is found to vary in time as oe 2 t fl, with fl ? 1 (superdiffusion). The dependence of the variance exponent fl on the <b>flight</b> and <b>sticking</b> PDFs is studied and found to be consistent with calculations based on a continuous time random walk model. 1 Intro [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|May 5, 2006: At the Suwon Air Base, Korea, an A-37B {{flown by}} Captain Kim Do-hyun, 33, crashed onto {{the far edge}} of the runway during an air show that was {{intended}} to celebrate Children's Day. Cpt. Kim's A-37B, along with another A-37B from the team, just finished engaging the [...] "Opposing A-Roll" [...] maneuver, but Cpt. Kim's plane failed to climb after the maneuver and ended up crashing the far southern side of the runway, 1.8 kilometers away from the crowds. Crowds ranging in thousands, including many children, witnessed the crash. Major Bae Duk-hwan later commented that [...] "… the pilot could have escaped but hold on to the flight controls until the end as he judged that the plane might crash into the stands. If the pilot had let go of the <b>flight</b> control <b>stick,</b> nobody would have known where the plane would crash." [...] Cpt. Kim was buried with full military honours at the National Cemetery.|$|R
50|$|The {{design is}} common to many other {{low-cost}} aircraft, aluminium alloy tube strut-based construction fixed to the central fuselage tube, high wing with pre-sewn fabric envelop with life-span of 5-10 years. Cabin nacelle with open or closed (upgraded M model) windshield is fixed below the tube, tricycle landing gear is suspended with elastic ropes or the main gear is fixed on a composite spring leg for the M model. Front wheel is steered with a rudder and {{is equipped with a}} simple brake and a handle on the stick. Flight controls are standard 3-axis with <b>flight</b> <b>stick,</b> rudder and a throttle {{on the left side of}} the cabin.|$|E
50|$|Entry {{procedure}} for a steep turn involves putting the aircraft into a bank (left or right), simultaneously increasing the thrust adequately to maintain altitude, while pulling {{back on the}} <b>flight</b> <b>stick</b> or flight yoke {{to speed up the}} turning process. For Jet training an increase of 7-8% of N1 caters. While doing this the pilot has to ensure no loss or gain of altitude. The pilot is expected to constantly look outside the aircraft while keeping a close check on the Attitude indicator for angle of bank. When the aircraft is in a 45 degree bank, it is common for a certain amount of opposite aileron control to be required to prevent the aircraft from slipping into a steeper bank.|$|E
5000|$|The game's soundtrack is by Hiroshi Kawaguchi, who {{composed}} drafts on a Yamaha DX7 synthesizer {{and wrote}} out the final versions as sheet music, {{as he had}} no access to a [...] "real" [...] music sequencer at the time. A Zilog Z80 CPU powering both a Yamaha YM2203 synthesis chip and Sega’s PCM unit was used for audio and digitized voice samples. Space Harrier utilized an analog <b>flight</b> <b>stick</b> as its controller that allowed onscreen movement in all directions, while the velocity of the character's flight is unchangeable. The degree of push and acceleration varies depending on how far the stick is moved in a certain direction. Two separate [...] "fire" [...] buttons are mounted on the joystick (a trigger) and on the control panel; either one can be pressed repeatedly in order to shoot at enemies.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} the rising phenomena which occur in sticking solutions of a two-degree of freedom impact oscillator. We describe a mathematical formulation for modelling such a systems during both free <b>flight</b> and during <b>sticking</b> solutions {{for each of}} the masses in the system. Simulations of the sticking solutions are carried out, and rising events are observed when the forcing frequency parameter is varied. We show how the time of sticking reduces significantly as a rising event occurs. Then within the sticking region we show how rising is qualitatively similar to the multi-sliding bifurcation for sliding orbits. ...|$|R
25|$|Another {{critical}} addition {{was the use}} of a power-operated stabilator, {{also known}} as the all-moving tail or flying tail, a key to supersonic flight control which contrasted with traditional hinged tailplanes (horizontal stabilizers) connected mechanically to the pilot's control column. Conventional control surfaces became ineffective at the high subsonic speeds then being achieved by fighters in dives, due to the aerodynamic forces caused by the formation of shockwaves at the hinge and the rearward movement of the centre of pressure, which together could override the control forces that could be applied mechanically by the pilot, hindering recovery from the dive. A major impediment to early transonic flight was control reversal, the phenomenon which caused <b>flight</b> inputs (<b>stick,</b> rudder) to switch direction at high speed; it was the cause of many accidents and near-accidents. An all-flying tail {{is considered to be a}} minimum condition of enabling aircraft to break the transonic barrier safely without a loss of pilot control. The M.52 was the first instance of this solution, which has since gone on to be universally applied upon high-speed aircraft.|$|R

40|$|Longitudinal {{control system}} {{architectures}} are presented which directly couple <b>flight</b> <b>stick</b> motions to throttle commands for a multi-engine aircraft. This coupling enables positive attitude control with complete {{failure of the}} flight control system. The architectures chosen vary from simple feedback gains to classical lead-lag compensators with and without prefilters. Each architecture is reviewed for its appropriateness for piloted flight. The control systems are then analyzed with pilot-in-the-loop metrics related to bandwidth required for landing. Results indicate that current and proposed bandwidth requirements should be modified for throttles only flight control. Pilot ratings consistently showed better ratings than predicted by analysis. Recommendations are made for more robust design and implementation. The use of Quantitative Feedback Theory for compensator design is discussed. Although simple and effective augmented control can be achieved {{in a wide variety}} of failed configurations, a few configuration characteristics are dominant for pilot-in-the-loop control. These characteristics will be tested in a simulator study involving failed flight controls for a multi-engine aircraft...|$|E
40|$|Human-robot {{interaction}} (HRI) is {{a discipline}} investigating the factors affecting {{the interactions between}} humans and robots. It is important to evaluate how the design of interfaces and command modalities affect the human's ability to perform tasks accurately, efficiently, and effectively when working with a robot. By understanding the effects of interface design on human performance, workload, and situation awareness, interfaces can be developed to appropriately support the human in performing tasks with minimal errors and with appropriate interaction time and effort. Thus, the results of research on human-robot interfaces have direct implications {{for the design of}} robotic systems. This DRP concentrates on three areas associated with interfaces and command modalities in HRI which are applicable to NASA robot systems: 1) Video Overlays, 2) Camera Views, and 3) Command Modalities. The first study focused on video overlays that investigated how Augmented Reality (AR) symbology can be added to the human-robot interface to improve teleoperation performance. Three types of AR symbology were explored in this study, command guidance (CG), situation guidance (SG), and both (SCG). CG symbology gives operators explicit instructions on what commands to input, whereas SG symbology gives operators implicit cues so that operators can infer the input commands. The combination of CG and SG provided operators with explicit and implicit cues allowing the operator to choose which symbology to utilize. The objective {{of the study was to}} understand how AR symbology affects the human operator's ability to align a robot arm to a target using a <b>flight</b> <b>stick</b> and the ability to allocate attention between the symbology and external views of the world. The study evaluated the effects type of symbology (CG and SG) has on operator tasks performance and attention allocation during teleoperation of a robot arm. The second study expanded on the first study by evaluating the effects of the type of navigational guidance (CG and SG) on operator task performance and attention allocation during teleoperation of a robot arm through uplinked commands. Although this study complements the first study on navigational guidance with hand controllers, it is a separate investigation due to the distinction in intended operators (i. e., crewmembers versus ground-operators). A third study looked at superimposed and integrated overlays for teleoperation of a mobile robot using a hand controller. When AR is superimposed on the external world, it appears to be fixed onto the display and internal to the operators' workstation. Unlike superimposed overlays, integrated overlays often appear as three-dimensional objects and move as if part of the external world. Studies conducted in the aviation domain show that integrated overlays can improve situation awareness and reduce the amount of deviation from the optimal path. The purpose of the study was to investigate whether these results apply to HRI tasks, such as navigation with a mobile robot. HRP GAPS This HRI research contributes to closure of HRP gaps by providing information on how display and control characteristics - those related to guidance, feedback, and command modalities - affect operator performance. The overarching goals are to improve interface usability, reduce operator error, and develop candidate guidelines to design effective human-robot interfaces...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the dynamics of}} impact oscillators with multiple degrees of freedom subject {{to more than one}} motion limiting constraint or stop. A mathematical formulation for modeling such systems is developed using a modal approach including a modal form of the coefficient of restitution rule. The possible impact configurations for an N degree of freedom system are considered, along with definitions of the impact map for multiply constrained systems. We consider sticking motions that occur when a single mass in the system becomes stuck to an impact stop, and discuss the computational issues related to computing such solutions. Then using the example of a two degree of freedom system with two constraints we describe exact modal solutions for the free <b>flight</b> and <b>sticking</b> motions which occur in this system. Numerical examples of sticking orbits for this system are shown and we discuss identifying the region, S in phase space where these orbits exist. We use bifurcation diagrams to indicate differing regimes of vibro-impacting motion for two different cases; firstly when the stops are both equal and on the same side (i. e. the same sign) and secondly when the stops are unequal and of opposing sign. For these two different constraint configurations we observe qualitatively different dynamical behavior, which is interpreted using impact mappings and two-dimensional parameter space. ...|$|R
