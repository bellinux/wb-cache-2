[...] He was recruited eventually to Duke by assistant coach Chuck Swenson, who would later become an assistant coach during Amaker's first five seasons at Michigan from 2001 to 2006.|$|E
500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "My Heart Is Broken" [...] {{was directed by}} Dean Karr. Filming commenced on December 1, 2011 in Los Angeles. During an interview with MTV News, Lee stated that the visual was [...] "ethereal", also saying that [...] "this [...] <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> a lot different. Actually, I kind of {{wanted it to be}} the opposite. The first video, for 'What You Want,' was very real, and this is very surreal." [...] The singer further confessed that the clip draws inspiration from dark fantasy horror film Paperhouse (1988) in order to achieve surreality. Lee further explained, [...] " [...] this girl, and everything that she would draw would come to life in her dreams, and she was creating this dream world for herself. And at first, it was cool, but then it's like this nightmare. So I sort of thought it would apply, and be cool, to have it be this dream that you're trapped in. So you're in a place that, at first, is a magical world, but at the same time, you're isolated and trapped there, and that's the reason you {{want to come back to}} reality after a time." [...] When filming the video, fiber optics were used reportedly in order to create the effect of things coming to life after drawing them. Lee described the appearance of the rest of the group in the visual as [...] "sort of like the dream within the dream, in an abyss of darkness".|$|E

The hat was also described as a miss with female customers over a certain weight. [...] "Ostrich plumes may dip beguilingly, but if the wearer has two chins or three, where one ought to be, she <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> atrocious instead of audacious".|$|E

If you select out the winners, you leave mostly losers." [...] Chuck Colson responded to Kleiman's article. Colson accused the article of being an attack against Bush and his promotion of faith-based programs. Scott Nowell of the Houston Press said that [...] "Colson didn't really address Kleiman's argument of selection bias." ...|$|E
