40|$|This article {{considers}} {{whether the}} recent {{decision of the}} International Court of Justice in Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (Germany v. Italy: Greece Intervening) definitively draws the line under the question whether states enjoy jurisdictional immunity in cases involving allegations of human rights violations. The article first submits that the judgment is likely to foreclose {{the development of an}} exception to state immunity {{on the basis of the}} nature of the allegations alone. However, it argues that the Court's rejection of the so-called 'forum of last resort' exception to immunity may not be determinative. Rather, such an exception may still emerge in national and international courts mandated to assess the impact of the lack of alternative means available to address a claim on the right of access to a court. The article concludes with an assessment of the impact of the judgment on the availability of immunity <b>ratione</b> <b>materiae</b> to individuals in such cases. It offers analysis as to why immunity <b>ratione</b> <b>materiae</b> can be considered separately from that of the state in civil proceedings and explores whether the recognition of individual civil responsibility in international law could form a basis for an exception to immunity <b>ratione</b> <b>materiae.</b> © The Author (2012).

40|$|State {{immunity}} {{under international}} law extends to protect some individuals from criminal prosecution before national courts. This thesis aims to identify which individuals are immune from prosecution before the English courts, for what conduct, and for what period. The justifications for immunity are examined, {{and the extent of}} immunity ratione personae and immunity <b>ratione</b> <b>materiae</b> are explored. This thesis argues that immunity ratione personae is only narrowly available to high state officials, and that the immunity accorded, by consent, to special missions is sufficient to cover other official visits. In Pinochet (No 3) all seven judges agreed: 1. An ex-head of state is immune from prosecution for murder and conspiracy to murder alleged to have been committed in the forum state. 2. All state officials no matter how minor are entitled to continuing immunity This thesis analyses state practice in arresting or prosecuting foreign state officials, and argues that both of these statements are incorrect. This thesis argues that immunity does not attach to conduct alone, for a person to have continuing immunity <b>ratione</b> <b>materiae</b> they must have had immunity ratione personae. The forum state must have agreed to the official being present on its territory, and agreed to the purpose of the visit. Those officials present on the territory of a foreign state with the consent of that state who have immunity ratione personae have continuing immunity <b>ratione</b> <b>materiae</b> only for official conduct, acta jure imperii. This does not extend to acts of violence. Finally the development of the regime for the prosecution and punishment of international crimes by national courts is considered. The conflict with immunity is examined, and a possible reconciliation between the two principles is suggested by using the complementarity principle in the statute of the International Criminal Court.

40|$|Increasingly, investor-state arbitral tribunals {{have found}} {{themselves}} faced with claims by holding companies, subsidiaries or ultimate beneficiaries within “corporate groups,” where {{the basis of the}} claim concerns property acquired in, or from, a fellow group member. Whilst the primacy of the state of incorporation for the purposes of nationality jurisdiction remains fundamentally intact, the question remains as to whether the shifting of assets entirely within a group can be considered an ‘investment’ in terms of a tribunal’s <b>ratione</b> <b>materiae</b> jurisdiction. This paper offers an analysis of corporate groups predicated on their observed economic behaviour, with a view to how this might impinge on the economic conception of investment proffered in the jurisprudence of arbitral tribunals since Salini v Morocco. The author suggests that the activities of closely-held subsidiaries cannot technically be classed as investments, lacking a sufficient independent contribution and expectation of a pecuniary return. However, the outcome which is more consistent with the purposes and the consensus of prior awards is that such transactions still amount to an investment by reference to the underlying commitment of the parent company.

40|$|European Union {{citizenship}} {{was established}} by the Treaty of Maastricht in 1992. Intended to fall within the exclusive prerogative of the Member States, {{it soon became clear}} that the autonomy of Member States to determine matters relating to nationality would be restricted by the ever-expansive reach of the European Court of Justice. As such, the European Court of Justice transformed the law on citizenship in the 2010 case of Rottmann where measures affecting or depriving the rights conferred and protected by the European Union were held to fall within the scope <b>ratione</b> <b>materiae</b> of European Union law. While Rottmann affirmed the law as to the deprivation of European Union citizenship, it left unanswered the question whether the acquisition of nationality also falls within the scope of European Union law. This paper aims to identify and analyse the law arising post-Rottmann to determine whether the acquisition of nationality could fall within the scope of European Union law. It shall then analyse whether fundamental principles of European Union law, namely the principle of proportionality, could be applied in order to regulate the conditions imposed by Member States in relation to the acquisition of nationality...|$|R

Despite the absence of administrative courts from the Polish scene for over forty years, there is undoubtedly a certain consistent developmental line. Namely, the dratfs of administrative courts legislation from 1958 and 1972 clearly referred to the Acts on the Supreme Administrative Tribunal; the same Acts had great influence on the Law of 31 January 1980 on the Chief Administrative Court. The author characterises the organisation and the scope of activity of the Chief Administrative Tribunal. Then he presents the amendments introduced in 1990, in particular the widening of <b>ratione</b> <b>materiae</b> jurisdiction (a general clause with very few exceptions) and granting to that Tribunal the powers resulting from the emergence of local self-government (i. a. judicial control of acts connected with the execution by state authorities of supervision over local self-government, settlement of competence disputes between local self-government and central state administration organs).

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the extent to which}} state officials are subject to prosecution in foreign domestic courts for international crimes. We consider the different types of immunity that international law accords to state officials, the reasons for the conferment of this immunity and whether they apply in cases in which it is alleged that the official has committed an international crime. We argue that personal immunity (immunity ratione personae) continues to apply even where prosecution is sought for international crimes. Also we consider that instead of a single category of personal immunity there are in fact two types of such immunity and that one type extends beyond senior officials such as the Head of State and Head of Government. Most of the article deals with functional immunity (immunity <b>ratione</b> <b>materiae).</b> We take the view that this type of immunity does not apply in the case of domestic prosecution of foreign officials for most international crimes. However, we reject the traditional arguments which have been put forward by scholars and courts in support of this view. Instead we consider the key to understanding when functional immunity is available lies in examining how jurisdiction is conferred on domestic courts. © EJIL 2011; all rights reserved...|$|R

Although the official languages of the Court are English and French, applications may be submitted in any one of the official languages of the contracting states. An application has to be made in writing and signed by the applicant or by the applicant's representative. Once registered with the Court, the case is assigned to a judge rapporteur, who can make a final decision that the case is inadmissible. A case may be inadmissible when it is incompatible with the requirements of <b>ratione</b> <b>materiae,</b> <b>ratione</b> temporis or ratione personae, or if the case cannot be proceeded with on formal grounds, such as non-exhaustion of domestic remedies, lapse of the six months from the last internal decision complained of, anonymity, substantial identity with a matter already submitted to the Court, or with another procedure of international investigation. If the rapporteur judge decides that the case can proceed, the case is referred to a Chamber of the Court which, unless it decides that the application is inadmissible, communicates the case to the government of the state against which the application is made, asking the government to present its observations on the case. The Chamber of the Court then deliberates and judges the case on its admissibility and its merits. Cases that raise serious questions of interpretation and application of the European Convention on Human Rights, a serious issue of general importance, or which may depart from previous case law can be heard in the Grand Chamber if all parties to the case agree to the Chamber of the Court relinquishing jurisdiction to the Grand Chamber. A panel of five judges decides whether the Grand Chamber accepts the referral.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The European Union {{suffers from}} an empty formalistic {{reading of the}} {{principle}} of equality when dealing with situations where different legal orders legitimately compete, aspiring to regulate the condition of the same persons in the same circumstances. Consequently, equality before the law is not safeguarded in the Union, and a radical reform of the procedural reading {{of the principle of}} equality is required. Most importantly, to live up to being a true principle of EU law, equality in the EU needs to acquire a substantive component which is entirely missing at the moment. This paper looks at the procedural vistas informing the ECJ‘s attempts to address the EU‘s fundamental problems through the redefinition of the scope <b>ratione</b> <b>materiae</b> of EU law following the introduction of Union citizenship, only to find the outcomes of such efforts inadequate and potentially dangerous {{for the rule of law}} in Europe. It is suggested that a substantive approach to equality could be employed instead, and that the idea of respect, lying just as equality itself, at the core of the notion of citizenship Ã¢â¬ and the law as such Ã¢â¬ could supply the missing core of the equality principle, providing the much-needed cure for some crucial deficiencies of EU law as it currently stands. citizenship; federalism; nationality; sovereignty; competences; European citizenship; European law; German Constitutional Court; non-discrimination; reverse discrimination...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between State immunity and diplomatic immunity {{has always been}} a rather complex one. The two concepts undoubtedly have a common juridical background {{in the form of the}} concepts of sovereignty, independence and dignity. 1 On the other hand, recent developments in both fields have seen a move towards a more functional-based approach. Thus, in relation to diplomatic immunity, the dominant theoretical basis is that of functional necessity. 2 As regards State immunity, recent developments in both international law 3 and, more particularly, in UK law 4, from absolute to restrictive State immunity, have resulted in a more functionally orientated approach, that is, a shift of emphasis in matters of State immunity from immunity ratione personae to immunity <b>ratione</b> <b>materiae.</b> 5 Now two recent cases in the United Kingdom have raised the possibility that, in the case of diplomats at least, the two concepts may be combined to provide a double immunity for diplomatic agents against civil suit. More controversially, the cases have raised the possibility of a third type of protection based upon immunity ratione personae in what could be said to amount to a modified act of State doctrine. The cases in question are Propend Finance Pty Ltd. v. Alan Sing and The Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police 6 and Re P (Diplomatic Immunity: Jurisdiction). ...|$|R
