5|$|A {{review in}} The Economist calls this a {{powerful}} book which articulates the politics involved {{and the degree}} to which scientists <b>have</b> <b>sometimes</b> manufactured and exaggerated environmental uncertainties, but opines that the authors fail to fully explain how environmental action has still often proved possible despite countervailing factors.|$|E
50|$|Because Rangvald Ulfsson <b>has</b> <b>sometimes</b> been {{regarded}} {{as the father of}} Stenkil, Astrid <b>has</b> <b>sometimes</b> {{been regarded}} as that king's mother.|$|R

25|$|In modern scholarship, {{the word}} <b>has</b> <b>sometimes</b> been re-interpreted from the {{traditional}} meaning of carpenter and <b>has</b> <b>sometimes</b> been translated as craftsman, as the meaning of builder is implied, but {{can be applied to}} both wood-work and stone masonry.|$|R
5|$|Events in {{southern}} Britain to 796 <b>have</b> <b>sometimes</b> been {{portrayed as a}} struggle between Offa and Charlemagne, but the disparity in their power was enormous. By 796 Charlemagne had become master of an empire which stretched from the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Hungarian Plain, and Offa and then Coenwulf were clearly minor figures by comparison.|$|E
5|$|Helpers, {{offspring}} {{from the}} previous brood, <b>have</b> <b>sometimes</b> been noted to assist in feeding the fledglings at the nest of their parents. Cases of brood parasitism by the Asian koel have been noted. An average breeding success of 44% has been noted with {{the main cause of}} fledgling mortality being shortage of insect food which in turn was dependent on rainfall.|$|E
5|$|In the past, other dromaeosaurid species, {{including}} Deinonychus antirrhopus and Saurornitholestes langstoni, <b>have</b> <b>sometimes</b> been classified in {{the genus}} Velociraptor. Since Velociraptor {{was the first to}} be named, these species were renamed Velociraptor antirrhopus and V. langstoni. However, the only currently recognized species of Velociraptor are V. mongoliensis and V. osmolskae.|$|E

5|$|Intermediate birds occur {{where the}} {{recognised}} forms meet and interbreed, and <b>have</b> <b>sometimes</b> been given subspecies status, including S. b. kreczmeri in Poland and S. b. pateffi in Bulgaria, {{but these are}} not generally accepted as valid taxa.|$|E
5|$|Later in the 20th century, as disruptively {{patterned}} uniforms became widespread, winter {{variants of}} patterns such as Flecktarn were developed, the background colour (such as green) being replaced with white {{to form a}} Schneetarn (snow camouflage pattern). Aircraft deployed in winter <b>have</b> <b>sometimes</b> been snow camouflaged, as with Sepecat Jaguars on exercise in Norway.|$|E
5|$|Muskrats <b>have</b> <b>sometimes</b> been a food {{resource}} for North Americans. In the southeastern portion of Michigan, a longstanding dispensation allows Catholics to consume muskrat as their Friday penance, on Ash Wednesday, and on Lenten Fridays (when the eating of meat, except for fish, is prohibited); this tradition {{dates back to}} at least the early 19th century.|$|E

5|$|On {{the other}} hand, blue collar foreign workers <b>have</b> <b>sometimes</b> {{been unable to}} collect {{salaries}} due even when the Saudi Labor Office has ruled in their favor, since employers can stall payment until the worker' work permits have expired.|$|E
5|$|The {{common and}} Asian house martins <b>have</b> <b>sometimes</b> been {{considered}} to be a single species, although both breed in the western Himalayas without hybridising. There is also limited DNA evidence that suggests a significant genetic distance between these two martins.|$|E
5|$|Vegetation {{is typical}} of the Sahara-Sahel region, and is mainly desert with thorny steppe land. Soil erosion is a problem, as many {{previously}} wooded areas have disappeared as the locals use wood for fuel, and inadequate farming practices <b>have</b> <b>sometimes</b> resulted in soil exhaustion.|$|E

5|$|When animals choose mates, traits such as {{signalling}} {{are subject}} to evolutionary pressure. For example, the male gray tree frog, Hyla versicolor, produces a call to attract females. Once a female chooses a mate, this selects for a specific style of male calling, thus propagating a specific signalling ability. The signal can be the call itself, the intensity of a call, its variation style, its repetition rate, and so on. Various hypotheses seek to explain why females would select for one call over the other. The sensory exploitation hypothesis proposes that pre-existing preferences in female receivers can drive the evolution of signal innovation in male senders, {{in a similar way}} to the hidden preference hypothesis which proposes that successful calls are better able to match some 'hidden preference' in the female. Signallers <b>have</b> <b>sometimes</b> evolved multiple sexual ornaments, and receivers <b>have</b> <b>sometimes</b> evolved multiple trait preferences.|$|E
5|$|You made me very low-spirited last night, by your {{manner of}} talking—You are my only friend—the only person I am {{intimate}} with.—I {{never had a}} father, or a brother—you have been both to me, ever since I knew you—yet I <b>have</b> <b>sometimes</b> been very petulant.—I have been thinking of those instances of ill-humour and quickness, and they appeared like crimes. Yours sincerely, Mary.|$|E
5|$|A few teleosts are dangerous. Some, like eeltail catfish (Plotosidae), scorpionfish (Scorpaenidae) or {{stonefish}} (Synanceiidae) have venomous spines {{that can}} seriously injure or kill humans. Some, like the electric eel and the electric catfish, {{can give a}} severe electric shock. Others, such as the piranha and barracuda, have a powerful bite and <b>have</b> <b>sometimes</b> attacked human bathers. Reports indicate {{that some of the}} catfish family can be large enough to prey on human bathers.|$|E

5|$|Beavers, rodents {{weighing}} up to , <b>have</b> <b>sometimes</b> caused problems along Fanno Creek. In 2014 and 2015, a growing population of beavers gnawed down trees and dammed the creek in Greenway Park in Beaverton. Rising waters have covered {{one of the}} side trails in the park, which has been gated and closed. During heavy rains, water from the beaver pond sometimes covers the main trail. Park officials are considering a variety of options, including re-routing the trails, building a boardwalk over the water, or removing the beaver dams.|$|E
5|$|Because of its {{unstable}} nature, astronomers {{now consider}} the scattered disc {{to be the}} place of origin for most periodic comets in the Solar System, with the centaurs, a population of icy bodies between Jupiter and Neptune, being the intermediate stage in an object's migration from the disc to the inner Solar System. Eventually, perturbations from the giant planets send such objects towards the Sun, transforming them into periodic comets. Many Oort cloud objects are also thought to have originated in the scattered disc. Detached objects are not sharply distinct from scattered disc objects, and some such as Sedna <b>have</b> <b>sometimes</b> been considered {{to be included in}} this group.|$|E
5|$|Bonshō have {{occasionally}} {{been used}} as musical instruments in modern compositions. The recorded sound of temple bells was used in Mayuzumi Toshiro's piece Olympic Campanology, used to open the 1964 Tokyo Olympic Games. A temple bell is also used in performances of Jacob Druckman's piece Lamia, {{in which it is}} rung while placed on top of a kettledrum. Modern composers for percussion <b>have</b> <b>sometimes</b> used the temple bell to replace the now common sound of the orchestral tam-tam.|$|E
