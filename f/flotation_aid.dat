50|$|The Diver Life Raft and Surf Shuttle are {{inflatable}} {{safety devices}} for diving where currents or distance {{could create a}} life-threatening situation if the diver is separated from the dive boat. They are intended as <b>flotation</b> <b>aids</b> for lost dvers or those facing long surface swims. These items {{can be stored in}} a pocket mounted to the diver's backplate.|$|R
2500|$|Other {{rules of}} triathlon vary from race to race and {{generally}} involve descriptions of allowable equipment (for example, wetsuits are allowed in USAT {{events in the}} swimming stage of some races when the water temperature is below [...] ), and prohibitions against interference between athletes. Additionally, the use of flippers or other swim propulsion and <b>flotation</b> <b>aids</b> are illegal in triathlon and can result in disqualification.|$|R
50|$|There is no {{auxiliary}} power unit installed on the AW169; instead, the transmission features a clutch to allow the rotors to be stopped while the engines continue to run to power the avionics and onboard electrical systems. On customer request, the AW169 can be equipped with a comprehensive full ice protection system; a limited ice protection system may also be alternatively integrated. To meet differing customer's requirements and preferences, the AW169 can be configured with numerous optional items of equipment, such as auxiliary fuel tanks, rescue hoist, cargo hook, emergency <b>flotation</b> <b>aids,</b> external cameras, rappelling fittings, wire strike protection system, mission consoles, external loudspeakers, and external lighting arrangements.|$|R
5000|$|Richman {{was also}} an amateur aviator of some accomplishment, being the {{co-pilot}} in 1936, with famed flyer Henry Tindall [...] "Dick" [...] Merrill, of the first round-trip transatlantic flight in his own single-engine Vultee transport. Richman had filled much of the empty space of the aircraft with ping pong balls as a <b>flotation</b> <b>aid</b> in case they were forced down in the Atlantic, and after the successful flight he sold autographed ones until his death. They continue to turn up on eBay to this day.|$|E
50|$|Buoyancy {{aids are}} a {{specialist}} form of personal flotation device (PFD) used most commonly by kayakers, canoeists and dinghy sailors. They are {{designed as a}} <b>flotation</b> <b>aid,</b> rather than a life-saving device and have several key differences to other PFD's and lifejackets. Regardless of the specification of buoyancy aids, {{it is important to}} remember that they do not provide (nor are they intended to) the same high level of protection as lifejackets. Therefore, they should not be used as a substitute for a life-jacket, particularly where children are concerned.|$|E
50|$|Solo {{kiteboarding}} {{has been}} a frequent contributing cause to accidents; kiteboarders should try to kite with friends {{and keep an eye}} on one another. A kitesurfer can get farther from shore than an easy swim, which is the primary reason kitesurfing in directly offshore winds is discouraged. Marine hazards include sharks, jellyfish, sea otters, dolphins, and even crocodiles, depending on the location. Drowning {{has been a}} factor in severe accidents as well and may have been avoided in some cases through the use of an appropriate <b>flotation</b> <b>aid</b> or impact vest and development of acceptable swimming skills.|$|E
50|$|High-end triathlon wetsuits {{have extra}} {{flexibility}} that provides easier {{range of motion}} than a surfing or diving wetsuit. Some triathlon wetsuits have varied thickness by way of panels that provide custom <b>flotation</b> that <b>aids</b> the wearer in keeping an efficient position in the water.|$|R
50|$|Only six of {{the twenty}} six people on board escaped from the helicopter; Lawlor exited through the {{emergency}} exit window by his seat, while Charleton and a child got out through the forward freight bay. Another child managed to escape via the rear freight bay, and two adults exited through the starboard airstairs door. In addition to the two pilots, the survivors were Howard Goddard (aged 12), Ellen Hounslow (15), Lucille Langley-Williams and Megan Smith. Hounslow spotted that Goddard was struggling in the water, and she swam to help him. None of the six had managed to retrieve a life jacket, and so the two pilots gathered the survivors together, and helped keep them afloat, using suitcases as <b>flotation</b> <b>aids.</b>|$|R

50|$|The swim is done at a person's own risk. There are no lifeguards or rescue boats. Participants are {{expected}} to be accomplished swimmers: others are told not to swim. Swimmers are encouraged to use a <b>flotation</b> <b>aid</b> such as a pull buoy or wetsuit. Alligators have been seen in the lake at times and some swimmers do swim with knives, but there has never been an alligator attack. Reportedly, a lake cane monster lives in the lake. Although, never photographed, residents and swimmers have reported sightings or feeling the monster brush up against them. All new swimmers to the lake for their first 3 crossings must have flotation with them, no exceptions. This could be {{in the form of a}} pull buoy, lifeguard buoy, wetsuit, etc.|$|E
5000|$|The {{eggs and}} the larvae of {{two species of}} Sphecodopsis, S. capensis and S. fumipennis, have been {{thoroughly}} described, while larval information for the other species remains mostly unstudied or unpublished. Eggs are smaller than {{the size of the}} adult suggests, whitish, and long with a gentle curve, narrowing to a rounded point. The first instar of the larva has a forked abdominal tip that allows it to crawl inside the nest cell. The head capsule is pigmented and its abdomen is slender. It possesses long sickle-shaped mandibles that enable it to destroy any other eggs or larvae in the cell. [...] In the second instar the forked abdominal tip remains but the mandibles are much reduced, and the body extends laterally, presumably a <b>flotation</b> <b>aid</b> as food stores become gradually liquefied in the cell. This description applies to both of the species studied, and may be markedly different for other species in the genus, although certain features, such as strong mandibles for destroying competition in the cell, are presumably the same in design and function.|$|E
40|$|A {{large portion}} of the world's {{phosphate}} reserves are sedimentary type containing appreciable amounts of carbonate minerals. These are the most difficult type of deposits to beneficiate. The depletion of other reserves easier to beneficiate necessitates research to find methods of mineral processing for carbonate rich sedimentary phosphate deposits. In this study, a new flotation method is described which was applied successfully in a laboratory scale flotation cell. Flotation of Al-Jalamid phosphate rock (sedimentary type with high carbonates and low silica content) found in northern Saudi Arabia was studied using a fatty acid as collector and sodium sulfate as a <b>flotation</b> <b>aid...</b>|$|E
5|$|To {{test the}} design, the Do 17S and Do 17U were produced, both {{to be powered}} by the DB 600 power plants. However, a call for all DB 600 series engines to be {{reserved}} for fighters led to the variants being fitted with Bramo Fafnir 323 A radial engines. The bomb load was increased to 1,000kg (2,200lb) and a fourth crew member was added. It proved to be underpowered, so Bramo 323 P engines were then fitted. Only three Do 17S and 15 Do 17Us were built. With the updates, the Dornier, with a full bomb load, had a combat radius of 322km (200mi). Later variants, in the Do 17 Z-3, Z-4 and Z-5, which were fitted with cameras, dual trainer controls and <b>flotation</b> <b>aids</b> (for maritime operations) respectively, still could not solve the problems with range and bomb load.|$|R
5000|$|The amphibious {{propulsion}} {{is provided}} by two Dowty water impellers, one mounted {{on each side of}} the vehicle and controlled by the commander in the rear seat facing forwards. The water jets are used to steer the vehicle when swimming, this is with the use of movable cowls directing the flow of water. When not in use, the propulsion unit water intakes are closed off with armoured covers to prevent damage during digging operations. <b>Flotation</b> <b>aids</b> are required to trim the vehicle for swimming and a [...] "wash board" [...] is fitted to the front of the vehicle to prevent the bow wave flooding the crew compartment when entering water. Maximum speed in water is 8.5 knots, the vehicle will wade in 1.8m of water and requires preparation for operating in deeper water this as it achieves buoyancy.

40|$|Darwin was {{an early}} {{exponent}} {{of the importance of}} ‘occasional means of dispersal’ in accounting for the present-day distribution of plants and animals. This study examined the implications of capture on the water surface of meltwater and seawater for the local and long-range dispersal of Antarctic springtails. Individuals of the maritime Antarctic collembolan Cryptopygus antarcticus, were floated on tap water and seawater at 0, 5 and 10 °C. LT 50 s on seawater were 34 (10 °C), 65 (5 °C) and 75 (0 °C) days. On tap water, LT 50 s were 69 (10 °C), 126 (5 °C) and 239 (0 °C) days. Less than 20 % escaped from the water surface. A significantly greater proportion of springtails moulted on tap water and viable offspring were produced on both tap water and seawater. Comparison across treatments of survival of moulting and non-moulting individuals found significantly greater survival in moulting animals for three of the treatment combinations. It is suggested that moult exuviae facilitate survival on the water film through the simultaneous provision of a <b>flotation</b> <b>aid</b> and a source of nourishment – that is, an ‘edible raft’. A separate experiment measuring changes in haemolymph osmolality over time on tap water and seawater at 2 and 5 °C found significant differences in all treatments. Causes of mortality are discussed in relation to osmoregulatory failure and starvation...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the movement patterns of children during free play in a swimming school setting. It was hypothesized that children being taught using flotation vests would be less likely to surface dive, jump, and dive during free play. In this study, 24 participants were observed using a video camera during a 10 -minute free play period at the end of a learn-to-swim session. Each subject had undergone 10 lessons either using a flotation vest (n = 11) or without (n = 13). The results showed that the <b>flotation</b> <b>aid</b> group (FLOAT) had significantly fewer surface dives (p = 0. 006, using a two sample t-test) compared to the control group (CON) and that FLOAT asked for flotation toys significantly more often than CON (p = 0. 03) during free play. No statistically significant differences between groups were observed for breathing, diving, and water entry skills, and the distance moved on land and in water due to low statistical power, but FLOAT participants seemed to be less likely to do vertically-oriented movements. We concluded that children learning to swim using flotation aids had a tendency to move more horizontally during free play and to not choose vertical axis movements (jumping and surface diving) compared to children being taught without the flotation vest...|$|E
40|$|The mineral {{processing}} industry {{relies heavily on}} froth flotation to beneficiate complex minerals. The performance of the process depends on a multitude of chemical reagents affecting the solid mineral particles {{as well as the}} air bubbles used to collect the valuable mineral particles. In flotation, bubbles and froths are transiently stable by the use of a frothing agent or the presence of inorganic electrolytes in the process water. This review presents the primary stages characterizing bubble coalescence. The effect of flotation reagents and inorganic electrolytes on the stability of bubbles and the mechanisms which delay the coalescence of bubbles are discussed. Recently it had been proposed that solid particles external to the flotation system may be intentionally added to stabilize the froth phase, which has attracted attention from the flotation community. This gave rise to additional studies on the topic. The final section of the paper was therefore designed to capture the progress made on this particular subject. The use of solid <b>flotation</b> <b>aids</b> offers a promising future to increase the recovery of valuable particles as these external particles may be customized. The advantage of solid particles over soluble reagents is that they may be recovered and re-used making them environmentally and economically attractive...|$|R

5000|$|A {{well known}} {{work in the}} area of surface tension <b>aided</b> <b>flotation</b> was the {{analysis}} of water strider locomotion along the surface of water. [...] Using the idea of flexible structures, Ji et al. re-examined this problem by considering the compliance of a water strider leg. By modeling the leg as a compliant structure that deforms at the water surface (rather than pierce it), Ji was able to ascertain what added benefit this flexibility has in supporting the insect. Other studies on the water strider have examined the ways in which flexibility can affect wetting properties of the leg.|$|R
40|$|For {{the first}} time, NMR Imaging {{has been used}} to provide {{non-invasive}} quantitative data for transient washwater addition to rising foam. Washwater is routinely added to <b>flotation</b> froths to <b>aid</b> rejection of unwanted gangue material from the concentrate stream. The results show that washwater added to a mature foam (i. e., one that has attained its equilibrium liquid fraction) travels down the column, whereas washwater added to an immature foam travels up the column. This observation has important implications for flotation plant practise; washwater added too early at start-up will not aid gangue rejection but will instead merely lead to a wetter concentrate stream. This is explained theoretically {{in the context of the}} Hydrodynamic Theory of Rising Foam...|$|R
40|$|Frothers {{are used}} in <b>flotation</b> to <b>aid</b> {{generation}} of small bubbles, but {{little is known about}} the mechanisms that take place in the flotation machine to produce such an effect. Coalescence prevention is the common explanation, although the exact mechanism is obscure and almost no attention has been paid to a frother effect on bubble break-up, the other possible mechanism. This thesis presents a technique to study the effect of frothers on bubble coalescence at the generation stage (at a capillary tube) and a technique to study the effect of frothers on bubble coalescence and break-up in a turbulent field. The first technique is based on the sound bubbles emit when they form and coalesce. The sound signal was linked to bubble formation and coalescence events using high-speed cinematography. The technique has a resolution capable of detecting coalescence events that occur within 1 - 2 ms. The second technique allows discriminating between coalescence and break-up and is based on the exposure of a mono-size distribution of bubbles to a turbulent field generated by a three-bladed axial flow impeller. Analysis of bubble size distributions after contact with the turbulent field gives the coalescence and break-up fraction. The results show frothers reduce coalescence and alter the bubble size distribution of bubbles generated by break-up. In the course of high-speed imaging an effect of frother on bubble shape and motion after formation was detected. Analysis of this forms the third major component of the work. A dependence of velocity on bubble aspect ratio is shown, which is in line with recent literature...|$|R
5000|$|The attack {{across the}} canal cutting, {{also known as}} the Battle of Bellenglise, saw IX Corps (commanded by Braithwaite), on the right of the American and Australian Divisions, launch its assault between Riqueval and Bellenglise. (On the right of the IX Corps front the canal ran through the 1,200 yard (1098m) long Le Tronquoy tunnel, but there was no {{intention}} to launch an attack across the tunnel in the manner of the Bellicourt tunnel battle plan). The assault was spearheaded by the 46th (North Midland) Division under the command of Major-General Gerald Boyd. In this sector the St Quentin Canal formed an immense, ready-made anti-tank [...] "ditch" [...] and the main Hindenburg Line trench system lay on the east (German) side of the canal. IX Corps was supported by tanks of the 3rd Tank Brigade, which had to cross Bellicourt Tunnel in the 30th U.S. Division sector and then move south along the east bank of the canal. IX Corps had to cross the formidable canal cutting (which increased in depth as it approached Riqueval until its very steep banks, strongly defended by fortified machine gun positions, were over 50 feet deep in places), and then fight its way through the Hindenburg Line trenches. The final objective of 46th Division for 29 September was a line of high ground beyond the villages of Lehaucourt and Magny-la-Fosse. British 32nd Division, following behind, would then leapfrog 46th Division. Following a devastating artillery bombardment (which was heaviest in this sector), and in thick fog and smoke British 46th (North Midland) Division fought its way through the German trenches west of the canal and then across the waterway. 137th (Staffordshire) Brigade spearheaded the attack. The ferocity of the creeping artillery barrage contributed greatly {{to the success of the}} assault, keeping the Germans pinned in their dugouts. The soldiers used a variety of <b>flotation</b> <b>aids</b> devised by the Royal Engineers (including improvised floating piers and 3,000 lifebelts from cross-Channel steamers) to cross the water. Scaling ladders were used to climb the brick wall lining the canal. Some men of the 1/6th Battalion, the North Staffordshire Regiment, led by Captain A. H. Charlton, managed to seize the still-intact Riqueval Bridge over the canal before the Germans had a chance to fire their explosive charges. (The bridge had not been destroyed previously by the Germans because it was a major link to the ground they held west of the canal). 46th Division captured the village of Bellenglise, including its great tunnel/troop shelter (which had been constructed as part of the Hindenburg Line defences). [...] By the end of the day 46th Division had taken 4,200 German prisoners (out of a total for the army of 5,100) and 70 guns. The assault across the canal met all of its objectives, on schedule, at a cost of somewhat fewer than 800 casualties to the division. The great success of the day had come where many had least expected it. The 46th Division assault was considered to be one of the outstanding feats of arms of the war. Bean described the attack as an [...] "extraordinarily difficult task" [...] and [...] "a wonderful achievement" [...] in his official Australian war history. Monash wrote that it was [...] "an astonishing success...which materially assisted me in the situation in which I was placed later on the same day". Later in the day the leading brigades of 32nd Division (including Lt Wilfred Owen of the Manchester Regiment) crossed the canal and moved forward through 46th Division. The whole of 32nd Division was east of the canal by nightfall.|$|R
30|$|Flotation {{has been}} widely used in mineral separation, oil–water separation, paper pulp de-inking, and {{wastewater}} treatment (Cheng et al. 2016). Previous studies indicate that flotation is inexpensive, it reduces the amount of mineral ash, and it enriches the material in useful minerals (Tsai and Lumpkin 1984; Cheng et al. 2017). However, until now, only a few articles have concentrated on oil-shale flotation. Thyabat et al. (2014) thought that flotation could improve the grade of low-grade oil shale. Altun et al. (2009) used ultrasonically <b>aided</b> <b>flotation</b> to improve the floatability of oil shale {{and concluded that the}} particulates filling the pores/voids or attached to the surfaces of the larger particles were effectively removed after ultrasonic treatment. Li et al. (2012) studied the effect of the dosages of the oleic acid collector, the kerosene collector, and the frother on the floatability of Fushun oil shale. Their results indicate that oleic acid and kerosene collectors affect the enrichment of organic matter in the oil shale. Altun et al. (2006 a, b) investigated the effects of the conditioning time, flotation time, pulp density, particle size, and the frother dosage on the flotation performance of the Himmetoğlu oil shale. Their factorial experiments showed that pulp density was the most important parameter affecting flotation performance. The FTIR spectrum confirmed the organic-rich and highly humic character of oil shale. El-Mofty (2018) obtained a 20 % kerogen concentrate from a 10 % kerogen sample with 70 % recovery at a pH of 5 without a collector.|$|R
40|$|Separation of {{pyrochlore}} {{from its}} associated minerals is typically accomplished by froth flotation. The surface chemistry of pyrochlore {{is similar to}} many of its associated non-value minerals. Therefore, understanding the surface chemical properties of the pyrochlore for selective pyrochlore <b>flotation</b> will potentially <b>aid</b> {{in the design of}} flotation strategies for optimized recovery. In this study, pyrochlore samples were collected from various points in the flotation scheme at the Niobec plant, Quebec, Canada. The SEM-EDX analysis revealed that pyrochlore from the Niobec deposit occurs as high and low iron varieties, and that recovery favours varieties with a lower Fe content. To understand a potential relationship between pyrochlore matrix composition and the related effect on collector adsorption, the surface of grains from the concentrate and tails were examined by TOF-SIMS. The surface analyses of different pyrochlore grains showed that species indicative of the cationic collector (Tallow diamine acetate) favour Fe poor pyrochlore relative to the Fe rich variety. XPS was used to analyse the surface of high Fe and low Fe pyrochlore in order to identify a potential relationship between pyrochlore matrix composition and surface chemistry. The XPS results verified a relationship between pryochlore surface oxidation and Fe content in the mineral matrix; high Fe pyrochlore particles showed a greater proportion of surface oxidation species suggesting preferential oxidation in comparison with low Fe pyrochlore particles. SEM-EDX analyses revealed that many of the pyrochlore grains were compositionally zoned into regions of high and low Fe contents. TOF-SIMS and XPS analyses were used to analyse the surface of the compositionally zoned Fe pyrochlore grains, in order to link collector adsorption to Fe contents and identify potential mechanisms for the partitioning. Surface analyses of conditioned pyrochlore grains showing zones of high and low Fe content revealed that species indicative of the collector favour the regions with low iron. XPS analyses of similarly treated compositionally zoned pyrochlore grains showed that a greater proportion of surface oxidation species corresponded to the zones with high matrix Fe content. These results are in accord with the results identified for non zoned pyrochlore grains of variable matrix Fe content and verifies the link between pyrochlore Fe composition, surface oxidation and, area selective collector loading...|$|R
40|$|The devastating {{impact of}} marine oil {{spillage}} on shoreline highlights the urgency for remediation methods that could remove the oil contaminant. Flotation technology was utilized {{as a method}} for the separation of oil from sand via gas-liquid-solid system. The success of flotation depends on three phenomena; oil liberation, bubble-particle attachment and bubble-particle flotation. Therefore, this research aims to examine the fundamental parameters and mechanisms that could influence the integrated microbubble (≈ 90 μm) - macrobubble (≈ 1. 0 mm) flotation efficiency {{for the removal of}} bunker oil from beach sands. The study on the liberation of oil from sand was conducted through interaction studies between solid-liquid phase. It was found that an increase in temperature, pH, sand particle size and wettability led to an increase in sand detachment efficiencies due to the decrease in attachment forces between sand and oil. These results were confirmed via zeta potential data and DLVO theory. The interaction studies between liquid and gas phases were also investigated to further understand the parameters that would affect the attachment between oil and bubbles. The contact angle of bubble-oil experiment and bubble attachment visualization test demonstrated that the usage of microbubbles provided a stronger bubble-oil attachment as compared to macrobubbles. This indicates that microbubbles would preferentially attach to the oil contaminant as opposed to macrobubbles. However, while the usage of smaller bubbles would lead to better attachment on oil, the lack of lifting force limits the flotation efficiency. Therefore, the usage of an integrated micro-macrobubble system was subsequently introduced in a single flotation cell to further improve the flotation efficiency of oil contaminant. The presence of microbubbles is beneficial to enhance the macrobubble attachment process onto oil phases during the flotation process. Hence, the interaction studies between gas-gas phases were conducted by analyzing the static and dynamic bubble attachment to understand the symbiotic relationship between bubbles, as microbubbles could increase the probability of bubble-particle attachment, while macrobubbles could provide the sufficient lifting force to <b>aid</b> <b>flotation.</b> The results showed that the probability of bubble-bubble attachment was greater compared to bubble-oil attachment. This is advantageous for the application of integrated bubble flotation as the interaction between microbubbles and macrobubbles could provide a better bubble attachment with sufficient lifting force. Laboratory-scaled flotation experiments were subsequently carried out to investigate the efficiency of integrated bubble flotation as compared to single micro or macrobubble flotation. At the optimized parameter of 40 Celcius, pH 12. 5, and duration of 30 minutes, the maximum oil removal efficiency from the integrated micro-macrobubble flotation was found to be 68. 6 % for oil-wet sands, while almost all of the oil contaminants were removed from the water-wet sands. In addition, the micro-macrobubble flotation showed an increase of approximately 10 % for both oil-wet and water-wet conditions compared to the single bubble flotation. The results from the flotation studies were in good agreement with the former interaction studies. Therefore, this indicates that the integrated micro-macrobubble flotation method is a promising, simple and low energy method for the removal of bunker oil from contaminated sand...|$|R

Submarine deep-sea {{tailings}} deposition is {{an alternative}} method of the land-based mine-waste disposal, whereby mineral ore is converted into slurry and transported via a pipeline to processing plants located at the coast. The tailings are then discharged into very deep water offshore where they usually cover {{large parts of the}} sea bottom. This type of deposition is applied only in few countries: Norway, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Chile and Turkey. It is, however, a controversial method of mine tailings disposal primarily due to the hazardous chemicals used during processing and deposited metal sulfides which may dissolve and affects the sea environment. The overall objective of this project is to evaluate the copper leaching potential from tailings on the example of the proposed submarine tailings disposal in Repparfjorden discharged from two hydrothermal copper vein type deposits - Nussir and Ulveryggen, exploited by Nussir ASA. The two deposits are 5 km apart and will be processed by the same processing plant. This experiment gives better understanding of the reactivity of sulfide minerals in a saline system during submarine deposition. Planned by Nussir ASA, processing the ore by a flotation system will produce two types of flotation tailings material. These two tailings streams will be mixed with the <b>flotation</b> water, possibly <b>aided</b> by a flocculent, which will be extracted in a thickener afterwards. Seawater will then be added to the material prior to being discharged via a pipeline into the fjord that is at least 90 meters deep. Four kinetic test set-ups containing 0. 5 kg of material and 2 L of seawater were prepared for an experiment that runs for 100 days, by recirculation of the leachate (batch experiments). Seawater was routed through pipes at a constant flow rate of 1 - 2 m/h via a peristaltic pump which arose from about 4 L/h water exchange rate in the column. The columns were run at a temperature of approximately 10 °C. The seawater leachate was saturated by oxygen up to 80 - 100 % in order to maintain condition providing sulfide oxidation leaching. Nine leachate samples were collected from each column for analysis of dissolved constituents and physical parameters. Results show that there was a distinct increase in copper concentration while other hazardous elements did not show significant changes. Copper concentrations reached 0. 025 mg/L after 100 days. Towards the end of experiments (from 70 - 100 days), the leaching rate leveled off with time. Subsequent Cu concentrations indicated that there no more copper was released. Reaction was halted likely because sulfide particles have been consumed or encapsulated by iron hydroxides. The leaching reaction rate observed in this test resulted in a much lower copper contamination than previous estimates (Akvaplan-NIVA, 2011). Following the experiment results the estimated reaction rate is approximately 12. 7 mg/m 2 /year, what involves approximately 5. 75 kg/year of Cu release for proposed 2. 4 km 2 of tailings deposition area or approx. 9. 75 kg/year in 4. 0 km 2 after a year from disposal closure. This is significantly less than the annual copper discharge from a river naturally leaching deposits (500 - 600 kg/year). It was assumed that the copper is being leached only {{from the surface of the}} tailings deposit. This is primarily due the saturated condition of the sediments which prohibits oxygen supply through the deposit. Therefore available oxygen is quickly used up, thereby halting sulfide oxidation (Walder & Rzepka 2013). This research revealed that copper leaching is a two-stage process: (1) initial rapid dissolution of secondary Cu minerals formed from previous sulfide oxidation, related to the tailings material disposing period, and (2) long term slow surface-based leaching of sulfide from tailings material settled on the bottom.
