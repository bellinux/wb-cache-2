40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} {{the efficacy of}} freeze-dried amniotic membrane (AM) for reconstruction of the ocular surface in rabbit eyes. METHODS: The sterilized, freeze-dried amniotic membrane (lyophilized or FD-AM) is a preservative method that uses the <b>drying</b> <b>by</b> <b>freezing</b> process to maintain the AM well preserved {{for a long time}} even at room temperature. This paper is an experimental animal interventional study. One eye of each of 15 male New Zealand rabbits (1. 5 - 3. 0 kg) had the central cornea marked with a 6. 0 mm trephine. The marked area was deepithelialized with a No. 15 blade. The denuded corneal surface was covered as follows: Group 1 : cryopreserved AM (n= 6); Group 2 : freeze-dried AM (n= 6); and Group 3 : not covered (control group, n= 3). The AM in group 1 and 2 and the periphery of the denuded area in group 3 were secured with continuous 10 - 0 nylon sutures. The clinical evaluation was made by a blinded observer and graded on a four-point scale (1 = minimal, 4 = marked) for conjunctival and ciliary hyperemia, eyelid edema, corneal neovascularization, corneal opacity and reepithelialization on postoperative (PO) days 1, 7 and 30. After PO day 30, the rabbits were euthanized and their corneas were sent for histopathological and ultrastructural analysis to evaluate tissue inflammation, reepithelialization, and basement membrane integrity. RESULTS: Two eyes in group 2 had a corneal infection and were excluded from the analysis. No statistically significant differences among the three groups were found (p> 0. 05) regarding the clinical evaluation on 1 st, 7 th and 30 th PO days. On transmission electron microscopy, the basement membrane in lyophilized and control groups was more continuous and homogeneous than in the glycerol group. CONCLUSIONS: The freeze-drying method seems to be a good option to preserve human amniotic membrane to be used in ocular surface reconstruction. This preservative method reduces the preservation costs and may enhance the use of AM, facilitating its storage and transport. OBJETIVO: Avaliar a eficácia da liofilização da membrana amniótica (MA) para a reconstrução da superfície ocular em coelhos. MÉTODOS: A liofilização é processo de preservação que mantém a MA estável durante longo tempo mesmo em temperatura ambiente. A córnea de um olho de cada coelho macho da raça Nova Zelândia foi marcada e desepitelizada. Essa área desepitelizada foi coberta com: Grupo 1 : MA criopreservada (n= 6); Grupo 2 : MA liofilizada (n= 6) e Grupo 3 : Não coberta (n= 3). A MA nos grupos 1 e 2 e a periferia da córnea no grupo 3 foram suturadas com nylon 10 - 0. A avaliação clínica foi realizada por um observador cego em relação à hiperemia, neovascularização e edema de córnea e reepitelização nos dia 1, 7 e 30 pós-operatórios. Após o dia 30 os ratos foram eutanizados e suas córneas enviadas para análise histopatológica e ultra-estrutural. RESULTADOS: Dois olhos no grupo 2 foram excluídos da análise devido à infecção. Não foi encontrada diferença estatisticamente significante entre os grupos em relação à avaliação clínica. Na microscopia eletrônica de transmissão, a membrana basal nos grupos de MA liofilizada e controle foi mais contínua e homogênea em relação ao grupo da MA criopreservada. CONCLUSÕES: O processo de liofilização parece ser boa opção para a preservação da membrana amniótica humana para utilização na reconstrução da superfície ocular...|$|E

Various powder characteristics of the materials were determined. Stability of THC was determined and compared with freeze dried material. The powders, dispersed with an inhaler based on air classifier technology, were subjected to laser diffraction analysis and cascade impactor analysis. Highly porous particles having large specific surface areas (about go m(2) /g) were produced. At high drug loads, THC was more effectively stabilised <b>by</b> spray <b>freeze</b> <b>drying</b> than <b>by</b> <b>freeze</b> <b>drying.</b> Higher cooling rates during spray freeze drying result in improved incorporation.

40|$|Quick cooking Bengalgram, greengram, redgram and blackgram dhals were {{processed}} <b>by</b> {{cooking and}} <b>drying,</b> flaking and drying and freeze - thaw drying methods and stored at 0 degrees C and 37 degrees C in paper - aluminium foil polyethylene (PFP) laminate packs. Degradation losses in tocopherol were highest during flaking and drying process (23 - 31. 4 %), while losses were lowest (11. 2 - 15. 7 %) during cooking and drying and freeze-thaw drying methods. During storage, tocopherol degraded in all dhals but losses were highest in Bengalgram dhal and lowest in blackgram dhal. Also, {{the rate of}} degradation was faster in dhals processed <b>by</b> flaking and <b>drying</b> processes followed <b>by</b> <b>freeze</b> -thaw <b>drying</b> and cooking and drying processes. After 10 months of storage, the retention of tocopherol ranged from 28. 2 to 53. 2 % at 37 degrees C and 54. 8 to 86. 2 % at 0 degrees C in various dhals, when stored in PFP packs...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to evaluate and compare the effects of different pre-treatments of whole grape berries (freezing with dry ice or in a cold room, steam blanching with different exposure times, and microwave heating with different exposure times and microwave power density) on total content of some phenolic compounds and the composition of individual anthocyanins released into the pulp during the treatment and those extracted during the maceration step. Two red winegrape varieties with different proportions of di- and trisubstituted anthocyanins were used (Nebbiolo and Barbera, respectively). Pulpextracted anthocyanins were more significantly influenced by the pre-treatment. The results highlighted that freezing with <b>dry</b> ice, followed <b>by</b> <b>freezing</b> in a cold room and steam blanching for 5 min, have a great potential from an industrial point of view. They facilitated the extraction of anthocyanins in the must prior to maceration, {{when compared with the}} control samples, increasing their total content (+ 37. 8 - 83. 6...|$|R

40|$|Preparation of anaerobic-rod {{cellulolytic}} bacteria with coating {{technique has}} been conducted. Steps {{of the processes}} involved were cultivation, coating, evaporation, and drying. Coating agent used was Gum Arabic, and drying techniquesconducted were freeze drying and sun drying. pH of culture media was firstly optimized to obtain the maximal population ofbacteria. Both coated and uncoated preparates were subjected to drying. Morphological and Gram type identifications showed that uncoated preparate dried with freeze drying is not contaminated (ie. all bacteria are rod shape with Gram-negative type) while the one dried with sun drying is not morphologically pure (ie. containing of both rod and coccus shapes with Gram negative and positive). The coated preparates <b>dried</b> <b>by</b> both <b>freeze</b> and sun drying, were not contaminated (ie. all are rods with Gram-negative). The coating and drying processes decreased viability of preparates significantly. However, the decreasing of viability of coated preparate are lower than uncoated preparate (ie. 89 vs. 97 %). Total count of bacteria in sun-drying coated preparate are higher (P< 0. 05) than the uncoated preparate (ie. 3. 38 x 1010 vs. 1. 97 x 1010 colony/g DM). Activity of sun-drying coated preparate to digest elephant grass and rice straw was higher (P< 0. 01) than the sun-drying uncoated preparate with the in vitro DMD values were 42. 7 vs. 35. 5 % for elephant grass substrate and 29. 3 vs. 24. 6 % for rice straw substrate. Therefore, it is concluded that coating technique has a positive effects on the preparation of rumen bacteria...|$|R

40|$|SuperAbsorbent Polymers (SAPs) have, {{since being}} {{introduced}} in the 1980 s, become an important constituent in hygiene products, such as disposable diapers. The design of disposable diapers {{has changed over the}} years and today thinner products can be produced partly because of the excellent absorption and retention properties of the petrochemical-based SAPs. The possibilities of producing alternative absorbent materials from a renewable resource, kraft pulp, are investigated in this thesis. In the experimental part, kraft pulp fibres were treated with TEMPO oxidation followed by disintegration of the fibres and <b>drying</b> <b>by</b> either <b>freeze</b> <b>drying</b> or air drying. Depending on the drying method, the final product was a porous foam (freeze drying) or a compact film (air drying). In an attempt to improve the performance of the foam, un-modified fibres were added before the drying step, thus forming a cellulosic composite material. Results showed that the freeze-dried foam had a more rapid absorption rate and a higher absorption capacity in saline solution than the air-dried film. The retention capacity of the foam was favoured by a high amount of oxidant. A high amount of oxidant was also beneficial to obtaining more efficient disintegration of pulp fibres. The ease of fibre disintegration was also favoured by a high reaction temperature, as the fibres at these conditions were more chemically degraded. The aldehyde groups introduced by TEMPO oxidation provided wet integrity in the material, possibly by the formation of hemiacetal bonds during the drying step. The addition of CTMP fibres prior to the drying step had a positive effect on the retention of the TEMPO-oxidized MFC, even though the total retention capacity decreased. At fibre contents around 85 %, the retention capacities of the TEMPO-oxidized MFC were comparable with the capacity of commercial SAPs...|$|R
