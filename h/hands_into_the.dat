5|$|The video starts {{showing a}} woman {{galloping}} through a snowy forest on horseback. She enters a warehouse where a cage surrounded by crows is suspended by chains. Nearby {{there is a}} trapped short-haired woman with a flayed face and crow-like eyes. The first woman stops under the cage {{and looks up at}} it. She casts a stone against a wall that reflects her like a mirror and the building collapses. In the snow, she finds a body—the second woman, inanimate and frozen—hidden under a blanket. She closes her eyes, plunges her <b>hands</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> body and pulls out a sword. Entering the forest, she sees numerous flying crows and ends up on a snowy plain on which there are erected many scarecrows. During the refrains, she uses her sword to destroy scarecrows, rip their sails and break the wooden crosses. Scarecrows' eyes weep black blood that turns to crows. Then, it is shown how the other woman was killed: the big peaks which covered the ceiling of her cage had gradually collapsed on her. Finally, the living woman plants her sword in the snow, then disappears into the air. Farmer plays the role of both women.|$|E
25|$|Table saws are {{especially}} dangerous, because the operator holds the material being cut, {{instead of the}} saw, {{making it easy to}} accidentally move <b>hands</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> spinning blade. In contrast, with other types of circular saws, the material remains stationary, as the operator guides the saw into the material.|$|E
25|$|Since the oil industry's {{earliest}} days, {{discovery and}} production have periodically taken a human toll. For Canada's petroleum industry, the worst incident was the Ocean Ranger disaster of 1982. In that terrible tragedy the Ocean Ranger, a semi-submersible offshore rig drilling the Hibernia J-34 delineation well, {{went down in}} a winter storm. The vessel took 84 <b>hands</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> frigid sea; none survived. This memory was fresh in everyone's mind when the field's production system was being negotiated.|$|E

25|$|In {{the period}} of the 1930s through early 1960s, the evening glove was adapted for wear with certain high end {{lounging}} and sleeping outfits, or peignoir sets. Such gloves were typically made out of the same lightweight sheer nylon, rayon, or silk as of the lingerie set in a matching or complementary color and always of above elbow length. These gloves were introduced to bring the fashion for covered <b>hands</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> bedroom, protect skin during sleep and leisure time, and provide modesty for women during times of travel, visitation, or shared accommodation. While never widespread, these sleeping gloves were a desired component of the most expensive bedroom ensembles. Given the prevalence of gloves in mid-20th century women's fashion, a woman who added sleeping gloves to her wardrobe would have been gloved virtually at all times.|$|E
500|$|Bousman {{came up with}} an idea whereby a character's {{hands would}} get stuck in some sort of vessel and this {{resulted}} in the [...] "Hand Trap". It proved to be a challenge but after much discussion, Hackl, property master Jim Murray and art director Michele Brady came up with a suitable design. They arranged a glass box suspended by chains from the ceiling which contained a hypodermic needle with the antidote and which had two hand-holes on the underside. As soon as Vaugier's character Addison put her <b>hands</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> holes razor blades would close in on her hands and any attempt to withdraw from the trap would cause her to bleed to death. In order for the trap to be used safely, the prop builders made the handcuffs move inside the box and fake blades that would retract from the actress's hands, thus allowing her to slide her hands out. Hackl subsequently commented that the character did not have to put her <b>hands</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> trap as there was a lock with a key on the other side box that would have opened the contraption.|$|E
500|$|Æthelgifu was a Christian Saxon noblewoman {{who lived}} in the county in the late 980s, and her will is an {{important}} document {{for the study of the}} country as well as the county. It shows that Æthelgifu had three large estates in Hertfordshire. [...] She left much of her land to the monks of St Albans, and her will shows the importance of Hitchin as a legal and administrative centre. [...] Hitchin likely stayed in royal <b>hands</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> 10th century.|$|E

500|$|After a trial, Bonass {{signed on}} a free {{transfer}} for Hartlepools United as replacement for winger Ralph Pedwell {{who had left}} the club. The 1934–35 Football League campaign began with a visit to Walsall. After two minutes of the match, the home goalkeeper [...] "failed {{to deal with a}} centre by [...] Hird, and Bonass dashed in and headed the ball out of his <b>hands</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> net". He continued as both regular selection and regular scorer, with 23 goals from 43 matches in all competitions in his first season. His opening goal in the FA Cup first-round replay against Halifax Town created such excitement among the spectators that they broke through the barriers separating terraces from pitch.|$|E
500|$|Ancient Greeks {{typically}} attributed remarkable deaths to famous {{persons in}} keeping with their characters. [...] The date of Milo's death is unknown, but according to Strabo (VI, 1, 12) and Pausanias (VI, 14, 8), Milo was walking in a forest when he came upon a tree-trunk split with wedges. [...] In what was probably intended as a display of strength, Milo inserted his <b>hands</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> cleft to rend the tree. [...] The wedges fell from the cleft, and the tree closed upon his hands, trapping him. Unable to free himself, the wrestler was devoured by wolves. [...] A modern historian has suggested {{it is more likely}} that Milo was traveling alone when attacked by wolves. [...] Unable to escape, he was devoured and his remains found at the foot of a tree.|$|E

2500|$|Naudain's {{grandparents}} were Arnold Naudain and Catharine Allfree. The older Arnold owned {{a large amount}} of land, {{was a member of the}} legislature in 1763, and was said to have been [...] "a man of very large stature." [...] Naudain's great {{grandparents were}} Elias Naudain and Lydia LeRoux. They married in Philadelphia in 1715. He was a mariner, in Delaware by 1717, and described himself as a resident of Appoquinimink Hundred and sometimes as of St. Georges Hundred. In 1735 he acquired farmland known as the [...] "old Naudain homestead," [...] which was located near Taylor's Bridge in Appoquinimink Hundred, and which, except for the period 1816-1827, remained in his descendants' <b>hands</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> 20th Century.|$|E
2500|$|In 2010, Gérard Jean-Gilles, a 16-year-old Haitian boy who ran {{miscellaneous}} errands for the Nepalese {{soldiers in}} Cap Haitien, {{was found dead}} hanging inside of MINUSTAH’s Formed Police Unit base. UN personnel denied responsibility, claiming that the teen committed suicide. The troops released the body for autopsy seventy-two hours after the death; the examination ruled out suicide as a potential cause of death. Nepalese UN troops were also accused for other misdeeds. Several days before the Jean-Gilles incident, the local press charged a Nepalese soldier of torturing a minor in a public area in Cap-Haitien. The soldier {{was said to have}} forced “his <b>hands</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> youth’s mouth in an attempt to separate his lower jaw from his upper jaw, tearing the skin of his mouth.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The second mate's is proverbially a dog's berth. [...] He {{is neither}} officer nor man. [...] The {{men do not}} respect him as an officer, and he is obliged to go aloft to reef and furl the [...] topsails, and to put his <b>hands</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> tar and slush, with the rest. [...] The crew call him the [...] "sailor's waiter," [...] as he has to furnish them with spun-yarn, marline, and all other stuffs that they need in their work, and has charge of the boatswain's locker, which {{includes}} serving-boards, marline-spikes, etc. [...] He is expected by the captain to maintain his dignity and to enforce obedience, and still is kept at a great distance from the mate, and obliged {{to work with the}} crew. [...] He is one to whom little is given and of whom much is required. [...] His wages are usually double those of a common sailor, and he eats and sleeps in the cabin; but he is obliged to be on deck nearly all the time, and eats at the second table, that is, makes a meal out of what the captain and chief mate leave.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{example of}} gorillas' {{significant}} intelligence is {{their ability to}} comprehend simple sign language. In the mid-1970s, researchers {{turned their attention to}} communicating with gorillas via sign language. One gorilla, Koko, was born in San Francisco Zoo on July 4, 1971. A woman named Francine Patterson officially started working with Koko on July 12, 1972, with the goal of teaching her sign language. In the beginning, Dr. Petterson focused on teaching Koko only three basic signs: [...] "food," [...] "drink," [...] and [...] "more." [...] Koko would learn signs through observation, Dr. Patterson, or one of her colleagues by molding Koko's <b>hands</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> correct sign. On August 7, Patterson began a more formal routine of teaching Koko the signs, [...] "food," [...] "drink," [...] and [...] "more." [...] In the couple weeks before that, Koko had been using gestures that seemed like attempts at the signs taught, but were deemed as coincidental and random and not intended for the actual purpose. Only two days after they started the more formal routine, Koko started responding consistently with the sign [...] "food" [...] when prompted to. Within the first three months, Koko made 16 different combinations of signs and was also starting to form simple questions by using eye contact and different positioning of signs by the body. Koko mastered more than 1,000 signs and was said to be able to connect up to 8 words together to form a statement expressing wants, needs, thoughts, or simple responses. Today, Koko resides at The Gorilla Foundation in Woodside, California.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{residence}} was built around 1910. [...] It {{is located at}} the north end of the ranch compound, facing south.
