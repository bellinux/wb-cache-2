50|$|The 2011 Oklahoma {{earthquake}} near Prague, {{of magnitude}} 5.8, occurred after 20 years <b>of</b> <b>injecting</b> <b>waste</b> water into porous deep formations at increasing pressures and saturation. On September 3, 2016, {{an even stronger}} earthquake with a magnitude of 5.8 occurred near Pawnee, Oklahoma, followed by nine aftershocks between magnitudes 2.6 and 3.6 within 3 1/2 hours. Tremors were felt {{as far away as}} Memphis, Tennessee, and Gilbert, Arizona. Mary Fallin, the Oklahoma governor, declared a local emergency and shutdown orders for local disposal wells were ordered by the Oklahoma Corporation Commission. Results of ongoing multi-year research on induced earthquakes by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) published in 2015 suggested that most of the significant earthquakes in Oklahoma, such as the 1952 magnitude 5.5 El Reno earthquake may have been induced by deep injection <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> water by the oil industry. Prior to April 2015 however, the Oklahoma Geological Survey's position was that the quake was most likely due to natural causes and was not triggered by waste injection. This was one of many earthquakes which have affected the Oklahoma region.|$|R

40|$|Construction {{industry}} contributes a {{large portion}} <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> to landfill, which in turns results in environmental pollution and CO 2 emission. Despite the adoption <b>of</b> several <b>waste</b> management strategies, waste reduction to landfill continues seeming an insurmountable challenge. This paper explores factors impeding the effectiveness <b>of</b> existing <b>waste</b> management strategies, as well as strategies for reducing <b>waste</b> intensiveness <b>of</b> the construction industry. Drawing on series of semi structured focus group discussions with experts from the UK leading construction companies, this paper combines phenomenological approach with a critical review and analysis of extant literatures. Five broad categories of factors and practices are responsible for ineffectiveness of construction and demolition waste management strategies, which subsequently results in <b>waste</b> intensiveness <b>of</b> the industry. These include end of pipe treatment <b>of</b> <b>waste,</b> externality and incompatibility <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> management tools with design tools, atomism <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> management strategies, perceived or unexpected high cost <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> management, and culture <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> behaviour within the industry. To reduce <b>waste</b> intensiveness <b>of</b> the construction industry, the study suggests that six factors are requisites. These are tackling <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> at design stage, whole life <b>waste</b> consideration, compliance <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> management solutions with BIM, cheaper cost <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> management practice, increased stringency <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> management legislation and fiscal policies, and research and enlightenment. The proposed strategies are not only important for achieving low waste construction projects, they are important for reducing <b>waste</b> intensiveness <b>of</b> the construction. Implementation of the suggested measures would drive waste management practices within the construction industry...|$|R
