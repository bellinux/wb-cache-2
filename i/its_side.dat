Combining CYP3A4 inhibitors such as cimetidine, erythromycin, norfluoxetine, fluvoxamine, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, propoxyphene, and ritonavir delay the hepatic clearance of alprazolam, which {{may result in}} its accumulation and increased severity of <b>its</b> <b>side</b> effects.|$|E

5|$|After September 1939, desperate {{efforts were}} made to improve the situation, but with very little result. Germany, for obvious reasons, delayed its deliveries; France was {{hesitant}} to equip an army that would not unequivocally take <b>its</b> <b>side.</b> The one abundant source of readily available weaponry, the Soviet Union, was inaccessible because the Dutch, contrary to most other nations, did not recognise the communist regime. An attempt in 1940 to procure Soviet armour captured by Finland failed.|$|E
5|$|Brawl also {{features}} compatibility with four kinds of controllers (the Wii Remote on <b>its</b> <b>side,</b> the Wii Remote and Nunchuk combination, the Classic Controller, and the GameCube controller), while its predecessors only used the one controller designed for that system.

5|$|In {{alternative}} fashion, the (S) and (R) designators {{are used}} to indicate the absolute stereochemistry. Almost all of the amino acids in proteins are (S) at the α carbon, with cysteine being (R) and glycine non-chiral. Cysteine has <b>its</b> <b>side</b> chain in the same geometric position as the other amino acids, but the R/S terminology is reversed because of the higher atomic number of sulfur compared to the carboxyl oxygen gives the side chain a higher priority, whereas the atoms in most other side chains give them lower priority.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} and months after {{conclusion}} of the Inquiry one possible explanation of the crash began to circulate among employees of ANA. This possibility began with one piece of evidence uncovered by the Inquiry during cross-examination of ANA's ground staff. It was reported that after sunrise the morning after the crash the one-gallon container used to check Amana's fuel filters was found empty and lying on <b>its</b> <b>side</b> on the apron a short distance from where Amana had been parked. The Inquiry attached no significance to this evidence and did not explore it further.|$|E

The shuttle could orbit in altitudes of 185–643km (115–400 miles) and carry a maximum payload (to low orbit) of 24,400kg (54,000lb). Missions could last from 5 to 17 days and crews could be from 2 to 8 astronauts.|$|E

The Wreck fell over inside the trailer, causing damage to <b>its</b> <b>side</b> and roof.

5|$|Relations {{between the}} two largest groups, Macedonians and Albanians, are {{sometimes}} difficult, as {{in the rest of}} the country. Each group tolerate the other but they tend to avoid each other and live in what can appear as two parallel worlds. The Roma minority is on <b>its</b> <b>side</b> very deprived. Its exact size is not known because many Macedonian Roma declare themselves as belonging to other ethnic groups or simply avoid censuses. However, even if official figures are underestimated, Skopje is the city in the world with the largest Roma population.|$|E
5|$|The Broadway Hollywood Building (sometimes Broadway Building or Broadway Department Store Building) is a {{building}} in Los Angeles' Hollywood district. The building is situated in the Hollywood Walk of Fame monument area on {{the southwest corner of}} the intersection referred to as Hollywood and Vine, marking the intersection of Hollywood Boulevard and Vine Street. It was originally built as the B. H. Dyas Building in 1927.

5|$|The Korean Peninsula {{had been}} divided between {{occupation}} {{forces of the}} United States and the Soviet Union {{since the end of}} World War II along the 38th Parallel.

These culminated in open warfare with the North's invasion of the South on June 25. During this time, the United Nations backed South Korea and considered it the only lawful government.|$|E

5|$|The Temple of Baalshamin {{dates to}} the late 2nd century BC in its {{earliest}} phases; its altar was built in AD 115, and it was substantially rebuilt in AD 131.

A vestibule consisting of six columns preceded the cella which had <b>its</b> <b>side</b> walls decorated with pilasters in Corinthian order.|$|E
5|$|The church's {{appearance}} in the mid-16th century, shortly before its completion, is known from a woodcut by Girolamo Franzini. Its facade appears almost square; at its center there was a portal with a tympanum, surmounted by a large fanlight opened by a round window. On <b>its</b> <b>side</b> were three rows of pilasters with two pairs of niches, one over the other. A bell-gable was {{on one side of}} the roof.|$|E
5|$|The church, {{without an}} apse and a transept, {{maintained}} its original single-nave plan {{until at least}} 1627. In 1662 the naves had become three, separated by two rows of square brick pillars and surmounted by vaults. The church had five altars in 1627, increasing to six in 1649. In 1726 the closing of <b>its</b> <b>side</b> gate along the Borgo Vecchio made room for another altar.|$|E
