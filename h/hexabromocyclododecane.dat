30|$|To {{improve the}} {{detection}} of potential EA-EDs, we identified more structural alerts by systematic inspections of the chemical structures of substances with endocrine activity, for example, brominated diphenyl ethers (BDEs) and <b>hexabromocyclododecanes</b> (HBCDDs) that are antagonists in EA receptor-binding assays [22]. Furthermore, we looked for possible refinements of established structural alerts.

Concentrations of PBDEs and HBCDs in sediments varied widely depending on sampling locations, ranging from 0. 15 – 130 ng/g dry wt. and 1 showing higher concentrations of certain PBDEs (BDE- 28,- 47,- 99,- 100,- 153,- 154) and α-HBCD in mussels and fishes than those in sediments. These results indicate that these compounds are highly transferrable and bioavailable to biota.

40|$|In this chapter, {{we present}} {{evidence}} that the environmental behavior of brominated flame retardants (BFRs) {{is similar to the}} behavior of persistent organic pollutants: BFRs are persistent, bioaccumulate, and biomagnify in the aquatic and terrestrial food chains.

Both, classical BFRs, such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers or <b>hexabromocyclododecanes,</b> and "novel" BFRs are included in this chapter. We have also reviewed the information on the degradation pathways of BFRs and their transformation products. Debromination of BFRs was the dominant degradation pathway in abiotic media (such as soil, sediment, dust, or solvent), while main degradation pathways of BFRs in biota include reductive debromination and phase I oxidative metabolism.

40|$|A {{method for}} the {{selective}} separation of polychlorinated naphthalene (PCNs), <b>hexabromocyclododecanes</b> (HBCDs) and tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) in complex matrices was developed. In the present study, {{the type of}} sorbents and the volume and composition of eluting solvents were investigated in detail.

To investigate the feasibility of the developed method, it was applied to isolate target compounds from spiked soil extracts. PCNs, HBCDs and TBBPA could be subsequently eluted with hexane, hexane/dichloromethane (1 : 1), and hexane/dichloromethane (1 : 3), and the recoveries of the analysts from three fractions were satisfactory (70. 9 %- 107 %) {{with the exception of}} gamma-HBCD at low levels.

50|$|The {{tests on}} the fire {{behaviour}} of materials with different flame retardants revealed that halogen free flame retardants produce less smoke and toxic fire emissions, {{with the exception of}} the aryl phosphates RDP and BDP in styrenic polymers. The leaching experiments showed that the nature of the polymer is a dominating factor and that the leaching behaviour of halogen free and brominated flame retardants is comparable. The more porous or “hydrophilic” a polymers is the more flame retardants can be released. However, moulded plates which represent real world plastic products showed much lower leaching levels than extruded polymer granules. The impact assessment studies reconfirmed that the improper waste and recycling treatment of electronic products with brominated flame retardants can produce dioxins which is not the case with halogen free alternatives. Furthermore, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US-EPA) has been carrying out a series of projects related to the environmental assessment of alternative flame retardants, the “design for environment” projects on flame retardants for printed wiring boards and alternatives to decabromo diphenylethers and <b>hexabromocyclododecane</b> (HBCD).|$|E

40|$|Brominated {{flame retardants}} (BFRs) are {{ubiquitous}} in indoor air and dust, leading to human exposure and resultant concerns about adverse impact on health. Despite elevated concentrations in dust, {{little is known}} about how BFRs transfer to dust from treated products. A test chamber was constructed to investigate pathways via which the polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and <b>hexabromocyclododecanes</b> (HBCDs) migrate from source materials to indoor dust. These were: (1) BFRs volatilise and subsequently partition to dust, (2) particles or fibres of the source abrade, transfering to dust directly (3) direct source-dust contact results in transfer. A HBCD treated textile curtain, and a PBDE TV casing were both tested. Partitioning post volatilisation was a less effective mechanism than abrasion. Direct source-dust contact resulted in effective and rapid transfer. A forensic microscopy investigation on ‘real world’ dust of elevated BFR content identified polymer particles containing BDE- 209, likely originating from a BFR treated polymeric material indicating abrasion. An invitro extraction test investigated the bioaccessibility of dust contaminated via pathways (1) and (2). Results indicate bioaccessibility may be less efficient from samples containing elevated concentrations of BFRs, and from dusts contaminated primarily via abrasion.
