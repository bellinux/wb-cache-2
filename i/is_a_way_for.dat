25|$|Collaboration {{is a way}} to get {{everyone}} involved in the group by assigning each member special, meaningful tasks. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> the group members to share the knowledge and the tasks to be fulfilled unfailingly. For example, if Sally and Paul were loafing because they were not given specific tasks, then giving Paul the note taker duty and Sally the brainstorming duty will make them feel essential to the group. Sally and Paul will be less likely to want to let the group down, because they have specific obligations to complete.|$|E
25|$|However, Haufniensis {{mentions}} that anxiety <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> humanity {{to be saved}} as well. Anxiety informs us of our choices, our self-awareness and personal responsibility, and brings us from a state of un-self-conscious immediacy to self-conscious reflection. (Jean-Paul Sartre calls these terms pre-reflexive consciousness and reflexive consciousness.) An individual becomes truly aware of their potential through the experience of dread. So, anxiety may be a possibility for sin, but anxiety {{can also be a}} recognition or realization of one's true identity and freedoms.|$|E

The namesake, Dr. Paul Ambrose, was a promising young physician who was killed at the Pentagon in {{the terrorist attacks on}} September 11, 2001. Dr. Ambrose was dedicated to family health and preventative medicine to fight obesity and the trail system <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> his efforts to continue to have an impact in Huntington.|$|E
25|$|The Artistic Freedom Voucher (AFV) {{introduced}} by Dean Baker <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> consumers to support “creative and artistic work.” In this system, each consumer {{would have a}} refundable tax credit of $100 to give to any artist of creative work. To restrict fraud, the artists must register with the government. The voucher prohibits any artist that receives the benefits from copyrighting their material for a certain length of time. Consumers can obtain music for {{a certain amount of}} time easily and the consumer decides which artists receive the $100. The money can either be given to one artist or to many, the distribution is up to the consumer.|$|E

The Sustainability Tracking, Assessment and Rating System (STARS), created by AASHE, was designed to provide guidelines for better understanding of sustainability and build a more sustainable community throughout university campuses. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> universities and colleges to measure their sustainability efforts. The program compares higher education facilities’ sustainability initiatives and ranks them based on their efforts. In 2011, the University of Ottawa received a silver star by the STARS program.|$|E

25|$|In {{basically}} {{all major}} primate taxa, aggression {{is used by}} the dominant males when herding females and keeping them away from other males. In hamadryas baboons, the males often bite the females’ necks and threaten them. Wild chimpanzees can charge at females, shake branches, hit, slap, kick, pound, drag, and bite them. Orangutans are among the most forceful of mammals. Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) exhibited aggression in almost 90 percent of their copulations, including when the females were not resisting. A possible explanation for aggressive behaviors in primates is that it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> males to train females to be afraid of them and be more likely to surrender to future sexual advances.|$|E
25|$|Externally focused theories, in contrast, {{suggest that}} reunion <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> adoptees to {{overcome}} social stigma. First proposed by Goffman, the theory has four parts: 1) adoptees perceive {{the absence of}} biological ties as distinguishing their adoptive family from others, 2) this understanding is strengthened by experiences where non-adoptees suggest adoptive ties are weaker than blood ties, 3) together, these factors engender, in some adoptees, a sense of social exclusion, and 4) these adoptees react by searching for a blood tie that reinforces their membership in the community. The externally focused rationale for reunion suggests adoptees may be well adjusted and happy within their adoptive families, but will search {{as an attempt to}} resolve experiences of social stigma.|$|E
25|$|Presence of {{long-lasting}} {{bonds between}} parents and young seen in the family of this species is another attribute of obligate monogamy. Both sexes of the rock-haunting ringtail possum showed substantial long-term care of offspring. An unusual interaction observed {{between parents and}} young were the embrace by adult males and the bridge formation. Both sexes embrace young, whereas only females engage in bridge formation. The mother allows her young to move from branch to branch by using her body as a bridge. This has never been seen in another possum. Embracing <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> the adults to know the stage of maturation of the offspring. A third feature of obligate monogamy shown by the Rock-haunting Ringtail Possum is the rearing of younger siblings by juveniles.|$|E

He agrees to the marriage, but discovers that the paparazzi are waiting outside to take his picture. Albert then realizes that there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> the family to escape without being recognized: he dresses Kevin and Louise in drag, and they use the apartment's back entrance to sneak into The Birdcage, with Armand introducing them {{as a part of}} the club's nightly act. They all dance out of the nightclub door and reach safety, preventing a disaster. Barbara and Val are married in an interfaith service, which both families attend.|$|E
25|$|Rosebud pornography, rosebudding or rectal {{prolapse}} pornography {{refers to an}} anal sex practice which occurs in some extreme anal pornography wherein a pornograhic actor or actress performs a {{rectal prolapse}} wherein {{the walls of the}} rectum slip out of the anus. A rectal prolapse is a serious medical condition that requires the attention of a medical professional. However, in rosebud pornography it is performed deliberately. Michelle Lhooq, writing for VICE, argues that rosebudding is an example of producers making 'extreme' content due to the easy availability of free pornography on the internet. She also argues that rosebudding <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> pornographic actors and actresses to distinguish themselves. Repeated rectal prolapses can cause bowel problems and anal leakage and therefore risk the health of pornographic actors or actresses who participate in them. Lhooq also argues that some who participate in this form of pornography are unaware of the consequences.|$|E
25|$|Looking {{back at the}} {{different}} causes of pica related to assessment, the clinician will try to develop a treatment. First, there is pica {{as a result of}} social attention. A strategy might be used of ignoring the person’s behavior or giving them the least possible attention. If their pica is a result of obtaining a favorite item, a strategy may be used where the person is able to receive the item or activity without eating inedible items. The individual’s communication skills should increase so that they can relate what they want to another person without engaging in this behavior. If pica <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>for</b> a person to escape an activity or situation, the reason why the person wants to escape the activity should be examined and the person should be moved to a new situation. If pica is motivated by sensory feedback, an alternative method of feeling that sensation should be provided. Other non-medication techniques might include other ways for oral stimulation such as gum. Foods such as popcorn have also been found helpful. These things can be placed in a “Pica Box” that should be easily accessible to the individual when they feel like engaging in pica.|$|E
