This would lead to desirable tradeoff between network performance and control signaling overhead and provide more satisfactory end-to-end QoS performance for mobile users. Furthermore, the wireless access network may conduct various control functions which are based on highly dynamic system information such as wireless CSI in a semi-distributed manner using local controllers (e.g., employed at the BSs). Then, a well-designed network management framework can be developed so that these local controllers can efficiently interact with a centralized SDN controller, which makes more large-scale control decisions. For example, the CSI-driven wireless scheduling and radio resource management functions can be taken care by local controllers while load balancing and mobility control decisions can be realized by a centralized controller.|$|E
