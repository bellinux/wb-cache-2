The mineral foam product will be used as a partial load-bearing insulating material, so a minimum compressive strength of 2 MPa is required, and a 0. 2 W/(m.

The mix-then-foam process is then applied before the setting of the mineral matrix. Mineral pastes are realized with a small water to binder weight ratio, leading to highly concentrated suspensions. Some superplasticizer is added to obtain a sufficient flowability. As calcium sulfate quickly reacts, a retarder is added to master the setting time. Previous experiments reveal that the presence of a <b>foaming</b> <b>agent</b> is compulsory to maintain foam stability until setting by changing of the surface tension of the fluid. Five different molecules have been tested. In order to characterize the <b>foaming</b> <b>agents,</b> critical micelle concentration (CMC) tests are performed. <b>Foaming</b> <b>agent</b> can be divided in two groups, one with CMC between 900 and 1320 mg/l and intermediate surface tension from 34 to 38 mN/m, the other contains <b>foaming</b> <b>agents</b> with various behaviors.

The basic feature of the roll on/off firefighting container vehicles distinguishing them from the standard firefighting vehicles is their mobile superstructure, which, according to its design and construction, is in short called ‘a container’. Therefore, the firefighting vehicle of this type basically includes a standard constructed truck chassis adequate capacity with loader crane for containers and a firefighter container. In relation to buyer’s demands, the container may incorporate different firefighting technical details, devices and equipment, thus determining each container’s technical and functional characteristics. Hence, depending on the equipment, roll on/off container vehicles {{may be used for}} both technical and firefighting interventions. Furthermore, the advantage of the roll on/off container vehicles over the standard firefighting vehicles is the chassis which can support a container of any type and purpose, so any firefighting intervention can be performed with only one chassis and several different containers.

Bearing in mind special technical characteristics, the container of this vehicle includes fire techniques and equipment of higher technical quality than in most standard firefighting vehicles. Thus, there is strong Caterpillar diesel drive motor, designed for eternally operation, integrated in a separate, sound-insulated space of the container’s superstructure. This motor drives the KSB centrifugal pump flow 22. 500 l/min as well as the Edwards gear pump for <b>foam</b> <b>agent.</b> <b>Foam</b> <b>agent</b> dosage rate is proportional within the fixed water flow rate. Pipeline system is similar in design to the most firefighting vehicles and is equipped with ‘storz’ coupling adapters with female thread at the user endings. The coupling adapters are closed with sealed cap. Water/foam monitor of a special manufacturer Williams Ambasador is of high range and stream water and foam capacity. The article presents the construction and design of roll on/off container vehicles for water and foam fire extinguishing in refining plants, which is designed by manufacturer ZIEGLER d. o. o. Croatia, Zagreb in cooperation with company TOTAL. At the moment of the release of this article, the container with monitor and other containers with <b>foam</b> <b>agent</b> tank are in finally phase of construction and are in start production. The vehicles are being constructed for TOTAL company from Netherlands, and will be delivered under the name as Roll on/off extinguishing container with monitor (SBH Unit) and Roll on/off foam container (SVH Unit). The entire design and construction of the vehicle with all technical characteristics are owned by ZIEGLER d. o. o. The author of the article presented the above mentioned firefighting vehicle {{for the sole purpose of}} introducing the operational technical characteristics and application of the roll on/off container vehicles in firefighting.

40|$|Concrete, {{the most}} common {{construction}} material, has negligible tension capacity. However, a reinforcement material such as natural fibers, {{can be used to}} improve the tensile properties of concrete. This paper presents experiments conducted on Super Lightweight Concrete mixed with coconut fibers (SLNFRC). Coconut fibers are {{regarded as one of the}} toughest natural fibers to strengthen concrete. Coconut fiber reinforced composites have been considered as a sustainable construction material because the fibers are derived from waste. These wastes, which are available in large quantities in Asia, have to be extracted from the husk of coconut fruits and must pass a mechanical process before being added to a concrete mixture. The Super Lightweight Concrete was made by mixing concrete paste with <b>foam</b> <b>agent</b> that can reduce the overall weight of concrete up to 60 % with compressive strength up to 6 MPa. The Super Lightweight Concrete is intended to be used for non-structural walls, as alternative conventional construction materials such as brick walls. The influence of coconut fibers content in increasing the flexural tensile strength of Super Lightweight Concrete was studied in this research. The fiber content studied include 0 %, 0. 1 %, 0. 175 %, and 0. 25 % by weight of cement content. Sixteen specimens of SLNFRC mini beams of 60 mm x 60 mm x 300 mm were tested to failure to investigate their flexural strengths. The optimum percent fibers yielding higher tensile strength was found to be 0. 175...|$|E

The mixture of the recycling material and the <b>foaming</b> <b>agent</b> are compacted to a foamable starting material. The recycling material is adjusted to a defined size in a grinding process before mixing. The production wastes of a cutting dry machining are used as chips for mixing with the <b>foaming</b> <b>agent.</b> During the preparation process of the recycling material, the <b>foaming</b> <b>agent</b> homogenously distributed with the recycling material is grinded. The mixture is heated on a temperature above a decomposition temperature of the <b>foaming</b> <b>agent</b> that lies in the temperature range of the melting point of the used the metal or alloys and {{in such a manner}} that the foam body is subsequently cooled-off. The foaming is carried out in a foam form/a component. USE - Useful in the aviation- and aerospace technology as lightweight structures and also in the automobile- and machine construction. ADVANTAGE - The production of the metal foam bodies is economical. The pollution of the produced porous metal bodies is avoided by removing the pollution of the chips as production wastes...|$|R
40|$|Structural {{lightweight}} concrete (SLWC) has superior {{properties that}} allow the optimization of super tall structure systems for the process of design. Because of the limited supply of lightweight aggregates in Korea, the development of structural lightweight concrete without lightweight aggregates is needed. The physical and mechanical properties of specimens that were cast using normal coarse aggregates and different mixing ratios of <b>foaming</b> <b>agent</b> to evaluate the possibility of creating structural lightweight concrete were investigated. The {{results show that the}} density of SLWC decreases as the dosage of <b>foaming</b> <b>agent</b> increases up to a dosage of 0. 6 %, as observed by SEM. It was also observed that the <b>foaming</b> <b>agent</b> induced well separated pores, and that the size of the pores ranged from 50 to 100 μm. Based on the porosity of concrete specimens with <b>foaming</b> <b>agent,</b> compressive strength values of structural lightweight foam concrete (SLWFC) were obtained. It was also found that the estimated values from proposed equations for compressive strength and modulus of elasticity of SLWFC, and values obtained by actual measurements were in good agreement. Thus, this study confirms that new structural lightweight concrete using normal coarse aggregates and <b>foaming</b> <b>agent</b> can be developed successfully...|$|R
