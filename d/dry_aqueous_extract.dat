Epimedii herba (Yinyanghuo, Horny Goat Weed or Barrenwort) {{is one of the}} best known and most frequently used plants in Chinese medicine for its tonic, anti-reumatic and aphrodisiacal effects. The main content substances are flavonoids, alkaloids, lignans and terpenic compounds. Flavonoids, ikariin, epimedin A, epimedin B, epimedin C and ikaritin, have diverse effects such as antioxidant, estrogenic, osteogenic, antidepressant-like, antianginal and anticancerogenic. To demonstrate the antioxidant activities of methanolic extract and <b>dry</b> <b>aqueous</b> <b>extract</b> from herba Epimedium x rubrum, I used two methods, the method of measuring antioxidant activity against the stable radical DPPH (diphenylhydrazyl) and method of measuring antioxidant activity against superoxide.

The possible prevention or elimination of gallstones by ethanolic and aqueous extracts of the leaves and twigs of L. tridentata was tested in hamsters fed a rich carbohydrate, fat-free diet. In addition, the effects of the ethanolic extract and its main metabolite, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, on bile secretion in the perfused liver were tested. In the experiment on prevention of gallstones, the dry ethanolic extract at a level of 0. 5 % of diet completely inhibited gallstone formation, lowered biliary moles percent cholesterol and increased the proportion of chenodeoxycholic acid of hepatic bile. The <b>dry</b> <b>aqueous</b> <b>extract</b> at a level of 1 % of diet did not affect gallstone frequency or biliary parameters.

40|$|Magister Pharmaceuticae - MPharmSutherlandia frutescens is a {{traditional}} plant medicine widely used in South Africa. Traditionally, the leaves of S. frutescens are mainly used as a tea, but these traditional dosage forms have several disadvantages, including {{that they are not}} particularly convenient to prepare and store, encourage dosage inaccuracy and are highly susceptible to microbial contamination. To solve these problems, <b>dried</b> <b>aqueous</b> <b>extract</b> forms, e. g. freeze <b>dried</b> <b>aqueous</b> <b>extract</b> (FDAE) of S. frutescens were prepared, but they, in turn, may still suffer from instability and contain mainly hydrophilic phytoconstituents that are poorly absorbed and delivered for in vivo activity. Modified forms of the FDAE, i. e. the active phytopharmaceutical ingredient (API), may be a better solution. Therefore this study sought to prepare liposomes and phytosomes of the freeze <b>dried</b> <b>aqueous</b> <b>extract</b> of Sutherlandia frutescens, as a means of increasing the total the surface area of the API, thus improving its release and dissolution in gastrointestinal fluids. Liposomes and phytosomes of the FDAE of Sutherlandia frutescens obtained were prepared using a thin film hydration method at ratios of lecithin: S. frutescens (3 : 1) and phosphatidylcholine: S. frutescens (2 : 1) respectively. The physical characteristics (i. e. particle size, size distribution, zeta potential, and morphology), of flavonoid glycosides (i. e. sutherlandins A to D; API) as well as content and release profiles of each dosage form (i. e. FDAE liposome or phytosomes) at pH 1. 2 and pH 6. 8 was determined. A validated HPLC assay was used to determine and compare the flavonoid glycoside content and release profiles of the liposomes and phytosomes. Both liposomes and phytosomes were successfully prepared, in moderate yields (± 30 %, and ± 50 %, respectively), using the thin film hydration method. The liposomes had a significantly smaller size, lower size distribution, higher zeta potential and better stability than the phytosomes (p < 0. 05). The phytosomes, however, had significantly higher flavonoid glycoside encapsulation efficiency than the liposomes (± 50 % vs ± 26 %; p < 0. 01). In addition, the release at 120 minutes, of flavonoid glycosides from the liposomes (63 %, 58 %, 76 % and 46 % % at pH 1. 2, and 78 %, 76 %, 87 % and 89 % at pH 6. 8 for sutherlandins A, B, C and D, respectively) was significantly higher and faster than that of the phytosomes (52 %, 41 %, 51 % and 39 % at pH 1. 2, and 31 % 31 %, 33 %and 45 % % at pH 6. 8, for sutherlandins A, B, C and D, respectively). The differences in release were likely due to differences in particle size and size distribution of the two modified API forms. Overall, liposomes and phytosomes can be considered promising vehicles for delayed delivery of herbal crude extracts. Based on its characteristics (i. e. narrower size distribution, and better stability), the liposomes were preferred compared to the phytosomes offering a better kinetic release profile. The phytosomes had higher encapsulation than the liposomes that may be due to complex formation between the API and the lipid...|$|R

40|$|Magister Pharmaceuticae - MPharmArtemisia afra (A. afra) is {{traditionally}} {{used for a}} variety of ailments and contain flavonoids e. g. luteolin which may contribute to some of its activity. It is generally administered as a tea or decoction, and such liquid dosage forms present challenges as far as long term storage and stability are concerned, as well as sub-optimal oral bioavailability of actives they contain. Freeze <b>dried</b> <b>aqueous</b> <b>extracts</b> (FDAE) can alleviate such problems but may be hygroscopic and unstable. The use of modified forms of FDAE can counter the problem of hygroscopicity (e. g. use of alginate) and alleviate the issue of sub-optimal bioavailability of plant actives (e. g. polymethylmethacrylate). The objectives of this study, were to: (1) prepare the freeze <b>dried</b> <b>aqueous</b> <b>extract</b> (FDAE) and modified forms, which include alginate-extract beads (alginate-FDAE) and polymethylmethacrylate coated alginate matrix beads of herbal extract (PMMA-alginate-FDAE) of the FDAE of A. afra, (2) determine and compare the pharmaceutical characteristics of the above mentioned preparations of A. afra,(3) quantify and compare the total flavonoid and specifically luteolin levels of the different forms of A. afra,(4) evaluate and compare the release characteristics of FDAE of A. afra from the alginate-FDAE and PMMA-alginate-FDAE beads in gastrointestinal fluids and (5) determine the intestinal permeability of luteolin contained in selected modified Artemisia afra extract preparations. It was hypothesized that making the alginate beads and the polymethylmethacrylate coated alginate beads would make the FDAE less hygroscopic with a lower moisture content, that the rate of release of luteolin from A. afra FDAE into gastrointestinal fluids would be faster than from the modified forms, and that the effective gastrointestinal permeability of luteolin in the alginate-FDAE and PMMA-alginate-FDAE beads of A. afra is equal to that in FDAE. To realize these objectives, the FDAE was prepared by freeze <b>drying</b> the <b>aqueous</b> <b>extract</b> of the A. afra dried leaves, alginate-FDAE prepared by dispersing FDAE into 4 % sodium alginate solution, then adding the resulting stock solution into a 2 % calcium chloride solution and drying resulting beads and PMMA-alginate-FDAE prepared by a modified water-in-oil-in-water emulsion solvent evaporation method using water as an internal aqueous phase. Using pharmacopoeial methods and methods adapted from other workers the organoleptic and pharmaceutical characteristics were determined to compare the pharmaceutical quality of these preparations of A. afra. To identify and determine the levels of luteolin in the plant preparations, a validated HPLC assay was developed. Finally, the in situ perfused rat intestine model was used to determine the in vitro bioavailability, i. e. gastrointestinal permeability, of luteolin from solutions containing luteolin in pure form, FDAE, alginate-FDAE and PMMA-alginate-FDAE. The A. afra forms were obtained in moderate to good yields and FDAE was brown and hygroscopic in nature, the alginate beads dark brown free flowing and spherical in shape and the PMMA-alginate beads light brown in colour with rough edges. The A. afra plant forms on average contained 0. 185 ± 0. 24, 0. 067 ± 0. 014, 0. 012 ± 0. 071 μg/mg of free luteolin (n= 3) in FDAE, alginate-FDAE and PMMA-alginate-FDAE respectively and 0. 235 ± 0. 026, 0. 079 ± 0. 093, 0. 058 ± 0. 082 μg/mg of total luteolin (n= 3) in FDAE, alginate-FDAE and PMMAalginate- FDAE respectively. The Plumen values for intestinal uptake of luteolin were significantly higher from solutions of A. afra forms than the pure luteolin solution (i. e. Plumen values in the range of 0. 02 - 0. 035 cm/s for all plant forms vs Plumen values in the range of 0. 010 - 0. 014 cm/s for pure luteolin, t-test p = 0. 0252). The permeability of luteolin in FDAE appeared to be slighter greater than that of the modified forms (Plumen values > 0. 03 cm/s for FDAE and Plumen values < 0. 03 cm/s for both modified forms). In summary, the results showed that, the modified A. afra forms; alginate-FDAE and PMMAalginate- FDAE were of acceptable pharmaceutical quality with luteolin better taken up in the plant forms than in its pure form. The A. afra forms prepared had similar rates of uptake (permeability) of free and total luteolin with the rates being highest for the FDAE. Collectively, these results indicate that alginate-FDAE and PMMA-alginate-FDAE bead forms should be suitable for use in a solid dosage form (e. g. tablet or capsule) of A. afra...|$|R

Stachyose and verbascoside were demonstrated for their first time to exhibit significant stimulatory effects on fibroblast proliferation. However, the proliferating effect of dried RR extract did not correlate with the stachyose content, and verbascoside was {{not responsible for the}} fibroblast proliferative effect of RR since it was undetectable in all samples. In conclusion, stachyose only contributed in part to the activity of RR, suggesting that other active components might be present and yet to be found...|$|R

40|$|Equilibrium {{moisture}} sorptions of two <b>dried</b> <b>aqueous</b> herbal <b>extracts</b> {{and their}} mixtures with dextrans of various molecular weights were investigated {{as a function}} of relative humidity at ambient temperature, and the data were analyzed by both the Guggenheim-Anderson-deBoer (GAB) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) equations. Glass transition temperatures (T(g)) of the samples were measured by differential scanning calorimetry, and their dependence on the moisture contents of the extracts was analyzed by the linear, Fox and expanded Gordon-Taylor mathematical models. All dextran-extract mixtures exhibited single T(g) values, indicating that they existed as single homogeneous phases. The BET equation was found adequate for description of the moisture sorption isotherms for all samples. The dextrans appeared to reduce the hygroscopicity of the herbal extracts solely by a dilution effect. The observed increase in T(g) and accompanying decrease in tackiness of the herbal extracts in the presence of dextrans may be explained by the ability of dextrans to restrict the molecular mobility of simple sugars and to counteract the plasticizing effect of water in the extracts. The expanded Gordon-Taylor equation has proved useful in predicting the T(g) of hygroscopic amorphous herbal mixtures. (c) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Orthosiphon aristatus (Lamiaceae) is an herb {{medicinal}} found {{mainly in}} China, Indian and South East Asia.

40|$|AbstractPomegranate peels (outside, {{inside and}} whole) were oven (40 °C) and solar <b>dried.</b> <b>Aqueous</b> and {{methanolic}} <b>extracts</b> were prepared from the dried peels, and their antioxidant activities [radical scavenging activity (RSA %), ABTS radical scavenging, total phenolic content (TPC) and total flavonoids content (TFC) ] were determined. The <b>aqueous</b> <b>extract</b> of the <b>dried</b> whole peel showed the highest antioxidant activities {{as compared to}} other pomegranate peel extracts (PPEs). Stirred yoghurt was prepared from reconstituted skim milk powder fortified with 5 %, 10 %, 15 %, 20 %, 25 %, 30 % and 35 % of the PPE, before and after inoculation with the traditional yoghurt starter. Addition of PPE before inoculation with the starter resulted in stirred yoghurt of higher antioxidant activities than that with PPE added after inoculation with the starter. Also, increasing {{the percentage of the}} added PPE increased significantly the antioxidant activities of stirred yoghurt up to 25 % and further increase in the percentage of added PPE led no significant effect. Addition of PPE had no significant effects on the sensory attributes (appearance, body & texture and flavor) as compared to the control sample. Increasing the percentage of the added PPE resulted in decrease in the viscosity of the stirred yoghurt, but samples containing 20 % and 25 % PPE led almost the same viscosity...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTea is an {{interesting}} source of antioxidants capable of counteracting the oxidative stress implicated in liver diseases. We investigated the impact of antioxidant molecules provided by a mixture of teas' leaves (green, oolong, pu-erh) after different infusion durations {{in the prevention of}} oxidative stress in isolated rat hepatocytes, by comparison with pure epigallocatechin- 3 -gallate (EGCG), the main representative of tea catechins. <b>Dried</b> <b>aqueous</b> tea <b>extracts</b> (ATE) obtained after 5, 15 and 30 min infusion time were characterized for total polyphenols (gallic acid equivalent), catechins, gallic acid and caffeine (HPLC-DAD/ESI-MS) contents, and for scavenging ability against 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl free radical. Hepatoprotection was evaluated through hepatocyte viability tests using tert-butyl hydroperoxide as a stress inducer, (3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide, neutral red uptake, real-time cellular impedance) and mitochondrial function tests. We showed that a 5 -min incubation time is sufficient for an optimal bioaccessibility of tea compounds with the highest antioxidative ability, which decreases for longer durations. A 4 -h pretreatment of cells with ATE significantly prevented cell death by regulating reactive oxygen species production and maintaining mitochondrial integrity. Pure EGCG, at doses similar in ATE (5 - 12 µM), was inefficient, suggesting a plausible synergy of several water-soluble tea compounds to explain the ATE beneficial effects...|$|R
40|$|Glucoputranjivin (1) and {{isopropyl}} isothiocyanate (2) {{were isolated}} from an <b>aqueous</b> <b>dry</b> <b>extract</b> of Sisymbrium officinale and {{were identified by}} spectroscopic analysis. The antimutagenic activity of these compounds was evaluated in a bacterial reverse mutation assay using E. coli WP 2, WP 2 uvrA, and WP 2 uvrA/pKM 101 strains, {{in comparison with the}} extract. In the absence of the exogenous metabolic activation system S 9, the thio compounds exerted antimutagenic activity against the direct-acting mutagen methyl methanesulfonate, in all strains. In the presence of S 9, both thio compounds were active against the indirect mutagens 2 -aminoanthracene, in WP 2 uvrA, and 2 -aminofluorene, in WP 2. The antimutagenicity seems to be due to specific mechanisms, such as the induction of the adaptive response or the excision repair system. Conversely, the inhibition of the CYP 450 -mediated activation of mutagens was not supported by the present results. An antimutagenic effect was also observed for the S. officinale <b>aqueous</b> <b>extract</b> against the arylamines 2 AA and 2 AF, but not against MMS. These results suggest that both thio compounds are involved in the antimutagenicity of S. officinale. The antimutagenicity of glucosinolate 1 is reported for the first time...|$|R
40|$|Using natural {{products}} {{can be a}} cost-effective approach for caries prevention especially in low income countries where dental caries is highly prevalent and the resources are limited. Specially prepared dental varnishes containing propolis, miswak, and chitosan nanoparticles (CS-NPs) with or without sodium fluoride (NaF) were assessed for antibacterial effect against Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) using disk diffusion test. In addition, the protective effect of a single pretreatment of primary teeth enamel specimens against in vitro bacterial induced enamel demineralization was assessed for 3  days. All {{natural products}} containing varnishes inhibited bacterial growth significantly better than 5 % NaF varnish, with NaF loaded CS-NPs (CSF-NPs) showing the highest antibacterial effect, though it didn’t significantly differ than those of other varnishes except miswak ethanolic extract (M) varnish. Greater inhibitory effect was noted with varnish containing freeze <b>dried</b> <b>aqueous</b> miswak <b>extract</b> compared to that containing ethanolic miswak extract, possibly due to concentration of antimicrobial substances by freeze drying. Adding natural products to NaF in a dental varnish showed an additive effect especially compared to fluoride containing varnish. 5 % NaF varnish showed the best inhibition of demineralization effect. Fluoride containing miswak varnish (MF) and CSF-NPs varnish inhibited demineralization significantly better than all experimental varnishes, especially during the first 2  days, though CSF-NPs varnish had a low fluoride concentration, probably due to better availability of fluoride ions and the smaller size of nanoparticles. Incorporating natural products with fluoride into dental varnishes {{can be an effective}} approach for caries prevention, especially miswak and propolis when financial resources are limited...|$|R
