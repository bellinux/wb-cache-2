5|$|Richard {{began the}} 1977 season on a <b>high</b> <b>note</b> with a nine-inning, seven-strikeout {{performance}} on April 8 against the Braves. He pitched seven complete game {{victories in the}} first half of the season. By the All-Star break, Richard had nine wins and six losses in over 160innings of work, accompanied by 119strikeouts and a 2.69ERA. Although Richard struggled through July and early August, he did manage to pitch three complete games (including two shutouts) in five starts from August 27 to September 17. He had 11 and 10strikeouts respectively in the final two starts of that roughly 20-day span.|$|E
5|$|Although Warner {{announced}} {{before the}} 1922 season {{that he was}} leaving to take the head-coaching position at Stanford, he honored his contract and remained at Pitt through 1923. The 1922 team had an 8–2 record, and the season ended with the Panthers taking their first cross-country train trip to defeat Stanford 16–7 in Palo Alto (coached by two Pitt assistants, sent ahead by Warner). Andrew Kerr became head coach at Stanford during Warner's last two years at Pitt. Warner's final season was his worst at Pitt, as the Panthers stumbled to a 5–4 record in 1923. However, the Warner era ended on a <b>high</b> <b>note</b> with a 20–3 victory over Penn State on November 29.|$|E
5|$|Kane {{competed in}} five {{events at the}} 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi, winning a bronze medal in the men's super G behind Russia's Alexey Bugaev and Austria's Matthias Lanzinger. It was Australia's first medal at the Sochi Games. On winning his bronze medal, he {{announced}} that he would retire {{at the conclusion of the}} Games, ending his career on a <b>high</b> <b>note.</b> He went on to finish fourth in the men's slalom standing and sixth in the men's downhill standing, and failed to finish in two events. Towards the end of the Games, Kane and Dutch snowboarder Bibian Mentel-Spee were named winners of the Whang Youn Dai Achievement Award, which is presented at every Paralympic Games for outstanding performances and overcoming adversity.|$|E

5|$|Richard {{closed out}} {{the season with}} two {{complete}} games, the first against the Braves on September 27, and the second against the Dodgers on October 2. He had a season-high 14strikeouts in his final start, which tied Steve Carlton's season-high mark. Richard concluded the season on a <b>high</b> <b>note</b> by winning nine of his last twelve decisions. At {{the end of the}} season, he led the Astros' pitching staff in wins, starts, complete games, innings pitched, walks and strikeouts. He had 18wins and 12losses in 267innings pitched and posted a 2.97ERA and 214strikeouts. For the first time since becoming a permanent member of the Astros' starting rotation, Richard was not the league leader in walks allowed, but as he had done in 1976, he led the league in wild pitches. He finished fourth in the league with 13 complete games, and he improved his fielding from the previous season by going through an error-free season.|$|E
5|$|The Copa Libertadores {{stayed on}} Brazilian soil for the {{remainder}} of the 1990s as Cruzeiro, Vasco da Gama and Palmeiras took the spoils. The cup of 1997 pitted Cruzeiro against Peruvian club Sporting Cristal. The key breakthrough came in the second leg of the final when Cruzeiro broke the deadlock with just under 15 minutes left in a match attended by over 106,000 spectators in the Mineirão. Vasco da Gama defeated Barcelona SC with ease to record their first title in 1998. The decade ended on a <b>high</b> <b>note</b> when Palmeiras and Deportivo Cali, both runners-up in the competition before, vied to become winners for the first time in 1999. The final was a dramatic back-and-forth match that went into penalties. Luiz Felipe Scolari managed to lead yet another club to victory as the Verdão won 4–3 in São Paulo.|$|E
5|$|The club had one {{of their}} worst season starts ever; they lost three {{straight}} in the league – reaching a season-worst 17th position after three rounds – and both their European appearances against FC Kuban Krasnodar. Because they only lost two more games {{in the first half}} of the season, they climbed to fourth place in the table at the halfway mark. They won three KNVB Cup games to eventually succumb to the eventual runners-up in the quarter-finals. The team ended the season on a <b>high</b> <b>note</b> with a seven-game winning streak before drawing the last game of the season. This led to a second-place finish in the 2013–14 Eredivisie, a place that qualified Feyenoord for the third qualifying round in the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League. Overall Feyenoord won 23 matches, drew 7 and lost 10 during the season. Graziano Pellè was the season topscorer with 26 goals, of which 23 occurred in the Eredivisie.|$|E
50|$|The natural inharmonicity of a piano {{is used by}} the tuner to make slight {{adjustments}} in the tuning of a piano.

50|$|The <b>highest</b> <b>notes</b> on a {{clarinet}} {{can have}} a shrill piercing quality and {{can be difficult to}} tune accurately.

50|$|Adam Lopez Costa (born August 26, 1975), {{billed as}} Adam Lopez, is an Australian pop musician, vocal coach, and session vocalist. He is noted {{for his ability}} to produce {{extremely}} <b>high</b> <b>notes</b> in his whistle register and for his extensive vocal range. He is currently a Guinness World Record holder for singing the <b>highest</b> <b>note</b> (by a male) and a half step below the E in the 8th octave (E8), or a tone and a semitone above the <b>highest</b> <b>note</b> on a standard 88-key piano.

5|$|In {{his first}} {{thirteen}} weeks {{as a professional}} football player, Hester recorded six return touchdowns, including a punt return in his NFL debut, and a then-record tying 108-yard touchdown from a missed field goal against the New York Giants. He also returned a punt for a clutch 83-yard game-winning touchdown against the Arizona Cardinals to give the Bears the lead in a comeback win, and two kickoff returns in one game against the St. Louis Rams. Following his record-breaking game during Week 14, opposing teams exercised additional caution when allowing Hester to return kicks. During the postseason Hester ran back a punt at a critical moment against the Seattle Seahawks, but it was called back on a blocking penalty. Regardless, the Bears won both NFC playoffs rounds, and advanced to Super Bowl XLI to play the Indianapolis Colts. He started the game on a <b>high</b> <b>note</b> for the Bears by returning the game’s opening kick for a touchdown. The feat was the first touchdown return of an opening kickoff in Super Bowl history. It also marked the quickest touchdown scored in Super Bowl history {{as well as the}} quickest lead ever taken by any team, though the latter record has since been surpassed by the Seahawks in Super Bowl XLVIII. Following the kick, the Colts did not kick the ball directly to Hester, significantly limiting the Bears’ return efforts.|$|E
5|$|In the 2008–09 season, Buffon {{was once}} again sidelined by several injuries. From September through January, reserve goalkeeper Alexander Manninger held his {{position}} between the sticks, gaining praise for his deputising. Due to recurring injuries, Manninger's performances and Juventus's poor form {{towards the end of}} the season (as Buffon was seen despondent whilst the team drew with both Lecce and Atalanta), there were further rumours that Buffon was displeased and wanted to part ways with the club. He admitted he was disappointed with the current results, but assured that he had no intention of leaving. After a discussion with management, he said he was reassured about the club's future and signed a contract extension to 2013. Buffon and Juventus finished the season on a <b>high</b> <b>note,</b> with two victories, finishing in second place behind Internazionale. They were knocked out of the Coppa Italia semi-finals by eventual champions Lazio and of the Champions League in the round of 16 by Chelsea. Buffon was nominated for the FIFA World Player of the Year in 2009 for the sixth consecutive season since first being nominated in 2004. Buffon made his 300th appearance for Juventus in a 3–3 home draw against Chievo in 2009.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the {{first-class}} season, Pathan scored 56 but took a total of only 1/91 for the Board President's XI against the touring Australians ahead of the Test series, and he was overlooked for Test selection as India used only two pacemen. He returned to play for Baroda in the Ranji Trophy. He played in four matches and performed strongly, taking 26 wickets at 16.03 and scored 166 runs at 33.20. He started the season with 6/85 and 1/34 in a draw against Uttar Pradesh, and then took 4/42 and 1/46 against Railways. He then put on an all-round display to guide his team to a victory over Maharashtra. Pathan took 5/64 and then scored 51 as Baroda made 305 in their first innings to take a 77-run lead. After taking 1/61 in the second innings, he scored an unbeaten 50 to guide Baroda to their target of 227 with four wickets in hand. In his final Ranji fixture for the season, he took 7/35 in the first innings to help dismiss Andhra Pradesh for 77, setting up an innings win. However, with India persisting with and tasting success with their Test bowling strategy, Pathan was also overlooked for the home Tests against England. Pathan's domestic season was interrupted by spasmodic limited overs duty. Following his recent uneconomical run in ODIs, he was not given a game in the seven-match series against England in November until India had taken an unassailable 4–0 series lead. He took 0/57 from ten overs in the fifth match, as India recorded another victory, but did not get another opportunity after the Mumbai terrorist attacks saw the two remaining fixtures cancelled. Pathan was then selected for the early-2009 five-match ODI tour of Sri Lanka, but was not entrusted with a match until India took an unbeatable 3–0 lead. He took four wickets at 28.25 in two matches, but was again expensive, conceding 7.06 runs an over. However, he ended the tour on a <b>high</b> <b>note</b> when he combined with half-brother Yusuf in an unbroken eighth-wicket stand that saw India to a three-wicket win in the T20 international after a late flurry; Irfan ended on 33 not out. Pathan returned to India and took 3/50 and scored 51 not out in his only domestic one-dayer for Baroda during the season, which ended in a win, before leaving for the limited overs leg of a tour to New Zealand.|$|E

Warner's final season was his worst at Pitt as the Panthers stumbled to a 5–4 record in 1923.
