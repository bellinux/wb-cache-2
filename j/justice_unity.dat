The US government threatened that {{relations between the two}} countries could worsen in case that Narong became head of government. He had to relinquish premiership and the parliament instead nominated the putschist General Suchinda Kraprayoon. Really, Narong had not been prosecuted as there was no sufficient evidence. As the leader of the biggest coalition party, Narong still became deputy prime minister under Suchinda. After the bloody crackdown on the oppositional movement protesting against the military-backed government, the <b>Justice</b> <b>Unity</b> Party was discredited and dissolved. Narong instead joined the Thai Nation Party.

5000|$|Legally, the National Development Party was the {{successor}} of the Thai People's Party established by General Arthit Kamlang-ek in 1982. By 1992, {{it was only}} an empty shell, as General Arthit and all notable members had abandoned it. Shortly ahead of the elections in September 1992, Chatichai Choonhavan, who had been prime minister until the military coup d'état in 1991, {{and a group of}} other Thai Nation Party politicians around Chatichai's nephew Korn Dabbaransi took over the party and renamed it. The establishment followed a rupture in the Thai Nation Party, whose leadership around Somboon Rahong and secretary general Banharn Silpa-archa had stood {{at the side of the}} military junta (NPKC) during the popular protests and bloody crackdown of Black May. Therefore, the Thai Nation Party was considered one of the [...] "devil parties". A faction of Thai Nation deputies around Chatichai's cousin Korn Dabbaransi felt uncomfortable with this policy and persuaded Chatichai to leave the party. The new party was set up as a vehicle to support a second premiership for Chatichai. They were joined by members of the likewise military-allied <b>Justice</b> <b>Unity</b> Party who now wanted to disassociate themselves from the junta. They included General Arthit Kamlang-ek (who thus returned to his original party), Somchai Khunpluem ("Kamnan Poh", or the [...] "Godfather of Chonburi") and Suwat Liptapanlop, an entrepreneur from Nakhon Ratchasima. Moreover, the party could win over Democrat Party secretary general Prachuab Chaisarn.|$|E
