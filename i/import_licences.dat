5|$|By April 1955 the Guatemalan government's foreign {{exchange}} reserves had declined from $42million {{at the end of}} 1954 to just $3.4million. The regime was thus facing difficulties borrowing money, leading to capital flight. The government also received criticism for the presence of black markets and other signs of approaching bankruptcy. By the end of 1954 the number of unemployed people in the country had risen to 20,000, four times higher than it had been during the latter years of the Árbenz government. In April 1955 the Eisenhower administration approved an aid package of $53million and began to underwrite the debt of the Guatemalan government. Although officials in the USgovernment complained about Castillo Armas's incompetence and corruption, he also received praise in that country for acting against communists, and his human rights violations generally went unremarked. In 1955, during a corn famine, Castillo Armas gave corn <b>import</b> <b>licences</b> to some of his old fighters in return for a $25,000 bribe. The imported corn, upon inspection by the United Nations, turned out to be unfit for consumption. When a student newspaper exposed the story, Castillo Armas launched a police crackdown against those criticizing him. Castillo Armas returned some of the privileges that the United Fruit Company had had under Ubico, but the company did not benefit substantially from them; it went into a gradual decline following disastrous experiments with breeding and pesticides, falling demand, and an anti-trust action.|$|E
500|$|The Rhodesian {{government}} accompanied UDI with {{emergency measures}} that it said {{were intended to}} prevent alarm, unrest and the flight of people and capital. Press censorship and petrol rationing were imposed, <b>import</b> <b>licences</b> were cancelled and emigration allowances were cut to £100. News of UDI was generally received calmly by the local citizenry, apart from some isolated incidents of passing cars being stoned in the black townships outside Bulawayo. A few expected dissenters were arrested, most prominently Leo Baron, Nkomo's lawyer, whose links with black nationalists and communists were seen by authorities as [...] "subversive".

Phil Holloway, the then-Minister for Industries and Commerce under Prime Minister Walter Nash during the Second Labour Government. Holloway was not happy with the innuendo that he was involved in issuing <b>import</b> <b>licences</b> in a questionable way, and sued the paper for defamation.

50|$|The project {{commenced}} in Autumn 1966 when Alan {{moved to}} Auckland {{to join with}} his brother Ian, owner of Anziel Limited, in the venture. The Gibbs' also needed an <b>import</b> <b>licence</b> for the assembly plant, parts, and materials.

50|$|In August 1966 the Gibbs' sought Government {{consent to}} obtain an import licence for their proposal. They {{proposed}} to build 3,000 cars per annum, with production commencing in mid-1968. Jack Marshall, was the then Minister of Trade and Industry, whose consent was sought. He declined their request {{on the grounds that}} New Zealand was suffering from falling export prices at the time, which was causing a balance of trade problem for the Government. Other established car manufacturers were having the <b>import</b> <b>licences</b> reduced and the granting of a licence to another manufacturer was seen as counter-productive.|$|E
5000|$|The {{formation}} of Databank {{came at a}} time when computer systems were a scarce and expensive commodity in New Zealand, with the import of computers being restricted by the then government's prevailing highly regulatory economic policy. Computers could only be <b>imported</b> under <b>licence.</b> The executive management of the BNZ (Bank of New Zealand) wanted to obtain a computer and establish a computerised system to enable the automation of the processing of its banking transactions and customer accounting. Computerisation was deemed as the only way to proceed if the increasing cheque transaction volumes were to be accommodated in timely fashion. The other, smaller banks were approaching the point where they would face a similar situation. However, the NBNZ (National Bank of New Zealand) {{was the only one that}} happened to have a computer <b>import</b> <b>licence.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Production {{began in}} an old flour store in Devon Street, New Plymouth. The aim was to make 120 {{machines}} a year, but demand was higher after a flurry of articles in magazines and newspapers about the bike. Some were sold to Borneo and the New Hebrides. [...] Problems soon arose with the government refusing to issue an <b>import</b> <b>licence</b> for the engines and brake hubs. While negotiations continued between Callender and the government, Callender sent {{a photo of the}} bike along with Hillary, Mulgrave, and himself to Suzuki in Japan. Suzuki turned the photo into a giant poster on their Tokyo Motor Show stand along with a replica of the bike. In 1966 the government issued the <b>import</b> <b>licence</b> to allow enough parts to build the 120 bikes per year. By that time Callender had decided to sell the business to Motor Components of Waitara. Motor Components planned to sell 1,000 bikes per year, but by then Suzuki had commenced production of its own specialised machine. They in turn were followed by the other major Japanese motor cycle manufacturers. Production at the Waitara plant stopped in the 1970s.|$|R
5|$|The {{development}} of sales was overestimated; in 1956, 525 Vanajas were sold and in March 1957, the volume {{for the whole}} year was estimated to reach about 400units. VAT employed about 200 workers {{at the time and}} changed to a four-day working week. The company blamed the government's <b>import</b> <b>licence</b> bureaucracy for the problemit was difficult to get diesel engines from abroad. In the following month, over 30 Vanajas that were otherwise ready were awaiting diesel engines. The economy improved in 1959.|$|R
50|$|After 1976, the zoo {{suffered}} from {{competition with the}} much larger Ocean Park. On 31 July 1993, the zoo was closed. This decision was hastened by the Hong Kong Government refusing <b>import</b> <b>licences</b> for new animals, it has since been redeveloped for residential purposes. Most of the remaining animals were sent to Xili Lake Wild Animal Park (now called Safari Park Shenzhen) in Shenzhen. Concern has subsequently been expressed about their welfare in view of criticism of the Safari Park's standards of animal care. The Saltwater Crocodiles remained at the Park until it closed in 1997 and were then taken to Shek Kwu Chau.|$|E
50|$|The Morris Marina was {{a popular}} car on the New Zealand market, {{imported}} by the New Zealand Motor Corporation. Imports began with built-up British-sourced saloons and coupes (in 1.3- and 1.8-litre forms) in 1971. Local assembly of Australian-sourced (E-Series engines) models began in 1972 {{after the release of}} the Marinas there. Six-cylinder models were added in 1973. In 1974, before the termination of Leyland Australia's manufacturing operations, local assembly switched to British-sourced models again in saloon, estate, van and pick-up forms. Batches of fully built UK-sourced cars also came in 1973 and 1974 when the government allowed additional <b>import</b> <b>licences</b> due to the inability of local assembly plants to keep pace with demand for new cars.|$|E

50|$|This {{generation}} of Prince was also assembled in New Zealand by Steel Brothers in Christchurch but was now badged as a Nissan Gloria {{though it was}} still imported by Croyden Motors, a separate company to Datsun importer Nissan-Datsun NZ Ltd. A total of 900 Prince and Nissan Glorias were built in NZ Mark Webster, 2002, p144 which corresponds to the annual low-volume <b>import</b> <b>licence</b> allocation of 300 CKD units a year under government policy of the time. Following the merger of Prince and Nissan in Japan, the Gloria in NZ effectively was replaced by Nissan-Datsun imports of Japanese-assembled Datsun 2300 Personal Six sedans and, later, imported 240C and locally assembled 260C sedans.|$|R
5000|$|From May 1950 buyers could {{dodge the}} {{apparently}} endless queues {{for a new}} car by using [...] "overseas funds". They could even import cars for which no <b>import</b> <b>licence</b> would ever be provided. In essence the buyer {{would pay for the}} overseas content of the car from a source beyond the control of New Zealand's manifold foreign currency restrictions. The balance of dealer overheads, duty and sales tax was paid in local currency when the vehicle was delivered. If the vehicle were locally assembled the [...] "overseas funds" [...] requirement was much lower. Until late in the scheme [...] "Overseas funds" [...] were not difficult to obtain or [...] "create". Most New Zealanders disliked the necessary deviousness.|$|R

50|$|Nissan-Datsun New Zealand {{occasionally}} imported later generation Violets {{and other}} models for evaluation, or imported a small production run if additional <b>import</b> <b>licences</b> became available (there was a trading scheme enabling importers to trade unused annual license allocations with each other).

There was also a small later shipment of cars for public sale (this time without a/c) but, as usual with low-volume imports of this type by Nissan and rivals, most were presold before the ship docked. A number of Stanzas also arrived as used imports from Japan in the late 1980s.|$|E

50|$|From 1930, the {{international}} crisis {{triggered by the}} Wall Street Crash of 1929, also affected Luxembourg and Belgium. Production and exports started to collapse. The crisis inevitably had repercussions for {{the functioning of the}} UEBL, as it provoked a return to protectionism in all countries. Belgium and Luxembourg each put in place protective measures without notifying the other: a quota for certain products, <b>import</b> <b>licences,</b> etc. An economic border was established again between the two countries. The rapid degradation of bilateral relations forced the two governments to start negotiations. On 23 May 1935, a group of treaties were signed in Brussels, which provided a solution to the deadlock. These agreements reaffirmed the principle {{at the root of the}} UEBL, namely free trade between the two countries, an instituted an administrative commission, composed in equal measure of Luxembourgers and Belgians, which became an essential instrument for Belgo-Luxembourgish cooperation. The agreements of 1935 also dealt with a number of monetary questions, and put a cap on the circulation of Luxembourgish currency in the Grand Duchy. During the negotiations, the Luxembourgish government succeeded in obtaining numerous concessions for agriculture in the Grand Duchy. Joseph Bech, who was also the Minister for Agriculture, wanted to protect this sector, which remained one of the pillars of Luxembourgish society (employing 30% of the active population in 1935) and which was the main electoral base of the Party of the Right. However, these protective measures were to postpone necessary structural reforms, and made it all the more difficult to adapt to {{the international}} market.|$|E
5000|$|Gibbs went to London in 1963 as Third Secretary in the New Zealand High Commission, {{returning}} to New Zealand in 1965 {{to work in}} the Prime Minister's department. He left soon after with a dream to build what he promoted as the first New Zealand car, the Anziel Nova. In New Zealand's then highly regulated economy he failed to gain the necessary <b>import</b> <b>licences</b> to build the cars, and abandoned the scheme in 1970 after a four-year battle. Gibbs then moved to Sydney for two years, where he worked as a merchant banker, {{returning to}} set up the Chase-NBA merchant bank in Auckland in 1972. After an early retirement in 1975, he established Gibbs, Saint and Co. in 1977, specialising in corporate advisory work. This later became Gibbs Securities Ltd. [...] Gibbs' career took off in 1979 when, with three other investors, he purchased Tappenden Motors Ltd. They liquidated it profitably over the next few years. Gibbs then gained stakes in Atlas Majestic Industries, Bendon and Ceramco, three prominent New Zealand public companies which he merged in 1986 and 1987 and that was liquidated in 1989. Meantime, in 1985 he and Trevor Farmer made a successful $114 million takeover bid for the publicly listed transport and security company Freightways Ltd. In early 1990 the Fourth Labour Government confirmed it would sell the Telecom Corporation of New Zealand. Together with merchant banker David Richwhite, Gibbs brokered the $4.25 billion winning bid for the company, which when subsequently floated became the largest company on the New Zealand Stock Exchange. As part of the deal, Gibbs became a director and he and Farmer took a 5 per cent holding in the company. Following a second round of restructuring, led by Gibbs, this holding proved very valuable.|$|E

40|$|This ban {{comes into}} force with {{immediate}} effect on Friday 22 July 2011. Phenazepam is a benzodiazepine which is currently not controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (1971 Act) in the UK. Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs's advice: The UK Government has received independent expert advice from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) that phenazepam is sufficiently harmful to justify an immediate import ban under the Open General <b>Import</b> <b>Licence</b> pending its control as a Class C drug under the 1971 Act. The ACMD’s assessment reports that phenazepam is being marketed as a so called ‘legal high’ product, particularly on the internet. It {{has been identified as}} being a potent member of the benzodiazepine family causing harms such as amnesia and drowsiness that may potentially proceed to a coma with respiratory depression. Whilst phenazepam has been recognised to have limited medicinal properties, it is not prescribed in the UK for treatment neither does it have a UK marketing authorisation. Further, it has no legitimate commercial or industrial uses in the UK. This amendment to the Open General <b>Import</b> <b>Licence</b> will remain in place until such time as it is revoked. This will likely occur when phenazepam is fully controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 where it will be a criminal offence to unlawfully import, export, supply, offer to supply, possess with intent to supply and be in simple possession of this substance without a licence or lawful authority.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of contemporary sugar trade policy in Indonesia highlights {{problems in the}} institutional framework for trade policy making. The institutions through which sugar trade policy is formulated entrench the interests of rent-seeking bureaucrats, <b>import</b> <b>licence</b> holders and traders {{to the detriment of}} consumers and downstream producers of processed products. Moreover, the resulting trade policy regime has problematic effects on sugarcane farmers. The structure of regulatory intervention is due less to democratic pressures than to the inclusion of vested interests in the institutions that formulate policy. Further, the lack of effective mechanisms for inter-ministerial coordination and for resolving conflicting policy preferences among ministries hinders the development of coherent trade policy and obstructs reform efforts. An institutional framework that facilitates representation of all interests affected by sugar trade policies and public scrutiny of the effects of policy intervention is likely to deliver better outcomes for consumers and producers alike. ...|$|R
