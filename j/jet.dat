5|$|Associated with <b>jet</b> streams is a {{phenomenon}} known as clear-air turbulence (CAT), caused by vertical and horizontal wind shear caused by <b>jet</b> streams. The CAT is strongest on the cold air side of the <b>jet,</b> next to and just under the axis of the <b>jet.</b> Clear-air turbulence can cause aircraft to plunge and so present a passenger safety hazard that has caused fatal accidents, such as {{the death of one}} passenger on United Airlines Flight 826.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, <b>jet</b> engine {{engineer}} Stanley Hooker of the Bristol Engine Company informed aeronautics engineer Sydney Camm of Hawker Aircraft that Bristol {{had been}} working a project that combined major elements of their Olympus and Orpheus <b>jet</b> engines to produce a directable fan <b>jet.</b> The projected fan <b>jet</b> harnessed rotatable cold jets which were positioned {{on either side of}} the compressor along with a 'hot' <b>jet</b> which was directed via a conventional central tailpipe. The original concept upon which the engine, which had been named Pegasus, was based came from Michel Wibault, a French aviation consultant. Several adaptions and enhancements were made by Bristol to reduce size and weight over Wibault's original concept.|$|E
5|$|<b>Jet</b> streams {{are fast}} flowing, narrow, {{meandering}} air currents in the atmospheres of some planets, including Earth. On Earth, the main <b>jet</b> streams are {{located near the}} altitude of the tropopause and are westerly winds (flowing west to east). Their paths typically have a meandering shape. <b>Jet</b> streams may start, stop, split into two or more parts, combine into one stream, or flow in various directions including opposite to {{the direction of the}} remainder of the <b>jet.</b>|$|E

5|$|<b>Jet</b> streams are {{the product}} of two factors: the {{atmospheric}} heating by solar radiation that produces the large scale Polar, Ferrel, and Hadley circulation cells, and the action of the Coriolis force acting on those moving masses. The Coriolis force is caused by the planet's rotation on its axis. On other planets, internal heat rather than solar heating drives their <b>jet</b> streams. The Polar <b>jet</b> stream forms near the interface of the Polar and Ferrel circulation cells; while the subtropical <b>jet</b> forms near the boundary of the Ferrel and Hadley circulation cells.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's {{atmosphere}} {{has multiple}} <b>jet</b> streams, {{caused by the}} convection cells that form the familiar banded color structure; on Jupiter, these convection cells are driven by internal heating. The factors that control the number of <b>jet</b> streams in a planetary atmosphere is an active area of research in dynamical meteorology. In models, as one increases the planetary radius, holding all other parameters fixed, the number of <b>jet</b> streams decreases.|$|E
5|$|Longtime Quarter Horse breeder and racehorse owner Walter Merrick of Sayre, Oklahoma, bred Easy <b>Jet</b> {{from two}} future AQHA Hall of Fame members, <b>Jet</b> Deck and Thoroughbred mare Lena's Bar in 1967.

40|$|Sphere {{slamming}} {{pressures and}} corresponding <b>jetting</b> flow fields were studied in an experimental approach. Correlations between sphere impacting forces and <b>jetting</b> flow occurrences were explored. Pressure sensor {{was used to}} investigate the slamming pressures distributed around the sphere at five measuring points.

The pressures and <b>jetting</b> were studied in four various sphere impacting speeds as four cases. Five designed impacting angles which means impacting measuring point around sphere surface for sensor were conducted for each case. Maximum pressures happened at impacting measuring point of 0 o. Maximum <b>jetting</b> flow speed traveled as the front of <b>jetting</b> fields. The pressures and <b>jetting</b> speeds was proportional to corresponding impacting speed. Control volume approach was suggested to examine the force transfer between slamming and <b>jetting.</b> The <b>jetting</b> forces were compared with the impacting forces with respect to increasing surface area of sphere under water.

5|$|Low-level <b>jet</b> streams. When a nocturnal {{low-level}} <b>jet</b> forms overnight {{above the}} Earth's surface {{ahead of a}} cold front, significant low level vertical wind shear can develop near the lower portion of the low level <b>jet.</b> This {{is also known as}} nonconvective wind shear since it is not due to nearby thunderstorms.|$|E
5|$|Meteorologists use the {{location}} {{of some of the}} <b>jet</b> streams as an aid in weather forecasting. The main commercial relevance of the <b>jet</b> streams is in air travel, as flight time can be dramatically affected by either flying with the flow or against, which results in significant fuel and time cost savings for airlines. Often, the airlines work to fly 'with' the <b>jet</b> stream for this reason. Dynamic North Atlantic Tracks are one example of how airlines and air traffic control work together to accommodate the <b>jet</b> stream and winds aloft that results in the maximum benefit for airlines and other users. Clear-air turbulence, a potential hazard to aircraft passenger safety, is often found in a <b>jet</b> stream's vicinity, but it does not create a substantial alteration on flight times. These are a narrow belt.|$|E
5|$|On Earth, the {{northern}} polar <b>jet</b> stream {{is the most}} important one for aviation and weather forecasting, as it is much stronger and at a much lower altitude than the subtropical <b>jet</b> streams and also covers many countries in the Northern Hemisphere, while the southern polar <b>jet</b> stream mostly circles Antarctica and sometimes the southern tip of South America. The term <b>jet</b> stream in these contexts thus usually implies {{the northern}} polar <b>jet</b> stream.|$|E
