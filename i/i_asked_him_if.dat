25|$|Both Heirens and {{his parents}} signed a confession. The parties agreed to a date of July 30 for Heirens to make his {{official}} confession. On that date the defense went to Tuohy's office, where several reporters were assembled to ask Heirens questions and where Tuohy himself made a speech. Heirens appeared bewildered and gave noncommittal answers to reporters' questions, which he years later blamed on Tuohy:It was Tuohy himself. After assembling all the officials, including attorneys and policemen, he began a preamble about how long everyone had waited to get a confession from me, but, at last, the truth {{was going to be}} told. He kept emphasizing the word 'truth' and <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> he really wanted the truth. He assured me that he did...Now Tuohy made a big deal about hearing the truth. Now, when I was being forced to lie to save myself. It made me angry...so I told them the truth, and everyone got very upset.|$|E
500|$|The Times {{followed}} with {{essentially the same}} story on 4 October 1994, adding that the burning [...] " [...] left many on the island bewildered, incredulous and angry". £1,500 had been handed in by a local fisherman to Islay police: [...] "Sergeant Lachlan Maclean checked the money with both banks on Islay and with Customs and Excise, who pronounced it genuine. 'I telephoned Mr Drummond in London and told him the money had been found. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> it was his. He said he would {{get in touch with}} his partner, Mr Cauty. So far he has not telephoned back.|$|E
2500|$|The day after, I {{asked my}} pilot, a cheerful young New Zealander, {{if he thought}} we really needed an escort. He said that, unless we had bad luck, he could {{probably}} get away from anything except a very up-to-date fighter. [...] <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> he would get into trouble if we went without an escort. He replied cheerfully that, if we came back safely, no one would say anything, and if we didn't, it wouldn't matter anyway. This seemed sound enough logic, and so we sent off a signal to Robin, announcing our arrival, and set off on our own.|$|E
6000|$|... 'That is enough,' the {{man said}} at last brusquely. 'I cannot {{understand}} him, but I want that picture. He is a better artist than <b>I.</b> <b>Ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> he will sell it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "MR. MORGAN (excitedly): 'Mr. Chairman--I do most strenuously {{object to}} this amendment. The gentleman from Oregon is old, and {{furthermore}} is bulky only in bone--not in flesh. <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> {{the gentleman from}} Virginia if it is soup we want instead of solid sustenance? if he would delude us with shadows? if he would mock our suffering with an Oregonian specter? <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> he can look upon the anxious faces around <b>him,</b> <b>if</b> he can gaze into our sad eyes, if he can listen to the beating of our expectant hearts, and still thrust this famine-stricken fraud upon us? <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> he can think of our desolate state, of our past sorrows, of our dark future, and still unpityingly foist upon us this wreck, this ruin, this tottering swindle, this gnarled and blighted and sapless vagabond from Oregon's inhospitable shores? Never!' [Applause.] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never {{you mind}} what I'm going to do. I 'ave my methods.

Brush all them crumbs carefully off the tablecloth, young blighted Albert--don't shuffle your feet--breathe softly through your nose--and close the door be'ind you when you've finished!" ...|$|R
2500|$|While at a {{cocktail}} party, Dziubinska met the actor Sir John Mills. She is quoted as saying, 'I adored Hayley, so I went over {{to talk to him}} about my favourite film of all time, Whistle Down The Wind, which I've seen four million times. I said to him that I was an actress and that I'd been acting since I was at school and then <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> he had any advice, and he said, 'do everything you're offered, because everything you do will give you some experience!' The first thing I was offered the next day was Vampyres!' ...|$|E
2500|$|Rivers {{had visited}} his college {{frequently}} {{during the war}} although, having resigned his position as lecturer, he held no official post. However, upon his return from the Royal Air Force in 1919, the college created a new office for him – [...] "Praelector of Natural Science Studies" [...] – and {{he was given a}} free rein to do as he pleased. As Leonard E. Shore recalled in 1923: [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> he would undertake that work... his eyes shone with a new light I had not seen before, and he paced his rooms for several minutes full of delight." [...] He took his new position to be a mandate to get to know every science student and indeed every other student at St. Johns, Cambridge, and at other colleges. He would arrange [...] "At Homes" [...] in his rooms on Sunday evenings, as well as Sunday morning breakfast meetings; he also organised informal discussions and formal lectures (many of which he gave himself) in the College Hall. He formed a group called The Socratics and brought to it some of his most influential friends, including H. G. Wells, Arnold Bennett, Bertrand Russell and Sassoon. Sassoon (Patient B in Conflict and Dream), remained particularly friendly with Rivers and regarded him as a mentor. [...] They shared Socialist sympathies.|$|E
2500|$|In addition, Jeph Loeb {{requested}} {{the introduction of}} Superman’s future ally, Metropolis Police Lieutenant Maggie Sawyer, for the episode [...] "Insurgence". As Loeb recalls, [...] "Ken [...] had written a hard-bitten, crusty kind of cop. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> he minded {{if it was a}} woman, and explained who Maggie Sawyer was and the role she would play in the future." [...] The concept for [...] "Insurgence" [...] also developed from an aspect of the Superman mythology that stemmed back to Superman’s original incarnation, which was his ability to leap tall buildings in a single bound. After their Thanksgiving break, the [...] "Smallville" [...] writers were in the writers' room when Miles Millar walked in and exclaimed, [...] "I think it's time for Clark to leap a tall building." [...] Jeph Loeb and the other writers had already been trying to develop a story that involved a hostage situation, and after Millar made his announcement the team suggested that they also pay homage to the Bruce Willis action film Die Hard. The setting for the hostage situation was LuthorCorp Plaza; the team introduced the [...] "Daily Planet", another pivotal piece of Superman lore that would one day employ Clark Kent and his alternate identity of Superman, by using it as the building that Clark uses to execute his [...] "first leap". [...] "Insurgence" [...] was actually written before [...] "Visage" [...] and [...] "Suspect", but not filmed until after both of those episodes because the team was having difficulty figuring out the logistics of producing the episode. Afterward, the episode would be scheduled to air between [...] "Visage" [...] and [...] "Suspect".|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{just the}} answer Tertius gave me, when <b>I</b> first <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> she were handsome. What {{is it that you}} gentlemen are {{thinking}} of when you are with Mrs. Casaubon?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Another {{interruption}} to my letter, {{caused by}} another {{change in the}} weather. The fog has vanished; the waiter is turning off the gas, and letting in the drab-coloured daylight. <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> it is still raining. He smiles, and rubs his hands, and says, [...] "It looks like clearing up soon, sir." [...] This man's head is gray; he has been all his life a waiter in London--and he {{can still see the}} cheerful side of things. What native strength of mind cast away on a vocation that is unworthy of it! ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him,</b> satirically, <b>if</b> he knew {{everybody}} in the island; he answered, very simply, that he did. This gives a body's mind a good substantial grip on {{the dimensions of the}} place.|$|R
2500|$|John McNamara, Esq., gave {{evidence}} {{that on the}} evening of 7 April, he believed at some time after eleven o'clock, {{he came out of the}} playhouse with Martha Ray, and having seen her [...] "in some difficulties at the playhouse", offered his help in handing her to her carriage. She took his arm. As they came out of the passage into the Covent Garden playhouse and were two steps from the carriage, he heard the report of a pistol, while Miss Ray was still holding his right arm with her left hand. She fell instantly. He thought the pistol had been [...] "fired out of wantonness" [...] and that Miss Ray had fainted. He knelt to help her, but found blood on his hands, and got her into the Shakspeare tavern. He did not see Hackman at the time, but after he had been arrested, asked him what had possessed him, and he answered [...] "that it was not a proper place to ask that question, or something to that effect... I asked him his name, and I understood from him that his name was Hackman; I think he pronounced his name with an H. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> he knew anybody. He said, he knew a Mr. Booth, in Craven-street in the Strand, and desired he might be sent for. He desired to see the lady. I did not tell him she was dead; somebody else did. I objected to his seeing her at that time. I had her removed into another room. From the great quantity of blood I had about me I got sick, and was obliged to go home. I know no more about it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The song [...] "Udi" [...] was pictured {{during this}} session which was choreographed by Longinus Fernandes, whom Bhansali had judged in Jhalak Dikhla Jaa, a popular dance based reality show. Fernandes was already {{known for his}} works in Slumdog Millionaire and Jaane Tu... Ya Jaane Na. According to him Bhansali [...] "..wanted to make the song {{different}} and unique. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> we can {{add a little bit}} of Spanish to it and give it a raw, earthy feel. He liked the idea, so we gave the whole dance a very rustic look in order to make it look as natural as possible". The choreographer added that the dance sequence was very distinct in that the audience had never seen Rai doing such steps. He went gaga over the lead actress saying that she danced like a dream. Longinus said in an interview that it [...] ".. did not take her long to learn the dance but it did take her some time to perfect it and to get into the mood of the character". In an interview Sanjay Leela Bhansali said that in the song Udi, [...] "..with such few words Sofia manages to say so much. It was my tribute to Waheeda Rahman's character in Guide."In a sequence from the film, Ethan explains Omar, that the first magic he had performed was for his mother. Bhansali said that it is inspired from his childhood days. He said, [...] "I remember my grandmother selling off the last of her silver and storing chillar in large Johnson baby powder tin. Every afternoon she would count that money and put it back. That kurr-kurr of the coins being bought out, counted and put back had to be heard again. The value of those coins doesn't exist anymore but it was an important part of my growing up." [...] Since Roshan's character, Ethan, plays a magician in the initial portion of the film, a Ukrainian magician was hired for teaching him magic tricks, after a long search for a professional magician. The magic stunts performed by Roshan and Monikangana Dutta formed the major portion of the film shot in the last schedule.|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't triumph," [...] said Jarber, folding up {{the second}} manuscript, and looking hard at Trottle. [...] "I don't triumph over this worthy creature. <b>I</b> merely <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> he is {{satisfied}} now?" ...|$|R
60|$|When Montezuma {{had made}} an end of crying his prophecies, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> humbly <b>if</b> <b>I</b> should summon to him the lords who were in {{attendance}} on him, but who stood at some distance.|$|R
60|$|Not to make Joe uneasy {{by talking}} too much, even if I {{had been able}} to talk much, <b>I</b> {{deferred}} <b>asking</b> <b>him</b> about Miss Havisham until next day. He shook his head when <b>I</b> then <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> she had recovered.|$|R

6000|$|... "I wish <b>I</b> had <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> {{he had a}} {{cure for}} your local fever," [...] said the Bishop with a laugh, [...] "for against it, {{although}} I have taken so much that my ears buzz, quinine cannot prevail." ...|$|R
60|$|I told him, {{and he was}} {{attentive}} until I had finished, {{and then}} burst out laughing again, and <b>asked</b> me if <b>I</b> was sore afterwards? <b>I</b> didn't <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> he was, for my conviction on that point was perfectly established.|$|R
40|$|February 2012. Research trip to Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is snowing when I visit Sarajevo War Theater. Up a {{steep hill}} {{not far from the}} Zetra Stadium. Where Torvill and Dean danced to Bolero in 1984. Old people {{struggle}} to stay on their feed. Children zoom downhill on handmade sledges. A young man clears the snow from the theatre's doorway. <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> this is the the theatre and he says 'This is Sarajevo War Theater, so we are used to worse than this'. In England, when it snows the show is cancelled. Here, the show must go on. Because they are used to worse than this...|$|R

60|$|He still slowly {{moved his}} finger over his upper lip, and still his eye dwelt dreamily on the glowing grate; {{thinking}} it urgent to say something, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> presently <b>if</b> he felt any cold draught from the door, which was behind him.|$|R

5000|$|The quarrel {{between the}} ILP and the Labour Party {{continued}} after the election. James Maxton sought {{to ensure that}} the ILP had freedom to advocate its own policies but the Labour Party refused to allow a party within a party. Wise was determined to keep the ILP inside the Labour Party and challenged Maxton on the issue. Maxton's response is quoted by Gordon Brown - [...] "Frank Wise <b>asks</b> me if <b>I</b> have another instrument than the Labour Party for the achievement of Socialism and if I have counted the cost. The answer is [...] "yes". <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>if</b> he has counted the cost of remaining inside and working another 38 years for a repetition of the fiasco of 1931." ...|$|R
