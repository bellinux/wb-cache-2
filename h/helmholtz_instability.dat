40|$|Boiling heat {{transfer}} system keeps {{a nuclear power plant}} safe without getting over-heated. Crisis will occur if the dissipated heat flux exceeds the critical heat flux value. This study assumes the flow boiling system at high heat flux is characterized by the existence of a very thin liquid layer, known as the “sublayer”, which is trapped between the heated surface and the vapor blankets. In the present study, it is hypothesized that the {{heat transfer}} through the liquid sublayer is dominated by the heat conduction and the sublayer is dried out due to occurrence of <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>instability</b> as the relative velocity of the vapor blanket to the local liquid in the sublayer reaches a critical value. By recognizing this hypothesis, a theoretical model for low-quality flow is developed to predict boiling heat transfer and Critical Heat Flux (CHF).

This ubiquitous phenomenon lacks a fundamental understanding. Combining experiment with model, we illustrate that the ultrathin air film trapped under the expanding liquid front triggers splashing.

30|$|The Rayleigh-Taylor {{instability}} must {{be initiated}} in the bottomside F region by some perturbations in the ionosphere or thermosphere before it grows into plasma bubbles or topside ESF irregularities. Two types of seeding perturbations have been proposed. One is atmospheric gravity wave, {{and the other}} is large-scale wave structure, a structure in the ionospheric plasma density. Shear flow in the lower F region of the equatorial ionosphere could be the source of large-scale waves or Kelvin <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>instabilities</b> (Hysell and Kudeki 2004). In numerical simulations, the initial condition is often a perturbation in the plasma density, with an amplitude of 1 – 5 % (Scannapieco and Ossakow 1976; Zalesak et al. 1982), or a gravity wave. In the simulations of gravity wave seeding (Huang and Kelley 1996 a, 1996 b; Krall et al. 2013), the only initial perturbation for the Rayleigh-Taylor instability is a gravity wave, the first-order perturbation in the neutral velocity, and no initial perturbation in the plasma density is required. The gravity wave is to seed the Rayleigh-Taylor instability but does not contribute to the linear growth rate of the instability (see Huang and Kelley 1996 a, 1996 b for details).|$|R

40|$|In {{the context}} of {{resonant}} absorption, nonlinearity has two different manifestations. The first is the reduction in amplitude of perturbations around the resonant point (wave energy absorption). The second is the generation of mean shear flows outside the dissipative layer surrounding the resonant point. Ruderman et al. [Phys. Plasmas 4, 75 (1997) ] studied both these effects at the slow resonance in isotropic plasmas. Clack et al. [Astron. Astrophys. 494, 317 (2009) ] investigated nonlinearity at the Alfven resonance, however, they {{did not include the}} generation of mean shear flow. In this present paper, we investigate the mean shear flow, analytically, and study its properties. We find that the flow generated is parallel to the magnetic surfaces and has a characteristic velocity proportional to ϵ^ 1 / 2, where ϵ is the dimensionless amplitude of perturbations far away from the resonance. This is, qualitatively, similar to the flow generated at the slow resonance. The jumps in the derivatives of the parallel and perpendicular components of mean shear flow across the dissipative layer are derived. We estimate the generated mean shear flow to be of the order of 10 kms^- 1 in both the solar upper chromosphere and solar corona, however, this value strongly depends on the choice of boundary conditions. It is proposed that the generated mean shear flow can produce a Kelvin [...] <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>instability</b> at the dissipative layer which can create turbulent motions.

40|$|The {{unrivalled}} {{spatial resolution}} of the Chandra X-ray observatory has allowed many breakthroughs {{to be made in}} high energy astrophysics. Here we explore applications of Gaussian Gradient Magnitude (GGM) filtering to X-ray data, which dramatically improves the clarity of surface brightness edges in X-ray observations, and maps gradients in X-ray surface brightness over a range of spatial scales. In galaxy clusters, we find that this method is able to reveal remarkable substructure behind the cold fronts in Abell 2142 and Abell 496, possibly the result of Kelvin <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>instabilities.</b> In Abell 2319 and Abell 3667, we demonstrate that the GGM filter can provide a straightforward way of mapping variations in the widths and jump ratios along the lengths of cold fronts. We present results from our ongoing programme of analysing the Chandra and XMM-Newton archives with the GGM filter. In the Perseus cluster we identify a previously unseen edge around 850 kpc from the core to the east, lying outside a known large scale cold front, which is possibly a bow shock. In MKW 3 s we find an unusual 'V' shape surface brightness enhancement starting at the cluster core, which may be linked to the AGN jet. In the Crab nebula a new, moving feature in the outer part of the torus is identified which moves across the plane of the sky at a speed of ~ 0. 1 c, and lies much further from the central pulsar than the previous motions seen by Chandra.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the interplay between}} jets from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) and the surrounding InterStellar Medium (ISM) through full 3 D, high resolution, Adaptive Mesh Refinement simulations performed with the FLASH code. We follow the jet- ISM system for several Myr in its transition from an early, compact source to an extended one including a large cocoon. During the jet evolution, we identify three major evolutionary stages and we find that, contrary {{to the prediction of}} popular theoretical models, none of the simulations shows a self-similar behavior. We also follow the evolution of the energy budget, and find that the fraction of input power deposited into the ISM (the AGN coupling constant) is of order of a few percent during the first few Myr. This is in broad agreement with galaxy formation models employing AGN feedback. However, we find that in these early stages, this energy is deposited only in a small fraction (< 1 %) of the total ISM volume. Finally we demonstrate the relevance of backflows arising within the extended cocoon generated by a relativistic AGN jet within the ISM of its host galaxy, previously proposed as a mechanism for self-regulating the gas accretion onto the central object. These backflows tend later to be destabilized by the 3 D dynamics, rather than by hydrodynamic (Kelvin- <b>Helmholtz)</b> <b>instabilities.</b> Yet, in the first few hundred thousand years, backflows may create a central accretion region of significant extent, and convey there as much as a few millions of solar masses.

40|$|Classical novae are {{explosive}} {{phenomena that}} take place in stellar binary systems. They are powered by mass transfer from a low-mass, main sequence star onto a white dwarf. The material piles up under degenerate conditions and a thermonuclear runaway ensues. The energy released by the suite of nuclear processes operating at the envelope heats the material up to peak temperatures of (1 - 4) × 108 K. During these events, about 10 - 4 - 10 - 5 M, enriched in CNO and other intermediate-mass elements, are ejected into the interstellar medium. To account for the gross observational properties of classical novae (in particular, a metallicity enhancement in the ejecta above solar values), numerical models assume mixing between the (solar-like) material transferred from the companion and the outermost layers (CO- or ONe-rich) of the underlying white dwarf. The nature of the mixing mechanism that operates at the core-envelope interface has puzzled stellar modelers for about 40 years. Here we investigate the role of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities as a natural mechanism for self-enrichment of the accreted envelope with core material. The feasibility of this mechanism is studied by means of the multidimensional code FLASH. Here, we present a series of 9 numerical simulations perfomed in two dimensions aimed at testing the possible influence of the initial perturbation (duration, strength, location, and size), the resolution adopted, or the size of the computational domain on the results. We show that results do not depend substantially on the specific choice of these parameters, demonstrating that Kelvin- <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>instabilities</b> can naturally lead to self-enrichment of the accreted envelope with core material, at levels that agree with observations.

Jet impingement {{is one of the}} oldest and most attractive techniques for convective process intensification where convective heating, cooling or drying is applied The present study highlights the numerical study of heat transfer characteristics of Axi symmetric incompressible Impinging Jet flow. A computational study of the impingement of a thermally turbulent jet on a solid plate has been reported. For a fixed nozzle-plate distance, the influence of the Reynolds number on the stagnation point heat transfer was investigated. The influence of the nozzle-plate distance on the stagnation point Nusselt number has also been discussed. The possibility of improving the heat transfer is carried out according to the characteristic parameters of the interaction jet and wall. At higher Reynolds numbers and even for initially laminar jets - the turbulence generated by the jet itself plays an important role in determining the heat­ transfer characteristics of impinging jets. The effect of local mean velocities and turbulence intensities on the heat transfer has been outlined, whereas the objectives of this part is to explore in more detail the influence of the turbulence characteristics of the flow on heat transfer. In a jet flow, vortices initiate in the shear layer due to Kelvin <b>Helmholtz</b> <b>instabilities.</b> Vortices, depending on their size and strength, affect the heat spread, the potential core length and the entrainment of ambient fluid A very important parameter in order to quantify this process is the heat transfer coefficient The enhancement and reduction of the local heat transfer were related to changes in the flow structure which an impinging jet was forced at different frequencies. It is important, therefore, to understand the unsteady heat transfer characteristics associated with the coherent flow structure. ksb 201...|$|R
