5|$|After signing to Mercury Records, the New York Dolls {{recorded}} the album at The Record Plant <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>with</b> producer Todd Rundgren, {{who was known}} for his sophisticated pop tastes and held a lukewarm opinion of the band. Despite stories of conflicts during the recording sessions, lead singer David Johansen and guitarist Sylvain Sylvain later said Rundgren successfully captured how the band sounded live. Their music on the album incorporates carefree rock and roll, Brill Building pop influences, and campy sensibilities, while Johansen's colloquial and ambiguous lyrics explore themes of urban youth, teen alienation, adolescent romance, and authenticity.|$|E

5|$|On {{the advice}} of Roosevelt's secretary, Malvina Thompson, Hickok then sought work <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>with</b> public {{relations}} man and politician Grover Whalen. Shortly after Franklin Roosevelt's 1936 re-election, Hickok was hired by Whalen to do publicity for the 1939 New York World's Fair. Opportunities for female employees of the Fair were limited, and she found the work unrewarding compared to her reporting days. Hickok primarily worked on promoting the fair to young people, including arranging class trips. Because Hickok rented both a country home and an apartment, she often faced financial problems despite her good salary during these years, and Roosevelt occasionally sent her small gifts of money.|$|E

5|$|The highway {{has been}} part of a state route since 1924 when it became part of New York State Route8, a road {{continuing}} northeast through Middletown and Montgomery to Newburgh. NY8 was split into two routes as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> <b>with</b> the portion of the highway south of Montgomery becoming New York State Route84. When Interstate84 (I-84) was built along a similar alignment to NY84 in the mid-1960s, the state route was renumbered again in May1966 to prevent confusion between the two roads. The section of NY84 south of Slate Hill was redesignated as NY284 {{while the rest of the}} highway was absorbed by other, pre-existing routes.|$|E
5|$|In 1816 {{his wife}} Sarah died, {{although}} {{the cause is}} unrecorded. Evans remarried two years later in April 1818 to Hetty Ward, who was many years his junior and {{the daughter of the}} New York innkeeper. In these last years Evans lived <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>with</b> his new wife. In early 1819 Evans developed an inflammation of the lungs and after a month of illness, died on April 15, 1819. Just four days prior, on April 11, news had reached him in New York that the Mars Works in Philadelphia had burned down, though his sons-in-law were committed to re-establishing the business and did so further outside of the city. Evans was buried at Zion Episcopal Church in Manhattan, but when that church was sold his body was moved several times until finally resting in 1890 in an unmarked common grave at Trinity Cemetery, Broadway at 157th Street, New York City.|$|E
5|$|When the U.S. Highway System {{was created}} in 1926, US 9 was {{designated}} in New Jersey to run from US 30 in Absecon north to the New York border in Alpine, where it continued into New York as US 9W. In New Jersey, the route followed the entirety of pre-1927 Route 4 between Absecon and Rahway, bending farther {{to the east of}} its current alignment between Lakewood and South Amboy by running closer to the Atlantic Ocean. In Rahway, US 9 joined US 1 and pre-1927 Route 1 for a concurrency north toward Newark. Past Newark, the road followed current US 1/9 Truck toward Jersey City, where US 1 and US 9 split. At this point, US 9 continued north on its current alignment in Fort Lee, where it then ran north on present-day CR 501 toward the New York border. US 9 was designated along this alignment to the New York border as the original numbering plans called for it to continue up {{the west bank of the}} Hudson River to Albany, New York, with US 109 running along the east bank of the river. However, it was instead split into two suffixed routes <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> <b>with</b> US 9W running along the west bank and US 9E running along the east bank, New Jersey had kept its alignment of US 9 to US 9W at the border in Alpine.|$|E
