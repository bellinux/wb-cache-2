5|$|In an {{interview}} with ABC News, Esch and Lefkow stated that {{they came up with}} the original idea for bacon products and their first invention, Bacon Salt, while making a <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> subject over a meal at a diner. The money for their startup came from the $5000 that Lefkow had obtained while on America's Funniest Home Videos. The idea to make bacon spreadable came from a customer's request. Together, they created interest in their products by going to numerous sporting events dressed in bacon costumes and used social networking sites to raise awareness of their company.|$|E
5|$|The Dalek {{ability to}} fly or hover {{dates back to}} The Chase, where a Dalek was implied to have taken flight, while in Revelation of the Daleks, a Dalek hovered to exterminate two victims. The {{first part of the}} 1988 serial Remembrance of the Daleks shows a Dalek who was clearly seen to hover up a flight of stairs to the Doctor's horror. Rose and Adam allude to a long-held fan <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Daleks' {{inability}} to climb stairs, and are horrified when it does so.|$|E
5|$|When Bart, Lisa, and Maggie are {{watching}} Itchy & Scratchy, Marge says {{they watch the}} same episodes all the time, while Lisa says that the Itchy & Scratchy cartoons are just pasted together from pieces of old episodes. This comment is a <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> construction of this episode; the blackboard and couch gags are taken from other episodes, there are clips from past episodes, and the interstitials are actually clips from past episodes that feature the family members talking in the kitchen. These three aspects {{support the idea of}} this episode being a clip show to the extreme.|$|E

25|$|While it was {{a popular}} {{destination}} for tourists, businesses such as delivery and taxicab services would not serve residents living on Butt Hole Road, believing that the name was simply a prank. Those living on the street would also receive phone calls from pranksters making a <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> street name, and the residents eventually had their phone number removed from public listings. The name of the street inspired authors Ed Hurst and Rob Bailey to create the book Rude Britain, a compilation of inappropriate place names in Great Britain, after reading an article about a couple who purchased {{a house on the}} street.|$|E
25|$|In {{an episode}} of the {{television}} comedy The Office U.S., which aired in April 2007, an incompetent office manager (Michael Scott) is shown relying on a hypothetical Wikipedia article for information on negotiation tactics in order to assist him in negotiating lesser pay for an employee. The tactics he used failed, as a <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> unreliability of Wikipedia and what anyone can do to change its contents. Viewers of the show tried to add the episode's mention of the page as {{a section of the}} actual Wikipedia article on negotiation, but this effort was prevented by other users on the article's talk page.|$|E

25|$|In the 2010 Winter Olympics at Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, athletes Catriona Le May Doan, Steve Nash, Nancy Greene and Wayne Gretzky were to {{simultaneously}} light {{the base of}} poles, which would then carry the flames upwards to the cauldron. However, only {{three out of four}} poles came out of the ground due to mechanical problems, resulting in inadvertently excluding Le May Doan from lighting it with the other three athletes. Because the site of the ceremonies - BC Place - was a domed stadium, Gretzky was sent via the back of a pick-up truck to a secondary site— the Vancouver Convention Centre which served at the International Broadcast Centre for these Olympics— to light a larger cauldron of a similar design located outdoors, as Olympic rules state that the flame must be in public view for the entirety of the Olympics. In the closing ceremonies, Le May Doan took part in a <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> mechanical glitch, and she was able to light the fully raised fourth pole and have the indoor cauldron relit.|$|E
25|$|NBC's {{requests}} {{became more}} unreasonable and the O'Brien camp refused them, {{such as the}} right to pull any of his final shows if the network objected to the content (i.e., a <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> conflict/NBC). Jeffrey Immelt, GE chairman, questioned why they were paying so much for a performer destined to run to another network. Negotiations continued on into O'Brien's final week; he could not confirm on-air it was indeed his final week of shows, which produced difficulty in booking the guests he desired for his final show. On January 19, multiple media outlets reported that O'Brien and NBC were close to signing a deal between US$30 and US$40 million for the host {{to walk away from the}} network. Following his Wednesday, January 20 edition, O'Brien remained at the studio until the early hours of the morning, alongside Ross and the legal counsel, trying to finalize the settlement. O'Brien wandered off, playing his guitar alone and stepping out on the deserted Universal lot at midnight, attempting to make sense of the situation. Meanwhile, Ron Meyer passingly suggested to Zucker and Gaspin, based off the public outcry, that they should stick with O'Brien; the two executives agreed to send him on his way. O'Brien signed the agreement that night and the following day the terms were made public.|$|E

500|$|The Guardian {{selected}} a spontaneous <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> South Pole {{made by an}} audience member, Khush Klare, as the [...] "undoubted highlight", having raised the loudest cheer from the audience. Klare, the son of Indian parents who migrated to Britain in the 1960s, had suggested collecting money for Griffin to be deported to the South Pole, as [...] "it's a colourless landscape that will suit you fine". Klare said that while {{he did not think}} so at first, in retrospect he thought that Question Time was the right platform for Griffin.|$|E
500|$|Shankly {{had always}} been noted for his use of psychology, both to {{encourage}} his own players and to raise doubt {{in the minds of}} opponents. One of his lasting innovations is the THIS IS ANFIELD plaque secured to the wall above the players' tunnel. Coupled with the roar of the crowd, it was designed to intimidate. In the first match after it was erected, Liverpool defeated Newcastle United 5–0, despite an attempt by Malcolm Macdonald to <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> sign. Shankly would also try to boost the confidence of his own players by announcing that a key opponent was unfit. When Kevin Keegan was about to play against Bobby Moore for the first time, Shankly told him that Moore had been out at a night club and was hung over. Afterwards, Keegan having produced an outstanding performance against the equally outstanding Moore, Shankly told him that Moore had been brilliant that day and Keegan would [...] "never play against anyone better than him".|$|E

50|$|As a result, Leno was {{initially}} {{not allowed to}} tell <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> Jackson or <b>the</b> case, which had been a fixture of The Tonight Shows opening monologue in particular. But he and his show's writers used a legal loophole by having Leno briefly step aside while stand-in comedians took the stage and told <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> trial. Stand-ins included Roseanne Barr, Drew Carey, Brad Garrett, and Dennis Miller, among others. The gag order was challenged, and {{the court ruled that}} Leno could continue telling <b>jokes</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> trial as long as he did not discuss his testimony. Leno celebrated by devoting an entire monologue to Michael Jackson jokes.|$|R
500|$|Nick Levine from Digital Spy said [...] " [...] 'What's My Name?' is {{essentially}} the long, luxuriant lovemaking session to 'Rude Boy's hard'n'fast rut... it manages to stay classy even when Drake makes a dodgy <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> 'square root of 69' and Rihanna delivers a not-so-coy reference to oral sex." [...] Megan Vick from Billboard said [...] "As much as 'What's My Name' is a joint effort, Rihanna owns the song by delivering a more polished version of her pop persona." [...] According to Jon Dolan from Rolling Stone {{with the release of}} [...] "What's My Name?" [...] as second single from the album Rihanna created [...] "a perfect little tropical storm". He continued: [...] " [...] Over dark, humid synths and swirling snare skitters, she's in full-on Caribbean-queen mode, dialing up her islander accent and rolling out a to-do list for any adult male seeking entrance into her chambers". However, he also criticized Drake's [...] "Square root of 69" [...] line, stating that Drake sounds like a nerdy guy from a fraternity while he raps it.|$|E
500|$|Under {{producer}} Davies, the {{new series}} had a faster pace {{than those of}} the classic series. Rather than four to six-part serials of 25-minute episodes, most of the Ninth Doctor's stories consisted of individual 45-minute episodes, with only three stories out of ten being two-parters. The thirteen episodes were, however, loosely connected in a series-long story arc which brought their disparate threads together in the series finale. Davies took cues from American fantasy television series such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Smallville, most notably Buffys concepts of series-long story arcs and the [...] "Big Bad". Also, like the original series, stories often flowed directly into one another or were linked together in some way. Notably, in common only with the seventh and twenty-sixth seasons of the original series, every story of the season takes place on or near Earth. This fact is directly addressed in the original novel The Monsters Inside, in which Rose and the Doctor <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> fact that all their adventures to date have taken place on Earth or on neighbouring space stations.|$|E
500|$|While {{producing}} Why Don't You?, Davies {{branched out}} within the children's department at BBC Manchester: he attended directors' courses; wrote for older audiences with {{his contributions to}} DEF II and On the Waterfront; and accompanied Keith Chegwin to Norway {{to assist in the}} production of a children's documentary about politics. The head of the children's department, Ed Pugh, offered him the chance to produce Breakfast Serials, a new series scheduled for an 8:00am slot. Breakfast Serials incorporated elements of non-sequitur comedy and popular culture references aimed at older pupils, such as a parody of Land of the Giants. He decided to leave the children's department and the BBC during the production of Breakfast Serials: a friend called him after the first episode was transmitted and observed that he had [...] "broadcast a <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> juvenilia of Emily Brontë at eight o'clock in the morning"; the conversation caused him to reflect that he was writing for the wrong audience. Davies produced three more children's series while he pursued an adult drama career: Dark Season, Century Falls, and Children's Ward.|$|E

500|$|... "Exit Through the Kwik-E-Mart" [...] {{was written}} by Marc Wilmore and {{directed}} by Steven Dean Moore {{as part of the}} twenty-third season of The Simpsons (2011–12). It spoofs the debated status of street art as a true form of art. The title is a reference to Exit Through the Gift Shop, a 2010 street art documentary by graffiti artist Banksy who produced the opening sequence of an earlier Simpsons episode titled [...] "MoneyBART" [...] (2010). The Richard Hawley song [...] "Tonight The Streets Are Ours", which is the theme song of Exit Through the Gift Shop, is included in the episode during a montage of Bart painting graffiti in Springfield. Hayden Childs of The A.V. Club noted in his review of [...] "Exit Through the Kwik-E-Mart" [...] that the [...] "reveal that the art show was a police sting gives the show a moment to <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> anti-art market theme from Exit Through The Gift Shop. Wiggum asks who would be stupid enough to pay for work that an amateur puts up for free in public, and the answer is, as in Banksy’s movie, the very wealthy, here represented by Mr. Burns." ...|$|E
500|$|Gaga {{performed}} [...] "Til It Happens to You" [...] {{live for}} the first time on October 29, 2015 at the annual amfAR gala, along with cover versions of [...] "Call Me Irresponsible", [...] "Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)" [...] and [...] "La Vie en rose". She also performed the song at the Billboard Women in Music event on December 11, 2015, where she was presented with the award for Woman of the Year. The song was also performed at an intimate gathering at the Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills. The audience consisted of the filmmakers and the rape survivors featured in the documentary. Gaga reportedly became emotional while performing the song, and thanked the filmmakers for including the song in the film. She also performed the song at the 2015 Producers Guild of America Awards, where The Hunting Ground was awarded a special recognition trophy. Actress America Ferrera introduced Gaga but she did not appear on stage for sometime leading to a few moments of [...] "nervous laughter from the audience" [...] as Ferrera tried to <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> situation, until the singer finally arrived in front of her piano on stage.|$|E
500|$|Many critics {{praised the}} {{originality}} {{of the title}} character's song in the first act about {{the head of a}} railway company, which may have been a <b>joke</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Duke of Sutherland, [...] "who was fond of running railway engines". Scott called the song a [...] "ludicrous ballad", but [...] "quite {{in the spirit of the}} well-known compositions of 'Bab,' and, as it has been fitted with a lively tune and a rattling chorus, a hearty encore was inevitable. Though the ditty was long, the audience would have been well content to hear it all over again." [...] The Pall Mall Gazette found the orchestration [...] "very novel, including, as it does, the employment of a railway bell, a railway whistle, and some new instrument of music imitating the agreeable sound of a train in motion." [...] Similarly The Sunday Times noted, [...] "The entire company join in the chorus, the music of which admirably expresses the whirl and thunder of a railway train at express speed." [...] The Era called it [...] "a screaming, whistling and shouting chorus [...] fairly brings down the house".|$|E
