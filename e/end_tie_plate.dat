40|$|A b s t r a c t PHWR fuel bundles are {{required}} to be dismantled for inspection the individual pins under highly radioactive environment of the hot cell. PHWR fuel bundle consists of 19 tubular pins, spot-welded to two <b>end</b> <b>plates</b> (<b>tie</b> <b>plates)</b> on each side. It is of about 14. 5 mm diameter and 495 mm long. It is proposed {{to carry out the}} disassembly operation by laser cutting of both the <b>tie</b> <b>plates.</b> Accordingly the experiments were conducted at LPAW Section, BARC to study the feasibility of the scheme, which gave the encouraging results. A dummy end plate was successfully cut to separate spot weld location using laser on a 3 -Axis CNC workstation. Based on the feasibility studies, a design for totally automatic and remotely operable system has been made and is proposed to be used for dismantling of PHWR fuels inside the hot cell. The system has to perform operations like moving the bundle to laser cell from charging cask, cutting both the end plates using laser to separate out 19 pins for examinations and finally chopping of each pin for dissolution of the fuel for further processing...|$|R

50|$|Several days later, Macrie and two Seashore Lines {{employees}} {{conducted a}} detailed, thorough track {{inspection of the}} entire area of the theft, which consisted primarily of the removal of <b>tie</b> <b>plates</b> and spikes, referred to as OTM (Other Track Material) in the rail industry. The inspection was performed via track car and hi-rail truck, and by walking the track. Their inspection concluded that {{the area of the}} theft encompassed approximately 6,800 linear feet of their main line. The actual theft of the OTM represented 75 percent of the total amount of <b>tie</b> <b>plates</b> and spikes in that particular section of track. In their actions to remove the <b>tie</b> <b>plates</b> and spikes, the perpetrators also damaged and destroyed numerous cross ties.|$|R

25|$|A {{rail spike}} is roughly chisel-shaped {{and with a}} flat edged point; the spike is driven with the edge {{perpendicular}} to the grain, which gives greater resistance to loosening. The main function {{is to keep the}} rail in gauge. When attaching <b>tie</b> <b>plates</b> the attachment is made as strong as possible, whereas when attaching a rail to <b>tie</b> or <b>tie</b> <b>plate</b> the spike is not normally required to provide a strong vertical force, allowing the rail some freedom of movement.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a recent investigation into Insulated Rail Joint <b>Tie</b> <b>Plate</b> fatigue failures. In particular it focuses on the results of data obtained through field strain gauge and accelerometer measurements of in-service Insulated Rail Joint <b>Tie</b> <b>Plates.</b> These measurements have identified a significant variability in the strains present in similar joints operating under identical load conditions. This variability in stress invariably has a significant influence on the life of the joints. The results of rainflow counting and a fatigue analysis are also presented...|$|R

40|$|Finite element {{models were}} {{developed}} and analyses performed for the <b>tie</b> <b>plate,</b> inner <b>tie</b> block assembly, and corner tie block assembly of a 25 port fuel rack assembly designed for installation in Pool 1 of Building 666 at the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant. These models were specifically developed {{to investigate the}} adequacy of certain welds joining components of the fuel storage rack assembly. The work scope for the task was limited to {{an investigation of the}} stress levels in the subject subassemblies when subjected to seismic loads. Structural acceptance criteria used for the elastic calculations performed were as found in the overall rack design report as issued by the rack`s designer, Holtec International. Structural acceptance criteria used for the plastic calculations performed as part of this effort were as defined in Subsection NF and Appendix F of the ASME Boiler & Pressure Vessel Code. The results of the analyses will also apply to the 30 port fuel storage rack design that is also scheduled for installation in Pool 1 of ICPP 666. The results obtained from the analyses performed for this task indicate that the welds joining the inner tie block and corner tie block to the surrounding rack structure meet the acceptance criteria. Further, the structural members (plates and blocks) were also found to be within the allowable stress limits established by the acceptance criteria. The separate analysis performed on the inner <b>tie</b> <b>plate</b> confirmed the structural adequacy for both the inner <b>tie</b> <b>plate,</b> corner <b>tie</b> <b>plate,</b> and <b>tie</b> block bolts. The analysis results verified that the inner tie and corner tie block should be capable of transferring the expected seismic load without structural failure...|$|R

2500|$|Most railroads {{with heavy}} traffic use {{continuously}} welded rails supported by sleepers attached via base plates that spread the load. A plastic or rubber pad is usually placed between the rail and the <b>tie</b> <b>plate</b> where concrete sleepers are used. The rail is usually held down to the sleeper with resilient fastenings, although cut spikes are widely used in North American practice. For much of the 20th century, rail track used softwood timber sleepers and jointed rails, and a considerable extent of this track type remains on secondary and tertiary routes. The rails were typically of flat bottom section fastened to the sleepers with dog spikes through a flat <b>tie</b> <b>plate</b> in North America and Australia, and typically of bullhead section carried in cast iron chairs in British and Irish practice. [...] The London, Midland and Scottish Railway pioneered the conversion to flat-bottomed rail and the supposed advantage of bullhead rail - that the rail could be turned over and re-used when the top surface had become worn - {{turned out to be}} unworkable in practice because the underside was usually ruined by fretting from the chairs.|$|R
