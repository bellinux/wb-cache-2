40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{disadvantages of}} ore and muck <b>haulage</b> by <b>levels</b> {{in the recent}} years of working of ROC "Sasa", district "Svinja Reka". It will suggests new ways of transportation of ore, muck, workers and materials that will be realised in two phases: 	- in the first phase will be applied combined transport (by trucks and railway); 	- in the second phase stricktly transport by trucks will be applied for the planned capacity in the mine of 750. 000 t/year. In order to realise planned capacity in the district during mine development by phases, it will be presented real necessities of transport means and number of workers aimed for transport of: ore, muck, workers and materials. At the end will be presented techno-economical parameters of mine haulage in the distict "Svinja Reka": capital investments, operational expenditures and some specific transportion costs calculated in /t of ore. ...|$|R
40|$|M. Tech. This {{dissertation}} {{details the}} research performed into {{the development of}} a smart material for roofbolt application in the mining industry. It describes the methodology and research done to design a smartbolt using a metastable austenitic stainless steel. A number of measuring devices were used to study the properties and structure of this smartbolt alloy. These devices include a Ferritescope and a Krautkramer USM 25 DAC ultrasonic sound velocity measuring instruments. The dissertation details the development, processing, laboratory and field testing of the smartbolt alloy. The designed alloy was found to have much stronger workhardening effect, causing it to have a relatively low ductility. Therefore, the threads on the roofbolts produced from this alloy were machined instead of thread rolled. It was also found that the incubation strain of the smartbolt alloy to be a' transformation in the smartbolt alloy loaded in uniaxial and biaxial tension. It was found that the von Mises effective strain criterion gives a reasonable correlation of transformation kinetics. Using the modelling method, {{it was found that the}} failure strains for the rock are not the same as those for the smartbolt alloy. All the smartbolts installed in the <b>haulage</b> tunnel (<b>level</b> 94 of mineshaft) showed a pattern of increasing longitudinal ultrasonic velocity (load) with time. This was due to the fact that mining was taking place above the area (in level 93 of the mineshaft) ...|$|R

5000|$|Block caving {{is used to}} mine massive steeply dipping orebodies (typically low grade) {{with high}} friability. An {{undercut}} with haulage access is driven under the orebody, with [...] "drawbells" [...] excavated between {{the top of the}} <b>haulage</b> <b>level</b> and the bottom of the undercut. The drawbells serve as a place for caving rock to fall into. The orebody is drilled and blasted above the undercut, and the ore is removed via the haulage access. Due to the friability of the orebody the ore above the first blast caves and falls into the drawbells. As ore is removed from the drawbells the orebody caves in, providing a steady stream of ore. [...] If caving stops and removal of ore from the drawbells continues, a large void may form, resulting in the potential for a sudden and massive collapse and potentially catastrophic windblast throughout the mine. Where caving does continue, the ground surface may collapse into a surface depression such as those at the Climax and Henderson molybdenum mines in Colorado. Such a configuration is one of several to which miners apply the term [...] "glory hole".|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} test results, data evaluations, and typical {{system performance}} expectations based on wireless electromagnetic propagation measurements {{performed in the}} MAGMA Copper Company's San Manuel mine near Tuscon, Arizona during March 30 through April 2 1981. In particular, and at the Bureau's request, this work was coordinated with testing of MF prototype vehicular radios being developed by A. R. F. Products, Inc. with USBM support under Contract H 0308004 {{as part of a}} system to be marketed by Mine Safety Appliance Co. This testing also employed a prototype vehicular antenna developed by Terry S. Cory, P. E. with USBM upport under previous Contract P 0382223. The work was performed under USBM contract J 0308012, Propagation of EM Signals in Underground Metal/Non-metal Mines. The authors wish to thank Mr. Hank Seany, Manager of Mines and Mr. Bob Zerga, Mine Superintendent who so kindly arranged for the visit. Particular thanks are given to Mr. Al Metcalf who arranged the logistical details of our underground work, and whoa forward thinking program toward improving general mine communications at MAGMA provided the test-bed context for evaluation of the prototype equipment. The authors also wish to thank Benny Jiminez, Paul Ayala, Lorenzo De La Cruz, and Kent Billhartz for their day-by-day support of the testing. Mr. Jiminez's effort was instrumental in performing the testing, and he also provided a detailed understanding of the existing multi-level, multi-frequency trolleyphone system at MAGMA. the authors are also indebted to Dr. Larry Stolarczyk of A. R. F. for numerous detailed consultations on MF technology, and who was present and participated in the majority of the testing. 1. 1 GENERAL BACKGROUND ON COPPER MINING AT MAGMA the San Manuel mine is the largest copper mine in the U. S., efficiently extracting copper and molybdenum sulfide from the low-grade San Manuel ore body. This ellipsoidal ore-shell body, with major workings located 2000 - 3000 feet mbelow the surface, has ore shell thickness varying between 100 and 1000 feet over a longitudinal extent of some 8000 feet, and with major & minor crossectional axes of about 5000 and 2500 feet respectively. The San Manuel mine operation employs in excess of 1000 men/shift with gross ore production between 60, 000 and 70, 000 tons/day. The mining operation employs the block caving technique; actively being implemented on three levels (2075, 2375, 2675 feet for haulage, and 2015, 2315, 2615 product/grizzly levels). The ore haulage is largely via D. C. trolley trains to four (3 A, 3 B, 3 C, 3 D) product shafts for skipping to the surface. An additional three shafts at two locations are used to convey men, materials, and developmental rock extractions {{into and out of the}} mine. On each <b>haulage</b> <b>level,</b> the trains carry ore an average of two miles one-way from the ore raises to the dump points. 1. 2 TOPOLOGICAL BRIEF OF THE HAULAGE LEVELS The 2375 level, on which all the testing was conducted, is illustrated i...|$|E
