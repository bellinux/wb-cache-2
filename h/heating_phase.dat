50|$|Much of {{the current}} {{research}} is into reducing the cycle time, as well as improving part quality. The most promising area is in mold pressurization. It {{is well known that}} applying a small amount of pressure internally to the mold at the correct point in the <b>heating</b> <b>phase</b> accelerates coalescence of the polymer particles during the melting, producing a part with fewer bubbles in less time than at atmospheric pressure. This pressure delays the separation of the part from the mold wall due to shrinkage during the cooling phase, aiding cooling of the part. The main drawback to this is the danger to the operator of explosion of a pressurized part. This has prevented adoption of mold pressurization on a large scale by rotomolding manufacturers.|$|E
50|$|Rotational Molding (BrE moulding) {{involves}} a heated hollow mold which {{is filled with}} a charge or shot weight of material.

The process was applied to plastics in the 1940s but in the early years was little used because it was a slow process restricted to a small number of plastics.

40|$|International audienceNearly {{water-saturated}} argillite samples (initial {{water content}} near 3. 4 wt%) were cored from an undisturbed area of an underground facility of the French Institute for Radioprotection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN), located at Tournemire (Aveyron, France). These samples {{were subjected to}} the following desiccation path: (a) A desaturation phase during which the samples were dried at ambient temperature conditions, relative humidity equal to 43 % in average and (b) a <b>heating</b> <b>phase</b> during which the same samples were heated at four temperature levels from 70 °C up to 105 °C. During both phases, the low-frequency complex resistivity (0. 18 Hz– 12 kHz) was recorded by a four-electrode device. The amplitude of the complex resistivity was extremely sensitive to water content change. At {{the end of the}} isotherm desaturation phase, it was multiplied by a factor of 3 to 5. During the <b>heating</b> <b>phase,</b> the resistivity increased by more than two orders of magnitude compared to the initial state. The percentage of Frequency Effect shows a low sensitivity to water content changes during the desaturation stage while it increased by two orders of magnitude during the <b>heating</b> <b>phase.</b> This result confirms that low-frequency spectral signature is extremely sensitive to textural changes (i. e., thermal-induced microcracking in this case) that occurred during heating. Moreover, the complex resistivity of the samples shows a strong anisotropy (a ratio of 10 between both amplitudes measured in the perpendicular directions).

40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to the {{development}} of the algorithm of the <b>heating</b> <b>phase</b> control of a rubber compound for CJSC “Voronezh tyre plant”. The algorithm is designed for implementation on basis of controller Siemens S- 300 to control the RS- 270 mixer. To compile the algorithm a systematic analysis of the heating process has been performed as a control object, also the mathematical model of the <b>heating</b> <b>phase</b> has been developed on the basis of the heat balance equation, which describes the process of heating of a heat-transfer agent in the heat exchanger and further heating of the mixture in the mixer. The dynamic characteristics of temperature of the heat exchanger and the rubber mixer have been obtained. Taking into account the complexity and nonlinearity of the control object – a rubber mixer, as well as the availability of methods and great experience in managing this machine in an industrial environment, the algorithm has been implemented using the Pontryagin maximum principle. The optimization problem is reduced to determining the optimal control (heating steam supply) and the optimal path of the object’s output coordinates (the temperature of the mixture) which ensure the least flow of steam while heating a rubber compound in a limited time. To do this, the mathematical model of the <b>heating</b> <b>phase</b> has been written in matrix form. Coefficients matrices for each state of the control, control and disturbance vectors have been created, the Hamilton function has been obtained and time switching points have been found for constructing an optimal control and escape path of the object. Analysis of the model experiments and practical research results in the process of programming of the controller have showed a decrease in the heating steam consumption by 24. 4 % during the <b>heating</b> <b>phase</b> of the rubber compound...|$|E

Images of resistivity change were calculated using data collected before, during and after the heating episode. This report will concentrate on the results obtained after heating ceased; previous reports discuss the results obtained during the <b>heating</b> <b>phase.</b> The changes recovered show a region of increasing resistivity approximately centered around the heater as the rock mass cooled. The size of this region grows with time and the resistivity increases become stronger. The increases in resistivity are caused by both temperature and saturation changes. The Waxman Smits model has been used to calculate rock saturation after accounting for temperature effects. The saturation estimates suggest that during the <b>heating</b> <b>phase,</b> a region of drying forms around the heater. During the cooling phase, the dry region has remained relatively stable. Wetter rock regions which developed below the heater during the <b>heating</b> <b>phase,</b> are slowly becoming smaller in size during the cooling phase.
