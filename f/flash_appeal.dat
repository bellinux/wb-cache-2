50|$|An {{extraterrestrial}} monster {{lands in}} Metropolis {{and begins to}} destroy the city. Batman is convinced {{that it is an}} attempt to lure him and his allies out of hiding and does not respond, dismissing <b>Flash's</b> <b>appeal</b> that they are supposed to save lives. Batman's opinion is that it is too risky to save the lives of the populace. Superman and Captain Marvel fight the monster which is Brainiac, who coerces Superman into defeat using the bottled Kryptonian city of Kandor as leverage, to crush the people's faith in superheroes. Captain Marvel is killed defending citizens from the carnage but Superman is saved when his daughter Lara appears. She has been carefully hidden since birth but now that the government knows she exists, they demand that she be handed over.|$|R
50|$|On 30 December, around 12 tons of rice, maize and {{vegetable}} oil were delivered to Hafun, {{four days after}} the tsunami. Previous attempts to deliver emergency relief failed after trucks were unable to pass tsunami damaged roads near Foar, a village of 1000 people which had been destroyed. The main sand bridge which connects the Hafun peninsula to the mainland was damaged, so the twelve tonnes were then transferred onto two four-wheel drive vehicles that managed the 60 km trip from Foar to Hafun in seven hours. The UN warned that the tsunami had worsened the situation after four years of drought in northern Somalia and that further aid was required. It distributed 200 tonnes of food rations to 12,000 people, but stated that 30,000 was the target. The UN had four teams in the area and on 4 January appealed for US$13,000,000 to assist 54,000 locals affected by the tsunami. As part of the <b>flash</b> inter-agency <b>appeal</b> of US$977,000,000 made by the UN Secretary-General on 6 January, USD10,000,000 was requested for Somalia. In February, the U.S. government made one million dollars available for tsunami relief in the country.|$|R

Measles has been one of the major causes of child deaths in humanitarian emergencies and further contributes to mortality by exacerbating malnutrition and vitamin A deficiency. Here, we review measles vaccination activities in humanitarian emergencies as documented in published literature. Our main interest was to review the available evidence focusing on the target age range for mass vaccination campaigns either in response to a humanitarian emergency or in response to an outbreak of measles in a humanitarian context to determine whether the current guidance required revision based on recent experience. Methods: We searched the published literature for articles published from January 1, 1998 to January 1, 2010 reporting on measles in emergencies. As definitions and concepts of emergencies vary and have changed over time, we chose to consider any context where an application for either a Consolidated Appeals Process or a <b>Flash</b> <b>Appeal</b> to the UN Central Emergency Revolving Fund (CERF) occurred during the period examined. We included publications from countries irrespective of their progress in measles control as humanitarian emergencies may occur in any of these contexts and as such, guidance applies irrespective of measles control goals.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{health needs}} of {{children}} and adolescents in humanitarian emergencies are {{critical to the success of}} relief efforts and reduction in mortality. Measles has been one of the major causes of child deaths in humanitarian emergencies and further contributes to mortality by exacerbating malnutrition and vitamin A deficiency. Here, we review measles vaccination activities in humanitarian emergencies as documented in published literature. Our main interest was to review the available evidence focusing on the target age range for mass vaccination campaigns either in response to a humanitarian emergency or in response to an outbreak of measles in a humanitarian context to determine whether the current guidance required revision based on recent experience. Methods We searched the published literature for articles published from January 1, 1998 to January 1, 2010 reporting on measles in emergencies. As definitions and concepts of emergencies vary and have changed over time, we chose to consider any context where an application for either a Consolidated Appeals Process or a <b>Flash</b> <b>Appeal</b> to the UN Central Emergency Revolving Fund (CERF) occurred during the period examined. We included publications from countries irrespective of their progress in measles control as humanitarian emergencies may occur in any of these contexts and as such, guidance applies irrespective of measles control goals. Results Of the few well-documented epidemic descriptions in humanitarian emergencies, the age range of cases is not limited to under 5 year olds. Combining all data, both from preventive and outbreak response interventions, about 59 % of cases in reports with sufficient data reviewed here remain in children under 5, 18 % in 5 - 15 and 2 % above 15 years. In instances where interventions targeted a reduced age range, several reports concluded that the age range should have been extended to 15 years, given that a significant proportion of cases occurred beyond 5 years of age. Conclusions Measles outbreaks continue to occur in humanitarian emergencies due to low levels of pre-existing population immunity. According to available published information, cases continue to occur in children over age 5. Preventing cases in older age groups may prevent younger children from becoming infected and reduce mortality in both younger and older age groups. </p...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the devastating}} {{earthquakes}} in Nepal in April and May 2015, humanitarian organisations have adapted a gender approach in their overall response strategy, the ‘Flash Appeal’. This should have promoted gender equality {{and reached out}} to the most vulnerable groups, but since the implementation of the strategy, several incidents of discrimination and unequal distribution of aid have been reported. Throughout this thesis I investigate: ‘Why are vulnerable women experiencing discrimination and inequality in the humanitarian response after the 2015 earthquakes in Nepal despite the promotion of gender-sensitive approaches?’ My investigation is based on qualitative interviews with lower class Dalit women who are used {{as an example of a}} group of vulnerable women. To interpret the interviews, I have drawn on theories of intersectionality, protecting vulnerable groups in disaster, the functioning of humanitarian organisations, and corruption. Because access to aid is determined by one’s resources, vulnerable women who possess limited resources have not been able to acquire aid on equal terms. The humanitarian organisations have appointed ‘local development brokers’ and local humanitarian workers to distribute aid in the districts and to express the needs of the residents including vulnerable women. But these workers and brokers, who have been appointed because of their political resources, and who mostly belong to the higher castes and classes, have used this appointment to strengthen their own position. This has been done through corruption, which is a cultural practice in Nepal. Some of the aid, intended for vulnerable women, has been allocated to local humanitarian workers and local development brokers and their familie, friends and political relations. This has been possible because the international ‘development experts’, who have been deployed since the earthquakes, have limited knowledge of the local context and because the cluster approach that the humanitarian response is based on, only allows for a certain amount of adaptability. The experts have not considered how corruption is embedded as a cultural practice in Nepal, the diversity among vulnerable women, or the social hierarchies that exist in the country – neither in their formulation of the <b>Flash</b> <b>Appeal,</b> or in the implementation of the strategy. These are identified as the reasons why vulnerable women have experienced discrimination and inequality in the humanitarian response after the earthquakes in Nepal...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundDuring {{the last}} decade, {{conflict}} or natural disasters have displaced unprecedented numbers of persons. This leads to conditions prone to outbreaks that imperil {{the health of}} displaced persons and threaten global health security. Past literature has minimally examined the association of communicable disease outbreaks with complex emergencies (CEs) and natural disasters (NDs). MethodsTo examine this association, we identified CEs and NDs using publicly available datasets from the Center for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters and United Nations <b>Flash</b> and Consolidated <b>Appeals</b> archive for 20052 ̆ 0132014. We identified outbreaks from World Health Organization archives. We compared findings to identify overlap of outbreaks, including their types (whether or not of a vaccine-preventable disease), and emergency event types (CE, ND, or Both) by country and year using descriptive statistics and measure of association. ResultsThere were 167 CEs, 912 NDs, 118 events linked to 2 ̆ 018 Both 2 ̆ 019 types of emergencies, and 384 outbreaks. Of CEs, 43...|$|R
