5|$|The {{acquisition}} of S.G. Warburg & Co., a leading British investment banking firm, in 1995 {{for the price}} of US$1.4billion signified a major push into investment banking. S.G. Warburg & Co. had established a reputation as a daring merchant bank that grew {{to be one of the}} most respected <b>investment</b> <b>banks</b> in London. However, a Warburg expansion into the U.S. had turned out flawed and costly, and talks in 1994 with Morgan Stanley about a merger had collapsed. SBC merged the firm with its own existing investment banking unit to create SBC Warburg.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{members of}} the European Union signed an {{agreement}} known as the Maastricht Treaty, under which they pledged to limit their deficit spending and debt levels. Some EU member states, including Greece and Italy, were able to circumvent these rules and mask their deficit and debt levels {{through the use of}} complex currency and credit derivatives structures. The structures were designed by prominent US <b>investment</b> <b>banks,</b> who received substantial fees in return for their services and who took on little credit risk themselves thanks to special legal protections for derivatives counterparties. Financial reforms within the U.S. since the financial crisis have only served to reinforce special protections for derivatives—including greater access to government guarantees—while minimising disclosure to broader financial markets.|$|E

5|$|John P. Costas, {{a former}} bond trader and co-head of Fixed income at Credit Suisse First Boston {{and head of}} Fixed Income Trading at Union Bank of Switzerland in 1998, was {{appointed}} CEO of UBS's investment banking division, which originated in SBC's Warburg Dillon Read division and was renamed UBS Warburg in December 2001. In an attempt {{to break into the}} elite bulge bracket of <b>investment</b> <b>banks,</b> in which UBS then had little success while rival Credit Suisse was establishing itself as a major player on Wall Street with the acquisition of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette in 2000, Costas shifted the growth strategy from acquiring entire firms to hiring individual investment bankers or teams of bankers from rival firms. Costas had followed a similar approach in building out the UBS fixed income business, hiring over 500 sales and trading personnel and increasing revenues from US$300million in 1998 to over US$3billion by 2001.|$|E

25|$|The 2008 {{financial}} credit crisis {{led to the}} collapse of several notable <b>investment</b> <b>banks,</b> such as the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers (one of the largest <b>investment</b> <b>banks</b> in the world) and the hurried sale of Merrill Lynch and the much smaller Bear Stearns to much larger banks, which effectively rescued them from bankruptcy. The entire financial services industry, including numerous <b>investment</b> <b>banks,</b> was rescued by government loans through the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). Surviving U.S. <b>investment</b> <b>banks</b> such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley converted to traditional bank holding companies to accept TARP relief. Similar situations occurred across the globe with countries rescuing their banking industry. Initially, banks received part of a $700 billion TARP intended to stabilize the economy and thaw the frozen credit markets. Eventually, taxpayer assistance to banks reached nearly $13 trillion, most without much scrutiny, lending did not increase and credit markets remained frozen.|$|E

25|$|Global {{investment}} banking revenue increased {{for the fifth}} year running in 2007, to a record US$84 billion, which was up 22% on the previous year and {{more than double the}} level in 2003. Subsequent to their exposure to United States sub-prime securities investments, many <b>investment</b> <b>banks</b> have experienced losses. As of late 2012, global revenues for <b>investment</b> <b>banks</b> were estimated at $240 billion, down about a third from 2009, as companies pursued less deals and traded less. Differences in total revenue are likely due to different ways of classifying {{investment banking}} revenue, such as subtracting proprietary trading revenue.|$|E
25|$|Many {{investment}} funds use leverage, {{the practice}} of borrowing money, trading on margin, or using derivatives to obtain market exposure in excess of that provided by investors' capital. Although leverage can increase potential returns, the opportunity for larger gains is weighed against the possibility of greater losses. Hedge funds employing leverage are {{likely to engage in}} extensive risk management practices. In comparison with <b>investment</b> <b>banks,</b> hedge fund leverage is relatively low; according to a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper, the average leverage for <b>investment</b> <b>banks</b> is 14.2, compared to between 1.5 and 2.5 for hedge funds.|$|E
25|$|Financial historians Richard Sylla and Robert E.

In this sense, it {{is the same as the}} fixed price public offers that were the traditional IPO method in most non-US countries in the early 1990s. The DPO eliminated the agency problem associated with offerings intermediated by <b>investment</b> <b>banks.</b>|$|E
