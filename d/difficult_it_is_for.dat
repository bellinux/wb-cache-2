25|$|The term {{deforestation}} has {{a meaning}} that covers crossing {{the threshold of}} forest's resilience and losing its ability to return its originally stable state. To recover itself, a forest ecosystem needs suitable interactions among climate conditions and bio-actions, and enough area. In addition, generally, the resilience of a forest system allows recovery from a relatively small scale of damage (such as lightning or landslide) of up to 10 per cent of its area. The larger the scale of damage, the more <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> the forest ecosystem to restore and maintain its balance.|$|E
25|$|Many {{of these}} {{projects}} were not well adapted to traditional adivasi culture and beliefs so about 80 per cent of the tribal population is still living in abject poverty. Attappadi demonstrates how <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> a modern government development process to succeed in a traditional self-sustaining indigenous peoples (adivasi) community. Tribal people are {{a majority of the}} Attappadi population but have a high illiteracy rate of 49.5 per cent and a lack of political and administrative awareness. The majority of project managers and new land owners are from other parts of Kerala, Tamil Nadu and other states.|$|E
25|$|The {{quality of}} sleep may be {{evaluated}} from an objective and a subjective point of view. Objective sleep quality refers to how <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> {{a person to}} fall asleep and remain in a sleeping state, and how many times they wake up during a single night. Poor sleep quality disrupts the cycle of transition between the different stages of sleep. Subjective sleep quality in turn refers {{to a sense of}} being rested and regenerated after awaking from sleep. A study by A. Harvey et al. (2002) found that insomniacs were more demanding in their evaluations of sleep quality than individuals who had no sleep problems.|$|E

2500|$|... "To {{understand}} and appreciate Fatima is to {{understand and}} appreciate Portuguese Catholicism". Jeffrey S. Bennett takes note of how, starting in the 1930s, the image of Our Lady of Fatima developed into a rallying point for anti-communism, an idea that spread far beyond the Iberian peninsula. Martindale mentions a concept where the fruits of a phenomenon {{are more important than}} its historical origins. Therefore, it is possible to conceive of a vibrant cultus where the strength of the devotion, shrine, or pilgrimage, can outweigh uncertainties regarding its origin. According to Maunder, Fatima demonstrates not only how seriously Catholics took [...] "the revelations of an enclosed nun remembering visions she had experienced at the age of ten, but also show how <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> the hierarchy to manage a movement of popular piety, despite critics claims of manipulation. Following Fatima, there would be proliferation of apocalyptic manifestations, such as at Necedah.|$|E

50|$|Defeasibility {{had always}} been closely related to argument, rhetoric, and law, except in epistemology, where the chains of reasons, and the origin of reasons, were not often discussed. Nicholas Rescher's Dialectics {{is an example of}} how <b>difficult</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> {{philosophers}} to contemplate more complex systems of defeasible reasoning. This was in part because proponents of informal logic became the keepers of argument and rhetoric while insisting that formalism was anathema to argument.|$|R
