40|$|Sustainability’ is {{a policy}} mantra of modern governments {{particularly}} in relation to natural resources. The traditional connection between land ownership and access to natural resources, such as forestry, flora, fauna, minerals, water and energy, {{has given rise to}} an unprecedented number of restrictions and obligations on land owners in their use of the land and resources. The growing numbers of statutory exceptions and restrictions on rights of ownership and use of a fee simple holder presents serious challenges for the utility of the Torrens register, which was originally designed to record private interests in land or affecting title to land. Advocates proposing uniform Torrens legislation should give consideration to an alignment of government policies emphasising sustainability as a core requirement of effective land use and management, and the core Torrens concepts <b>of</b> <b>indefeasibility</b> and security <b>of</b> <b>title.</b> This article examines the challenges for a uniform Torrens system created by increases statutory regulation of land ownership and makes recommendations about how an effective alignment of sustainability objectives and Torrens principles may be achieved...|$|R

40|$|The {{principle}} of <b>indefeasibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>title</b> {{is one of}} the main features and attributes of the Torrens System of conveyance. It involves the proposition that once a person is registered as proprietor of a certain estate or interest in land he or she acquires a title that cannot be vitiated except as prescribed in the legislation establishing the system. The indefeasibility principle was designed not only to protect title of the registered proprietor from unregistered interests, but also to save persons dealing with registered land from the trouble and expense of going behind the Register Book in order to investigate the validity of title or possible rival claims to the land. The aim was to simplify and expedite the process of transfer of title to land. Yet, almost thirty years ago one William Kaputin, then a recent law graduate of the University of Papua New Guinea, made a scathing attack against the operation of the {{principle of}} <b>indefeasibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>title</b> in his country. He claimed that the Tolai people of New Britain's Gazelle Peninsula viewed the principle of indefeasibility with contempt because it frustrated all their attempts to recover land they lost at the hands of the colonial administration. Kaputin charged that the doctrine of indefeasibility was deliberately introduced in PNG by the Australian colonial administration in order to protect foreigners' land titles, which both the administration and the courts knew were acquired by dubious means. He demanded that in the interest of justice for the indigenous people it was necessary to review the operation of this doctrine in Papua New Guinea...|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of the statutory standard sale and purchase agreements as prescribed under Schedules G, H, I and J of the Housing Development (Control and Licensing) Regulations 1989 (‘the said agreements’) is mandatory for all house purchases from licensed housing developers in Peninsular Malaysia. However, according to the researcher’s Ph. D in law thesis, the said agreements are void under Islamic Law due {{to the existence of}} gharar al-fahish. The reason for this gharar is {{because of the lack of}} terms and conditions in the said agreements which can protect the rights and interests of purchasers especially when the housing projects are abandoned. Due to the invalidity of the said agreements, this may also affect the subsequent dealings and transactions for instance in the housing loan transactions with Islamic banks. Furthermore due to its invalidity the said agreements may become ‘insufficient and void instruments incapable of registration’ which cannot guarantee <b>indefeasibility</b> <b>of</b> the subsequent <b>titles</b> and interests in land to the interested parties under section 340 of the National Land Code 1965 (NLC). This research has identified certain terms and conditions in the said agreements which purportedly have not complied with the Islamic Law. This research has proposed certain shariah compliant model agreements for the said agreements. These shariah compliant model agreements would provide adequate protection to purchasers including when the housing projects are abandoned by the housing developers. The research methods used are purely shariah legal research and comparative research methodologies, viz comparative between the shariah principles and the conventional law (common law and Malaysian law) principles. These two methods were blended with social research method. Thus, this research is a hybrid of pure shariah legal, comparative legal and socio-legal research methodologies. This research has found that the said agreements are void according to the Quran, Sunnah and Qiyas as the said agreements contain gharar al-fahish elements as against the government and the vendor developers. However, despite inherently the said agreements are void under Islamic Law, they are still good and valid, at least, as against the purchasers due to hardship (mashaqqah) through the principles of maqasid al-shariah, maslahah al-mursalah, uruf and istihsan. This research has recommended shariah compliant model agreements purporting to replace the said agreements. The authorities, especially the housing authority (Ministry of Housing and Local Government), Islamic Banks and the public purchasers at large may benefit from the findings and recommendations of this research, especially in dealing with the problems of abandoned housing projects in Peninsular Malaysia...|$|R

Conditional perfection (henceforth CP) is the natural language tendency to perfect conditionals (if A then C) into their corresponding biconditionals (if and only if A, then C) through the mediation of an if not-A, then not-C conditional. In the literature there is some controversy regarding the pragmatic principle by which CP is derived, {{but there seems to}} be silent agreement about the defeasibility of CP.

40|$|The {{question}} of <b>indefeasibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>title</b> - {{should it be}} immediate or should it be deferred? - has, for many years, but significantly not for the last 15 - been a hotly debated topic among academics of property law in New Zealand. Under the principle of deferred indefeasibility a title obtained fraudulently can be defeated until it is "perfected" by a subsequent bona fide transfer for value. In contrast, the immediate indefeasibility theory provides that registration will immediately validate a transfer, {{even if it is}} forged or otherwise void or voidable. This latter theory was confirmed in the landmark decision of Frazer v Walkel 3 in 1967. Many subsequent critical appraisals explored the consequences of the judgment. However, little academic writing on the topic is apparent in any of the New Zealand periodicals from the mid- 1970 s. Does this imply that the principle of immediate indefeasibility is "set in stone" in this country...|$|E

This paper addresses some of these criticisms, positing first that s 81 does in fact grant the District Land Registrar a wide discretion to correct or cancel titles which have been gained fraudulently or wrongfully, and secondly that this discretion should be exercised if an appropriate case surfaces. Such an exercise {{is supported by the}} approach taken in other Torrens jurisdictions and can be regulated through the adoption of a number of simple guidelines, to be considered during any exercise of discretion under s 81. This will reduce the risk of any uncertainty arising from a wide interpretation of s 81 and ensure that the overall justice of the case is the central consideration of any exercise of discretion...|$|E
40|$|Neither the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) nor {{the various}} State and Territory real {{property}} Acts adequately address the effect upon native {{title of the}} administrative act of registering an instrument creating or affecting ordinary (non-native title) interests in land under the Torrens system of land registration. The possibility that native title qualifies the concept of <b>indefeasibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>title</b> in two situations is examined in this paper. The first possible qualification relates {{to whether or not}} registration of a statutory grant of land made pursuant to land rights legislation attracts the indefeasibility provisions of the Torrens statutes vis a vis native title. The second possible qualification stems from the Federal Court decision in Hayes v Northern Territory. It relates to whether or not registration of an invalid 'previous exclusive possession act', which is relied upon to confirm the extinguishment of native title, confers an indefeasible title on the registered proprietor in relation to native title. The practical legal implications of classifying native title as an exception to indefeasibility and as a ground for invoking the deferred indefeasibility theory are considered. Two theoretical rationales underlying a native title exception to indefeasibility are also suggested...|$|E
40|$|The terms “property” and “sustainability” call forth {{a number}} of {{different}} thematic enquiries. Perhaps the strongest of these is the relationship between property and environmental sustainability. The latter decades of the 20 th century saw a shift in focus from the recognition of private property rights in natural resources in order to facilitate economic development to the idea of the protection of the environment through ecologically sustainable development. The recent unprecedented floods in the eastern States of Australia, fires in Western Australia, destructive earthquakes in New Zealand and the devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan, serve to highlight this shift in emphasis. Many of the chapters in this compilation focus on this important aspect of the property and sustainability relationship. However, other chapters address broader themes including: the sustainability and workability of the Torrens system and its cornerstone, <b>indefeasibility</b> <b>of</b> title; the sustainability of emerging trends in securities law; and the sustainability of two long-established principles of property law, the doctrine of conversion and the rule against perpetuities. Property and Sustainability: Selected Essays is an edited compilation of papers presented by highly regarded Australian and international academics at the Australasian Property Law Teachers Conference 2010 covering the theme of property and sustainability. This collection follows on from Property and Security: Selected Essays, an edited compilation of the papers delivered at the 2009 conference. Both of these collections are an important resource for students, practitioners and academic researchers. The chapters in these two compilations explore the complexities in the law and make arguments for legal change. The reform recommendations make these publications highly relevant to policy makers within Australia, at both Federal and State level. [Book Synopsis...|$|R

40|$|Every {{country has}} land policy and land {{planning}} systems to improve social, physical, spatial and economic imbalance. Land policies provide the framework, direction and continuity of decisions {{made for the}} function {{of land in the}} implementation of national development plans which involve local, state and regional plans. In Malaysia, land policies are implemented within a broader framework, which is supervised by the government. Some land policies were implemented based on the National Land Code (NLC). The National Land Code, 1965 came into force on 1 st January 1966 to administer all land matters in Peninsular Malaysia and the Federal Territory of Labuan while Sabah and Sarawak continued to use the Sabah Land Ordinance 1930 and Sarawak Land Code 1958 respectively. The purpose of the NLC is to ensure the uniformity of land policy and land law with respect to land tenure, registration, transfer, charges, leases, easements and other interests and rights to land. Rapid development and various needs for securing proprietors' interests have put a lot of demands on land administration. A new three-dimensional (3 D) cadastral system was proposed to cater for above and below surface cadastral objects and to enable the registration of real properties that are not limited to the land surface. The 3 D approach for cadastral and land registration systems can provide a better means to manage modern cadastral objects. There are two organisations within Peninsular Malaysia responsible for managing and maintaining the land administration system, namely, the Department of Survey and Mapping Malaysia (DSMM) and the District Land Offices which are responsible for the cadastral survey and ownership rights respectively. Both organisations have their own information systems called eLand in District Land Offices and eCadastre in DSMM. There are three arguments to further improve the land administration system towards e-Government services - government guarantee of <b>indefeasibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>title</b> to private land; information integration for good governance of land administration; systematic and accurate recording for land taxation purposes as a source of important state revenue. Those arguments clearly demonstrated the need for the Land Administration Domain Model (LADM). The LADM is an international standard for land administration purposes. Malaysia does not have a standard model for land administration. Standardisation of land administration within a country should meet the international standard, this will hasten land transactions between international entities.
