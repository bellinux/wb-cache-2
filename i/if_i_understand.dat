500|$|Disagreements {{about the}} {{ownership}} of the story ultimately led Moore to sever ties with DC Comics. Not wanting to work under a work for hire arrangement, Moore and Gibbons had a reversion clause in their contract for Watchmen. Speaking at the 1985 San Diego Comic-Con, Moore said: [...] "The way it works, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> it, is that DC owns it for the time they're publishing it, and then it reverts to Dave and me, so we {{can make all the}} money from the Slurpee cups." [...] For Watchmen, Moore and Gibbons received eight percent of the series' earnings. Moore explained in 1986 that his understanding was that when [...] "DC have not used the characters for a year, they're ours." [...] Both Moore and Gibbons said DC paid them [...] "a substantial amount of money" [...] to retain the rights. Moore added, [...] "So basically they're not ours, but if DC is working with the characters in our interests then they might as well be. On the other hand, if the characters have outlived their natural life span and DC doesn't want to do anything with them, then after a year we've got them and we can do what we want with them, which I'm perfectly happy with." ...|$|E
2500|$|What {{will be your}} Lordships astonishment when I {{tell you}} that an act passed {{for the express purpose}} of gratifying the Canadians & which was {{supposed}} to comprehend all that they either wished or wanted is become the first object of their discontent & dislike. English officers to command them in time of war, & English Laws to govern them in time of Peace, is the general wish. the former they know to be impossible (at least at present) & by the latter <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> them right, they mean no Laws & no Government whatsoever – in the mean time it may be truly said that Gen. Carleton had taken an ill measure of the influence of the seigneurs & Clergy over the lower order of people whose Principle of conduct founded in fear & the sharpness of authority over them now no longer exercised, is unrestrained, & breaks out in every shape of contempt or detestation of those whom they used to behold with terror & who gave them I believe too many occasions to express it. And they on their parts have been and are too much elated with the advantages they supposed they should derive from the restoration of their old Privileges & customs, & indulged themselves in a way of thinking & talking that gave very just offence, as well to their own People as to the English merchants.|$|E
