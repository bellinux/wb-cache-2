This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract During surgical procedures, abdominal swabs are routinely used to adsorb {{blood from the}} operation field and for the retention of tissues and organs. Due to the material characteristics, abdominal swabs exhibit a slight procoagulant activity, which is usually desirable and mostly harmless. However, during cardiac surgery with heart–lung machine (HLM) support, abnormal clot for-mation may result in life-threatening thromboembolic complications. Therefore, a simple clotting test (SCT) al-lowing in vitro detection of abdominal swabs with elevated hypercoagulant potency {{in the presence of}} <b>heparinized</b> human <b>blood</b> was developed and validated.

HCV-RNA was measured routinely in plasma collected from <b>heparinized</b> <b>blood</b> of patients with chronic hepatitis C and varying results were found. In this study, HCV-RNA was detected in {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMCs) and in serum of 16 out of 17 anti-HCV positive patients with chronic hepatitis C. In contrast, HCV-RNA was found in plasma collected from <b>heparinized</b> <b>blood</b> of only one of these seventeen patients. The addition of heparin to known HCV-RNA containing solutions before reverse-transcription and separately before PCR, demonstrated the inhibitory effect of heparin on the reverse transcription and amplification reaction. Furthermore, evidence is provided that plasma for PCR should be collected preferably into EDTA vacutainers.

To one group of blood samples, 5 mM monoiodine acetic acid (MIAA) was added to block in vitro phagocytosis. The Pmn were examined {{for the presence of}} IgG, IgM, and HBsAg by the immunofluorescence technique. PMN from defibrinated blood of SLE patients showed in up to 80 % immunoglobulin (Ig) -inclusions. However, addition of 5 mM MIAA reduced the number of Ig-containing PMN to at most 40 %, which levels were equal to numbers found in specimens from <b>heparinized</b> <b>blood.</b> Addition of 5 mM MIAA to <b>heparinized</b> <b>blood</b> did not reduce the number of PMN with Ig inclusions.

In PMN incubated with HBsAg-anti HBs immune complexes with an antigen antibody ratio between 5 and 0 - 2, both HBsAg and IgG could be detected. It is concluded that Ig inclusions in PMN from <b>heparinized</b> <b>blood</b> from SLE patients are due to in vivo phagocytosis, presumably of circulating immune complexes.

We investigated the effect of 3 commonly used solutions—Ringer's solution, normal saline solution, and heparinized whole blood—on in vitro endothelial and contractile functions of the human radial artery. Methods: Radial artery segments were harvested, cut into 3 -mm rings, and stored in unoxygenated Ringer's solution, normal saline solution, or <b>heparinized</b> whole <b>blood</b> for 45 minutes. Rings stored in Krebs solution were used as controls. The rings were then mounted and stretched to an optimal resting tension in oxygenated Krebs solution at 37 °C. Contraction responses to potassium, norepinephrine, and serotonin and relaxation responses to acetylcholine, verapamil, and nitroprusside were evaluated. Results: Fifty-six radial artery ring segments from 14 patients (n = 7 rings for each contaction-relaxation curve) were studied. Equilibrated resting tension was 9. 6 ± 0. 3 mN (5. 9 ± 0. 2 g), and resting internal circumference was 6. 4 ± 0. 2 mm. Absolute maximum contraction to potassium was significantly less in rings stored in normal saline solution than in rings stored in control solution (10. 7 ± 0. 6 g vs 14. 5 ± 0. 6 g, P <. 01; 95 % confidence intervals, 0. 9 - 6. 9). There {{was no difference in}} the contraction to norepinephrine (P =. 11) and serotonin (P =. 25) among the 3 solutions compared with the control solution. Rings stored in <b>heparinized</b> whole <b>blood</b> had significantly greater endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine (P <. 007), whereas those stored in normal saline solution had reduced responses. Endothelium-independent relaxation to verapamil and nitroprusside were similar among the 3 solutions.

Methods:Autogenous femoral veins of dogs were immersed in heparinised saline solution (n = 18) or <b>heparinized</b> autogenous <b>blood</b> (n = 18). After immersion, the grafts were implanted into bilateral femoral artery, and were retrieved 1 day to 4 – 8 weeks after implantation. Results:For the grafts immersed in the heparinised saline solution, the values for %area of endothelial cell coverage before implantation, and at 1 day, 1 week, and 4 weeks after implantation were 44. 9 %, 6. 2 %, 14. 5 %, and 81. 3 %, respectively. For the grafts immersed in heparinised autogenous blood, the values were 73. 5 %, 20. 6 %, 79. 2 % and 95. 5 %, respectively. However, such relatively rapid speed of Re-E slowed down considerably after 1 week following implantation in this group. Conclusions:The use of <b>heparinized</b> autogenous <b>blood</b> is strongly recommended as a preparation media for autogenous vein grafts. Almost all of the endothelial cells fall away in the earlier period after implantation and regenerate multifocally and irregularly.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to detect the {{influence}} of (1) storage period of <b>heparinized</b> <b>blood,</b> (2) type of blood and presence of contaminant, (3) application mode of cleansing agents, and (4) efficacy of cleansing agents on contaminated enamel and dentin during the adhesion process of a one-step adhesive system. Materials and Methods: One hundred four human molars were sectioned into halves along the long axis for enamel and dentin tests. Heparinized and fresh blood were obtained from the same donor, applied and dried to maintain a layer of dry blood on the top of samples. The cleansing agents used were hydrogen peroxide, anionic detergent, and antiseptic solution. A one-step adhesive system (Clearfil S 3 Bond) was applied on the dental surface, and composite resin cylinders were built up using Tygon tubing molds. After 24 h, the mu SBS test (1 mm/min) and fracture analysis were performed. Results: There was no statistically significant difference in bond strength values regarding the storage period of <b>heparinized</b> <b>blood</b> and the types of blood. Groups without contamination presented higher bond strengths than contaminated groups. The application mode of the cleansing agents had no influence on bond strength results. There was no statistically significant difference among cleansing agents and they were as effective as a water stream in counteracting the effect of blood contamination. Conclusion: <b>Heparinized</b> <b>blood</b> can be used as a contaminant for up to one week, and it is a reliable procedure to standardize the contaminant.

40|$|Background: the use {{of whole}} blood (WB) in {{studying}} lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced cellular activation preserves the milieu in which LPS-cell interaction occurs in vivo. However, little information is available on using such a system at a single-cell level. We evaluated LPS binding and cell activation in WB by using flow cytometry. the influence of heparin or EDTA as anticoagulants was also addressed. Methods: Blood was obtained from healthy donors in EDTA and/or heparin tubes. Biotinylated LPS (LPSb) {{was used to evaluate}} cell binding of LPS in WB. Cells were surface stained with appropriate antibodies and LPSb was detected by adding streptavidin-allophycocyanin (APC). LPS-induced activation was evaluated by the expression of surface activation markers and by the detection of intracellular tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Results: LPSb bound promptly to monocytes in EDTA- and heparin-treated blood. in EDTA-treated blood, membrane-bound LPSb decreased after 60 min of incubation, whereas it remained detectable in <b>heparinized</b> <b>blood</b> during the 6 h of incubation. LPS induced TNF-alpha and enhanced the expression of HLA-DR in monocytes, as well as the expression of CD 69 in T and B lymphocytes. Induction of both TNF-alpha in monocytes and CD 69 in lymphocytes was more efficient in <b>heparinized</b> <b>blood.</b> Conclusion: Detection of membrane-bound LPSb on monocytes differed in EDTA or heparin-treated blood, and cell activation was better obtained in <b>heparinized</b> <b>blood.</b> (C) 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Under ideal circumstances, {{creation}} of the anastomosis during free flap transfer is a routine task and can be performed under short ischemia time. However, vessels may be in suboptimal state due to atherosclerosis, radiotherapy or trauma, increasing difficulties regarding receptor vessel identification, and anastomosis which in turn may lead to lengthening of ischemia time resulting in postoperative wound problems or even flap loss. In the current pilot study, a modified heart-lung machine was assembled to achieve continuous oxygenated extracoporeal perfusion using porcine myocutaneous rectus abdominis flaps, aimed at minimizing tissue damage occurring during ischemia time. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Different pilot test groups with n = 2 were created, including oxygenated perfusion with <b>heparinized</b> autologous <b>blood</b> or organ preservation solutions. Control groups included short flush with preservation solution followed by cold storage. RESULTS: Flaps were successfully attached to the modified heart-lung machine while maintaining stable flow throughout the 24 -h experiments. Flaps undergoing continuous oxygenated perfusion with preservation solutions showed minimal or no signs of cell necrosis during the 24 -h experiment, in contrast to using <b>heparinized</b> autologous <b>blood</b> or flushing and cold storage. CONCLUSIONS: The use of a modified heart-lung machine for oxygenated perfusion of free flaps provides new possibilities to minimize tissue damage during ischemia time, and further study of its use is warranted...|$|R
30|$|Two {{weeks prior}} to {{undergoing}} the PL epidural procedure, patients were restricted {{from the use of}} corticosteroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The rationale for the restriction is based on the concern for the inhibitory effect of such drugs on healing potential (Bondesen et al. 2004). On either the day of or day prior to the procedure, patients presented to the clinic for a venous blood draw, wherein approximately 60  mL of <b>heparinized</b> venous <b>blood</b> was collected. The <b>heparinized</b> venous <b>blood</b> was processed by hand in a sterile ISO- 5 class biologic safety cabinet. No commercial automated systems designed to produce platelet rich plasma were used.

The resultant liquid lying above the concentrated solids (supernatant) was red blood cell / white blood cell poor and platelet rich. This 3 - 10  cm 3 supernatant was extracted via pipette. Volume of supernatant varies based on patient’s hematocrit levels. All samples were then placed in a −  80 ° Celsius freezer for 5 – 10  min followed by thaw.

In the present investigation release of 6 -keto-PGF 1 [alpha], the stable breakdown product of prostacyclin, was quantitated from canine veins perfused ex vivo for 15 minute periods, using three different perfusates: 1) Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS), 2) 20 % platelet poor plasma (PPP) derived from <b>heparinized</b> <b>blood,</b> in HBSS, and 3) 20 % PPP in HBSS with added arachidonic acid (AA).
