Both machines can rip, crosscut, do simple and compound miters, dado, mold or shape, make tenons, make open mortises, taper cut, and rabbet. The radial arm saw requires less clearance or space in the shop to handle long stock, since it only requires clearance on the sides, whereas a table saw needs clearance to the sides, in front and at the back. The radial saw is perfectly efficient backed up against a wall, whereas the table saw needs to be placed {{in the center of the}} shop to give all around clearance. With some accessories the former can be used as a shaper, a disk or drum sander, a grinder, a surface planer, a router, a horizontal boring machine and even as a power unit for a lathe; whereas a table saw's secondary uses are limited to shaper and <b>disk</b> <b>sander.</b> The major shortcoming of most current radial arm saws for home-use is that, most radial arm saws that have been built after the early 1960s are manufactured with stamped sheet metal parts and are machined to loose tolerances, hence they are not precise for doing accurate work without 'tuning'. A high-quality radial arm saw has carefully machined track arm ways and locking mechanisms, and a motor that runs very smoothly; under 'no-load' conditions most of the sound and vibration will originate from the whisper/whistling and the imbalance of the saw blade upon the arbor.|$|E
50|$|During {{the twentieth}} century, the Engelberg Huller Company {{began to make}} {{grinders}} plus belt and <b>disk</b> <b>sanders,</b> all intended primarily for metalworking and woodworking. On March 23, 1953, Leo Schaller, patentee, and Engelberg Huller Co., Inc. as assignee, applied for U.S. Patent 2,791,070 which was granted on May 7, 1957 for an Abrading machine (woodworking or sanding machine).|$|R
50|$|At {{some time}} {{during the twentieth century}} the Engelberg Huller Company began to make {{grinders}} plus belt and <b>disk</b> <b>sanders,</b> all intended primarily for metalworking. Some time between 1957 and 1971, the company name was shortened to Engelberg, Inc. and by 1971 the name was amended, to Sundstrand-Engelberg, Inc. of Liverpool, New York. During 1974, the name changed to Sundstrand Syracuse, Inc. of Syracuse, New York, and Sundstrand Corp. of Rockford, Illinois.|$|R
50|$|A {{miter gauge}} is a device used for holding {{workpieces}} at a set angle while being cut on table saws, band saws or sanded on stationary <b>disk</b> <b>sanders.</b> The miter gauge slides in a slot on the worktable (known as a miter slot) {{on the machine}} being used. Typically, the Miter Gauge and the workpiece are held together by hand and moved across the worktable making the cut (or sanded edge). Although, there are more sophisticated miter gauges that {{have the ability to}} clamp the workpiece or have adjustable stops for repetitive machining of workpieces.|$|R
50|$|After {{considering}} which {{material is}} {{best suited for}} an object, mount makers then fabricate a mount to the specification of the object using hand-held tools and general shop equipment. Mount makers must be knowledge about the many different choices for soldering and welding, saws, buffers, and grinders and skilled in their use. Tools more specific to fabrication of basic mounts include a 10-inch to 1 inch Band saw, either a freestanding or bench top drill press, a 1 inch by 8 inch <b>Disk</b> combination <b>sander,</b> and a vacuum with either a minimum 5 micron filter or a HEPA filter.|$|R
