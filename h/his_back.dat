5|$|For reasons {{related to}} class and race, {{it had been}} unthinkable before the war for the West Indies to appoint a black Test captain, but the postwar world saw social and {{political}} changes in the Caribbean. Although opinion was still divided over the merits of a black captain, Headley was appointed {{as one of the}} West Indian captains for the series against the England team which toured the Caribbean in 1948. Crab Nethersole, the former Jamaican captain and member of the Board of Control for cricket, argued Headley should be outright captain but a compromise was reached. Headley was scheduled to captain the first and fourth Test matches, played in Barbados and Jamaica, and the white players Gerry Gomez and John Goddard were given the captaincy of the second and third matches. In the event, Headley only played in the first Test. In the first innings, he scored 29 but strained <b>his</b> <b>back</b> while fielding. Batting towards the end of West Indies' second innings, he scored seven not out. Rain helped England to draw the match. Headley's back caused him to miss the second and third Tests, but he was fit enough to play for Jamaica when the tourists arrived there to play two games against the island before the fourth and final Test. After the first island game, in which he scored 65, Headley's request to miss the second match to rest <b>his</b> <b>back</b> was refused by the Jamaican Board. He scored 36 not out, but aggravated <b>his</b> <b>back</b> pains and he withdrew from the final Test. West Indies won this game under the captaincy of Goddard, who had earlier led West Indies to victory in the third Test. He was subsequently chosen to captain West Indies in India in 1948–49, despite Headley's availability and apparently superior claims to the position.|$|E
