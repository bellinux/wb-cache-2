50|$|In 1973 Weis-Fogh {{devised a}} {{mathematical}} model explaining how extremely small insects such as the thrips or chalcid wasps like Encarsia formosa could fly using clap-and-fling, where conventional steady state aerodynamics did not apply. These insects gain lift by creating vortices near their wings, {{at the price of}} the wear and tear from repeated clapping. The British mathematician Sir James Lighthill named this the Weis-Fogh mechanism of lift generation. His 1973 paper Quick Estimates of <b>Flight</b> <b>Fitness</b> in Hovering Animals, Including Novel Mechanisms for Lift Production has been cited over 1000 times.|$|E
40|$|SummaryIn {{an attempt}} to guide {{physicians}} asked by respiratory patients for advice on <b>flight</b> <b>fitness,</b> the British Thoracic Society (BTS) have published guidelines on fitness to fly. The main potential hazard is hypobaric hypoxia, and efforts {{have focused on the}} prediction of hypoxia in individuals. The present study examines 10 years’ experience of hypoxic challenge (HC) of respiratory patients to evaluate if the guidelines recommended by the BTS are appropriate. One hundred and eighteen patients (67 female, mean age 65. 6 ± 11. 4 (SD) years) were referred for assessment. Patients underwent HC using a 40 % Venturi mask supplied with 100 % N 2 which lowered the FiO 2 to 15. 1 %. A further 13 patients on long-term oxygen therapy also underwent HC whilst receiving supplemental oxygen. In agreement with the BTS guidelines, all patients with a sea level SpO 2 of over 95 % maintained their SpO 2 ≥ 90 % during HC. One third of patients with sea level SpO 2 of 92 – 95 %, but no other risk factor (as defined by the guidelines) also desaturated below 90 % during HC. Thirty-two patients were assessed as fit to fly with supplemental oxygen. Our results support the BTS guidelines for patients with a sea level SpO 2 > 95 % but suggest that some revision is required for patients with a sea level SpO 2 of 92 – 95 %. It was not possible to predict from either initial SpO 2 or spirometry which individuals were at risk of desaturation below 90 % during hypoxic challenge...|$|E
40|$|Decompression {{sickness}} (DCS) is {{a serious}} risk to astronauts performing extravehicular activity (EVA). To reduce this risk, the addition of ten minutes of moderate exercise (75 % VO 2 pk) during prebreathe {{has been shown to}} decrease the total prebreathe time from 4 to 2 hours and to decrease the incidence of DCS. The overall purpose of this pilot study was to develop an exercise protocol using flight hardware and an in-flight physical fitness cycle test to perform prebreathe exercise before an EVA. Eleven subjects volunteered to participate in this study. The first objective {{of this study was to}} compare the steady-state heart rate (HR) and oxygen consumption (VO 2) from a submaximal arm and leg exercise (ALE) session with those predicted from a maximal ALE test. The second objective was to compare the steady-state HR and V 02 from a submaximal elastic tube and leg exercise (TLE) session with those predicted from the maximal ALE test. The third objective involved a comparison of the maximal ALE test with a maximal leg-only (LE) test to conform to the in- <b>flight</b> <b>fitness</b> assessment test. The 75 % VO 2 pk target HR from the LE test was significantly less than the target HR from the ALE test. Prescribing exercise using data from the maximal ALE test resulted in the measured submaximal values being higher than predicted VO 2 and HR. The results of this pilot study suggest that elastic tubing is valid during EVA prebreathe as a method of arm exercise with the flight leg ergometer and it is recommended that prebreathe countermeasure exercise protocol incorporate this method...|$|E

5|$|Johnson's old injury {{continued}} to trouble {{him and he}} found flying high performance aircraft like the Spitfire extremely painful. RAF medics gave him two options; he could have an operation that would correct the problem, but this meant he would miss the Battle of Britain, or becoming a training instructor flying the light Tiger Moth. Johnson opted for the operation. He had hoped for discreet treatment, but word soon reached the CO, and Johnson was taken off flying duties {{and sent to the}} RAF Hospital at Rauceby. He did not return to the squadron until 28 December 1940. CO Burton took Johnson up for a test flight on 31 December 1940 in Miles Magister L8151. After the 45-minute <b>flight,</b> Johnson's <b>fitness</b> to fly was approved.|$|R
50|$|Several factors {{contribute}} to simulation sickness, which can be categorized into human variables, simulator usage, and equipment. Common human variable factors include susceptibility, <b>flight</b> hours, <b>fitness,</b> and medication/drugs. An individual’s variance in susceptibility to motion sickness is a dominant contributing factor to simulator sickness. Increasing flight hours is also an issue for pilots as they become more accustomed to the actual motion in a vehicle. Contributing factors due to simulator usage are adaptation, distorted or complicated scene content, longer simulation length, and freeze/reset. Freeze/reset refers to the starting or ending points of a simulation, which should be as close to steady and level conditions as possible. Clearly, if a simulation is ended {{in the middle of}} an extreme maneuver then the test subjects IMU system is likely to be distorted. Simulator equipment factors that {{contribute to}} motion sickness are quality of motion system, quality of visual system, off-axis viewing, poorly aligned optics, flicker, and delay/mismatch between visual and motion systems. The delay/mismatch issue has historically been a concern in simulator technology, where time lag between pilot input and the visual and motion systems can cause confusion and generally decrease simulator performance.|$|R
3000|$|The LF {{randomly}} generated host nests {{which should}} be within a × b area of the search space. The initial location of nests was equal to the initial location of eggs. The next step was, if the counter t =  MaxGen, then searching was stopped; if not, then generate another solution [cuckoo egg (i)] using Lévy <b>flights</b> then get <b>fitness</b> of (F [...] i [...]) using the fitness function. Then choose random nest in initial population (j) then get fitness of the egg located in the nest (F [...] i [...]). Compare F [...] i [...] and F [...] j, if F [...] i [...] was better than (F [...] j [...]) then replace the egg in j with egg i. Then sort eggs in the current population based on fitness value, and then abandon a fraction of worse nests or eggs. Build new ones and new locations via LF and find current best. The process was repeated from the start.|$|R
40|$|Computerized dynamic {{posturography}} (CDP) {{has become}} a standard technique for objectively quantifying balance control performance, diagnosing the nature of functional impairments underlying balance disorders, and monitoring clinical treatment outcomes. We have long used CDP protocols to assess recovery of sensory-motor function in astronauts following space flight. The most reliable indicators of post-flight crew performance are the sensory organization tests (SOTs), particularly SOTs 5 and 6, which are sensitive to changes in availability and/or utilization of vestibular cues. We have noted, however, that some astronauts exhibiting obvious signs of balance impairment after flight are able to score within clinical norms on these tests, perhaps {{as a result of}} adopting competitive strategies or by their natural skills at substituting alternate sensory information sources. This insensitivity of the CDP protocol could underestimate of the degree of impairment and, perhaps, lead to premature release of those crewmembers to normal duties. To improve the sensitivity of the CDP protocol we have introduced static and dynamic head tilt SOT trials into our protocol. The pattern of postflight recovery quantified by the enhanced CDP protocol appears to more aptly track the re-integration of sensory-motor function, with recovery time increasing as the complexity of sensory-motor/biomechanical task increases. The new CDP protocol therefore seems more suitable for monitoring post-flight sensory-motor recovery and for indicating to crewmembers and <b>flight</b> surgeons <b>fitness</b> for return to duty and/or activities of daily living. There may be classes of patients (e. g., athletes, pilots) having motivation and/or performance characteristics similar to astronauts whose sensory-motor treatment outcomes would also be more accurately monitored using the enhanced CDP protocol. Furthermore, the enhanced protocol may be useful in early detection of age-related balance disorders...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{simplified}} {{model of the}} strategic allocation of trajectories in a generic airspace for commercial flights. In this model, two types of companies, characterised by different cost functions and different strategies, compete for the allocation of trajectories in the airspace. With an analytical model and numerical simulations, we show that the relative advantage of the two populations [...] companies [...] depends on external factors like traffic demand {{as well as on}} the composition of the population. We show that there exists a stable equilibrium state which depends on the traffic demand. We also show that the equilibrium solution is not the optimal at the global level, but rather that it tends to favour one of the two business models [...] the archetype for low-cost companies. Finally, linking the cost of allocated <b>flights</b> with the <b>fitness</b> of a company, we study the evolutionary dynamics of the system, investigating the fluctuations of population composition around the equilibrium and the speed of convergence towards it. We prove that in the presence of noise due to finite populations, the equilibrium point is shifted and is reached more slowly...|$|R
40|$|Intertidal areas support {{during the}} non-breeding season many wading birds Charadrii that may often take flight in {{response}} to the presence of people or of birds of prey on their intertidal feeding and roosting grounds. Disturbance can cause birds to spend energy flying away and to lose feeding time while relocating to different feeding areas, where the increased bird densities may intensify competition from interference and, if of sufficient duration, from prey depletion. Until now, there has been no method for establishing how frequently birds can be put to <b>flight</b> before their <b>fitness</b> is reduced. We show how individual-based behavioural models can establish critical thresholds for the frequency with which wading birds can be disturbed before they die of starvation. It uses oystercatchers Haematopus ostralegus in the baie de Somme, France where birds were put to flight by disturbance up to 1. 73 times/daylight hour. Modelling shows that the birds can be disturbed up to 1. 0 – 1. 5 times/h before their fitness is reduced in winters with good feeding conditions (abundant cockles Cerastoderma edule and mild weather) but only up to 0. 2 – 0. 5 times/h when feeding conditions are poor (scarce cockles and severe winter weather). Individual-based behavioural models enable critical disturbance thresholds to be established for the first time...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{influence}} of physical fitness on cardiac autonomic control in passengers prior to, during and following commercial flights. Twenty-two, physically active men (36. 4 +/- 6. 4 years) undertook assessments of physical fitness followed by recordings of 24 -h heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), and blood pressure (BP) on a Control (no flight) and Experimental (flight) day. Recordings were analyzed using a two-way analysis of variance for repeated measures with relationships between variables examined via Pearson product moment correlation coefficients. Compared to the Control day, 24 -h HR was significantly greater (> 7 %) and HRV measures (5 - 39 %) significantly lower on the Experimental day. During the 1 -h flight, HR (24 %), and BP (6 %) were increased while measures of HRV (26 - 45 %) were reduced. Absolute values of HRV during the Experimental day and relative changes in HRV measures (Control-Experimental) were significantly correlated with measures of aerobic fitness (r = 0. 43 to 0. 51;- 0. 53 to - 0. 52) and body composition (r = - 0. 63 to - 0. 43; 0. 48 - 0. 61). The current results demonstrated that short-term commercial flying significantly altered cardiovascular function including the reduction of parasympathetic modulations. Further, greater physical fitness and lower body fat composition were associated with greater cardiac autonomic control for passengers during <b>flights.</b> Enhanced physical <b>fitness</b> and leaner body composition may enable passengers to cope better with the cardiovascular stress and high allostatic load associated with air travel for enhanced passenger well-being...|$|R
