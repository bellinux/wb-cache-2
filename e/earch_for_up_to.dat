40|$|ObjectiveIn this study, the {{survival}} and recovery of Chlamydia pneumoniae (Cp) strains TW- 183, AR- 39, AR- 388 and CWL- 029 were measured after inoculation on glass, stainless steel, FormicaR laminate, paper, fabric and human skin. MethodsInoculum in throat washes from healthy volunteers {{was applied to}} each surface. Samples were taken immediately after inoculum application and at specified intervals thereafter to determine infectivity. ResultsInfectious Cp was recovered from glass <b>for</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 4 h, from paper and fabric <b>for</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 3 h, from Formicar laminate <b>for</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 2 h, from stainless steel <b>for</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 60 min and from human skin <b>for</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 30 min. Drying of the inoculated area had no {{significant effect on the}} recovery of infectious Cp. Further experiments demonstrated that infectious Cp could be transferred to hands by touching these contaminated surfaces and could be recovered from these hands <b>for</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 3 min. Addition of albumin, surfactant or phosphatidylcholine had no significant effect on {{the survival}} of Cp. ConclusionsThese results suggest that contact with contaminated surfaces may be a potential mode of transmission of Cp...|$|R

50|$|The CHS {{addresses}} of a partition {{are hard to}} interpret without knowledge of the (virtual) disk geometry, because CHS to LBA translations {{are based on the}} number of heads and the number of sectors per track. However, the given LBA start address and the given partition size in sectors permit to calculate a disk geometry matching the given CHS addresses where that is at all possible. CHS addressing with 24 bits always uses 6 bits <b>for</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 63 sectors per track (1…63), and INT 13h disk access generally uses 8 bits <b>for</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 256 heads (0…255), leaving 10 bits <b>for</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 1024 cylinders (0…1023). ATA CHS addresses always use 4 bits <b>for</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 16 heads (0…15), this leaves 14 bits <b>for</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 16383 cylinders (16383+1=2**14) in ATA-5 24 bits CHS address translations.|$|R
