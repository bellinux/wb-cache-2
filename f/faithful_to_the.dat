5|$|Cavalcade of America (NBC Radio, May 28, 1940). A half-hour dramatization with Jeanette Nolan, John McIntire, Agnes Moorehead and the Ken Christy Chorus. Although brief, it {{was remarkably}} <b>faithful</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{original}} show.|$|E
5|$|A {{critical}} edition did {{not appear}} until 1980, when the Edizioni musicali Otos in Florence published a version <b>faithful</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> composer's intentions, edited by Angelo Coan. Three new editions of the piano version were prepared celebrating Rossin's 200th anniversary in 1992: two critical editions by Oxford and Carus-Verlag, and one by Novello, with only one piano part.|$|E

Caroline died on 12 February 1948 at Cambo, Pyrénées-Atlantiques in France.|$|E
5|$|Lux Radio Theatre (CBS, February 1952). A radio {{version of}} the 1951 MGM film {{featuring}} Kathryn Grayson, Ava Gardner, Howard Keel, and William Warfield from the film's cast. Jay C. Flippen portrayed Cap'n Andy. This version was extremely <b>faithful</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 1951 film adaptation.|$|E
5|$|Origins was {{met with}} mixed to {{positive}} reviews upon release. Critics praised the game for remaining <b>faithful</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> arcade versions and its additional features, but criticized it for its outdated gameplay and unbalanced rosters. In December 2014, the game was removed from its online platforms after Capcom's licensing contracts with Marvel Comics expired.|$|E

2500|$|In Christianity, many Anglican, Catholic, and Lutheran churches ring their bells from belltowers {{three times}} a day, at 6a.m., noon, and 6p.m., {{summoning}} <b>the</b> Christian <b>faithful</b> <b>to</b> recite <b>the</b> Lord’s Prayer, or the Angelus, a prayer recited in honour of the Incarnation of God. [...] In addition, most Christian denominations ring church bells <b>to</b> call <b>the</b> <b>faithful</b> <b>to</b> worship, signalling <b>the</b> start of a mass or service of worship. In many historic Christian churches, church bells are also rung during the processions of Candlemas and Palm Sunday; traditionally, church bells are silent from Maundy Thursday through the Easter Vigil.|$|R
5|$|St. Teresa of Ávila (15151582) a Doctor of the Church, practiced contemplative {{prayer for}} periods of one hour at a time, twice a day. St. Teresa {{believed}} {{that no one}} who was <b>faithful</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> practice of meditation could possibly lose his soul. Her writings are viewed as fundamental teachings in Christian spirituality.|$|E
5|$|The 1883 Hill and Son organ, {{including}} 844 pipes, costing a {{total of}} £550, was installed in 1884, and located in the north-east corner of the transept. It is still in use, with original pipework, making it <b>faithful</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> original tones. The organ was refurbished and rebuilt in 1950, 1975, and 2008.|$|E
5|$|As the fog lifted, Castañeda sent Smither {{to request}} a meeting between the two commanders. Smither was {{promptly}} arrested by the Texians, who were suspicious of his presence among the Mexican soldiers. Nevertheless, Moore agreed to meet Castañeda. Moore explained that his followers no longer recognized the centralist government of Santa Anna and instead remained <b>faithful</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Constitution of 1824, which Santa Anna had repudiated. Castañeda revealed that he shared their federalist leanings, {{but that he was}} honor-bound to follow orders.|$|E

5|$|As {{with its}} predecessor, {{gameplay}} is centred around Nights {{flying through the}} dreams of the two children. The main objective {{of the game is}} to fly through rings while gathering enough keys to proceed to the next level. Development of Journey of Dreams began shortly after the release of Shadow the Hedgehog in 2005, and was headed by Sonic Team veteran Takashi Iizuka. The team took steps to ensure that the game stayed <b>faithful</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> original, while incorporating a variety of new mechanics and features. The game's setting was designed to resemble England, especially parts of London.|$|E
5|$|During the 17th century, Alsace {{was one of}} {{the main}} battlefields of the Thirty Years War. Sélestat was seized by the Swedes in 1632 after a month-long siege. They {{surrendered}} the town to their French allies two years later. The local population long remained predominantly <b>faithful</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> House of Habsburg. The Peace of Westphalia (1648) formalised the annexation of the Decapolis by France. Sélestat was briefly occupied by the Germans during the Franco-Dutch War in 1674. The Treaties of Nijmegen (1679) that ended the war also abolished the Decapolis.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the union, the process of gradual Polonization gained steady momentum. In culture and social life, both the Polish language and Catholicism became dominant, and in 1696, Polish replaced Belarusian as the official language—with the Belarusian language being banned from administrative use. However, the local Ruthenian peasants, continued to speak their own language and remained <b>faithful</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Eastern Orthodox church.|$|E
50|$|On November 25, 2005, Ronald P. Fabbro, Bishop of London, {{decreed that}} Christ the King University Parish be {{established}} <b>to</b> serve <b>the</b> Catholic <b>faithful</b> connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> University of Western Ontario.|$|R
25|$|In mathematics, a {{concrete}} category is a category that {{is equipped with}} a <b>faithful</b> functor <b>to</b> <b>the</b> category of sets. This functor makes it possible <b>to</b> think of <b>the</b> objects of the category as sets with additional structure, and of its morphisms as structure-preserving functions. Many important categories have obvious interpretations as concrete categories, for example the category of topological spaces and the category of groups, and trivially also the category of sets itself. On the other hand, the homotopy category of topological spaces is not concretizable, i.e. it does not admit a <b>faithful</b> functor <b>to</b> <b>the</b> category of sets.|$|R
2500|$|This {{generation}} {{introduced a}} much more visual representation of the [...] "sweepspear", with a more <b>faithful</b> representation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> version that appeared on 1950s Buicks in both the side molding and [...] beltline.|$|R
5|$|The {{project was}} in {{development}} for approximately {{three years at}} Paramount Pictures, during which time a screen adaptation that differed significantly from the novel was written. Summit Entertainment acquired {{the rights to the}} novel after three years of the project's stagnant development. Melissa Rosenberg wrote a new adaptation of the novel shortly before the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike and sought to be <b>faithful</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> novel's storyline. Principal photography took 44 days and completed on May 2, 2008; the film was primarily shot in Oregon.|$|E
5|$|The prose, while simple at {{the level}} of the {{sentence}} (and we can safely assume that Hofmann's translation is very <b>faithful</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> original), is shifty, blurred, to the point where at times we are left unsure as to what exactly is going on – a deliberate flight from causation, quite understandable in a country where everyone (even, we learn, the horses) has been driven mad by fear.|$|E
5|$|The {{reforms of}} Sejanus most {{significantly}} included {{the founding of}} the Castra Praetoria, which established the Praetorian Guard as the powerful political force, for which it is primarily known today. Henceforth the Guard was at the disposal of the emperors, and the rulers were equally {{at the mercy of the}} Praetorians. The reality of this was seen in AD 31, when Tiberius was forced to rely upon the vigiles against the soldiers of his own guard. Although the Praetorian Guard proved <b>faithful</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> aging Tiberius, their potential political power had been made clear.|$|E
25|$|The diocesan bishop can {{initiate}} a process {{on his own}} initiative or {{at the request of}} <b>the</b> <b>faithful</b> <b>to</b> investigate <b>the</b> facts of an alleged apparition. The bishop may refrain from looking into it if he chooses, especially if he thinks that not much will come of the event.|$|R
50|$|During his 1990 {{visit to}} Rwanda, Pope John Paul II exhorted <b>the</b> <b>faithful</b> <b>to</b> turn <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Virgin as a “simple and sure guide” and {{to pray for}} greater {{commitment}} against local divisions, both political and ethnic.|$|R
50|$|As {{a typical}} {{monstrance}} in form, the highly ornate La Lechuga comprises a cross-crowned disc making a circular frame for the wafer, supported by an angel and knobbed stem for firmly holding aloft, allowing <b>the</b> <b>faithful</b> <b>to</b> see <b>the</b> sacrament. The whole item weighs 4.9 kilograms (10 lbs 13 oz).|$|R
5|$|The storyline, {{which is}} largely <b>faithful</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{original}} television production, centres {{on the discovery}} of a mysterious object buried at the site of an extension to the London Underground. Also uncovered nearby are the remains of early human ancestors more than five million years old. Realising that the object is in fact an ancient Martian spacecraft, Quatermass deduces that the aliens have influenced human evolution and the development of human intelligence. The spacecraft has an intelligence of its own, and once uncovered begins to exert a malign influence, resurrecting Martian memories and instincts buried deep within the human psyche.|$|E
5|$|Alejo Carpentier {{grew up in}} Havana, Cuba and {{was born}} on December 26, 1904 in Lausanne, Switzerland. He {{subsequently}} moved to France in 1933 (at the age of 29) and returned to Cuba six years later, in 1939. Once in Cuba, Carpentier joined {{a group of young}} writers whose goal was to establish a literature <b>faithful</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> New World, by recovering origins, history, and tradition. In 1943, he travelled to Haiti, where he was made aware of Dominique Hyppolyte's play, Le Torrent, about the Haitian Revolution, which features a character named Ti Noel. As The Kingdom of This World coincides with Carpentier's return to Cuba, it is very much influenced by the author's re-encounter with himself and his origins.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{wound up}} being <b>faithful</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> comics, many designs {{were made for}} Spider-Man's costumes: one concept costume {{designer}} James Acheson became fond {{of the idea of}} having a red emblem over a black costume. Another, which would eventually lead to the final product, featured an enlarged logo on the chest and red stripes going down the sides of the legs. To create Spider-Man's costume, Maguire was fitted for the skintight suit, being covered with layers of substance to create the suit's shape. It was designed as a single piece, except for the mask. The webbing, which accented the costume, was cut by computer. The mask eye lenses were designed to have a mirror look.|$|E
25|$|Many music {{critics have}} taken {{exception}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> liberties Stokowski took—liberties which were {{common in the}} nineteenth century, but had mostly died out in the twentieth, when <b>faithful</b> adherence <b>to</b> <b>the</b> composer's scores became more common.|$|R
50|$|Constructed in <b>faithful</b> {{accordance}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{rules of}} the treatises of Vitruvius, <b>the</b> building corresponds <b>to</b> <b>the</b> typical Roman model. The structure exhibits similarities with the theatres of Dougga (Tunisia), Orange (France), Pompeii (Italy) and Rome.|$|R
50|$|The Pacific {{fleet of}} the Canadian Pacific Railway tended to hire its {{officers}} from the Royal Naval Reserves, and much was made of their long and <b>faithful</b> service <b>to</b> <b>the</b> company, including John Wallace, RNR.|$|R
