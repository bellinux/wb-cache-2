2500|$|Thoughtography, {{also called}} {{projected}} thermography, psychic photography, nengraphy or nensha , is the claimed ability to [...] "burn" [...] images from one's mind onto surfaces such as photographic film by psychic means. While the term [...] "thoughtography" [...] {{has been in}} the English lexicon since 1913, the more recent term [...] "projected thermography" [...] is a neologism that originated from the 2002 U.S. film The Ring, a remake of the 1998 Japanese horror <b>film</b> <b>Ring.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Ring Two is a 2005 American supernatural {{psychological}} horror {{film and}} {{a sequel to}} the 2002 film The Ring, which was a remake of the 1998 Japanese <b>film</b> <b>Ring.</b> Hideo Nakata, director of the original Japanese <b>film</b> <b>Ring,</b> on which the American versions are based, directed this film in place of Gore Verbinski.|$|E
50|$|Three {{full-length}} Ring {{films were}} made in the USA, plus one short film. In 2002, The Ring was released. This was an adaptation of Nakata's 1998 film.

40|$|This paper {{lays out}} a {{technique}} whereby delamination growth in a GFRP panel {{subjected to a}} low velocity impact is compartmenatlised using discrete thermoplastic <b>film</b> <b>rings.</b> By comparing the compartmentalised configurations with an unmodified baseline panels the thermoplastic <b>film</b> <b>rings</b> {{have been shown to}} suppress delamination crack growth at the desired interfaces and effectively prevented any growth beyond the outer diameter of the rings. This has resulted in the reduction of the damage footprint areas by up to 38 % and an improved compression after impact (CAI) strength of up to 18 % relative to a baseline panel...|$|R

40|$|A {{technique}} for controlling delamination growth in a GFRP panel {{subjected to a}} low velocity impact is presented. Deploying discrete thermoplastic <b>film</b> <b>rings</b> at selective interfaces centred around the impact site {{has been shown to}} arrest delamination thus allowing damage control. Using six different layup configurations the thermoplastic <b>film</b> <b>rings</b> have been shown to suppress delamination crack growth at the desired interfaces. This resulted in manipulation of the damage footprint areas. Configurations that reduced delamination area by up to 38 % demonstrated an improved CAI strength of up to 18 % relative to a baseline panel. However, two configurations which saw an increase in delamination area by up to 30 % showed similar CAI strengths to the baseline panel. This finding would confirm that it is the delamination interface location that influences the CAI strength not the damage footprint area. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|We have {{observed}} spontaneous fluxoid generation in thin <b>film</b> <b>rings</b> of the amorphous superconductor Mo 3 Si, cooled through the normal-superconducting transition, {{as a function}} of quench rate and externally applied magnetic field, using a variable sample temperature scanning SQUID microscope. Our results can be explained using a model of freeze-out of thermally activated fluxoids, mediated by the transport of bulk vortices across the ring walls. This mechanism is complementary to a mechanism proposed by Kibble and Zurek, which only relies on causality to produce a freeze-out of order parameter fluctuation...|$|R
40|$|The {{differential}} cross section for the inelastic magnetic scattering of neutrons by superconducting rings is derived theoretically taking account of {{the interaction of the}} neutron magnetic moment with magnetic field created by the superconducting current.
