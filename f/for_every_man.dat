During the tenth and eleventh centuries {{the coasts of}} Wales were frequently raided by the Vikings. In 987/988 the clas was destroyed by the Danes, but the worst to suffer was St David's, with attacks in 1073, 1080 and 1091. In 989 Maredudd ab Owain raised a poll tax to bribe the Danes {{to stay away from}} Llanbadarn (a tribute was levied of one penny <b>for</b> <b>every</b> <b>man</b> within his dominions, which, in Welsh, was called Glwmaen, or the tribute of the black army). However, in 1038 the church was reduced to ashes by Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, who wrested it from the hands of prince Hywel ab Edwin, whilst subjugating Ceredigion. The lands were ravaged and the area depopulated, though the clas survived. Gruffydd ap Llywelyn seems to have held the area until his death in 1063.|$|E
25|$|Not {{knowing where}} {{to offer his}} {{services}} next, Nassau approached the Prussian King Frederick the Great. Frederick appointed Nassau as major general, and instructed him to recruit a dragoon regiment (Dragoon Regiment No. XI) of Prussian and Saxon officers. He also received ten talers <b>for</b> <b>every</b> <b>man</b> he recruited. Nassau had been successful in Saxony and maintained his contacts: in three months he had a battalion with five squadrons and a second battalion was under formation. Although no horses were available, the regiment was ordered into the camp near Strehlen, where it came {{under the command of}} Kurt Christoph Graf von Schwerin. In the First Silesian War the regiment fought in Silesia, Bohemia and Moravia. He was involved in the seven-week Siege of Olomouc.|$|E

Among those age 75 - 84, <b>for</b> <b>every</b> 100 <b>men</b> {{there are nearly}} 150 women, and among those age 3 ̆e/= 85, <b>for</b> <b>every</b> 100 <b>men</b> there are nearly 220 women. Among the population of nursing home residents, the sex ratios are even more dramatic. For those age 65 - 74 who reside in U.

Among residents of nursing homes age 75 - 84, <b>for</b> <b>every</b> 100 <b>men</b> there are 246 women, and among those age 3 ̆e/= 85, <b>for</b> <b>every</b> 100 <b>men</b> there are 425 women. Unless gender-based differences in mortality narrow, the age-related demographic shifts that are occurring in the United States will remain overwhelmingly female. In considering any health-related issue in the geriatric patient population, a special focus on women is absolutely required. This is especially true with regard to pharmacotherapy in the geriatric population...|$|R

500|$|In 1888, Mole and the Workers' Brotherhood {{started to}} {{campaign}} to unionise the female workers in Liverpool into female-only unions. They {{started working with}} the Women's Protective and Provident League (WPPL), calling for the founding of a local branch, and in January 1889, the group set up the Liverpool Workwomen's Society, representing bookfolders, tailors, and cigar makers, with Mole acting as secretary. Women were over-represented in these poorly paid trades, with four women <b>for</b> <b>every</b> <b>man</b> working in them. The society relaunched the following year as [...] "Liverpool Society for the Promotion of Women's Trade Unions", expanding its membership to other trades in reaction to Liverpool City Council's inaction over sweating systems in the area. Mole helped set up specific unions, such as one for (primarily Chinese) laundresses and washerwomen. Around the same time, the House of Lords launched a select committee on sweating systems, with the ensuing publicity encouraging the group to take further action.|$|E
500|$|Some of Shakespeare's plays were {{published}} in quarto editions, beginning in 1594, and by 1598, his name had become a selling point and began {{to appear on the}} title pages. Shakespeare continued to act in his own and other plays after his success as a playwright. The 1616 edition of Ben Jonson's Works names him on the cast lists <b>for</b> <b>Every</b> <b>Man</b> in His Humour (1598) and Sejanus His Fall (1603). The absence of his name from the 1605 cast list for Jonson's Volpone is taken by some scholars as a sign that his acting career was nearing its end. The First Folio of 1623, however, lists Shakespeare as one of [...] "the Principal Actors in all these Plays", some of which were first staged after Volpone, although we cannot know for certain which roles he played. In 1610, John Davies of Hereford wrote that [...] "good Will" [...] played [...] "kingly" [...] roles. In 1709, Rowe passed down a tradition that Shakespeare played the ghost of Hamlet's father. Later traditions maintain that he also played Adam in As You Like It, and the Chorus in Henry V, though scholars doubt the sources of that information.|$|E
