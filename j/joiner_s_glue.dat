40|$|Cell {{motility}} requires lamellipodial protrusion, {{a process}} driven by actin polymerization. Ena/VASP proteins accumulate in protruding lamellipodia {{and promote the}} rapid actin-driven motility of the pathogen Listeria. In contrast, Ena/VASP negatively regulate cell translocation. To resolve this paradox, we analyzed the function of Ena/VASP during lamellipodial protrusion. Ena/VASP-deficient lamellipodia protruded slower but more persistently, consistent with their increased cell translocation rates. Actin networks in Ena/VASP-deficient lamellipodia contained shorter, more highly branched filaments compared to controls. Lamellipodia with excess Ena/VASP contained longer, less branched filaments. In vitro, Ena/VASP promoted actin filament elongation by interacting with barbed ends, shielding them from capping protein. We conclude that Ena/VASP regulates cell motility by controlling the geometry of actin filament networks within lamellipodia.

40|$|Influenza A viruses, {{members of}} the Orthomyxoviridae family, are {{responsible}} for annual seasonal influenza epidemics and occasional global pandemics. The binding of viral coat glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) to sialylated glycan receptors on host epithelial cells is the critical initial step in the infection and transmission of these viruses. Scientists believe that a switch in the binding specificity of HA from Neu 5 Acα 2 - 3 Gal linked (α 2 - 3) to Neu 5 Acα 2 - 6 Gal linked (α 2 - 6) glycans {{is essential for the}} crossover of the viruses from avian to human hosts. However, {{studies have shown that the}} classification of glycan binding preference of HA based on sialic acid linkage alone is insufficient to establish a correlation between receptor specificity of HA and the efficient transmission of influenza A viruses. A recent study reported extensive diversity in the structure and composition of α 2 - 6 glycans (which goes beyond the sialic acid linkage) in human upper respiratory epithelia and identified different glycan structural topologies. Biochemical examination of the multivalent HA binding to these diverse sialylated glycan structures also demonstrated that high affinity binding of HA to α 2 - 6 glycans with a characteristic umbrella-like structural topology is critical for efficient human adaptation and human-human transmission of influenza A viruses. This review summarizes studies which suggest a new paradigm for understanding the role of the structure of sialylated glycan receptors in influenza virus pathogenesis.

If S∩(−S) = 0, that is to say S is reduced, it can be shown that it has a unique minimal system of generators (see for instance [24, Chapter 3]). The cardinality of the minimal generating system of S is known as the embedding dimension of S. Recall that each reduced affine semigroup can be embedded into Nm for some m.

40|$|In our {{previous}} paper [18], we introduced the tautological rings {{of the genus}} zero moduli spaces of stable maps to homogeneous spaces X. We showed {{that in the case}} of SL flags, all rational cohomology classes on the stable map spaces are tautological using methods from Hodge theory. The purpose of this note is to indicate a localization proof, in the spirit of Gromov-Witten theory, when X is a projective space. To set the stage, we recall the definition of the tautological rings. The moduli stacks M 0,S(P r,d) parametrize S-pointed, genus 0, degree d stable maps to P r. We use the notation M 0,n(P r,d) when the labeling set is S = { 1, 2, [...] .,n}. These moduli spaces are connected by a complicated system of natural morphisms, which we enumerate below: • forgetful morphisms: π: M 0,S(P r,d) → M 0,T(P r,d) defined for T ⊂ <b>S.</b> • <b>gluing</b> morphisms which produce maps with nodal domains, gl: M 0,S 1 ∪{•}(P r,d 1) ×P rM 0,{⋆}∪S 2 (Pr,d 2) → M 0,S 1 ∪S 2 (Pr,d 1 + d 2). • evaluation morphisms to the target space, evi: M 0,S(P r,d) → P r for all i ∈ S. Definition 1. The genus 0 tautological rings R ⋆ (M 0,n(P r,d)) are the smallest system of subrings of A ⋆ (M 0,n(P r,d)) such that: • The system is closed under pushforwards by the gluing and forgetful morphisms. • All monomials in the evaluation classes ev ⋆ i α where α ∈ A ⋆ (P r) are in the system.

Our goal is to prove the following stronger result, still making use of the torus action. Theorem. All rational Chow classes of M 0,n(P r,d) are tautological. While this result is not surprising, we hope that its proof could be of interest. Localization is a popular theme in Gromov-Witten theory, used extensively since the early papers on the subject.

We assessed whether in south-eastern Australia the invasive Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, {{differs from the}} native Sydney rock oyster, Saccostrea glomerata, in the biogenic habitat that it provides to epibiotic communities. We also assessed how within a species (S. glomerata), genotype influences habitat provision. First, we conducted a field experiment in which we compared recruitment of epibiota to concrete plates with either C. gigas, wild-stock S. glomerata, selectively bred <b>S.</b> glomerata or <b>glue</b> (control). Second, we assessed whether within wild S. glomerata populations invaded by C. gigas, communities of epibenthos are correlated to the ratio of non-native to native oysters. On experimental plates C. gigas grew larger, and experienced higher mortality than both selectively-bred and wild-stock S. glomerata at each of two heights on the shore. The two genotypes of S. glomerata, by contrast, displayed similar rates of growth and mortality. The differing growth patterns among oyster types had not, however, translated to consistent differences {{in the composition of}} associated benthic communities by 12. months following establishment of experimental treatments. Within established wild oyster assemblages, C. gigas were typically much larger than on our experimental plates, and the non-native influenced the abundance of several epibiotic taxa, although not the identity of species present. Where impacts of C. gigas on the abundance of associated benthic species occurred, they were generally negative. Overall, our results indicate that while differences in the population size-structure of C. gigas and S. glomerata may be evident from small-scale experiments, the detection of flow-on effects to associated epibenthic communities may require approaches that incorporate much larger spatio-temporal scales. Nevertheless, the observation that wild C. gigas primarily influenced the abundance rather than the identity of associated epifauna suggests a certain degree of redundancy between the two species in their provision of habitat to epibiota. © 2012 Elsevier B.

40|$|Abstract. Dynamical {{systems on}} an {{infinite}} translation surface with the lattice property are studied. The geodesic flow on this surface {{is found to}} be recurrent in all but countably many rational directions. Hyperbolic elements of the affine automorphism group are found to be nonrecurrent, and a precise formula regarding their action on cylinders is proven. A deformation of the surface in the space of translation surfaces is found, which “behaves nicely ” with the geodesic flow and action of the affine automorphism group. In this paper, we study dynamical systems on an infinite translation surface with the lattice property. We build the surface <b>S</b> 1 by <b>gluing</b> together two polygonal parabolas as in figure 1. This surface is infinite in many respects; it has infinite genus, infinite area, and two cone points with infinite cone angle. This study is motivated by the study of closed, finite area translation surfaces with the lattice property, a property which has been found to have great significance for dynamics. For instance, Veech has shown the geodesic flow on a finite area translation surface with the lattice property satisfies a dichotomy. In every direction, the geodesic flow is either completely periodic (decomposes into periodic cylinders), or minimal and uniquely ergodic. See [Vee 89] or [MT 02]. The surface S 1 may be obtained from some of Veech’s original examples by a limiting process. See section 2. Moreover, theorem 1 demonstrates that S 1 has the lattice property. The geodesic flow on the surface supports a trichotomy. In directions of rational slope, the flow is either completely periodic or highly nonrecurrent, decomposing into strips. In irrational directions, the flow is recurrent, but the flow contains no closed trajectories and no saddle connections. See section 4. We study the dynamics of the action of the affine automorphism group in section 5. Our theorem governs the dynamics of hyperbolic elements, ˆ H, of the affine automorphism group of S 1. The action of ˆ H on S 1 is not recurrent. Nonetheless, cylinders are distributed evenly, i...|$|R

Perelman has announced a proof of Thurston’s Geometrization Conjecture in its entirety [70, 71, 72]. By the de-formation theory of L. Ahlfors and L. Bers and stability theorems of A. Marden and D. Sullivan, the space of all such structures GF(M) may be identified with the Teichmüller space T(∂M) of ∂M by identifying a manifold with its conformal boundary. The cover of M ◦ corresponding to ∂M is a quasifuchsian manifold and we obtain a map GF(M) ∼ = T(∂M) → T(∂M) ×T(∂M) ∼ = GF(∂M×R), whose first coordinate function is the identity map on T(∂M). The second coordinate is Thurston’s skinning map σM: T(∂M) → T(∂M), which reveals a surface obscured by the topology of M. W. Haken proved [43] that a Haken manifold may be cut progressively along in-compressible surfaces until a union of finitely many balls is attained, and Thurston’s proof of the Geometrization Theorem proceeds by induction.
