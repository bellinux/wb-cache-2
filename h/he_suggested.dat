5|$|After lynching Sam Carter, the mob met Sylvester Carrier—Aaron's {{cousin and}} Sarah's son—on a road {{and told him}} to get out of town. Carrier refused, and when the mob moved on, <b>he</b> <b>suggested</b> {{gathering}} {{as many people as possible}} for protection.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, Enrico Fermi {{proposed}} the first {{theory of the}} weak interaction, known as Fermi's interaction. <b>He</b> <b>suggested</b> that beta decay {{could be explained by}} a four-fermion interaction, involving a contact force with no range.|$|E
5|$|Khalid, sensing Heraclius' plan, {{feared that}} the Muslim armies would indeed be {{isolated}} and destroyed. In a council of war <b>he</b> <b>suggested</b> that Abu Ubaidah draw all the Muslim armies to one place so as to fight a decisive battle with the Byzantines.|$|E

5|$|Of {{the many}} {{decisions}} made by Captain Boutelle in managing the park, his approach to fisheries had significant and lasting impact. Boutelle was an avid angler and recognized the angling potential in Yellowstone waters. In 1889 <b>he</b> <b>suggested</b> the U.S. Fish Commission consider stocking many of the fish-less lakes and streams in Yellowstone.|$|E
5|$|The raids {{ended in}} mid-1944 on {{the orders of}} Major-General Robert Laycock, the chief of Combined Operations Headquarters. <b>He</b> <b>suggested</b> that {{they were no longer}} as {{effective}} and only resulted in the Germans strengthening their beach defences, which could be detrimental to Allied plans.|$|E
5|$|UK Anime's Kevin Leathers criticized {{its lack}} of {{entertaining}} story arcs, and Anime News Network's Casey Brienza called the anime a poor adaptation of the manga. Allen's English-language voice actor, Todd Haberkorn, said that anime sales were poor despite generally-positive reviews; <b>he</b> <b>suggested</b> that fans buy DVDs on sale to keep the series from being cancelled.|$|E

5000|$|In his paper, The Absurd, Thomas Nagel {{analyzed}} the perpetual absurdity of human life. Absurdity in life becomes apparent when we realize {{the fact that}} we take our lives seriously, while simultaneously perceiving that there is a certain arbitrarity in everything we do. <b>He</b> <b>suggests</b> never to stop searching for the absurd. Furthermore, <b>he</b> <b>suggests</b> searching for irony amongst the absurdity.|$|R

5|$|Upon Harrison's election, <b>he</b> <b>suggested</b> Riley {{be named}} the {{national}} poet laureate, but Congress failed {{to act on}} the request. Riley was still honored by Harrison and visited him at the White House on several occasions to perform at civic events.|$|E
5|$|When {{interviewed in}} early 2005, the Illinois EPA {{inspector}} {{who discovered the}} secret pipe in 1996 was pessimistic about the chances of rapid remediation of the site. <b>He</b> <b>suggested</b> that the clear-up could take twenty years or so.|$|E
5|$|Addressing the mercantilist {{belief that}} {{monetary}} intervention {{could cause a}} perpetually favourable balance of trade, Cantillon developed a specie-flow mechanism foreshadowing future international monetary equilibrium theories. <b>He</b> <b>suggested</b> that in countries with a high quantity of money in circulation, prices will increase and therefore become less competitive in relation to countries {{where there is a}} relative scarcity of money. Thus, Cantillon also held that increases in the supply of money, regardless of the source, cause increases in the price level and therefore reduce the competitiveness of a particular nation's industry in relation to a nation with lower prices. However, Cantillon did not believe that international markets tended toward equilibrium, and instead suggested that government hoard specie to avoid rising prices and falling competitiveness. Furthermore, <b>he</b> <b>suggested</b> that a favourable balance of trade can be maintained by offering a better product and retaining qualitative competitiveness. Cantillon's preference towards a favourable balance of trade possibly stemmed from the mercantilist belief in exchange being a zero-sum game, in which one party gains at the expense of another.|$|E
50|$|In {{his book}} Polling and the Public: What Every Citizen Should Know, Herb Asher {{provides}} a general {{explanation of the}} context in which the phrase is used. <b>He</b> <b>suggests</b> that the phrase has its origins in attempts by poorly performing politicians to discredit polling as an accurate reflection of their performance. The phrase, <b>he</b> <b>suggests,</b> questions the accuracy of polling by drawing attention to historical, inaccurate polling.|$|R
5000|$|Phillips {{points to}} the {{unprecedented}} national debt, currently approaching eighteen trillion dollars. He also points to a [...] "debt culture." [...] <b>He</b> <b>suggests</b> underlying problems because the [...] "debt industry" [...] is larger than industries that actually manufacture goods (such as the automotive industry). <b>He</b> <b>suggests</b> a coming debt bubble. He predicts a liquidation of U.S. government debt by foreign creditors, and mass insolvency of consumers.|$|R
5000|$|Lessig asks {{citizens}} to engage congress, {{the president and}} the constitution. <b>He</b> <b>suggests</b> that citizens ask legislators to support publicly funded elections, to limit and make transparent independent political expenditures, and to reaffirm that [...] "unalienable rights" [...] belong to natural persons only. <b>He</b> <b>suggests</b> that citizens further attempt to elect a presidential candidate that will lead the charge for change. To this end, he supports [...] <b>He</b> also <b>suggests</b> calling a constitutional convention for the limited purpose of drafting an amendment to dramatically reduce the corrupting influence of money in politics (see [...] ).|$|R
5|$|Alexander {{suggested}} that the barrow was constructed before the chamber, {{and that it was}} used as a ramp on which to drag the large stones into position. <b>He</b> <b>suggested</b> that these megaliths were covered with sand until the capstones were placed atop the chamber, at which the sand was then cleared. In 1950, it was stated that fourteen of the stones currently survive, although following full excavation it was revealed that eighteen large sarsen boulders were extant, alongside four smaller sarsen stones used in the drystone wall and pavement of the tomb.|$|E
5|$|Although Timberlake {{expressed}} interest in recording songs with rock influences, Timbaland was initially reluctant to pursue the idea {{because he was not}} accustomed to producing such music. Nonetheless, <b>he</b> <b>suggested</b> that they could produce a handful, since they were afraid of alienating Timberlake's urban fan base. Because of this concern, they produced several reprises, encores and preludes with a rock influence, instead of full-length songs.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of World War I in 1914, Dr. Robert Heindl of Germany had noted that the 15,000 political prisoners at the penal colony could create an undesirable revolution and therefore their release in one stage, following capture of the island by a German ship by bombardment, was risky. <b>He</b> <b>suggested</b> that after due care and adequate security had {{been put in place}} the convicts of the penal colony could be shifted to the mainland in small boats.|$|E

5|$|Babb had tax {{troubles}} {{in the years}} after his success with Mom and Dad. <b>He</b> <b>suggested</b> to the Press-Enterprise that his operation was so diffuse that sales of his one-dollar sex education pamphlets were too difficult to track accurately. Babb eventually sold the rights to Mom and Dad and his stake in Modern Film Distributors to Erwin Joseph and Floyd Lewis—former partners in Modern Film who would continue to showcase Mom and Dad across the United States.|$|E
5|$|Benicio del Toro had {{significant}} input into {{certain parts of}} the film; for example, <b>he</b> <b>suggested</b> a simpler, more concise way of depicting his character kidnapping Francisco Flores that Soderbergh ended up using. The director cut a scene in which Robert Wakefield smokes crack after finding it in his daughter's bedroom. After rehearsing this scene with the actors, he felt that the character would not do it; after consulting with Gaghan, the screenwriter agreed and the filmmakers cut the scene shortly before it was scheduled to be shot.|$|E
5|$|By the 18th century, Pall Mall {{was well}} known for its shops {{as well as its}} grand houses. The shops {{included}} that of the Vulliamy family who made clocks at No.68 between 1765 and 1854. Robert Dodsley ran a bookshop at No.52, where <b>he</b> <b>suggested</b> the idea of a dictionary to Samuel Johnson. Writers and artists began to move to Pall Mall during this century; both Richard Cosway and Thomas Gainsborough lived at Schomberg House at Nos.80–82.|$|E

5|$|Electoral success overtook {{the party}} and Janmaat began to make {{controversial}} statements in the media. Based on his conviction that high office should be restricted to third-generation Dutch nationals, <b>he</b> <b>suggested</b> that several cabinet ministers, including Justice Minister Ernst Hirsch-Ballin who was of Jewish descent, and Agriculture State Secretary Dzsingisz Gabor who was of Hungarian descent, should {{be removed from the}} Dutch leadership. This marked the start of prosecutions of Centre Democrats party members on charges of racism, as well as the decision by the other parties in Parliament and government to place a cordon sanitaire around the party.|$|E
5|$|In 1895, surgeon J. W. Ballantyne {{considered}} {{the case of}} the Biddenden Maids from a teratological perspective. <b>He</b> <b>suggested</b> that they had in fact been pygopagus (twins joined at the pelvis). Pygopagus twins are known to put their arms around each other's shoulders when walking, and Ballantyne suggested that this accounted for their apparently being joined at the shoulders in drawings. The pygopagus Millie and Christine McCoy had lived in Britain for a short time before going on to a successful singing career in the United States, and it was known from their case that such twins were capable of surviving to adulthood.|$|E
5|$|In 1985 {{biochemist}} David Dolphin {{proposed a}} link between the rare blood disorder porphyria and vampire folklore. Noting that the condition is treated by intravenous haem, <b>he</b> <b>suggested</b> that the consumption of large amounts of blood may result in haem being transported somehow across the stomach wall and into the bloodstream. Thus vampires were merely sufferers of porphyria seeking to replace haem and alleviate their symptoms.|$|E
