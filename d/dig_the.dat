5|$|In March 2012 a hoard of 30,000 silver Roman coins, one of {{the largest}} {{discovered}} in Britain, was unearthed in an archaeological <b>dig.</b> <b>The</b> coins, believed to date from the 3rd century, were found about 150m (450ft) from the Roman baths.|$|E
5|$|At the {{survivors}}' camp, Jim (Andrew Rothenberg) begins digging holes, {{refusing to}} explain why. As the survivors press him, he lashes back at them, forcing Shane Walsh (Jon Bernthal) to restrain Jim. Jim breaks down, explaining how {{he lost his}} family to walkers, and that a dream inspired him to <b>dig</b> <b>the</b> holes. Jim warns Lori Grimes (Sarah Wayne Callies) to keep her son Carl (Chandler Riggs) safe.|$|E
5|$|When the IRT subway {{debuted in}} 1904, the typical tunnel {{construction}} method was cut-and-cover. The street was torn up to <b>dig</b> <b>the</b> tunnel below before being rebuilt from above. Traffic {{on the street}} above would be interrupted due to the digging up of the street. Temporary steel and wooden bridges carried surface traffic above the construction.|$|E

5|$|Heroes {{will appear}} {{at various points}} and times, {{sometimes}} accompanied by a tunneller dwarf, who, like imps, are able to <b>dig.</b> <b>The</b> dungeon can be protected from being breached by having the imps fortify the walls. Heroes include giants, wizards, and samurai warriors. Most levels have a 'Lord of the Land', a heavily armoured knight, who must be defeated. In the final level, the Avatar (resembling the Avatar from Ultima VIII), the most powerful hero, appears as the Lord of the Land, and is resurrected after being defeated. He must be defeated again when he reappears with a large army.|$|E
5|$|Other areas {{managed by}} the National Park Service include Jewel Cave National Monument near Custer, the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail, the Minuteman Missile National Historic Site, which {{features}} a decommissioned nuclear missile silo and a separate missile control area several miles away, and the Missouri National Recreational River. The Crazy Horse Memorial is a large mountainside sculpture near Mt. Rushmore being built with private funds. The Mammoth Site near Hot Springs is another privately owned attraction in the Black Hills. A working paleontological <b>dig,</b> <b>the</b> site {{has one of the}} world's largest concentrations of mammoth remains.|$|E
5|$|The project {{gained the}} backing of several key partners—Leicester City Council, Leicester Promotions (responsible for tourist marketing), the University of Leicester, Leicester Cathedral, Darlow Smithson Productions (responsible for the planned TV show) and the Richard III Society. Funding for the initial phase of pre-excavation {{research}} came from the Richard III Society's bursary fund {{and members of the}} Looking for Richard project, with Leicester Promotions agreeing to pick up the £35,000 cost of the <b>dig.</b> <b>The</b> University of Leicester Archaeological Services—an independent body with offices at the university—was appointed as the project's archaeological contractor.|$|E

5|$|According to the Miami Herald the {{financing}} {{structure of the}} plan is notable {{for the amount of}} financial risk taken by the builders in return for the long term concession on the tunnel. Opposition to the project states that it is a waste of taxpayer money, and may become Miami's Big <b>Dig,</b> <b>the</b> nickname of a tunnel megaproject in Boston, which was a $4 billion project that ended up costing $22 billion in cost overruns. Many believe that the Port of Miami Tunnel Project will be likely to have similar cost overruns, even though the Secretary of the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) promised that the project would finish on time and without overruns. They also state that truck traffic is not a problem in Downtown, and that since 1991 car and truck traffic had reduced significantly.|$|E
5|$|Two sanctified, stone-covered springs nearby feed {{a stream}} that is {{believed}} to hold powers of purification and flows through the buffer zone surrounding the royal city. Their water was used to form the sacred lake of Amparihy, artificially created by at least the 18th century to provide water to fill two ceremonial pools constructed within the Ambohimanga compound. Oral history attributes {{the creation of the}} lake to Andrianampoinimerina. He reportedly engaged the labor of surrounding villagers to <b>dig</b> <b>the</b> lake {{at the site of the}} spring-fed swamp at the base of the hill. Before initially filling the lake with water carried in baked earthen jars from the sacred sites of Alasora, Antsahatsiroa and Anosibe, the lake's creation was sanctified by sacrificing zebu at the site; Andrianampoinimerina is also said to have thrown pearls and silver rings into the lake to inaugurate it.|$|E
5|$|In trap-building species, an average-sized larva digs a pit about 2in (5cm) {{deep and}} 3in (7.5cm) wide at the edge. This {{behavior}} {{has also been}} observed in the Vermileonidae (Diptera), whose larvae <b>dig</b> <b>the</b> same sort of pit to feed on ants. Having marked out the chosen site by a circular groove, the antlion larva starts to crawl backwards, using its abdomen as a plough to shovel up the soil. By the aid of one front leg, it places consecutive heaps of loosened particles upon its head, then with a smart jerk throws each little pile clear of the scene of operations. Proceeding thus, it gradually works its way from the circumference towards the center. As it slowly moves round and round, the pit gradually gets deeper and deeper, until the slope angle reaches the critical angle of repose (that is, the steepest angle the sand can maintain, where {{it is on the}} verge of collapse from slight disturbance). When the pit is completed, the larva settles down at the bottom, buried in the soil with only the jaws projecting above the surface, often in a wide-opened position on either side of the very tip of the cone. The steep-sloped trap that guides prey into the larva's mouth while avoiding crater avalanches is one of the simplest and most efficient traps in the animal kingdom.|$|E

5|$|Parks and Recreation faced early {{production}} delays because Poehler {{was pregnant}} when she signed on; filming {{had to be}} postponed until she gave birth. Principal photography began on February 18, 2009. The show was filmed in Southern California, and the construction pit featured throughout the season was dug by the episode's producers at an undeveloped property in Van Nuys, a district of Los Angeles. The producers went door-to-door in the neighborhood, seeking residents' permission for the <b>dig.</b> <b>The</b> pit was guarded 24hours a day, and paparazzi regularly came to the set to take photos of the actors during filming. The exterior of the Pawnee government building, {{and several of the}} hallway scenes, were shot at Pasadena City Hall. The parks and recreation department interiors, as well as the Town Hall courtyard, were filmed on a sound stage. The set's windows were outfitted with water systems to simulate falling rain, and the windowsills included fake pigeons. Scenes set in playgrounds and elsewhere outdoors were filmed on location in Los Angeles, and the public forum scenes in the premiere episode were filmed in one of the city's middle schools.|$|E
5|$|They first {{prepared}} a cheval de frise to prevent British ships from sailing up the Hudson and outflanking the American position. For {{more than a}} month, the troops transported boulders from the heights of Manhattan {{to the edge of}} the river, where they loaded them into a collection of hulks and cribs made of timber and stretched it across the river. When the cheval de frise was finished, they began work on the fort. Little soil covered the rocky surface, so men had to haul soil up from the low ground. They were unable to <b>dig</b> <b>the</b> customary ditches or trenches around the fort. The fort was built in the shape of a pentagon with five bastions. The main walls were made of earth, constructed with ravelins with openings for guns from every angle. The fort enclosed a total of three to four acres. The troops built an abbattis around the fort. After the barracks were finished in September, all the troops in the area were placed under the command of Major General William Heath. Washington established his headquarters near the fort.|$|E
