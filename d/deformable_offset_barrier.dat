40|$|The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is {{conducting}} research programs to develop test procedures to reduce death and injury, in particular debilitating lower extremity injuries in frontal offset collisions. This paper presents updated results of <b>Offset</b> <b>Deformable</b> <b>Barrier</b> (ODB) crash tests {{conducted for the}} NHTSA. The ODB crash tests were conducted with 50 th percentile male and 5 th percentile female Hybrid III dummies fitted with advanced lower legs, Thor-Lx/HIIIr and Thor-FLx/HIIIr, to assess the potential for debilitating and costly lower limb injuries.

50|$|The {{scope of}} G-Con's test covers {{a wider range}} than many country's legal requirements. For example, the U.S. NHTSA test only covers full frontal {{collision}} but does not test vehicles against an <b>offset</b> <b>deformable</b> frontal <b>barrier.</b> Frontal <b>offset</b> collision tests are a tougher to meet but are a better representation of real world collisions because it mimics the driver's instinctive reaction to swerve away from an obstacle to avoid an accident. Rear collision tests are still not a mandatory requirement by any major automotive market. EuroNCAP have yet to incorporate rear collision though they are plans {{to do so in}} the future. EuroNCAP however covers side pole impact test and collisions with infant occupants.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. According to GB/T 20913 - 2007 regulation, {{the finite}} element model of the <b>offset</b> <b>deformable</b> <b>barrier</b> (ODB) was built with beam and shell elements, and {{validated}} in the simulation of quasi-static compression test. In order to analyze the local deformation characteristics of the ODB model, a sled test was designed. A cylinder impactor of 110 mm in diameter was welded {{in front of the}} sled. It was used to impact the fixed ODB. The simulation model of this test was also built. The acceleration of the sled and the deformation of the ODB were measured in the test and compared with the simulation data. The results show that the ODB model with beam elements not only satisfies the demands of the regulations, but also has good local deformation characteristics. The efficiency of computing can be improved obviously with beam elements...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of {{variations}} in modelling of roof crush loading scenarios upon topology and mass of a body in white (BIW) for a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV). These variations incorporated the proposed changes to the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) 216 standard. The base model used for the investigation in this paper was based upon a series of optimisation studies. The overall purpose was to minimise the BIW mass of an HEV subjected to multiple crash scenarios including high-speed front impact, <b>offset</b> <b>deformable</b> <b>barrier</b> (ODB), side impact, pole impact, high-speed rear impact and low-speed rear impact {{in addition to a}} roof crush scenario. For the purpose of achieving this goal, finite element (FE) topology optimisation was employed. Owing to the limitations of present-day FE optimisation software, all models utilised linear static load cases. In addition, all models made use of inertia relief (IR) boundary conditions. With the above approach, the BIW topology was investigated...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to {{optimize}} the longitudinal beam based on 100 % overlapping rigid barrier (100 % RB) impact and 40 % overlapping <b>offset</b> <b>deformable</b> <b>barrier</b> (40 % ODB) impact. The 100 %RB and 40 %ODB impact FE models were developed in LS-DYNA and validated by using results from crash tests. According to the requirement of crashworthiness, the peak of acceleration of left B-pillar and energy absorbed per unit mass of longitudinal beam were chosen as optimization objects, and the thicknesses of four parts of the longitudinal beam were considered as the design variables. Furthermore, uniform design was applied to build variable samples. Optimal results were obtained by surrogate model built by Kriging and optimization method NSGA-II (Non-Dominated Sorting in Genetic Algorithms-II). The results showed that 100 %RB and 40 %ODB impact should be considered together when longitudinal beam was designed. The optimized longitudinal beam matches well and effectively improves vehicle crashworthiness...|$|R
50|$|Both the facelifted Magna and Verada {{benefited from}} a number of safety upgrades, as proven by the fact that all models met the then latest <b>offset</b> <b>deformable</b> <b>barrier</b> (ODB) and dynamic side impact requirements. In addition, front driver and {{passenger}} airbags became standard along with side airbags contained in the front seat bolsters. While the wheelbase of the new series had not changed, rear legroom was claimed to have been increased by reshaping the rear cushion of the front seats, the rear seat and by re-arranging the rear seat hip points and squabs. Other interior revisions included rear air vents {{for the first time on}} Magna as well as electric driver's seat height adjustment. For the first time, a factory-fitted GPS system was also offered as an option whereas most cars gained a rotary climate control panel, without the previous digital display. Systematic cost-cutting measures included the relocation of the front power window controls on the lesser Magna models from the door panels to the centre console, plus the removal of the individual battery cover compartment in the engine bay.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the crashworthiness design optimisation {{of a typical}} vehicle structure subjected to <b>offset</b> <b>deformable</b> <b>barrier</b> and full rigid barrier impact cases. Several approaches involving sampling techniques, surrogate model, multi-objective optimisation algorithm and reliability analysis are introduced and applied. Four correlation functions of Kriging are adopted for the design optimisation. It shows that {{the accuracy of the}} correlation functions is different and the best one is selected for the objective or constraint function. Both the deterministic optimisation and reliability-based design optimisation (RBDO) are conducted. In RBDO, the reliability levels of constraints are computed through the first-order reliability method (FORM) and second-order reliability method (SORM), and are compared with Monte Carlo simulation. It is found that SORM is more accurate than FORM when the constraint functions are highly nonlinear. Finally, the results demonstrate that RBDO solutions are more reliable than that of the deterministic optimisation for real engineering application. RBDO solutions are further validated by finite element analysis model, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed RRDO approach in obtaining the reliable optimal design of the vehicle structures...|$|R
40|$|Abstract-This paper aims at {{studying}} the frontal collision {{of a car}} frame using non-linear FEA (Finite Element Analysis). Three frontal crash situations are evaluated: a full frontal impact against a rigid barrier and two frontal impacts with 40 % overlap against an ODB (<b>Offset</b> <b>Deformable</b> <b>Barrier).</b> These three simulations are intended to mimic the FMVSS no. 208, the 96 / 79 /EC and the EURONCAP tests. The model of the chassis used in the simulations – a Ford F 150 - is based on one that has previously been published in another paper. However, in that paper, the simulation only considers a static load on the bumper (a pressure) and the conclusions do not reflect what would happen during a real impact with dynamic loads. Several results are presented and discussed: the dissipated energy during the impact, the acceleration time history and the HIC (Head Injury Criterion) are evaluated from the set of results so obtained. Furthermore, different test situations and initial conditions have been applied, aiming at better understanding the frame’s response in a real impact situation...|$|R
40|$|A {{challenge}} {{in the design and}} optimisation of the vehicle front structures is the high computational costs required for crash analysis. A methodological approach to simplifying Finite Element (FE) vehicle models and crash barriers is presented in this paper. The methodology uses global deformation characteristics of structures which are obtained from the global crash model. For the simplification of the vehicle crash model, structural regions which sustain only elastic deformations during the frontal crash are replaced by kinematic numerical representations which describe both stiffness and load paths at the interface of the substituted structures. Verification studies of the simplified vehicle model show a very good agreement of the global and local structural response during the frontal crash. Further simplifications were applied to the <b>offset</b> <b>deformable</b> <b>barrier</b> (ODB) by replacing its detailed crushing behaviour by kinematic descriptions. Through the combined use of both simplified numerical representations, the computational cost of a Euro NCAP offset crash analysis can be reduced by around 92 %. With the obtained time reduction, structural optimisation studies of the remaining structure can be conducted efficiently for the identification of weight reduction potentials...|$|R
40|$|Occupant Restraint System (ORS) can {{effectively}} protect passengers from severe injury in vehicle collision, thus its design signifies {{a key issue}} in automobile engineering. To ensure a high safety rating, e. g. five or at least four stars in the European New Car Assessment Program (Euro-NCAP) rating system, which has been widely used to rate the different vehicles from different manufacturers, design optimization becomes essential. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of conventional mathematical programming methods directly integrated with numerical simulation and sensitivity analysis for optimization is of limited practical value, due to high complexity of structures, nonlinearity of materials and deformation involved. To address the issue, this paper combines a Kriging (KRG) model with Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) for vehicle ORS design. The ORS design of a 40 % <b>Offset</b> <b>Deformable</b> <b>Barrier</b> (ODB) frontal impact test with the collision speed of 64 km/h is exemplified for the presented method. The {{results show that the}} KRG model can well predict the ORS responses for the design. Finally, the optimum result is verified by using sled physical tests. It is found that the ORS performance can be substantially improved for meeting product development requirements through the proposed approach...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} of the FIMCAR (Frontal Impact and Compatibility Assessment Research) project are to answer the remaining open questions identified in earlier projects (such as understanding of {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of force based metrics and barrier deformation based metrics, confirmation of specific compatibility issues such as structural interaction, investigation of force matching) and to finalise the frontal impact test procedures required to assess compatibility. Research strategies and priorities were based on earlier research programs and the FIMCAR accident data analysis. The identified real world safety issues were used to develop a list of compatibility characteristics which were then prioritised within the consortium. This list was the basis for evaluating the different test candidates. This analysis resulted in the combination of the Full Width Deformable Barrier test (FWDB) with compatibility metrics and the existing <b>Offset</b> <b>Deformable</b> <b>Barrier</b> (ODB) as described in UN-ECE Regulation 94 with additional cabin integrity requirement as being proposed as the FIMCAR assessment approach.

40|$|The goal of {{the project}} FIMCAR (Frontal Impact and Compatibility Assessment Research) was to define an {{integrated}} set of test procedures and associated metrics to assess a vehicle’s frontal impact protection, which includes self- and partner- protection. For {{the development of the}} set, two different full-width tests (full-width deformable barrier [FWDB] test, full- width rigid barrier test) and three different <b>offset</b> tests (<b>offset</b> <b>deformable</b> <b>barrier</b> [ODB] test, progressive deformable barrier [PDB] test, moveable deformable barrier with the PDB barrier face [MPDB] test) have been investigated. Different compatibility assessment procedures were analysed and metrics for assessing structural interaction (structural alignment, vertical and horizontal load spreading) as well as several promising metrics for the PDB/MPDB barrier were developed. The final assessment approach consists of a combination of the most suitable full-width and offset tests. For the full- width test (FWDB), a metric was developed to address structural alignment based on load cell wall information in the first 40 ms of the test. For the offset test (ODB), the existing ECE R 94 was chosen. Within the paper, an overview of the final assessment approach for the frontal impact test procedures and their development is given...|$|R
40|$|Preformed {{structural}} reinforcements {{have shown}} good performance in crash tests, where the great advantage is their weight. These reinforcements {{are designed with}} the aim of increasing the rigidity of regions with large deformations, thus stabilising sections of the vehicle that work as load path during impact. The objective of this work is to show the application of structural reinforcements made of polymeric material PA 66 in the field of vehicle safety, through finite element simulations. Simulations of frontal impact at 50 km/h and in ODB (<b>offset</b> <b>deformable</b> <b>barrier)</b> at 57 km/h configurations (standards such as ECE R- 94 and ECE R- 12) were performed in the software LS-DYNA R (R) and MADYMO (R). The simulations showed that the use of polymeric reinforcements leads to a 70 % reduction in A-pillar intrusion, a 65 % reduction in the displacement of the steering column and a 59 % reduction in the deformation in the region of the occupant legs and feet. The level of occupant injuries was analysed by MADYMO (R) software, and a reduction of 23. 5 % in the chest compression and 80 % in the tibia compression were verified. According to the standard, such conditions lead to an improvement in the occupant safety in a vehicle collision event...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} load cell moving deformable barrier (LCMDB) tests as a means of assessing frontal impact compatibility between vehicles. An LCMDB is employed to enable assessment of relevant partner-protection characteristics in addition to self-protection performance in a front-to-front crash test. The ability to control key characteristics of compatibility in LCMDB tests enables force measurements on the load cell wall to be used to assess structural interaction, frontal force level and passenger compartment strength. In this study, LCMDB tests have been conducted with various deformable elements to determine how well they correlated with fixed barrier tests or vehicle-to-vehicle tests. Firstly, barrier load cell data measured in a full-frontal LCMDB-to-vehicle crash test are compared with data measured in a full width deformable barrier (FWDB) test at 56 km/h. In addition, some compatibility metrics such as average height of force (AHOF) and force distribution are compared. Secondly, an offset-frontal LCMDB-to-vehicle crash test has been conducted to evaluate the passenger compartment strength for small cars in an overload condition. Force measurements of the load cell wall are compared with data obtained from an <b>offset</b> <b>deformable</b> <b>barrier</b> (ODB) test at 64 km/h. Finally, an oblique-frontal LCMDB-to-vehicle crash test has been conducted and the test results are compared with vehicle-to-vehicle tests and with fixed oblique barrier tests at 50 km/h in terms of the vehicle and occupant kinematics. The study has shown that the LCMDB-to-vehicle test offers a realistic simulation of the effect of differences in mass in vehicle-to-vehicle impacts, and enables compatibility metrics to be evaluated...|$|R
40|$|Paper Number 05 - 0425 The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{relative}} effectiveness of two booster seats for use by children across a wide age span, from around 3 years to 10 + years. The study was part of a broad research program to identify suitable child restraint systems (CRS) to fit a large sedan vehicle to maximise protection in a crash. Dummies were restrained in the rear seat of a vehicle buck in three restraint configurations with boosters: (i) with a standard adult lap-sash seatbelt, (ii) with a seatbelt plus H-harness and crotch strap, or (iii) with a seatbelt plus H-harness with the crotch strap disengaged (to simulate the effects of real-world misuse conditions), and a fourth condition (iv) with an adult seatbelt only. Boosters were fitted in the vehicle with two different anchorage systems: a standard seatbelt and a system including a retrofitted rigid ISOFIX attachment and top tether. HyGe sled tests were conducted to simulate a 64 km/h <b>offset</b> <b>deformable</b> <b>barrier</b> frontal impact with a change in velocity of around 71 km/h. Preliminary investigations were also conducted using side impact simulations with a change in velocity of around 15 km/h. Overall, the booster seats for both the 6 year old dummy and the 3 year old dummy when a (with harness and crotch strap) provided superior crash protection than use of the adult seatbelt. For tests when the H-harness was used to restrain the dummy, use of the crotch strap was critical in eliminating ‘sub-marining’. The research highlighted the potential for serious injury with misuse of child harness systems and identified several areas for design improvement of booster seats...|$|R
40|$|Subject of {{this study}} is the {{development}} of a generic method to evaluate the characteristics of future vehicle fleets, which assist in vehicle compatibility research. The ever increasing demands for occupant safety have led to improved crashworthiness of vehicles. However, vehicles have become increasingly stiff over the last decades. In combination with a trend of heavier and higher vehicles this results in more aggressive and incompatible vehicles. Also the trend of smaller and lighter vehicles results in a mismatch of vehicles. Compatibility research focuses on improvement of crashworthiness while taking the safety of a possible crash partner into account with the aim to reduce the injury risks off all crash partners. In this regard it is important to conduct research of behaviour on a fleet wide basis. The generic vehicle modelling procedure developed in FIMCAR was used to generate a set of MADYMO models of various vehicles. Due to the limited available data, only three different car models could be made, the Supermini 2, Small Family Car 2 and SUV 4. The created models are tuned with the test data of Full Width Rigid Barrier (FWRB) and checked with test data of <b>Offset</b> <b>Deformable</b> <b>Barrier</b> (ODB) tests. To compensate the limited amount of vehicles additional simulations were ran with variable masses. The available models are used to run two large sets of simulations with various vehicle parameters, like longitudinal stiffness, overlap and speed. These simulations are used to evaluate the performance of the vehicle fleet. For crash severity evaluations the Vehicle Pulse Index (VPI) is used, in which higher VPI values represent a lower crash performance with higher risk of injury...|$|R
40|$|Injuries to {{the lower}} leg are still a {{frequent}} occurrence in frontal crashes and the most serious injuries {{have been found to}} be associated with the ankle region (pilon, calcaneal and talar neck fractures). These injuries are not only of a high severity, they are also associated with long term impairment, which contributes significantly to the societal cost associated with road traffic accidents. In order to reduce these injuries, the ability to determine the potential injury risk in legislative crash tests as well as the capability to assess the performance of proposed enhanced safety measures in the vehicle footwell region is essential. If this is to be achieved a biofidelic assessment tool with appropriate injury criteria is required. In Europe, the protection afforded against injury in frontal impacts is currently assessed by the Hybrid III dummy in an <b>offset</b> <b>deformable</b> <b>barrier</b> test. For the lower leg the tibia index injury criterion is used, however this relates primarily to the risk of tibia fracture and is not appropriate for the determination of the risk of injury to the ankle. This paper reports an overview of the biofidelity of existing dummy legs and the results of a series of PMHS tests which have recreated in the laboratory the more serious ankle injuries seen in real world crashes. The limitations of this work in terms of its application to an ankle injury criterion using peak tibia force for the Hybrid III are discussed and proposals for future work using a different approach are made in order to obtain these important criteria. The results show the significantly enhanced biofidelity of the THORLx lower leg compared to the Hybrid III leg. The paper concludes that the early introduction of a more biofidelic leg such as the THORLx lower extremity is essential if additional and reliable lower leg criteria are to be usefully implemented...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To improve vehicle {{safety in}} frontal collisions, the crash {{compatibility}} between the colliding vehicles is crucial. Compatibility aims to improve both {{the self and}} partner protection properties of vehicles. Although compatibility has received worldwide attention for many years, no final assessment approach has been defined. Methods: Within the Frontal Impact and Compatibility Assessment Research (FIMCAR) project, different frontal impact test procedures (<b>offset</b> <b>deformable</b> <b>barrier</b> [ODB] test as currently used for Economic Commission for Europe [ECE] R 94, progressive deformable barrier test as proposed by France for a new ECE regulation, moveable deformable barrier test as discussed worldwide, full-width rigid barrier test as used in Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard [FMVSS] 208, and full-width deformable barrier test) were analyzed regarding their potential for future frontal impact legislation. The research activities focused on car-to-car frontal impact accidents based on accident investigations involving newer cars. Test procedures were developed with both a crash test program and numerical simulations. Results: The proposal from FIMCAR {{is to use a}} full-width test procedure with a deformable element and compatibility metrics in combination with the current offset test as a frontal impact assessment approach that also addresses compatibility. Conclusions: By adding a full-width test to the current ODB test it is possible to better address the issues of structural misalignment and injuries resulting from high acceleration accidents as observed in the current fleet. The estimated benefit ranges from a 5 to 12 percent reduction of fatalities and serious injuries resulting from frontal impact accidents. By using a deformable element in the full-width test, the test conditions are more representative of real-world situations with respect to acceleration pulse, restraint system triggering time, and deformation pattern of the front structure. The test results are therefore expected to better represent real-world performance of the tested car. Furthermore, the assessment of the structural alignment is more robust than in the rigid wall test. Supplemental materials are available for this article.

40|$|The {{goal of the}} FIMCAR (Frontal Impact and Compatibility Assessment Research) {{project was}} to propose a frontal impact {{assessment}} approach addressing self- and partner protection. Research strategies and priorities were based on earlier research programs and the FIMCAR accident data analysis looking at modern cars. The identified real world safety issues – such as structural interaction (especially under-/override), high acceleration loading of the occupant especially in large overlap accidents and insufficient horizontal and vertical load spreading were used for evaluating the different test candidates. In addition to the issues mentioned above, the FIMCAR accident analysis suggested that frontal force compartment integrity matching is less of an issue as originally expected. FIMCAR developed a car-to-car test program that investigated the performance of vehicle structures. Results of the test program show {{that the presence of}} a lower load path contributes to a more robust performance of the vehicle. The rearward offset of a lower load path could be reviewed and used to quantify when a lower structure design can contribute to structural interaction in both frontal and side impact configurations. In addition to the car crash test programme, numerical models of actual cars and barriers were developed and used. As car-to-car simulations with models of different car manufacturers are almost impossible because of confidentiality, Parametric Car Models (PCM) and Generic Car Models (GCM) were developed. Due to the parametric design of the PCMs it is possible to modify the models in an easy and fast way. The GCMs model virtual cars which represent an average real car of the respective category in a comparable way to the OEM models. Within the FIMCAR project, different frontal impact test candidates were analysed regarding their potential for future frontal impact legislation. The research activities focused on car-to-car frontal impact. Test procedures were developed with both a crash test programme and numerical simulations. This analysis resulted in the combination of the Full Width Deformable Barrier test (FWDB) with compatibility metrics and the existing <b>Offset</b> <b>Deformable</b> <b>Barrier</b> (ODB) as described in UN-ECE Regulation 94 with additional cabin integrity requirement as being proposed as the FIMCAR assessment approach. The advantages of the FWDB compared to the rigid wall are the more representative pulse and deformation pattern as well as the better assessment of load paths. The introduction of a (M) PDB without compatibility metrics (that FIMCAR was unable to deliver in time) was considered as not being appropriate. The proposed frontal impact assessment approach addresses many of the issues identified by the FIMCAR consortium (impact alignment, high acceleration pulse loading, maintenance of compartment strength requirements, etc.) but not all frontal impact and compatibility issues could be addressed (load spreading). A benefit analysis estimated the benefit of the following three options: no change, introduction of full width test with compatibility assessment in addition to current ECE R 94 and introduction of full width test with compatibility assessment and replacement of current ODB test by PDB test with load spreading metric. The comparison of calculated break even costs for option 2 with estimated costs for achieving the benefit from previous projects suggests a positive cost benefit ratio.

Concluding, FOS-ERP is seen as a strong option for enterprises in the future, but a clear understanding and distinction must be the <b>offset,</b> <b>barriers</b> needs to be managed, and optimal co-existence will in most cases be the realistic scenario...|$|R

40|$|This study reanalyses {{the data}} from {{research}} by Doecke and Woolley (2010) that examined road departures with regard to clear zones and roadside barriers, in the new context of wide medians and median barriers (i. e. departures {{to the right side}} of the direction of travel). This study includes data from 62 rural crash investigations conducted from 1998 to 2010 in rural areas to which an ambulance was called. Many of the vehicles in the sample of in-depth crash investigations collided with fixed objects within 15 metres of the roadway yet still about 13 % traversed 15 metres of lateral width from the roadway and had an occupant who needed to be transported to hospital. Of those 10 cases where no fixed object was struck, only five came to rest within 15 metres of the roadway. Computer simulations were performed based on five of the cases, three ‘drift off’ type run off road to the right crashes and two single yaw run off road to the right crashes. Each case was simulated using two different driver scenarios. The simulations revealed that wide medians may cater well for vehicles which drift off the road but those that lose control before departing the road will be likely to cross the median. Furthermore, the vehicles that lost control were found to still be travelling at between 55 and 70 km/h after crossing a 15 metre wide median. The computer simulations were also used to examine the appropriateness of median <b>barrier</b> <b>offsets.</b> The <b>barrier</b> was placed at a range of different lateral offsets from the road to examine the optimal positioning of roadside barriers on both wide and narrow medians. In general, smaller <b>barrier</b> <b>offsets</b> produced less severe impacts but all <b>barrier</b> <b>offsets</b> tested would be acceptable. It was concluded that a 15 metre median would cater for drift off crashes but not loss of control crashes. Therefore, to create a true safe system median barriers must be considered. It is also desirable to have a median that is not as wide as currently recommended when a median barrier is installed. Barriers on narrow medians will safely prevent departures to the right. The exact <b>barrier</b> <b>offset</b> (and therefore median width) on a narrow median had little effect on safety. SD Doecke, JE Woolle...|$|R
40|$|Many {{companies}} have used {{perceptions of their}} employees to understand how sleep disorders affect their working environment. Sleep disorders have had an undesirable effect on employee performance and often result in employee modifications to accommodate their condition in the workplace. Though information is available concerning employees 2 ̆ 7 experiences pertinent to working with sleep disorders, research focusing on how employees with narcolepsy perceive their work environment appears to be missing from the literature. The {{purpose of this study}} was to gain understanding of perceptions of employees with narcolepsy about their work environment and strategies that may influence others to promote positive health maintenance of narcolepsy in the workplace. The repair and restoration theory of sleep and the disability theory guided this study. Fifteen employees with narcolepsy participated in this descriptive phenomenological study by sharing experiences of their working contributions to become or remain employed. Giorgi 2 ̆ 7 s data analysis strategy revealed thematic employee reports of declines in work performance as a factor for being employed with narcolepsy. Study findings established that participants believed sleep attacks and inability to multitask were barriers in the workplace. Scheduling naps and changing work tasks <b>offset</b> <b>barriers</b> to help the participants remain successfully employed. The results of this study may benefit the health services industry as it relates to knowledge and understanding about productivity, schedules, and tools of the work environment for employees with narcolepsy. Positive social change implications include improved work environments and accommodations for employees with narcolepsy...|$|R
