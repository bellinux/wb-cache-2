5|$|Nurkse {{argued against}} {{the notion that}} a large {{population}} <b>implies</b> <b>a</b> large market. Though underdeveloped countries have a large population, their levels of productivity are low. This results in low levels of per capita real income. Thus, consumption expenditure is low, and savings are either very low or completely absent. On the other hand, developed countries have smaller populations than underdeveloped countries but by virtue of high levels of productivity, their per capita real incomes are higher and thus they create a large market for goods and services.|$|E

Earlier names for the settlement have been identified which include Fontanetum, in a charter of 725 granted by King Ina to Glastonbury and Fontanensis Ecclesia. Tidesput or Tithesput furlang relates to the area east of the bishops garden in 1245. Wells was part of, and gave its name to, the hundred of Wells Forum.|$|E
5|$|Based on this star's {{kinematic}} properties, {{it appears}} {{to belong to a}} stellar association called the Castor Moving Group. However, Vega may be much older than this group, so the membership remains uncertain. This group contains about 16 stars, including Alpha Librae, Alpha Cephei, Castor, Fomalhaut and Vega. All members of the group are moving in nearly the same direction with similar space velocities. Membership in a moving group <b>implies</b> <b>a</b> common origin for these stars in an open cluster that has since become gravitationally unbound. The estimated age of this moving group is , and they have an average space velocity of 16.5km/s.|$|E

5|$|Bede {{described}} Aldfrith as a scholar, and {{his interest}} in learning distinguishes him from the earlier Anglo-Saxon warrior kings, such as Penda. Irish sources describe him as a sapiens, a term from the Latin for wise that refers to a scholar not usually associated with a particular church. It <b>implies</b> <b>a</b> degree of learning and wisdom that led historian Peter Hunter Blair to compare Aldfrith to the Platonic ideal of the philosopher king. Bede also {{makes it clear that}} the church in Aldfrith's day was less subject to lay control of monasteries, a practice he dated from the time of Aldfrith's death.|$|E
5|$|Paranotal {{hypothesis}}: This hypothesis {{suggests that}} the insect's wings developed from paranotal lobes, a preadaptation found in insect fossils that {{is believed to have}} assisted stabilization while hopping or falling. In favor of this hypothesis is the tendency of most insects, when startled while climbing on branches, to escape by dropping to the ground. Such lobes would have served as parachutes and enable the insect to land more softly. The theory {{suggests that the}}se lobes gradually grew larger and in a later stage developed a joint with the thorax. Even later would appear the muscles to move these crude wings. This model <b>implies</b> <b>a</b> progressive increase in the effectiveness of the wings, starting with parachuting, then gliding and finally active flight. Still, lack of substantial fossil evidence of the development of the wing joints and muscles poses a major difficulty to the theory, as does the seemingly spontaneous development of articulation and venation, and it has been largely rejected by experts in the field.|$|E
5|$|The {{auditory}} nerve was also large, suggesting good hearing, {{which may have}} been useful for auditory communication and spatial awareness. The nerve had a well-developed vestibular component as well, which <b>implies</b> <b>a</b> good sense of balance and coordination. In contrast, the nerves and brain structures associated with eyesight were smaller and undeveloped. The midbrain tectum, responsible for visual processing in reptiles, was very small in Tarbosaurus, as were the optic nerve and the oculomotor nerve, which controls eye movement. Unlike Tyrannosaurus, which had forward-facing eyes that provided some degree of binocular vision, Tarbosaurus had a narrower skull more typical of other tyrannosaurids in which the eyes faced primarily sideways. All of this suggests that Tarbosaurus relied more on its senses of smell and hearing than on its eyesight.|$|E

5|$|The genus Equus, which {{includes}} all extant equines, {{is believed to}} have evolved from Dinohippus, via the intermediate form Plesippus. One of the oldest species is Equus simplicidens, described as zebra-like with a donkey-like head shape. The oldest material to date was found in Idaho, USA. The genus appears to have spread quickly into the Old World, with the similarly aged E. livenzovensis documented from western Europe and Russia. Molecular phylogenies indicate that the most recent common ancestor of all modern equines (members of the genus Equus) lived ~5.6 (3.9-7.8) mya. Direct paleogenomic sequencing of a 700,000-year-old middle Pleistocene horse metapodial bone from Canada <b>implies</b> <b>a</b> more recent 4.07 mya for the most recent common ancestor within the range of 4.0 to 4.5 mya.|$|E
5|$|The {{large size}} of hadrosaurid eye sockets and the {{presence}} of sclerotic rings in the eyes imply acute vision and diurnal habits, evidence that sight was important to these animals. The hadrosaurid sense of hearing also appears to be strong. There is at least one example, in the related Corythosaurus, of a slender stapes (reptilian ear bone) in place, which combined with a large space for an eardrum <b>implies</b> <b>a</b> sensitive middle ear, and the hadrosaurid lagena is elongate like a crocodilian's. This indicates that the auditory portion of the inner ear was well-developed. If used as a noisemaker, the crest could also have provided recognizable differences for different species or sexes, because the differing layouts of the nasal passages corresponding to the different crest shapes would have produced intrinsically different sounds.|$|E
5|$|The minimum {{information}} produced from a successful structural alignment {{is a set}} of residues that are considered equivalent between the structures. This set of equivalences is then typically used to superpose the three-dimensional coordinates for each input structure. (Note that one input element may be fixed as a reference and therefore its superposed coordinates do not change.) The fitted structures can be used to calculate mutual RMSD values, as well as other more sophisticated measures of structural similarity such as the global distance test (GDT, the metric used in CASP). The structural alignment also <b>implies</b> <b>a</b> corresponding one-dimensional sequence alignment from which a sequence identity, or the percentage of residues that are identical between the input structures, can be calculated as a measure of how closely the two sequences are related.|$|E

5|$|The {{presence}} of {{significant amounts of}} dust around the star <b>implies</b> <b>a</b> young age {{of the system and}} led to debate about whether it had joined the main sequence or was still a pre–main sequence star However, when the star's distance was measured by Hipparcos it was revealed that Beta Pictoris was located further away than previously thought and hence was more luminous than originally believed. Once the Hipparcos results were taken into account, it was found that Beta Pictoris was located close to the zero age main sequence and was not a pre–main sequence star after all. Analysis of Beta Pictoris and other stars within the Beta Pictoris moving group suggested that they are around 12 million years old. However more recent studies indicate that the age is roughly double this at 20 to 26 million years old.|$|E

5|$|There are an {{infinite}} number of other intermediate processes in which more and more photons are absorbed and/or emitted.

This is the basic approach of QED. To calculate the probability of any interactive process between electrons and photons it is a matter of first noting, with Feynman diagrams, all the possible ways in which the process can be constructed from the three basic elements. Each diagram involves some calculation involving definite rules to find the associated probability amplitude.|$|E

5|$|The ECB targets {{interest}} rates rather than exchange rates {{and in general}} does not intervene on the foreign exchange rate markets. This {{is because of the}} implications of the Mundell–Fleming model, which <b>implies</b> <b>a</b> central bank cannot (without capital controls) maintain interest rate and exchange rate targets simultaneously, because increasing the money supply results in a depreciation of the currency. In the years following the Single European Act, the EU has liberalised its capital markets, and as the ECB has chosen monetary autonomy, the exchange-rate regime of the euro is flexible, or floating. The result of the ECB maintaining historically low {{interest rates}} and restricting money supply has been that over the last decade the euro has become expensive relative to the currency of Europe's main trading partners.

5|$|Thousands {{of female}} statuettes dated {{as early as}} c. 5500 BCE have been {{recovered}} at Mehrgarh, {{one of the most}} important Neolithic sites in world archeology, and a precursor to the great Indus Valley Civilization. In Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, major cities of the Indus valley civilization, female figurines were found in almost all households indicating the presence of cults of goddess worship. Most figurines are naked and have elaborate coiffures. Some figurines have ornaments or horns on the head and a few are in poses that expose the genitals. Several small circular objects with holes in middle, possibly representing yoni, were also found. The objects and images found suggest that the goddess cults of Indus valley civilization were associated with fertility. A seal shows a male figure standing over a seated female figure with a sickle.
