5000|$|In 1876 {{he became}} a tenured {{professor}} of chemical technology and headmaster of the chemical technical Laboratory at the polytechnic school in Karlsruhe (from 1885 the Technical University Karlsruhe). In 1887 {{he became a}} professor of chemistry {{and director of the}} Technical University Karlsruhe.In 1870 he and Adolph Emmerling, a student of Adolf von Baeyer, published a work in which the two first reported the formation of traces of indigo in a material not derived from indigo. Therefore, they have not found indigo “synthesis”, as often reported. Adolf von Baeyer succeeded in this in 1878, who also described in 1883 the correct structural formula.From 1884 he turned to the petrochemistry. He took a study trip in 1885 to the production area in the Caucasus, travelling later to the Middle East (Egypt) and to North America. Engler argued that oil originated in ancient times from animal fat. His later research focused on petroleum. To determine the viscosity, he developed the <b>Engler</b> <b>viscometer.</b> Together with Hans Höfer he published in 1919 the six-volume work [...] "Das Erdöl - Seine Physik, Chemie, Geologie, Technologie und sein Wirtschaftsbetrieb“ in two editions from 1927.|$|E
3000|$|The <b>Engler</b> <b>viscometer</b> {{was used}} in this work to {{determine}} the critical solids concentration (C s * [...]) of the Chorfa dam mud. The rheological analysis was carried out using a coaxial cylinder rheometer (Haake RS 600) which was equipped with a measuring rotor system and with an inner diameter of 22.80  mm and an outer diameter of 24.80  mm. A shear rate range was 0 – 160  s− 1, and temperature was fixed at 20  °C.|$|E
30|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to {{determine}} the mud rheological properties of the Chorfa dam (region of Mascara, Algeria) and to propose a rheological model that describes mud flow behavior. This study helps on one hand to give a better understanding of fine sediment transport dynamics in the dam, as well as contributing to reduce the dredging costs, and on other hand to valorize dredged sediments in road construction. Rheological measurements were conducted using an <b>Engler</b> <b>viscometer</b> and a Haake RS 600 rheometer. Mud samples were prepared with purified water at a range of solids concentration varying between 5.0 and 32.5 %. Besides, the physical, chemical and mineralogical characteristics of the Chorfa dam’s mud and the rheological tests were presented and the effect of solids concentration on mud viscosity was studied. The results indicate that the Chorfa dam’s mud showed a non-Newtonian behavior for solids concentration higher than the critical solids concentration, and the apparent viscosity increases with increasing solid concentration at different shear rates. In addition, for a fixed concentration, the apparent viscosity decreases with increasing shear rates, which approves the shear thinning behavior of the Chorfa dam’s mud. Fitting results of four rheological models (Bingham Plastic Model, Ostwald–de Waele (power law), Herschel–Bulkley and Casson) to the experimental data were presented. Hence, the Ostwald–de Waele model was the best fitting model for mud samples.|$|E
