5|$|A {{key element}} in combat since Genealogy of the Holy War is the Weapon Triangle, a system {{governing}} {{the strengths and weaknesses}} certain weapons and types of magic <b>have</b> <b>against</b> each other in a Scissors, Paper, Rock fashion. For weapons, lances are stronger than swords, swords are stronger than axes, and axes are stronger than lances. In magic, fire is stronger than wind, wind is stronger than thunder, and thunder is stronger than fire. For Fates, the Weapon Triangle relationships add other weapons in the following way: swords and tomes are stronger than axes and bows, axes and bows were stronger than lances and shuriken, lances and shuriken are stronger than swords and tomes, and so on. Several games use a Weapon Durability system: after being used a certain number of times, a character's weapon will break. Different entries have various systems related to character weapons: in Genealogy of the Holy War, weapons can be repaired at special shops; in Path of Radiance and future games, weapons can be bought and upgraded, while the durability system is replaced in Fates with a system where more powerful weapons weaken some of a wielder's stats.|$|E

Substantial argument between the Western Australian Government and Westpac ensued, in respect of liability if Westrail defaulted on payments.

25|$|The {{background}} to {{this was on}} Nov. 12, when Resorts reached a tentative agreement with certain bondholders, several bondholders petitioned the United States Bankruptcy Court in Camden, New Jersey, to put the company into involuntary bankruptcy to protect legal claims they might <b>have</b> <b>against</b> Trump, the real estate investor Griffin outbid for Resorts the prior year. As a result, this literally wiped out or greatly reduced the investments of the bondholders, so that Mr. Griffin could sue Trump and yet still retain a significant portion for himself.|$|E

The two teams have played in the same division since 1993 (Atlantic Division from 1993–98, Southeast Division from 1998–2013, and the new Atlantic Division since 2013). Despite the Lightning outperforming the Panthers in many ways, including winning the Stanley Cup, the Panthers hold a series record of 64–52–10 as {{of the end of}} the 2016–17 season, the best record the Panthers <b>have</b> <b>against</b> any team in the NHL. These two teams have never faced each other in the playoffs.|$|E

500|$|After being {{nominated}} for awards {{such as the}} Golden Globes, Critics' Choice, and Writers Guild of America, Deadpool was considered a serious contender for several Academy Awards despite its content and tone, including potential nominations for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Makeup and Hairstyling, and, after its Producers Guild of America nomination, Best Picture. When the film did not receive any Academy Award nominations, it was widely considered to have been [...] "". Analyzing potential reasons for this, Screen Rant's Alex Leadbeater said that though the film [...] "earned a solid thumbs up from most", it was generally not praised by top critics for offering any [...] "depth or related subversion of its genre." [...] He also noted an apparent bias that Academy voters' <b>have</b> <b>against</b> superhero films; {{the lack of a}} targeted campaign for the awards by Fox, who {{did not seem to be}} expecting any of the film's previous awards either; and the large amount of other films in contention, as [...] "2016 was, all in all, a pretty good year for movies".

500|$|Following {{the lead}} of the US Army, in 1960 the Australian Army had {{replaced}} its former [...] "triangular" [...] divisional structure of three infantry battalions under a brigade headquarters, with a [...] "pentropic" [...] organisation consisting of five larger battalions without a brigade layer between division and battalion headquarters. This had the effect of reducing the total number of Australian battalions, while increasing their individual strength. Wilton was unhappy with the pentropic structure, reasoning that the number of battalions, rather than their relative strength, was the overriding factor when considering potential overseas deployments. The US had in any event abandoned the system in June 1961. In October 1964, Wilton commissioned a review that ultimately recommended a return to the triangular formation. In the meantime, {{as a response to the}} Indonesia–Malaysia Konfrontasi, the Australian government reintroduced conscription, which Wilton fought until convinced that the government was not going to improve pay and conditions sufficiently to attract by any other means the recruits needed to meet overseas commitments. Wilton was keen to mitigate any prejudices the national servicemen might <b>have</b> <b>against</b> the regular soldiery, and vice versa; when he found a memo from an Army committee asserting that [...] "it must be recognised that the NS man was likely to be a reluctant soldier", he wrote on it [...] "This assumption not justified". In February–March 1965, following a request from the Malaysian government, Australia despatched 1Squadron, Special Air Service Regiment, and 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, to Borneo—a commitment Wilton felt able to recommend as a result of the recent decisions to increase the Army's personnel and battalion numbers.|$|E

His book, in no essential respect, contradicts the present: on the contrary...it expresses substantially the same general ideas." [...] In perhaps a gross simplification, Chambers concludes that [...] "The difference seems to be in words, not in facts or effects."

2500|$|The {{change in}} {{socio-economic}} landscape has {{also resulted in}} stark class differences within the East Sumatran society. In the 1930s, many farmers of the tobacco area (Deli-Serdang-Langkat) were told to cultivate in smaller land area while the Malay sultans, Simalungun and Karo rajas enjoyed benefit due to preferential treatment by the Dutch in terms of land leasing. Those aristocrats were able to accumulate significant wealth by [...] "leas wide tracts of land, the disposal rights over which frequently had lain traditionally with the village, to foreign companies..." [...] and seizing most of the profits. Eventually, most of the rural masses went to seek help from local political parties such as GERINDO (Gerakan Rakyat Indonesia) and PARINDRA (Partai Indonesia Raya) {{so as to make}} their grievances heard. The feelings of dissatisfaction that rural farmers <b>have</b> <b>against</b> the aristocrats then became a form of support for these political parties.|$|E
