40|$|The {{vectorial}} and dispersal {{capacities of}} flies {{make them a}} biosecurity and food safety risk on egg farms. The design of optimal control and biosecurity programs requires knowledge of species composition and patterns of abundance of the fly populations present. Although {{there have been many}} studies of flies breeding on egg farms in other countries there is little information available in Australia. We monitored numbers and species of flies breeding on cage egg farms in southern Australia and used mass marking with fluorescent resin dye to assess the dispersal of the major species from one of the farms. The main peak in fly numbers occurred in spring and early summer and was comprised predominantly of little house flies (Fannia canicularis). Significant numbers of <b>false</b> <b>stable</b> <b>flies</b> (Muscina stabulans) were trapped near accumulated manure, but relatively low numbers were present in bird housing areas. House flies (Musca domestica) were found in only low numbers or were absent at most times of the year. In the dispersal studies, 85 % of marked F. canicularis and 67 % of marked M. stabulans were trapped within 255 m of the layer sheds. The greatest distance from the farm at which marked F. canicularis flies were captured was 739 m for traps and 1. 25 km for tapes whereas M. stabulans flies were trapped at all distances including in the most distant trap nearly 2 km from the farm.

50|$|M. stabulans and M. levida {{belong to}} the {{ecological}} group of the filth fly. Muscina flies are attracted to decaying organic matter, and are commonly found on corpses, urine, and feces. Muscina flies are useful in determining post-mortem intervals. The presence of Muscina larvae in diapers and on genitalia can indicate a timeline {{for the period of}} neglect in infant or elderly death cases. From the second instar phase onwards, M. stabulans are predacious upon other larvae, and will eat other forensically important arthropods. Presence of the <b>false</b> <b>stable</b> <b>fly</b> larvae on buried bodies enables investigators to estimate the time of death. The antennae of the <b>false</b> <b>stable</b> <b>fly</b> can detect buried bodies. In these cases, the fly lays its eggs on top of the soil, and the hatching larvae will then burrow and invade the corpse. The <b>false</b> <b>stable</b> <b>fly</b> will also lay its eggs in blood, {{even in the absence of}} a body. The presence of eggs in blood allows entomologists to estimate the time of injury, which helps investigators and crime scene investigators. Muscina stabulans are found on corpses in autumn and winter. In one experiment, M. stabulans larvae were found on a rabbit corpse two days after death. M. stabulans are present in the fresh stage, but are predominantly found in the adipocere-like stage, characterized by the hydrolysis of the carcass’ fatty tissue. In this phase, the carcass loses its shape and is a mass of hair, fat, skin, and cartilage. The skin eventually becomes rigid, protecting the larvae on the carcass and the insects living underneath the carcass.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Stable</b> <b>flies</b> are {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} major blood-feeding pests in the US livestock industry, causing losses running into billions of dollars annually. Adult <b>stable</b> <b>flies</b> are highly attracted to Alsynite traps; however, Alsynite is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain and is expensive. RESULTS: Here, we report on the development of a less expensive and more efficacious trap based upon a white panel with the option to add visual and olfactory stimuli for enhanced <b>stable</b> <b>fly</b> trapping. White panel traps caught twice as many <b>stable</b> <b>flies</b> than Alsynite traps. Baiting the traps with synthetic manure volatiles increased catches 2 – 3 -fold. Electroretinographic recordings of <b>stable</b> <b>flies</b> showed strong peaks of visual sensitivities occurring at 330 – 360 nm, 460 – 525 nm and 605 – 635 nm. A laboratory study indicated that young <b>stable</b> <b>flies</b> are more responsive to white,whereas gravid females prefer blue; in the field, white traps caught more <b>stable</b> <b>flies</b> than patterned or blue-black traps.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of EntomologyLudek ZurekStable flies (Stomoxys calcitrans L.) are blood-feeding insects {{with a great}} {{negative}} impact on livestock resulting in annual losses around $ 2 billion in the USA alone. One {{of the main reasons}} for such an impact is because <b>stable</b> <b>fly</b> management is very difficult. <b>Stable</b> <b>fly</b> larvae develop primarily in animal manure and live bacteria were shown to be essential for <b>stable</b> <b>fly</b> development. I hypothesized that the microbial community of horse manure changes over time and {{plays an important role in}} <b>stable</b> <b>fly</b> fitness. Two-choice bioassays were conducted using 2 week old horse manure (control) and aging horse manure (fresh to 5 week old) to evaluate the effect of manure age on <b>stable</b> <b>fly</b> oviposition. The results showed that fresh manure did not stimulate oviposition and that the attractiveness increased as manure aged but started to decline after 3 weeks. <b>Stable</b> <b>fly</b> eggs artificially placed on 1, 2, and 3 week old manure resulted in significantly higher survival and heavier adults comparing to those developing in fresh, 4, and 5 week old manure. Analysis of the bacterial community of aging horse manure by 454 -pyrosequencing of 16 S rDNA revealed a major shift from strict anaerobes (e. g. Clostridium, Eubacterium, Prevotella, Bacteroidales) in fresh manure to facultative anaerobes and strict aerobes (e. g. Rhizobium, Devosia, Brevundimonas, Sphingopyxis, Comamonas, Pseudomonas) in 1 - 5 week old manure. Identified volatile compounds emitted from 2 and 3 week old horse manure included phenol, indole, p-cresol, and m-cresol. However, none of them stimulated <b>stable</b> <b>fly</b> oviposition in two-choice assays. In conclusion, the microbial community of 2 and 3 week old horse manure stimulates <b>stable</b> <b>fly</b> oviposition and provides a suitable habitat for <b>stable</b> <b>fly</b> development.

Largest numbers of <b>stable</b> <b>flies</b> were collected in samples from grass clippings, spilled silage, silage {{at the base of}} the bunker silo and spilled silage. The immature stages of the house fly were rarely collected from piled manure and grass. Spilled grain, haylage, and spilled grain produced large numbers of house fly immatures. ^ Although these two species develop in similar habitats, they were collected together in only 3 % of the samples collected. Differences in the physical parameters of the materials and a seasonal separation of the two species may be an explanation. ^ Adult <b>stable</b> <b>flies</b> were monitored during three winters at two, four, and 13 locations with Alsynite fiberglass traps and by examination of the interiors of buildings.

40|$|<b>Stable</b> <b>flies</b> {{are among}} the most {{important}} blood feeding ectoparasites of cattle worldwide. The livestock industry is losing more than $ 2 billion dollar annually in the United States alone. Moist decaying vegetative material with bacteria supports larval development. Temperature and diet quality are important factors for <b>stable</b> <b>fly</b> devel-opment, affecting development rates, adult survival, and size, but how temperature affects adult size and interacts with nutrition is unknown. This study characterizes the relationship of temperature and diet quality in the development of <b>stable</b> <b>flies.</b> Two statistical models were used to analyze the effect of temperature alone (Lysyk, 1998) and temperature-diet interactions (Boetel, et al. 2003). Temperature drives larval development, at higher temperatures <b>stable</b> <b>flies</b> develop faster. Interaction of the two factors affects when larvae pupate, larvae exposed to good nutrition and low temperatures take 90 % more time than those at bad nutrition under high temperatures. Diet controls adult size, bigger flies grew on the standard diet at low temperatures, but also temperature influences size when flies are starving, and grew larger at higher temperatures. Results from this experiment show that temperature and diet interact in complex manners to affect <b>stable</b> <b>fly</b> development. At higher temperatures, development is fast but size is reduced. At low temperatures, development is slow, and although flies are exposed longer to predation, size increases, which may increase reproductive success. However, the interaction changes when food is limited, it is better to grow at small size for an opportunity to reproduce. Understanding of <b>stable</b> <b>flies</b> biology helps to discern population dynamics. <b>Stable</b> <b>flies</b> exhibit an evolutionary plasticity allowing successful development in a variety of conditions. This plasticity may account for their global colonization and prevalence in a variety of habitats. Trade-offs between fast growth and small size, and slow growth and larger size on <b>stable</b> <b>flies,</b> needs further study. Studies that compare <b>stable</b> <b>flies</b> size from the field are required to understand their phenology and how these conclusions could be apply. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Stable</b> <b>flies,</b> Stomoxys calcitrans (L.), {{are among}} the most {{damaging}} arthropod pests of cattle worldwide. The last estimate of their economic impact on United States cattle production was published 20 yr ago and placed losses at $ 608 million. Subsequently, several studies of effects of <b>stable</b> <b>flies</b> on beef cattle weight gain and feed efficiency have been published, and <b>stable</b> <b>flies</b> have become increasingly recognized as pests of cattle on pasture and range. We analyzed published studies and developed yield-loss functions to relate <b>stable</b> <b>fly</b> infestation levels to cattle productivity, and then estimated the economic impact of <b>stable</b> <b>flies</b> on cattle production in the United States. Four industry sectors were considered: dairy, cow-calf, pastured stockers, and feeder cattle. In studies reporting <b>stable</b> <b>fly</b> infestation levels of individual herds, median annual per animal production losses were estimated to be 139 kg of milk for dairy cows, and 6, 26, and 9 kg body weight for preweanling calves, pastured stockers, and feeder cattle, respectively. The 200, 000 <b>stable</b> <b>flies</b> emerging from an average sized winter hay feeding site reduce annual milk production of 50 dairy cows by an estimated 890 kg and weight gain of 50 preweanling calves, stockers, or feeder cattle by 58, 680, or 84 kg. In 2009 dollars, the value of these losses would be $ 254, $ 132, $ 1, 279, or $ 154, respectively. Using cattle inventories and average prices for 2005 – 2009, and median monthly infestation levels, national losses are estimated to be $ 360 million for dairy cattle, $ 358 million for cow-calf herds, $ 1, 268 million for pastured cattle, and $ 226 million for cattle on feed, for a total impact to U. S. cattle industries of $ 2, 211 million per year. Excluded from these estimates are effects of <b>stable</b> <b>flies</b> on feed conversion efficiency, animal breeding success, and effects of infested cattle on pasture and water quality. Additional research on the effects of <b>stable</b> <b>flies</b> on high-production dairy cows and nursing beef calves is needed to increase the reliability of the estimates...|$|R
40|$|<b>Stable</b> <b>flies,</b> Stomoxys calcitrans (L.), are {{a serious}} pest to beef cattle in {{confined}} animal feeding operations (CAFOs) by causing economic {{losses in the}} form of reduced feed intake and feed efficiency, resulting in reduced weight gain.

Sex ratio manipulation in response to host quality has been modeled as being adaptive through an effect of host quality on the size and hence offspring production of daughters. 5. cameronis response to host species may instead be adaptive through an effect on larval survivorship, the development time of daughters, and the size of sons. There was greater survival of daughters than sons on <b>stable</b> <b>flies.</b> Controlling for host size, I found that development time of daughters was about 2 % less on <b>stable</b> <b>flies</b> than on house flies. The decrease in development time corresponds to a 2 % increase in fitness as estimated by r, the intrinsic rate of increase, and is equivalent to about a 9 % increase in offspring production. Sons were about 2 % larger from house <b>flies</b> than <b>stable</b> <b>flies,</b> which may increase offspring production by up to 3 %. Host species had no consistent effect on size of daughters or development time of sons. In addition to the response to host species, mothers oviposited {{a greater proportion}} of daughters in larger <b>stable</b> <b>fly</b> hosts. Whether this behavior is adaptive is unclear.
