The first of these proteins to be studied were the viral fusion proteins, which allow an <b>enveloped</b> <b>virus</b> to insert its genetic material into the host cell (enveloped viruses are those surrounded by a lipid bilayer; some others have only a protein coat). Eukaryotic cells also use fusion proteins, the best-studied of which are the SNAREs. SNARE proteins are used to direct all vesicular intracellular trafficking. Despite years of study, much is still unknown about the function of this protein class. In fact, there is still an active debate regarding whether SNAREs are linked to early docking or participate later in the fusion process by facilitating hemifusion.|$|E
25|$|Entry of HSV into a {{host cell}} {{involves}} several glycoproteins {{on the surface}} of the <b>enveloped</b> <b>virus</b> binding to their transmembrane receptors on the cell surface. Many of these receptors are then pulled inwards by the cell, which is thought to open a ring of three gHgL heterodimers stabilizing a compact conformation of the gB glycoprotein, so that it springs out and punctures the cell membrane. The envelope covering the virus particle then fuses with the cell membrane, creating a pore through which the contents of the viral envelope enters the host cell.|$|E

The first of these proteins to be studied were the viral fusion proteins, which allow an <b>enveloped</b> <b>virus</b> to insert its genetic material into the host cell (enveloped viruses are those surrounded by a lipid bilayer; some others have only a protein coat). Broadly, there are two classes of viral fusion proteins: acidic and pH-independent. pH independent fusion proteins can function under neutral conditions and fuse with the plasma membrane, allowing viral entry into the cell. Viruses utilizing this scheme included HIV, measles and herpes. Acidic fusion proteins such as those found on influenza are only activated when in the low pH of acidic endosomes and must first be endocytosed to gain entry into the cell.|$|E

We have shown that herpes virus, like measles, Sindbis and vesicular stomatitis viruses, can also be rendered photosensitive if the virions are removed from the protective ffects of organic compounds contained in the virus harvest. Under the very same conditions, non-enveloped viruses (vac-cinia, polio and adenoviruses) are completely photoresistant.

25|$|JEV is a {{virus from}} the family Flaviviridae, part of the Japanese {{encephalitis}} serocomplex of 9 genetically and antigenically related viruses, some which are particularly severe in horses, and four known to infect humans including West Nile virus. The <b>enveloped</b> <b>virus</b> {{is closely related to}} the West Nile virus and the St. Louis encephalitis virus. The positive sense single-stranded RNA genome is packaged in the capsid which is formed by the capsid protein. The outer envelope is formed by envelope protein and is the protective antigen. It aids in entry of the virus into the inside of the cell. The genome also encodes several nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2a, NS2b, NS3, N4a, NS4b, NS5). NS1 is produced as secretory form also. NS3 is a putative helicase, and NS5 is the viral polymerase. It has been noted that Japanese encephalitis infects the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and rapidly accumulates substantial amounts of viral proteins for the Japanese Encephalitis.|$|E
500|$|Humans {{and higher}} {{primates}} also produce [...] "natural antibodies" [...] that {{are present in}} serum before viral infection. Natural antibodies have been defined as antibodies that are produced without any previous infection, vaccination, other foreign antigen exposure or passive immunization. These antibodies can activate the classical complement pathway leading to lysis of <b>enveloped</b> <b>virus</b> particles long before the adaptive immune response is activated. Many natural antibodies are directed against the disaccharide galactose α(1,3)-galactose (α-Gal), which is found as a terminal sugar on glycosylated cell surface proteins, and generated in response to production of this sugar by bacteria contained in the human gut. Rejection of xenotransplantated organs is thought to be, in part, the result of natural antibodies circulating in the serum of the recipient binding to α-Gal antigens expressed on the donor tissue.|$|E

40|$|The 2014 West Africa Ebola {{outbreak}} saw {{a substantial}} number of healthcare workers (HCWs) being infected, despite the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). PPE is intended to protect HCWs when caring for patients with Ebola virus disease (EVD), but PPE {{may play a role in}} the spread of Ebola in healthcare environments. Before the removal of PPE, chemical disinfection may prevent the transfer of pathogens to HCWs, but the efficacy of common disinfectants against <b>enveloped</b> <b>viruses,</b> such as Ebola, on PPE surfaces is relatively unknown. The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of two common disinfectants, chlorine bleach (Clorox® bleach) and quaternary ammonium (Micro-Chem Plus®), used in healthcare settings for inactivation of <b>enveloped</b> <b>viruses</b> on PPE. The virucidal activity of the two disinfectants were tested against bacteriophage Φ 6, an enveloped, non-pathogenic surrogate for <b>enveloped</b> <b>viruses,</b> on Tyvek suit surfaces. Virus was dried onto Tyvek suit surface, exposed to the disinfectants at use-dilution for a contact time of one minute, and the surviving virus was quantified using a double agar layer (DAL) assay.

40|$|AbstractMany <b>enveloped</b> <b>viruses</b> {{complete}} their replication cycle by forming vesicles that bud from the plasma membrane. Some viruses encode “late” (L) domain motifs that {{are able to}} hijack host proteins involved in the vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) pathway, a cellular budding process that gives rise to multivesicular bodies and that is topologically equivalent to virus budding. Although many <b>enveloped</b> <b>viruses</b> share this mechanism, examples of viruses that require additional viral factors and viruses that appear to be independent of the VPS pathway have been identified. Alternative mechanisms for virus budding could involve other topologically similar process such as cell abscission, which occurs following cytokinesis, or virus budding could proceed spontaneously as a result of lipid microdomain accumulation of viral proteins.

40|$|International audienceSimilar to many {{eukaryotic}} viruses (and unlike bacteriophages), viruses infecting archaea {{are often}} encased in lipid-containing envelopes. However, {{the mechanisms of}} their morphogenesis and egress remain unexplored. Here, we used dual-axis electron tomography (ET) to characterize the morphogenesis of Sulfolobus spindle-shaped virus 1 (SSV 1), the prototype of the family Fuselloviridae and representative of the most abundant archaea-specific group of viruses. Our results show that SSV 1 assembly and egress are concomitant and occur at the cellular cytoplasmic membrane via a process highly reminiscent of the budding of <b>enveloped</b> <b>viruses</b> that infect eukaryotes. The viral nucleoprotein complexes are extruded {{in the form of}} previously unknown rod-shaped intermediate structures which have an envelope continuous with the host membrane. Further maturation into characteristic spindle-shaped virions takes place while virions remain attached to the cell surface. Our data also revealed the formation of constricted ring-like structures which resemble the budding necks observed prior to the ESCRT machinery-mediated membrane scission during egress of various <b>enveloped</b> <b>viruses</b> of eukaryotes. Collectively, we provide evidence that archaeal spindle-shaped viruses contain a lipid envelope acquired upon budding of the viral nucleoprotein complex through the host cytoplasmic membrane. The proposed model bears a clear resemblance to the egress strategy employed by <b>enveloped</b> eu-karyotic <b>viruses</b> and raises important questions as to how the archaeal single-layered membrane composed of tetraether lipids can undergo scission. IMPORTANCE The replication of <b>enveloped</b> <b>viruses</b> has been extensively studied in eukaryotes but has remained unexplored for <b>enveloped</b> <b>viruses</b> infecting bacteria and archaea. Here, we provide a sequential view on the assembly and egress of SSV 1, a pro-totypic archaeal virus. The observed process is highly similar to the budding of eukaryotic <b>enveloped</b> <b>viruses,</b> including human immunodeficiency virus, influenza virus, and Ebola virus. The present study is the first to characterize such a phenomenon in archaeal cells, showing that membrane budding is not an exclusive feature of eukaryotic viruses. Our results provide significant insights into the biogenesis and architecture of unique, spindle-shaped virions that infect archaea. Furthermore, our findings open doors for future inquiries into (i) the evolution of the virus budding process, (ii) mechanistic details of virus-mediated membrane scission in Archaea, and (iii) elucidation of virus-and host-encoded molecular players responsible for archaeal membrane and surface remodeling...|$|R
