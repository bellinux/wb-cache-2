5000|$|<b>Examorelin</b> {{releases}} more GH {{than does}} growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) in humans, and produces synergistic effects on GH release {{in combination with}} GHRH, resulting in [...] "massive" [...] increases in plasma GH levels even with only low doses of <b>examorelin.</b> Pre-administration of GH blunts the GH-releasing effect of <b>examorelin,</b> while, in contrast, fully abolishing the effect of GHRH. Pre-treatment with IGF-1 also blunts the GH-elevating effect of <b>examorelin.</b> Testosterone, testosterone enanthate, and ethinylestradiol, though not oxandrolone, {{have been found to}} significantly potentiate the GH-releasing effects of <b>examorelin</b> in humans. In accordance, likely due to increases in sex steroid levels, puberty has also been found to significantly augment the GH-elevating actions of <b>examorelin</b> in humans.|$|E
50|$|<b>Examorelin</b> {{substantially}} and dose-dependently increases plasma {{levels of}} growth hormone (GH) in animals and humans. In addition, similarly to pralmorelin (GHRP-2) and GHRP-6, it slightly and dose-dependently stimulates {{the release of}} prolactin, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and cortisol in humans. There are conflicting reports {{on the ability of}} <b>examorelin</b> to elevate insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1) levels in humans, with some studies finding no increase and others finding a slight yet statistically significant increase. <b>Examorelin</b> does not affect plasma levels of glucose, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), or thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in humans.|$|E
50|$|<b>Examorelin</b> reached phase II {{clinical}} trials {{for the treatment}} of growth hormone deficiency and congestive heart failure but did not complete development and was never marketed.|$|E
50|$|A partial and {{reversible}} {{tolerance to}} the GH-releasing effects of <b>examorelin</b> occurs in humans with long-term administration (50-75% decrease in efficacy {{over the course}} of weeks to months).|$|E
50|$|<b>Examorelin</b> (INN) (developmental code names EP-23905, MF-6003), {{also known}} as hexarelin, is a potent, synthetic, peptidic, orally-active, centrally-penetrant, and highly {{selective}} agonist of the ghrelin/growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) and a growth hormone secretagogue which was developed by Mediolanum Farmaceutici. It is a hexapeptide with the amino acid sequence His-D-2-methyl-Trp-Ala-Trp-D-Phe-Lys-NH2 which was derived from GHRP-6. These GH-releasing peptides have no sequence similarity to ghrelin, but mimic ghrelin by acting as agonists at the ghrelin receptor.|$|E
50|$|Growth hormone secretagogues (GSHs) are a {{class of}} drugs which act as secretagogues (i.e., induce the secretion) of growth hormone (GH). They include {{agonists}} of the ghrelin/growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR), such as ghrelin (lenomorelin), pralmorelin (GHRP-2), GHRP-6, <b>examorelin</b> (hexarelin), ipamorelin, and ibutamoren (MK-677), and agonists of the growth hormone-releasing hormone receptor (GHRHR), such as growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) (somatorelin), CJC-1295, sermorelin, and tesamorelin. Many also induce the secretion of {{insulin-like growth factor 1}} (IGF-1), as well as of other hypothalamic-pituitary hormones such as prolactin and cortisol. The main clinical application of these agents is the treatment of growth hormone deficiency. They also see black market use, similarly to anabolic steroids, for bodybuilding purposes.|$|E
