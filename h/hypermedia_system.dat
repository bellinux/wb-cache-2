40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} {{the development of}} adaptive <b>hypermedia</b> <b>systems</b> and proposes adaptive characteristics for third generation adaptive <b>hypermedia</b> <b>systems.</b> First generation adaptive <b>hypermedia</b> <b>systems</b> predated the World-Wide Web (WWW) and were primarily single user adaptive <b>hypermedia</b> <b>systems.</b> Second generation systems have exploited the distributed nature and ease of authoring of the WWW to develop more robust and mature adaptive <b>hypermedia</b> <b>systems.</b> While these systems are a dramatic improvement over first generation systems, they have several limitations that limited the effectiveness of adaptation. These limitations include limited adaptation through one-dimensional, stereotypical user models, coarse granularity of adaptive support, closed adaptive hyperspaces with sharp boundaries, limited authoring support, and limited and nonconstructive communications between the user and the adaptive model. Third generation adaptive <b>hypermedia</b> <b>systems</b> must address these shortcomings to fully exploit the potential of adaptive <b>hypermedia.</b> Future <b>systems</b> must provide explicit, fine-grained adaptation support that the user can easily tailor and refine to provide highly relevant multidimensional adaptation. Future adaptive <b>hypermedia</b> <b>systems</b> must be open systems with soft boundaries that are expandable and incorporate resources from non-adaptive hypermedia with gradual degradation of support. Finally, adaptive systems must be relatively easy to build and maintain.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, <b>hypermedia</b> <b>systems</b> have become {{increasingly}} open, distributed, and modular. As {{a direct result of}} this, open <b>hypermedia</b> <b>systems</b> have been increasingly successful in providing middleware services such as linking to a large set of clients. This paper presents a new approach to service provision in open <b>hypermedia</b> <b>systems</b> based on the concept of multiple open services. The overall idea with multiple open services is to rethink the way in which services are provided to clients. The goal is to split up services into components, each of which provides a general, scalable, and functionally independent (orthogonal) service. This results in a highly flexible architectural framework that can serve as a vehicle to further investigate many of the open issues relating to open <b>hypermedia</b> <b>systems.</b> The approach {{can be viewed as a}} natural next step in the evolution towards more open, distributed, and modular <b>hypermedia</b> <b>systems.</b> The concept of multiple open services is described in detail, and a proof of concept implementation called Construct is presented...|$|R

40|$|Introduction This paper {{surveys the}} use of hand-made and {{computed}} links in <b>hypermedia</b> <b>systems</b> and contrasts precomputation and dynamic computation of those links which are computed.

Many <b>hypermedia</b> <b>systems</b> were designed with a rather ad-hoc approach, with new ideas for link creation and maintenance being added as fixes to perceived problems in operational systems. For example, open <b>hypermedia</b> <b>systems</b> introduced externalised links, stored separately from the data they linked, however externalised links highlighted the problem of referential integrity, so dynamic linking approaches were introduced as a fix to that problem (Davis et al., 1992).
