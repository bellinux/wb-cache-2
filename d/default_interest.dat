25|$|Japan has various laws restricting {{interest}} rates. Under civil law, {{the maximum}} interest rate is between 15% and 20% per year depending upon the principal amount (larger amounts having a lower maximum rate). Interest in excess of 20% is subject to criminal penalties (the criminal law maximum was 29.2% until it was lowered by legislation in 2010). <b>Default</b> <b>interest</b> on late payments may be charged at up to 1.46 times the ordinary maximum (i.e., 21.9% to 29.2%), while pawn shops may charge interest of up to 9% per month (i.e., 108% per year).|$|E
2500|$|Relatively {{few cases}} are ever brought {{directly}} by consumers, given {{the complexity of}} litigation, cost, and its worth if claims are small. In order to ensure consumer protection laws are actually enforced, the Competition and Markets Authority has jurisdiction to bring consumer regulation cases on behalf of consumers after receiving complaints. Under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 section 70 and Schedule 3, the CMA has jurisdiction to collect and consider complaints, and then seek injunctions in the courts to stop businesses using unfair terms (under any legislation). The CRA 2015 is formally broader than UCTA 1977 in that it covers any unfair terms, not just exemption clauses, but narrower in that it only operates for consumer contracts. Under section 2, a consumer is an [...] "individual acting for purposes that are wholly or mainly outside that individual's trade, business, craft or profession." [...] However, while the United Kingdom could always opt for greater protection, when it translated the Directive into national law it opted to follow the bare minimum requirements, and not to cover every contract term. Under section 64, a court may only assess the fairness of terms that do not specify [...] "the main {{subject matter of the}} contract", or terms which relate to [...] "appropriateness of the price payable" [...] of the thing sold. Outside such [...] "core" [...] terms, a term may be unfair, under section 62 if it is not one that is individually negotiated, and if contrary to good faith it causes a significant imbalance in the rights and obligations of the parties. A list of examples of unfair terms are set out in Schedule 2. In DGFT v First National Bank plc the House of Lords held that given the purpose of consumer protection, the predecessor to section 64 should be construed tightly and Lord Bingham stated good faith implies fair, open and honest dealing. This all meant that the bank's practice of charging its (higher) <b>default</b> <b>interest</b> rate to customers who had (lower) interest rate set by a court under a debt restructuring plan could be assessed for fairness, but the term did not create such an imbalance given the bank wished only to have its normal interest. This appeared to grant a relatively open role for the Office of Fair Trading to intervene against unfair terms. However, in OFT v Abbey National plc the Supreme Court held that if a term related in any way to price, it could not by virtue of section 64 be assessed for fairness. All the High Street banks, including Abbey National, had a practice of charging high fees if account holders, unplanned, exceeded through withdrawals their normal overdraft limit. Overturning a unanimous Court of Appeal, the Supreme Court viewed that if the thing being charged for was part of a [...] "package" [...] of services, and the bank's remuneration for its services partly came from these fees, then there could be no assessment of the fairness of terms. This controversial stance was tempered by their Lordships' emphasis that any charges must be wholly transparent, though its compatibility with EU law is not yet established by the European Court of Justice, and it appears questionable that it would be decided the same way if inequality of bargaining power had been taken into account, as the Directive requires.|$|E

Empirical evidence indicates that in most cases duration for defaultable bonds is much shorter than for their default-free counterparts because of the negative relation between <b>default</b> risk and <b>interest</b> rates. Results suggest that the duration measure must be adjusted {{for the effects of}} default risk and stochastic interest rates to achieve an effective bond portfolio immunization.

50|$|The {{court held}} that as the damages claimed by GFA were in excess of {{what they would have}} {{received}} from the lease had it gone the full five years, and ruled that the default clause was not liquidated damages, but instead were penal in nature, and accordingly GFA’s damages claim here was not legally enforceable. As GFA were effectively claiming 2 lots of interest for the same period, one lot of interest contained in the remaining lease payments, and a second a <b>default</b> <b>interest</b> of 32%, meant that the <b>default</b> <b>interest</b> was not enforceable in the first place, not requiring the court to consider whether the rate of 32% was excessive.|$|E
50|$|Mohammed Aziz was a {{resident}} in Spain. He {{took out a}} mortgage with Caixa d'Estalvis de Catalunya (the Savings Bank of Catalonia), secured on his home at an annual <b>default</b> <b>interest</b> rate of 18.75%. The Caixa was entitled to call in the loan upon a default by Aziz. Clause 15 of the contract also purported to give the right to reclaim any debt, quantifiable immediately. Aziz did default, and the Caixa quantified the debt through a notary, adding contractual and <b>default</b> <b>interest.</b> The bank began repossession of the property and a week before eviction, Aziz applied to the Spanish court to annul clause 15 on grounds of unfairness under the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Directive. No provision in Spanish law foresaw this possibility, nor was there any interim relief. Under Spanish law, final vesting of the mortgaged property was irreversible even if a term was challenged as unfair before the court. The only exception was where a consumer made preliminary registration for the application to be annulled before a marginal note regarding a security certificate.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{theoretical}} framework to analyze the impacts of credit and technology shocks on business cycle dynamics, where firms rely on banks and households for capital financing.

The paper advances a new modelling approach {{for the analysis of}} financial intermediation and firm defaults that takes account of the financial implications of such defaults for both households and banks. Results from a calibrated version of the model highlight the role of financial institutions in the transmission of credit and technology shocks to the real economy. A positive credit shock, defined as a rise in the loan to deposit ratio, increases output, consumption, hours and productivity, and reduces the spread between loan and deposit rates. The effects of the credit shock tend to be highly persistent even without price rigidities and habit persistence in consumption behaviour. bank credit, financial intermediation, firm heterogeneity and <b>defaults,</b> <b>interest</b> rate spread, real financial linkages...|$|R
