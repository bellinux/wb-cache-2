40|$|Supervising Professor: Cyrus D. Cantrell Effects of a Gaussian {{pulse shape}} and beam profile on Electromagnetically-Induced Trans-parency (EIT) are studied {{in a strong}} probe laser {{intensity}} regime under the context of laser pulse propagation. By adopting a pulse-sequencing method, we show that EIT for an intense probe laser can be realized when both incident laser envelopes having both temporal and transverse radial profiles. A proper selection of two relevant parameters, i. e. time peak location and beam diameter, of two injected lasers will implement this pulse-sequencing technique into our numerical experiments on EIT and lead to an <b>enhanced</b> <b>EIT</b> behavior for a strong probe laser beam. vi TABLE OF CONTENTS Dedication [...] . i...|$|R
40|$|Outputs from coupled general {{circulation}} models (CGCMs) {{are used in}} examining tropical Pacific decadal variability (TPDV) and their relationships with El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Herein TPDV is classified as either ENSO-induced TPDV (EIT) or ENSO-like TPDV (ELT), based on their correlations with a decadal modulation index of ENSO amplitude and spatial pattern. EIT is identified by the leading EOF mode of the low-pass filtered equatorial subsurface temperature anomalies and is highly correlated with the decadal ENSO modulation index. This mode is characterized by an east–west dipole structure along the equator. ELT is usually defined by the first EOF mode of subsurface temperature, of which the spatial structure is similar to ENSO. Generally, this mode is insignificantly correlated with the decadal modulation of ENSO. EIT closely interacts with the residuals induced by ENSO asymmetries, both of which show similar spatial structures. On the other hand, ELT is controlled by slowly varying ocean adjustments analogous to a recharge oscillator of ENSO. Both types of TPDV have similar spectral peaks on a decadal-to-interdecadal time scale. Interestingly, the variances of both types of TPDV depend {{on the strength of}} connection between El Niño–La Niña residuals and EIT, such that the strong two-way feedback between them <b>enhances</b> <b>EIT</b> and reduces ELT. The strength of the two-way feedback is also related to ENSO variability. The flavors of El Niño–La Niña with respect to changes in the tropical Pacific mean state tend to be well simulated when ENSO variability is larger in CGCMs. As a result, stronger ENSO variability leads to intensified interactive feedback between ENSO residuals and <b>enhanced</b> <b>EIT</b> in CGCMs...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a multitasking electrical impedance tomography (EIT) {{system designed to}} improve the flexibility and durability of an existing EIT system. The ability of the present EIT system to detect, locate, and reshape objects was evaluated by four different experiments. The {{results of the study}} show that the system can detect and locate an object with a diameter as small as 1. 5 [*]mm in a testing tank with a diameter of 134 [*]mm. Moreover, the results demonstrate the ability of the current system to reconstruct an image of several dielectric object shapes. Based on the results of the experiments, the programmable EIT system can adapt the EIT system for different applications without the need to implement a new EIT system, which may help to save time and cost. The setup for all the experiments consisted of a testing tank with an attached 16 -electrode array made of titanium alloy grade 2. The titanium alloy electrode was used to <b>enhance</b> <b>EIT</b> system’s durability and lifespan...|$|R

Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) {{is a relatively new}} imaging method for exploiting these differences. However, the accuracy of data capture is one of the difficult problems urgently to be solved in the clinical application of EIT technology. A new concept of EIT sensitizers is put forward in this paper with the goal of expanding the contrast ratio of tumor and healthy tissue to <b>enhance</b> <b>EIT</b> imaging quality. The use of nanoparticles for changing tumor characteristics and determining the infiltration vector for easier detection has been widely accepted in the biomedical field. Ultra-pure water, normal saline, and gold nanoparticles, three kinds of material with large differences in electrical characteristics, are considered as sensitizers and undergo mathematical model analysis and animal experimentation. Our preliminary results suggest that nanoparticles are promising for sensitization work. Furthermore, in experimental and simulation results, we found that we should select different sensitizers for the detection of different types and stages of tumor.

40|$|Much {{research}} has indicated that people prefer others with similar attitudes; however, little {{research has}} examined boundary conditions of this well-documented phenomenon.

From an attitude strength perspective, attitude uncertainty should weaken the attitude 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>impact</b> in evaluating a (dis) similar other and, thus, weaken the similarity-attraction link. On the other hand, uncertainty might motivate a need for validation that another 2 ̆ 7 s agreement could satisfy.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} surge of {{critical}} interest in the study of committees in Westminster-derived parliaments. However, one type of committee has escaped review: Australia 2 ̆ 7 s dedicated electoral matters committees (EMC). This article investigates the policy impact of one of Australia 2 ̆ 7 s EMCs, the Victorian EMC. Using a mixed-methods case study of the Victorian EMC 2 ̆ 7 s 2008 / 2009 inquiry into voter participation and informal voting, this article argues the Victorian EMC influenced the introduction of direct electoral enrolment in June 2010 through the Electoral Amendment (Electoral Participation) Bill. Consistent with the mixed-methods case study literature in committee studies, the analysis occurs in two parts. To assess the Victorian EMC 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>impact</b> on the Victorian government, this article conducts quantitative analysis of the number of references made in second reading speeches for the Bill, and then content analysis. Further to this, building on the work of Hawes (1993) and Russell and Benton (2011) on ‘non-quantifiable’ aspects of committee impact, this article examines the Victorian EMC 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>impact</b> on the Victorian Electoral Commission (VEC), another inquiry stakeholder.
