500|$|Ali {{learned that}} his {{regurgitation}} talents {{had the potential to}} entertain and to earn money through performance at the age of fifteen:I tried out my tricks first of all in the street, swallowing many glasses of water and then pouring forth a great fountain {{from one side of the}} road to the other... A cafe proprietor saw me doing this one day, and chased me down the street. I thought he wanted to beat me up, but no—all he did was to put a coin <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> ask me to repeat the trick. Finally, he was so delighted that he asked me to come to his cafe and entertain the customers. Taking his abilities on the road, Ali met an Italian man in Cairo who signed him to a contract for music hall performances. Ali performed under contract throughout Europe and at times for heads of state. According to Ali, in or about 1914 he was summoned by Tsar NicholasII of Russia to perform at the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg, Russia. He stated that the Tsar [...] "must have liked my performance because he awarded me a special decoration, which is now one of my most treasured possessions." [...] Following World War I, Ali began managing his own affairs and toured the world, learning more tricks as he went.|$|E
2500|$|In Delhi, Basu {{lived at}} Pamposh Enclave, Nehru Place, till {{the age of}} eight and studied at Apeejay High School. Her family then shifted to Kolkata, where she {{attended}} Bhavan's Gangabux Kanoria Vidyamandir, located in Bidhannagar. In her school, Basu was appointed as the head girl and was fondly called 'Lady Goonda' due to her short and commanding personality. She remarked [...] "As a child, I was a tomboy and I was pampered a lot, due to which I became very naughty. I used to keep a stick <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> straighten out all the colony boys if they acted smart. I used to be very short {{as a child and}} I was the monitor in school. When the tall boys would be up to mischief, I'd jump on their back during breaks and pull their hair and beat them up". Basu was enrolled in medical science studies until twelfth standard, but switched to commerce thereafter.|$|E
2500|$|Among {{the many}} stunts shot {{there was a}} {{particular}} sequence in which Roshan had to dance using a large transparent ball as a property. The actor {{said that he had}} trained the hardest to practice spin in one of the dance sequence. Roshan said, [...] "I trained for a month. It was not a long piece of dance but there was lot of jazz ballet where I was required to spin as there is a ball <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> I am playing with it as well as dancing. None of my songs up till now have spin because I am very bad at it." [...] The cinematographer of the movie Sudeep Chatterjee was asked to interpret the script completely so that Bhansali could understand his perception too. Praising his director to be very open and cooperative Chatterjee acknowledged in an interview about Bhansali's penchant for closed spaces. He said that his main challenge was to make the scenes look different though the protagonist is locked in a single room. To make these differences the lighting was adjusted such that one sees the room in twilight, at night, during the day, in early morning. The camera was made always mobile to counter Ethan's stillness. Slightly mobile things were deliberately kept always around Ethan like a fluttering curtain, a fish bowl near Ethan's head which according to the cinematographer mocked at his stillness all the time.|$|E

2500|$|On July 5, 2008, Tulowitzki {{went back}} on the {{disabled}} list after cutting his right palm in the previous day's 18–17 home win over the Florida Marlins. The injury occurred {{in the bottom of the}} seventh inning when Tulowitzki slammed a maple bat into the ground in frustration. The incident took place after he was taken out of the game in that same inning; however, he noted that the frustration leading up to his injury wasn't due to being taken out, saying, [...] "I was a little bit frustrated, not at the move. If anything, I thought it was the right move. I came in the hallway, grabbed a bat, hit it on the ground and the bat exploded <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> cut open my palm running up to my index finger." [...] The cut required 16 stitches, but no damage was done to any tendons or nerves. Tulowitzki returned to the Rockies lineup, starting at shortstop, on July 21, 2008, in a 16–10 home loss against the Los Angeles Dodgers. He recorded a career-high five hits during the game, as he went 5-for-5 with one RBI. Also since returning from July 21 he has had 6 multi-hit games in his past 8 games (updated through July 29). During the season in games prior to July 21, Tulowitzki only had six multi-hit games (38 games played, prior to July 21). Tulowitzki ended the 2008 season with a [...]263 batting average, 8 home runs, and 46 RBI in 101 games.|$|E
2500|$|After {{receiving}} {{letters from}} Violet Keppel from Paris assuring her she only had feelings for her, Sackville-West had almost fainted {{when she read}} an announcement in a newspaper of Violet's engagement to Major Denys Trefusis. Sackville-West's response was to travel to Paris to see Keppel, taking her to the Hotel Roosevelt where she wrote in her diary: [...] "I treated savagely, I made love to her, I had her, I didn't care, I only wanted to hurt Denys". Keppel had used the engagement {{as a way of}} eliciting the response from Sackville-West she had wanted, and the next day Major Trefusis [...] "almost turned white" [...] when he discovered his fiancee and Sackville-West together in bed, a discovery that came as a great shock as he believed the two were just friends, and had apparently believed that women were incapable of falling in love with one another. That night, Sackville-West had dinner alone at the Ritz while Keppel watched her lovingly from the window in her room at an adjoining hotel while Denys Trefusis laid on the bed crying. Under strong pressure from her mother Alice Keppel, a deeply depressed and suicidal Keppel did marry Major Trefusis, though she made it clear that she did not love him. Sackville-West called the marriage her greatest failure as she made a plan for Keppel to escape with her to avoid marrying Trefusis, but was too cowardly to carry it out, later writing [...] "I sat quite dazed in my room holding my watch <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> watching the hands tick past the hour of Violet's wedding. All the time, I knew, she was expecting a prearranged message from me, which I never sent".|$|E

60|$|Seating {{myself by}} the fire {{in a state of}} mind {{bordering}} on despair, I buried <b>my</b> face <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> endeavoured to collect myself, and consider what, under the circumstances, should be now done.|$|R
6000|$|... "I hardly think that, Laura. You {{leave it}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> I will arrange it all. And now I must get to work, {{for the light}} is so very short on these winter days." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think so," [...] I answered. [...] "Until he gets {{possession}} of that box he will feel himself, {{to a certain}} extent, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> will not be likely to do me an injury." ...|$|R

6000|$|What? Elsie a conspirator? Elsie {{in league}} with Nihilists? So mild and so meek! I could never have {{believed}} it. I took the book <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> read the title, 'Revolution of the Heavenly Bodies.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Keynes's intellect was {{the sharpest}} and clearest that I have ever known. When I argued with him, I felt that I took <b>my</b> life <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> I seldom emerged without feeling {{something}} of a fool.|$|R
6000|$|... "And then in {{an instant}} the key of the riddle was <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> I saw that every third word, {{beginning}} with the first, would give a message which might well drive old Trevor to despair.|$|R

6000|$|Mr. Thompson and Mr. Rogers had arrived, meantime, with satchels and umbrellas, and had silently {{listened to}} the captain's news. Thompson put a half-dollar <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> said softly-- ...|$|E
60|$|I had entirely {{forgotten}} the rifle <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> the revolvers at my belt; {{one does not}} readily synchronize his thoughts with the stone age and the twentieth century simultaneously.|$|E
60|$|Just then, for {{an instant}} my mind refused to work swiftly. It was locked round some sense of awful expectancy. I remembered <b>my</b> camera <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> pointed it where I {{expected}} something wonderful about to happen.|$|R
6000|$|... "They sprung {{things on}} me this morning, things I didn't expect. They rushed me! I'd {{got it all}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> then I was jumped. By Neal! Neal I've given city tips to! Neal! I've helped Neal....|$|R
6000|$|I {{am always}} quite {{straightforward}} when I am {{dealing with a}} client who means business. I pushed aside the litter of papers in front of me, leaned my elbows upon my desk, rested <b>my</b> chin <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> said briefly: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For a {{very good}} reason, Heer Kenzie; because I have a gun <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> you have none, {{and if you do}} not clear the road {{presently}} it may go off." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{felt her}} hand {{trembling}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> {{gave it a}} little encouraging squeeze. [...] "Let us judge him," [...] I suggested, [...] "by what he says and does, on finding us together." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mel. Now, give me {{your paper}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> hold you my glass, while I {{practise}} my postures for the day. [MELANTHA laughs in the glass.] How does that laugh become my face? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Exactly,' he said. 'Comrade Jackson. I think I may {{say that}} you have come to the right man. Comrade Jackson has placed himself <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> I am dealing with his case. A {{somewhat}} tricky business, but I shall see him through.' ...|$|R
60|$|The {{middle of}} a wild and desolate ocean and a voice from Forty-second Street! What manner of {{conjecture}} was this? I clasped <b>my</b> head <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> tried to think. Suddenly a memory came to me: a wild, surging, raging memory.|$|R
60|$|Thank God you did. You can't grudge me the {{happiness}} you gave me. You can't {{take it away}} from me now. I know you love me. I hold the sun <b>and</b> the moon <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> all the stars of heaven.|$|R
60|$|I was {{excessively}} {{anxious to}} get Mr. Micawber away; and replied, with my hat <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> a very red face, I have no doubt, that I was a pupil at Doctor Strong's.|$|E
6000|$|... "If he does, we {{must try}} {{to be ready for}} him," [...] Vane replied. [...] "I sat up most of last night with the {{spritsail}} sheet <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> I'm going to sleep." ...|$|E
60|$|And then of {{a sudden}} I {{realized}} that the bear was gone and that I was quite unharmed. I leaped to my feet, my rifle still clutched <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> looked about for my antagonist.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well,--yes; I think so. I {{shall be}} glad {{just to say}} a word to him. Of course you are <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> I do love you so dearly, Lucy! I could not bear that {{anything}} but good should happen to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure," [...] said Stanton. [...] "I'll {{swear to}} the hat. Chaffed Jernyngham about it one day, {{and he put}} it <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> said there wasn't another of the kind in the country. A man from Hong Kong gave it to him." ...|$|R
60|$|His dragoons {{closed in}} upon me, and I--I was driven mad, as I {{thought that the}} game had been <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> that I ought at that moment to be a free man. I held the cards {{up in front of}} the General.|$|R
