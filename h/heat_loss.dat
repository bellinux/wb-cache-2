It is situated between the Šoštanj Thermal Power Plant (TEŠ) and the Central Energy Station (CES) Velenje {{as part of the}} district heating system in the Šaleška Valley. It was renovated because major <b>heat</b> <b>losses</b> were identified. A numerical analysis and a comparison between the temperature fields of the pipe 2 ̆ 7 s insulation before and after the renovation was performed to discover the main causes for the high <b>heat</b> <b>losses</b> before renovation. An integral measuring method for determining the <b>heat</b> <b>losses</b> was adapted and used to determine the pipeline 2 ̆ 7 s <b>heat</b> <b>losses</b> after the renovation. Taking into consideration the real operating parameters, the annual energy savings and the consequent operational cost reduction, due to the lower <b>heat</b> <b>losses,</b> resulting from the pipeline renovations, are presented. The calculation is made with measured heat-loss coefficients and is therefore based on the real state of the pipeline.

5|$|The mallard {{is a rare}} {{example of}} both Allen's Rule and Bergmann's Rule in birds. Bergmann's Rule, which states that polar forms tend to be larger than related ones from warmer climates, has {{numerous}} examples in birds, as in case of the Greenland mallard which {{is larger than the}} mallards further south. Allen's Rule says that appendages like ears tend to be smaller in polar forms to minimise <b>heat</b> <b>loss,</b> and larger in tropical and desert equivalents to facilitate heat diffusion, and that the polar taxa are stockier overall. Examples of this rule in birds are rare as they lack external ears, but the bill of ducks is supplied with a few blood vessels to prevent <b>heat</b> <b>loss,</b> and, as in the Greenland mallard, the bill is smaller than that of birds farther south, illustrating the rule.|$|E

5|$|Earth's {{internal}} heat is {{thermal energy}} generated from radioactive decay and continual <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> from Earth's formation. Temperatures at the core–mantle boundary may reach over 4000°C (7,200°F).

40|$|From 2016 "A" energy {{efficiency}} class buildings should be designed and built in Lithuania, as their energy consumptions are considerably less comparing with {{the ones that were}} built before. In order to meet high requirements of "A" {{energy efficiency}} class buildings should be used new energy efficient structural and insulating solutions should be made. In order to evaluate overall <b>heat</b> <b>losses</b> in these joints more exactly it is required to calculate values of heat transmission coefficients of linear thermal bridges in "A" energy class buildings. The project of semi-detached building was chosen in order to analyse influence of linear thermal bridges for building's energy consumption as {{there are all kinds of}} linear thermal bridges which values must be calculated. Buildings energy efficiency designing program, which based on EN ISO 13790, was used to calculate building's <b>heat</b> <b>losses.</b> <b>Heat</b> transmission coefficients of linear thermal bridges were calculated using program THERM. Two variations were analysed: building's energy consumptions are close to the lowest point of A class requirements when building's envelopes and joints of units in joint places are the same as they are in currently built houses; and effective energy solutions of building's joints. The results of analysis showed that requirements of "A" class can be reached using ordinary solutions for building's envelopes and joint units but if linear thermal bridges are designed like that, it makes 16 % <b>heat</b> <b>losses</b> through envelopes, and it is similar to <b>heat</b> <b>losses</b> through building's walls (17 %), furthermore, it is about 1. 5 times bigger than <b>heat</b> <b>losses</b> through roof (10 %) or floors (10 %). Specific <b>heat</b> <b>losses</b> of thermal bridges make 7. 80 kWh/m² per year. The biggest overall <b>heat</b> <b>losses</b> are through walls and windows joint thermal bridges (specific <b>heat</b> <b>losses</b> make 13. 55 W/K). Another significant part of <b>heat</b> <b>losses</b> comes from walls and floor joints (specific <b>heat</b> <b>losses</b> make 11. 88 W/K). After solutions of buildings with energy effective building's envelopes and units joints were analysed it can be stated that overall <b>heat</b> <b>losses</b> decreased about 10 kWh/m² per year, it is 20 %. <b>Heat</b> <b>losses</b> through thermal bridges make only 3 % of overall <b>heat</b> <b>losses</b> through envelopes, it is 122 kWh/m² per year. According to results of the analyse general specifications were made for designing building envelopes of "A" energy efficient class:- The building of "A" class can be designed using ordinary solutions of linear thermal bridges, bigger <b>heat</b> <b>losses</b> through thermal bridges can be covered by increasing thickness of thermal insulating layers and using windows of better thermal behaviour but as a result the costs of building house increase too. - When effective solutions of linear thermal bridges are used, the same energy efficiency of the building can be reached using less thermal insulating layers, windows and doors of less thermal behaviour if the building of better energy characteristics is designed...|$|R

They use smell for signalling to each other (either to warn off rivals or detect mates) and for finding food.

5|$|Without seismic data or {{knowledge}} of its moment of inertia, little direct {{information is available}} about the internal structure and geochemistry of Venus. The similarity in size and density between Venus and Earth suggests they share a similar internal structure: a core, mantle, and crust. Like that of Earth, the Venusian core is at least partially liquid because the two planets have been cooling {{at about the same}} rate. The slightly smaller size of Venus means pressures are 24% lower in its deep interior than Earth's. The principal difference between the two planets is the lack of evidence for plate tectonics on Venus, possibly because its crust is too strong to subduct without water to make it less viscous. This results in reduced <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> from the planet, preventing it from cooling and providing a likely explanation for its lack of an internally generated magnetic field.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs {{have low}} basal {{metabolic}} rates (BMR), which helps them to conserve energy {{during the dry}} season, when water and food are scarce. They can optimize their energy use by lowering their metabolic rate to 20% below the values predicted for mammals of similar body mass. The red-tailed sportive lemur (Lepilemur ruficaudatus), for instance, reportedly {{has one of the}} lowest metabolic rates among mammals. Its low metabolic rate may be linked to its generally folivorous diet and relatively small body mass. Lemurs exhibit behavioral adaptations to complement this trait, including sunning behaviors, hunched sitting, group huddling, and nest sharing, in order to reduce <b>heat</b> <b>loss</b> and conserve energy. Dwarf lemurs and mouse lemurs exhibit seasonal cycles of dormancy to conserve energy. Before dry season, they will accumulate fat in white adipose tissue located {{at the base of the}} tail and hind legs, doubling their weight. At the end of the dry season, their body mass may fall to half of what it was prior to the dry season. Lemurs that do not experience states of dormancy are also able to shut down aspects of their metabolism for energy conservation.|$|E
