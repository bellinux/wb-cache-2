2500|$|Early 1960 models, {{particularly}} the V200 high-trim cars, featured extensive brightwork and ornamentation. An [...] chrome spear atop each front fender, an <b>inner</b> <b>reveal</b> {{ring on the}} deck lid's spare tire stamping, a [...] "V200" [...] nameplate on the dashboard, and stainless steel windshield and backlight reveal moldings, which were deleted from production, replaced with less costly flexible mylar-faced plastic locking strips—in approximately January, 1960. Early and late V200s had a continuous stainless steel molding following the tailfin crease as it swept {{down in front of}} the rear wheel, then continuing forward along the lower break line in both doors and the front fender. The radiator grille was brite-dipped stamped aluminum, and a central grille badge doubled as the hood release. Script [...] "Valiant" [...] callouts were placed in the center of the deck lid's spare-tire stamping and on each front fender.|$|E

Zeitgeist's <b>inner</b> thoughts <b>reveal</b> he actually hates the public who adores him and has a seeming dissatisfaction with his high profile mutant life. Battering Ram talks to him once again, then an attack helicopter opens fire.|$|R
50|$|The chancel is {{relatively}} small at 15’ x 13’, but it is sufficiently large for all its functions and to provide an open view of the altar or holy table to the congregation. It is five steps above the nave. The timber roof springs from a gallery of six blank arches on corbels to either side. The windows have deep <b>inner</b> <b>reveals,</b> as does the sedilia. There are four lancets {{to the south and}} two to the north. The organ loft and vestry is to {{the north side of the}} chancel. The vestry is connected directly to the pulpit through a door a pulpit level and the organ located through an arch. The sanctuary measures 10’ x 13. The chancel and sanctuary have red and yellow quarry tiled floors with stone borders. The east window has three lancets and a trefoil with decorative stained glass.|$|R
5000|$|Jason Todd reappeared in the [...] "Battle for the Cowl" [...] series. Dressed in {{a version}} of a Batman costume, Todd is also living/operating out of an {{abandoned}} Gotham subway system. His <b>inner</b> monologue <b>reveals</b> that he {{had always wanted to}} eventually replace Batman, and thinks it was a bad idea for Batman to become a public figure, rather than an urban legend.|$|R

Zn and Bi (50 keV) have been implanted in Si at doses of 5 x 10 (16) cm(- 2) and 10 (16) cm(- 2), respectively. In spite of the different diffusivities of these species in Si, their low solubility resulted in precipitation of nano-sized metallic inclusions whose <b>inner</b> structures <b>revealed</b> a synthesis of superlattices, composed of the host Si matrix and the implanted species...|$|R

5000|$|The Wedding Night {{was filmed}} at Samuel Goldwyn Studios in West Hollywood, California from early November to early December 1934. The film was {{originally}} titled Broken Soil. When director King Vidor began filming scenes with Cooper, he was initially disappointed and the actor's apparent [...] "mumbling and stumbling" [...] style. When he viewed footage from that first day, however, the director {{was surprised to}} see [...] "a performance that overflowed with charm and personality ... a highly complex and fascinating <b>inner</b> personality <b>revealed</b> itself on the projection room screen".|$|R
40|$|Dodecamerization and {{insertion}} {{of the outer}} membrane secretin PulD is entirely determined by the C-terminal half of the polypeptide (PulD-CS). In the absence of its cognate chaperone PulS, PulD-CS and PulD mislocalize to the inner membrane, from which they are extractable with detergents but not urea. Electron microscopy of PulD-CS purified from the <b>inner</b> membrane <b>revealed</b> apparently normal dodecameric complexes. Electron microscopy of PulD-CS and PulD in <b>inner</b> membrane vesicles <b>revealed</b> inserted secretin complexes. Mislocalization of PulD or PulD-CS to this membrane induces the phage shock response, probably {{as a result of}} a decreased membrane electrochemical potential. Production of PulD in the absence of the phage shock response protein PspA and PulS caused a substantial drop in membrane potential and was lethal. Thus, PulD-CS and PulD assemble in the inner membrane if they do not associate with PulS. We propose that PulS prevents premature multimerization of PulD and accompanies it through the periplasm to the outer membrane. PulD is the first bacterial outer membrane protein with demonstrated ability to insert efficiently into the inner membrane...|$|R
40|$|What is it {{that makes}} a mental state conscious? Recent {{commentators}} have proposed that for Kant, consciousness results from differentiation: A mental state is conscious insofar as it is distinguished, by means of our conceptual capacities, from other states and/or things. I argue instead that Kant’s conception of state consciousness is sensory: A mental state is conscious insofar as it is accompanied by an inner sensation. Interpreting state consciousness as <b>inner</b> sensation <b>reveals</b> an underappreciated influence of Crusius on Kant’s view, solves some long-standing puzzles concerning Kant’s difficult doctrine of self-affection, and sheds light on his theory of inner experience...|$|R

40|$|A {{qualitative}} study is performed on plasma transport modelling in the <b>inner</b> magnetosphere, <b>revealing</b> {{the significance of}} a model use choice and its parameterization. First, we examine particle transport using comparative analysis of both magnetic and electric field models. This work reveals that the electric field {{plays an important role}} in understanding particle dynamics and the models lead to various results in terms of plasma source, energy and particle trajectory. We then concentrate particularly on proton loss assessment considering the charge exchange phenomenon. For that, models are needed to provide a neutral hydrogen density estimation. So, exospheric models were tested in light of the Dynamics Explorer 1 measurements analysed by Rairden...|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} the Earth's core {{might seem to be}} as {{academic}} as the study of a black hole or a pulsar. If {{it were not for the}} core, however, compasses would not work, we wouldn't know about plate tectonics and we probably wouldn't even have evolved to worry about such things. The core is a sloshing ball of molten metal, half the radius of the Earth, in which is suspended a sphere of solid iron. It is the source of the magnetic field which shields us from harmful emissions from outer space. The liquid outer core and solid <b>inner</b> core <b>reveal</b> their secrets through their effects on seismic waves, the magnetic field and the motions of the Earth...|$|R

The artist turned to the theme of landscape and created a range of paintings in which she combined painting and collage with Japanese paper on canvas. In these paintings <b>revealing</b> <b>inner</b> experience and scenic associations, Jurtzek created a new relation between color, light and space, exceeding the boundaries of informal painting.|$|R
40|$|Research Report {{submitted}} in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} of the Degree of BSc Honours in ArchaeologyWith the purpose of confirming the “kraal index” created by Sadr and Rodier (2012), a group of stone-walled structures in the Suikerbosrand Nature Reserve were selected for study. Confirming this involved testing for livestock presence in the inner enclosures of Group III stone-walled complexes. Phosphate testing of the <b>inner</b> enclosures <b>revealed</b> the absence of evidence showing the presence of livestock occupation. This may be because of the phosphate testing method used. It may also be because of different culture factors involving the recycling of dung as fuel and kraal maintenance. The probability of each hypothesis is weighed up against the supporting data captured by the phosphate analyses...|$|R
50|$|Bibracte was {{protected}} by strong Murus Gallicus style battlements, which excavations {{have been able to}} reconstruct. The city had a progression of two different surrounding walls and at least five restorations of the <b>inner</b> surrounding wall, <b>revealed,</b> among other things, by the study of the Rebout gate. Surprisingly, the inner encircling wall was constructed after the outer wall. The city, therefore, shrank in area from 200 to 135 hectares (494 to 334 acres).|$|R

50|$|The {{badly damaged}} roofs were redone within 2 to 4 months, as a {{priority}} concern. Government initially granted 2 million Sri Lankan rupees for the restoration, following the attack. Public donations to the cause exceeded 100 million rupees, which was three {{times higher than the}} estimated cost. A number of local craftsmen and stone carvers were employed. This helped revival of the near-extinct profession of stone carving in Sri Lanka, which was confined to a few rural families at that time. In the end, all damaged sculptures were made new, and damaged paintings on lime plaster were reassembled and reintegrated with the existing pieces. Interestingly, damage to the <b>inner</b> chambers <b>revealed</b> previously unknown paintings belonging to the Kirti Sri Rajasinha era. The restoration process was completed by August 1999.|$|R

40|$|AbstractInner {{classes in}} {{object-oriented}} languages {{play a role}} similar to nested function definitions in functional languages, allowing an object to export other objects that have direct access to its own methods and instance variables. However, the similarity is deceptive: {{a close look at}} <b>inner</b> classes <b>reveals</b> significant subtleties arising from their interactions with inheritance. The goal of this work is a precise understanding of the essential features of inner classes; our object of study is a fragment of Java with inner classes and inheritance (and almost nothing else). We begin by giving a direct reduction semantics for this language. We then give an alternative semantics by translation into a yet smaller language with only top-level classes, closely following Java's Inner Classes Specification. We prove that the two semantics coincide, in the sense that translation commutes with reduction, and that both are type-safe...|$|R
