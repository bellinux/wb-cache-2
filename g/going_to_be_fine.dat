2500|$|After {{recording}} a cover version of Foy Vance's [...] "Make It Rain" [...] for [...] Sons of Anarchy, Sheeran was cast by creator Kurt Sutter to play Sir Cormac {{in the medieval}} drama The Bastard Executioner on FX. He said of his role [...] "It’s gruesome and it’s <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fine</b> because my friend wrote it...

Whereas that was about me saying, 'I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fine</b> without you', this is me on my knees really." [...] She discussed further the inspiration of the song: [...] "I can imagine being about 40 and looking for him again, only to turn up and find that he's settled with a beautiful wife and beautiful kids and he's completely happy... and I'm still on my own. The song's about that and I'm scared {{at the thought of}} that." ...|$|E

2500|$|Following the game, Texas {{revealed}} that X-Rays, {{taken during the}} game, of McCoy's shoulder were negative. [...] His injury {{was described as a}} pinched nerve or stinger. [...] UT trainer Kenny Boyd explained why McCoy did not re-enter the game: [...] "After the injury, Colt experienced shoulder weakness and neck pain," [...] Boyd said. [...] "When evaluating injuries, we look for return of normal strength and a reduction of pain before putting a player back into the game. Colt wasn’t released to play because his symptoms, including strength, did not improve." [...] His mother, Debra McCoy, confirmed the nature of the injury and said that the extra time off prior to the game against Texas A should give Colt a chance to recover. Colt McCoy said in a statement, [...] "I'm really disappointed I wasn't able to be in there helping my teammates, but I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fine.</b> The off week couldn't come at a better time.

6000|$|At first all {{was pure}} and delicious. In after times when pain made him gloomily measure {{the length of}} the night, and when fever {{prevented}} him from having a moment of sleep, he used to try to still his suffering by recollection of the days that he had passed in the woods of Montmorency, with his dog, the birds, the deer, for his companions. [...] "As I got up with the sun to watch his rising from my garden, if I saw the day was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fine,</b> my first wish was that neither letters nor visits might come to disturb its charm. After having given the morning to divers tasks which I fulfilled with all the more pleasure that I could put them off to another time if I chose, I hastened to eat my dinner, so as to escape from the importunate and make myself a longer afternoon. Before one o'clock, even on days of fiercest heat, I used to start in the blaze of the sun, along with my faithful Achates, hurrying my steps lest some one should lay hold of me before I could get away. But when I had once passed a certain corner, with what beating of the heart, with what radiant joy, did I begin to breathe freely, as I felt myself safe and my own master {{for the rest of the}} day! Then with easier pace I went in search of some wild and desert spot in the forest, where there was nothing to show the hand of man, or to speak of servitude and domination; some refuge where I could fancy myself its discoverer, and where no inopportune third person came to interfere between nature and me. She seemed to spread out before my eyes a magnificence that was always new. The gold of the broom and the purple of the heather struck my eyes with a glorious splendour that went to my very heart; the majesty of the trees that covered me with their shadow, the delicacy of the shrubs that surrounded me, the astonishing variety of grasses and flowers that I trod under foot, kept my mind in a continual alternation of attention and delight.... My imagination did not leave the earth thus superbly arrayed without inhabitants. I formed a charming society, of which I did not feel myself unworthy; I made a golden age to please my own fancy, and filling up these fair days with all those scenes of my life that had left sweet memories behind, and all that my heart could yet desire or hope in scenes to come, I waxed tender even to shedding tears over the true pleasures of humanity, pleasures so delicious, so pure, and henceforth so far from the reach of men. Ah, if in such moments any ideas of Paris, of the age, of my little aureole as author, came to trouble my dreams, with what disdain did I drive them out, to deliver myself without distraction to the exquisite sentiments of which I was so full. Yet in the midst of it all, the nothingness of my chimeras sometimes broke sadly upon my mind. Even if every dream had suddenly been transformed into reality, it would not have been enough; I should have dreamed, imagined, yearned still." [...] Alas, this deep insatiableness of sense, the dreary vacuity of soul that follows fulness of animal delight, the restless exactingness of undirected imagination, was never recognised by Rousseau distinctly enough to modify either his conduct or his theory of life. He filled up the void for a short space by that sovereign aspiration, which changed the dead bones of old theology into the living figure of a new faith. [...] "From the surface of the earth I raised my ideas to all the existences in nature, to the universal system of things, to the incomprehensible Being who embraces all. Then with mind lost in that immensity, I did not think, I did not reason, I did not philosophise; with a sort of pleasure I felt overwhelmed by the weight of the universe, I surrendered myself to the ravishing confusion of these vast ideas. I loved to lose myself in imagination in immeasurable space; within the limits of real existences my heart was too tightly compressed; in the universe I was stifled; I would fain have launched myself into the infinite. I believe that if I had unveiled all the mysteries of nature, I should have found myself in a less delicious situation than that bewildering ecstasy to which my mind so unreservedly delivered itself, and which sometimes transported me until I cried out, 'O mighty Being! O mighty Being!' without power of any other word or thought."[257] ...|$|E

5000|$|Judge Henry Clay McDowell was {{presiding}} and, after a strenuous {{trial of}} several days, directed a verdict {{in favor of}} the defendant. The lawyer representing the plaintiff was Dan Trigg, a giant of the bar and the leading lawyer in Western Virginia.

[...] "Damn a federal judge anyhow," [...] Mr. Trigg exclaimed, being audible to all. Judge McDowell, of course, heard the remark, but remained stooped over and left the courtroom by a door just behind the judge's chair so that no one knew he was in the room. He later summoned all the other lawyers in the courtroom to his chambers and said that he had heard Mr. Trigg's remark. He asked the lawyers if anyone in the room knew that he had heard it. When the lawyers advised him that no one had, he stated the rule that lawyers had a constitutional right to cuss the judge and, since Mr. Trigg didn't know he had been heard, he <b>was</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fined.</b>|$|R

6000|$|Good God! my Lords, {{if you are}} not appalled {{with the}} violent {{injustice}} of arbitrary proceedings, you must feel something humiliating at the gross ignorance of men who are in this manner playing with the rights of mankind. This man confounds a fine upon succession with a fine of penalty. He takes advantage of a defect in the technical language of our law, which, I <b>am</b> sorry <b>to</b> say, <b>is</b> not, in many parts, as correct in its distinctions and as wise in its provisions as the Mahometan law. We use the word fine in three senses: first, as a punishment and penalty; secondly, as a formal means of cutting off by one form the ties of another form, which we call levying a fine; and, thirdly, we use the word to signify a sum of money payable upon renewal of a lease or copyhold. The word has in each case a totally different sense; but such is the stupidity and barbarism of the prisoner, that he confounds these senses, and tells you Sujah Dowlah took twenty-five lacs as a fine from Cheyt Sing for the renewal of his zemindary, and therefore, as a punishment for his offences, he shall take fifty. Suppose any one of your Lordships, or of us, <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fined</b> for assault and battery, or for anything else, and it should be said, [...] "You paid such a fine for a bishop's lease, you paid such a fine on the purchase of an estate, and therefore, now that you <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fined</b> for a punishment, we will take the measure of the fine, not from the nature and quality of your offence, not from the law upon the subject, or from your ability to pay, but the amount of a fine you paid some years ago for an estate shall be the measure of your punishment." [...] My Lords, what should we say of such brutish ignorance, and such shocking confusion of ideas? ...|$|R
