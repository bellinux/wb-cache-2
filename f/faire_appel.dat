Our adversaries had brought the accusation of luxury against the American government, inasmuch as it was said to furnish both a town and a country palace for the President--a degree of magnificence little suspected in France. This point was not treated {{as a matter of}} any importance by us, though General Lafayette had slightly and playfully alluded to it, once or twice. The words of Mr. Harris shall speak for themselves: [...] "Le Général Lafayette paraît surtout avoir été frappé de l'erreur dans laquelle est tombé l'auteur de la Revue, à l'égard de la belle maison de campagne dont il a doté la présidence; et c'est peut-être là ce qui l'a porté à <b>faire</b> <b>appel</b> à M. le Général Bernard et à M.

40|$|Due to the {{continuously}} {{scaling down}} of CMOS technology, system-on-chips (SoCs) reliability becomes important in sub- 90 nm CMOS node. Integrated circuits and systems applied to aerospace, avionic, vehicle transport and biomedicine are highly sensitive to reliability {{problems such as}} ageing mechanisms and parametric process variations. Novel SoCs with new materials and architectures of high complexity further aggravate reliability as a critical aspect of process integration. For instance, random and systematic defects as well as parametric process variations have a large influence on quality and yield of the manufactured ICs, right after production. During ICs usage time, time-dependent ageing mechanisms such as negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) and hot carrier injection (HCI) can significantly degrade ICs performance.

In the present paper, I'll first reflect upon the origins of such a situation, {{and then try to}} show how, {{during the second half of}} the eighteenth century, Japanese intellectuals became to share a common view of the world and of the society. I'll take the example of Kaiho Seiryo to illustrate this thesis. In the present paper, I'll focus more on Kaiho's stance as an intellectual and on his view of learning than the content of Kaiho's political thought. For Kaiho Seiryo, Chinese Classics as well as Japanese scholarship were not to be worshipped. They just provided examples and ideas which could inspire contemporary politics. Self judgment was primary and every scholar had to dedicate himself to finding answers to the concrete problems of his time and to express them using a language easily understandable for everyone. Lastly, I'll try to explore the political and intellectual reasons why such a change happened at the turn of the 19 th century.

40|$|Cet article examine la réglementation adoptée par cinq administrations publiques en Amérique du Nord qui ont choisi de <b>faire</b> <b>appel</b> à la science de l’ergonomie comme outil réglementaire de prévention des {{troubles}} musculo-squelettiques (TMS). Aux États-Unis, seul le règlement de la Californie, d’une portée fort limitée, a pu survivre aux pressions politiques qui ont mené à l’abrogation des règlements de l’État fédéral américain (OSHA) et de l’État de Washington. Au Canada, la Colombie-Britannique et la Saskatchewan appliquent de tels règlements, mais contrairement aux instruments américains abrogés, ceux du Canada misent plutôt sur le processus de prise {{en charge}} que sur des normes spécifiques qui quantifient les gestes à risque et déterminent de façon stricte les actions attendues de l’employeur. La description du contexte d’adoption et du contenu des règlements est ensuite suivie d’une comparaison sommaire de cette réglementation avec le droit québécois régissant la prévention des TMS. This article examines five ergonomic standards adopted by regulatory agencies in North America {{for the purpose}} of preventing musculo-skeletal disorders (MSDs), one of the most costly categories of injury throughout North America. Since 1988, three regulatory agencies in the United States and two in Canada have chosen to implement “ergonomic standards”, relying on knowledge produced by the science of ergonomy to prevent injury associated with various risk factors known to contribute to MSDs. Saskatchewan was the first to regulate the prevention of MSDs in 1988, followed by California (1997), British Columbia (1998), Washington State (2000) and OSHA (2001). While the first three regulations are still in force, political pressure by business lobbies led to the repeal of both the OSHA regulation, repealed shortly after the Bush cabinet came to power, only weeks after its adoption, and the Washington State regulation, repealed {{as a result of a}} referendum in late 2003. The article first situates ergonomic standards in the historical context of occupational health and safety regulation. Gunningham and Johnstone (Regulating Workplace Safety: Systems and Sanctions, Oxford University Press, 1999), in a historical overview of regulatory strategies in occupational health and safety, show that, in many Anglo-Saxon jurisdictions, the traditional approach of command and control regulation, based on a multitude of technical specifications, has evolved into a performance based approach, relying on general duty clauses and codes of practice while placing less reliance on technical specifications. The third and most recent regulatory approach, relying on process regulation and occupational health and safety management systems, has developed considerably in Europe but has not yet taken hold in most North American jurisdictions. The historical overview allows us to consider why the various ergonomic standards studied have led to so much controversy, particularly in the United States, as tensions arose as those who preferred stringent regulation of ergonomic hazards met with very strong resistance from business interests, many of whom were determined to prevent any form of regulation relying on ergonomy. The nature and outcomes of the political confrontation in the different jurisdictions are then examined. The article then describes the regulatory framework of each of the five standards studied. The most timid is that of California, targeting only the prevention of “repetitive motion injuries”, constraining the employer only after at least two workers are injured in the same job, and presuming employer response to be adequate. All the other regulations are broader in scope, aiming to prevent all forms of musculo-skeletal disorders, ensuring that all employers undertake some form of risk assessment and providing, in different ways, specific tools to facilitate detection of hazardous working conditions. OSHA and Washington State regulations rely on a quantitative approach, specifying in detail different forms of ergonomic risks. The Canadian regulations are more process based, ensuring that employers do a risk assessment and relying on training and the provision of information to workers and unions without prescribing a quantified standard, but only the procedures to be followed. Tables show the different steps to be followed under each regulation (Table 1) and the different risk factors to be examined (Table 2). An examination of the role reserved for different actors in the prevention process (Table 3) shows that ergonomists themselves are not specifically named in any of the regulations. The designation of these standards as “ergonomic” is based on their reliance on knowledge gleaned from the study of ergonomy, yet the fact that these North American regulations only look to prevent MSDs shows that many other teachings of ergonomy are completely overlooked. After describing the five regulatory instruments that rely explicitly on ergonomy, the article examines the situation in Quebec. The Occupational health and safety regulation contains a few specific obligations that have existed for years, including the obligation to provide chairs, when feasible, and a few conditions applicable to manual handling and the placement of tools. The Quebec inspectorate of the Commission de la santé et de la sécurité du travail (CSST) also relies on the general duty clause to implement change in the workplace with regards to ergonomy. It is unclear whether this approach has met with success, and a few administrative tribunal judgments lead us to believe that an ergonomic standard would ensure a more flexible approach that would encourage employers, unions and workers to act promptly to implement strategies designed to prevent MSDs. An ergonomic standard would also facilitate the work of inspectors while allowing them to encourage the employer to undertake risk assessments and prevention programmes. In conclusion, a number of issues are raised concerning the appropriate regulatory approach that will ensure the prevention of MSDs and also introduce an ergonomic approach to occupational health and safety prevention strategies. Critics suggest that an approach based only on specifications will never adequately prevent MSDs, as the variability of individual morphology escapes quantification. Others suggest that without specifications, enforcement becomes impracticable. The American experience, as compared to the Canadian, leads us to conclude that a more harmonious regulatory process is necessary to guarantee the efficacy, and the survival of ergonomic standards.

40|$|Dans l'entreprise moderne s'établissent forcément certaines {{relations}} entre l'entreprise elle-même et ses membres d'une part et {{le public}} d'autre part. Elles sont communément appelées « Public Relations » et « Human Relations ». Dans cet article l'auteur explique les origines et le développement des unes et des autres. A cause des éléments psychologiques sur lesquels elles reposent, ces relations ont de nombreuses sphères d'interaction et sont appelées à se compléter. Le travailleur étant un être humain doué d'intelligence mérite à juste titre d'être commandé dans l'industrie non par crainte mais par persuasion. Cette persuasion est réalisable au moyen de l'information « descendante » et de l'information « ascendante ». Pour mettre en application ces méthodes renouvelées, il faut <b>faire</b> <b>appel</b> aux sciences sociales qui ont un rôle capital à jouer dans ce domaine. In modem business, certain relations become necessarily established between the enterprise itself {{and all its}} members, on one hand, and the public, on the other hand. These are known as "Public Relations" and "Human Relations". Based on psychological factors, they have many spheres of interaction and are even called on to complete each other. It is interesting to study them successively, and to attempt to form a synthesis. "Public Relations"The beginning of "Public Relations" in the United States {{is due to the}} fact that the American enterprises were threatened in their very existence by what was essentially a crisis of progress. This threat consisted of a very severe antitrust legislation which originated and can be explained in the economic changes which took place in the United States right after the War of Secession. From these economic changes, there arose a powerful movement towards the forming of trusts, mergers and large enterprises which tended necessarily toward a scattering of personal resources and to certain abuses. An opposition movement arose, which led to an extension of Federal powers over commerce and industry. The Sherman Act, voted in 1890, forbids all forms of collusion between enterprises which might affect free trading or lessen competition. The application of the Act is carried out by a specialized agent, the Federal Trade Commission. Faced with such a system, the large American enterprises were obliged to react, to find means of defence. As these anti-trust laws were based on public opinion, it was necessary to reach the public and give it complete and understandable information. Wherever, "Public Relations" programmes have been well carried out, the people's verdict has been favourable to the enterprises. This is easily explained, as by educating the public, they appealed to a very powerful sentiment in mankind: the pride that each individual feels when he has an intimate knowledge of someone or of an organization which has a certain authority. This is what "Public Relations" try to realize, to give each one the feeling that he is taking part in the life of the enterprise. In destroying the divisions which exist inside the enterprise by creating an exchange of ideas, the "Public Relations" increased production. By making the enterprise a name known and liked, they attracted the loyalty of buyers. By continually informing the shareholders they made of them a moral force which supported the enterprise's policy in a positive manner. Finally, by discussing openly all the problems of the enterprise, they reduced greatly the bitter character of certain social conflicts. With this conception, the American industrial leaders learned by the practice of "Public Relations" that virtue and interest go together, that moral values remain the basis of all the industrial activity. The techniques used to influence those outside depend on the information 1 methods available in each country. On the other hand, the techniques used to influence the personnel of the enterprise are fairly uniform and depend especially on the size of the enterprise. The large enterprise may find that the best ways of reaching the personnel are the Company newspaper, the booklet for new employees, information bulletins, films and conference cycles. Small enterprises have the advantage of being able to use the most efficient method: this is regular meetings where the workers and the management meet and talk over in a friendly way, as fellow-workers, everything concerning the life, the reverses and the success of the enterprise. The aim must always remain the same: fight anonymity which makes the enterprise remain a great unknown for its personnel; make the ties personal which bind the worker to the enterprise. In addition to appealing to the intelligence of the employees, we must also appeal to the workers feelings by means of "Human Relations". "Human Relation"The movement of human relations is at the same time, the result of the Scientific Organization of Labour movement and a reaction against it. The purely mechanical system perfected by F. W. Taylor, helps and at the same time, forces the worker to improve his efficiency. This too rational research' caused excesses and gave rise to two diseases up to this time unknown: industrial fatigue and monotony. Gradually a truth that had been long forgotten began to be noticed: that there is a close relationship between the benefits a man receives and his state of mind, between efficiency and psychology. The founder of the movement of "Human Relations" within Industry or of sociology applied to the enterprise is Elton Mayo, professor of the Harvard Business School. The first outline of the sociology of an enterprise came from a scientific study which has remained unequalled: what is called in t h e United States, the Western Electric Company experiment. The Company wished to isolate and measure the influence of different physical factors on the efficiency of the industrial worker. Average workers were picked out and put to work by separate, groups under different experimental conditions. Curiously, the experimental' conditions could be changed as much as was wanted and yet efficiency continued to improve. The results of the research work were confusing because beforehand it seemed as though there existed a relationship between lighting conditions and the output of the workers. Elton Mayo found the crux or the problem or the factor of which nobody had thought. During the research work, the whole relationship between persons and between groups of workers involved in the experiments had been fundamentally changed: their relations with their superiors, their relations between themselves, their relations with the other workers of the factory. In other words, during the experiment, the researchers had brought a revolutionary change to the usual methods of management. This change was so important that besides this, all the other physical changes remained without consequence and Elton Mayo decided to extend his experiment which over a period of twelve years eventually covered over 20, 000 workers representing many different nationalities and carrying out a very great variety of tasks. From this research is brought out the fundamental conclusion that among the motives that guide the worker in his task, the material motive is not the most important one. The efficiency of the worker depends in the final analysis on the satisfaction he feels in his relations with other men. The needs that he tries to satisfy most stubbornly are above all moral and psychological needs. Numerous inquiries carried on in other enterprises only confirmed the value of these findings. The "Human Relations" movement tries first of all to determine what needs the workers are trying to satisfy in their work. There are first of all individual needs and then social needs. In fact, the workers of the enterprise form, whether we like it or not, a live group and the relations of each individual to the group as well as the morale of the groups form the atmosphere in which work is carried on. The studies of Elton Mayo and George Lombard show that absenteeism and labour turnover in the large aeroplane factories in the United States were affected by the existence of these "informal" groups formed by the workers themselves in the factories; inside these groups are developed practices, traditions, and unwritten social code, a hierarchy of persons and values. The problem of changes is then not studied only in technical terms but also in taking into account their effects on the constitution and routine of the groups. If circumstances oblige the management to allow the technical point of view to take precedence, they will, nevertheless, take care to explain it to the workers in plausible terms and attempt to secure their cooperation. It is especially under the impetus of the last war, and the increase of unionism in the United States, that the movement of "Human Relations" was so widely extended. This movement of "Human Relations" re-appraises in psychological and sociological terms the entirety of working conditions. It tries to assure a better psychological formation of the framework of the enterprise. In each one of its stages, it is the result of a harmonious cooperation between industry and university and furnishes business men methods with which to carry out better their function of management. This is why the exercise of modern industrial management must be done at the same time by 'Public Relations" and "Human Relations". If we only use "Public Relations" we risk missing the crux of the problems which arise inside our enterprises and only look for superficial solutions. If we only use "Human Relations" we are hiding the light under the bushel and we fail in our greater duty to society. To "Public Relations", we must give emphasis, we must enrich them by the teachings of "Human Relations". Together, they have great value because they put the social problem in a framework in which it must be solved — inside the enterprise itself. We must substitute for management by tradition, management by persuasion. The first indispensable condition in applying this new conception of the function of the manager consists in creating inside the enterprise a system of communication. Each worker must know clearly and continually what he is doing, what place he occupies in the working of the factory and what place the factory occupies in the life of the community. This point is extremely important. The communication of certain results is desirable but not sufficient in itself, it is necessary at the same time to furnish a basis which permits them to be appreciated. This basis is furnished by the method which consists of comparing present results with past results, the results of the enterprise to those of the industry as a whole. The workers must understand in a general way the policies followed by the enterprise. Finally, the workers must know their managers. This is "downward" information, but management by persuasion supposes also that a current of communication exists from the bottom to the top in such a way that management realizes what the employees think and feel. "Public Relations" try hard to bring together management and workers in the enterprise by making the enterprise a being which the workers know intimately and in giving the simplest tasks a wider social sense. "Human Relations" try to bring management and workers together by making communications a bond running in both directions and bringing men together by their feelings as much as by their intelligence. It is clear that in this renewal of our methods of management the social sciences are called upon to play an important role. It is necessary for the social sciences to be brought out in the light of day and for this reason industry and the universities must cooperate...|$|E
