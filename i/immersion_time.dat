5000|$|There {{are various}} {{technical}} aspects of virtual reality that can induce sickness, such as mismatched motion, field of view, motion parallax, and viewing angle. [...] Additionally, {{the amount of time}} spent in virtual reality can increase the presence of symptoms. Mismatched motion can be defined as a discrepancy between the motion of the simulation and the motion that the user expects. [...] It is possible to induce motion sickness in virtual reality when the frequencies of mismatched motion are similar to those for motion sickness in reality, such as seasickness. [...] These frequencies can be experimentally manipulated, but also have the propensity to arise from system errors.Generally, increasing the field of view increases incidence of simulator sickness symptoms. This relationship has been shown to be curvilinear, with symptoms approaching an asymptote for fields of view above 140°.Altering motion parallax distances to those less than the distance between the human eyes in large multiple-screen simulation setups can induce oculomotor distress, such as headaches, eyestrain, and blurred vision. [...] There are fewer reports of oculomotor distress on smaller screens; however, most simulation setups with motion parallax effects can still induce eyestrain, fatigue, and general discomfort over time.Viewing angle has been shown to increase a user's sickness symptoms, especially at extreme angles. [...] One example of such an extreme angle would be when a user must look downwards a short distance in front of their virtual feet. As opposed to a forward viewing angle, an extreme downward angle such as this has been shown to markedly increase sickness in virtual environments.Time spent immersed in a virtual environment contributes to sickness symptom presence due to the increasing effects of fatigue on the user. [...] Oculomotor symptoms are the most common to occur due to <b>immersion</b> <b>time,</b> but the nature of the user's movements (e.g., whole-body vs. head-only) is suggested to be the primary cause of nausea or physical sickness.|$|E
