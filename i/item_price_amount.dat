40|$|Unbalanced bidding {{models have}} largely ignored the risk aspect of <b>item</b> <b>pricing.</b> Many {{researchers}} have acknowledged {{that there are}} considerable risks associated with unbalancing a bid but little {{has been done to}} describe these risks, let alone model them. A new framework is proposed by which all of these risks can be assessed. It identifies that these risks comprise the risk of rejection, the risk of reaction, and the risk of being wrong. It is further proposed that the value‐at‐risk (‘VaR’) method of measuring risk is a convenient way by which to combine all of these risks into one composite assessment. This quantified assessment serves to describe the extent of risk generated by each level of each <b>item’s</b> <b>price.</b> Previous related research has proposed an unbalanced bidding model that has likewise provided a measurement of the expected reward generated by each level of each <b>item’s</b> <b>price.</b> By doing a summation of these, keeping in mind that the prices applied to all of a project’s component items must add up to the overall bid price, the contractor is able to assess both the risks as well as the rewards of all possible <b>item</b> <b>price</b> combinations.

40|$|The {{classical}} statistical correlation is {{an efficient}} technique for linking simple numerical data sets via a single correlation coefficient. The modem schemes for money laundering, financial fraud are becoming very sophisticated and are changed all the time. To {{be able to}} discover such schemes we need to deal simultaneously with a diverse set of numeric and non-numeric data types that include different numeric data types, ordered sets, graph structures, texts, schemes, plans, and other information. Often any individual evidence does not reveal a suspicious pattern and does not guide investigation in forensic accounting. In contrast correlation {{of two or more}} evidences with each other and background knowledge can reveal a suspicious pattern. A new area of Link Discovery (LD) emerged recently is a promising new area for such tasks. This paper outlines design of such a new technique called Hybrid Evidence Correlation (HEC). It combines first-order logic (FOL), probabilistic semantic inference (PSI) and negative rules for designing HEC to deal with rare suspicious patterns. The approach is illustrated with an example of discovery of suspicious patterns. Computational efficiency of the algorithm is justified by a computational experiment. Conceptual advantages of the algorithm such as completeness have been reported in previous mathematical analysis of the base concepts of the algorithm.

40|$|The {{outline of}} a {{proposed}} new unbalanced bidding model is discussed. Background is provided as regards the role of <b>item</b> <b>price</b> loading, otherwise known as unbalanced bidding. Three types of loading are described, namely those of ‘front-end loading’, ‘back-end loading’ and ‘quantity error exploitation’ (otherwise known as ‘individual rate loading’). It is proposed that one single mathematical model could embrace {{all three of the}} above types and that the aspect of risk may be addressed partially by means of using the quadratic programming techniques employed within the field of Modern Portfolio Theory. MPT is a field pioneered by Markowitz in 1959 and was developed to identify optimum portfolios of investments, typically equities. It is hypothesized that MPT presents a basis by which to distinguish Efficient <b>Item</b> <b>Pricing</b> combinations from inefficient ones and thereby provide a scientific tool by which rational contractors may optimally <b>price</b> a project’s <b>items.</b> A brief history of unbalanced bidding describes the field that was pioneered in the 1960 ’s by Marvin Gates and Robert Stark, as well as the subsequent contributions by the leading researchers in the field. unbalanced bidding, bidding models, <b>item</b> <b>price</b> loading, modern portfolio theory, construction industry, mathematical models, bidding strategies...|$|R

40|$|Building {{contractors}} are often commissioned using unit price based contracts. They, nevertheless, often compete {{on the basis}} of their overall project bids and yet are paid {{on the basis of}} these projectsâ constituent <b>item</b> <b>prices.</b> If a contractor decides these prices by way of applying an uneven mark-up to their estimates of their costs, this is known as unbalanced bidding. This research provides proof and explanation that different <b>item</b> <b>pricing</b> scenarios produce different levels of reward for a contractor, whilst exposing them to different degrees of risk. The theory describes the three identified sources of these rewards as well as provides the first explanation of the risks. It has identified the three types of risk involved and provides a model by which both the rewards as well as these risks can now be measured given any <b>item</b> <b>pricing</b> scenario. The research has included a study of the mainstream microeconomic techniques of Modern Portfolio Theory, Value-at-Risk, as well as Cumulative Prospect Theory that are all suited to making decisions that involve trading-off prospective rewards against risk. These techniques are then incorporated into a model that serves to identify the one <b>item</b> <b>pricing</b> combination that will produce the optimum value of utility as will be best suited to a contractorâs risk profile. The research has included the development of software written especially for this purpose in Java so that this theory could be tested on a hypothetical project.

40|$|Unbalanced bidding {{describes}} {{the process of}} contractors deliberately applying different mark-ups to individual items of work within a project.

A previous study on a hypothetical project indicated an improvement in profit in the order of 150 % compared to balanced <b>item</b> <b>prices.</b> Research has indicated that unbalanced bidding is a widespread practice and yet many researchers have argued that it is unethical.

40|$|We {{consider}} a monopolist seller with $n$ heterogeneous items, facing a single buyer. The buyer has a value {{for each item}} drawn independently according to (non-identical) distributions, and his value {{for a set of}} items is additive. The seller aims to maximize his revenue. It is known that an optimal mechanism in this setting may be quite complex, requiring randomization [HR 12] and menus of infinite size [DDT 13]. Hart and Nisan [HN 12] have initiated a study of two very simple pricing schemes for this setting: <b>item</b> <b>pricing,</b> in which each <b>item</b> is <b>priced</b> at its monopoly reserve; and bundle pricing, in which the entire set of <b>items</b> is <b>priced</b> and sold as one bundle. Hart and Nisan [HN 12] have shown that neither scheme can guarantee more than a vanishingly small fraction of the optimal revenue. In sharp contrast, we show that for any distributions, the better of <b>item</b> and bundle <b>pricing</b> is a constant-factor approximation to the optimal revenue.

40|$|The pricing of the {{constituent}} component items {{of a project}} has a substantial influence on the profitability of a project for a contractor. Despite this, there has been relatively little research done on this subject since ‘unbalanced bidding’ (the manipulation of component <b>item</b> <b>prices)</b> {{was identified as a}} viable strategy 50 years ago. The science now confirms that there are considerable benefits for contractors of large-scale projects if they adopt a well-disciplined and well-informed approach to the pricing of their work – whether this is building construction, road or bridge-building, or aircraft or ship manufacture. This book outlines a new approach, called CUP Theory (Construction Unit Pricing Theory), which is intended to lay a new foundation for a scientifically based approach to <b>item</b> <b>pricing.</b> It shows that contractors could increase their profit by as much as 150 % without much change to their risk.

This book is intended to help establish a new foundation by which research into this field can be more openly discussed and debated, recognising that <b>item</b> <b>pricing</b> per se need not be unethical or exploitative, and that the industry – as a whole – has much to benefit from a more professional, more quantitatively sophisticated, and more openly discussed approach to this important subject...|$|R

We consider two scenarios for determining bundle prices that allow to break this inapproximability barrier. Both scenarios are motivated by problems where items are different, yet comparable. First, we consider classical single <b>item</b> <b>prices</b> with an additional monotonicity constraint, enforcing that larger bundles are at least as expensive as smaller ones.
