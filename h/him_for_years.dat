5|$|Numerous colleges showed {{interest}} and recruited Heyward, including UCLA, which offered a full-ride scholarship {{due in part}} to the family connection. Heyward was also especially interested in Clemson and Georgia Tech. Concurrently, the hometown Atlanta Braves had followed and scouted <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>years,</b> while attempting to conceal their excitement. They made him the 14th overall selection in the 2007 Major League Baseball draft. Despite signing a National Letter of Intent with UCLA, Heyward chose professional baseball over college and signed a contract with them worth $1.7 million – $170,000 more than MLB's slot recommendation of $1.53 million on the following August 12. It was the same as the 2006 14th-slot amount that the Toronto Blue Jays gave Travis Snider.|$|E
5|$|The {{judge for}} the wager, {{the editor of}} Field magazine, {{declared}} Wallace the winner, but Hampden {{refused to accept the}} result. He sued Wallace and launched a campaign, which persisted for several years, of writing letters to various publications and to organisations of which Wallace was a member denouncing him as a swindler and a thief. Wallace won multiple libel suits against Hampden, but the resulting litigation cost Wallace more than the amount of the wager and the controversy frustrated <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>years.</b>|$|E
5|$|Zack {{had only}} a small role in the {{original}} Final Fantasy VII. He is first mentioned by name in Gongaga, his hometown, where his parents are oblivious as to what became of him after he left to join SOLDIER, and are worried for his safety after not hearing from <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>years.</b> It {{is at this point}} that Aerith explains Zack was her first love. Cloud later realizes that some of his memories and even aspects of his personality were actually Zack's, and not his own. Flashbacks reveal that both Zack and Cloud battled Sephiroth after he burned the town of Nibelheim upon discovering he {{was the result of a}} scientific experiment. After Cloud defeated Sephiroth, both Zack and Cloud were taken to be used in experiments by Shinra. Eventually, Zack woke up and was able to escape with a semi-conscious Cloud to the city Midgar, but on the edge of the city, he was gunned down by Shinra troops. While Zack's and Cloud's flashback escape is optional in the North American and European releases of Final Fantasy VII and the Japanese International version, it was originally planned to be shown once Cloud discovered the results of Shinra's experiments.|$|E

5|$|Following the war, he saw {{action against}} Jewish guerrillas during the Palestine Emergency. While in Palestine, {{he participated in}} {{operations}} to arrest Jewish militants. During Operation Agatha, which saw most of the Jewish political leadership in Palestine detained, Mitchell's mission was to arrest Moshe Shertok (a future Prime Minister of Israel). Initially, his unit raided the wrong house. However, they were later able to find and arrest him. In July 1946, he witnessed the King David Hotel bombing: he and his company commander were within 300 feet of the building when the bombing occurred. While on a personal reconnaissance mission, he was shot and wounded {{by one of his}} own Bren gunners, who mistook him for a guerrilla. After recovering from his injuries, he was transferred from his regiment to become aide-de-camp to General Gordon MacMillan, the commander of British forces in Palestine and Transjordan. He spent a total of three years in Palestine. While there, he made friends among both the Arabs and Jews, including Moshe Dayan, a future Israeli general who would become one of Mitchell's heroes, as well as Moshe Shertok, who developed a cordial relationship with Mitchell after his arrest and corresponded with <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>years</b> afterward, when he became a senior Israeli government official.|$|E
5|$|Sienna grows {{feelings}} for Darren and they kiss, although Darren later reunites with Nancy after she recovers. Desperate {{to get rid}} of Nancy, Sienna frames Nancy for several dilemmas, including leaving Oscar trapped in a fire, {{in order to make it}} look like she is still addicted to painkillers. Tom catches Sienna trying to breast feed Oscar, although Sienna accuses Tom of trying to take topless pictures of her. Darren believes Sienna's lies that Nancy is still a painkiller addict, resulting in Nancy moving out and Darren and Sienna beginning a relationship. Sienna begins faking a pregnancy although is devastated when she overhears Darren saying he doesn't want the baby. In order to get Darren closer, Sienna attempts to officially get rid of Nancy and she frames Nancy for trying to kill Oscar, Charlie and herself. Nancy is taken to a mental institute because of this. Darren later finds out that Sandy Roscoe (Gillian Taylforth) is his mother and disowns Jack for lying to <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>years.</b> Darren, Sienna and Oscar move out because of this. Tom realizes what Sienna has done to Nancy and attempts to expose her by putting a video camera in her bedroom.

Darren later makes up with Jack when he is nearly killed in an explosion.|$|E

25|$|Graham {{has had a}} {{personal}} audience with many sitting US presidents, from Harry S. Truman to Barack Obama—12 consecutive presidents. After meeting with Truman in 1950, Graham told the press he had urged the president to counter communism in North Korea.

25|$|Like his contemporary, Elizabeth I of England, Rudolf dangled {{himself as}} a prize {{in a string of}} {{diplomatic}} negotiations for marriages, but never in fact married. During his periods of self-imposed isolation, Rudolf reportedly had affairs with his court chamberlain, Wolfgang von Rumpf, and a series of valets.

25|$|In {{the early}} 1880s Cross began to {{experience}} {{trouble with his}} eyes, which grew more severe in the 1900s. He also increasingly suffered from arthritis. At least {{in part due to}} these health issues that plagued <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>years,</b> Cross's body of work is relatively small. However, in his last years he was productive and very creative, and his work was featured in significant solo exhibitions; he received great acclaim from critics and enjoyed commercial success.|$|E
25|$|Philip {{accordingly}} wrote Luther for {{his opinion}} about the matter, alleging as a precedent the polygamy of the patriarchs, but Luther replied {{that it was not}} enough for a Christian to consider the acts of the patriarchs, rather that he, like the patriarchs, must have special divine sanction. Since such sanction was clearly lacking in this case, Luther advised against bigamous marriage, especially for Christians, unless there was extreme necessity, as, for example, if the wife was leprous, or abnormal in other respects. Despite this discouragement, Philip gave up neither his project to secure a bigamous marriage nor his life of sensuality, which kept <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>years</b> from receiving communion.|$|E
25|$|Joe Watt {{returned}} to Fraserburgh {{after the war}} and refused point blank to ever speak of his war experience again, even to his wife. His boat Annie had been lost in the war to a sea mine, and so he bought Benachie as a replacement, on board which he once forgot to remove his cap on meeting the Duke of Kent, an omission which mortified <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>years</b> afterwards. He served on several other fishing vessels over the next twenty years before joining the Navy again as a drifter captain to serve in the Second World War, which he spent on uneventful duties in home waters accompanied by his son who had been wounded in the Battle of France serving with the Gordon Highlanders and invalided out of the army. He was on occasion heard to complain that he had been refused foreign service due to his age, which he seemed to feel should be an advantage rather than a hindrance.|$|E

500|$|Baggio has {{described}} the miss as the worst moment of his career, stating it affected <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>years.</b> He later reflected, [...] "Penalties are only missed {{by those who have}} the courage to take them." [...] Before him, two other Italians, Franco Baresi and Daniele Massaro, had already missed penalties. Having led Italy to the final, Baggio received the Silver Ball as the second-best player of the tournament, behind Romário, and the Silver Boot for finishing tied for second in goals scored. He was also named in the World Cup All-Star Team. Baggio finished runner-up for the Ballon d'Or, with 136 points from a possible 245, and third place for the FIFA World Player of the Year in 1994.|$|E

500|$|Stewart {{approached}} the project with gusto, remarking that he [...] "wrote an adaptation from {{a novel that}} tells about the fascist mice who are nibbling away at our country while we're busy fighting a good war". Stewart believed Hollywood had punished <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>years</b> for his political views, and felt vindicated by the assignment, declaring that [...] "here was my compensation for the sabotage of my radical attempt to do my bit...". The script was the proudest moment of his entire career. Stewart, however, had extensive problems adapting the novel for the screen, and filming—originally due to begin in June 1942—was delayed for several months while {{he worked on the}} screenplay. He consulted with the Bureau of Motion Pictures in the U.S. Office of War Information, an agency of the federal government created in June 1942 to promote patriotism and warn the public about domestic spying.|$|E
500|$|The {{screenplay}} by Donald Ogden Stewart {{is adapted from}} the novel Keeper of the Flame by I. A. R. Wylie. Hepburn plays the widow of a famous civic leader who has suddenly died in an accident, while Tracy portrays a former war correspondent who intends to write a flattering biography of the dead man, {{only to find that}} his death is shrouded in mystery. [...] Screenwriter Stewart considered the script to be the finest moment of his entire career, feeling vindicated by the assignment as he believed that Hollywood had punished <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>years</b> for his political views. Principal filming began in the last week of August 1942, four months after the release of the novel, published by Random House. The entire picture was filmed on a sound stage, with no location shooting. Hepburn had already begun her extramarital affair with Tracy, and due to his heavy drinking, she became his constant guardian during filming.|$|E
500|$|Macaulay {{displayed}} a temper when matters went against him. Robertson-Glasgow {{described him as}} an unusual man, [...] "fiercely independent, witty, argumentative, swift to joy and anger. He had pleasure in cracking a convention or cursing an enemy... A cricket-bag came {{between him and his}} blazer hanging on a peg; and he'd kick it and tell it a truth or two, then laugh." [...] Bill Bowes described how, when he was bowling, he would glare and mutter under his breath; he seemed to be [...] "filled with a devilish energy". He would make sharp or biting comments, particularly if a fielder made a mistake when he was bowling and although often amusing, it could at times hurt the recipients, and his anger made his team-mates wary of him. Yet, he could also express appreciation when a skillful batsmen hit a good shot from his bowling; the result was that his colleagues were never sure what to expect from him, even after playing with <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>years.</b> Herbert Sutcliffe said he could be charming when not playing, but his wit could be sharp. Robertson-Glasgow nevertheless described him as [...] "a glorious opponent; a great cricketer; and a companion in a thousand".|$|E
