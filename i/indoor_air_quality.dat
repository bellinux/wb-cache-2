The average values recorded in analyzed parameters of the laboratory <b>indoor</b> <b>air</b> <b>qualities</b> were within the admitted values.

25|$|Copper’s {{antimicrobial}} properties {{can enhance}} the performance of HVAC systems and associated <b>indoor</b> <b>air</b> <b>quality.</b> After extensive testing, copper became a registered material in the U.S. for protecting {{heating and air conditioning}} equipment surfaces against bacteria, mold, and mildew.

25|$|There {{are some}} {{varieties}} of mold that contain toxic compounds (mycotoxins). However, exposure to hazardous levels of mycotoxin via inhalation {{is not possible}} in most cases, as toxins are produced by the fungal body and are not at significant levels in the released spores. The primary hazard of mold growth, {{as it relates to}} <b>indoor</b> <b>air</b> <b>quality,</b> comes from the allergenic properties of the spore cell wall. More serious than most allergenic properties is the ability of mold to trigger episodes in persons that already have asthma, a serious respiratory disease.|$|E
25|$|Also {{important}} to <b>indoor</b> <b>air</b> <b>quality</b> is {{the control of}} moisture accumulation (dampness) leading to mold growth {{and the presence of}} bacteria and viruses as well as dust mites and other organisms and microbiological concerns. Water intrusion through a building's envelope or water condensing on cold surfaces on the building's interior can enhance and sustain microbial growth.

25|$|In many cases, if {{materials}} {{have failed to}} dry out several days after the suspected water event, mold growth is suspected within wall cavities {{even if it is}} not immediately visible.

In a situation where there is visible mold and the <b>indoor</b> <b>air</b> <b>quality</b> may have been compromised, mold remediation may be needed.

25|$|Restrictions upon {{smoking in}} bars and {{restaurants}} can substantially improve the air quality in such establishments. For example, one study listed on the website of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that New York's statewide law to eliminate smoking in enclosed workplaces and public places substantially reduced RSP (respirable suspended particles) levels in western New York hospitality venues. RSP levels were reduced in every venue that permitted smoking before the law was implemented, including venues in which only second-hand smoke from an adjacent room was observed at baseline. The CDC concluded that their results were similar to other studies which also showed substantially improved <b>indoor</b> <b>air</b> <b>quality</b> after smoking bans were instituted.|$|E
25|$|In 2000 {{the state}} of New York {{introduced}} a green building tax credit, the first one {{of its kind in}} the United States, that has allowed some developers of environmentally friendly buildings to write off as much as $6 million on their tax bill.

The guidelines had led to approximately $700 million in green city construction projects by the end of 2005. In 2005, New York City mandated that nonresidential public buildings costing $2 million or more be built to standards set by Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), which grade buildings in areas like energy and water consumption, <b>indoor</b> <b>air</b> <b>quality</b> and use of renewable materials.

25|$|The United States Centers For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) {{performed}} <b>indoor</b> <b>air</b> <b>quality</b> {{testing for}} formaldehyde {{in some of}} the units. On February 14, 2008, the CDC announced that potentially hazardous levels of formaldehyde were found in many of the travel trailers and manufactured homes provided by the agency. The CDC's preliminary evaluation of a scientifically established random sample of 519 travel trailers and manufactured homes tested between December 21, 2007, and January 23, 2008 (2+ years after manufacture), showed average levels of formaldehyde in all units of about 0.077 parts per million (ppm). Long-term exposure to levels in this range can be linked to an increased risk of cancer and, at levels above this range, there can also be a risk of respiratory illness. These levels are higher than expected in indoor air, where levels are commonly in the range of 0.01–0.02 ppm, and are higher than the Agency for Toxic Substance Disease Registry (ATSDR, division of the CDC) Minimal Risk Level (MRL) of 0.008 ppm. Levels measured ranged from 0.003 ppm to 0.59 ppm.|$|E
25|$|To {{eliminate}} most complaints, {{the total}} indoor CO2 level should {{be reduced to}} a difference of less than 600 ppm above outdoor levels. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) considers that indoor air concentrations of carbon dioxide that exceed 1,000 ppm are a marker suggesting inadequate ventilation. The UK standards for schools say that carbon dioxide in all teaching and learning spaces, when measured at seated head height and averaged over the whole day should not exceed 1,500 ppm. The whole day refers to normal school hours (i.e. 9:00am to 3:30pm) and includes unoccupied periods such as lunch breaks. In Hong Kong, the EPD established <b>indoor</b> <b>air</b> <b>quality</b> objectives for office buildings and public places in which a carbon dioxide level below 1,000 ppm is considered to be good. European standards limit carbon dioxide to 3,500 ppm. OSHA limits carbon dioxide concentration in the workplace to 5,000 ppm for prolonged periods, and 35,000 ppm for 15 minutes. These higher limits are concerned with avoiding loss of consciousness (fainting), and do not address impaired cognitive performance and energy, which begin to occur at lower concentrations of carbon dioxide.|$|E
