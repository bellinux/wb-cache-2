This thesis contains explaining of basic principle of flexographic printing and preview of types of flexographic printing presses. There are explained patented cleaning units and main claims of every patented cleaning unit. In the next part of this thesis, there are some conceptual designs, from which was chosen the final design for manufacturing. In the next part of this work, there are detailly described each of the parts of cleaning unit. Prototype of the cleaning unit was manufactured and tested in the SOMA Engineering s. r. o. Lanškroun. Cleaning unit will simplify the work of operators and reduce time, needed to clean the central <b>impression</b> <b>drum</b> in comparison with manually cleaning...|$|E

The sixteen-faced dome is decorated with arches, the bases of whose columns are connected by triangular ledges and spheres, with a band around the drum’s bottom. This adds to the optical height of the dome and creates the <b>impression</b> that its <b>drum</b> is weightless. The platband of the southern portal's architrave is framed with rows of trefoils.|$|R

[...] He was {{impressed}} with the [...] "lively and fascinating sense of local culture" [...] that dominated the film. Kline, who gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, was mainly concerned with the film's [...] "rather clumsy" [...] direction and screenwriting. Maseko directed with [...] "energy and verve," [...] though his [...] "struggles to capture the human drama" [...] led to the <b>impression</b> that <b>Drum</b> was [...] "a clunky TV movie, with awkward camera angles, wonky editing and clumsy sound recording." [...] Filardi was guilty of a dialogue which [...] "echoes with cliches, while contrived plotting put characters into situations that may be true, but they feel corny and movie-like." [...] Kline also criticised the wide variety of political issues that characterised the film, though added that [...] "maybe this helps us begin to understand what life must have been like under such an oppressive government." ...|$|R
50|$|After {{the demise}} of this band, Morimoto and Maekawa stayed in Tokyo. Morimoto {{followed}} his passion of fishing and became a competition angler (he still writes for Japan's largest fishing magazine, Basser Magazine) and Maekawa joined The Apollos (a well-known Japanese funk band) as session bassist. Maekawa's low-slung bass and unkempt appearance was at odds with The Apollos' suited and polished image, and meant that his time in this role was short lived. However, Maekawa left a lasting <b>impression</b> on their <b>drummer,</b> Tomoharu Ito (known as Gian, due to his similar appearance to a well-known Japanese comedian of that name). Gian, who had a day job making false teeth, was soon introduced to Morimoto, and the three started practicing together shortly afterwards.|$|R
