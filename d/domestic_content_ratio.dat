40|$|<b>Domestic</b> <b>content</b> {{requirements}} are regulations that mandate minimum percentages of domestic value-added, or domestic components for products sold within the country, or provide strong incentives to substitute domestic for imported inputs. The author developed {{a model to}} investigate the distortions, costs, and transfers among groups caused by the combination of <b>domestic</b> <b>content</b> and compensatory export requirements. This model {{was applied to the}} protection scheme for Uruguay's automobile industry. The author found that the protective regime keeps vehicle prices and domestic production costs high and transfers large sums to special interest groups. Higher finished vehicle prices encourage more output from domestic assembly operations, but <b>domestic</b> <b>content</b> and compensatory export requirements discourage domestic assembly. The net effect could either encourage or discourage domestic assembly operations, depending on the net impact of the regulations. Trade in this industry should be liberalized. Care should be taken not to inadvertently increase effective protection of the assembly industry by, for example, phasing out <b>domestic</b> <b>content</b> and compensatory export requirements on kits faster than those on finished autos, thus temporarily encouraging domestic assembly.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{economics}} of <b>domestic</b> cultural <b>content</b> protection in terrestrial broadcasting, the most widespread policy instrument used in broadcasting. Using the love-of-variety approach, we model a representative consumer deriving utility from broadcasting services net of advertising,and allocating scarce time between consuming the various broadcasting services and leisure. Advertising is a nuisance; it costs time yet brings no utility. Broadcasting is a pure public good; broadcasters make profit in the monopolistic competition environment by bundling advertising with valuable cultural content. We impose a discrete <b>domestic</b> <b>content</b> requirement and then investigate the effects of its marginal changes on consumption of <b>domestic</b> broadcasting. <b>Domestic</b> <b>content</b> requirement may reduce (increase) consumption of domestic programs when consumer's demand is highly elastic (inelastic), the degree of preference for foreign <b>content</b> over <b>domestic</b> <b>content</b> is high (low) and opportunity cost of listening time is high (low).

By our estimation, the share of <b>domestic</b> <b>content</b> in exports by the PRC was about 50 % before China’s WTO membership, and has risen to over 60 % since then.

40|$|We apply {{a direct}} {{approach}} to estimate domestic value added {{embedded in the}} People's Republic of China's (PRC) exports. The estimates suggest that the domestic value added of processing exports and processing high-tech exports gradually increased from 30 % and 25 %, to 44 % and 45 %, respectively, between 1997 and 2012. On the other hand, the <b>domestic</b> <b>content</b> of processing exports with supplied materials fell to 14 % from the peak of 35 %. In 2012, the domestic value added of the PRC's total exports remained below 77 %. Our estimates {{prove to be the}} upper limits of the corresponding trade in value added. Compared to our estimates, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's Trade in Value Added database (TiVA) significantly overestimates the <b>domestic</b> <b>content</b> of the PRC's exports.

In addition, we show that the PRC's processing exports demonstrate significant heterogeneity across its trading partners; processing exports account for a large portion of total exports to high income countries but a relatively small portion of exports to low income countries. This heterogeneity implies that the <b>domestic</b> <b>content</b> of the PRC's exports varies significantly by destination...|$|R

MethodsSaliva samples from 20 splenic asthenia children and 29 healthy children were collected before and after citric acid stimulation. AMY 1 copy number, salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) activity, and total sAA and glycosylated sAA contents were determined, and their correlations were analyzed. ResultsAlthough splenic asthenia and healthy children had no differences in AMY 1 copy number, splenic asthenia children had positive correlations between AMY 1 copy number and sAA activity before or after citric acid stimulation. Splenic asthenia children had a higher sAA glycosylated proportion ratio and glycosylated sAA <b>content</b> <b>ratio,</b> while their total sAA <b>content</b> <b>ratio</b> and sAA activity ratio were lower compared with healthy children.
