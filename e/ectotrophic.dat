50|$|The fungus forms many white, {{somewhat}} flattened mycelia strands 1-2 mm {{thick that}} grow on and adhere strongly {{to the surface}} of the root bark. These rhizomorphs grow rapidly and may extend several meters through the soil in the absence of any woody substrate. Thus, healthy rubber trees can be infected by free rhizomorphs growing from stumps or infected woody debris buried in the ground as well as by roots contacting those of a diseased neighboring tree. Internal progression of the fungus in root tissues lags well behind the front of epiphytic growth of the mycelium on the root. In this respect, the mode of development of R. lignosus is characteristic of an <b>ectotrophic</b> growth habit. After rhizomorphs infect the roots, the fungus preferentially penetrates the taproot, deep in the soil. First, however, the rhizomorphs must change morphogenetically into infectious hyphae, characterized by degrading extracellular enzymes able to decay the wood. This mechanism is strictly regulated by conditions of partial anoxia in the soil, at a depth determined by whether the texture is sandy or clayey.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1985 Studies to {{identify}} the environmental factors that influence the rate of <b>ectotrophic</b> mycelial growth of Phellinus weirii (Murr.) Gilbertson along Douglas-fir roots were undertaken both in the laboratory and in the field. The effects of soil pH, nitrogen, moisture, temperature, microorganisms and bulk density were investigated. In the lab, the rates of <b>ectotrophic</b> mycelial growth from Alnus inoculum blocks onto 1. 5 cm diameter Douglas-fir branch sections, glass rods and wood dowels buried in 475 cm³ soil tubes filled with autoclaved, pasteurized or untreated forest soils were compared. Maximum <b>ectotrophic</b> mycelial growth occurred along Douglas-fir branches. The rates of growth along Douglas-fir branches were similar in autoclaved, pasteurized and untreated soils, but the fungus only grew profusely into the sterilized soils. <b>Ectotrophic</b> mycelial growth averaged 9. 0 cm after 25 days. Penetration of the pith from the cut end of the branch section occurred more rapidly than penetration through the xylem. <b>Ectotrophic</b> mycelial growth of P. weirii was greatest at 15 % soil water content. Maximum growth occurred at 20 - 25 C. Field inoculations {{to determine the effects}} of soil environment on the rate of <b>ectotrophic</b> mycelial growth of P. weirii were performed in two Douglas-fir plantations on the east side of the Oregon Coast Range, near Corvallis, Oregon. Roots were inoculated by tying inoculum blocks to living roots, and test treatments were produced by altering the soil around inoculated roots. After one year, the roots were removed and inoculation success and <b>ectotrophic</b> mycelial growth were measured. <b>Ectotrophic</b> mycelium was observed on 58 % of the inoculated roots. However, on 10 % of the roots, the fungus failed to grow beyond the plastic ribbon that was wrapped around the inoculation area. The majority of <b>ectotrophic</b> mycelial growth appeared to have taken place during the first few months after inoculation. Although <b>ectotrophic</b> growth was dramatically enhanced in the vicinity of the wounds, the rate of growth away from the wound area was not significantly affected (90 % confidence). Penetration of the fungus into the root was observed in 53 % of the successful inoculations. P. weirii was isolated from the phloem of 24 % of these roots. Colonization of roots was markedly enhanced by root wounding. The average total extent of P. weirii along inoculated roots, where any growth had occurred, was 15. 5 cm. However, variation was high, so conclusions must be tentative. Soil pasteurization and elevated soil temperatures markedly decreased inoculation success. In contrast, changes in soil pH, moisture and bulk density had relatively little effect. The extent of P. weirii growth along inoculated roots decreased with changes in soil pH, moisture and nitrogen levels, both above and below ambient levels. Relatively little change was associated with pasteurization, compaction and temperature treatments...|$|E

FRANK'S (i) classification of mycorrhizas into <b>ectotrophic</b> and endotrophicforms is still accepted in botanical textbooks, and although the separation of these two types may sometimes appear rigid and inadequate (Rayner, 2; Harley 3), it is nevertheless generally convenient and informative. There are a number of lists available supplying the names of plants regularly affected by one or other of these two forms of mycorrhizal infection, but this classification into <b>ectotrophic</b> and endotrophic plants is useful only so long as comparison is made with typical examples of these types.

40|$|We {{recognize}} it everywhere in Japan that Pinus densiflora and P. Thunbergii generally grow in such unfavourable habitats as coast dune or waste mountainland. However, {{there is no}} fixed theory about its cause. We can conjecture that many special physiological characters will affect, but beside the <b>ectotrophic</b> mycorrhizas may have some causality on the pine growing. I observed, therefore, the external appearances and microtomic sections of <b>ectotrophic</b> mycorrhizas that were collected from various habitats, hoping to clear the difference among these mycorrhizas. The results are the following : (1) When the water content is enough and the humus is poor in the soil, {{the roots of the}} pine grow long and slender, then the roots branch off into many numbers and increase the root-hairs. (2) When the water content is moderate and the humus is rich in the soil, the pine has many roots and few mycorrhizas which consist of single mycorrhizas, not compound mycorrhizas. On the surface of many roots, fungus filaments spread a little and they don 2 ̆ 7 t form the fungus mantles. The more poorer humus in the soil, the more the single and compound mycorrhizas increase. In case of the humus and water content in the soil being very poor but aeration being sufficient, <b>ectotrophic</b> mycorrhizas deverope well and almost all of them become the compound mycorrhizas and a root can not be discovered. In this case the fungus mantles are very thick, being 15 - 45 μ in thickness. Hartig 2 ̆ 7 s network which is formed by two or three rows of fungus filaments deveropes well among cortical cells, {{in spite of the fact}} that it is formed generally by fungus filaments of one row. This resulted with the same tendency as the experiment of Moller 2 ̆ 7 s study on Pinus silvestris (3) In spite of the fact that <b>ectotrophic</b> mycorrhiza must deverope under such conditions as given under (2), becarese of water content and humus being very poor in the soil, when the soil is very compact and the aeration is unfavourable as in clay land, the <b>ectotrophic</b> mycorrhiza can not be formed and it become like the root of the seedling that was cultured in sterilized soil. It must braches off into many numbers and increase root-hairs in the ordinaly course as under (t), but it few branches off and has very few root-hairs. (4) When the <b>ectotrophic</b> mycorrhizas deverope well and the fungus mantles are very thick, the root is not found and the compound mycorrhizas increase. In the opposite case, roots increase and single mycorrhizas also are formed, but a compound mycorrhizas is not found.

40|$|The roles {{temperature}} and shade play in ultradwarf bermudagrass health are not totally understood. BY RICHARD H. WHITE Tifeagle bermudagrass green {{at the time}} of treatment initiation in July. Brmudagrass decline is a devastat-ing root disease of highly man-aged bermudagrass turf, especially on golf greens in the southern United States (Elliott, 1991). It is caused by an interaction of host-predisposing abiotic stresses and the soil-borne, <b>ectotrophic,</b> root-infecting fungus Gaeumannomyces graminis var. graminis (Ggg). Bermuda-grass decline results in large areas of turf with weakened, short, brown-to-black root systems and an absence of feeder roots and root hairs. Symp-toms include foliar chlorosis, a thin-ning stand, poor response to fertilizer and irrigation, and premature plant death. The pathogen causes root, rhizome, and stolon rotting. Nutrient and irrigation manage-ment is difficult because of diminished root systems. Above-ground symptoms of infection often become evident any-where from spring green-up through the spring and summer months, when heat and moisture stress challenge the weakened root systems of affected plants. Symptoms also are common during cloudy, wet periods of late summer and early fall...|$|E

The seedlings captured a high diversity of mycorrhizal ITS-types and late-stage fungi were well represented. Total richness was 75 types, with 42 types having a frequency of only one. The first and second order jackknife estimates were 116 and 143 types, respectively. Among Basidiomycetes, tomentelloid/thelephoroid, russuloid, and cortinarioid groups were the richest. The ascomycete Cenococcum geophilum was ubiquitously present. Dominant fungi included a putative Tuber sp.

40|$|The {{relation}} of the mycorrhizal soil fungi {{to the growth of}} conifers has long been a controversial subject. 3 Recent experiments in nursery production, in afforestation and in extending the range of certain species of conifers (11, 14, 21, 32, 36, 37, 38) have reemphasized the importance of these fungi in promoting tree growth and aiding nutrition. Nonetheless, the manner in which these organisms work is still obscure, and growth stimulation of seedlings has been attributed both to effects resulting from the invasion of short roots by fungi and to the activity of the fungus in the soil adjacent to the roots. The invasion of the short roots by the fungus commonly results in the formation of <b>ectotrophic</b> mycorrhizae which are characterized by an external fungal mantle and an internal Hartig net (16). When the fungus is more active, intracellular haustoria (48) are formed in addition to the intercellular net, and these types of mycorrhizae have been called ectendotrophic. The nature of the fungal infection is apparently dependent to a considerable degree upon the species of fungus and the relative vigor of both the host plant and the fungus. Endotrophic mycorrhizae, which are characterized by intracellular infection, but which lack the fungal mantle and Hartig net, are apparently not common among the pines...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Recognizing annosus root disease {{affecting}} conifers {{in northwestern}} United States forests is discussed. Field diagnosis {{can be made}} by observing characteristic stand patterns, wood stain and decay, <b>ectotrophic</b> mycelium, and sporophores. Most seriously affected trees include hemlocks, grand fir, white fir and Pacific silver fir. Ponderosa pine and other true firs may also be damaged. Wounded trees, especially hemlocks and true firs, are readily colonized by Heterobasidion annosum and wounds can be used as an indicator of infection. Laboratory analysis can be used to confirm field diagnosis. Annosus root disease, which is caused by Heterobasidion annosum (Fr.) Bref. (= Fomes annosus (Fr.) Karst.) is a common cause of root and butt decay of conifers in the northwestern United States. All conifers can be infected, but there are species differences in degree of susceptibility and types of damage. Species most susceptible to infection and damage include western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), mountain hemlock (T. mertensiana), grand fir (Abies grandis), white fir (A. concolor) and Pacific silver fir (A. amabilis). The damage resulting from infection may include butt decay, probably reduced growth rates, windthrow, attack by secondary pests, and direct mortality. Species less commonly infected include ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), noble fir (A. procera), subalpine fir (A. lasiocarpa), and California red fir (A. magnifica) (Hadfield and others, 1986).

40|$|The {{adsorption}} {{of radioactive}} mucilage by pathogenic fungi {{was shown to}} be dependent upon time, the composition of mucilage, the type of fungal surface (conidia, hyphae, hyphal apices), fungal species, pH and bivalent cations. All fungal adhesins were inactivated by either proteinase or polysaccharase treatments. Adsorption was not inhibited by the numberous mono-, di- and oligo-saccharides that were tested individually, but it was inhibited absolutely by several polysaccharides. This suggested that adsorption of mucilage by pathogens involved conformational and ionic interactions between plant and fungal polymers but not fungal lectins bound to sugar residues of mucilage. Several fractionation schemes showed that pathogens bound only the most acidic {{of the variety of}} polymers that comprise mucilage. There was not any absolute distinction between ability to bind radioactive mucilage and type of pathogen or non-pathogen. However, there were notable differences in characteristics of adsorption between two types of pathogen. Differences were revealed by comparison of the adsorption capacities of conidia and germinant conidia and chromatography of radioactive mucilage on germinant conidia. An <b>ectotrophic</b> root-infecting fungus (a highly specialized pathogen) bound a greater proportion of mucilage than did a vascular-wilt fungus (of catholic host and tissue range) with more than one class of site for adsorption.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine the impact of two exotic tree species (pine and eucalypts) on the early growth of Uapaca bojeri (an endemic tree species from Madagascar) via their influence on soil chemical, microbial characteristics, on ectomycorrhizal fungal community structures in a Madagascarian highland forest and to test the ability of an early-successional ectomycorrhizal shrub, Leptolena bojeriana, to mitigate the impacts of these exotic species. Finally, we hypothesized that L. bojeriana could act as a natural provider for ectomycorrhizal propagules. Soil bioassays were conducted with U. bojeri seedlings grown in soils collected under the native tree species (U. bojeri and L. bojeriana) and two exotic tree species (Eucalyptus camaldulensis and Pinus patula) and in the same soils but previously cultured by L. bojeriana seedlings. This study clearly shows that (1) the introduction of exotic tree species induces significant changes in soil biotic and abiotic characteristics, (2) exotic-invaded soil significantly reduces the early growth and ectomycorrhization of U. bojeri seedlings and (3) L. bojeriana decreased these negative effects of the exotic tree species by facilitating ectomycorrhizal establishment and consequently improved the U. bojeri early growth. This study provides evidence that L. bojeriana can facilitate the ectomycorrhizal infection of U. bojeri and mitigates the negative effects of the introduction of exotic tree species on the early growth of the native tree species.

40|$|Acacia mearnsii {{is one of}} {{the most}} planted Australian Acacia around the world but is known to be highly invasive, {{threatening}} native habitats by competing with indigenous vegetation. The introduction of this species in the Algerian El Kala Biosphere reserve led to the invasion of natural formations to the detriment of Quercus suber, a native tree species. We hypothesized that shifts in soil microbial functions and ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungal community structure triggered by this exotic Acacia species might correlate with a decrease of the early growth of Q suber. Soil samples were thus collected from 3 different sites where the exotic species was at different stages of invasion in the Algerian El Kala Biosphere reserve, (i) a Q suber forest free of A. mearnsii (site S 1), (ii) a Q suber/A. mearnsii mixed forest where the Australian Acacia has been recently detected (site S 2) and (iii) pure stands of A. mearnsii formed more than 20 years ago (site S 3). Plant growth, EcM community structure associated with Q. suber roots and soil microbial functionalities were assessed for 6 month-old cultures of Q suber in glasshouse conditions. The results clearly demonstrated a strong deleterious impact of A. mearnsii invasion level on soil chemical characteristics, microbial functions and EcM community structure and colonization, correlated to a decrease in the early growth of Q suber seedlings. The current study gives new insights into both the negative impact of exotic species on soil functioning and their effect on indigenous vegetation growth. These results may be used as a basis for improving the conservation practices of native tree species in such degraded areas as a complement of ecological strategies using indigenous <b>ectotrophic</b> early-successional shrub species (eg.

Variations of colony morphology, hyphopodia production, teleomorphic and anamorphic structures, and growth rate of isolates were examined on potato dextrose agar (PDA), and rice seedling pathogenicity assays were performed. A multilocus phylogeny reconstruction was developed to support phenotypic data and to resolve the phylogeny of Ggg. Fungicide sensitivities were also evaluated. Azoxystrobin 50 % effective concentration (EC 50) values of nine isolates were determined in the presence and absence of salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM) for determination of alternative respiration. Tebuconazole and azoxystrobin EC 50 values from 15 and 20 isolates, respectively, were used to establish single discriminatory concentrations for resistance screening and EC 50 determination of remaining isolates. Isolates were also screened for thiophanate-methyl resistance. Three phenotypic groups were found on PDA: (i) highly melanized with round colony formation (termed M group), (ii) non to slightly melanized with round colony formation (termed L group), and (iii) highly melanized with irregular colony formation (termed H group). All isolates produced lobed hyphopodia and a Phialophora-like anamorph, where phialospore lengths were significantly longer among M and H groups compared to the L group. M group isolates were adapted to warmer temperatures compared to L and H group isolates, and groups were differentiated based on growth rates at 35 ?C. The M group was most aggressive.
