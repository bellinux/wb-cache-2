40|$|AbstractAging in S. cerevisiae is {{exemplified}} by the fixed number of cell divisions that mother cells undergo (termed their life span). We have exploited a correlation between life span and stress resistance to identify mutations in four genes that <b>extend</b> <b>life</b> span. One of these, SIR 4, encodes {{a component of the}} silencing apparatus at HM loci and telomeres. The sir 4 - 42 mutation <b>extends</b> <b>life</b> span by more than 30 % and is semidominant. Our findings suggest that sir 4 - 42 <b>extends</b> <b>life</b> span by preventing recruitment of the SIR proteins to HM loci and telomeres, thereby increasing their concentration at other chromosomal regions. Maintaining silencing at these other regions maybe critical in preventing aging. Consistent with this view, expression of only the carboxyl terminus of SIR 4 interferes with silencing at HM loci and telomeres, which also <b>extends</b> <b>life</b> span. Possible links among silencing, telomere maintenance, and aging in other organisms are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Calorie {{restriction}} can <b>extend</b> <b>life</b> span in {{a variety}} of species including mammals, flies, nematodes, and yeast. Despite the importance of this nearly universal effect, little is understood about the molecular mechanisms that mediate the life-span-extending effect of calorie restriction in metazoans. Sir 2 is known to be involved in life span determination and calorie restriction in yeast mother cells. In nematodes increased Sir 2 can <b>extend</b> <b>life</b> span, but a direct link to calorie restriction has not been demonstrated. We now report that Sir 2 is directly involved in the calorie-restriction life-span-extending pathway in Drosophila. We demonstrate that an increase in Drosophila Sir 2 (dSir 2) <b>extends</b> <b>life</b> span, whereas a decrease in dSir 2 blocks the life-span-extending effect of calorie reduction or rpd 3 mutations. These data lead us to propose a genetic pathway by which calorie restriction <b>extends</b> <b>life</b> span and provides a framework for genetic and pharmacological studies of life span extension in metazoans...|$|R

40|$|Activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) {{signaling}} in neurons increases {{stress resistance}} and <b>extends</b> <b>life</b> span, {{in part through}} FOXO-mediated transcription in Drosophila. However, the JNK/FOXO target genes are unknown. Here, we identified Jafrac 1, a Drosophila homolog of human Peroxiredoxin II (hPrxII), as a downstream effecter of JNK/FOXO signaling in neurons that enhances stress resistance and <b>extends</b> <b>life</b> span. We found that Jafrac 1 was expressed in the adult brain and induced by paraquat, a reactive oxygen species-generating chemical. RNA interference-mediated neuronal knockdown of Jafrac 1 enhanced, while neuronal overexpression of Jafrac 1 and hPrxII suppressed, paraquat-induced lethality in flies. Neuronal expression of Jafrac 1 also significantly reduced ROS levels, restored mitochondrial function, and attenuated JNK activation caused by paraquat. Activation of JNK/FOXO signaling in neurons increased the Jafrac 1 expression level under both normal and oxidative stressed conditions. Moreover, neuronal knockdown of Jafrac 1 shortened, while overexpression of Jafrac 1 and hPrxII <b>extended,</b> the <b>life</b> span in flies.

2500|$|To {{meet the}} {{reliability}} {{requirements of the}} 1951 US digital computer Whirlwind, [...] "special-quality" [...] tubes with <b>extended</b> <b>life,</b> and a long-lasting cathode in particular, were produced. The problem of short lifetime was traced to evaporation of silicon, used in the tungsten alloy to make the heater wire easier to draw. Elimination of silicon from the heater wire alloy (and more frequent replacement of the wire drawing dies) allowed production of tubes that were reliable enough for the Whirlwind project. The tubes developed for Whirlwind were later used in the giant SAGE air-defense computer system. SAGE computers were dual installations, with one operating, {{and the other in}} standby. To locate potential tube failures in the standby computer, heater voltages were reduced, which caused failures of tubes which would otherwise fail in service. These computers continued in service years after other tube computers had been superseded.|$|E

40|$|Calorie {{restriction}} (CR) <b>extends</b> <b>life</b> span in {{many different}} organisms, including mammals. We describe here a novel pathway that <b>extends</b> the <b>life</b> span of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mother cells but does not involve a reduction in caloric content of the media, i. e., there is growth of yeast cells {{in the presence of}} a high concentration of external osmolytes. Like CR, this longevity-promoting response to high osmolarity requires SIR 2, suggesting a common mechanism of life span regulation. Genetic and microarray analysis indicates that high osmolarity <b>extends</b> the <b>life</b> span by activating Hog 1 p, leading to an increase in the biosynthesis of glycerol from glycolytic intermediates. This metabolic shift likely increases NAD levels, thereby activating Sir 2 p and promoting longevity. Environmental factors, such as the availability of nutrients, can have a dramatic effect on life span (e. g., see references 16, 22, 25, 30, and 37). Calorie restriction (CR) <b>extends</b> <b>life</b> span in many organisms, including rodents (29, 44), the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (22), and mother cells of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (26).

40|$|Recent {{studies suggest}} that {{increased}} mitochondrial metabolism and the concomitant decrease in NADH levels mediate calorie restriction (CR) -induced life span extension. The mitochondrial inner membrane is impermeable to NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, oxidized form) and NADH, and {{it is unclear how}} CR relays increased mitochondrial metabolism to multiple cellular pathways that reside in spatially distinct compartments. Here we show that the mitochondrial components of the malate–aspartate NADH shuttle (Mdh 1 [malate dehydrogenase] and Aat 1 [aspartate amino transferase]) and the glycerol- 3 -phosphate shuttle (Gut 2, glycerol- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase) are novel longevity factors in the CR pathway in yeast. Overexpressing Mdh 1, Aat 1, and Gut 2 <b>extend</b> <b>life</b> span and do not synergize with CR. Mdh 1 and Aat 1 overexpressions require both respiration and the Sir 2 family to <b>extend</b> <b>life</b> span. The mdh 1 Δaat 1 Δ double mutation blocks CR-mediated life span extension and also prevents the characteristic decrease in the NADH levels in the cytosolic/nuclear pool, suggesting that the malate–aspartate shuttle {{plays a major role in}} the activation of the downstream targets of CR such as Sir 2. Overexpression of the NADH shuttles may also <b>extend</b> <b>life</b> span by increasing the metabolic fitness of the cells. Together, these data suggest that CR may <b>extend</b> <b>life</b> span and ameliorate age-associated metabolic diseases by activating components of the NADH shuttles...|$|R
