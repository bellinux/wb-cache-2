60|$|From the {{foregoing}} twenty-seven illegitimate plants, fertilised with their own- form pollen, twenty-five seedling grandchildren were raised; {{and these were}} all long-styled; so that from the two illegitimate generations fifty-two plants were raised, and all without exception proved long-styled. These grandchildren grew vigorously, and soon exceeded in height two other lots of illegitimate seedlings of different parentage and one lot of equal-styled seedlings presently to be described. Hence I expected {{that they would have}} turned out highly ornamental plants; but when they flowered, they seemed, as my gardener remarked, to have gone back to the wild state; for the petals were pale-coloured, narrow, sometimes not touching each other, flat, generally deeply notched in the middle, but not flexuous on the margin, and with the yellow eye or centre conspicuous. Altogether these flowers were strikingly different from those of their progenitors; and this I think, can only be accounted for on the principle of reversion. Most of the anthers on one plant were contabescent. Seventeen flowers on the grandchildren were illegitimately fertilised with pollen taken from other seedlings of the same lot, and produced fourteen capsules, containing on an average 29.2 seeds; but they ought to have contained about 35 seeds. Fifteen flowers legitimately fertilised with pollen from an illegitimate short-styled plant (belonging to the lot next to be described) produced fourteen capsules, containing an average of 46 seeds; they ought to have contained at least 50 seeds. Hence these grandchildren of <b>illegitimate</b> <b>descent</b> appear to have lost, though only in a very slight degree, their full fertility.|$|E
50|$|Possibly, {{however, the}} family may be canonically legitimate, {{in which case}} {{it is the most}} senior extant male-line branch of the Capetians, and senior to the Bourbons which reign today in Spain and Luxembourg and have in the past ruled France, Naples and Sicily, {{as well as to the}} House of Braganza, also Capetians by <b>illegitimate</b> <b>descent.</b>|$|E

50|$|According to American genealogist Gary Boyd Roberts, {{an expert}} on royal descent, most Americans with {{significant}} New England Yankee, Mid-Atlantic Quaker, or Southern planter ancestry are descended from medieval kings, especially those of England, Scotland, and France. William Addams Reitwiesner documented many U.S. descendants of Renaissance and modern monarchs. Some Americans may have royal descents through German immigrants who had an <b>illegitimate</b> <b>descent</b> from German royalty.|$|E
50|$|Afonso de Albuquerque {{was born}} in 1453 in Alhandra, near Lisbon. He was the second son of Gonçalo de Albuquerque, Lord of Vila Verde dos Francos, and Dona Leonor de Menezes. His father held an {{important}} position at court and was connected by remote <b>illegitimate</b> <b>descent</b> with the Portuguese monarchy. He was educated in mathematics and Latin at the court of Afonso V of Portugal, where he befriended Prince John, the future King John II of Portugal.|$|E
5000|$|Henry's {{main claim}} to the English throne derived from his mother through the House of Beaufort. Henry's mother, Lady Margaret Beaufort, was a {{great-granddaughter}} of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, fourth son of Edward III, and his third wife Katherine Swynford. Katherine was Gaunt's mistress for about 25 years; when they married in 1396, they already had four children, including Henry's great-grandfather John Beaufort. Thus Henry's claim was somewhat tenuous: it was from a woman, and by <b>illegitimate</b> <b>descent.</b> In theory, the Portuguese and Castilian royal families had a better claim (as far as [...] "legitimacy" [...] is concerned) as descendants of Catherine of Lancaster, the daughter of John of Gaunt and his second wife Constance of Castile.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose a new {{understanding}} of the relationship between Nero and the young freedman Sporus whom he apparently 2 ̆ 7 married 2 ̆ 7 sometime during his tour of Greece in AD 66 - 67. Dio claims that Nero treated Sporus as he did because of his resemblance to his wife Poppaea Sabina whom he had accidentally killed in AD 65. I conclude that the marriage of Nero to Sporus had nothing to do with love, and probably little to do with lust either. It was not some form of prototype 2 ̆ 7 gay marriage 2 ̆ 7. It had been intended simply to humiliate a potential rival for the throne through the use of sexual violence against him. Nero seems to have come to believe that Sporus was of <b>illegitimate</b> imperial <b>descent,</b> and represented a potential threat to his position; and who deserved to be humiliated and prevented from furthering his illegitimate line, if not eventually killed also...|$|R
5000|$|Like their Beaufort relatives, the Barons of Raglan can boast an {{unbroken}} line of male (but <b>illegitimate)</b> <b>descent</b> from Henry II and the earliest Plantagenets. The family seat is Cefntilla Court, Llandenny in Monmouthshire. An inscription over the porch dated 1858 reads: [...] "This house with 238 {{acres of land}} was purchased by 1623 of the friends, admirers and comrades in arms of the late Field Marshal Lord Raglan GCB and presented by them to his son and his heirs for ever in a lasting memorial of affectionate regard and respect". Memorials {{to a number of}} members of the Raglan branch of the Somerset family can be seen in St John's Church, the parish church of Llandenny.|$|E
50|$|Inês was {{the natural}} {{daughter}} of Pedro Fernández de Castro, Lord of Lemos and Sarria and his noble Portuguese mistress Aldonça Lourenço de Valadares. Her family descended {{both from the}} Galician and Portuguese nobilities. She was also well connected to the Castilian royal family, by <b>illegitimate</b> <b>descent.</b> Her stepmother was Infanta Beatrix of Portugal, the youngest daughter of Afonso of Portugal, Lord of Portalegre and Violante Manuel. Her grandmother was Violante Sánchez de Castile, Lady of Uzero, the illegitimate daughter of Sancho IV of Castile. Her great-great grandfather was Rodrigo Alfonso de León, Lord of Aliger, the illegitimate son of Alfonso IX of León. She was also legitimately descended from Infanta Sancha Henriques of Portugal, the daughter of Henry, Count of Portugal.|$|E
5000|$|Due to primogeniture, many colonists of high {{social status}} were younger {{children}} of English aristocratic families {{who came to}} America looking for land because, since given their birth order they could not inherit. Many of these immigrants initially enjoyed high standing where they settled. They could often claim royal descent through a female line or <b>illegitimate</b> <b>descent.</b> Some Americans descend from these 17th-century British colonists who had royal descent. There were at least 650 colonists with traceable royal ancestry, and 387 of them left descendants in America (almost always numbering many thousands, and some {{as many as one}} million). These colonists with royal descent settled in various states, but a large majority in Massachusetts or Virginia. Several families which settled in those states, over the two hundred years or more since the colonial land grants, intertwined their branches to the point that almost everyone was somehow related to everyone else. As one writer observed, [...] "like a tangle of fish hooks".|$|E
