40|$|Under a {{constant}} applied load, {{the operation of}} a typical elastohydrodynamic lubrication involves three stages, namely the start up stage, the normal steady state operation stage and the shut down stage. Previous works focused on the second normal steady state operation stage, in which a continuous lubricant film is separating the contacting surfaces. This dissertation numerically and analytically studies the lubrication behavior in the start up and shut down stages of elastohydrodynamic lubrication operations. ^ A mixed phase lubricated-solid contact model is developed to study the start up stage and demonstrates {{the transition from the}} initial solid to solid contact, to the mixed lubricated-solid contact, and finally to the fully lubricated contact. A surface temperature model is developed to calculate the surface temperature rise in the start up process of circular contact in sliding conditions. Because of the solid contact occurring during this process, significant frictional heat is generated and the surface temperature rise is very high. ^ The shut down process of elastohydrodynamic lubrication operation is studied and the numerical results are compared with the experimental results. Because of the characteristics of EHL flow, analytical expressions are derived to predict the pressure and film thickness changes during the shut down process and these predictions agree well with the numerical results. ^ Surface pocket effects in line contact start up condition are then examined in an effort to achieve beneficial tribological performance through surface modification. In the initial static contact situation, lubricant trapped inside the pocket generates hydrostatic pressure and reduces the pressure spikes and subsurface stresses, compared with the dry contact situation. When the surfaces start to move, this hydrostatic pressure enables a pocket lubricant <b>film</b> <b>build</b> <b>up</b> in addition to the inlet lubricant <b>film</b> <b>build</b> <b>up.</b> Essentially the start up process is divided into two parallel micro-EHL start ups. The start up time is reduced and the solid contact vanishes faster than the smooth surface start up. As a result, the frictional heat in the start up process would be much smaller and subsequently the surface temperature rise would be much reduced, compared with the smooth surface start up condition. ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the {{start-up}} process of line contact elastohydrodynamic lubrication with a stationary central surface pocket is studied. The {{solution of the}} pressure profile and film thickness distribution in the contact area is achieved by using a mixed lubricated-solid contact model. The mass balance of pocket lubricant flow is enforced by using a simple algorithm which adjusts the pocket cavitation boundary. With the surface pocket {{in the center of}} contact, the Hertzian contact area is divided into two micro-EHL contacts: the inlet micro-EHL contact and the outlet micro-EHL contact. The amount of lubricant trapped inside the pocket determines the overall start-up behavior. If the lubricant trapped is less than a critical amount, the two micro-EHL contact would be in start-up condition in serial: the lubricant <b>film</b> <b>builds</b> <b>up</b> in the inlet micro-EHL contact area first and then the lubricant <b>film</b> <b>builds</b> <b>up</b> in the outlet micro-EHL contact after the inlet lubricant flow fills the pocket. The start-up time in this case is longer than {{the start-up}} time for smooth surface start-up. If the lubricant trapped is more than the critical amount, the two micro-EHL contact would be in start-up condition in parallel: a lubricant <b>film</b> <b>builds</b> <b>up</b> in the inlet micro-EHL contact {{and at the same time}} a lubricant <b>film</b> <b>builds</b> <b>up</b> in the outlet micro-EHL contact. The start-up time in this case is much smaller than that of the smooth surface start-up. Compared with the smooth surface start-up condition, because the solid contact vanishes faster, there would be less frictional heat generated in the contact area and thus the surface temperature rise during the start-up process would be much smaller. These effects could prove beneficial in applications with frequent start and stop or oscillating running conditions, in which direct solid to solid contact occurs at the start (restart) of motion...|$|R

The feasibility to construct films by sequential adsorption of PVA-g-ODLA and PVA-g-OLLA graft copolymers is undertaken through the exploitation of two different film deposition techniques, namely dip-and spin-assisted processes. For both deposition methods, infrared spectroscopy in ATR mode reveals a progressive accumulation of matter on the flat substrate during the successive cycle depositions and proves that co-crystallisation involving the two homochiral copolymers is the main driving force for the step by step <b>film</b> <b>build</b> <b>up.</b> Also, {{the effect of the}} deposition technique is assessed on the film features in terms of (i) growth mechanism, (ii) internal organization and (iii) surface topology.

40|$|Crosslinked {{materials}} {{formed by}} the polymerization of acrylate and methacrylate based coatings are used in many commercially applications like coatings, photonics or dental restorative materials. These systems are characterized by great flexibility in manufacturing. They can be polymerized under varying conditions, at different temperature and using thermal or UV radiation to start the polymerization reaction. Main advantage in using UV radiation to initiate the chain reaction lies in the very high polymerization rates that can be reached under intense illumination, so that the liquid to solid phase change takes place within a fraction of second. Another distinct feature of light-induced reactions is that the polymerization will occur only in the illuminated areas, thus allowing complex relief pattern to be produced after solvent development. Consequently, photoinitiated polymerization of multifunctional monomers, or UV-radiation curing, has found {{a large number of}} applications in various industrial sectors. This technology is now commonly utilised to perform the fast drying of protective coatings, varnishes, printing inks and adhesive, and to produce the high-definition images required in the manufacture of microcircuits and printing plates. Besides its great speed having spatial resolution, radiation curing presents a number of other advantages, in particular ambient temperature operations, solvent-free formulations, low energy consumption and the production of polymer materials having tailor-made properties. The printing industry represents, besides the chemical industry, the segment of major use for the UV curable coatings. The reason of using UV curable systems as alternative to the solvent-based coatings are their improved physical properties like brilliance, abrasion resistance, chemical resistance, adhesion to the substrate. Those systems are employed, because of their economical and environmental advantages by many products from packaging to newspapers and credit cards. The lack of solvent in the formulation of UV curable coatings avoids the emission of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and makes them environmentally friendly. Using UV curable systems it is possible to obtain very thin films with high density and in the meantime to realize a substantial cost reduction by saving material. Furthermore the UV cure is a very fast process which means reduction of manufacturing cycle time and increasing productivity. The polymer <b>film</b> <b>build</b> <b>up</b> through the curing process should be harmless for the consumer health. This request is very strict by the food packaging coatings. EU Regulation 1935 / 2004 requires that food packaging must not transfer any components onto the packed foodstuff in quantities that could endanger human health, alter its composition or bring about deterioration in the organoleptic properties of the foodstuff. As consequence, no substance is allowed to transfer from substrates or coating film to the packaged food in quantities that exceed the legal limits. The transfer of unalloyed substances is known as migration and occurs by the decomposition products of photoinitiators and non-reacted photoinitiators, residual monomers unreacted in the coating film or into the substrate or by an incomplete photopolymerization reaction due to an inappropriate cure. The practice learned that rest of photoinitiators and an inadequate cure represents the most commonly cause of migration. Part of the project and aim of this work was the development of a new, cost reduced, analytical method to investigate the photopolymerization process in UV curable coatings and clear coatings. The basic measurement principle is {{based on the idea that}} a variation in the viscoelastic properties of the material, due to crosslinking, causes changes in the vibration modes, specifically in the resonant frequency of the material exposed to a vibration motion. The remote material excitation was generated through a low frequency signal which was selected for its good propagation capabilities among various materials and for the simple equipment required to generate the signal itself. The arrangement was divided into two main parts, acoustic vibration excitation and acoustic vibration detection. The acoustic vibration excitation system consists in a loudspeaker connected to a function generator and a sample holder specifically designed for this purpose. The detection system consists of a laser beam and a photodiode as signal receiver unit. This arrangement was used to study two different modes: the damped, freely vibration mode and the forced vibration mode of the coatings. For each mode we employed a for this purpose developed software program to evaluate the collected data. Ziel dieser Arbeit war die Entwicklung einer neuen, kostenreduzierten, analytischen Methode, um den Photopolymerisationsprozess in den UV härtbaren Lacken und Farben zu messen bzw. zu beobachten.

40|$|When a {{concentrated}} contact is lubricated {{at low speed}} by an oil-in-water emulsion, a film of pure oil typically separates the surfaces (Stage 1). At higher speeds, starvation occurs (Stage 2) and the film is thinner than would be expected if lubricated by neat oil. However, at the very highest speeds, film thickness increases again (Stage 3), though little is known for certain about either the film composition or the mechanism of lubrication, despite some theoretical speculation. In this paper, we report the film thickness in a ball-on-flat contact, lubricated by an oil-in-water emulsion, at speeds of up to 20 m/s, measured using a new high-speed test rig. We also investigated the sliding traction and the phase composition of the film, using fluorescent and infrared microscopy techniques.

40|$|The {{appearance}} of powder-coated films {{is dependent upon}} powder chemistry and spraying parameters. One {{of the most important}} physical factors controlling the powder film appearance is the microdeposition of the powder particles on the grounded substrate. During the electrostatic deposition of powder, the formation of dendrites and agglomerates was observed; these formations have an adverse effect on the final film appearance and their elimination may result in smoother and glossier films. Dendrites are generated due to bipolar charging and inter-particulate electrostatic attractive forces. The corona charging technique is mostly used in industrial powder coating applications. At low corona voltages (- 40 to - 60 kV) a greater degree of bipolar charging was observed compared to that at higher voltages (- 80 to - 100 kV). At the higher voltages, the increase n number of ions produces a more unipolar charging and higher charge-to-mass ratios. As the <b>film</b> <b>builds</b> <b>up,</b> the powder transfer efficiency decreases as the repulsion forces between oncoming charged particles and the already deposited powder layer increase. By controlling the deposition patterns, the final film appearance can be improved. The smoothest films were obtained when the voltage was ramped from - 60 to - 100 kV. Another method to reduce dendrite formations was to deposit powder particles charged unipolarly by first separating them from the oppositely charged ones by using a charge separator...|$|R

A formulated lubricant containing ester, and hexadecane containing 0, 0. 05 and 0. 5 % stearic acid, are used as lubricants. The friction factor is measured {{for a wide variety}} of process conditions and correlated with surface analysis techniques including ToF-SIMS (time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy). The roughness of the tool is clearly seen imprinted on the strip, indicating that any hydrodynamic or hydrostatic film separating the tool and strip is very small. With clean tools and longitudinal strip roughness, the friction stress equals the shear yield stress of the metal. For transverse strip roughness, hydrodynamic or hydrostatic effects lead to a reduced friction factor. With these cleaned tools there is no effect of additive concentration.

40|$|One {{solution}} for providing a truly independent power source is to package, within the critical subsystem element, a primary battery that can remain dormant for time periods {{as long as}} the mission life, which can be 10 - 15 years, maximum. When primary power from the spacecraft solar array/battery system is interrupted, the backup battery system, which is connected through a diode to the power input line, would automatically support the load to avoid a power interruption to the critical load for a time period long enough to ensure that ground control could access the satellite and correct the anomaly by sending appropriate commands to the spacecraft. Critical subsystems identified for the application are telemetry and command circuits, volatile computer memory, attitude control circuits, and some critical payloads. Due to volume packaging and weight restrictions that exist on most spacecraft, coupled with the long storage periods required, lithium cell technology was selected for the backup power source. Because of the high energy density (200 - 400 Wh/kg), long shelf life, and load capability, soluble cathode primary lithium technology was chosen.

I don't do drugs or liquor, so I used the (<b>film)</b> {{business}} to <b>build</b> <b>up</b> my name, so I could charge more money on the side in my escort service." [...] His earnings were invested in a solar installation company, and in time parlayed into a partnership with fellow skin star Ron Pearson to found Pegasus Productions. The partnership produced only one film, Pegasus which featured the founders. By the late 1980s, Cooper made fewer films and concentrated most of his energy on a health food store in West Hollywood. It was during {{this time he was}} diagnosed HIV+, and he commented thus: [...] "I'm in a business now that's health oriented. We're an AIDS support group, promote safe sex, and are here to try and give something back to the community and help people who are HIV+ or have AIDS. So I can't be involved in unsafe sex in front of a camera, because that says it's okay. It would make me look like a hypocrite." ...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{proposes a}} {{comparative}} textual research on Hungarian and Romanian cinema {{by setting up}} a model that informs the implicit cinematic reflection on socialism in film. By establishing two aesthetic categories – horizontal and vertical enclosure –, the thesis argues that the spatial structure of the narratives reveals and alludes to the oppressive policy of the Hungarian and Romanian socialist regimes. The {{first part of the}} research scrutinises the space in Romanian cinema, and investigates the birth of the vertical enclosure. The analysis focuses on the spatial representation of Bucharest, that is the claustrophobic illustration of the urban landscape and its space depicted by the tools of notorious surveillance on screen. As argued in the thesis, the architectural forms and their <b>film</b> representations <b>build</b> <b>up</b> a spatial constellation identical to Bentham’s Panopticon discussed by Michel Foucault. The second part of the investigation concentrates on Hungarian cinema and the evolution of horizontal enclosure in film. Through textual analysis of the selected films that are set on the Great Hungarian Plain, the thesis discusses the allegorical use of space during and after socialism. Therefore, while concentrating on the circularity of the location and the mise-en-scène of the films – that refer to the isolation and indefiniteness of space – the author argues that the directors recall the parabolic language of the cinematic corpus of the socialist epoch. As concluded by the work, the contemporary art cinema of Romania and Hungary both reference socialism by using space as the main device for the implicit textual reflections. In this way, horizontal and vertical enclosure also emphasise the revival of the forms of the socialist aesthetics...|$|R
40|$|Steady state {{polarization}} {{curves and}} electrode impedances were measured during the active/passive transition of type {{304 stainless steel}} in dearated ethanolic solution containing hydrogen chloride and different amounts of water. The passivation potential and the critical current density for passivation strongly depend on the water content of the solution. The impedance measurements in the active/passive transition show the same sequence of diagrams independent of the water content of the solution. They indicate the onset of passivation before the maximum current density and show two time constants related to two different passivating species on the alloy surface. The experimental results were interpreted {{on the basis of}} a reaction model with parallel dissolution and passivation mechanism of the iron and the chromium compound of the alloy. The resulting total surface composition (related to the steady-state polarization curves) can be described with a reaction model of iron–the alloy behaviour is that of pure metal. The fundamental passivation reaction is described as a potential dependent equilibrium between adsorbed Me(II) - and passivating Me(III) -hydroxide, water molecules being directly involved in the formation of this primary passivating film. In the case of stainless steel this primary passivating film mainly consists of chromium (III) adsorbates. Finally, a general model for the passivation is proposed: The passivation of a pure metal or of an alloy can be understood as the coupling of the stepwise deprotonation of the water molecules at the interface metal/solution and the formation of a high cation charge density in this adsorbed hydroxide/oxide <b>film</b> to <b>build</b> <b>up</b> the passive layer. The effect of water content, pH, adding of passivating species to the solution or the alloying with chromium on the passivation potential and the critical current density thus can be explained...|$|R

50|$|During {{production}} on An American Tail, Morris Sullivan drew {{plans to move}} {{the majority of the}} studios operations to Ireland {{to take advantage of a}} scheme set up by the Industrial Development Authority encouraging filmmakers to invest in the country by offering grants, tax benefits and lower operating costs. Difficulties with American trade unions that arose when Bluth offered his employees wages below union rates during the financially tense production of An American Tail may also have influenced the decision to relocate. The IDA offered Sullivan Bluth Studios the largest grant in the countrys history to relocate to Dublin, in return for a 5% government ownership of the studio. This, along with Sullivans own investment, funded the foundation of a large and sophisticated new animation studio near Dublins Phoenix Park. The studio opened with a staff of 85, mostly handling the ink-and-paint process, but expanded to employ over 300 people, including some 100 staff relocated from the California studio, and to cover all aspects of the animation process and even <b>film</b> processing. To <b>build</b> <b>up</b> this workforce, the studio brought young Irish people to the USA studio to train, and Bluth helped to set up an animation course at the nearby Ballyfermot Senior College. Despite the majority of operations eventually being moved to the Dublin studio, an executive office was retained in Burbank, California to maintain ties with US producers and distributors.|$|R
