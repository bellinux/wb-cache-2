25|$|The {{combination}} of composite waves with short fundamental frequencies and shared or closely related partials is what causes {{the sensation of}} harmony. When two frequencies are near to a simple fraction, but not exact, the composite wave cycles slowly <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the cancellation of the waves as a steady pulsing instead of a tone. This is called beating, and is considered unpleasant, or dissonant.|$|E
25|$|The {{fennec fox}} or fennec (Vulpes zerda) {{is a small}} nocturnal fox found in the Sahara of North Africa. Its most {{distinctive}} feature is its unusually large ears, which also serve to dissipate heat. Its name comes from the Arabic word فنك (fanak), which means fox, and the species name zerda comes from the Greek word xeros which means dry, referring to the fox's habitat. The fennec is the smallest species of canid. Its coat, ears, and kidney functions have adapted to high-temperature, low-water, desert environments. In addition, its hearing is sensitive <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> prey moving underground. It mainly eats insects, small mammals, and birds.|$|E
500|$|Lieutenant-General Govorov {{ordered a}} {{bombardment}} of German artillery positions {{in advance of}} the concert in a special operation, code-named [...] "Squall". Soviet intelligence personnel had located the German batteries and observation posts a few weeks before, in preparation for the attack. Three thousand high-calibre shells were lobbed onto the enemy. The purpose of the operation was to prevent the Germans from targeting the concert hall and to ensure that it would be quiet <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the music over speakers he ordered to be set up. He also encouraged Soviet soldiers to listen to the concert via radio. Musicologist Andrei Krukov later praised Govorov's actions as providing the [...] "incentive" [...] for the concert, adding that his choice to allow soldiers to participate was [...] "a quite exceptional decision". Govorov himself later remarked to Eliasberg that [...] "we played our instrument in the symphony, too, you know," [...] in reference to the artillery fire. The military contribution to the affair was not widely known until well after the war ended.|$|E

500|$|During {{the early}} part of the fighting, Colonel Powell was accidentally shot in the back from {{friendly}} fire. The 2nd West Virginia Cavalry, without its two highest-ranking officers (Powell and Hoffman), became disorganized. A portion of the cavalry was trapped in the open against shooters protected by buildings, and many dismounted either for their own safety or because their horse had been shot. At that time, Colonel Toland hurried forward to run the leaderless dismounted cavalry. [...] Freeman and the infantry were already further south in town. The cavalry believed their behavior was appropriate for the situation, and advised Colonel Toland to act in a similar manner. Toland, still on his horse, became an easy target for shooters from a nearby two-story brick house. Despite warnings from the cavalry's Company H that he should take cover, Toland refused to dismount—saying [...] "the bullet that can kill me has not been made". He was shot through the heart immediately after his exclamation. This happened early in the fighting, and men from the 2nd West Virginia's Company H were close <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the bullet strike him. Thus, both colonels were eliminated from the fighting during the first 10 minutes.|$|E
500|$|The {{areas around}} Malvern Hill hosted much of Lee's army {{the night after}} the battle. Some of the Confederates were close <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the sounds made by the Army of the Potomac {{retreating}} under cover of darkness, and see the lanterns of Northerners helping their wounded. The day after the Battle of Malvern Hill, Lee and Stonewall Jackson met President Jefferson Davis at Poindexter farm. They considered immediately pursuing McClellan; however, {{in view of the}} rain and confusion, Davis and Lee deemed large-scale pursuit of McClellan's army too risky. Jackson disagreed, saying, [...] "They have not all got away if we go immediately after them." [...] Jackson even had the bodies of the dead moved so that his soldiers had a clear line of attack when pursuing McClellan. However, Davis and Lee thought it necessary to rest the army. They did not completely rule out a pursuit though; Lee even ordered J. E. B. Stuart to reconnoiter McClellan's position for future attacks. Lee ordered Theophilus Holmes to move to Drewry's Bluff, and decided to keep the men on Malvern Hill through July 3 to forestall any potential Union attack against that location.|$|E
500|$|The Atlantic Records studio {{had just}} {{purchased}} an 8-track recorder, and recording engineer Tom Dowd was familiarizing himself with how it worked. In February 1959 Charles and his orchestra finally recorded [...] "What'd I Say" [...] at Atlantic's small studio. Dowd recalled {{that it did}} not seem special at the time of recording. It was second of two songs during the session and Charles, the producers, and the band were more impressed with the first one at the session, [...] "Tell the Truth": [...] "We made it like we made all the others. Ray, the gals, and the band live in the small studio, no overdubs. Three or four takes, and it was done. Next!" [...] In retrospect, Ahmet Ertegun's brother Nesuhi credits the extraordinary sound of the song to the restricted size of the studio and the technologically advanced recording equipment used; the sound quality is clear <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> Charles slapping his leg in time with the song when the music stops during the calls and responses. The song was recorded in only a few takes because Charles and the orchestra had perfected it while touring.|$|E

500|$|Alexis Petridis from The Guardian lauded Shakira's originality, opining that [...] "In {{an age of}} personality-free pop idols, Shakira's glorious {{eccentricity}} {{makes her}} a true star," [...] and commented that [...] "Every song contains at least one non sequitur so eccentric {{that it could be}} the work of 1970s rock surrealist Captain Beefheart" [...] and [...] "The music on Laundry Service gives the lyrics a run for their money in the oddball handicap." [...] Although he felt that the use of samples on various songs [...] "displays an attitude to plagiarism that Noel Gallagher would consider cavalier" [...] and that [...] "no one could claim Laundry Service was a groundbreaking work of art," [...] he concluded that [...] "its ramshackle production and imponderable lyrics are striking and unique. And these days, it's hard not to find any pop record that provokes those adjectives rather cheering." [...] Music critic Robert Christgau termed Laundry Service [...] "the Cher album Cher never made" [...] and attributed this to Shakira's blend of Middle Eastern styles in her music; he commented that the [...] "stylistic appetite of this Colombian superstar is pure rock en Español" [...] and appreciated Shakira's confident songwriting. Christgau also noted Shakira's strong vibrato and constant changing of timbre in her vocals. Lisa Oliver from Yahoo! Music said that Shakira's experimentation with different styles yield [...] "results ranging from corking to minging," [...] but experienced difficulty with the formatting of the CD, saying [...] "the biggest problem with 'Laundry Service' is the anti-copying device that renders the CD useless in anything other than a conventional CD player [...] A shame then, because this Latino hottie could dilate the musical pupils of even the most ardent homebody if only they could get off the computer long <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> it." ...|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from August 6, 1910. It states: [...] "Mr. Jenks {{and his family are}} spending the summer in a fashionable summer hotel, and Mr. Jenks is kept bored and busy performing the many services demanded by his wife. He hits upon the bright idea of sending himself a business telegram which would necessitate his immediate presence in the city, then starts out on a little vacation on his own account. Walking on the beach he discovers a secluded spot, and leaving his clothes on the beach he takes a swim. In the meantime, a convict, who has escaped from a nearby penitentiary, has entered a house nearby in search of a change of clothes, his stripes being too conspicuous. The convict locks a woman of the house up and ransacks the house, but the only garments he can find are women's clothes, and, deciding that they are better than stripes, he dons them. As the convict in his new disguise is walking along the beach he sees Jenks' clothes lying there and promptly makes another change. There is nothing for Jenks to do when he comes out except to array himself as a woman. On {{his way back to the}} hotel he passes the house that has been robbed and is unlucky <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the woman's cry for help. When she gets out of the closet, through his aid, she naturally believes that he is the convict, and screams for help. Jenks, frightened, runs away, but is captured after a chase in which the entire village takes part. His wife and daughter witness humiliation, and it's almost impossible for them to 'square things.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|The coat {{is often}} a cream color and fluffy, which {{deflects}} heat {{during the day and}} keeps the fox warm at night.

2500|$|The news of her brother-in-law's {{death had}} not yet reached England when, in early November, the {{pregnant}} Duchess was thrown from her carriage. The trauma induced the premature birth of a son named John, possibly in Cheam. His baptism was registered on 6 November, but he died within a day and was buried in Chenies on 11 November.

2500|$|The {{theological}} {{beliefs of}} Quaker yearly meetings vary considerably. Tolerance of dissent widely varies among yearly meetings. Most Friends believe in continuing revelation, {{which is the}} religious belief that truth is continuously revealed directly to individuals from God. George Fox, an [...] "early Friend", described it as [...] "Christ has come to teach His people Himself." [...] Friends often focus on trying to hear God. As Isaac Penington wrote in 1670, [...] "It is not <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> of Christ, or read of Christ, {{but this is the}} thing—to feel him to be my root, my life, and my foundation..." [...] Quakers reject the idea of priests, believing in the priesthood of all believers. Some Friends express their concept of God using various phrases including the inner light, or inward light of Christ, the Holy Spirit or other phrases.|$|E

[...] Opera director Sandro Sequi, who witnessed many Callas performances close-up, states, [...] "For me, she was extremely stylized and classic, yet at the same time, human—but humanity on a higher plane of existence, almost sublime. Realism was foreign to her, and that is why she was the greatest of opera singers. After all, opera is the least realistic of theater forms... She was wasted in verismo roles, even Tosca, no matter how brilliantly she could act such roles." [...] Scott adds, [...] "Early nineteenth-century opera... is not merely the antithesis of reality, it also requires highly stylized acting. Callas had the perfect face for it. Her big features matched its grandiloquence and spoke volumes from a distance." ...|$|E

2500|$|On July 2, 1778, Lee was court-martialled at Brunswick, New Jersey {{by a jury}} presided by Lord Stirling {{on three}} charges: 1. disobedience of orders in not attacking the enemy; 2. misbehavior before the enemy in making an unnecessary, disorderly, and shameful retreat; 3. disrespect to the commander-in-chief.
