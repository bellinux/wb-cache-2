40|$|Abstract. — The {{build up}} of the rainy season in Mali spreads over a period that varies {{according}} to the years and during which the rainy spells are uncertain and rather scattered. In 1962, the precipitations have developed very irregularly both in time and space. As a matter of fact, Mali happened to be {{for a long time}} in the oscillation zone of the <b>Intertropical</b> <b>Front.</b> Most rains have issued from tornados. These disturbances, the violence of which lessens as the <b>Intertropical</b> <b>Front</b> travels Northward, seem to be bound with the mobility of the front activated by the surges of the Monsoon. Their frequency and the activity of the Squall Line which accompanies them determine the characteristics of this intermediate period, concerning the volume and distribution of the precipitations as well as the distribution of temperature.

40|$|International audienceEmpirical {{studies have}} shown that warm El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) episodes are {{associated}} during northern summer with, first, a southward location of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) over the tropical Atlantic, and, second, a weakened convection over West Africa where the ITCZ is near its mean latitude. A modelling experiment presented here is used to help explain this apparent contradiction. In simulated ENSO conditions, the ITCZ is located southwards over the tropical Atlantic. Over West Africa the <b>intertropical</b> <b>front</b> is also displaced southwards, but more slightly; the ITCZ is located at its climatological latitude and the vertical development of convective clouds over West and Central Africa is reduced due to dynamical subsidence in the upper levels...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} the results of co-ordinated research flights over the Saharan heat-low, conducted during July 2006 as part of the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis (AMMA) Special Observing Periods. The flights consisted of a morning transect on 14 July 2006 with the Falcon F 20 aircraft of the Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR), using the Doppler lidar WIND to observe the tropospheric winds, followed by an afternoon flight on 17 July with the BAe 146 aircraft of the Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements (FAAM) releasing a curtain of 16 dropsondes. Measurements from radiosondes at the Algerian stations of Tamanrasset and In Salah, as well as the CALIPSO spaceborne lidar, are analysed also. It is shown that the daytime Saharan atmospheric boundary layer exhibits a remarkable split structure, with a well-mixed convective layer lying beneath a residual layer whose dynamics appear to be more nearly laminar. Observations from Saharan radiosonde stations confirm that the Saharan residual boundary layer is, on some days, a persistent rather than a transient feature, and that on occasion the residual layer can last right through the day. The broad features of the Saharan heat-low thermodynamics and winds are successfully captured by the ECMWF operational analyses and the discrepancies are quantified here. The lidar winds of 14 July confirm that the analysis re{{presents the}} main airflows accurately, apart from the zone to the southeast of a mid-level trough, for which the southerly component of winds was underestimated by some 8 m s- 1. On 17 July, the strengths of both the southwesterly monsoon and the northeasterly Harmattan winds were slightly underestimated also. The region of maximum boundary-layer temperature over the desert was around 1 degree too far north, and too broad in the analysis, while the equivalent potential temperature in the Saharan convective boundary layer was around 2 K lower than observed. The near-saturated layer observed {{at the top of the}} Saharan atmospheric boundary layer was underestimated also in the analysis, in horizontal extent and altitude. The <b>intertropical</b> <b>front</b> of 17 July was coincident with strong surface contrasts in vegetation and fluxes. On each study day the <b>intertropical</b> <b>front</b> in the analyses was around 1 degree further north than observed. Copyright © 2009 Royal Meteorological Societ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: North African {{climate is}} {{analysed}} between 1979 and 2010 {{with an emphasis}} on August using the European Center for Medium-RangeWeather Forecast (ECMWF) global dataset to investigate the effects of the subtropical anticyclones over North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula on the African easterly jet (AEJ). It was found that the AEJ encloses a core with a local wind maximum (LWM) in both West and East Africa, in which the west LWM core has a higher zonal wind speed. The strength of both cores is distinctly different by way of thermal wind balance. As found in previous studies, the AEJ is formed through baroclinicity with influence from Saharan lower level heating along and {{to the north of the}} <b>Intertropical</b> <b>Front</b> (ITF). As there are two separate anticyclonic centres, the AEJ is maintained by the anticyclonic systems in West Africa, East Africa as well as the Arabian Peninsula. The presence of these two anticyclonic centres provides the AEJ with two separate core maxima with the western LWM located at 15 ∘W, 17 ∘N and the eastern LWM located at 35 ∘E, 15 ∘N for August...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis article {{presents}} observations and model simulations of the low-level nocturnal {{structure of the}} atmosphere over West Africa. The measurements are taken from the dry-season Special Observing Period (SOP- 0) of the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis (AMMA), at Niamey, Niger, on 23 and 24 January 2006. During this time, mesoscale structures in the atmospheric aerosol loadings were observed. The available observations indicate that these mesoscale features at Niamey {{are consistent with the}} passage of gravity currents or bores in the northerly Harmattan winds. Model simulations at resolutions down to 1 km indicate that the mesoscale structures are caused by nocturnal frontogenesis in the baroclinic zone to the south of the Sahara in the winter months. This frontogenesis is a continental-scale phenomenon, which has significant implications for the uplift and transport of dust and biomass-burning aerosols in the region. An accompanying frontogenetic feature appears further south in the model simulations, associated with the winter <b>intertropical</b> <b>front.</b> The frontogenesis is possibly linked with the development of structures showing characteristics of canonical mesoscale phenomena, including internal bores and gravity currents. Representation of these features in the UK Met Office Unified Model at different resolutions (from 12 km to 1 km) is discussed...|$|E

Rainfall composites for El Niño and La Niña events were made for each PDO phase, a total of four composites.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the local- and regional-scale thermodynamical and dynamical environments associated with intense convective systems in West Africa during 2003. We identified convective system cases from TRMM microwave imagery, classifying each case {{by the system}} minimum 85 -GHz brightness temperature and by the estimated elapsed time of propagation from high terrain. The speed of the mid-level jet, {{the magnitude of the}} low-level shear, and the surface equivalent potential temperature (theta(sub e)) were greater for the intense cases compared to the non-intense cases, although the differences between the means tended to be small, less than 3 K for surface theta(sub e). Hypothesis testing of a series of commonly used intensity prediction metrics resulted in significant results only for low-level metrics such as convective available potential energy and not for any of the mid- or upper-level metrics such as 700 -hPa theta(sub e). None of the environmental variables or intensity metrics by themselves or in combination appeared to be reliable direct predictors of intensity. In the regional scale analysis, the majority of intense convective systems occurred in the surface baroclinic zone where surface theta(sub e) exceeded 344 K and the 700 -hPa zonal wind speeds were less than - 6 /ms. Fewer intense cases compared to non-intense cases were associated with African easterly wave troughs. Fewer than 25 % of our cases occurred in environments with detectable Saharan dust loads, and the results for intense and non-intense cases were similar.

40|$|Over 100 {{samples of}} recent surface sediments from the bottomn of the Atlantic Ocean {{offshore}} NW Africa between 34 ° and 6 ° N have been analysed palynologically. The {{objective of this}} study was to reveal the relation between source areas, transport systems, and resulting distribution patterns of pollen and spores in marine sediments off NW Africa, in order to lay a sound foundation for the interpretation of pollen records of marine cores from this area. The clear zonation of the NW-African vegetation (due to the distinct climatic gradient) is helpful in determining main source areas, and the presence of some major wind belts facilitates the registration of the average course of wind trajectories. The present circulation pattern is driven by the <b>intertropical</b> <b>front</b> (ITCZ) which shifts over the continent between c. 22 ° N (summer position) and c. 4 ° N (winter position) in the course of the year. Determination of the period of main pollen release and the average atmospheric circulation pattern effective at that time of the years is of prime importance. The distribution patterns in recent marine sediments of pollen of a series of genera and families appear to record climatological/ecological variables, such as the trajectory of the NE trade, January trades, African Easterly Jet (Saharan Air Layer), the northernmost and southernmost position of the intertropical convergence zone, and the extent and latitudinal situation of the NW-African vegetation belt.

40|$|International audienceThe Saharan Atmospheric Boundary Layer (SABL) structure, dynamics, {{thermodynamics}} {{and composition}} over the Central Sahara, associated with several concomittant dust lifting processes observed/modelled on 21 June 2011, {{in the framework}} of the FENNEC 2011 Special Observing period, are analysed. The aerosol optical depth on that day was in excess of 3. On the morning of June 21, dust lifting occurred at the passing of the African Easterly Waves over Mauritania with dust being raised by cold-pools issued from convective systems having developped the previous day. Behind this wave, the harmattan flow was channeled between the Hoggar and the Atlas and also generated dust. The dust production was amplified when this flow experienced further constriction between dusty density currents flowing down the Atlas slopes and an intense monsoon pulse from the west of the Hoggar also generating much dust. Two aircraft (the SAFIRE Falcon and the FAAM BAe 146) operated over Mauritania and Mali on that day enabled to document the complex interactions between the monsoon flow, the <b>intertropical</b> <b>front,</b> the density currents from the Atlas, in the SABL. AROME operational simulations werealso used to analyse how the different air masses have interacted to form the observed complex multi-layer dust structure in the SABL. Afternoon Falcon 20 and BAe 146 flights sampled the growth of the SABL. A clear influence of the cold pool and the dusty layers above can be observed on the developpement of the boundary layer. Finally, two AROME simulations (one with and one without prognostic dust) were used to investigate the influence of the complex dust layers on the dynamics/thermodynamics of the developping convective boundary layer over the Central Sahara...|$|E
40|$|The {{advance and}} retreat of the Sahara Desert are {{repetitive}} in decadal time scale. This climate variability, {{unique in the}} world, results from the irregular motion of the <b>Intertropical</b> <b>Front</b> (ITF), a discontinuity originated from the convergence of two air masses over the African continent. It results from the convergence of a dry air mass flowing off the North African anticyclone and a southwestern warm and humid air mass that originates off the South Atlantic anticyclone. As it crosses the equator, this air stream is shifted rightwards, becoming southwesterly winds and transporting moisture into the continent. The equatorial thermal low associated with ITF over the continent is deeper and more intense than the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) one and its thermodynamic properties differ remarkably, moisture concen tration in particular. The ITF annual latitudinal displacement is larger {{than that of the}} Atlantic ITCZ, reaching 20 ?N commonly during the North Hemisphere summer. In this manuscript one discuss about the possibility that Pacific De cadal Oscillation (PDO) is not a regular physical oscillation and its phases duration may not be predictable and be de pendent of large magnitude seismic events, which are rare and random. An important point, however, is that the Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) pattern, once established and recognized, may remain for a relative long (decades) period. Its SST pattern, due to its large area extension, modulates the global climate forcing the large scale general circulation features, ENSO in particular, to produce distinct regional impacts, depending on the signal and strength of the SST anomalies. This happened with the ITF in the Sahel and may possibly have occurred with other large scale atmospheric structures, such as the Asian Monsoon, convergence zones and subtropical anticyclones centers positioning. </p...|$|E
40|$|Probably, {{there is}} a {{relationship}} between warm and cold events in the tropical eastern South Atlantic and summer rainfall over Angola and Namibia. These events appear to originate as equatorial Kelvin waves in response to modulations of the trade winds over the tropical South Atlantic. It is well-known that the Southeast Atlantic warm events influence not only the coastal rainfall of tropical Southwestern Africa, but also {{there is a}} significant relationship between winter frontal rainfall in Southwestern South Africa and mid-latitude SST patterns, involving shifts in the jet stream and storm-tracks over the mid-latitudes. The objectives of this research work were: (1) Analyse the climate and the phenomena that influence precipitation in different regions of Angola. (2) Provide better understanding of regional rainfall climatology. (3) Make rainfall regime prognostic and future climate, which are important to managing the natural and hydrological resources and planning human activities. Over Angola, the rainfall exhibits quasi-regular low-frequency variability on both interannual and intraseasonal time scales. However, many aspects of the interrelationship between intraseasonal and interannual modes, especially the linkage between Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) and the El Niño South Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon have not been described yet, i. e. whether ENSO and MJO modulate or alter each other. Considering the latitude, Angola should have a typically tropical climate. However, four factors are crucial over the local weather definition, determining the climate of Angola based on (1) the migration of the <b>Intertropical</b> <b>Front</b> (ITF) and/or the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), (2) the displacement of the South Atlantic anticyclone associated to the cold phase of the Benguela Current, (3) the Namibia Desert and (4) the altitude of the central region. The mean NDJFMA rainfall and rain variance during 1951 - 1980 indicated largest variability to the south of Angola {{as well as in the}} Indian Ocean ITCZ corresponding to the large mean rainfall in the studied-region. The rain variance in summer is dominated by the SST of Benguela Current and the African ITCZ. The Southwestern Africa is influenced by the Subtropical High Centre Pressures of the Southern Atlantic Anticyclon, which controls the seasonal oscillation of the trade winds of marine influence the marine trade winds - and their continental adaptation the continental trade winds. In the dry regime, the NE trade winds are more intense. During the rainy season, they flow parallel to the coast usually, becoming marine trade winds. The results revealed that the precipitation regime in the analysed stations has a vell marked annual cycle, with rainfall concentrated in the South Hemisphere summer, which is the period of intense convection, September-April. The annual cycle is related to the waxing and waning of the ITCZ, that migrates northward to approximately 120 N, in August-September; and southward, to approximately 40 S, in March-April. The annual cycle of the series corresponding to those stations, were similar, despite the differences of intensity registered. The rainfall presented long-term variability that seems to be related with the PDO (20 - 30 years) and high frequency variability apparently related with ENSO events (3 - 7 years). It was clear that African Southwestern climate variability is related to global climate variability. Further work is required to test the dynamical hypotheses on ENSO's impact on Southern Hemisphere summer climate. During the studied period, strong influence of the Benguela's Niño was noticed, originating an increasing precipitation drift. Future work includes data analysis of neighboring countries, submitted to robust statistical tests in order to improve their consistency, investigating, among others, the interdecadal variability of the ITCZ, and its relationship with the Benguela Current and planetary structures, such as ENSO, NAO, and PDO. Longer-term changes in the ITCZ displacement have high social and economic impacts through severe droughts or flooding over areas of its influence. Pages: 1469 - 147...|$|E
