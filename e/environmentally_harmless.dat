The application of synthetic pesticides is problematic owing to side effects on the environment, concerns for {{public health and the}} rapid development of resistance. Entomopathogenic bacteria, notably Bacillus thuringiensis and Photorhabdus/ Xenorhabdus species, are promising alternatives to chemical insecticides, for they are able to efficiently kill insects and are considered to be <b>environmentally</b> sound and <b>harmless</b> to mammals. However, they have the handicap of showing limited environmental persistence or of depending on a nematode vector for insect infection. Intriguingly, certain strains of plant root-colonizing Pseudomonas bacteria display insect pathogenicity and thus could be formulated to extend the present range of bioinsecticides for protection of plants against root-feeding insects.

40|$|Coastal waters support {{approximately}} 90 {{per cent}} of global fisheries {{and are therefore}} an important food reserve for our planet. Eutrophication of these waters, due to human activity, leads to severe oxygen depletion and the episodic occurrence of hydrogen sulphide-toxic to multi-cellular life-with disastrous consequences for coastal ecosytems. Here we show that an area of approximately 7, 000 km(2) of African shelf, covered by sulphidic water, was detoxified by blooming bacteria that oxidized the biologically harmful sulphide to <b>environmentally</b> <b>harmless</b> colloidal sulphur and sulphate. Combined chemical analyses, stoichiometric modelling, isotopic incubations, comparative 16 S ribosomal RNA, functional gene sequence analyses and {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} indicate that the detoxification proceeded by chemolithotrophic oxidation of sulphide with nitrate and was mainly catalysed by two discrete populations of gamma- and epsilon-proteobacteria. Chemolithotrophic bacteria, accounting for approximately 20 per cent of the bacterioplankton in sulphidic waters, created a buffer zone between the toxic sulphidic subsurface waters and the oxic surface waters, where fish and other nekton live. This {{is the first time that}} large-scale detoxification of sulphidic waters by chemolithotrophs has been observed in an open-ocean system. The data suggest that sulphide can be completely consumed by bacteria in the subsurface waters and, thus, can be overlooked by remote sensing or monitoring of shallow coastal waters.

With regard to their physical and chemical characteristics, the properties of ionic liquids can be modified over a wide range because the cation’s fine structure and the anion’s identity can be altered. Since millions of ion combinations are possible it is of the highest importance to outline rational guidelines to develop technologically suitable but also <b>environmentally</b> <b>harmless</b> ionic liquids. This paper presents the results of a preliminary assessment of the toxicity of selected imidazolium ionic liquids towards marine algae. The selection of chemical entities was based on the t-SAR approach (thinking in terms of structure–activity relationships) focusing on the length (C 2 <R 1 <C 6) or type (aliphatic–aromatic) of the side chain whereas head group (imidazolium) remained the same.

MF impregnated papers are widely used as finishing materials for engineered wood. These polyols were selected because the presence of multiple hydroxy groups in the molecules was suspected to facilitate cocondensation with the main MF framework. This should lead to good resin performance. Moreover, they are readily produced from natural feedstock.

40|$|The {{development}} of an efficient and cost-effective heat storage {{is still one of}} the major technical challenges for the widespread use of solar thermal energy for space heating. Up to now solar heat has been stored mostly in well insulated water tanks. The volume of these tanks is as large as 3 m for relatively high solar fractions and up to 70 m for full solar coverage for a single-family house. Storage tanks of this size are expensive and space consuming. In new buildings, provisions can be made to accommodate large storage volumes but this type of system is not likely to become a standard heating system. For retrofitting, large storage volumes are often impossible because of its space requirements or simply the fact that large tanks cannot be brought into the building. Sorption heat stores are a promising approach to reach high solar fractions with relatively small storage volumes. A number of theoretical studies as well as laboratory tests have been performed in recent years (Welteroth and Mittelbach (2001), Núñez et al. (2003), Gartler et al. (2004)). The general functioning of the principle has been shown. The goal of the project described in this paper was to improve the system design in order to reduce system losses and to improve the overall performance of the system. A new prototype system has been designed and tested in the laboratory. A number of different materials have been suggested for use as adsorbent and working fluid (Núñez (2001)).

While making a pleasant sight, glossy stone floors may become slippery when wet and dirt are brought in on peoples shoes. To prevent people slipping and injuring themselves, the natural stone floors of public buildings {{need to have}} a non-slip finish. The Fraunhofer Institute for Material and Beam Technology IWS in Dresden have developed a laser process for this purpose, which does not deteriorate the gloss and color intensity to the tiled floor. Conventionally, polished stone floors are provided with a non-slip or anti-skid finish by a form of suction pads, increasing the friction between shoe soles and the floor. The laser process produces the same effect, but is <b>environmentally</b> <b>harmless</b> and not affected by external influences. The pulsed laser beam is guided by two scanner mirrors and a special optical co nfiguration, allowing the treatment to proceed at extremely high speed and with exceptional precision.

40|$|With {{their high}} power density and efficiency, proton {{exchange}} membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) constitute an <b>environmentally</b> <b>harmless</b> {{alternative to the}} internal combustion engine currently used in most transportation applications. Despite these advantageous features, the excessive cost of these energy conversion devices has prevented them from reaching the final commercialization stage. A significant fraction of this cost is related to the high loading of platinum-based catalysts needed for boosting the kinetics of the electrochemical reduction of oxygen at air cathode [1, 2]; the anodic oxidation of hydrogen, on the other hand, is an extremely fast reaction so that the required anode Pt loadings are only ≈ 1 / 10 th of the cathode Pt-loading [3]. Alternatively, inexpensive O 2 -reduction catalysts based on non-noble metals can be used when the reaction medium is alkaline [4, 5], {{as in the case of}} alkaline membrane fuel cells (AMFCs). Recently, though, Sheng and coworkers have shown that the kinetics for the H 2 -oxidation and evolution reactions (HOR, HER) on Pt become remarkably sluggish in alkaline electrolyte [6]. As a result, the loading of noble metal required to catalyze this reaction is much larger than the ultralow amounts used in PEMFCs, and thus alternative HOR-catalysts with lower cost or enhanced mass activity need to be developed. With this motivation, this study presents a comparison between HOR/HER-kinetics on platinum and palladium, as derived from rotating disc electrode (RDE) voltammetry measurements performed in a house-made, temperature-controlled PTFE-cell. The latter suppresses the detrimental effects of glass-corrosion by-products on the catalytic activity [7, 8], and allowed us to work in conditions closer to those in the actual AMFC, performing our RDE-measurements at temperatures as high as 80 °C and using up to 1. 0 M KOH electrolyte.

40|$|Crude oil and {{petroleum}} products are widespread water and soil pollutants resulting from marine and terrestrial spillages. International statistics of oil spill sizes for all incidents {{indicate that the}} majority of oil spills are small (less than 7 tonnes). The major accidents that happen in the oil industry contribute {{only a small fraction of}} the total oil which enters the environment. However, the nature of accidental releases is that they highly pollute small areas and have the potential to devastate the biota locally. There are several routes by which oil can get back to humans from accidental spills, e. g. through accumulation in fish and shellfish, through consumption of contaminated groundwater. Although advances have been made in the prevention of accidents, this does not apply in all countries, and by the random nature of oil spill events, total prevention is not feasible. Therefore, considerable world-wide effort has gone into strategies for minimising accidental spills and the design of new remedial technologies. This paper summarizes new knowledge as well as research and technology gaps essential for developing appropriate decision-making tools in actual spill scenarios. Since oil exploration is being driven into deeper waters and more remote, fragile environments, the risk of future accidents becomes much higher. The innovative safety and accident prevention approaches summarized in this paper are currently important for a range of stakeholders, including the oil industry, the scientific community and the public. Ultimately an integrated approach to prevention and remediation that accelerates an early warning protocol in the event of a spill would get the most appropriate technology selected and implemented as early as possible-the first few hours after a spill are crucial to the outcome of the remedial effort. A particular focus is made on bioremediation as <b>environmentally</b> <b>harmless,</b> cost-effective and relatively inexpensive technology.

40|$|Purpose: of {{this paper}} is to study the {{possibility}} of use of magnesium hydrides as energy carriers. The hydride, MgH 2, can store up to 7. 6 wt. % of hydrogen,but there are three problems with the application of pure Mg: (a) the rate at which hydrogen absorbs and desorbs is too low;(b) the hydrogen molecules do not readily dissociate at the surface of Mg to generate the hydrogen atoms that diffuse into metal; (c) the hydrogen desorption takes place at high temperature. Design/methodology/approach: as magnesium can be use as hydrogen storage material is to improve hydrogenation / dehydrogenation process by allyoing with other metals such as Ni and Al. Nanocrystalline magnesium based alloys were prepared by ball milling. The milling was carried out with a planetary mill and the effect of Ni and Al addition was investigated by means of thermogravimetry analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). Findings: Through this study it was found that the above problems could be solve by forming of small magnesium and magnesium based alloy crystals using ball milling technique. The addition of small amount of nickel, can catalyse the bond breaking / formation of the hydride event at the surface. The alloying with aluminium was shown that the thermodynamical properties -lower desorption temperatures and kinetic of hydrogen sorption process were improved along with improved resistance to O 2 contamination. Practical implications: The inclusion of Ni and Al into magnesium by mechanical ball milling leads to lower the hydrogen desorption temperature from hydride and kinetic improvement of hydrogen sorption process in magnesium. Addition of Ni and Al to Mg also represents new approach of improvement of materials based on light metals, that can provide promising results for the hydrogen storage applications. Originality/value: The results presented in this paper contributes to elucidate the hydrogen sorption process in magnesium based alloys for to increase their hydrogen storage capacity. Because the hydrogen has the highest heating value of all chemical fuel and is <b>environmentally</b> <b>harmless,</b> in future it will become the most important energy carrier and magnesium alloys can compete with other materials for to achieve very efficient hydrogen storage systems...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Ever since the first petroleum well was drilled, water production has been a deterring force in maximizing an oilfield's hydrocarbon reserves. To satisfy the ever increasing global demand for petroleum, many different techniques for enhancing oil recovery have been investigated. One such technique is the application of a polymer solution to the near-wellbore area. The polymer solution lowers the relative permeability of the reservoir water thus increasing the amount of water left in formation. Although polymers can be beneficial, many environmental and economical concerns are also associated with their use. A starch based polymer would provide an <b>environmentally</b> <b>harmless</b> solution while using readily available and inexpensive agricultural products such as grains and cereals. This study uses numerical simulation to analyze the starch based polymer's performance in the near-wellbore area. Simulations are performed on two separate single-well, radial models. The first model covers a water influx at the circumferential edge of a reservoir, the second covers water influx from the bottom of a reservoir. Two different rock samples are adapted to each single-well model. The two rock samples are the Elgin and Okesa Sandstones. Within the models, a multitude of reservoir conditions are investigated to better evaluate the polymer's ability to enhance oil recovery. The Western Atlas' VIP simulator is used for this study. Application of the starch based polymer treatment to the near-wellbore is shown to be an effective agent in enhancing a well's oil recovery. For the edge water influx model, the polymer performed well {{for a wide range of}} variables, including penetration depth, production rate, radial permeability, application time, reservoir temperature, perforation interval, aquifer strength, porosity, and bottomhole pressure constraints. The bottom water influx model also produced good results for many of the simulation runs however, the effects of the penetration depth and production rate proved to be the most important factors in a successful polymer treatment. The variables investigated in the bottom water influx model are polymer penetration depth, production rate, permeability ratio, application time, reservoir temperature, aquifer strength, perforation height above the oil/water contact, porosity, and bottomhole pressure constraints...|$|E
40|$|Calcium {{magnesium}} acetate (CMA) {{has been identified}} by Bjorksten Research Laboratories as an <b>environmentally</b> <b>harmless</b> alternative to sodium or calcium chloride for deicing highways. Their study found CMA to be noncorrosive to steel, aluminum and zinc {{with little or no}} anticipated environmental impact. When used, it degrades into elements found in abundance in nature. The deicing capabilities were found to be similar to sodium chloride. The neutralized CMA they produced did cause scaling of PC concrete, but they did not expect mildly alkaline CMA to have this effect. In the initial investigation of CMA at the Iowa DOT laboratory, it was found that CMA produced from hydrated lime and acetic acid was a light, fluffy material. It was recognized that a deicer in this form would be difficult to effectively distribute on highways without considerable wind loss. A process was developed to produce CMA in the presence of sand to increase particle weight. In this report the product of this process, which consists of sand particles coated with CMA, is referred to as "CMA deicer". The mixture of salts, calcium {{magnesium acetate}}, is referred to as "CMA". The major problems with CMA for deicing are: (1) it is not commercially available, (2) it is expensive with present production methods and (3) there is very little known about how it performs on highways under actual deicing conditions. In view of the potential benefits this material offers, it is highly desirable to find solutions or answers to these problems. This study provides information to advance that effort. The study consisted of four principal tasks which were: 1. Production of CMA Deicer The objective was to further develop the laboratory process for producing CMA deicer on a pilot plant basis and to produce a sufficient quantity for field trials. The original proposal called for producing 20 tons of CMA deicer. 2. Field Evaluation of CMA Deicer The objective was {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} CMA deicer when used under field conditions and obtain information on application procedures. Performance was compared with a regular 50 / 50 mixture of sand and sodium chloride. 3. Investigation of Effects of CMA on PC Concrete The objective was to determine any scaling effect that mildly alkaline CMA might have on PC concrete. Comparison was made with calcium chloride. 4. Determine Feasibility of Producing High Magnesium CMA The objective was to investigate the possibility of producing a CMA deicer with magnesium acetate content well above that produced from dolomitic lime. A high magnesium acetate content is desirable because pure magnesium acetate has a water eutectic of - 22 F° as compared with + 5 F° for calcium acetate and is therefore a more effective deicer...|$|E
40|$|This {{work was}} {{undertaken}} in the Laboratoire de Microbiologie of the University of Neuchâtel, in close collaboration with the Center of Hydrogeology (CHYN). This multi-disciplinary research project was instigated because of the growing need both for <b>environmentally</b> <b>harmless</b> hydrogeological investigation tools, and for new tracers {{that can be used}} in multitracing experiments. This work treats of the use of bacteriophages as biological tracers in underground and surface waters. The size of bacteriophages is of the order of a few hundred nm. These viruses only attack specific bacteria. They are absolutely harmless for any other living organism. Previous experiments have shown the value of bacteriophages as tracers in fissured environments. The aims of the present work were: to select several bacteriophages particularly well adapted to the use as hydrogeological tracers; to optimize the production of these bacteriophages, and the analytical methods for detecting them; to study the behavior of these bacteriophages experimentally, under different physico-chemical conditions; to test the phages in karstic fissured environments and to extend their use to saturated porous environments and surface hydrology; to compare the migration of these phages to that of the best conventional hydrological tracers. The first part of this work treats of the isolation and characterization of new bacteriophages. Over twenty bacteriophage/host bacterium (BHB) systems were studied. Seven bacteriophages were selected for the second part of the project. The selection was based on the physiological properties of the host bacteria and the physico-chemical characteristics of the bacteriophages. These seven phages exhibit an interesting variety of shapes and physical characteristics. They include three phages of strictly marine bacteria. None of these BHB systems are naturally found in aquifer waters. The rest of this work includes the development of an analytical and enumeration technique. We chose to work with the double agar-layer technique, using Petri dishes. The growth media and the different steps of this technique were optimized for each BHB system. This increased the reliability and reproducibility of the technique, without adding to the cost or workload. The behavior of the phages was studied in laboratory experiments. As this behavior is mostly determined by the inactivation and adsorption of the phages, we investigated the influence on these two phenomena of various parameters, either physical (temperature, pH, agitation), or chemical (ionic concentrations, presence of proteins, of sand or colloidal clay particles). Our results show that in water, phages react very rapidly and massively to the presence of colloidal particles, even to very low concentrations. Agitation causes the viruses to be rapidly inactivated. Raising the temperature increases this inactivation. Colloidal clay particles (Montmorillonite and Attapulgite) as well as organic macromolecules efficiently protect the phages from inactivation. Only one phage was inactivated faster in the presence of mineral colloids. Each phage reacted individually to the presence of these mineral colloids. However, no correlation could be established with the physico-chemical characteristics of the bacteriophages. The reactions can be classified into three distinct types, described by Grant et al. [1993]. According to the type of reaction of a phage, it is possible to qualitatively predict its behavior during a tracing experiment. The tracing experiments performed in karstic fissured environments showed that the migration of bacteriophages is similar to that of the best fluorescent tracers (Uranine, Sulphorhodamine). The restitutions are generally high. The phages always reappear faster, which shows that they can be diluted more, before reaching their inferior detection limit. The trials performed in a porous saturated environment, on the Wilerwald (CH) test site, showed that bacteriophages are also adapted to this type of conditions. Their speed of migration is higher than that of dissolved chemical compounds (Uranine, Naphtionate). Only one trial was performed in a river. It nevertheless showed that phages are also perfectly suitable to these types of tracings. By the simultaneous injection of several bacteriophages at different points along the river, it was possible to scan its course and discover an infiltration zone. This work confirms that phages are of undeniable value to hydrology as biological tracers. Their impact on the environment is practically nil and they can therefore be used also in delicate situations (springs used for drinking water, tracings in inhabited areas). This method is not limited to karstic aquifers anymore. Our modifications and adaptations of the technique make it suitable also for saturated porous environments and rivers. It advantages are numerous: The phages are non-pathogenic, non-toxic and invisible. So this method can also be used for studying drinking water (springs, reservoirs, etc). Each phage generally attacks only one bacterial species. By a careful selection of the BHB systems, any effect on the aquifers microflora can be avoided. No background noise exists in the aquifers, since they phages are not found there naturally. None will be generated or will persist over time, because of their short life span. The analysis of the samples is fast and cheap. Only a few milliliters of water are necessary for the enumeration of the phages. The detection level of the routine-analysis technique is about 1 phage per 2 ml of water. This sensitivity is comparable, and most often superior, to that of the best fluorescent tracers. If need be, the sensitivity can be lowered to 1 phage per 10 ml. It is also possible to differentiate and count a mixture of phages in a single sample. Theoretically, bacteriophages offer unlimited possibilities of multitracings. Ten to twenty liters of phage culture are necessary for one tracing experiment. Such an amount is easily transportable, even to inaccessible injection sites. It will contain 1014 - 1015 phages, which represents in all about 1 gram of protein and a few grams of mineral salts and of various organic substances (amino acids, growth medium components). The influence on the aquifer will be negligible, even if the flow is small...|$|E
