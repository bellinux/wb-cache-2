5|$|As a child, Juha Vainio loved {{singing and}} the family's {{neighbours}} often {{asked him to}} come over and perform. When the Winter War started in 1939, Juha was too young to understand events. After his father went to war as a captain of the military reserve force, Juha moved with his mother to Metsola, Kotka. As an adult, the only thing Juha Vainio remembered from the war were the air-raid sirens and people's anxiety. <b>He</b> <b>once</b> <b>said</b> that he was more afraid of the women next door than the war, {{but on the other hand}} admitted that the war left him with emotional scars. His song Eräänlainen sotaveteraani ("Some Kind of War Veteran"), on the album Sellaista elämä on ("That's How Life Is"), echoes these sentiments. Because Kotka was a harbour town and often bombed, Juha and his mother had to often evacuate. Sometimes they went to stay at her mother's cousins during the evacuations where Juha became friends with Olli Miettinen, a cousin of his mother. The two had an age difference of six years. The only brother of Kaarina Vainio, Mauno, was killed in the war.|$|E
5|$|Helmle, Corbett & Harrison {{teamed with}} another {{architectural}} firm, Sugarman & Berger. Henry Sugarman, {{of the latter}} organization, advised in the building's design and supervised interior construction work. The cornerstone was laid on March 24, 1929. It has an all-black irregular shape stepped like the building. On it are inscribed the year 1929 and a symbol designed by Roerich consisting of a circle enclosing three dots together with a monogram. The monogram, showing the letter R within the letter M, stands for the Roerich Museum. The circle and the three dots are the symbol of Roerich's Banner of Peace. <b>He</b> <b>once</b> <b>said</b> the circle represents eternity and unity and the dots the triune nature of existence. On another occasion he said the symbol has two meanings: in one interpretation, the circle represents the totality of culture and the dots are art, science, and religion (or philosophy), while in the other, the circle symbolizes the endlessness {{of time and the}} dots are the past, the present, and the future. The cornerstone contains a 400-year-old casket from the Rajput dynasty of northern India. Made of iron with inlays of gold and silver, the casket contains photographs taken during the Roeriches' expedition to Central Asia. It is also said to contain Jacob's Pillow or the Stone of Scone. Prominent politicians participated in the cornerstone-laying ceremony and among messages read from prominent Americans was a letter from Albert Einstein in which he praised the cultural goals of the building's directors.|$|E
25|$|It {{is unclear}} just when Powell {{learned that the}} kidnap plot had turned to an assassination. There is {{testimony}} from the nurse attending the Secretary of State indicating that Powell may have learned of his role to assassinate Seward on Thursday, April 13. A man fitting Powell's description appeared at the Seward home that day to inquire about the Secretary's health. Powell himself was inconsistent. <b>He</b> <b>once</b> <b>said</b> he learned he was to kill Seward {{on the morning of}} Friday, April 14, but later claimed he did not know until the evening of April 14.|$|E

25|$|Wittgenstein's {{influence}} has been felt {{in nearly every}} field of the humanities and social sciences, yet there are diverging interpretations of his thought. In the words of his friend and colleague Georg Henrik von Wright: He was of the opinion... that his ideas were generally misunderstood and distorted even by those who professed to be his disciples. He doubted he would be better understood in the future. <b>He</b> <b>once</b> <b>said</b> he {{felt as though he}} was writing for people who would think in a different way, breathe a different air of life, from that of present-day men.|$|E
25|$|Lee enjoyed basic medical studies after {{entering}} the medical department. He finished his first research paper in his freshman year, {{which was published}} in the Taiwanese Medical Magazine (台灣醫學雜誌). After graduating in 1940, Lee decided to quit clinical medicine and keep on studying. He became the assistant of Tsungming Tu, who was researching on basic medical studies and, at the time, the only Taiwanese professors in the medical department. <b>He</b> <b>once</b> <b>said,</b> To gain honor for Taiwan, dignity for the Taiwanese, I chose to follow Professor Tu instead of several other Japanese professors. Because I thought Professor Tu was our people, and we should help him.|$|E
25|$|As a cricket writer, he {{generally}} concentrated on {{bringing out the}} character of the players that he was writing about, and he made liberal use of humour. In these characteristics, and in that his cricket memories went back as far as {{the first decade of the}} 20th century, he might be compared with Neville Cardus, though Thomson was writing from a Yorkshire rather than a Lancashire perspective. <b>He</b> <b>once</b> <b>said</b> that cricket had given him more unalloyed pleasure over a longer period than anything else, and that pleasure was evident in his writing. Thomson saw cricket not only as the most pleasurable of pastimes but also quite like the Poet Laureate might see it—an eternally vibrant display of colour, spirit, humour and conflict.|$|E

25|$|Throughout Dijkstra's career, {{his work}} was {{characterized}} by elegance and economy. A prolific writer (especially as an essayist), Dijkstra authored more than 1,300 papers, many written by hand in his precise script. They were essays and parables; fairy tales and warnings; comprehensive explanation and pedagogical pretext. Most were about mathematics and computer science; others were trip reports that are more revealing about their author than about the people and places visited. It was his habit to copy each paper and circulate it to {{a small group of}} colleagues who would copy and forward the papers to another limited group of scientists. His love affair with simplicity came at an early age and under his mother's guidance. <b>He</b> <b>once</b> <b>said</b> he had asked his mother whether trigonometry was a difficult topic. She replied that he must learn all the formulas and that furthermore if he required more than five lines to prove something, he was on the wrong track.|$|E
25|$|Moshe Dayan was {{covering}} the Vietnam War to observe modern warfare up close {{after he left}} political life. In fact, he was on patrol as an observer {{with members of the}} US Marine Corps. Although Dayan did not take part in most of the planning before the Six-Day War of June 1967, he personally oversaw the capture of East Jerusalem during the 5–7 June fighting. During the years following the war, Dayan enjoyed enormous popularity in Israel and was widely viewed as a potential Prime Minister. At this time, Dayan was the leader of the hawkish camp within the Labor government, opposing a return to anything like Israel's pre-1967 borders. <b>He</b> <b>once</b> <b>said</b> that he preferred Sharm-al-Sheikh (an Egyptian town on the southern edge of the Sinai Peninsula overlooking Israel's shipping lane to the Red Sea via the Gulf of Aqaba) without peace, to peace without Sharm-al-Sheikh. He modified these views later in his career and {{played an important role in}} the eventual peace agreement between Israel and Egypt.|$|E
25|$|Important as well is Languages arabes du present ("Present-day {{languages}} of the Arabs", 1974), which delves into the literary {{history of the}} Arabs, their language and culture. Berque's linguistic versatility is made apparent here in his translations of Arabic poetry from the classical period to the present, and {{in his analysis of}} the varieties of spoken and written Arabic. He was an accomplished Arabist, perfecting several Arabic dialects of both the Maghreb and the Middle East. He believed in the importance of bringing together different, but related, regions, whether in the Arabic- speaking world or in the Mediterranean, as {{can be seen from the}} titles of two of his books, De l'Euphrate a l'Atlas ("From the Euphrates to the Atlas", 1978) and Memoires des deux rives ("Recollections from Both Shores of the Mediterranean", 1989), the latter described by Ernest Gellner, as 'a splendid account of what it was to be a pied-noir slowly converted to anti-colonialism'. <b>He</b> <b>once</b> <b>said</b> in an interview that since childhood he had tried fervently 'to synthesise the cultures of the northern shore of the Mediterranean with those of its southern shore'.|$|E

500|$|Barker {{received}} an OBE in 1978. He {{was an avid}} collector of antiques, books and posters and amassed a collection of over 53,000 postcards. He produced several compilation books of them, including Ronnie Barker's Book of Bathing Beauties, A Pennyworth of Art, and Sauce. Barker rarely appeared in public, and when he did, it was almost always in character. <b>He</b> <b>once</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I've always known I haven't a personality of my own, I have {{to be someone else}} to be happy. That's why I became an actor, I suppose." ...|$|E
500|$|By 1972, {{after being}} a {{performer}} for nearly ten years, Morrison began experiencing stage fright when performing for audiences of thousands, {{as opposed to}} the hundreds as he had experienced in his early career. He became anxious on stage and had difficulty establishing eye contact with the audience. <b>He</b> <b>once</b> <b>said</b> in an interview about performing on stage, [...] "I dig singing the songs but there are times when it's pretty agonising for me to be out there." [...] After a brief break from music, he started appearing in clubs, regaining his ability to perform live, albeit with smaller audiences.|$|E

500|$|Anton Pavlovich Chekhov ( [...] , 29 January 1860 – 15 July 1904) was a Russian {{playwright and}} short story writer, who is {{considered}} to be among the greatest writers of short fiction in history. His career as a playwright produced four classics and his best short stories are held in high esteem by writers and critics. Along with Henrik Ibsen and August Strindberg, Chekhov {{is often referred to as}} one of the three seminal figures in the birth of early modernism in the theatre. Chekhov practised [...] as a medical doctor throughout most of his literary career: [...] "Medicine is my lawful wife", <b>he</b> <b>once</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "and literature is my mistress." ...|$|E
500|$|Most of Motley's runs were trap plays up the middle, {{but he had}} {{the speed}} to run outside. [...] "There's no telling how much yardage I might have made if I ran as much as some backs do now," [...] <b>he</b> <b>once</b> <b>said.</b> Running back Jim Brown surpassed Motley's rushing records in the early 1960s, but many of Motley's coaches and fellow players {{regarded}} Motley as the better player, in part because of his strength as a blocker. [...] "There is no comparison between Jim Brown and Marion Motley," [...] Graham said at a luncheon in Canton in 1964. [...] "Motley was the greatest all-around fullback." ...|$|E
500|$|Island Records was keen on Drake {{promoting}} Bryter Layter through press interviews, radio {{sessions and}} live appearances. Drake, who {{by this time}} was smoking what Kirby has described as [...] "unbelievable amounts" [...] of cannabis and exhibiting [...] "the first signs of psychosis", refused. Disappointed by the reaction to Bryter Layter, he turned his thoughts inwards, and withdrew from family and friends. He rarely left his flat, and then only to play an occasional concert or to buy drugs. His sister recalled: [...] "This was a very bad time. <b>He</b> <b>once</b> <b>said</b> to me that everything started to go wrong from [...] time on, and I think that was when things started to go wrong." ...|$|E

500|$|<b>He</b> <b>once</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "in choreography, {{ordinary}} movements {{from real}} life are taken and extended, so they become dance movements, yet the relation to reality {{must always be}} there. It's {{important for me to}} know who the characters are and what their function is in the script. I must be able to illustrate either their activities, their emotions, or their changes in mood by the way they dance, all the while keeping the dance movements footed in reality and yet making the movements sort of odd and eccentric." [...] This philosophy was reflected in the early scene from The Band Wagon, when Fred Astaire walks down a railroad platform singing [...] "By Myself." [...] His walk was not quite a dance, and epitomized Kidd's style.|$|E
500|$|Hornsby {{started playing}} {{baseball}} {{at a very}} young age; <b>he</b> <b>once</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I can't remember anything that happened before I had a baseball in my hand."

By the age of 15, Hornsby was already playing for several semi-professional teams. He also played baseball for North Side High School until 10th grade, when he dropped out to take a full-time job at Swift and Company. While he was in high school, Hornsby also played on the football team, alongside future College Football Hall of Famer Bo McMillin.|$|E
