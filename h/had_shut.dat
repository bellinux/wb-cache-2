5|$|By 17 August 1942, {{production}} {{had climbed}} rapidly after Blohm & Voss BV 138 production was scaled down and licence work <b>had</b> <b>shut</b> down at WFG. Production now reached some 150 Ju 87 D airframes per month, but spare parts were failing {{to reach the}} same production levels. Undercarriage parts were particularly in short supply. Milch ordered production to 350 Ju 87s per month in September 1942. This was not achievable due to the insufficient production capacity in the Reich.|$|E
5|$|By 2 p.m. on 16 July, the rioters {{had left}} Birmingham and were heading towards Kings Norton and the Kingswood Chapel; it was {{estimated}} that one group of the rioters totalled 250 to 300people. They burned Cox's farm at Warstock and looted and attacked the home of a Mr. Taverner. When they reached Kingswood, Warwickshire, they burned the Dissenting chapel and its manse. By this time, Birmingham <b>had</b> <b>shut</b> down—no business was being conducted.|$|E
5|$|During the battle, Graham also {{saved the}} life of Captain Wyndham– {{one of those who}} <b>had</b> <b>shut</b> the gate– by {{shooting}} a sniper whose musket was trained on the officer. Mid-afternoon, a fire broke out in one of the farm buildings following a bombardment of incendiary shells. Graham's brother Joseph was lying wounded within, and Graham requested permission to fall out, so he might rescue his brother; given permission, he retrieved his brother and returned to his post. Joseph Graham died of wounds five days later.|$|E

5|$|Leaving Russia before Reed, {{who wanted}} {{to report on the}} Bolshevik debate about Russian {{participation}} in the war with Germany, Bryant returned to New York, arriving on February 18, 1918. She found Greenwich Village much changed by the war; old friends had moved, rents had gone up, and tourists were replacing bohemians. Under government pressure, The Masses <b>had</b> <b>shut</b> down. Working out of a room at the Brevoort Hotel, Bryant wrote articles about the October Revolution and speeches or cables urging support of the workers' government in Russia.|$|E
5|$|On 18 January, {{a problem}} with the {{computers}} aboard Mir developed shortly before fuelling of the Soyuz-U rocket was scheduled to commence, about five and a half hours before the launch was due to occur. The launch attempt was scrubbed, or cancelled, and the launch was expected to be delayed by four or five days. On 19 January, the launch was rescheduled for 24 January, giving controllers time to restart the computer and the station's gyroscopes, which <b>had</b> <b>shut</b> down when the computer failed.|$|E
5|$|The shutout was {{the first}} for Arkansas since their 28–0 loss to LSU in 1995 and was their first in Fayetteville since a 7–0 loss to Baylor in 1966. It also {{marked the first time}} Alabama <b>had</b> <b>shut</b> out opponents in {{consecutive}} weeks since the 1980 season. For his performance, Chance Warmack was named the SEC Offensive Lineman of the Week. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Razorbacks to 13–8 (16–7 without NCAA vacations and forfeits).|$|E

5|$|As the {{vandalism}} <b>had</b> <b>shut</b> down {{service at}} the central hub, a police squad was organized and dispatched to protect repairmen while they fixed the overhead cables at the main terminal building. The repairmen and the police were quickly surrounded by the strikers who hurled bricks and beat them with clubs. The police and repairmen were forced to flee and were prevented from restoring power to the terminal's lines. By the afternoon of November 1, the strikers were able to force a complete shut down of the urban central hub and halt all city streetcar operations. The shut down also stopped most of Indiana's inter-city light rail transportation, but regional routes outside of Indianapolis continued to operate. The shut down caused widespread disruption of public transportation and its effects were immediately felt by the public.|$|E
5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1949 Street & Smith, {{one of the largest}} pulp publishers, <b>had</b> <b>shut</b> down every one of their pulps. This format was dying out, though it took several more years before the pulps {{completely}} disappeared from the newsstands. Both Thrilling Wonder and Startling went quarterly in 1954, {{and at the end of}} that year Mines left. The magazines did not survive him for long; only two more issues of Thrilling Wonder appeared, both edited by Alexander Samalman. After the beginning of 1955, Thrilling Wonder was merged with Startling, which itself ceased publication at the end of 1955.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the reactor}} itself {{commenced}} in February 1944. Watched by Compton, Matthias, DuPont's Crawford Greenewalt, Leona Woods and Fermi, who inserted the first slug, the reactor was powered up beginning on 13 September 1944. Over {{the next few}} days, 838 tubes were loaded and the reactor went critical. Shortly after midnight on 27 September, the operators began to withdraw the control rods to initiate production. At first all appeared well but around 03:00 the power level started to drop and by 06:30 the reactor <b>had</b> <b>shut</b> down completely. The cooling water was investigated {{to see if there}} was a leak or contamination. The next day the reactor started up again, only to shut down once more.|$|E

5|$|In {{their first}} game of the season, the Hokies lived up to expectations, {{shutting}} out James Madison University, 470. The game was the first time Tech <b>had</b> <b>shut</b> out an opponent in a season opener since 1953. The game was marred, however, by a leg injury to Michael Vick that caused him to leave the game. The following week, against the University of Alabama Birmingham, Vick did not play. Despite his absence, the Hokies still managed a 3110 win. This was followed by a 3111 Thursday-night victory over Clemson in Virginia Tech's first game against a Division I-A opponent during the season.|$|E
5|$|On September 29, 1944, Zinn {{received}} an urgent call from Samuel Allison, {{the director of}} the Metallurgical Laboratory. The B Reactor at Hanford <b>had</b> <b>shut</b> down shortly after reaching full power, only to come back to life again some hours later. Norman Hilberry suspected a neutron poison was responsible. If so, it had a half life of around 9.7 hours. Xenon-135 had a half life close to that, but had not been detected in Argonne or by the X-10 Graphite Reactor in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Zinn quickly brought Chicago Pile-3 up to full power, and within twelve hours, had made a series of measurements that confirmed the Hanford results.|$|E
5|$|The {{health system}} has {{more or less}} collapsed. At the end of November 2008, some {{operations}} at three of Zimbabwe's four major referral hospitals <b>had</b> <b>shut</b> down, along with the Zimbabwe Medical School, and the fourth major hospital had two wards and no operating theatres working. Due to hyperinflation, those hospitals still open {{were not able to}} obtain basic drugs and medicines. The situation changed drastically after the Unity Government and the introduction of the multi-currency system in February 2009 although the political and economic crisis also contributed to the emigration of the doctors and people with medical knowledge.|$|E

5|$|In September 1944, Fermi {{inserted}} the first uranium fuel slug into the B Reactor at the Hanford Site, the production reactor designed to breed plutonium in large quantities. Like X-10, {{it had been}} designed by Fermi's team at the Metallurgical Laboratory, and built by DuPont, but it was much larger, and was water-cooled. Over the next few days, 838 tubes were loaded, and the reactor went critical. Shortly after midnight on 27 September, the operators began to withdraw the control rods to initiate production. At first all appeared to be well, but around 03:00, the power level started to drop and by 06:30 the reactor <b>had</b> <b>shut</b> down completely. The Army and DuPont turned to Fermi's team for answers. The cooling water was investigated {{to see if there}} was a leak or contamination. The next day the reactor suddenly started up again, only to shut down once more a few hours later. The problem was traced to neutron poisoning from xenon-135, a fission product with a half-life of 9.2 hours. Fortunately, DuPont had deviated from the Metallurgical Laboratory's original design in which the reactor had 1,500 tubes arranged in a circle, and had added 504 tubes to fill in the corners. The scientists had originally considered this over-engineering a waste of time and money, but Fermi realized that by loading all 2,004 tubes, the reactor could reach the required power level and efficiently produce plutonium.|$|E
