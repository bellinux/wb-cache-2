5|$|During {{periods of}} low demand <b>gas</b> <b>is</b> {{taken from the}} National Transmission System (NTS) at Beltoft, North Lincolnshire and {{transferred}} via a 12-inch diameter 15km pipeline to the Lindholme Compression Site. Here <b>gas</b> <b>is</b> heated in a water bath heater then through a pressure let-down skid and via a 16-inch 1.5km pipeline to the Hatfield Moor well site for injection into the reservoir for storage. The sandstone reservoir has a capacity of about 4.1 billion cubic feet (116 million cubic metres). During periods of high demand <b>gas</b> <b>is</b> withdrawn from the reservoir and through the 16-inch pipeline to the Lindholme site. Here the <b>gas</b> <b>is</b> dehydrated with glycol and compressed using a gas-turbine driven compressor to a pressure suitable for export to Beltoft and into the NTS.|$|E

5000|$|Industrial <b>gases</b> <b>are</b> gaseous {{materials}} that are manufactured for use in Industry. The principal <b>gases</b> provided <b>are</b> nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, argon, hydrogen, helium and acetylene; although a huge variety of <b>gases</b> and mixtures <b>are</b> available in <b>gas</b> cylinders.

30|$|Based on {{analysis}} of gases compositions, carbon isotope ratios, light hydrocarbon properties, combined with geological analysis, natural {{gases in the}} Jiyang Depression were classified into two categories namely hydrocarbon gas and abiogenic gas. The abiogenic <b>gas</b> <b>was</b> mainly magmatogenic or mantle derived CO 2. Hydrocarbon <b>gases</b> <b>were</b> further divided into coal-type gas, oil-type gas, and biogas according to the kerogen types and formation mechanisms. The oil-type <b>gases</b> <b>were</b> divided into mature oil-type gas (oil-associated gas), highly mature oil-type gas. Highly mature oil-type <b>gases</b> <b>were</b> subdivided into oil-cracking gas and kerogen thermal degradation gas.|$|R

5000|$|... de Laval nozzles are Venturi tubes {{that produce}} {{supersonic}} gas velocities as {{the tube and}} the <b>gas</b> <b>are</b> first constricted and then the tube and <b>gas</b> <b>are</b> expanded beyond the choke plane.|$|R
50|$|Diffusion of <b>gases</b> <b>is</b> {{configured}} with {{a uniform}} concentration of gases {{and while the}} <b>gases</b> <b>are</b> stationary. Diffusion is the change of concentration between the two gases due to a weaker concentration gradient between the two <b>gases.</b> Diffusion <b>is</b> the transportation of mass {{over a period of}} time.|$|R
50|$|Because of the {{enormous}} density difference between water and <b>gases</b> (water <b>is</b> about 1,000 times more dense than most gases), the lifting power of underwater <b>gases</b> <b>is</b> very strong. The type of <b>gas</b> used <b>is</b> largely inconsequential because the relative differences between <b>gases</b> <b>is</b> negligible {{in relation to the}} density of water. However, some gases can liquefy under high pressure, leading to an abrupt loss of buoyancy.|$|R

5|$|Under {{ordinary}} {{conditions on}} Earth, elemental hydrogen exists as the diatomic gas, H2. However, hydrogen <b>gas</b> <b>is</b> very {{rare in the}} Earth's atmosphere (1 ppm by volume) because of its light weight, which enables it to escape from Earth's gravity more easily than heavier gases. However, hydrogen is the third most abundant element on the Earth's surface, mostly {{in the form of}} chemical compounds such as hydrocarbons and water. Hydrogen <b>gas</b> <b>is</b> produced by some bacteria and algae and is a natural component of flatus, as is methane, itself a hydrogen source of increasing importance.|$|E

5|$|Argon {{may be used}} as {{the carrier}} gas in gas {{chromatography}} and in electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; it is the gas of choice for the plasma used in ICP spectroscopy. Argon is preferred for the sputter coating of specimens for scanning electron microscopy. Argon <b>gas</b> <b>is</b> also commonly used for sputter deposition of thin films as in microelectronics and for wafer cleaning in microfabrication.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine is a {{toxic gas}} that attacks the {{respiratory}} system, eyes, and skin. Because it is denser than air, {{it tends to}} accumulate {{at the bottom of}} poorly ventilated spaces. Chlorine <b>gas</b> <b>is</b> a strong oxidizer, which may react with flammable materials.|$|E
5|$|Deck {{decompression}} chambers {{are used}} for surface decompression, described in a previous section. Most deck decompression chambers are fitted with built in breathing systems (BIBS), which supply an alternative breathing gas to the occupants (usually oxygen), and discharge the exhaled gas outside the chamber, so the chamber <b>gas</b> <b>is</b> not excessively enriched by oxygen, which would cause an unacceptable fire hazard, and require frequent flushing with chamber gas (usually air).|$|E
50|$|Previously called inert <b>gases,</b> {{their name}} <b>was</b> changed {{as there are}} a few other <b>gases</b> that <b>are</b> inert but not noble gases, such as nitrogen. The noble <b>gases</b> <b>are</b> located in the far right column of the {{periodic}} table, also known as Group Zero or Group Eighteen. Noble <b>gases</b> <b>are</b> also called as aerogens but this nomenclature of the group is not officially accepted by the IUPAC.|$|R

50|$|The Mond <b>gas</b> process <b>was</b> {{designed}} to convert cheap coal into flammable <b>gas,</b> which <b>was</b> {{made up of}} mainly hydrogen, while recovering ammonium sulfate.

5000|$|Span <b>gases</b> <b>are</b> {{used for}} testing and {{calibrating}} gas detection equipment by exposing the sensor to a known concentration of a contaminant.

40|$|The calciothermic {{reduction}} of TiCl 4 <b>gas</b> <b>was</b> studied firstly by using Ca-CaCl 2 melt, to whose surface the <b>gas</b> <b>was</b> blown. The fine Ti particles settled {{down in the}} crucible, when the concentration of dissolved Ca was > 2 mol% at 1173 K. When < 2 mol%Ca, a part of TiCl 4 <b>gas</b> <b>was</b> dissolved probably as TiCl 3 or TiCl 2 into the CaCl 2 melt, and it precipitated as the lower Ti oxides. When TiCl 4 <b>gas</b> <b>was</b> blown to the molten CaCl 2, which was electrochemically decomposed into Cl 2 gas at the carbon anode and Ca at the Ti cathode, TiCl 4 <b>gas</b> <b>was</b> reduced to the dendritic Ti on the cathode surface. Because the electrolyzed Ca reacted preferentially with the oxide crucibles, most of the oxygen ions combined with Ti(II) and Ti(III), and they formed TiO and Ti 2 O 3...|$|R
5|$|In {{this process}} lead bullion and slag is {{obtained}} directly from lead concentrates. The lead sulfide concentrate is melted in a furnace and oxidized, forming lead monoxide. Carbon (coke or coal <b>gas)</b> <b>is</b> {{added to the}} molten charge along with fluxing agents.
