5|$|An {{alternative}} {{suggestion was}} that the comets were all <b>fragments</b> <b>of</b> an earlier Sun-grazing comet. This idea was first proposed in 1880, and its plausibility was amply demonstrated when the Great Comet of 1882 broke up into several fragments after its perihelion passage. In 1888, Heinrich Kreutz published a paper showing that the comets of 1843 (C/1843 D1, the Great March Comet), 1880 (C/1880 C1, the Great Southern Comet), and 1882 (C/1882 R1, Great September Comet) were probably <b>fragments</b> <b>of</b> a giant comet that had broken up several orbits before. The comet of 1680 proved to be unrelated to this family of comets.|$|E

The two-variable <b>fragment</b> <b>of</b> monadic least fixed-point logic without parameters is as expressive as the two-variable <b>fragment</b> <b>of</b> binary least fixed-point logic without parameters. 3. The two-variable <b>fragment</b> <b>of</b> binary least fixed-point logic with pa-rameters is strictly more expressive than the two-variable <b>fragment</b> <b>of</b> monadic least fixed-point logic with parameters (even on finite strings). 1...|$|R
