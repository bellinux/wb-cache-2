25|$|Swing {{moorings}} {{also known}} as simple or single-point moorings, are the simplest and most common kind of mooring. A swing mooring consists of a single anchor {{at the bottom of}} a waterway with a rode (a rope, cable, or chain) running to a float on the surface. The float allows a vessel to find the rode and connect to the anchor. These anchors are known as swing moorings because a vessel attached to this kind of mooring swings in a circle when the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>wind</b> or tide changes.|$|E
25|$|The most {{prevailing}} winds in {{the region}} are the southwesterly between April and October and the northeasterly {{during the rest of the}} year. The predominant wind direction is mostly from W and SW direction during the rainy season and SW and NW during post-monsoon month. However, during January to March, winds from NE and E direction are predominant. During the northeast monsoon, that is, between October and January, the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>wind</b> is generally NE and NNE. During depressions in northeast monsoon, the wind velocity goes up to 50km/h and up to 105km/h during cyclones of duration 2 to 3 days. Gusts of 160km/h have been occasionally experienced. During southwest monsoon between March and September, the wind blows predominantly from the south. During June, July and August, strong wind is experienced from southwest direction in mornings, from south during afternoons, and from southeast during nights. Wind direction is between 153° and 263° relative to the north, and the wind speed varies from 2 to 12m/s.|$|E

500|$|Prevailing {{winds are}} winds that blow {{predominantly}} {{from a single}} general direction over a particular point on the Earth's surface. The dominant winds are the trends in <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>wind</b> with the highest speed over a particular point on the Earth's surface. A region's prevailing and dominant winds acted by global patterns of movement in the Earth's atmosphere. [...] In general, easterly flow occurs at low and medium latitudes globally. In the mid-latitudes, westerly winds are the rule and their strength is largely determined by the polar cyclone. In areas where winds tend to be light, the sea breeze/land breeze cycle {{is the most important}} to the prevailing wind; in areas which have variable terrain, mountain and valley breezes dominate the wind pattern. Highly elevated surfaces can induce a thermal low, which then augments the environmental wind flow.|$|E
2500|$|Because {{only small}} parts of Russia are south of 50° north {{latitude}} {{and more than}} half of the country is north of 60° north latitude, extensive regions experience six months of snow cover over subsoil that is permanently frozen to depths as far as several hundred meters. The average yearly temperature of nearly all of Siberia is below freezing, and the average for most of European Russia is between [...] Most of Russia has only two seasons, summer and winter, with very short intervals of moderation between them. Transportation routes, including entire railroad lines, are redirected in winter to traverse rock-solid waterways and lakes. Some areas constitute important exceptions to this description, however: the moderate maritime climate of Kaliningrad Oblast on the Baltic Sea is similar to that of the American Northwest; the Russian Far East, under the influence of the Pacific Ocean, has a monsoonal climate that reverses the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>wind</b> in summer and winter, sharply differentiating temperatures; and a narrow, subtropical band of territory provides Russia's most popular summer resort area on the Black Sea.|$|E

50|$|In sedimentology, {{winnowing}} is {{the natural}} removal of fine material from a coarser sediment by wind or flowing water. Once a sediment has been deposited, subsequent changes in the speed or <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>wind</b> or water flowing over it can agitate the grains in the sediment and allow the preferential removal of the finer grains. This action can improve the sorting and increase the mean grain size of a sediment {{after it has been}} deposited.|$|E

5000|$|Temperature advection: {{change of}} {{temperature}} in {{a layer of}} air can be calculated by the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wind</b> at that level and the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wind</b> shear with the next level. In the northern hemisphere, warm air is to the right <b>of</b> a <b>wind</b> shear between levels in the atmosphere. The opposite is true in the southern one (see thermal wind).

Headwind and Tailwind are opposite interpretations of the wind component which {{is parallel to the}} direction of travel, while Crosswind represents the perpendicular component. Determining the ground speed of an aircraft requires the calculation of the head or tailwind.|$|E
50|$|The {{olfactory}} navigation hypothesis {{states that}} pigeons learn an odour map by associating smells perceived {{at the home}} loft with the directions from which they are carried by winds. Therefore, attempts to manipulate the development of that have involved changing the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>wind,</b> shielding birds from winds of a certain direction and exposing the pigeons to artificial odorants. The predication is that the experimental pigeons should learn an altered map and thus when released, they should fly according to their distorted perception.|$|E
50|$|Solar {{energy from}} the Sun creates {{temperature}} differentials that result in wind. The interaction between wind and the surface of water creates waves, which are larger {{when there is a}} greater distance for them to build up. Wave energy potential is greatest between 30° and 60° latitude in both hemispheres on the west coast because of the global <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>wind.</b> When evaluating wave energy as a technology type, it is important to distinguish between the four most common approaches: point absorber buoys, surface attenuators, oscillating water columns, and overtopping devices.|$|E

Near rocks, you may see (or swim over) black sea urchins that have 15 - 30 cm radius and many thin black spines about 30 - 50 cm long. Locals say that the spines contain small needles and poison: if one touches the spines and is stuck by a needle, the needle should be crushed with a rock. The poison is only irritating and not lethal. In Thai, the name is hoi men (หอยเม่น).|$|E
