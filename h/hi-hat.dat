5|$|Moon further {{strengthened}} {{the reversal of}} traditional rock instrumentation by playing lead parts on his drums. His style was at odds with British rock contemporaries such as The Kinks' Mick Avory and The Shadows' Brian Bennett who did not consider tom-toms necessary for rock music. Moon used Premier kits starting in 1966. He avoided the <b>hi-hat,</b> and concentrated on a mix of tom rolls and cymbals.|$|E
5|$|Moon {{played a}} four, then a five-piece drum kit during his early career. His 1965 set {{consisted}} of Ludwig drums and Zildjian cymbals. By 1966, feeling limited {{by this setup}} and inspired by Ginger Baker's double bass drum, he switched to a larger Premier kit. This setup {{did not have a}} <b>hi-hat,</b> since Moon used crash and ride cymbals instead. He remained a loyal customer of Premier.|$|E
5|$|The 808 was {{followed}} in 1983 by the TR-909, the first Roland drum machine to use samples (for its cymbal and <b>hi-hat</b> sounds) alongside analog sounds. In the 1990s, Roland included {{samples of the}} 808 in its successful Groovebox devices. In February 2014, Roland announced the TR-8 drum machine, which recreates the 808 and 909 {{through a combination of}} modeling and sampling. In August 2017, Roland announced the TR-08, a miniaturized 808 reissue with features including an LED display, MIDI and USB connections, expanded sequencer control, and a built-in speaker.|$|E

5|$|Tensions run {{high among}} the band members, as Joey begins seducing Imelda, Natalie and Bernie, and Deco grows {{increasingly}} obnoxious and unruly. The band performs at another venue where, {{at the end}} of one song, Billy accidentally knocks over his <b>hi-hat</b> cymbals, leading to a heated argument between him and Deco. Billy leaves the band in fear of going to jail if he beats up Deco—much to Jimmy's frustration—and Mickah replaces him as the band's drummer. During the band's next performance at a roller disco, Jimmy is confronted by Duffy, who demands payment for the equipment he provided the band. Mickah intervenes and violently attacks Duffy, who is escorted out. Jimmy then goes on stage and introduces the band, which elicits boisterous cheers from the audience.|$|E
25|$|When using {{a double}} bass drum pedal, the foot which {{normally}} controls the <b>hi-hat</b> pedal {{moves to the}} second bass drum pedal, and so the hi hat opens and remains open. A closed <b>hi-hat</b> sound can be more useful for some genres of music, so drummers use a drop clutch to keep the cymbals closed without use of the pedal.|$|E

25|$|In an {{extended}} kit, additional pairs of <b>hi-hat</b> cymbals may be operated remotely by a cable hat, or held closed by an X-hat adaptor.|$|E
25|$|Most disco songs have {{a steady}} four-on-the-floor beat, a quaver or semi-quaver <b>hi-hat</b> pattern {{with an open}} <b>hi-hat</b> on the off-beat, and a heavy, syncopated bass line. Other Latin rhythms such as the rhumba, the samba and the cha-cha-cha are also found in disco recordings, and Latin polyrhythms, such as a rhumba beat layered over a merengue, are commonplace. The quaver pattern is often {{supported}} by other instruments such as the rhythm guitar and may be implied rather than explicitly present.|$|E
25|$|The LM-1 {{featured}} twelve 8 bit 28kHz samples: kick, snare, <b>hi-hat,</b> cabasa, tambourine, two toms, two congas, cowbell, claves, {{and hand}} claps, but no ride or crash cymbals.|$|E
50|$|All drums {{except for}} the <b>hi-hats</b> and cymbals are {{synthetically}} generated; there is an oscillator circuit with a dedicated filter and envelope curve. The <b>hi-hats</b> and cymbals are 6-bit samples, compressed and combined with a volume envelope curve (and tuning) to allow slight modification. Thanks to the analog circuitry, {{various aspects of the}} drum sound can be modified (pitch, attack, decay).|$|R

25|$|Typical {{compositions}} have a {{tempo of}} 160 to 180 BPM, {{and use a}} 4/4 signature. Tracks can be instrumental, or use a short repeated sample at certain points. Singing is uncommon. Brown uses a regimented structure with components occurring for a fixed length. e.g.: beat solo, bouncy with beat, <b>hi-hat</b> added, riff solo, riff with beat, <b>hi-hat</b> added, etc. each lasting 8-bars. These parts would be pieced together with short fills and rolls. Drum kicks are slightly distorted, like gabber. Breakbeat patterns may also occur briefly in the background at certain points.|$|E
25|$|Hardware is {{the name}} given to the metal stands that support the drums, cymbals and other {{percussion}} instruments. Generally the term also includes the <b>hi-hat</b> pedal and bass drum pedal or pedals, and the drum stool, but not the drum sticks.|$|E
25|$|Occasionally, the {{hardware}} is used percussively as well, {{the most common}} example being a rim shot. John Morrison is noted for his drum solos played entirely on a <b>hi-hat</b> stand (and occasionally also on {{other parts of the}} kit hardware, adjacent furniture, and audience).|$|E

25|$|In 1900, Sonor drum company {{introduced}} its first single bass drum pedal. William F. Ludwig made the bass drum pedal workable in 1909, {{paving the way}} for the modern drum kit. A bass drum pedal operates much the same as the <b>hi-hat</b> control; a footplate is pressed to pull a chain, belt, or metal drive mechanism downward, bringing a beater or mallet forward into the drumhead. The beater head is usually made of either felt, wood, plastic, or rubber and is attached to a rod-shaped metal shaft. The pedal and beater system are mounted in a metal frame and like the <b>hi-hat,</b> a tension unit controls the amount of pressure needed to strike and the amount of recoil upon release.|$|E
25|$|His best-selling drum {{instruction}} book The Realistic Rock Drum Method {{was first published}} in 1972, and has since been revised and republished as The Ultimate Realistic Rock Drum Method. It covers the basic subjects of rock rhythms and polyrhythms, linear rudiments and groupings, shuffle rhythms, <b>hi-hat,</b> and double bass drum exercises.|$|E
25|$|Reggae drummers often {{involved}} {{these three}} tips for other reggae performers: (1) go for open, ringing tones when playing ska and rocksteady, (2) use any available material to stuff the bass drum {{so that it}} tightens up the kick to a deep, punchy thud, and (3) go without a ride cymbal, focusing on the <b>hi-hat</b> for timekeeping and thin crashes with fast decay for accents.|$|E

5000|$|In Issue 108 of MusicTech Magazine from March 2013, it was {{suggested}} that future garage should employ repitched vocals, soft leads with a round attack or an acoustic lead, subbass or a square wave bass with a modulating filter, and a four-to-the-floor or 2-step garage drum beat with off-the-grid <b>hi-hats.</b> The distinct swing in future garage drum beats is the focus on [...] "late" [...] or humanized <b>hi-hats</b> between the kick and snare patterns.|$|R

25|$|Bonham used Paiste cymbals and Remo drumheads. His {{hardware}} was {{a mixture}} of Rogers and Ludwig, including the Ludwig Speed King pedal and Rogers Swiv-O-Matic series of hardware. Initially augmenting his kit in live performances with timbales and congas as well as the cowbell, he soon settled on his trademark timpani, gong and ching-ring mounted on his <b>hi-hat</b> stand as the percussion in his setup in addition to the aforementioned cowbell.|$|E
25|$|The {{equipment}} of the drummers {{in these}} groups was of particular {{significance in the}} development of early drum sets. Cymbals, bass, and snare drums were all used. Indeed, a method of damping a set of cymbals by crunching them together while playing bass drum simultaneously is probably how today's <b>hi-hat,</b> a major part of today's drum set, came about. Military technique and instrumentation were undoubtedly factors {{in the development of}} early jazz and its drumming, but the melodic and metric elements in jazz are more easily traced to the dance bands of the time period.|$|E
25|$|The {{main drum}} part is almost universally in common time (4/4); meaning 4 quarter note pulses per bar. In its {{simplest}} form, time is marked with kicks (bass drum beats) on each quarter-note pulse, a snare or clap {{on the second}} and fourth pulse of the bar, with an open <b>hi-hat</b> sound every second eighth note. This is essentially a disco (or even polka) drum pattern and is common throughout house and trance music as well. The tempo tends to vary between approximately 120 bpm (quarter note equals 120 pulses per minute) and 150 bpm, depending on the style of techno.|$|E
