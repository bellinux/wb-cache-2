500|$|On 29July2015, a <b>flaperon</b> from Flight 370 was {{discovered}} on Reunion Island. The ATSB reviewed their drift calculations for {{debris from the}} aircraft and, according to the JACC, they are [...] "satisfied that {{the discovery of the}} <b>flaperon</b> at La Réunion...is consistent with the current underwater search area in the southern Indian Ocean." [...] Reverse drift modelling of the debris, to determine its origin after 16 months, also supports the current underwater search area, although reverse drift modelling is very imprecise over long periods of time.|$|E
500|$|The first item {{of debris}} {{identified}} as coming from flight 370 {{was the right}} <b>flaperon</b> (a trailing edge control surface). It was discovered {{at the end of}} July 2015 on a beach in Saint-André, on Réunion, an island in the western Indian Ocean, about [...] west of the underwater search area. It was transported from Réunion—an overseas department of France—to Toulouse, where it was examined by France's civil aviation accident investigation agency, the Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses pour la Sécurité de l'Aviation Civile (BEA), and a French defence ministry laboratory. Malaysia sent investigators to both Réunion and Toulouse. On 3 September, French officials announced that serial numbers found on internal components of the <b>flaperon</b> link it [...] "with certainty" [...] to Flight 370. These serial numbers were retrieved via borescope.|$|E
5000|$|On a {{plane with}} <b>flaperons,</b> the pilot {{still has the}} {{standard}} separate controls for ailerons and flaps, but the flap control also varies the flaperon's range of movement. A mechanical device called a [...] "mixer" [...] is used to combine the pilot's input into the <b>flaperons.</b> While the use of <b>flaperons</b> rather than ailerons and flaps {{might seem to be}} a simplification, some complexity remains through the intricacies of the mixer.|$|R

500|$|After {{discovery}} of the <b>flaperon,</b> French police conducted {{a search of the}} waters around Réunion for additional debris, and came across a damaged suitcase which might [...] be associated with Flight 370. The location is consistent with models of debris dispersal 16months after an origin in the current search area, off the west coast of Australia. A Chinese water bottle and an Indonesian cleaning product were found in the same area.|$|E
500|$|In late February 2016, {{an object}} (with a stencilled text [...] "NO STEP" [...] on it) was found {{off the coast}} of Mozambique; early {{photographic}} analysis suggested it could have come from the aircraft's horizontal stabiliser or the leading edges of the wings. It was found by Blaine Gibson on a sandbank in the Mozambique Channel, between Mozambique in eastern Africa and Madagascar; and in the same part of the southern Indian Ocean where the <b>flaperon</b> had been found the previous July. The fragment was sent to Australia where experts identified it as almost certainly a horizontal stabilizer panel from MH370.|$|E
500|$|An {{analysis}} by the ATSB comparing the evidence available for Flight 370 with three categories of accidents—an in-flight upset (e.g., stall), a glide event (e.g., engine failure, fuel exhaustion), and an unresponsive crew or hypoxia event—concluded that an unresponsive crew or hypoxia event [...] "best fit the available evidence" [...] for the five-hour period of the flight as it travelled south over the Indian Ocean without communication or significant deviations in its track, likely on autopilot. No consensus exists among investigators on the unresponsive crew or hypoxia theory. If no control inputs were made following flameout and the disengagement of autopilot, the aircraft would likely have entered a spiral dive and entered the ocean within [...] of the flameout and disengagement of autopilot. The analysis of the <b>flaperon</b> showed that the landing flaps were not extended, supporting the spiral dive at high speed.|$|E

500|$|The {{governments of}} Malaysia, China, and Australia agreed to {{thoroughly}} search [...] of seafloor. [...] This {{phase of the}} search, which began on 6 October 2014, used three vessels equipped with towed deep-water vehicles that use side-scan sonar, multi-beam echo sounders, and video cameras to locate and identify aircraft debris. A fourth vessel participated in the search between January–May 2015; it had an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to search areas which cannot be effectively searched by equipment on the other vessels. Following {{the discovery of the}} <b>flaperon</b> on Réunion, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) reviewed its drift calculations for debris from the aircraft and, according to the JACC, was satisfied that the search area was still the most likely crash site. Reverse drift modelling of the debris, to determine its origin after 16 months, also supported the underwater search area, although reverse drift modelling is very imprecise over long periods. However, on 17 January 2017 Malaysia, China, and Australia jointly announced the suspension of the search for Flight 370.|$|E
2500|$|On 5 August, the Malaysian Prime Minister {{announced}} that experts have [...] "conclusively confirmed" [...] that the debris found on 29 July is from Flight 370; the debris {{is the first}} physical evidence that Flight 370 ended in the Indian Ocean.

Malaysia is sending investigators to both Réunion and Toulouse. Furthermore, French police are conducting a search of the waters around Réunion for additional debris, and the Malaysian Transportation Minister, Liow Tiong Lai, asked countries near Réunion, including Mauritius, for assistance in the search for debris.|$|E

Although the whereabouts of the plane remain unknown, satellite data indicates that the plane {{was lost in the}} Southern Indian Ocean and all 239 people on board perished. On 5 August 2015 the Malaysian government confirmed a <b>flaperon</b> from a 777 found washed up on Réunion Island belonged to Flight 370.

The underwater search {{of this area}} began on 5 October 2014 {{at a cost of}} A$60million (approximately US$56million or €41million). With no significant delays, the search of the priority search-area was to be completed around May 2015. On 29 July 2015, a piece of marine debris, later confirmed to be a <b>flaperon</b> from Flight 370, was found on Réunion Island. The most recent finding by the search authorities, announced on 20 December 2016, was that an unsearched area of around , and approximately centred on location , was the most likely impact location for flight MH370. The search was suspended on 17 January 2017.|$|E
2500|$|When {{flying in}} {{airplane}} mode, {{the majority of}} lift is produced by the AW609's wings, which are slightly forward-swept. Both the wing and the main fuselage are made largely of composite materials. The [...] wings feature <b>flaperon</b> control surfaces which are normally automatically controlled; in vertical flight, the flaperons drop to a 66-degree downwards angle to reduce the wing area being encountered by downwash from the proprotors. A high-mounted rudderless vertical stabiliser is attached {{the rear of the}} fuselage to stabilise flight while in aircraft mode. In the event of a single engine failure, either engine can provide power to both proprotors via a drive shaft; the AW609 is also capable of autorotation. The AW609 has been designed to develop Full Transport Category/Class 1 performance to operate safely even when flown under single engine conditions. It is equipped with a de-icing system, and is to be certified for flying into known icing conditions. Building on experiences with the V-22, the AW609 is outfitted with a sink rate warning system.|$|E
2500|$|Since the new {{aircraft}} {{would require a}} significant amount of engineering work in untested waters, the first order placed was actually for a one-third scale version of the XB-35 dubbed the Northrop N-9M (M standing for model). This aircraft would be used to gather flight test data on the Flying Wing design, which would then be used in designing the big XB-35. It would also be used as a flight trainer, to familiarize pilots with the radical, all-wing concept. Early in 1942, design work on the XB-35 itself began in earnest. Unlike conventional aircraft, truly [...] "tailless" [...] flying wings cannot use a rudder for lateral control as it was absent, so a set of clamshell-like, double split flaps (so called <b>flaperon,</b> a portmanteau of flap and aileron) on the trailing edge of the wingtips were used. When aileron control was input, they were deflected up or down as a single unit, just like an aileron. When rudder input was made, the two surfaces on one side opened, top and bottom, creating drag, and yawing the aircraft. By applying input to both rudder pedals, both sets of surfaces were deployed creating drag so that the airspeed or the glide angle could be manipulated.|$|E

50|$|A variable-position {{horizontal}} stabilizer changes the pitch simultaneously with the <b>flaperon</b> setting.Normally the {{horizontal stabilizer}} {{also known as}} tailplane is fixed and has a hinged elevator, a stabilator is another method that combines the functions of an elevator and a horizontal stabilizer.The variable-position horizontal stabilizer is governed by the <b>flaperon</b> setting: the settings of the <b>flaperon</b> control produce corresponding changes to the stabilizer angle of incidence, thus defining the trim airspeed {{in relation to the}} <b>flaperon</b> requirements. The conventional elevator remains in trail, minimizing trim drag.Flaperon settings are used to optimize the lift and drag of a wing. When the flight requires low speed the flaperons are in a positive position and when the flight requires high speed flaperons are in a negative position.|$|E
50|$|A <b>flaperon</b> (a {{portmanteau}} word) on an aircraft's wing {{is a type}} {{of control}} surface that combines the functions of both flaps and ailerons.
