25|$|Horthy's {{personal}} views on Jews {{and their role}} in Hungarian society {{are the subject of}} some debate. In an October 1940 letter to Prime Minister Pál Teleki, Horthy echoed a widespread national sentiment: that Jews enjoyed too much success in commerce, the professions, and industry – success that needed to be curtailed:As regards the Jewish problem, I have been an anti-Semite throughout my life. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> contact with Jews. I have considered it intolerable that here in Hungary everything, every factory, bank, large fortune, business, theatre, press, commerce, etc. should be in Jewish hands, and that the Jew should be the image reflected of Hungary, especially abroad. Since, however, {{one of the most important}} tasks of the government is to raise the standard of living, i.e., we have to acquire wealth, it is impossible, in a year or two, to replace the Jews, who have everything in their hands, and to replace them with incompetent, unworthy, mostly big-mouthed elements, for we should become bankrupt. This requires a generation at least.|$|E
500|$|A {{period of}} hard work for Verdi—with the {{creation}} of twenty operas (excluding revisions and translations)—followed over the next sixteen years, culminating in Un ballo in maschera. This period was not without its frustrations and setbacks for the young composer, and he was frequently demoralised. In April 1845, in connection with I due Foscari, he wrote: [...] "I am happy, no matter what reception it gets, and I am utterly indifferent to everything. I cannot wait for these next three years to pass. I have to write six operas, then addio to everything." [...] In 1858 Verdi complained: [...] "Since Nabucco, you may say, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> one hour of peace. Sixteen years in the galleys." ...|$|E

6000|$|<b>I</b> confess <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> such a {{question}} asked me before, nor <b>had</b> <b>I</b> ever canvassed it. I was quite taken aback, and before I could find myself had sillily stammered, “I—I am a gentleman.” ...|$|R
500|$|The murder investigation, named Operation Green, {{was led by}} Sir Edward Crewe, Chief Constable of West Midlands Police, and {{included}} 100 police officers and 50 support staff from the West Midlands and West Mercia forces. Detectives viewed {{hundreds of hours of}} CCTV footage, gathered more than 100 separate exhibits and interviewed witnesses. Evidence was analysed by scientists from the Forensic Science Service (FSS) in Birmingham. Martin Whittaker, the scientist who headed the FSS team, spoke of the huge volume of evidence: [...] "The team pulled together every strand of forensic evidence to create a kind of 'spider's web' and in the centre of it all... was Philip Smith. In 20 years of working for the FSS, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> to deal with so much evidence in relation to one suspect. It was quite overwhelming." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 2010, when Jill's adoptive mother, Liz Foster (Julianna McCarthy), died, it {{was then}} learned that her {{biological}} father was Neil Fenmore. Walton stated: [...] "Liz was the dream mother for Jill. She always could handle Jill." [...] During an interview with On-Air On-Soaps speaking about how her character has been thrown in different directions, Walton said: [...] "It used to bother me. I would try and keep a steady course with it, and now I can’t. Now I just roll with the punches. It’s impossible." [...] Walton noted that Jill was finally {{happy to have a}} blood relative through Neil's other daughter, Lauren Fenmore (Tracey E. Bregman). She said: [...] "Liz dies within a week {{and all of a sudden}} it’s, 'I am a Fenmore'. And we really didn’t have a chance to explore it much, but in real life that happens. My first thought as Jill is, 'I actually know who my blood is, and I have a sister.' And, Jill was very moved and touched and shocked from the death of Liz, but full of love for her sister." [...] On her relationship with Lauren, Walton stated that, [...] "Most people don’t like Jill, and she hasn’t particularly loved Lauren. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> that much to do with Lauren, really." [...] Nekeeta Borden of Zap2it noted: [...] "The redhead told Jill in no uncertain terms that she intended to keep her father’s memory, and only child status, firmly in tact [...] and had no interest in a close relationship." [...] Borden also noted that Jill always wanted a sense of belonging, which prompted her to legally change her name to Jill Fenmore. The sisters were initially bitter towards each other having to share half of the Fenmore Boutique, but have since gotten closer. Walton said that, [...] "From my point of view, I think that Lauren has a really big heart; she's a naturally lovely person. Lauren was really awful a few times, and that just came out of her pain. So, it looks like Lauren and Jill are kind of getting along okay, but there's nothing else coming up in the scripts for them yet." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{was during}} this period of turmoil that Verdi was to {{describe}} the previous sixteen years of his composing life: in a letter to Countess Clara Maffei, he states: [...] "From Nabucco, you may say, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> one hour of peace. Sixteen years in the galleys!" ...|$|E
60|$|To sit in {{a narrow}} boat like our dugout day after day, not daring to move lest she should be overset, is real labor. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> much {{experience}} in such traveling, and felt that I really needed no more.|$|R
6000|$|Mary Sloane {{was very}} much pleased at Hugh's visit. She had always resented the fact that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> a [...] "beau," [...] seeming to think it {{reflected}} some slight or disparagement upon me. She did all she could to encourage him.|$|R
60|$|I can, indeed. If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>I</b> should <b>never</b> <b>have</b> taken such an unconscionably {{long time}} about it.|$|R
2500|$|... "In {{not seeking}} public {{approval}} or attempting to 'build a following,' no doubt I have sometimes not been careful enough {{about trying to}} be tactful, discreet, and wise {{in dealing with the}} public. [...] I certainly have never tried to avoid meeting an issue head-on, and I have always been honest and frank in my public statements. [...] This {{may not be the most}} politic course of action, but then <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> a politician's ambition." ...|$|E
2500|$|Responding to {{opposition}} {{criticism of}} his wife's fund-raising activities voiced in the House of Assembly, he bristled, [...] "Mr. Speaker, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> plans to cross this aisle, but in recent weeks that Honourable Member has said {{a few things that}} would encourage me to do so. [...] I say to that Honourable Member that I would like to stay {{on this side of the}} House and not have come to the other side because it wouldn't be in order to vote for the UBP." ...|$|E
2500|$|Adele and Tedder {{arranged}} a second meeting and reconvened at Serenity West Studios in Los Angeles weeks later {{to write and}} record [...] "Rumour Has It." [...] In an interview, Tedder recalled his astonishment at the singer's musicality and vocal prowess after she completed the main vocals to the song in 10minutes: [...] "She sang it once top to bottom, pitch perfect, she didn't miss a note. I looked at the engineer then at her and said, 'Adele I don't {{know what to tell}} you but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> anyone do that in ten years'." ...|$|E
5000|$|Lee Israel died on December 24, 2014 from myeloma in New York City. According to her New York Times obituary, she {{had lived}} alone and had no children. Regarding her family, she wrote in her memoir, [...] "I had a brother with whom <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> much in common." ...|$|R
60|$|For a while I did {{not seem}} to believe it; this {{obviously}} imminent event stunned me when it came, as though <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> an anticipatory moment. For a while I went on working, and then almost apathetically, in a mood of half-reluctant curiosity, I started for Lowchester.|$|R
60|$|This {{uplifting}} illusion {{made him}} inquisitorial and peremptory. And as his temperament was choleric there were fellows who were actually afraid of him. He was redoubtable, not in {{virtue of his}} office, but because of his unwarrantable assumptions. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> {{anything to do with}} him before.|$|R
2500|$|Tunku {{opened his}} speech in Parliament with the words, [...] "In all the 10 {{years of my}} {{leadership}} of this House <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> a duty so unpleasant as this to perform. The announcement which I am making concerns the separation of Singapore {{from the rest of}} the Federation." [...] On that day, a tearful Lee Kuan Yew announced that Singapore was a sovereign, independent nation and assumed the role of prime minister of the new nation. His speech included this quote: [...] "For me, it is a moment of anguish. All my life, my whole adult life, I have believed in merger and unity of the two territories." [...] Hence, Singapore became the only country in the history of the modern world to gain independence against its own will. After the separation and independence of Singapore in 1965, the Singapore branch of UMNO was renamed the Singapore Malay National Organisation (Pertubuhan Kebangsaan Melayu Singapura).|$|E
2500|$|Tedder had {{expressed}} interest in collaborating with Adele after they met at the 2009 Grammy Awards ceremony in February. He arrived four hours early to their first studio session, buying time to better familiarise himself with some of her previous work. In 2010, Tedder was featured on Far East Movement's 2010 hit single [...] "Rocketeer". Although unaware of Adele's personal predicament, he composed the opening piano sequence and first few lines to what became the lovelorn ballad [...] "Turning Tables". Adele and Tedder arranged a second meeting and reconvened at Serenity West Studios in Los Angeles weeks later to write and record [...] "Rumour Has It". In an interview, Tedder recalled his astonishment at the singer's musicality and vocal prowess after she completed the main vocals to the song in 10 minutes: [...] "She sang it once top to bottom, pitch perfect, she didn't miss a note. I looked at the engineer then at her and said, 'Adele, I don't {{know what to tell}} you but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> anyone do that in ten years'." [...] His work with Adele brought him a Grammy Award for Album of the Year at the 2012 Grammy Awards.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the praise}} from the England side, Pietersen {{claimed he was}} dropped from the Natal first team. Pietersen {{felt that this was}} due to the country's racial quota system, in which provincial sides were {{required}} to have at least four black players. Pietersen's view was that players should be judged on merit, and described it as [...] "heartbreaking" [...] when he was left out of the side, although he later reflected [...] "it turned out {{it was the best thing}} that could have happened". Pietersen has since firmly criticised the quota system, which he feels forced him out of the country of his birth. He has also criticised Graeme Smith, who became captain of the South African side in 2003, calling him [...] "an absolute muppet, childish and strange" [...] and that his behaviour [...] "leaves a lot to be desired". Smith opposed this, saying, [...] "I'm patriotic about my country, and that's why I don't like Kevin Pietersen. The only reason that Kevin and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> a relationship is because he slated South Africa". Pietersen's outspoken views published in his autobiography, Crossing the Boundary, in September 2006, and in an interview for the South African edition of GQ magazine, led to unsuccessful calls for an ICC investigation regarding bringing the game into disrepute.|$|E
60|$|In {{the night}} the clock gave us another warning, and my wife {{accepted}} it for her Aunt Maria, and seemed resigned.

60|$|The {{three men}} {{in control of}} the reorganized firm of Harper and Bros., George Harvey, Frederick Duneka and Frank Leigh, all professed a firm belief in The Captain of the Gray Horse Troop, and promised me such a boost as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>had.</b> This promise they set about to fulfill.|$|R
60|$|Ordinarily Dan is the swiftest of boatmen. To-day he was {{slower than}} {{molasses}} {{and all he}} did went wrong.

60|$|It is {{generally}} the custom with man-of-war's-men to stand obsequiously touching their hat at every sentence they {{address to the}} Captain.
