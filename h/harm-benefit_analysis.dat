Available from the Home Office via the link in this recordReport of our review of the {{processes}} of <b>harm-benefit</b> <b>analysis</b> (HBA) carried out under the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (A(SP) A). Report of the Animals in Science Committee <b>Harm-Benefit</b> <b>Analysis</b> Sub-Group chaired by Professor Gail Davies. The Animals in Science Committee <b>Harm-Benefit</b> <b>Analysis</b> subgroup, chaired by Professor Gail Davies, has produced a review of the <b>harm-benefit</b> <b>analysis</b> (HBA). This review is an analysis of the underpinnings and implementation of the HBA which remains a crucial step in the justification of the use of animals in science. It is published in response to a ministerial commission. Animals in Science Committe...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{the present}} chapter is to open up for {{discussion}} {{some of the major}} ethical issues involved in animal-based neuroscience research. We begin by approaching the question of the moral acceptability of the use of animals in research at all, exploring the implications of three different ethical theories: contractarianism, utilitarianism and animal rights. In the remainder of the chapter we discuss more specific issues of neuroscience research within what we argue is the mainstream framework for research animal ethics, namely one based on <b>harm-benefit</b> <b>analysis.</b> We explore issues of harms and benefits and how to balance them as well as how to reduce harm and increase benefit within neuroscience research...|$|E
40|$|AbstractEthics {{on animal}} use in science in Western society {{is based on}} utilitarianism, {{weighing}} the harms and benefits to the animals involved against those of the intended human beneficiaries. The 3 Rs concept (Replacement, Reduction, Refinement) is both a robust framework for minimizing animal use and suffering (addressing the harms to animals) and a means of supporting high quality science and translation (addressing the benefits). The ambiguity of basic research performed early in the research continuum can sometimes make <b>harm-benefit</b> <b>analysis</b> more difficult since anticipated benefit is often an incremental contribution to a field of knowledge. On the other hand, benefit is much more evident in translational research aimed at developing treatments for direct application in humans or animals suffering from disease. Though benefit may be easier to define, it should certainly not be considered automatic. Issues related to model validity seriously compromise experiments and have been implicated as a major impediment in translation, especially in complex disease models where harms to animals can be intensified. Increased investment and activity in the 3 Rs is delivering new research models, tools and approaches with reduced reliance on animal use, improved animal welfare, and improved scientific and predictive value...|$|E
40|$|Accumulating {{evidence}} indicates {{high risk of}} bias in preclinical animal research, questioning the scientific validity and reproducibility of published research findings. Systematic reviews found low rates of reporting of measures against risks of bias in the published literature (e. g., randomization, blinding, sample size calculation) and a correlation between low reporting rates and inflated treatment effects. That most animal research undergoes peer review or ethical review would offer the possibility to detect risks of bias at an earlier stage, before the research has been conducted. For example, in Switzerland, animal experiments are licensed based on {{a detailed description of}} the study protocol and a <b>harm-benefit</b> <b>analysis.</b> We therefore screened applications for animal experiments submitted to Swiss authorities (n = 1, 277) for the rates at which the use of seven basic measures against bias (allocation concealment, blinding, randomization, sample size calculation, inclusion/exclusion criteria, primary outcome variable, and statistical analysis plan) were described and compared them with the reporting rates of the same measures in a representative sub-sample of publications (n = 50) resulting from studies described in these applications. Measures against bias were described at very low rates, ranging on average from 2. 4 % for statistical analysis plan to 19 % for primary outcome variable in applications for animal experiments, and from 0. 0 % for sample size calculation to 34 % for statistical analysis plan in publications from these experiments. Calculating an internal validity score (IVS) based on the proportion of the seven measures against bias, we found a weak positive correlation between the IVS of applications and that of publications (Spearman's rho = 0. 34, p = 0. 014), indicating that the rates of description of these measures in applications partly predict their rates of reporting in publications. These results indicate that the authorities licensing animal experiments are lacking important information about experimental conduct that determines the scientific validity of the findings, which may be critical for the weight attributed to the benefit of the research in the <b>harm-benefit</b> <b>analysis.</b> Similar to manuscripts getting accepted for publication despite poor reporting of measures against bias, applications for animal experiments may often be approved based on implicit confidence rather than explicit evidence of scientific rigor. Our findings shed serious doubt on the current authorization procedure for animal experiments, as well as the peer-review process for scientific publications, which in the long run may undermine the credibility of research. Developing existing authorization procedures that are already in place in many countries towards a preregistration system for animal research is one promising way to reform the system. This would not only benefit the scientific validity of findings from animal experiments but also help to avoid unnecessary harm to animals for inconclusive research...|$|E
40|$|Improving {{laboratory}} animal science and welfare requires both new {{scientific research and}} insights from enquiry in the {{humanities and social sciences}}. Whilst scientific research provides evidence to replace, reduce and refine procedures involving {{laboratory animal}}s (the ‘ 3 Rs’), work in the humanities and social sciences can help understand the social, economic and cultural processes that enhance or impede humane ways of knowing and working with laboratory animals. However, communication across these disciplinary perspectives is currently limited, and they frame questions, generate results, engage users, and seek to influence policy in different ways. To facilitate dialogue and future research at this interface, we convened an interdisciplinary group of 45 life scientists, social scientists, humanities scholars, non-governmental organisations and policy-makers to generate a collaborative research agenda. This drew on other agenda-setting exercises in science policy, using a collaborative and deliberative approach for the identification of research priorities. Participants were recruited from across the community, invited to submit research questions and vote on their priorities. They then met at an interactive workshop in the UK, discussed all 136 questions submitted, and collectively defined the 30 most important issues for the group. The output is a collaborative future agenda for research in the humanities and social sciences on laboratory animal science and welfare. The questions indicate a demand for new research in the humanities and social sciences to inform emerging discussions and priorities on the governance and practice of laboratory animal research, including around: international harmonisation, openness and public engagement, ‘cultures of care’, <b>harm-benefit</b> <b>analysis</b> {{and the future of the}} 3 Rs. The process underlines the value of interdisciplinary exchange for improving mutual understanding of different research cultures and identifies ways of enhancing the effectiveness of future research at the interface between the humanities, social sciences, science and science policy...|$|E
