The decoration combines traditional Christian iconography with the ornate swirling motifs typical of Insular art.

Many of these minor decorative elements are imbued with Christian symbolism and so further emphasise the themes of the major illustrations.|$|E
5|$|The Avro Museum , based out of CYBW west of Calgary, Alberta, Canada is {{building}} a 2/3rd scale, manned, high performance flying replica of the Avro Arrow (officially known as ARROW II) to Canadian Aviation Experimental Aircraft Regulations {{in order to become}} an airshow demonstration aircraft. Construction began in October 2007, and by 2012 the fuselage was completed and passed its first MDRA inspection, and now has a serial number. Powered by a pair of Pratt & Whitney JT-15D-4s, the ARROW II will have a top speed of approximately 500 <b>knots</b> <b>and</b> a range of 1,800 miles. Current projections show a final cost of the project at approximately one million dollars and it is hoped that ground tests will start in about 2016 with the first flight to follow.|$|E
5|$|M36 (NGC 1960) {{is a young}} galactic {{open cluster}} with {{approximately}} 60 stars, {{most of which are}} relatively bright; however, only about 40 stars are visible in most amateur instruments. It is at a distance of 3,900 light-years and has an overall magnitude of 6.0; it is 14 light-years wide. Its apparent diameter is 12.0 arcminutes. Of the three open clusters in Auriga, M36 is both the smallest and the most concentrated, though its brightest stars are approximately 9th magnitude. It was discovered in 1749 by Guillaume Le Gentil, the first of Auriga's major open clusters to be discovered. M36 features a 10-arcminute-wide knot of bright stars in its center, anchored by Struve 737, a double star with components separated by 10.7 arcseconds. Most of the stars in M36 are B type stars with rapid rates of rotation. M36's Trumpler class is given as both I 3 r and II 3 m. Besides the central knot, most of the cluster's other stars appear in smaller <b>knots</b> <b>and</b> groups.|$|E

5|$|The {{flight data}} {{recorder}} stopped recording at 22:25:40 AT (01:25:40 UTC), followed one second later by the cockpit voice recorder. The aircraft briefly appeared again on radar screens from 22:25:50 AT (01:25:50 UTC) to 22:26:04 AT (01:26:04 UTC). The last altitude recorded was 9,700 feet. According to the cockpit voice recorder, shortly after the first emergency declaration, the captain left his seat to fight the fire that was spreading {{to the rear of}} the cockpit; the Swissair volume of checklists was later found fused together in the wreckage, indicating that the captain may have attempted to use them to fan back the flames. The captain did not return to his seat; whether he was killed by the fire, asphyxiated by the smoke, or killed in the crash is not known. Flight data recording shows that engine two was shut down due to an engine fire approximately one minute before impact, implying that the first officer was still alive and continued trying to fly the aircraft until the final moments of the flight. At 22:31:18 AT (01:31:18 UTC), the aircraft struck the ocean at an estimated speed of 345mph (555km/h, 154m/s, or 299 <b>knots)</b> <b>and</b> with a force of the order of 350g, causing the aircraft to disintegrate instantly. The crash location was approximately , +/-300meters.|$|E
5|$|Diver Rodney Joyce from Scarborough, Ontario, aged 18, {{drowned in}} a slow {{whirlpool}} effect in the pond below the waterfall on Victoria Day weekend in 1988. Joyce had been swimming for ten minutes, when he went closer to the falls to retrieve a frisbee. His brother Gregory, aged 20, rushed to help him, but was pulled under several times. Resuscitation efforts by security staff failed. In an inquest, Wonderland's director of engineering denied {{the existence of an}} undertow. A nearby life ring had been tied to a tree using three <b>knots</b> <b>and</b> was only equipped with 6 metres (20feet) of rope, not enough to reach the middle of the pool. One high diver, who had worked at the park for seven years, claims to have told his supervisor of the undertow during the previous season. That diver was concerned about landing someone, as he claimed unauthorized swimmers were a frequent occurrence at that time. The area was listed as barricaded in an early report, but later reports contradicted that. The witness claimed that there were 30 to 40 bathers at one time. The park's director of safety and security said he was never informed of the undertow, and only saw bathers in the pool on one occasion. Not only was there no statement about pool dangers on record, but the supervisor for the previous three years denied that anyone in their department had expressed concern. Security and extra signs were posted after the incident. Spokespeople pointed out that Joyce shouldn't have been throwing frisbees in the area and suggested that the witness shouldn't have continued to work for the park in the previous season if they had an unaddressed concern.|$|E
5|$|Lion was hit twice more, {{during what}} came to be called the 'Run to the North', after the German battlecruisers made their own turn north. Beatty's ships {{maintained}} full speed to try to put some separation between them and the High Seas Fleet and gradually moved out of range. They turned north and then northeast to try to rendezvous with {{the main body of the}} Grand Fleet. At 5:40pm they opened fire again on the German battlecruisers. The setting sun blinded the German gunners, and they could not make out the British ships and turned away to the northeast at 5:47. Beatty gradually turned more towards the east to allow him to cover the deployment of the Grand Fleet into its battle formation and to move ahead of it, but he mistimed his manoeuvre and forced the leading division to fall off towards the east, further away from the Germans. By 6:35 Beatty was following the 3rd BCS as they were steering east-southeast, leading the Grand Fleet, and continuing to engage Hipper's battlecruisers to their southwest. A few minutes earlier Scheer had ordered a simultaneous 180° starboard turn, and Beatty lost sight of them in the haze. At 6:44 Beatty turned his ships southeast and to the south-southeast four minutes later searching for Hipper's ships. Beatty took this opportunity to recall the two surviving ships of the 3rd BCS to take position astern of New Zealand and then slowed down to eighteen <b>knots</b> <b>and</b> altered course to the south to prevent himself from getting separated from the Grand Fleet. At this moment Lions gyrocompass failed, and she made a complete circle before her steering was brought under control again. At 6:55 Scheer ordered another 180° turn, which put them on a converging course again with the Grand Fleet, which had altered course itself to the south. This allowed the Grand Fleet to cross Scheer's T, and they badly damaged his leading ships. Scheer ordered yet another 180° turn at 7:13 in an attempt to extricate the High Seas Fleet from the trap into which he had sent them.|$|E

5|$|Theophrastus {{describes}} {{the wood of}} different trees, the effects of climate on wood, of <b>knots</b> <b>and</b> 'coiling' in timber and other differences in quality. He discusses which woods to use for specific purposes such as for carpentry, shipbuilding and for building houses, {{and the making of}} charcoal. The most useful trees are said to be silver-fir and fir, and they have the best wood in the largest sizes; the silver-fir is softer than the fir, and its wood has layers like an onion, and is made entirely of these layers. The strongest and most attractive wood is smooth, without knots. In Syria, terebinth wood is dark and close-grained, Theophrastus reports, and used both for the handles of daggers and, turned on the lathe, for making cups. He claims that the hardest timber is of oak and holm oak, while elm warps the least, so it is used for the pivots and sockets of doors, which must be straight. The wood of palms is light and soft like cork-oak, but is tougher and less brittle, so it is good for carving images. Timber from the cedar, ebony, box, olive, oak and sweet chestnut keeps well and resists decay. He asserts that Tamarisk wood from Greece is weak, but from the Arabian island of Tylos it is as strong as kermes-oak. The wood of oak and the knotted parts of fir and silver-fir are described as the hardest to work. Ships are generally made of silver-fir, fir, and Syrian cedar; in Cyprus they use Aleppo pine which is better than the fir that grows there. Theophrastus records that in the lowlands of Italy (the country of the Latins) they grow bay, myrtle and excellent beech trees long enough for the whole length of a ship.|$|E
