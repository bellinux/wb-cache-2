2500|$|For any integer n>0, {{there exists}} an Apollonian gasket {{defined by the}} {{following}} curvatures: (−n,n+1,n(n+1),n(n+1)+1). [...] For example, the gaskets defined by (−2,3,6,7), (−3,4,12,13), (−8,9,72,73), and (−9,10,90,91) all follow this pattern. [...] Because every <b>interior</b> <b>circle</b> that is defined by n+1 can become the bounding circle (defined by−n) in another gasket, these gaskets can be nested. [...] This is demonstrated in the figure at right, which contains these sequential gaskets with n running from 2 through 20.|$|E
2500|$|From its foundation, {{the team}} used a double-circled crest.

25|$|The {{figure at}} left is an {{integral}} Apollonian gasket {{that appears to have}} D3 symmetry.

2500|$|The {{height to}} the oculus and the {{diameter}} of the <b>interior</b> <b>circle</b> are the same, , so the whole interior would fit exactly within a cube (also, the interior could house a sphere [...] in diameter). These dimensions make more sense when expressed in ancient Roman units of measurement: The dome spans 150 Roman feet; the oculus is 30 Roman feet in diameter; the doorway is 40 Roman feet high. The Pantheon still holds the record for the world's largest unreinforced concrete dome. It is also substantially larger than earlier domes.|$|E
2500|$|In case (1) if {{the circles}} cut at right angles, pre- and post-multiplying g by {{elements}} of SU(1,1) {{the image of}} the unit circle can be taken to be the real axis with the points ±1 fixed. But then g is the Cayley transform and its square k is the Möbius transformation z−1. Since k H k = H−1, S contains a neighbourhood of the identity and hence is the whole of SL(2,C). If the circles do not intersect at right angles, [...] pre- and post-multiplying g by elements of SU(1,1) the points of intersection may be moved close together with 0 in the crescent formed by the obtuse angles and outside the second circle. Scaling transformations in H will transform the second circle into a touching <b>interior</b> <b>circle.</b> In between the angle will have been a right angle, for which the previous argument applies.|$|E
6000|$|Upon {{entering}} the Tropical Saloon, {{we found a}} most welcome and delightful change of temperature among those gigantic leaves of banyan-trees, and the broad expanse of water-plants, floating on lakes, and spacious aviaries, where birds of brilliant plumage sported and sang amid such foliage as they knew at home. Howbeit, the atmosphere was a little faint and sickish, perhaps owing to the odor of the half-tepid water. The most remarkable object here was {{the trunk of a}} tree, huge beyond imagination, --a pine-tree from California. It was only the stripped-off bark, however, which had been conveyed hither in segments, and put together again beyond the height of the palace roof; and the hollow <b>interior</b> <b>circle</b> of the tree was large enough to contain fifty people, I should think. We entered and sat down in all the remoteness from one another that is attainable in a good-sized drawing-room. We then ascended the gallery to get a view of this vast tree from a more elevated position, and found it looked even bigger from above. Then we loitered slowly along the gallery as far as it extended, and afterwards descended into the nave; for it was getting dusk, and a horn had sounded, and a bell rung a warning to such as delayed in the remote regions of the building. Mr. Silsbee again most kindly went in quest of the sables, but still without success. [...] . I have not much enjoyed the Crystal Palace, but think it a great and admirable achievement.|$|E

And these procedures of the Czarish Majesty have been so capricious, unintelligible, perverse, and his feeling is often enough irritation, temporary indignation,--which we know makes Verses withal! I can nowhere learn from those Prussian imbroglios of Books, what the Friedrich Sayings or Satirical Verses properly were: Retzow speaks of a PRODUKT, one at least, known in <b>interior</b> <b>Circles.</b> [Retzow, i. 34.] PRODUKT which decidedly requires publication, beyond anything Friedrich ever wrote;--though one can do without it too, and invoke Fancy in defect of Print. The sharpness of Friedrich's tongue we know; and the diligence of birds of the air. To all her other griefs against the bad man, this has given the finish in the tender Czarish bosom;--and like an envenomed drop has set the saponaceous oils (already dosed with alkali, and well in solution) foaming deliriously over the brim, in never-imagined deluges of a hatred that is unappeasable;--very costly to Friedrich and mankind.

6000|$|... "You do {{not know}} the genius of that man's country, sir," [...] {{answered}} Rashleigh;--"discretion, prudence, and foresight, are their leading qualities; these are only modified by a narrow-spirited, but yet ardent patriotism, which forms as it were the outmost of the concentric bulwarks with which a Scotchman fortifies himself against all the attacks of a generous philanthropical principle. Surmount this mound, you find an inner and still dearer barrier--the love of his province, his village, or, most probably, his clan; storm this second obstacle, you have a third--his attachment to his own family--his father, mother, sons, daughters, uncles, aunts, and cousins, to the ninth generation. It is within these limits that a Scotchman's social affection expands itself, never reaching those which are outermost, till all means of discharging itself in the <b>interior</b> <b>circles</b> have been exhausted. It is within these circles that his heart throbs, each pulsation being fainter and fainter, till, beyond the widest boundary, it is almost unfelt. And what is worst of all, could you surmount all these concentric outworks, you have an inner citadel, deeper, higher, and more efficient than them all--a Scotchman's love for himself." ...|$|R

50|$|The almost flat <b>interior</b> <b>circle</b> of {{the base}} of the cup, called the tondo, was {{generally}} the primary surface for painted decoration in the black-figure or red-figure pottery styles of the 6th and 5th century BC, and the outside was also often painted.
