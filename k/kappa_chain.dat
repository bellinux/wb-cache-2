According to the company's Investigator Brochure, [...] "TGN1412 is a humanised monoclonal antibody directed against the human CD28 antigen. The molecule was genetically engineered by transfer of the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) from heavy and light chain variable region sequences of a monoclonal mouse anti-humanC28 sic antibody (5.11A1, Luhder et al., 2003) into human heavy and light chain variable frameworks.

40|$|To {{determine}} whether a foreign unrearranged immunoglobulin gene can be functionally rearranged and expressed in vivo, a rabbit b 9 kappa light chain gene construct containing a single germ-line <b>kappa</b> <b>chain</b> variable (V) region gene (V kappa), the five <b>kappa</b> <b>chain</b> joining (J) segments (J kappa), and the <b>kappa</b> <b>chain</b> constant (C) region germ-line gene (C kappa) was introduced into fertilized mouse eggs. Eleven transgenic mice carrying 1 - 30 copies of the rabbit kappa gene construct were obtained. Rearrangement of the transgene due to V kappa-J kappa recombination was observed in the spleen of all the mice lines analyzed. Only the J kappa 1 and J kappa 2 segments, which have canonical sequences for rearrangement and high-level expression, are utilized in assembly of the rabbit gene. V kappa-J kappa 1 and V kappa-J kappa 2 joining was also observed in the thymus but not in nonlymphoid tissue. Polyadenylylated rabbit <b>kappa</b> <b>chain</b> transcripts of 1. 2 kilobases {{were found in the}} spleen of the transgenic mice. The level of transcription was low despite a high level of rearrangement. Three transgenic mice lines secreted kappa light chains encoded by the foreign rabbit gene. Serum rabbit kappa chains were associated with mouse mu and gamma 1 heavy chains. However, hybrid antibody molecules containing both rabbit and mouse kappa light chains were also found in the serum of these animals. These results suggest that, although the rabbit <b>kappa</b> <b>chain</b> gene construct contains the necessary sequences for gene assembly, sequences implicated in stage- and tissue-specific regulation of <b>kappa</b> <b>chain</b> gene rearrangement are either missing or not recognized by mouse lymphoid cells...|$|E

We report on the complete primary sequence deduced from complementary (c) DNA analysis of a normal-sized <b>kappa</b> <b>chain</b> in a case of myeloma-associated LCDD. The patient's urine contained a kappa type Bence-Jones protein made of monomers and dimers of an unglycosylated <b>kappa</b> <b>chain.</b> The bone marrow myeloma cells contained intracellular kappa and gamma chains by immunofluorescence. Biosynthesis experiments showed the production of normal-sized gamma chains and of kappa chains with the same apparent molecular mass (Mr) in SDS gels as the urinary <b>kappa</b> <b>chain</b> (26, 000 - 27, 000). These kappa chains were secreted as assembled IgG molecules and as a large excess of free monomers and dimers. The complete sequence of two identical cDNA clones derived from a normal-sized kappa messenger RNA indicated that this <b>kappa</b> <b>chain</b> belonged to the rare V kappa IV subgroup. The kappa mRNA had an overall normal structure made up of the V kappa IV sequence rearranged to J kappa 1 and followed by a normal constant exon of the Km(3) allotype. The variable region differed from the V kappa IV-J kappa 1 germline sequence by 17 amino acid substitutions.

The clear differences observed in the hybridization patterns of the two DNAs are in agreement with our previously reported results obtained with endonuclease BamHI and confirms that the sequence arrangement of <b>kappa</b> <b>chain</b> genes is different in the embryo and myeloma cells. We have cloned most of the kappa-sequence-positive EcoRI DNA fragments in Charon 4 A phage by using the highly efficient in vitro phage lambda DNA packaging method, and we have characterized the cloned mouse DNA sequences by agarose gel blotting and R-loop mapping in electron microscopy. These studies identified, among others, one EcoRI DNA fragment which contains both variable and constant immunoglobulin kappa-gene sequences and is present only in the myeloma DNA. The two sequences are separated by a 2. 8 -kbase intron. We tentatively conclude that the kappa gene sequences on this DNA fragment underwent somatic rearrangement...|$|E
40|$|To {{elucidate}} the molecular features of active chromatin, we have mapped, by two-dimensional electrophoresis, the protein composition of nucleosomes that package the immunoglobulin <b>kappa</b> <b>chain</b> gene of mouse plasmacytoma cells. Nucleoprotein particles that possess the active <b>kappa</b> <b>chain</b> gene comigrate with bulk mononucleosomes that contain high mobility group proteins HMG- 14 or - 17 but lack histone H 1. High electrophoretic {{resolution of the}} underlying core particles, after removal of ubiquitin by isopeptidase treatment, reveals that these nucleosomes are nonubiquitinated, even though they coincidently migrate with bulk ubiquitinated particles. This distinctive electrophoretic behavior may be correlated {{with the presence of}} histone H 2 A. X. Nucleosomes exhibiting these unusual properties appear to span at least 10 kilobases, in both transcribed and nontranscribed regions, suggesting that mechanisms independent of transcription exist to initiate, maintain, and propagate a common chromatin phenotype over long distances along the <b>kappa</b> <b>chain</b> locus...|$|E
40|$|Chronic {{lymphocytic}} leukemia cells with relatively {{large amounts of}} mu and kappa immunoglobulin structures on the surface, and apparently very small amounts intracellularly, were subjected to homogenization or washing after freezing and thawing. After a light centrifugation, which sedimented the nuclei and unbroken cells, most of the immunoglobulin structures {{were found in the}} supernatant. Ultracentrifugation, which was performed to remove the membranes from the supernatant, sedimented only half the amount of the immunoglobulin structures. By sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation and Sephadex G- 200 filtration, the unsedimented immunoglobulin structures were shown to consist of 7 S IgM and free <b>kappa</b> <b>chains.</b> About 80, 000 7 S IgM molecules were calculated to be present on each cell. The amount of <b>kappa</b> <b>chains</b> not associated with IgM was estimated to be equal to the amount of <b>kappa</b> <b>chains</b> in IgM.

40|$|UV {{transcription}} mapping with recombinant DNA probes containing immunoglobulin <b>kappa</b> light <b>chain</b> mRNA sequences {{has been}} used to determine the size of the transcription unit coding for <b>kappa</b> light <b>chain</b> m RNA and to establish the arrangement of variable and constant regions in this transcription unit. In relation to ribosomal RNA standards, the transcription of <b>kappa</b> light <b>chain</b> constant region sequences into nuclear RNA exhibits a UV target size of 9. 6 kbases (kb). The <b>kappa</b> light <b>chain</b> variable region exhibits a UV target size of 7. 6 kb indicating that it is separated by approximately 2. 0 kb from the constant region in the <b>kappa</b> light <b>chain</b> transcription unit. The size of the primary transcript (i. e., the direct, unprocessed RNA product of transcription) predicted from the constant region target size concurs with our previous pulse-labeling results which showed that the largest presumptive nuclear RNA precursor to <b>kappa</b> light <b>chain</b> mRNA is approximately 10 kb. In addition, the UV target size of cytoplasmic kappa mRNA is indistinguishable from the target size of constant region sequences in nuclear RNA. These results suggest that the <b>kappa</b> light <b>chain</b> transcription unit is copied directly into a 10 -kb nuclear RNA precursor in which the kappa variable and constant regions are separated by approximately 2 kb. Accordingly, it is proposed that the joining of immunoglobulin <b>kappa</b> light <b>chain</b> variable and constant regions occurs in the post-transcriptional processing of this large nuclear RNA precursor into <b>kappa</b> light <b>chain</b> mRNA...|$|R

When these two forms were separated by gel filtration, only the monomeric form bound antigen. As <b>kappa</b> light <b>chains</b> from the myeloma MOPC- 41 and the hybridoma MORK do not bind to the melanocytic cells, we conclude that the binding specificity of NEMO resides in the variable region...|$|R
40|$|That {{structural}} abnormalities may {{be responsible}} for nonamyloid immunoglobulin (Ig) light chain deposition disease (LCDD) is suggested by previous results of Ig biosynthesis studies, but this hypothesis was not documented at the molecular level. We report on the first complete primary sequence deduced from cDNA analysis of a kappa light chain responsible for LCDD associated with an apparently nonsecretory myeloma. Bone marrow myeloma cells contained intracellular kappa chains and no heavy chains by immunofluorescence. Kidney biopsy showed typical nonamyloid PAS-positive <b>kappa</b> <b>chain</b> deposits. SDS-PAGE analysis of material extracted from a kidney biopsy specimen and of Ig produced by the myeloma cells revealed kappa chains of abnormally high apparent molecular mass (30, 000). Comparison of the NH 2 -terminal aminoacid sequence of the <b>kappa</b> <b>chain</b> deposited in the kidney and of the complete sequence of several identical kappa cDNA clones from bone marrow cells showed the identity of the tissue deposited and plasma cell <b>kappa</b> <b>chain.</b> The kappa mRNA had an overall normal structure and corresponded to the V kappa IV gene rearranged to J kappa 1 and followed by a normal constant exon of the Km(3) allotype. The variable sequence differed from the V kappa IV germline gene by nine point mutations, including an Asp [...] Asn substitution at position + 70 resulting in a potential N-glycosylation site. In vitro biosynthesis experiments and treatment with N-glycosidase provided evidence for the intracellular glycosylation of the monoclonal <b>kappa</b> <b>chain.</b> The peculiar sequence and the glycosylation of a <b>kappa</b> <b>chain</b> of the rare V kappa IV subgroup might be responsible for structural abnormalities leading to tissue deposition...|$|E

These cells were then exposed to small unilamellar liposomes composed of egg phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol and phosphatidic acid (molar proportions 7 : 7 : 1) containing carboxyfluorescein and/or 111 In-labelled bleomycin and bearing 131 I-labelled affinity chromatography-purified or non-purified anti-(kappa-chain) immunoglobulin G (IgG) [see the preceding paper, Gregoriadis, Meehan & Mah (1981) Biochem.

(1) Lymphocytes (107) coated with 2 – 85 μg of <b>kappa</b> <b>chain</b> and exposed to liposomes devoid of IgG or bearing non-purified anti-(kappa chain) IgG bound only {{a small proportion of}} the liposomal markers. Even with liposomes bearing the purified anti-(kappa chain) IgG, uptake of the labels improved only slightly for cells coated with up to 10 μg of <b>kappa</b> <b>chain.</b> However, with higher concentrations of the antigen on the cell surface, binding was improved considerably to reach values of 31 % (111 In-labelled bleomycin) and 43 % (131 I-labelled IgG) of added liposomes for cells coated with 85 μg of <b>kappa</b> <b>chain.</b> (2) Lymphocytes coated with <b>kappa</b> <b>chain</b> were exposed to liposomes bearing increasing amounts (0 – 180 μg/ 0. 9 mg of egg phosphatidylcholine) of purified anti-(kappa chain) IgG.

Very rarely certain cells synthesized both mu and <b>kappa</b> <b>chains.</b> Based {{on the presence of}} Fc receptors and IgM synthesis the cells {{transformed by}} R-MuLV belonged to three B cell developmental stages. These cells were tested for immunoglobulin gene rearrangements using JH and CK probes. DNA from cell lines without any detectable levels of IgM mu exhibited embryonic as well as rearranged JH genes, whereas cells expressing IgM possess, in addition, productive and non-productive light chain gene rearrangements. The most terminally differentiated cell possesses JH and CK rearrangement associated with the synthesis of mu and <b>kappa</b> <b>chains.</b> Presumably the cells with rearranged JH and CK genes without immunoglobulin synthesis represent a developmental transition. We conclude that cells transformed by R-MuLV belonged to five step-wise compartments of B cell development.

40|$|Urinary {{excretion}} of <b>kappa</b> light <b>chains</b> {{in patients}} with diabetes mellitus. The urinary excretion of kappa light chains,β 2 -microglobulin and albumin was examined {{in patients with}} newly diagnosed and long-standing insulin-dependent (IDDM) and non-insulin-dependent (NIDDM) diabetes mellitus, and compared to age-matched control subjects. Patients with IDDM diagnosed within two months, presented with normal albumin excretion, whereas the concentrations of β 2 -microglobulin and <b>kappa</b> light <b>chain</b> in urine were higher than in control subjects. The initiation of insulin therapy reduced, but did not completely normalize, the elevated rate of <b>kappa</b> light <b>chain</b> excretion. Patients with IDDM of long duration showed increased urine excretion of <b>kappa</b> light <b>chains</b> and albumin. In keeping with the findings in IDDM, patients with newly diagnosed NIDDM (within one year) showed increased urinary excretion of <b>kappa</b> light <b>chains</b> compared with control subjects. There was, however, no further increase in light chain excretion with longer duration of NIDDM. To study the effect of short-term hyperglycemia on urinary protein excretion, 12 normal subjects participated in a three-step hyperglycemic clamp study, during which their plasma glucose concentration was raised by + 50, + 125 and + 300 mg/dl. The urine excretion of albumin and β; 2 -microglobulin rose progressively with each hyperglycemic clamp step, whereas that of <b>kappa</b> light <b>chain</b> excretion was unaffected by hyperglycemia. We conclude that increased urinary excretion of <b>kappa</b> light <b>chain</b> is a consistent finding in all types of diabetes mellitus, and can be observed even when the albumin excretion is normal. Since the serum concentration of <b>kappa</b> light <b>chain</b> is normal in diabetes, the increased urinary excretion of <b>kappa</b> light <b>chains</b> must be of renal origin. Although the underlying mechanism(s) responsible for the kappa light chainuria are unknown, it cannot be ascribed {{to the effect of}} acute hyperglycemia on glomerular and tubular function...|$|R

The second, L XIX 27, 1150 bp long, was unequivocally assigned to a GAT-specific <b>kappa</b> <b>chain,</b> by comparison of its nucleotide sequence with the previously determined NH 2 -terminal amino acid sequence of the isolated <b>kappa</b> <b>chain.</b> A specific probe, containing the leader and most of the V kappa gene-encoded region, was prepared from this clone and hybridized to EcoRI and BamHI restriction fragments of liver (unrearranged) DNA extracted from the BALB/c, DBA/ 2 and C 57 BL/ 6 mouse strains. Under stringent conditions, similar patterns were observed for all three strains, and consisted of a small number of bands (3 - 5). Under nonstringent conditions, patterns were again very similar when the different strains were compared, although 15 - 20 bands could be identified. These observations support the hypothesis that the GAT-specific kappa chains found in antibodies expressing the public CGAT idiotypes are encoded by a very small number of germline genes. This V kappa repertoire seems extremely conserved between the three strains that were analyzed, an observation which correlates with the interstrain conservation of these public idiotypic specificities...|$|E

40|$|Human {{immunoglobulin}} molecules {{are generated}} {{by a pair of}} identical heavy chains, which identify the immunoglobulin class, and a pair of identical light chains, Kappa or Lambda alternatively, which characterize the immunoglobulin type. In normal conditions, Kappa light chains represent approximately 2 / 3 of the light chains of total immunoglobulins, both circulating and lymphocyte surface bound. Very few cases of immunoglobulin Kappa or Lambda light chain defects have been reported. Furthermore, the genetic basis of this defect has been extensively explored only in a single case. We report a case of a patient suffering of serious recurrent bacterial infections, which was caused by a very rare form of immunoglobulin disorder, consisting of a pure defect of Kappa light chain. We evaluated major serum immunoglobulin concentrations, as well as total and free Kappa and Lambda light chain concentrations. Lymphocyte phenotyping was also performed and finally we tested the <b>Kappa</b> <b>chain</b> VJ rearrangement as well as the constant Kappa region sequence. Studies performed on VJ rearrangement showed a polyclonal genetic arrangement, whereas the gene sequencing for the constant region of <b>Kappa</b> <b>chain</b> showed a homozygous T to G substitution at the position 1288 (rs 200765148). This mutation causes a substitution from Cys to Gly in the protein sequence and, therefore, determines the abnormal folding of the constant region of <b>Kappa</b> <b>chain.</b> We suggest that this defect could lead to an effective reduction of the variability of total antibody repertoire and a consequent defect of an apparently normal immunoglobulin response to common antigen...|$|E

40|$|The {{constant}} {{regions of}} rabbit <b>kappa</b> light <b>chains</b> are unusual because the sequences of the allotypic forms can differ more {{from each other}} than do some variable regions with which they associate. We report the nucleic acid sequence of a full-length cDNA clone of b 9 allotype and show comparisons to available sequences of the rabbit kappa allotypes b 4, b 5, and bas-N 4. Our analyses suggest that the primordial rabbit kappa gene encoded a bas-like sequence. They also reveal a surprising difference {{in the position of}} the variable region cysteine that forms the interdomain disulfide bond that is unique to most rabbit <b>kappa</b> <b>chains.</b> One b 9 cDNA sequence lacks the usual cysteine- 80 and instead encodes cysteine- 108, which in three-dimensional models appears capable of forming the interdomain disulfide bond with cysteine- 171 in the constant region. A partial sequence of a second b 9 clone encodes both cysteine- 80 and cysteine- 108; the translation product of this clone could have a free reactive sulfhydryl group that might lead to an unstable nonfunctional Ig molecule. The fact that pre-B cells with b 9 <b>kappa</b> <b>chains</b> do not differentiate and expand into productive Ig-producing cells with frequencies comparable to the other allotypes may be explained if a substantial proportion of the gene products have a free sulfhydryl group.

50|$|Despite this wide binding range, Protein L {{is not a}} {{universal}} antibody-binding protein. Protein L binding is restricted to those antibodies that contain <b>kappa</b> light <b>chains.</b> In humans and mice, most antibody molecules contain <b>kappa</b> (κ) light <b>chains</b> and the remainder have lambda (λ) light chains. Protein L is only effective in binding certain subtypes of <b>kappa</b> light <b>chains.</b> For example, it binds human VκI, VκIII and VκIV subtypes but does not bind the VκII subtype. Binding of mouse immunoglobulins is restricted to those having VκI light chains.|$|R

Nodular glomerulosclerosis {{was present in}} 2 of these patients, but the remainder showed only minor light microscopic abnormalities. Deposition of <b>kappa</b> light <b>chains</b> in renal basement membranes may be a frequent cause of kidney disease in multiple myeloma. This deposition may be detected with electron microscopy by the demonstration of granular dense transformation of basement membranes. Occasionally there is systemic vascular deposition of <b>kappa</b> light <b>chains</b> which {{may be difficult to}} distinguish from amyloid but lacks a fibrillar character. The tissue effects of light chains in multiple myeloma seem likely to be more extensive than their deposition in renal tubules. There appears to be a greater tendency for <b>kappa</b> light <b>chains</b> to accumulate in renal and systemic basement membranes, but the mechanisms governing this deposition are unknown...|$|R
