5|$|Care {{of young}} is protracted, {{extending}} {{for as long}} as six months, among the longest for birds. For example, once common guillemot chicks fledge, they remain with the male parent for several months at sea. The frigatebirds have the longest period of parental care of any bird except a few raptors and the southern ground hornbill, with each chick fledging after <b>four</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> and continued assistance after that for up to fourteen months. Due to the extended period of care, breeding occurs every two years rather than annually for some species. This life-history strategy has probably evolved both in response to the challenges of living at sea (collecting widely scattered prey items), the frequency of breeding failures due to unfavourable marine conditions, and the relative lack of predation compared to that of land-living birds.|$|E

5|$|Sheep {{follow a}} similar {{reproductive}} strategy to other herd animals. A group of ewes is generally mated {{by a single}} ram, who has either been chosen by a breeder or (in feral populations) has established dominance through physical contest with other rams. Most sheep are seasonal breeders, although some are able to breed year-round. Ewes generally reach sexual maturity at six to eight months old, and rams generally at <b>four</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> <b>months.</b> However, there are exceptions. For example, Finnsheep ewe lambs may reach puberty as early as 3 to 4 months, and Merino ewes sometimes reach puberty at 18 to 20 months. Ewes have estrus cycles about every 17 days, during which they emit a scent and indicate readiness through physical displays towards rams. A minority of rams (8% on average) display a preference for homosexuality and {{a small number of}} the females that were accompanied by a male fetus in utero are freemartins (female animals that are behaviorally masculine and lack functioning ovaries).|$|E
5|$|The tuatara has a third {{eye on the}} top of {{its head}} called the parietal eye. It has its own lens, a parietal plug which resembles a cornea, retina with {{rod-like}} structures, and degenerated nerve connection to the brain. The parietal eye is only visible in hatchlings, which have a translucent patch at the top centre of the skull. After <b>four</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> <b>months,</b> it becomes covered with opaque scales and pigment. Its purpose is unknown, but it may be useful in absorbing ultraviolet rays to produce vitamin D, as well as to determine light/dark cycles, and help with thermoregulation. Of all extant tetrapods, the parietal eye is most pronounced in the tuatara. It is part of the pineal complex, another part of which is the pineal gland, which in tuatara secretes melatonin at night. Some salamanders have been shown to use their pineal bodies to perceive polarised light, and thus determine the position of the sun, even under cloud cover, aiding navigation.|$|E

40|$|Background {{and study}} aims: Due to the {{sometimes}} insufficient reprocessing of endoscopes the usual <b>four</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> <b>month</b> time interval between monitorings {{may be to}} long to allow rapid detection of potential flaws. Hence {{our aim was to}} examine whether dipslides, which are normally used in other areas for detecting microorganisms, can also be used as a rapid self-control method for processed endoscopes. Methods: We selected 18 commercially available dipslides and examined the rinse solutions of non-processed gastroscopes and colonoscopes. The samples were diluted and examined using dipslides and additionally plated on TSA and Endo Agar serving as reference media. Results: 1. The median of almost all dipslides showed equal or higher bacterial counts than the both reference medias. 2. Considering the median and the single values dipslides no. 5 (Petrifilm AC) and no. 12 showed best results. 3. All dipslides gave higher bacterial counts for colonoscopes than for gastroscopes related to TSA. 4. Related to Endo Agar dipslides gave comparable results as the reference medium in colonoscopies. Conclusions: Dipslides should not be viewed as a substitute for routine laboratory analyses. Some of the examined dipslides can be recommended for screening of the endoscope reprocessing results, especially swellable dipslides with a low detection limit. Moreover, any bacterial growth detected by means of dipslides with a low detection limit generates an immediate call for action...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this report}} and subsequent volumes include describing progress on (1) development and optimization of experimental methods to quantify the release of contaminants from solid wastes and their subsequent interactions with unsaturated sediments and (2) the creation of empirical data that become input parameters to performance assessment (PA) analyses for future Hanford Site disposal units and baseline risk assessments for inactive and existing solid waste disposal units. For this report, efforts focused on developing methodologies to evaluate contaminant transport in Trench 8 (W- 5 Burial Ground) sediments under unsaturated (vadose zone) conditions. To accomplish this task, a series of flow-through column tests were run using standard saturated column systems, Wierenga unsaturated column systems (both commercial and modified), and the Unsaturated Flow Apparatus (UFA). The reactants investigated were {sup 85 }Sr, {sup 236 }U, and {sup 238 }U as reactive tracers, and tritium as a non-reactive tracer. Results indicate that for moderately unsaturated conditions (volumetric water contents > 50 % of saturation), the Wierenga system performed reasonably well such that long water residence times (50 - 147 h) were achieved, and reasonably good steady-state flow conditions were maintained. The major drawbacks in using this system for reactive tracer work included (1) the inability to achieve reproducible and constant moisture content below 50 % of saturation, (2) the <b>four</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> <b>month</b> time required <b>to</b> complete a single test, and (3) the propensity for mechanical failure resulting from laboratory power outages during the prolonged testing period...|$|R

40|$|Phlebitis from {{peripheral}} intravenous infusions is {{an important}} potential source of oncology patient morbidity. Important factors found to determine phlebitis incidence include the kind of infusion and dwell time of intravenous cannula. Early studies showed incidence rates of between 25 - 70 % worldwide, and association with up to 10 % of S. aureus bacteraemia. The introduction of the visual infusion phlebitis (VIP) score tool for assessment of the early signs of phlebitis, along with prompt removal of peripheral intravenous cannulas, has been very successful in reducing the incidence below the acceptable rate of 5 %. However, achieving this goal depends on strict compliance with guidelines for cannula insertion, documentation, and assessment using the VIP tool. This study aimed to increase the use of VIP scoring tool to 100 % on an oncology ward during a <b>four</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> <b>month</b> period in order to maximise its utility in phlebitis prevention. Three plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycles were carried out, during which two major interventions were introduced.

500|$|The {{main problem}} of the chronic use of benzodiazepines is the {{development}} of tolerance and dependence.

In Sudan the most supplementary food offered to children are cereal-based stuffs which are naturally deficient in protein constituents. A survey was done in a central rural area of Sudan to study the feeding habits of children under age of five and related information about breast feeding, drinking water and complementary foods during breast feeding for the infants. Moreover, the weaning parameters as well as the most common food consumed by the children under age of five have been detected. The type of diet consumed by children under question was determined by using the Recall method. The results discovered the importance of early and continuous breast feeding for infants of the studied area. 60. 7 % of the infants were breast-fed for two years and only 10 % of them were using bottle-feeding. Moreover, it was recorded that a higher share of the children (97. 3 %) were taking complementary food during the period of breast feeding while 12 % of the infants started such complementary feeding program earlier (< 4 month of age) and 57. 3 % involved in the range between <b>four</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> <b>month</b> old. The assessment of the weaning regime was found to be sudden in about 23. 3 % of the infant community. Imposing of such sudden weaning without gradual introduction of complementary food was reported as one of the terrible traditional practices affecting the child health in various parts of Sudan. Most of the children were found consuming cereal-based diet and due to the low socio-economic status large number of families consumes on average 0. 25 kg of meat for preparing meals for the whole family.

40|$|The role of {{selection}} during speciation {{is a key}} component towards fully diverged species, yet the processes and time required for genomic divergence to evolve new species remains an active area of research in evolution. A population genomics approach provides a promising means to understanding evolutionary processes influencing genomic divergence. To determine the effects selection has on the genome, I used Sebastes as a model system due to its rapid adaptive radiation in the North Pacific Ocean. Species in Sebastes inhabit {{a wide range of}} environments providing a unique system to study a range of divergence from local adaptation between populations to incipient speciation. I identified genomic regions diverging due to local adaptation and candidate genomic regions involved in the incipient speciation of a lineage within the subgenus Sebastosomus. I developed 67 microsatellites from expressed sequence tagged (EST) libraries from three different Sebastes species to identify gene function responding to selection. I then implemented a low-density genome scan on a species pair (S. flavidus & S. melanops) and identified outlier loci with two outlier detection methods. The two species are distributed sympatrically but differ in pelagic larval duration (PLD). S. flavidus has a three <b>to</b> <b>four</b> month PLD had a higher number of identified candidate outlier loci while S. melanops which has a <b>four</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> <b>month</b> PLD had significantly fewer suggesting that gene flow may reduce local adaptation.

Finally, I assembled a restriction site associated (RAD) library and sequenced using the Illumina Hiseq technology from two divergent S. mystinus morphotypes. I sampled 21, 318 single nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) loci across six populations from Oregon to San Francisco. Population structure analyses identified two morphotypes previously described as genetically distinct groups and highlighted a population maintaining signatures of hybridization. I identified 209 SNP loci diverging between morphotypes providing an initial set of genomic regions diverging due to speciation.

However, {{there are only a}} limited number of studies that investigated hen`s egg sensitization and its clinical relevance in breast- or bottle-fed infants before the start of complementary food. The aim of this work is to collect and evaluate data on prevalence of hen`s egg sensitization and allergy in infants directly before starting complementary food as well as potential risk factors. For all infants who are part of this study, standardized questionnaires were filled out at birth and at 4 - 6 month of the age before the start of complementary food. A physical examination was performed and a blood sample was taken in order to determine food-specific IgE. A double-blind, placebo controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) was recommended for all hen`s egg-sensitized children in order to define the clinical relevance of this sensitization. Between May 2008 and January 2014, 374 infants were enrolled into the study and hen's egg-specific IgE levels were determinated. 23 out of 374 these infants (6. 1 %) were sensitized to hen’s egg before weaning (hen's egg-specific IgE ranged from 0. 38 kU/l to 14. 1 kU/l, median 1. 67 kU/l). 16 out of 374 infants (4, 3 %) showed immediate type reactions of the skin, the gastrointestinal or respiratory system during the double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge. Atopic dermatitis was determined as the only highly significant risk factor for hen's egg allergy (60. 9 % of the sensitized and 68. 8 % of the allergic children). Sex, the parental atopy, time of breastfeeding or hen's egg consumption in pregnancy showed no significant influence on hen's egg sensitization or allergy at the age of <b>four</b> <b>to</b> <b>six</b> <b>month</b> before complementary feeding. A high number of infants are already sensitized to hen's egg before the start of complementary feeding. About one out of twenty infants developed hen's egg allergy.

The results of this work suggest a revision regarding nutritional recommendations for infants.
