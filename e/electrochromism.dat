5000|$|The use of {{the term}} [...] "Stark effect" [...] differs between the {{disciplines}} of chemistry and physics. Physicists tend to use the more classical definition of the term (see Stark effect), while chemists usually use the term to refer to what is technically <b>electrochromism.</b> In the former case, the applied electric field splits the atomic energy levels and is the electric field analog of the Zeeman effect. However, in the latter case, the applied electric field changes the molar absorption coefficient of the sample, which can be measured using traditional absorption or emission spectroscopic methods. This effect is known as <b>electrochromism.</b>|$|E
50|$|Finally, PTs can exhibit {{absorption}} shifts due to {{application of}} electric potentials (<b>electrochromism),</b> or to introduction of alkali ions (ionochromism). These effects {{will be discussed}} in the context of applications of PTs below.|$|E
50|$|Gentex {{introduced}} an automatic dimming mirror based on <b>electrochromism</b> in 1987. The reduction of glare eliminates the temporary blind spot {{caused by the}} Troxler effect after the glare source leaves the field of view.|$|E
5000|$|Different {{types of}} glazing can show {{a variety of}} chromic phenomena, that is, based on {{photochemical}} effects the glazing changes its light transmission properties {{in response to an}} environmental signal such as light (photochromism), temperature (thermochromism), or voltage (<b>electrochromism).</b>|$|E
50|$|Current systems usually use photosensors {{mounted in}} the {{rear-view}} mirror to detect light and dim the mirror by means of <b>electrochromism.</b> This electrochromic feature has also been incorporated into side-view mirrors allowing them to dim and reduce glare as well.|$|E
50|$|Dr. Staebler has {{performed}} research investigations on photochromism in materials, <b>electrochromism,</b> storage of holograms in electro-optic crystals, plus amorphous silicon solar cells produced by discharge. In 1980 {{he worked with}} Christopher R. Wronski to study light-induced metastable changes in the properties of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H); {{now known as the}} Staebler-Wronski effect.|$|E
50|$|Gasochromism {{is closely}} related to <b>electrochromism.</b> The process {{involves}} the interaction of an electrochrome, usually a metal oxide, such as tungsten oxide, with an oxidizing or reducing gas, commonly oxygen and hydrogen, producing reversible color changes. The gasochromic technology is used commercially in reversible smart windows and gas sensing of oxygen, hydrogen, nitric oxide, hydrogen sulphide and carbon monoxide.|$|E
50|$|Stark {{spectroscopy}} (sometimes {{known as}} electroabsorption/emission spectroscopy) {{is a form}} of spectroscopy based on the Stark effect. In brief, this technique makes use of the Stark effect (or <b>electrochromism)</b> either to reveal information about the physiochemical or physical properties of a sample using a well-characterized electric field or to reveal information about an electric field using a reference sample with a well-characterized Stark effect.|$|E
5000|$|Phosphaphenalenes are a {{class of}} heterocyclic {{aromatic}} compounds containing phosphorus with molecular formula , related to the phenalene polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, [...] Phosphaphenalene can exist {{in a number of}} isomers depending on where in the ring system the phosphorus atom is placed. The phosphorus atom in these molecules has unusual properties, in particular changing its affinity as an electron acceptor when exposed to certain wavelengths of light. This makes phosphaphenalenes useful in optoelectronic applications such as temperature-dependent luminescence and <b>electrochromism</b> (reversibly changes colour when electricity is applied).|$|E
50|$|<b>Electrochromism</b> is the {{phenomenon}} displayed by some materials of reversibly changing colour by using bursts of charge to cause electrochemical redox reactions in electrochromic materials. Various types {{of materials and}} structures {{can be used to}} construct electrochromic devices, depending on the specific applications. Transition metal oxides are a large family of materials possessing various interesting properties in the field of <b>electrochromism.</b> Among them, tungsten oxide (WO3), has been the most extensively studied material, used in the production of electrochromic windows or smart glass and more recently electrochromic displays on paper substrate as anti-counterfeiting systems integrated on packaging. NiO materials have been widely studied as counter electrodes for complementary electrochromic devices, in particular, smart windows. The world leading institutions on NiO efforts include National Renewable Energy Laboratory and Uppsala University. Another example of an electrochromic material is polyaniline which can be formed either by the electrochemical or chemical oxidation of aniline. If an electrode is immersed in hydrochloric acid which contains a small concentration of aniline, then a film of polyaniline can be grown on the electrode. Depending on the oxidation state, polyaniline can either be pale yellow or dark green/black. Other electrochromic materials that have found technological application include the viologens and polyoxotungstates.|$|E
5000|$|AFC {{manufactured}} electrodes {{on glass}} for flat panel displays. These electrodes {{are used in}} liquid crystal displays (LCD), plasma displays, and auto-dimming car mirrors utilizing <b>electrochromism.</b> Major early customers were Burroughs (now Unisys) in New Jersey, IBM in East Fishkill and Kingston, New York, numerous Asian producers of LCD's, Gentex in Holland, Michigan, Plasmaco (now Panasonic Plasma Display Lab) in Highland, New York, and Samsung in Gumi, South Korea. The main method of coating these electrodes on glass was magnetron sputter deposition, specifically the planar magnetron [...] The main materials were indium tin oxide transparent electrical conductor, silicon dioxide diffusion barrier, and chromium and copper conductors.|$|E
5000|$|Gentex Corporation (...) {{manufactures}} automatic-dimming {{rear-view mirrors}} and camera-based driver assistance {{systems for the}} global automotive industry. The company also provides commercial smoke detectors and signaling devices to the North American fire protection market, as well as dimmable aircraft windows for the commercial, business and general aviation markets. The company is based in Zeeland, Michigan and was founded in 1974. Their mirrors use <b>electrochromism</b> to dim {{in proportion to the}} amount of light reaching them from following vehicles' headlamps. The mirrors are available with added electronic features. About 98 percent of the company's net sales are derived from the sale of auto-dimming mirrors to every major automaker in the world.|$|E
50|$|Due {{to their}} poor processability, {{conductive}} polymers have few large-scale applications. They have promise in antistatic materials {{and they have}} been incorporated into commercial displays and batteries, but there have been limitations due to the manufacturing costs, material inconsistencies, toxicity, poor solubility in solvents, and inability to directly melt process. Literature suggests they are also promising in organic solar cells, printing electronic circuits, organic light-emitting diodes, actuators, <b>electrochromism,</b> supercapacitors, chemical sensors and biosensors, flexible transparent displays, electromagnetic shielding and possibly replacement for the popular transparent conductor indium tin oxide. Another use is for microwave-absorbent coatings, particularly radar-absorptive coatings on stealth aircraft. Conducting polymers are rapidly gaining attraction in new applications with increasingly processable materials with better electrical and physical properties and lower costs. The new nanostructured forms of conducting polymers particularly, augment this field with their higher surface area and better dispersability.|$|E
50|$|View {{was founded}} in 2006 as Echromics by Paul Nguyen, an <b>electrochromism</b> expert from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who {{was working on the}} {{technology}} for View. After raising around $10.6M in Series A funding from Sigma Partners and Khosla Ventures in 2007, Nguyen focused on building up a team of experienced technologists and executives for developing its initial technology, which failed completely. In 2007, Mike Scobey became the first CEO of the company, who was succeeded by Dr. Rao Mulpuri in December 2008 to work on developing the new technology for the company. Nguyen remained with the company in the early 2009. Later in the year, the company closed an additional $20.7M in Series B funding from its existing investors and moved its headquarters from Santa Rosa to Milpitas, California, USA. In late 2010, General Electric selected Soladigm to be a winner out of 3,800 contestants in 150 different countries in the Ecomagination Challenge.|$|E
50|$|The {{history of}} {{coloration}} {{goes back to}} 1704 when Diesbach discovered Prussian blue (hexacyanoferrate), which changes the color from transparent to blue under oxidation of iron. In the 1930s, Kobosew and Nekrassow first noted electrochemical coloration in bulk tungsten oxide. While working at Balzers in Lichtenstein, T. Kraus provided {{a detailed description of}} electrochemical coloration in thin film of tungsten trioxide (WO3) on 30 July 1953. In 1969, S. K. Deb demonstrated electrochromic coloration in WO3 thin films. Deb observed electrochromic color by applying electric field of the order of 104 Vcm−1 across WO3 thin film. In fact, the real birth of the EC technology is usually attributed to S. K. Deb’s seminal paper of 1973, wherein he described the coloration mechanism in WO3. The <b>Electrochromism</b> occurs due to the electrochemical redox reactions that take place in electrochromic materials. Various types of materials and structures can be used to construct electrochromic devices, depending on the specific applications.|$|E
5000|$|Tantalum(V) oxide {{films have}} a variety of {{applications}} including as optical films with refractive indices as high as 2.039 and as a thin-film dielectric material in dynamic random access memory and semiconductor field-effect transistors. [...] The approach chosen for preparation of these materials is determined by the desired properties. Direct hydrolysis is appropriate when the presence of residual water or the use of high temperatures for drying is acceptable. Micropatterns can be produced by site-selective deposition using the hydrolysis approach by forming a self-assembled monolayer followed by high temperature annealling. [...] Chemical vapour deposition allows control of the thickness of the film on a nanometre scale, which is essential for some applications. Direct pyrolysis is convenient for optical applications, where transparent materials with low light loss due to absorption is important, and has also been used to prepare nitride read-only memory. [...] <b>Electrochromism</b> is the property of some materials to change color when charge is applied, and is the means by which so-called smart glass operates. Films produced by tantalum(V) ethoxide hydrolysis has been used to prepare amorphous tantalum(V) oxide films suitable for electrochromic applications.|$|E

The electrochromic property of the PEDOT polymer is utilized in this thesis work to design an electrochromic display pixel. The polymer coating over the fibres were obtained by using In-situ polymerization technique. The coated-fibres were used to design a display-pixel.

40|$|Electrochromic {{phenomena}} {{accompanying the}} ferroelectric domain inversion in congruent RuO 2 -doped z-cut LiNbO 3 crystals {{at room temperature}} are observed in experiments. During the electric poling process, the <b>electrochromism</b> accompanies the ferroelectric domain inversion simultaneously in the same poled area. The <b>electrochromism</b> is completely reversible when the domain is inverted from the reverse direction. The influences of electric field and annealing conditions on domain inversion and <b>electrochromism</b> are also discussed. We propose the reasonable assumption that charge redistribution within the crystal structure caused by domain inversion is the source for electrochemically oxidation and reduction of Ru ion to produce the electrochromic effect.

40|$|In this study, {{we report}} poly(1 H-thieno[3, 4 -d]imidazol- 2 (3 H) -one) (pTIO) {{derivatives}} for an electrochromic (EC) type e-paper and its novel printing fabrication process. pTIO {{is a kind}} of conductive polymer (CP) s which are {{known as one of the}} EC materials. The <b>electrochromism</b> of pTIO is unique, because its color in doped state is almost transparent (pale gray). A transparent state is required to show a white color in a see-through view of an EC type e-paper. An <b>electrochromism</b> of CP has a good memory effect which is applicable for e-paper. The corresponding monomers of CP are able to be polymerized with an electrochemical method, which be made good use of for the fabrication process of e-paper. pTIO derivatives are copolymerized with other pi-conjugated X unit, which adjusts the color of <b>electrochromism.</b> Finally, we fabricated a segment matrix EC display using pTIO derivatives by ink-jet printing...|$|E
40|$|Conducting {{polymers}} (CPs) display strong <b>electrochromism</b> {{across the}} visible, near-IR (NIR), IR and even microwave spectral regions. Applications range from military to space. However, a fundamental {{understanding of the}} phenomena behind this <b>electrochromism,</b> the charge carrier(s) responsible, and the relation of nanoscopic morphology and electrochemical properties to the <b>electrochromism,</b> still remains lacking. This paper takes a first step at such a correlation, mining a wealth of data accumulated {{over the course of}} many years by our group. Expected findings are that certain population states contribute predominantly to certain spectral regions (e. g. bipolaron states to the IR, the valence band to the visible and other mid-gap states to the microwave). Among more specific findings, a prominent 7 μ m (0. 16 eV) peak in MR devices is ascribed to bipolarons, whilst a low-energy transition at 0. 054 eV is ascribed to inter/intra-chain transitions. Other findings point to the potential design of very broad-band electrochromic systems encompassing the visible through microwave regions...|$|E
40|$|A {{reversible}} electrochromic effect {{during the}} electrical poling process in LiNbO 3 :Ru:Fe crystals {{at room temperature}} is observed. In electrode area, both <b>electrochromism</b> and domain-inversion occur mutually and <b>electrochromism</b> is reversible during back-switch poling, which are experimentally verified, and a microstructure model to explain the mechanism is proposed. In addition, different from the undoped LiNbO 3 crystals, the breakdown field (> 25. 0 kV/mm) {{is higher than the}} coercive (21. 0 kV/mm) measured in LiNbO 3 :Ru:Fe, which proves a possible new technique to realize domain-inversion by constant electric field rather than pulsed one.

This semi-quantitative theory is used to derive approximate performance limits showing that high luminous transmittance (e. g., 60 %) can be combined with efficient absorption of solar energy and concomitant low solar transmittance (similar to 34 %), thereby documenting that plasmonic <b>electrochromism</b> is of interest for energy efficient fenestration...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to study the <b>electrochromism</b> and the {{reaction}} kinetics of lithium electrointercalation in anodic niobium oxide films. The oxide grown in an acid environment by application of an alternating potential shows interference colour (iridescence) and when reduced in lithium perclorate/PC solution, the intercalation of Li+ ions and electrons causes a reversible colour change (<b>electrochromism),</b> characterized here by electrochemical and optical measurements.

40|$|AbstractThe {{manganese}} containing {{center of}} the oxygen evolving complex accumulates four oxidizing equivalents in the four stepped water oxidation cycle. Based on experiments on electrochromic absorption transients and the reduction rate of the primary electron donor, P 680, it has been speculated that the oscillations of these variables reflect the net charge of the center as calculated from the difference between electron abstraction and proton release into the medium. We compared proton release with <b>electrochromism</b> in thylakoids and core particles, and under variation of the rate of proton release. We found no equivalent of the variations of the extents and the rates of proton release in <b>electrochromism.</b> The oscillatory pattern of the latter reflects the topological properties of the stepped charge storage relative to the position and orientation of electrochromically responsive pigments rather than responding to proton release from the periphery...|$|E
