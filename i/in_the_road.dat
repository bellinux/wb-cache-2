5|$|When she was {{ten years}} old, Van Dijk started, {{together}} with her two brothers and Mariëlle Kerste, cross-training on a bike {{during the summer and}} she began competing in regional races. Because Van Dijk performed well, she started competing in national races at the age of 15 in 2002. In the same year, in her first national championship, she finished in fourth place. The following year, she won the Dutch national road championship in the novice category. In 2004, Van Dijk won two more national titles, this time as a junior, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> race and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> individual time trial. In the latter, she beat Marianne Vos, though Vos would avenge her defeat in Road World Championships in Verona, Italy. Vos won the junior road race world title, with Van Dijk finishing third. In 2005, Van Dijk again won the Dutch national junior title in the individual time trial but finished second <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> race, again behind Vos. In 2007, when Van Dijk was considered for selection in regional speed skating, she had to choose between speed skating and cycling– ultimately, she chose cycling.|$|E
5|$|At Simpson's next race, the four-day Grand Prix d'Eibar, {{his first}} in Spain, his knee injury still bothered him. He won the second stage, but {{was forced to}} quit during the {{following}} stage. His injury had not healed, even after treatment by various specialists, but for financial reasons {{he was forced to}} enter the Tour de France with the British team. He abandoned on stage three, which started in Roubaix, struggling to pedal on the cobbles. Three months after his fall at Paris–Roubaix he saw a doctor at St. Michael's Hospital in Paris. He gave Simpson injections in his knee, which reduced the inflammation. Once healed, he competed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> world championships in Berne, Switzerland. On the track he qualified for the individual pursuit with the fourth-fastest time, losing in the quarter-finals to Peter Post of the Netherlands. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> race, Simpson was part of a seventeen-rider breakaway that finished together in a sprint; he crossed the line in ninth place.|$|E

The southern end was extended slightly to end at the M-76 freeway that opened between Alger and Standish; that freeway was redesignated as part of I-75 in 1974.

The player's bus holds female {{members of the}} alien race, and the player can shoot the females {{from the front of}} the bus in order to clear the alien potatoes. The aliens come in two colors: red and blue. Aliens are cleared from the road when two like-colored potatoes touch each other, but aliens begin to pile up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> if two aliens hit each other that are not of the same color. The road is continuously scrolling downwards, forcing the player to make holes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> wide enough to fit the bus through.

5|$|Van Dijk was {{selected}} to represent her country at the Olympic Games in London, and she competed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> race and the individual time trial {{on the road and}} in the team pursuit on the track. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> race, Van Dijk was a domestique for Marianne Vos, who won the gold medal. Van Dijk attacked five times but finished outside the time limit. Because the victory of Marianne Vos was seen as a team performance, Van Dijk, Loes Gunnewijk and Annemiek van Vleuten were all subsequently honoured in both the Holland Heineken House and the Ridderzaal. In the time trial, Van Dijk finished eighth. She said afterwards that she was afraid to start too fast and subsequently lost {{a lot of time in}} the first part of the race. In the team pursuit, Van Dijk finished sixth together with Kirsten Wild, Amy Pieters and Vera Koedooder. In the qualification heats, the team had held the Olympic record for a short period and they rode a new Dutch national record in round one. According to Van Dijk, sixth place was the highest attainable place the team could have hoped to achieve.|$|E

5|$|After another {{supermarket}} {{strip to}} the east, a long, gentle divided bend <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> almost a mile long ends with an overpass where NY55 comes {{in from the}} west. It joins NY22 as the two routes, returning to two lanes, pass through the eastern fringe of the village of Pawling and then by Trinity-Pawling School. Past the village, the railroad tracks edge closer to the highway as NY22 enters the scenic Harlem Valley, which lends {{its name to the}} railroad line. The road curves more gently and takes longer straightaways, with lower density of residential and commercial development. Two miles from Pawling, the Appalachian Trail crosses the road next to the line's Appalachian Trail station. The flag stop allows hikers access to the nearby Pawling Nature Preserve.|$|E
5|$|After the Tour, Simpson rode criteriums around Europe until {{crashing}} {{in central}} France; {{he returned home}} to Paris and checked himself into a hospital. Following a week's bed-rest, he rode <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> world championships at the Sachsenring in East Germany. During the race Simpson stopped to adjust his shoes {{on the right side}} of the road and was hit from behind by a car, sustaining a cut to his head which required five stitches. In the last of the classics, the Giro di Lombardia, he struggled, finishing eighty-fourth. Simpson had been in constant contact with Helen, who was now working in Stuttgart, Germany, meeting with her between races. They became engaged on Christmas Day, and originally planned to marry at the end of 1961, but in fact wed on 3 January 1961 in Doncaster, Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|Although Triple H {{failed to}} win the Royal Rumble match at the Royal Rumble, another {{championship}} opportunity arose for him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Road</b> to WrestleMania Tournament. He won the tournament, granting him a match for the WWE Championship at WrestleMania 22, where Triple H and John Cena fought in the main event for the title, which Triple H lost via submission. Later that month at Backlash, Triple H was involved in another WWE Championship match, fighting Edge and Cena in a triple threat match, where he lost again. Angered at his loss, a bloodied Triple H used his sledgehammer to attack both Edge and Cena and then performed a number of DX crotch chops. Triple H unsuccessfully attempted to win the WWE title from Cena on numerous occasions, blaming his shortcomings on Vince McMahon, which eventually led to a feud between the McMahons and Triple H.|$|E

5|$|Another {{person who}} {{took up the}} {{initiative}} in the late 1950s was Rangvald Iversen, who was plant manager at Norwegian Talc at Knarrevik. The plant had large costs freighting their products across the sound on the Alvøy–Brattholmen Ferry. In 1958, he took the initiative to conduct a traffic count, which along with estimates of increased traffic from other places that had replaced a ferry with a bridge, would give estimates for the revenue from tolls. Norwegian Talc also paid for a draft plan for a bridge. In 1959, Iversen presented an estimate that a bridge would cost NOK15.5 million, and on 19 December 1959, the council voted unanimously to recommend that a committee be established to continue work on the bridge plans. In 1960, the bridge was included <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> plan for Hordaland.|$|E
5|$|As the British {{came within}} range, the American riflemen opened fire. The American riflemen took {{cover in the}} woods, ravines and even in bends <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> and each time the British would line up in a battle line, the riflemen would fall back and fire from cover. After Hand was forced to abandon the American {{position}} along Five Mile Run, he took up a new position, a heavily wooded area on the south bank of Shabakunk Creek. Hand deployed his men in the trees where they were so well protected from view that the British could not see them as they crossed the bridge over the stream. The riflemen fired at them from point-blank range. The intense fire confused the British into thinking that the entire American army was up against them and they formed into battle lines, bringing up their cannon. The British searched the woods for {{a half an hour}} looking for the Americans, but Hand had already withdrawn to a new position.|$|E
