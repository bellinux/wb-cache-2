They also replaced a faulty video camera {{attached to the}} S1 truss. Since they worked ahead of the time-line, the two astronauts were also able to complete some get-ahead tasks.|$|E
40|$|Simulated {{lightning}} strike {{testing of the}} Redesigned Solid Rocket Motor (RSRM) field joint protection system heater assembly was performed at Thiokol Corp., Wendover Lightning Facility. Testing consisted of subjecting the lightning evaluation test article to simulated {{lightning strike}}s and evaluating the effects of <b>heater</b> <b>cable</b> transients on cables within the systems tunnel. The maximum short circuit current coupled onto a United Space Boosters, Inc. operational flight cable within the systems tunnel, induced by transients from all cables external to the systems tunnel, was 92 amperes. The maximum open-circuit voltage coupled was 316 volts. The maximum short circuit current coupled onto a United Space Boosters, Inc. operational flight cable within the systems tunnel, induced by heater power cable transients only, was 2. 7 amperes; the maximum open-circuit voltage coupled was 39 volts. All heater power cable induced coupling was due to simulated lightning discharges only, no heater operating power was applied during the test. The results showed that, for a worst-case lightning discharge, the heater power cable is responsible for a 3. 9 decibel increase in voltage coupling to operational flight cables within the systems tunnel. Testing also showed that current and voltage levels coupled onto cables within the systems tunnel are partially dependant on the relative locations of the cables within the systems tunnel...|$|E
40|$|Electronically {{monitoring}} {{whether or}} not your car block heater is connected to a mains outlet might at first seem like an arbitrary task. A device installed {{in the comfort of}} the car seating area, which tells the user at every startup {{whether or not}} his/her car is connected to a mains outlet, could have market appeal though. But in order for it to be a worthwhile idea to pursuit, a certain requirement has to be met. It {{has to be able to}} be able to accurately detect whether or not the car is connected, through a single connection; the car ground. A certain part of the voltage in the phase of the mains will be capacitively coupled upon the safety ground. By exploiting the fact that the car ground will be connected to the mains safety ground when the block <b>heater</b> <b>cable</b> is in use, a device which can detect that coupled voltage could possibly be developed. In other words, a cable monitoring unit which in actuality detects a connection to the mains safety ground through capacitive coupling, hence the title of this dissertation. This work sets out to taking appropriate measurements to find out whether or not this proposed method of safety ground detection is valid, with heavy emphasis on whether or not it is applicable to a cable monitoring unit. According to the measurement results, an appropriate device is developed. A device which can fill the function described in the previous paragraph. Development of such a device involves; proper method of supplying power which upholds a galvanically isolated floating ground, signal processing, reliable detection mechanism, and considerations to how unintentional capacitive coupling behaves. A theoretical model of the device is put forth, as well as an actual rough prototype to in practice try to prove that the concept and method is valid. Downsides and problems with the device are discussed, such as upholding an effective detection system without making the device hard and cumbersome to use. Possible solutions to these problems are also proposed. The possible future of the concept of this device is also touched upon...|$|E
40|$|The Redesigned Solid Rocket Motors (RSRM) of the Space Transportation System {{have three}} field joints that are {{protected}} by the Joint Protection Systems (JPS). The igniter heater was mounted on the igniter flange. This report documents {{the performance of the}} JPS and igniter heaters on the pad and the post-flight condition of the JPS components. All observations that were written up as Squawks and/or Problem Reports are also discussed. The primary heaters performed satisfactorily and maintained the field joint temperatures within the required temperature range. A secondary heater failed Dielectric Withstanding Voltage (DWV) test during the joint closeout prior to launch. This heater was not used, however, since the primary heater functioned properly. Post-test inspection revealed that pin A of the <b>heater</b> power <b>cable</b> was shorted to the connector shell. Design changes have been implemented to resolve the <b>heater</b> power <b>cable</b> problem. All field joint assemblies met all of the performance requirements...|$|R

25|$|On flight day 10, astronauts Bob Behnken and Nick Patrick {{completed}} {{the third and}} final spacewalk of the STS-130 mission. Their tasks included hooking up <b>heater</b> and data <b>cables</b> for PMA-3, removing thermal covers and launch locks on Cupola, and installing handrails on Tranquility and a video cable for another base to be installed on the Russian segment of the ISS. Bob Behnken also connected the second ammonia cooling loop and disconnected a temporary power cable on Tranquility. Once the launch locks were removed, pilot Terry Virts opened the windows on Cupola for the first time. During the day Kay Hire and Terry Virts hooked up and transferred the Cupola robotics station for its use in the future. Terry Virts also completed some transfer tasks in the morning.|$|R
50|$|ISI mark is a {{certification}} mark for industrial products in India. The mark certifies that a product {{conforms to the}} Indian Standard, mentioned as IS:xxxx {{on top of the}} mark, developed by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), the national standards body of India. The ISI mark {{is by far the most}} recognized {{certification mark}} in the Indian subcontinent. The name ISI is an abbreviation of Indian Standards Institute, the former name of the Bureau of Indian Standards. The ISI mark is mandatory for certifying products to be sold in India, like many of the electrical appliances viz; switches, electric motors, wiring <b>cables,</b> <b>heaters,</b> kitchen appliances etc., and other products like Portland cement, LPG valves, LPG cylinders, automotive tyres etc. But in the case of most other products it is voluntary.|$|R

25|$|Flight day 5 saw astronauts Nick Patrick and Bob Behnken {{perform the}} mission's first spacewalk, which began on time at 02:17 UTC. Their first {{task was to}} move the payload bay of Endeavour and prepare and release launch locks on the Tranquility module and Cupola. Once Behnken and Patrick were clear of its path, the Tranquility module {{was moved to the}} port side of the Unity node using the space station's robot arm. Before Tranquility was {{installed}} the spacewalkers removed Dextre's ORU platform and secured it to one of the truss segments to function as a backup for a platform to be installed on STS-132. Once the new module was in place, the spacewalkers proceeded to connect temporary <b>heater</b> and data <b>cables</b> between Unity and Tranquility. Behnken and Patrick were ahead of the timeline so they were also able to complete some get-ahead tasks. The spacewalk was completed six and a half hours later, on Friday, 08:49 UTC. After the spacewalk, other crew members completed transfer-related tasks. The transfers are now over halfway complete.|$|R
40|$|LCA of {{buildings}} {{has become a}} distinguished field of LCA, {{and a number of}} previous studies have found that low energy buildings generally have better life cycle performance than conventional buildings. However, there has been a lack of studies comparing low energy buildings against passive buildings. The present study evaluates life cycle performance of two passive and two low energy buildings that {{are all part of the}} housing cooperative L&# 248;v&# 229;shagen in Bergen. Construction of the housing cooperative was completed in 2009 and measured material and operational data was used in a comprehensive LCA of the whole life cycle from cradle to grave, for twelve midpoint impact categories. The functional unit is a lifetime of fifty years of one square meter BRA of a building block apartment. Heating for low energy apartments are provided by electric resistance <b>heaters</b> and heating <b>cables</b> in the bathroom floors, while hot water heating is provided by an electric water heater. Evacuated tube thermal collectors are located on the roofs and provide passive house room heating through hydronic radiators and hydronic floor heating. They also provide hot water heating for each apartment. When solar collector output is not sufficient, heating is supplied by electric resistance elements. The LCA results show practically no difference between the climate change performances of the house models, and this is largely the result of a particularly low passive house performance. In simulation-based LCA literature there appears to be a trend of over-estimating the operational performance of passive and low energy buildings, and L&# 248;v&# 229;shagen is no exception. The measured electricity consumption is high, both compared to estimations and to the results of other, simulation-based, studies. The high consumption appears to be a result of a particularly low outdoor temperature for the year of the measured data. It is recommended to monitor the electricity consumption over the next few years of operation, and if it is not significantly reduced there is reason to suspect faults in building construction or in the solar collector system. In the case of no direct defects there is reason to re-evaluate the effectiveness of solar collectors for the climatic conditions of Bergen. </p...|$|R
