In other words, the more obvious the family <b>intentions</b> <b>of</b> business owners, {{the more likely it is}} that the family is involved in business ownership and management. Specifically, one standard-score increase in family <b>intentions</b> <b>of</b> business owners led to a 4.8  % rise in family ownership, whereas the percentage of family members in management positions rose around 11.1  %.

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{explored the}} contextual factors affecting young consumers’ attitudes and their <b>intentions</b> <b>of</b> green purchase {{behavior in the}} area of consumer behavior. This study seeks to understand young consumers’ green purchase intentions based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). At the same time, this study also intends to detect variables that influence young consumers’ <b>intentions</b> <b>of</b> buying green products.   In this thesis, a quantitative approach was adopted. Using a sample of 282 young people, a survey was developed and conducted in Umeå University, Sweden. Results indicate that parental influence is the top predictor among all the variables we studied. From the correlation analyses; we can see that top three predictors are important for understanding purchase <b>intentions</b> <b>of</b> young consumers.   Influence of contextual and background factors –parents, peer, and environmental knowledge – clearly {{played an important role in}} influencing young consumers’ purchase <b>intentions</b> <b>of</b> buying green products. To the end, a proposed model is developed to understand green purchase <b>intentions</b> <b>of</b> young consumers. Implications for marketers are also discussed in this study...|$|R

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{predictive}} {{accuracy of the}} theory of planned behaviour (TPB) in relation to continuation <b>of</b> <b>intentions.</b> Three studies examined the hypothesis that continuation <b>intentions</b> <b>of</b> success and continuation <b>intentions</b> <b>of</b> failure would improve utility of the TPB in predicting and promoting social behaviour. As a new construct, continuation <b>intentions</b> <b>of</b> success and continuation <b>intentions</b> <b>of</b> failure aim to describe people's readiness to continue performance of an activity under conditions that signify successful and unsuccessful progress at behavioural outcomes. As predicted, Study 1 (N = 222, male = 107, female = 115, age = 14. 62 yrs, SD = 1. 45) and Study 2 (N = 200, male = 101, female = 98, age = 14. 29 yrs, SD =. 92) showed that continuation <b>intentions</b> <b>of</b> success and continuation <b>intentions</b> <b>of</b> failure contributed to the prediction of physical activity over and above components of the TPB, past behaviour and perceived progress. Study 3 (N = 93, male = 50, female = 42, age = 20. 53 yrs, SD = 3. 36), a study of food choice, manipulated continuation intentions and showed that participants who formed continuation intentions were more likely to eat five portions of fruit and/or vegetables than participants in a control group. Together, these findings underscore the theoretical as well as practical importance <b>of</b> distinguishing between <b>intentions</b> and continuation intentions, and the need for influence attempts to manipulate continuation intentions. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

It is found that consumers' purchase <b>intentions</b> <b>of</b> GM vegetable oil are low, indicating a considerable skepticism toward GM products. A potential reason for this skepticism is that Chinese consumers are not well informed about GM technology. Three types of information presented in the survey are found to have positive but differential impacts on consumers' purchase intentions. This signals that different information strategies may be implemented to influence Chinese consumers' purchase <b>intentions</b> <b>of</b> GM products...|$|R
