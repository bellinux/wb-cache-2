5|$|Helium <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>always</b> placed above neon (which {{is in the}} p-block) in the {{periodic}} table as a noble gas, although it is occasionally placed above beryllium due to their similar electron configuration.|$|E
50|$|An {{aircraft}} engine is the {{component of the}} propulsion system for an aircraft that generates mechanical power. Aircraft engines <b>are</b> <b>almost</b> <b>always</b> either lightweight piston engines or gas turbines, except for small multicopter UAVs which <b>are</b> <b>almost</b> <b>always</b> electric aircraft.|$|R

5|$|Hydrochloric acid is {{prepared}} by dissolving hydrogen chloride in water. Hydrogen chloride {{can be generated}} in many ways, and thus several precursors to hydrochloric acid exist. The large-scale production of hydrochloric acid <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>always</b> integrated with the industrial scale production of other chemicals.|$|E
5|$|Western jackdaws entreat their {{partners}} to preen them by showing their nape and ruffling their head feathers. Birds mainly preen each other's head and neck. Known as allopreening, this behaviour <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>always</b> done between birds of a mated pair.|$|E
5|$|A viral genome, {{irrespective}} of nucleic acid type, <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>always</b> either single-stranded or double-stranded. Single-stranded genomes consist of an unpaired nucleic acid, analogous to one-half of a ladder split down the middle. Double-stranded genomes consist of two complementary paired nucleic acids, analogous to a ladder. The virus particles of some virus families, {{such as those}} belonging to the Hepadnaviridae, contain a genome that is partially double-stranded and partially single-stranded.|$|E

5|$|Most {{people with}} SCI have {{problems}} with the body's physical sexual arousal response. Problems that result directly from impaired neural transmission are called primary sexual dysfunction. The function of the genitals <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>always</b> affected by SCI, by alteration, reduction, or complete loss of sensation. Neuropathic pain, in which damaged nerve pathways signal pain {{in the absence of}} any noxious stimulus, is common after SCI and interferes with sex.|$|E
5|$|Some sites along Shackleton's rim receive almost {{constant}} illumination. At these locales sunlight <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>always</b> {{available for}} conversion into electricity using solar panels, potentially making them good locations for future Moon landings. The temperature {{at this site}} is also more favorable than at more equatorial latitudes as it does not experience the daily temperature extremes of 100°C when the Sun is overhead, to as low as −150°C during the lunar night.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{routes to}} elemental boron involved {{the reduction of}} boric oxide with metals such as magnesium or aluminium. However, the product <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>always</b> contaminated with borides of those metals. Pure boron can be prepared by reducing volatile boron halides with hydrogen at high temperatures. Ultrapure boron {{for use in the}} semiconductor industry is produced by the decomposition of diborane at high temperatures and then further purified with the zone melting or Czochralski processes.|$|E

50|$|Glottalic sounds {{may involve}} {{motion of the}} larynx upward or downward, {{producing}} an egressive or ingressive glottalic airstream mechanism respectively. An egressive glottalic airstream produces ejective consonants, while an ingressive glottalic airstream produces implosive consonants. Ejectives <b>are</b> <b>almost</b> <b>always</b> voiceless stops (plosives) or affricates, while implosives <b>are</b> <b>almost</b> <b>always</b> voiced stops.|$|R

5|$|Caldas has a {{tradition}} of embroidery (bordado) possibly dating to the 15th century. Legend has it that Queen Leonor's handmaidens, seeing the monarch without her usual brilliance after selling off her jewellery, embroidered her cloak so that it appeared to have golden threads. Caldas embroidery <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>always</b> made with three shades of molasses brown thread on white linen, and on rare occasion with white thread on brown linen. Known for its symmetry, the craft's common themes include arachnids, spirals, angles, birds, hearts, crowns, and shrimp nets.|$|E
5|$|Rice is {{the basic}} {{ingredient}} in ceremonial dishes, and {{is a very important}} element of Palestinian meals. Rice dishes are usually the main dish of Palestinian dinner, because they consist of a variety of ingredients commonly found within the Palestinian land. Rice is usually not served alone or as a side dish (see ruz ma lahma below), but rather it is incorporated within a larger dish or tabeekh (dish), that would include soups, vegetables, and meat (chicken or lamb). Meat <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>always</b> present in Palestinian dishes.|$|E
5|$|The Itchy & Scratchy Show {{is a show}} {{within a}} show that appears {{occasionally}} in episodes of The Simpsons. They typically appear {{in the form of}} 12-60 second cartoons that are filled with gratuitous violence, usually initiated by Itchy the mouse against Scratchy the cat; Itchy <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>always</b> the victor. Itchy & Scratchy airs as a segment on The Krusty the Clown Show, and also aired on its brief replacements, Sideshow Bob's Cavalcade of Whimsy and Gabbo.|$|E

5|$|The bounded weak echo region, {{also known}} as a BWER or a vault, is a radar {{signature}} within a thunderstorm characterized by a local minimum in radar reflectivity at low levels which extends upward into, and is surrounded by, higher reflectivities aloft. This feature is associated with a strong updraft and <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>always</b> found in the inflow region of a thunderstorm. It cannot be seen visually. The BWER has been noted on radar imagery of severe thunderstorms since 1973 and has a lightning detection system equivalent known as a lightning hole.|$|E
5|$|The two neurotransmitters {{that are}} used most widely in the {{vertebrate}} brain are glutamate, which almost always exerts excitatory effects on target neurons, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>always</b> inhibitory. Neurons using these transmitters {{can be found in}} nearly every part of the brain. Because of their ubiquity, drugs that act on glutamate or GABA tend to have broad and powerful effects. Some general anesthetics act by reducing the effects of glutamate; most tranquilizers exert their sedative effects by enhancing the effects of GABA.|$|E
5|$|The willie wagtail <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>always</b> on {{the move}} and rarely still {{for more than a}} few moments during {{daylight}} hours. Even while perching it will flick its tail from side to side, twisting about looking for prey. Birds are mostly encountered singly or in pairs, although they may gather in small flocks. Unlike other fantails, much of its time is spent on the ground. It beats its wings deeply in flight, interspersed with a swift flying dip. It characteristically wags its tail upon landing after a short dipping flight.|$|E

5|$|Uranium is a {{naturally}} occurring element {{that can be}} found in low levels within all rock, soil, and water. Uranium is the 51st element in order of abundance in the Earth's crust. Uranium is also the highest-numbered element to be found naturally in significant quantities on Earth and <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>always</b> found combined with other elements. The decay of uranium, thorium, and potassium-40 in the Earth's mantle is thought to be the main source of heat that keeps the outer core liquid and drives mantle convection, which in turn drives plate tectonics.|$|E
5|$|Worldwide {{production}} of thorium {{is a few}} tens of tons per year. The low demand makes working mines for extraction of thorium alone not profitable, and it <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>always</b> extracted with the rare earths, which themselves may be by-products of {{production of}} other minerals. The current reliance on monazite for production is due to thorium being largely produced as a by-product; other sources such as thorite contain more thorium and could easily be used for production if demand rose. Present knowledge {{of the distribution of}} thorium resources is poor, as low demand has led to exploration efforts being relatively minor.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{official}} forms of their respective languages, the four linguistic regions of Switzerland also have their local dialectal forms. The role played by dialects in each linguistic region varies dramatically: in the German-speaking regions, Swiss German dialects have become ever more prevalent since {{the second half of}} the 20th century, especially in the media, such as radio and television, and are used as an everyday language, while the Swiss variety of Standard German <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>always</b> used instead of dialect for written communication (c.f. diglossic usage of a language). Conversely, in the French-speaking regions the local dialects have almost disappeared (only 6.3% of the population of Valais, 3.9% of Fribourg, and 3.1% of Jura still spoke dialects at the end of the 20th century), while in the Italian-speaking regions dialects are mostly limited to family settings and casual conversation.|$|E
