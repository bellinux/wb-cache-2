5000|$|Users {{could control}} {{placement}} of text by means of: margins; indentation; normal tab stops; <b>decimal</b> <b>tab</b> stops, which set {{the position of}} the decimal point rather than the start of a number; and left, right or full justification. Different combinations of these settings, called [...] "layouts", were automatically numbered, which made it possible to re-use layouts and to make changes that applied to all parts of a document where a specified layout was used. These facilities could be used for presenting tables.|$|E
5000|$|Adjacent fields must be {{separated}} by a single comma. However, [...] "CSV" [...] formats vary greatly in this choice of separator character. In particular, in locales where the comma {{is used as a}} <b>decimal</b> separator, semicolon, <b>TAB,</b> or other characters are used instead.|$|R
2500|$|To {{facilitate}} typewriter use {{in business}} settings, a tab (tabulator) key was {{added in the}} late nineteenth century. Before using the key, the operator had to set mechanical [...] "tab stops", pre-designated locations to which the carriage would advance when the tab key was pressed. This facilitated the typing of columns of numbers, freeing the operator from the need to manually position the carriage. The first models had one tab stop and one tab key; later ones allowed as many stops as desired, and sometimes had multiple tab keys, each of which moved the carriage a different number of spaces ahead of the <b>decimal</b> point (the <b>tab</b> stop), to facilitate the typing of columns with numbers of different length ($1.00, $10.00, $100.00, etc.) ...|$|R
