5|$|Critics {{praised the}} game's concept, {{gameplay}} and addictiveness. The intensity {{of trying to}} keep the reaper alive was highlighted by some reviewers, such as saving the reaper's life by killing a large number of Cuties. Some issues, such as the lack of special effects and enemies, were highlighted; this <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>prevent</b> reviewers from rating the game positively overall.|$|E

5|$|During wartime, Swift {{became a}} special constable with {{responsibility}} for traffic control. He was enrolled in the RAF, and travelled to France after the Invasion of Normandy, but was stationed well behind the front line and did not see combat.

5|$|Following a poor {{first half}} of the 2008–09 campaign, it was {{announced}} in January 2009 that Roeder had been relieved of his first team duties.

This led to fruitful interaction between both sides in different fields of economic activity, particularly in agriculture and trade.|$|E

5|$|Scouting in South Africa, {{as in most}} British Colonies (such as Rhodesia), was {{originally}} segregated by race.

The Pathfinder Council was formed in 1929.|$|E

5|$|A dandy, Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești himself led {{a life of}} luxury, {{marked by}} excess, and had by then become a drug addict. He was a proud {{homosexual}} (or bisexual), which <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>prevent</b> him from keeping as his concubine a younger woman, {{commonly referred to as}} Domnica ("Little Lady") or Mica ("Little One"). Born Alexandra Colanoski, she was born in 1894 to Romanian Poles from Bessarabia, and, according to memoirist Constantin Beldie, had previously been a prostitute at a nightclub.|$|E

5|$|Although Swift {{knew that}} the Duchess of Kendal was {{responsible}} for selling the patent to Wood, he rarely mentions this fact in the Letters. Instead, his first three letters describe Wood as the mastermind behind the patent.

5|$|On 14 October 1920, Finland and Soviet Russia {{signed the}} Treaty of Tartu, {{confirming}} the new Finnish-Soviet border {{as the old}} border between the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland and Imperial Russia proper. In addition, Finland received Petsamo, with its ice-free harbour on the Arctic Ocean. The treaty <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>prevent</b> the Finnish government from allowing volunteers {{to cross the border}} to support the East-Karelian Uprising in 1921 however, nor expatriate Finnish communists from causing disturbances in Finland. In 1923 both countries signed the Border Peace Agreement, which normalized the border.|$|E
5|$|The Tribunal {{consists}} of {{not less than}} three judges of the Supreme Court. Its opinions are binding on all other courts. Since the Tribunal was established in 1994, to date only one constitutional question {{has been referred to}} it. The Tribunal determined in 1995 that although Article 5(2A) was not in force, Article 22H(1) <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>prevent</b> Parliament from restricting the President's discretionary powers through a constitutional amendment. Since then, there have been several unsuccessful attempts to persuade Cabinet to invoke the Article 100 procedure.|$|E

5|$|Two {{centuries before}} Mau and the Hōkūle‘a, Captain James Cook, {{with the help}} of Tupaia, gained {{knowledge}} that otherwise would have been closely held. Before his death in 1779, Cook hypothesized that Polynesians shared common ancestry; he even pinned their origin to Asia. However, Cook's theory <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>prevent</b> debate among scholars. Before the Hōkūle‘a voyage in 1976, academic debate about the settlement of Polynesia was divided between several schools of thought.|$|E
5|$|Black {{churches in}} Maryland hosted many musical, {{as well as}} {{political}} and educational, activities, and many African American musicians got their start performing in churches, including Anne Brown, Marian Anderson, Ethel Ennis and Cab Calloway, in the 20th century. Doctrinal disputes <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>prevent</b> musical cooperation, which included both sacred and secular music. Church choirs frequently worked together, even across denominational divides, and church-goers often visited other establishments to see visiting performers. Organists were a major part of African American church music in Baltimore, and some organists became well known, Baltimore's including Sherman Smith of Union Baptist, Luther Mitchell of Centennial Methodist and Julia Calloway of Sharon Baptist. Many churches also offered music education, beginning as early as the 1870s with St. Francis Academy.|$|E
5|$|Detractors of {{the flag}} movement, {{including}} Motilal Nehru, soon hailed the Swaraj flag {{as a symbol of}} national unity. Thus, the flag became a significant structural component of the institution of India. In contrast to the subdued responses of the past, the British Indian government took greater cognisance of the new flag, and began to define a policy of response. The British parliament discussed public use {{of the flag}}, and based on directives from England, the British Indian government threatened to withdraw funds from municipalities and local governments that <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>prevent</b> the display of the Swaraj flag. The Swaraj flag became the official flag of Congress at the 1931 meeting. However, by then, the flag had already become the symbol of the independence movement.|$|E

5|$|For Native Americans, Pontiac's War {{demonstrated}} {{the possibilities of}} pan-tribal cooperation in resisting Anglo-American colonial expansion. Although the conflict divided tribes and villages, the war also saw the first extensive multi-tribal resistance to European colonization in North America, {{and was the first}} war between Europeans and Native North Americans that did not end in complete defeat for the Native Americans. The Proclamation of 1763 ultimately <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>prevent</b> British colonists and land speculators from expanding westward, and so Native Americans found it necessary to form new resistance movements. Beginning with conferences hosted by Shawnees in 1767, in the following decades leaders such as Joseph Brant, Alexander McGillivray, Blue Jacket, and Tecumseh would attempt to forge confederacies that would revive the resistance efforts of Pontiac's War.|$|E
5|$|Pierce {{was unable}} to secure the {{nomination}} at the national convention, so Breckinridge switched his support to Stephen Douglas, but the combination of Pierce and Douglas supporters <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>prevent</b> James Buchanan's nomination. After Douglas's floor manager, William Richardson, suggested that nominating Breckinridge for vice president would help Buchanan secure the support of erstwhile Douglas backers in the general election, Louisiana's J. L. Lewis nominated him. Breckinridge declined in deference to Linn Boyd but received 51 votes on the first ballot, behind Mississippi's John A. Quitman with 59, but ahead of third-place Boyd, who garnered 33. On the second ballot, Breckinridge received overwhelming support, and opposition delegates changed their votes to make his nomination unanimous.|$|E
5|$|The V-2 {{damage to}} Timothy Bloodworth was {{considered}} slight, so it <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>prevent</b> her from sailing from Antwerp two days later.

She put in at Gibraltar on 23 February and sailed for Oran. From that port {{she returned to}} Hampton Roads on 24 March in convoy GUS 76. Timothy Bloodworth next sailed from New York for Liverpool, Southend, and Antwerp, arriving at the latter port on 30 April. She was at Antwerp on Victory in Europe Day. Timothy Bloodworths last reported movement was in convoy ATM 168 from Antwerp to Southend on 28/29 May.|$|E
