25|$|On April 28, 2016, Massport {{approved}} {{funding for}} the installation of a Category IIIb instrument landing system at ORH. The geographic location of the airport, {{on top of the}} tallest hill in the city reaching approximately 1,000 feet above sea level, leaves Worcester on average with 40 more days of fog a year than nearby Boston. The installation of the Category IIIb landing system will allow aircraft to land and depart in virtually all weather conditions. There are no Category IIIc airports in the United States; it is simply not allowed for safety reasons. The installation of the landing system also will include a <b>jug-handle</b> taxiway at the approach end of Runway 11. Construction has begun and the ILS is expected to be operational sometime in late 2017. Once it is completed, new service with JetBlue Airways will begin to John F. Kennedy International Airport.|$|E
60|$|Silas ate {{his dinner}} more silently than usual, soon laying down his knife and fork, and {{watching}} half-abstractedly Eppie's play with Snap and the cat, by which her own dining was made rather a lengthy business. Yet {{it was a}} sight that might well arrest wandering thoughts: Eppie, with the rippling radiance of her hair and the whiteness of her rounded chin and throat set off by the dark-blue cotton gown, laughing merrily as the kitten held on with her four claws to one shoulder, like a design for a <b>jug-handle,</b> while Snap on the right hand and Puss on the other put up their paws towards a morsel which she held {{out of the reach}} of both--Snap occasionally desisting in order to remonstrate with the cat by a cogent worrying growl on the greediness and futility of her conduct; till Eppie relented, caressed them both, and divided the morsel between them.|$|E
500|$|... "On Lickerish Hill" [...] is a {{retelling of}} the Rumplestiltskin tale. Narrated by the 17th-century Suffolk bride Miranda Sowreston, it tells {{of how she}} resorts to magic to spin enough flax to satisfy her husband's demands. As Hoyle explains, {{in order to avoid}} [...] "imprisonment, murder, dismemberment, or sexual slavery", Miranda must defeat not only her captor but also the man {{attempting}} to save her. The story satirizes the antiquarian John Aubrey and his ilk, as Aubrey's advice to Miranda and her husband turns out to be largely worthless. Written {{in the form of an}} old diary, the text includes archaic spellings; for example, Miranda's assistant is described as [...] " [...] small black thinge. Hairie. Legges like <b>jug-handles.</b> Face – not a bitt handsome." ...|$|R
40|$|Performances {{according}} to antique dramas and their revamps by Lithuanian directors of 1925 to 2003 {{are presented in}} the article. Performances of Sophocles’ and Euripides’ tragedies are discussed wider. Scilicet: “Oedipus at Colonus” by Borisas Dauguvietis (1939), “Oedipus the King” by Juozas Miltinis (1977), “Electra” by Irena Kriauzaitė (1993), “Medea” by Linas Marijus Zaikauskas (1994), “Oedipus the King” by Rimas Tuminas (1998), “Antigonė” by Birutė Marcinkevičiūtė (Mar) (1999) and “Oedipus the King” by Oskaras Koršunovas (2002). Scenography and direction of performances, interpretation of antique text and particularity of development of performances’ form and content are analyzed in the article. Scenography of performances changed from realistic (by B. Dauguvietis) and static (by J. Miltinis) portrayal of antique theatre to modern (by L. M. Zaikauskas), plastic (by R. Tuminas) with vivid reflection of today’s realia (by O. Koršunovas). B. Dauguvietis has saved almost authentic form of antique performance and has rejected only from masks and cothurni. Idea of antique marble statuary playing in the tragedy of “Oedipus the King” was rendered in J. Miltinis’ performance. Role of chorus was retained in these performances; original text was not changed or shortened. Plays by I. Kriauzaitė and B. Marcinkevičiūtė were up-to-date, without antique costumes and masks, and distinguished from other plays with its minimalist direction and scenography. Chorus parts, which were acted by one actress, were shortened in “Electra”. Director and actress B. Marcinkevičiūtė herself performed all personages in tragedy and tragedy’s chorus was represented by video projection in “Antigonė”. Later performances of antique dramas were modernized {{not only in the}} meaning of form but of content, too. Greek tragedy’s text remained plot’s pattern in L. M. Zaikauskas’ and O. Koršunovas’ performances, through which present-day realia were revealed: women emancipation was revealed in “Medea” and politician’s caricature – in “Oedipus the King”. Antique chorus role was retained in both performances, while masks – in Koršunovas’ performance. Scenography was abstract in “Oedipus the King” by Tuminas, neither representing antiquity nor nowadays. A conclusion is drawn that most Lithuanian directors trended into creation of <b>jug-handled,</b> idealized character (B. Dauguvietis, J. Miltinis, I. Kriauzaitė, B. Marcinkevičiūtė), melodramaticallity (I. Kriauzaitė, L. M. Zaikauskas) or tragicomedy (R. Tuminas). None of directors managed to show universality of antique tragedy so that both past and present would be reflected in it. They, using texts of antique tragedy, created modern picture of distinctive, idealized and psychologized, alone, reserved, depending on destiny human being...|$|R

Near the middle of the main canyon's length is Jacob Hamblin Archalso known as Lobo Archwhich is large enough to reach under an overhang {{on the opposite side of}} the canyon. Further downstream within the canyon is Coyote Natural Bridge, a small hole carved in a large sandstone fin. Still further downstream is Cliff Arch, a <b>jug-handle</b> style arch in the north wall of the canyon. Finally, just outside the mouth of the canyon and high above the Escalante River, is Stevens Arch with an opening approximately 220 ft wide.|$|E
