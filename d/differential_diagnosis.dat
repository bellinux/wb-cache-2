5|$|Acute {{beryllium}} {{disease in the}} form of chemical pneumonitis was first reported in Europe in 1933 and in the United States in 1943. A survey found that about 5% of workers in plants manufacturing fluorescent lamps in 1949 in the United States had beryllium-related lung diseases. Chronic berylliosis resembles sarcoidosis in many respects, and the <b>differential</b> <b>diagnosis</b> is often difficult. It killed some early workers in nuclear weapons design, such as Herbert L. Anderson.|$|E

The <b>differential</b> radiologic <b>diagnosis</b> of PIT includes low-grade malignant tumor, metastatic lung tumor, hamartoma, sclerosing hemangioma, lipoma, and angiolipoma. Performing a preoperative diagnosis is difficult, and most PITs are diagnosed postoperatively [10].|$|R

Pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, Whipple's disease, coeliac disease, and laxative abuse should also be considered. The <b>differential</b> <b>diagnosis</b> can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).|$|E
5|$|The <b>differential</b> <b>diagnosis</b> for heel pain is {{extensive}} and includes pathological entities including, {{but not limited}} to the following: calcaneal stress fracture, calcaneal bursitis, osteoarthritis, spinal stenosis involving the nerve roots of lumbar spinal nerve 5 (L5) or sacral spinal nerve 1 (S1), calcaneal fat pad syndrome, hypothyroidism, seronegative spondyloparthopathies such as reactive arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, or rheumatoid arthritis (more likely if pain is present in both heels), plantar fascia rupture, and compression neuropathies such as tarsal tunnel syndrome or impingement of the medial calcaneal nerve.|$|E

Dermatologic manifestations of systemic illnesses such as the rash of secondary syphilis may also be confused with psoriasis.|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{analyze and}} {{identify}} the fatty acids found in homemade ghee and in olive oil and compare those to fatty acids found in bronchoalevolar lavage of children with lipoid pneumonia. Methods: The fatty acids found in homemade fat ”Ghee” and olive oil were analyzed by gas chromatography. Methyl ester derivatives suitable for GC analysis were prepared directly from olive oil or from Ghee using anhydrous methanolic-HCl. Bronchoscopy and bronchoalevolar lavage was performed in eight children aged between 2 and 4 years, all with history of using homemade ghee and/or olive oil in the recumbent position. Results: The analysis of fatty acids in Ghee and olive oil show similar gas chromatographic pattern as those of bronchoalevolar lavage. Conclusion: The three fatty acids responsible for the deleterious effects of lipoid pneumonia were identified. Lipoid pneumonia {{should be one of}} the <b>differentials</b> <b>diagnosis</b> in children  presenting with respiratory distress.

40|$|Candy", a seven {{year old}} female spayed beagle mix, {{presented}} to Cornell's Companion Animal Hospital's Emergency Service on 4 / 2 / 05 with a chief complaint of seizures. Candy was depressed and minimally responsive at initial presentation, which was {{two hours after}} receiving valium from her referring veterinarian. <b>Differentials</b> <b>diagnosis</b> included cerebral neoplasia, hepatic dysfunction, toxicity or other causes of seizures in a seven year old canine.

Candy was taken to surgery for removal of the insulin secreting tumor and metastasis. She recovered well from surgery.

5|$|The most {{important}} <b>differential</b> <b>diagnosis</b> in gout is septic arthritis. This {{should be considered}} in those with signs of infection or those who do not improve with treatment. To help with diagnosis, a synovial fluid Gram stain and culture may be performed.

Gouty tophi, in particular when not located in a joint, can be mistaken for basal cell carcinoma or other neoplasms.|$|E
5|$|Further {{neurological}} examinations {{are crucial}} in the <b>differential</b> <b>diagnosis</b> of AD and other diseases.

A caregiver's viewpoint is particularly important, since a person with AD is commonly unaware of his own deficits. Many times, families also have difficulties in the detection of initial dementia symptoms and may not communicate accurate information to a physician.|$|E

These infections are typically classified as a urethritis rather than a urinary tract infection. Vaginitis may also {{be due to a}} yeast infection. Interstitial cystitis (chronic pain in the bladder) may be considered for people who experience multiple episodes of UTI symptoms but urine cultures remain negative and not improved with antibiotics. Prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate) may also be considered in the <b>differential</b> <b>diagnosis.</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Differential</b> {{serological}} <b>diagnosis</b> of Chagas {{disease and}} leishmaniasis is difficult owing to cross-reactivity {{resulting from the}} fact that the parasites that cause these pathologies share antigenic epitopes.

Therefore, new se-rological tests with high sensitivity and specificity are needed.

5|$|Lung cancer often {{appears as}} a solitary {{pulmonary}} nodule on a chest radiograph. However, the <b>differential</b> <b>diagnosis</b> is wide. Many other diseases can also give this appearance, including metastatic cancer, hamartomas, and infectious granulomas such as tuberculosis, histoplasmosis and coccidioidomycosis. Lung cancer can also be an incidental finding, as a solitary pulmonary nodule on a chest radiograph or CT scan done for an unrelated reason. The definitive diagnosis of lung cancer is based on histological examination of the suspicious tissue {{in the context of}} the clinical and radiological features.|$|E
5|$|Medical {{conditions}} that inhibit consciousness are considered disorders of consciousness. This category generally includes minimally conscious state and persistent vegetative state, but sometimes {{also includes the}} less severe locked-in syndrome and more severe chronic coma. <b>Differential</b> <b>diagnosis</b> of these disorders is an active area of biomedical research. Finally, brain death results in an irreversible disruption of consciousness. While other conditions may cause a moderate deterioration (e.g., dementia and delirium) or transient interruption (e.g., grand mal and petit mal seizures) of consciousness, they {{are not included in}} this category.|$|E
5|$|The team {{employs the}} <b>differential</b> <b>diagnosis</b> method, listing {{possible}} etiologies on a whiteboard, then eliminating most of them, usually {{because one of}} the team (most often House) provides logical reasons for ruling them out. Typically, the patient is misdiagnosed at least once and accordingly receives some treatments that are at best useless; this usually causes further complications, but—as the nature of the complications often provides valuable new evidence—eventually these help them diagnose the patient correctly. House often tends to arrive at the correct diagnosis seemingly out of the blue, often inspired by a passing remark made by another character. Diagnoses range from relatively common to very rare diseases.|$|E

5|$|The {{diagnostic}} {{complexities of}} RAD mean that careful diagnostic evaluation by a trained mental health expert with particular expertise in <b>differential</b> <b>diagnosis</b> is considered essential. Several other disorders, such as conduct disorders, oppositional defiant disorder, anxiety disorders, post traumatic stress disorder and social phobia share many symptoms {{and are often}} comorbid with or confused with RAD, leading to over and under diagnosis. RAD can also be confused with neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism, pervasive developmental disorder, childhood schizophrenia and some genetic syndromes. Infants with this disorder can be distinguished from those with organic illness by their rapid physical improvement after hospitalization. Autistic children {{are likely to be}} of normal size and weight and often exhibit a degree of intellectual disability. They are unlikely to improve upon being removed from the home.|$|E
