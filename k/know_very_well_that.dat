25|$|Much of {{the humor}} of The Order of the Stick {{is based on}} roleplaying games (particularly the Dungeons and Dragons 3rd Edition ruleset), with {{characters}} freely discussing game mechanics, such as experience points, skill sets, and random encounters. The characters <b>know</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>that</b> {{they live in a}} world controlled by the rules of roleplaying games, but attempt to function normally within it, often with nonsensical results. Characters have been shown browsing through rulebooks for the D game to select a certain monster for use, or to learn about a new class. Common techniques of players and Dungeon Masters are spoofed, such as the weather of the campaign world changing to herald a dramatic encounter, or a player who does not bother to complete the details of his character's backstory. Burlew's satirical humor addresses many of the clichés of the fantasy genre as a whole, often by twisting them in new and different ways.|$|E

500|$|He {{represented}} a Mafia that controlled power {{and did not}} let power control them, according to German sociologist Henner Hess. To make a good impression, or fare figura, is important: [...] "they enjoy the respect shown them, they enjoy power, {{but they do not}} wish to give rise to its discussion. They <b>know</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>that</b> behind the veil of modesty power is felt to be all the more uncanny." [...] Italian journalist Indro Montanelli quoted a typical remark by Don Calò: ...|$|E

500|$|Lê Duẩn {{departed}} from Marxist/Leninist orthodoxy {{when it came}} to practical policy and stated that the country had to [...] "carry out agricultural cooperation immediately, even before having built large industry." [...] While he acknowledged that his view was heresy, Lê Duẩn insisted that Vietnam was in a unique situation; [...] "It seems that no country so far in history has been in a situation such as ours. We must lead the peasantry and agriculture immediately to socialism, without waiting for a developed industry, though we <b>know</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>that</b> without the strong impact of industry, agriculture cannot achieve large-scale production and new relations of agriculture cannot be consolidated... To proceed from small-scale production to large-scale production is a new one." [...] According to Lê Duẩn the key to socialism was not mechanisation and industrialisation, but a new division of labour. He also believed that cooperatives {{did not need to be}} autarkic, but rather [...] "organically connected, through the process of production itself, with other cooperatives and with the state economic sector." [...] Vietnam could achieve this through state intervention and control. He saw the economy as one whole directed by the state and not many parts intertwined.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2014, the {{external}} affairs secretary of Australia's Ahmadiyya muslims, urged the Islamic community to denounce ISIS, [...] "because they <b>know</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>that</b> ISIS {{is responsible for}} brutal, reprehensible killings of Muslims in Syria and Iraq".|$|E
2500|$|Like all {{religious}} she discovered {{the ups and}} downs related to differences in temperament, character, problems of sensitivities or infirmities. After nine years she wrote plainly, [...] "the lack of judgment, education, the touchiness of some characters, all these things do not make life very pleasant. I <b>know</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>that</b> these moral weaknesses are chronic, that there is no hope of cure". But the greatest suffering came from outside Carmel. On 23 June 1888, Louis Martin disappeared from his home and was found days later, in the post office in Le Havre. The incident marked the onset of her father's decline. He died on July 29, 1894.|$|E

2500|$|In casting Good Morning, Miss Bliss, Peter Engel {{knew the}} success of the show would not hinge on Miss Bliss herself, but on her students. Engel {{particularly}} envisioned one character, Zack Morris, who [...] "would be that incorrigible kid who could lie to your face, letting you <b>know</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>that</b> he's lying, and make you love him for it all the same." [...] Engel insisted that the show could not go on without Zack Morris, but {{he turned out to be}} one of the most difficult characters to cast. Engel's casting director, Shana Landsburg, finally happened across fourteen-year old Mark-Paul Gosselaar and was immediately struck by the teen's charisma, charm, and good looks. After a quick read-through, Gosselaar was immediately given the role.|$|E
2500|$|How {{many times}} {{has it been}} said that the art {{movement}} called Cubism is extinguished? Each time that a purge occurs the critics of the other side, who ask only that their desires be taken as facts, shout defection and howl for its death. This is nothing basically but a ruse, because Pinturrichichio , of the Carnet de la Semaine and the others <b>know</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>that</b> the serious artists of this group are extremely happy to see go... those opportunists who have taken over creations the significance of which they do not even comprehend, and were attracted only by the love of buzz and personal interest. It was predictable that these unrecommendable and compromising people would renounce their endeavors sooner or later. (Reverdy, 1918) ...|$|E
2500|$|Theo {{referred}} to these pictorial {{elements in a}} letter to Vincent dated 22 October 1889: [...] "I clearly sense what preoccupies you in the new canvases like the village in the moonlight [...] or the mountains, but I feel that the search for style takes away the real sentiment of things." [...] Vincent responded in early November, [...] "Despite what you say in your previous letter, that the search for style often harms other qualities, the fact is that I feel myself greatly driven to seek style, if you like, but I mean by that a more manly and more deliberate drawing. If that will make me more like Bernard or Gauguin, I can't do anything about it. But am inclined to believe {{that in the long run}} you'd get used to it." [...] And later in the same letter, he wrote, [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>that</b> the studies drawn with long, sinuous lines from the last consignment weren't what they ought to become, however I dare urge you to believe that in landscapes one will continue to mass things by means of a drawing style that seeks to express the entanglement of the masses." ...|$|E

2500|$|Before {{his famous}} Christmas lectures, Faraday {{delivered}} chemistry lectures for the City Philosophical Society from 1816 to 1818 {{in order to}} refine {{the quality of his}} lectures. Between 1827 and 1860 at the Royal Institution in London, Faraday gave a series of nineteen Christmas lectures for young people, a series which continues today. The objective of Faraday's Christmas lectures was to present science to the general public in the hopes of inspiring them and generating revenue for the Royal Institution. They were notable events on the social calendar among London's gentry. Over the course of several letters to his close friend Benjamin Abbott, Faraday outlined his recommendations on the art of lecturing: Faraday wrote [...] "a flame should be lighted at the commencement and kept alive with unremitting splendour to the end". His lectures were joyful and juvenile, he delighted in filling soap bubbles with various gasses (in order {{to determine whether or not}} they are magnetic) in front of his audiences and marveled at the rich colors of polarized lights, but the lectures were also deeply philosophical. In his lectures he urged his audiences to consider the mechanics of his experiments: [...] "you <b>know</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>that</b> ice floats upon water... Why does the ice float? Think of that, and philosophise". His subjects consisted of Chemistry and Electricity, and included: 1841 The Rudiments of Chemistry, 1843 First Principles of Electricity, 1848 The Chemical History of a Candle, 1851 Attractive Forces, 1853 Voltaic Electricity, 1854 The Chemistry of Combustion, 1855 The Distinctive Properties of the Common Metals, 1857 Static Electricity, 1858 The Metallic Properties, 1859 The Various Forces of Matter and their Relations to Each Other.|$|E
2500|$|... “There were a {{great many}} cowboys with the show. [...] There was a chief of the cowboys who had general {{supervision}} over both horses and men. [...] When an unbroken horse would be brought in, this cowboy chief would give it to an Indian to ride bareback. [...] After the animal was well broken, it would {{be taken away from}} the Indian and given to a cowboy to ride. [...] Then the Indian would be given another unbroken horse. [...] For a while we said nothing about it, but finally it began to be just a little too much to stand. [...] One day one of the Indians came to me just before it was time to enter the arena. [...] His horse was saddled and bridled, but he was leading the horse by the bridle. [...] I asked him what was the matter, and {{he said it was a}} wild horse and he was not going to ride it into the arena. [...] I went to the chief cowboy and said, ‘I do not think you are doing right. [...] You know our Indian boys have to ride bareback, but you always give them the wild horses to ride. [...] Then, when they have the horse nicely broken, you give to a cowboy. [...] Why don’t you give the wild horses to the cowboys to break in? [...] They ride on saddles, and it would not be so hard for them.’ [...] But the chief cowboy only said, “Well, I can’t be bothered by a little thing like that. [...] You will have to see Buffalo Bill about the horses.’ [...] But I retorted, “You <b>know</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>that</b> Buffalo Bill does not know what you do with the horses. [...] He does not know that you give the wild ones to the Indian boys to ride until they are broken in. [...] Give that horse back to that Indian boy or he will not go into the arena today.’ [...] That was all, but the boy got his horse in time to enter the arena with the others. [...] Just as I was ready to go back to the Indians, I looked at Buffalo Bill, and he had a twinkle in his eye. [...] After that, we had no more trouble with the horses. [...] Although Buffalo Bill never said anything to me, I knew he had fixed things to our satisfaction.” ...|$|E
