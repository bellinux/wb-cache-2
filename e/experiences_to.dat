Eddy died in 1859.|$|E
5|$|Most {{reviews of}} the {{collection}} were positive, applauding how Dalrymple had utilised his <b>experiences</b> <b>to</b> create a work that gives a transparent look at poverty in England.

5|$|Our perceptual {{experiences}} {{depend on}} stimuli that arrive at our various sensory organs from the external world, and these stimuli cause {{changes in our}} mental states, ultimately causing us to feel a sensation, which may be pleasant or unpleasant. Someone's desire for a slice of pizza, for example, will tend to cause that person to move his or her body in a specific manner and in a specific direction to obtain {{what he or she}} wants. The question, then, is how it can be possible for conscious <b>experiences</b> <b>to</b> arise out of a lump of gray matter endowed with nothing but electrochemical properties.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} with {{a theme of}} individuality, which was manifested in the extensive customization options, {{the presence of a}} narrative, and the product's characterization as an adventure game. Real-world professional skateboarders contributed their <b>experiences</b> <b>to</b> the plot. Upon release, the game was a major critical and commercial success, with reviewers praising its wide appeal, soundtrack, customization, multiplayer, and plot. The graphics and the controls for driving vehicles and walking were less well received. Undergrounds PlayStation 2 version had sold 2.11 million copies in the United States by December 2007. A sequel, Underground 2, was released in 2004.|$|E
40|$|In {{my desire}} to trace further the {{meanings}} and traditions sedimented in the term aesthetic, inherited and being reconstructed, I am drawn to my knowings of the beach {{as a place to}} begin. I know aesthetic <b>experience</b> <b>to</b> be a disclosive dynamic revealing the fore-understandings that have shaped my way of seeing and being. I am a living embodiment of these structures. I know aesthetic <b>experience</b> <b>to</b> depend on this sense of placedness. It is an ongoing search for attunement that assumes and acknowledges the pres¬ence of cognitive, affective, and somatic dimensions. I turn to my own know¬ing of aesthetic <b>experience</b> <b>to</b> offer a living experience of what placedness means. In so doing I remember John Dewey 2 ̆ 7 s words calling for 2 ̆ 2 aesthetic <b>experience</b> <b>to</b> tell its own tale...|$|R

5|$|An online version, Black & White: The Gathering, was in development, {{and would}} have enabled creatures to {{interact}} those of other players in a cut-down game environment over the internet. Lionhead planned to release Black & White: The Gathering {{two months before the}} main game's release as a free download, and it was to offer a choice of creatures. It would have linked with chat programs such as AOL instant messenger and ICQ and convert text to a speech bubble from the creature. It was intended for players to be able to upload the main game's creature into Black & White: The Gathering and its <b>experiences</b> <b>to</b> be saved into the main game. Another online program, Black & White Worlds, was in development. This would have taken place in the worlds of the main game. Molyneux explained that there was to be a server, whose worlds would have been set up with a match-making system and players {{would have been able to}} do battle, like last man standing. There was also a plan to produce Black & White Universe, in which players would have had a persistent online world.|$|E
