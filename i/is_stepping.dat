Until the early 2000s the area had a police station which served as the headquarters for the west Stockport area. The building, which opened in 1912, was sold in 2006 and converted into flats.|$|E

Daniel later tells Wilhelmina that he <b>is</b> <b>stepping</b> down as editor of MODE and gives her his job.|$|E
5|$|A set of {{fourteen}} redesigned Major Arcana tarot cards, {{based on the}} Rider-Waite deck, were commissioned by the singer for the album's artwork. The cards depict band members in surrealistic tableau. Each card was reinterpreted to reflect the iconography of the album's lyrical content: The Fool <b>is</b> <b>stepping</b> off a cliff, with grainy images of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and a JFK campaign poster in the background; The Emperor, with prosthetic legs, {{is sitting in a}} wheelchair clutching a rifle in front of an American flag; Justice weighs the Bible against the brain on his balance scale. The album's inner sleeve contains these three images, along with a further nine: The Magician, The High Priestess, The Hierophant, The Hermit, Death, The Devil, The Tower, The Star and The World. The cover itself represents The Hanged Man.|$|E

25|$|The {{community}} services district did not advertise or list {{the land for}} sale, a practice required by counties and many other public agencies seeking top dollar on behalf of taxpayers. District general manager Carole McGreevy, who <b>is</b> <b>stepping</b> down from that position in late 2006 and retiring in late 2007, said the district proclaimed the land surplus in the early 1990s after {{it was no longer}} needed for flood control.

25|$|Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong {{attended}} the day's meetings. The Program of Seminars ends {{on this day}} and delegates discussed {{about the future of}} global economy, poverty and the future of Asia. Ministers {{of the members of the}} International Monetary Fund approved a plan to give more powers and voting rights to People's Republic of China, Mexico, South Korea and Turkey. This vote had 90.6% of the members supporting the move. However, the IMF remains dominated by Europe, the United States and Japan. China has less power in the IMF, although its economy is larger than Belgium and Netherlands combined. The IMF and World Bank have been criticised by Brazil, Argentina, Asian and African nations for prescribing severe belt-tightening measures during their economic crisis. The American government sees the reform of the IMF to redress global economic imbalances, which were cited as one of the biggest menaces to world growth. The IMF <b>is</b> <b>stepping</b> up in its financial surveillance through multilateral consultations to make it more effective and relevant. The World Bank president Paul Wolfowitz said that the poor should not be abandoned because their governments are weak, otherwise the people would be penalised twice. The IMF and World Bank see the need to combat corruption in developing countries. The World Bank will work with developing countries by working with countries or offered through projects on the countries itself. Wolfowitz said that the issue of governance is being addressed, and the most important thing is to take the principles in the paper, applying it in terms of budget allocation. Matters may be complicated due to lack of political will. He added that working with developing countries is a starting point and must work with banks, global organisations and other governments to stop corruption in their nations. African nations also called for more voting rights in the IMF for countries in their continent, at forums held in Africa itself.|$|E

[...] The spell is worked, and the mermaid is found by the prince, who sees the resemblance {{between her and the}} one who rescued him from drowning, although he does not realize that they are the same person. [...] Although the prince cares deeply for the mermaid, he is betrothed to the daughter of a neighboring king, and the mermaid cannot prevent their marriage.|$|E

While the other New Directions members {{accompany}} Quinn to the hospital, Rachel stays at Regionals to watch Vocal Adrenaline's performance of [...] "Bohemian Rhapsody". She asks their coach, her biological mother Shelby Corcoran (Idina Menzel), to help coach New Directions, but Shelby tells Rachel that she's tired of coaching glee clubs, and <b>is</b> <b>stepping</b> down as Vocal Adrenaline's coach to settle down and start a family.

500|$|Harries {{commented that}} he [...] "was {{interested}} {{in developing a}} quality action series out of the UK because it's something we don't do very often, but there's no reason why we shouldn't." [...] Richard Armitage called the series an [...] "ambitious project for television. But the advantage {{of that is that}} these three feature films are linked together so you get a really interesting character arc through all episodes. American television is being brave and doing that at the moment, and this <b>is</b> <b>stepping</b> into that area." [...] Former SAS soldier and the original novel's author, Chris Ryan, served as the series consultant and script advisor. Chris Ryan stated; [...] "When you produce a novel it's like a child and to see it put onto screen opens it up to a greater audience. I class myself as a storyteller now, and to tell that story on paper is a great privilege, then to see it on screen is even better." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Maz Hallima of Flavour Magazine, [...] "Do Ya Thang" [...] {{has a very}} [...] "teenager-ish vibe" [...] which {{according}} to her works well, however she is aware why Rihanna kept it as a bonus track of the album.

He further noted that Rihanna <b>is</b> <b>stepping</b> back from her [...] "hypersexual persona to sing a more earnest, good-natured tune". Michael Jepson of The Fourth State concluded that [...] "Do Ya Thang", together with [...] "Cockiness (Love It)" [...] and [...] "Roc Me Out", are the top candidates from Talk That Talk that can be labeled as the album's [...] "highlights". According to Jepson, all three songs are [...] "blatantly raunchy" [...] and feel like a follow up to Rihanna's 2011 single [...] "S" [...] (Loud, 2011). Shaun Kitchener of EntertainmentWise concluded that Rihanna [...] "takes a breather for 'Do Ya Thang', and we get a rare glimpse of Sweet Loving Rihanna instead." ...|$|E

500|$|While {{subsequently}} {{spying on}} a Vocal Adrenaline rehearsal, Rachel realizes that Shelby is her biological mother. After introducing herself, Will meets with Shelby, concerned {{that she is}} not as invested in forging a relationship as Rachel is. Shelby confesses that she can no longer have children, but wishes she could have her baby back, rather than the now fully grown Rachel, whom she feels does not need her. She tells Rachel that instead of trying to act like mother and daughter, they should just be grateful that they have met, and maintain their distance. Rachel hugs her goodbye, and they duet on an acoustic version of [...] "Poker Face". In [...] "Journey to Regionals", the show's first season finale, Rachel asks Shelby to help coach New Directions, but Shelby tells Rachel that she's tired of coaching glee clubs, and <b>is</b> <b>stepping</b> down as Vocal Adrenaline's coach to settle down and start a family.

500|$|The Archangel Michael, the {{embodiment}} and conduit of divine justice, is positioned directly below Christ, the only figure to reach both Heaven and Earth. He wears a dispassionate expression as {{he holds a}} set of scales to weigh souls. Unusually for Christian art, the damned outweigh the blessed; Michael's scales have only one soul in each pan, yet the left pan tips below the right. Michael is given unusual prominence in a [...] "Last Judgement" [...] for the period, and his powerful presence emphasises the work's function in a hospice and its preoccupation with the liturgy of death. His feet are positioned as if he <b>is</b> <b>stepping</b> forward, almost about {{to move out of}} the canvas and he looks directly at the viewer, giving the illusion of judging not only the souls in the painting but also the viewers. Michael, like Sebastian and Anthony, was a plague saint and would have been visible to inmates through the openings of the pierced screen as they lay in their beds. Michael is painted with iconographic elements associated with paintings of the Last Judgement, and is by far the most beautifully and colourfully painted figure; he is dressed in a red cope with woven golden fabrics over a shining white alb, which dominates the lower panels, [...] "hypnotically attracting the viewer's glance" [...] according to Lane. He is surrounded by four cherubs, playing trumpets to call the dead to their final destination. Michael's role in the Last Judgement is emphasised through van der Weyden's use of colour: Michael's gleaming white alb contrasts with the cherub's red vestments, set against a blue sky directly below heaven's golden clouds.|$|E
