2500|$|The {{early history}} of the {{painting}} is unknown, {{and it is not}} until {{the latter part of the}} Northern Song (960–1127) that there is any evidence for the existence of the painting. [...] The painting and its end sections have numerous seal impressions purportedly indicating the past ownership of the painting, and these provide valuable evidence for the history of the scroll; however many of these are later fabrications of ancient seals intended to increase the appeal of the painting to collectors and connoisseurs. [...] One particular seal that in the past has been used to link the painting to the Tang Dynasty imperial collection is an impression reading [...] "Seal of the Hongwen [...] " [...] (...) , which has been interpreted as referring to the Office for the <b>Dissemination</b> <b>of</b> <b>Culture</b> (弘文館), part of the Hanlin Academy. [...] However, there are indications that this seal may be a later forgery or else that it may be a genuine post-Tang seal added by a private collector with the name Hongwen, and so it is regarded with suspicion by many experts.|$|E

50|$|The Sardinian Church was an autocephalous {{institution}} for five centuries, independent {{from both the}} Byzantine and the Roman Curia.

The immigration of monastics to the island was fueled by donated funds, and local churches were built by the giudical aristocracy. However, there were still strong ties with the Eastern liturgy. In 1092 a papal bull expressly abolished the autonomy and autocephaly of the Church of Sardinia, which was placed under the primacy of the Archbishop of Pisa.|$|E

As Ariel later summarized it, he had concocted, by his mid-30s, [...] "that sentimental, idealizing blend of love, philosophy, Christianity, and socialism which dominated his spiritual chemistry" [...] the rest of his life.The attributes ultimately propelled him away from radicalism as a substitute faith and from teaching young anarchists as an alternative vocation.
