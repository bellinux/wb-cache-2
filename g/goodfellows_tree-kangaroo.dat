50|$|Its {{appearance}} {{is similar to}} the closely related <b>Goodfellow's</b> <b>tree-kangaroo.</b> It differs from the latter by having a pinkish or lighter color face, golden shoulders, white ears and smaller size. Some authorities consider the golden-mantled tree-kangaroo as a subspecies of <b>Goodfellow's</b> <b>tree-kangaroo.</b>|$|R

50|$|Like other <b>tree-kangaroos,</b> <b>Goodfellow's</b> <b>tree-kangaroo</b> {{is quite}} {{different}} in appearance from terrestrial kangaroos. Unlike its land dwelling cousins, its legs are not disproportionately large compared to its forelimbs which are strong and end in hooked claws for grasping tree limbs, {{and it has a}} long tail for balance. All of these features help it with a predominantly arboreal existence. <b>Goodfellow's</b> <b>tree-kangaroo</b> has short, woolly fur, usually chestnut to red-brown in color, a gray-brown face, yellow-colored cheeks and feet; a pale belly, a long, golden brown tail, and two golden stripes on its backside. It weighs approximately 7 kg (about 15 lb).|$|R
50|$|Located in Koala Junction, Gum Leaf Hideout {{is home to}} the zoo's {{collection}} of numbats, koalas, <b>Goodfellow's</b> <b>tree-kangaroos,</b> and short-beaked echidnas. The exhibit also features interactive displays that teach visitors about the devastating effects of deforestation on Australian ecosystems.|$|R
50|$|The Buergers' Tree-kangaroo (Dendrolagus goodfellowi buergersi) is a {{subspecies}} of the <b>Goodfellow's</b> <b>tree-kangaroo</b> from Papua New Guinea, {{where they}} dwell mainly in tropical rainforests. Their diet consists of mostly leaves and fruit, which they find both in trees {{and on the}} ground.|$|R

50|$|The Australian House {{is one of}} the {{few places}} in Europe where koalas and <b>Goodfellow's</b> <b>tree-kangaroos</b> can be seen. There is also an aquarium, home to 1,500 species of fish from Australia's Great Barrier Reef. There are also timid rat-kangaroos, kookaburras and a variety of snakes. In nearby outdoor enclosures, there are Parma {{wallabies}} and red kangaroos, both in large enclosures.|$|R
50|$|The Zoo {{maintains}} {{a collection of}} large cats including tawny lions, white lions, Sumatran tigers, a Bengal tiger, snow leopards, cheetahs, pumas, and servals. Other mammals include brown bears, sun bears, zebras, giraffes, common eland, black-capped capuchin, common marmoset, cottontop tamarin, black-and-white ruffed lemurs, ring-tailed lemurs, black-and-white colobus, De Brazza's monkey, red pandas, and Oriental small-clawed otters.Also on display are <b>Goodfellow's</b> <b>tree-kangaroos,</b> African wild dogs.|$|R
50|$|Birds {{and other}} animals named for Goodfellow include the Taiwan {{firecrest}} (Regulus goodfellowi), the Taiwan subspecies of the white-browed shortwing (Brachypteryx montana goodfellowi), slaty-backed jungle-flycatcher (Rhinomyias goodfellowi), black-masked white-eye (Lophozosterops goodfellowi), Goodfellow's tuco-tuco (Ctenomys goodfellowi), and <b>Goodfellow's</b> <b>tree-kangaroo</b> (Dendrolagus goodfellowi). The lyre-tailed king bird of paradise was described by Ogilvie-Grant in 1907 with the binomen of Cicinnurus goodfellowi, though it has subsequently {{been found to be}} a hybrid.|$|R
50|$|<b>Goodfellow's</b> <b>tree-kangaroo</b> is {{slow and}} clumsy on the ground, moving at about walking pace and hopping awkwardly, leaning its body far forward to balance the heavy tail. However, in trees it is bold and agile. It climbs by {{wrapping}} its forelimbs around {{the trunk of a}} tree and hopping with the powerful hind legs, allowing the forelimbs to slide. It has extraordinary jumping ability and has been known to jump to the ground from heights of 30 feet without ill effect.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Goodfellow's</b> <b>tree-kangaroo</b> (Dendrolagus goodfellowi) {{also called}} the ornate tree-kangaroo, belongs to the family Macropodidae, which {{includes}} kangaroos, wallabies and their relatives, and the genus Dendrolagus, with eleven other species. The species is native to the rainforests of New Guinea, and the border of central Irian Jaya in Indonesia. Under the IUCN classification, the species is listed as Endangered, which {{is a result of}} overhunting and human encroachment on their habitat. [...] It is named after British zoological collector Walter Goodfellow.|$|R
50|$|In the wild, {{researchers}} have found most Matschies’ live alone or in small assemblies, containing maybe {{a mother and her}} offspring and one male. Most of the time, the groups have a sex ratio of 1:1. The Matschie’s tree-kangaroos are very closely related to Dendrolagus goodfellowi, the <b>Goodfellow’s</b> <b>tree-kangaroo,</b> which was once considered a subspecies of the Matschie’s tree-kangaroos. Matschies’ appear to be scared of humans because they scramble around when humans are nearby and they are very difficult to find in the forests. They spend about 14 to 15 hours of their days sleeping and resting. The Matschie’s tree-kangaroos are known for defending their home territory and marking their boundaries.|$|R
50|$|Belfast Zoo {{is owned}} by Belfast City Council. The council spends £1.5 million every year on running and {{promoting}} the zoo, {{which is one of}} the few local government-funded zoos in the UK and Ireland. The zoo is one of the top visitor attractions in Northern Ireland, receiving more than 295,000 visitors a year. The majority of the animals are in danger in their natural habitat. The zoo houses more than 1,200 animals of 140 species including Asian elephants, Barbary lions, Malayan sun bears (one of the few in the United Kingdom), two species of penguin, a family of western lowland gorillas, a troop of common chimpanzees, a pair of red pandas, a pair of <b>Goodfellow's</b> <b>tree-kangaroos</b> and Francois' langurs. The zoo also carries out important conservation work and takes part in European and international breeding programmes which help to ensure the survival of many species under threat.|$|R
