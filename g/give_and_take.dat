5|$|The 18th {{century was}} indeed {{the golden age of}} the chair, {{especially}} in France and England (including Colonial America), between which there was considerable <b>give</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> of ideas. Even Diderot could not refrain from writing of them in his Encyclopédie. The typical Louis Seize chair, oval-backed and ample of seat, with descending arms and round-reeded legs, covered in Beauvais or some such gay tapestry woven with Boucher or Watteau-like scenes, is a very gracious object, in which the period reached its high-water mark. The Empire brought in squat and squabby shapes, comfortable enough no doubt, but entirely destitute of inspiration. English Empire chairs were often heavier and more sombre than those of French design.|$|E

25|$|On April 22 Rodezno was {{nominated}} to Secretariado Político {{of the new}} party, Falange Española Tradicionalista, one of 4 Carlists within the 10-member body. He and other Carlists learned of the party program only once its 21 points were announced and immediately demonstrated some unease. His relations with Fal and Don Javier remained extremely tense, though falling short of total breakup; both considered him a fronding rebel. Rodezno’s efforts to elicit authorization from the regent produced no effect. During {{the next few months}} he presided over absorption into Falange rather than a fusion, bombarded with queries and protests from Carlist rank-and-file about total predomination and arrogance of camisas azules. Possibly as a result of complaints about the Falangists’ lack of <b>give</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> in October 1937 Franco called up theoretically governing structure of the party, the National Council; within its ranks the Carlists were even worse-off, only 11 of them among its 50 members. Despite Fal’s calls to decline, Rodezno accepted the seat and in December 1937 Don Javier expulsed him from Carlism.|$|E

500|$|Thomas Merton {{characterized}} {{the goal of}} Christian meditation as follows: [...] "The true end of Christian meditation is practically {{the same as the}} end of liturgical prayer and the reception of the sacraments: a deeper union by grace and charity with the Incarnate Word, who is the only Mediator between God and man, Jesus Christ." [...] While Protestants view salvation in terms of faith and grace alone (i.e. sola fide and sola gratia) both Western and Eastern Christians see a role for meditation on the path to salvation and redemption. Apostle Paul stated in Epistle to the Romans [...] that salvation only comes from [...] "God that hath mercy". The path to salvation in Christian meditation is not one of <b>give</b> <b>and</b> <b>take,</b> and the aim of meditation is to bring joy to the heart of God. The Word of God directs meditations to show the two aspects of love that please God: obedience and adoration. The initiative in Christian salvation is with God, and one does not meditate or love God to gain his favor.|$|E
500|$|Frank was not {{originally}} envisioned with a beard, however at {{the time}} of his casting, Fahey himself had one. Lindelof and Cuse felt that the beard worked with Lapidus' character, and allowed Fahey to keep it for the role, with the requirement he shave it back to a more manageable length. The character remained bearded until his return in fifth season episode [...] "316", set three years on from his original introduction. Fahey praised the way the character was developed to suit him, explaining that upon meeting with Lindelof and Cuse, rather than discussing the show with him, they were more interested in him personally and his experiences, going on to incorporate elements of himself into Lapidus. He expanded: [...] "The beauty of this is they'll feed you a concept based on an idea of who you are. The actor and the characters are not suits off the rack, they tailor-make them to you. What's very exciting is it is a very positive <b>give</b> <b>and</b> <b>take.</b> It's a nice dance, as it were." [...] Fahey was not given an overarching overview of his character, nor were any of the other new freighter folk, which he found exciting, creating a level of intrigue amongst the cast and crew as well as fans. [...] Prior to arrival on the island, Lapidus was described by Naomi as a drunk. Entertainment Weeklys Kristin Dos Santos deemed Lapidus the most laid back of the four new characters, though Fahey commented that [...] "It might be because he's just rolled around a few more places a little longer than the others", agreeing with Dos Santos' assessment that Lapidus was [...] "a little nomadic". Lindelof and Cuse have said that Frank [...] "never takes anything at face value [...] a true conspiracy nut [...] has probably seen every episode of The X-Files, [...] pay off for him".|$|E
