40|$|Background: The metal Nāga (Lead) {{is being}} used by Indians since ancient times. Its {{external}} and internal uses have been described in Caraka, Suśruta and other Ayurvedic Saṃhitā. According {{to most of the}} Rasa texts, Nāga Bhasma and its formulations are used in many diseases such as Prameha, Jvara, Gulma, Śukrameha etc. Objectives: In the present study, Nāga Bhasma was prepared by the traditional Puṭa method (TPM) and by the <b>electric</b> <b>muffle</b> <b>furnace</b> Puṭa method (EMFPM) and standardized using Metallographic studies. Doing so helps {{in the study of the}} microstructure of Nāga Bhasma and also helps in the identification of the metal particles along with the nature of compound formed during the Māraṇa (Bhasmīkaraṇa) process. Setting and Design: Different samples from initial raw material to final product of Nāga Bhasma were collected during the pharmaceutical process (1 st, 30 th and 60 th Puṭa) from both methods i. e. TPM and EMFPM. Samples from both methods were studied using metallographic examination. Materials and Methods: The processing of the Nāga Bhasma (ṣaṣṭipuṭa) was done according to Ānanda Kanda[9] Samples from the raw material i. e. Aśodhita Nāga (raw Lead) and that processed after 1 st, 30 th and 60 th Puṭa from both methods i. e. traditional Puṭa method (using heat from burning of cow dung cakes) and <b>electric</b> <b>muffle</b> <b>furnace</b> Puṭa method were taken. They were mounted on self hardening acrylic base. After careful polishing to obtain scratch free surface of product, they were used for metallurgical study. Conclusion: This study shows that traditional Puṭa method may be better than <b>electric</b> <b>muffle</b> <b>furnace</b> Puṭa method because of more homogeneous distribution of Lead sulphide in the Nāga Bhasma which is prepared by traditional method...|$|E
5000|$|The {{conversion}} of UF to metal {{was accomplished by}} the thermite reduction of green salt with magnesium in a refractory lined steel reaction vessel. 450 pounds of green salt were blended with approximately 72 pounds of magnesium. The resulting mixture was uniformly packed into the reduction [...] "bomb", which has previously been lined with refractory slag in a jolting apparatus. Following these steps, the bomb was capped with refractory, sealed, and placed in one of 49 <b>electric</b> <b>muffle</b> <b>furnaces.</b> The furnace temperature was raised to approximately 1,225 °F and after about four hours the thermite type reduction reaction occurs: UF4 + 2Mg → 2MgF2 + U (metal). The charge was then allowed to separate and cool in the furnace for 10 minutes, after which it was removed and cooled to room temperature. Finally, the solidified uranium metal (derby) was separated from the slag and liner materials in a sequence of manual and mechanical operations that {{take place at the}} breakout station. The yields expected from this operation were about 95%. There are many documented explosions of these furnaces due to improperly packed refractory lining or a magnesium flare. Whatever the cause, the building would fill with radioactive smoke along with a real probability that molten uranium metal would come pouring out of the bottom of the furnace.|$|R

The apparent relative density allowed the charcoal samples differentiation produced by the same pyrolysis condition.
