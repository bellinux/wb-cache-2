500|$|Describing {{the various}} songs on Bleach, Christopher Sandford wrote: [...] "'Paper Cuts' {{includes}} a folk-influence melody and ponderous rhythm {{of an early}} Led Zeppelin number; 'Mr. Moustache' addressed itself to Nirvana's male fans; 'Downer' showed the same exceptional contempt for the group's audience". Sandford felt [...] "School" [...] – which features only four lines of lyrics – was memorable for its chorus that [...] "served as the rip". While [...] "Scoff" [...] is [...] "a parting salvo at [...] ", [...] "Negative Creep" [...] was written by Cobain about himself. According to Sandford, [...] "About a Girl" [...] has a [...] "chiming melody and ironic chorus". In Sounds magazine, Keith Cameron said the song [...] "was exhilarating and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>exciting</b> {{because that was the}} nature of the music, but there was also an almost palpable sense of danger, that this whole thing could fall apart any second. There was never any relaxation from the first note to the last".

Dodge simply stated, [...] "We all knew that New Directions would win and they'd get their happily ever after, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>exciting</b> to see it finally all play out." [...] Bell wrote that [...] "seeing the judges debate behind-the-scenes kind of takes away the entire title", though she appreciated Lohan's Freaky Friday reference. VanDerWerff said that the judging scene [...] "wasn't very good", and Votta described it as [...] "mostly waste".

2500|$|Shah Rukh Khan as Don, a drug {{lord and}} {{the narrator of}} the film. He has {{established}} his dominion over Asia, and sets his sights on organised crime in Europe. Khan reprised {{his role in the}} 2006 film, Don. In this film, unlike the first, he plays only one part. Khan exercised extensively for the role and performed almost all the stunts by himself.

Roma, Now an INTERPOL operative, Roma continues chasing Don to avenge the deaths of her brother Ramesh and his fiancée Kamini at his hands.

In Don2, he works with Don on the robbery but secretly seeks revenge.
