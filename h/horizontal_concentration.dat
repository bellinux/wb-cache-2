40|$|In Chapter 1, I {{conduct a}} {{theoretical}} {{study of how}} <b>horizontal</b> industry <b>concentration</b> affects a firm’s market capitalization and systematic risk. I first develop a method for incorporating an equilibrium theory of the firm, drawn from industrial organization, into a single period version of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). This extension establishes the microeconomic determinants of systematic risk by relating firm specific variables to Beta. Unlike the previous literature, I add local product market shocks to a general, deterministic profit function and use an orthogonal decomposition of the market return to endogenize the Cov[Ri,RM]. I also use this method with standard Hotelling and Cournot models of firm behavior and with different sources of uncertainty to provide examples of how increasing concentration can increase, decrease, and be independent of Beta. In Chapter 2, I exploit a natural experiment afforded by the announcement of ‘Paragraph IV’ patent infringement decisions. These judgments have two unique features. They create an exogenous change in industry concentration, since they determine whether the corporate owner of a brand name prescription drug will maintain or lose monopoly marketing rights. They also satisfy the methodological requirements to use a short window event study.

University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2014 Black carbon (BC) {{aerosols}} {{impact the}} earth's climate by absorbing solar radiation {{in the atmosphere}} and depositing on ice surfaces and lowering the albedo of those surfaces. Black carbon aerosols have been widely studied; however, using small unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) for the airborne study of the vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>concentrations</b> of BC is an emerging field. Using UAS to study BC poses some challenges due to size and weight restrictions of the aircraft, as well as issues that arise when adapting ground based instrumentation for use on different aircraft. University of Alaska Fairbanks researchers successfully integrated and flew a microAeth AE- 51 on a Boeing ScanEagle to measure the concentration of BC and other absorbing and scattering particles in the smoke plume from a prescribed fire experiment, RxCADRE, conducted at Eglin AFB, FL, during October and November 2012.

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} determinants of asymmetric price transmission (APT) in European petroleum markets. APT is the faster response of retail prices to cost increases than to cost decreases; resulting in a welfare transfer from consumers to fuel retailers. I investigate APT at 3 different levels: the EU, the UK and at the Birmingham level. First, I examine the incidence of asymmetries in the retail markets of six major EU countries; significant asymmetries are found in all countries except from the UK. The market share data suggest that asymmetries are more important in more concentrated markets; this finding supports the collusion theory. I extend the investigation to 12 EU countries and note that APT is greater in diesel markets. The cross-country analysis suggests that vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>concentration</b> at least partly explains the degree of asymmetry. I provide evidence justifying scrutiny over retail markets’ pricing and structure. Second daily data unveil the presence of APT in the UK fuel markets. I use break tests to identify segments with different pricing regimes. Two main types of periods are identified: periods of rising oil price exhibit significant asymmetries whilst periods of recession do not. Our results suggest that oligopolistic coordination between retailers generate excess rents during periods of rising oil price whilst the coordination fails due to price wars when oil prices are going downwards. Finally I investigate the pricing behaviour of petroleum retailers in the Birmingham (UK) area for 2008. Whilst the market structure data reveals that the <b>horizontal</b> <b>concentration</b> {{is higher than the}} national UK average, I find no evidence of APT. In contrast, I find that retail prices are sticky upwards and downwards and that firms with market power (majors and supermarkets) adjust their prices slower than other firms...|$|E

40|$|The advance-and-relieve method {{benefits}} from lateral destressing associated with mining in laminated rocks {{and a high}} horizontal stress regime. This stress control method is based on measurements showing that occurrence of rock failure in the roof and floor of an entry (or caving of roof strata in a panel gob) results in redistribution of stresses in adjacent entries. By locating other entries within the shadow zone of the first entry (or gob), improvements in stability can be achieved. Numerical modeling proved useful in studying the basic mechanics of lateral relief while investigating the sensitivity of results to different geologic and mining parameters using controlled experiments. It was shown that failure of rocks near an entry results in redistribution of horizontal stress and shifting of the stress to higher horizons. Measurements from two mines are consistent in showing significant horizontal stress reductions {{in comparison with the}} far-field stress regime within the destressed zone. Although the far-field stress regime is very anisotropic, these measurements show near-equal secondary principal horizontal stresses, or perhaps a switch in orientation, as a result of destressing. Stress relief is achieved through lateral movement and relaxation of rocks along weak bedding planes toward adjacent caved zones (or softened zone). Because of cave geometry in the advancing panel, <b>horizontal</b> stress <b>concentrations</b> occur near the cave line both in front of the face and to the sides. The <b>horizontal</b> stress <b>concentration</b> reaches 1. 7 times the far-field stress ahead of the face. This stress increase is significant and may cause structural damage in this zone benefiting from additional support. In the next advancing panel located within the shadow zone of the gob, horizontal stresses are significantly reduced in the roof (by 50 %). Thus, the stability of future advancing panel can be improved through prudent layout designs and sequencing. The width of the relief zone is significantly influenced by the height of the softened (or cave zone) and rock mass properties...|$|R
