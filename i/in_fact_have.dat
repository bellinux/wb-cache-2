5|$|The two Morrison Formation sauropod genera Diplodocus and Barosaurus {{had very}} similar limb bones. In the past, many {{isolated}} limb bones were automatically attributed to Diplodocus, but may, <b>in</b> <b>fact,</b> <b>have</b> belonged to Barosaurus.

5|$|Hsu may <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> <b>have</b> {{been running}} {{multiple}} cons {{on a massive}} scale. As an example, a New York investment fund run by Woodstock Festival founder Joel Rosenman invested $40 million spread over 37 separate deals with a Hsu company. Hsu reportedly told Rosenman {{the money would be}} used to manufacture apparel for well known luxury brands, yielding a 40% profit on each deal. When Rosenman's fund recently attempted to cash checks from Hsu's company in September 2007, there were insufficient funds. Federal charges of fraud have since been brought against Hsu.|$|E

5|$|The oryzomyines of the Caribbean were revised in 1962 by Clayton Ray, who {{examined}} the specimens Gregory had found and redescribed them. He suggested that M.audreyae may <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> <b>have</b> come from Barbados instead of similarly named Barbuda, citing {{the occurrence of}} a different oryzomyine ("Ekbletomys hypenemus") in other cave deposits on Barbuda, circumstantial evidence for the occurrence of a native rodent on Barbados, uncertainty whether Gregory ever visited Barbuda, and biogeographical considerations.|$|E

A {{number of streams}} in the upper Nescopeck Creek watershed, <b>in</b> <b>fact,</b> <b>have</b> more than 80 percent forest coverage. Only 55 percent of the Black Creek watershed is covered by forest. Most sub-watersheds of Nescopeck Creek have {{only a small amount}} of barren land. However, the Cranberry Creek watershed contains 6.5 percent barren land, the Black Creek watershed contains 14 percent, and the Stony Creek watershed contains 30 percent. The Little Nescopeck Creek watershed contains 30 percent farmland and the Nescopeck Creek watershed contains 24 percent. Other sub-watersheds of Nescopeck Creek range from 2 to 13 percent farmland.|$|E

5|$|During {{the late}} Jurassic, Europe was a dry, {{tropical}} archipelago {{at the edge}} of the Tethys Sea. The fine limestone in which the skeletons of Compsognathus have been found originated in calcite from the shells of marine organisms. Both the German and French areas where Compsognathus specimens have been preserved were lagoons situated between the beaches and coral reefs of the Jurassic European islands in the Tethys Sea. Contemporaries of Compsognathus longipes include the early avialan Archaeopteryx lithographica and the pterosaurs Rhamphorhynchus muensteri and Pterodactylus antiquus. The same sediments in which Compsognathus have been preserved also contain fossils of a number of marine animals such as fish, crustaceans, echinoderms and marine mollusks, confirming the coastal habitat of this theropod. No other dinosaur has been found in association with Compsognathus, indicating that these little dinosaurs might <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> <b>have</b> been the top land predator in these islands.|$|E
5|$|Galveston Bay {{is mostly}} shallow {{with an average}} depth of 7–9feet. It is fed by the Trinity River and the San Jacinto River, {{numerous}} local bayous and incoming tides from the Gulf of Mexico. This unique and complex mixing of waters from different sources supports many types of marine life including crabs, shrimp, oysters, and many varieties of fish thereby supporting a substantial fishing industry. Additionally the system of bayous, rivers, and marshes that ring the Bay support their own ecosystems allowing for diverse wildlife and enabling freshwater farming of crawfish. The areas near the bay shore <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> <b>have</b> a higher diversity of habitats than the nearby Gulf coast.|$|E
5|$|Head also {{demonstrated}} that the teeth of Eolambia were broader and more asymmetrical than Kirkland had assumed; {{he also noted that}} subadults only possessed two teeth per tooth position, unlike hadrosaurids, although adult specimens <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> <b>have</b> the three or more tooth positions as originally demonstrated by Kirkland. Head further showed that Eolambia possessed seven sacral vertebrae, unlike eight or more in derived hadrosaurids, and that its antitrochanter was actually more poorly developed than those of Ouranosaurus and Altirhinus. Examination of the OMNH specimens further demonstrated that that the postacetabular region of the ilium did not form a distinct process, and the articulations {{at the bottom of the}} femur are not very prominent, both of which separate Eolambia from more derived iguanodonts such as hadrosaurids. Thus, Head concluded that Eolambia was a basal member of the Hadrosauroidea, outside of the Hadrosauridae, a conclusion supported by a phylogenetic analysis finding it to be a non-hadrosaurid hadrosauroid closely related to Probactrosaurus.|$|E

5|$|Kosara then {{begged her}} father for Vladimir's hand, and the tsar granted her request. He {{restored}} his new son-in-law {{to the throne}} of Duklja. In reality, the marriage was probably a result of Samuel's political assessment: he may have decided that Vladimir {{would be a more}} loyal vassal if he was married to his daughter. Resolving thus the question of Duklja, Samuel could concentrate more troops in Macedonia and Thessaly, the main site of his conflict with Byzantium. The chronicle claims that the tsar also gave Vladimir the whole territory of Dyrrachium. The prince could <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> <b>have</b> been given a northern part of that territory, which was partially under Samuel's rule. A brief note on Vladimir by John Skylitzes may indicate that the prince also received some territory in Raška. His paternal uncle Dragimir, ruler of Travunia and Zachlumia, who had retreated before Samuel's army, was given back his lands to rule, also as the tsar's vassal.|$|E
5|$|One of {{his major}} prophetic sources was evidently the Mirabilis Liber of 1522, which {{contained}} a range of prophecies by Pseudo-Methodius, the Tiburtine Sibyl, Joachim of Fiore, Savonarola and others (his Preface contains 24 biblical quotations, all but two in the order used by Savonarola). This book had enjoyed considerable success in the 1520s, when it went through half a dozen editions, but did not sustain its influence, perhaps owing to its mostly Latin text, Gothic script and many difficult abbreviations. Nostradamus {{was one of the}} first to re-paraphrase these prophecies in French, which may explain why they are credited to him. It should be noted that modern views of plagiarism did not apply in the 16th century; authors frequently copied and paraphrased passages without acknowledgement, especially from the classics. The latest research suggests that he may <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> <b>have</b> used bibliomancy for this—randomly selecting a book of history or prophecy and taking his cue from whatever page it happened to fall open at.|$|E
5|$|Several {{popularity}} polls {{conducted over}} the past decade indicate that Freddie Mercury's reputation may, <b>in</b> <b>fact,</b> <b>have</b> been enhanced since his death. For instance, in a 2002 vote to determine who the UK public considers the greatest British people in history, Mercury was ranked 58 in the list of the 100 Greatest Britons, broadcast by the BBC. He was further listed at the 52nd spot in a 2007 Japanese national survey of the 100 most influential heroes. Despite {{the fact that he had}} been criticised by gay activists for hiding his HIV status, author Paul Russell included Mercury in his book The Gay 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Gay Men and Lesbians, Past and Present. In 2008 Rolling Stone ranked Mercury 18 on its list of the Top 100 Singers Of All Time. Mercury was voted the greatest male singer in MTV's 22 Greatest Voices in Music. In 2011 a Rolling Stone readers' pick placed Mercury in second place of the magazine's Best Lead Singers of All Time.|$|E

5|$|There are {{two studies}} on the {{incidence}} of RAD relating to high risk and maltreated children in the U.S. Both used ICD, DSM and the DAI. The first, in 2004, reported that children from the maltreatment sample {{were significantly more likely}} to meet criteria for one or more attachment disorders than children from the other groups, however this was mainly the proposed new classification of disrupted attachment disorder rather than the DSM or ICD classified RAD or DAD. The second study, also in 2004, attempted to ascertain the prevalence of RAD and whether it could be reliably identified in maltreated rather than neglected toddlers. Of the 94 maltreated toddlers in foster care, 35% were identified as having ICD RAD and 22% as having ICD DAD, and 38% fulfilled the DSM criteria for RAD. This study found that RAD could be reliably identified and also that the inhibited and disinhibited forms were not independent. However, there are some methodological concerns with this study. A number of the children identified as fulfilling the criteria for RAD did <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> <b>have</b> a preferred attachment figure.|$|E
5|$|More recent {{analyses}} {{using different}} sets of anatomical data have since cast doubt on a dromaeosaurid classification for Balaur. In 2013, a larger analysis containing {{a wide variety of}} coelurosaurs found that Balaur was not a dromaeosaurid at all, but a basal avialan, more closely related to modern birds than to Jeholornithiformes but more basal than Omnivoropterygiformes. A study published in 2014 found Balaur to be sister to Pygostylia. An independent analysis using an expanded version of the original data set (the one that found Balaur to be a dromaeosaurid) drew a similar conclusion in 2014. In 2015, researchers Andrea Cau, Tom Brougham, and Darren Naish published a study which specifically attempted to clarify which theropods were close relatives of Balaur. While their analysis could not completely {{rule out the possibility that}} B. bondoc was a dromaeosaurid, they concluded that this result was less likely than the classification of Balaur as a non-pygostylian avialan based on several important bird-like features. Many of the presumed unique traits would <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> <b>have</b> been normal for a member of the Avialae. Typical bird features included the degree of fusion of the limb bones, the functional first toe, the first toe claw not being smaller than the second claw, a long penultimate phalanx of the third toe, a small fourth toe claw and a long fifth metatarsal.|$|E
