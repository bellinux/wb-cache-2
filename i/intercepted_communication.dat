40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the {{contribution}} of the localization data, network-management data, and content-of-communication data in the case processing performance in Macedonia. The mobile network forensics evidence was analyzed respective to the impact of the mobile network data variety, the mobile network data volume, and the forensic processing on the case disposition time. The results from this study indicate that the case disposition time is negatively correlated with the network-management data volume and positively correlated with the content-of-communication data volume. The relevance of the network-management data was recognized in the highly granular service behavior profile developed using larger number of records, while the relevance of the content-of-communication data was recognized in the substantial number of excerpts of <b>intercepted</b> <b>communication.</b> The results also reveal a difference in the case processing time for the cases where there is only localization or network-management data versus when they are combined with the content-of-communication data. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{distributional}} model of word use and word meaning which is derived purely from {{a body of}} text, and then applies this model to determine whether certain words are used {{in or out of}} context. We suggest that we can view the contexts of words as multinomially distributed random variables. We illustrate how using this basic idea, we can formulate the problem of detecting whether or not a word is used in context as a likelihood ratio test. We also define a measure of semantic relatedness between a word and its context using the same model. We assume that words that typically appear together are related, and thus have similar probability distributions and that words used in an unusual way will have probability distributions which are dissimilar from those of their surrounding context. The relatedness of a word to its context is based on Kullback-Leibler divergence between probability distributions assigned to the constituent words in the given sentence.
