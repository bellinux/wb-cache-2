5000|$|<b>Entrée</b> (named in {{reference}} to the main course of a meal) is Peri's best friend. <b>Entrèe</b> was created as the perfect food animal, with a cow's udders, a pig body, a chicken's wings and comb, and a shrimp tail. Since he has no legs. <b>Entrée</b> [...] "walks" [...] on his teats, named Nugget, Pokey, Cranky, Commodore Uddersworth, Tina, A.J., Nippocles, and an unnamed eighth which <b>Entrèe</b> darkly claims speaking its name [...] "will give it power." [...] <b>Entree's</b> teats are capable of time travel and light show effects. Fittingly, his home is a giant pizza oven and his bed is a barbecue grill. <b>Entrèe</b> is evil, in the sense of always seeking instant self-gratification, no matter the cost. Much of the time <b>Entree's</b> selfishness ends up causing more destruction than Mr. Smarty Smarts' intentional evil. <b>Entree</b> is a glutton, loving to gorge on anything, even things that aren't normally edible, but especially mayonnaise. <b>Entrée</b> is voiced by Joe Pingue.|$|R
40|$|Background: Strategies {{need to be}} {{developed}} to reduce preschool children’s energy intake. Objective: To test the effect of reducing the energy density of an <b>entrée</b> on children’s ad libitum energy intake. Subjects: Subjects were 2 - to 5 -year-old children (37 boys and 40 girls) in a university day-care facility. Intervention: In this within-subjects crossover study, children were served a test lunch once per week for 6 weeks. Two versions of a macaroni and cheese <b>entrée</b> were formulated to differ in energy density while maintaining similar palatability. Each version was served to children three times. The higher-energy-density <b>entrée</b> had 2. 0 kcal/g and the other <b>entrée</b> was 30 % lower in energy density. Lunch, consumed ad libitum, also included broccoli, applesauce, and milk. Main outcome measures: Food intake and energy intake were measured. Statistical analyses: A mixed linear model tested effect of energy density of the <b>entrée</b> on food intake and energy intake. Results are reported as mean±standard error. Results: Decreasing the energy density of the <b>entrée</b> by 30 % significantly (P< 0. 0001) reduced children’s energy intake from the <b>entrée</b> by 25 % (72. 3 ± 8. 3 kcal) and total lunch energy intake by 18 % (71. 8 ± 7. 9 kcal). Children consumed significantly more of the lower-energy-density <b>entrée</b> (10. 1 ± 4. 2 g; P< 0. 05). Children’s sex-specific body mass index–for-age percentiles did not affect the relationship between energy density of the <b>entrée</b> and children’s intakes. Conclusions: Decreasing the energy density of a lunch <b>entrée</b> resulted in a reduction in children’s energy intake from the <b>entrée</b> and from the total meal. Reducing the energy density of foods may be an effective strategy to moderate children’s energy intake. <br /...|$|R

5|$|The main food staples in {{the diet}} of the lower classes {{remained}} rice, pork, and salted fish. Song restaurant and tavern menus are recorded which list <b>entrées</b> for feasts, banquets, festivals, and carnivals. They reveal a diverse and lavish diet for those of the upper class. They could choose {{from a wide variety}} of meats and seafood, including shrimp, geese, duck, mussel, shellfish, fallow deer, hare, partridge, pheasant, francolin, quail, fox, badger, clam, crab, and many others. Dairy products were rare in Chinese cuisine at this time. Beef was rarely consumed since the bull was a valuable draft animal, and dog meat was absent from the diet of the wealthy, although the poor could choose to eat dog meat if necessary (yet it was not part of their regular diet). People also consumed dates, raisins, jujubes, pears, plums, apricots, pear juice, lychee-fruit juice, honey and ginger drinks, pawpaw juice, spices and seasonings of Sichuan pepper, ginger, soy sauce, oil, sesame oil, salt, and vinegar.|$|E

25|$|The MRE {{has been}} in continual {{development}} since its introduction. In 1990, a Flameless Ration Heater (FRH), a water-activated exothermic reaction product that emits heat, allowed a service member {{in the field to}} enjoy a hot meal. In an array of field tests and surveys, service members requested more entrée options and larger serving sizes. By 1994, commercial-like graphics (images) were added to make the packets more user-friendly and appealing, while biodegradable materials were introduced for inedible components, such as spoons and napkins. The number of <b>entrées</b> expanded to 16 by 1996 (including vegetarian options), 20 <b>entrées</b> by 1997 and 24 <b>entrées</b> by 1998. Today, service members can choose from up to 24 <b>entrées,</b> and more than 150 additional items. The variety allowed service members from various cultures and geographical regions to find something palatable.|$|E
