5|$|Quarry House was {{constructed}} {{on the site}} of the former Quarry Hill Flats (see 1920s and 1930s) at Quarry Hill. The building houses the Department of Health and the Department for Work and Pensions and is their main regional offices. The building is controversial. Its imposing design has often been regarded as being domineering and self-important and <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>the</b> building to be nicknamed The Kremlin and The Ministry of Truth.|$|E

In the 2004 general election, the NDA suffered an unexpected defeat, and for the next ten years the BJP was the principal opposition party. Long time Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi led it to a landslide victory in the 2014 general election.

5|$|As in an oratorio, {{the written}} text in a choral symphony {{can be as}} {{important}} as the music, and the chorus and soloists can participate equally with the instruments in the exposition and development of musical ideas. The text can also help determine whether the composer follows symphonic form strictly, {{as in the case of}} Rachmaninoff, Britten and Shostakovich, or whether they expand symphonic form, as in the case of Berlioz, Mahler and Havergal Brian. Sometimes the choice of text <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>the</b> composer to different symphonic structures, as with Szymanowski, Schnittke and, again, Havergal Brian. The composer can also choose to treat the text fluidly, in a manner more like music than narrative. Such was the case with Vaughan Williams, Mahler and Philip Glass.|$|E
5|$|Barton {{has been}} {{described}} as having a good work ethic and the ability to carry the ball and retain possession for the team. He has been praised for having a good passing range. This aspect of his game has shown improvement since the 2005–06 season, when he began to favour simpler passes over more ambitious ones, and his relatively high pass completion rate can be attributed to this change. Barton's passes have often proved to be crucial; in the past he <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>the</b> way in his team's assists.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 2003, Craig Venter, {{leader of}} the privately funded {{parallel}} of the Human Genome Project, <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>the</b> Global Ocean Sampling Expedition (GOS), circumnavigating the globe and collecting metagenomic samples throughout the journey. All of these samples are sequenced using shotgun sequencing, in hopes that new genomes (and therefore new organisms) would be identified. The pilot project, conducted in the Sargasso Sea, found DNA from nearly 2000 different species, including 148 types of bacteria never before seen. Venter has circumnavigated the globe and thoroughly explored the West Coast of the United States, and completed a two-year expedition to explore the Baltic, Mediterranean and Black Seas. Analysis of the metagenomic data collected during this journey revealed two groups of organisms, one composed of taxa adapted to environmental conditions of 'feast or famine', and a second composed of relatively fewer but more abundantly and widely distributed taxa primarily composed of plankton.|$|E
5|$|Bieksa {{was known}} as a two-way defenceman with the Canucks, capable of playing in all situations. Throughout his NHL career, he has been placed on {{shutdown}} pairing with such defensive partners as Willie Mitchell and Dan Hamhuis. Offensively, he regularly jumps into the rush and <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>the</b> Canucks in defensive scoring in 2006–07 and 2008–09. His play is characterized by aggressive and competitive components. He also earned a reputation as a fighter early in his career in the AHL. However, Bieksa's scoring dropped off in his first season with the Ducks.He has been praised throughout his career for his leadership qualities.|$|E
5|$|Don Hutson led {{the league}} in {{receiving}} yards seven times, the most of any player; Jerry Rice is second with six. Hutson also recorded the most consecutive seasons leading the league in receiving, doing so for five seasons from 1941 to 1945, while Jerry Rice ranks second with three consecutive league-leading seasons from 1993 to 1995. A Green Bay Packers player <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>the</b> league in receiving yards eleven times, the most in the NFL; the Los Angeles/St. Louis Rams rank second with nine league-leading seasons.

5|$|In the 1970s, the {{predominantly}} mining and agricultural-based economy began a transition towards a more multi-sector economy. Since the 1980s, the industrial sector, {{with a high}} level of investment, <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>the</b> country's growth. The economy recovered from the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis earlier than neighbouring countries did, and has since recovered to the levels of the pre-crisis era with a GDP per capita of $14,800. Economic inequalities exist between different ethnic groups. The Chinese make up about one-quarter of the population, but accounts for 70 per cent of the country's market capitalisation. Chinese businesses in Malaysia are part of the larger bamboo network, a network of overseas Chinese businesses in the Southeast Asian market sharing common family and cultural ties.|$|E

The Miami Marlins, Seattle Mariners, San Diego Padres, Los Angeles Dodgers, and Washington Nationals all began the 2016 season with new managers: respectively, Don Mattingly, Scott Servais, Andy Green, Dave Roberts, and Dusty Baker. Additionally, the Philadelphia Phillies and Milwaukee Brewers will retain managers who had been midseason replacement managers during the 2015 season: Pete Mackanin and Craig Counsell.|$|E
5|$|Most {{laboratory}} {{techniques for}} growing bacteria use {{high levels of}} nutrients to produce large amounts of cells cheaply and quickly. However, in natural environments, nutrients are limited, meaning that bacteria cannot continue to reproduce indefinitely. This nutrient limitation <b>has</b> <b>led</b> <b>the</b> evolution of different growth strategies (see r/K selection theory). Some organisms can grow extremely rapidly when nutrients become available, such as the formation of algal (and cyanobacterial) blooms that often occur in lakes during the summer. Other organisms have adaptations to harsh environments, such as the production of multiple antibiotics by Streptomyces that inhibit the growth of competing microorganisms. In nature, many organisms live in communities (e.g., biofilms) that may allow for increased supply of nutrients and protection from environmental stresses. These relationships can be essential for growth of a particular organism or group of organisms (syntrophy).|$|E
