It's a waste of time on my part because it drains me from doing what I really want to do, which is just to play music." [...] Van Morrison describes his perceived musical role: [...] "I just feel I'm doing the job. My job is to play music and deliver the show ... It's more emotional for the audience ... what they sort of think you are." [...] He states that one of his motivations is [...] "ideally to induce states of meditation and ecstasy, as well as to make people think".|$|E

[...] A crucially significant event for her was when an outhouse exploded after she poured too much lime into the latrine. [...] "That symbolized everything I would <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> and work. Excess and extravagance and explosiveness. [...] I would be someone who would look into the latrine of culture, into pornography and crime and psychopathology... and I would drop the bomb into it".|$|E

At her father's deathbed, Gimbutas pledged that she would study to become a scholar: [...] "All of a sudden I had to think what I shall be, what I shall <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> I had been so reckless in sports—swimming for miles, skating, bicycle riding.

Cao Pi was so furious that he drew his sword and wanted to execute his servants. Su Ze knelt down and pleaded with him to spare the servants, saying, [...] "Your Majesty, I heard that the sage-rulers of ancient times would not harm people {{for the sake of}} animals. Now, Your Majesty wishes to promote the culture of Yao's time, yet Your Majesty wants to execute so many people just because a hunting excursion went wrong.

6000|$|All the while, I {{was growing}} worse and worse. Once I had fallen, my leg simply {{doubling}} under me, and this had struck Alan for the moment; but I was afoot so briskly, {{and set off}} again with such a natural manner, that he soon forgot the incident. Flushes of heat went over me, and then spasms of shuddering. The stitch in my side was hardly bearable. At last I began to feel that I could trail myself no farther: and with that, there came on me all at once the wish to have it out <b>with</b> Alan, let <b>my</b> anger blaze, and be <b>done</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> in a more sudden manner.

[...] The experiment failed, however, because MacLeod found {{that by the end of}} each day, he was too worn out from his academic work to produce stories that were any good. So, he did most of his writing during the summer breaks when his family lived on the MacLeod homestead at Dunvegan, Cape Breton.

60|$|What was I to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> now? What was {{to become}} of my life? I can still recall the sense of blank unanswerableness with which these {{questions}} dominated my mind, and associated with it is an effect {{of myself as a}} small human being, singular and apart, wandering through a number of London landscapes. At one time I was in a great grey smoke-rimmed autumnal space of park, much cut up by railings and worn by cricket pitches, far away from any idea of the Thames, and in the distance over the tops of trees I discovered perplexingly the clustering masts and spars of ships. I have never seen that place since. Then the Angel at Islington is absurdly mixed up with the distresses of this day. I attempted some great detour thence, and found myself with a dumb irritation returning to the place from another direction. I remember too a wide street over which passes a thundering railway bridge borne upon colossal rounded pillars of iron, and carrying in white and blue some big advertisement, I think of the Daily Telegraph. Near there I thought a crowd was gathered about the victim of some accident, and thrusting myself among the people with a vague idea of help, discovered a man selling a remedy for corns. And somewhere about this north region I discovered I was faint with hunger, and got some bread and cheese and beer in a gaudily decorated saloon bar with a sanded floor. I resisted a monstrous impulse to stay in that place and drink myself into inactivity and stupefaction with beer.|$|E

It also defines the record in a grander way by asking the listener {{to look into the}} meaning of each song past the obvious." [...] She also explained that the cover art is [...] "a very direct representation of how I feel at the moment. I wanted it to be artistic and emote how I'm feeling at this junction in <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> An artist came to me with this image, and it was just perfect! The artist is a close friend who wants to remain anonymous, but they had heard the record and worked based off of the music to create that image." ...|$|R

Here I am exposed to many different theological outlooks and denominational worldviews that could have otherwise gone unnoticed in a different setting.
