5|$|A genetic {{study in}} 2012 found clear {{differences}} between various {{populations of the}} Cuvier's dwarf caiman (Pantanal; Madeira River basin; Rio Negro basin) and these are apparently isolated from each others, leading to the suggestion that <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> cryptic species complex.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Philippe Delorme, of the Institute of Planetology and Astrophysics of Grenoble in France {{announced}} {{the discovery of}} CFBDSIR 2149-0403; an independently moving 4-7 Jupiter-mass object that likely forms part of the AB Doradus moving group, less than 100 light years from Earth. Although it shares its spectrum with a spectral class T brown dwarf, Delorme speculates that <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> planet.|$|E

5|$|In April 2007, this {{experiment}} was repeated and a further three atoms of copernicium-283 were positively identified. The adsorption property was confirmed {{and indicated that}} copernicium has adsorption properties completely in agreement with being the heaviest member of group 12. These experiments also allowed the first experimental estimation of copernicium's boiling point: 84°C, so that <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> gas at standard conditions.|$|E
5|$|The dive {{profile is}} often {{recorded}} {{in some way}} {{as part of a}} permanent record of the dive. Maximum depth, bottom time and any decompression required are routinely logged by most professional divers, for whom <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> legal requirement, and by many recreational divers, for whom it is usually a recommendation of the training agencies.|$|E
5|$|The {{low mass}} of the planet has led to {{suggestions}} that <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> terrestrial planet. This type of massive terrestrial planet could be formed in the inner part of the Gliese 876 system from material pushed towards the star by the inward migration of the gas giants.|$|E

5|$|Wilfrid's {{association}} with Cædwalla may have benefited him in other ways: the Life of Wilfrid {{asserts that the}} Archbishop of Canterbury, Theodore, expressed a wish that Wilfrid succeed him in that role, {{and if this is}} true <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> reflection of Wilfrid's {{association with}} Cædwalla's southern overlordship.|$|E
5|$|A related {{study also}} noted a locking {{mechanism}} {{in the lower}} jaw shared between the two genera. In a separate paper, Currie noted the possibility that Alioramus might represent a juvenile Tarbosaurus, but stated that the much higher tooth count and more prominent nasal crests in Alioramus suggest it is a distinct genus. Similarly, Currie uses the high tooth count of Nanotyrannus to suggest that <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> distinct genus, rather than a juvenile Tyrannosaurus as most other experts believe. However, the discovery and description of Qianzhousaurus reveals that Alioramus is not a close relation to Tarbosaurus, instead belonging to a newly described family of tyrannosaurids; the Alioramini. Qianzhousaurus further reveals that similar long-snouted tyrannosaurids were widely distributed throughout Asia and would have shared the same environment while avoiding competition with larger and more robust tyrannosaurines by hunting different prey.|$|E
5|$|Both the mycelia and {{the fruit}} bodies of M.haematopus (both young and mature specimens) are {{reported}} to be bioluminescent. However, the luminescence is quite weak, and not visible to the dark-adapted eye; in one study, light emission was detectable only after 20hours of exposure to X-ray film. Although the biochemical basis of bioluminescence in M.haematopus has not been scientifically investigated, in general, bioluminescence {{is caused by the}} action of luciferases, enzymes that produce light by the oxidation of a luciferin (a pigment). The biological purpose of bioluminescence in fungi is not definitively known, although several hypotheses have been suggested: it may help attract insects to help with spore dispersal, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> by-product of other biochemical functions, or it may help deter heterotrophs that might consume the fungus.|$|E
50|$|As 'Iris furcata' has <b>a</b> diploid count, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> ancestral form of 'Iris aphylla', (which is tetraploid). Rodionenko {{considered}} 'Iris furcata' {{is distinct}} from 'Iris aphylla'.|$|R

5|$|Crude glyphs {{have been}} found on a few stone objects and some {{additional}} wooden items, {{but most of these}} are thought to be fakes created for the early tourism market. Several of the 26 wooden texts are suspect due to uncertain provenance (X, Y, and Z), poor quality craftsmanship (F, K, V, W, Y, and Z), or to having been carved with a steel blade (K, V, and Y), and thus, although they may prove to be genuine, should not be trusted in initial attempts at decipherment. Z resembles many early forgeries in not being boustrophedon, but <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> palimpsest on an authentic but now illegible text.|$|E
5|$|Relationships between B.cuneata and {{the other}} members of B.subg. Isostylis still remain unclear. Though Mast's studies found B.cuneata to be the most basal of the three species, a 2004 study of genetic {{divergence}} within the subgenus yielded both other possibilities: some analyses suggested B.ilicifolia as basal, while others suggested B.oligantha. Further complicating the situation is the southernmost population of B.cuneata, which has both genetic and phenetic affinities with B.oligantha located to the southeast. The origin of this population is unknown. It might have arisen through hybridisation, or <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> transitional or even ancestral form. Finally, biogeographical factors suggest that B.ilicifolia would be the most basal of the three species: it occurs in the High Rainfall Zone where relictual species are most common, whereas the others are restricted to the Transitional Rainfall Zone, where more recently evolved species are most common.|$|E
5|$|Scotland's {{populations of}} Alpine Woodsia and Oblong Woodsia {{are on the}} edge of their natural ranges. The UK {{distribution}} of the former is confined to Angus, Perthshire, Argyll and north Wales, and of the latter to Angus, the Moffat Hills, north Wales and two locations in England. The plants were first identified as separate species by John Bolton in 1785 and came under severe threat from Victorian fern collectors in the mid 19th century. Cystopteris dickieana, first discovered in a sea cave in Kincardineshire, is a rare fern in a UK context whose distribution is confined to Scotland, although recent research suggests that <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> variant of C. fragilis rather than a species in its own right.|$|E
50|$|Crocodylus palaeindicus <b>is</b> <b>an</b> {{extinct species}} of {{crocodile}} from southern Asia. C. palaeindicus lived from the Miocene to the Pleistocene. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> ancestor {{of the living}} Mugger crocodile.|$|R
50|$|Autohaemorrhaging or reflex {{bleeding}} is {{the action}} of animals deliberately ejecting haemolymph or blood from their bodies. If the animal has toxic compounds in its blood, then <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> effective chemical defence mechanism.|$|R
25|$|According to Carlos Gonçalves, the batuque <b>is</b> not <b>a</b> musical {{genre that}} {{originated}} in the African continent. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> adaptation of some African dance that later has developed its own characteristics in Cape Verde.|$|R
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet may be {{a successful}} treatment for several rare metabolic diseases. Case reports of two children indicate that <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> possible treatment for astrocytomas, a type of brain tumour. Autism, depression, migraine headaches, polycystic ovary syndrome and diabetes mellitus type 2 have {{also been shown to}} improve in small case studies. There is evidence from uncontrolled clinical trials and studies in animal models that the ketogenic diet can provide symptomatic and disease-modifying activity in a broad range of neurodegenerative disorders including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, and may be protective in traumatic brain injury and stroke.|$|E
5|$|The mycelia (but not {{the fruit}} bodies) of Armillaria gallica {{are known to}} be bioluminescent. Experiments have shown that the {{intensity}} of the luminescence is enhanced when the mycelia are disturbed during growth or when they are exposed to fluorescent light. Bioluminescence is caused by the action of luciferases, enzymes that produce light by the oxidation of a luciferin (a pigment). The biological purpose of bioluminescence in fungi is not definitively known, although several hypotheses have been suggested: it may help attract insects to help with spore dispersal, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> by-product of other biochemical functions, or it may help deter heterotrophs that might consume the fungus.|$|E
5|$|The {{still largely}} unexplained tectonic {{causes of the}} {{volcanism}} that has produced the Silverthrone Caldera are a matter of ongoing research. Silverthrone is not above a hotspot as are Nazko or Hawaii. However, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> product of the Cascadia subduction zone because andesite, basaltic andesite, dacite and rhyolite {{can be found at}} the volcano and elsewhere along the subduction zone. At issue are the current plate configuration and rate of subduction but Silverthrone's chemistry indicates that Silverthrone is subduction related.|$|E

5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>an</b> {{effective}} antiseptic {{when used}} as a 1% solution, with broad spectrum of activity against streptococci, staphylococci, pseudomonas, enterococci and others. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> option for skin infections caused by pseudomonas resistant to typical antibiotics.|$|R
5|$|Ununennium is {{predicted}} to have a melting point between 0°C and 30°C: thus <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> liquid at room temperature. It is not known whether this continues the trend of decreasing melting points down the group, as francium's melting point is known so poorly, having been variously been stated to be around 23°C or 27°C, with both values {{very close to the}} caesium value (28.5°C), possibly due to the extreme heat generated by francium's radioactive decay. The boiling point of ununennium is expected to be around 630°C, which is lower than that of all the previous elements in the group, following the downward periodic trend. The density of ununennium has been variously predicted to be between 3 and 4g·cm−3, continuing the trend of increasing density down the group, using the predicted value for francium between 2.8 and 3.0g·cm−3.|$|E
5|$|When {{interpreted}} as a proof within a first-order set theory, such as ZFC, Dedekind's categoricity proof for PA shows that each model of set theory has a unique model of the Peano axioms, up to isomorphism, that embeds as an initial segment of all other models of PA contained within that model of set theory. In the standard model of set theory, this smallest model of PA is the standard model of PA; however, in a nonstandard model of set theory, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> nonstandard model of PA. This situation cannot be avoided with any first-order formalization of set theory.|$|E
5|$|Within its genus, the Iago sparrow {{has been}} {{considered}} one of the African 'rufous sparrows', a group which also includes species such as the great sparrow (Passer motitensis). These birds were usually treated as distinct species until Reginald Ernest Moreau, writing in the 1962 Check-list of the Birds of the World, lumped the Iago sparrow and the mainland rufous sparrows as the single species Passer motitensis. This taxonomy was followed frequently until J. Denis Summers-Smith, a world authority on sparrows, argued in the 1980s that the Iago sparrow's many differences in morphology and behaviour, and separation from the other rufous sparrows by about , are sufficient grounds for species status. Studies of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA have since suggested <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> close relative of the house sparrow and the Spanish sparrow and not the rufous sparrows.|$|E
