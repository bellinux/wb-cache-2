40|$|In the Golden Blocks area, vein-type {{gold and}} sparse {{sulphide}} mineralization occur in slightly metamorphosed, complexly deformed, Lower Ordovician sandstones and mudstones.

Eighty-five percent of the gold production from the area has come from five workings confined to the stratigraphically lowest, most widespread occurrence of mudstone.

2500|$|Extending from Net Lake to Vermilion Lake lies a northeast-southwest {{trending}} high strain zone {{known as}} the Net Lake-Vermilion Lake <b>Deformation</b> <b>Zone.</b> Because geologic mapping has not been done comprehensively throughout this zone, its exact width is unknown. The expression of this <b>deformation</b> <b>zone</b> is clearly identifiable by the intense change in volcanic rocks of the TGB. Volcanic units comprising the northwestern portion of the shear zone have shifted to the northeast while the volcanic rocks comprising its southeastern portion have shifted to the southwest. Along the northeastern arm of Lake Temagami in Strathcona Township lies the Northeast Arm <b>Deformation</b> <b>Zone.</b> This northeast-trending shear zone has not been studied in detail, but casual studies of many islands along the northeastern arm of Lake Temagami have shown that there is severe foliation and minor ferroan carbonate across an area about [...] wide.

It extends through Link Lake to east of Highway 11, but it is uncertain whether it extends west of Link Lake because no expression of it has been found in the Sherman Mine area. Therefore, the Link Lake Shear Zone might be a northern extension of the Northeast Arm <b>Deformation</b> <b>Zone</b> further south. Strain intensity of the Link Lake Shear Zone is diverse.

2500|$|The TGB {{contains}} massive banded iron formations {{and several}} precious metal and base metal deposits. The banded iron formations range from [...] to [...] {{to more than}} [...] thick. Remnants of volcanic vents are an important locator for mineral potential in the Temagami belt because they are adjacent to rocks that contain certain types of mineralization. At the Link Lake Formation, good evidence for copper-zinc massive sulfide deposits has been discovered in associated volcanic rocks. Some gold mineralization may also be associated with volcanic vents. Studies of greenstone terranes in the Superior craton have shown that large gold deposits are associated with regional deformation zones. Therefore, the Northeast Arm <b>Deformation</b> <b>Zone,</b> the Link Lake Shear Zone and the Net Lake-Vermilion Lake <b>Deformation</b> <b>Zone</b> are obvious high potential areas. A number of scattered pyrite deposits can be found throughout the Northeast Arm <b>Deformation</b> <b>Zone.</b> The high frequency of gold mineralization in and near the Net Lake-Vermilion Lake <b>Deformation</b> <b>Zone</b> suggests that this <b>deformation</b> <b>zone</b> may very well also contain gold deposits; at least 11 have been discovered within a [...] length of the <b>deformation</b> <b>zone.</b> The gold deposits are found in many rock types, indicating a stronger gold-bearing system with the potential of larger gold deposits.

40|$|International audienceTo {{characterize}} {{the origin of}} the fluids involved in the San Andreas Fault (SAF) system, we carried out an isotope study of exhumed faulted rocks from <b>deformation</b> <b>zones,</b> vein fillings and their hosts and the fluid inclusions associated with these materials. Samples were collected from segments along the SAF system selected to provide a depth profile from upper to lower crust. In all, 75 samples from various structures and lithologies from 13 localities were analyzed for noble gas, carbon, and oxygen isotope compositions. Fluid inclusions exhibit helium isotope ratios (3 He/ 4 He) of 0. 1 - 2. 5 times the ratio in air, indicating that past fluids percolating through the SAF system contained mantle helium contributions of at least 35 %, similar to what has been measured in present-day ground waters associated with the fault (Kennedy et al., 1997). Calcite is the predominant vein mineral and is a common accessory mineral in <b>deformation</b> <b>zones.</b> A systematic variation of C- and O-isotope compositions of carbonates from veins, <b>deformation</b> <b>zones</b> and their hosts suggests percolation by external fluids of similar compositions and origin with the amount of fluid infiltration increasing from host rocks to vein to <b>deformation</b> <b>zones.</b> The isotopic trend observed for carbonates in veins and <b>deformation</b> <b>zones</b> follows that shown by carbonates in host limestones, marbles, and other host rocks, increasing with increasing contribution of deep metamorphic crustal volatiles. At each crustal level, the composition of the infiltrating fluids is thus buffered by deeper metamorphic sources. A negative correlation between calcite δ 13 C and fluid inclusion 3 He/ 4 He is consistent with a mantle origin for a fraction of the infiltrating CO 2. Noble gas and stable isotope systematics show consistent evidence for the involvement of mantle-derived fluids combined with infiltration of deep metamorphic H 2 O and CO 2 in faulting, supporting the involvement of deep fluids percolating through and perhaps weakening the fault zone. There is no clear evidence for a significant contribution from meteoric water, except for overprinting related to late weathering...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Development of bulk ultra-fine grained (UFG) {{materials}} by severe {{plastic deformation}} to attain improved mechanical properties {{is becoming more}} attractive and extensively studied nowadays. Equal channel angular extrusion (ECAE) is one of technique used effectively for obtaining bulk UFG materials. Novelty of this technique is one can build up significant amount of plastic strain by {{increasing the number of}} passes without much dimensional change. In present investigation dynamic recrystallization at <b>deformation</b> <b>zones</b> around the non-shearable second phase particles in Al-Li based alloy processed by ECAE is reported. Transmission electron microscopy technique involving imaging the regions of such <b>deformation</b> <b>zones</b> with different specimen tilt conditions is used. It is shown that the dynamic recrystallisation occurring in the proximities of second phase particles during the deformation at room temperature, leads to very fine grained microstructure. Observation of multiple active nucleation sites around even sub-micrometer sized non-deformable particles in the as-processed material indicates that the system exhibits efficiency> 1 based on the concept of particle stimulated nucleation (PSN). Crystallites of ultra-fine/nano-crystalline size ranges are formed in the <b>deformation</b> <b>zones</b> around the non-deformable particles during deformation itself. Effect of short term post deformation annealing to understand the recovery and recrystallization was undertaken. Based on these results effect of optimal post deformation heat treatment conditions on the thermal stability of the microstructures is emphasized.

40|$|Forward {{numerical}} {{models are}} used to investigate the effect of deformation regime {{on the development of}} olivine lattice-preferred orientations (LPO) and associated seismic anisotropy within continental <b>deformation</b> <b>zones.</b> LPO predicted to form by pure shear, simple shear, transpression, or transtension are compared to a database comprising ca. 200 olivine LPO from naturally deformed upper mantle rocks. This comparison suggests that simple shear or plane combinations of simple and pure shear are probably the dominant deformation regimes in the upper mantle. Seismic properties, calculated using the modeled olivine LPO, suggest that seismic anisotropy data may carry information on the deformation regimes active in the lithospheric mantle, although not all deformation regimes are characterized by a distinct seismic anisotropy signal. Transtensional deformation in continental rift systems should result in fast S-wave polarization and P-wave propagation directions oblique to the rift trend within the extended lithospheric mantle. Simple shear (wrench) or transpression in vertical <b>deformation</b> <b>zones</b> and pure shear (horizontal extension) result in similar seismic anisotropy.
