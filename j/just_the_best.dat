500|$|Hetfield {{stated that}} the album was written with [...] "a lot of passion". He said, [...] "There's two years of {{condensed}} emotion in this. We've gone {{through a lot of}} personal changes, struggles, epiphanies, it's deep. It's so deep lyrically and musically. [...] is <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> that it can be from us right now." [...] The band purposely wanted a raw sound on the album so that Rock did not polish the sound while mixing. The band desired the raw sound because of the depth of the emotion they felt {{and did not want to}} [...] "mess with it". Rock commented, [...] "I wanted to do something to shake up radio and the way everything else sounds. To me, this album sounds like four guys in a garage getting together and writing rock songs. There was really no time to get amazing performances out of James. We liked the raw performances. And we didn't do what everyone does and what I've been guilty of for a long time, which is tuning vocals. We just did it, boom, and that was it." ...|$|E
500|$|The English version {{released}} {{the following year}} met with a similar response, with Skid of GameFan magazine calling it [...] "far and away the best RPG I have ever played in English", praising the game's graphics, sound, and story as [...] "well conceived and executed". The magazine's editors would later name it as the greatest role-playing game of 1993. GamePro similarly reviewed it as [...] "not <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> Sega CD RPG ever, {{but one of the}} best on any Sega system", giving particular merit to the game's translation. Game Players described it as a [...] "solid RPG, and well worth your time" [...] but found fault in the game's small character graphics that [...] "look like every other RPG" [...] and the virtually non-existent replay value. Electronic Gaming Monthly had five reviewers, Ed, Dano, Al, Sushi-X, and Mike, give the game scores of 9, 8, 7, 7, and 7, respectively, ranging from [...] "worthy" [...] to [...] "virtually flawless" [...] ratings. The magazine commended the game's background music soundtrack but described its battle sequences as [...] "a bit dull." [...] EGMs 1999 Video Game Buyer's Guide listed four of these scores, 9, 8, 7, and 7, averaging out to 7.75 out of 10 overall, and described the game as [...] "one of the best RPGs ever." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{executive}} producer, Price {{was responsible}} for [...] "shaping the album's sound", deciding its track listing, and mixing the songs {{in order to ensure}} that they [...] "feel like they're part of the same album". Popjustice commented that every song on the album has [...] "gone through a bit of a Stuart Price filter so that it doesn't sound like some dickhead [...] A has just aimlessly scooped a load of tracks off a shelf". Aphrodite marked the first time Minogue enlisted an executive producer; discussing the process, she said [...] "It was <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> experience, and funnily enough I think it's the most cohesive album I've had since the beginning of my career, back in the PWL days, where by its very nature made it cohesive. There's a lot to be said for working with different producers and trying different stuff which has worked really well for me in the past but I definitely wanted someone to tie this together as Stuart has done so beautifully [...] so that it existed as a real body of work". Minogue and Price subjected songs on Aphrodite to a [...] "Parton Test", as they [...] "knew a song would work if it made sense when sung in the style of Dolly Parton". Shears also contributed to the album, while two of Pallot's collaborations with Minogue were kept. Additional collaborators on the album include Scottish disc jockey Calvin Harris, Swedish disc jockey Sebastian Ingrosso and Belgian musician Pascal Gabriel.|$|E

500|$|... "Blink" [...] {{received}} universal critical acclaim, {{with many}} praising the acting, the script, {{the level of}} fear and the Weeping Angels themselves. The Guardian Stephen Brook called it a [...] "wonderfully creepy episode" [...] that [...] "ultimately made sense" [...] despite [...] "barely featur the Doctor and Martha". David Bradley of SFX awarded [...] "Blink" [...] five out of five stars, saying {{that it could have}} featured any of the previous Doctors and predicted that its [...] "timelessness" [...] would ensure that it would [...] " [...] down as one of the finest, scariest, cleverest Who episodes ever". IGN's Travis Fickett gave the episode 9.1 out of 10, praising the way the audience felt they had known Sally Sparrow for a while, as well as the strength of Mulligan's performance, although he noted that [...] "all of the performances in this episode are exceptional". He concluded that, [...] "it's difficult to believe that so much was accomplished in such a short amount of time. The story of not one, but two relationships was told, several time lines intersected and a new and rather frightening enemy was vanquished without The Doctor ever coming face to face with them". Ross Ruedinger of Slant Magazine believed that the episode was not <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> Doctor Who episode, but also a great episode of the science fiction and horror genre that could allow it to stand alone. He also praised the fear-inducing concept of the Weeping Angels as well the [...] "tenderness of the story and the characters" [...] which were [...] "quite intricate given how much is going on in these 45 minutes". The Daily Telegraph named the episode one of the best of the show's entire run, noting that, while the Doctor [...] "is somewhat on the periphery here", it [...] "adds to the threat".|$|E
500|$|Q {{magazine}} {{gave the}} album {{four out of}} five stars, stating [...] "It speaks volumes for Pearl Jam's continuing creative acumen that they can respond so confidently to a new punk scene that has sprung up." [...] Robert Christgau of The Village Voice gave the album an A- rating, writing that [...] "Three or four of these songs are faster and riffier than anything else in P. Jam's book, token experiments like [...] "Bugs" [...] are genuinely weird, and in an era of compulsory irony [...] sincerity is something like a relief—a Kurtlike relief at that." [...] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B+. He said, [...] "Vitalogy marks the first time it's possible to respect the band's music as much as its stance." [...] He added that [...] "despite its musical advances, Vitalogy leaves an odd, unsettling aftertaste. You walk away from it energized, but wondering what price Eddie Vedder, and Pearl Jam, will ultimately pay for it." [...] Chicago Sun-Times writer Jim DeRogatis gave it three out of four stars and commended Pearl Jam for their earnest songwriting. However, DeRogatis also wrote that the album [...] "leaves you wishing that they'd just lighten up". USA Todays Edna Gundersen gave Vitalogy three and a half out of four stars and stated that it [...] "delivers the band's most compelling, inventive and confident music to date", while calling it [...] "the rebel yell of a band that is maturing without mellowing". Los Angeles Times critic Robert Hilburn gave Vitalogy four out of four stars and viewed its music as an improvement over Pearl Jam's previous work, writing [...] "This isn't <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> Pearl Jam album but a better album than the band once even seemed capable of making". AllMusic staff writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album four and a half out of five stars, saying, [...] "Pearl Jam are at their best when they're fighting, whether it's Ticketmaster, fame, or their own personal demons." [...] According to The New Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), [...] "By Vitalogy PJ hit their apex … the band's creative zenith, finding them doing a Led Zeppelin III on acoustic tracks like 'Corduroy' and turning in a Tom Waits-like weird attack on 'Bugs'".|$|E

In January 2008, seven Swedish members of {{parliament}} from the conservative Moderate Party, {{senior member of the}} governing Alliance coalition, authored a piece in a Swedish tabloid calling for the complete decriminalisation of filesharing.

2500|$|French group Association des audionautes is not anti-copyright per se, but {{proposes a}} {{reformed}} system for copyright enforcement and compensation. Aziz Ridouan, {{co-founder of the}} group, proposes for France to legalise peer-to-peer file sharing and to compensate artists through a surcharge on Internet service provider fees (i.e. an alternative compensation system). Reportedly, major music companies have equated Ridouan's proposal with legitimising piracy. In January 2008, seven Swedish members of parliament from the Moderate Party (part of the governing coalition), authored a piece in a Swedish tabloid calling for the complete decriminalisation of file sharing; they wrote that [...] "Decriminalising all non-commercial file sharing and forcing the market to adapt is not <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> solution.

2500|$|The team {{originally}} used American football commentators, but we {{were asked}} to make [...] "everything more British," [...] so they hired English actor Hugh Dennis to perform the voice of Ralph and ex-footballer Ray Wilkins to perform the voice of Tony; Robinson recalled that Dennis' [...] "Eddie Waring-esque commentary" [...] was deliberately intended to contrasted with the [...] "dry and amusing delivery" [...] of Wilkins. Actors that were intended for the role of the Tango drinker were passed over as they did not like the idea of being slapped; the role ultimately went to an actor whose identity has not been discussed. Robinson praised him, saying that he was a [...] "really good actor, and he was <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> at reacting to being hit, he never made {{a big deal out of}} it," [...] calling his performance [...] "cool and dopey." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{influence}} of the Beach Boys' peers combined with Brian's competitive nature drove him to reach higher creative peaks. He has said, [...] "It isn't easy for me.

[...] He named [...] "What a Fool Believes" [...] (1978) as a song he considers a [...] "scary record" [...] and once believed that Procol Harum's [...] "A Whiter Shade of Pale" [...] (1967) was his funeral march. In 1986, Brian told David Toop: [...] "I listened {{to a lot of}} orchestral music. I learned a lot of tricks too. Nelson Riddle taught me a lot about arranging."

2500|$|This is {{the first}} film {{adaptation}} from a Thomas Pynchon novel with Anderson describing it [...] "like a Cheech & Chong movie". Years prior, Anderson considered adapting Pynchon's 1990 novel Vineland but could not figure out how but when Inherent Vice came out {{he was drawn to}} it and wrote the film concurrently with The Master. Anderson significantly changed the ending from the novel and described the novel as [...] "deeply written and beautifully profound stuff mixed in with <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> fart jokes and poop jokes that you can imagine." [...] Anderson drew inspiration from Kiss Me Deadly, The Big Sleep, Raymond Chandler's The Long Goodbye, and Cheech & Chong's Up in Smoke. Anderson has said he tried to cram as many jokes onto the screen as Pynchon squeezed onto the page and that the visual gags and gimmicks were inspired by Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker-style slapstick spoofs like Police Squad!, Top Secret!, and Airplane!. Anderson also used the underground comic strip Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers as what he has described as an invaluable [...] "research bible" [...] for the writing process.|$|E

2500|$|In late 1976, he {{auditioned for}} Iron Maiden, {{eager to get}} back into [...] "a more sort of heavy rock-type vibe." [...] at the time, the band already had two guitarists, Dave Sullivan and Terry Rance, who disapproved of Murray's admittance, seeing it as a slight on their ability. The group's founder and bassist Steve Harris did not {{hesitate}} in choosing Murray over Sullivan and Rance, stating, [...] "When the others made it plain that it was either them or Dave Murray, there was no choice. There was no way I was gonna let Dave go. Not only was he a nice bloke, he was <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> guitarist I'd ever worked with. He still is." [...] Unfortunately, after only a few months in the band, Murray was sacked following an argument with then vocalist Dennis Wilcock after a show at the Bridgehouse pub in Canning Town which led him to team up with Adrian Smith again in his band, Urchin. During his short tenure with this group, Murray recorded one single, entitled [...] "She's A Roller", after which he was asked to rejoin Iron Maiden following Dennis Wilcock's departure.|$|E
