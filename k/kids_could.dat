500|$|The {{film was}} a {{critical}} success, though some critics wondered about the social impact of a character that they saw as sympathetic.

500|$|Townshend {{focused on}} writing {{meaningful}} lyrics inspired by Bob Dylan, whose words dealt with subjects other than boy–girl relationships that were common in rock music; {{in contrast to}} Dylan's intellectualism, Townshend believed his lyrics should be about things <b>kids</b> <b>could</b> relate to. Early material focused on the frustration and anxiety shared by mod audiences, which Townshend said {{was a result of}} [...] "searching for [...] niche". By The Who Sell Out, he began to work narrative and characters into songs, which he fully developed by Tommy, including spiritual themes influenced by Baba. From the mid-1970s onwards, his songs tended to be more personal, which influenced his decision to go solo.|$|E

500|$|Take Me Home {{was written}} in groups and has an average of just under five songwriters per track. [...] "The Swedish-style songwriting: melody first" [...] was {{predominantly}} utilised, according to Time correspondent Douglas Wolk. Savan Kotecha, Yacoub, and Falk, who composed One Direction's hits, [...] "What Makes You Beautiful" [...] and [...] "One Thing", spent six months in Stockholm, Sweden, developing songs for the album, {{and were able to}} shape melodies around their tones. Kotecha reflected: [...] "We’ll spend days, sometimes weeks, challenging the melody. The goal is to make it sound like anyone can do this, but it's actually very difficult". In addition, after viewing the international success of [...] "What Makes You Beautiful", the trio conceptualised songs [...] "that <b>kids</b> <b>could</b> play on guitar and cover on YouTube." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} the Pokémon saga stems from the hobby of insect collecting, a popular pastime which game {{designer}} Satoshi Tajiri enjoyed as a child. While growing up, however, he observed more urbanization {{taking place in the}} town where he lived and as a result, the insect population declined. Tajiri noticed that kids now played in their homes instead of outside and he {{came up with the idea}} of a video game, containing creatures that resembled insects, called Pokémon. He thought <b>kids</b> <b>could</b> relate with the Pokémon by individually naming them, and then controlling them to represent fear or anger as a good way of relieving stress. However, Pokémon never bleed or die in battle, only faint– this was a very touchy subject to Tajiri, as he did not want to further fill the gaming world with [...] "pointless violence".|$|E
500|$|The show's {{producers}} and writers {{decided to build}} the new show around a brownstone on an inner-city street, a choice writer Michael Davis called [...] "unprecedented". They reproduced their viewers' neighborhoods—as writer Cary O'Dell described it, [...] "a realistic city street, complete with peeling paint, alleys, front stoops, and metal trash cans along the sidewalk". [...] Director Jon Stone was convinced {{that in order for}} inner-city children to relate to Sesame Street, the show had to be set in a familiar place. Despite its urban setting, the producers depicted the world in a positive way—both realistically and as it could be. [...] They attempted to present [...] "an idealized world of learning and play", and from a child's perspective. Director Jim Martin called Sesame Street [...] "an urban show <b>kids</b> <b>could</b> relate to" [...] and [...] "a reality show with a sprinkling of fantasy".|$|E

500|$|... "Pour Me", {{the last}} soft {{song on the}} album, is a dark ballad that has been often {{compared}} to Eminem's [...] "Stan". Johnny3Tears stated that, [...] "We were messing around with chord progressions and that came out like a more major chord style than we were used to it. It's melodic and poppy sounding. We're talking about drinking obviously because all of us sometimes drink too much. It's one of those basic every day things that people go through but they don't know how to voice it or others around them don't know to voice it. It's almost like you're looked down upon, but no one actually talks about it." [...] "Tendencies", which is the closing track for the standard edition of the album, is a high tempo alternative metal song about murder. Johnny3Tears said, [...] "When we wrote Tendencies, I {{wanted to make a}} song that kids would just go nuts to when we played it. Kids start moshpits at our shows.

[...] Badu's iChat contacts, including hip hop producers Questlove, Madlib, 9th Wonder, and J Dilla, instant messaged her {{to get back into}} the studio and sent her tracks. Such exchanges inspired a creative spark for Badu, which she explained in an interview for the Dallas Observer, [...] "I started to accept that maybe it's OK for me to put out music, and it doesn't have to be something dynamic or world-changing. But just as I was accepting that, here comes this burst of light and energy and creativity.

[...] While calling it a [...] "gem" [...] and of [...] "entertaining nature", he criticized the storylines as [...] "repetitive" [...] and said the show [...] "lacks the genius of SpongeBob". Terrence Briggs of Animation World Magazine considered every second of the show [...] "filler" [...] and lamented that the main characters are drawn as [...] "products from the school of acid-trip caricature."

500|$|Mother's Milk {{instantly}} garnered {{more attention}} than the band's previous records and, as such, the venues the band performed in were able to accommodate far larger crowds.
