5|$|In Coats Grove, Michigan, {{teenager}} Bobby Rich is berated by {{his stepfather}} Phil for not finishing his lawn {{work outside the}} house. Bobby runs into a nearby orchard and Phil gives chase. When Bobby's mother, Patti, follows them into the orchard, she discovers Phil's body partially buried, seemingly drowned in mud. Kneeling beside Phil is Bobby, his <b>eyes</b> <b>wide</b> with terror.|$|E
5|$|Dynamic editing {{contributed to}} the surrealistic nature of the episode. Abrupt cuts from {{close-up}} to extreme wide angles and sudden shifts from normal speed to super slow-motion are used in Buffy's dream: several sequences become slow-motion partway through them, then revert to normal speed as they continue. Xander's dream features mismatches between sound and image: characters are sometimes shown not speaking even as their voices are heard. Additionally, silence is used frequently, to both reflect the characters' disorientation and to unsettle the audience. Whedon cited films by Steven Soderbergh as his main inspirations for the odd editing, especially The Limey and The Underneath. He also listed Orson Welles' version of The Trial and Stanley Kubrick's <b>Eyes</b> <b>Wide</b> Shut as inspirations for many of his shooting and editing decisions.|$|E
5|$|P. R. Brown {{directed}} this video, which premiered on VH1 Classic on 8 August 2006. There are {{similarities between}} the video for Meat Loaf's version of the song, and that the video for that of Celine Dion, with Meat Loaf being haunted {{by the memory of}} his lover. It is structured differently, however, with the story being told through flashback. Shots when Raven's character is alive have a distinct yellow tint, with a darker, blue tint for those after her death. Whereas the motorcyclist dies before the first verse in the Dion version, Raven's crash and resulting death is not shown until the final chorus. Meat Loaf becomes angry with Raven because the ghost of Raven's former lover appears at a masquerade ball they are attending (some reviewers have compared this to the Stanley Kubrick film <b>Eyes</b> <b>Wide</b> Shut).|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Kubrick and Harlan thought A.I. {{would be}} closer to Steven Spielberg's {{sensibilities}} as director. Kubrick handed the position to Spielberg in 1995, but Spielberg chose to direct other projects, and convinced Kubrick to remain as director. The film was put on hold due to Kubrick's commitment to <b>Eyes</b> <b>Wide</b> Shut (1999). After the filmmaker's death in March 1999, Harlan and Christiane Kubrick approached Spielberg {{to take over the}} director's position. By November 1999, Spielberg was writing the screenplay based on Watson's 90-page story treatment. It was his first solo screenplay credit since Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977). Spielberg remained close to Watson's treatment, but removed various sex scenes with Gigolo Joe. Pre-production was briefly halted during February 2000, because Spielberg pondered directing other projects, which were Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Minority Report and Memoirs of a Geisha. The following month Spielberg announced that A.I. would be his next project, with Minority Report as a follow-up. When he decided to fast track A.I., Spielberg brought Chris Baker back as concept artist.|$|E

25|$|<b>Eyes</b> <b>Wide</b> Shut {{opened on}} July 16, 1999, in the United States. The film topped the weekend box office, with $21.7 million from 2,411 screens. These numbers surpassed the studio's {{expectations}} of $20 million, and became both Cruise's sixth consecutive chart topper and Kubrick's highest opening weekend. Audiences attendance dropped from Friday to Saturday, which analysts {{attributed to the}} news coverage of John F. Kennedy, Jr.'s disappearance. <b>Eyes</b> <b>Wide</b> Shut ended up grossing a total of $55,691,208 in the US. The numbers put it as Kubrick's second most successful film in the country, behind 2001: A Space Odyssey, but were considered a box office disappointment.|$|E
25|$|One motif {{from the}} second {{movement}} of Ligeti's Musica ricercata is used at pivotal moments in <b>Eyes</b> <b>Wide</b> Shut. At the German premiere of that film, by which time Kubrick had died, his widow was escorted by Ligeti himself.|$|E
25|$|Doven met {{a fellow}} {{assistant}} to Cruise, Andrea Morse, and they subsequently married. Andrea Morse {{is the daughter}} of actor Robert Morse. Doven's wife reached the Operating Thetan level of OT VI, in 2000. She received film credits as Production Associate on movies starring Tom Cruise's then-wife Nicole Kidman, including <b>Eyes</b> <b>Wide</b> Shut, Portrait of a Lady and Practical Magic. Cruise included Doven in family outings, often taking him along for trips with his son Connor Cruise. Doven was the only individual from Cruise's entourage to accompany the actor on a 2002 trip to NASA to meet with astronauts on the Space Shuttle program. Doven had an acting film role in Cruise's <b>Eyes</b> <b>Wide</b> Shut, directed by Stanley Kubrick, in addition to serving in a film production capacity on the movie.|$|E

25|$|Warner Bros. heavily {{promoted}} <b>Eyes</b> <b>Wide</b> Shut, while following Kubrick's secrecy campaign – to {{the point}} the film's press kits contained no production notes – and also the director's suggestions to Semel regarding the marketing campaign, given one week prior to Kubrick's death. The first footage was shown to theater owners attending the 1999 ShoWest convention in Las Vegas. TV spots featured both Isaak and Ligeti's songs from the soundtrack, while revealing little about the movie's plot. The film also appeared {{on the cover of}} Time magazine, and on show business programs such as Entertainment Tonight and Access Hollywood.|$|E
25|$|Citing {{contractual}} obligations to deliver an R rating, Warner Bros. digitally altered the orgy for the American release, blocking out graphic sexuality by inserting additional figures {{to obscure the}} view, avoiding an adults-only NC-17 rating that limited distribution, as some large American theaters and video store operators disallow films with that rating. This alteration antagonized film critics and cinephiles, as they argued that Kubrick had never been shy about ratings (A Clockwork Orange was originally given an X-rating). The unrated version of <b>Eyes</b> <b>Wide</b> Shut was released in the United States on October 23, 2007, in DVD, HD DVD, and Blu-ray Disc formats.|$|E

The method may not be perfect, but it is all I have.|$|E
25|$|On October 23, 2007, Warner Home Video {{released}} <b>Eyes</b> <b>Wide</b> Shut in {{a special}} edition DVD, plus the HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc formats. This is the first home video release that presents the film in anamorphic 1.78:1 (16:9) format (note that the film was shown theatrically as soft matted 1.66:1 in Europe and 1.85:1 in the USA and Japan). The previous DVD release used a 1.33:1 (4:3) aspect ratio. It is also the first American home video release to feature the uncut version. Although the earliest American DVD of the uncut version states on the cover that it includes both the R-rated and unrated editions, in actuality only the unrated edition is on the DVD.|$|E

Her {{breakthrough}} came in 1989 with the thriller Dead Calm {{and the television}} miniseries Bangkok Hilton. In 1990, she made her Hollywood debut in the racing film Days of Thunder, opposite Tom Cruise. She went on to achieve wide recognition with leading roles in the romantic drama Far and Away (1992), the superhero film Batman Forever (1995), the crime comedy-drama To Die For (1995), for which she won a Golden Globe Award, and the erotic thriller <b>Eyes</b> <b>Wide</b> Shut (1999). She received two consecutive Academy Award for Best Actress nominations for playing a courtesan in the musical Moulin Rouge!
