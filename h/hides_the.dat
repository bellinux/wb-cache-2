40|$|Steganography is a {{technique}} of <b>hiding</b> <b>the</b> data in images. It is derived from Greek word that means “Covered”. Secret messages are embedded into the cover image to hide its existence from <b>the</b> hackers. While <b>hiding</b> <b>the</b> data in the image, {{there are two main}} things that we should kept in mind are maintaining the quality and security of image. There are no of points where we can <b>hide</b> <b>the</b> data in the cover image. Finding these optimal points for <b>hiding</b> <b>the</b> data is quite difficult work to do. So we require an efficient method for finding an optimal solution. For that we can use no. of optimization algorithm, Particle Swarm optimization is one of them which can be used for finding an optimal matrix for <b>hiding</b> <b>the</b> data. In this paper we are going to review some techniques of steganography for <b>hiding</b> <b>the</b> data and PSO algorithm for optimization...|$|R
5|$|Wool {{and hides}} were the major exports {{in the late}} Middle Ages. From 1327 to 1332, the {{earliest}} period for which figures survive, the annual average was 5,700 sacks of wool and 36,100 leather <b>hides.</b> <b>The</b> disruption of the Wars of Independence, which not only limited trade but damaged much of the valuable agricultural land of the Borders and Lowlands, meant that this fell in the period 1341–42 to 1342–43 to 2,450 sacks of wool and 17,900 <b>hides.</b> <b>The</b> trade recovered to reach a peak in the 1370s, with an annual average of 7,360 sacks, but the international recession from the 1380s saw a reduction to an annual average of 3,100 sacks. The introduction of sheep-scab was a serious blow to the wool trade from the early fifteenth century. Despite a levelling-off, in the Low Countries there was another drop in exports as the markets collapsed in the early-sixteenth century. Unlike in England, this did not prompt the Scots to turn to large-scale cloth production and only poor-quality rough cloths {{seem to have been}} significant.|$|E

40|$|Stegnography {{is about}} <b>hiding</b> <b>the</b> {{information}} whether <b>the</b> <b>hiding</b> thing {{is an image}} only. We should encrypt <b>the</b> information before <b>hiding</b> it. Many different formats of files {{can be used to}} <b>hide</b> <b>the</b> information but digital files are most widely used because of their frequency on internet.
