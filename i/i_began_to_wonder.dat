500|$|After {{ending his}} playing career for good, Motley asked Brown about a {{coaching}} {{job with the}} team. Brown, however, rejected his overtures, saying Motley should instead look for work at a steel mill – the very career football was his ticket out of. Unable to find coaching opportunities in the NFL, {{he worked as a}} whisky salesman in the early 1960s. He got occasional scouting assignments from the Browns, but as the Civil Rights Movement began to coalesce in 1965, he issued a statement saying he had been refused a permanent coaching position by the team numerous times. He applied for a coaching job in 1964, he wrote, and was told that there were no vacancies. The Browns then hired Bob Nussbaumer as an assistant. [...] "When I heard of the hiring of a new assistant, <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> if the full reason {{is whether or not the}} time is ripe to hire a Negro coach in Cleveland on the professional level," [...] he wrote. Art Modell, the Browns' owner, responded by saying the team filled its coaching positions based on ability and experience, not race. [...] "We are represented by scouts at every major Negro school. And we now have 12 Negroes signed for the 1965 season," [...] he said.|$|E
500|$|Writing for The Scotsman, Andrea Mullaney articulated, [...] "Theroux {{really had}} found the {{ultimate}} in weirdness for his latest documentary – they're so beyond the point of reason, into a self-perpetuating psychosis, {{that no matter how}} he tried, he couldn't challenge their beamingly-delivered pronouncements, or trip them up. But he did manage to show them as human beings (more than the courtesy they extend to us sinners)." [...] Hilary Fannin of The Irish Times commented that the airing of the documentary, [...] "saw Louis Theroux, in The Most Hated Family in America, shatter another redneck American target, the Westboro Baptist Church". In a review of the documentary for The Sunday Times, Roland White discussed Theroux's stylistic technique, [...] "Theroux's usual technique [...] the friendly ingenue [...] made absolutely no impact on these people. It was like watching a youngster from a village cricket team trying to bowl out Geoff Boycott, and <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> what Theroux was hoping to achieve. It is impossible to outargue the religious bigot. They have impeccable logic on their side: the word of God is the righteous truth; only they understand the true word of the Lord; therefore, they are right and everybody else is wrong." [...] Liverpool Daily Post recommended the film in its column, [...] "Sunday: What to Watch". Writing for the Birmingham Mail, Graham Young observed, [...] "The Most Hated Family in America is the best documentary from Louis since long before his Michael Jackson fiasco." [...] John Dugdale of The Sunday Times highlighted the film as his [...] "Pick of the day". Dugdale wrote favorably of the film, [...] "There are echoes of Theroux's film about a woman raising her daughters as neo-Nazis as he watches Phelps' daughter, Shirley, handing out placards to kids as young as seven. While tangling with her and her dad is pointless, the family's younger women are less inflexible, and his encounters with them are more rewarding." [...] A review in the Leicester Mercury noted of Theroux's interview techniques, [...] "His subtle interviewing style was perfect for showing off the crazy views of the members." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "We went to Pendlebury in 1909 from a {{residential}} side of Manchester, and we didn't like it. My father {{wanted to go}} to get near a friend for business reasons. We lived next door, {{and for a long time}} my mother never got to like it, and at first I disliked it, and then after about a year or so I got used to it, and then I got absorbed in it, then I got infatuated with it. Then <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> if anyone had ever done it. Seriously, not one or two, but seriously; and it seemed to me by that time that it was a very fine industrial subject matter. And I couldn't see anybody at that time who had done it – and nobody had done it, it seemed." ...|$|E

2500|$|Elements of {{the history}} of Star Wars are {{commonly}} disputed, as George Lucas' statements about it have changed over time. One of the claims is that he intended to make the film a Space Western. Lucas has said that it was early as 1971—after he completed directing his first full-length feature, THX 1138—that he first had an idea for a space fantasy film, though he has also claimed to have had the idea long before then. In the 2010 coffee table book Star Wars: Year By Year: A Visual Chronicle produced by DK Publishing and Lucasfilm, George Lucas is said to have made his film as a direct contrast to THX 1138. He felt that the bleak tone of the film led to it being poorly received, and therefore chose to make Star Wars a more optimistic film. This is what led to the fun and adventurous tone of the space opera. Originally, Lucas wanted to adapt the Flash Gordon space adventure comics and serials into his own films, having been fascinated by them since he was young. In 1979, he said, [...] "I especially loved the Flash Gordon serials... Of course I realize now how crude and badly done they were... loving them that much when they were so awful, <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> what would happen if they were done really well." ...|$|E

[...] "Well, I {{am glad to}} {{know who}} could have been so cowardly," [...] she added with withering contempt. [...] "Now <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> whether a letter which some years ago, I brought to the Abbey House to be forwarded to Godfrey, was ever posted to him who did not receive it, or whether, perhaps, it fell into the hands of--someone like you." ...|$|R

60|$|We think Townshend {{looking a}} little the worse for the winter, and we {{perceive}} Bully to be decidedly old upon his legs, and of a most diabolical turn of mind. When they first arrived the weather was very dark and cold, and kept them indoors. It has since turned very warm and bright, but with a dusty and sharp east wind. They are still kept indoors by this change, and <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> what change will let them out. Townshend dines with us every Sunday.

6000|$|The {{motto of}} the Little family was evidently [...] "variety."

60|$|One rainy afternoon, {{oppressed by}} {{infinite}} boredom, I {{went into the}} smoking-room.

6000|$|Long {{after it}} was dark I sat there, {{wondering}} whether anybody else would come. When this appeared improbable for that night, I undressed, and went to bed; and, there, <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> fearfully what would be done to me.

6000|$|... 'My dear friend,' {{rejoined the}} other, {{resuming}} his accustomed manner with infinite readiness, and throwing himself upon the bench with a weary air, 'you {{told me not}} very long ago, at that delightful old tavern of which you are the esteemed proprietor (and a most charming establishment it is for persons of rural pursuits and in robust health, who are not liable to take cold), that I had the head and heart of an evil spirit in all matters of deception. I thought at the time; I really did think; you flattered me. But now <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> at your discernment, and vanity apart, do honestly believe you spoke the truth.
