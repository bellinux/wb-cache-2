It is of great significance to study the spatiotemporal distribution of enterprises to benefit cities planning and development. Based on the enterprises registration data of Administrator for Industry and Commerce of Wuhan from 1996 to 2007, in this paper, we analysed the spatiotemporal distribution of enterprises in Wuhan city. We divided Wuhan into 2, 356 square grids with a length of 2 km and counted the number of enterprises of different <b>industry</b> <b>categories</b> in each grid. Then we calculated the aggregation intensity index of enterprises in each grid. With the method of global spatial autocorrelation analysis, we discovered the change {{of the degree of}} enterprise agglomeration for different <b>industry</b> <b>categories</b> in different periods. We also used local autocorrelation analysis to find the hotspots of enterprise distribution areas furtherly and discover the changes of the location of the hotspots during each period. Based on the two analyses and context information of Wuhan city, we can know the features of spatiotemporal distribution of enterprises. It can be concluded that the spatial distribution of enterprises could be reflected directly by spatial autocorrelation analysis. Moreover, the enterprises registration data with fine-grained enterprises spatiotemporal information can support the research of spatial distribution and evolution of enterprises. This study can show how different <b>industry</b> <b>categories</b> developed and provide reference to urban geography to help cities plan the distribution of enterprises and help enterprises decide its location...|$|R
