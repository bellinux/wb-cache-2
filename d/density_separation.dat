For exponential family models, the local <b>density</b> <b>separations</b> are shown to form the basis of a weak topology closely linked to the Euclidean metric on the natural parameters. In general, the local separations are shown to measure relative roughness of the prior distribution with respect to its corresponding posterior and provide explicit bounds for the total variation distance between an approximating posterior density to a genuine posterior. We illustrate the application of these bounds for assessing robustness of the posterior inferences for a dynamic time series model of blood glucose concentration in diabetes mellitus patients with respect to alternative prior speciﬁcations...|$|R

40|$|Coal-cleaning {{processes}} {{have been}} utilized {{to increase the}} heating value of coal by extracting ash-forming minerals in the coal. These processes involve the crushing or grinding of raw coal followed by physical separation processes, {{taking advantage of the}} density difference between carbonaceous particles and mineral particles. In addition to the desired increase in the heating value of coal, a significant reduction of the sulfur content of the coal fed to a combustion unit is effected by the removal of pyrite and other sulfides found in the mineral matter. WRI is assisting PulseWave to develop an alternate, more efficient method of liberating and separating the undesirable mineral matter from the carbonaceous matter in coal. The approach is based on PulseWave's patented resonance disintegration technology that reduces that particle size of materials by application of destructive resonance, shock waves, and vortex generating forces. Illinois No. 5 coal, a Wyodak coal, and a Pittsburgh No. 8 coal were processed using the resonance disintegration apparatus then subjected to conventional <b>density</b> <b>separations.</b> Initial microscopic results indicate that up to 90 % of the pyrite could be liberated from the coal in the machine, but limitations in the <b>density</b> <b>separations</b> reduced overall effectiveness of contaminant removal. Approximately 30 - 80 % of the pyritic sulfur and 30 - 50 % of the mercury was removed from the coal. The three coals (both with and without the pyritic phase separated out) were tested in WRI's 250, 000 Btu/hr Combustion Test Facility, designed to replicate a coal-fired utility boiler. The flue gases were characterized for elemental, particle bound, and total mercury in addition to sulfur.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{literature}} on the influence of viscosity on separation in dense medium processes, for both baths and cyclones, {{in the context of the}} well-known fundamentals of particle motion in fluids. It is concluded that viscosity does play a role in determining both the <b>separation</b> <b>density</b> and the extent of separation inefficiency (Ep). because most DMS processes probably operate in the intermediate particle flow regime. A high viscosity increases particle misplacement in baths and cyclones. It increases or decreases the <b>separation</b> <b>density</b> of bath separators (depending on whether the bath is top or bottom fed. respective. ly). and decreases the <b>separation</b> <b>density</b> in cyclones due to a reduction in the medium differential.

50|$|The {{washability}} {{analysis is}} widely known in bulk material analysis, where the specific density is the physical property describing the liberation and the separation results, {{which is then}} {{in the form of}} the partition curve. The partition curve is defined as the curve which gives as a function of a physical property or characteristic, the proportions in which different elemental classes of raw feed having the same property are split into separate products. It is thus per its definition not limited to, but predominantly applied in analysis of liberation and process efficiency of <b>density</b> <b>separation</b> processes.For sensor-based ore sorting, the partition (also called Tromp) curves for chromite, iron ore and coal are known and can thus be applied for process modelling.|$|E
50|$|As for {{any other}} {{physical}} separation process, liberation is pre-requisite for possible separation. Liberation characteristics are well known and relatively easy to study for particulate lots in smaller size ranges, e.g. flotation feed and products.

For larger particles above 10 mm it is widely known for applications that are treated using <b>density</b> <b>separation</b> methods, such as coal or iron ore. Here, the washability analysis can be conducted on sample masses up to 10 tonnes in equipped laboratories.For sensor-based sorting, where laboratory methods can only tell about the liberation characteristics where the describing feature is the density (e.g. iron ore, coal), hand counting, single-particle tests and bulk tests can reveal the liberation characteristics of a bulk material: Hereby, only single particle tests reveal the true liberation, while hand counting and bulk testing give a result which also incorporates the separation efficiency of the type of analysis.More information on the testing procedures used in technical feasibility evaluation {{can be found in the}} respective chapter.|$|E

30|$|Two {{different}} methods for nanoparticle size <b>separation</b> were used: <b>density</b> gradient <b>separation</b> and microfiltration. <b>Density</b> gradient <b>separation</b> {{was based upon}} previous methods, wherein 2  mL gradient glycerol concentrations (ranging from 30 – 90  % of glycerol by mass) were first layered in a 15 -mL conical tube [25].

Distinct bands of nanoparticles were extracted with a dispensing needle, centrifuged at 4722 [*]g for 8  min to remove the glycerol, and resuspended in water. For microfiltration, PEGylated nanoparticles were sequentially passed through 0.22 -, 0.1 -, and 0.05 -μm filters (Polycarbonate, Sterlitech). The 0.22 - and 0.1 -μm filters (PVDF Millex) were sonicated in a water-filled beaker for 30  min to remove the captured nanoparticles.
