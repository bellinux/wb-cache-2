40|$|This paper {{points out}} the {{institutional}} vulnerability of the policy-making discussions by analyzing the construction process of the so-called "university governance reform" discussions from 1998 in Japan. The Japanese government, specially the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), and many educational experts have regularized the policy discussions for the "university reforms" to struggle with the globalized <b>economic</b> <b>wars.</b> As {{the results of the}} discussions, the Japanese national universities were "incorporated" in 2004. However, the main policy interest groups, such as the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan (LDP), the Japan Business Federation (Keidanren), and the Japan Association of Corporate Executives (Keizai-doyukai) despaired the results of the "incorporation" to utilize the universities as the surviving tools for the global <b>economic</b> <b>wars.</b> The policy interest groups have formally and informally forced the government to accelerate the reforms to the "global" economic competition-oriented universities by vitalizing the management and governance by the university top-managers. The government by the policy interest groups' strong requests has actualized the critical university "governance" reforms in 2014. This paper scrutinizes the institutional vulnerability of social discussion construction processes in Japan. In addition, this paper problematizes the forfeiture of our agenda-setting and discussion rights by the economic policy interest groups' policy-making discussion control...|$|R

25|$|From the 1920s Ireland {{had high}} trade {{barriers}} {{such as high}} tariffs, particularly during the <b>Economic</b> <b>War</b> with Britain in the 1930s, and a policy of import substitution. During the 1950s, 400,000 people emigrated from Ireland. It became increasingly clear that economic nationalism was unsustainable. While other European countries enjoyed fast growth, Ireland suffered economic stagnation. The policy changes were drawn together in Economic Development, an official paper published in 1958 that advocated free trade, foreign investment, and growth rather than fiscal restraint as the prime objective of economic management.|$|E

According to Palestinian industrialists, 219 factories were destroyed or severely damaged during the Israeli military operation. Of the three per cent of industrial capacity {{that was still}} operating after the 18-month Israeli blockade, much has now been destroyed. The biggest Palestinian food-processing plant, Alweyda was devastated, as were both Abu Eida, the largest ready-mixed concrete producer, with four factories demolished, and the Al Badr flour mills, with the biggest storage facilities in the Strip. All three had close and long-standing contact with Israeli partner firms and suppliers.

It presented the United States and Europe as engaged in a silent <b>economic</b> <b>war,</b> in which Europe appeared to be completely outclassed on all fronts: management techniques, technological tools, and research capacity. Servan-Schreiber saw in this thesis {{the potential for a}} seminal book. He fleshed it out with reading keys and concrete proposals for a counter-offensive. The result was his international best-seller Le Défi Américain ("The American Challenge", 1967). It sold 600,000 copies in France, unprecedented for a political essay, and was translated into 15 languages. This book was instrumental in creating a resurgence of French nationalism and drawing attention to the importance of transnational cooperation in Europe.|$|E

25|$|Before {{that hot}} war started, France and the Republic already became {{engaged in an}} <b>economic</b> <b>war,</b> however. France {{had always been a}} very {{important}} trading partner with the Republic, especially since the 1640s. Sales of Dutch textiles, spices and other colonial wares, herring, whale products, Delftware and Gouda pipes, Baltic naval stores, tobacco products, and refined sugar (for a large part of raw sugar from French-Caribbean plantations) had greatly expanded in France. On the other hand, the Republic was a very large importer of French wine, brandy, salt, silk, paper, vinegar and Breton sail-canvas (often for reexport from its entrepot). In other words, the two economies complemented each other to a large extent (other than the Dutch and English economies, that mainly competed in the same markets). This complementarity would in modern eyes be seen as a happy opportunity for exploiting comparative advantage by specialization, which it indeed became in the years up to the mid-1650s. Unfortunately, in those days trade was seen as a zero-sum game (also by the Dutch incidentally); both parties suspected being exploited by the other.|$|E
25|$|Soon after, France's German {{allies were}} driven from the war, in an equally humiliating way. Dutch troops reconquered all lands lost to Munster. A {{strategic}} thrust to the fortress of Bonn in late 1673 forced the French {{to evacuate the}} areas she occupied in the Republic, except for Maastricht and Grave. By then the reconstituted Dutch army had again become a formidable force, as in the 1640s, its strength rising to 100,000 men, almost {{as large as the}} French army (France had a population ten times as large in these days as that of the Republic). This was accomplished by great financial outlay in the hiring of mercenary troops. But the Republic had the financial wherewithal to bear this burden, despite French hopes that it would break the Republic. The war went on till the Peace of Nijmegen in 1678. Here the Dutch finally obtained the retraction of Colbert's tariff of 1667, that had set off the <b>economic</b> <b>war.</b> However, the handling of the peace negotiations, in which Louis managed to divide his enemies, and entice the Dutch (against the wishes of William, who perceived the diplomatic cost) to conclude a separate peace, cost the Republic dearly in reputation and good will with its allies.|$|E
25|$|In 1809, the First French Empire held a {{dominant}} {{position on the}} European continent. Resounding victories during the 1805 to 1807 wars against the Third and Fourth coalitions had ensured almost undisputed continental hegemony, {{to such an extent}} that no other European power could challenge the might of Napoleon's empire. However, despite having defeated Austria, forced Russia into an uneasy alliance and reduced Prussia to the rank of a second-rate power, Napoleon did not manage to force the United Kingdom to make peace. With the British in complete control of the seas, Napoleon thus opted for an <b>economic</b> <b>war,</b> imposing the Continental System against the British Isles, in a bid to dry up vital British commercial relations with the continent. To ensure the effectiveness of the Continental System, he sought to force Portugal, a traditional British trading partner, to observe it; when diplomatic means failed in 1808, Napoleon had the country occupied, forcing the ruling dynasty of Braganza to flee the country and seek refuge in its main colony, Brazil. In a move that would prove to be both uninspired and ill-handled, Napoleon also opted to change the ruling dynasty of Spain, replacing King Charles IV with his own brother, Joseph, who became King José I of Spain. The new king was, however, not well received by the population and much of the country's ruling elite, which triggered a bloody guerrilla war throughout the country. The French position in the peninsula was rendered untenable after the Battle of Bailen, a rare and resounding defeat for the French forces and an event that greatly encouraged the Austrian war party. With Napoleon forced to intervene personally and commit increasingly significant forces to the Spanish, the French military position in central Europe was severely weakened. In addition, Franco-Russian relations had deteriorated and, although the two countries remained allies on paper, it was unlikely that Russia would commit itself seriously to fighting France's enemies on the continent.|$|E

500|$|Macdonald, {{a member}} of Beadle's ruling panel, argued that since UDI, the British {{government}} had acted unconstitutionally and illegally regarding Rhodesia by involving the United Nations in {{what should have been}} legally considered a domestic problem, and had concurrently abdicated its right to the allegiance of the Rhodesian people by waging <b>economic</b> <b>war</b> against the country and encouraging other nations to do the same. To support this argument, Macdonald referred to the assertion by the 17th-century Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius that [...] "the purpose of governing and the purpose of destroying cannot subsist together". Since Britain {{was in a state of}} <b>economic</b> <b>war</b> against Rhodesia, the court concluded, it could not at the same time be regarded as governing it.
