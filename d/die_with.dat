50|$|Criticism is dead. Which one? The bourgeois {{kind that}} prevailed. It killed itself, <b>died</b> <b>with</b> the bourgeois world {{to which it}} belonged, <b>died</b> <b>with</b> the bourgeois {{literature}} that it slapped on the back, <b>died</b> <b>with</b> the bourgeois aesthetics on which it had set its foundations, <b>died</b> <b>with</b> the bourgeois god that had blessed it.|$|R

5|$|Savoye, {{comparing}} {{the structure of}} Live and Let <b>Die</b> <b>with</b> Casino Royale, believes that the two books have open narratives which allow Fleming to continue with further books in the series. Savoye finds differences {{in the structure of}} the endings, with Live and Let Dies promise of future sexual encounters between Bond and Solitaire to be more credible than Casino Royales ending, in which Bond vows to battle a super-criminal organisation.|$|E

5|$|A 2007–2008 {{survey of}} over 19% of all colonies {{revealed}} {{a total loss}} of 35.8%. Operations that pollinated almonds lost, on average, {{the same number of}} colonies as those that did not. The 37.9% of operations that reported having at least some of their colonies <b>die</b> <b>with</b> a complete lack of bees had a total loss of 40.8% of colonies compared to the 17.1% loss reported by beekeepers without this symptom. Large operations {{were more likely to have}} this symptom, suggesting a contagious condition may be a causal factor. About 60% of all colonies that were reported dead in this survey died without the presence of dead bees in the hive, thus possibly suffered from CCD.|$|E
5|$|This {{landscape}} {{gave him}} assurance. A fair field holding life. It was {{the religion of}} peace. It would die if its timid eyes were compelled to see blood.... He threw a pine cone at a jovial squirrel, and he ran with chattering fear. High in a treetop he stopped, and, poking his head cautiously from behind a branch, looked down {{with an air of}} trepidation. The youth felt triumphant at this exhibition. There was the law, he said. Nature had given him a sign. The squirrel, immediately upon recognizing danger, had taken to his legs without ado. He did not stand stolidly baring his furry belly to the missile, and <b>die</b> <b>with</b> an upward glance at the sympathetic heavens. On the contrary, he had fled as fast as his legs could carry him.|$|E
5|$|Culver first {{appeared}} as Casey Donovan in Boys in the Sand, directed by Wakefield Poole, in 1971. The film {{was an instant}} success and {{is considered one of}} the great classics of male erotic cinema. With the success and celebrity he garnered from the film, Donovan believed that he would be able to cross over into mainstream film. While there were meetings with directors like John Schlesinger and Raymond St. Jacques and talk of casting him in mainstream projects including adaptations of novels by Mary Renault and Patricia Nell Warren, the only film opportunities opened for him were as the star of more erotic films. These included the bisexual porn film Score, The Back Row with George Payne, L. A. Tool & <b>Die</b> <b>with</b> Bob Blount and Richard Locke, The Other Side of Aspen with Al Parker and Dick Fisk, Boys in the Sand II and Inevitable Love, with Jon King and Jamie Wingo. Shortly before his death he starred, heavily intoxicated, in the fisting movie Fucked Up, for Christopher Rage. He also appeared in a number of heterosexual porn films, most notably The Opening of Misty Beethoven where he had a scene with Constance Money.|$|E

5|$|Faced with a numerically superior, {{but less}} {{experienced}} enemy, the Company assumed a defensive position, {{taking care to}} select a battleground that favoured them. They chose a naturally strong position, protected by a swamp which, according to Gregoras, they further enhanced by digging trenches and inundating them with water diverted from the nearby river. The Catalans themselves took up positions on dry ground behind the swamp, arranging themselves in a solid line, but the sources give no further details as to their exact disposition. The Athenian army {{on the other hand}} assembled at Lamia. On 10 March 1311, Walter of Brienne composed his testament there and led his army forth. On the eve of battle, the 500 Catalans in the Duke's service, stricken by conscience, went to him and asked for leave to rejoin their old comrades-in-arms, saying that they would rather die than fight against them. Walter reportedly gave them permission to leave, replying that they were welcome to <b>die</b> <b>with</b> the others. At the same time, however, the Catalans' Turkish auxiliaries took up a separate position nearby, thinking the quarrel was a pretext arranged by the Company and the Duke of Athens to exterminate them.|$|E
5|$|On House's insistence, {{neurologist}} Dr. Eric Foreman (Omar Epps) and Cameron {{break into}} Adler's house {{to find anything}} that might account for Adler's symptoms. They find an opened package of non-kosher ham in Adler's kitchen. House concludes that Adler is suffering from cysticercosis due to eating undercooked pork; when the tapeworm inside of her reproduced, its larvae were absorbed into her blood stream, infesting her brain. Adler, wishing to <b>die</b> <b>with</b> dignity, refuses to accept more treatments unless {{there is evidence that}} the diagnosis is correct, but House attempts to persuade her otherwise. During the conversation, Adler asks for the cause of the limp in House's right leg. House reveals he had an infarction in his thigh muscles that led to muscle death, which could have been avoided if his doctor had made the correct diagnosis. House is ready to dismiss the case when Chase provides an idea for noninvasive evidence of Adler's tapeworm infection; by taking an X-ray of her leg, House proves that Adler is infested with tapeworms and her condition is treatable. After seeing the evidence, Adler agrees to take her medication to kill the tapeworms. A couple of days later, Adler is visited by all 16 of her kindergarten children and their other teacher, whom she welcomes with open arms.|$|E
