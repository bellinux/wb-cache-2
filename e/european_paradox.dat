That's why the authors suggest the most appropriate and effective modalities to ensure that the results of the research can be absorbed by the economic and social world to become innovations. The aim is to enable companies to become more competitive and to the public administration to become more efficient.

40|$|A {{substantial}} and still {{growing body of}} research tries to link different psychological models and chronic diseases, with special emphasis on cardiovascular disease. These efforts have established several conceptual bridges that connect psychological alterations and psychosocial factors to the risks, onset and prognosis of cardiovascular disease. However, several different models have been suggested. Depression and learned helplessness are two central psychological models that have been shown to have major explanatory power in the development of chronic diseases. In this respect the so called Central-Eastern <b>European</b> health <b>paradox,</b> that is the morbidity and mortality crisis in these transforming societies can be regarded as a special experimental model. In this review chronic stress is proposed as an integrating theory that can be applied to different psychological models. Chronic stress and allostatic load has been shown to lead to typical pathogenetic results in animal experiments. Chronic stress theory is applicable to the explanation of the suddenly changing patterns of premature mortality rates in transforming societies. Literature and the different models in the field of psychology, behavioural sciences, and epidemiology are reviewed in terms of the chronic stress theory. The applicability of these results are investigated for further research, clinical and policy implications...|$|R

This strategy relies firstly on the identification of stakeholders and communication flows. To grasp the complexity of the topics we construct a first information system and then we propose to enrich this information system so that it could allow the analysis, the validation and the organization of the information exchanges, in order to create attitudes and behaviours in favour of general interest. So, this decision-making information system could be a socio- organizational support of communication, based on systemics. This theoretical choice permits one to approach the transverse structure and the multidimensional conception of the decision-making information system...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Europe is {{perceived}} to be lagging behind the US in converting its academic results into economic outcomes. Using new survey data on European and US technology transfer offices (TTOs), we find that differences in academic research, TTO staff and experience explain to a great extent the gap between the US and Europe {{in terms of the number}} of license agreements concluded. However, these factors account for only part of the difference in license income. We relate the difference in licensing income to differences in the organization and staffing of TTOs. Our analysis reveals that US TTOs do not attach more importance to generating revenue as an objective than their European counterparts. However, they employ more staff with experience in industry which explains some of the remaining differential in license income performance.

40|$|This paper discusses, first, the {{properties}} of scientific and technological knowledge and the institutions supporting its generation and its economic applications. The evidence continues to support the broad interpretation which we call the "Stanford-Yale-Sussex" synthesis. Second, such patterns bear important implications {{with respect to the}} so-called "European Paradox", i. e. the conjecture that EU countries play a leading global role in terms of top-level scientific output, but lag behind in the ability of converting this strength into wealth-generating innovations. The bottom line is that European weaknesses reside both in its system of scientific research and in a relatively weak industry. The final part of the work suggests a few normative implications: much less emphasis should be put on various types of "networking" and much more on policy measures aimed to both strengthen "frontier" research and strengthen European corporate actors.

30|$|If we {{recall a}} recent event in France in 2010, similar {{arguments}} are activated in Ana’s story as those reverberating in this event, where escalating conflicts between Roma and police in camps in Grenoble and Saint Aignan led the French {{government to take}} a decision on expelling all Roma from France due to alleged “sources of smuggling, shocking living conditions, prostitution and crime.” [27] The French expulsion illustrates clearly the EU <b>European</b> citizen making <b>paradox.</b> The Roma who were deported from France were formally European citizens, with the rights it guarantees – including the right of free movement.

A comparison between paradoxes and legal decision-making situations reveals that law in fact suffers from paradoxophilia. The problem posed by legal decision-making situations is structurally identical to the problem posed by paradoxes. A diagnosis of paradoxophilia and the insight into {{the structure of the}} disease determines the therapy. Legal methodologies are supposed to guide the decision-making process.

40|$|The European {{approach}} to immigration is traditionally {{characterized by a}} sort of “schizophrenia”, generated by the attempt to keep together two contradictory philosophies: the “economicistic” philosophy on which the system of entry (and stay) is regulated and the philosophy of solidarity and equal opportunities. To overcome this paradox, three major changes are necessary, which constitute the challenges addressed by the DIVERSE – Diversity Improvement as a Viable Enrichment Resource for Society and Economy – project, conducted in 10 European countries and whose results are presented in the volume: shifting from the perception of migrants as contingently instrumental resources to the conception of their human capital as a structural resource for {{the economic and social}} development of European societies; promoting a wider awareness, among different types of organizations (profit, non-profit and public), of the importance and potentialities of Diversity Management strategies; improving the social participation and the civic and voluntary engagement of Third Country Nationals in view of the construction of an inclusive European society and in order to change the common perception of immigrants as people needing to be helped and assisted. Finally, it is only through the active involvement of different stakeholders and the implementation of different types of actions that {{it will be possible to}} achieve the ambition of “reinventing” the European {{approach to}} immigration, to overcome the <b>European</b> historical <b>paradox</b> and benefit from the “Diversity Value”...|$|R
40|$|Using {{a sample}} of SMEs from 28 European countries, this study evaluates the input and output {{additionality}} of national and EU R&D programmes both separately and in combination. Accordingly, we contribute to understanding the effectiveness of policy mix, in this case of innovation policy {{from the perspective of}} multi-level governance. Empirical results are quite different for innovation inputs and innovation outputs. For innovation inputs, we found positive treatment effects from both national and EU programmes separately as well as complementary effects for firms supported from both sources relative to firms supported only by national programmes. For innovation outputs, we report no evidence of additionality from national programmes and cannot reject crowding out from EU programmes. However, crowding out from EU support is eliminated by combination with national support. These findings have policy implications for the governance of R&D policy and suggest that the <b>European</b> <b>Paradox</b> – success of EU support in promoting R&D inputs but not commercialisation – is not yet mitigated...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{a strategy of}} economic convergence for Europe. European principles and ideals require convergence, but the pan-European economic policy of “labor market reform ” imposes divergence, {{in the hope that}} greater inequality in European pay will bring Europe closer to the dynamism and employment performance of the United States. We resolve this <b>European</b> <b>paradox</b> by showing that in fact the (inter-regional) pay structure of the United States is substantially more egalitarian than Europe; convergence toward American inequality levels will therefore require the systematic reduction of inter-regional pay differentials across Europe. We present quantitative targets for a strategy of egalitarian growth and pay convergence across the regions of Europe through 2042, the fiftieth anniversary of the Maastricht treaty. A theoretical section explains why such a strategy, following the experience of the American New Deal, should work to reduce the scourge of European unemployment. This is a preliminary version of a paper under preparation for the Friedrich Ebert Stiftung. It will be published in Europe by the FES following comments and revisions, and is forthcoming in its present form from the Levy Economics Institute.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the Hungarian aspects {{and the latest}} results of the so-called Eastern <b>European</b> health <b>paradox</b> in terms of (micro-) regions. In particular, this paper aims at highlighting the spatial correlations of premature mortality and the {{main causes of death}} by gender as well as their socio-economic and spatial embeddedness. The tool for our study is represented by exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) : the main health inequalities of Hungary’s micro-regions are described with the use of global autocorrelation tests as well as regression models suitable for the identification of general and spatial features. According to our findings, the causes of premature death are characterised by a marked spatial determination for both genders but mostly for men. The regression models of the causes of premature death have confirmed that neighbourhood relations and micro-regional inequalities in issues like the level of socio-economic development, settlement structure, lifestyle, social capital, healthcare infrastructure or social deprivation have substantial impacts on mortality in a given area in the case of men. These findings are also true for women, except for one issue: neighbourhood assimilation. It should be noted in view of our research findings that, in addition to socio-economic explanatory factors, spatiality (belonging to a region) is a major explanatory factor regarding the micro-regional inequalities of premature mortality. In particular, Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén county, known as a former industrial base, should be noted here; this county is a significant and complex crisis area with regard to the health status of both genders in Hungary today. As a short-term measure for the improvement of spatial health status, the development of health awareness and the mitigation of psychosocial stress (by civil organisations) are suggested...|$|R
30|$|As {{one of the}} CEE countries, Romania {{experienced}} {{its lowest}} low fertility rate of 1.27 in 2002 (World Bank 2017) and has maintained relatively low levels of period fertility ever since. The fertility levels are low yet this is despite the traditional context of family formation encouraging the reproductive behaviour. Firstly, Romanians highly value being married and having their own family, perceiving childbearing as both a moral duty and a means of personal fulfilment (Rotariu 2006). Secondly, the mean ages at marriage and childbirth are low (though on the increase) compared to other <b>European</b> countries. This <b>paradox,</b> that emerged {{after the collapse of}} the Communist regime, is similar to that of Ukraine, Russia, Bulgaria, and Hungary, which have received far more attention in terms of explaining the country-specific factors associated with fertility behaviour (Billari et al. 2009; Perelli-Harris 2005, 2006; Philipov et al. 2006). Although the family formation paradox is similar, Romania departs from the other CEE countries by displaying the slowest development towards modernity and post modernisation, thus placing it among the most culturally traditional societies in Eastern Europe (Voicu 2008, p. 299). Therefore, understanding how Romanians decide to have children and what are the most relevant predictors of first- and second-order parity intentions complements the existing research on the former socialist countries.|$|R
40|$|Coronary {{artery disease}} (CAD) {{mortality}} and morbidity {{is present in}} the European continent in a four-fold gradient across populations, from the South (Spain and France) with the lowest CAD mortality, towards the North (Finland and UK). This observed gradient has not been fully explained by classical or single genetic risk factors, resulting in some cases in the so called Southern <b>European</b> or Mediterranean <b>paradox.</b> Here we approached population genetic risk estimates using genetic risk scores (GRS) constructed with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) from nitric oxide synthases (NOS) genes. These SNPs appeared to be associated with myocardial infarction (MI) in 2165 cases and 2153 controls. The GRSs were computed in 34 general European populations. Although the contribution of these GRS was lower than 1 % between cases and controls, the mean GRS per population was positively correlated with coronary incidence explaining 65 – 85 % of the variation among populations (67 % in women and 86 % in men). This large contribution to CAD incidence variation among populations might be a result of colinearity with several other common genetic and environmental factors. These results are not consistent with the cardiovascular Mediterranean paradox for genetics and support a CAD genetic architecture mainly based on combinations of common genetic polymorphisms. Population genetic risk scores is a promising approach in public health interventions to develop lifestyle programs and prevent intermediate risk factors in certain subpopulation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} <b>European</b> <b>Paradox</b> {{according}} to which Europe plays a leading world role in terms of scientific excellence, {{measured in terms of}} the number of publications, but lacks the entrepreneurial capacity of the U. S. to transform this excellent performance into innovation, growth, and jobs. Citation distributions for the U. S., the European Union (EU), and the rest of the world are evaluated using a pair of high- and low-impact indicators, as well as the mean citation rate. The dataset consists of 3. 6 million articles published in 1998 - 2002 with a common five-year citation window. The analysis is carried at a low aggregation level: the 219 sub-fields identified with the Web of Science categories distinguished by Thomson Scientific. The problems posed by international co-authorship and the multiple assignments of articles to sub-fields are solved following a multiplicative strategy. In the first place, we find that, although the EU has more publications than the U. S. in 113 out of 219 sub-fields, the U. S. is ahead of the EU in 189 and 163 sub-fields in terms of the high- and low-impact indicators. In the second place, we verify that using the high-impact indicator the U. S. /EU gap is usually greater than when using the mean citation rate.

40|$|During {{the past}} decade, the {{competitiveness}} {{and economic growth}} of the of the EU fell significantly {{below the level of}} its greatest economic competitor, the USA (EC [2004]). In the meanwhile, the Far-Eastern global economic region performed variously, mostly influenced by the economic performance of the two other major global economic blocks. So the EU announced to make efforts to increase its pace of growth and he level of employment, especially focusing on supporting innovation (EC [2000]). Though the integration of the economic systems {{has been going on for}} decades (the Economic and Monetary Union), its effects fell far behind the expected level. However another factor emerged from the economic reality: the so called <b>European</b> <b>Paradox</b> (Cresson-Bangemann [1995])., according to whichthe results of RTDI activities are a lot less utilized than in the USA, despite the large number of excellent European results published. One of the main causes of this phenomenon could be, that the innovation system in the EU is more in the state sector. And presumably this is responsible for a significant part of the missing European economic growth. Mapping the innovation system, scholars identified an important element of the knowledge utilization processes: the spin-off enterprise. EU policy makers decided to promote their operation by constructing a suitable legal environment for their existence, and help their creation and operation by other possible means. However for this cause, the situation needed to be surveyed. The European Commission supported the work of a research consortium on the INDICOM project, which conducted an international survey of high-tech spin-off enterprises and the technology transfer organizations (TTOs), which “gave birth” to them. These results will be analyzed in this present article...|$|E

40|$|More {{than thirty}} years, after the {{metamorphosis}} of the cruise industry from an expensive type of vacation for the elite to an affordable alternative {{for the mass}} market, cruise shipping records high rates of growth. The Greek cruise market has been liberalized since 1999, when the Regulation of the European Commission 3577 / 92 came into force, allowing cruise ships flying European flags to operate in Greek waters and to use national ports as homeports. Restrictions were in force only for the non EU flagged cruise ships until 2010, when the Greek Government voted the National Law 3872 / 2010, which liberalized the market. Until the 1990 s Greek companies were pioneers and very active in the international market. However, lately the shrinking of the Greek market is observed. Today, {{there is only one}} Greek Cypriot company with just two vessels under the Greek flag. At the same time Greece, according to the European Cruise Council (ECC, 2011) data, is among the top three most popular <b>European</b> destinations. The <b>paradox</b> is that only a slight percentage of cruise companies select Greek ports for home porting. The paper gives an overview of the Greek cruise industry, the cruise cabotage reform, focusing especially on the process and the different opinions expressed by the stakeholders.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{inspired}} {{by the notion that}} {{over the last two decades}} the knowledge development process has been changing. The dichotomy between basic and applied research is disappearing and knowledge is increasingly recognised as a driver of economic growth and as a resource to solve societal challenges. As a result the science system is transforming and the attention of policymakers on the role of knowledge within society increases. Policymakers, however, tend to overlook the complexity of research policy, copying best practices in research policy from one field to another. These measures can be expected to fail since scientific fields exhibit distinct and localised dynamics that respond differently to government intervention. This thesis aims to empirically validate the changes in the knowledge development process and draw implications for science policy. The medical devices sector is used as a case study. Due to aging of the population, the pressure on healthcare is increasing. The development of new medical devices is seen as an important way to increase the productivity of the healthcare professionals and thereby relieving the pressure on the system. In the Netherlands the Innovative Medical Devices Initiative (IMDI) was launched to stimulate this development. However, the nature of the research process this initiative attempts to stimulate is unexplored. To analyse the changes in the knowledge development process this thesis builds on the search regime concept of Bonaccorsi (2004), which is “a summary description of the growth pattern of scientific knowledge and the actual carrying out of scientific research” in a field (p. 2). Analysing the medical devices’ search regime will point out which of the changes in the knowledge development process described in innovation literature have an empirically recognisable counterpart and which factors should be considered when developing science policy. This thesis uses bibliometric analysis to analyse the medical devices’ search regime and uses interviews to validate the results. This analysis points out that the knowledge development process is indeed changing. Knowledge development is becoming an ever-more collaborative process at an increasingly international scale. However, academic institutions remain a central position within these networks as institutional environments are only marginally overlapping. In addition this thesis draws policy implications from the search regime and evaluates the IMDI. This thesis concludes that the IMDI attempts to increase multidisciplinarity in the sector to overcome the <b>European</b> <b>Paradox,</b> but fails to take the fundamental role of the institutional features in the knowledge development process into account...|$|E
