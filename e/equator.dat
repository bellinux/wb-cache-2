5|$|The {{abundance}} of methane, ethane and acetylene at Neptune's <b>equator</b> is 10–100 {{times greater than}} at the poles. This is interpreted as evidence for upwelling at the <b>equator</b> and subsidence near the poles.|$|E
5|$|The {{ecliptic}} forms {{one of the}} {{two fundamental}} planes used as reference for positions on the celestial sphere, the other being the celestial <b>equator.</b> Perpendicular to the ecliptic are the ecliptic poles, the north ecliptic pole being the pole north of the <b>equator.</b> Of the two fundamental planes, the ecliptic is closer to unmoving against the background stars, its motion due to planetary precession being roughly 1/100 that of the celestial <b>equator.</b>|$|E
5|$|This adds a {{periodic}} component {{to the position}} of the equinoxes; the positions of the celestial <b>equator</b> and (vernal) equinox with fully updated precession and nutation are called the true <b>equator</b> and equinox; the positions without nutation are the mean <b>equator</b> and equinox.|$|E

5|$|Because Earth's {{rotational}} axis is not perpendicular to its orbital plane, Earth's equatorial plane is not coplanar with the ecliptic plane, but {{is inclined to}} it by an angle of about 23.4°, which {{is known as the}} obliquity of the ecliptic. If the <b>equator</b> is projected outward to the celestial sphere, forming the celestial <b>equator,</b> it crosses the ecliptic at two points known as the equinoxes. The Sun, in its apparent motion along the ecliptic, crosses the celestial <b>equator</b> at these points, one from south to north, the other from north to south. The crossing from south to north is known as the vernal equinox, also known as the first point of Aries and the ascending node of the ecliptic on the celestial <b>equator.</b> The crossing from north to south is the autumnal equinox or descending node.|$|E
5|$|MS is {{more common}} in people who live farther from the <b>equator,</b> {{although}} exceptions exist. These exceptions include ethnic groups that are at low risk far from the <b>equator</b> such as the Samis, Amerindians, Canadian Hutterites, New Zealand Māori, and Canada's Inuit, as well as groups that have a relatively high risk close to the <b>equator</b> such as Sardinians, inland Sicilians, Palestinians and Parsis. The cause of this geographical pattern is not clear. While the north-south gradient of incidence is decreasing, as of 2010 it is still present.|$|E
5|$|The local {{gravitational}} acceleration at the poles {{is greater than}} at the <b>equator,</b> so, by the Von Zeipel theorem, the local luminosity is also higher at the poles. This {{is seen as a}} variation in effective temperature over the star: the polar temperature is near 10,000K, while the equatorial temperature is 7,600K. As a result, if Vega were viewed along the plane of its <b>equator,</b> then the luminosity would be about half the apparent luminosity as viewed from the pole. This large temperature difference between the poles and the <b>equator</b> produces a strong 'gravity darkening' effect. As viewed from the poles, this results in a darker (lower intensity) limb than would normally be expected for a spherically symmetric star. The temperature gradient may also mean Vega has a convection zone around the <b>equator,</b> while the remainder of the atmosphere is likely to be in almost pure radiative equilibrium.|$|E

500|$|Moons are classed in two {{separate}} categories according to their orbits: regular moons, which have prograde orbits (they orbit {{in the direction of}} their planets' rotation) and lie close to the plane of their <b>equators,</b> and irregular moons, whose orbits can be pro- or retrograde (against the direction of their planets' rotation) and often lie at extreme angles to their planets' <b>equators.</b> Irregular moons are probably minor planets that have been captured from surrounding space. Most irregular moons are less than [...] in diameter.|$|R

5|$|The tidal {{effect of}} the planets is weak and does not {{significantly}} affect {{the shape of the}} Sun. The Sun rotates faster at its <b>equator</b> than at its poles. This differential rotation is caused by convective motion due to heat transport and the Coriolis force due to the Sun's rotation. In a frame of reference defined by the stars, the rotational period is approximately 25.6 days at the <b>equator</b> and 33.5 days at the poles. Viewed from Earth as it orbits the Sun, the apparent rotational period of the Sun at its <b>equator</b> is about 28 days.|$|E

5|$|As a {{rotating}} proto-stellar disk contracts {{to form a}} star its shape {{becomes more and more}} spherical, but the contraction doesn't proceed all the way to a perfect sphere. At the poles all of the gravity acts to increase the contraction, but at the <b>equator</b> the effective gravity is diminished by the centrifugal force. The final shape of the star after star formation is an equilibrium shape, {{in the sense that the}} effective gravity in the equatorial region (being diminished) cannot pull the star to a more spherical shape. The rotation also gives rise to gravity darkening at the <b>equator,</b> as described by the von Zeipel theorem.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers such as David Morrison {{argue that}} the galactic <b>equator</b> is an entirely {{arbitrary}} line and can never be precisely drawn, because {{it is impossible to}} determine the Milky Way's exact boundaries, which vary depending on clarity of view. Jenkins claimed he drew his conclusions about the location of the galactic <b>equator</b> from observations taken at above , an altitude that gives a clearer image of the Milky Way than the Maya had access to. Furthermore, since the Sun is half a degree wide, its solstice position takes 36 years to precess its full width. Jenkins himself noted that even given his determined location for the line of the galactic <b>equator,</b> its most precise convergence with the center of the Sun already occurred in 1998, and so asserts that, rather than 2012, the galactic alignment instead focuses on a multi-year period centered in 1998.|$|E

5|$|Geography affects {{solar energy}} {{potential}} because {{areas that are}} closer to the <b>equator</b> have a greater amount of solar radiation. However, the use of photovoltaics that can follow {{the position of the}} sun can significantly increase the solar energy potential in areas that are farther from the <b>equator.</b> Time variation effects the potential of solar energy because during the nighttime there is little solar radiation {{on the surface of the}} Earth for solar panels to absorb. This limits the amount of energy that solar panels can absorb in one day. Cloud cover can affect the potential of solar panels because clouds block incoming light from the sun and reduce the light available for solar cells.|$|E

40|$|The Sec {{translocase}} pathway is {{the major}} route for protein transport across and into the cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria. Previous studies reported that the SecA translocase ATP-binding subunit and the cell surface HtrA protease/chaperone formed a single microdomain, termed “ExPortal,” in some species of ellipsoidal (ovococcus) Gram-positive bacteria, including Streptococcus pyogenes. To investigate the generality of microdomain formation, we determined the distribution of SecA and SecY by immunofluorescent microscopy in Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), which is an ovococcus species evolutionarily distant from S.  pyogenes. In the majority (≥ 75 %) of exponentially growing cells, S. pneumoniae SecA (SecASpn) and SecYSpn located dynamically in cells {{at different stages of}} division. In early divisional cells, both Sec subunits concentrated at <b>equators,</b> which are future sites of constriction. Further along in division, SecASpn and SecYSpn remained localized at mid-cell septa. In late divisional cells, both Sec subunits were hemispherically distributed in the regions between septa and the future <b>equators</b> of dividing cells. In contrast, the HtrASpn homologue localized to the <b>equators</b> and septa of most (> 90 %) dividing cells, whereas the SrtASpn sortase located over the surface of cells in no discernable pattern. This dynamic pattern of Sec distribution was not perturbed by the absence of flotillin family proteins, but was largely absent in most cells in early stationary phase and in ∆cls mutants lacking cardiolipin synthase. These results do not support the existence of an ExPortal microdomain in S.  pneumoniae.

5|$|Most {{tropical}} cyclones form in {{a worldwide}} band of thunderstorm activity near the <b>equator,</b> {{referred to as}} the Intertropical Front (ITF), the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), or the monsoon trough. Another important source of atmospheric instability is found in tropical waves, which {{contribute to the development of}} about 85% of intense tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean and become most of the tropical cyclones in the Eastern Pacific. The majority forms between 10 and 30 degrees of latitude away of the <b>equator,</b> and 87% forms no farther away than 20 degrees north or south. Because the Coriolis effect initiates and maintains their rotation, tropical cyclones rarely form or move within 5degrees of the <b>equator,</b> where the effect is weakest. However, it is still possible for tropical systems to form within this boundary as Tropical Storm Vamei and Cyclone Agni did in 2001 and 2004, respectively.|$|E
5|$|On December 19, a small {{low-level}} circulation {{was located}} along the northwest coastline of Borneo; {{at the same}} time a plume of cold air progressed southward through the South China Sea on the southeastern periphery of a ridge over the Far East. The vortex drifted southwestward, reaching open water by December 21. The northerly air surge was deflected after interacting with the circulation, and {{at the same time}} a portion of the air surge crossed the <b>equator.</b> The southerly flow turned eastward, then northward, and in combination with the northerly flow it wrapped into the vortex, resulting in rapid development of the low-level circulation, just a short distance north of the <b>equator.</b> By December 25, an area of scattered convection persisted about 370km (230mi) east of Singapore within an area of low wind shear, in association with the low-level circulation. Continuing slowly westward, the convection deepened and organized further, and at 1200UTC on December 26 the disturbance developed into a tropical depression about 230km (145mi) east of Singapore, or 156km (97mi) north of the <b>equator.</b> This was the first recorded occurrence of a tropical cyclone near the <b>equator.</b>|$|E
5|$|Once again, {{this is a}} simplification. Periodic {{motions of}} the Moon and {{apparent}} periodic motions of the Sun (actually of Earth in its orbit) cause short-term small-amplitude periodic oscillations of Earth's axis, and hence the celestial <b>equator,</b> known as nutation.|$|E
