40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of <b>the</b> retailer’s <b>overconfident</b> {{behavior}} on supply chain performance. We start with a basic model on the rational newsvendor model and investigate the retailer’s optimal ordering decision and expected profit. Next, we extend the basic model and introduce an overconfident retailer. We find that <b>the</b> retailer’s <b>overconfident</b> behavior does not necessarily damage the supply chain compared with the basic model when <b>the</b> <b>overconfident</b> level does not exceed a threshold. We also design the cooperation and buyback mechanism and conduct numerical analysis to compare the manufacturer’s and retailer’s expected profits and real profits {{with those in the}} basic newsvendor model. It can achieve Pareto improvement in the supply chain when <b>the</b> <b>overconfident</b> level is low. When <b>the</b> retailer’s <b>overconfident</b> level exceeds a threshold, the retailer’s ordering decision cannot make the whole supply chain sustainable development...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} overconfidence on the timing of entry in markets, profits, and welfare. To do that the paper uses an endogenous timing model where (i) players have private information about costs and (ii) one player is <b>overconfident</b> and <b>the</b> other is rational. The paper shows that for moderate levels of self-confidence there is a unique cost-dependent equilibrium where <b>the</b> <b>overconfident</b> player has a higher ex-ante probability of entering the market before the rational player. In this equilibrium self-confidence reduces the profits of the rational player but can increase the profits of <b>the</b> <b>overconfident</b> player provided that cost asymmetries are small. Finally, we show that overconfidence reduces welfare, except when cost asymmetries are very small. endogenous timing; entry; overconfidence...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{relationship}} between the market overconfidence and occurrence of the stock-prices’ bubbles is investigated. Sixty participants traded in ten experimental markets of the two types: rational and overconfident. Markets are constructed {{on the basis of}} subjects’ overconfidence, measured in the administered pre-experimental psychological test sessions. <b>The</b> most <b>overconfident</b> subjects form <b>overconfident</b> markets, and <b>the</b> least <b>overconfident</b> – rational markets. Empirical evidence presented in the paper refines differences between market outcomes in the experimental treatments and suggests the connection between market overconfidence and market outcomes. Prices in rational markets tend to track the fundamental asset value more accurately than prices in overconfident markets, and are significantly lower and less volatile than <b>the</b> average <b>overconfident</b> prices. Strong positive correlation between market outcomes and overconfidence measures draws conclusion, that an increase in market overconfidence is associated with the increase in average price and trading activity. Large and significant correlation between bubble measures and measures of overconfidence provide additional evidence that overconfidence has significant effect on price and trading behavior in experimental asset markets. ...|$|R

40|$|We analyse {{the effects}} of {{managerial}} overconfidence on financing decisions and firm value when investors face managerial moral hazard. We consider two cases. In the first case, the manager may {{have an incentive to}} exert an inefficiently low level of effort in running the business (‘managerial shirking’). The manager may issue high debt as a commitment device (the increase in expected financial distress drives him to a higher effort level). An overconfident manager overestimates his ability, and underestimates financial distress costs. Therefore, our first model predicts a positive relationship between overconfidence and debt. However, the effect of overconfidence on firm value is ambiguous, and depends which factor (the positive effect of higher effort, or the negative effect of higher debt and higher expected financial distress) dominates. In the second case, the manager has an incentive to use free cash flow to invest in a new pet project that may be value-reducing (the free cash flow problem). In contrast to the first case, overconfidence may result in a decrease in debt (the rational manager knows that the new project is value-reducing and uses high debt to commit not to invest in it, while <b>the</b> <b>overconfident</b> manager perceives <b>the</b> new project as value-increasing, and reduces debt {{in order to make the}} investment). Again, the effect of overconfidence on firm value is ambiguous, since a project that may have been value-reducing under a rational manager may indeed be value-increasing under an <b>overconfident</b> manager, as <b>the</b> <b>overconfident</b> manager exerts higher effort. We conclude our analysis by conceptualising a model of “excessive life-cycle debt sensitivity due to managerial overconfidence” not previously explored in the literature...|$|R

40|$|Everyone knows some {{examples}} in history of major {{mergers and acquisitions}} (M&As). Sometimes they are predictable; other times there is, out of the blue, a press release about a proposed M&A. The M&A announcements often stipulates the benefits. However, research shows that 60 to 80 % of M&As don’t create shareholder value. The reasons for this disappointing score has already been investigated in Anglo-Saxon countries. In a number of studies, it is concluded that M&A decision-making isn’t taken purely rationally, but that behavioral aspects, like overconfidence, play a very important role. Studies show that overconfident CEOs {{are more inclined to}} carry out M&As. The connection between overconfidence and M&A shareholders’ value destruction is also made in previous studies. This kind of data is not immediately available for the European situation and in particular the Dutch situation. Nevertheless, the differences between the Anglo-Saxon and the Rhineland countries are such that M&A decision-making by CEOs can be done in a different way and will result in differences between the Netherlands (Rhineland) and Anglo-Saxon countries. This research attempts to make the connection between CEO overconfidence and shareholder value (change) by Dutch stock listed companies as a result of M&A decisions. Two hypotheses are of importance for answering this research question: firstly, that CEO overconfidence in Dutch companies leads to more M&As and secondly that M&As made by overconfident CEOs negatively affect the shareholder value. To test these hypotheses, data was collected from 26 stock listed companies in the period from 2002 up to and including 2015. To determine CEO overconfidence, two methods have been used. The Longholder method, whereby a CEO is identified as overconfident when they at least once during their tenure, hold an option until the year of expiration, <b>even</b> though <b>the</b> option is at least 40 % in-the-money entering its final year. The second method is the Holder 67 classification, a CEO qualifies as <b>overconfident</b> when <b>the</b> CEO has an option with five years remaining duration despite a 67 % increase in stock price (or more) since the grant date. In order to determine the effects on the shareholders’ value, the cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) were used. This is calculated based on the abnormal returns on the shares of the acquiring company. The analysis of the data reveals that the first hypothesis must actually be adopted. The chance that an overconfident CEO enters into a M&A is greater than the probability of a M&A by a non-overconfident CEO. The odds ratio is 1. 3 and 1. 6 for the Longholder and Holder 67 respectively. The second hypothesis must be rejected. The data in this research show that a majority of M&As are successful in terms of increased shareholder value. In 45 % of the cases there is no added shareholder value. In addition, the average CAR is positive (26 basis points). With regard to <b>the</b> relationship between <b>overconfident</b> CEOs and shareholder value, there is no clear picture from the available data. Based on the statistical tests, there is no significant difference between <b>the</b> <b>overconfident</b> and non-overconfident CEO. It is remarkable that when using the Longholder classification, <b>the</b> <b>overconfident</b> CEO achieves on average a higher CAR relative to his non-overconfident colleague (36 and 20 basis points, respectively). For the Holder 67 classification the non-overconfident CEOs score on average better than <b>the</b> <b>overconfident</b> CEOs (an average CAR of 23 and 9 basis points, respectively). This gives the research interesting differences compared to outcomes of companies in the United States. These differences are a good starting point for further research to sharpen <b>the</b> theory of <b>overconfident</b> CEOs, but also to further improve the theories about the Anglo-Saxon and the Rhineland model...|$|R
