5|$|A non-tropical area of low pressure, first noted {{over the}} Gulf Stream on August7, entered the southeastern Gulf of Mexico and {{organized}} into a tropical depression about 120mi (190km) west of Fort Myers, Florida, by 18:00UTC on August10. As {{the newly formed}} cyclone moved west-northwest, a nearby upper-level low imparted high wind shear and dry air entrainment, and the depression degenerated into a remnant low twelve hours later without attaining tropical storm intensity. Upon degeneration, the low moved <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> Coast of the United States and conducted a clockwise loop. It emerged <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> of Mexico again on August16, where the disturbance nearly regenerated into a tropical cyclone before making a second landfall in Mississippi the next day. The remnants dissipated over the southeastern portion of the state on August18.|$|E
5|$|According to modern-day analysis, a {{tropical}} depression {{developed in the}} Pacific Ocean, south of El Salvador, early on September 27.

5|$|Tropical Storm Norman brought minor {{flooding}} {{to western}} Mexico and record rainfall to areas of Texas in September 2012. The fourteenth tropical cyclone and fourteenth named storm of the 2012 Pacific hurricane season, Norman developed near {{the southern tip}} of Baja California early on September28. Upon developing into a tropical cyclone on September28, Norman attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 50mph (85km/h). Heading northward <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> of California, the storm began to weaken later that day due to southwesterly wind shear and land interaction. Norman curved northwestward and weakened to a tropical depression early on September29. Around that time, it briefly moved inland near Topolobampo, Sinaloa, before re-emerging <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> of California. Later on September29, Norman degenerated into a remnant low pressure area.|$|E

5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after emerging <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> of Mexico on July30, the cloud pattern of system quickly became better organized. Later after emerging <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> of Mexico, ships and satellite images confirmed that Tropical Depression Four had formed offshore {{of the north}} coast of the Yucatán Peninsula; although it was likely that the depression formed 80miles (129km) north of the Yucatán Peninsula several hours earlier than confirmed. The following morning after development occurred, the depression had intensified into a tropical storm 575miles (920km) southeast of Texas; the National Hurricane Center assigned it to the name Chantal. Although it became a tropical storm early that morning, the system was not upgraded to a tropical storm until a reconnaissance flight confirmed tropical storm force winds about six hours later, when sustained winds were already 50mph (85km/h). Tropical Storm Chantal rapidly strengthened thereafter, with weather satellites indicating t–numbers increasing from 2.5to 3.5within twelve hours using the Dvorak technique. Chantal continued to intensify, and headed northwestward at 11mph (18km/h) due to weak ridging over Florida.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Edith rapidly {{weakened}} {{over the}} mountainous terrain of northeastern Central America, and 18 hours after it made landfall, it emerged <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> of Honduras as an 80 mph (130 km/h) Category 1 hurricane. It continued to weaken {{as it moved}} northwestward, and made landfall near Belize City with tropical storm winds of 70 mph (115 km/h). Edith weakened further while crossing the Yucatán Peninsula, and emerged <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> of Mexico near Campeche, Mexico late on September 11 as a minimal tropical storm. Edith initially failed to re-intensify as it moved northwestward, despite low amounts of wind shear and warm waters. This was because an anticyclone over the Gulf was closely connected with Hurricane Fern, which developed and moved over the northwestern portion of the Gulf of Mexico. The anticyclone resulted in an easterly upper-level flow across Edith, creating conditions not conducive for intensification. As Fern moved inland over Texas, the flow became more favorable around Edith, and 36 hours after entering the Gulf of Mexico, the storm began to reintensify slightly.|$|E
5|$|Isaac {{began to}} curve northwestward {{due to its}} {{location}} between a large deep-layer low pressure area in the northwestern Caribbean Sea and a mid-tropospheric ridge over the western Atlantic. After briefly moving <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> of Gonâve, the tropical storm made a second landfall near Cajobabo, Guantánamo, in Cuba at 1500UTC later on August25, where damages were comparatively less severe than in Haiti. The storm paralleled the northern coast of the island prior to making a close pass of Key West, Florida, where it caused minor flood damage across the Florida Keys and South Florida upon entry <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> of Mexico. The threat of tropical cyclone impacts in Tampa forced the postponing of the 2012 Republican National Convention. In the gulf, the tropical storm curved to the northwest and attained hurricane strength on August27 near the southern Louisiana coast. Another ridge of high pressure caused Isaac to move towards the west and slow down as it made two landfalls on the state. Once it moved inland, the hurricane weakened before dissipating over Missouri on September1.|$|E
