5|$|The Drug in Me Is You was speculated by news source Perez Hilton to sell {{anywhere}} from 17,000 to 20,000 copies in the United States {{during its first}} week of sales, placing it close behind predicted debuting chart toppers Eric Church (Chief), Kelly Rowland (<b>Here</b> <b>I</b> <b>Am),</b> and Joss Stone (LP1). The album ended up selling 18,120 copies in its first week in the United States, charting at number 19 on the Billboard 200. This almost exactly matched the first week sales of Escape the Fate (2010), the third album by Radke's former band, though Escape the Fate only charted at number 25, six spots lower than The Drug in Me Is You, despite equal sales. In its second week on sales, The Drug in Me is You dropped about 70% in the United States, selling 5,870 copies. This dropped the album 60 spots to number 79 on the Billboard 200, and brought total US sales for the album to around 24,000 copies.|$|E

5|$|As {{you long}} ago wrote me, {{and told me}} personally, nay predicted, Jackson has thrown me overboard; he is not only unwilling to give me employment, as he promised after I {{declined}} a reelection to Congress, but has in every single instance refused office to my friends, and even respectful consideration to my letters of recommendation to others.

25|$|Marion Elise Ravn (born May 25, 1984), {{known as}} Marion Raven, is a Norwegian singer and songwriter. Raven formed the pop duo M2M with Marit Larsen, though they ceased {{performing}} together in 2002. Raven was later {{signed as a}} solo artist by Atlantic Records {{with the release of}} her solo debut album, <b>Here</b> <b>I</b> <b>Am</b> in 2005. In 2006, Raven was signed to the indie record label, Eleven Seven, and in 2007 re-released the songs on her debut album along with a few new songs on an album titled Set Me Free. In 2012, Raven began production of her second album, Songs from a Blackbird, which was released in Norway on 8 April 2013.|$|E
25|$|Upon signing her {{deal with}} Atlantic Records, Marion Raven set about {{recording}} her debut album, {{and worked with}} Swedish songwriters/producers Max Martin and Rami, as well as Canadian singer-songwriter Chantal Kreviazuk and her husband Raine Maida from 2003 to 2005. Initially, the record company was not confident of Raven's switch to a more rock image and a darker, more personal style of songwriting. Raven had to fight to record her kind of music, rock music with a pop element. The resulting 14-track list, including 2 bonus tracks, cultivated a more rock/pop sound and was titled <b>Here</b> <b>I</b> <b>Am.</b> The album saw Raven's transformation from the candy-pop music of M2M to a more angsty, rock-oriented singer, and was released in Scandinavia, Japan, Latin America and Southeast Asia.|$|E
