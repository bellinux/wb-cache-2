5000|$|There {{are many}} [...] "do it yourself" [...] <b>headlight</b> {{restoration}} kits available for purchase. A {{few of the}} major brands that produce these [...] "kits" [...] include 3M, Turtle Wax, Sylvania, <b>Headlight</b> Wizard, Meguiar's, Mothers, and Rain-X. Most of these kits require multiple stages of wet sanding to remove the oxidation of the <b>headlight</b> lens, usually with descending level of grit (coarse to fine). Some kits include a UV sealant which is said to protect {{the lens of the}} <b>headlight</b> longer. Kits with the UV sealant include some of the 3M, Sylvania, and <b>Headlight</b> Wizard. It should be noted that typically the DIY sealant requires regular periodic reapplication and is not equivalent to the original OEM hardcoat applied during manufacturing. Another common option to delay the aging process of <b>headlight</b> lenses, is the use of press and snap-on <b>headlight</b> covers, or laminates with adhesives that can be applied over the <b>headlight</b> lenses, such as Paint Protection Film sold by 3M.|$|R

2500|$|The most {{important}} design criterion for these curves is <b>headlight</b> sight distance. When a driver is driving on a sag curve at night, the sight distance {{is limited by}} the higher grade in front of the vehicle. [...] This distance must be long enough that the driver can see any obstruction on the road and stop the vehicle within the <b>headlight</b> sight distance. [...] The <b>headlight</b> sight distance (S) is determined by the angle of the <b>headlight</b> and angle of the tangent slope {{at the end of the}} curve. [...] By first finding the <b>headlight</b> sight distance (S) and then solving for the curve length (L) in each of the equations below, the correct curve length can be determined. [...] If the Slength is greater than the <b>headlight</b> sight distance, then this number can be used. [...] If it is smaller, this value cannot be used. [...] Similarly, if the S>L curve length is smaller than the <b>headlight</b> sight distance, then this number can be used. [...] If it is larger, this value cannot be used.|$|R

5|$|Emergency lights may be {{housed in}} special fittings, {{such as in}} a lightbar, or may be hidden in a host light (such as a headlamp) by {{drilling}} {{a hole in the}} host light's reflector and inserting the emergency light. These hidden lights may not be apparent until they are activated. Additionally, some of the standard lights fitted to an ambulance (e.g. headlamps, tail lamps) may be programmed to flash. Flashing <b>headlights</b> (typically the high beams, flashed alternately) are known as a wig-wag.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{students}} from Michigan Technological University solved {{the mystery of}} the Paulding Light, a local phenomenon commonly attributed to paranormal activity. The phenomenon is viewable from a section of Robbins Pond Road, the former routing of US45 in the Paulding area. According to area folklore, and indicated on signs in the viewing area, the light is from the ghost of a railroad brakeman. Other explanations say the light comes from a ghost train from the 1800s. The students' investigation showed that the light comes from <b>headlights</b> of cars on US45 in the Paulding area.|$|E
40|$|In {{high quality}} driving {{simulation}} applications, such as <b>headlight</b> simulation, colorimetric validity is essential. In virtual testing of <b>headlight</b> systems, {{it is important}} that the WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) paradigm is respected for product quality <b>headlight</b> assessment. Indeed, if a slightly reddish orange colour is displayed instead of the typical orange of halogen lighting, the effect for driver comfort or traffic safety can be critical. The lighting specialist should accept a <b>headlight</b> which doesn't have the right colour. Previous studies have shown that there is a significant colour difference between virtual and real environments. Nevertheless, in virtual <b>headlight</b> testing the rendered colour fidelity has to fit industrial assessment. This study therefore deals with the colour-difference perceptibility that is the ability of an observer to detect a difference between two colours and, more precisely, on the acceptability of the perceived difference. We propose in this paper a psychophysical function for colour difference acceptability which fits well with the measured data. The colour acceptability function was implemented in a driving simulator for high validity <b>headlight</b> assessment. Driver acceptability experimentation was carried out using Renault's <b>headlight</b> driving simulation equipped with a fullcab and a 210 Â° cylindrical display screen...|$|R

In the 1950s the railroad added new, larger numberboards and removed the side skirting and the rear diaphragms from most of the locomotives. Other additions included MU receptacles next to the upper <b>headlight</b> and replacing the retractable front couplers with fixed ones.|$|R
50|$|Throughout {{the twentieth}} century, the town's weekly {{newspaper}} was The Terry <b>Headlight.</b> The <b>Headlight</b> was edited in Terry and printed in Crystal Springs {{in the office}} of the Crystal Springs Meteor. Editors of this publication included Mamie Birdsong, Willie Dean Sojourner Brister, Carolyn Booth Patrick, and Elsie Moss Berryhill. Among the columnists were Fanny Dulaney, Dot Champion, and Rev. Ryburn Stancil. The Terry <b>Headlight</b> ceased its publication approximately in 1990.|$|R
5|$|In summary, {{the main}} {{competencies}} of the Tagora were its spacious cabin (though {{it was not}} class-leading), its comfortable seating, its fuel economy (in 2.2 GLS form) {{and the size of}} its luggage compartment (572 litres). But the fact that a car launched in 1974, the Volvo 244 GLE, could offer better seats, disc brakes all round, better <b>headlights,</b> better ventilation and better handling for only slightly more than Talbot was charging for their car indicated that the Tagora had come to market with a vehicle that was uncompetitive in too many major respects.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} American {{self-propelled}} guns produced {{during the early}} World War II period, the prototype was assembled and tested at the Aberdeen Proving Ground. The M2 recoil mechanism {{and other parts of}} the M2 howitzer carriage were used in the vehicle mounting. After several tests, the gun carriage proved fragile on bumpy terrain. The problem was corrected by reinforcing the frame, and redesigning the howitzer mount. Demountable <b>headlights</b> were recommended because of the muzzle blast, although they were not available for early production models. Early models had no shield for the howitzer either, but a foldable shield was added during testing. The gun faced forward, like many other half-track models. The total traverse was 40 degrees and the elevation was from â5 to +35 degrees. The armored windshield cover was remounted so it could fold onto the hood. After further testing, it was accepted for production.|$|E
5|$|For the {{interior}} scenes used {{to depict the}} first moments of the Impala being hit, the actors were required {{to sit in the}} car in front of a blue screen; this allowed for the truck's <b>headlights</b> to later be added in with visual effects. The car itself was attached to a separate rig that was built to replicate the impact of the crash. As the scene was shot, the rig flipped the car onto its side. The passenger-side window was then shattered, though the actors were protected by a sheet of Lexan that had been placed very close to the window; at the same time, cannons beneath the frame blew out pieces of rubber glass to give the appearance that the window had exploded onto them.|$|E

40|$|A {{recent study}} (Cavallo and Pinto, 2012) showed that {{daytime running lights}} (DRLs) on cars create âvisual noiseâ that interferes with the {{lighting}} of motorcycles and affects their visual conspicuity. In the present experiment, we tested three conspicuity enhancements designed to improve motorcycle detectability in a car-DRL environment: a triangle configuration (a central <b>headlight</b> plus two lights located on the rear view mirrors), a helmet configuration (a light located on the motorcyclistâs helmet {{in addition to the}} central <b>headlight),</b> and a single central yellow <b>headlight.</b> These three front-light configurations were evaluated in comparison to the standard configuration (a single central white <b>headlight).</b> Photographs representing complex urban traffic scenes were presented briefly (for 250 ms). The results revealed better motorcycle-detection performance for both the yellow <b>headlight</b> and the helmet configuration than for the standard configuration. The findings suggest some avenues for defining a new visual signature for motorcycles in car-DRL environments...|$|R

5|$|Haynes' Model L was {{his most}} popular vehicle. First {{designed}} in 1905, the three-speed car could travel at 35mph (58km/h) and carry four passengers; the company sold over 4,300. Haynes expanded the company significantly in 1908 to accommodate ever-increasing sales. More stock was issued and more capital raised {{to build a}} new and larger factory. By 1909 the company was producing 650 cars annually with models priced between $2,500 and $5,500. In 1910, Haynes Auto became the first company to build a car with a roof, windshield, <b>headlights,</b> and a speedometer as standard on each vehicle to continue their goal of producing the best luxury vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Intimidator 305 {{features}} two trains themed as Dale Earnhardt's black number 3 car. The trains feature <b>headlights</b> at {{the front}} of each train as well as advertisement stickers that are found on NASCAR cars. One train is red with the other being silver. Each train has eight four-passenger cars, allowing thirty-two passengers per train. The trains are arranged in stadium-style seating with overhead lap bars fitted with soft, padded over-the-shoulder straps. In early July 2010, the ride received a unique new restraint design. The over-the-shoulder part of the harness now resembles a padded seat belt rather than the typical over-the-shoulder restraints used by Intamin.|$|E
5|$|Logging {{remained}} {{a mainstay of}} industry in Missoula with the groundbreaking of the Hoerner-Waldorf pulp mill in 1956, which resulted in protests over the resultant air pollution. An article in Life magazine thirteen years later speaks of Missoulians sometimes needing to drive with <b>headlights</b> on during the day to navigate through the smog. In 1979, still almost 40% of the county's labor income came from the wood and paper products sector. The lumber industry was hit hard by the recession of the early 1980s, and Missoula's economy began to diversify. By the early 1990s, the disappearance {{of many of the}} region's log yards, along with legislation, had helped clean the skies dramatically.|$|E

5|$|New to the Forza {{series is}} a feature known as Autovista. It is {{designed}} to allow players to walk around and explore inside cars. This feature allows players to view minute details such as brake pads, engine components, and interior details. The player can point at certain features, such as <b>headlights,</b> wheels and the engine for further information about them via audio recording. It can be controlled via Kinect or a game controller. Only 24 cars in the game support the Autovista feature, as it is primarily for sports cars, classic cars, and dream cars. The graphics used to create these cars are formed using image-based lighting which allowed the developers to create perfect reflections, and would better immerse {{the car in the}} environment both when racing on a track or in the garage or Top Gear studio when viewing a car.|$|E
5|$|Safety {{features}} on Lexus models range from {{stability and handling}} programs (Vehicle Stability Control and Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management) to backup cameras, swivel <b>headlights,</b> and sonar warning systems. The Lexus Pre-Collision System (PCS) integrates multiple safety systems. In 2007, Lexus introduced the first car safety systems with infrared and pedestrian detection capabilities, lane keep assist, a Driver Monitoring System with facial recognition monitoring of driver attentiveness, and rear pre-collision whiplash protection, {{as part of the}} LS 460 PCS. As a safety precaution, Lexus GPS navigation systems in many regions feature a motion lockout when the vehicle reaches a set speed; to prevent distraction, navigation inputs are limited, while voice input and certain buttons are still accessible. This safety feature has attracted criticism because passengers cannot use certain functions when the vehicle is in motion. Pre-2007 models came with a hidden manufacturer override option, and updated European models allow operation in motion.|$|E
5|$|The Fairmont model {{opened up}} the luxury sector for the BA range. Externally, the Fairmont could be {{distinguished}} from the other BA models with its 16-inch alloy wheels and grey mesh grille with chrome surround. Some of the standard features included traction control and dual-zone climate control air conditioning, an analogue clock on the top centre console stack, wood grain highlights, and velour upholstery. Automatic <b>headlights,</b> which turn off or on depending on surrounding environmental conditions, were now standard on the Fairmont model. In addition to this, the Fairmont also received illuminated footwells. The basic mechanical setup carried over from the XT, although buyers could opt for the Barra 220 V8 engine.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} some experimental investigations {{to study}} the air flow patterns on the <b>headlight</b> domes of different two wheelers (HERO HONDA PASSION PLUS and BAJAJ PULSAR) which influence {{the stability of the}} vehicle. The pressure distribution over the surface of the profile and the drag force are to be determined for various <b>headlight</b> dome orientations. This study helps in suggesting the suitable <b>headlight</b> dome profile that may reduce the drag force and effect of turbulence which in turn leads to the increase of vehicle stability. The results obtained during the simulation are to be validated by conducting the experiments on the scale down model of the <b>headlight</b> dome of HERO HONDA PASSION PLUS using Wind Tunnel test rig. The Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) tool was used to simulate the air flow pattern on the <b>headlight</b> dome in which boundary layer separation doesnât exist. The results obtained from the simulation are to be compared with the experimental results from the wind tunnel and the variation is to be found and that should be in the acceptable limit...|$|R
