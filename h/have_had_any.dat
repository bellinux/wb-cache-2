George's father took him hunting and riding, and introduced him to military matters; mindful of his uncertain future, Ernest Augustus took the fifteen-year-old George on campaign in the Franco-Dutch War with the deliberate purpose of testing and training his son in battle.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, Polish {{paleontologist}} Teresa Maryańska {{proposed that}} the complex sinuses and nasal cavities of ankylosaurs may have lightened {{the weight of the}} skull, housed a nasal gland, or acted as a chamber for vocal resonance. Carpenter rejected these hypotheses, arguing that tetrapod animals make sounds through the larynx, not the nostrils, and that reduction in weight was minimal, as the spaces only accounted for a small percent of the skull volume. He also considered a gland unlikely, and noted that the sinuses may not <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> specific function. It is also been suggested that the respiratory passages were used to perform a mammal-like treatment of inhaled air, based on the presence and arrangement of specialized bones.|$|E

5|$|The {{first people}} to use a romanized script to write Southern Min were Spanish missionaries in Manila in the 16th century. However, it was used mainly as a {{teaching}} aid for Spanish learners of Southern Min, and seems not to <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> influence {{on the development of}} pe̍h-ōe-jī. In the early 19th century, China was closed to Christian missionaries, who instead proselytized to overseas Chinese communities in South East Asia. The earliest origins of the system are found in a small vocabulary first printed in 1820 by Walter Henry Medhurst, who went on to publish the Dictionary of the Hok-këèn Dialect of the Chinese Language, According to the Reading and Colloquial Idioms in 1832.|$|E

5|$|The king again {{employed}} Ealdred as {{a diplomat}} in 1056, when he assisted earls Harold and Leofric {{in negotiations with}} the Welsh. Edward sent Ealdred after the death in battle of Bishop Leofgar of Hereford, who had attacked Gruffydd ap Llywelyn after encouragement from the king. However, Leofgar lost the battle and his life, and Edward had to sue for peace. Although details of the negotiations are lacking, Gruffydd ap Llywelyn swore loyalty to King Edward, but the oath may not <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> obligations on Gruffydd's part to Edward. The exact terms of the submission are not known in total, but Gruffydd was not required to assist Edward in war nor attend Edward's court. Ealdred was rewarded with {{the administration of the}} see of Hereford, which he held until 1061, and was appointed Archbishop of York. The diocese had suffered a serious raid from the Welsh in 1055, and during his administration, Ealdred continued the rebuilding of the cathedral church as well as securing the cathedral chapter's rights. Ealdred was granted the administration in order that the area might have someone with experience with the Welsh in charge.|$|E

40|$|Background This report {{examined}} the association and relationship between Migration, Gender and STIs among young adults in Lesotho. To achieve this, the first {{objective was to}} understand the historical trans-boundary relationship between Lesotho and South Africa and how it contributed to STIs among young adults in Lesotho. The report then described the relationship between migration and <b>having</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> STIs among young adults in Lesotho. After multivariate analysis the association, between gender and <b>having</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> STIs among young adults in Lesotho was explored for understanding. Methodology For data analysis, secondary data from the 2009 Lesotho Demographic Health Survey (LDHS) were used. The LDHS is a cross-sectional study, designed to provide estimates of health and demographic indicators at the national level, for urban-rural areas and for each of the ten districts in Lesotho. The sample size used for this report was N= 6, 270. The statistical methods employed for data analysis were descriptive analysis, to establish the distribution of young adult migrant groups, according to STIs, demographic, socioeconomic and sexual practices. A Chi-square test was done to test for association. And a multivariate analysis was done using the forward selection process, to examine the relationships between STIs, migration, gender and significant variables. Results Migration status was found to <b>have</b> an insignificant (p= 0. 237) association with STIs. On the other hand, after considering migration status and gender at multivariate level, migration status, specifically urban-non migrants, were found to <b>have</b> a significant (p< 0. 05) relationship with <b>having</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> STIs. Gender was found to <b>have</b> an insignificant (p= 0. 587) association with <b>having</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> STIs and an insignificant (p= 0. 365) relationship with <b>having</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> STIs.
