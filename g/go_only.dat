5|$|Lesions can be transverse, {{occurring}} {{between the}} rings of the trachea, longitudinal or spiral. They may occur along the membranous {{part of the}} trachea, the main bronchi, or both. In 8% of ruptures, lesions are complex, occurring {{in more than one}} location, with more than one type of lesion, or on both of the main bronchi and the trachea. Transverse tears are more common than longitudinal or complex ones. The laceration may completely transect the airway or it may <b>go</b> <b>only</b> partway around. Partial tears that do not go {{all the way around the}} circumference of the airway do not allow a lacerated airway to become completely detached; tears that encircle the whole airway can allow separation to occur. Lacerations may also be classified as complete or incomplete. In an incomplete lesion, a layer of tissue surrounding the bronchus remains intact and can keep the air in the airway, preventing it from leaking into the areas surrounding the airways. Incomplete lacerations may require closer scrutiny to detect and may not be diagnosed right away.|$|E

He wanted to be a true Jagadguru (Jagad = World + guru= Teacher). Thus He found discontentment in these projects and is cited as His chief reason to relinquish the title.|$|E

Elvis agreed to all these demands and Priscilla flew to Los Angeles.

25|$|The Coppermine Expedition sailed from Gravesend on 23 May 1819 on a Hudson's Bay Company supply ship, {{after three}} months of planning, and {{immediately}} hit a note of farce. The ship had stopped briefly off the Norfolk coast, where George Back had business to attend to, but before he had returned a favourable wind blew up and the ship sailed off, leaving Back to make his own way to their next stop in Orkney by stagecoach and ferry. A more serious problem arose in Stromness when the expedition, now reunited with Back, attempted to hire local boatmen to act as manhaulers for {{the first part of the}} trek across Canada. The people of Stromness were far less keen to sign up than the navy had anticipated, and only four men were recruited, and even they agreed to <b>go</b> <b>only</b> as far as Fort Chipewyan on Lake Athabasca.|$|E
25|$|In {{the week}} {{preceding}} the race London experienced {{a series of}} riots; several football matches were called off, but the London–Surrey Cycle Classic was allowed to proceed. On race day British riders Liam Holohan, Kristian House and Tom Murray and Brazil's Cleberson Weber opened up a 6-minute gap in the breakaway before the peloton started to pull them back on the final Box Hill climb. 2009 British road race champion House won the King of the Mountains award. The lead quartet were {{swept up in the}} final 9kilometres as Great Britain and England controlled the pace. Kurt Asle Arvesen then made a bid for the win before being brought back. With 12kilometres to go, Tyler Farrar suffered a puncture. After chasing furiously he reached the peloton with 2kilometres to <b>go,</b> <b>only</b> to see his chance of the win wiped out as a crash occurred; according to Heinrich Haussler it was caused by two riders fighting. The crash split the peloton and in a group of just 20 riders Mark Cavendish beat Sacha Modolo of Italy and France's Samuel Dumoulin in a sprint finish on the Mall.|$|E

25|$|In {{the wildest}} and largest ninth-inning {{comeback}} win all season, the Cardinals {{at home on}} August 8, scored all five of their runs {{in the bottom of}} the ninth after two outs, for a 5-4 win. Previously, the team was an awful 2-45 when trailing after eight innings. The team fell into a 0-4 hole, and were 0-for-11 with runners in scoring position. It was the 10th time in the last 15 games that a starter could not get to the sixth inning. Down to his last strike at 1-2, Brandon Moss got the tying run in with a bases-loaded walk, and Yadier Molina then finished off the improbable comeback win by getting hit in the ribs by a pitch. The Cardinals have won three of the last four Major League games to end on a walk-off hit-by-pitch. It happened most recently for St. Louis on Aug. 14, 2014, when Jon Jay took a pitch off his body. That was also against the Reds. With the win, the team got its 59th win against 53 losses, tying the Miami Marlins for the second Wild Card spot with 50 games remaining in the season. Michael Wacha could <b>go</b> <b>only</b> five innings, as the fifth starter in a week to not get to the sixth inning.|$|E

Chaney and Slezak both gave it an [...] "A−": the former remarked that she [...] "knows how to make the emotion in a song soar", and the latter said [...] "damn if she didn't sound amazing", though he pointed out the incongruity of Rachel having just stated after Rory's song that uptempo and jolly is the way to <b>go,</b> <b>only</b> to sing this song, which is anything but.

500|$|Visitors to the Stonewall Inn in 1969 {{were greeted}} by a bouncer who {{inspected}} them through a peephole in the door. The legal drinking age was 18, and to avoid unwittingly letting in undercover police (who were called [...] "Lily Law", [...] "Alice Blue Gown", or [...] "Betty Badge"), visitors {{would have to be}} known by the doorman, or look gay. The entrance fee on weekends was $3, for which the customer received two tickets that could be exchanged for two drinks. Patrons were required to sign their names in a book to prove that the bar was a private [...] "bottle club", but rarely signed their real names. There were two dance floors in the Stonewall; the interior was painted black, making it very dark inside, with pulsing gel lights or black lights. If police were spotted, regular white lights were turned on, signaling that everyone should stop dancing or touching. In the rear of the bar was a smaller room frequented by [...] "queens"; it was one of two bars where effeminate men who wore makeup and teased their hair (though dressed in men's clothing) could <b>go.</b> <b>Only</b> a few transvestites, or men in full drag, were allowed in by the bouncers. The customers were [...] "98 percent male" [...] but a few lesbians sometimes came to the bar. Younger homeless adolescent males, who slept in nearby Christopher Park, would often try to get in so customers would buy them drinks. The age of the clientele ranged between the upper teens and early thirties, and the racial mix was evenly distributed among white, black, and Hispanic patrons. Because of its even mix of people, its location, and the attraction of dancing, the Stonewall Inn was known by many as [...] "the gay bar in the city".|$|E

2500|$|Estimates of {{the number}} of {{religious}} men killed vary greatly. One estimate is that of the 30,000 priests and monks in Spain in 1936, 13% of the secular priests and 23% of the monks were killed, amounting to 6800 religious personnel altogether. Some 283 women religious were killed, some of them badly tortured. 13bishops were killed from the dioceses of Siguenza Lleida, Cuenca, Barbastro, Segorbe, Jaén, Ciudad Real, Almeria, Guadix, Barcelona, Teruel and the auxiliary of Tarragona.
