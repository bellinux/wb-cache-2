Shortly afterward, the aircraft crashed on 22 February, killing the observer, when flutter developed in the elevator and the subsequent vibrations caused the entire tail to break off. Construction of the production models was suspended until the reasons for the accident were discovered. Engineering and wind-tunnel tests revealed that the geometry of the rear fuselage and the engine exhaust created flutter-inducing turbulence that was aggravated by the high-frequency acoustic energy from the <b>exhaust.</b> <b>Fixes</b> for the problem involved the addition of a [...] "jet wake fairing" [...] at the bottom rear of the fuselage between the engines, external ("ice tong") mass balances for the elevator, pending the design of internal mass balances, and the addition of exhaust deflectors to the fuselage to reduce the turbulence and the consequent flutter.|$|R

50|$|Both {{slide and}} piston valves have the {{limitation}} that intake and <b>exhaust</b> events are <b>fixed</b> {{in relation to}} each other and cannot be independently optimised. Lap is provided on steam edges of the valve, so that although the valve stroke reduces as cutoff is advanced, the valve is always fully opened to exhaust. However, as cutoff is shortened, the exhaust events also advance. The exhaust release point occurs earlier in the power stroke and compression earlier in the exhaust stroke. Early release wastes some energy in the steam, and early closure also wastes energy in compressing an otherwise unnecessarily large quantity of steam. Another effect of early cutoff is that the valve is moving quite slowly at the cutoff point, and this causes 'wire drawing' of the steam, another wasteful thermodynamic effect visible on an indicator diagram.|$|R

The success of implementation of photovoltaic (PV) power project is increased when PV module system is integrated with building design process {{and is used}} as multi purpose appliance for use with building elements. The improvement in overall system efficiency of building integrated PV modules embedded in building fa√ßade is achieved by minimizing and capturing energy losses. A novel solar energy utilisation technology for generation of electric and thermal power is presented by integration of ventilation and solar photovoltaic device with the heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) system. The testing appliance named as photovoltaic duct wall was a wooden frame assembly of double wall with air ventilation: two adjacent glass coated PV modules, air column, plywood board filled with polystyrene and dampers. The measurement data is collected from various sensors to read measurements of solar intensity, ambient air temperature, room air temperature, electric power, surface temperatures of PV modules and plywood board, air velocities and air temperatures in the air column. The enhancement in the air velocity of the air column is fulfilled with an <b>exhaust</b> fan <b>fixed</b> in an outdoor room.

40|$|Objectives: Reported {{associations}} of self-employment with occupational injury and cerebrovascular disease suggest that worker {{safety and health}} precautions may vary by occupational status. The authors assessed {{the extent to which}} use of respiratory protection and ventilation equipment is associated with self-employed versus employee status among adults in an international study. Methods: The European Community Respiratory Health Survey II (ECRHS II) is a follow-up study conducted in a population-based random sample of adult ECRHS I participants. Men and women enrolled in the ECRHS II completed interviewer-administered questionnaires to provide information about their occupational status and job history during the 9 -year ECRHS follow-up period. Respondents in selected occupational groups completed supplemental questionnaires about their jobs and use of respiratory protection and ventilation equipment on-the-job. The authors assessed self-reported use of respiratory and ventilation equipment among 72 self-employed and 371 employed adults in metalworking, soldering and welding occupations. Results: Local <b>exhaust</b> ventilation (<b>fixed</b> extraction: OR 0. 37, 95 % CI 0. 17 to 0. 80; mobile extraction: OR 0. 23, 95 % CI 0. 09 to 0. 60; on-tool extraction: OR 0. 39, 95 % CI 0. 18 to 0. 88) was reported less frequently among self-employed respondents than among employed respondents. The magnitude of the negative association between self-employment status and any of the three types of local exhaust ventilation was not attenuated by adjustment for duration of work per day or week or asthma and/or wheezing symptoms. Respiratory protection was not associated with employment status in these data. Conclusions: More limited use of local exhaust ventilation among self-employed workers compared to employees suggests the need to promote occupational safety among self-employed workers. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{presents}} {{design and}} control of active mufflers used in engine exhaust systems. Boundary element method is employed to investigate noise attenuation performances of various active muffler structures. Based on these performance evaluations, an active muffler having only one loudspeaker inclined at 45 degree with the muffler centerline is constructed and tested for active noise control (ANC). The feedback ANC with two controller tuning algorithms, the filtered-x least m an square (FXLMS) algorithm and Godart modified algorithm, is applied independently for ngine exhaust noise attenuation. Experimental investigation reveals that feedback ANC with FXLMS algorithm can attain an averaged 23. 6 dB noise attenuation for pure tone excitation and over 6 dB noise reduction for motorcycle and automobile exhaust noises. It is also shown that feedback ANC with Godart modified algorithm has faster transient response compared to FXLMS algorithm for a pure tone noise, but has inferior noise attenuation capabilitythan the FXLMS algorithm for the engine <b>exhaust</b> noise at <b>fixed</b> speeds (about 5 dB noise reduction) as well as during run-up tests...|$|R

The Navier-Stokes equations, with a reaction term, are solved in one dimension. The time integration is a one-dimensional adaptation of an existing two-dimensional finite volume method code. An iterative scheme, based on an overlap integral, is developed for {{the determination of the}} deflagration to detonation transition. The code is tested in a number of cases, where the analytical solution (to the Euler equations) is known. The location of the deflagration to detonation transition is displayed graphically through the preheat zone temperature {{as a function of the}} fuel mixture temperature, for <b>fixed</b> <b>exhaust</b> gas temperature and with the preheat zone length as a parameter. The evolution of the deflagration to detonation transition is investigated for an initial state well within the regime where the deflagration to detonation transition occurs.

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal International Journal of Thermal Technologies and is available at [URL] It appears here with the kind permission of the publisher. Thermal management of aircraft heat loads is quickly becoming a limiting factor of vehicle performance and reliability. This paper details improvements in forced-convection cooled avionic module heat removal efficiency {{with the implementation of}} two-phase high thermal conductivity Vapour Chamber Heat Spreaders (VCHS). A bespoke test rig provides experimental thermal comparisons of an aluminium and embedded VCHS avionic heat exchanger. The experimental results validate a numerical thermal resistance network, which is utilised to simulate more representative avionic chassis geometries. The VCHS dramatically reduces thermal variation in circuit card and avionic heat exchanger exhaust temperatures. Increased isothermalisation of the heat exchanger greatly increases effective heat transfer area in comparison to a traditional aluminium chassis. The VCHS acts as a very effective thermal buffer between the avionic circuit cards and coolant airflow, allowing a more predictable avionic thermal behaviour irrespective of circuit card architecture. The improved heat rejection capability allows either a substantial increase in avionic growth capacity (increased power output for a <b>fixed</b> <b>exhaust</b> temperature) or a substantial reduction in mass flow rate (reduced demand on vehicle thermal management system). An avionic growth capacity of up to 58 % is achieved with representative thermal loading conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{usage of}} OPEFB biomass as an {{alternative}} source for renewable energy such as biochar has a great potential to overcome the shortage of fossil fuel. Moreover, the utilization of biomass {{as a source of}} biofuel can reduce the problem of environmental pollution particularly on the issues related to greenhouse gases. Being the second largest oil palm producer in the world, Malaysia has a great potential to produce clean renewable energy from biomass. The selfsustained carbonization was proposed and tested in this study, whereby oil palm biomass itself was combusted to provide heat for self-carbonization in inadequate oxygen without electrical heating element. In the first chapter, the reviews on the literature pertaining Malaysia palm oil industry, current carbonization technologies, proposed self-sustained carbonization to produce biochar and the objectives of this study have been discussed. In the second chapter, the temperature profiles and gaseous emission concentration during self-sustained carbonization of empty fruit bunch biomass in a pilot scale reactor (30 kg capacity) at different particles sizes (100 - 150, 30 - 99 and less than 29 mm) was evaluated. For self-sustained carbonization with natural exhausted gas flow rate, the maximum temperatures ranging 417 - 580 oC at all particle sizes were tested and found to be suitable for biochar production. The average concentration of CO 2, CO and CH 4 released during the carbonization process were between 2. 8 - 4. 1, 0. 38 - 0. 51 and 0. 17 - 0. 26 %, respectively. For self-sustained carbonization with <b>fixed</b> <b>exhausted</b> gas flow rate, the maximum temperatures were slightly similar when compared to self-sustained carbonization with natural exhausted gas flow rate which was between 493 - 564 oC at all particle size tested. The average concentration of CO 2, CO and CH 4 released during the carbonization process were between 3. 65 - 5. 59, 0. 56 - 0. 72 and 0. 29 - 0. 39 %, respectively. SO 2 and HCl were not detected while NOx and particulate matter, (PM 10) were well below permitted level set by the Department of Environment, Malaysia for both natural and <b>fixed</b> <b>exhausted</b> gas flow rate. Gaseous pollutant in this study can be considered low and the self-sustained carbonization process was environmental friendly when compared to other studies using same palm oil biomass carbonization. In the third chapter, the effect of exhausted gas flow rate and OPEFB biomass particle sizes on biochar yield and quality in a pilot scale (30 kg capacity) reactor under self-sustained carbonization were evaluated. For self-sustained carbonization with natural exhausted gas flow rate, harvesting carbonization temperature of < 500 oC of OPEFB biomass at the particle size ranging from 100 - 150 mm produced the highest biochar yield and CV between 23 - 25 % and 22. 6 - 24. 7 MJ/kg, respectively. The carbonization retention time was between 790 - 893 min and less compared to other particle sizes tested. This particle size, without further size reduction, is needed to reduce the energy requirement at production line. For self-sustained carbonization temperature with <b>fixed</b> <b>exhausted</b> gas flow rate, the OPEFB biochar yield at particle size 100 - 150 mm produced the highest yield (25 - 27 %), harvested at carbonization temperature of < 500 oC compared to other particle sizes in the same condition. Moreover, this yield was also high as compared to self-sustained carbonization with natural exhausted gas flow rate. The CV were found between 23. 0 - 24. 4 MJ/kg which were also comparable with other studies. The carbonization retention time between 280 - 462 min were found less when compared to natural exhausted gas flow rate which contributed to high yield. More consistent result can be achieved under self-sustained carbonization temperature with <b>fixed</b> <b>exhausted</b> gas flow rate but energy required from the usage of exhaust gas blower. In this study, as the carbonization harvesting temperature decreased, the biochar yield decreases, the carbonization retention time increased. In the fourth chapter, self-sustained carbonization of pressed-shredded and whole bunchOPEFB in large scale pool type reactor (3000 kg) from the development of YAMASEN oven (Shimane) were successfully adopted and tested. The pressed-shredded OPEFB was found suitable to be carried out under an open carbonization system while closed carbonization system was preferable for whole bunch OPEFB. The maximum self-sustained carbonization temperature were ranged 583 - 695 oC for pressed-shredded and bunch OPEFB biomass. In terms of CV, large scale biochar production for open and closed system under self-sustained carbonization produced in between 21. 9 - 24. 3 and 19. 6 - 22. 9 MJ/kg, respectively which is comparable to small scale biochar production. In the fifth chapter, the energy balance and potential energy saving of raw and biocharOPEFB (pressed-shredded and whole bunch) in a scaled-up pool type self-sustained carbonization reactor (3 tones capacity) was evaluated. The ratio energy output/input for pressedshredded biochar, whole bunch biochar and raw pressed-shredded OPEFB briquette were positive which were 12, 15 and 8 respectively. Whole bunch biochar is still the highest ratio energy output/input biochar production although without pressed-shredder machine process step resulting in more energy produced than energy consumed. Briquetting raw pressed-shredded without carbonization process step also showed viable energy produced, however drying step with moisture below than 10 % is required. In conclusion and remarks, the self-sustained carbonization was successfully materialized, producing high yield and comparable CV in a small scale followed by scaling-up production of OPEFB biochar. This proposed system is preferable to the industry due to its simplicity, ease of operation and low energy requirement. ‰πùÂ∑ûÂ∑•Ê•≠Â§ßÂ≠¶ÂçöÂ£´Â≠¶‰ΩçË´ñÊñá Â≠¶‰ΩçË®òÁï™Âè∑:ÁîüÂ∑•ÂçöÁî≤Á¨¨ 236 Âè∑ Â≠¶‰ΩçÊéà‰∏éÂπ¥ÊúàÊó•:Âπ≥Êàê 27 Âπ¥ 3 Êúà 25 Êó• 1.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the exhaust gas turbocharger on nano-scale Particulate Matter (PM) number emissions from a Gasoline Direct Injected (GDI) engine is investigated at <b>fixed</b> <b>exhaust</b> gas dilution ratio for a matrix of three engine speeds and four engine load operating points. Experimental repeatability is assessed {{by means of the}} Coefficient of Variation (CoV) from three independent measurements for every test point. A hypothesis test on the difference between total number count before and after the turbine shows that there are statistically relevant variations for most operating points. A reduction in PM total number count at low load is observed, and an increment at high load. It is conjectured that as fuel injection pressure and duration increase with load, a larger share of volatile particulate matter is produced, which then undergoes nucleation as the exhaust gas expands through the turbine. At the same time, the centrifugal action within the turbocharger is believed to promote particle agglomeration and growth, and fragmentation of micro-scale particles. Experiments with variable dilution ratio at a fixed engine test point show that changes in dilution ratio affect repeatability of the emissions measurements only marginally. Yet, a hypothesis test on the variation of total number count with dilution shows that PM number counts are systematically affected by changes in dilution ratio. Furthermore, a hypothesis test also shows that the impact of the turbocharger on total number emissions is statistically relevant regardless of the dilution ratio adopted...|$|R
40|$|Buoyancy-driven natural {{ventilation}} in ventilation shafts is investigated {{with a small}} scale physical experiment within a duct and CFD simulations of an office building. For a <b>fixed</b> <b>exhaust</b> opening, smaller shafts lead to higher flow rates in upper floors of a multi-storey building with a shared ventilation shaft. These higher flow rates are caused by increased vertical momentum within the smaller shafts that induce flow through upper floors, an effect {{referred to as the}} ‚Äúejector effect‚Äù. In the small scale duct, a 0. 5 m by 0. 5 m shaft leads to a slight reverse flow of 0. 0029 m[superscript 3]/s through the upper floor. Holding all other parameters constant and reducing the shaft to 0. 25 m by 0. 5 m leads to a positive flow rate of 0. 012 m[superscript 3]/s through the upper floor. In the CFD simulations of a three storey office building, this same pattern is observed. A 3 m by 2 m shaft leads to a flow rate of 0. 0168 m[superscript 3]/s through the third floor, while the reduced shaft of 2 m by 2 m leads to a flow rate of 0. 766 m[superscript 3]/s through the same floor. This increased airflow rate from the ejector effect can allow {{natural ventilation}} to be used in buildings where it may otherwise have been deemed inappropriate. Most airflow network models neglect air momentum and fail to account for the ejector effect. To improve these models, an empirical model is incorporated into the airflow network model CoolVent in a manner easily transferable to most airflow network models. Hulic Co., Ltd...|$|R
40|$|In {{heavy duty}} Diesel engines more than 50 % {{of the fuel}} energy is not {{converted}} to brake power, but is lost as heat. One promising way to recapture a portion of this heat and convert it to power is by using thermodynamic power cycles. Using the heavy duty Diesel engine as the waste heat source, this paper evaluates and compares the thermodynamic potential of different working fluids in four power cycles: the Rankine cycle (RC), the transcritical Rankine cycle (TRC), the trilateral flash cycle (TFC) and the single flash cycle (SFC). To establish the heat input into the cycle, operating conditions from an actual heavy duty Diesel engine are used as boundary conditions for the cycle heat source. A GT-Power model of the engine was previously developed and experimentally validated for the stationary points in the European Stationary Cycle (ESC). An energy analysis of this engine revealed that it has four heat sources {{with the potential for}} waste heat recovery: the charge air cooler (CAC), the coolant flow, the exhaust gas recirculation cooler (EGRC), and the <b>exhaust</b> flow. Using <b>fixed</b> heat input conditions determined by the selected engine operating mode, the TFC performed best for the CAC with a net power increase of around 2 kW, while the RC performed best for the coolant flow, with a net power increase of 5 kW. For the EGRC, ethanol performed especially well with both the RC and TRC, leading to an 8 kW net power increase. When using the exhaust as heat source, all four cycles provided a power output of around 5 kW with some variation depending on the working fluid. This study shows that for most cases, considering the different heat sources, the choice of cycle has a larger impact on the cycle performance than the choice of working fluid...|$|R
40|$|Is there a {{correlation}} between productivity and product variety? Certainly {{it appears that the}} rich countries are more productive and have more product variety than the poor nations. In fact, the relationship is quite strong when measured in levels. Does this same correlation hold up when measured in growth rates? If so, can poor countries imitate the success of the rich? Addison provides theoretical and empirical reasons to believe the answer to both questions is yes. Recent economic theory suggests that rising variety in factor inputs can help avoid diminishing marginal returns. Product variety can also sustain learning-by-doing which would otherwise be <b>exhausted</b> in a <b>fixed</b> number of products. Finally, invention or imitation adds to the stock of non-rival knowledge. There have been only two previous empirical tests of the correlation between growth in product variety and productivity growth. Both were affirmative but neither examined a wide range of developing countries and neither looked deeper to test what might drive product variety. This research is based on a cross-country sample of 29 countries (13 rich and 16 poor). The data display a statistically significant and positive relationship between growth in product variety and productivity growth when condition on other variables such as research and development (R&D) employment, macroeconomic stability, and domestic security. These results are robust to the addition and subtraction of various explanatory variables but fragile with respect to an influential data point for Venezuela. Industrial nations tend to generate most of their productivity gains through R&D employment in a stable environment that results in better production processes and product quality. In contrast, the largest source of productivity growth in developing countries is product variety imitation while instability takes away from productivity. Addison tests various explanations for growth in variety. The results show that nations furthest from the frontier of observable variety tend to imitate fastest, with the ability to imitate being improved by educational attainment and by productivity gains. This could be a source of hope for small, less developed nations. Growth in market size was not correlated with growth in variety, though {{this may be due to}} a rather short sample period of only eight years. In addition to the empirical testing, Addison also contributes to a general discussion of measurement concepts and measurement issues related to product variety and sets out an agenda for further research.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 43 - 45). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The {{purpose of this study was}} to quantitatively evaluate hood leakage by measuring face velocity and turbulence during a volume generating process designed to simulate a hot process, defined here as any operation producing high temperature gases. A hot process has been recognized as a causal factor in the leakage of contaminants from laboratory fume hoods since 1950. A literature search reveals that during the last couple of decades only Johnson et al. reported a quantitative linear relationship between thermal loading and breathing zone trace gas concentrations using the ASHRAE 110 - 1995 method. Hot processes may well be the most common and least recognized of the operational factors able to cause fume hoods to leak. For hood performance testing, I conducted smoke tests and face velocity tests. Smoke tests were executed by means of smoke tubes and smoke matches as screening tools for hood leakage. Face velocity tests were conducted at 16 points arranged to represent equal areas of the hood face when the sash was fully opened. Face velocity data were indexed in time and space and used to estimate turbulence. By assuming corresponding samples were collected simultaneously, turbulence parameters were computed as both spatial and temporal averages of the velocity pressure. Turbulence is represented by the ratio of the standard deviation to average face velocity at each measurement point. Turbulence is generated by pressure differences occurring between the velocity pressure at the hood face and the volume generating rate that simulates a hot process. Through the average face velocity and turbulence measurements, I found that at a <b>fixed</b> <b>exhaust</b> flow, with a fixed injection volume flow, turbulence is stronger in the open sash position than in the reduced sash position. Further, turbulence associated with a volume generating process is more evident in the space-based data than in the time-based data. Face velocity at each point tends to decrease in a hood when the flow injected by a volume generating process increases. These data suggest that when a hood is operated with a volume generating process, leakage can be minimized by reducing the sash opening, by not positioning any object within six inches of the hood face, and by keeping face velocities stable...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{contains}} {{a summary of}} the holdup and material control and accountability (MC&A) assays conducted for the determination of highly enriched uranium (HEU) in the deactivation and decommissioning (D&D) of Building 321 -M at the Savannah River Site (SRS). The 321 -M facility was the Reactor Fuel Fabrication Facility at SRS and was used to fabricate HEU fuel assemblies, lithium-aluminum target tubes, neptunium assemblies, and miscellaneous components for the SRS production reactors. The facility operated for more than 35 years. During this time thousands of uranium-aluminum-alloy (U-Al) production reactor fuel tubes were produced. After the facility ceased operations in 1995, all of the easily accessible U-Al was removed from the building, and only residual amounts remained. The bulk of this residue was located in the equipment that generated and handled small U-Al particles and in the exhaust systems for this equipment (e. g., Chip compactor, casting furnaces, log saw, lathes A & B, cyclone separator, Freon{trademark} cart, riser crusher, [...] . etc). The D&D project is likely to represent an important example for D&D activities across SRS and across the Department of Energy weapons complex. The Savannah River National Laboratory was tasked to conduct holdup assays to quantify the amount of HEU on all components removed from the facility prior to placing in solid waste containers. The U- 235 holdup in any single component of process equipment must not exceed 50 g {{in order to meet the}} container limit. This limit was imposed to meet criticality requirements of the low level solid waste storage vaults. Thus the holdup measurements were used as guidance to determine if further decontamination of equipment was needed to ensure that the quantity of U- 235 did not exceed the 50 g limit and to ensure that the waste met the Waste Acceptance Criteria (WAC) of the solid waste storage vaults. Since HEU is an accountable nuclear material, the holdup assays and assays of recovered residue were also important for material control and accountability purposes. In summary, the results of the holdup assays were essential for determining compliance with the Waste Acceptance Criteria, Material Control & Accountability, and to ensure that administrative criticality safety controls were not exceeded. This paper discusses the {gamma}-ray assay measurements conducted and the modeling of the acquired data to obtain measured holdup in process equipment, <b>exhaust</b> components, and <b>fixed</b> geometry scrap cans.
