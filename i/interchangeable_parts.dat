5|$|The United States {{has been}} a leader in {{technological}} innovation since the late 19th century and scientific research since the mid-20th century. Methods for producing <b>interchangeable</b> <b>parts</b> were developed by the U.S. War Department by the Federal Armories {{during the first half of}} the 19th century. This technology, along with the establishment of a machine tool industry, enabled the U.S. to have large scale manufacturing of sewing machines, bicycles and other items in the late 19th century and became known as the American system of manufacturing. Factory electrification in the early 20th century and introduction of the assembly line and other labor saving techniques created the system called mass production.|$|E
5|$|Although {{by the end}} of 1837 the Arms Company {{had made}} over 1,000 weapons, there were no sales. Following the Panic of 1837, the company's {{underwriters}} were reluctant to fund the new machinery that Colt needed to make <b>interchangeable</b> <b>parts,</b> so he went on the road to raise money. Demonstrating his gun to people in general stores did not generate the sales volume he needed, so with another loan from his cousin, Selden, he went to Washington, D.C., and demonstrated it to President Andrew Jackson. Jackson approved of the gun and wrote Colt a note saying so. Presidential approval in hand, Colt pushed a bill through Congress endorsing a demonstration for the military, but failed to obtain an appropriation for military purchase of the weapon. A promising order from the state of South Carolina for fifty to seventy-five pistols was canceled when the company did not produce them quickly enough.|$|E

25|$|Whitney is {{most famous}} for two {{innovations}} which later divided the United States in the mid-19th century: the cotton gin (1793) and his advocacy of <b>interchangeable</b> <b>parts.</b> In the South, the cotton gin revolutionized the way cotton was harvested and reinvigorated slavery. In the North {{the adoption of}} <b>interchangeable</b> <b>parts</b> revolutionized the manufacturing industry, and contributed greatly to the U.S. victory in the Civil War.|$|E
25|$|The machinists' {{skills were}} called armory {{practice}} and the system eventually {{became known as the}} American system of manufacturing. Machinists from the armories eventually spread the technology to other industries, such as clocks and watches, especially in the New England area. It wasn't until late in the 19th century that <b>interchangeable</b> <b>parts</b> became widespread in the U.S. manufacturing. Among the items using <b>interchangeable</b> <b>parts</b> were some sewing machine brands and bicycles.|$|E

25|$|In 1851 at the Crystal Palace Exhibition {{the term}} American system of {{manufacturing}} {{was used to}} describe the new approach that was evolving in the United States of America which was based on two central features: <b>interchangeable</b> <b>parts</b> and extensive use of mechanization to produce them.|$|E
25|$|The {{experience}} of the War of 1812 led the War Department to issue a request for contract proposals for firearms with <b>interchangeable</b> <b>parts.</b> Previously, parts from each firearm had to be carefully custom fitted; almost all infantry regiments necessarily included an artificer or armorer who could perform this intricate gunsmithing. The requirement for <b>interchangeable</b> <b>parts</b> forced forward the development of modern metal-working machine tools, including milling machines, grinders, shapers and planers. The Federal Armories perfected the use of machine tools by developing fixtures to correctly position the parts being machined and jigs to guide the cutting tools over the proper path. Systems of blocks and gauges were also developed to check the accuracy and precision of the machined parts. Developing the manufacturing techniques for making <b>interchangeable</b> <b>parts</b> by the Federal Armories took over two decades; however, the first interchangeable small arms parts were not made to {{a high degree of}} precision. It wasn't until mid century or later that parts for U.S. rifles and handguns could be considered truly interchangeable with a degree of precision. In 1853 when the British Parliamentary Committee on Small Arms questioned gun maker Samuel Colt, and machine tool makers James Nasmyth and Joseph Whitworth, there was still some question about what constituted interchangeability and whether it could be achieved at a reasonable cost.|$|E

25|$|In this period, the United States rapidly {{expanded}} economically from an agrarian nation into {{an industrial}} power. Industrialization in America involved two important developments.

25|$|Eli Whitney {{has often}} been {{incorrectly}} credited with inventing the idea of <b>interchangeable</b> <b>parts,</b> which he championed for years as a maker of muskets; however, the idea predated Whitney, and Whitney's role in {{it was one of}} promotion and popularizing, not invention.

25|$|The {{impact of}} machine tools during the Industrial Revolution {{was not that}} great because other than firearms, {{threaded}} fasteners {{and a few other}} industries there were few mass-produced metal parts. The techniques to make mass-produced metal parts made with sufficient precision to be interchangeable is largely attributed to a program of the U.S. Department of War which perfected <b>interchangeable</b> <b>parts</b> for firearms in the early 19th century.|$|E
5000|$|Multispindle lathes {{have more}} than one spindle and {{automated}} control (whether via cams or CNC). They are production machines specializing in high-volume production. The smaller types are usually called screw machines, while the larger variants are usually called automatic chucking machines, automatic chuckers, or simply chuckers. Screw machines usually work from bar stock, while chuckers automatically chuck up individual blanks from a magazine. Typical minimum profitable production lot size on a screw machine is in the thousands of parts due to the large setup time. Once set up, a screw machine can rapidly and efficiently produce thousands of parts on a continuous basis with high accuracy, low cycle time, and very little human intervention. (The latter two points drive down the unit cost per <b>interchangeable</b> <b>part</b> much lower than could be achieved without these machines.) ...|$|R
