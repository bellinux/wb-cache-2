40|$|Whether or not fishers {{comply with}} {{regulation}} {{depends on the}} economic and social context in which they operate their vessels. This is how conventional theory explains the phenomenon of non-compliance. It treats state-community interaction processes not as direct causes for non-compliance but rather as background conditions shaping individual fishers' perception and decisions for action. This paper argues that conventional theory fails to include the dynamics of tempo-relational processes between state and communities, which explains collective patterns of non-compliance in fisheries. The paper addresses this <b>hiatus</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature,</b> using a process-sociological approach to analyse non-compliance in Vietnamese marine fisheries. The analysis highlights that Vietnamese marine fisheries are mainly regulated through informal networks of trust and mistrust, which function through their interplay with the highly centralised and formalised Vietnamese state. Based on this assessment, the paper concludes that outcomes of processes of the dynamic social interplay between state and communities are semi-dependent on individual perception and action, and as such have a causal effect of their own on patterns of non-compliance in fisheries.

40|$|With {{regards to}} {{end-of-life}} care, there is scant published research that looks specifically at {{the provision of}} pallative care services for indigenous people. In addition, for indigenous people in the rural and remote areas there is only limited literature {{that focuses on the}} problems associated with geography. To address the <b>hiatus</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> on Aboriginal, rural and remove pallative care, the following article provides findings from a two year research project, funded by Australia National Health and Medical Research Council (NH&MRC), which developed an innovative model for indigenous pallative care. The data was collected through a qualitative methodology (descriptive phenomenology) which involved open-ended in depth interviews, audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed. The sub-set of findings from the study presented in this paper examine issues in relation to the many practical obstacles in relation to pallative care service provision to indigenous people in the rural and remote areas. The findings are a testament to the ingenuity and dedication of those who provide end-of-life care for Aboriginal peoples in rural and remote locations. The information about the many obstacles associated with equipment, power, transport, distance and telephone access provide important insights to inform the development of health policy planning and funding. The topic is specifically relevant to nurses as further findings from the study indicate that clinic and community nurses are key health professionals providing care to indigenous people in the rural and remote areas...|$|E

40|$|With {{social media}} usage {{increasingly}} widespread and influential, companies {{face the challenge}} of inspiring and cultivating Consumers’ Online Brand-Related Activities (COBRAs). This dissertation argues that they can do so effectively only when they have a good understanding of consumers’ willingness to engage with brands on social media. Academic research on this matter, however, is scarce. Instead of adding to the already substantial body of effect-oriented studies, this research therefore considers more deeply the question of what determines and motivates COBRAs. In doing so, it provides practical insights into how to inspire consumers’ engagement with brands on social media and fills an important <b>hiatus</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> academic <b>literature</b> on marketing, branding, and consumer behavior...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{extensive}} consideration {{the notion of}} informed consent has heralded <b>in</b> recent decades, <b>the</b> unique considerations pertaining to the giving of informed consent by and on behalf of Indigenous Australians have not been comprehensively explored; to the contrary, these issues have been scarcely considered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> to date. This deficit is concerning, given that a fundamental premise {{of the doctrine of}} informed consent is that of individual autonomy, which, while privileged as a core value of non-Indigenous Australian culture, is displaced in Indigenous cultures by the honouring of the family unit and community group, rather than the individual, as being at the core of important decision-making processes relating to the person. To address <b>the</b> <b>hiatus</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bioethical <b>literature</b> on issues relating to informed consent for Aboriginal peoples, the following article provides findings from a two-year research project, funded by Australia's National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), conducted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Northern Territory. <b>The</b> findings, situated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> context of <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> on cultural safety, highlight the difference between the Aboriginal and biomedical perspectives on informed consent.

40|$|Viviparity, a live-bearing mode of reproduction, {{has evolved}} over 100 times {{independently}} in vertebrate animals. Despite its frequent evolution, viviparity {{has a number of}} hypothesised disadvantages compared to the ancestral mode of reproduction, oviparity (egg-laying). One of these disadvantages is a reduction in locomotor performance during pregnancy, the period of internal development of the embryos. Adaptations to a live-bearing reproductive mode could have evolved to reduce these locomotor costs. In this thesis, I aim to find whether matrotrophy, post-fertilization nutrient provisioning (e. g. through a placental structure), and superfetation, the presence of multiple broods of different developmental stages, reduce the locomotor performance decline during pregnancy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Poeciliidae, live-bearing fishes. In Chapter 2, we review <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> on <b>the</b> effects of pregnancy on morphology, performance and fitness. The biomechanics of each mode of locomotion (walking, swimming or flying) are distinct, and are affected differently by the added mass and volume of pregnancy. Furthermore, we list the possible adaptations that have evolved to reduce the locomotor costs of pregnancy, and divide them into three different categories: adaptations that reduce the locomotor costs of live-bearing, adaptations with which the locomotor costs of live-bearing are avoided, and adaptations to the life history of the animal. Lastly, we discuss <b>hiatuses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> and experimental procedures to quantify the hypothesised benefit of adaptations. In Chapter 3, we compare the morphological changes during pregnancy in two closely-related species of live-bearing fish: Poeciliopsis turneri and Poeciliopsis gracilis. These species mainly differ in their mode of nutrient provisioning: P. gracilis is lecithotrophic and P. turneri is an extensive matrotroph. We tracked <b>the</b> morphological changes <b>in</b> 3 D using a non-invasive method that creates three-dimensional body models. We find that P. turneri is more slender during the early stages of pregnancy, but increase in size more rapidly. This is <b>in</b> line with <b>the</b> locomotor costs hypothesis, which predicts that matrotrophic fish are more slender during the early stages of pregnancy, but that the difference between the body shapes of lecithotrophic and matrotrophic fish diminishes as pregnancy progresses. Our results indicate that matrotrophy could indeed provide a morphological advantage during pregnancy. Fast-start performance, a manoeuvre fish deploy to escape predatory strikes, is important for individual survival. In Chapter 4, we use state-of-the-art biomechanical methods to, for the first time, quantify this manoeuvre in three-dimensional space in adult fish (Heterandria formosa). We show that fish can orient their escapes in up- and downwards direction, and that this is correlated with a change in pitch angle of <b>the</b> body. Changes <b>in</b> roll angle of the body were not correlated with orientation of the fish. We furthermore demonstrate that stage 1 of the fast start, often described as a preparatory stage, can already contribute to propulsion. The results from Chapter 4 indicate that three-dimensional measurements of fast-start manoeuvres provide novel insights that were often overlooked. Measuring fast starts in three-dimensional space is relevant <b>in</b> determining <b>the</b> adverse effects of pregnancy on locomotor performance. We did this by comparing three species of live-bearing fish: P. turneri, H. formosa and Phalloptychus januarius. In Chapter 5, we show that pregnancy-induced changes in abdominal width are correlated with a reduction <b>in</b> performance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> horizontal plane (maximal horizontal speed, change in yaw angle), but less so <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vertical plane (maximal vertical speed, change in pitch angle). Furthermore, we demonstrate that an increase in abdominal width is correlated with a decrease in abdominal curvature and, for some species, in a decrease in maximal curvature rate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> abdomen. Lastly, we show that the pregnancy-induced morphological changes depend on the level of superfetation: species {{with a high level of}} superfetation experience higher frequency, but smaller amplitude changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shape of the abdomen. Whether superfetation actually results in a more slender body shape, as predicted by the locomotor costs hypothesis, depends on the level of reproductive investment. In this thesis, I show that pregnancy induces changes in morphology which comes with a cost in fast-start performance. Both matrotrophy and superfetation affect how body shape changes due to pregnancy, but whether the latter provides beneficial changes depends on the level of reproductive investment. Furthermore, I reveal that fast starts can have a substantial three-dimensional component which is relevant both to biomechanicists that aim to understand the physical and physiological mechanisms underlying this manoeuvre and to evolutionary biologists that strive to answer performance-related questions...|$|R
40|$|A {{vast amount}} of {{research}} in mathematics education has shown that students of different ages have a strong tendency to apply linear or proportional models anywhere, even in situations where they are not applicable. For example, in geometry {{it is known that}} many students believe that if the sides of a figure are doubled, the area is doubled too. History of science also provides several cases of thinkers who inadequately postulated linear relations to describe situations. This article focuses on secondary school students’ over-reliance on linearity in physics. Now and then, science educators report students’ tendency to assume and impose linear relations in physics, but – {{as far as we know}} – no substantial efforts were undertaken to study this phenomenon in a systematic empirical way. To fill up this <b>hiatus</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> science education <b>literature,</b> we report in this article on an empirical investigation aimed at identifying the competence of 8 th- and 11 th-graders – before and after being taught the relevant physical topics – to qualitatively grasp situations in physics, as well as their tendency to quantify linearly that qualitative insight. The results provide an ambivalent picture of students’ overuse of linearity in physics: although linear reasoning is sometimes used as a default strategy, even after instruction that addresses the relevant physical contents, this study also indicates that context is taken more into account than is suggested by research on mathematical problem solving. ...|$|R
40|$|This project aims {{to address}} a <b>hiatus</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{academic}} <b>literature</b> on <b>the</b> analysis of data collected {{with the use of}} Public Participation Geographical Information Systems. The research question was: How can geographical data gathered among citizens through the use of PPGIS be turned into information that is valuable <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spatial planning process? PPGIS is defined as the intention of providing all stakeholders in spatial decision-making processes with equal access to the data and analytical capabilities provided through geographical information technology. As such, the role of PPGIS in spatial planning processes {{can be seen as a}} form of communication technology. One of <b>the</b> main obstacles <b>in</b> this exchange of information is <b>the</b> variation <b>in</b> knowledge of <b>the</b> stakeholders on the spatial issue at hand. <b>The</b> focus <b>in</b> this research is on the analysis of the experiences of citizens for use in participatory spatial planning processes. 	First, a structured approach for the analysis of PPGIS data was developed. Appropriate analytical tools were assigned to each section of the approach. For the empirical part of the project data was collected on the experiences of citizens <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area of Hoensbroek in Heerlen. A PPGIS application was developed for data collection through use of a spatial survey. <b>The</b> issues addressed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> survey were decided upon <b>in</b> cooperation with <b>the</b> spatial planning department of the Heerlen municipality. The method for the analysis of PPGIS data was then applied to the collected data. As <b>the</b> data <b>in</b> this research was collected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of polygons instead of points, a procedure was also developed to prepare <b>the</b> data <b>in</b> such a way that the analyses could yield meaningful results. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> end the PPGIS cycle was completed almost in its entirety, with the development of a PPGIS application and associating questionnaire, the collection of data among citizens and the translation of that data into information through spatial analysis and visualization. 	Representatives of the spatial planning department of the Heerlen municipality reported that they found the analyses that yielded information that was readily interpretable and provided concrete directions for spatial policies especially useful, i. e. the heat maps, the cluster analysis and the conflict analysis...|$|R
