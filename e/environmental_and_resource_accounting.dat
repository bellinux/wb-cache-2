40|$|Abstract. The World Bank has {{recently}} published a {{comprehensive study of}} <b>environmental</b> <b>and</b> <b>resource</b> <b>accounting,</b> covering 103 countries (World Bank 1997 a). The study concludes that many Sub-Saharan, Northern African and Middle East countries have had negative ‘genuine ’ saving rates over the last 20 years and therefore fail to pass the test of weak sustainability. This paper argues that the Bank’s conclusions depend on a method for computing user costs from resource exploitation that is challenged by two competing ones (the ‘El Serafy’-method and the method of Repetto et al.) and is inferior to one of its rivals. Resource rents are re-computed using the ‘El Serafy’-method for 14 countries and the Sub-Saharan and Northern African and Middle East regions. The results are that both regions and almost all countries either stop exhibiting signs of unsustainability or their unsustainability can be explained without having recourse to resource accounting. However...|$|E

40|$|The {{negative}} effects of human activity on the natural environment {{are becoming more and}} more apparent. The problems are all complex and rewire changes in many areas of life,. from policies ro projects to individual behavior. Envyromental accounting is one of the possible tools that can encourage a move toward more sustainable development. Gross domestic product (GDP), figures are being widely used by economists, politicians and the media. But often, they are used without the caveat that they represent "insustainable income" where they neglect the degradation of the natural asset base and view the sale of nonrenewable resources entirely as income. The paper describes the state of art in the field of <b>environmental</b> <b>and</b> <b>resources</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>and</b> suggests that further work is needed in order to properly <b>account</b> for natural <b>resources</b> <b>and</b> the environment and thereby help to direct us toward a more sustainable path of development.

40|$|Both the System of Integrated Environment and Economic Accounting (SEEA) <b>and</b> the <b>Environmental</b> <b>and</b> Natural <b>Resources</b> <b>Accounting</b> Project (ENRAP) are {{efforts to}} expand {{conventional}} national economic accounts {{in order to}} better reflect interactions between the market economy and the natural environment. In order to maintain a close relationship to the System of National Accounts (SNA) accounting standards, SEEA adopts conventional definitions of productive sectors and attempts to minimize the use of imputations. As a result, SEEA fails to account for many valuable services of the natural environment and encourages the use of techniques that provide misleading and poor estimates of depreciation and damage the environment. This paper develops a theory of environmental accounting drawing on principles from the environmental economic literature. This theoretical framework underlies the ENRAP approach and provides a basis for constrasting ENRAP and SEEA analytically. Using Philippine data, SEEA-type estimates are compared with those of ENRAP.

40|$|Abstract: Today, the {{consequences}} of human intervention in the environment are more evident than any time before. Development has been synonymous with the nature and environment protection and in economic indexes of national accounts, such as gross domestic product, taking natural <b>and</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>resources</b> into <b>account</b> is so important. Energy is a basic need for economic development and providing welfare and comport for human life. Regarding what was said, {{the only way to}} human is using new clean green and renewable energies. Therefore in this study, in addition to a brief introduction on hydrogen energy and cell battery, the condition of these kinds of renewable energies in Iran will be discussed...|$|R

40|$|In the {{implementation}} of the EC Water Framework Directive, the concept of <b>environmental</b> <b>and</b> <b>resource</b> costs applies above all to the cost recovery of water services. Article 9 of the Directive stipulates that „Member States shall take account of the principle of recovery of the costs of water services, including <b>environmental</b> <b>and</b> <b>resource</b> costs. “ However, <b>environmental</b> <b>and</b> <b>resource</b> costs were not sufficiently defined in the Directive. In order to further clarify the concept of <b>environmental</b> <b>and</b> <b>resource</b> costs, <b>and</b> in order to discuss their assessment in practice, a European working group (DG Eco 2) was set up in September 2003. The paper “Economic Valuation of <b>Environmental</b> <b>and</b> <b>Resource</b> Costs: The Case of Germany” first summarises some of some main results of the DG Eco 2 working group. It then moves on to describe how <b>environmental</b> <b>and</b> <b>resource</b> costs are currently dealt with in Germany, and examines how the results of the DG Eco 2 can be put to use in the German context. A further point is the link between the assessment of <b>environmental</b> <b>and</b> <b>resource</b> costs <b>and</b> the selection of cost-effective combinations of measures. Two options are discussed here: first, addressing the question whether and how information obtained through the selection of measures can be used to assess <b>environmental</b> <b>and</b> <b>resources</b> costs; <b>and</b> secondly, discussing how the selected measures themselves can help to achieve cost recovery for <b>environmental</b> <b>and</b> <b>resource</b> costs. In this way, the results of the DG Eco 2 are linked to a previous research project, in which Ecologic developed a handbook for the cost-effective selection of measures under the WFD. ...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} some {{relationships between}} the macro economy, economic policy at the macro level, <b>and</b> the <b>environmental</b> <b>and</b> <b>resource</b> situation in developing countries. We focus on 5 issues, namely taxes and subsidies directed at energy <b>and</b> <b>resource</b> sectors, investments with particular <b>environmental</b> <b>and</b> <b>resource</b> implications, exchange rate and monetary policy, financial sector issues, and effects of crises and stress situations. Main findings are, first, that while having been reduced somewhat in later years, energy <b>and</b> <b>resource</b> subsidies still contribute to substantial excessive <b>environmental</b> <b>and</b> <b>resource</b> stress. Secondly, erratic monetary policy manifested through instability of the domestic currency, devaluations and high interest rate, lead to <b>environmental</b> <b>and</b> <b>resource</b> stress, in particular higher extraction of non-renewables such as forests. Thirdly, crises caused by financial turmoil and/or domestic chaos often have similar consequences as they tend to cause economic agents to take very short-run positions e. g. {{in the form of}} over-extraction <b>and</b> sub-optimal <b>environmental</b> care. It is stressed that most of the relationships discussed in this chapter are quite uncertain and that further research is highly warranted...|$|R
