5|$|At , Cameroon is the world's 53rd-largest country. It is {{slightly}} larger than the nation of Sweden and comparable in size to Papua New Guinea. The country is located in Central and West Africa on the Bight of Bonny, part of the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Guinea</b> and the Atlantic Ocean. Cameroon lies between latitudes 1° and 13°N, and longitudes 8° and 17°E.|$|E
5|$|Cameroon {{has four}} {{patterns}} of drainage. In the south, the principal rivers are the Ntem, Nyong, Sanaga, and Wouri. These flow southwestward or westward {{directly into the}} <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Guinea.</b> The Dja and Kadéï drain southeastward into the Congo River. In northern Cameroon, the Bénoué River runs north and west and empties into the Niger. The Logone flows northward into Lake Chad, which Cameroon shares with three neighbouring countries.|$|E

50|$|Dallas-based Kosmos Energy LLC held an 86.5% working {{interest}} in the West Cape Three Points (WCTP) Block in the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Guinea’s</b> Tano Basin. In 2005, the company conducted a 1,075-km2 three-dimensional (3-D) survey to evaluate {{the potential of the}} block. The WCTP Block is located about 8 km from the Ghanaian coastline and 95 km southwest of the city of Takoradi. The remaining interest in WCTP was held by GNPC (10%) and E.O. Group of Ghana (3.5%).|$|R
50|$|Abidjan {{also has}} beaches around the lagoon, with palm and coconut trees, in the Vridi area, {{which are very}} popular at {{weekends}} with the picturesque sight of the pineapple and coconut sellers. Nevertheless, the rip-tides which affects practically the whole <b>of</b> the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Guinea's</b> coast, means that in this area swimming is not usually allowed. Generally, in Cote d'Ivoire, tourism has never really been developed as an economic industry; {{the country is not}} much of a common holiday destination.|$|R
5|$|The Atlantic torpedo {{is widely}} {{distributed}} in cool waters {{on both sides}} of the Atlantic Ocean. In the east, it is found from northern Scotland to the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Guinea,</b> including the entire Mediterranean Sea (but not the Black Sea), the Azores, and Madeira, as well as from Namibia to western South Africa. In the west, it occurs from southern Nova Scotia to Venezuela and Brazil. It is rare in the North Sea and the Mediterranean and south of North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|In the North Atlantic, feeding areas {{range from}} Scandinavia to New England. Breeding {{occurs in the}} Caribbean and Cape Verde. In the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, whales may breed off Brazil, as well the coasts of central, {{southern}} and southeastern Africa (including Madagascar). Whale visits into Gulf of Mexico have been infrequent, but occurred in the gulf historically. In the South Atlantic, about 10% of world population of the species possibly migrate to the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Guinea.</b> Comparison of songs between those at Cape Lopez and Abrolhos Archipelago indicate that trans-Atlantic mixings between western and southeastern populations occur.|$|E
5|$|There {{are local}} names for winds {{associated}} with sand and dust storms. The Calima carries dust on southeast winds into the Canary islands. The Harmattan carries dust {{during the winter}} into the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Guinea.</b> The Sirocco brings dust from north Africa into southern Europe because of the movement of extratropical cyclones through the Mediterranean. Spring storm systems moving across the eastern Mediterranean Sea cause dust to carry across Egypt and the Arabian peninsula, which are locally known as Khamsin. The Shamal is caused by cold fronts lifting dust into the atmosphere {{for days at a}} time across the Persian Gulf states.|$|E
50|$|According to the Indian {{ambassador}} to Ivory Coast, India plans to invest $1 billion into developing oil and mining projects {{over the next}} five years. In the last ten years, the total amount of announced Indian FDI abroad has been more than $10 billion. From India's energy security viewpoint, Ivory Coast has emerged as an important destination for investment opportunities in hydrocarbon exploration and diamonds. Recent BBC reports have drawn attention to the emerging importance of Africa in India’s foreign economic policy and the special role that West Africa is now occupying. India hopes to tap into the region's vast oil wealth by accessing the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Guinea's</b> shoreline.|$|R

5|$|Empire: Total War {{is focused}} on exploration, economics, politics, religion, the {{founding}} of colonies and, ultimately, conquest. The game {{is set in the}} early modern period from 1700 {{until the end of the}} 18th century, allowing players to lead various nations and attempt to dominate Europe, the Middle East, India, North America and the Caribbean, along with the maritime trade theatres of the South American coast, <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Guinea,</b> Mozambique Channel and the East Indies. As with previous Total War games, Empire: Total War consists of two separate areas of gameplay: a turn-based geopolitical campaign that allows the user to deploy complex strategies by moving armies and navies across the globe, conducting diplomacy, trade, espionage, and managing the internal politics of their nation, as well as a real-time battle mode that enables players to command military forces in battle both on land and at sea.|$|E
5|$|The {{distribution}} of the pelagic stingray extends nearly worldwide in tropical to warm-temperate pelagic waters, between the latitudes of 52°N and 50°S. In the western Atlantic, {{it has been reported}} from the Grand Banks of Newfoundland to North Carolina, the northern Gulf of Mexico, and the Lesser Antilles, Brazil and Uruguay. In the eastern Atlantic, this species has been recorded from the North Sea to Madeira, including the Mediterranean Sea, as well as around Cape Verde, in the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Guinea</b> and off South Africa. In the Pacific, it is known from Japan to Australia and New Zealand in the west, British Columbia to Chile in the west, and around many oceanic islands including Hawaii, the Galápagos, and Easter Island. There have been no reports of this species from much of the Indian Ocean, but it is known to be common in the southwestern portion and around Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|The {{porbeagle}} has {{an almost}} global amphitemperate distribution, i.e. it is {{absent from the}} tropics; in the North Pacific, its niche is assumed by the salmon shark. It is found mostly within 30–70°N and 30–50°S latitudes. In the North Atlantic, the northern limit of its range extends from the Newfoundland Grand Banks off Canada, through southern Greenland, to Scandinavia and Russia; the southern limit of its range extends from New Jersey and Bermuda, through the Azores and Madeira, to Morocco. It {{is found in the}} Mediterranean Sea, but not the Black Sea. Normally, North Atlantic sharks only stray as far south as South Carolina and the <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Guinea,</b> but pregnant females from the western North Atlantic population are known to range into the Sargasso Sea, almost as far as Hispaniola, to give birth. In the Southern Hemisphere, the porbeagle apparently occupies a continuous band bound in the south by the Antarctic Convergence, and extending as far north as Chile and Brazil, the Western Cape province of South Africa, Australia to southern Western Australia and southern Queensland, and New Zealand. It is speculated that the porbeagle colonized the Southern Hemisphere during the Quaternary glaciation (beginning c. 2.6 Ma), when the tropical climate zone was much narrower than it is today.|$|E

During this time he worked with Joyce Allan, from whom he obtained illustrations for his scientific papers. He resigned in 1925 to become scientific director of the Great Barrier Reef Investigation Committee. Between April and August 1926 he was supervising the sinking of a bore on Michaelmas Reef near Cairns, and he returned to Sydney in August intending to visit Japan in connexion with the third Pan-Pacific Science Congress. Not being well he decided to abandon the journey, and though it was hoped that a rest would restore his health, he died suddenly on 14 September 1926.
