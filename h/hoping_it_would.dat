5|$|After Mellotronics had {{targeted}} them as {{a potential}} customer, the BBC Radiophonic Workshop {{became interested in the}} possibilities of the instrument, <b>hoping</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> allow them to increase throughput. The corporation used two custom-made models that employed recorded sound effects throughout 1963 and 1964, but had problems with fluctuating tape speed and found the sound wasn't up to professional broadcast quality. The Mellotron was eventually dropped in favour of electronic oscillators and synthesizers.|$|E

North Korean officers from the division continued to attack the ROK unit <b>hoping</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> collapse, and the North Korean troops were able to slowly erode at the South Korean division′s defenses, forcing it into a smaller and smaller pocket. The ROK division was forced further south {{to the village of}} Changsa-dong, where U.S. Navy planners began preparations to evacuate the division by LSTs and DUKWs.|$|E
5|$|Happy Brothers, Their Poor Mother! (often {{referred}} to simply as Happy Brothers) is an 1887 oil painting by the Serbian artist Uroš Predić. It shows four intoxicated youths walking through their village whilst {{the mother of}} one shouts her disapproval from the distance. The painting {{is said to have been}} inspired by a frequent sight in Predić's home village of Orlovat—that of drunken youths returning from the pub at dawn. Predić painted the composition <b>hoping</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> persuade the villagers to change their ways. He was disappointed that it not only failed to decrease the incidence of drunkenness in Orlovat, but was well received by the villagers themselves, who were happy merely to have been depicted.|$|E

5|$|In 1980, Fonda {{starred in}} 9 to 5 with Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton. The film {{was a huge}} {{critical}} and box office success, becoming the second highest-grossing release of the year. Fonda had long {{wanted to work with}} her father, <b>hoping</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> help their strained relationship. She achieved this goal when she purchased the screen rights to the play On Golden Pond, specifically for her father and her. On Golden Pond, which also starred Katharine Hepburn, brought Henry Fonda his only Academy Award for Best Actor, which Jane accepted on his behalf, as he was ill and could not leave home. He died five months later.|$|E
5|$|Anxious {{for their}} safety Kirill and Victoria decided {{that the best thing}} to do was to leave Russia. They chose Finland as the best {{possible}} place to go. Although a territory of the Russian Empire, Finland possessed its own government and constitution, so in a way it would be like being in Russia and not being at the same time. They had already been once invited to Haikko, a beautiful estate, near Borgå, a small town on the south coast of Finland, not far away from Helsinki. The Provisional Government permitted them to leave, though they were not allowed to take anything of value with them. They sewed jewels into the family's clothing, <b>hoping</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> not be discovered by the authorities. They were permitted to board a train without incident in the first week of June 1917.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{returned}} to Cabell's Dale in early 1806 and fell ill in June. In July, he visited Kentucky's Olympian Springs, <b>hoping</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> aid his recovery, {{but it did}} not. Doctors disagreed on {{the cause of his}} illness, with diagnoses ranging from typhus fever to stomach ailments. He attempted to return to Washington, D.C., on October 22, but while his horse was being prepared for the journey, he collapsed in pain and had to be helped back inside. Friends and relatives hoped for a recovery that never came, and he died on December 14, 1806. The cause of death was eventually determined to be tuberculosis. According to family tradition, Polly Breckinridge was so distraught over her husband's death that she went blind from her incessant crying. Breckinridge was first buried at Cabell's Dale on December 16 but was later reinterred in Lexington Cemetery.|$|E

5|$|Gamal Abdel Nasser {{wrote in}} his memoirs that already by May 25, the Egyptian forces were spread so thin {{that they had no}} mobile {{reserves}} to assault a Jewish force, and considered it strange that they would be ordered to allocate a major contingent to fight in an unfamiliar area. Following-up his victory in the Battle of Yad Mordechai on May 23–24, al-Mwawi pushed north along the coast, bypassing the relatively well-defended Israeli village of Nitzanim. His column was reinforced by sea near Majdal, where he sent part of his force to the Majdal–Hebron road, <b>hoping</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be able to link with another column, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Abd el-Aziz, south of Jerusalem. Reduced to about 2,500 men, al-Mwawi resumed his march northwards. Brigadier General Muhammad Naguib was put in charge of the column by al-Mwawi, because the original commander was on vacation in Egypt.|$|E
5|$|Reina is Shuna's {{younger sister}} who closely resembles Serena and dresses in gothic Lolita-style clothing. She grew up hearing stories of Pompeii and {{developed}} a crush on Souichi. After Reina has her confession rejected by Souichi, she runs away and happens upon Keidai and the others. She discovers that he also has memories of Pompeii and brings them to Shuna <b>hoping</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> bring back her memories. She {{is in the same}} class as Yuuma where their similarities make them seem like twins. Reina and Yuuma grow close as friends and begin to speak to each other about their problems. They connect over their predicament of having romantic feelings for those who only see them as a younger sibling. Reina is later revealed to be the reincarnation of a girl named , a friend of Serena. Her appearance of resembling Serena is explained as Tina's wish to experience the same love Serena has with Sirix.|$|E
5|$|On 22 March 1933 he {{was invited}} for an {{interview}} for a commission in the Air Force in Pretoria. One of 30 applicants vying for three places, he was rejected for lack of flying experience. Determined to rectify this weakness, he went to Johannesburg and began taking flying lessons. To fund his new ambition, {{he worked for a}} mining company, Sheba Gold Mine. He enjoyed the work so much he considered studying for a degree in mining engineering. His passion for flying subsided, but an impromptu visit by a transport aircraft gave Pattle a close glimpse of it, which rekindled his interest. At around the same time, the Ministry of Defence created the Special Service Battalion to employ South African youth who were struggling to find work because of the Great Depression. He joined up in 1936 <b>hoping</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> lead to a career in the Air Force. He undertook basic training and national service on the understanding that he would be given an opportunity to enter the Air Force as an instructor {{at the end of his}} four-year service.|$|E

25|$|Moe urged Curly to {{find himself}} a wife, <b>hoping</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> persuade his brother to finally settle down and allow his health to improve somewhat. After a two-week courtship, he married Marion Buxbaum on October 17, 1945, a union which lasted {{approximately}} three months. The divorce proceeding was a bitter one, exacerbated by exploitation in the local media. After the divorce, his health fell into rapid and devastating decline.|$|E
25|$|The game {{follows the}} adventures of Jaster Rogue, a young {{agricultural}} worker living on an isolated planet, who becomes involved in a galactic conflict, and learns {{the fate of the}} entire galaxy lies in his hands. At the time of its release, Rogue Galaxy was the largest game Level-5 had ever developed, both in terms of the amount of staff working on it and the length of production (over three years). Both Level-5 and Sony had strong expectations for the game, <b>hoping</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> challenge the RPG market dominance of the Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest franchises.|$|E

25|$|Although the {{political}} {{aspect of the}} first Louis-Schmeling bout would later be dwarfed by the crucible of the later 1938 rematch, brewing political sentiment would inevitably attach itself to the fight. Adolf Hitler had become chancellor of Germany three years previously and, although the United States and Germany were not yet political or military enemies, there was some tension building among the two countries as the Nazi Party began asserting its pro-Aryan, anti-Jewish ideology. Schmeling's Jewish manager, Joe Jacobs, set up Schmeling's training at a Jewish resort in the Catskills, <b>hoping</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> help mollify Jewish fight fans.|$|E
25|$|After hearing {{arguments}} from scientists and military officers over the possible {{use of nuclear}} weapons against Japan (though some recommended using them as demonstrations in unpopulated areas, most recommended using them against built up targets, a euphemistic term for populated cities), Truman ordered the use of the weapons on Japanese cities, <b>hoping</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> send a strong message that would end in the capitulation of the Japanese leadership and avoid a lengthy invasion of the islands. On May 10–11, 1945, the Target Committee at Los Alamos, led by Oppenheimer, recommended Kyoto, Hiroshima, Yokohama, and Kokura as possible targets. Concerns about Kyoto's cultural heritage led to it being replaced by Nagasaki.|$|E
25|$|After {{his victory}} at Stones River, Rosecrans {{occupied}} Murfreesboro for almost six months while Bragg rested in Tullahoma, establishing a long defensive line that {{was intended to}} block Union advances against the strategic city of Chattanooga in his rear. In April, Union cavalry under Col. Abel Streight moved against the railroad that supplied Bragg's army in Middle Tennessee, <b>hoping</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> cause them to withdraw to Georgia. Streight's brigade raided through Mississippi and Alabama, fighting against Nathan Bedford Forrest. Streight's Raid ended when his exhausted men surrendered near Rome, Georgia, on May 3. In June, Rosecrans finally advanced against Bragg in a brilliant, almost bloodless, campaign of maneuver, the Tullahoma Campaign, and drove Bragg from Middle Tennessee.|$|E
