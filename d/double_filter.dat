40|$|Abstract Background Many {{researchers}} use the <b>double</b> <b>filtering</b> {{procedure with}} fold change and t test to identify differentially expressed genes, {{in the hope}} that the <b>double</b> <b>filtering</b> will provide extra confidence in the results. Due to its simplicity, the <b>double</b> <b>filtering</b> procedure has been popular with applied researchers despite the development of more sophisticated methods. Results This paper, for the first time to our knowledge, provides theoretical insight on the drawback of the <b>double</b> <b>filtering</b> procedure. We show that fold change assumes all genes to have a common variance while t statistic assumes gene-specific variances. The two statistics are based on contradicting assumptions. Under the assumption that gene variances arise from a mixture of a common variance and gene-specific variances, we develop the theoretically most powerful likelihood ratio test statistic. We further demonstrate that the posterior inference based on a Bayesian mixture model and the widely used significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) statistic are better approximations to the likelihood ratio test than the <b>double</b> <b>filtering</b> procedure. Conclusion We demonstrate through hypothesis testing theory, simulation studies and real data examples, that well constructed shrinkage testing methods, which can be united under the mixture gene variance assumption, can considerably outperform the <b>double</b> <b>filtering</b> procedure. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- The ac/dc {{filters are}} always needed in HVDC {{converter}} stations to suppress harmonic currents/voltages. The ac side filters are also employed to compensate network requested reactive power. Among {{different types of}} <b>filters,</b> <b>double</b> tuned passive <b>filters</b> have been widely utilized in HVDC stations, yet these filters are still not considered well developed. This paper presents an algorithm for design of the conventional and damped-type <b>double</b> tuned <b>filters</b> to reduce harmonic distortion and improve power factor in electrical systems. Firstly, the conventional <b>double</b> tuned <b>filters</b> are comprehensively studied, and an algorithm for precisely determining the parameters {{of this type of}} filters is presented. Next, the proposed design algorithm is developed for damped-typed <b>double</b> tuned <b>filters.</b> Using this method, the parameters of damped-type <b>double</b> tuned <b>filters</b> are calculated based on the tuned frequencies, the parallel resonance frequency, and the reactive power compensation capacity etc. Finally, the performance of the design algorithm is tested for a 6 -pulse HVDC converter simulated on the MATLAB. The results clearly show the effectiveness of proposed design method in harmonics elimination and power factor correction.

50|$|The Laplacian pyramid (LP) {{decomposition}} only produce one bandpass {{image in}} a multidimensional signal processing, that can avoid frequency scrambling. And directional filter bank (DFB) is only fit for high frequency since it will leak the low frequency of signals in its directional subbands. This {{is the reason}} to combine DFB with LP, which is multiscale decomposition and remove the low frequency. Therefore, image signals pass through LP subbands to get bandpass signals and pass those signals through DFB to capture the directional information of image. This <b>double</b> <b>filter</b> bank structure of combination of LP and DFB is also called as pyramid directional filter bank (PDFB), and this transform is approximate the original image by using basic contour, so it is also called discrete contourlet transform.|$|E
50|$|Although the wavelet {{transform}} is not optimal in capturing the 2-D singularities of images, {{it can take}} the place of LP decomposition in the <b>double</b> <b>filter</b> bank structure to make the contourlet transform a non-redundant image transform. The wavelet-based contourlet transform is similar to the original contourlet transform, and it also consists of two filter bank stages. In the first stage, the {{wavelet transform}} is used to do the sub-band decomposition instead of the Laplacian pyramid (LP) in the contourlet transform. And the second stage of the wavelet-based contourlet transform is still a directional filter bank (DFB) to provide the link of singular points. One of the advantages to the wavelet-based contourlet transform is that the wavelet-based contourlet packets are similar to the wavelet packets which allows quad-tree decomposition of both low-pass and high-pass channels and then apply the DFB on each sub-band.|$|E

Over a four-month period, forty patients (EuroSCORE 6 +) undergoing coronary revascularization were prospectively randomized to one of the four perfusion protocols: Group 1 (N= 10) : Conventional circuits (ECC) + two leukocyte filters (LG 6 B, Pall, USA) with the method of two-phase (continuous + strategic) leukofiltration; Group 2 (N= 10) : ECC + single leukocyte filter with the method of continuous leukofiltration; Group 3 (N= 10) : ECC + single leukocyte filter with the method of strategic leukofiltration; Group 4 (N= 10) Control: ECC without leukocyte filtration. Blood samples were collected at T 1 : Baseline, T 2 : On CPB, T 3 : X-Clamp, T 4 : Off CPB, T 5 : ICU 24 and T 6 : ICU 48. Perioperative follow-up was thoroughly monitored. Leukocyte counts in <b>double</b> <b>filter</b> and strategic filtration groups demonstrated significant differences at T 4 (p <. 05 vs. control). TNFalpha levels were significantly lower in Group 1 at T 4 and procalcitonin levels at T 5 and T 6 (p <. 05 vs. control).

For theta = 90 degrees the triple quantum filtered spectra exhibited the typical multiple quantum filtered lineshape, characteristic of isotropic media, while the <b>double</b> quantum <b>filtered</b> ones presented a superposition of two signals, whose proportion depended on the creation time tau. This effect {{is due to the}} formation of both second and third rank tensors. The formation of the second rank tensor, T 21 results from non-zero residual quadrupolar interaction and is related to the anisotropic motion of sodium ions. Measurements of the <b>double</b> quantum <b>filtered</b> spectra with theta = 54. 7 degrees enabled the detection of the contribution of T 21 exclusively.

40|$|AbstractâThe <b>double</b> <b>filter</b> {{method has}} been widely used for {{measuring}} the concentration of radon or thoron in air. The method consists of letting the filtered air into a cylindrical tube and collecting the decay products formed inside the tube on a filter paper at the exit. A sig-nificant portion of the decay products deposit on the wall. In the present modification, aerosol particles are let into the tube near the periphery. These scavenge and bring-the decay products on to the end filter thus preventing their deposition on the wall. The modified method improves the sensitivity, allows low flow rate sampling and {{can be considered as}} absolute, since nearly 95 % of all the decay products formed inside the decay tube are collected on the end filter.

40|$|Abstract. This chapter {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of a new âtrue â twodimensional representation for images that can capture the intrinsic geometrical structure of pictorial information. Our emphasis is on the discrete framework that can lead to algorithmic implementations. We propose a <b>double</b> <b>filter</b> bank structure, named the pyramidal directional filter bank, by combining the Laplacian pyramid with a directional filter bank. The result is called the contourlet transform, which provides a flexible multiresolution, local and directional expansion for images. The contourlet transform can be designed to satisfy the anisotropy scaling relation for curves, and thus offers a fast and structured curvelet-like decomposition sampled signals. As a result, the proposed transform provides a sparse representation for two-dimensional piecewise smooth signals that resemble images. The link between the developed filter banks and the continuous-space constructions is set up precisely in a newly defined directional multiresolution analysis. Finally, we show some numerical experiments demonstrating the potential of the new transform in several image processing tasks. 1...|$|E

By choosing the filters {{in such a way}} that only the emission from the continuum part of the spectrum is measured, the ratio of the two signals is a function of the highest {{electron temperature}} along the line of sight of the detectors. With this diagnostic, the electron temperature has been measured in RFX with a bandwidth of approximately 2 kHz. This allows the direct measurement, for the first time in a RFP on a single shot basis, of coherent oscillations, associated with relaxation events and showing under some conditions a sawtooth-like character.
