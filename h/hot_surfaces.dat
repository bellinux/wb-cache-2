Occupational hearing loss is the most common work-related injury in the United States, with 22 million workers exposed to {{hazardous}} noise levels at work and an estimated $242 million spent annually on worker's compensation for hearing loss disability. Falls are also a common cause of occupational injuries and fatalities, especially in construction, extraction, transportation, healthcare, and building cleaning and maintenance.

25|$|Most {{vehicles}} existing {{today have}} been serviced by GM {{during one of}} the safety recalls on the car. For the fire-related recall, shields and drip-trays were added to prevent leaking fluids from contacting <b>hot</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The presence of drip shields between the engine block and the exhaust manifold are a clue that the car has been retrofitted. The addition of the longer AC Delco PF51 oil filter and a re-calibrated dipstick added extra oil capacity to the oiling system, and enabled running four quarts of oil in the crankcase instead of three, to help prevent oil starvation to the rods. Certain vehicles also had their connecting rods or entire block replaced.|$|E

40|$|Undesirable <b>hot</b> <b>surface</b> {{ignition}} of {{flammable liquids}} {{is one of}} the hazards in ground and air transportation vehicles, which primarily occurs in the engine compartment. In order to evaluate the safety and sustainability of candidate replacement fuels with respect to <b>hot</b> <b>surface</b> ignition, a baseline low lead fuel (Avgas 100 LL) and four experimental unleaded aviation fuels recommended for reciprocating aviation engines were considered. In addition, <b>hot</b> <b>surface</b> ignition properties of the gas turbine fuels Jet-A, JP- 8, and JP- 5 were measured. A test apparatus capable of providing reproducible data was designed and fabricated to experimentally investigate the <b>hot</b> <b>surface</b> ignition characteristics. A uniform surface temperature stainless steel plate simulating the wall of a typical exhaust manifold of an aircraft engine was used as the <b>hot</b> <b>surface.</b> Temperature uniformity of ± 5 °C was achieved on the stainless steel plate by virtue of its being bolted to a copper plate in which five automatically controlled 1000 W electrical cartridge heaters were inserted. A programmable syringe pump was used to dispense ~ 25 μL fuel drops onto the <b>hot</b> <b>surface.</b> Testing was performed in a quiescent environment {{with the exception of a}} mild upward flow created by an exhaust fan aiding the buoyant plume created by the hot plate. Ignition and flame propagation events were recorded using visible and mid-infrared still and video imaging. The ignition and flame propagation events are transient and occur at randomly distributed locations on the <b>hot</b> <b>surface.</b> To characterize the ignition event statistically, the surface temperature leading to at least one ignition out of the number of drops and the surface temperature resulting in the ignition of all of the drops were recorded. The results of the experiment confirmed that the experimental variations in the drop size, drop velocity, plume characteristics, surface properties including temperature changes, and the nonlinear dependence of temperature of the chemical reaction rate lead to the probabilistic nature of the ignition event. The results of the experiment are of practical value in designing vehicular ignition and safety systems...|$|R

Two stage combustion which is usually observed in pulverized coal combustion was observed in the burning sequence of the CWM droplet on the <b>hot</b> <b>surface.</b> The first stage of combustion was due to the burning of flammable gas from the volatile matter in the coal. The second stage was the char combustion of the coal. As the temperature on the <b>hot</b> <b>surface</b> increased, the collapsing load of the ash grain decreased.

40|$|Imagine a specially-engineered {{surface that}} could allow liquids to boil without bubbling. This sounds counter-intuitive and, in a way, it is. But {{consider}} the following. When a small {{drop of water}} is dropped onto a very hot frying pan, it skitters around and takes up to a minute to evaporate. On initial contact, the <b>hot</b> <b>surface</b> vaporises part of the drop and creates an insulating vapour layer between the drop and the <b>hot</b> <b>surface,</b> much like the air gap in a double-glazed window.
