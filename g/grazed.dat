40|$|<b>Grazing</b> by {{livestock}} has a {{great influence}} on soil characteristics with major effects on soil carbon and nitrogen cycling in <b>grazing</b> lands. <b>Grazing</b> practices affect soil properties in different ways depending on the prescribed stocking rate and <b>grazing</b> periods. The new <b>grazing</b> system of short intensive <b>grazing</b> followed by {{a long period of}} rest referred to as time-controlled <b>grazing</b> (TC <b>grazing)</b> has become popular amongst many graziers in Australia and elsewhere in the world. However, little research has been carried out on the impacts of this <b>grazing</b> system on the physical and chemical health of the soil. To address this issue, a comprehensive field study was carried out in a sheep <b>grazing</b> property of Currajong in south east region of Queensland, Australia where the two <b>grazing</b> systems of continuous and TC <b>grazing</b> were compared. Results obtained on the impact of <b>grazing</b> management on soil characteristics over a five-year period (2001 - 2006) showed an increase in soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen (SON) in the areas with favorable soil condition over the study period as compared with continuous <b>grazing.</b> There was also an increase in ground litter accumulation over time and no compaction in TC <b>grazing.</b> Nitrate and extractable P concentrations were reduced by higher grass growth occurring under TC <b>grazing,</b> which in turn decreases the contamination potential for downstream water bodies. This reduction was much more pronounced on a historical sheep aggregation camp turned into TC system, where a large amount of fecal materials had been deposited prior to the its convertion to TC <b>grazing.</b> The smaller size of the paddocks along with the long rest period provided by TC <b>grazing</b> in this area recognized to be the major contributors to both physical and chemical recovery of the soil after each <b>grazing</b> operation.

40|$|<b>Grazing</b> at low {{stocking}} {{rates is}} often recommended {{for the preservation}} of the characteristic biodiversity of open landscapes. However, the fine-tuning of <b>grazing</b> management still lacks a good evidence base. This is particularly true for insect communities, as available evidence indicates that these are more vulnerable to <b>grazing</b> than plant communities. The outcome, however, may be expected to differ between insect species. Here, we analysed the impact of different <b>grazing</b> intensities on insect communities from lowland heathlands in the Netherlands. Firstly, we use detailed data on butterfly distribution and abundances to analyse population responses of 10 butterfly species to heathland <b>grazing</b> management. Secondly, we investigated species responses to <b>grazing</b> intensity on 16 field locations across a range of insect groups (butterflies, day-active moths, grasshoppers, and ants). We hypothesized that species from early successional stages would benefit from <b>grazing</b> whereas late-successional species would suffer from <b>grazing.</b> Moreover, we expected summer <b>grazing</b> to have less beneficial effects than year-round <b>grazing.</b> Both hypotheses were largely supported by our results. Species responses to <b>grazing</b> contrasted between early and late successional species. Variation in species responses were strongly linked to <b>grazing</b> intensity and soil moisture, reflecting species-specific niches in relation to vegetation structure and microclimate. We conclude that low-intensity year-round cattle <b>grazing</b> or herded sheep <b>grazing</b> may promote insect biodiversity in large, heterogeneous heathlands, whereas targeted or rotational <b>grazing</b> may be advisable in smaller areas. </p...|$|R

Timing of <b>grazing</b> is one <b>grazing</b> regime component that is less understood than <b>grazing</b> intensity and grazer identity, but is predicted to have important implications for plant and higher trophic level responses. We experimentally assessed how timing of cattle <b>grazing</b> affected plant and arthropod communities in high-elevation grasslands of southwest Montana to better evaluate its use as a tool for multi-trophic level management. We manipulated timing of <b>grazing,</b> with one <b>grazing</b> treatment beginning in mid-June and the other in mid-July, in two experiments conducted in different grassland habitat types (i. e., wet meadow and upland) in 2011 and 2012. In the upland grassland experiment, we found that both early and late <b>grazing</b> treatments reduced forb biomass, whereas graminoid biomass was only reduced with late <b>grazing.</b> <b>Grazing</b> earlier in the growing season versus later did not result in greater recovery of graminoid or forb biomass as expected. In addition, the density of the most ubiquitous grassland arthropod order (Hemiptera) was reduced by both <b>grazing</b> treatments in upland grasslands. A comparison of end-of-season plant responses to <b>grazing</b> in upland versus wet meadow grasslands revealed that <b>grazing</b> reduced graminoid biomass in the wet meadow and forb biomass in the upland, irrespective of timing of <b>grazing.</b> Both <b>grazing</b> treatments also reduced end-of-season total arthropod and Hemiptera densities and Hemiptera biomass in both grassland habitat types.
