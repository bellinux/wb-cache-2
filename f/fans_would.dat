5|$|Pratchett {{resisted}} {{mapping the}} Discworld {{for quite some}} time, noting that a firmly designed map restricts narrative possibility (i.e., with a map, <b>fans</b> <b>would</b> complain if he placed a building on the wrong street, but without one, he could adjust the geography to fit the story).|$|E

5|$|The {{sketches}} even {{led to a}} fanzine {{and appreciation}} gatherings, where <b>fans</b> <b>would</b> dress up as the characters. In 2004, in a poll on its website, Channel 4 voted Acorn Antiques the seventh best comedy sketch of all time. In 2005, Acorn Antiques {{was turned into a}} West End musical (see below).|$|E
5|$|In 1996, {{a sequel}} for the Nintendo 64, Mother 3 (EarthBound 64 in North America), was announced. It was slated for release on the 64DD, a disk drive {{expansion}} peripheral for the Nintendo 64. Itoi's expansive ideas during development led the development team {{to question whether}} <b>fans</b> <b>would</b> still consider the game part of the series. The game entered development hell and struggled to find a firm release date and in 2000, despite its level of completion, was later cancelled altogether with the commercial failure of the 64DD.|$|E
5|$|Nomura {{placed a}} secret trailer in Kingdom Hearts {{in hopes that}} <b>fans</b> <b>would</b> want a sequel. He was unsure if <b>fans</b> <b>would</b> want a sequel and felt {{that if they did}} not, then {{it would be best to}} leave certain events in the first game unexplained. After Kingdom Hearts Final Mix was completed, {{development}} for Kingdom Hearts II began. There were several obstacles to clear before development could begin on a sequel. One was the development team's desire to showcase Mickey Mouse more; Mickey's inclusion in the first game was restricted to a very small role. Nomura had planned for the sequel to take place a year after the first and originally intended for the events of that year to be left unexplained. To bridge the gap between the two games, Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories was developed. Nomura was hesitant about releasing a game on the Game Boy Advance because he felt the 3D graphics of the original game would not translate well into 2D. He changed his position after hearing that children wanted to play Kingdom Hearts on the handheld system.|$|E

5|$|The final {{was highly}} anticipated, {{particularly}} as Armagh and Tyrone are neighbouring counties. Police Service of Northern Ireland Deputy Chief Constable Paul Leighton estimated that 40,000 <b>fans</b> <b>would</b> travel from Northern Ireland to Dublin, despite each competing county only being allocated approximately 10,000 match tickets. Declan Martin, policy director for Dublin Chamber of Commerce, expected the revenue {{generated in the}} city {{as a result of the}} final to double because two sides from Ulster were involved.|$|E
5|$|The game {{received}} mixed to poor reviews. Critics {{found its}} physics modelling unrealistic, and many {{believed that the}} game's graphics and gameplay were outdated, {{particularly in light of}} contemporary simulators like IL-2 Sturmovik. The limited number of missions and large number of glitches were widely panned. Certain critics enjoyed Jane's Attack Squadrons air-to-ground combat and several hoped that <b>fans</b> <b>would</b> improve the game with the included physics and mission editors.|$|E
5|$|Both clubs {{received}} an allocation of approximately 31,000 tickets. Cardiff <b>fans</b> <b>would</b> be {{housed in the}} East End of the stadium, while Liverpool fans were allocated the West End of the stadium. Ticket prices were increased from last year's final, with the most expensive tickets costing £90 up £4 from the previous year. The least expensive tickets cost £40, which was £2 more than last year. It was decided that before the match started national anthems would not be played. This {{decision was made to}} avoid spectators jeering the anthems, as happened during the 2008 FA Cup Final between Portsmouth and Cardiff.|$|E

5|$|Fan {{interest}} in attending games had begun declining throughout MLB in the late-1940s, and the Yankees faced a drop-off in their crowds after 1947, when they sold about 2.2 million tickets. By 1957, season attendance was down by over 700,000. New York baseball fans {{had the option}} of watching games on television instead by the early 1950s. The Yankees joined the other New York City franchises in allowing game telecasts. This was a departure from the team's strategy when radio broadcasts were introduced. Regular season games of the Yankees were not broadcast until 1939, as management believed that fewer <b>fans</b> <b>would</b> attend games if they could listen on radios.|$|E
5|$|However, {{vigilant}} <b>fans</b> <b>would</b> {{have noticed}} the names years earlier. Hitler-Barassi was photographed in 1993 {{at the opening}} night of Madame Butterfly, which was published on 4 April 1993; the book revealed the member to be Peter Minack, who later released a book of his own (Campaigning With Grant) in 2000, which was about the American Civil War. The book contains thin references to TISM. In interviews about his book, Minack revealed he was a teacher, his father fought in World War II for the Germans {{and that he is}} fanatical about the Richmond Football Club, explaining his stage moniker.|$|E
5|$|In August 2007, Paramount Pictures hired Stephen Sommers {{to direct}} the film after his {{presentation}} to CEO Brad Grey and production prexy Brad Weston was well received. Sommers had been inspired to explore the G.I. Joe universe after visiting Hasbro's headquarters in Rhode Island. The project had found the momentum based {{on the success of}} Transformers, which di Bonaventura produced with Murphy. Sommers partly signed on to direct because the concept reminded him of James Bond, and he described an underwater battle in the story as a tribute to Thunderball. Stuart Beattie was hired to write a new script for Sommers's film, and G.I. Joe comic and filecard writer Larry Hama was hired as creative consultant. Hama helped them change story elements that <b>fans</b> <b>would</b> have disliked and made it closer to the comics, ultimately deciding <b>fans</b> <b>would</b> enjoy the script. He persuaded them to drop a comic scene at the film's end, where Snake Eyes speaks. To speed up production before the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, John Lee Hancock, Brian Koppelman and David Levien also assisted in writing various scenes. Goldner said their inspiration was generally Hama's comics and not the cartoon. Sommers said {{had it not been for}} the rich backstory in the franchise, the film would have fallen behind schedule because of the strike.|$|E

5|$|In September, {{a casting}} call sheet {{leaked to the}} Internet {{revealed}} that Cobra Commander would appear in the sequel, though it was unknown who would play the character. Chu said that <b>fans</b> <b>would</b> {{get a glimpse of}} Destro in the film, but Christopher Eccleston would not reprise his role in the sequel. On May 1, 2012, it was confirmed by Jon Chu that G.I. Joe: Retaliations Cobra Commander is Rex Lewis, the same character that Joseph Gordon-Levitt played in The Rise of Cobra. Actor Robert Baker confirmed that he is the voice of Cobra Commander in the sequel.|$|E
5|$|Ruby & Sapphire has {{received}} generally positive reception. It was well received {{when it was}} revealed at E3 by publications such as IGN and GameSpy. Its release was similarly well received, with Metacritic and GameRankings giving it aggregate scores of 82 and 80.83% respectively. It has sold 2.5 million copies worldwide, and {{has received}} significant praise from review outlets such as Nintendo Power, GamePro, and IGN, the latter awarding it the Game Boy Advance Game of the Month award for August 2003. In spite of the positive reception, some reviewers {{found it to be}} an inferior pinball experience, such as TechTV and The Guardian, though felt that Pokémon <b>fans</b> <b>would</b> enjoy it.|$|E
5|$|Sonic Team decided {{early on}} in the {{development}} process {{to reduce the number of}} characters present in the game, as well as to make Sonic the only playable character; this decision was taken to get more quality out of fewer characters. While it felt that these ideas combined with traditional Sonic gameplay was a good beginning, it also had to consider how to introduce newer gamers unfamiliar with the Sonic franchise to the series, and so the concept of the Werehog was born, in addition to exploring its own mythology and ideas for the story. Director Yoshihisa Hashimoto felt from the outset that there would be both praise and criticism, but hoped that long-term Sonic <b>fans</b> <b>would</b> understand and empathise with the ideas and direction the team had taken.|$|E

5|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Andy Saunders at the Bournemouth International Centre in January 2012, as part of One Direction's Up All Night Tour (2011–12). On 9 May 2012, Sony Music Australia disclosed via social networking website Twitter that a video for the track would premiere on 11 May. A 30-second preview of the clip, which showed the group gather around a couch onstage and sing the piece, premiered on Entertainment Tonight on 9 May. On 11 May, the clip debuted, a live performance of the song featured on their debut video album, , which was released on 28 May. Writing for MTV News, Jocelyn Vena suggested that <b>fans</b> <b>would</b> appreciate the clip's sequences.|$|E
5|$|However, {{others found}} that the {{bundling}} of the games was a sensible business decision, most highlighting {{the risk that the}} sales of Remastered could overshadow those of Infinite Warfare and result in direct competition between the two. Stephen Wright of Gamespresso, meanwhile, agreed with Activision based around the impulsiveness of the Call of Duty fanbase, writing that due to the series' popularity, many of the individuals who felt discontent towards a new title would still choose to buy it regardless. As such, Activision had released the bundle with the knowledge that <b>fans</b> <b>would</b> certainly purchase Infinite Warfare in order to obtain a remaster of Modern Warfare, a game that was held in such high regard. While Wright did disagree with having to pay for an unwanted game in order to obtain another, he expressed faith that the bundle would be good value for money.|$|E
5|$|It was {{difficult}} for crew members to perceive the film's quality {{during much of the}} production process when the finished footage was in scattered pieces and lacked elements like music and sound design. Some animators felt the film would be a significant disappointment commercially, but felt animators and animation <b>fans</b> <b>would</b> find it interesting. According to Lee Unkrich, one of the original editors of Toy Story, a scene was cut out of the original final edit. The scene features Sid, after Pizza Planet, torturing Buzz and Woody violently. Unkrich decided to cut right into the scene where Sid is interrogating the toys because the creators of the movie thought the audience would be loving Buzz and Woody at that point. Another scene, where Woody was trying to get Buzz's attention when he was stuck in the box crate, was shortened because the creators felt it would lose the energy of the movie. Peter Schneider had grown optimistic about the film as it neared completion, and announced a United States release date of November, coinciding with Thanksgiving weekend and the start of the winter holiday season.|$|E
