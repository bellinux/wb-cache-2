His opponent was John Phillips who was making his second professional appearance. Wallhead defeated Phillips to retain the title, after a TKO victory due to elbows.|$|E
5|$|Amid growing {{military}} setbacks, Vietnam {{signed the}} Treaty of Saigon in June 1862, losing three southern provinces {{which became the}} French colony of Cochinchina. Tự Đức hoped that by abiding by the treaty, Vietnam could eventually negotiate the future return of the territory. He ordered the partisans to disband, but Định refused to recognise the treaty and disobeyed the monarch, fighting on in <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> homeland. With the loss of imperial support, Định's forces began to struggle against the superior resources of the French. His men were gradually worn down and, following an ambush, Định committed suicide to avoid being captured.|$|E
5|$|Bainbridge {{returned}} to Harvard after the war, and initiated {{the construction of}} a 96-inch synchro-cyclotron, which has since been dismantled. From 1950 to 1954, he chaired the physics department at Harvard. During those years, he drew the ire of Senator Joseph McCarthy for his aggressive <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> colleagues in academia. As chairman, he was responsible for the renovation of the old Jefferson Physical Laboratory, and he established the Morris Loeb Lectures in Physics. He also devoted a good deal of his time to improving the laboratory facilities for graduate students.|$|E
50|$|In 1845 {{he embraced}} Swedenborgianism {{and went on}} to write many <b>defenses</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> new faith. He {{translated}} and published the diary of Emanuel Swedenborg in 1845, and became editor of the New Church Repository.|$|R
50|$|January 10 - Henry Armstrong begins {{what would}} be a run of 20 {{successful}} title <b>defenses</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> world Welterweight title in the same year, defeating Baby Arizmendi by a ten-round decision, in Los Angeles.|$|R
50|$|Tokugawa forces {{attacked}} Hideyori in the Siege of Osaka in {{the winter}} of 1614. The attack failed, but Hideyori was induced to sign a truce and dismantle the <b>defenses</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> stronghold at Osaka Castle.|$|R
5|$|Fueled by the {{negative}} press, and despite an injured leg, McNamara led Syracuse on a {{run to the}} Big East tournament title. In the first round he hit a running one-handed three-point shot {{with less than a}} second left in the game to spur Syracuse past the University of Cincinnati, 74-73. Following the game Jim Boeheim unleashed a passionate profanity laced <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> star player to the attending media.|$|E
5|$|Ohmsen {{was awarded}} the Iron Cross 2nd Class (Eisernes Kreuz 2. Klasse) {{in the morning of}} 7 June 1944 for his <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> strong point against the American attacks. On the evening of 7 June he {{received}} a phone call from Cherbourg with the information that he had been awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class (Eisernes Kreuz 1. Klasse) in addition to the earlier award. Ohmsen was wounded on the left hand during a bombardment of the battery in the afternoon of 8 June.|$|E
5|$|Before the duel, Hamilton wrote a <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{decision}} to duel {{while at the}} same time intending to throw away his shot. Hamilton viewed his roles of being a father and husband, putting his creditors at risk, placing his family's welfare in jeopardy and his moral and religious stances as reasons not to duel, but he felt it impossible to avoid due to having made attacks on Burr which he was unable to recant, and because of Burr's behavior prior to the duel. He attempted to reconcile his moral and religious reasons and the codes of honor and politics. He intended to accept the duel and throw away his fire in order to satisfy his morals and political codes, respectively. His desire to be available for future political matters also played a factor.|$|E
50|$|Moon {{would go}} on to make two {{successful}} <b>defenses</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> title, scoring a seventh-round KO of Edgar Omar Monserrat, and a fifth-round KO of Chiaki Kobayashi. Kobayashi, a former Japanese National Bantamweight Champion, retired after this defeat.|$|R
50|$|Hoye {{made three}} <b>defenses</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> IBA {{regional}} title.

25|$|His fame {{brought him}} admirers and {{supporters}} from {{various parts of}} society. Signs demanding Chucho’s release or Mendizábel’s death appeared in Orizaba.

5|$|During the 1952 presidential election, the Eisenhower {{campaign}} toured Wisconsin with McCarthy. In {{a speech}} delivered in Green Bay, Eisenhower declared {{that while he}} agreed with McCarthy's goals, he disagreed with his methods. In draft versions of his speech, Eisenhower had also included a strong <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mentor, George Marshall, which was a direct rebuke of McCarthy's frequent attacks. However, under the advice of conservative colleagues who were fearful that Eisenhower could lose Wisconsin if he alienated McCarthy supporters, he deleted this defense from later versions of his speech. The deletion was discovered by William H. Laurence, a reporter for The New York Times, and featured on its front page the next day. Eisenhower was widely criticized for giving up his personal convictions, and the incident became the low point of his campaign.|$|E
5|$|For {{extraordinary}} heroism and conspicuous intrepidity {{above and}} {{beyond the call of duty}} during action against enemy Japanese forces off Savo Island on the night of 12–13 November 1942. Although out-balanced in strength and numbers by a desperate and determined enemy, Rear Admiral Callaghan, with ingenious tactical skill and superb coordination of the units under his command, led his forces into battle against tremendous odds, thereby contributing decisively to the rout of a powerful invasion fleet and to the consequent frustration of a formidable Japanese offensive. While faithfully directing close-range operations in the face of furious bombardment by superior enemy fire power, he was killed on the bridge of his Flagship. His courageous initiative, inspiring leadership, and judicious foresight in a crisis of grave responsibility were in keeping with the finest traditions of the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life in the <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> country.|$|E
5|$|India {{followed}} the NZ tour with {{a trip to}} Australia. India lost the Test series 3–0 and the margin of defeat was heavy {{in each of these}} matches – 285 runs, 180 runs, innings and 141 runs. The highlight of the Test series came in the final Test when V. V. S. Laxman scored 167 at a run a ball in fading light at the Sydney Cricket Ground and came for much praise from the media. India's ODI series performance matched the Test series in failure as India managed to win just one match against Pakistan and Kapil had to come out in <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> team.|$|E
50|$|He {{strengthened}} the <b>defenses</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> county by expanding his fortresses. He paid for these construction projects from {{the proceeds of}} church properties he had confiscated during the Reformation. The Order of St. John sued him about their confiscated possessions; after a lengthy trial, Anthony prevailed.|$|R
50|$|In 1978, he won {{all four}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> bouts, {{including}} successful <b>defenses</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> title against former world title challenger Richie Kates and against four-time world title challenger Yaqui López. The Lopez fight, their first of two, {{was considered a}} classic by boxing experts, Saad Muhammad surviving a relentless attack by López to score an 11th-round knockout.|$|R
5|$|Lasker's match {{record was}} as {{impressive}} between his 1896–97 re-match with Steinitz and 1914: he won {{all but one}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> normal matches, and three of those were convincing <b>defenses</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> title. He first faced Marshall in the World Chess Championship 1907, when despite his aggressive style, Marshall could not win a single game, losing eight and drawing seven (final score: 11½−3½).|$|R
5|$|Döblin's 1918 comic novel {{has been}} seen, in its {{experimental}} narrative technique, {{its refusal to}} psychologize its characters, and its depictions of Berlin as modern metropolis, as a precursor to Döblin's better-known Berlin Alexanderplatz. Wadzeks Kampf mit der Dampfturbine (Wadzek's Battle with the Steam Turbine) {{tells the story of}} Wadzek, a factory owner locked in a losing battle with a more powerful competitor. His futile and increasingly delusional countermeasures culminate in the fortification and quixotic <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> family's garden house in suburban Reinickendorf. Following the dissipation of this endeavor, he suffers a breakdown and finally flees the country, eloping aboard a steamship bound for America that is powered by the steam turbines of his victorious competitor. Döblin wrote the novel in the fall of 1914, submitting it to extensive stylistic revisions while serving as a doctor on the Western front; it was published in May 1918 by the Fischer Verlag. In its stringent refusal of a tragic tone, the book earned the praise of a young Bertolt Brecht.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was a Three Way {{match for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship between then-champion Samoa Joe and challengers Kaz and Scott Steiner. The match was {{initially}} promoted as Joe's <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> title against Kurt Angle and Steiner. However, Angle sustained an injury before the match that removed him from the bout; he was replaced with Kaz. Joe won the match, retaining the championship. The Deuces Wild Tag Team Tournament for the vacant TNA World Tag Team Championship was also held at Sacrifice. The Latin American Xchange (Hernandez and Homicide) defeated Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray) in the Finals to win the tournament and the championship. TNA featured two matches on the undercard: the TNA Knockouts Makeover Battle Royal for a future TNA Women's Knockout Championship match, and the debut of the TNA TerrorDome to determine who would compete in a future TNA X Division Championship match and take Angle's place in the main event. Gail Kim won the TNA Knockouts Makeover Battle Royal and Kaz won the latter.|$|E
5|$|Tigranes, who was {{residing}} at Tigranocerta in {{the summer}} of 69, was not only astonished by the speed of Lucullus' rapid advance into Armenia but {{by the fact that he}} had even launched such an operation in the first place. Unable to reconcile with this reality for a certain period of time, he belatedly sent a general named Mithrobarzanes with 2,000 to 3,000 cavalrymen to slow down Lucullus' advance but his forces were cut to pieces and routed by the 1,600 cavalry led by Sextilius, one of the legates serving under Lucullus. Learning of Mithrobarzanes' defeat, Tigranes entrusted the <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> namesake city to Mancaeus and left to recruit a fighting force in the Taurus Mountains. Nevertheless, Lucullus' legates were able to disrupt two separate detachments coming to the aid of Tigranes and even located and engaged the king's forces in a canyon in the Taurus. Lucullus, nevertheless, chose not to pursue Tigranes while he had an unimpeded path towards Tigranocerta; he advanced and began to lay siege to it.|$|E
5000|$|Larsen {{went on to}} win {{his next}} 10 {{straight}} fights, including three <b>defenses</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> IBO title.

50|$|Ayala {{only had}} two fights in 1996, both <b>of</b> them {{successful}} <b>defenses</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> NABF title.

Returning to the ring in September, Ayala defeated Ivan Alvarez by decision in twelve to retain the NABF bantamweight title.|$|R
5|$|Confident {{that the}} results of the 1795 {{election}} would be reversed, Benjamin Logan was the first to declare his candidacy for the governorship in 1799. Garrard and Thomas Todd declared their respective candidacies soon after. Former U.S. Representative Christopher Greenup also sought the office. Many of the recent settlers in Kentucky were unaware of his illustrious military record and unimpressed with his unsophisticated speaking skills. Although the candidates themselves rarely spoke negatively of each other, opponents of each candidate independently raised issues that they felt would hurt that candidate. John Breckinridge, Garrard's long-time political nemesis, tried to goad Garrard into making another impassioned plea for emancipation of slaves, which was a minority position in the state, but Garrard recognized Breckinridge's tactics and refused to express any bold emancipationist sentiments during the campaign. The fact that the slavery protections in the new constitution were even stronger than those in the previous document ensured that the incumbent's previous anti-slavery sentiments were not a major concern to most of the electorate. The family of Henry Field, a prominent leader in Frankfort, attacked Garrard for not issuing a pardon for Field, who was convicted of murdering his wife with an ax. After examining the evidence in the case, Garrard concluded that the verdict was reached justly and without undue outside influence, but the charge was raised so late in the campaign that Garrard's <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> refusal to issue a pardon could not be circulated widely.|$|E
5|$|On 23 June, Devitt, Taguchi and Hirooki Goto {{won their}} second J Sports Crown Openweight 6 Man Tag Tournament {{in a row}} by {{defeating}} the team of Giant Bernard, Jushin Thunder Liger and Karl Anderson in the finals of the three-day-long tournament. On 24 July, Devitt received his rematch for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship at a DDT event, {{but was unable to}} regain the title from Ibushi. This led to a match on 14 August, where Apollo 55 successfully defended the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship against the Golden☆Lovers. On 11 September, Apollo 55 defeated Taichi and Taka Michinoku to make their seventh successful IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship defense, breaking the record for most defenses during a single reign. When Kota Ibushi was forced to vacate the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship after dislocating his left shoulder, Devitt, as the previous champion, was ushered into a decision match to determine a new champion. On 19 September, Devitt defeated Kushida to win the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship for the second time. On 10 October at Destruction '11, Devitt and Taguchi lost the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship to the No Remorse Corps (Davey Richards and Rocky Romero). Devitt made the first successful title <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> second IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship reign on 12 November at Power Struggle, defeating Taka Michinoku, and followed that up by defeating the man who had pinned him for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship, Davey Richards, in his second defense on 4 December. On 23 December, Devitt defeated the other half of No Remorse Corps, Rocky Romero, to make his third IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship defense. On 4 January 2012 at Wrestle Kingdom VI in Tokyo Dome, Devitt and Taguchi defeated Richards and Romero to once again regain the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship, starting Devitt's record-breaking sixth reign as one half of the champions. On 12 February at The New Beginning, Apollo 55 lost the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship back to the No Remorse Corps in their first defense. This led to a match on 10 March, where Devitt defeated Davey Richards to make his fourth successful defense of the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship.|$|E
5|$|Upon Carroll's {{return to}} Maryland, Hart was incensed {{both at the}} threat to his own power {{and the idea of}} a Catholic officeholder in the colony. Hart demanded that Carroll take the oath of allegiance, which he was willing to do, and the oath of abjuration {{confirming}} the Protestant succession to the English throne, which Carroll was not willing to do. Carroll began to act in the capacity authorized by the proprietor's commission, and Hart turned to the upper house of the colonial legislature for relief. Rejecting Carroll's arguments in support of his right to hold government offices, the assembly resisted his attempts to exercise the commission and, near the end of 1716, passed a series of laws confirming and restricting the oath requirements for officeholders, which were anti-Catholic by intent. Carroll's case may have been undermined {{when he came to the}} <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> nephew, who had raised a toast to the Catholic James Stuart. Stuart had tried to take the British throne during a rebellion in 1715 and was extremely unpopular with Protestants in the colony. The proprietor, whose position had been so recently restored and who did not want to risk the loss of the colony, confirmed the decision of the assembly. Carroll's commission was formally revoked on 20 February 1717. According to a later account Hart gave to the assembly, Carroll began a campaign to undermine the Governor. There is no evidence that Hart was accurate, but the assembly passed stricter anti-Catholic laws in 1718, including disfranchisement, stripping Catholic males of the right to vote.|$|E
