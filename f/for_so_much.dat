No doubt the need <b>for</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> industry is sufficiently comparable to the tactics we still observe today to sway groups of people. Motivating egalitarian to heirarchial change must have occurred for it to happen, without violence the evidence suggests placation. Not a greatly dominating ruling class of royalty, early politicians before the Republic of Rome.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} of Kreacher the house-elf, who {{was included in}} the script only at Rowling's request, has a larger part in the book than the film. In the novel, he is seen saving some of the Black family's artefacts which the Order of the Phoenix throw away, one of which is a locket which becomes extremely important in the seventh book. [...] "It was kind of tricky to raise that in our story, because it's <b>for</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> later", Yates said. [...] "We figured we can probably introduce it later, and that's the approach we took". Whilst Kreacher remained, all scenes involving Dobby were cut, and his important actions given to other characters.|$|E

500|$|Historian Hans Trefousse {{stated in}} a 1969 {{study of the}} Radical Republicans that Stevens's [...] "one abiding passion was equality." [...] In 1991, he noted that Stevens [...] "was {{one of the most}} {{influential}} representatives ever to serve in Congress. [...] the House with his wit, knowledge of parliamentary law, and sheer willpower, even though he was often unable to prevail." [...] In his 1997 biography of Stevens, though, he took a position similar to McKitrick's: that Stevens was a relatively marginal figure, with his influence often limited by his extremism. Trefousse believed that Brodie went too far both in deeming Stevens's clubfoot responsible <b>for</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> about him, and in giving full credence to the Stevens-Smith relationship: both those things cannot now be determined with certainty.|$|E
500|$|Descending to {{the actual}} site made both Cameron and crew want [...] "to {{live up to that}} level of reality.... But there was another level of {{reaction}} coming away from the real wreck, which was that it wasn't just a story, it wasn't just a drama," [...] he said. [...] "It was an event that happened to real people who really died. Working around the wreck <b>for</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> time, you get such a strong sense of the profound sadness and injustice of it, and the message of it." [...] Cameron stated, [...] "You think, 'There probably aren't going to be many filmmakers who go to Titanic. There may never be another one – maybe a documentarian." [...] Due to this, he felt [...] "a great mantle of responsibility to convey the emotional message of it – to do that part of it right, too".|$|E
500|$|To avoid {{confusion}} with Larter and Carter, Cook {{was required to}} dye her hair brown for the role. [...] "I like being a chameleon. It opens you up <b>for</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> more in this work. You don't get typecast," [...] Cook professed. Landes also denied plots regarding Thomas and Kimberly's relationship. [...] "It's kind of a protected relationship, more like a brother/sister thing than a love interest. They didn’t want to go there, I guess. They did go that way in an earlier draft of the script but they didn’t want it to seem like the cop is like lascivious or something. So what they have now, hopefully, {{is a little bit}} of chemistry and you get the idea that through tragedy something good will come. So it ends in an optimistic way, that maybe they can be together but there’s no real love story," [...] Landes articulated.|$|E

500|$|When the Beagle {{returned}} on 2 October 1836, Darwin {{was already}} a celebrity in scientific circles, as in December 1835 University of Cambridge Professor of Botany John Stevens Henslow had fostered his former pupil's reputation by giving selected naturalists a pamphlet of Darwin's geological letters. Charles Lyell eagerly met Darwin {{for the first time}} on 29 October, enthusiastic about the support this gave to his uniformitarianism, and in May wrote to John Herschel that he was [...] "very full of Darwin's new theory of Coral Islands, and have urged Whewell to make him read it at our next meeting. I must give up my volcanic crater theory for ever, though it cost me a pang at first, for it accounted <b>for</b> <b>so</b> <b>much...</b> the whole theory is knocked on the head, and the annular shape and central lagoon have nothing to do with volcanoes, nor even with a crateriform bottom.... Coral islands are the last efforts of drowning continents to lift their heads above water. Regions of elevation and subsidence in the ocean may be traced by the state of the coral reefs." [...] Darwin presented his findings and theory in a paper which he read to the Geological Society of London on 31 May 1837.|$|E

Sutcliffe expressed the view that if W G Grace {{was as good as}} Jack Hobbs, [...] "then he must have been wonderful".

2500|$|Like Wooden, Scates {{established}} himself as an innovator, changing a deliberate game to the fast paced sport it is today. [...] "Until the late ’60s, the game was a very slow game,” Scates said. [...] "You didn’t try to deceive anybody. You just tried to set a high ball to the outside and if your hitter {{was better than the}} blockers you scored a point. By the late 1960s we started setting very quick here at UCLA. We started running an offense that is still being run today.” Said USC coach Bill Ferguson “He is responsible <b>for</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> of our sport’s development that we {{will never be able to}} fathom what he did to promote our game. He is the best in-game tactician there ever was.” ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{a part of}} a {{phenomenon}} known as [...] "Christmas creep", radio stations—responsible <b>for</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> of Christmas music broadcasting, popularization, and appreciation—are [...] "going Christmas" [...] earlier each year. Many stations now start rolling out holiday music in early November instead of Thanksgiving or Black Friday (and a select few, such as WEZW since 2011, have earned a reputation for beginning their Christmas music as early as October), because programmers [...] "think that listeners will stick with the first station to change to a seasonal theme." [...] About 400 radio stations [...] "across the U.S. play Christmas music around the clock." [...] In Chicago, WLIT-FM saw its share of all radio listeners grow from a 2.9/3.6 share earlier in the year to 9.3 during the Nov. 28 to Dec. 11, 2003 Arbitron rating period. A 2002 Arbitron ratings study confirmed holiday-music surges at stations around the country.|$|E

2500|$|In late 1949, Bates {{auditioned for}} the small role of Phoebe in Fox's {{upcoming}} All About Eve. In competition for the part was Zsa Zsa Gabor and others, but Bates impressed the producers and was given the part. She made a short but important appearance as the devious schemer, Phoebe, {{at the end of}} the film. Bates' image is enshrined in the film's last scene, posing in front of a three-way mirror, while holding the award won by her idol Eve Harrington, played by Anne Baxter. This memorable final scene left critics and audiences intrigued by the young actress, who they thought would star in a sequel to All About Eve. The Hollywood Reporter said of her performance, [...] "Barbara Bates comes on the screen in the last few moments to more or less sum up the whole action and point of the story. It's odd that a bit should count <b>for</b> <b>so</b> <b>much,</b> and in the hands of Miss Bates all the required points are fulfilled." ...|$|E
2500|$|Aeschylus gained {{thirteen}} victories as a dramatist, Sophocles {{at least}} twenty, Euripides only four in his lifetime, {{and this has}} often been taken {{as an indication of}} the latter's unpopularity with his contemporaries, and yet a first place might not have been the main criterion for success in those times (the system of selecting judges appears to have been flawed) and merely being chosen to compete was in itself a mark of distinction. Moreover, to have been singled out by Aristophanes <b>for</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> comic attention is proof of popular interest in his work. Sophocles was appreciative enough of the younger poet to be influenced by him, as is evident in his later plays Philoctetes and Oedipus at Colonus. Less than a hundred years later, Aristotle developed an almost [...] "biological' theory of the development of tragedy in Athens: according to this view, the art form grew under the influence of Aeschylus, matured in the hands of Sophocles then began its precipitous decline with Euripides. However, [...] "his plays continued to be applauded even after those of Aeschylus and Sophocles had come to seem remote and irrelevant", they became school classics in the Hellenistic period (as mentioned in the introduction) and, due to Seneca's adaptation of his work for Roman audiences, [...] "it was Euripides, not Aeschylus or Sophocles, whose tragic muse presided over the rebirth of tragedy in Renaissance Europe." ...|$|E
