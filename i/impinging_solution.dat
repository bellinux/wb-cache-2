40|$|Rapid freeze-quench (RFQ) {{trapping}} of short-lived reaction intermediates for spectroscopic study {{plays an}} important role in the characterization of biological reactions. Recently there has been considerable effort to achieve submillisecond reaction deadtimes. We present here a new, robust, high-velocity microfluidic mixer that enables such rapid freeze-quenching. It is a based on the mixing method of two impinging jets commonly used in reaction injection molding (RIM) of plastics. This method achieves efficient mixing by inducing chaotic flow at relatively low Reynolds numbers (Re = 140). We present the first mathematical simulation and microscopic visualization of mixing in such RFQ micromixers, the results of which show that the <b>impinging</b> <b>solutions</b> efficiently mix within the mixing chamber. These tests, along with a practical demonstration in a RFQ setup that involves copper wheels, show this new mixer can in practice provide reaction deadtimes as low as 100 microseconds...|$|R
30|$|If {{producing}} Au NPs at {{the condition}} without stirring, the solution at the interfacial region turns from colorless to red rapidly at once as the plasma <b>impinges</b> on the <b>solution,</b> and then {{followed by the}} solution nearby the interfacial region turns red, finally the whole solution becomes red. The phenomenon reveals that the Au NPs produced at the interfacial region diffuse slowly from the interfacial region to the other place of the solution if no stirring is performed during the Au NPs production. However, while producing Au NPs at the condition with stirring, the whole solution turns from colorless to pale red at once as the plasma <b>impinges</b> on the <b>solution</b> and becomes red as the processing time is going on. This clearly illustrates that the Au NPs are thus produced and quickly diffused from the interfacial region to the other regions within the solution, i.e., the residence time of NPs at the interfacial region decreases due to stirring. Obviously, stirring decreases the residence time of Au NPs at the interfacial region and restrains the agglomeration {{and the growth of}} Au NPs at the interfacial region and is good for the production of Au NPs enjoying the small and uniform size.|$|R

Even flimsy First World War aircraft often took a surprisingly large number of hits to shoot down: later and larger aircraft were of course much harder propositions again. There were two obvious solutions: to increase the cyclic rate of fire of the gun(s), and {{to increase the number}} of guns carried. Both of these <b>solutions</b> <b>impinged</b> on the question of synchronization.|$|R
40|$|The local {{environmental}} conditions in biofilms {{are dependent on}} the <b>impinging</b> aqueous <b>solution,</b> chemical diffusion, and the metabolic activities of cells within the biofilms. Chemical gradients established in biofilms lead to physiological heterogeneities in bacterial gene expression. Previously, we used laser capture microdis-section (LCM) and quantitative reverse transcription (RT) -PCR to target defined biofilm subpopulations for gene expression studies. Here, we combined this approach with quantitative PCR of bacterial DNA to nor-malize the amount of gene expression per cell. By comparing the ratio of 16 S rRNA to 16 S rDNA (rRNA gene), we demonstrated that cells {{at the top of}} thick Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms have 16 S rRNA/genome ratios similar to those of cells in a transition from the exponential phase to the stationary phase. Cells in the middle and bottom layers of these biofilms have ratios that are not significantly different from those of stationary-phase planktonic cultures. Since much of each biofilm appeared to be in a stationary-phase-like state, we analyzed the local amounts of the stationary-phase sigma factor rpoS gene and the quorum-sensing regulator rhlR gene per cell. Surprisingly, the amount of rpoS mRNA was largest {{at the top of the}} biofilms at the air-biofilm interface. Less than one rpoS mRNA transcript per cell was observed in the middle or base of the biofilms. The rhlR mRNA content was also greatest at the top of the biofilms, and there was little detectable rhlR expression at the middle or bottom of the biofilms. While the cell density was slightly greater at the botto...|$|R
40|$|When plane-polarized light <b>impinges</b> on a <b>solution</b> of {{optically}} active molecules, {{the polarization}} {{of the light}} that emerges is rotated. This simple phenomenon arises from the interaction of light with matter and is well understood, in principle, van't Hoff's rule of optical superposition correlates the molar rotation with the individual contributions to optical activity of isolated centers of asymmetry. This straightforward empirical additivity rule is rarely used for structure elucidation nowadays because of its limitations {{in the assessment of}} conformationally restricted or interacting chiral centers. However, additivity can be used successfully to assign the configuration of complex natural products such as hennoxazole A if appropriate synthetic partial structures are available. Therefore, van't Hoff's principle is a powerful stereochemical complement to natural products' total synthesis. The quest for reliable quantitative methods to calculate the angle of rotation a priori has been underway for a long time. Both classical and quantum methods for calculating molar rotation have been developed. Of particular practical importance for determining the absolute structure of molecules by calculation is the manner in which interactions between multiple chiral centers in a single molecule are included, leading to additive or non-additive optical rotation angles. This problem is addressed here using semi-empirical electronic structure models and the Rosenfeld equation...|$|R
40|$|Photoacoustics {{has emerged}} as a tool for the study of liquid gel {{suspension}} behavior and has been recently employed in a number of new biomedical applications. In this paper, a photoacoustic sensor is presented which was designed and realized for analyzing photothermal signals from solutions filled with microbubbles, commonly used as ultrasound contrast agents in echographic imaging techniques. It is a closed cell device, where photothermal volume variation of an aqueous solution produces the periodic deflection of a thin membrane closing the cell {{at the end of a}} short pipe. The cell then acts as a Helmholtz resonator, where the displacement of the membrane is measured through a laser probe interferometer, whereas photoacoustic signal is generated by a laser chopped light beam <b>impinging</b> onto the <b>solution</b> through a glass window. Particularly, the microbubble shell has been modeled through an effective surface tension parameter, which has been then evaluated from experimental data through the shift of the resonance frequencies of the photoacoustic sensor. This shift of the resonance frequencies of the photoacoustic sensor caused by microbubble solutions is high enough for making such a cell a reliable tool for testing ultrasound contrast agent, particularly for bubble shell characterization.

40|$|The microjet {{electrode}} (MJE) is {{a recently}} introduced hydrodynamic electrode {{in which a}} jet of <b>solution</b> <b>impinges</b> on a disc ultramicroelectrode (UME) under conditions of well defined, variable and high mass-transfer rates. It is shown that these properties make MJE voltammetry a powerful technique for characterising rapid electron-transfer kinetics under steady-state conditions. The MJE approach is illustrated through studies of the hexacyanoferrate(II/III) couple in aqueous strontium nitrate solutions (0. 2 mol dm(- 3)). The standard rate constant {{is found to be}} 0. 76 +/- 0. 11 cm s(- 1) and the transfer coefficient is in the range 0. 35 - 0. 55. Complementary mass-transfer imaging experiments, in which the transport-limited current at the UME is monitored {{as a function of the}} nozzle position, as a jet of solution is scanned over the electrode surface in a raster pattern, are shown to provide useful information on the positioning requirements of the MJE and a unique insight into the nature of mass transfer from an impinging jet. The spatial variation of local mass transfer deduced from these experiments is found to be in qualitative agreement with the theoretical predictions for the fluid velocity profile of the impinging jet under laminar flow conditions...|$|R
40|$|The microjet {{electrode}} (MJE) is a hydrodynamic electrode {{in which}} a fine jet of <b>solution</b> <b>impinges</b> from a nozzle on an ultramicroelectrode (UME) under conditions of variable and high mass transfer rates. An assessment is made as to whether this methodology-hitherto employed with solid disk electrodes alone-can be {{used in conjunction with}} hemispherical mercury electrodes grown on Pt UMEs. Mass transfer imaging experiments, in which the transport-limited current at the Hg UME is monitored as a function of nozzle position, demonstrate that local mass transfer rates from the impinging jet are similar to those measured earlier at disk electrodes, When the electrode and nozzle are configured to produce the maximum mass transfer rates, the transport-limited current-now rate characteristics, at low to intermediate now velocities, are shown to be well-defined and predictable, by analogy to the rotating hemisphere electrode. At higher now rates, the electrode becomes physically unstable and eventually detaches from the Pt UME, Within the physically stable region, mass transfer coefficients up to 0. 2 cm s(- 1) are readily attainable, making the device attractive for both electroanalysis and kinetic applications. In particular, the use of the Hg hemisphere MJE for stripping analysis is shown to greatly increase the efficiency of the preconcentration step, compared to Hg UMEs in stationary solution or alternative how configurations...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{ready-to-use}} therapeutic food (RUTF) {{has emerged}} as a highly successful cure for severe acute malnutrition in children, a condition that contributes to about one million child deaths per year. Advocates have raised concerns, however, that patent rights are obstructing access to needed RUTF. The first RUTF, a product called Plumpy’nut, was patented shortly after its invention. Evidence suggests that patent protection of Plumpy’nut is in fact limiting global RUTF supply and preventing RUTF price reductions. Because evidence also demonstrates that patent rents are likely to be of lesser importance for incentivizing innovation in the therapeutic food industry, solutions for broadening access should be explored, even if such <b>solutions</b> <b>impinge</b> on patent holders’ exclusive patent rights. This paper considers the prospect of using compulsory licensing to facilitate broader access to RUTF. Compulsory licensing could be a useful tool for expanding the RUTF supplier base and driving down prices. Because the circumstances leading to nutritional crises can simultaneously disrupt local manufacturing, the availability of compulsory licensing for the export of RUTF, in particular, is desirable. At present, however, the WTO international treaty regime largely prevents the export of RUTF under compulsory licensing for WTO Members. This paper argues for easing the current restrictions on the use of compulsory licensing for the export of RUTF as an act that would be consistent with the rationale and spirit of existing agreements among WTO Members relating to intellectual property and public health...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2005 Over the years, {{chemical}} bath deposition (CBD) {{is being}} {{widely used in}} the fabrication of Cu (In, Ga) Se₂ and CdTe based solar cells and photovoltaics. Many chalcogenides have been successfully deposited by this technique and it has received {{a great deal of}} attention owing to its low temperature and low-cost nature. CdS, an important layer in heterojunction solar cells and other optoelectronic devices, has been successfully deposited by this technique, which is normally carried out as a batch process. But a major disadvantage of batch CBD is the formation of particles and also unwanted deposition generating a lot of waste and thus resulting in defective devices. In this study, we have developed a continuous flow microreactor for CBD to overcome the drawbacks of batch process. This novel microreactor setup makes use of a micromixer for efficient mixing of the reactant streams and helps in controlling the particle size and distribution before the <b>solution</b> <b>impinges</b> on the hot substrate. CdS semiconductor thin films were successfully deposited on oxidized silicon substrates using the microreactor setup and a batch reactor as well. Comparisons of nanostructured thin films were performed by various characterization techniques. The surface morphology of the deposited films, carried out by AFM, SEM and Dektak surface profiler, clearly indicated an improved film quality in case of microreactor. This setup can also be used to deposit various other compound semiconductor thin films with improved film quality and minimum waste production...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{focuses on}} {{an investigation of the}} erosion-corrosion behaviour of Cu-Ni-base alloys in aqueous environments. The principal objectives of the research were to examine the fundamental mechanisms of the erosion-corrosion attack. The work was focused on a standard Cu- 10 %Ni alloy that is used extensively in a variety of marine industries and on Marinel alloy, which is a high strength precipitation-hardened copper-nickel alloy. Erosion-corrosion tests were carried out for exposure times up to 72 hours, in a solid free 3. 5 % NaCl <b>solution</b> <b>impinging</b> at velocities of 2. 38 - 86 m/sec, (Re= 4500 - 86000), at temperatures of 19 °C and 35 °C. The overall erosion-corrosion behaviour and the direct corrosion component were monitored using gravimetric and electrochemical-monitoring techniques. Contributes from mechanical erosions were assessed by cathodically protecting specimens under impingement conditions. The research also considered the influence of various parameters such as temperature, time, velocity, salinity variations, and impingement angle. The extent and morphology of material deterioration and protective film formation under various environmental conditions were assessed, utilizing surface profiling equipment and light optical and scanning electron microscopy. The work has quantified the complex contributions of corrosion, erosion and synergy to the overall erosion-corrosion material loss. An important finding was the substantial superior erosion-corrosion resistance of Marinel compared to the standard Cu- 10 %Ni, with interesting effects of impinging velocity and time of exposure being observed. Also this work provided some clear evidence of significant potential benefits in terms of erosion-corrosion resistance, obtained by the exposure of Marinel at the elevated temperature...|$|R
