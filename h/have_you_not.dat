During the period 1142–1148 Chesney forced Gloucester Abbey, then under the abbacy of his nephew Gilbert Foliot, to pay him sums of money. Foliot, {{in one of his}} surviving letters, reprimanded his uncle for his behaviour, asking him [...] "Which of God's poor around you <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> harmed?" [...] In 1147, Chesney granted the island of Medley to Osney Abbey in the name of his father and brother Roger, as well as King Stephen, Queen Matilda and their son Eustace. After 1148, Chesney apparently began to hedge his bets as he appears in the company of Roger of Hereford, the Earl of Hereford, who was a firm supporter of Matilda's and her son Henry's cause.|$|E

2500|$|On June 29, after {{a hearing}} lasting 7 days, Andre Martin was acquitted; Pierre Martin, Marie Martin and Rochette {{were found guilty}} of only one murder, that of Enjolras, and were sentenced to death. After the {{rejection}} of their appeal, and of a plea for clemency to King Louis Philippe, they were returned {{to the scene of}} their crime in order to be guillotined in front of their inn by the executioner Pierre Roch and his nephew Nicolas. The execution took place on October 2, 1833, at noon as the bell of Lavillatte rang the angelus. [...] When Rochette was about to be executed, he cried, [...] "Cursed masters, what <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> made me do!"

Paul d'Albigny reports in his book about the Red Inn that, on the day of the execution, a ball was organized in front of the premises.|$|E
