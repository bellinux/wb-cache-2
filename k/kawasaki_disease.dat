5|$|Along with rheumatic fever, <b>Kawasaki</b> <b>disease</b> {{remains one}} of the few {{indications}} for aspirin use in children in spite of a lack of high quality evidence for its effectiveness.|$|E
5|$|In {{children}} with <b>Kawasaki</b> <b>disease,</b> aspirin is taken at dosages based on body weight, initially {{four times a}} day for up to two weeks and then at a lower dose once daily for a further six to eight weeks.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of a number of conditions, including fever, pain, rheumatic fever, and inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, pericarditis, and <b>Kawasaki</b> <b>disease.</b> Lower doses of aspirin have also been shown {{to reduce the risk of}} death from a heart attack, or the risk of stroke in some circumstances. There is some evidence that aspirin is effective at preventing colorectal cancer, though the mechanisms of this effect are unclear. In the United States low dose aspirin is deemed reasonable in those between 50 and 70 years old who have a more than 10% risk of cardiovascular disease and are not at an increased risk of bleeding who are otherwise healthy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Kawasaki's</b> <b>disease</b> {{is another}} {{important}} differential, especially in its incomplete form. Scarlet fever appears similar to <b>Kawasaki's</b> <b>disease</b> in some aspects, but lacks the eye signs or the swollen, red fingers and toes. However, the signs of <b>Kawasaki's</b> <b>disease</b> may manifest over a few days, rather than at initial presentation. Complications of missed <b>Kawasaki's</b> <b>disease</b> are significant but rare, and include a 1-2% death rate and coronary artery aneurysms.|$|R
40|$|Atypical {{presentations of}} <b>Kawasaki’s</b> <b>disease</b> have been {{described}} {{in the form of}} intestinal pseudo-obstruction, tonsillitis, hemorrhagic serous effusions, thrombocytopenia, and non-fulfillment of all criteria for diagnosis of <b>Kawasaki’s</b> <b>disease.</b> However, presentation of <b>Kawasaki’s</b> <b>disease</b> with shock and need for ionotropic support have been rarely described. We present a 4 -year-old girl with <b>Kawasaki’s</b> <b>disease</b> who presented with anasarca, oliguria, shock, and presence of dilated coronary arteries within 5 days of fever and responded to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and inotropic support...|$|R
40|$|Sudden {{cardiac arrest}} in adolescence: {{the case of}} {{ventricular}} fibrillation 11 years after presenting with <b>Kawasaki’s</b> <b>disease</b> A previously asymptomatic, 16 -year-old male from China presented following a cardiac arrest. He had a past medical history of <b>Kawasaki’s</b> <b>disease</b> with no known sequelae. Following 6 min of bystander resuscitation, a 200 J DC shock was delivered for VF, with return of circulation. An ECG demonstrated anterior ST elevation (figure 1 A). On arrival in hospital, he was haemodynamically stable, and an initial echo-cardiogram showed preserved LV function. Given the ECG changes and his past history, he was transferred for urgent coronary angiography (figure 1 B,C). At {{the end of the}} procedure his condition deteriorated with a rise in his LVEDP, a fall in his blood pressure and recurrent ST elevation. A repeat echocardio-gram demonstrated severe global LV impairment. An intra-aortic balloon pump was inserted and the patient underwent urgent bypass grafting with two vein grafts to LAD and RCA. He made an excellent recovery without neurological deficit. A cardiac magnetic resonance scan demonstrated recovery in left ventric-ular function without evidence of scar (figure 1 D). We report this unique case demonstrating the successful treatment of 16 -year-old patient with chronic coronary artery occlusions secondary to <b>Kawasaki’s</b> <b>disease.</b> <b>Kawasaki’s</b> <b>disease</b> is an acute vasculitis usually affecting young children. Cardiac sequelae include coronary aneurysms, myocarditis, pericarditis, coronary thrombosis and accelerated atherosclerosis. 1 Cardiac arrest associated with <b>Kawasaki’s</b> <b>disease</b> has only previously been described in the context of acute infarction. 2 This case demonstrates that catastrophic sequelae are possible years after the acute illness in previously asymptomatic patients. This emphasises the need for vigilant follow-up of all patients with <b>Kawasaki’s</b> <b>disease...</b>|$|R
5|$|Aspirin, {{also known}} as acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), is a {{medication}} used to treat pain, fever, or inflammation. Specific inflammatory conditions in which aspirin is used include <b>Kawasaki</b> <b>disease,</b> pericarditis, and rheumatic fever. Aspirin given shortly {{after a heart attack}} decreases the risk of death. Aspirin is also used long-term to help prevent heart attacks, ischaemic strokes, and blood clots, in people at high risk. Aspirin may also decrease the risk of certain types of cancer, particularly colorectal cancer. For pain or fever, effects typically begin within 30 minutes. Aspirin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and works similar to other NSAIDs but also suppresses the normal functioning of platelets.|$|E
25|$|<b>Kawasaki</b> <b>disease</b> may {{be further}} {{classified}} as a medium-sized-vessel vasculitis, affecting medium- and small-sized blood vessels, such as the smaller cutaneous vasculature (veins and arteries in the skin) that range from 50 to 100µm in diameter. <b>Kawasaki</b> <b>disease</b> is also {{considered to be a}} primary childhood vasculitis, a disorder associated with vasculitis that mainly affects {{children under the age of}} 18. A recent, consensus-based evaluation of vasculitides occurring primarily in children resulted in a classification scheme for these disorders, to distinguish them and suggest a more concrete set of diagnostic criteria for each. Within this classification of childhood vasculitides, <b>Kawasaki</b> <b>disease</b> is, again, a predominantly medium-sized vessel vasculitis.|$|E
25|$|A relapse of {{symptoms}} may occur soon after initial treatment with IVIG. This usually requires rehospitalization and retreatment. Treatment with IVIG can cause allergic and nonallergic acute reactions, aseptic meningitis, fluid overload and, rarely, other serious reactions. Overall, life-threatening complications resulting from therapy for <b>Kawasaki</b> <b>disease</b> are exceedingly rare, especially {{compared with the}} risk of nontreatment. Also, evidence indicates <b>Kawasaki</b> <b>disease</b> produces altered lipid metabolism that persists beyond the clinical resolution of the disease.|$|E
50|$|Generally, {{it has a}} good prognosis. In <b>Kawasaki's</b> <b>disease,</b> untreated, {{there is}} a 1-2% death rate, from cardiac causes.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTObjectiveTo {{develop an}} {{ultrasound}} study protocol to establish cardiovascular {{risk in the}} pediatric population. Materials and methodsAn ultrasound protocol to assess cardiovascular risk was developed to evaluate vascular reactivity in the pediatric population. ResultsFifty pediatric patients were recruited between January and June 2012. Eleven patients {{had a history of}} <b>Kawasaki’s</b> <b>disease,</b> and 40 patients with no history of cardiovascular risk. In 17 patients with no history of cardiovascular disease, the test could not be fully performed due to lack of collaboration. The mean age of the healthy subjects was 75 months, and in patients with <b>Kawasaki’s</b> <b>disease</b> it was 68 months. The test performed included vascular physical and functional parameters. The test did not find {{significant differences between the two}} populations, although a trend of increasing pulse wave velocity associated with reduced distensibility was found in patients with <b>Kawasaki’s</b> <b>disease</b> compared to the healthy subjects. ConclusionsThis protocol can be routinely performed in cooperative patients but is limited in children under thirty months of age due to lack of collaboration. No significant differences between the normal and cardiovascular risk population were found. An increase in the sample size is necessary in order to assess the observed trend...|$|R
50|$|It is {{commonly}} used for a differential diagnosis for <b>Kawasaki's</b> <b>disease</b> (from Takayasu's arteritis; which would have a markedly elevated ESR) {{and it may be}} increased in some chronic infective conditions like tuberculosis and infective endocarditis. It is also elevated in subacute thyroiditis also known as DeQuervain's.|$|R
25|$|A {{question}} was raised whether the disease only started {{during the period}} between 1960 and 1970, but later a preserved heart of a seven-year-old boy who died in 1870 was examined and showed three aneurysms of the coronary arteries with clots, as well as pathologic changes consistent with <b>Kawasaki</b> <b>disease.</b> <b>Kawasaki</b> <b>disease</b> is now recognized worldwide. In the United States and other developed nations, {{it appears to have}} replaced acute rheumatic fever as {{the most common cause of}} acquired heart disease in children.|$|E
25|$|With early treatment, rapid {{recovery}} from the acute symptoms can be expected, {{and the risk of}} coronary artery aneurysms is greatly reduced. Untreated, the acute symptoms of <b>Kawasaki</b> <b>disease</b> are self-limited (i.e. the patient will recover eventually), but the risk of coronary artery involvement is much greater. Overall, about 2% of patients die from complications of coronary vasculitis. Patients who have had <b>Kawasaki</b> <b>disease</b> should have an echocardiogram initially every few weeks, and then every one or two years to screen for progression of cardiac involvement.|$|E
25|$|IFN-α {{is another}} product of {{prolonged}} SAg exposure. This cytokine is closely linked with induction of autoimmunity, and the autoimmune disease <b>Kawasaki</b> <b>Disease</b> {{is known to}} be caused by SAg infection.|$|E
40|$|A boy of 12 years died {{suddenly}} of myocardial infarction, which {{was due to}} coronary artery aneurysm typical of Kawasaki's arteritis. Two years earlier he had an obscure illness, recognised retrospectively as incomplete <b>Kawasaki's</b> <b>disease.</b> We recommend routine echocardiography even if {{only one or two}} features of the syndrome are present...|$|R
40|$|Although it {{is known}} that obesity, diabetes, and <b>Kawasaki's</b> <b>disease</b> play {{important}} roles in systemic inflammation and in the development of both endothelial dysfunction and cardiomyopathy, {{there is a lack of}} data regarding the endothelial function of pre-pubertal children suffering from cardiomyopathy. In this study, we performed a systematic review of the literature on pre-pubertal children at risk of developing cardiomyopathy to assess the endothelial function of pre-pubertal children at risk of developing cardiomyopathy. We searched the published literature indexed in PubMed, Bireme and SciELO using the keywords ‘endothelial', ‘children', ‘pediatric' and ‘infant' and then compiled a systematic review. The end points were age, the pubertal stage, sex differences, the method used for the endothelial evaluation and the endothelial values themselves. No studies on children with cardiomyopathy were found. Only 11 papers were selected for our complete analysis, where these included reports on the flow-mediated percentage dilatation, the values of which were 9. 80 ± 1. 80, 5. 90 ± 1. 29, 4. 50 ± 0. 70, and 7. 10 ± 1. 27 for healthy, obese, diabetic and pre-pubertal children with <b>Kawasaki's</b> <b>disease,</b> respectively. There was no significant difference in the dilatation, independent of the endothelium, either among the groups or between the genders for both of the measurements in children; similar results have been found in adolescents and adults. The endothelial function in cardiomyopathic children remains unclear because of the lack of data; nevertheless, the known dysfunctions in children with obesity, type 1 diabetes and <b>Kawasaki's</b> <b>disease</b> may influence the severity of the cardiovascular symptoms, the prognosis, and the mortality rate. The results of this study encourage future research into the consequences of endothelial dysfunction in pre-pubertal children...|$|R
40|$|Coronary artery {{dilatation}} {{may be due}} {{to various}} aetiologies including congenital anomalies, atherosclerotic coronary <b>disease,</b> and <b>Kawasakis</b> <b>disease.</b> We describe a case characterised by apparent severe dilatation of the right coronary artery ostium in an asymptomatic male. Subsequent imaging and surgical intervention documented the presence of a sinus of Valsalva aneurysm extending into the ostium of the right coronary artery. This represents an unusual manifestation of a sinus of Valsalva aneurysm. The underlying pathophysiology, differential diagnosis, role of surgical management, and outcomes are discussed...|$|R
25|$|In the {{continental}} United States, <b>Kawasaki</b> <b>Disease</b> {{is more common}} during the winter and early spring, boys with the disease outnumber girls by ≈1.5–1.7:1, and 76% of affected children are <5 years of age.|$|E
25|$|Non-infectious {{diseases}} {{that may result}} in symptoms {{similar to those of}} EVD include acute promyelocytic leukemia, hemolytic uremic syndrome, snake envenomation, clotting factor deficiencies/platelet disorders, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, <b>Kawasaki</b> <b>disease,</b> and warfarin poisoning.|$|E
25|$|Salicylate therapy, {{particularly}} aspirin, {{remains an}} important part of the treatment (though questioned by some) but salicylates alone are not as effective as IVIG. Aspirin therapy is started at high doses until the fever subsides, and then is continued at a low dose when the patient returns home, usually for two months to prevent blood clots from forming. Except for <b>Kawasaki</b> <b>disease</b> and a few other indications, aspirin is otherwise normally not recommended for children due to its association with Reye's syndrome. Because children with <b>Kawasaki</b> <b>disease</b> will be taking aspirin for up to several months, vaccination against varicella and influenza is required, as these infections are most likely to cause Reye's syndrome.|$|E
40|$|A 5 -year-old-girl with {{erythematous}} skin rash, {{hypertension and}} tachycardia due to mercury intoxication was presented. Initial clinical and biochemical investigations suggested {{a diagnosis of}} vasculitis (atypical <b>Kawasaki’s</b> <b>disease),</b> but subsequently a history of exposure to mercury was discovered. Urine and blood mercury levels were consistent with mercury intoxication. Mercury intoxication {{should be considered in}} any child with signs and symptoms of hypertension, erythematous skin rash and tachycardia. Parents and school administrators, as well as paediatricians, should be aware of potential risks of the mercury and should be encouraged to avoid mercury-containing devices in schools and households...|$|R
40|$|During a 31 -year period, 54 {{patients}} were treated for <b>Kawasaki's</b> <b>disease</b> at the Texas Heart Institute and Texas Children's Hospital. Classically, the illness {{is characterized by}} prolonged fever, conjunctivitis, oral mucosal inflammation, exanthema, and later skin desquamation and cervical lymphoadenopathy. Seventy percent of patients have electrocardiographic abnormalities consisting of prolongation of the PR and QT intervals and ST-T wave changes. Most deaths occur within 1 to 2 months after onset of the disease. The risk of coronary abnormalities and cardiac death appear to be higher in those patients under 1 year of age with prolonged fever, elevated white blood count, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate...|$|R
40|$|A case of {{recurrent}} toxin-mediated perineal erythema A 2 -year-old girl presented with recurrent episodes of pharyngitis and a perineal rash. During the first episode, {{a course of}} antibio-tics resulted in a quick resolution of symptoms. Yet a few days later, her symptoms had recurred and she was referred to our clinic. She was febrile, her lips were red and fissured (figure 1 A), the tonsils were enlarged and red, she had a pronounced perineal rash (figure 1 B) and, after a few days, desquamation of fingertips. Cultures of the throat showed an exotoxin C-producing group A streptococcus. She recovered with another course of antibiotics. A few months later, she had another episode of sore throat accompanied by perineal rash. The recurrent episodes of pharyngitis and perineal erythema associated with a toxin-producing group A streptococcus are compatible with ‘recurrent toxin-mediated perineal erythema’ (RTPE). 1 – 3 RTPE is thought to result from bacterial toxins that act as superantigens. 4 During the infection, a distinct perineal rash develops, along with a scarlet fever-like presentation. The patient is generally well, with no or only mild fever. About {{a week after the}} onset of the infection, desquamation of hands and feet is seen. 1 The differential diagnoses of RTPE includes local infection, other toxin-mediated diseases and vasculitides. There is a con-siderable overlap with the clinical picture of <b>Kawasaki’s</b> <b>disease,</b> and in the presence of prolonged fever, (incomplete) <b>Kawasaki’s</b> <b>disease</b> will be difficult to rule out. 5 In RTPE, antibiotics result in a quick resolution of symptoms. If symptoms recur frequently, tonsillectomy should be considered...|$|R
25|$|Current {{advice in}} the United Kingdom by the Committee on Safety of Medicines is that aspirin {{should not be}} given to those {{under the age of}} 16 years, unless {{specifically}} indicated in <b>Kawasaki</b> <b>disease</b> or in the prevention of blood clot formation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Kawasaki</b> <b>disease</b> affects boys {{more than}} girls, {{with people of}} Asian ethnicity, {{particularly}} Japanese and Korean people, most susceptible, {{as well as people}} of Afro-Caribbean ethnicity. The disease was rare in Caucasians until the last few decades, and incidence rates fluctuate from country to country.|$|E
25|$|However, its {{incidence}} in the United States is increasing. <b>Kawasaki</b> <b>disease</b> {{is predominantly}} {{a disease of}} young children, with 80% of patients younger than five years of age. About 2,000-4,000 cases are identified in the U.S. each year (9 to 19 per 100,000 children younger than 5 years of age).|$|E
40|$|True {{aneurysm}} of the {{brachial artery}} {{is a rare}} disease entity. The mechanism of aneurysm formation {{is considered to be}} compression of the arterial wall, producing contusion of the media and subsequent weakness of the wall and fusiform dilatation. It can be caused by arteriosclerotic, congenital, and metabolic disorders, and can be associated with <b>diseases</b> such as <b>Kawasaki's</b> <b>disease.</b> Doppler ultrasonography, computed tomography, arteriography, and selective upper extremity angiography may be performed for establishing the diagnosis of aneurysm. The best therapeutic option is operative repair, and it should be performed without any delay, in order to prevent upper extremity ischemic or thrombotic sequelae. Here, we report a case of recurrent brachial artery aneurysm with review of the literature...|$|R
40|$|Bacterial superantigens (SAgs) are protein exotoxins of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes which trigger massive, polyclonal, T cell {{activation}} {{dependent upon}} the HLA class II molecule, but independent of HLA class II processing. SAgs are responsible for streptococcal and staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome. The staphylococcal SAgs are responsible for enterotoxic food poisoning, whilst SAgs are also hypothesised to {{have a role in}} <b>Kawasaki’s</b> <b>Disease</b> and other forms of autoimmunity - rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus, psoriasis and eczema. The investigation, diagnosis and management of SAg mediated disease are hampered by limitations in the tools available for superantigen detection. SAgs are serologically very diverse, are active at tiny concentrations and surrogate markers of superantigenicity, such as V� specific changes in T cell repertoire, produce conflicting data even in the definitive syndrome of SAg exposure; toxic shock...|$|R
40|$|Cardiovascular disease (CVD), principally {{heart disease}} and stroke, {{is the leading cause}} of death for both males and females in {{developed}} countries. Aspirin is the most widely used and tested antiplatelet drug in CVD, and it is proven to be the cornerstone of antiplatelet therapy in treatment and prevention of CVD in clinical trials in various populations. In acute coronary syndrome, thrombotic stroke, and <b>Kawasaki's</b> <b>disease,</b> acute use of aspirin can decrease mortality and recurrence of cardiovascular events. As secondary prevention, aspirin is believed to be effective in acute coronary syndrome, stable angina, revascularization, stroke, TIA, and atrial fibrillation. Aspirin may also be used for patients with a high risk of future CVD for primary prevention, but the balance between benefits and the possibility of side effects must be considered...|$|R
25|$|The first {{detailed}} description of Reye syndrome was in 1963 by Douglas Reye. Children are most commonly affected. It affects less than {{one in a million}} children a year. The general recommendation to use aspirin in children was withdrawn because of Reye syndrome, with use of aspirin only recommended in <b>Kawasaki</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the United Kingdom, {{estimates}} of incidence rate vary {{because of the}} rarity of <b>Kawasaki</b> <b>disease.</b> However, it is believed to affect fewer than one in every 25,000 people. Incidence of the disease doubled from 1991 to 2000, however, with four cases per 100,000 children in 1991 compared with a rise of eight cases per 100,000 in 2000.|$|E
25|$|<b>Kawasaki</b> <b>disease</b> is rare. It affects between 8 and 67 per 100,000 {{people under}} the age of five except in Japan where it affects 124 per 100,000. It is much less common after the age of five. Boys are more {{commonly}} affected than girls. The disorder was first described in 1967 by Tomisaku Kawasaki in Japan.|$|E
40|$|The role of {{autoimmunity}} in large-vessel vasculitis {{in humans}} remains unclear. We have previously shown that infection of gamma interferon receptor knockout (IFN-γR−/−) mice with gammaherpesvirus 68 (γHV 68) results in severe {{inflammation of the}} large elastic arteries that is pathologically similar to the lesions observed in Takayasu's arteritis, the nongranulomatous variant of temporal arteritis, and <b>Kawasaki's</b> <b>disease</b> (K. E. Weck et al., Nat. Med. 3 : 1346 – 1353, 1997). Here we define the mechanism of damage to the elastic arteries. We {{show that there is}} a persistent productive infection of the media of the large elastic vessels. In addition, we demonstrate that persistent virus replication is necessary for chronic arteritis, since antiviral therapy of mice with established disease resulted in increased survival, clearance of viral antigen from the media of the affected vessel, and dramatic amelioration of arteritic lesions. These data argue that ongoing virus replication, rather than autoimmunity, is the cause of γHV 68 -induced elastic arteritis...|$|R
40|$|Surgical {{angioplasty}} of {{the left}} main coronary artery confers several advantages over conventional bypass surgery: unrestricted forward flow is provided to the entire coronary bed and graft material is spared. The literature contains many reports of surgical angioplasty of atherosclerotic stenoses. The technique is described in five patients with non-atherosclerotic disease {{of the left}} main coronary artery: three children (a 7  year old girl who had undergone an arterial switch operation shortly after birth; a 9  year old boy with congenital supravalvar aortic stenosis; and a 10  year old girl with <b>Kawasaki's</b> <b>disease)</b> and two adults (a 51  year old woman with post-radiation stenosis; a 53  year old man with acute dissection). All patients had an uneventful recovery and are free from symptoms with a widely open left main trunk. Although technical difficulties are increased in these patients, excellent results can be achieved with this approach.    Keywords: surgical angioplasty; paediatric cardiology; non-atherosclerotic lesions; congenital heart defect...|$|R
40|$|The {{incidence}} of coronary aneurysms varies from 1. 5 % to 5 % of cases at angiography (1). The primary complications are ischemia and infarction due to thrombosis or dissection. Spontaneous rupture is rare. The presence of coronary aneurysms, {{with or without}} obstructive disease, is an independent risk factor for death (2). These images are from a 66 -year-old man inci-dentally found to have giant coronary and iliac artery aneurysms. He underwent computed tomog-raphy scanning for investigation of renal colic, which revealed a 9. 5 -cm renal tumor. He did not have angina or claudication. Coronary angiography showed giant coronary aneurysms (Fig. 1 A and 1 B). The etiology was unclear, probably atherosclerotic. There {{was no evidence of}} <b>Kawasaki’s</b> <b>disease.</b> We were unable to pass any wires into the left anterior descending artery (LAD) for intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging or pressure wire studies. IVUS studies of the circumflex and right coronary arteries are shown (Figs. 1 C and 1 E). (red arrow) and clearly identified...|$|R
