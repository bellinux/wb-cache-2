2500|$|The {{dorsal stripe}} {{runs through the}} mane and tail of a <b>dun</b> <b>horse,</b> so {{the center of the}} mane and tail are darker. The outer edges may be {{significantly}} lighter, even close to white. These paler hairs are seen {{at the base of the}} tail and on the edges of the mane. The presence of guard hairs may also be called [...] "frosting". Such characteristics are very visible among the Fjord horses, which have their sandwich-patterned manes shaved short and upright. The presence of paler guard hairs on the mane and tail is seen throughout Equus.|$|E

60|$|The Khan of Khar met {{the general}} on the farther {{bank of the}} river. He was a tall, fine-looking man with bright eyes, bushy black {{whiskers}} and white teeth, which his frequent smiles displayed. He was richly dressed, attended by a dozen horsemen and mounted on a handsome, though vicious <b>dun</b> <b>horse.</b> He saluted Sir Bindon Blood with great respect and ceremony. Some conversation took place, conducted, as the khan only spoke Pushtu, through the political officer. The khan asserted his loyalty {{and that of his}} neighbour the Khan of Jar. He would, he said, do his utmost to secure the peaceful passage of the troops. Such supplies as they might need, he would provide, as far as his resources would go. He looked with some alarm at the long lines of marching men and animals. The general reassured him. If the forces were not interfered with or opposed, if the camps were not fired into at night, if stragglers were not cut off and cut up by his people, payment in cash would be made for all the grain and wood it was necessary to requisition.|$|E

50|$|Red dun, {{also called}} claybank or fox <b>dun,</b> <b>horses</b> {{do not have}} black points, {{as there is no}} black on the horse to be affected.

500|$|Kiger Mustangs {{are most}} {{commonly}} dun in color, although the breed registry also allows bay, black and roan horses to be registered. There are numerous shades of dun, all {{variations on a}} tan base, and many shades have their own names. The Kiger Mesteño Association separates dun shades into four categories: dun, red dun, grulla, and claybank. [...] "Dun" [...] as used by the Kiger registry covers <b>dun</b> <b>horses</b> with black points, and adds the terms zebra dun, dusty dun, smutty dun or coyote dun, depending on the exact shade of body color. Red dun, or the variation [...] "apricot dun", covers horses with points that are red, brown or flaxen. Grulla covers horses with blueish, mousy or slate-colored bodies and black points, and these horses may also be called lobo duns, olive grullas, silver grullas or smutty grullas. Claybank, another variation of red <b>dun,</b> describes Kiger <b>horses</b> who have golden body coats with red or orange tints and darker red points. <b>Dun</b> <b>horses</b> may have primitive markings, which include any of the following: a dorsal stripe, lightened outer guard hairs on the manes and/or tails, zebra-like stripes on the upper legs, transverse striping over the upper shoulders, dark color around the muzzle, and ears with dark outlines and lighter interiors.|$|R
6000|$|Day {{had just}} dawned when I rose to join Mariano {{at the fire}} he had already kindled to heat the water for his early maté. I {{did not like the}} idea of lying there {{concealed}} amongst the trees like some hunted animal for an indefinite time; moreover, I had been advised by Santa Coloma to proceed directly to the Lomas de Rocha, on the south coast, {{in the event of a}} defeat, and this now seemed to me the best thing to do. It had been very pleasant lying there [...] "under the greenwood tree," [...] while those veracious stories of hags, lampalaguas, and apparitions had proved highly entertaining; but a long spell, a whole month perhaps, of that kind of life was not to be thought of; and if I did not get to Rocha now, before the rural police were set to catch runaway rebels, it would perhaps be impossible to do so later on. I determined, therefore, to go my own way, and, after drinking bitter maté, I caught and saddled the <b>dun</b> <b>horse.</b> I really had not deserved the severe censure Lechuza had passed on me the previous evening in reference to horse-stealing, for I had taken the dun with very little more compunction than one is accustomed to feel in England when [...] "borrowing" [...] an umbrella on a rainy day. To all people in all parts of the world, a time comes when to appropriate their neighbour's goods is held not only justifiable, but even meritorious; to Israelites in Egypt, Englishmen under a cloud in their own moist island, and to Orientals running away after a fight. By keeping the dun over thirty hours in my possession I had acquired a kind of prescriptive right to it, and now began to look on it as my very own; subsequent experience of his endurance and other good qualities enables me to endorse the Oriental saying that a [...] "stolen horse carries you well." ...|$|E

5000|$|In most cases, sooty coats exhibit {{pronounced}} countershading; the dorsal {{region is}} {{darker than the}} ventral region. However, some forms seem to produce darker lower parts. The [...] "false dorsal" [...] or [...] "countershading dorsal" [...] can mimic the dorsal stripe associated with <b>dun</b> <b>horses</b> and {{is associated with the}} sooty trait. The most extensive expression of sooty produces a dark, often-dappled cast oriented down from the topline. Many horses with the sooty trait have a darker mask on the bony parts of the face.|$|R
2500|$|Primitive {{markings}} are a {{group of}} hair coat markings and qualities seen in several equine species, including horses, donkeys, and asses. [...] In horses, they are associated with primitive breeds, though not limited to such breeds. [...] The markings are particularly associated with the dun coat color family. All <b>dun</b> <b>horses</b> possess at least the dorsal stripe, but {{the presence of the}} other primitive markings varies. [...] Other common markings may include horizontal striping on the legs, transverse striping across the shoulders, and lighter guard hairs along the edges of a dark mane and tail.|$|R
2500|$|The {{dorsal stripe}} {{reflects}} the original coat {{color of the}} horse. Those on bay duns may be black or reddish, while those on red duns are distinctly red. Dorsal stripes on <b>dun</b> <b>horses</b> with the cream gene seem unaffected by cream: smoky black-duns ("smoky grullas"), buckskin-duns ("dunskins"), and palomino-duns ("dunalinos") have black, brown, or red dorsal stripes, as well. So-called [...] "countershading dorsals", which are dorsal stripes occurring on non-dun horses, are a darker shade of the horse's coat color. Countershading dorsal stripes may be seasonal, waning, or disappearing altogether during a particular time of year.|$|R
50|$|Sorrel or {{chestnut}} coloration can {{be distinguished}} from dun {{by the fact that}} a <b>dun</b> <b>horse</b> has a gene that causes slightly washed-out yellowish color, with a darker mane and tail than the rest of its coat, may have areas of darker color on the shoulder and forelegs, and also possesses a narrow, dark line {{down the middle of the}} back.|$|E

6000|$|We do {{not feel}} quite sure that we seize Professor Kolliker's meaning here, but he appears {{to suggest that the}} {{observation}} of the general order and harmony which pervade inorganic nature, would lead us to anticipate a similar order and harmony in the organic world. And this is no doubt true, but it by no means follows that the particular order and harmony observed among them should be that which we see. Surely the stripes of <b>dun</b> <b>horses,</b> and the teeth of the foetal 'Balaena', are not explained by the [...] "existence of general laws of Nature." [...] Mr. Darwin endeavours to explain the exact order of organic nature which exists; not the mere fact that there is some order.|$|R
50|$|Buckskin and Bay dun vs. Amber champagne: All {{three of}} these genetically {{distinct}} coat colors feature a lighter bronze or tan coat with darker points. As adults, the pinkish freckled skin and hazel eyes indicate amber champagne, while gray or black skin and light or dark brown eyes indicate buckskin or bay dun. Duns do not exhibit unusually colored skin, though buckskins, like palominos, may be born with blue eyes that darken within days or weeks. In the adult, the points of a buckskin or bay dun will be black, not chocolate as in the amber champagne. Bay <b>dun</b> <b>horses</b> also exhibit primitive markings, especially a dorsal stripe, though amber duns will also possess these marks. The eyes and skin remain the best identifying feature. Buckskins, like palominos, will a parent that is palomino, buckskin, smoky black, or blue-eyed cream. Bay duns will have a parent that is bay dun, red dun, or grullo. Champagnes will have a champagne parent.|$|R
40|$|Dun is a {{wild-type}} coat {{color in}} horses characterized by pigment dilution with a striking pattern of dark areas termed primitive markings. Here {{we show that}} pigment dilution in <b>Dun</b> <b>horses</b> is due to radially asymmetric deposition of pigment in the growing hair caused by localized expression of the T-box 3 (TBX 3) transcription factor in hair follicles, which in turn determines the distribution of hair follicle melanocytes. Most domestic horses are non-dun, a more intensely pigmented phenotype caused by regulatory mutations impairing TBX 3 expression in the hair follicle, resulting in a more circumferential distribution of melanocytes and pigment granules in individual hairs. We identified two different alleles (non-dun 1 and non-dun 2) causing non-dun color. non-dun 2 is a recently derived allele, whereas the Dun and non-dun 1 alleles are found in ancient horse DNA, demonstrating that this polymorphism predates horse domestication. These findings uncover a new developmental role for T-box genes and new aspects of hair follicle biology and pigmentation...|$|R
50|$|The classic dun is a gray-gold or tan, {{characterized}} by a body color ranging from sandy yellow to reddish brown. A <b>dun</b> <b>horse</b> always has a dark stripe {{down the middle of}} its back, a tail and mane darker than the body coat, and usually darker face and legs. Other duns may appear a light yellowish shade, or a steel gray, depending on the underlying coat color genetics. Manes, tails, primitive markings, and other dark areas are usually the shade of the undiluted base coat color.|$|E

5000|$|Some horses with a {{particular}} type of dun hair coat known as a [...] "blue dun", grullo, or [...] "mouse" [...] dun appear to be a solid gray. However, this color is caused by the dun gene acting on a black base coat, and <b>horses</b> who are <b>dun</b> have all hairs the same color; there is no intermingling of white and dark hairs. Also, <b>dun</b> <b>horses</b> do not get lighter as they age. Horses who are a light cream color are also not grays. These are usually cremello, perlino or smoky cream horses, all colors produced by the action of the cream gene. However, if a gray parent passes on the gene, the gray gene will be dominant over cremello. Another cream-colored dilition, the pearl gene or [...] "barlink factor", may also create very light-coated horses. Similarly, the champagne gene can lighten coat color, often producing dappling or light colors that can be confused with gray.|$|R

5000|$|Since the dun gene, when on a [...] "bay dun" [...] horse, can closely {{resemble}} buckskin, in that both colors feature a light-colored coat {{with a dark}} mane and tail, classic duns frequently are confused with buckskins. The {{difference between these two}} colors is the dun as a tan color, somewhat duller than the more cream or gold buckskin, and duns also possess primitive markings. Some buckskins do show countershading, but it is not related to the primitive markings of <b>dun</b> factor <b>horses.</b>|$|R
