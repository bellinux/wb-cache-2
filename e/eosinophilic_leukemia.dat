40|$|Diagnosis of {{systemic}} mastocytosis (SM) is mainly {{based on the}} morphological demonstration of compact mast cell infiltrates in various tissue sites. In almost all patients such infiltrates are detected in the bone marrow. Reliable immunohistochemical markers for the diagnosis and grading of SM have been established, but various differential diagnoses including myeloproliferative neoplasms, basophilic and <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>leukemias</b> may {{be very difficult to}} delineate. Even more challenging is the recognition of hematological neoplasms with signs of mast cell differentiation but not fulfilling diagnostic criteria for SM, especially the rare myelomastocytic leukemia. It is also important to separate the reactive state of mast cell hyperplasia from indolent variants of SM, especially those with a very low degree of bone marrow infiltration and absence of compact mast cell infiltrates. When the lymphocytic component of the SM infiltrate is very prominent, SM may be confused with an indolent lymphoma, especially lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma which almost always shows a marked reactive increase in mast cells. In aggressive and leukemic variants of SM, mast cells may be very atypical and devoid of metachromatic granules. This hypogranulation can be regarded as cellular atypia and may lead to the misdiagnosis aspect of monocytic leukemia or histiocytic neoplasm. Regarding immunohistochemical anomalies, mast cells in aggressive and leukemic SM have been found to express CD 30 (Ki 1 -antigen). Thus, anaplastic large cell lymphoma or Hodgkin's disease may first be considered rather than SM. There is increasing evidence that most patients with long-standing adult-type urticaria pigmentosalike skin lesions have in fact indolent SM. Therefore, such skin lesions are an important clue to the correct diagnosis in these patients. However, in aggressive or leukemic SM skin lesions are usually absent and then the correct diagnosis relies on an appropriate investigation of bone marrow biopsy specimens using both SM-related immunohistochemical markers (tryptase, KIT, CD 25, CD 30) but also markers excluding potential differential diagnoses. Investigation for presence of the activating KIT point mutation D 816 V is very helpful to establish a correct diagnosis of SM in all the difficult cases exhibiting a low degree of bone marrow infiltration or puzzling morphological findings.

50|$|Hematopoietic {{stem cells}} give rise to: 1) myeloid {{precursor}} cells that differentiate into red blood cells, mast cells, blood platelet-forming megakaryocytes, or myeloblasts, which latter cells subsequently differentiate into {{white blood cells}} viz., neutrophils, basophils, monocytes, and eosinophils; or 2) lymphoid precursor cells which differentiate into T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, or natural killer cells. Malignant transformation of these stem or precursor cells results {{in the development of}} various hematological malignancies. Some of these transformations involve chromosomal translocations or Interstitial deletions that create fusion genes. These fusion genes encode fusion proteins that continuously stimulate cell growth, proliferation, prolonged survival, and/or differentiation. Such mutations occur in hematological stem cells and/or their daughter myeloid precursor and lymphoid precursor cells; commonly involve genes that encode tyrosine kinase proteins; and cause or {{contribute to the development of}} hematological malignancies. A classic example of such a disease is chronic myelogenous leukemia, a neoplasm commonly caused by a mutation that creates the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene (see Philadelphia chromosome). The disease is due to conversion of the tightly regulated tyrosine kinase of ABL1 protein to being unregulated and continuously active in the BCR-ABL1 fusion protein. Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myelogenous leukemia I now successfully treated with maintenance tyrosine kinase inhibitors but before this at the time novel therapeutic approach was generally lethal within 18-60 months of diagnosis. Some hematological malignancies exhibit increased numbers of circulating blood eosinophils, increased numbers of bone marrow eosinophils, and/or eosinophil infiltrations into otherwise normal tissues. These malignancies were at first diagnosed as eosinophilia, hypereosinophilia, acute <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>leukemia,</b> chronic <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>leukemia,</b> other myeloid leukemias, myeloproliferative neoplasm, myeloid sarcoma, lymphoid leukemia, or non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Based on their association with eosinophils, unique genetic mutations, and known or potential sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors or other specific drug therapies, they are now in the process of being classified together as clonal hypereosinophilia. Historically, patients suffering the cited eosinophil-related syndromes were evaluated for causes of their eosinophilia such as those due to allergic disease, parasite or fungal infection, autoimmune disorders, and various well-known hematological malignancies (e.g. Chronic myelogenous leukemia, systemic mastocytosis, etc.) (see causes of eosinophilia). Absent these causes, patients were diagnosed in the World Health Organization's classification as having either 1) Chronic <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>leukemia,</b> not otherwise specified, (CEL-NOS) if blood or bone marrow blast cells exceeded 2% or 5% of total nucleated cells, respectively, and other criteria were met or 2) idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) if there was evidence of eosinophil-induced tissue damage but no criteria indicating chronic <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>leukemia.</b> Discovery of genetic mutations underlining these eosinophilia syndromes lead to their removal from CEL-NOS or HES categories and classification as myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms associated with eosinophilia and abnormalities of PDGFRA, PDGFRB, FGFR1, and, tentatively, PCMA-JAK2. Informally, these diseases are also termed clonal hypereosinophilias. New genetic mutations associated with, and possibly contributing to the development of, eosinophilia have been discovered, deemed to be causes of clonal eosinophilia, and, in certain cases, recommended for inclusion in the category of myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms associated with eosinophilia and abnormalities of PDGFRA, PDGFRB, FGFR1, and, tentatively, PCMA-JAK2. Many of the genetic causes for clonal eosinophilia are rare but nonetheless merit attention because of their known or potential sensitivity to therapeutic interventions that differ dramatically form the often toxic chemotherapy used to treat more common hematological malignancies.|$|E
50|$|An {{increase}} in eosinophils, i.e., {{the presence of}} more than 500 eosinophils/microlitre of blood is called an eosinophilia, and is typically seen in people with a parasitic infestation of the intestines; autoimmune and collagen vascular disease (such as rheumatoid arthritis) and Systemic lupus erythematosus; malignant diseases such as <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>leukemia,</b> clonal hypereosinophilia, and Hodgkin's disease; lymphocyte-variant hypereosinophilia; extensive skin diseases (such as exfoliative dermatitis); Addison's disease and other causes of low corticosteroid production (corticosteroids suppress blood eosinophil levels); reflux esophagitis (in which eosinophils will {{be found in the}} squamous epithelium of the esophagus) and eosinophilic esophagitis; and with the use of certain drugs such as penicillin. But, perhaps the most common cause for eosinophilia is an allergic condition such as asthma. In 1989, contaminated L-tryptophan supplements caused a deadly form of eosinophilia known as eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, which was reminiscent of the Toxic Oil Syndrome in Spain in 1981.|$|E
5000|$|Patients {{with the}} cited PDGFRA fusion genes are {{overwhelmingly}} male (30:1 male to female ratio). They may present with cutaneous and/or pulmonary allergic symptoms, mucosal ulcers, splenomegaly, current or history of thrombosis events, {{and the most}} serious complication, cardiac dysfunction, which occurs in 20% to 30% of patients. The serious complications of myocardial fibrosis and acute vascular thrombosis events occur often in, and {{may be part of}} the presentation of, this clonal eosinophilia. Patient laboratory findings are compatible with the findings seen in a) eosinophilia, hypereosinophilia, the hypereosinophilic syndrome, chronic <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>leukemia,</b> or acute eosinophilic leukemia; b) myeloproliferative neoplasm/myeloblastic leukemia associated with little or no eosinophilia; c) T-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma associated with eosinophilia; d) myeloid sarcoma associated with eosinophilia (see FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion genes); or e) combinations of these presentations. Variations in the type of malignancy formed likely reflect the specific type(s) of hematopoietic precursor cells that bear the mutation.|$|E
50|$|Consistent {{with the}} concept that Siglec-8 is a late {{differentiation}} marker, Siglec-8 has not been detected {{on the surface of}} relatively undifferentiated eosinophilic cell lines, such as EoL-1, AML14, AML14.3D10, or K562, the basophilic leukemia cell line KU812, nor on cells such as HL60 or EoL-3 that have been differentiated towards an eosinophil-like lineage. Only low levels are detected on the human mast cell sub-line HMC-1.1; however, the HMC-1.2 cell line, which bears a second KIT mutation (D816V, in addition to the V560G mutation found in both HMC-1.1 and HMC-1.2 cells) that may induce further differentiation, expresses Siglec-8 at the cell surface. However, based on a small sampling of patients, all eosinophils from patients with chronic <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>leukemia</b> (CEL), hypereosinophilic syndrome, or chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), all basophils from patients with CEL or CML, and all bone marrow mast cells from patients with indolent systemic mastocytosis or aplastic anemia express Siglec-8, providing a potential target for these cells in the context of these hematologic malignancies.|$|E
50|$|Lymphocyte-variant hyper{{eosinophilia}} is a {{rare disease}} in which eosinophilia is caused by aberrant T cell lymphocytes which secrete cytokines (e.g. interleukin-5) that stimulate the proliferation of eosinophil precursor cells. The disease, which occasionally proceeds to a malignant lymphocytic phase, clearly reflects a clonal disturbance in lymphocytes, not eosinophils, and therefore is not a clonal hypereosinophilia. Similar non-clonal eosinophilia due to eosinophil precursor cell stimulation by clonal malignant cells is sometimes seen in cases of Hodgkin disease, B-cell lymphoma, T-cell lymphomas, T cell leukemias, and Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Other hematological diseases are associated with eosinophilia but regarded as clonal eosinophilia associated with a more important clonal malignancy in another cell type. For example, eosinophilia occurs in 20% to 30% of patients with systemic mastocytosis. Also referred to as SM-eo (systemic mastocytosis with eosinophilia) or SM-SEL (systemic mastocytosis with chronic <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>leukemia),</b> this disease's clonal eosinophils bear the same driving mutation, D816V in theKIT gene, as the clonal mast cells.|$|E
50|$|Criteria for the {{clinically}} defined {{diagnosis of}} lymphocyte-variant hypereosinophilia {{have not been}} strictly set forth. Diagnosis must first rule out other causes of eosinophilia and hypereosinophilia, such as those due to allergies, drug reactions, infestations, and autoimmune diseases {{as well as those}} associated with <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>leukemia,</b> clonal eosinophilia, systemic mastocytosis, and other malignancies (see causes of eosinophilia). Criteria for the diagnosis include findings of: a) long term hypereosinophila (i.e. eosinophil blood counts >1,500/microliter) plus physical findings and symptoms associated with the disease; b) bone marrow analysis showing abnormally high levels of eosinophils; c) elevated serum levels of Immunoglobulin E, other immunoglobulins, and CCL17; d) eosinophil infiltrates in afflicted tissues; e) increased numbers of blood and/or bone marrow T cells bearing abnormal immunophenotype cluster of differentiation markers as defined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (see above section on Pathogenesis); f) abnormal T cell receptor arrangements as defined by polymerase chain reaction methods (see above section on Pathogenesis); and g) evidence of excessive IL-5 secretion by lymphocytes (see above section on Pathogenesis). In many clinical settings, however, studies on the T cell receptor and IL-5 are not available and therefore not routine parts of the diagnostic work-up or criteria for the disease. The finding of T cells bearing abnormal immunophenotype cluster of differentiation markers is critical to making the diagnosis.|$|E

40|$|The 2008 WHO {{classification}} system for hematological malignancies is comprehensive and includes histology and genetic information. Myeloid neoplasms are now classified into five categories: acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), MDS/MPN, and myeloid and/or lymphoid malignancies associated with eosinophilia and PDGFR or FGFR 1 rearrangements. MPN are subclassified into eight separate entities: chronic myelogenous leukemia, polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, primary myelofibrosis, systemic mastocytosis, chronic <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>leukemia</b> not otherwise specified, chronic neutrophilic leukemia, and unclassifiable MPN. The diagnosis of chronic myelogenous leukemia requires {{the presence of}} BCR-ABL 1, while its absence is required for all other MPN.

JAK 2 V 617 F is found in most patients with polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, or primary myelofibrosis and is, therefore, useful as a clonal marker in those settings. The diagnostic utility of MPL and TET 2 mutations is limited by low mutational frequency. In systemic mastocytosis, presence of KIT D 816 V is expected but not essential for diagnosis.

Additional names have subsequently been introduced to describe specific variants of HES, such as the myeloid variant and the lymphoid variant, or to indicate idiopathic HES, for which the cause of the eosinophilia is completely unknown. Molecular analysis led to the identification of the clonal origin of several subgroups of HES, clearly establishing these diseases as true leukemias. These cases of hypereosinophilia are now referred to as 'myeloid neoplasms associated with eosinophilia and abnormalities of PDGF receptor A and B (PDGFRA and PDGFRB), or FGF receptor 1 (FGFR 1) '. In cases for which clonality is clear, but no PDGFRA, PDGFRB or FGFR 1 rearrangement could be demonstrated, the term 'chronic <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>leukemia,</b> not otherwise specified' is preferred. Most importantly, patients with rearrangements of PDGFRA or PDGFRB can be efficiently treated with the kinase inhibitor imatinib.
