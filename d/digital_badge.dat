In this paper we try to identify students attitude towards <b>Digital</b> <b>Badges,</b> a concept used for increasing motivation in video games, and what teachers think about the concept. We also find out how to design <b>Digital</b> <b>Badges</b> in education for elementary school. Based on current research about gamification and motivational theories we create a digital exam for students to try. After that we conducted focus groups with the students in which we discussed their perception and what their attitudes towards <b>Digital</b> <b>Badges</b> was. We also conducted interviews with teachers and, combined with the results from the focus groups, the results of the interview were analyzed for our conclusion.

We all know that someone who has earned a First Aid badge is proficient in doctoring small wounds, and perhaps even providing CPR! <b>Digital</b> <b>badges</b> function the same way. They certify and communicate an individual’s knowledge, skills, and/or achievements. <b>Digital</b> <b>badges</b> have been adopted by social media sites such as 4 Square to recognize users’ achievements and are growing in popularity. They are being used by educational institutions as a way “gamify” learning and promote student engagement; professional organizations like Educause use badges to certify professional development accomplishments; and the Dallas Museum of Art even uses badges as part of its Friends Membership Program. With the growing popularity of <b>digital</b> <b>badges</b> in social media and education, librarians can learn a lot about this new way that students and communities communicate their knowledge and skills.

50|$|Online or digital badges are not {{dissimilar}} to {{the concept}} of the Europass CV. Open badges do however challenge the existing practices in a more radical manner, in that the process is much more decentralized and removed from the traditional quality assurance bodies:A <b>digital</b> <b>badge</b> is an online representation of a skill you’ve learned. Open Badges take that concept one step further, and allows you to verify your skills, interests and achievements through credible organizations. And because the system is based on an open standard, you can combine multiple badges from different issuers to tell the complete story of your achievements - both online and off. Display your badges wherever you want them on the web, and share them for employment, education or lifelong learning.A key criticism of open badges, such as those developed by Mozilla, is that they lack a credible quality assurance component. On the positive side, open badges are free and allow for the inclusion of various forms of learning, including non-formal and informal learning.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{qualitative}} case study {{is to examine the}} role feedback plays within the instructional process, and how students are using feedback to inform their course work within <b>Digital</b> <b>Badge</b> contexts. Educators are looking toward Digital Badges as a way to increase student engagement (Abramovich et al., 2013; Glover 2 ̆ 6 Latif, 2013), develop mastery with critical concepts (Mehta et al., 2013), and reduce gaps in student knowledge (Bowen 2 ̆ 6 Thomas, 2014; Guskey, 2007). Feedback is emphasized as a critical component (Bloom, 1968, 1976; Guskey, 2007; Kluger 2 ̆ 6 DeNisi, 1996; Slavin 2 ̆ 6 Karweit, 1984). Instructors {{need to be able to}} not only display characteristics of a good instructor, but understand the functions (Balzer et al., 1989; Butler 2 ̆ 6 Winne, 1995) and dimensions (Yang 2 ̆ 6 Carless, 2013) of feedback, and then be able to deliver effective feedback (Nicol 2 ̆ 6 Macfarlane-Dick, 2006). ^ Participants in this study included 78 students and 2 instructors from a large Midwestern public university. Data included instructors’ assignment feedback provided to students and students’ online surveys consisting of open-ended questions about the nature and value of instructional feedback within a <b>Digital</b> <b>Badge</b> system. Analysis of the data ensued and then overarching dimensions occurred through the categorization and synthesis of codes. ^ The findings included six major thematic groups concerning the ways in which instructors provide feedback: Outcome feedback, Motivation and Interaction, Clarification, Opportunities to Further Knowledge, Decreasing Gaps in Knowledge, and Promotes Learning and Cognitive Development. Also included are three major thematic groups illustrating feedback from the students’ perspective: Importance and Nature of Feedback, Authority over Knowledge and Learning, and Learning for Mastery. The recommendations based on the study findings presented a set of “Best Practices,” including Types of Feedback to Provide, Feedback Management and Organization, and The Value of a Good Facilitating Instructor, aimed at helping educators navigate the potential challenges of implementing <b>Digital</b> <b>Badge</b> systems and Mastery Learning approaches. The main conclusion of the research is that feedback consists of various characteristics focusing on general low-level categories to higher-level categories that allow preservice teachers to develop essential skills for teaching and learning. ...|$|E

40|$|Digital badges {{are simple}} tools {{that have the}} {{potential}} to change the current system of credentialing, creating methods to recognize diverse learning pathways and offer opportunities for both learners and the institutions or entities that offer them. The <b>digital</b> <b>badge</b> movement is still very new, yet is growing as a method to document and communicate what an individual knows or can do. Digital badges highlight skills of the earner, who then displays the badge for someone to view, and can validate anything from mastering a skill to completion of a certain course or documenting the acquirement of a special professional experience. Digital badges have high potential to drive growth for entities that sell education as they have powerful visual potential through the badge itself and that they be displayed across multiple digital sites to large audiences such as LinkedIn. An earner’s motivation to participate in courses that offer digital badges and display the badge earned can drive growth for entities offering those courses or events. Current formal knowledge and skill achievement programs with recognition for degrees via a paper certificate exists through colleges, universities and some type of job related programs for those outside of school such as a Professional Project Manager certification. The output of these offerings is to get a diploma or certificate which can be displayed in a frame and/or with a line item on a resume recognizing the achievement. So if the earner valued these certificates, they either place the certificate in a frame or display it for all to see; they would add the certification as line item to their resume to share with potential employers; or if applicable, so note them on some other type of shareable medium such as a business card. This is true as well for many companies, businesses or formal certification programs outside of the official education model. Due to the growth of technology, the Internet, social media and portable electronic devices that are with people 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and 365 days a year, people are learning and sharing information about themselves in many different ways. As technology evolves so do the uses. There is a need for recognition of skill and knowledge achievements beyond public, private and higher education. Due to technology advancements, digital badges are a method of recognizing the knowledge and skills a learner currently has or acquires above and beyond formal institutionalized education and outside of a paper-based attendance or certificate completion. Because digital badges are still fairly new, it is important to research the awareness, value, and perceived benefits of digital badges by the earner as {{they are the ones who}} will seek to attain and ultimately display them. This will in turn guide the development of programs with digital badges through their areas of interest and create critical mass for those programs offering them. There are three parties engaged in the transaction of a digital badge: earner, this is the person who can earn and choose to display the digital badge; issuer, this the person who has tied all the credentials to the badge and offers it to the earner; and observer, this is the person who looks at the badge displayed or offered digitally by the earner. The purpose of this study is to understand the earner’s awareness of digital badges, their interest in digital badges and the courses that offer them, and the perceived value of a <b>digital</b> <b>badge</b> and courses that offer digital badges. The current study included one hundred twelve (112) participants completing an initial online survey that gathered characteristics of the learner and ratings on their knowledge awareness, perceived value of digital badges and of courses with digital badges, perceived value of displaying a <b>digital</b> <b>badge</b> and the type of badges they would be interested to earn. A secondary survey was then conducted furthering the initial survey to better understand the value an earner placed on a course with a <b>digital</b> <b>badge</b> and what are the biggest concerns or curiosities of digital badges. The results of the study showed that the earner who is one third of a badge transaction, with the issuer and observer making up the other two-thirds, is interested in digital badges and educational courses that offer them, do see them as valuable to have, display and earn, and do find educational courses that offer them as valuable...|$|E

40|$|In this modern, {{information}} rich, technology driven world {{individuals are}} constantly mastering new skills, knowledge and competencies. These skills, knowledge and competencies are acquired in {{formal and informal}} environments. This fragmentation of learning presents a unique challenge to vocational education organisations and industry training institutions.

Traditional methods of monitoring and recording performance, such as institutionally verified test scores, allocated grades, credits earned, and observations made, fail to acknowledge the learners informal acquisition of equivalent measures. Advocates argue digital badges and <b>digital</b> <b>badge</b> ecosystems will help clarify, validate and define the skills, knowledge and competencies learners have acquired. However, individual badges, in isolation, do not truly represent a learner’s progress, indicate a learner’s proficiency or acknowledge a learner’s achievement.
