Mills <b>is</b> <b>quoted</b> <b>as</b> <b>saying</b> that she intends {{it to be}} the first in a worldwide chain of vegan restaurants. Whilst promoting the restaurant, Mills gave an interview to the BBC, stating that she'd been very proactive in the building stages and now that it was open, would give as much time to it as she could – working it around her charity work. In May 2013 she sold the restaurant premises to local record producer Fatboy Slim and opened a new, enlarged VBites in East Street in Brighton.|$|E

25|$|In the {{following}} weeks several eminent former Scottish judges {{became involved in}} the debate. On 28 September 2007, former Solicitor General and retired Senator of the College of Justice, Lord McCluskey, gave an interview to The Herald stating that he believed Lord Hamilton had no grounds to accuse Elish Angiolini of threatening the independence of the judiciary. He <b>is</b> <b>quoted</b> <b>as</b> <b>saying,</b> 'He's quite wrong. What he fails to see is that it is sometimes essential for a minister to comment upon a case. It happens all the time in parliament'.|$|E
25|$|In {{an article}} in The Globe and Mail written by Andre Picard on January 9, 1990, she <b>is</b> <b>quoted</b> <b>as</b> <b>saying,</b> “it was morbid and horrible what {{happened}} to Édouard. We thought it was about time someone showed a little respect for his body – and his soul.” Lesperance felt the same and began plans to have the body returned to Willow Bunch {{the same year as}} his visit to the university. This first attempt failed because university officials claimed that the court would have to decide who had the right to the body. Although Lesperance gained power of attorney to act on behalf of the family, he did not proceed with any legal action at that time.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the American Civil War, the city's {{access to}} the Canada–US border made it a key stop for runaway slaves along the {{underground}} railroad. The Michigan Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument in Detroit's Campus Martius Park commemorates the state's role in the American Civil War. Thousands of Detroiters formed volunteer regiments, including the 24th Michigan Volunteer Infantry Regiment (part of the legendary Iron Brigade) which fought with distinction and suffered 82% casualties at Gettysburg in 1863. Abraham Lincoln <b>is</b> <b>quoted</b> <b>as</b> <b>saying</b> Thank God for Michigan! Following Lincoln's assassination, General George Armstrong Custer delivered a eulogy to the thousands gathered near Campus Martius Park. Custer led the Michigan Brigade during the American Civil War and called them the Wolverines.|$|E

25|$|The {{history of}} University College, Bristol and {{ultimately}} the University of Bristol can be traced {{as far back as}} 1872 and the attempts of John Percival, a local educationalist and headmaster of Clifton College, to press {{for the creation of a}} college. Percival was a supporter of the education of women, having founded an Association for the Promotion of the Higher Education of Women in 1868, and an Association for the Promotion of Evening Classes a year later. Percival's strong Christian religious views (he later became a Bishop) influenced his views on education, in that he believed that opportunities should be available to both males and females irrespective of their declared faith. He is credited with the initial idea that there should be a University in Bristol. Lewis Fry, a later influence on the College and the subsequent University, <b>is</b> <b>quoted</b> <b>as</b> <b>saying</b> that it was to Pervical that they owed the foundation of the College.|$|E
25|$|Freddie Ross {{worked as}} his {{publicist}} from 1954, and became {{more involved in}} his life, eventually becoming his mistress. He divorced Cicely in 1965, and married Ross in December of that year. This second marriage was short-lived. During these years, Hancock was also involved with Joan Le Mesurier (née Malin), the new wife of actor John Le Mesurier, Hancock's best friend and a regular supporting character-actor from his television series. Joan was later to describe the relationship in her book Lady Don't Fall Backwards, including the claim that her husband readily forgave the affair; {{if it had been}} anyone else, he <b>is</b> <b>quoted</b> <b>as</b> <b>saying,</b> he wouldn't have understood it, but with Tony Hancock, it made sense. In July 1966, Freddie took an overdose, but survived. Arriving in Blackpool to record an edition of his variety series, Hancock was met by pressmen asking about his wife's attempted suicide. The final dissolution of the marriage took place a few days ahead of Hancock's own suicide.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, Tavis Morello , an Eagle Scout, {{and staff}} member working at Yawgoog Scout Reservation {{was fired for}} admitting he was gay to Scouting Official Gary Savignano, who then {{proceeded}} to confiscated Morello's Eagle Scout card. Director of the Narragansett Council at the time, Lyle Antonides, defended the action stating that “I think this young man is {{just trying to get}} a headline.” In response to the firing of their fellow staff member, {{the vast majority of the}} Reservations staff staged a sit-in as a sign of support, causing the camp to shut down. Following this, GLAD and the Rhode Island affiliate of the ACLU looked into the situation. ACLU Executive Director Steven Brown <b>is</b> <b>quoted</b> <b>as</b> <b>saying,</b> “Based on the information I’ve heard, this person was terminated because he acknowledged he was gay. And that’s illegal.” Due to mounting legal pressures and increasing amounts of negative publicity, by the end of the camping season, the Narragansett Council had reversed its decision and offered to reinstate Morello, both as an employee and as an Eagle Scout.|$|E

25|$|In 2009, a five-part series, , on the Showtime Network, refuted {{many of the}} long-held {{misconceptions about}} the AFL. In it, Abner Haynes tells of how his father forbade him to accept being drafted by the NFL, after drunken scouts from that league had visited the Haynes home; the NFL Cowboys' Tex Schramm <b>is</b> <b>quoted</b> <b>as</b> <b>saying</b> that if his team had ever agreed to play the AFL's Dallas Texans, they would very likely have lost; George Blanda makes a case for more AFL players being {{inducted}} to the Pro Football Hall of Fame {{by pointing out that}} Hall of Famer Willie Brown was cut by the Houston Oilers because he couldn't cover Oilers flanker Charlie Hennigan in practice. Later, when Brown was with the Broncos, Hennigan needed nine catches in one game against the Broncos to break Lionel Taylor's Professional Football record of 100 catches in one season. Hennigan caught the nine passes and broke the record, even though he was covered by Brown, Blanda's point being that if Hennigan could do so well against a Hall of Fame DB, he deserves induction, as well.|$|E
