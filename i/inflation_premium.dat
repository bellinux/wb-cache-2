40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{establish}} {{a link between}} the volatility of oil price shocks and a positive expected value of inflation in equilibrium (<b>inflation</b> <b>premium).</b> In doing so, we implement the perturbation method to solve up to second order a benchmark New Keynesian model with oil price shocks. In contrast with log linear approximations, the second order solution relaxes certainty equivalence providing {{a link between the}} volatility of shocks and <b>inflation</b> <b>premium.</b> First, we obtain analytical results for the determinants of the level of <b>inflation</b> <b>premium.</b> Thus, we find that the degree of convexity of both the marginal cost and the Phillips curve is a key element in accounting for the existence of a positive <b>inflation</b> <b>premium.</b> We further show that the level of <b>inflation</b> <b>premium</b> might be potentially large even when a central bank implements an active monetary policy. Second, we evaluate numerically the second order solution of the model to explain the episode of high and persistent inflation observed in the US during the 70 ’s. We find, in contrast with Clarida, Gali and Gertler (QJE, 2000), that even when there is no difference in the monetary policy rules between the pre-Volcker and post-Volcker periods, oil price shocks can generate high inflation levels during the 70 ’s through a positive high level of <b>inflation</b> <b>premium.</b> As by product, our analysis shows that oil price shocks along with a distorted steady state can generate a time-varying endogenous trade-off between inflation and deviations of output from its efficient level. The previous trade-off, once uncertainty is taking into account, implies that a positive level of <b>inflation</b> <b>premium</b> is an optimal response to oil price shocks. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{general equilibrium model}} in which nominal government debt pays an <b>inflation</b> risk <b>premium.</b> The model predicts that the <b>inflation</b> risk <b>premium</b> will be higher in economies which are exposed to unanticipated inflation through nominal asset holdings. In particular, the <b>inflation</b> risk <b>premium</b> is higher when government debt is primarily nominal, steady-state inflation is low, and when cash and nominal debt account for a large fraction of consumers' retirement portfolios. These channels {{do not appear to}} have been highlighted in previous models or tested empirically. Numerical results suggest that the <b>inflation</b> risk <b>premium</b> is comparable in magnitude to standard representative agent models. These findings have implications for management of government debt, since the <b>inflation</b> risk <b>premium</b> makes it more costly for governments to borrow using nominal rather than indexed debt. Simulations of an extended model with Epstein-Zin preferences suggest that increasing the share of indexed debt would enable governments to permanently lower taxes by an amount that is quantitatively non-trivial...|$|R
40|$|Investors {{and market}} analysts {{generally}} {{believe that the}} yield on a nominal bond includes an <b>inflation</b> risk <b>premium</b> to compensate investors for bearing the inflation risk associated with the bond. Knowing {{how much of a}} risk premium investors require on nominal bonds can be valuable information for policymakers. For government Treasuries, the size of the risk premium represents the potential interest savings for governments when nominal securities are replaced with real, or inflation-indexed, securities. And, because the <b>inflation</b> risk <b>premium</b> reflects perceived <b>inflation</b> uncertainty, changes {{in the size of the}} risk premium can reveal to monetary policymakers how credible their policy actions are in the marketplace. Unfortunately, empirical evidence on the actual size of the <b>inflation</b> risk <b>premium</b> and its response to market events is scarce. > To address these empirical shortcomings, Shen uses data from the United Kingdom, where about 20 percent of outstanding government debt is in the form of real bonds.

She also finds that information regarding the <b>inflation</b> risk <b>premium</b> may give useful insight to monetary policymakers.

Kochin Monthly term structures are fit to US Treasury inflation-indexed securities using a QN (Quadratic-Natural) spline, developed in this paper, and also to conventional nominal securities of comparable maturities. The ratio of the real to nominal discount functions is an implicit forward CPI function. The difference between the nominal and real forward interest rate curves is an implicit marginal <b>inflation</b> <b>premium.</b> It is demonstrated that under consumption risk-neutrality per Stanley Fischer (1975), this <b>inflation</b> <b>premium</b> does not equal expected future inflation per Irving Fisher (1896, 1930), but rather incorporates a weighted average of expectations about the future course of inflation, that tends to give greater weight to low inflation scenarios than to high. The method is applied to 29 dates since {{the introduction of the}} 30 -year indexed bond in April 1998. Nominal interest rate volatility is 2 - 2. 5 times greater (in terms of standard deviation) than real interest rate volatility, nominal rate shocks are highly correlated with shocks to the <b>inflation</b> <b>premium,</b> and real interest rate shocks are nearly orthogonal to <b>inflation</b> <b>premium</b> shocks. To date, there is no evidence against the log expectations hypothesis for real interest rates, nor against the Fisher hypothesis for the <b>inflation</b> <b>premium.</b> There is only weak evidence against the Fischer hypothesis. No evidence is found that the estimated forward rate beyond 30 years is nondecreasing over time, or even has lessened variance, despite the argument of Dybvig, Ingersoll and Ross (1996) that the asymptotic long-term forward rate and zero-coupon rate cannot fall without generating arbitrage opportunit [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a fully micro-founded New Keynesian framework {{to study the}} interaction between oil price volatility, pricing behavior of firms and monetary policy. We show that when oil has low substitutability, firms find it optimal to charge higher relative prices as a premium in compensation for the risk that oil price volatility generates on their marginal costs. Overall, in general equilibrium, {{the interaction of the}} aforementioned mechanisms produces a positive relationship between oil price volatility and average inflation, which we denominate <b>inflation</b> <b>premium.</b> We characterize analytically this relationship by using the perturbation method to solve the rational expectations equilibrium of the model up to second order of accuracy. The solution implies that the <b>inflation</b> <b>premium</b> is higher when: a) oil has low substitutability, b) the Phillips Curve is convex, and c) the central bank puts higher weight on output fluctuations.

40|$|For {{expectations}} of price inflation to affect interest rates, they must affect {{the behavior of}} borrowers and lenders or both. This paper analyzes {{the emergence of the}} <b>inflation</b> <b>premium</b> in long-term interest rates as the explicit result of borrowers' and lenders' behavior in the bond market in response to price expectations. The object of this analysis is not only to estimate the magnitude of the <b>inflation</b> <b>premium</b> due to this portfolio behavior but also to evaluate the respective contributions to it of borrowers' and lenders' responses. The empirical results presented in this paper indicate that both borrowers' and lenders' portfolio behavior {{play an important role in}} the relationship between interest rates and inflation expectations. Estimation results for U. S. data provide evidence that, all other things equal, nonfinancial business corporations increase their supply (net issuance) of bonds in response to an increase in expected inflation; these results mirror the bond investors' responses found by the author in a previous paper. Partial equilibrium experiments based on the combined model of bond supply and bond demand indicate that, all other things equal, the port-folio responses to expected price inflation by borrowers and lenders together increase the bond yield by 2 / 3 %, and modestly decrease the net quantity of bonds issued and purchased, in response to a 1 % increase in expected inflation. This result follows as the consequence of a slightly greater response by lenders than by borrowers. ...|$|E

The dataset is carefully constructed to ensure that at every point in time the series are aligned with the information set available to traders. Furthermore, we adopt a Bayesian variable selection procedure to deal with the strong multicollinearity in the variables that potentially can explain the movements in the <b>inflation</b> risk <b>premium.</b> We find that the <b>inflation</b> risk <b>premium</b> turned negative, {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic, during the post-Lehman period. This confirms the recent finding by Camp- bell et al. (2016) that nominal bonds are no longer "inflation bet" but have turned into "deflation hedges". We also find, and contrary to common beliefs, that indicators of inflation uncertainty alone cannot explain the movements in the <b>inflation</b> risk <b>premium</b> in the post-Lehman period. The decline in the <b>inflation</b> risk <b>premium</b> seems mostly related to increased deflation fears and the belief that inflation will stay far away from the monetary policy target rather than declining inflation uncertainty.

We extract private sector expectations of inflation from this model and establish that they are driven by inflation, real activity and one latent factor, which is correlated with survey forecasts. We show that the interest rate responds to this "survey" factor. The <b>inflation</b> <b>premium</b> and out-of-sample estimates of the inflation long-run mean and persistence suggest that monetary policy became effective over time.

40|$|During the Last {{three years}} {{mortgage}} rates have risen relative to yields on comparable maturity bonds. The questions {{addressed in the}} present paper are what is the extent of this increase and to what is it attributable? We find the increase between early 198 and early 1981 in coupon rates on GNMA mortgage pools relative to ''the" rate on a comparable portfolio of Treasury bonds to be about 100 basis points. We attribute the increase to {{a rise in the}} terminations premia built into mortgage coupon rates. The premia is the price borrowers are charged for the option to repay the mortgage when it is to their benefit (to refinance if interest rates decline). This price has risen in response to an increase in interest rate uncertainty.

When the model is estimated under the restriction that the implied average 10 -year term premium matches the observed premium, it turns out that risk aversion and habit only need to rise slightly, while the increase in the term premium is achieved by a drop in the monetary policy parameter that governs the aggressiveness of the monetary policy rule. A less aggressive policy increases the persistence of the reaction of inflation and the short interest rate to any shock, reinforces the covariance between the marginal rate of substitution of consumption and bond prices, turns positive the contribution of the <b>inflation</b> <b>premium</b> and drives the term premium up.

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore the {{mortgage}} affordability problem in Ghana, an issue that has been associated inter alia with high mortgage rates, which results from the high cost of capital, an unstable macroeconomy and unfavourable borrowers’ characteristics. Concurrent improvements in both the macroeconomy and borrowers’ characteristics have rendered the identification of the most problematic mortgage pricing determinant difficult, consequently making the targeting of policy interventions problematic. Design/methodology/approach This research sought to resolve this aforementioned difficulty by providing empirical evidence on the relative importance of mortgage pricing determinants. A data set of mortgage rates of selected Ghanaian banking financial institutions from 2003 to 2013 was examined and analysed by applying Fisher’s model of interest rates and an ex post analysis of the standard regression coefficients. Findings The risk premium factor emerged as the most important determinant in Ghana compared with the <b>inflation</b> <b>premium</b> and the real risk-free rate, although all are statistically significant and strongly correlated with mortgage rates. Originality/value This study provides an insight on the relative importance of mortgage pricing determinates and subsequent macro-economic guidance to support policy interventions which could reduce mortgage rates/enhance mortgage affordability. The paper specifically aims to engender wider debate and provide guidance to the Ghanaian Government and/or private enterprises that seek to provide affordable mortgages. Further research is proposed which could explore ways of reducing mortgage rates as a means of engendering social equality and adopt innovative international best practice that has already been tried and tested in countries such as South Africa and the USA...|$|E
40|$|A {{measure of}} the {{credibility}} of monetary policy is the <b>inflation</b> risk <b>premium</b> embodied in nominal yields. This will be time varying and can be estimated by combining {{the information contained in}} the nominal term structure of interest rates with that in the real term structure of inflation-indexed bonds. Information can also be obtained about the real risk premium, and about expected inflation. We estimate these risk premia using a generalization of the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) affine-yield model. We use a one-factor model of the real term structure based on monthly observations on two-year, five-year and ten-year UK index-linked debt, and a two-factor model of the nominal term structure for the corresponding nominal yields. Our estimates show that the <b>inflation</b> risk <b>premium</b> contributes on average about 100 basis points to nominal yields. Since the exit from the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) this has fallen to about 70 basis points. This shows the greater credibility of monetary policy in recent years. The real risk premium is much higher, and has fluctuated between 170 and 260 basis points since exit from the ERM, reflecting uncertainty about the real economy.

The yield differential between TIPS and comparable nominal coupon securities is not a direct measure of inflation expectations, because it contains <b>inflation</b> risk <b>premium,</b> and because the TIPS yield may depart from the true "real yield," due to low investor demand especially in the early years. Without using data from the (indexed) real bond market, we cannot fully identify the real interest rate from the <b>inflation</b> risk <b>premium,</b> unless we assume that all information affecting the real term structure is reflected in the nominal bond prices. Even with this assumption, empirical identification of the real term structure is hard to achieve because of the poor measurement and the frequent revisions of the price series. We develop a flexible multifactor term-structure model to allow for suitable specifications of liquidity premium on TIPS, as well as complications caused by lagged indexation. We estimate the model by the Kalman filter using TIPS yields, nominal bond yields, realized inflation and survey data on interest rates and inflationTIPS, <b>Inflation</b> risk <b>premium,</b> term structure of interest rates...|$|R

The results indicate a predictable <b>inflation</b> risk <b>premium</b> for conventional bonds but no ex-ante risk compensation for indexed bonds.
