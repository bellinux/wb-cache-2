2500|$|In {{discussing}} the film's English dub, Mike Crandol of Anime News Network determined that [...] "the remarkably strong {{performances of the}} main cast overshadow the weaker voice work present", though he criticized the script for being [...] "slightly hammy" [...] in parts.

2500|$|Other vessels {{sometimes}} {{named in}} the transcript include the carriers Enterprise, Coral Sea and Nimitz, and the Missouri, a battleship. The location of the exchange has also sometimes been claimed to be Puget Sound, or {{off the coast of}} North Carolina, some other times the lighthouse is located at Cape Finisterre (Spain). (The Spanish version expands the joke by having the lighthouse keeper respond to the aircraft carrier's inventory of the fleet by saying he's accompanied by [...] "our dog, our food, two beers, and a canary that's currently asleep.") Some versions relocate it to the Irish or Scottish coasts; in the former case the ship is sometimes identified as British, with the conversation taking place off the coast of Kerry in 1998. There is sometimes an additional line of dialogue where the lighthouse keeper tells the ship captain he is a Seaman First Class before the <b>final</b> <b>exchange.</b> The prefatory information sometimes notes it was released in response to a request under the Freedom of Information Act, and/or names Jeremy Boorda, the incumbent Chief of Naval Operations on the stated date.|$|E

5000|$|After exiting their {{respective}} provincial championships at the semi-final stages, Dublin and Limerick {{faced each other}} in a do-or-die qualifier meeting on 11 July 2015. A keen encounter was expected but Limerick showed better from the off and quickly moved nine points clear. Dublin eventually hit form and added five unanswered points to close the gap at the interval. Dublin kept up the pressure on the restart, where Paul Ryan and Liam Rushe impressed. [...] "Dotsy" [...] O'Callaghan pounced for Dublin's only goal after a defensive mix-up by Limerick. The <b>final</b> <b>exchanges</b> were tense, however, Dublin held out to win by 1-17 to 1-16.|$|R

5000|$|Hubbard {{notes the}} absence of a closing narrative, after Mopsus and Lycidas <b>final</b> song <b>exchange.</b> He likens this to Virgils Eclogues II and VIII and notes that [...] "the effect is again one of {{open-ended}} doubt and ambiguity".

50|$|The 30-gun, 450-ton Medemblik ran aground and {{was left}} behind for the exultant Spanish. Juan de Amézquita boarded her and {{extinguished}} the slow fuse that was burning toward her magazine. De Haro was unable to savor the victory because a cannon had exploded near him during these <b>final</b> <b>exchanges,</b> spraying him with two dozen fragments that eventually killed him. Hendricksz, meanwhile, retired to San Francisco Bay for a month {{to recover from the}} setback. In addition to the loss of Medemblik, numerous other Dutch vessels had sustained damage, and 200 men have perished (as opposed to 17 Spanish fatalities during the siege). Hendricksz nonetheless detached his five best vessels on a privateering cruise toward Santo Domingo before attempting to lead his entire fleet west again in late November. Driven back by storms, he cruised south toward Isla Margarita (Venezuela), despite advance warnings having preceded him.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the optimal trade and hedging decisions of a competitive exporting firm which faces concurrently hedgeable {{exchange rate risk}} and non-hedgeable inflation risk. The macroeconomic interaction between exchange rate and domestic inflation rate risk is described by a state variable. The (strong) correlation is pivotal in determining the optimal risk management. It is shown how optimal hedging strategies are affected by state-dependent preferences of the firm. The optimal hedge policy is to minimize the variation of marginal utility of final wealth across states of nature instead of minimizing the variance of <b>final</b> wealth. <b>Exchange</b> rate risk, inflation risk, state-dependent preferences, hedging, strong correlation,...|$|R

50|$|Kneiphof's {{fourth and}} <b>final</b> stock <b>exchange</b> opened in 1875 in Vordere Vorstadt, along the {{southern}} shore of the Pregel opposite the island of Kneiphof. The two-storied building was constructed by the Bremen architect Heinrich Müller from 1870-75.

Königsberg's merchants considered the building to have {{been built in the}} Northern Italian Neo-Renaissance style. Aside from its business activities, the building also hosted concerts and political meetings. Because the Kunsthalle was used by the German Army's postal service during World War I, exhibitions were held instead at the stock exchange.|$|R
5000|$|This <b>final</b> gentlemanly <b>exchange</b> displeased the vice-roy Martim Afonso de Castro, {{who would}} have {{preferred}} to allow Noronha's ship to continue burning and take the Dutch flagship down with it. D. Henrique de Noronha was promptly dismissed from the command of the Mercês, and replaced by another. [...] Matelief de Jonge deemed that the losses suffered were too much and ordered the Dutch fleet to disengage and abandoned the fight. The battle was won by the Portuguese, but the failed Dutch attack marked the beginning of a serious threat to their dominance in the archipelago, which culminated in a massive Dutch-Johor-Aceh assault 30 years after which broke the gates and mights of the fortress of Malacca.|$|R
