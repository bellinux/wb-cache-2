5|$|Due to {{its history}} of {{generating}} great earthquakes (1857, 1906) {{the focal point}} of earthquake <b>hazard</b> <b>assessment</b> in California has been the strike-slip San Andreas System of faults. However, a system of faults, including the Sierra Madre–Cucamonga Fault System that runs along the border of the San Gabriel and San Fernando Valleys, has also caused a series of moderate to large events in the Greater Los Angeles Area. The westernmost portion of this fault system ruptured in 1971 and has been identified as one of six major fault systems that pose a threat to the highly populated region.|$|E

25|$|Regional geology {{can have}} a large effect on the {{characteristics}} of ground motion. The site response of the ground motion may vary in different locations of the city according to the local geology. A seismic zonation map for a whole country may, therefore, be inadequate for detailed seismic <b>hazard</b> <b>assessment</b> of the cities. This necessitates the development of microzonation maps for big cities for detailed seismic hazard analysis. Microzonation maps can serve as a basis for evaluating site-specific risk analysis, which is essential for critical structures like nuclear power plants, subways, bridges, elevated highways, sky trains and dam sites. Seismic microzonation can be considered as the preliminary phase of earthquake risk mitigation studies. It requires multi-disciplinary contributions as well as comprehensive understanding of the effects of earthquake generated ground motions on man made structures. Many large cities around the world have put effort into developing microzonation maps for the better understanding of earthquake hazard within the cities.|$|E
25|$|Other {{volcanic}} techniques, such as hazard mapping, {{displays a}} volcano's eruptive history in detail and speculates {{an understanding of}} the hazardous activity that could possibly be expected in the future. At present no hazard maps have been created for Mount Cayley because the level of knowledge is insufficient due to its remoteness. A large volcanic hazard program has never existed within the Geological Survey of Canada. The majority of information has been collected in a lengthy, separate way from the support of several employees, such as volcanologists and other geologic scientists. Current knowledge is best established at Mount Meager just north of Mount Cayley and is likely to rise considerably with a temporary mapping and monitoring project. Knowledge at Mount Cayley and other volcanoes in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt is not as established, but certain contributions are being done at least Mount Cayley. An intensive program classifying infrastructural exposure near young Canadian volcanoes and quick <b>hazard</b> <b>assessment</b> at each individual volcanic edifice associated with recent seismic activity would be in advance and would produce a quick and productive determination of priority areas for further efforts.|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to the spill, [...] of fisheries were closed. The order was lifted after six weeks when the Office of Environmental Health <b>Hazard</b> <b>Assessment</b> determined that the area’s seafood was safe to eat and posed “no significant health threat.” The closure impacted commercial fishermen and fishing charters. Local commercial fishermen reported that {{it was tough to}} sell the fish caught outside of the closed area because of the impression that all of the region’s seafood was tainted from the oil spill. There is also a long term concern that the oil may have wiped out the main food source for some sea life in the area.

2500|$|Assemblyman John Laird, D-Santa Cruz, {{introduced}} Assembly Concurrent Resolution 117, {{calling on}} the Departments of Food and Agriculture and Pesticide Regulation, the Office of Environmental Health <b>Hazard</b> <b>Assessment</b> and other state agencies to answer unresolved questions. [...] He stated, [...] "It {{is the responsibility of}} our government to demonstrate its LBAM actions are necessary and do not compromise human or environmental health,” Laird said. “It isn’t the responsibility of the people to demonstrate the reverse." [...] The resolution uses a fast track process in the state House and Senate which does not require the Governor's signature. [...] Laird's Invasive Pest Planning Act of 2008, AB 2763, passed the Assembly Environmental Safety and Toxic Materials Committee by a vote of 4–0 on April 2 of 2008. [...] On March 22, 2008, San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom wrote a public letter to the Governor urging him to study health consequences before continuing with the spray campaign. [...] He cited relevant state legislation and asked the governor to sign the bills into law immediately.|$|E
2500|$|Landslide hazard {{analysis}} and mapping can provide useful information for catastrophic loss reduction, and {{assist in the}} development of guidelines for sustainable land use planning. The analysis is used to identify the factors that are related to landslides, estimate the relative contribution of factors causing slope failures, establish a relation between the factors and landslides, and to predict the landslide hazard in the future based on such a relationship. The factors that have been used for landslide {{hazard analysis}} can usually be grouped into geomorphology, geology, land use/land cover, and hydrogeology. Since many factors are considered for landslide hazard mapping, GIS is an appropriate tool because it has functions of collection, storage, manipulation, display, and analysis of large amounts of spatially referenced data which can be handled fast and effectively. Cardenas reported evidence on the exhaustive use of GIS in conjunction of uncertainty modelling tools for landslide mapping. [...] Remote sensing techniques are also highly employed for landslide <b>hazard</b> <b>assessment</b> and analysis. Before and after aerial photographs and satellite imagery are used to gather landslide characteristics, like distribution and classification, and factors like slope, lithology, and land use/land cover to be used to help predict future events. Before and after imagery also helps to reveal how the landscape changed after an event, what may have triggered the landslide, and shows the process of regeneration and recovery.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the same}} month, Rochelle Tyl, {{author of two}} studies used by FDA to assert BPA safety in August 2008, said those studies did not claim that BPA is safe, {{because they were not}} {{designed}} to cover all aspects of the chemical's effects. In May 2009, Minnesota and Chicago were the first US jurisdictions to pass regulations limiting or banning BPA. In June 2009, the FDA announced its decision to reconsider the BPA safety levels. Grassroots political action led Connecticut to become the first US state to ban bisphenolA not only from infant formula and baby food containers, but also from any reusable food or beverage container. [...] In July 2009, the California Environmental Protection Agency's Developmental and Reproductive Toxicity Identification Committee in the California Office of Environmental Health <b>Hazard</b> <b>Assessment</b> unanimously voted against placing BisphenolA on the state's list of chemicals that are believed to cause reproductive harm. The panel was concerned over the growing scientific evidence showing BPA's reproductive harm in animals, found that there was insufficient data of the effects in humans. Critics pointed out that the same panel failed to add second-hand smoke to the list until 2006, and only one chemical was added to the list in the last three years. In September, the US Environmental Protection Agency announced that it was evaluating BPA for an action plan development. [...] In October, the NIH announced $30,000,000 in stimulus grants to study the health effects of BPA. This money was supposed to result in many peer-reviewed publications.|$|E
