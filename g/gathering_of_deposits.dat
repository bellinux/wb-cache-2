5000|$|During an {{interview}} with Yale's international center of finance, he stated that capital markets {{would be much better}} off under the Glass-Steagall legislation (provisions in the U.S. Banking Act of 1933 that limits the interaction between stock activities within commercial and investment banks). He stated that [...] "commercial banking serves a very important, useful function: <b>gathering</b> <b>of</b> <b>deposits</b> and making of loans, and if we define that function very narrowly and regulate it very heavily and required it to maintain a high level of capital then the capital environment would be much safer." ...|$|E
50|$|A SIV may {{be thought}} of as a very simple virtual {{non-bank}} financial institution (i.e. it does not accept <b>deposits).</b> Instead <b>of</b> <b>gathering</b> <b>deposits</b> from the public, it borrows cash from the money market by selling short maturity (often less than a year) instruments called commercial paper (CP), medium term notes (MTNs) and public bonds to professional investors. SIVs had the highest ratings of AAA/Aaa, as a result of their very high quality portfolio requirements, almost zero exposure to interest rate and FX risk and large capital base (compared to traditional banks). This enabled them to borrow at interest rates close to the LIBOR, the rate at which banks lend to each other. The gathered funds are then used to purchase long term (longer than a year) bonds with credit ratings of between AAA and BBB. These assets earned higher interest rates, typically 0.25% to 0.50% higher than the cost of funding. The difference in interest rates represents the profit that the SIV pays to the capital note holders part of which return is shared with the investment manager.|$|R
