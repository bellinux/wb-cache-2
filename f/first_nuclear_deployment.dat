His first proposal, Type AM, was not practical for marine uses but became the core of the <b>first</b> <b>nuclear</b> power plant in Obninsk, commissioned in 1954.

40|$|An {{important}} {{fraction of}} the future energy demand may be satisfied by nuclear power. In this context, the possibilities of worldwide <b>nuclear</b> <b>deployment</b> are studied. We {{are convinced that the}} Molten Salt Reactors may {{play a central role in}} this deployment. The Molten Salt Reactor needs to be coupled to a reprocessing unit in order to extract the Fission Products which poison the core. The efficiency of this reprocessing has a crucial influence on reactor behavior especially for the breeding ratio. The Molten Salt Breeder Reactor project was based on an intensive reprocessing for high breeding purposes. A new concept of Thorium Molten Salt Reactor is presented here. Including this new concept in the worldwide <b>nuclear</b> <b>deployment,</b> to satisfy these power needs, we consider three typical scenarios, based o...|$|R

40|$|Why do {{countries}} deploy {{nuclear weapons}} abroad? Since 1945, {{more than twenty}} states have hosted foreign nuclear weapons on their territory, and five countries {{continue to do so}} today. These deployments have important consequences for international security, yet there is little systematic research about the factors that drive them. In this article, we develop three broad theoretical frameworks to explain why foreign <b>nuclear</b> <b>deployments</b> occur. Using a new data set of foreign <b>nuclear</b> <b>deployments</b> between 1945 and 2000, we find that two factors weigh heavily in driving these deployments: the protection of allies and the projection of military power. Nonproliferation motives, however, appear to play little role. The results carry important implications for our understanding of the causes of proliferation and the sources of nuclear posture.

40|$|In {{the article}} we {{discussed}} several robustness checks {{that we did}} not have space to report. This online appendix presents the findings from eight additional tests, reported in Tables 1 and 2. • Cox regression. We showed that our findings are similar when we code the initiation of foreign <b>nuclear</b> <b>deployments</b> only, dropping observations in years after deployments first occur (see Table 4 in the original article). We replicated that analysis using Cox regression instead of logit with corrections for temporal dependence, and the findings are similar (model A 1). • Rare events logit. Because foreign <b>nuclear</b> <b>deployments</b> occur relatively infrequently, we replicated our model using rare events logit. The results are largely unaltered (model A 2). • NWFZ membership. One factor for which we did not control in our initial tests is whether the potential host state is party to a Nuclear Weapons Free Zone (NWFZ) treaty. However, model A 3 shows that our findings are similar when we include this variable in our analysis. 1 It is also noteworthy that the NWFZ variable is statisticall...|$|R

40|$|Nuclear {{weapons have}} played an {{important}} role in China's national strategy. China’s nuclear doctrine has a very strong continuity. Nevertheless, China has made readjustments in its nuclear doctrine according to the changes of its internal and external situation and its general strategic threat perception. China’s nuclear doctrine has experienced a process of evolution from anti-nuclear blackmail to minimum deterrence. There are five major parts in China's nuclear doctrine: policy of declaration, <b>nuclear</b> development, <b>nuclear</b> <b>deployment,</b> <b>nuclear</b> employment, and nuclear disarmament. Because China is faced with a different situation from other nuclear powers and has its own strategic culture, China has a nuclear doctrine with its own characteristics.

40|$|Abstract“Nuclear {{energy is}} part of a {{sustainable}} energy future” is a conclusion which is increasingly reached by a variety of energy scenario studies by world-renown institutions such as the IAEA, OECD/IEA & OECD/NEA, World Energy Council, and also reached by different national energy assessment reports. Nuclear does own various unique features that make this energy technology a prime candidate to fulfil a large part of our energy needs, beyond today;s use of nuclear energy for our electricity needs. The previous ‘wave’ of <b>nuclear</b> energy <b>deployment</b> since the 1970 s was, and still is, governed by the use of 235 U as main driver to spur this <b>deployment</b> of <b>nuclear</b> energy with gradually the introduction of the U/Pu - cycle in the thermal neutron spectrum reactor park (essentially LWR-technology). Technological progress and good economics of the U/Pu-cycle and especially the economic competitiveness of the LWR's have made this U/Pu -cycle essentially the standard worldwide. Fast spectrum reactors (FRs) haven’t yet been developed at sufficient large and industrial scale to make full benefit of the U/Pu-cycle and there are no prospects that the world would massively turn to such FRs in the immediate future. On the verge of a second wave of <b>nuclear</b> <b>deployment,</b> increasing interest is and has to be given to synergies between various nuclear reactor technologies and especially the global nuclear fuel cycle as enabler towards sustainable <b>nuclear</b> energy <b>deployment.</b> Those synergies aim at a reduced reliance on natural uranium resources, continued good economic competitiveness of nuclear energy in local markets, safe and non-proliferant use of nuclear energy, and a reduction of ultimate wastes to be disposed of. This paper provides an overview of various avenues towards sustainable <b>nuclear</b> energy <b>deployment</b> and perspectives from the nuclear industry leader AREVA...|$|R
