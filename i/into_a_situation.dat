25|$|In {{his book}} Slaughter at Halbe, Tony Le Tissier accused General Busse {{of failing to}} {{exercise}} effective command {{and control of the}} encircled army, thereby contributing to the failure of successive break-out attempts. Le Tissier writes that Busse's initial movement of his HQ put him <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> where he lost the ability to control the formations in the pocket, and in his break-out plan, Ninth Army HQ was to be placed immediately behind the spearhead of the breakout, the 502nd SS Heavy Tank Battalion, which effectively reduced his ability to exercise command to the tactical level. He also accuses Busse of failing to adequately support the first breakout attempt (see below). The spearhead for the Ninth Army break-out plan on April 28 was to be the 502nd SS Heavy Panzer Battalion with remaining elements of the Panzergrenadier Division Kurmark. These units were split into two wedges. The northern wedge included the 502nd SS Panzer, Ninth Army HQ, XI SS Panzer Corps HQ, and Panzergrenadier Division Kurmark HQ. Remnants of the 21st Panzer Division were to cover in a north-westerly direction, while remnants of the 32nd SS Division 30. Januar was to cover the east and provide the rearguard.|$|E
500|$|The {{consensus}} on Ramsey's playing style among his fellow professionals {{was that he}} was rather slow, but possessed an excellent positional sense, read the game better than most, and distributed the ball exceptionally well for a defender. Taking after his Southampton captain Bill Rochford, he preferred to play the ball out of defence rather than simply clearing it as quickly as possible. He became a specialist penalty taker due to his coolness and ability to anticipate the goalkeeper. Ted Bates, one of Ramsey's Southampton teammates, described him as [...] "lacking both height and speed", but credited him with a [...] "razor-sharp brain... he would never get <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> that exposed him".|$|E
500|$|Although Miller was on {{the roster}} for all three series in the Cardinals' 2013 postseason run, manager Mike Matheny did not place him in the {{starting}} rotation. [...] Instead, he totaled a single inning in one relief appearance against the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 2013 National League Division Series (NLDS), in which he gave up one home run. [...] Matheny rebuffed the suggestion {{that he was a}} [...] "misspent asset" [...] on the 25-man roster. [...] He specified that, [...] "He's going to be a guy we’re going to use if we get <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> where we’ve got a bunch of innings to eat up, whether it's at the front end or back. [...] He's going to be our guy (if) we have to put things together." ...|$|E

500|$|During {{the second}} week of October 1997, David Duchovny was {{scheduled}} to be away from Vancouver for promotional purposes for the movie Playing God. As a result, the producers delayed shooting of the episode [...] "The Post-Modern Prometheus" [...] and developed a Scully-centric episode to take its place in the queue. With the episode scheduled to air during December, Vince Gilligan, John Shiban, and Frank Spotnitz decided to craft a Christmas episode and put Dana Scully <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> similar to that of Scrooge in the 1951 film Scrooge, starring Alastair Sim. After failing to write an episode paralleling that story, the writers decided instead to feature Scully being visited by earlier versions of herself, resulting in the flashback sequences appearing in the episode. They also decided to have her be taken on an emotional journey by her descendant.|$|E
500|$|Similar to Underworld, the new Tomb Raider {{features}} motion capture-based animation. In {{an effort}} to present realism and emotion in the character, Crystal Dynamics captured face and voice performances to accompany the body performances. The company plans to revamp Croft's in-game combat abilities. Crystal Dynamics aims to make the [...] "combat fresh to the franchise, competitive amongst , and relevant to the story." [...] Among the changes is {{the implementation of a}} free aiming system. The studio reasoned that such a system would cause players to be more invested in the action by fostering a [...] "raw, brutal, and desperate" [...] style. Global brand director Karl Stewart stated that such desperation relates to the updated character's inexperience with violence. He further commented that Lara Croft is thrust <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> where she is forced to kill, which will be a traumatic and defining moment for her.|$|E
500|$|... "Harvest Festival" [...] was {{the first}} episode of the season written and {{produced}} separately from the second season. The previous six episodes from the third season were filmed almost immediately after the second season ended {{as part of an}} early shooting schedule to accommodate Poehler's pregnancy. Series co-creator Michael Schur described it as a particularly empowering episode for the Leslie Knope character: [...] "When you see this episode [...] it makes you love her even more. This episode is about Leslie being noticed for the incredible hard work she does." [...] Schur also said he believed the subplot with April and Andy was one that several young people in their situation have faced in real life: [...] "Andy is put <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> {{that a lot of people}} have been put into in our lives and he does the exact wrong thing you can do. And that's sort of the template for them going forward is what's the wrongest thing you can do? That's sort of how we follow them." [...] Chris Pratt said he believed the conflict provided strong romantic and comedic potential for the characters: [...] "There definitely will be conflict in their relationship [...] there's still a lot of room for comedy in there, because we have good writers." ...|$|E

Upon meeting Snow, Noel develops a hatred of him because of the former's impulsive attitude. Eventually, Noel gains respect for Snow. As they travel, his memories are restored, and he tries to dissuade Serah from continuing, as her visions of the future would soon kill her.

500|$|Usher and Minaj {{shot the}} music video on March 9, 2010 in Los Angeles with {{director}} Taj Stansberry, represented by Leah Harmony and Ciarra Pardo. In {{an interview with}} Vibe, Stansberry commented on the video's sex appeal and the pairing of Usher and Minaj, stating, [...] "This probably {{has the potential to}} be [...] Usher’s one of the best entertainers in the world, then you have Nicki Minaj who’s fresh on the scene. Put them together and there’s just sparks, it was real good." [...] When asked about the music video's concept would redefine the word [...] "freak", commenting: [...] "My general idea was to take the word and show its many faceted sides, twisting and turning it to where there’s really no distinguishing between one freak and another. Usher went there. When you’re engaging in sexual activity, there are many transitions and this is not about what they look like literally, but what they look like metaphorically. It’s about luring people <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation.</b> Because you have your thoughts on a ménage à trois, but then we’re doing it in a non-obvious way." [...] On Minaj and her pairing with Usher, Stansberry said, [...] " [...] had a few looks that I really liked. She played the part, but still was her. If you really listen to her words in the song, you can kinda visualize her outfit." [...] Stansberry also confirmed that R singer Ciara and singer-actor Jamie Foxx would make appearances in the video. In an interview with MTV News on the set of her video for [...] "Massive Attack", Minaj said that [...] "The video is freaky. And it's a great concept, a great story line," [...] Minaj told MTV News. [...] "It felt just like one of the sequels to Saw. It was dope." [...] Stating that the video had a [...] "secret society" [...] concept, Usher told Access Hollywood that the place symbolized locations where people use to get away from pressures, and also said the movie Eyes Wide Shut was some sort of inspiration of the video. On March 22, 2010 a thirty second preview of the music video was surfaced onto the internet. Two days later on March 24, 2010, Usher premiered the full music video on BET's 106 & Park.|$|E

2500|$|In a {{parliamentary}} state, {{the head of}} government depends on {{the confidence of the}} parliamentary majority and has the right to form coalitions to ensure their policies have majority support. However, in Germany, the Chancellor depended on the confidence of the Emperor alone, and Wilhelm believed that the Emperor had the right to be informed before his minister's meeting. After a heated argument in Bismarck's office, Wilhelm—to whom Bismarck had shown a letter from Tsar Alexander III describing Wilhelm as a [...] "badly brought-up boy"—stormed out, after first ordering the rescinding of the Cabinet Order of 1851, which had forbidden Prussian Cabinet Ministers from reporting directly to the King of Prussia and required them instead to report via the Chancellor. Bismarck, forced for the first time <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> that he could not use to his advantage, wrote a blistering letter of resignation, decrying Wilhelm's interference in foreign and domestic policy. The letter, however, was published only after Bismarck's death.|$|E

But while demonstrating his gratitude with frequent visits, Alfred becomes desirous of Georges' young and beautiful wife, Zélie, who like Georges is a mulatto. Zélie is virtuous and dignified, and rejects Alfred. He finally lures her <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> where he can attempt to rape her, but she pushes him away so forcefully that he falls and sustains a head injury. Zélie knows at once that by the Code noir she will have to die: [...] "Any slave who strikes his master, his mistress, the husband of his mistress, or their children, causing bruises or effusion of blood shall be punished by death." [...] Although Georges begs Alfred to pardon her, Zélie is executed by hanging. Georges escapes to the depths of the forest, where he joins the slave rebels or Maroons and bides his time.|$|E
2500|$|The US and Britain had {{to import}} food into their zones, even as Britain was financially {{exhausted}} and dependent on food imports having fought Nazi Germany {{for the entire}} war, including as the sole opponent from June 1940 to June 1941 (the period when Poland and France were defeated, the Soviet Union supported Nazi Germany, and the United States had not yet entered the war). Consequently, Britain had to incur additional debt to the US, and the US had to spend more {{for the survival of}} its zone, while the Soviets gained applause among Eastern Europeans — many of whom were impoverished by the war and German occupation — who plundered the belongings of expellees, often before they were actually expelled. Since the Soviet Union was the only power among the Allies that allowed and/or encouraged the looting and robbery in the area under its military influence, the perpetrators and profiteers blundered <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> in which they became dependent on the perpetuation of Soviet rule in their countries to not be dispossessed of the booty and to stay unpunished. With ever more expellees sweeping into post-war Germany, the Allies moved towards a policy of assimilation, which was believed to {{be the best way to}} stabilise Germany and ensure peace in Europe by preventing the creation of a marginalised population.
