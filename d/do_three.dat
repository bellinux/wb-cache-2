You can't just go back to: 'You have no emotions.' 'I don't care.' You've got to move on somewhere and make sure the other characters have something of a journey too."

2500|$|After The Old Vic season ended, Burton's {{contract}} with Fox {{required him to}} <b>do</b> <b>three</b> more films. The first was Prince of Players (1955), where he was cast as the 19th-century Shakespearean actor Edwin Booth, who was John Wilkes Booth's brother. Maggie McNamara played Edwin's wife, Mary Devlin Booth. Philip thought the script was [...] "a disgrace" [...] to Burton's name. The film's director Philip Dunne observed, [...] "He hadn't mastered yet the tricks of the great movie stars, such as Gary Cooper, who knew them all. The personal magnetism Richard had on the sound stage didn't come through the camera." [...] This was one aspect that troubled Richard throughout his career on celluloid. The film flopped {{at the box office}} and has since been described as [...] "the first flop in CinemaScope". Crowther, however, lauded Burton's scenes where he performed Shakespeare plays such as Richard III.|$|E
2500|$|The film trilogy {{would not}} {{directly}} tie into the Stargate SG-1 series.

I think the series could still live on {{at the end of the}} third sequel. So we're going to try to not tread on their stories." [...] Plans for sequels to the original film are unrelated to the development of straight-to-DVD films made as sequels to Stargate SG-1. Using some of Emmerich's notes, Bill McCay wrote a series of five novels, continuing the story the original creators had envisioned, which involved the Earth-humans, the locals and the successors of Ra. According to Devlin, he and Emmerich had always planned to <b>do</b> <b>three</b> films with the potential for more, but MGM preferred to play out the television series first.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the primary}} focus of {{heterosexual}} sex films are the women in them, who are mostly selected for their on-screen appearance, there is a definite focus on the male performers who are able to fulfill the desires of the male watching audience as their on-screen proxies. Most male performers in heterosexual pornography are generally selected less for their looks than for their sexual prowess, namely their ability to <b>do</b> <b>three</b> things: achieve an erection while on a busy and sometimes pressuring film set, maintain that erection while performing on camera, and then ejaculate on cue. In the past an actor's inability to maintain an erection or being subject to premature ejaculation could make the difference between a film turning a profit or a loss. However this problem has been solved by the use of Viagra. If an actor loses his erection, filming is forced to stop for about 45 minutes whilst the drug takes effect. Using Viagra can make the actor's face noticeably flushed, give him a headache, and make it difficult to ejaculate. According to director John Stagliano, using Viagra means [...] "You also lose a dimension." [...] "The guy's fucking without being aroused." ...|$|E
