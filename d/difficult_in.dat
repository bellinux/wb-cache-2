5|$|A {{number of}} subtypes of Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} are recognized. Despite this, {{many people have}} overlapping symptoms that can make the classification <b>difficult</b> <b>in</b> individual cases. All types have partial forms.

5|$|Although the {{resolution}} {{was not as}} strong as Mason had liked—he wanted Virginia to threaten to cut off tobacco—Mason worked in the following years for non-importation. The repeal of most of the Townshend duties (excepting that on tea) made his task more <b>difficult.</b> <b>In</b> March 1773, his wife Ann died of illness contracted after another pregnancy. Mason was the sole parent to nine children, and his commitments made him even more reluctant to accept political office that would take him from Gunston Hall.|$|E
5|$|As {{indicated}} in the table below, each basin uses a separate system of terminology, which can make comparisons between different basins <b>difficult.</b> <b>In</b> the Pacific Ocean, hurricanes from the Central North Pacific sometimes cross the 180th meridian into the Northwest Pacific, becoming typhoons (such as Hurricane/Typhoon Ioke in 2006); on rare occasions, the reverse will occur. It {{should also be noted}} that typhoons with 1-minute sustained winds greater than 67 metres per second (m/s), over , are called Super Typhoons by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.|$|E

In addition, an echocardiogram can help to eliminate other possible causes such as congenital heart defects or pulmonary arterial hypertension.|$|E
5|$|Due to the island's rocky {{topography}} {{and lack}} of a stable supply of freshwater, rice production is <b>difficult</b> <b>in</b> the island. Rice from Mindoro, Marinduque or Quezon is supplied to the island by local traders. In recent years, the island has also become a small tourist hub for Asi expatriates and foreign tourists from the United States and other countries.|$|E
5|$|During heavy rains, it {{was much}} more {{difficult}} to track insurgents by air, negating Portugal's air superiority, and Portuguese troops and vehicles found movement during rain storms <b>difficult.</b> <b>In</b> contrast, the insurgent troops, with lighter equipment, were able to flee into the bush (the mato) amongst an ethnically similar populace into which they could melt away. Furthermore, the FRELIMO forces were able to forage food from the surroundings and local villages, and were thus not hampered by long supply lines.|$|E

5|$|Nemertea use organs called protonephridia to excrete soluble waste products, {{especially}} nitrogenous by-products {{of cellular}} metabolism. In nemertean protonephridia, flame cells which filter out the wastes {{are embedded in}} the front part of the two lateral fluid vessels. The flame cells remove the wastes into two collecting ducts, one on either side, and each duct has one or more nephridiopores through which the wastes exit. Semiterrestrial and freshwater nemerteans have many more flame cells than marines, sometimes thousands. The {{reason may be that}} osmoregulation is more <b>difficult</b> <b>in</b> non-marine environments.|$|E

Masato Maegawa, president of Treasure, served as head programmer on Dynamite Headdy. After deciding to publish a localized version for overseas markets, Maegawa was told by Sega of America to make the game more difficult. This was because Sega did not want customers completing the game too easily on rental. Maegawa happily obliged, and the North American release was made about twice as <b>difficult.</b> <b>In</b> addition to changes in difficulty, most of the dialogue in the game was removed, {{and several of the}} character and boss sprites were changed.|$|E
5|$|After {{the passage}} of the cyclone, the Iran chapter of the Red Cross and its volunteers worked in {{conjunction}} with the military to distribute relief supplies to villages using trucks and helicopters.

In total, 61,558families received aid from the Red Cross in Iran. The Iranian government provided monetary relief to the affected people. Officials worked to restore roads, bridges, and power systems in the affected areas, although repairs were more <b>difficult</b> <b>in</b> some locations; by a week after the storm, several villages remained surrounded by floodwaters.|$|E
5|$|At Kelmscott Press the {{perfection}} of book-making was under his constant supervision and practical assistance. It was his ambition to produce a perfect work to restore all the beauty of illuminated lettering, richness of gilding and grace of binding that {{used to make a}} volume the treasure of a king. His efforts were constantly directed towards giving the world at least one book that exceeded anything that had ever appeared. Morris designed his type after the best examples of early printers, what he called his “golden type” which he copied after Jenson, Parautz, Coburger and others. With this in mind, Morris took equal care on the choice of his paper which he adapted to his subject with the same care that governed his selection of material for binding. As a result, few but only the wealthy could purchase his lavish works, mainly due to how intrinsic his work was. However, he realized that creating works in the manner of the middle ages was <b>difficult</b> <b>in</b> a profit-grinding society.|$|E
