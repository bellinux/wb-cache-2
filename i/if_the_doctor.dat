He or she will then fill up a {{certificate}} of cause of death (CCOD) which will be given to the family of the deceased. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> is unable to determine {{the cause of death}}, or the death is due to non-natural causes, the Criminal Procedure Code requires him to refer the case to the police. The police will provide a hearse to send the body to the Centre for Forensic Medicine (CFM) Mortuary at Block 9 of the Singapore General Hospital, which will then inform the family when to visit the mortuary.|$|E

25|$|It is very {{important}} to have a properly formatted, edited, and reviewed medical transcription document. If a medical transcriptionist accidentally typed a wrong medication or the wrong diagnosis, the patient could be at risk <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> (or his designee) did not review the document for accuracy. Both the doctor and the medical transcriptionist play an important role to make sure the transcribed dictation is correct and accurate. The doctor should speak slowly and concisely, especially when dictating medications or details of diseases and conditions. The medical transcriptionist must possess hearing acuity, medical knowledge, and good reading comprehension in addition to checking references when in doubt.|$|E

25|$|Jimmy {{manages to}} swerve and drives off while the Viperox chase after them. Helicopters fly over head and fire at flying Viperox. Stark is annoyed {{that they are}} losing, when Lord Azlok storms in and tries to get the truth of where the Doctor is. The Doctor and Seruba have escaped the vault and drive a Jeep to the base, where they see that it's under heavy attack. The Doctor is worried about getting in until Jimmy and Cassie show up with the TARDIS. The TARDIS materialises in the room in Area 51 where Rivesh is dying. In the nick of time, Seruba revives Rivesh. The Doctor asks for the device to be {{activated}} and Rivesh relishes the thought of killing the Viperox. However, the Doctor warns him not to detonate it, or it will completely wipe the Viperox out. Rivesh remains adamant on revenge, but the Doctor reinstates his beliefs and tells him that no-one should {{have the power to}} exterminate an entire species. Rivesh returns the favour of his revival and trusts the Doctor with the device. The Doctor uses his sonic screwdriver on it and then he rushes into the TARDIS and grabs a cable. At that moment, Azlok holds Jimmy hostage {{at the entrance to the}} TARDIS, threatening to kill him <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> detonates it. The Doctor says he isn't going to set it off and explains that one day the Viperox will become a peace-loving race. Azlok dismisses this as madness and advances, but the Doctor connects a cable from the TARDIS console to the device and unleashes a deafening soundwave that affects all the Viperox in the area: the Doctor then orders the Viperox to leave Earth and never return. A furious Azlok vows that the Doctor's time will come, though the Doctor dismisses the warning of his impending death, before Azlok and the rest of the Viperox retreat and flee from Earth. After the attack, Stark thanks the Doctor and Seruba and Rivesh leave in their ship. The Doctor leaves the weapon with Stark in case the Viperox ever return, and Stark warns them to keep quiet about the events. The Doctor suggests that Cassie and Jimmy clear up the Viperox mess. As the TARDIS departs, Cassie and Jimmy hold hands.|$|E
500|$|Brannon Braga {{wrote the}} story from the initial idea of the Doctor having an {{identity}} crisis, [...] "What <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> discovers that Voyager is a hologram and he is real?" [...] From there, Braga questioned the axiom [...] "I think, therefore I am" [...] {{and what it means}} to be [...] "real". [...] Calling it a [...] "creepy, philosophical quandary", Braga related the story of [...] "Projections" [...] to the work of Ren√© Descartes, where [...] "the [...] plagued by an evil demon out to prove he doesn't exist"; in this instance, Braga made Barclay (Schultz) the demon. [...] The episode was written to keep the viewer guessing as to which reality was true; Braga would later say that the fun of the episode wasn't in the story itself, but in the telling of the story, [...] "in considering all the different twists and turns along the way." ...|$|E
500|$|... "A Good Man Goes to War" [...] is {{the seventh}} episode of series six {{and also the}} 777th episode of Doctor Who, {{but there are no}} seven puns as the {{production}} team did not realise this until after shooting. The episode's idea stemmed from lead writer and executive producer Steven Moffat wondering <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor,</b> who was typically a pacifist, could be provoked enough to assemble an army. The Headless Monks were first mentioned in [...] "The Time of Angels", added to that episode's script to help explain the monastic look of the Delirium Archive the Doctor and Amy were visiting. Similar troops also known as [...] "Clerics" [...] appeared in [...] "The Time of Angels"/"Flesh and Stone"; Moffat stated it seemed many armies in the future in Doctor Who were of religious origin. The possibility of the English word [...] "doctor" [...] originating from the Doctor was a notion made by Moffat on Usenet in 1995.|$|E

500|$|Gaiman {{suggested}} they make an episode which centres on the TARDIS itself, {{which was not}} done before for the entire series since it began in 1963. The original plan focused {{on the idea of}} the Doctor being pursued by an enemy inside the TARDIS, but went through several subsequent changes; Gaiman changed the plan to focus on the companion due to the Doctor's knowledge of his ship making it too easy for him to escape his enemy, made the TARDIS the threat rather than just a specific alien to avoid making it a simple 'cat-and-mouse' game, and then included the idea of Idris to account for what happened to the TARDIS's mind during this attack. The central idea was a [...] "what if" [...] scenario {{to see what would happen}} <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> and the TARDIS got to talk together. Head writer Steven Moffat liked the idea of featuring the TARDIS as a woman, believing this to be the [...] "ultimate love story" [...] for the Doctor.|$|E
500|$|The concept behind {{having the}} episode based around an alien planet {{occurred}} to Moffat, Skinner, and producer Marcus Wilson when realising {{they had done}} big location pieces {{in the first half}} of the series with [...] "A Town Called Mercy" [...] and [...] "The Angels Take Manhattan", but had none for the second half. They decided to do a story set in [...] "a world created in our studios to make you really feel you're out there", rather than having the Doctor [...] "promise unearthly wonders to his companions, and then get them trapped in an underground tunnel". As such, the episode was designed to allow the Doctor to actually show his new companion the wonders he had promised. The production team aimed to show [...] "the best alien planet" [...] on Doctor Who. The episode originally had a different pre-credits sequence, which consisted of a long scene in the kitchen in which Clara informs the Doctor she cannot come and travel with the Doctor because she has responsibilities to her job, and the boy she takes care of asks <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> is her boyfriend. Cross's intent was to juxtapose this [...] "mundane" [...] scene with the vast scale of the planet. However, Moffat thought that at the time in the series the Doctor should be investigating Clara through her parents and Cross revised to include the leaf, an idea Moffat approved of. Originally the resolution was to be the Doctor defeating the planet with his speech, which Cross likened to [...] "facing down one of Lovecraft's Old Gods: an alien so alien that it's practically a supernatural being." [...] Moffat pointed out that the Doctor had given similar speeches before and was more interested in Clara saving the day. After thinking about it for a while, Cross realised he could incorporate the leaf into the solution.|$|E
500|$|The Doctor, {{unable to}} leave the TARDIS due to the plague, gives Rory the lens, his sonic screwdriver, {{and a pair of}} glasses through which the Doctor can see and {{communicate}} with Rory. Rory explores the complex, and runs into a group of Handbots. The robots are quickly defeated by an older and bitter Amy, who is now a vigilante with the aid of Interface, but has otherwise been unable to escape. She is angry with the Doctor, telling him she has been waiting 36 years for rescue. [...] She has been alone except for a reprogrammed Handbot called [...] "Rory". The Doctor realises they have mistakenly latched onto the wrong time stream, and urges the older Amy to help find her younger self. She refuses, knowing that if the younger Amy is rescued, she will cease to exist. Though Rory considers saving the older Amy, the Doctor warns him that by taking her aboard the TARDIS, they will forgo any chance of rescuing the younger Amy. The Doctor discovers evidence of younger Amy nearby, and instructs Rory to use the lens to communicate with her, hoping that seeing the younger, crying Amy will convince the older one to help with the rescue. The older Amy remembers this discussion from when she was younger Amy and had failed to convince the older Amy to help. However, this time the younger Amy convinces the older Amy to change her mind by asking her to consider Rory. The older Amy agrees to help <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> would take her too; the Doctor promises to do so despite the difficulty in completing the action since the TARDIS will be unable to handle the paradox of having two Amys from different timestreams aboard together.|$|E

2500|$|Aspects of Simm's {{portrayal}} of the Master parallel Tennant's Doctor, primarily {{in his ability to}} make light of tense situations and his rather quirky and hyperactive personality. According to the producers, this was done to make the Master more threatening to the Doctor by having him take one of his opponent's greatest strengths, as well as making the parallels between the two characters more distinctive. This rationale is written into dialogue by the Master in [...] "Utopia", in which he explicitly states, as he is regenerating, that <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> can be young and strong, then so can he. In an episode of Doctor Who Confidential, [...] "Lords and Masters", Russell T Davies also classifies the Master as both a sociopath and a psychopath.|$|E
2500|$|Martha {{is first}} seen in action with UNIT in [...] "The Sontaran Stratagem", where Donna Noble, the Doctor's current companion, reacts with shock asking derisively <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> turns {{all of his}} companions into [...] "soldiers". The Doctor also appears to {{disapprove}} over the situation until Martha defends her intentions, reminding the Doctor that she herself does not carry a gun, and stating that {{she is trying to}} make UNIT [...] "better" [...] from the inside. Agyeman herself states that she was never in any worry about Martha becoming too gun-toting: [...] "I never felt any danger of that happening. At the end of Series Three, she'd struggled for a year, and travelled alone, and saw all this hardship, her family tortured... that's going to have affected her. At the same time, she's continued in her studies to become a doctor, so obviously she still has this caring side to her".|$|E

2500|$|A {{recurring}} {{theme of the}} new series is the toll the loss of companions takes on the Doctor. While he would more or less easily deal with his companions' departures in the classic series, the new series shows the Doctor having a harder time recovering when a companion leaves him, especially when they do so under tragic circumstances and <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> develops a strong emotional tie beyond friendship. After losing Donna Noble, the Tenth Doctor refused to travel with a companion until after his regeneration, unable to cope with them leaving anymore. Later, the loss of Amy and Rory Williams - his parents-in-law by way of his marriage to River Song - drives the Eleventh Doctor into a deep depression, and he retreats to Victorian London where he refuses {{to get involved in}} the world's affairs anymore. Additionally, [...] "Let's Kill Hitler" [...] spotlights the Doctor's continuing guilt in relation to several past companions. An ongoing subplot of Series 9 (2015) dealt with the Twelfth Doctor's growing fear over the potential of losing Clara Oswald. Her death in [...] "Face the Raven" [...] leads the Doctor to undertake extreme measures to undo her fate, as depicted in the Series 9 finale [...] "Heaven Sent"/"Hell Bent". The impact of the death of his wife, River Song, is a subplot of both [...] "The Husbands of River Song" [...] and [...] "The Return of Doctor Mysterio".|$|E
2500|$|Importantly, Lisa and Martha {{are both}} {{represented}} as characters who, rather than lack social skills, play [...] "a central role within their families‚Äô relationships" [...] (David X.

[...] "owever fantastic and ‚Äòunreal‚Äô the experiences of Martha and Lisa might be, their characters are always situated within a set of family relationships that most viewers would recognise as being fairly commonplace." [...] Whereas in The Simpsons, Lisa is the character most identified with knowledge and worldliness, in Doctor Who that character is the Doctor. The power relationship this affords the Doctor and Martha is challenged, in Martha's favour, {{for the first time in}} [...] "42", when an alien possession leaves the Doctor [...] "scared"; according to Agyeman, Martha [...] "has to take control". This independence is continued in [...] "Human Nature"/"The Family of Blood", of which Davies says [...] "Martha is left facing the monsters alone.
