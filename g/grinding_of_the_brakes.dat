40|$|It {{is known}} that <b>the</b> {{operation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> is characterized by <b>the</b> conversion <b>of</b> mechanical energy into heat which results in an increase of temperature on contact's surface of sliding parts.

High thermomechanical loads at braking lead to substantial local plastification and also induce tensile residual stresses in certain areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> disc. This contributes to shortening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fatigue life <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> disc by possible initiation and growth <b>of</b> cracks. In <b>the</b> present paper, a simulation approach for evaluation of brake disc designs with respect to thermomechanical performance is developed and applied. Brake disc performance is analysed using commercial finite element software by employing a constitutive model for grey cast iron implemented in a Fortran subroutine. The thermal loading consists of consecutive severe braking cycles at a constant brake power and a constant speed, with cooling between <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> cycles. Based on a previous experimental study, three different assumptions are made regarding <b>the</b> spatial distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thermal load at braking. A standard commercial brake disc made from grey cast iron having straight vanes is used as the reference case. Geometrical modifications are introduced in the ventilation arrangement using a design-of-experiments approach, studying both straight cooling vanes and different pillar layouts. A preliminary assessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fatigue life <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> discs is carried out.

40|$|Abstract: Analyzing {{thermal load}} of {{friction}} pair <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disc <b>brakes</b> {{was not only}} an indispensable part but also a key theoretical basis for choosing materials of friction pair. In this paper, a brake disc of a mining dump truck with 220 t loads was researched. In accordance with <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> test requirements <b>of</b> ISO 3450 - 1996 standard, the finite element model was built using ANSYS software and then the transient simulation analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> temperature field for <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> disc was conducted. Finally the temperature distribution and its variation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> disc were analyzed in detail based on the simulation results. Huge total weight of a 220 t mining dump truck with full loaded and few numbers of axles and discs lead to <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> disc loading greatly and absorbing a large sum of energy on per unit area. At the same time, because of its 390 t full load and its 1 : 2 load ratio <b>of</b> <b>the</b> front axle to the rear axle, the weight undertaken by the rear axle is much heavier than the front bridge.

After inputting electric power, the TEC chip provides one cooling surface which is stick on <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> system and absorbs the heat from <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> pads or shoes.
