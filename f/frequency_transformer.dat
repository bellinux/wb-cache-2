50|$|In this technique, high {{frequency}} performance {{is achieved by}} using two cores without air gaps. One of the two main cores is {{used to create a}} saturable inductor and the other is used to create a high <b>frequency</b> <b>transformer</b> effect. In another approach, three cores can be used without air gap. Two of the three cores are used to create saturable inductor, and the third core is used to create a high <b>frequency</b> <b>transformer</b> effect. Advantages of saturable inductor sensors include high resolution, high accuracy, low offset and gain drift, and large bandwidth (up to 500 kHz). Drawbacks of saturable inductor technologies include limited bandwidth for simpler design, relatively high secondary power consumption, and risk of current or voltage noise injection into the primary conductor.|$|E

5000|$|A {{resonant}} transformer is {{a transformer}} {{in which one}} or both windings has a capacitor across it and functions as a tuned circuit. Used at radio frequencies, resonant transformers can function as high Q_factor bandpass filters.

50|$|Shortly after Armstrong {{invented the}} superheterodyne, a triode mixer stage design was {{developed}} {{that not only}} mixed the incoming signal with the local oscillator, but the same valve doubled as the oscillator. This {{was known as the}} autodyne mixer. Early examples had difficulty oscillating across the frequency range because the oscillator feedback was via the first intermediate <b>frequency</b> <b>transformer</b> primary tuning capacitor, which was too small to give good feedback.

5000|$|Any {{switched-mode}} {{power supply}} that gets its power from an AC power line (called an [...] "off-line" [...] converter) requires a transformer for galvanic isolation. Some DC-to-DC converters may also include a transformer, although isolation may not be critical in these cases. SMPS transformers run at high frequency. Most of the cost savings (and space savings) in off-line power supplies result from the smaller size of the high <b>frequency</b> <b>transformer</b> compared to the 50/60 Hz transformers formerly used. There are additional design tradeoffs.|$|E
50|$|Electroshock {{weapons and}} tasers have a DC/AC {{inverter}} to generate several {{tens of thousands}} of V AC out of a small 9 V DC battery. First the 9 V DC is converted to 400-2000 V AC with a compact high <b>frequency</b> <b>transformer,</b> which is then rectified and temporarily stored in a high voltage capacitor until a pre-set threshold voltage is reached. When the threshold (set by way of an airgap or TRIAC) is reached, the capacitor dumps its entire load into a pulse transformer which then steps it up to its final output voltage of 20-60 kV. A variant of the principle is also used in electronic flash and bug zappers, though they rely on a capacitor-based voltage multiplier to achieve their high voltage.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{disadvantages}} of 16.7 Hz locomotives {{as compared to}} 50 Hz or 60 Hz locomotives is the heavier transformer required to reduce the overhead line voltage to that used by the motors and their speed control gear. Low <b>frequency</b> <b>transformers</b> need to have heavier magnetic cores and larger windings for {{the same level of}} power conversion. (See effect of frequency on the design of transformers.) The heavier transformers also lead to higher axle loads than for those of a higher frequency. This, in turn, leads to increased track wear and increases the need for more frequent track maintenance. The Czech Railways encountered the problem of the reduced power handling of lower <b>frequency</b> <b>transformers</b> when they rebuilt some 25 kV AC, 50 Hz locomotives (series 340) to operate on 15 kV AC, 16.7 Hz lines. As a result of using the same transformer cores (originally designed for 50 Hz) at the lower <b>frequency,</b> the <b>transformers</b> had to be de-rated to one third of their original power handling capability, thereby reducing the available tractive effort by the same amount (to around 1,000 kW).|$|R

40|$|The {{past decade}} has seen a {{significant}} increase in the number of applications where power electronic converters play a major role. Renewable energy systems such as wind turbines, solar photovoltaics, etc. employ power converters to interface with the utility grid. More and more power converters are being used in transportation sector such as in electric vehicles, locomotives, aircrafts, ships and submarines. Advancements in power converter topologies and devices have constantly pushed the limits and standards applicable in different markets towards better efficiency, lower cost and higher power density. Especially for large power systems such as wind turbine generators, adjustable speed drives, locomotives, etc., achieving smaller footprint at low cost and high efficiency has become a major challenge. These factors generate the major impetus towards the research undertaken in this dissertation. In applications that require integration with the utility grid, the bulkiest components are usually the transformers, inductors and DC electrolytic capacitors. Instead of using a line <b>frequency</b> <b>transformer</b> to interface any power electronic system with the utility grid directly, it is possible to use a power converter to transform the line frequency AC into a higher frequency AC that can be fed to a medium or high <b>frequency</b> <b>transformer.</b> These transformers are much smaller and lighter compared to line frequency transformers. This dissertation elucidates these concepts in detail in the first section as well as at the beginning of each subsequent section, along with a summary of such techniques already proposed in the literature. The sections in this dissertation propose and discuss several architectures (approaches) adhering to the earlier stated concepts that enable higher power density energy conversion for applications such as wind turbines, adjustable speed drives, data centers, energy storage systems, etc. Detailed operational analysis, design example, control strategy, simulation results and experimental results are shown for each concept or topology. The advantages and drawbacks are also discussed. Finally in this dissertation, the medium or high frequency transformers that can be used in the proposed approaches are analyzed in detail using ANSYS Maxwell software in terms of material, saturation, loss and size. Further, these numbers are used to estimate the relative size advantage and efficiency that can be achieved using higher <b>frequency</b> <b>transformer</b> compared to a line <b>frequency</b> <b>transformer</b> for utility interface applications.

40|$|The {{electronic}} power transformer (EPT) raises concerns for its notable size and volume reduction compared with traditional line <b>frequency</b> <b>transformers.</b> Medium <b>frequency</b> <b>transformers</b> (MFTs) are important components in high voltage and high power energy conversion {{systems such as}} EPTs. High voltage and high power make the reliable insulation design of MFT more difficult. In this paper, the influence of wire type and interleaved winding structure on the electric field distribution of MFT is discussed in detail. The electric field distributions for six kinds of typical non-interleaved windings with different wire types are researched using a 2 -D finite element method (FEM). The electric field distributions for one non-interleaved winding and two interleaved windings are also studied using 2 -D FEM. Furthermore, the maximum electric field intensities are obtained and compared. The results show that, in this case study, compared with foil conductor, smaller maximum electric field intensity can be achieved using litz wire in secondary winding.
