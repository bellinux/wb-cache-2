5|$|In {{the realm}} of modern research, the late British {{biochemist}} and historian of Chinese science Joseph Needham (1900–1995) (known as Li Yuese in China) did extensive research and analysis of Su Song's texts and various achievements in his Science and Civilization in China book series. Joseph Needham also related many detailed passages from Su's contemporary medieval Chinese sources {{on the life of}} Su and his achievements known in <b>his</b> <b>day.</b> <b>In</b> 1956, John Christiansen reconstructed a model of Su Song's clocktower in a famous drawing, which garnered attention in the West towards 11th-century Chinese engineering. A miniature model of Su Song's clock was reconstructed by John Cambridge and is now on display at the National Science Museum at South Kensington, London. In China, the clocktower was reconstructed to one-fifth its actual scale by Wang Zhenduo, who worked for the Chinese Historical Museum in Beijing in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|It was the Swedish {{botanist}} Carl Linnaeus {{who finally}} put order into this situation as {{he attempted to}} name all the known organisms of <b>his</b> <b>day.</b> <b>In</b> 1735 his Systema Naturae, which included animals (the tenth edition became {{the starting point for}} zoological nomenclature) was followed by Critica Botanica in 1737, and Philosophia Botanica in 1751. But it was his most comprehensive work on plants, the 1753 publication Species Plantarum that formalised the name of a genus with a single epithet to form the name of a species as two words, the binomial thus making secure the biological system of binomial nomenclature. In these works Linnaeus used a third name as a variety within a species. These varieties included both wild and horticultural variants. The horticultural varieties were still written in Latin and some have persisted to this day.|$|E

5|$|The {{quality of}} fiction in Galaxy had dipped {{towards the end}} of Gold's editorship, and Pohl worked hard to restore the magazine's high standards. Gold's {{difficult}} editorial personality had driven away some of his contributors, but Pohl, who had worked as an agent in the 1950s, was a central figure in the sf community and was able to attract submissions from the star writers of <b>his</b> <b>day.</b> <b>In</b> the case of one of these stars, he offered an unusual arrangement: Robert Silverberg could write whatever he wished and Pohl promised that he would almost invariably buy it. Silverberg, who had been a high-volume producer of competent but unremarkable science fiction, began writing more ambitious work as a result, much of which was published in Galaxy throughout the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|For {{approximately}} five days the armies therefore confronted {{each other across}} the plain of Marathon in stalemate. The flanks of the Athenian camp were protected either by a grove of trees, or an abbatis of stakes (depending on the exact reading). Since every day brought the arrival of the Spartans closer, the delay worked in favor of the Athenians. There were ten Athenian strategoi (generals) at Marathon, elected by each of the ten tribes that the Athenians were divided into; Miltiades was one of these. In addition, in overall charge, was the War-Archon (polemarch), Callimachus, who had been elected by the whole citizen body. Herodotus suggests that command rotated between the strategoi, each taking in turn a day to command the army. He further suggests that each strategos, on <b>his</b> <b>day</b> <b>in</b> command, instead deferred to Miltiades. In Herodotus's account, Miltiades is keen to attack the Persians (despite knowing that the Spartans are coming to aid the Athenians), but strangely, chooses to wait until his actual day of command to attack. This passage is undoubtedly problematic; the Athenians had little to gain by attacking before the Spartans arrived, and there is no real evidence of this rotating generalship. There does, however, seem to have been a delay between the Athenian arrival at Marathon, and the battle; Herodotus, who evidently believed that Miltiades was eager to attack, may have made a mistake whilst seeking to explain this delay.|$|E

25|$|Parker's home in Cache, Oklahoma {{was called}} the Star House. Parker's was the last tribe of the Staked Plains or Llano Estacado {{to come to the}} reservation.

At this time, Quanah embraced much of white culture and adopted the surname Parker. He was well respected by the whites. He went on hunting trips with President Theodore Roosevelt, who often visited him. Nevertheless, he rejected both monogamy and traditional Protestant Christianity in favor of the Native American Church Movement, of which he was a founder.|$|E

[...] Mason was responsible for establishing the highly conservative business culture of the young bank that would persist for nearly 90 years. [...] For its first twenty-five years, the bank paid no dividends, nor did it pay interest on its customers' deposits. [...] Mason was also responsible for leading Chemical through the Panic of 1837. [...] When a speculative bubble collapsed on May 10, 1837, banks suspended payment of gold and silver. [...] Although twenty years later, Chemical would stand alone and continue to make payments in specie, in this crisis the bank followed others in suspending payments. [...] Chemical was one of the earliest to resume payments in specie.|$|E

[...] On June 4, 2015, Kirk announced that he would donate to charity a $10,000 contribution made to Kirk's 2010 Senate campaign by Hastert's Keep our Mission PAC. Kirk's announcement was made following the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC)'s call upon the senator to [...] "return or donate Denny Hastert's money immediately." [...] The DSCC also called upon Republican Senators John Boozman of Arkansas and Roy Blunt of Missouri (who received $11,000 and $5,000, respectively, from Hastert's PAC in recent years) to return or donate the funds.|$|E
