40|$|Kernel Fisher Discriminant Analysis (KFDA) {{allows us}} to carry out Fisher linear {{discriminant}} analysis in a high dimen-sional feature space defined implicitly by a kernel [Mika et al., 1999]. One drawback, as with most kernel methods, is that storing large kernel matrices is computationally prohibitive. Several authors have made attempts at addressing this issue by creating low-rank kernel matrices behaving similarly to the <b>full-ranked</b> ones, such as Smola and Schölkopf [2000] who devise a method moti-vated by a greedy approach called Matching Pursuit (MP) Mallat and Zhang [1993]. We derive a novel sparse version of KDFA us-ing an approach based on MP. We call this algorithm Matching Pursuit Kernel Fisher Discriminant Analysis (MPKFDA). We pro-vide generalisation error bounds based on {{the analysis of the}} Robust Minimax algorithm by Shawe-Taylor and Cristianini [2003] together with a sample compression bounding tech-nique as in Littlestone and Warmuth [1986]. However, the algorithm does not form a tra-ditional compression scheme so we use a sim-ilar idea to that of Hussain and Shawe-Taylor [2008] and bound the generalisation error in the sparsely defined subspace by amalgamat-ing both theories mentioned above. We present experimental results on real world datasets, which show that MPKFDA is com-petitive with the KFDA and the SVM on UCI datasets, and additional experiments that show that the MPKFDA on average outper-forms KFDA and SVM in extremely high di-mensional settings. We believe this general approach of us-ing Matching Pursuit can be applied to other learning algorithms, resulting in sparse greedy forms of these algorithms.

50|$|During the American Civil War, {{almost all}} senior {{officers}} received {{some form of}} brevet award, mainly during the final months of the war.

Thus, brevet awards became increasingly common later in the war. Some officers even received more than one award.
