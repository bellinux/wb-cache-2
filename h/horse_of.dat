40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to analyse the numbers and division <b>of</b> <b>horses</b> <b>of</b> undefined breed. At the present time this group is the most numerous in the entire population <b>of</b> <b>horses.</b> <b>Horses</b> <b>of</b> undefined breed do not come under any breeder union which would provide reports about these horses; these horses are only registered and breeders are informed only about their numbers. Our study is the first to deal with the problem of increasing numbers <b>of</b> <b>horses</b> <b>of</b> undefined breed. The database contained 22   211 horses not entered registered in any of the stud books. In the database we filed approved horses born between 1972 and 1 September 2012 and horses registered from 1987. The data were processed in the Excel programme and results were evaluated in graphs. The most frequent horse in this group was the warm-blood type (n = 9   303), pony type (n = 6   285), cold-blooded type (n = 2   663) and unlisted horses (n = 2   278). Since 2001 the number <b>of</b> registered <b>horses</b> <b>of</b> undefined breed has increased. The most numerous dams <b>of</b> <b>horses</b> <b>of</b> undefined breed is the Czech warm-blood with 1   912 offspring; dams of the English Thoroughbred with 552 offspring and mares of the utility Huzule horse with 492 offspring. In the group <b>of</b> registered <b>horses</b> <b>of</b> undefined breed the Czech warm-blood appears in the pedigree of 507 colts and the American Paint Horse in the pedigree of sires of 506 colts. Why the numbers <b>of</b> <b>horses</b> <b>of</b> undefined breed are increasing is the boom of leisure horsemanship and unqualified horse breeding...|$|R
5|$|In 1929, Brown {{traveled}} to Egypt and Syria with Arabian expert Carl Raswan {{in search of}} desertbred horses. According to Brown's wife, the two apparently did not get along well, and the five horses purchased during their journey somehow {{never made it to}} America. Following that trip, Brown wrote The <b>Horse</b> <b>of</b> the Desert, still considered {{to be one of the}} best works written about the Arabian horse.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, the Nova Scotia Legislature {{declared}} the Sable Island Horse {{as one of}} the provincial symbols, making them the official <b>horse</b> <b>of</b> Nova Scotia. In 2011, the Canadian government created the Sable Island National Park Reserve, which allows further protection of the island and horses. Aside from the island, Sable Island Horses live only at the Shubenacadie Wildlife Park in Shubenacadie, Nova Scotia. It maintains descendants of Sable Island Ponies removed from the island in the 1950s by the Canadian Department of Transport.|$|E
5|$|In the 18thcentury, {{the horse}} {{population}} of Finland vastly diminished in both numbers and quality. At {{the beginning of}} the century, during the Great Northern War campaigns of Charles XII, the Finnish cavalry was larger {{than at any other time}} in history, and almost every usable <b>horse</b> <b>of</b> Finland was needed. Horses were used by the cavalry, infantry, and for transporting supplies. Horses serving in the Swedish military never returned to Finland; even the animals provided to the last remaining Swedish reinforcement regiments were taken to Sweden in 1714, and to Norway in 1718.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{the passion}} {{brought by the}} Blunts to saving the pure <b>horse</b> <b>of</b> the desert helped Egyptian horse breeders to {{convince}} their government {{of the need to}} preserve the best of their own remaining pure Arabian bloodstock that descended from the horses collected over the previous century by Muhammad Ali Pasha, Abbas Pasha and Ali Pasha Sherif. The government of Egypt formed the Royal Agricultural Society (RAS) in 1908, which is known today as the Egyptian Agricultural Organization (EAO).|$|E
5|$|Paynter's next {{race was}} {{scheduled}} to be the Travers Stakes on August 25.

5|$|Periodically, {{populations of}} horses in {{isolated}} areas are speculated to be relict populations of wild horses, but generally {{have been proven}} to be feral or domestic. For example, the Riwoche <b>horse</b> <b>of</b> Tibet was proposed as such, but testing did not reveal genetic differences from domesticated horses. Similarly, the Sorraia of Portugal was proposed as a direct descendant of the Tarpan based on shared characteristics, but genetic {{studies have shown that}} the Sorraia is more closely related to other horse breeds and that the outward similarity is an unreliable measure of relatedness.|$|E
