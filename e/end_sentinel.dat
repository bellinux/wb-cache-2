50|$|On November 29, 2471, {{the race}} for true {{artificial}} intelligence <b>ended</b> when <b>Sentinel</b> Cybertronix activated Project: Prometheus. Prometheus was a prototype, the first cybernetic-hybrid machine, or Cybrid. It was incredibly intelligent, and its success quickly {{paved the way for}} mass-production of Cybrids. These new machines, free of human needs and exceedingly intelligent and efficient, proved invaluable in countless fields, including mining and space exploration.|$|R

2500|$|On August 5, 1910, Princess May, having {{departed}} from Skagway {{under the command}} of Captain MacLeod with 80 passengers, 68 crew, and a shipment of gold, was proceeding south down Lynn Canal in heavy fog. [...] At a speed of about , the ship ran aground on rocks near the north <b>end</b> of <b>Sentinel</b> Island, where there was a United States lighthouse station. [...] It was high tide (the tidal range being about 16 feet at this point) and the momentum of the ship forced it well up onto the rocks, with the bow jutting upward at an angle of 23 degrees. This produced a number of photographs of the ship's predicament which were sold all over the west coast.|$|R
5000|$|Skids and Mudflap were {{originally}} set {{to appear in}} Transformers: Dark of the Moon, but were cut from the final film due to many fans considering them to be racist and due to time restraints. Despite this, he and Mudflap do appear in vehicle form {{at the end of}} two Autobot convoys {{at the beginning of the}} film. They have been upgraded into black Chevrolet Sparks with a stripe of their original color, thus making Skids black and green. As they do not appear in any subsequent Transformers film, it is generally accepted that Skids and Mudflap either met their <b>end</b> from <b>Sentinel</b> Prime or were killed by Cemetery Wind in between Transformers: Dark of the Moon and Transformers: Age of Extinction.|$|R

5000|$|In 1934 Sentinel {{launched}} a new and advanced steamer - the S type which had a single-acting 4-cylinder underfloor engine with longitudinal crankshaft and an overhead worm-drive axle. Their Sentinel Waggon Works' design of 1935 led {{to the production of}} 3,750 Sentinel 'Standards' in the seventeen years that followed, the biggest selling steam lorry ever. It was lighter and featured a modernised driver's cab with a set-back boiler and was available in four, six and eight-wheel form, designated S4, S6 and S8. In spite of its sophisticated design, however, it could not compete with contemporary diesel trucks for all-round convenience and payload capacity, and was phased out in the late 1930s. It was not the <b>end</b> of <b>Sentinel's</b> involvement with steam, however; the company built about 100 [...] "S" [...] type vehicles for export to Argentina as late as 1950, for use by the Río Turbio coal mine. It has been stated that Sentinel were never paid for the last batch of the Río Turbio production run. At least two of the Río Turbio waggons survive in Argentina to this day.|$|R
5000|$|Hudman Glacier (...) is {{a glacier}} {{draining}} south of Mount Landolt between Marze Peak and Miller Peak in Petvar Heights {{at the south}} <b>end</b> of the <b>Sentinel</b> Range, in the Ellsworth Mountains of Antarctica, flowing south-southeast to Minnesota Glacier.

Hudman, United States Marine Corps, {{who died in the}} crash of a Lockheed P2V-2n Neptune, modified for extreme range, flying in sub zero temperatures and Ski equipped for landing on the Ice runways at McMurdo Sound Antarctica on October 18, 1956.|$|R
50|$|The Waltrip {{brothers}} {{adapted the}} novels into comic books, though they diverged from the novels {{as the story}} progressed. The Sentinels comics were published by Eternity Comics, then Academy Comics. The storyline abruptly ended when Academy was unable to renew their license with Harmony Gold. The comics license passed to Antarctic Press, who published The Sentinels: Rubicon, which draws {{its name from the}} title of the fifth Sentinels novel. However, the Rubicon comic, instead of completing the Sentinels story, is set years after the <b>end</b> of the <b>Sentinels</b> Campaign, and was not illustrated by the Waltrips. It was not popular with fans, due to the poor artwork and the lack of connection to The Sentinels. It was cancelled after only two issues.|$|R
5000|$|Thompson again ran {{for office}} in 2004 when she {{challenged}} incumbent State Senator Gary Siplin in the Democratic primary in the 19th District, which included parts of central Orange County and northern Osceola County. During the campaign, she attacked Siplin for his tenure in office, asserting {{that he was}} [...] "ineffective" [...] and focused more on talking about solutions than solving problems, alienating local leaders in the process. The Sentinel agreed with Thompson, asking, [...] "What has Mr. Siplin actually done for his constituents?" [...] and noting, [...] "Even Mr. Siplin is hard-pressed to find an answer." [...] The <b>Sentinel</b> <b>ended</b> up endorsing Thompson, commending her [...] "political savvy and dogged determination to actually get things done." [...] Ultimately, however, she ended up falling short to Siplin, receiving 40% of the vote to his 60%.|$|R
5000|$|In 2014, {{incumbent}} State Representative Bryan Nelson {{was unable}} to seek re-election due to term limits, so Sullivan ran to succeed him. She faced Randy Glisson, Terri Seefeldt, Belita Grassel, and Joseph Stephens in the Republican primary, which was an open primary because no other candidates had filed. Sullivan campaigned on her conservative Christian credentials, and attracted support {{from a number of}} young volunteers from other states who traveled down to Florida to work on her campaign. The Orlando <b>Sentinel</b> <b>ended</b> up endorsing Grassel, blasting Sullivan in an editorial for being [...] "steeped in tea-party dogmatism that has contributed to polarized governance." [...] Ultimately, in a close campaign, Sullivan emerged narrowly victorious, defeating Glisson by a little more than one thousand votes, winning 35% of the vote to Glisson's 29%, Seefeldt's 19%, Grassel's 14%, and Stephens's 3%, making her the youngest female member of the Florida House in its history.|$|R
40|$|I {{studied the}} {{existence}} of sentinels in Saltator atricollis in a 'campo-cerrado' (Brazilian savanna) during the breeding seasons of 1994 - 95 and 1995 - 96. Groups of this species consisted of two to seven birds (N = 25). Sentinels were present (mean ± sd) 62 % ± 9 % of the time, and most sentinel bouts lasted from less than one to six minutes (although in some occasions for more than 30 min.). Overlap {{of two or more}} sentinels occurred on average only 3. 2 % of the time with birds on guard. Sentinels commonly gave contact calls in the beginning and/or at the <b>end</b> of a <b>sentinel</b> bout. The group size had no effect on time with sentinels. However the encounter rate between raptors and groups significantly influenced the time guarded. The results of this study suggests that the ability of sentinels to detect predators may play a central role as an anti-predator device...|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "Five Servos of Doom" [...] he had {{seemingly}} captured Sunstorm, Blitzwing, Lugnut, and Swindle (though {{he admitted}} that since Swindle was trapped in vehicle mode he simply had to pay a fine and have him towed) by himself. Optimus, Jazz, and Prowl were extremely doubtful {{that he could have}} accomplished such feats, and set out to find how he did it. After following Sentinel Prime it was revealed that it was Lockdown who was capturing the Decpticons and trading them to Sentinel for Autobot upgrades. After being betrayed by Lockdown, who was working for Ramjet, <b>Sentinel</b> <b>ended</b> up becoming the Clone's hostage and shield, taking most of the Autobots attacks on himself and ending up face-first in the ground. Optimus covered for Sentinel when reporting to Cybertron, giving credit for the captures to Prowl, but he assured Sentinel that they would [...] "talk it out" [...] when the crisis was over.|$|R
