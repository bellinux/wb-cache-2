500|$|I {{needed to}} {{maintain}} a very strong relationship with Tommy [...] During that period, {{the beginning of their}} end, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> away more than normal from her because she was going through a rough time. She felt that shutting her relationship with Tommy was also a cleansing of who she was. She felt that part of what she was dropping was the shmaltzy pop singer ballad kind of stuff he was adamant about. I had to make my exit and say 'Mariah, you need to redefine yourself, that's fine. I'm here doing what I do and if and when you want to come back and do it again, I'm here.|$|E
2500|$|Martin auditioned so {{well that}} her parents soon allowed her to attend them by herself. Her mother recalled, [...] "I'll never forget the first {{interview}} she went on. It was for a Chrysler commercial, and my car broke down about six blocks from the studio. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> with the car, but Lori was all for going on in herself. She {{got out of the}} car, walked six blocks, found the right office, told the receptionist who she was, went in for her interview and got the job. Since then I've usually waited outside in the car and she's handled everything herself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; {{my father}} has been unwell, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> with him {{a few days or}} I should have been here sooner. You got home all of you quite well?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hush, Mammy," [...] she said. [...] "No, {{you shall}} all go, if <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> myself. Ephum, {{go to the}} livery stable and get another carriage." ...|$|R
5000|$|Labino's {{interest}} in Studio glass {{grew out of}} his frustration with industry, according to Lynn: [...] "As he recalled, 'I had just had it in industry. I would say to myself, 'How many years will <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> here until <b>I</b> can do something that <b>I</b> don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> get approved by twelve to fourteen people?'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here," [...] he cried, {{rising in}} his chair, [...] "if you've {{brought me here}} to trifle with me, you've made a mistake. It's your {{business}} {{to get control of}} things that belong to other people, and sell them out. I am here to buy. Nothing but necessity brings me here, and nothing but necessity will keep me here a moment longer than <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>to</b> finish this abominable affair. I am ready to pay you twenty thousand dollars the day that bill becomes a law." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Stay with me {{till the}} end," [...] she muttered. So <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay,</b> {{wondering}} what Saduko heard Umbelazi whispering to Mameena, and on {{which side of}} me he saw her standing.|$|E
6000|$|... "They did {{not send}} me out this morning," [...] she said, [...] "and so <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay,</b> until I could slip out without being noticed; {{but they may}} miss me at any moment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Honora. [...] "I {{should want}} to go on and see {{everything}} in the world worth seeing. Sometimes I feel positively as though I should die if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> here in St. Louis." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Peter," [...] he gasped, [...] "you don't {{know how}} glad I am {{that it is}} only you. I've had a terrible accident, and I don't know what I am to do. I can't fly, and if <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> on the ground some enemy will be sure to get me. What shall I do, Peter? What shall I do?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Minaj {{said in an}} {{interview}} with Rap-Up, “the Grammys chose ‘Roman Holiday.’ The producers of the Grammys came to the studio and I played them ‘Roman Holiday,’ and I could not play them another record after they heard that. They went crazy. <b>I</b> could <b>have</b> chosen <b>to</b> do a no-brainer pop song, but I can’t do it anymore. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> true <b>to</b> what I’m doing.” ...|$|R
5000|$|I don't {{feel like}} doing anything. I don't feel like riding - the motion is too powerful; I don't feel like walking - it is too tiring; I don't feel like lying down, for either <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> down, and <b>I</b> don't {{feel like doing}} that or <b>I</b> would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> get up again, and I don't feel like doing that, either. Summa Summarum: I don't feel like doing anything. - Either/Or, p. 4 ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd {{like to go}} myself," [...] added Dick, [...] "even if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> ashore all night. Remember, the Josephine {{is on the way}} here, and {{the sooner}} some of us get to land and locate that cave the better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We must catch him," [...] replied Toby, mournfully, {{looking up}} into the tree where his pet sat eating the stolen food with the {{greatest}} possible enjoyment. [...] "I wouldn't go home an' leave him here if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> all night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{forget that}} I was not {{living with the}} other girls," [...] she said. [...] "After meals they used {{to go back to}} the Pavilion, but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in the hotel and do my sewing, or what not, in the room where they talked." ...|$|E
60|$|I answered, truly enough, that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{not thought}} what to do, and he persisted that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> promised <b>to</b> <b>stay.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'O, how glad I am!' {{she cried}} joyfully. 'I was fearing <b>I</b> should <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> here all night. How can I thank you enough?' ...|$|R
5000|$|On 3 April 2007, Addo told BBC Sport that [...] "I {{will not}} extend my {{contract}} with PSV because {{things are not}} improving here for me. The African Cup of Nations is getting close and if <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>I</b> should be guaranteed more playing time to be fit for the tournament in Ghana." [...] He added, [...] "The club understands my situation and they <b>have</b> agreed <b>to</b> allow me to leave {{at the end of}} the season." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They were so infernally polite," [...] he said. [...] "If {{they had}} clubbed me I wouldn't have cared; but it was, 'Step this way, sir,' and, 'Up those stairs, please, sir,' till they jailed me--jailed {{me like a}} common drunk, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in a filthy little cubby-hole of a cell all night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Christian Young {{has never}} had any {{experience}} with large boats. Besides, we can't afford to pay him what he's clearing on the Minerva. Sparrowhawk is a good man--to take orders. He has no initiative. He's an able sailor, but he can't command. I tell you I was nervous {{all the time he}} had charge of the Flibberty at Poonga-Poonga when <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> by the Martha." ...|$|E
60|$|Jim DID cry, and rip {{and dance}} and carry on, {{he was so}} thankful {{and out of his}} mind for joy. It was my watch, so <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> by the works, but Tom and Jim clumb down and drunk a barrel apiece, and fetched me up a lot, and I've tasted a many a good thing in my life, but nothing that ever begun with that water.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, of course," [...] replied Oz. [...] "I {{am tired}} of being such a humbug. If I should go out of this Palace my people would soon {{discover}} I am not a Wizard, {{and then they would}} be vexed with me for having deceived them. So <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> shut up in these rooms all day, and it gets tiresome. I'd much rather go back to Kansas with you and be in a circus again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>I</b> shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> at home to-morrow," [...] said Mr. George, [...] "and {{write letters}} to send to America. It is the last day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{think that}} <b>I</b> shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> {{a few days}} at Mota on my return (D.V.) from Solomon and Santa Cruz Islands, as {{there are still many}} Catechumens.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm afraid you've been lonely. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> rather late. A dull evening." [...] And, {{since she}} did not move or answer, but just sat there very still and white, {{he forced himself to}} go close, bend down to her, touch her cheek; even to kneel beside her. She looked round then; her face was quiet enough, but her eyes were strangely eager. With a pitiful little smile she broke out: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To {{tell you}} the truth, I didn't even pay for the telegram. As <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> late, I took the liberty of sending it through the firm's accounts. You see, I have become quite an {{important}} person in Tooley Street all of a sudden. I'll {{tell you about it}} presently. Now hold on tightly to your stick. I'm much too impatient to go down the steps one by one. I'm going to carry you all the way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{has gone}} to her cousin's funeral, and won't be back till Monday. There {{seems to be a}} great {{fatality}} among her relations; for one dies, or comes to grief in some way, about once a month. But I don't blame poor Sally for wanting to get away from this place now and then. I think I could find it in my heart to murder an imaginary friend or two, if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> here long." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll find it all go as {{naturally}} {{as possible}} when <b>I</b> <b>have</b> ceased <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> and be troublesome. But one thing I must {{say in your}} favor." ...|$|R
50|$|Stewart: That {{was a very}} fitting tribute, Rob. We're gonna {{miss you}} on the show.Corddry: Why thank you, Jon. But {{wherever}} I go and whatever I do, there'll always {{be a part of}} me here.Stewart: Wow...that's a really sweet thing to say.Corddry: No no no, I'm not kidding. It's in the second floor men's room, actually. That's what you get for not giving me a proper send off.Stewart: You're really gonna go out on a poop joke?Corddry: <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> true <b>to</b> myself, Jon.|$|R
6000|$|... "Shall <b>I</b> <b>have</b> mamma <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> with me, then?" [...] said Gwendolen, the new sudden {{possibility}} {{of peace and}} affection filling her mind like a burst of morning light.|$|R
6000|$|Such resting and {{welcoming}} found Brother Samson, with his worn soles, and strong heart! He sits silent, revolving many thoughts, {{at the foot}} of St. Edmund's Shrine. In the wide Earth, if it be not Saint Edmund, what friend or refuge has he? Our Lord Abbot, hearing of him, sent the proper officer to lead him down to prison, and clap 'foot-gyves on him' there. Another poor official furtively brought him a cup of wine; bade him [...] "be comforted in the Lord." [...] Samson utters no complaint; obeys in silence. 'Our Lord Abbot, taking counsel of it, banished me to Acre, and there <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> long.' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{lost some}} time, now, for these big children, their fears gone, became so ravished with wonder over my awe-compelling {{fireworks}} that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> there and smoke {{a couple of}} pipes out before they would let me go. Still the delay was not wholly unproductive, for it took all that time to get Sandy thoroughly wonted to the new thing, she being so close to it, you know. It plugged up her conversation mill, too, for a considerable while, {{and that was a}} gain. But above all other benefits accruing, I had learned something. I was ready for any giant or any ogre that might come along, now.|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{she looked}} forward to meeting George out here! But he {{disappointed}} her right at the start. She hates a drinking man. I think she came to hate George, too. But he always reminded her of Arthur, and she could never get over that. So, naturally, when you killed George she was terribly shocked. There were nights when she was haunted, when <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> with her. Vaughn and I have studied her, talked about her, and we think she's gradually recovering. She loved you, too; and Sally doesn't change. Once with her is for always. So let me say to you what you said to me--do not brood. All will yet be well, thank God!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I suppose <b>I</b> shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> here," [...] she said, [...] "and I can't {{stay here}} without playing. I {{will take a}} {{thousand}} more, if you will lend it to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you'll pay my {{traveling}} {{expenses and}} hotel bills, I'll {{go on for}} one night, and, perhaps a week, {{but when it comes}} to leaving this section of the country <b>I</b> shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> behind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I," [...] he said, [...] "am {{returning}} from {{my first visit}} <b>to</b> the States. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> with a cousin who has a ranch out West. We had ever such a good time." ...|$|R
