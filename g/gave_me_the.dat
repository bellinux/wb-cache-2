This thought <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> strength to succeed in this fight. It <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> courage and the endurance to win this victory for Germany's colors.|$|E
25|$|This {{book was}} {{conceived}} in March {{of the year}} 1929 , {{during the course of}} a stay in Damascus. The miserable sight of maimed and famished-looking refugee children, working in a carpet factory, <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> final impulse to snatch the incomprehensible destiny of the Armenian people from the Hell of all that had taken place. The writing of the book followed between July 1932 and March 1933. Meanwhile, in November, on a lecture tour through German cities, the author selected Chapter 5 of Book One for public readings. It was read in its present form, based on the historic records of a conversation between Enver Pasha and Pastor Johannes Lepsius.|$|E
25|$|Shilts's {{writing was}} admired for its {{powerful}} narrative drive, interweaving personal stories with {{political and social}} reporting. Shilts saw himself as a literary journalist {{in the tradition of}} Truman Capote and Norman Mailer. Undaunted by a lack of enthusiasm for his initial proposal for the Harvey Milk biography, Shilts reworked the concept, as he later said, after further reflection: I read Hawaii by James Michener. That <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> concept for the book, the idea of taking people and using them as vehicles, symbols for different ideas. I would take the life-and-times approach and tell the whole story of the gay movement in this way, using Harvey as the major vehicle.|$|E

25|$|I {{have not}} seen Chas. Greville's book, but have read {{a good deal of}} it. It is a social outrage. And {{committed}} by one who was always talking of what he called ‘perfect gentlemen.’ I don't think he can figure now in that category. I knew him intimately. He was the vainest being—I don't limit myself to man—that ever existed; and I don't forget Cicero and Lytton Bulwer; but Greville wd. swallow garbage, and required it. Offended selflove is a key to most of his observations. He lent me a volume of his MS. once to read; more modern than these; I found, when he was not scandalous, he was prolix and prosy—a clumsy, wordy writer. The loan was made à propos of the character of Peel, which I drew in George Bentinck's Life, and which, I will presume to say, is the only thing written about Peel wh. has any truth or stuff in it. Greville was not displeased with it, and as a reward, and a treat, told me that he wd. confide to me his character of Peel, and he <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> sacred volume, wh. I bore with me, with trembling awe, from Bruton St. to Grosr Gate. If ever it appears, you, who have taste for style and expression, will, I am sure, agree with me that, as a portrait painter, Greville is not a literary Vandyke or Reynolds; a more verbose, indefinite, unwieldy affair, without a happy expression, never issued from the pen of a fagged subordinate of the daily press.|$|E

500|$|I went to New York to meet (Madonna), begrudgingly, {{and showed}} up at an address at SoHo, {{which turned out to}} be a squat basically. Madonna was scantily clad, working out to a massive disco track. She was charismatic. She kept putting her head down on the table and talking to me, very flirtatious, and that <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> idea for the scene in [...] "burning up", where her face is on the road, and the camera's really low and close.|$|E

500|$|Novelist {{and sports}} writer Budd Schulberg, {{assigned}} by the U.S. Navy to the OSS for intelligence work while attached to John Ford's documentary unit, was ordered to arrest Riefenstahl at her chalet in Kitzbühel, ostensibly to have her identify Nazi war criminals in German film footage captured by the Allied troops shortly after the war. Riefenstahl claimed she {{was not aware of}} the nature of the internment camps. According to Schulberg, [...] "She <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> usual song and dance. She said, 'Of course, you know, I'm really so misunderstood. I'm not political'".|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé, who {{has covered}} [...] "At Last" [...] {{which is a}} song {{originally}} recorded by James, portrayed the artist in the 2008 musical biopic, Cadillac Records and won critical acclaim for her portrayal.

It <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> confidence and the push to challenge myself a little more with my music."

500|$|Ultimately, Nile Rodgers {{was chosen}} by Madonna as the {{producer}} of the album, {{with the approval of}} the Warner Brothers executives. Madonna chose Rodgers mostly because of his work {{as a member of the}} seventies band Chic, and his most recent production work with David Bowie on his 1983 album Let's Dance. She commented, [...] "When I was making the record, I was just so thrilled and happy to be working with Nile Rodgers. I idolized Nile because of the whole Chic thing. I couldn't believe that the record company <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> money so that I could work with him." ...|$|E

Their performance of Danny & the Juniors' [...] "Rock and Roll Is Here to Stay" [...] at {{their high school}} talent show was so loud that the principal cut the microphone. On January 31, 1959, three days before his death, Buddy Holly performed at the Duluth Armory. Seventeen year old Zimmerman was in the audience; in his Nobel Prize lecture, Dylan remembered: [...] "He looked me right straight dead in the eye, and he transmitted something.

[...] Giovanny Caquias of Culture Blues wrote that the song feels like the first [...] "candid" [...] and [...] "insightful" [...] track on Unapologetic. He continued, [...] "Rihanna gets a little introspective on What Now, and doesn’t resort to being overtly sexual or defiantly callous (more on that later), which <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> feeling that she stripped away her armor {{for a moment and}} actually allowed herself to be 'real'."

500|$|After Bennett's {{first visit}} to Germany there {{followed}} three extended visits to work in Leipzig. He was there from October 1836 to June 1837, during which time he made his debut at the Gewandhaus as the soloist in his Third Piano Concerto with Mendelssohn conducting. He later conducted his Naiads overture. During this visit he also arranged the first cricket match ever played in Germany, ("as fitting a Yorkshireman" [...] as the musicologist Percy M. Young comments). At this time Bennett wrote to Davison: took me to his house and <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> printed score of [...] 'Melusina', and afterwards we supped at the 'Hôtel de Bavière', where all the musical clique feed...
