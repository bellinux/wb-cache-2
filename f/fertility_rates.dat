By 2100 the UN estimates that the Nigerian population will be between 505 million and 1.03 billion people (middle estimate: 730 million). In 1950, Nigeria had only 33 million people.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese Indonesian {{population}} of Sumatra accounts {{for nearly half}} of the group's national population. Although they are generally more urbanized than Indonesia's indigenous population, significant rural and agricultural communities exist throughout the country. Declining <b>fertility</b> <b>rates</b> have resulted in an upward shift in the population pyramid, as the median age increases. Emigration has contributed to a shrinking population, and communities have emerged in more industrialized nations {{in the second half of}} the 20th century. Some have participated in repatriation programs to the People's Republic of China, while others emigrated to Western countries to escape anti-Chinese sentiment. Among the overseas residents, their identities are noticeably more Indonesian than Chinese.|$|E

5|$|The ethnic Chinese {{population}} in Indonesia grew {{by an average}} of 4.3 percent annually between 1920 and 1930. It then slowed owing to the effects of the Great Depression and many areas experienced a net emigration. Falling growth rates were also attributed to a significant {{decrease in the number of}} Chinese immigrants admitted into Indonesia since the 1950s. The population is relatively old according to the 2000 census, having the lowest percentage of population under 14 years old nationwide and the second-highest percentage of population over 65. Their population pyramid had a narrow base with a rapid increase until the 15–19 age group, indicating a rapid decline in total <b>fertility</b> <b>rates.</b> This was evidenced by a decline in the absolute number of births since 1980. In Jakarta and West Java the population peak occurred in the 20–24 age group, indicating that the decline in <b>fertility</b> <b>rates</b> began as early as 1975. The upper portion of the pyramid exhibited a smooth decline with increasing population age. It is estimated that 60.7 percent of the Chinese Indonesian {{population in}} 2000 constitute the generation which experienced political and social pressures under the New Order government. With an average life expectancy of 75 years, those who spent their formative years prior to this regime will completely disappear by 2032.|$|E
5|$|Elephants are {{polygynous}} breeders, and copulations {{are most}} frequent {{during the peak}} of the wet season. A cow in oestrus releases chemical signals (pheromones) in her urine and vaginal secretions to signal her readiness to mate. A bull will follow a potential mate and assess her condition with the flehmen response, which requires the male to collect a chemical sample with his trunk and bring it to the vomeronasal organ. The oestrous cycle of a cow lasts 14–16 weeks with a 4–6-week follicular phase and an 8- to 10-week luteal phase. While most mammals have one surge of luteinizing hormone during the follicular phase, elephants have two. The first (or anovulatory) surge, could signal to males that the female is in oestrus by changing her scent, but ovulation does not occur until the second (or ovulatory) surge. <b>Fertility</b> <b>rates</b> in cows decline around 45–50 years of age.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the significant lack of genetic diversity in cheetahs is a cause of poor quality and production of sperm, and birth defects such as cramped teeth, kinked tails, and bent limbs. Cheetahs do have low <b>fertility</b> <b>rates,</b> but they appear to have flourished for thousands of years with these low levels of genetic variance. Cheetah expert Laurie Marker points out that the high level of genetic uniformity would mean that if an infectious disease surfaced in a population, all of them have (or lack) the same level of immunity. In 1982, 60% of the cheetah population in the Wildlife Safari (Oregon, United States) died due to a peritonitis epidemic.|$|E

40|$|Fertility {{development}} in the USA Abstract The aim of this theses is to analyse {{the development of a}} <b>fertility</b> <b>rate</b> in the USA. As a tool for this analysis I am using the following indicators: total <b>fertility</b> <b>rate,</b> age specific <b>fertility</b> <b>rate</b> and mean age at birth. The population of United States of America is very heterogeneous therefore it is important to take the racial and ethnic differentiation into account when analysing fertility. Every racial/ethnic group is unique and has its own demographic behaviour. Because the <b>fertility</b> <b>rate</b> also varies in different states, this work has one part on regional differences in <b>fertility</b> <b>rate.</b> This theses also includes a chapter on demographic theories, such as the first and second demographic transition and the lowest-low fertility. Theories describe and explain changes in reproductive behaviour of the population. Keywords: Age specific <b>fertility</b> <b>rate,</b> total <b>fertility</b> <b>rate,</b> mean age at birt...|$|R
