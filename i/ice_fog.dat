25|$|Frozen fog (also {{known as}} <b>ice</b> <b>fog)</b> is {{any kind of}} fog where the {{droplets}} have frozen into extremely tiny crystals of ice in midair. Generally this requires temperatures at or below , making it common only in and near the Arctic and Antarctic regions. It is most often seen in urban areas where it is created by the freezing of water vapor present in automobile exhaust and combustion products from heating and power generation. Urban <b>ice</b> <b>fog</b> can become extremely dense and will persist day and night until the temperature rises. Extremely small amounts of <b>ice</b> <b>fog</b> falling from the sky form a type of precipitation called ice crystals, often reported in Barrow, Alaska. <b>Ice</b> <b>fog</b> often leads to the visual phenomenon of light pillars.|$|E

5000|$|White Island was {{typically}} inaccessible to sealers and whalers since it usually {{was surrounded by}} a wide belt of thick polar pack ice. It also was often hidden from view by thick <b>ice</b> <b>fogs.</b> It was known, however, to be prime hunting ground for walrus. It had been an exceptionally warm year in 1930 and the sea was virtually free of <b>ice.</b> The <b>fog</b> was light that afternoon, so some of the men decided to approach White Island to hunt walrus and to do a little scientific exploring. The sealers went ashore and began the hunt for walrus. During the stay two of the hunters, Olav Salen and Karl Tusvik, discovered a bit of metal sticking out of the snow. When they approached they saw {{it was part of a}} boat sticking out of the ground. In the boat was a lot of equipment frozen in ice, including a boatswain's hook with the words [...] "Andrée's Polar Expedition, 1896" [...] engraved upon the visible portion.

40|$|Simulating {{freezing}} and frozen precipitation in an indoor laboratory setting can permit year round evaluation of de/anti-icing systems and fluids. At AMIL, freezing rain, freezing drizzle, <b>icing</b> <b>fog</b> and in-cloud <b>icing</b> {{as well as}} frost, snow, ice pellets and icing clouds can be simulated {{in a variety of}} cold chambers of different heights and with different wind conditions using specialized spraying systems and temperature set-ups. Freezing rain is simulated using a 9 m high vertical chamber capable of supercooling water droplets from 100 to 1000 μm, so they freeze not long after impact. The freezing drizzle is simulated in a 4 m high chamber where supercooled droplets from 50 to 250 μm freeze on impact. <b>Icing</b> <b>fog</b> and in-cloud <b>icing</b> are simulated {{with the help of a}} pneumatic spray nozzle system which allows for a finer water spray, in the 20 μm diameter range. The frost is simulated by saturating a cold room with humidity generated from a heated, temperature controlled water bath. Snow is simulated with a fine pneumatic water spray which forms a soft rime simulating the effect of natural snow. Ice pellets are made in the 9 m high vertical cold chamber using strong turbulent wind that increases the air residency and convective air cooling of water droplets so they freeze before impact. Finally, icing wind tunnels allow for the simulation of an object iced through a passing supercooled cloud. For all simulations, humidity can be controlled by using a heated water bath to increase it, or by using an independent refrigeration unit or molecular sieves to decrease it.

40|$|When cirriform clouds or <b>ice</b> <b>fogs</b> {{lie down}} between the {{observer}} {{and the sun}} (or moon), refraction and reflection effects of light rays by small ice crystals (diamond dust) can lead {{to one or more}} "halo" phenomena (R. GREENLER : Rainbows, Halos and Glories. Cambridge, Cambridge Univ. Press, 1980). For example, the most common-the 22 °-halo, which occurs when the cloud form is a veil of cirrostratus and when the predominant ice crystal form is that of hexagonal prism of uniform size, is explained form the fact that the angle of deviation (i. e. the angle of minimum bending from a straight line by refraction) is 22 °for a triangle with apex angle of 60 °. However, it has not as yet been satisfactory explained how the appearance of halo phenomena and the halo intensity depend on the basic properties of ice crystals such as morphology, spatial concentration, size distribution, and falling orientation (J. HALLETT : J. Opt. Soc. Am., A 4, 581, 1987). The {{purpose of this study is}} to observe the hal phenomena in <b>ice</b> <b>fogs</b> made artificially in the laboratory and to clarify their formation mechanisms in connection with aspects of both crystal growth and meteorology. An experiment was carried out for the 22 °halo. As a result, we showed that the artificial formation of halo with enough intensity was possible and the effects of the variety of crystal forms and crystal size for halo formation were extremely severe. On the basis of these experimental results and theoretical consideration, we discuss the formation mechanism of the "halo". Finally, we mention important applications of halo study such as remote sensing of cloud particles from the ground or a satellite...|$|R

The model is applied to the diurnal variation of water vapor in the atmosphere as observed by Barker (1974). The morning rise in the amount of water vapor can be explained in terms of the evaporation of ground fogs. The evening decrease is compatible with the model if adsorption dominates in the soil. The average level of vapor concentration requires that the atmosphere above the boundary layer be relatively dry. The ground fogs persist until midmorning and should be observable.
