30|$|Due to {{the effect}} of the duct, the {{slipstream}} pattern and aerodynamic characteristic of <b>ducted</b> <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> are different from the conventional open-type rotor. It can reduce the risk of component damage and enhance the operational safety. In addition, both the duct and rotor of the <b>ducted</b> <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> can produce thrust. Thrust which is produced by the duct is due to negative pressure on the duct inlet, which contributes a maximum of 50  % to the total. Furthermore, the noise of <b>ducted</b> <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> is lower than the conventional open-type rotor (Keys et al. 1991; Desjardins et al. 1991). Consequently, the analysis of the aerodynamic noise of the <b>ducted</b> <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> is the main topic for this paper.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} predict the {{aerodynamic}} noise, aerodynamic characteristics of the <b>ducted</b> <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> should be obtained first. Along {{with the development of}} the <b>ducted</b> <b>tail</b> <b>rotor,</b> many researchers have studied the aerodynamic characteristics of various types of ducted tail rotors (Rajagopalan and Keys 1997; Bandoh et al. 1998; Vuillet and Morelli 1986). In recent years, the main method which investigates the aerodynamic performance of <b>ducted</b> <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> is CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamic) method. Among those CFD methods, momentum source method is one of the commonly used methods. The momentum source with functional relationship to the local flow conditions represents the spanning rotor in flow field and are added to the N-S equations by UDF procedure. Cao and Yu (2005) used it to solve the numerical simulation of turbulent flow around <b>ducted</b> <b>tail</b> <b>rotor.</b> The method not only can predict the flow field but also investigate the performance of the ducted tail rotors. Song et al. (2009) applied it to analyze the aerodynamic characteristics of <b>ducted</b> <b>tail</b> <b>rotor.</b> To obtain the aerodynamic characteristics of the <b>ducted</b> <b>tail</b> <b>rotor,</b> the author solved the N-S equation added by the source. The numerical solutions were verified by the experimental data, and some aerodynamic characteristics of the <b>ducted</b> <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> were also discussed. Even though momentum source method is quite successful for the prediction of the aerodynamic performance of <b>ducted</b> <b>tail</b> <b>rotor,</b> detailed three dimensional flow features cannot be accurately predicted. Because of the approximation of the blade shape parameters, the accuracy of the momentum source method is still limited. In addition, it is difficult to obtain the accurate noise source information by using the momentum source method. In this work, a CFD method which is considered the blade shape parameters has been proposed to investigate the aerodynamic characteristics of <b>ducted</b> <b>tail</b> <b>rotor,</b> and the method is based on moving reference frame (MRF) model instead of momentum source method.|$|E
30|$|Secondly, we (Song et al. 2016) {{studied the}} theory and method {{described}} by Ghorbaniasl et al. (2013) and found they are very suitable for reducing the scattering effect of noise. In the aviation field, the prediction problem of acoustic noise of the <b>ducted</b> <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> is very important and difficult to solve; therefore, we tried to use their method to solve the problem. According to our simulation, the perfect results of the acoustic noise of the <b>ducted</b> <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> are acquired. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first attempt to predict the acoustic noise of the <b>ducted</b> <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> using {{the theory and}} the method proposed by Ghorbaniasl et al. (2013).|$|E

40|$|Variable <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> {{speed is}} {{investigated}} {{as a method}} for reducing <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> power, and improving helicopter performance. A helicopter model able to predict the main <b>rotor</b> and <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> powers is presented, and the flight test data of the UH- 60 A helicopter is used for validation. The predictions of the main and <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> powers are generally in good agreement with flight tests, which justifies {{the use of the}} present method in analyzing main and <b>tail</b> <b>rotors.</b> Reducing the main rotor speed can result in lower main rotor power at certain flight conditions. However, it increases the main rotor torque and the corresponding required <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> thrust to trim, which then decreases the yaw control margin of the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor.</b> In hover, the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> {{may not be able to}} provide enough thrust to counter the main rotor torque, if it is slowed to follow the main rotor speed. The main rotor speed corresponding to the minimum main rotor power increases, if the change of <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> power in hover is considered. As a helicopter translated to cruise, the induced power decreases, and the profile power increases, with the profile power dominating the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor.</b> Reducing the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> speed in cruise reduces the profile power to give a 37 % reduction in total <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> power and a 1. 4 % reduction to total helicopter power. In high speed flight, varying the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> speed is ineffective for power reduction. The power reduction obtained by the variable <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> speed is reduced for increased helicopter weight...|$|R

The calculated SPLs accord well with the results obtained by VLA, and show that our method effectively predict the far-field SPLs of the <b>ducted</b> <b>tail</b> <b>rotor.</b> Numerical examples show that the duct can change the value of SPLs and the sound directivity both the pulsating sphere and tail rotor. Furthermore, there are some contributed works including the scattering effect of high speed impulsive noise and the experimental verification for the numerical method of noise prediction.|$|E
30|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to propose the FW-H/thin-body BEM method for {{predicting}} the aerodynamic noise of the <b>ducted</b> <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> in hover numerically. Based on the CFD method, aerodynamic characteristic of the TsAGI <b>ducted</b> <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> are discussed, {{and the results are}} compared with vortex theory and momentum source method for validation. The numerical method is convergent by increasing the number of the grid. The thrust of the duct is generated by duct lip.|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} aerodynamic {{performance of}} a <b>ducted</b> <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> in hover has been numerically studied using CFD technique. The general governing equations of turbulent flow around <b>ducted</b> <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> are given and directly solved by using finite volume discretization and Runge-Kutta time integration. The calculations of the lift characteristics of the <b>ducted</b> <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> can be obtained. In order to predict the aerodynamic noise, a hybrid method combining computational aeroacoustic with boundary element method (BEM) has been proposed. The computational steps include the following: firstly, the unsteady flow around rotor is calculated using the CFD method to get the noise source information; secondly, the radiate sound pressure is calculated using the acoustic analogy Curle equation in the frequency domain; lastly, the scattering effect of the duct wall on the propagation of the sound wave is presented using an acoustic thin-body BEM.

50|$|The <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> {{drive system}} {{consists}} of a shaft powered from the main transmission and a gearbox mounted {{at the end of}} the tail boom. The drive shaft may consist of one long shaft or a series of shorter shafts connected at both ends with flexible couplings, that allow the drive shaft to flex with the tail boom. The gearbox {{at the end of the}} tailboom provides an angled drive for the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> and may also include gearing to adjust the output to the optimum rotational speed for the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor,</b> measured in rotations per minute (RPM). On larger helicopters with a tail pylon, intermediate gearboxes are used to transition the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> drive shaft from along the tailboom to the top of the pylon. The <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> pylon may also serve as a vertical stabilizing airfoil, to alleviate the power requirement for the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> in forward flight. The <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> pylon may also serve to provide limited antitorque within certain airspeed ranges, in the event that the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> or the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> flight controls fail.

3000|$|In this paper, the {{aerodynamic}} {{characteristic of}} a <b>ducted</b> <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> in hover has been numerically studied using CFD method. An analytical time domain formulation based on Ffowcs Williams–Hawkings (FW–H) equation is derived for the prediction of the acoustic velocity field and used as Neumann boundary condition on a rigid scattering surface. In order to predict the aerodynamic noise, a hybrid method combing computational aeroacoustics with an acoustic thin-body boundary element method has been proposed. The aerodynamic results and the calculated sound pressure levels (SPLs) are compared with the known method for validation. Simulation {{results show that the}} duct can change the value of SPLs and the sound directivity.

This method can predict the far-field aerodynamic noise of the <b>ducted</b> <b>tail</b> <b>rotor.</b>|$|E
50|$|Recent {{technology}} in emergency <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> recovery systems has been advanced by the US Army in an SBIR research award to EATTS. The emergency anti-torque thruster system (EATTS) {{would allow a}} helicopter that has encountered <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> failure, or loss of <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> effectiveness, to land safely.

40|$|Preliminary {{results from}} an ongoing effort {{to model the}} {{interaction}} aerodynamics and aeroacoustics of main- and <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> of a helicopter in subsonic flow are presented. The configurations studied are a) a two-blade main- and <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> in hover, and b) a four-blade main- and a two-blade <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> in climb flight. The numerical approach consists of computing the unsteady pressure on the main- and <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> blade surface with a 3 -D unsteady free wake panel method and using this as input to a Ffowcs Williams Hawkings equation based aeroacoustic code to evaluate the noise characteristics. Parameters varied for the hover configuration are the lateral spacing between the main- and <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> axis {{and the sense of}} <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> rotation.

40|$|Aviation {{industry}} has a crucial impact on society {{on the grounds}} that it offers wider social and economic benefits. The demand of transportation is increasing and it is expected that the worldwide fleet of aircraft and rotorcraft will increase accordingly. This growth will introduce an increased environmental impact which can be controlled with the introduction and the implementation of new and greener technologies which can provide both a reduced carbon foot-print and increased efficiency. Therefore, the simulation of new designs with tools that can capture the flow physics accurately is crucial, {{on the grounds that}} an accurate simulation could provide novel designs and new ways in order to design from scratch new vehicles as well as providing a better appreciation of the physics that are involved. This work has a central aim to propose a methodology which combines CFD simulations and the method of performance mapping. It focuses on the application of a <b>ducted</b> <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> which can offer significant performance benefits compared to a conventional tail rotor. The developed methodology was tested against the results of an in-house rotorcraft comprehensive code and provided a reasonable qualitative correlation. In principle, this methodology can work for all helicopter flight phases such as hover, climb, cruise, descend but due to the complexity of the investigations, together with the lack of experimental data that can be used to refine the CFD model, only the hover and forward flight were considered. Although CFD studies of a <b>ducted</b> <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> currently exist in the literature (though scarce), this work can be considered, to the best knowledge of the author as a first attempt in investigating the performance of the configuration, from low to high forward flight speed, by combining CFD and performance mapping...|$|E
30|$|Although the {{aerodynamic}} {{characteristics of}} <b>ducted</b> <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> {{have been discussed}} by many researchers (Cao et al. 2005; Yu and Cao 2006), {{the investigation of the}} aerodynamic noise is relatively few. The prediction of rotating blade aerodynamic noise can be acquired easily by solving FW-H equation, but the scattering effect of the duct wall on the propagation of the sound wave is difficult to discuss and the scattering mechanism is rather complex. The acoustic boundary element method (BEM) is usually applied to predict the sound radiating and scattering filed in the exterior and interior closed domain (Ih and Lee 1997; Wu 2000). Wu and Wan (1992) proposed a thin-body BEM, in which an imaginary interface is constructed to divide the domain into interior and exterior subdomains, and the imaginary surface is not discretized in the numerical implementation. The author indicated the scattering mechanism of the thin body boundary, and proposed the Helmholtz boundary integral equation to analyze the scattering effect.|$|E
40|$|The <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> of a {{helicopter}} with a single main rotor configuration can experience {{a significant reduction in}} thrust when the aircraft operates in crosswind flight. Brown’s vorticity transport model has been used to simulate a main <b>rotor</b> and <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> system translating at a sideslip angle that causes the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> to interact with the main rotor tip vortices as they propagate downstream at the lateral extremities of the wake. The <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> is shown to exhibit a distinct directionally dependent mode during which <b>tail</b> <b>rotors</b> that are configured so that the blades travel forward {{at the top of the}} disk develop less thrust than <b>tail</b> <b>rotors</b> with the reverse sense of rotation. The range of flight speeds over which this mode exists is shown to vary considerably with the vertical location of the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor.</b> At low flight speeds, the directionally dependent mode occurs because the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> is immersed within not only the downwash from the main rotor but also the rotational flow associated with clusters of largely disorganized vorticity within the main rotor wake. At higher flight speeds, however, the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> is immersed within a coherent supervortex that strongly influences the velocity field surrounding the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} made of {{helicopter}} <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> noise, particularly that due to interactions with the main rotor tip vortices, and with the fuselage separation mean wake. The <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> blade-main rotor tip vortex interaction is modelled as an airfoil of infinite span cutting through a moving vortex.

These acoustic results are compared to <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> loading and thickness noise, and {{are found to be}} significant to the overall <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> noise generation. Under most helicopter operating conditions, large acoustic pressure fluctuations can be generated due to a series of skewed main rotor tip vortices passing through the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> disk.

To optimize its function for forward flight, the blades of a <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> have no twist to reduce the profile drag, because the <b>tail</b> <b>rotor</b> is mounted with its axis of rotation perpendicular to the direction of flight.|$|R
