40|$|This paper {{attempts}} to identify factors which influence {{the effectiveness of}} milk production. The basic aim is to compare levels of costs in the dairy industry between Czech and European producers.

The total costs per 1 litre of Czech milk producers are on the European average level with high production efficiency.

40|$|It is a {{well known}} fact that milk varies greatly in quality. Some of it will make butter of the highest quality, some again, owing to {{injurious}} organisms, will not make prime butter. The injurious fermentations are much worse at times than at others. Milk as it is received at the creamery, is often “off” in odor. It is, therefore, desirable to know what patron is responsible for this tainted milk. It was supposed by patrons that these odors had their origin in weeds, etc. Some years ago Mr. Monrad gave, {{at one of the}} meetings of the Iowa State <b>Dairy</b> <b>Association,</b> a simple test for detecting these odors which is largely used in <b>European</b> <b>dairies.</b> Samples of milk from different patrons are placed in glass tubes and then allowed to stand for a day or less, in a warm place to allow the bacteria to develop. The odors and gaseous fermentations may easily be detected...|$|R

40|$|The <b>European</b> <b>dairy</b> {{industry}} {{is facing a}} number of challenges related to policy changes and global trends that add pressure on their economic performance. This study uses logistic regression to analyze differences in financial and performance indicators between <b>European</b> <b>dairy</b> cooperatives and investor-owned firms. The investigated indicators are profitability, debt, operational efficiency, equity growth, size, and country dummies. The empirical application uses data from 170 <b>European</b> <b>dairy</b> firms. Cooperatives are on average less profitable, operate more efficiently, and have a stronger financial position than investor‐owned firms. Using the above‐mentioned financial and performance indicators, cooperatives appear to be well equipped {{to cope with the}} challenges ahead. [EconLit citations: Q 13; M 12; C 25].
