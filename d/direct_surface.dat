Therefore, most of the research on NTD AR antagonists focuses on peptides that may directly block the AF2 in AR LBD from protein surface. Even in bound mutant AR, NTD antagonists would be able to block the AF2 function via <b>direct</b> <b>surface</b> interaction, regardless of the ligand bound.|$|E

In this paper a method based on level set method is proposed to extract the <b>directed</b> <b>surface</b> from CT images. The process is composed of two steps. In the first step, Level Set method with a new speed function is employed to evolve zero level set to its destination and used to cut the desired bone part from the input CT images. In the second step, a simple method is used to extract the <b>directed</b> <b>surface,</b> usually the outward surface, from the separated bone part by removing the interior surface.
