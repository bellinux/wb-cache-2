40|$|The {{world today}} {{has come to}} an era where {{information}} and technology are considered significant in taking decicions. With the reason of international use, the language used to convey the information and technology is English. Here, translation plays an important role as a means of conveying those information and technology in a native language. However, doing and producing a qualified translation are not easy at all. One of the mistakes translators often make is when they encounter an SL idiom. Usually, they fail to recognize that an expression is idiom and directly translate it using the one-to-one strategy. Using the book of Chicken Soup <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kid's</b> Soul as a source of data, this study then is conducted to find out what strategies translator should use to translate SL idioms. More specifically, this study is to answer the questions: (a) Are the English in Chicken Soup <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kid's</b> Soul translated into Indonesian idioms? (b) What are the translation strategies used in translating the English idioms in Chicken Soup <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kid's</b> Soul? (c) What are the Indonesian equivalents of the English idioms that are not translated into Indonesian idioms in Chicken Soup <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kid's</b> Soul? And (d) What are the translation strategies used in translating the English idioms that are not translated into Indonesian idioms in Chicken Soup <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kid's</b> Soul? Some theories used to serve as the basis of this study are the characteristics of both English and Indonesian idioms, the translation concepts, and the idiom translating strategies. The study uses the content analysis method to analyze and interpret the data. The findings of the study shows that the English idioms in <b>the</b> Chicken Soup <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kid's</b> Soul are translated with various idiom translating strategies, such as TL-idiom substitution, functional equivalent, descriptive equivalent, translation by omission. The findings also show that when the meaning of the SL and the TL idioms correspond to the same thing and association, SL idioms can also be tr 1 mslated literally. And as the last alternative when all of the above idiom-translating strategies are impossible to use, translators can take or quote directly the original idiom in the SL and then print it in italics...|$|R
500|$|Peter Travers of Rolling Stone {{called it}} a {{restoration}} of [...] "originality and daring to the Halloween genre. This dazzling mix of fun and fright also explodes the notion that animation is kid stuff. ... It's 74 minutes of timeless movie magic." [...] James Berardinelli stated [...] "The Nightmare Before Christmas has something to offer just about everyone. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids,</b> it's a fantasy celebrating two holidays. For the adults, it's an opportunity to experience some light entertainment while marveling at how adept Hollywood has become at these techniques. There are songs, laughs, and a little romance. In short, The Nightmare Before Christmas does what it intends to: entertain." [...] Desson Thomson of The Washington Post enjoyed stylistic features in common with Oscar Wilde, German Expressionism, the Brothers Grimm and The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.|$|E

He noted that, [...] "Tonight’s episode is <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids.</b> It’s simple and easy to follow, and doesn’t contain any unsettling imagery … but that also prevents it from being especially memorable." [...] Ultimately, he felt that the show's returned fixation on Finn and Jake proved that the expansion of the show's universe was [...] "the best thing that could have happened to it." ...|$|E
500|$|Roy Hrab of DVD Verdict was {{positive}} on the season, but wrote [...] "I {{do not think}} that adults will be as entertained as in previous seasons.

[...] In conclusion, he said [...] "there's nothing new here and adults will be disappointed, but the latest installment of SpongeBob SquarePants delivers a lot of silly and good-natured fun <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> and there's nothing wrong with that." [...] In the Volume 2 review also for the DVD Verdict, Dennis Prince said [...] " [...] is not the series' best work but, nevertheless, is an improvement". He added [...] " [...] delivers more of what SpongeBob fans crave." ...|$|E

After recording Who Are You, Townshend refused to follow the album with a tour unless Moon stopped drinking, and said that if Moon's playing did not improve he would be fired.
