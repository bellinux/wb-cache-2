5|$|Hawks' friend <b>Howard</b> <b>Hughes</b> finally {{suggested}} Cary Grant for the role. Grant {{had just}} finished shooting his breakthrough romantic comedy The Awful Truth, and Hawks may have seen a rough cut of the unreleased film. Grant then had a non-exclusive, four-picture deal with RKO for $50,000 per film, and Grant's manager used his casting in the film to renegotiate his contract, earning him $75,000 plus the bonuses Hepburn was receiving. Grant was initially concerned {{about being able to}} play an intellectual character and took two weeks to accept the role, despite the new contract. Hawks built Grant's confidence by promising to coach him throughout the film, instructing him to watch Harold Lloyd films for inspiration. Grant met with <b>Howard</b> <b>Hughes</b> throughout the film to discuss his character, which he said helped his performance.|$|E
