40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{article focuses}} on flexskins {{comprising}} of a cellular substructure and pre-tensioned <b>facesheet</b> for shear morphing applications. The unit cell of the substructure is a strand with some strain-relief feature, and it supports a segment of pretensioned <b>facesheet.</b> The function of the strain-relief feature {{is to reduce the}} peak strains in the strand and consequently the actuation work during shear morphing. Central hexagonal cells, elliptical cells, and half elliptical cells in the strand provided the sought strain relief {{at the edges of the}} strand, but the sharp corners and the proximity of these central features to those from adjacent strands during shear morphing led to a tendency for the <b>facesheet</b> to wrinkle. Alleviating wrinkling by increasing <b>facesheet</b> pretension increases the morphing actuation work requirement. <b>Facesheet</b> wrinkling can also be reduced by increasing strand separation, but this too requires higher prestrain in the <b>facesheet</b> to limit out-of-plane displacement under aerodynamic loads. The best solution was found to be the use of Gaussian- or Cosine-shaped curved strands which reduced morphing actuation force requirements by around 30 % compared to straight strands used on a previous demonstration aircraft, and the peak strain levels to about 1. 2 % (down from 3. 3 % for straight strands), while avoiding <b>facesheet</b> wrinkling.

40|$|Titanium-graphite hybrid {{laminates}} {{are being}} developed for high-temperature aerospace applications. Experimental observations have indicated that cracks in the titanium facesheets initiate at free edges {{as well as in}} areas of high stress concentration, such as holes and notches and that a delaminated region between the <b>facesheet</b> and the intact plies develops and propagates {{in the wake of the}} <b>facesheet</b> crack. This thesis experimentally and analytically evaluates the <b>facesheet</b> crack and delamination growth behavior of TiGr laminates. The delamination growth behavior is studied by isolating delamination growth using TiGr specimens with <b>facesheet</b> seams. The growth rate of delamination from <b>facesheet</b> seams is related via a power law to the applied strain energy release rate. It is shown that elevated temperatures significantly increase the growth rate of <b>facesheet</b> delamination. The <b>facesheet</b> crack growth behavior in TiGr laminates was measured experimentally and compared to model predictions. It is shown that the crack growth rate in TiGr facesheets is significantly lower for TiGr laminates as compared to monolithic titanium. After an initial decrease in crack growth rate, the crack propagates at a constant rate while the crack growth rate for monolithic titanium increases as the crack extends. (cont.) A three-dimensional finite element model was implemented that captured the experimental crack growth trends without any additional tuning parameters. A global, bridged-crack model was not accurate in predicting the <b>facesheet</b> crack growth behavior of TiGr laminates. The bridged-crack model failed because it did not capture the details of the bridging stresses and delamination in the vicinity of the crack tip. In contrast to the delamination growth from <b>facesheet</b> seams, it was shown that elevated temperatures did not significantly affect the growth rate of the titanium <b>facesheet</b> crack. Future efforts to model composite damage growth using global modeling approach must validate the model to ensure that all of the necessary parameters are captured. by Dennis Arthur Burianek.

In this work, the trapezoidal sandwich structure was designed in the following two ways. Firstly, the trapezoidal core along with its <b>facesheet</b> was 3 D printed as a single element comprising a single material for both core and <b>facesheet</b> (type A); Secondly, the trapezoidal core along with <b>facesheet</b> was 3 D printed, but with variation in <b>facesheet</b> materials (type B).

40|$|During the August 2007 STS- 118 {{mission to}} the International Space Station, a micro-meteoroid or orbital debris (MMOD) {{particle}} impacted and completely penetrated one of shuttle Endeavour s radiator panels and the underlying thermal control system (TCS) blanket, leaving deposits on (but no damage to) the payload bay door. While {{it is not unusual}} for shuttle orbiters to be impacted by small MMOD particles, the damage from this impact is larger than any previously seen on the shuttle radiator panels. A close-up photograph of the radiator impact entry hole is shown in Figure 1, and the location of the impact on Endeavour s left-side aft-most radiator panel is shown in Figure 2. The aft radiator panel is 0. 5 -inches thick and consists of 0. 011 inch thick aluminum facesheets on the front and back of an aluminum honeycomb core. The front <b>facesheet</b> is additionally covered by a 0. 005 inch thick layer of silver-Teflon thermal tape. The entry hole in the silver-Teflon tape measured 8. 1 mm by 6. 4 mm (0. 32 inches by 0. 25 inches). The entry hole in the outer <b>facesheet</b> measured 7. 4 mm by 5. 3 mm (0. 29 inches by 0. 21 inches) (0. 23 inches). The impactor also perforated an existing 0. 012 inch doubler that had been bonded over the <b>facesheet</b> to repair previous impact damage (an example that lightning can strike the same place twice, even for MMOD impact). The peeled-back edge around the entry hole, or lip, is a characteristic of many hypervelocity impacts. High velocity impact with the front <b>facesheet</b> fragmented the impacting particle and caused it to spread out into a debris cloud. The debris cloud caused considerable damage to the internal honeycomb core with 23 honeycomb cells over a region of 28 mm by 26 mm (1. 1 inches by 1. 0 inches) having either been completely destroyed or partially damaged. Figure 3 is a view of the exit hole in the rear <b>facesheet,</b> and partially shows the extent of the honeycomb core damage and clearly shows the jagged petaled exit hole through the backside <b>facesheet.</b> The rear <b>facesheet</b> exit hole damage including cracks in the <b>facesheet</b> measures 14 mm by 14 mm (0. 55 inches by 0. 55 inches). The remnants of the impacting particle and radiator panel material blown through the rear <b>facesheet</b> hole also created two penetrations in the TCS blanket 115 mm (4. 5 inches) behind the rear <b>facesheet.</b> Figure 4 shows these two impacts, which are located 75 mm (3 inches) apart. Some deposits of material were found on the payload bay door beneath the TCS blanket, but no additional damage occurred to the door.

40|$|Composite {{sandwich}} structures are applied in many engineering fields {{due to their}} high strength and stiffness but lightweight properties. There are currently not many studies that simultaneously consider both indentation and strain failure in the composite sandwich plate especially in presence of impact loading. Such knowledge is necessary to determine the <b>facesheet</b> strain after impact {{in order to find}} out whether the <b>facesheet</b> is totally failed as a result of indentation deformation. Hence, {{the purpose of this study}} is to model numerically the top <b>facesheet</b> indentation and strain failure of a fixed-end composite sandwich plate with honeycomb core when it is subjected to low-velocity impact at the center. The faceheets are made from Hercules AW 193 -PW prepreg consisting of AS 4 fibers in a 3501 - 6 matrix (carbon/epoxy) with a stacking sequence of [0 / 90]. The honeycomb core is made from HRH 10 1 / 8 - 3. 0 Nomex honeycomb (Ciba-Geigy). Type of the impactor used in this study is flat-ended cylinder, which is made from case-hardened steel. The composite sandwich plate is modeled as a two-dimensional problem with five and three degrees of freedom per node for the facesheets and honeycomb core, respectively. Only the stiffness matrix, [K], and the mass matrix, [M], are considered in determining the responses of the plate. Responses in terms of indentation, strain failure and displacement are explored for various <b>facesheet</b> and core properties. It is found that an increase in number of ply and ply thickness reduce the indentation on the top <b>facesheet.</b> Also, the most effective parameter in improving the strain failure of the top <b>facesheet</b> is the crushing resistance of the core...|$|E

40|$|Several {{structural}} sandwich composites arc {{in service}} on military and commercial aerospace vehicles, however, these components {{have been limited}} to secondary structures partly because the impact damage and damage tolerance of these composites have not been extensively characterized. To improve durability, safety, and life cycle performance of PMCs while reducing maintenance costs, combined analysis, and test methods that provide a means of predicting critical engineering properties after impact damage of the structure, must be developed. A key enabling technology here is {{the establishment of the}} correlation between the impact test results conducted in the laboratory and the mechanics-based phenomenological solutions. This research was undertaken to investigate the compression and flexural properties following low velocity impact of a nomex/phenolic honeycomb core, fiberglass/epoxy <b>facesheet,</b> midplane asymmetric sandwich composite. One <b>facesheet</b> (thin side) was composed of two plies of the fiberglass/epoxy (0 / 90), while the other <b>facesheet</b> (thick side) was composed of four plies (0 / 90 / 0 / 90) of fiberglass/epoxy. Due to the differences in <b>facesheet</b> thickness, impact damage was separately induced on the thick side as well as the thin side. The compression and flexural strength properties for each damage arrangement were compared using different levels of impact energy ranging from 0 to 452 Joules. In all cases, higher impact energy resulted in decreased compression and flexural strength. Impact on the thin side showed slightly more retention of compression strength at low impact levels, whereas higher residual compressive strength was observed from impact on the thick side at higher impact levels.

40|$|AbstractAnalytical {{predictions}} {{are presented}} for the plastic collapse strength of lightweight sandwich beams having pin-reinforced foam cores that are loaded in 3 -point bending. Both polymer and aluminum foam cores are considered, whilst the <b>facesheet</b> and the pins {{are made of}} either composite or metal. Four different failure modes are account for: metal <b>facesheet</b> yield or composite <b>facesheet</b> microbuckling, <b>facesheet</b> wrinkling, plastic shear of the core, and <b>facesheet</b> indentation beneath the loading rollers. A micromechanics-based model is developed and combined with the homogenization approach to calculate the effective properties of pin-reinforced foam cores. To calculate the elastic buckling strength of pin reinforcements, the pin-reinforced foam core is treated as assemblies of simply supported columns resting upon an elastic foundation. Minimum mass design of the sandwich is then obtained {{as a function of}} the prescribed structural load index, subjected to the constraint that none of the above failure modes occurs. Collapse mechanism maps are constructed and compared with the failure maps of foam-cored sandwich beams without pin reinforcements. Finite element simulations are carried out to verify the analytical model and to study the performance and failure mechanisms of the sandwich subject to loading types other than 3 -point bending. The results demonstrate that the weaker the foam is, the more optimal the pin-reinforced foam core becomes, and that sandwich beams with pin-reinforced polymer foam cores are structurally more efficient than foam- or truss-cored sandwich beams...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Three-dimensional (3 -D) {{spacer fabric}} {{composite}} {{is a novel}} lightweight sandwich structure, the reinforcement of which is integrally woven with two facesheets connected by continuous fibers (named piles) in the core. Usually the 3 -D spacer fabric composite without extra reinforcement is called mono-spacer fabric composite, which provides outstanding <b>facesheet</b> / core debonding resistance. However, its mechanical properties cannot meet the demand of structure application because of the thin <b>facesheet</b> and low load-bearing capacity of high piles. Hence, two reinforcement methods were developed by laminating additional weaves at the <b>facesheet</b> and filling foam materials in the core to strengthen the <b>facesheet</b> and piles, respectively. This paper aims to investigate the influences of reinforcement methods on the mechanical behaviors and damage modes of 3 -D spacer fabric composites under flatwise compressive, shear, edgewise compressive and three-point bending loads, by comparing with mono-spacer fabric composites. The results indicate that additional weaves reinforcement can enhance edgewise compressive and flexural properties effectively. Foam filling {{is one of the}} best options to improve the flatwise compressive and shear properties, and especially, there are synergistic effects between piles and foam under flatwise compressive load.
