40|$|In Greek antiquity, <b>gravity,</b> <b>actuated</b> by archers on city walls, turned many a tide, as victorious besiegers routed a city 2 ̆ 7 s land forces, {{but in the}} {{excitement}} of pursuit, got {{too close to the}} city walls! Xenophon presents one such instance as but the most recent of many cases, in relating the death of Teleutias. The bow, among the Greeks, was the principal weapon for the city besieged. The bow being so effective in this situation explains why the an early advance in ancient siege machinery was the movable tower. It is an anti-gravity machine! Its purpose was to zero out the gravity advantage of arrows from heights! According to Vitruvius (10. 13) Diades, Alexander 2 ̆ 7 s engineer, claimed the invention of the movable tower. You build it out of range, as high as the city walls, or even higher, armor the front with hides, move it up, and give your archers a fair chance to clear the city walls. Here, for once, is a situation where archers fighting archers is the main event in ancient Greece...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{challenge}} of descending steep, loose slopes is avoiding avalanche, tipover and maintaining control of locomotion. Theory suggests that for loose, granular soil,the strength lies under, not on, the surface. This has not hitherto been exploited for controlling robot descent. In {{order to take}} advantage of this, a prototype robot capable of utilizing sub-surface strength was developed and tested. Two unique features are low center-of <b>gravity</b> and an <b>actuated</b> plow capable of penetrating the ground for controlling descent and facilitating pivot. Tests show unprecedented control during descent on loose soil slopes up to 40 degrees. Avalanche sliding is reduced twenty-fold, pivot turning is improved threefold...|$|R
40|$|Configuration of {{locomotion}} for planetary rovers {{is motivated}} by increased interest in exploring lunar polar craters. Current rover designs cannot achieve the ascent or descent required by steep, unconsolidated lunar slopes. New designs must provide locomotive capability for steep climbing, techniques for controlling slip, and safely navigating down and along steep slopes. We propose a locomotion system designed to show unprecedented capabilities in steep terrain through a track-based system featuring a low center of <b>gravity</b> and an <b>actuated,</b> omni-directional plowing device. Experimental results show unprecedented locomotion in steep terrain, capable of controlled ascent on 35 ◦ slopes, controlled descent and point turning on 38 ◦ slopes. For descent, {{the use of a}} plow is shown to reduce slip twenty-fold in linear descent, and threefold in point turns...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFriction {{modeling}} {{is essential}} for joint dynamic identification and control. Joint friction is composed of a viscous and a dry friction force. According to Coulomb law, dry friction depends linearly on the load in the transmission. However, in robotics field, a constant dry friction is frequently used to simplify modeling, identification and control. That is not accurate enough for joints with large payload or inertial and <b>gravity</b> variations and <b>actuated</b> with transmissions as speed reducer, screw-nut or worm gear. A new joint friction model taking dynamic and external forces into account is proposed in this paper. A new identification process is proposed, merging all the joint data collected while the mechanism is tracking exciting trajectories and with different payloads, to get a global LS estimation in one step. An experimental validation is carried out with a prismatic joint composed of a Star high precision ball screw drive positioning unit...|$|R
40|$|International audienceUsually, {{the joint}} {{transmission}} friction model for robots {{is composed of}} a viscous friction force and of a constant dry friction force. However, according to the Coulomb law, the dry friction force depends linearly on the load driven by the transmission. It follows that this effect {{must be taken into}} account for robots working with large variation of the payload or inertial and <b>gravity</b> forces, and <b>actuated</b> with transmissions as speed reducer, screw-nut or worm gear. This paper proposes a new inverse dynamic identification model for n degrees of freedom (dof) serial robot, where the dry friction force is a linear function of both the dynamic and the external forces. A new identification procedure groups all the joint data collected while the robot is tracking planned trajectories with different payloads to get a global least squares estimation, in one step, of inertial and new friction parameters. An experimental validation is carried out with a 1 dof prismatic joint composed of a Star high precision ball screw drive positioning unit, which allows large and easy variations of the inertial and gravity force...|$|R
