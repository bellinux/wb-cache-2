5000|$|Bhaskaran faces many {{obstacles}} {{in his path}} to prove himself. He is insulted by Chandrika's father Shanmugasundaram (Chitra Lakshmanan), and does not even {{have a place to}} live. After many difficulties, Bhaskaran, with the support of Nallathambi, establishes a tutorial for Class X students. Nallathambi goes and gets money from Velpandi (Rajendran), a local don, who signs an agreement that if his son Paalpandi (Ashvin Raja) does not pass in his exam, he will take Nallathambi's property and make him work in his cow <b>dung</b> <b>place.</b> Velpandi reveals his family history: his father, in his X standard examination, forced his teacher to write the exam. Velpandi, during his exam, wrote only four words in his paper with a billhook symbol, blackmailing the teacher into making him pass or risk being killed. Velpandi's son Paalpandi sleeps in exam hall and if anybody tries to wake him, he will bite the teacher's hand. However, in the end, Paalpandi's son starts to study and makes other's listen in the class when Bhaskaran appoints a blind teacher. Despite early setbacks, Bhaskaran makes a very heavy profit on the deal, while his students top in the state, Velpaandi's son passes in his exam with good marks. Velpaandi tears the agreement, offer's Nallathambi huge amount of money with no interest and appreciates him for making Paalpandi pass in the exams. It also convinces Chandrika, who eventually reciprocates his love. However, Shanmugasundaram is against the marriage as he had once been insulted by a drunk Nallathambi, who also gave him the nickname [...] "Mongoose Mandaiyan" [...] (Mongoose Head). Shiva (Jiiva), a supposed teetotaller, is introduced as Chandrika's prospective groom. Bhaskaran then confronts Shiva, explaining to him that he loves Chandrika. The two get into a fight soon after, but when Shanmugasundaram arrives at the spot, he learns the truth: Shiva was hired by Bhaskaran to fool everyone about his identity. Under Shiva and Bhaskaran's orders, a disappointed Shanmugasundaram finally is forced to unite Bhaskaran and Chandrika.|$|E
5|$|Following {{extensive}} {{discussions on}} the fighting ability of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam, the Political Bureau approved the General Staff’s plan, which had selected the Central Highlands as the main battlefield for the upcoming offensive. The Central Highlands campaign was codenamed ‘Campaign 275’ and {{the goal was to}} capture the city of Ban Me Thuot. To achieve that objective, North Vietnamese General Văn Tiến <b>Dũng</b> <b>placed</b> great emphasis on the principles of massed force, secrecy, and surprise to draw South Vietnamese forces away from the main objective. For the element of surprise to be successful, North Vietnamese forces needed to launch strong diversionary attacks on Pleiku and Kon Tum, thereby leaving Ban Me Thuot completely exposed. Once the element of surprise had been achieved, the North Vietnamese would mass their forces on Ban Me Thuot, and prevent South Vietnamese reinforcements from retaking the city.|$|R

50|$|In 1930 {{she also}} began her {{innovative}} process of deep carved pottery. Her carved blackware pottery was an original creation. She credits a shard of carved pottery {{that was found}} by her husband while deer hunting for giving her the idea. Using a sharp knife and a chisel she would carve out her designs. She carefully sanded her edges to create a “cameo” style with the design standing out in low relief. She would then sand {{the edges of her}} design to create more rounded forms. She used an old-style yucca brush when adding painted designs to her pieces. Some of her favorite designs were the Avanyu (water serpent), birds, clouds, seeds uncurling, thunderbird (mythology) figures and kiva steps. When firing she used juniper wood and cow <b>dung,</b> <b>placing</b> the pots upside down on a metal grate to allow the flames to swirl evenly around them. She would often fire up to twenty pots at a time. During the 1930s and 40s she traded these innovative pots for food, allowing her to feed her large family. By the 1970s she had received numerous awards from the Santa Fe Indian Market, the Gallup Intertribal Ceremonial and had become a well-known and successful potter. Gonzales taught her son Tse-Pe to make pottery along with his wife Dora and their daughter Irene. Gonzales and Tse-Pe sometimes worked together, especially when creating pottery in duotones (two shades of the same color). While Tse-Pe also carves pottery he prefers sgraffito, which is carving designs in low relief. Gonzales had a major influence on pottery making at San Ildefonso, and today her pieces have become highly valued by collectors. She died in 1989.|$|R

40|$|The {{effects or}} {{vegetation}} cover on the abundance and species richness of dung beetles (Aphodiidae) {{were examined in}} three altitudinal zones: lowland (520 – 600 m), mid-altitude (950 – 963 m) and highland (1230 – 1275 m). Pitfall traps baited with fresh cattle <b>dung</b> were <b>placed</b> in three vegetation types at each altitudinal zone: forest, heathland and pasture. Species richness was lower in forests than in the other vegetation types. The total abundance of beetles also varied with vegetation type, but the effect was dependent on altitude. Number of individuals was higher in pasture at highlands and in heathland and forest at mid-altitude and lowlands. An altitudinal dependence of distribution of individuals between vegetation types was also found for the more abundant species in the study area. These results could be explained if the local distribution of individuals between vegetation types was determined by microcli-matic factors, mainly temperature. Differences in altitude between sites are associated with temperature changes, determining the habitat selection of species at each altitude...|$|R
50|$|Seriemas build a large bulky stick nest, {{lined with}} leaves and <b>dung,</b> which is <b>placed</b> {{in a tree}} 1 - 5 m off the ground. The {{placement}} of the nest is so that the adults can reach the nest by foot rather than flying, through hops and the occasional flutter. Both sexes are involved in building the nest. They lay two or three white or buff eggs sparsely spotted with brown and purple. The female {{does most of the}} incubation, which lasts from 24 to 30 days. Hatchlings are downy but stay in the nest for about two weeks; after which they leave the nest and follow both parents. They reach full maturity at the age of four to five months. It is unknown when fledged chicks reach sexual maturity.|$|R
5000|$|The nest is domed and {{measures}} 30 by 30 by 20 cm. The nest is usually {{placed on the}} ground {{at the bottom of a}} large rock, stump of roots, [...] but has also been reported being placed in a tree up to 2.7 m off the ground. The nest is made from branches and twigs, roots, plant fibres, mosses, strips of bark and feathers. The inside is lined with grass and other fine plant material, and new lining material is often brought into the nest during changeovers during incubation. Nests sometimes have a ramp built to the entrance made of sticks, and animal <b>dung</b> is sometimes <b>placed</b> in the entranceway and inside the nest.

5000|$|Although some zinc {{artifacts}} {{appear to}} have been made during classical antiquity in Europe, the first production of zinc in quantity seems to have been in India starting from 12th century and later in China from 16th century. [...] In India, zinc was produced at Zawar from the 12th to the 18th centuries. The sphalerite ore found here was presumably converted to zinc oxide via roasting, although no archaeological evidence of this has been found. Smelting is thought to have been done in sealed cylindrical clay retorts which were packed with a mixture of roasted ore, dolomite, and an organic material, perhaps cow <b>dung,</b> and then <b>placed</b> vertically in a furnace and heated to around 1100 °C. Carbon monoxide produced by the charring of the organic material would have reduced the zinc oxide to zinc vapour, which then liquefied in a conical clay condenser {{at the bottom of the}} retort, dripping down into a collection vessel. Over the period 1400-1800, production is estimated to have been about 200 kg/day. [...] Zinc was also smelted in China from the mid-sixteenth century on.|$|R
50|$|Termites {{are usually}} viewed as both herbivores and {{decomposers}} when present within an ecological community. In some cases, {{they are the}} link between mammalian consumers and the microbial decomposers that perform the final breaking down of organic matter within the local cycle of nutrients. A case of this relationship between termites and mammalian dung middens is observed in South Africa, between the endemic blesbok and harvester termites. The blesbok have been observed to deliberately <b>place</b> <b>dung</b> middens {{when they are in}} the vicinity of the harvester termite mounds. It has been suggested that this could be due to the fact that termite mounds are built on ground where the surrounding is cleared. This allows the blesboks greater ability to detect predators if foraging in the area, and termite presence in the vicinity could be an indicator of richer resources available from recycling of nutrients. Since decomposers such as termites increase the quality of the surrounding vegetation for foraging, this suggests that there is a positive evolutionary feedback within this interaction, with both participants in this interaction providing resources for the other.|$|R
40|$|Concern for {{environmental}} impact of chemical insecticides used for desert locust control has increased and improved knowledge about insecticide impact on faunal non-target organisms (NTOs) in the natural environments of the desert locust is needed. In this thesis, I investigated the impact of chlorpyrifos and carbosulfan on NTOs. I aimed at identifying species that were vulnerable to insecticides under natural conditions in a desert locust breeding area; the Red Sea Coast of Sudan. Survival rate, abundance, activity, density and species richness in a treated and an untreated area were compared using pre- and post-spray monitoring periods. Suitable reaction indicators and methodologies, which had potential {{for environmental}} monitoring of control operations, were sought. Juvenile prawns of Metapenaeus monoceros, (Penaeidae), in the mangrove lagoon were affected negatively by an aerial application of chlorpyrifos. Adverse effects were also detected on antlions, Cueta sp., (Myrmeleontidae), and hoopoe larks, Alaemon alaudipes, (Alaudidae), counted along transects. Negative effects, considered attributable to the insecticide application, were found using pitfall trapping for i) the beetle Mesostena angustata, (Tenebrionidae), ii) crickets both at the species level, Gryllus bimaculatus, and family level, Gryllidae, and iii) arachnids. Dung beetles (Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae and Aphodiinae) sampled in <b>dung</b> pats <b>placed</b> in the field showed a response to carbosulfan within 24 h after application against desert locusts. Abundance of Onthophagus margaritifer (Scarabaeinae) declined after spraying. Numbers of Aphodius lucidus (Aphodiinae) and Aphodiinae beetles at the subfamily level increased. There was a marked difference in dung beetle abundance and species richness between two biotopes; Acacia tortilis shrubland and cultivated wetland. The {{results suggest that the}} studied organisms and the applied methodologies (simple, robust, and low-cost) could be useful for environmental monitoring of desert locust control. Follow-up studies and refinements of the methodologies are suggested...|$|R
40|$|We {{have been}} talking about organic farming and {{sustainable}} agriculture for more than a decade. Many scientific meetings have been organized to discuss these themes. It appears, however, that up until now the results have been more rhetorical than practical. Hundreds of papers have been published on the potential damage which chemical fertilizers can do, while the mass media have been warning the public that the continued heavy use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides will lead to catastrophe. However, there is no sign that the use of chemical fer-tilizers has declined. This may reflect the fact that as far as these issues are concerned, {{there seems to be a}} big gap between the ideal situation people talk about, and what can be done in practice. It appears that this phenomenon is not confined to the agricultural sector. In every sector in every nation, both developed and developing, people are assiduously seeking “growth” while talking about “limits to growth”. In Korea, a small number of farmers are known to be engaged in organic farming. The practices they follow, however, in the name of organic farming are not consistent, nor are their motives or the soundness of their technologies. Some of them are attempting to produce “clean food ” (asking a higher price for it than for ordinary produce), aimed at those consumers who can afford it. The “cleanliness ” of such products has not yet been clearly defined. Both producers and consumers believe that using organic manure (mostly containing animal <b>dung)</b> in <b>place</b> of chemical fertilizers, and not using the chemically synthesized pesticides, are an assur-ance that “clean food ” is being produced. The reliability of this belief has not yet been criti-cally examined. People tend to believe that organic farming is more sustainable and more friendly to the environment than conventional farming. This belief needs close examination. In this paper, I attempt to analyze what Korean farmers understand by the concept of organic farming, how they practice it, the problems involved, and how it should develop...|$|R
40|$|Scarabaeinae are {{sensitive}} to structural habitat changes caused by disturbance. We compared copronecrophagous beetle (Scarabaeinae) community structure in three differently managed zones within an agroecosystem of the northern Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. We <b>placed</b> <b>dung</b> and carrion traps once a month from June 2004 through May 2005. The beetle community included 17 species from the genera Canthon, Canthidium, Deltochilum, Pseudocanthon, Malagoniella, Onthophagus, Phanaeus, Copris, Uroxys, Sisyphus and Ateuchus. The secondary vegetation had a higher beetle diversity {{than the other two}} zones. Species richness was highest in the Brosimum alicastrum plantation. The pasture had the lowest species diversity and richness, but exhibited the highest abundance of Scarabaeinae in the dry season. The two zones with extensive tree cover were the most diverse. Roller beetles were dominant over burrower species and small-sized species outnumbered large species. Our data show two important issues: beetle species in the pasture extended their activity {{to the beginning of the}} dry season, while abundances dropped in the other, unirrigated zones; and the possibility that the Scarabaeinae living in neotropical forests are opportunistic saprophages and have specialized habits for resources other than dung. The B. alicastrum plantation is beneficial to the entire ranch production system because it functions as a dispersion and development area for stenotopic species limited to tree cover...|$|R
40|$|Seed {{dispersal}} {{has become}} an important issue in plant ecology and restoration management. In this paper we examined dung germinating seed content and seed deposition patterns of horses (Shetland and Konik breeds) and Scottish Highland cattle grazing two coastal dune nature reserves. Two times 2. 5  l of fresh dung from each type of herbivore were collected during seven sessions in the main fruiting season. <b>Dung</b> samples were <b>placed</b> under greenhouse conditions after drying and cooling. Animal defecation patterns were derived from a study of herbivore activities during 6  h observation sessions 8 times a month. One hundred and seventeen plant species i. e. 27 % of all species occurring in the study area, were recorded as seedlings emerging from the dung samples. The most abundantly and frequently recorded plant species were Urtica dioica, Juncus spp. and different species of Poaceae and Caryophyllaceae. In general seedling density is high (1158 seedlings/dung sample). Seedling density and species richness were further analysed in order to detect temporal variability and possible animal and site related characteristics. Dung deposition patterns reflect a non-random use of habitats and hence a non-random seed deposition among habitats. Calculated seed deposition per square meter ranged from a few (< 10 germinating seeds) to more than 100 in the most frequently selected habitats. From the herbivores’ selective habitat use and their estimated mean retention time we can further assume their ability for inter-habitat endozoochorous seed dispersal. This characteristic of large herbivores is further discussed {{in the light of}} nature management and restoration...|$|R
40|$|Biogas ? {{clean energy}} from cattle dung Cue: The burning of animal dung {{as a source}} of energy is often criticised for {{removing}} valuable nutrients from farming systems. However, there is a way that farmers can get energy from livestock manure and still use it {{as a source of}} fertility on their fields. When manure decomposes it releases a natural gas ? a mixture of methane and carbon dioxide ? which makes an excellent and clean fuel for cooking and lighting. In India and China this ?biogas? is used by millions of small farms, helping to improve farm sanitation as well as providing a low cost source of energy. In Africa, Uganda is leading the way in the adoption of biogas. Even here, however, it is still quite rare. Wambi Michael recently travelled to Mukono district to meet Ruth Musoke, one of Uganda?s biogas pioneers. IN:	?Madam Musoke, you are one ? OUT:	? delay the less fire you get. ? DUR?N:	 5 ? 23 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Ruth Musoke, one of Uganda?s biogas pioneers, talking to Wambi Michael. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Michael	Madam Musoke, {{you are one of the}} few farmers within Mukono who are using a biogas digester. How did you learn about the biogas digesters? Musoke	We have a friend called Pastor Kakembo, he came and visited our place, he suggested to us that we can install a biogas system at our place because we had cows and he had the same system at his place. So we went to his place and we admired the system. So he is the one who gave us the technical person who did the work for us. Michael	When did this begin? Musoke	That was almost 8 years back. Michael	And has it been working throughout 8 years now? Musoke	Yes, very successfully. We normally use it for cooking and lighting. We get light from biogas and then fire. Michael	So let?s go back to where the process begins. I can see this hole here, what is it for? Musoke	This one is for the collection of urine from the main building where the cows stay throughout the day, but it was not enough, the urine was a lot so we had to construct another pit where the urine collects up. And that one it is more comfortable because it is where we do the mixing. Michael	How do you mix the cow dung into the digester? Musoke	At that system, there are two bowls which are prepared for the mixture. So we get urine from the pit and then we collect cow <b>dung</b> from the <b>place</b> where we keep the animals, and then we mix it up, pour it in the main digester. That is how it is done. Michael	We have heard reports that you need 19 kgs of cow dung daily to feed a digester. Where do you get the 19 kgs of cow dung? Musoke	Me, I have almost 9 animals and I normally use 2 wheelbarrows of cow dung to get the biogas I need for my home consumption. Michael	Do you have some excess of cow dung which you don?t use because you have many animals? Musoke	Yes, I have a lot of it. Because what I have, I can?t mix it up on a daily basis. We collect cow dung in the morning and in the evening. So we have a reserve pit again, where we keep this cow dung, the one which is not used up for biogas system, and it is normally taken up by those farmers and other people who have the system and don?t have access to cow dung. Michael	Can we go to the fireplace and see how it works? Musoke	Yes. Michael	In most times when you come to a kitchen like this in rural areas in Uganda, you see a lot of soot, but I can see here it?s very clean. Musoke	Yes and it?s because I?m using fire from biogas. Michael	Because normally entering such a kitchen would mean that maybe we would see some tears coming out of you! Musoke	I don?t think it?s so clean, but that?s how it is. Michael	OK. I see very clean fire coming out of the gas plate. Where is the fire coming from? Musoke	It is coming through the other pipe and these are the switches. Michael	Which means you can cook two saucepans of food on this same gas plate? Musoke	Yes, according to your plates. It can go up to three or four, it depends on what you want. Michael	So can you switch it back on? So how long does it take to boil such water? Musoke	It depends on the amount which you want, because now it is at the maximum. You can reduce, depending on the type of fire you want and on what you are cooking. Michael	How clean is the biogas? Musoke	Whatever you prepare is so clean, even the saucepan, they don?t get stained. Blue flames only, which doesn?t stain. And the maintenance is so low, just to repair the other plate, because they get stained. That thing is done in Katwe. Michael	Does it rust? Musoke	Yes. For instance you are cooking something, what you are cooking pours on it and then that metal part of it rusts. That is the main problem with it. But I have changed it ever since it was there only two times. Michael	What about the digester, does it require some maintenance? Musoke	Ever since we installed it we have never done any maintenance, but what you need to do, you have to be committed in mixing this. You become so smelly on the day when you do the mixing. That?s why some people don?t want that business. But here it is done, we regularly do it. I do it, my children do it, everyone who is on duty does it. We don?t employ someone to mix for us. Michael	Many Ugandans have heard of the biogas but many fear the installation costs. How much did it cost you to install this system in this farm? Musoke	We used almost 2. 5 million to install the system. Michael	And you think you have reaped some money from the 2. 5 million shillings that you initially invested here? Musoke	A lot, I have saved a lot, because what gets out of the system? They come here, those ones who are doing the business of the gardens and what, they get that waste from me and they give me some money. What matters most is for someone who is using this biogas to be active in mixing. The more you mix the more fire you get, the more you delay the less fire you get.
