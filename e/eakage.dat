40|$|Anodic {{polarization}} {{curves of}} gold and gold-plated copper specimens have been obtained at a sweep rate of 10 mV/min in 0. 1 M NH 4 C 1 electrolyte. The curves obtained {{are found to be}} linear over ranges of potential approaching 50 mV displacement from the free corrosion potential. From the data ob-tained, values of the free corrosion potential, the polarization admittance, and the leakage current are extracted and compared for each specimen. Agreement between the corrosion potential and polarization admittance values is ex-cellent. It is shown that the polarization admittances of gold-plated copper specimens in 0. 1 M NH 4 C 1 vary with the apparent exposed area fraction of copper according to expressions derived by Stern. Agreement between the corrosion potential and leakage current values is fair, becoming poorer as the polarizing potential is displaced farther from the free corrosion po-tential. It is shown that at a given value of the polarizing potential, <b>eakage</b> cur-rents passed by gold-plated copper specimens in 0. 1 M NH 4 C 1 vary directly wit...|$|E

As technology moves into deep subbmicron featuree sizes, the stati ic or leakage poower is expected to inccrease because of the exponen ntial increase in leakage curreents witth technology scaling. Wi ithin die-process variation is inccreasing in nannometer technologies, it is obsserve that leakkage powwer will become comparabl le to dynamic or total powwer disssipation in the next generat tion processorss in the next few yeaars.

40|$|Purpose. To {{evaluate}} ileorectal anastomosis (IRA) {{in selected}} ulcerative colitis patients. Methods. Early and late complications after IRA and IPAA were investigated. Bowel function {{and quality of}} life were assessed. Functional and QoL studies were performed as a matched pair analysis, comparing 98 patients who underwent IRA versus 98 patients who underwent IPAA. Results. In IRA group, 2 patients (1. 6 %) developed anastomotic l dysplasia (HGD) developed in 3 patients dysplasia (HGD) developed in 3 patients <b>eakage,</b> 1 patient (0. 8 %) had intestinal obstruction, and 2 patients (1. 6 %) had abdominal hematoma. Mean follow-up was 11. 5 (range: 2 – 24. 3) years. Failure of IRA occurred in 19 patients (15. 1 %); in 12 patients (9. 5 %), failure was related to severe proctitis, in 3 patients (2. 4 %), it was related to the development of high-grade dysplasia, and in 4 patients (3. 2 %), it was related to the development of rectal cancer. About functional results, stool consistency [liquid (6. 7 % of IRA patients versus 29 % of IPAA patients; p= 0. 003) ], daily soiling (0 % versus 6 %; p= 0. 01), and nocturnal soiling (6 % versus 25. 5 %; p= 0. 03) were statistically different. Only 1 % of IRA patients versus 11 % of IPAA patients had episodes of perianal inflammation (p= 0. 007). CGQoL was 0. 72 (± 0. 14, SD) in IRA patients and 0. 75 (± 0. 11, SD) in IPAA patients (p=ns). Conclusion. In selected patients, IRA is an appropriate surgical option, with low morbidity, comparable quality of life, and better functional results than IPAA...|$|E
40|$|Downloauppressing {{this source}} of {{conduction}} {{is to reduce}} the thickness of he film {{in order to ensure that}} during accumulation the surface epletion layer extends completely through the film. For films that ave been formed by solid-phase crystallization (SPC), however, rain size and mobility is observed to increase with film thickness. 3 ence, there has to be a trade-off between the driver capability and <b>eakage</b> current. It can be seen, therefore, that film thickness plays an mportant role in determining both carrier mobility and leakage cur-ents in TFTs fabricated using solid-phase crystallized material. A study of the effects of annealing conditions and film thickness n the structural and electrical characteristics of material produced by PC has been undertaken. Particular attention has been paid to par-ially crystallized material which exhibits improved conductivities hile maintaining relatively high activation energies. This has impli-ations for maximizing the on-off ratios in TFTs. The fine scale defect icrostructure of such material has been characterized using conven-ional and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM). he electrical conduction mechanisms have been studied by analyzing he activation energy characteristics of the material under various tages of crystallization. Previous work, which has examined activa-ion energy characteristics, has concentrated on either amorphous, 4 ully crystallized material, 3 or a comparison of the two. 5 Little work, owever, has been carried out on the nature and properties of partial-y crystallized material with a view to balancing the conflicting re-vide material covering the varying extremes of crystallinity. A set of samples was also left as-deposited, i. e., amorphous, for reference. Current-voltage (I-V) measurements were carried out between surface electrodes on each sample at temperatures ranging from 30 to 2508 C in order to calculate the activation energy. Mirocstructural characterization of partially crystallized material was performed using a JEOL 4000 EX-II electron microscope...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{operational}} improvements {{over the}} last 10 - 15 years, water utilities still are losing {{a significant amount of}} potable water from their networks through leakage. The leakage is managed on the one hand by reactive and proactive maintenance {{and on the other hand}} by pressure control to reduce background leakage from connection and joints. This paper is based on experience from the Process Control – Water Software Systems group which was involved in many pressure control projects and the current Neptune project (www. neptune. ac. uk). A fast and efficient method to calculate time schedules and flow modulation curves is presented. Both time and flow modulation can be applied to a single inlet DMA. Time modulation can be applied to a multi-inlet district metering area (DMA) but this is not always possible for flow modulation due to the risk of hunting. It is convenient to distinguish between boundary and internal pressure reducing valves (PRVs), the decision variable for a boundary valve is a PRV set-point whereas for the internal valves it is a valve resistance. The resistance is then automatically translated into a set-point for field implementation. The time modulation methodology is based on solving a nonlinear programming problem with equality constraints represented by a hydraulic model with a pressure dependent leakage term and inequality constraints representing operational requirements (e. g. pressure at critical nodes). The cost of boundary flows which include leakage flows is minimized. An extended content model with pressure dependent leakage is simulated to provide a starting point for quick convergence. Optimal time schedules are converted into flow modulation curves by plotting scatter plots of flows against heads. The algorithm has been implemented as a module in the FINESSE package and allows complete pressure control tasks to be solved. A user needs to provide an hydraulic model, <b>eakage</b> information and leakage characteristic – leakage area and the exponent in the pressure power law. The program calculates time schedules and also flow modulation curves for single and multi-inlet PRVs. Evaluation of optimal control strategies and benefit analysis in terms of leakage reduction for two case studies provided by Yorkshire Water Services is included...|$|E
