25|$|Since {{social media}} {{marketing}} {{first came to}} be, strategists and markets <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>getting</b> smarter and more careful with the way they go about collecting information and distributing advertisements. With the presence of data collecting companies, {{there is no longer}} a need to target specific audiences. This can be seen as a large ethical gray area. For many users, this is a breach of privacy, but there are no laws that prevent these companies from using the information provided on their websites. Companies like Equifax, Inc., TransUnion Corp, and LexisNexis Group thrive on collecting and sharing personal information of social media users. In 2012, Facebook purchased information from 70 million households from a third party company called Datalogix. Facebook later revealed that they purchased the information in order to create a more efficient advertising service.|$|E

2500|$|Humans, as empirically-minded beings, tend to {{recognize}} a threat explicitly only once it has actually materialized. [...] In World War I {{it was only after}} frontal attacks had met with carnage from machine guns, that alternative military tactics were devised. [...] To be sure, conflict springs eternal: [...] between communities; between individuals; within a given individual. [...] What distinguishes history's contemporary period is that—with the exponential growth of population, science, technology, economic activity, weapons destructiveness, and environmental degradation—global threats, military and environmental, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>getting</b> ever more comprehensive: [...] now, willy-nilly, everyone on Earth is affected. [...] However, if solutions to existential global threats can find consensus, then their enforcement may find precedents in verification procedures that have been used in connection with 20th- and 21st-century threatened-species-protection agreements, searches for weapons of mass destruction, and strategic-arms reductions.|$|E
2500|$|Lancashire were {{promoted}} back to {{the first}} division of the county championship in 2005, winning the second division title in the process. They stayed up in the National League, progressed to the finals' day of the Twenty20 Cup and were knocked out in the semi-final of the C Trophy. Despite winning the second division title, there were concerns that the squad may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>getting</b> too old and that there were limited opportunities for the younger players. Of Lancashire's performance over the season, Watkinson said [...] "I was not happy about our batting and, although we have achieved what we set out to do– get promoted– our performance left a lot to be desired". Lancashire are one of three teams, along with Middlesex and Surrey, never to have finished bottom in the County Championship. On their return to the first division in the 2006 season, Lancashire finished second in the Championship. They also finished as runners-up in the NatWest Trohpy.|$|E

The first student said that Ravi encouraged him to text friends to watch Clementi's date and that Ravi used his computer to test {{the angle of the}} webcam so that it was pointed at Clementi's bed. The second student said that after dinner Ravi [...] "hyped up" [...] his earlier [...] "dare you" [...] tweet, that Ravi used her computer to access his iChat, and that [...] "Tyler's side of the room came into view" [...] when the webcam was accessed.

2500|$|I was {{operated}} on that afternoon. As soon as I woke the surgeon, John Bartlett, {{was sitting on}} the end of my bed to tell me the bi-op was malignant... John found it hard to tell me and I found it hard to accept... I had to ring Mum and Dad in Deniliquin to tell them there was some bad news. Somehow you float through it even though you are scared s---less... The hardest part is the initial part, once you know what's in front of you it gets better. I don't want to trivialise cancer in any way. You have to let the emotion out then sit down and become realistic ... I never asked if my life was in the balance. My parents taught me, my school taught me, sport taught me but in particular cancer taught me that trust is the most powerful emotion we have. I trusted my doctors and nurses implicitly. It was amazing what I learnt about the power of the mind and how important trust is... There were the [...] "how in the hell did I get it?" [...] moments.

[...] Woomble, Jones and Newton were tagged in the photo of a recording/rehearsal studio. On 5 November, Roddy Woomble confirmed that the band {{were in the process}} of writing a new album, stating: [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>getting</b> asked about this a lot recently, and it is no secret that Idlewild are making a new album (There are some photographs of a recent writing session in a Hebridean cabin up on the Idlewild facebook page) it is being written and recorded slowly and intermittently, and I have no idea when it’ll be done. Not for a while. I’m just enjoying the process. It is always great to work with Rod and Colin, we have been making up songs together since 1995 – not far off 20 years! Gareth and Allan have not been involved much so far due to both their other touring commitments, but they will be in time, as will others." [...] In January 2014 the band started recording their next studio effort and had two 'live' dates, one at Musicport. Through his blog Roddy Woomble revealed that Gareth Russell had left the band back in 2013 and Lucci Rossi had joined the band as new bassist.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{the eight}} players who had refused the {{contracts}} {{offered by the}} board, with former skipper Morris Ouma, Alfred Luseno and Nelson Odhiambo being late inclusions, asked their views to be heard, and despite the board granting them another chance, they finally took a firm stance against them. While Obanda, Shem and James Ngoche, Odhiambo, and Otieno were made renewed offers, while Ouma, Luseno, and Nelson had a three-month agreement till March 2012 subject to performance. If they could do something good, they could retain their spot in the team. Sears said of this debacle,"It's a shame that yet again some of these players have turned down their contracts but that is their choice. We met with these players as we promised we would, we listened to their views and made them offers that reflected what they wanted – an agreement that would run {{until the end of}} the contract year in May 2012 if they met certain performance criteria which all players have to meet. Perhaps the most disappointing aspect was that they refused to represent their teams in the East African Competitions last weekend pulling out at the very last minute.
