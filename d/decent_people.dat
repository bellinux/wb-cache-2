40|$|Rawls’ The Law of Peoples {{does not}} offer a clear principled account {{of the way in}} which liberal and <b>decent</b> <b>peoples</b> should deal with benevolent absolutisms. Within the Rawlsian framework, benevolent absolutisms are a type of society that respects basic human rights and is not {{externally}} aggressive. Rawls rules out the use of coercion to engage with benevolent absolutisms but does not provide an alternative strategy. The article develops one, namely, it argues that liberal and <b>decent</b> <b>peoples</b> should use positive incentives to induce benevolent absolutisms to make their transition to the status of well-ordered peoples. In so doing, it offers a principled way to expand Rawls’ international nonideal theory and, in the process, provides a more nuanced approach to the promotion of political participation in international society. The article draws on the literature on economic statecraft and political theory and constructs an incentive model with seven distinct parameters attached to its definition of incentives. Finally, the article provides a real-world example, of how to concretely implement the incentive mechanism...|$|R

5000|$|Although {{there were}} passing {{comments}} on international affairs in A Theory of Justice, it wasn't {{until late in}} his career that Rawls formulated a comprehensive theory of international politics {{with the publication of}} The Law of Peoples.

Rawls argued that the legitimacy of a liberal international order is contingent on tolerating <b>decent</b> <b>peoples,</b> which differ from liberal peoples, among other ways, in that they might have state religions and deny adherents of minority faiths the right to hold positions of power within the state, and might organize political participation via consultation hierarchies rather than elections.

500|$|This {{philosophy}} led Goldstone {{to issue}} rulings that undermined {{key aspects of}} the apartheid system. One of his most significant rulings concerned the Group Areas Act that mandated the eviction of non-whites from areas reserved for whites. His ruling {{in the case of}} S v Govender in 1982 that evictions of non-whites were not automatically required by the Act led to the virtual cessation of such evictions. Following the judgement it became so difficult to evict non-whites from whites-only areas that the system of housing segregation began to break down. Prosecutions under the Act fell from 893 between 1978–1981 to only one in 1983. Geoffrey Budlender, former director of the anti-apartheid Legal Resources Centre, commented of Goldstone's decision in the Govender case that [...] "it was an alert judge trying to apply human rights standards to a repressive piece of legislation.

40|$|Abstract: In The Law of Peoples, John Rawls {{offers an}} idea of {{international}} public reason that governs the relationship between liberal and <b>decent</b> <b>peoples.</b> This article begins by considering the relationship between liberal peoples and the form of public reason that they would deem acceptable. It ultimately argues {{that there is an}} international public reason that is common to minimally just states that is different from what would be found in the law of peoples. The applicability and content of this version of international public reason is governed by the possibility of states associating with one another in what I call an international friendship. Minimally just states would accept the importance of reasons for being attentive to how their actions can affect the just arrangements of other minimally just states. The reason of international friendship presents the possibility of competing international publics with their own form of reason...|$|R
40|$|After {{presenting}} a brief sketch of John Rawls’s theory of justice, his international political theory is outlined and evaluated. Rawls develops a classification of ‘peoples’ {{based on whether}} or not they are ‘well-ordered’. The Law of Peoples covers ‘liberal’ and ‘decent’ peoples who adhere to minimum standards of human rights and are not aggressive in their international relations. This is in the realm of ‘ideal’ theory; ‘non-ideal’ theory must cope also with societies that are not well-ordered, such as outlaw states and burdened societies. The long-term aim is that all should be part of a confederation of <b>decent</b> <b>peoples.</b> Rawls’s theory has been criticized by cosmopolitan liberals for its communitarian tendencies, but has much to offer scholars of international relations, including a systematic basis for classifying states, a helpful discussion of the distinction between reasonableness and rationality, and a powerful restatement of the importance of utopian thinking in international relations...|$|R

This time I proposed to settle affairs {{without the aid of}} soldiers or legations. It was a complete success. Every one of our dispossessed church-members has been reinstated and a money compensation made for his losses. This has been done by appealing to the sense of justice among the villages where our people lived and where they are respected by all <b>decent</b> <b>people.</b> The villagers were extremely grateful because I brought no foreign soldiers and were glad to settle on the terms proposed.

Sissinghurst had once been owned by Vita's ancestors, which gave it a dynastic attraction to her after her father had disinherit her from Knole and his title. There the couple created the famous gardens that are now run by the National Trust. One of Vita's male suitors was Henry Lascelles, who would later marry the Princess Royal and become the 6th Earl of Harewood. Vita Sackville-West also had a passionate affair between 1929 and 1931 with Hilda Matheson, head of the BBC Talks Department. She called Hilda by the pet name of [...] "Stoker" [...] during their liaison. In 1931, Sackville-West was in a ménage à trois with journalist Evelyn Irons, who had interviewed her after her novel The Edwardians was published and became a best-seller, and Irons's lover, Olive Rinder. Sackville-West's 1932 novel Family History {{is the first of}} her books to raise the subject of lesbianism, albeit in an oblique form where the 24-year old heroine Evelyn Jerrold has more than familial feelings of love for her teenage niece Ruth. Jerrold, ashamed of feelings for Ruth, tries to destroy them by marrying a man named Miles Vane-Merrick, who she accidentally destroys by demanding more and more from him as she cannot bring herself to admit to her love for Ruth or see that Vane-Merrick cannot be a substitute for Ruth. The characters of Viola and Leonard Anquetil in Family History who are socialists, pacifists and feminists are thinly veiled versions of Virginia and Leonard Woolf. In Orlando, Woolf allowed Sackville-West to finally [...] "own" [...] Knole, and in Family History, she returns the favor as the Anquetils have children who are intelligent and <b>decent</b> <b>people</b> whom any parent could be proud of. Woolf never had children and was afraid that she would have been a bad mother if she did, so Sackville-West, in having her fictional alter-ego be an excellent mother {{was meant to be a}} [...] "gift" [...] to Woolf. Though Sackville-West regarded Nicolson's involvement with Sir Oswald Mosley's New Party (soon to be renamed the British Union of Fascists) as [...] "unfortunate", an angry Woolf wrote her in August 1931: [...] "Potto [...] expiring. What about Harold and Mosley? But don't write if it hurts". In the 1930s, Woolf and Sackville-West clashed over the question of pacifism as Sackville-West supported rearmament while Woolf remained loyal to her pacifism, leading to an end of their relationship in 1935.|$|E
