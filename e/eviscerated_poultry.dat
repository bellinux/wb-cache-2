40|$|Radurization {{processing}} of fresh <b>eviscerated</b> <b>poultry</b> has been microbiologically studied. The recommended dose of 0. 5 Mrads extended the shelf life at 5 C by approximately 14 days. This treatment also effected a 10 and 11 log {{reduction in the}} number of viable Salmonella species and Staphylococcus aureus strains, respectively. Recycling these organisms at sublethal doses of irradiation resulted in strains possessing increased irradiation resistance. Shifts in the microbial ecology after irradiation and storage resulted, in some instances, in the isolation of organisms tentatively identified as Moraxella sp. and Herellea vaginicola...|$|E
40|$|Background and objectives: A {{number of}} {{different}} subtypes of avian influenza (AI) viruses have emerged in humans includ-ing H 5 N 1, H 7 N 2, H 7 N 7 and H 9 N 2. These influenza viruses are excreted in the infected birds and in their respiratory secre-tions. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate seropositivity against H 9 N 2 and H 7 N 7 viruses among poultry and slaughter-house workers with occupational risk of exposure to poultry in Tehran province. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional seroprevalence study was performed using two types of HI assay among 127 poultry and slaughter-house workers and 25 controls with the regular consumer related exposure to poultry against H 9 N 2 and H 7 N 7 avian influenza viruses. Data were analyzed using SAS 9. 1. Results: There was no evidence of previous H 7 N 7 infection among subjects. Both poultry workers had elevated antibod-ies against H 9 N 2 Influenza viruses compared to controls. Slaughter-house workers who self-reported <b>eviscerating</b> <b>poultry</b> with their bare hands had markedly increased evidence of previous H 9 N 2 infection (15. 7 %) compared to controls (0 %) (OR= 18. 241, 95 % CI ([6. 802 - 48. 914]). Conclusions: Our results suggest poultry-to-human transmission of avian influenza A H 9 N 2 can occur in <b>poultry</b> workers. <b>Eviscerating</b> section workers, in contrast to others had the highest risk of H 9 N 2 infection. It is emphasized that <b>eviscerating</b> sections of <b>poultry</b> work is the most contaminated part of poultry industry that could increase the likelihood of poultry-to-human transmission...|$|R
40|$|Partially-eviscerated (also {{described}} as effilé, effileé, roped, partly eviscerated, partially drawn, wire drawn or Boston drawn) poultry {{are produced by}} removing the intestines from the poultry carcass but leaving the heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, crop, proventriculus and gizzard inside the body cavity (as defined in Regulation (EC) 543 / 2008). Regulation (EC) 853 / 2004 allows production of partially-eviscerated poultry, provided it is authorised by the competent authority. The overall aim of this project was {{to carry out a}} risk assessment of partially-eviscerated (effilé) poultry production (poultry with the heart, liver, kidneys, crop, proventriculus and gizzard left inside the body cavity) with a view to considering whether the risks of partially-eviscerated poultry production can be managed to an acceptable level such that the practice could be authorised in the UK. To achieve this aim the project had four Objectives: Objective 1, an initial risk assessment of the public health implications of allowing partially-eviscerated birds into the food chain together with a review of all relevant and appropriate literature/company information relating to the control of partially-eviscerated poultry production; Objective 2, an industrial survey of current production of partially-eviscerated poultry; Objective 3, a series of short practical evaluations of any processes where further data was required; Objective 4, a full analysis of all the data and findings of Objectives 1 to 3 and the production of the final project report. The literature review found that documentation on the production of partially-eviscerated poultry was scarce and not comprehensive. However, it highlighted the important points for risk assessment and identified a reason for the development of partial-evisceration processing, i. e. the prevention of “greening” during storage due to the removal of the intestines. The review of current post-mortem inspection of poultry concluded that of the twenty one conditions that are currently looked for during post-mortem inspection of poultry, the majority of these conditions do not pose a risk to public health. Seven conditions were considered to be of concern to public health (Ascites/oedema, Cellulitis, Contamination, Hepatitis, Pericarditis, Perihepatitis/peritonitis, Respiratory disease (airsacculitis)). It was concluded that only four of those seven conditions (hepatitis, pericarditis, perihepatitis/peritonitis, and respiratory disease (air sacculitis)) may not be identified during post-mortem inspection of partially-eviscerated poultry. Their public health significance was considered to be as indicators of the presence of enteric microbial pathogens rather than any inherent pathology of the conditions. Data on condemnations show that the rates of condemnations for these conditions are very low. In addition, these conditions should be clearly identifiable by the end user of the poultry during preparation of the carcass for cooking. Therefore, in our opinion, {{it is unlikely that the}} consumer would ingest such infected viscera. Four French plants and two UK plants were visited during the industrial survey. Although there was a commonality in the practices employed at all of the plants, differences were found between the plants, particularly in the specific method used to remove the intestines from the carcasses in order to produce the product. Four main methods have been identified that can be used to partially <b>eviscerate</b> <b>poultry,</b> three are manual, one is mechanical. The only UK plant currently producing partially-eviscerated poultry, skinned the whole carcass with its feathers on. Partially-eviscerated (effilé) poultry report 3 of 166 Due to the lack of data on the microbiological quality of partially-eviscerated poultry a series of short targeted experimental evaluations were carried out to: (1) investigate the difference in chilling time between partially-eviscerated and eviscerated broiler carcasses; (2) investigate any difference between the growth of microorganisms on partially-eviscerated and eviscerated broiler carcasses during chilled storage; (3) investigate the growth of microorganisms in the organs of partially-eviscerated broiler carcasses during chilled storage. These studies showed: (1) due to the presence of warm internal organs partially-eviscerated poultry carcasses are warmer than eviscerated carcasses at the start of chilling and the rate of cooling of partially-eviscerated poultry carcasses is slower than that of similar eviscerated carcasses; (2) there was no significant difference between the microbiological quality of partially-eviscerated and eviscerated broiler carcasses after chilling and during chilled storage; (3) ACC, Pseudomonas, Enterobacteriaceae, coliform and Escherichia coli counts were all shown to be capable of increasing in/on the heart, crop, feet, gizzard, cavity, skin and liver of partially-eviscerated broiler carcasses after chilling and during chilled storage. A critical review of all available relevant and appropriate literature and data was carried out, supplemented by a survey of current industrial practice and a practical evaluation of processes, to form a risk assessment of the public health implications of allowing partially-eviscerated birds into the food chain. This risk assessment considered: 1. What abnormalities may not be identified in partially-eviscerated poultry production when compared to traditional poultry production; 2. Whether the risk of zoonotic pathogens are any greater for partially-eviscerated poultry production when compared to traditional poultry production; 3. The aetiology of those conditions; 4. The public health implications of those conditions and of allowing partially-eviscerated poultry into the food supply...|$|R
