40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the findings of}} thermal comfort assessment at Malaysian automotive industry. Nine critical workstations were chosen as subjects for the study {{in order to determine}} the thermal comfort among workers at Malaysian automotive industry. The human subjects for the study comprises of the operators from tire receiving, dashboard assembly, drum tester, body assembly, seat assembly, <b>door</b> <b>check</b> assembly, stamping workstation, engine sub assembly and paint shop of the factory. The environmental factors such as Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT), relative humidity, air velocity, illuminance were measured using BABUC A apparatus and Thermal Comfort Measurement equipment. Through questionnaire survey, the demographic data of subjects and their perceptions on thermal comfort at each workstation were assessed based on ISO Standard 7730 and thermal sensation scale using Predicted Mean Vote (PMV). Then, Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied (PPD) is used to estimate the thermal satisfaction of occupants. The results indicated that most of the workstations of the automotive industry are considered as uncomfortable. Tire receiving station is considered having better working environment compared to other stations with lowest PMV index of 1. 09 to 1. 41 and PPD of 46 %. Meanwhile, the engine sub assembly station and paint shop of assembly are considered the worst thermal environment with the PMV index values ranging between 2. 1 to 2. 9 and PPD values of 81 % to 99 %. Therefore, these two workstations are considered not comfortable because the thermal sensation scale is warm and almost hot...|$|E
40|$|The Theoretical and Applied Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (TAFLab) at the University of California, Berkeley is {{investigating}} several designs for novel shallow water wave energy converters. The common denominator for these prototypes {{is that they}} operate with a hydraulic power takeoff (PTO) for the secondary power conversion. A critical component of an hydraulic PTO is one or more check valves creating a unidirectional flow. The research goal of this thesis is the flow optimization of these components. Turbulence in the check valves {{was assumed to be}} a major cause for efficiency losses in the current PTO design. Computer Aided Design (CAD) and rapid prototyping through Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) were selected as prototyping tools, due to the high customizability and short lead time of components. Experimental analysis and fluid simulations were used to compare and verify the performance of the optimized check valve designs. One of the performance measures for check valves is the head loss coefficient Kv, which is desired to be low in the flow direction, and high in the reverse direction. We observed that the original check valve had a KvD = 57. 2 +- 1. 0 in the flow direction and no flow in the reverse direction (KvR = inf). A minor modification improved KvD to 46. 1 +- 0. 9 in the flow direction but decreased KvR = 8. 7 +- 1. 7. 10 E 7 in the reverse direction. The first double door design brought KvD down to 6. 4 +- 0. 5, but with a reverse loss coefficient of 738 +- 11. The final double <b>door</b> <b>check</b> valve had a KvD of 8. 4 +- 0. 5 in the flow direction and KvR = 1. 4 +- 0. 3. 10 E 6 in the reverse direction, and was selected for a dynamic test. In a direct application in a pumping setup, we however observed an efficiency decrease from 41. 3 +- 0. 5 % to 24. 7 +- 0. 5 %, possibly explained by the closing speeds of the new valve. It is concluded that optimizing losses in a steady state flow experiment cannot guarantee improved results in pulsating or alternating flow...|$|E

In a very controversial but effective move, the protesters went <b>door</b> to <b>door</b> <b>checking</b> everyone's pots and pans to ensure that no one was secretly buying meat. Anyone who was caught with meat was ridiculed and labeled a “scab.” These tactics proved to be very effective. Almost all purchases of kosher meats ceased. While the patrols went on, other boycott members worked around the clock to disseminate flyers and circulars in order to bolster support. One such circular read: “Eat no meat while the Trust is taking meat from the bones of your women and children.” Women vigilantes went as far as to rob butcher shops and rid them of their meat. The women involved in the protests also started a fundraising campaign to bail out imprisoned boycotters.|$|R
