40|$|Aggregate {{shape is}} a key {{parameter}} that influences mixtures properties. This paper accounts for a closely controlled experimental program aimed at clarifying the variation of aggregate shape with two parameters, gyratory crusher setting and feed grading. The results show that crusher setting has a significant influence on the <b>flakiness</b> <b>index</b> of produced elementary size fractions, {{which is not the}} case for spread size fractions. Moreover, a variation of the proportions of feed fraction constituents has no significant influence on the <b>flakiness</b> <b>index</b> of produced aggregates, whereas a variation of the spreading or size of the feed fraction has. Regarding the shape characteristics of particles, it has been observed that the dimensions of a particle were not related, but flat particles are elongated, and vice versa. Finally, it has been observed that <b>flakiness</b> <b>index</b> varies conversely with the size of produced aggregate...|$|E
40|$|By {{the method}} of {{laboratory}} experiments, this study evaluates the effect of elongation and <b>flakiness</b> <b>index</b> of coarse aggregate and impurity of fine aggregate to concrete properties through slump index and compressive strength of concrete mixture. From the type of selected materials, component of the concrete mixture was designed by the theoretical and empirical methods. Elongation and <b>flakiness</b> <b>index</b> of coarse aggregate (with 0 %, 5 %, 10 %, 15 %, 20 % and 25 %) and impurity of fine aggregate (with 0 %, 2 %, 4 %, 6 %, 8 % and 10 %) were adjusted while the amount of stone, sand, cement and water weer kept unchange. Subsequently slump index and compressive strength of concrete were determined. The result shows that, the effect to concrete property is clearly noticeable. The elongation and <b>flakiness</b> <b>index</b> were maintained below 4 % of impurity. If these limits are exceeded, the specification of concrete would not be satisfied...|$|E
40|$|Aggregates {{are one of}} {{the primary}} {{building}} material used in the world. The durability of construction aggregates will therefore depend upon the quality of aggregate mechanical properties. It is therefore important to understand how particle shape will effect mechanical properties of aggregates, measured by the Los Angeles and micro-Deval values. In order to assess the influence of particle shape on aggregate mechanical properties, the proportion of flaky and cubic particles, measured by the <b>flakiness</b> <b>index</b> (FI), was artificially varied in a series of tests for six different rock types. All in all 69 Los Angeles and 69 micro-Deval tests were performed according to European standards. The main findings are that the standard Los Angeles (LA) and micro-Deval (MD) test methods which measure the amounts of fines (< 1. 6 mm) produced by impact and/or wear are generally not sensitive to variations in the <b>flakiness</b> <b>index</b> (FI). The LAx and MDx values, which are measured by the amounts of material passing the lower fraction of the size range, are more sensitive to variations in the <b>flakiness</b> <b>index</b> (FI). Sieve analysis also shows that the standard LA and MD method of measuring production of fines is not always a good indicator of aggregate breakdown and may in some cases ignore increased breakdown of the aggregate coarser than 1. 6 mm. The LAx and MDx values better demonstrate the behavior of the aggregate coarser than 1. 6 mm and give better information about the extent of aggregate breakdown...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{recycled}} concrete aggregates in Portland cement concrete and granular road base or sub-base works has increased steadily {{all over the}} world in order to conserve the limited natural aggregate deposits. The recycling of the demolished concrete aggregate for the use in concrete or granular pavement works will not only help to protect the environment but also an economical benefit to the user. The main drawback for the bulk utilization of demolished or recycled aggregate is its characterization and proper quality control during its production. The overall objective of this research was to characterize recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) obtained from a demolished foundation structure and to determine its suitability for Portland Cement Concrete (PCC) works and use as a granular road base or sub-base material. Tests were carried out on RCA samples to determine whether it meets the specification for concrete aggregate material or a granular road base and sub-base materials. Several concrete mixes consisting of 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, and 80 % replacement of natural coarse aggregates (NCA) with RCA were prepared and tested for compressive strength after curing periods of 7, 14, and 28 days. The compressive strength of concrete made with various percentages of RCA decreased with increasing RCA content but it increased with curing period for all concrete mixes. The durability parameters of the natural aggregates and RCA samples were investigated by using sulfate soundness, rapid freeze-thaw and micro-deval tests to ascertain their chemical and abrasive resistance. The California Bearing Ratio (CBR) of RCA base was also compared with that of a natural road base material to determine its suitability for road base or sub-base works. In this study, the <b>flakiness</b> and elongation <b>indices</b> of the RCA were found to be better than that of conventional natural aggregates. The RCA base material had lower maximum dry density, higher optimum moisture content, and low California Bearing Ratio (CBR) value compared to the natural crushed rock base (NCRB) material but was found to be a relatively good road base material...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the results of the study}} conducted on the “Geoengineering characterization of volcanic rocks from Ethiopian and Sardinian highlands to be used as construction materials”. Though, the two project areas are geographically far apart, both are partly covered with volcanic rocks mainly consisting of basic and subordinate felsic rocks. The research was conducted in two countries; part I, the Ethiopian Project area located on the northwestern central Highlands of the Amhara regional state. It is characterized by rugged topography being situated on the western margin of the Main Ethiopian Rift, while, Part II, the Sardinian Project area, is located in the northwestern central part of the Island stretched from Abbasanta-Borore on the Altopiano di Abbasanta. The major objectives of the study in both project areas include; a) engineering geological characterization of the volcanic rocks of Sardinian (Abbasanta-Borore area) and Ethiopian highland (Tarmaber formation) to be used as construction materials b) assessing the volcanic rocks for their suitability to be used as building stone and coarse aggregates/construction materials with regard to the various time honoured standards and specifications like American Society for Testing and Materials(ASTM), British Standards(BS), American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), Ente Nazionale Italiano di Unificazione (UNIEN) c) presenting a conceptual framework which puts forward a vision for future crushed aggregate characterization of the Tarmaber formation, d) evaluation and comparison of the physical and mechanical properties of the Sardinian highland Plio- Quaternary basalt with that of Ethiopian Tarmaber formation(basalt). The field work in the Ethiopian study area was accomplished in two phases, the first field work was conducted during the months of February and July, 2011 and the second was in February and September, 2012, while the Sardinian project field work was carried out during May and June, 2012. In all these field work periods geological traverses, field documentations and adequate samples were collected for the various laboratory tests in both project areas. Laboratory testing of chemical, physical and mechanical properties were carried out to characterize the volcanic rocks from both study areas to ascertain the suitability of the rocks as construction materials. iv Geologically, the Ethiopian study area is part of the Miocene Shield volcanic terrain that covered the western and north western central plateaux of Ethiopia forming a conspicuous land feature in East Africa. The studied area is specifically covered with the Tarmaber formation (Megezez subdivision) consisting of aphyric basalt, phyric basalt, trachybasalt, ignimbrite/rhyolite, tuff and minor trachyte. Thorough literature review has been conducted on volcanic rocks as construction materials and from the compiled information a laboratory testing program was envisaged and conducted on the samples collected from the studied areas. Selection of the tests was based upon the tests’ precision, efficiency, and predictive capabilities and relevancy for the specific geographic location and geologic formation. In the laboratory testing phase of this project, the proposed tests were used to evaluate the full range of the project area crushed aggregate resources. Moreover, a conceptual laboratory test flow diagram is developed for future aggregate characterization of the Ethiopian project area. Furthermore, a geological map is prepared outlining the various lithotypes which could help to predict the geo-engineering properties of the rocks by identifying the rock types. The Ethiopian project area is the major source and future potential of crushed coarse aggregates by both private and public sectors. This study has identified recent advances in the understanding and testing of crushed aggregates to be produced from the Tarmaber formation (Megezez subdivision). The geo-engineering properties depend on the mineral composition, texture and overall fabrics of the rock. Each of the rock type crushed aggregate demonstrates rather well defined ranges of geo-engineering properties and mineralogical characteristics. The laboratory work included Uniaxial Compressive Strength, Abrasion resistance, Ultrasonic pulse velocity, Bulk density, Water absorption, Specific gravity, Porosity, Petrographic examination, Aggregate Impact Value (AIV), Aggregate Crushing Value (ACV), Los Angeles Abrasion Value (LAAV), Sodium Sulphate Soundness Value (SSSV), X-ray Diffraction(XRD) and Alkali-Silica Reactivity(ASR), Water soluble Sulphate and Chloride tests. The physical and mechanical properties like Water absorption, <b>Flakiness</b> and Elongation <b>indices,</b> and Specific gravity, strength and durability parameters have been determined and examined critically with reference to suitability and stability, taking into consideration the various specifications and time honoured standards. Hence, based on the geo-engineering and petrographic properties, optimal end uses of the different rock types have also been discussed even though the current study is mainly geared towards crushed aggregate sources for cement and asphalt concrete mix. The field and laboratory works were compiled and compared together to reveal the engineering performance of the basaltic rocks in terms of crushed coarse aggregates suitability. The basaltic rocks show a variety of textural and mineralogical characteristics, which may affect their physical and mechanical properties as well as their use as construction materials. The Uniaxial compressive strength of the basaltic rock ranges from 130 MPa to 350 MPa, Ultrasonic pulse velocity from 4000 m/s to 7000 m/s, Open porosity from 0. 95...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSES: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to evaluate the effect of physical characteristics of emulsion asphalt and aggregate on performance of chip seal pavements. METHODS: In order to evaluate the performance of chip seal materials, the sweep tests and Vialit Plate Shock tests were conducted on the mixtures with five emulsion asphalt binders and three aggregate types. The sweep tests was intended to investigate the change of bonding properties between emulsion asphalt and aggregate with curing time. The Vialit Plate Shock test was used to evaluate the bonding properties of chip seal materials at low temperatures. RESULTS:Results from sweep tests showed that polymer modified emulsion asphalt can reduce the curing time by 1. 5 hour comparing with typical emulsion asphalt. It is also found that the <b>Flakiness</b> <b>Index</b> of aggregates and absorption rate of binder are the major factors affecting the bonding properties of chip seal materials. The Vialit Plate Shock test results showed that the average aggregate loss of CRS- 2 is ten times higher than CRS- 2 P No. 2 indicating that the use of polymer additives in emulsion asphalt can improve the performance of chip seal materials in low temperature region. CONCLUSIONS: The use of polymer in emulsion asphalt can decrease the curing time of chip seal materials and increase the bonding properties between aggregates and asphalt binder. It is also concluded that the lower <b>Flakiness</b> <b>Index</b> and absorption rate of aggregates ca...|$|E

40|$|Bioretention {{systems are}} {{increasingly}} being used in urban stormwater management systems, whereas quarry materials are used as filter media; however the use of quarry materials in this application reduces valuable natural resources. Such a novel approach of using recycled waste materials would significantly conserve valuable natural resources. A series of laboratory tests included particle size distribution, organic content, pH, specific gravity, <b>flakiness</b> <b>index</b> and hydraulic conductivity. Among the pollutants, total suspended solid (TSS), total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) were selected. A model for bioretention system was simulated to investigate the effectiveness of reclaimed asphalt material (RAP) and crushed brick (CB) materials in trapping selected pollutants. In terms of physical and chemical properties, RAP and CB were found to meet the stringent requirements of various environmental protection authorities.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a recent investigation on the performance of four recycled concrete aggregates (RCAs). The materials, obtained by crushing concrete with compressive strength ranging from 15 MPa to 75 MPa, were reconstituted to satisfy the grading requirements for a subbase material. Triaxial specimens were tested under repeated loading one day after compaction. It appears that the original concrete compressive strength, the amount of softer material in the RCA, and the <b>flakiness</b> <b>index</b> of the RCA can significantly affect the resilient modulus. Degradation is mostly related to the crushing of softer and flaky materials within the aggregate matrix. In this regard, the Ten Percent Fines test is suitable as an evaluation test as it does not impose an excessive force on the RCA. The overall results indicated that RCA may be utilized as a subbase or base course material if it can be produced to consistently meet product quality standards...|$|E
40|$|Construction and {{demolition}} waste (CDW) constitutes an increasingly significant problem in society {{due to the}} volume generated, rendering sustainable management and disposal problematic. The {{aim of this study}} is to identify a possible reuse option in the concrete manufacturing for recycled aggregates with a significant ceramic content: mixed recycled aggregates (MixRA) and ceramic recycled aggregates (CerRA). In order to do so, several tests are conducted in accordance with the Spanish Code on Structural Concrete (EHE- 08) to determine the composition in weight and physic-mechanical characteristics (particle size distributions, fine content, sand equivalent, density, water absorption, <b>flakiness</b> <b>index,</b> and resistance to fragmentation) of the samples for the partial inclusion of the recycled aggregates in concrete mixes. The results of these tests clearly support the hypothesis that this type of material may be suitable for such partial replacements if simple pretreatment is carried out. Furthermore, this measure of reuse is in line with European, national, and regional policies on sustainable development, and presents a solution to the environmental problem caused by the generation of CDW...|$|E

Some of the benefits {{of limestone}} include good strength, low possibility of alkali-silica reaction and the decrease in drying shrinkage in concrete.

The aim of this research is to observe, evaluate, compare and discuss general characteristics of the limestone aggregate in the northern part of Sri Lanka and check the suitability of the limestone as coarse aggregates in concrete. There are two different kinds of limestone there, namely Red limestone and white limestone. Then experiments are conducted for both kinds of limestone together with the normal coarse aggregates.

Ereğli and Ormanlı, westside of Zonguldak. Volcanics, described as andesite, basaltic andesite and trachy-andesite by petrographically and geochemically, have subduction zone calk-alkaline character. Firstly, in laboratuary studies the aggregate tests (grading, specific gravity, water absorption, organic impurity, <b>flakiness</b> <b>index,</b> Los Angeles test for resistance to wear, peeling test, freezing resistance and UCS were realized on the 5 selected fresh patterns, match with the standarts (TS, ASTM, AASHO).

40|$|The {{grading curve}} of an {{aggregate}} {{is a fundamental}} characteristic for mix design that can easily be modified to adjust several mix properties. While sieve analysis remains the reference method to determine this curve, optical devices are developing, allowing easier and faster assessment of aggregate grading. Unfortunately, optical grading results significantly differ from sieve grading curves. As a consequence, getting full acceptance of these new methods requires building bridges between the various particle size measurement systems. In order to build the sieve grading curve of an aggregate sample from video image analysis, a new model using images captured by a single camera device has been developed. This model has been tested on different samples stemming from four quarries with various petrography and <b>flakiness</b> <b>index.</b> For the 10 / 12. 5, 12. 5 / 16, 10 / 16 and 10 / 25 size fractions, the difference between actual sieve grading curve and optical grading curve is smaller than 7 %.

40|$|Roads and railroads are {{important}} and essential transport systems for our everyday life. It is important to continue the development to create greater understanding of how these constructions are affected by degradation to not build long life constructions that are not fulfilling tomorrow’s changed demands. In constructions consisting of aggregates degradation caused by external loads is described by effects like changed properties of the soil mass. One {{step in the right}} direction when it comes to better understanding degradation is to describe the grain shape changes that occur. A number of grain shape describing variables are presented: soliditycircularity, aspect ratio, roundness and. These are measured with two dimensional digital image processing (DIP). The degradation is simulated by the material quality tests Los Angeles and micro Deval tests. A great number of grains from their samples are analyzed before and after the tests to compare the change of the grain shape. The results are analyzed to find the change of the grain shape and differences of the grain shape change of the two tests. The Los Angeles samples show a significant decrease in size indicating that fragmentation is the degradation mode. The samples also to some extent show more circular grains after testing. The micro Deval samples show smaller grains, but not to the same extent as for the Los Angeles samples. The micro Deval samples also show that the grains are more even and circular indicating the grains are exposed to wearing. These results verify the degradation modes for the micro Deval and Los Angeles tests. The data is also analyzed with factor analysis to identify connections between the measured variables’ results. A clear connection can be seen for Los Angeles and micro Deval tests both before and after testing. Circularity and solidity are varying alike and represents a shape factor, measuring a grain’s shape in two scales. Another analysis was completed for <b>flakiness</b> <b>index</b> to explore if there is a way to perform a similar grain shape test with two dimensional digital image processing. There is a great difference between the results from the laboratory test and the DIP. This is because of the fact that only two dimensions are identified with the DIP, and the data collected from the DIP does not represent the data from the <b>flakiness</b> <b>index</b> test. That one dimension is not identified with the two dimensional DIP can also affect the grain shape results. Despite this, it is possible that the great number of analyzed grains can counter this effect. Further investigation is necessary to verify this.

40|$|Pavement layers are {{constructed}} {{using a combination of}} materials, of which rock aggregates constitute a larger proportion. Current understanding is that the performance of pavements is dependent on the aggregate shape properties which include form, angularity and surface texture. However, direct and accurate measurements of aggregate shape properties remain a challenge. The current standard test methods used to evaluate aggregate shape properties cannot measure these properties accurately. Among the reasons contributing to the difficulties in the determination of aggregate shape properties is irregular shapes of aggregate particles. Therefore, current research efforts focus on developing accurate, reliable and innovative techniques for evaluation of aggregate shape properties. The work presented in this dissertation contributes to the current innovative research at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) in South Africa, to automate the measurement of aggregate shape properties. The CSIR’s present research is aimed at improving pavement performance through better materials characterisation, using laser scanning and advanced modelling techniques. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate improved techniques for the determination of aggregate shape properties using analytical and laser scanning techniques. A three-dimensional (3 -D) laser scanning device was used for scanning six types of aggregate samples commonly used for construction of pavements in South Africa. The laser scan data were processed to reconstruct 3 -D models of the aggregate particles. The models were further analysed to determine the shape properties of the aggregates. Two analysis approaches were used in this study. The first approach used the aggregate’s physical properties (surface area, volume and orthogonal dimensions) measured by using laser scanning technique to compute three different indices to describe the form of aggregates. The computed indices were the sphericity computed by using surface area and volume of an aggregate particle, the sphericity computed by using orthogonal dimensions of an aggregate particle, and the flat and elongated ratio computed by using longest and smallest dimensions of an aggregate particle. The second approach employed a spherical harmonic analysis technique to analyse the aggregate laser scan data to determine aggregate form, angularity and surface texture indices. A MATLABTM code was developed for analysis of laser scan data, using the spherical harmonic analysis technique. The analyses contained in this dissertation indicate that the laser-based aggregate shape indices were able to describe the shape properties of the aggregates studied. Furthermore, good correlations were observed between the spherical harmonic form indices and the form indices determined by using the aggregate’s physical properties. This shows that aggregate laser scanning is a versatile technique for the determination of various indices to describe aggregate shape properties. Further validation of the laser-based technique was achieved by correlating the laser-based aggregate form indices with the results from two current standard tests; the <b>flakiness</b> <b>index</b> and the flat and elongated particles ratio tests. The laser-based form indices correlated linearly with both, the <b>flakiness</b> <b>index</b> and the flat and elongated particles ratio test results. The observed correlations provide an indication of the validity of laser-based aggregate shape indices. It is concluded that the laser based scanning technique could be employed for direct and accurate determination of aggregate shape properties.

The escalating rate in the quantity and type of waste materials, shortage of landfill spaces and lack of virgin materials imposes pressure on finding innovative ways of recycling and reusing waste materials. Recycling and the subsequent reuse of waste materials will also reduce the demand for virgin natural resources which consequently leads to less energy usage, lower greenhouse gas emissions and ultimately a more sustainable environment. Recycled glass is a waste material produced in large amounts in municipal and industrial areas worldwide. Recycled glass {{is a mixture of}} different colored glass particles which consists {{of a wide range of}} debris (mainly paper, plastic, gravel, food remaining and metals). The presence of different colored glass and diverse types of debris are the primary obstacles in reusing recycled glass in bottle production industries. Alternative ways of reusing recycled glass has been investigated in recent years. The production process and the crushing procedure of recycled glass play a major role on its maximum particle size, debris level and <b>flakiness</b> <b>index</b> which consequently affect its geotechnical characteristics.

Swedish stone producers must have accurate knowledge of available products throughout the year in order to provide customers appropriate requirements at the time of need. One difficulty in carrying stock piles of bulk stone products is allowing for variants, such as wind wastage, and water absorbing which have a direct effect on the tonnage available. Customers who order in bulk need to know the dry weight cost {{in order to get the}} correct value of material, and in the case of concrete suppliers, for instance, controlled mixing of their final product. Where volume purchases are the norm, the transport required must know the weight/volume to be safe and legal. The overall requirements then for a successful stone quarrying business are varied; in order to provide a service the range of products must fulfil the needs of customers, be able to control or understand the variations that affect their products as mentioned previously, the impact on density of particle size/density, H 2 O content, <b>flakiness</b> <b>index</b> and screening curve. Also the variations that take place when paper calculations differ from physical checks on stockpiles. In order to remain profitable and, successful, control of these factors will enable any stone quarrying enterprise to go forward successfully.

The C&D materials tested were Recycled Concrete Aggregate (RCA), Crushed Brick (CB), Waste Rock (WR), Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP) and Fine Recycled Glass (FRG). The geotechnical assessment included particle size distribution, particle density, water absorption, compaction, Los Angeles abrasion, post-compaction sieve analysis, <b>flakiness</b> <b>index,</b> hydraulic conductivity and California Bearing Ratio (CBR) tests. Shear strength properties of the materials were studied {{through a series of}} triaxial tests. Consolidated drained triaxial tests undertaken on the recycled materials indicated that the recycled materials had a drained cohesion ranging from 41 kPa to 46 kPa and a drained friction angle ranging from 49 ° to 51 °, with the exception of FRG and RAP. The response of the materials under repeated load was investigated using repeated load triaxial (RLT) tests. The RLT testing results indicated that RCA, WR and CB performed satisfactorily at 98 % maximum dry density and at a target moisture content of 70 % of the optimum moisture content under modified compaction. The geoenvironmental assessment included pH value, organic content, total and leachate concentration of the material for a range of contaminant constituents. In terms of usage in pavement subbases, RCA and WR were found to have geotechnical engineering properties equivalent or superior to that of typical quarry granular subbase materials. CB at the lower target moisture contents of 70 % of the OMC was also found to meet the requirements of typical quarry granular subbase materials.

40|$|The use of {{demolition}} waste as pavement base material is a promising but unproven technique for road rehabilitation and construction. A {{survey was conducted}} by Building Economics Department of University of Moratuwa found that {{demolition waste}} is infrequently used in this application due primarily {{to a lack of}} practical knowledge about the engineering properties of the material. Therefore, this research was aimed at evaluating the physical properties, strength parameters, and durability characteristics of demolition waste to use as pavement base material. The study included extensive laboratory and prototype model testing. Laboratory tests included <b>flakiness</b> <b>index</b> value, elongation index, aggregate impact value, Los Angeles abrasion value test, California bearing ratio, unconfined compressive strength and durability evaluations. Prototype modeling was utilized to compare demolition waste with respect to general base materials. It included a plate load test and dynamic cone penetrometer. The prototype model demonstrated that the demolition waste base layer was susceptible to stiffness changes due primarily to changes in moisture. Prototype model results have been verified using ‘Everstress’ back-calculation software and it can be shown that the layer coefficient of CCM is equivalent to 0. 134. And also this material shows a very high variability with respect to conventional base materials i. e. DGAB. Therefore it is recommended to use this material as a base material for a traffic load of 20 kN or less. And it will perform a strong correlation as given in design charts & tables. Finally it was possible to evaluate a structural capacity of demolition waste and develop a design chart to replace dense graded aggregate base course from demolition waste base layer for construction of roads. Therefore it is recommended to introduce demolition waste material instead of conventional base material based on the developed design guidelines...|$|E
40|$|Road {{networks}} are increasingly expanding {{all over the}} world. The construction and maintenance of the road pavements require large amounts of aggregates. Considerable usage of various natural aggregates for constructing roads {{as well as the}} increasing rate at which solid waste is generated have attracted the attention of many researchers in the pavement industry to investigate the feasibility of the application of some of the waste materials as alternative materials in pavement construction. Among various waste materials, construction and demolition wastes, including Recycled Construction Aggregate (RCA) constitute {{a major part of the}} municipal solid wastes in Australia. Creating opportunities for the application of RCA in civil and geotechnical engineering applications is an efficient way to increase the market value of RCA. However, in spite of such promising potentials, insufficient and inconclusive data and information on the engineering properties of RCA had limited the reliability and design specifications of RCA to date. In light of this, this paper, as a first step of a comprehensive research, aims to investigate the feasibility of the application of RCA obtained from construction and demolition wastes for the replacement of part of coarse aggregates in asphalt mixture. As the suitability of aggregates for using in asphalt mixtures is determined based on the aggregate characteristics, including physical and mechanical properties of the aggregates, an experimental program is set up to evaluate the physical and mechanical properties of RCA. This laboratory investigation included the measurement of compressive strength and workability of RCA, particle shape, water absorption, <b>flakiness</b> <b>index,</b> crushing value, deleterious materials and weak particles, wet/dry strength variation, and particle density.
