5|$|With the {{increase}} of tea's use in Chinese <b>herbology,</b> production methods changed, where the processed green tea leaves were not immediately dried after steaming. Rather the steamed tea leaves were first pulverized into a paste form, with the paste then formed in moulds and slowly dried into brick tea, a technique well described by Lu Yu in his work The Classic of Tea. Tender leaves and leaf buds were generally not used, as older mature tea leaves were preferred for tea production. Some tea bricks were also produced from mature whole leaves, which typically required {{the use of a}} cooked rice slurry (米湯) to bind the tea brick together. The preference of producing tea in brick form possibly {{stems from the fact that}} it can be more easily transported and stored.|$|E
5|$|In his Essential Medical Treasures of the Golden Chamber (Jinkui yaolue), Zhang Zhongjing (c. 150– c. 219 CE) was {{the first}} to suggest a {{regulated}} diet rich in certain vitamins could prevent different types of disease, an idea which led Hu Sihui (fl. 1314–1330 CE) to prescribe a diet rich in Vitamin B1 as a treatment for beriberi. Zhang's major work was the Treatise on Cold Injury and Miscellaneous Disorders (Shanghan zabing lun). His contemporary and alleged associate Hua Tuo (d. 208 CE) was a physician who had studied the Huangdi neijing and became knowledgeable in Chinese <b>herbology.</b> Hua Tuo used anesthesia on patients during surgery and created an ointment that was meant to fully heal surgery wounds within a month. In one diagnosis of an ill woman, he deciphered that she bore a dead fetus within her womb which he then removed, curing her of her ailments.|$|E

25|$|Traditional Vietnamese {{medicine}} (Y học Cổ truyền Việt Nam), {{also known}} as Southern <b>Herbology</b> (Thuốc Nam) is a traditional medicine practiced by Vietnamese people. It is influenced by traditional Chinese medicine. The other traditional medicine that is also practiced in Vietnam is traditional Chinese medicine (Trung Y), {{also known as}} Northern <b>Herbology</b> (Thuốc Bắc). Thuốc Nam {{is one of two}} kinds of folk remedies known to villagers, the other being the traditional exercise dưỡng sinh.|$|E
25|$|Hufflepuff values hard work, patience, justice, and loyalty. The house mascot is the badger, and canary {{yellow and}} black are its colours. The Head {{of this house}} is the <b>Herbology</b> teacher Pomona Sprout, and the house ghost is The Fat Friar. According to Rowling, Hufflepuff {{corresponds}} roughly to the element of earth. The founder of this house is Helga Hufflepuff.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to its culinary use, red yeast rice is also used in Chinese <b>herbology</b> and traditional Chinese medicine. Its use has been documented {{as far back as}} the Tang Dynasty in China in 800 AD. It is taken internally to invigorate the body, aid in digestion, and revitalize the blood. A more complete description is in the traditional Chinese pharmacopoeia, Ben Cao Gang Mu-Dan Shi Bu Yi, from the Ming Dynasty (1378–1644).|$|E
25|$|In Deathly Hallows, she chases Snape {{away from}} Hogwarts with Professors McGonagall and Flitwick. Informed that Voldemort and his Death Eaters {{are coming to}} besiege Hogwarts, she uses her {{knowledge}} of magical plants by improvising offensive botany, and, {{with the help of}} several students, throws Mandrakes, Snargaluff pods, and Venomous Tentaculas off the castle walls at the approaching Death Eaters. The epilogue of Deathly Hallows reveals that Neville has become the new <b>Herbology</b> teacher at Hogwarts. The circumstances of Sprout's departure from the job are not revealed.|$|E
25|$|Pomona Sprout is Professor of <b>Herbology</b> and the Head of Hufflepuff House. She is {{described}} as a dumpy little witch with flyaway grey hair who wears a patched, frayed hat and shabby robes, often covered in dirt due to the time she spends tending plants in the Hogwarts greenhouses. Sprout is introduced in Philosopher's Stone, but she plays no active role until Chamber of Secrets, in which she teaches her second year students to work with Mandrake plants. She is responsible for raising the Mandrakes to full maturity, at which point their juice is used to revive the petrified victims of the basilisk.|$|E
25|$|An Auror is an {{employee}} of the Ministry whose mission is to pursue and apprehend Dark wizards. According to Minerva McGonagall, the Auror Office takes in new recruits with a minimum of 5 N.E.W.T.s (with marks no lower than “Exceeds Expectations”). She suggests that Potions, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, Charms, and <b>Herbology</b> N.E.W.T.s are the most appropriate for someone who aspires to be admitted to the training program. (A potential recruit will also have to pass “...a series of character and aptitude tests.”) Nymphadora Tonks mentions that two of the program’s courses of study are “Concealment and Disguise” and “Stealth and Tracking”, and that the training is hard to pass with high marks (a requirement).|$|E
25|$|Hartmann {{began his}} {{business}} {{career in the}} early 1970s while in his 20s, co-founding The Woodley Herber Company. Woodley Herber sold herbal products, potpourris and teas, and operated until 1978. It was during this time that Hartmann obtained three degrees in <b>herbology</b> and homeopathic medicine. Hartmann then moved to New Hampshire to start The New England Salem Children's Village, which still operates in Rumney, New Hampshire. He was its Executive Director for five years, and {{on the board of}} directors for more than 25 years. NESCT's child-care model was based on that of the German Salem International organization, and through his affiliation with that group he helped start international relief programs in Uganda, Colombia, Russia, Israel, India, Australia, and several other countries between 1979 and today.|$|E
25|$|Marcellus Empiricus, {{also known}} as Marcellus Burdigalensis (“Marcellus of Bordeaux”), was a Latin medical writer from Gaul {{at the turn of}} the 4th and 5th centuries. His only extant work is the De medicamentis, a {{compendium}} of pharmacological preparations drawing on the work of multiple medical and scientific writers as well as on folk remedies and magic. It is a significant if quirky text in the history of European medical writing, an infrequent subject of monographs, but regularly mined as a source for magic charms, Celtic <b>herbology</b> and lore, and the linguistic study of Gaulish and Vulgar Latin. Bonus auctor est (“he’s a good authority”) was the judgment of J.J. Scaliger, while the science historian George Sarton called the De medicamentis an “extraordinary mixture of traditional knowledge, popular (Celtic) medicine, and rank superstition.” Marcellus is usually identified with the magister officiorum of that name who held office during the reign of Theodosius I.|$|E
25|$|The {{meaning of}} waidan derives from wai (outside, exterior) and dan {{referring}} to alchemical operations, {{such as the}} preparation of chemical elixirs, made from cinnabar, realgar, and other substances generally involving mercury, sulfur, lead, and arsenic or else the animal and botanical products which are found in Chinese <b>herbology</b> and Traditional Chinese medicine. Waidan refers to practices relating {{to the process of}} making an elixir often containing herbal or chemical substances found outside of the body. This process involves esoteric oral instructions, building a laboratory, kindling and sustaining the special fires used in the production process, rules of seclusion and purification for the alchemist to follow, and various practices including the performance of ceremonies to protect the self and the ritual area. Waidan can also include following a dietary regimen which prescribes or proscribes certain foods. Preparing medicines and elixirs can be referred to as outer practices or waidan as these practices occur outside of the body until they are verified by the ingestion of medicines, herbs, and pills to bring about physical changes within the body, separate to the soul.|$|E
500|$|Other {{members of}} staff include the dumpy <b>Herbology</b> teacher and Head of Hufflepuff House Professor Sprout, [...] Professor Flitwick, the tiny and excitable Charms teacher, and Head of Ravenclaw House, the {{soporific}} History of Magic teacher, Professor Binns, a ghost {{who does not}} seem to have noticed his own death; and Madam Hooch, the Quidditch coach, who is strict, but a considerate and methodical teacher. The poltergeist Peeves wanders around the castle causing trouble wherever he can.|$|E
500|$|Harry starts {{classes at}} Hogwarts School, with lessons {{including}} Transfiguration with head of Gryffindor, Minerva McGonagall, <b>Herbology</b> with Head of Hufflepuff, Pomona Sprout, Charms with Head of Ravenclaw Filius Flitwick, and Defence Against the Dark Arts with Quirinus Quirrell. Harry's least favourite class is Potions, taught by Severus Snape, the vindictive Head of Slytherin {{who seems to}} loathe Harry. [...] Harry, Ron, and Hermione become far more interested by extracurricular matters {{within and outside the}} school, particularly after they discover that a huge three-headed dog is standing guard over a trap door in a forbidden corridor. They also become suspicious of Snape's behaviour and become convinced that he is looking for ways to get past the trapdoor to whatever it's hiding.|$|E
500|$|The ancient Chinese society first {{encountered}} the tea plant {{in what is}} now southern China and processed it as another medicinal herb for use in Chinese <b>herbology.</b> The processing technique used to process fresh tea leaves was to immediately steam the fresh tea leaves and dry them for preservation, which is likely the most ancient Chinese form of tea leaf processing. This processing method was perfected {{near the end of the}} Han Dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE) and produced a dried tea that would be classified today as [...] "green tea" [...] and quite similar to modern Japanese sencha. For consumption, dried tea leaves were either decocted with water around with other herbs, or ground into a powder to be taken straight, or in a liquid in the manner of matcha.|$|E
500|$|Even {{when the}} leaves were quickly cooled, {{if they are}} left in piles (渥堆) for too long before processing, the leaves will begin to undergo {{microbial}} fermentation to produce [...] "post-fermented tea". This technique is somewhat similar to composting, albeit tightly controlled, and still used {{in the production of}} Liu'an tea (安徽六安籃茶) and was more recently introduced for the production of the [...] "ripe" [...] type pu-erh tea. The production of tea in brick forms and their storage also resulted in another type of post-fermented tea, which was produced by aging. The long transport and storage times of the day unwittingly allowed the tea bricks to undergo prolonged exposure to the elements and to various microflora, which resulted in the aging, oxidation, and fermentation of green brick teas. A brick of green tea that had been stored and aged into post-fermented tea was charred over charcoal to rid it of the layer of detritus, dust, and shiny multicoloured growths before being broken down into a powder, cooked, and then consumed. By the end of Tang Dynasty (618-907CE) green, yellow, and post-fermented tea was commonly used in China and moved from purely being used in <b>herbology</b> to becoming a beverage drunk for pleasure.|$|E

2500|$|... “Salty” {{is one of}} the “five flavors” of Chinese <b>herbology</b> and Chinese cuisine which Chinese see as {{the basis}} of good food. [...] Salt is not {{generally}} sprinkled on a dish at the last moment or at the table, {{as is often the case}} in western cooking, but is more often one of the ingredients.|$|E
2500|$|Chinese <b>herbology</b> (...) is {{the theory}} of {{traditional}} Chinese herbal therapy, which accounts {{for the majority of}} treatments in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). A Nature editorial described TCM as [...] "fraught with pseudoscience", and said that the most obvious reason why it has not delivered many cures is that the majority of its treatments have no logical mechanism of action.|$|E
2500|$|Ox bezoars (cow bezoars) {{are used}} in Chinese <b>herbology,</b> where they are called niu-huang (牛黃) or {{calculus}} bovis. These are gallstones, or substitutes, from ox or cattle gall bladder bile. There are artificial calculus bovis used as substitutes. These are manufactured from cholic acid derived from bovine bile. [...] In some products, they claim to remove [...] "toxins" [...] from the body.|$|E
2500|$|Demonism, {{or black}} magic, was not prevalent. Persecution for witchcraft, mostly {{involved}} {{the practice of}} simple earth magic, founded on <b>herbology,</b> by solitary practitioners with a Christian influence. In one case investigators found a locked box containing something bundled in a kerchief and three paper packets, wrapped and tied, containing crushed grasses. [...] Most rituals of witchcraft were very simple—one spell of divination consists of sitting alone outside meditating, asking the earth to show one's fate.|$|E
2500|$|The term <b>herbology</b> is {{misleading}} {{in the sense}} that, while plant elements {{are by far the}} most commonly used substances, animal, human, and mineral products are also utilized. In the Neijing they are referred to as 毒藥 [...] which means toxin, poison, or medicine. Unschuld points out that this is similar etymology to the Greek pharmakon and so he uses the term [...] "pharmaceutic". Thus, the term [...] "medicinal" [...] (instead of herb) is usually preferred as a translation for 药 (...) [...]|$|E
2500|$|There are twelve named {{teachers}} (referred to as Professors), each specialising in {{a single}} subject. All professors are overseen by a school head and deputy head. Transfiguration, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Charms, Potions, Astronomy, History of Magic, and <b>Herbology</b> are compulsory subjects {{for the first five}} years, as well as flying lessons. At the end of their second year, students are required to add at least two optional subjects to their syllabus {{for the start of the}} third year. The five choices are Arithmancy, Muggle Studies, Divination, Study of Ancient Runes and Care of Magical Creatures. [...] "Very specialised subjects such as alchemy are sometimes offered in the final two years, if there is sufficient demand." ...|$|E
2500|$|Witchcraft trials {{occurred}} {{frequently in}} seventeenth-century Russia, although the [...] "great witch-hunt" [...] {{is believed to}} be a predominately Western European phenomenon. [...] However, as the witchcraft-trial craze swept across Catholic and Protestant countries during this time, Orthodox Christian Europe indeed partook in this so-called [...] "witch hysteria." [...] This involved the persecution of both males and females who were believed to be practicing paganism, <b>herbology,</b> the black art, or a form of sorcery within and/or outside their community. [...] Very early on witchcraft legally fell {{under the jurisdiction of the}} ecclesiastical body, the church, in Kievan Rus' and Muscovite Russia. [...] Sources of ecclesiastical witchcraft jurisdiction date back as early as the second half of the eleventh century, one being Vladimir the Great's first edition of his State Statute or Ustav, another being multiple references in the Primary Chronicle beginning in 1024.|$|E
2500|$|The {{text that}} Chinese editors have titled [...] "Myriad Things" [...] or [...] "Ten Thousand Things" [...] (Wanwu [...] ) is an {{extensive}} list of natural substances that historians of Chinese medicine {{see as a}} precursor of later Chinese <b>herbology,</b> or literature on materia medica like the Shennong bencao jing. It explains how to use some substances for healing purposes, but also contains technical {{information on how to}} catch animals or expel vermin. In the words of historian Donald Harper, this work [...] "catalogues human curiosity about the products of nature," [...] noting among other things that pinellia can fatten pigs and that [...] "a horse-gullet tube can be used to breathe under water." [...] The names of drugs and illnesses found in Wanwu correspond with those found in the Recipes for Fifty-Two Ailments, a text dating from about 200 BCE that was buried in a tomb in Mawangdui in 168 BCE. These and other correspondences between the two texts show that the same knowledge of drugs was circulating in both the southern Chu region (Mawangdui) and the Yangzi River valley (Shuanggudui).|$|E
