Persister cells have been implicated in treatment failure of such infections. We sought to profile bacterial subpopulations residing in S. epidermidis biofilms, and to establish persister-targeting treatment strategies to eradicate biofilms. Population analysis was performed by challenging single biofilm cells with antibiotics at increasing concentrations ranging from planktonic minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) to biofilm MBCs (MBCbiofilm). Two populations of "persister cells" were observed: bacteria that survived antibiotics at MBCbiofilm for 24 / 48 hours were referred to as dormant cells; those selected with antibiotics at 8 X MICs for 3 hours (excluding <b>dormant</b> <b>cells)</b> were defined as tolerant-but-killable (TBK) cells. Antibiotic regimens targeting <b>dormant</b> <b>cells</b> were tested in vitro for their efficacies in eradicating persister cells and intact biofilms.

While Hugh lies unconscious from Calvin's attack, Calvin uses the electric shock tool Hugh wielded to escape his immediate enclosure.

However, Calvin latches onto Rory's leg and physician David Jordan locks Rory in the room to keep Calvin contained. After Rory unsuccessfully attacks Calvin with a flame thrower, Calvin enters his mouth, killing him by devouring his organs from the inside.

40|$|Understanding the {{dynamics}} of dormant cells in microbial biofilms, in which the bacteria are embedded in extracellular matrix, is important for developing successful antibiotic therapies against pathogenic bacteria. Although some of the molecular mechanisms leading to bacterial persistence have been speculated in planktonic bacterial cell, how dormant cells emerge in the biofilms of pathogenic bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa remains unclear. The present study proposes four hypotheses of <b>dormant</b> <b>cell</b> formation; stochastic process, nutrient-dependent, oxygen-dependent, and time-dependent processes. These hypotheses were implemented into a three-dimensional individual-based model of biofilm formation.

We present a detailed study of the toxin–antitoxin module implicated in antibiotic persistence of Escherichia coli. We find that bacterial <b>cells</b> become <b>dormant</b> if the toxin level is higher than a threshold, and that the amount by which the threshold is exceeded determines the duration of dormancy. Fluctuations in toxin levels above and below the threshold result in coexistence of <b>dormant</b> and growing <b>cells.</b> We conclude that toxin–antitoxin modules in general represent a mixed network motif that can serve to produce a subpopulation of <b>dormant</b> <b>cells</b> and to supply a mechanism for regulating the frequency and duration of growth arrest.

These <b>dormant</b> disseminated tumour <b>cells</b> (DTCs) are thought to play {{a pivotal role in}} driving tumour growth in bone and are likely responsible for disease recurrence following chemotherapy. Currently, the molecular pathways regulating cancer cell dormancy remain to be determined. DTCs have very low abundance in bone and are, therefore, difficult to detect and study. This thesis aimed to develop approaches to identify and study rare <b>dormant</b> cancer <b>cells</b> in bone and to address the hypothesis that; <b>dormant</b> cancer <b>cells</b> in bone express a unique transcriptional profile that differs from proliferating cancer cells. Through the administration of MDA-MB- 231 cells via the intracardiac route, we established a breast cancer bone colonisation model that enabled tracking of temporal tumour development within the skeleton. Detected in the early and late stages of disease, discrete single cells were identified histologically amongst growing colonies suggesting that not all tumour cells that colonise bone activate to form colonies. Retention of the fluorescent membrane dye, DiD, was used to discriminate proliferating from non-proliferating cells in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, less than 0. 1 % of cells retained DiD after 14 days suggesting that the majority of cells had proliferated. In contrast, rare solitary, <b>dormant</b> <b>cells</b> were visualised in-vivo using. Two-photon imaging of explanted bones from mice 28 days following injection of DiD labelled MDA-MB- 231 <b>cells.</b> DiD retaining <b>dormant</b> <b>cells</b> isolated from mice using flow activated cell sorting re-activated upon in vitro culture confirming their ability to grow and eliminating the possibility that they were senescent or non-viable cells. In agreement with our hypothesis, single cell transcriptomic profiling analysis of <b>dormant</b> breast cancer <b>cells</b> from bone revealed a distinct transcriptomic profile when compared to proliferating cancer cells, with over 2, 000 differentially expressed genes. Using gene ontology and NMF clustering analyses, we identified novel pathways and genes which {{may play a role in}} regulating tumour cell dormancy and activation.

40|$|Sporulation in the {{bacterium}} Bacillus subtilis is a developmental {{program in which}} a progenitor cell differentiates into two different cell types, the smaller of which eventually becomes a <b>dormant</b> <b>cell</b> called a spore. The process begins with an asymmetric cell division event, followed by the activation of a transcription factor, σF, specifically in the smaller cell.

Both events are known to require a protein called SpoIIE, which also localizes to the polar septum. We show that DivIVA copurifies with SpoIIE and that DivIVA may anchor SpoIIE briefly to the assembling polar septum before SpoIIE is subsequently released into the forespore membrane and recaptured at the polar septum. Finally, using super-resolution microscopy, we demonstrate that DivIVA and SpoIIE ultimately display a biased localization {{on the side of}} the polar septum that faces the smaller compartment in which σF is activated...|$|E

Methods We cultured leukaemia cells continuously in vitro {{in the presence of}} an mTOR inhibitor to model dormancy. Apoptosis, damage, RNA content and reducing capacity were evaluated. We treated dormancy-enriched cells for 48 hours with the nucleoside analogues ara-C, 5 -azacytidine and clofarabine, the topoisomerase targeting agents daunorubicin, etoposide and irinotecan and three multikinase inhibitors with activity against RP 2 - flavopiridol, roscovitine and TG 02, and we measured growth inhibition and apoptosis. We describe use of the parameter 2 × IC 50 to measure residual cell targeting. RNA synthesis was measured with 5 -ethynyl uridine. Drug-induced apoptosis was measured flow cytometrically in primary cells from patients with acute myeloid leukaemia using a CD 34 /CD 71 /annexinV gating strategy to identify <b>dormant</b> apoptotic <b>cells.</b> Results Culture of the KG 1 a cell line continuously in the presence of an mTOR inhibitor induced features of dormancy including low RNA content, low metabolism and low basal ROS formation {{in the absence of a}} DNA damage response or apoptosis. All agents were more effective against the unmanipulated than the dormancy-enriched cells, emphasising the chemoresistant nature of <b>dormant</b> <b>cells.</b> However, the percentage of cell reduction by RP 2 inhibitors at 2 × IC 50 was significantly greater than that of other agents. RP 2 inhibitors strongly inhibited RNA synthesis compared with other drugs.

In a dormancy model based on 12 -day AML/stroma co-culture, we have shown that the expression of some aberrant phenotypes can persist for several days. Also, after 12 days, some of the CD 34 +, PKH 26 high (dormant), and LAP+ (leukaemic) cells maintained their primitiveness and were still clonogenic. Furthermore, our chemosensitivity data showed that novel agents TG 02, and BH 3 mimetics ABT- 737 and ABT- 199, which inhibit the B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL- 2) family of anti-apoptotic molecules, could efficiently target BM niche-mediated chemoresistance, which {{is thought to}} be one of the main obstacles to traditional chemotherapy.

In literature {{is not yet clear}} whether <b>dormant</b> tumor <b>cells</b> are out of cell cycle, or persist in a dynamic state of proliferation and death. The transition between dormant and active states requires the presence of various signals, such as cytokines, hormones and growth factors (Donnenberg et al. 2010).

Stress response and dormancy appear to represent alternative strategies of cell survival. The mechanism of persister formation is unknown, but isolated persisters show increased levels of toxin/antitoxin (TA) transcripts.
