50|$|Spacecraft #11 {{also had}} a new {{explosive}} <b>hatch</b> <b>release.</b> This would allow an astronaut to exit the spacecraft quickly {{in the event of}} an emergency. Emergency personnel could also trigger the explosive hatch from outside the spacecraft by pulling on an external lanyard. Both the pop-off hatch and the lanyard are standard features of ejection seats used in military aircraft, but in the Mercury design, the pilot still had to exit the craft himself, or be removed by emergency personnel. The original exit procedure was to climb out through the antenna compartment, after removing a small pressure bulkhead. This was a difficult and slow procedure. Removal of an injured or unconscious astronaut through the top hatch would be nearly impossible. The original side hatch was bolted shut with 70 bolts and covered with several spacecraft shingles, making it a slow process to open the original hatch.|$|E
50|$|Resting eggs enclose {{an embryo}} encysted in a three layered shell that protects itfrom {{external}} stressors. They {{are able to}} remain dormant for several decades and can resist adverse periods (e.g., pond desiccation or presence of antagonists). When favourable conditions return and after an obligatory period of diapause which varies among species, resting eggs <b>hatch</b> <b>releasing</b> diploid amictic females that enter into the asexual phase of thelife cycle.|$|R

40|$|An {{estimated}} number of 240 millions people worldwide suffer of schistosomi-asis (mainly in Africa and Asia). Also known as bilharzia, it {{is a disease}} caused by parasitic worms. There are tree main trematode worm parasites transmitted by freshwater snails (Schistosoma mansoni, S. haematobium, and S. japonicum) which can cause illness in humans and bovine. Freshwater becomes contaminated by schistosoma eggs when infected peo-ple urinate or defecate in the water. The eggs <b>hatch,</b> <b>release</b> parasites which infect the appropriate species of intermediate snails in the water. The parasite develop and multiply inside the snails, leaves them and enters the water where it can survive for about 48 hours. Schistosoma parasites can penetrate the skin of persons who {{come in contact with}} contaminated freshwater, typically when wading, swimming, bathing, or washing. Schistosomiasis can be the contained by controlling the intermediate snails. This is mostly done using the pesticides/molluscicides which can be very harmful to aquatic ecosystem.

50|$|Monogeneans {{possess the}} {{simplest}} life cycle among the parasitic platyhelminths. They have no intermediate hosts and are ectoparasitic on fish (seldom in the urinary bladder and rectum of cold-blooded vertebrates). Although they are hermaphrodites, the male reproductive system becomes functional before the female part. The eggs <b>hatch</b> <b>releasing</b> a heavily ciliated larval stage {{known as an}} oncomiracidium. The oncomiracidium has numerous posterior hooks and is generally the life stage responsible for transmission from host to host.No known monogeneans infect birds, but one (Oculotrema hippopotami) infects mammals, parasitizing {{the eye of the}} hippopotamus.|$|R
50|$|Friction, {{the third}} and final album (until 2013) by Coney <b>Hatch,</b> was <b>released</b> in 1985. Drummer Dave Ketchum left prior to this release, to be {{replaced}} by Barry Connors, formerly of Toronto.|$|R
30|$|In H. elegans, the {{reduction}} in the rotation time in the presence of phorate suggests that the metabolic activity is reduced, as the quantity of the <b>hatching</b> enzyme <b>released</b> {{in the final stages of}} embryonic development may decrease or the secretion process is slowed down. The decrease/delay in the production of hatching enzyme may be ascertained from the increased hatching time of H. elegans in the presence of phorate in sea water. The <b>hatching</b> time (<b>release</b> time) of H. elegans was 300.50 [*]±[*] 2.12  min, and it gradually increases to 421.50 [*]±[*] 6.58  min at 5  ppm of phorate.|$|R

50|$|The adult fly {{is about}} 1.5 {{millimeters}} long, dark gray in color with a shiny metallic gold or silver face. The female lays eggs on {{the leaves of}} hydrilla above {{the surface of the}} water. In about three days the tiny eggs <b>hatch,</b> <b>releasing</b> the small white or yellow-green larvae. The larva of this fly is a leaf miner. It enters the flesh of the leaf and digs tunnels through it as it feeds. The larva eats nearly all of the inner tissue of the leaf before {{moving on to the next}} leaf. One larva finishes an average of twelve leaves during its two-week larval period. It then pupates for about a week and emerges as an adult.|$|R
40|$|The embryo of Toxoneuron nigriceps (Hymenoptera, Braconidae) is {{surrounded}} by an extraembryonic membrane, which, at <b>hatching,</b> <b>releases</b> teratocytes and {{gives rise to a}} cell layer embedding the body of the 1 st instar larva. This cell layer was studied at different developmental times, from soon after hatching up to the first larval moult, in order to elucidate its ultrastructural, immunocytochemical and physiological function. The persisting ‘‘larval serosa’’ shows a striking structural and functional complexity: it is a multifunctional barrier with protective properties, limits the passage of macromolecules and it is actively involved in the enzymatic processing and uptake of nutrients. The reported results emphasizes the important role that the embryo-derived host regulation factors may have in parasitism success in Hymenoptera koinobionts...|$|R
25|$|By contrast, {{one giant}} African snail, Achatina fulica, lays 100 to 400 {{elliptical}} eggs that each measure about 5mm long. Each snail may lay several batches of eggs each year, {{usually in the}} wet season. They may lay eggs in holes in the ground like H. pomatia, or lay eggs {{on the surface of}} a rocky soil, in organic matter, or at the base of plants. In 10 to 30 days, the eggs <b>hatch</b> <b>releasing</b> snails about 4mm long. These snails grow up to 10mm per month. After 6 months, the Achatina fulica is about 35mm long and may already be sexually mature. Sexual maturity takes 6 to 16 months, depending on weather and the availability of calcium. This snail lives 5 or 6 years, sometimes as many as 9 years.|$|R
40|$|From 1997 to 1999, we {{identified}} seven human cases of infection by fourth stage larvae of Pseudoterranova decipiens in Chile. All identified larvae were coughed {{up by the}} patients. Subjects were 10 - 55 years old; five were female. Some patients complained of coughing, expectoration, pharyngeal pain, nausea or anal and nasal pruritus. Larvae of three patients were coughed up from 36 h to 7 days after having eaten raw (cebiche or sushi) or lightly fried fish. P. decipiens has a marine life cycle. Infective third stage larva develop to adult stage in pinniped mammals. The nematode eggs are voided with the host faeces and develop and <b>hatch</b> <b>releasing</b> third stage larvae. Some crustaceans and fish act as hosts of third stage larvae. Man is an accidental host for third or fourth stage larvae...|$|R
50|$|Like G1 before them, the {{original}} GH fleet were fitted with four hatches - two per side, between the axles and {{either side of}} the brake gear along the centre of the underframe. This made access to the brakes unwieldy, and the four <b>hatches</b> <b>released</b> grain too quickly for the conveyor belt systems. To resolve both issues later wagons were built with only two hatches, centered one either side which halved the grain delivery rate and made access to the brake rigging much easier. GH150 and GH151 were constructed with alternative braking arrangements, by cutting a small enclave in underneath one end of the hopper and placing the brake equipment there. Some further wagons were modified, but many (including some then under construction) only had the cut-out section constructed without shifting the brake equipment.|$|R

50|$|McDonnell {{engineers}} came up {{with two}} different quick <b>release</b> <b>hatches</b> for the Mercury spacecraft. One with a latch, used on Ham's (a chimpanzee) MR-2 and Shepard's MR-3 missions. The other design was an explosive <b>release</b> <b>hatch.</b> The quick <b>release</b> latching <b>hatch</b> weighed 69 lb (31 kg), {{too much of a}} weight addition to use on the orbital version of the spacecraft. The explosive hatch design used the 70 bolts of the original design, but each quarter-inch (6.35 mm) titanium bolt had a 0.06 in hole bored into it to provide a weak point. A mild detonating fuse (MDF) was installed in a channel between the inner and outer seal around the periphery of the hatch. When the MDF was ignited, the resulting gas pressure between the inner and outer seal would cause the bolts to fail in tension.|$|R
50|$|A {{week after}} the trial ended, <b>Hatch</b> was <b>{{released}}</b> from Newgate, having spent 191 days in prison. Two weeks after that, Eugenia too was released under The Royal Pardon; she was to spend several years away from her family {{under the control of}} a strict governess, where it was intended that she should receive some religious and moral education.|$|R

2500|$|Two {{types of}} {{die-cast}} toy models were sold under the Corgi Toy brand and manufactured by Mettoy Playcraft in the UK {{during the late}} 1960s. Both were done in [...] One was a two-tone red and black Marlin with opening doors and a tow hook. The [...] "Rambler Marlin Sports Fastback" [...] (Corgi 263) scale model was released in 1966 and withdrawn from the market in 1969. In addition to the two-tone paint with chrome bumpers and grille, the model features a detailed interior finished in white and the front seat backs can be tipped forward (as in the actual cars). The second was a gift boxed set (Corgi GS10) with the Marlin finished in blue with a white roof and featuring a roof rack for a kayak, as well as towing a matching utility trailer with opening <b>hatches.</b> <b>Released</b> in 1968, this set had a short run of just 11 months.|$|R

50|$|H. nana is {{the only}} cestode capable of {{completing}} its lifecycle without an intermediate host. It can, however, pass through an intermediate host, as well. The most common intermediate hosts for H. nana are arthropods (e.g. flour beetles). When an egg is ingested by the definitive host, it <b>hatches</b> and <b>releases</b> a six-hook larva called the oncosphere (hexacanth) which penetrates the villi of the small intestine and develops into a cysticercoid.|$|R
5000|$|Very small {{eggs are}} laid by the female in autumn on twigs and branches. The eggs <b>hatch</b> by <b>releasing</b> tiny {{caterpillars}} {{that at first}} feed within the shoots of the host plant. As they grow they gather together and weave webs that may eventually envelop a whole tree. In fact in this species the cartepillars are gregarious. They develop by protecting themselves in these silk webs that constitute a collective nest. [...] There are five larval stages in all.|$|R
25|$|Echinostoma {{species have}} low {{specificity}} for their definitive hosts, and can infect {{a variety of}} different species of animal, including amphibians, aquatic birds, mammals and humans. A definitive host which is infected with Echinostoma will shed unembryonated Echinostoma eggs in their faeces. When the eggs are in contact with fresh water they may become embryonated, and will then <b>hatch</b> and <b>release</b> miracidia. The miracidia stage of Echinostoma is free-swimming, and actively penetrates the first intermediate snail host, which then becomes infected.|$|R
