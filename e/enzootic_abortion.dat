40|$|SUMMARY Toluidine blue {{staining}} {{was used}} to detect Chlamydia trachomatis inclusions in both McCoy and HeLa- 229 cells from clinical specimens. This method was more sensitive than iodine staining for detecting C trachomatis inclusions in both McCoy and HeLa- 229 cells and also more sensitive than Giemsa staining for detecting chlamydial inclusions in HeLa- 229 cells. While its sensitivity for detection of chlamydial inclusions in McCoy cells is {{equal to that of}} Giemsa staining, toluidine blue staining is easier and faster to perform. Different staining methods have been used to detect chlamydial inclusions in cell cultures. Giemsa stain-ing followed by dark ground microscopy has been the most commonly used technique. The glycogen matrix of Chlamydia trachomatis inclusions can be detected using various stains-for example, iodine' carmine, 2 and periodic acid Schiff. 3 Iodine staining combined with bright field microscopy is probably the simplest of all staining techniques for detecting C trachomatis inclusions, but compared with Giemsa and carmine it is less sensitive. 4 Periodic acid Schiff stain is useful in that inclusions are detectable by both bright and dark field microscopy, but the actual staining technique is quite complex, as is that for carmine. 5 Methylene blue stain combined with dark field microscopy is said to be useful for the diagnosis of infection caused by the <b>enzootic</b> ovine <b>abortion</b> strain of C psittaci. 6 But it offers no advantage over Giemsa or iodine stains for the detection of C trachomatis inclusions. : Immunofluorescent staining 7 seems to be both fast and sensitive but it requires the use of expensive reagents.

40|$|In the summer-fall of 2011, a nonspecific febrile {{syndrome}} {{characterized by}} hyperthermia, drop in milk production and watery diarrhea {{was reported in}} adult dairy cows {{from a series of}} farms located in North-West Europe. Further, in November 2011, an <b>enzootic</b> outbreak of <b>abortion,</b> stillbirth and birth at term of lambs, kids and calves with neurologic signs and/or head, spine or limb malformations emerged throughout several European countries. Both syndromes were associated with the presence in the blood (adults) or in the central nervous system (newborns) of the genome of a new Shamonda-like orthobunyavirus provisionally named Schmallenberg virus after the place where the first positive samples were collected. The clinical, pathological, virological and epidemiological facts that were made publicly available during the first 6 months after the emergence are presented here. Current knowledge of the epidemiology of the phylogenetically closest relatives of the newcomer (Shamonda, Aino and Akabane viruses) is not exhaustive enough to predict whether the current outbreak of Schmallenberg virus is the prelude to endemicity or to a 2 years long outbreak before the infection burns out when serologically naïve animals are no longer available. In the future, cyclic epizootic reemergences are a possibility too, either synchronized with a global decrease of herd immunity or due to antigenic variants escaping the immunity acquired against their predecessors. The latter hypothesis seems unlikely because of the wide array of biologic constraints acting on the genome of viruses whose life cycle requires transmission by a vector, which represses genetic drift. The remarkable stability of the Shamonda virus genome over the last forty years is reassuring in this regard. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|The {{immunobiology}} of <b>enzootic</b> <b>abortion</b> of ewes (EAE) is incompletely understood. The causative {{agent is}} Chlamydia psittaci, which infects many ruminant species and has zoonotic potential.

The effects of cytokines on chlamydial multiplication vary between host species, between different cell types within those species and also vary between chlamydial species and strains. The multiplication of the EAE strain of C. psittaci in ovine ST- 6 cells can be restricted by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) but not with comparable concentrations of IFN-alpha.

40|$|Abstract. Chlamydia psittaci is a {{major cause}} of ovine {{abortion}} in the fourth to fifth months of gestation. During the lambing seasons of 1986, 1987, and 1988, fetuses from 52 cases of ovine abortion, stillbirth, or perinatal death were submitted to the laboratory for necropsy examination. Placenta or fetal tissues from 34 cases were cultured on mouse L cells for C. psittaci. Chlamydia psittaci was identified by immunofluorescence on cultures in 20 of these cases. The major gross lesion consistently associated with Chlamydial abortion was placentitis with multifocal cotyledonary necrosis and accumulation of red-brown exudate in the intercotyledonary placenta Chlamydiae appeared as spherical organisms, less than 1 µm in diameter, in the cytoplasm of tropho-blasts in impression smears of cotyledons. H istologically, placentitis was sometimes accompanied by pneumonia or encephalitis in the fetus. Chlamydia psittaci was considered the cause for fetal death when Chlamydial isolation was associated with placentitis or inflammation of other fetal tissues and when other abortifacient agents were not detected. <b>Enzootic</b> <b>abortion</b> of ewes (EAE) was first described in Scotland in 1936, 9 but it was 1950 before Stamp identified Chlamydia psittaci as the etiologic agent?

In the present study, a recently developed test, based on a recombinant fragment of the polymorphic outer membrane protein POMP 90 (rOMP 90 - 4 indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [iELISA]) and one based on the variable segment 2 (VS 2) region of the major outer membrane protein (MOMP) (MOMP VS 2 iELISA) were compared using sera from C. abortus-infected ewes at different stages throughout pregnancy. The rOMP 90 iELISA detected antibody much earlier in pregnancy than the MOMP iELISA, which, like the complement fixation test, detected antibody only at the time of abortion or lambing. No anti-MOMP antibody response could be detected in three of seven experimentally infected ewes.

At day 0 of the estrus cycle, the vaginal tracts of 10 nonpregnant ewes were inoculated with C. psittaci and 10 ewes were exposed by subcutaneous injection. The ewes were bred 6 weeks postinfection. Five ewes from the vaginally infected group and four from the subcutaneously infected group were reinfected by subcutaneous injection at day 60 of gestation. Pregnancy outcomes and antibody responses to infection were compared with that of ewes that were infected with C. psittaci, either subcutaneously or intravaginally, for the first time during pregnancy and with that of noninfected control ewes. Subcutaneous infection of nonpregnant ewes did not cause subsequent pregnancy failure; rather, this provided protection against abortion following reinfection during pregnancy. As expected, abortions or the birth of weak lambs was observed in those ewes that received primary C. psittaci infection by either route during pregnancy. Similarly, abortion or the birth of weak lambs was a consequence of vaginal inoculation prior to breeding, thereby confirming the susceptibility of the vaginal mucosa to infection and demonstrating the potential for venereal transmission...|$|E
40|$|As Bactérias da família Chlamydiaceae são classificadas nos gêneros Chlamydia e Chlamydophila. O primeiro contêm as espécies C. trachomatis, C. suis e C. muridarum e o segundo as espécies C. abortus, C. pecorum, C. psittaci, C. felis, C. pneumoniae e C. caviae. Entre as espécies do gênero Chlamydophila causadoras de doença da esfera reprodutiva em animais de interesse econômico, a C. abortus tem sido descrita em vários países, como causa de abortamento, nascimento de animais prematuros e natimortalidade. A doença causada pela C. abortus é conhecida como aborto enzoótico ovino, aborto enzoótico caprino e pelo aborto epizoótico bovino, causando prejuízos econômicos e problemas de saúde publica. A dificuldade em se realizar o diagnóstico da clamidofilose tanto por isolamento, por provas de biologia molecular, como por provas sorológicas, pode ser a causa da ausência de citações da C. abortus em ovinos, no Brasil, até a presente data. O objetivo deste trabalho foi estimar a soroprevalência de anticorpos contra Chlamydophila em ovinos de propriedades localizadas em municípios da região de Londrina, Estado do Paraná. A prova de fixação de complemento, recomendada pela OIE, foi realizada em 267 amostras de soro sanguíneo de ovinos, provenientes de oito propriedades, sendo considerados positivos os animais que apresentaram títulos > 32. Foram detectados 19 (7, 11 %) animais positivos, e sete (87, 50 %) propriedades tiveram pelo menos um animal positivo. Nestas propriedades, foram relatados sinais clínicos de abortamento, natimortalidade, nascimento de crias fracas e repetição de cio. Dos 19 soros positivos, 17 (89, 50 %) apresentaram títulos de 32, um (5, 30 %) apresentou título de 64 e um (5, 30 %) apresentou título de 128. Este resultado indica a presença de anticorpos contra Chlamydophila nas propriedades estudadas. Bacteria {{from the}} family Chlamydiaceae are {{classified}} in genres Chlamydia and Chlamydophila. The former contains the species C. trachomatis, C. suis and C. muridarum and the latter, the species C. abortus, C. pecorum, C. psittaci, C. felis, C. pneumoniae and C. caviae. Among the species from genre Chlamydophila, which are known as the causers of reproductive diseases in animals of economic interests, C. abortus has been described in several countries {{as a cause of}} abortion, birth of premature animals and natimortality. The disease caused by C. abortus is known as ovine <b>enzootic</b> <b>abortion,</b> caprine <b>enzootic</b> <b>abortion</b> and as cattle epizootic abortion, causing great economic losses and public health problems. The difficulty in reaching a diagnosis of chlamydophilosis whether by isolation, by molecular biology tests, or by serological tests can be the cause for the lack of literature on C. abortus in ovines in Brazil until the present date. The aim {{of this paper is to}} estimate the seroprevalence of antibodies against Chlamydophila in ovines from farms in cities from the region of Londrina, in the state of Parana, Brazil. The complement fixation test, recommended by OIE, was performed in 267 samples from ovine sera samples collected from eight different properties. Animals presenting titers > 32 were considered positive. From the samples analyzed, a total of 19 animals (7. 11 %) were considered positive, and seven properties (87. 50 %) had at least one animal considered positive. In these properties, clinical symptoms of abortion, natimortality, birth of weak offsprings and repetition of estrus were reported. From the 19 sera samples considered positive, 17 (89. 50 %) presented titers of 32, one (5. 30 %) presented titer of 64 and one (5. 30 %) presented titer of 128. This result indicates the presence of antibodies against Chlamydophila in the properties analyzed in this study...|$|E
40|$|Ovine <b>enzootic</b> <b>abortion</b> (OEA), {{caused by}} {{infection}} with gram negative bacteria Chlamydophila abortus (C. abortus), {{is one of}} the major causes of infectious abortion in sheep worldwide. So far there are only diagnostic tools available to confirm the disease after abortion. The purpose of this study was to measure and monitor the IgG antibody response against polymorphic outer membrane protein POMP 90 - 3 (which is a part of a protein present on the surface of C. abortus) during the development of a model of latency and see if there are possibilities to predict abortion, using the indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay rOMP 90 - 3 iELISA (developed at Moredun Research Institute, Edinburgh). Three groups were intranasally infected with different doses of C. abortus before they were mated. A negative control group was intranasally challenged with uninfected yolk sacs before mating and a positive control group was infected subcutaneous over the left prefemoral lymp node at 10 weeks of gestation (the standard method of infection in OEA studies). The antibody responses of all groups were followed for the first 13 months. During the latent phase a significant difference in antibody titers between groups 1 and 2 and the control group was detected. This shows that it is possible to detect an infection early in gestation or may be even before pregnancy. Although due to huge variations between animals, the test is perhaps not appropriate for that purpose. The intranasal route of infection before mating seems to be a better model for natural infection than the traditional method, subcutaneous over the left prefemoral lymph node. The intranasally way of infection shows the latency period and gives a higher percentage of abortion...|$|E
40|$|Proteins {{present in}} the outer {{membrane}} of chlamydiae {{that are involved in}} mucosal epithelial cell infection must clearly be identified and characterized if we are to understand and modify the pathogenic mechanisms utilized by these organisms. We have identified and isolated a family of four genes encoding putative outer membrane proteins (POMPs), a group of proteins of approximately 90 kDa {{present in the}} outer membrane of the subtype of Chlamydia psittaci that causes ovine <b>enzootic</b> <b>abortion</b> (strain S 26 / 3). These proteins, although minor components, are major immunogens, as shown by the immunoblotting of chlamydial outer membrane complexes with postabortion sheep sera, and are therefore potential diagnostic and/or protective antigen candidates. Immunoblotting of the expressed amino- and carboxy-terminal halves of one of the POMPs with postabortion sheep sera showed that the major humoral immune response appeared to be directed solely against the amino-terminal half. This result, in combination with the positive immunofluorescence staining of S 26 / 3 -infected cells using POMP-specific (specific to the amino-terminal half of the proteins) monoclonal antibodies, suggests the probable surface localization of the POMPs and, more specifically, the surface exposure of the amino-terminal half of these proteins. The four pomp genes are highly homologous, sharing 82 to 100 % similarity with each other (two of the genes are identical). Genes with strong and weak homologies were also detected in C. psittaci avian and feline pneumonitis strains, respectively. No pomp homologs were found in strains of C. trachomatis and C. pneumoniae, but this does not preclude their existence. The absence of homology with various subtypes of C. pecorum, which complicate the diagnosis of the ovine abortion subtype, indicates the possible suitability of the these 90 -kDa proteins as serodiagnostic antigens...|$|E
40|$|Chlamydophila abortus {{is one of}} the {{pathogens}} which induce {{abortion in}} small ruminants; this pathogen has a tropism for ruminant placenta and causes the disease commonly referred to as Ovine <b>Enzootic</b> <b>Abortion</b> (OEA). In Europe are estimated economic losses of around 20 million pounds a year by OEA. In the American Continent the disease has been reported only in Canada, the United States, Colombia and Chile while in Mexico it is unknown whether OEA is common and it is causing abortions in flocks of sheep from Estado de Mexico. The objective of this study was investigating the prevalence of anti-Chlamydophila abortus IgG antibodies and detection of C. abortus DNA in sheep with clinical abort history by mean of ELISA assay (C. abortus ELISA, Institute Pourquier, Montpellier, France) and molecular identification of the principal outer membrane protein (POMP 90 - 91 B) gene by PCR, respectively. A cross-sectional study was carried out to enroll and random sample of ewes from november 2003 until march 2005. A total of 349 sera and vaginal swabs samples were collected from 35 flocks of sheep from Xalatlaco. The results showed that the seropositive rate was 31. 1 % (14 / 45) for healthy and 21. 3 % (65 / 304) for sheep with history clinical of abort. In vaginal swabs, the PCR showed 0 % (0 / 45) for healthy animals and 0. 65 % (2 / 304) for aborted sheep. Samples from the lungs and liver of the fetus of one of these animals were also positive for C. abortus. In conclusion, these results confirmed that infection with C. abortus is common and is affecting sheep flocks in the Mexican highlands. Therefore, is necessary that the authorities responsible for animal welfare in Mexico (SAGARPA) to set up appropriate epidemiological surveillance and control programs to eradicate this disease...|$|E
