40|$|BACKGROUND: Aiming {{to deepen}} the {{understanding}} of the factors involved in the genesis of groin hernia, this study is focused on identifying the histological changes within the muscle fibers of the <b>internal</b> inguinal <b>ring</b> in patients having indirect inguinal hernia. METHODS: In eight patients with primary or recurrent bilateral indirect inguinal hernia who underwent a Stoppa open posterior inguinal hernia repair, a tissue specimen {{from the edge of the}} <b>internal</b> inguinal <b>ring</b> was biopsied and histologically examined. RESULTS: In all of the tissue samples, remarkable degenerative changes such as fibrohyaline degeneration of the muscle fibers, vascular congestion, and phlogistic infiltration through lymphohistiocytary elements was constantly detected. Also, in the patients with recurrent hernia, the key characteristic of the muscular change was that of fibrohyaline and, occasionally, myxoid degeneration of the myocytes. Nerve endings were frequently detected within the muscular structures of the <b>internal</b> inguinal <b>ring.</b> CONCLUSION: The degenerative fibrohyaline alteration, as well as the evidence of phlogistic elements within the examined structures, could represent a reason for a contractile incompetence of the <b>internal</b> inguinal <b>ring.</b> Consequently, the described findings lead the authors to depict this inflammatory degenerative structural weakness of the <b>internal</b> inguinal <b>ring</b> as a possible culprit of indirect inguinal hernia formation...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the elastic buckling of circular plates with an <b>internal</b> elastic <b>ring</b> support and elastically restrained edge against translation. The classical plate theory is used to derive the governing differential equation for circular plate with <b>internal</b> elastic <b>ring</b> support and flexible edge support system. This work presents the existence of buckling mode switching with respect to the radius of <b>internal</b> elastic <b>ring</b> support. The buckling mode may not be axisymmetric as previously assumed. The plate may buckle in an axisymmetric mode in general, but when the radius of the ring support becomes small, the plate may buckle in an asymmetric mode. The cross-over ring support radius varies from 0. 1255 to 0. 09371 times the plate radius, depending on the translational stiffness of the elastic restraint at the edges and elastic restraint of the ring support. The optimum radius of the <b>internal</b> elastic <b>ring</b> support is also determined. Extensive data is tabulated so that pertinent conclusions can be arrived at on the influence of translational restraints, Poisson’s ratio, and other boundary conditions on the buckling of uniform isotropic circular plates. The numerical results obtained are in good agreement with the previously published data...|$|R

5000|$|Although some {{high-end}} Core i7 processors expose QPI, other [...] "mainstream" [...] Nehalem desktop {{and mobile}} processors intended for single-socket boards (e.g. LGA 1156 Core i3, Core i5, and other Core i7 processors from the Lynnfield/Clarksfield and successor families) do not expose QPI externally, because these processors {{are not intended}} to participate in multi-socket systems. However, QPI is used internally on these chips {{to communicate with the}} [...] "uncore", {{which is part of the}} chip containing memory controllers, CPU-side PCI Express and GPU, if present; the uncore may or may not be on the same die as the CPU core, for instance it is on a separate die in the Westmere-based Clarkdale/Arrandale. These post-2009 single-socket chips communicate externally via the slower DMI and PCI Express interfaces, because the functions of the traditional northbridge are actually integrated into these processors, starting with Lynnfield, Clarksfield, Clarkdale and Arrandale; thus, there is no need to incur the expense of exposing the (former) front-side bus interface via the processor socket. Although the core-uncore QPI link is not present in desktop and mobile Sandy Bridge processors (as it was on Clarkdale, for example), the <b>internal</b> <b>ring</b> interconnect between on-die cores is also based on the principles behind QPI, at least as far as cache coherency is concerned.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the buckling and vibration of annular Mindlin plates with <b>internal</b> concentric <b>ring</b> supports subjected to external and internal isotropic in-plane radial pressure. The governing eigenvalue equation is obtained, by using the Rayleigh-Ritz approach with the transverse displacement and rotations being approximated by the product of a complete one-dimensional polynomial function and a basic function. The basic function is the product of the boundary equations and ensures the automatic satisfaction of the kinematic boundary conditions. Comprehensive sets of buckling factors and vibration frequencies for the aforementioned Mindlin plate problems are tabulated, for the first time, to the author 2 ̆ 7 s knowledge.

50|$|Roller is {{the wheel}} that rests on {{either end of}} the mini car's bumper and glides {{against the wall of the}} course. This allows the car to change {{direction}} and maintain stability. Conventional roller will do fine on a car with average speed, but, on a much faster car, aluminum or ball-bearing rollers must be purchased to acquire additional downforce and stability. These rollers do not tilt in angle as the conventional plastic rollers, and, therefore, have better chance in preventing the car from flinging off the course. Ball-bearing rollers have small metal balls around the <b>internal</b> <b>ring,</b> on which the roller spins, in order to minimize friction. Some rollers consist of two rollers on a pole -one at the base and other at the top-, so that they may offer the best stability. There are three types of roller arrangements. The first one is in which all rollers are same-sized, and this is for straight courses. The second arrangement, in which larger rollers are stationed in the front, is less stable when running through corners but minimizes speed losses; the third arrangement, in which smaller rollers are put in the front, is more stable when running through corners but the car is more susceptible to speed losses as it pushes into the wall.|$|E
40|$|Background: Narrowing of the <b>internal</b> <b>ring</b> {{around the}} pulled through spermatic cord {{in cases of}} laparoscopic orchiopexy is the norm. Aim: To carry out a {{prospective}} study to see if closure of the <b>internal</b> <b>ring</b> is really necessary, hypothesis being that mobilization of the impalpable testis leaves a raw surface, which, coupled {{with the presence of}} the spermatic cord results in effective closure of the <b>internal</b> <b>ring.</b> Methods and Materials: 51 patients with 65 impalpable testes underwent laparoscopic orchiopexy between July 1998 and Jun 2003. An impalpable testis was present in 21 cases on the left, 16 cases on the right and bilateral in 14 cases. Following complete mobilization required for orchiopexy, all testes with adequate length of spermatic cord were pulled down into the scrotum through the inguinal canal. No suture was applied to narrow the <b>internal</b> <b>ring</b> around the pulled through spermatic cord. Five testes were pulled down by an opening in the medial end of the inguinal canal due to inadequate length of the spermatic cord. In these cases the <b>internal</b> <b>ring</b> was closed by a suture. Results: Follow up of all cases ranged between 1. 5 years to 6. 5 years.

Cross over study, using six healthy intact male Mangalarga breed horses aged between 3 and 12 years. Horses were operated under general anesthesia in 25 º Trendelenburg position. Five laparoscopic portals were employed. Pericardium grafts measuring 4 x 5 cm were anchored covering the left and right <b>internal</b> inguinal <b>rings</b> using either manual intracorporeal suture or laparoscopic stapler. Horses were followed-up during 11 weeks when were submitted to a laparoscopic control. Surgical time, trans and postoperative complications and effectiveness of internal inguinal closure were evaluated and statistically analyzed. The level of significance was set at 5 % P< 0. 05. The procedures were realized without complications and the mean time required for manual and mechanical suture procedures differed significantly (67. 8 ± 15. 3 and 14. 1 ± 2. 1 min respectively; P< 0. 05). All manually sutured grafts remained in place and partial suture dehiscence with incomplete occlusion of the <b>internal</b> inguinal <b>ring</b> was observed in two stapled grafts.
