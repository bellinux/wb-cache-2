Then on 2December a road mine killed four men from the 2nd Forward Observation Unit (Airborne).|$|E

50|$|Each bomb in {{the game}} {{consists}} of multiple modules; the modules are independent {{of each other and}} can be <b>disarmed</b> in any order. Most modules require <b>disarming,</b> with the bomb successfully <b>disarmed</b> when all such modules are successfully <b>disarmed.</b> <b>Disarming</b> these modules requires the Defuser to relay visual indicators to the Experts, who then use the manual to determine what actions the Defuser to take. Other modules are needy; they cannot be <b>disarmed</b> and demand periodic attention to prevent them from going off while the bomb is still armed. Each bomb will also have a countdown timer that, if it hits zero, will cause the bomb to go off. Bombs will also have a maximum number of strikes resulting from errors made during defusing (also speeding the timer), and if that maximum is reached, the bomb will also go off. Other obstacles to the Defuser include the lights in the virtual room going out momentarily, and alarm clocks that will distract the Defuser.|$|R
5|$|On July 27, 1880, Pima County Sheriff Charles A. Shibell, whose {{offices were}} in the county seat of Tucson, {{appointed}} Wyatt Earp as deputy sheriff.

When he attempted to <b>disarm</b> Curly Bill Brocius, the gun discharged, striking White in the abdomen. Wyatt saw the shooting and pistol-whipped Brocius, knocking him unconscious, and arrested him. Wyatt later told his biographer John Flood that he thought Brocius was still armed at the time, and didn't see Brocius' pistol on the ground.|$|E

5|$|During this period, the {{government}} was involved in launching Gutt's monetary reform plan {{as well as the}} disarming of the resistance as part of the transition to stability. A major crisis emerged within {{the government}} over the refusal of the Front de l'Indépendance (FI-OF) and the Partisans Armés (PA), two large left-wing resistance groups, to disband and <b>disarm.</b> Pierlot, suspicious of the FI's motivatives, came into confrontation with the Communists. The three Communist ministers resigned from the government, and the party began agitating against it. Amid fears of a Communist coup d'état, parliament voted through emergency powers allowing the Gendarmerie to forcibly <b>disarm</b> the resistance though sporadic strikes continued. The government also voted through important social security reforms.|$|E

5|$|In May 1945, {{immediately}} after the Allied Victory in Europe Day, the 1st Airborne Division was sent to <b>disarm</b> and repatriate the 350,000-strong German occupation army in Norway.

5|$|In films, the gunslinger often {{possesses}} a nearly superhuman speed and skill with the revolver.

In the real world, however, gunmen who relied on flashy tricks and theatrics died quickly, and most gunslingers took a much more practical approach to their weapons. Real gunslingers did not shoot to <b>disarm</b> or to impress, but to kill.|$|E

50|$|The {{concept of}} armed and <b>disarmed</b> {{glycosyl}} donors {{refers to the}} increased reactivity of benzylated over benzoylated glycosyl donors, a phenomenon observed very early, and which originates from the greater electron-withdrawing capability of ester blocking groups over ether blocking groups. However, it was Bertram Fraser-Reid who realised that benzylated glycosyl donors can be activated when benzoylated are not, and invented the terms armed glycosyl donor to the former and <b>disarmed</b> glycosyl donor to the latter. He and his group showed that armed glycosyl donors could be coupled onto a glycosyl acceptor, {{that at the same}} time was a <b>disarmed</b> glycosyl donor, without self-coupling of the <b>disarmed</b> donor/acceptor. This methodology allowed him to perform a one-pot synthesis of a trisaccharide via the O-pentenyl method.|$|R

5|$|While these Irish bulls {{have led}} many writers to portray Roche as a buffoon, other biographers have {{interpreted}} them not as blunders, but as calculated attempts to <b>disarm</b> opposition to ministerial policies through humour. Roche ended {{his political career}} {{with the passage of}} the Act of Union 1800, which he supported. He chose not to attempt to enter the British House of Commons and retired on a government pension until his death, married but childless, in 1807.|$|E
5000|$|In September 1994, General Bowen {{was accused}} of factionalizing the AFL for power at the Accra Conference.

All the parties, except the AFL, wanted a power-sharing inclusion as a demand for them to be <b>disarmed</b> and demobilized.

5|$|Citizens {{reported}} to Virgil on the Cowboys' movements and their threats {{told him that}} Ike and Tom had left their livery stable and entered town while armed, {{in violation of the}} city ordinance. Virgil Earp was told by several citizens that the McLaurys and the Clantons had gathered on Fremont Street. Virgil decided he had to <b>disarm</b> the Cowboys. His decision to take action may have been influenced by the Cowboy's repeated threats to the Earps, their proximity to Holliday's room in Fly's boarding house, and their location on the route the Earps usually took to their homes two blocks further west on Fremont Street.|$|E
