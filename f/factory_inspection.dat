She advocated research aimed at determining the causes of poverty and crime, and she supported women's suffrage. She was a strong advocate of justice for immigrants, African Americans, and minority groups by becoming a chartered member of the NAACP.

25|$|With the four-party Michelsen's Cabinet {{appointed}} in 1905, Parliament voted {{to establish a}} Norwegian consular service. This {{was rejected by the}} king and on 7 June Parliament unanimously approved the dissolution of the union. In the following dissolution referendum, only 184 people voted in favor of a union. The government offered the Norwegian crown to Denmark's Prince Carl, who after a plebiscite became Haakon VII. The following ten years, Parliament passed a series of social reforms, such as sick pay, <b>factory</b> <b>inspection,</b> a ten-hour working day and worker protection laws. Waterfalls for hydroelectricity became an important resource in this period and the government secured laws to hinder foreigners from controlling waterfalls, mines and forests. Large industrial companies established in these years were Elkem, Norsk Hydro and Sydvaranger. The Bergen Line was completed in 1909, the Norwegian Institute of Technology was established the following year and women's suffrage was introduced in 1913—as the second country in the world. From the 1880s to the 1920s, Norwegians carried out a series of polar expeditions. The most important explorers were Fridtjof Nansen, Roald Amundsen and Otto Sverdrup. Amundsen's expedition in 1911 became the first to reach the South Pole.|$|E

50|$|Certification is {{the process}} by which a facility, product, service or system becomes tested or {{inspected}} and certified in conformity with the applicable standard or other recognized document(s).

The law also authorized <b>factory</b> <b>inspections</b> and expanded enforcement powers, set new regulatory standards for foods, and brought cosmetics and therapeutic devices under federal regulatory authority. This law, though extensively amended in subsequent years, remains the central foundation of FDA regulatory authority to the present day.|$|R

We are proud of our sustained efforts in terms of <b>factory</b> <b>inspections</b> and audits, and our teams worldwide work very closely with our suppliers and their factories to ensure compliance". As analyzed by CBS News, minimum daily wage in Sri Lanka was $2.68, which meant that workers were making double the standard.|$|R

50|$|Ivan Ivanovich Yanzhul (Иван Иванович Янжул; 1846-1914) was a {{professor}} of financial law at Moscow University who established the Russian state <b>factory</b> <b>inspection.</b> He helped enforce the first Russian labour code (1 June 1882) which provided a measure of protection for Russian factory workers. His job involved finding an industrial enterprise, gaining access to the premises and forcing the owner to halt illegal practices such as night child labor. His political views {{have been described as}} state socialism. Yanzhul was elected into the Russian Academy of Sciences in 1895. His memoirs were published in 2 volumes in 1910 and 1911.|$|E
25|$|As {{a move to}} {{increase}} factory and worker well-being, over 24 U.S. companies initiated by Wal-Mart and Gap Inc. have signed a pact. The pact holds them accountable to invest in <b>factory</b> <b>inspections</b> and upgrades and personally oversee the inspections of 600 of Bangladesh's clothing factories. Over 100 European brands have agreed to maintain their contracts with Bangladesh's factories and to pay {{a share of the}} upgrade and maintenance costs for a two-year period while overseeing the inspection of approximately 1,600 clothing factories. The National Government of Bangladesh pledged to inspect 1,200 more factories, which means that well over half of Bangladesh's 5,000 clothing factories will be inspected with these new regulations in the near future.|$|R
50|$|The French Resistance ran an {{extremely}} effective sabotage {{campaign against the}} Germans during World War II. Receiving their sabotage orders through messages over the BBC radio or by aircraft, the French used both passive and active forms of sabotage. Passive forms included losing German shipments and allowing poor quality material to pass <b>factory</b> <b>inspections.</b> Many active sabotage attempts were against critical rail lines of transportation. German records count 1,429 instances of sabotage from French Resistance forces between January 1942 and February 1943. From January through March 1944, sabotage accounted for three {{times the number of}} locomotives damaged by Allied air power. See also Normandy Landings for more information about sabotage on D-Day.|$|R

50|$|Osamu Suzuki {{built the}} Suzuki empire, in a {{conservative}} way, by looking across the globe for prospective buyers and by cutting costs sharply. He is stated {{to be concerned about}} wasteful spending and always on the look-out for ways to save costs. It is reported that once, during a routine <b>factory</b> <b>inspection,</b> he cited 215 cases of wasteful expenditure such as removing 1900 light bulbs to save 40,000 in electricity costs, asking the executives to take split trip railway tickets, rather than direct fare tickets, thereby saving 2 per ticket and changing the color of the factory floor to save paint.|$|E

Fellow engineer Cliff Huston came up with several procedures for adjusting the drives on the assembly line. When Apple sent an order into Shugart for more SA-390s, a Shugart engineer admitted that the disk drive manufacturer had been scamming Apple and that the SA-390s were actually reject SA-400s that failed to pass <b>factory</b> <b>inspection.</b> The idea was that Apple couldn't get the drives to work and would be forced to go back and purchase more expensive SA-400s.|$|E
50|$|During the Austro-Prussian War the Kingdom of Hanover was {{occupied}} in 1866 by Prussian troops, and Hanover became a Prussian province. For the administrative lawyer Theodor Lohmann this presented a major fork {{in his career}} path: In 1871 Lohmann and his young family moved to Berlin and he assumed {{a position in the}} Prussian Ministry of Commerce, where he worked on matters concerning industrial workers. In this capacity he participated in the drafting of a number of bills, including the amendment of the German Trade, Commerce and Industry Regulation Act, which introduced <b>factory</b> <b>inspection</b> in Prussia, and formed the basis for the current-day Gewerbeaufsicht ("industrial, commercial and business inspectorate").|$|E
500|$|Further {{evidence}} of the threat that lead posed to humans was discovered in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Mechanisms of harm were better understood, lead blindness was documented, and the element was phased out of public use in the United States and Europe. The United Kingdom introduced mandatory <b>factory</b> <b>inspections</b> in 1878 and appointed the first Medical Inspector of Factories in 1898; as a result, a 25-fold decrease in lead poisoning incidents from 1900 to 1944 was reported. The last major human exposure to lead was the addition of tetraethyllead to gasoline as an antiknock agent, a practice that originated in the United States in 1921. [...] It was phased out in the United States and the European Union by 2000. Most European countries banned lead paint—commonly used because of its opacity and water resistance—for interiors by 1930.|$|R
30|$|Since {{the idea}} that {{businesses}} {{have a responsibility to}} society beyond making profits for shareholders emerged around the 1960 s, the concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR) has been growing in its importance and significance (Carroll and Shabana 2010). This has resulted in companies experiencing a great deal of pressure from investors to adopt strong codes of conduct and regular <b>factory</b> <b>inspections</b> (Welford and Frost 2006). Following this trend, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (CTSCA) went into effect in 2012, requiring companies to post a visible CSR statement on their website regarding their practices concerning the prevention of slavery and/or trafficking of workers in their supply chains (CLI 2012). Since the CTSCA was formally introduced, many large apparel retailers, such as Levi’s, Wal-Mart, and Gap Inc., have enhanced CSR efforts to reduce unethical labor practices by closely monitoring their supply chains (Pickes and Zhu 2013).|$|R
50|$|Factory seconds, {{also known}} as factory rejects or simply seconds, are retail items which, through minor fault of manufacture, are sold {{to the public for}} a reduced rate, rather than being discarded.
