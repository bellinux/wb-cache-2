50|$|The Gold (Control) Act, 1968 is a {{repealed}} Act of the Parliament of India {{which was}} enacted to control sale and holding {{of gold in}} personal possession. However excessive demand for gold in India with negligible indigenous production is met with gold imports leading to drastic devaluation of Indian rupee and depletion of foreign exchange reserves to alarming levels.

50|$|From the {{beginning}} {{up to the}} mid-nineteenth century, the rulers of the country promoted national industries and trade to various measures of production, promotion and encouragement.

Prior to the establishment of British regime over India and entering a peace treaty with Tibet in 1904 AD, Nepal was interpreted as the main route to Tibet for external trade with other countries. But the treaty of 1904 AD facilitated the British to open a new route between India and Tibet through Chumbic Valley and the trade route treaty of 1923 AD between Nepal and British India, which was not in favour of Nepal and had very unfavourable effects both on industries and on flourishing trade of the country.|$|E

50|$|Similarly, MITI {{was forced}} to liberalize <b>import</b> <b>policies,</b> despite its {{traditional}} protectionist focus.

5000|$|Changing {{world events}} and {{differences}} of opinion within the Eisenhower administration soon altered the administration's cutbacks, however. First, while a [...] "trade not aid" [...] strategy required the U.S. to import more goods from its allies, the administration was unable to convince Congress to liberalize <b>import</b> <b>policy.</b> [...] On the contrary, the main foreign commercial measure taken at this time went in the other direction: the U.S. ramped up subsidies for exports of U.S. agricultural products. The 1953 amendment to the Mutual Security Act and the much larger Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954, known as [...] "PL-480," [...] (which had been pushed by Sen. Hubert Humphrey) allowed the U.S. Government to buy U.S. farm surpluses and sell them in developing countries for inconvertible local currencies. Much of PL-480's foreign-currency revenue was used to supplement development assistance budgets, thus creating {{a new form of}} economic assistance. PL-480 revenues in the first twenty years were sometimes huge and although PL-480 has become smaller it continues to provide resources to USAID for nutrition and disaster relief programs. Second, several factors arose that favored large-scale economic assistance to developing countries, especially in Asia. South Korea needed massive economic assistance after an armistice was finally signed in July 1953, and U.S. economic assistance to South Vietnam ramped up after the retreat of France in 1954. [...] On a global scale, the Cold War evolved (particularly after the death of Joseph Stalin in March 1953) in the direction of rivalry over influence in low-income countries who were seeking financing for their development initiatives. India was a particular case of a country where the U.S. felt it needed to provide economic assistance to balance the USSR's influence, even though India was not a U.S. military ally. [...] These considerations led to advocacy of expanded economic assistance by several voices within the Eisenhower administration: for example, by the FOA Director, former Minnesota Governor Harold Stassen, by an influential former advisor, C.D. Jackson, of the Time-Life publishing business (drawing on advice from MIT economists Millikan and Rostow), by the State Department, and by the National Security Council. [...] As a result, the USG decided in the course of 1954 to raise the profile of development assistance. [...] In June 1954, the USG raised the ExIm Bank’s lending authority from $4.5 billion to $5 billion. [...] Following Congress’s August 1954 decision that technical assistance for developing countries should be put back under the State Department, Pres. Eisenhower also separated it from military assistance by abolishing the MSA {{at the same time as}} he put the new International Cooperation Administration (ICA) in the State Department, in May 1955. In November 1954, the administration decided to endorse the proposed International Finance Corporation, which as part of the World Bank would raise funds from global capital markets to lend to the private sector in developing countries. The IFC idea had been discussed by the World Bank with the Truman administration since the late 1940s and had been supported by the 1951 report of the [...] "International Development Advisory Board" [...] established by Pres. Truman and chaired by Nelson Rockefeller. The IFC was finally established in 1956. [...] Pres. Eisenhower also created in December 1954 a Cabinet-level Council on Foreign Economic Policy, which in March 1955 recommended expanded soft loans for development. In April 1955, Pres. Eisenhower proposed a special economic fund for Asia.|$|E
