5|$|A secret brotherhood summons {{a dragon}} from its native dimension, {{so as to}} cause {{destruction}} and mayhem across the city of Ankh-Morpork. Rumours of the dragon's rampage across the city reaches Unseen University. Since the Archchancellor wishes the involvement {{of at least one}} wizard in the matter, Rincewind is summoned to <b>handle</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem.</b> After acquiring a book to learn what is needed to track the dragon to its lair, Rincewind searches the city for the various components needed to assemble a dragon detector and brings them back to the Archchancellor. After the Archancellor lets slip that the dragon's lair is stocked with gold, Rincewind snatches the dragon detector from him, searches the city, finds the lair, and takes all the gold within it. Just before he leaves, the dragon stops him and requests his aid in removing the brotherhood's hold upon her, claiming they are using her for evil and are planning to make her go on a major rampage.|$|E

500|$|To {{solve the}} problem of cloth-to-cloth collisions, Michael Kass, Pixar's senior scientist, was joined on Monsters, Inc. by David Baraff and Andrew Witkin and {{developed}} an algorithm they called [...] "global intersection analysis" [...] to <b>handle</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem.</b> The complexity of the shots in the film, including elaborate sets such as the door vault, required more computing power to render than any of Pixar's earlier efforts combined. The render farm in place for Monsters, Inc. was made up of 3500 Sun Microsystems processors, compared with 1400 for Toy Story 2 and only 200 for Toy Story.|$|E

Toronto street patrols began in July; however, the chapter had run into financial difficulties by September 2006. Some coverage has also analyzed the disproportionate coverage Creba's death received, compared to the similar deaths of numerous {{men and women of}} colour.|$|E

40|$|Many nonblocking {{algorithms}} {{have been}} proposed for shared queues. Previous studies indicate that link-based algorithms perform best. However, these algorithms have a memory management problem: a dequeued node can not be freed or reused without proper <b>handling.</b> <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> is usually overlooked; one just assumes {{the existence of a}} lower level mechanism, which takes care of all <b>the</b> details of <b>handling</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem.</b> Employing such a mechanism incurs significant overheads, and consequently the link-based queues may not perform as well as claimed. A new nonblocking queue algorithm based on a finite array is proposed in this paper. Comparing with the link-based algorithms, the new algorithm provides the same degree of concurrency without being subject to <b>the</b> memory <b>problem,</b> hence suggests a good performance...|$|R
2500|$|The United States House Committee on Territories {{recommended}} in February 1891 bypassing negotiations and annexing the Outlet, paying the Cherokees $1.25 an acre as a settlement. In the Oklahoma Territory, judges {{ruled that the}} Cherokees had no legal ownership of the Outlet. Cherokee delegates submitted documentation as proof of Outlet ownership. The Commission re-opened negotiations with the Cherokees on November 1891. The Commission presented its basic proposal to the tribe. The Cherokees requested the boundary of the Outlet be moved from the 96th to the 100th Meridian, {{and that the government}} estimate the acreage involved in the negotiations. [...] A main point of contention in the negotiations was the question of intruders, outside workers residing on Cherokee land, and the history of the United States failing to <b>handle</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem.</b> The Cherokee Nation presented a counter proposal that called for $3 an acre. Both Jerome and Sayre ridiculed the Cherokee proposal. The Commission threatened that Congress could remove the tribe from Trade and Intercourse acts. On December 11, the Commission and the tribe came close to terms, with the Cherokees asking for $2 an acre. E. C. Boudinot continued to debate with the Commission over details, and said the tribe had a copy of the 1889 Indian Office's instructions to the Commission.|$|E
