The flag is consistent with the last two flags of the 1864 issue, and as a group they reinforce the observation that decorating was done at the brigade level at this point in the war. The crossed cannon are unusual on an artillery flag, as they generally honor capture of enemy guns by infantry. The honor may have been extended for silencing enemy guns in an exchange, but is unknown before 1864. The flag is currently in the collection of the Old State House Museum, Little Rock, Arkansas.|$|R

30|$|Compared with [19] we {{also improve}} the Dinic {{algorithm}} {{according to the}} updating the residual graphs with a <b>key</b> <b>flag.</b> The <b>key</b> steps of Dinic algorithm are including: searching the augmenting paths through the DFS process in the inner graph; updating the residual graphs according to the known augmenting paths, and judging whether the blocking flow forms. Reference [19] constructed a new graph L in every updating of residual graphs. And it should copy the flow in the new graph L into the initial graph G continually. Therefore, it consumes extra computing resources and is time-consuming. So we add a flag to every edge of G. If the capacity in the edge is valid, the corresponding flag is set as TRUE, otherwise FALSE. The edge of which flag is FALSE is unable to be an augment path in the next iteration and the max flow only includes the edges of which flag is TRUE. Therefore, the execution efficiency of this algorithm has been improved.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss social enterprises, social {{entrepreneurship}} and social entrepreneurs. The paper draws on published work to <b>flag</b> <b>key</b> issues and discussion points that affect the clarity of the understanding. It aims to provide some greater insight and help both scholars and practitioners in their respective quests for understanding and improvement. The paper could further help people clarify what needs to be covered on courses and degrees in this subject area. Design/methodology/approach – The paper draws on the work of others and to this adds personal conclusions from both direct experience and observation. It attempts to deal with complex issues and tensions in a straightforward style and thus draw attention to key debates. Findings – The central argument is that if we see social enterprises, social entrepreneurship and social entrepreneurs bound together, operating with a common purpose and approach and pursuing the same ends, then we misunderstand this critically important sector. They are clearly linked but there are important distinctions. Research limitations/implications – This is a conceptual discussion paper. It is not directly a research paper and it is not written to either present the findings of a specific project or to inform a future research agenda. It could well-trigger ideas for researchers, however. Originality/value – The core material for this paper is not original but the presentation, synthesis and arguments offer a distinctive treatment. They should help clarify some of the debates and issues that hamper our ability to clearly understand the world of social enterprises...|$|E
40|$|Social {{entrepreneurship}} {{scholars are}} in the midst of a number of debates involving definitional and conceptual clarity, boundaries of the field, and a struggle to arrive at a set of relevant and meaningful research. The existence of social entrepreneurship-oriented social work practitioner can bring about new impetus to the approach in trying to find solutions to social problems faced by the community. The data for this study is derived from a research about social entrepreneurship conducted on social work practitioners in the Northern parts of Peninsular Malaysia. Though it is not written to either present the findings of the study, it could well-trigger ideas for researchers, however. The paper draws on the work of others and to this adds personal conclusions from the literatures and observations. It attempts to deal with complex issues and tensions in a straightforward style and thus draw attention to key debates. This conceptual discussion paper aims to contribute to the literature on social entrepreneurship. It draws on published work to <b>flag</b> <b>key</b> issues and discussion points that affect the clarity of the understanding. It aims to provide some greater insight and help both scholars and practitioners in their respective quests for understanding and improvement. This paper also discusses the meaning of social enterpreneurship and the differences between traditional or conventional entrepreneurship and the characteristics of social entrepreneurship. Social entrepreneurship has social responsibility, and its main concern is not economic profit. It is seen more as an agent of change than a profit-seeking enterprise. The goals of entrepreneurial are to ensure that issues of social and community problems can be resolved as well as to conduct activities to generate profits. The paper discusses the expected challenges faced by the entrepreneurs. Finally, the paper also provides some examples of successful social entrepreneur locally and internationally...|$|E

After a loss against the Yankees in another exhibition game on April 7 in front of about 1,000 fans on a very cold day, the first game that counted was played on April 9 against the Philadelphia Phillies, with Brooklyn losing, 1-0. When the park was opened, it was discovered that the <b>flag,</b> <b>keys</b> to the bleachers, and a press box had all been forgotten. The press box level was not added until 1929.

There was an open, concrete bleacher stand extending the rest of the way down the third base side to the outer wall, but no seating in left field or centerfield. The right field wall was fairly high due to the short foul line (around 300 feet) necessitated by the street immediately beyond it, but had no screen or scoreboard at first. The ballpark was built on a sloping piece of ground. The right field wall made up the difference, as the right field corner was above street level.

40|$|An ‘Advance Decision’ is {{a legally}} binding record (given {{statutory}} force by the Mental Capacity Act 2005) of the treatments that someone wishes to refuse {{if they lose}} capacity to make such decisions for themselves in future. The Mental Capacity Act 2005 refers to them as ‘Advance Decisions’ (s. 24 (1)) : given widespread confusion about the terminology associated with end-of-life planning tools, we have often opted in this report {{to use the term}} ‘Advance Decisions to Refuse Treatment’ (ADRTs), Barriers to uptake of ADRTs include misunderstanding about what is involved; scepticism about whether they will be respected; and the mistaken belief that an ADRT is unnecessary if people have already informed family members or healthcare professionals of their wishes. There is widespread misunderstanding about the power of family members to give or withhold consent for adult relatives, and misinformation and confusion about the distinctive legal status of ADRTs (compared with other advance planning tools). This report examines the legal position and identifies ways of increasing awareness and uptake of ADRTs in Wales. It suggests that the Welsh Government has a key role to play, alongside partner organisations such as charities, in promoting better understanding of ADRTs and ensuring that people’s right to refuse treatment is respected through: -	Public education, media engagement and cultural events to encourage people to plan for potential future loss of capacity; -	De-bunking the myth that ‘next of kin’ have decision-making powers and correcting official forms that may mislead people about the legal status of their own or a relative’s expressed wishes; -	Facilitating access to well designed ADRT forms/guidance and skilled support, both for the general population and for particular groups; -	Normalising ADRTs (e. g. offering registration when patients sign up with a GP); -	Training relevant practitioners to ensure that they understand what ADRTs are (and when they are valid and applicable), are able to provide appropriate guidance or referral, and can act in accordance with the law concerning them; -	Creating an All-Wales national repository – <b>flagging</b> <b>key</b> emergency decisions and ensuring accessibility of full ADRT documentation...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{forwards}} a performative {{reading of}} asbestos in economies of disposal. It argues that materials {{need to be}} thought through transformative states, not just stable states, and that materials’ performativity varies according to material states. As a radical intervention in form, demolition is one such transformative state, which disturbs and animates materials. Relatively unconsidered in the academic literature, demolition is argued to be the means to an endless source of surprise in the built environment {{as well as a}} singular and multiple practice entailing the dissolution of form, the purposeful reduction and dismantling of large-scale objects, salvage and remediation work, and a host of micropractices, including cutting, tearing, sorting, and separating. The paper illustrates asbestos’ interventions in demolition activities, using as its exemplar the case of ship breaking in the EU. More broadly, the paper works with asbestos to show that material properties are not fixed but processual, relational, and distributed. The paper also <b>flags</b> some <b>key</b> questions for the emergent debate on vital materialisms, highlighting the difficulties materials like asbestos pose for thinking through enchantment and generosity; the importance of thinking a vital materialism through remediation as well as salvage; and the need to extend an ethics founded on generosity to encompass respect, humility, responsibility, and surprise towards those materials that most threaten human life. ...|$|R
