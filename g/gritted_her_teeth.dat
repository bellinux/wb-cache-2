50|$|The final was a {{microcosm}} of these championships. East vs West. The American Mary Decker vs a strong Soviet squad. Decker was so dominant in domestic competition, her races were won from the gun, so she was not well practiced in running elbow to elbow as the Soviets and other Europeans were highly skilled in the art. True to her form, Decker took the lead from the gun, with a large pack surrounding her. As the last lap approached Zamira Zaytseva moved onto Decker's shoulder, immediately to her outside. On the last lap, the pace quickened but Decker refused to let Zaytseva get all the way past. Finally with 200 metres to go, Zaytseva sprinted ahead and gained a couple of steps. Decker looked dejected, unable to keep {{up all the way}} through the turn but clearly ahead of Yekaterina Podkopayeva who was battling to stay ahead of Ravilya Agletdinova. On the final straight, Decker moved into lane 2 and started to make a run at Zaytseva, gaining slightly. About 50 metres out, Decker checked over her shoulder to see if any competition was approaching from the rear. Agletdinova-Kotovich was making a run at Podkopayeva several metres back but neither was gaining on Decker. Decker <b>gritted</b> <b>her</b> <b>teeth</b> and noticeably accelerated gaining on Zaytseva. As Decker moved past Zaytseva tried to accelerate. In the effort she started to lose her balance. Two awkward steps of flailing and reminiscent of Yevgeniy Arzhanov a decade earlier, Zaytseva dived for the finish line from four meters out. Clearly beaten by this point, Zaytseva executed a face plant a metre from the finish line and rolled across the line in second. Podkopayeva held off her teammate for bronze. The powerful Soviets all finished in the top four, but Decker was number one.|$|E
60|$|Thus adjured, Carley did {{her best}} under adverse circumstances. And she was <b>gritting</b> <b>her</b> <b>teeth</b> and complimenting herself when {{she arrived at the}} task of pulling on her boots. They were damp and her feet {{appeared}} to have swollen. Moreover, her ankles were sore. But she accomplished getting into them at the expense of much pain and sundry utterances more forcible than elegant. Glenn brought her warm water, a mitigating circumstance. The morning was cold and thought of that biting desert water had been trying.|$|R
60|$|She was {{preparing}} herself for a nervous break-down, {{and she knew}} it. First came a fluttering of the eyeballs, so that she was compelled to close her eyes for relief. A little later the eyelids were afflicted by a nervous twitching {{that she could not}} control. To add to the strain, she could not forget the tragedy. She remained as close to the horror as on the first morning when the unexpected stalked into the cabin and took possession. In her daily ministrations upon the prisoner she was forced to <b>grit</b> <b>her</b> <b>teeth</b> and steel herself, body and spirit.|$|R
6000|$|And like a fury she dashed {{upon the}} scene. She was <b>gritting</b> <b>her</b> <b>teeth,</b> making frightful grimaces, snarling, uttering sharp and {{continuous}} cries {{that sounded like}} [...] "kh-ah! kh-ah!" [...] So sudden and formidable was her appearance that the boar involuntarily bunched himself together on the defensive and bristled as she swerved toward him. Then she swerved toward me. She had quite taken the breath out of him. I knew just {{what to do in}} that moment of time she had gained. I leaped to meet her, catching her about the waist and holding on hand and foot--yes, by my feet; I could hold on by them as readily as by my hands. I could feel in my tense grip the pull of the hair as her skin and her muscles moved beneath with her efforts.|$|R
2500|$|Being {{the son of}} Ali Bourguiba and Fattouma Khefacha, who was 40 when he was born, Bourguiba {{stated that}} his mother was ashamed to {{conceive}} a child at that late age, her last pregnancy being seven years old at the time. Meanwhile, his father wondered whether he could raise his son at this old age. Habib Bourguiba later described his birth in these words: [...] "When she conceived me, it was for her, the unfortunate, a catastrophe. She was already forty years old. Many of her pregnancies weakened her. I was told that when she gave birth to me, she was so ashamed of having a child at that age that she stifled her cries for deliverance while <b>gritting</b> <b>her</b> <b>teeth</b> with a towel placed in her mouth. Nevertheless, she was relieved to give birth to a boy, avoiding the catastrophe that would have been that of a girl. That was how Habib Bourguiba, last of his siblings was born.|$|R
60|$|The {{last year}} of her college career was {{wheeling}} slowly round. She could see ahead her examination and her departure. She had the ash of disillusion <b>gritting</b> under <b>her</b> <b>teeth.</b> Would the next move turn out the same? Always the shining doorway ahead; and then, upon approach, always the shining doorway was a gate into another ugly yard, dirty and active and dead. Always {{the crest of the}} hill gleaming ahead under heaven: and then, from the top of the hill only another sordid valley full of amorphous, squalid activity.|$|R
2500|$|Lewis Corner of Digital Spy {{gave the}} song a {{positive}} review stating: [...] "Truth be told, it's quite refreshing {{for an artist}} to embrace their perceived public image, but the joke is really on us. Why? Because it's Cher Lloyd who has the last laugh with another hit on her hands." [...] X. Alexander of Idolator said [...] "Instead of blasting us with that 'Swagger Jagger', she's coming at us with the uber-catchy 'Want U Back' — a good choice, since we haven't {{been able to get}} it out of our heads since we first heard it." [...] Virgin Media's Matthew Horton wrote that the song has [...] "dynamic catchy bounce." [...] David Griffiths from 4Music praised the track, writing: [...] "It might not sound a million miles away from Miley Cyrus' 'Party in the USA', but it's got Cher's stamp all over it. From her dead pan delivery ('Please, this ain't even jealousy, she ain't got nothin' on me') to her screams of frustration peppered throughout the track, this has the potential to be an enormous global hit." [...] Bradley Stern from [...] "MuuMuse" [...] commented: [...] "It is one of the album’s catchiest, cutest moments–even if Lloyd’s <b>gritting</b> <b>her</b> <b>teeth</b> and clenching <b>her</b> fists with rage."

And now you’re doing them with her?!' Lloyd sings incredulously on the bouncing electro-pop beat, dissing the chick’s jeans and denying all charges of jealousy in the process." ...|$|R
50|$|In the {{penultimate}} race ever in Centennial Stadium, Olabisi Afolabi put Nigeria out in front, with Merlene Frazer {{very close}} at the handoff. Fatima Yusuf extended the Nigerian lead {{out to about}} 8 metres, Handing off in sixth place, Maicel Malone brought USA into second place, but Russian Svetlana Goncharenko, starting her leg in fifth place, followed Malone and overtook her on the final straight. With Nigeria comfortably in front, the second exchange saw the field bunch as the next six teams exchanged {{within a couple of}} steps of one another. Coming out of the scrum, Russia maintained second place followed by USA, while Cuba's Surella Morales found herself flat on her face {{before the end of the}} first turn. Down the backstretch Kim Graham ran USA past Russia's Yekaterina Kulikova, while Jamaica's Juliet Campbell ran wide to stay out of trouble, but opened the door for Germany's Anja Rücker to join the chase. Through the second turn, back from her drug suspension, Charity Opara's lead began to shrink as Graham began to separate from the pack. Under the challenge, Opara began to tie up, Graham cruised by to hand off to Jearl Miles with a 4-metre advantage. Nigeria's bronze medalist Falilat Ogunkoya chased Miles leaving Jamaica's hurdle gold medalist Deon Hemmings to battle Germany's drug cheat Grit Breuer. Campbell closed quickly to give Hemmings the edge over Breuer, but Ogunkoya made it clear she was not going to battle for bronze, putting a gap on Hemmings and Breuer quickly from the pass. Ogunkoya's focus was on Miles, gaining steadily until the final straight, reducing the gap to less than a metre. Miles was <b>gritting</b> <b>her</b> <b>teeth,</b> trying to hold off Ogunkoya. Coming off the turn, she looked to be struggling as Ogunkoya gained, Miles drifting into lane 2 to give Ogunkoya the direct route to victory. But Miles didn't let her by, holding the edge all the way to the finish line for American gold. Behind them, Hemmings held the advantage over Breuer until the final straight, then Breuer unleashed a sprint that left Hemmings and was nipping at Ogunkoya's heels, giving the German team the bronze.|$|R
