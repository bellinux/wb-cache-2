500|$|A short {{part that}} Chastain had filmed {{opposite}} Ben Affleck in Terrence Malick's To the Wonder (2012) was edited {{out of the}} final film, and due to scheduling conflicts, she {{dropped out of the}} action films Oblivion and Iron Man 3 (both 2013). She instead made her Broadway debut in a revival of the 1947 play The Heiress, playing the role of Catherine Sloper, a naive young girl who transforms into a powerful woman. Chastain was initially reluctant to accept the role fearing the high anxiety she had faced during her early stage performances. She ultimately agreed to the part after finding a connection to Sloper, saying: [...] "she’s painfully uncomfortable and <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> that". The production was staged at the Walter Kerr Theatre from November 2012 to February 2013. Brantley was disappointed with Chastain's performance, saying that she was [...] "oversignaling the thoughts within" [...] and that her delivery of dialogue was sometimes flat.|$|E

On 20 February 2008 he announced the 2007–08 season {{would be his last}} as a player, although Bradford City would keep his registration, and instead he would join the club's coaching staff. Wetherall said: [...] "I was becoming increasingly frustrated at not being able {{to do the things that}} <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to do.

[...] Bradford fans held a special day to celebrate Wetherall's career, when they took banners and wore fancy dress and laboratory coats during the club's 1–1 draw with Rotherham United on 22 March 2008. In his penultimate month as a footballer, Wetherall was also named the League Two fans' player of the month by the Professional Footballers' Association.

Love is seen playing her Jazzmaster in the music video for [...] "Miss World". Earlier in Hole's career, between 1989 and 1991, Love primarily played a Rickenbacker 425 because she [...] "preferred the 3/4 neck", but she destroyed the guitar onstage at a 1991 concert opening for The Smashing Pumpkins. In the mid-1990s, she often played a guitar made by Mercury, an obscure company that manufactured custom guitars, {{as well as a}} Univox Hi-Flier. Fender's Vista Venus, designed by Love in 1998, was partially inspired by Rickenbacker guitars as well as her Mercury. During her 2010 and more recent tours, Love {{has played a}} Rickenbacker 360 onstage. She has referred to herself as [...] "a shit guitar player", further commenting in a 2014 interview: [...] "I can still write a song, but [...] sounds like shit... <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a good rhythm player but I am no longer dependable."

500|$|Erica Hahn was {{initially}} {{conceived as a}} minor character, and occasional guest-star rival of Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington). The character first appeared in three episodes of the show's second season, followed by another two episodes of the show's third season. Discussing whether she thought Hahn might become a main character after her season three appearance, Smith has stated that at the time: [...] "I didn't really {{think it was going}} to work out", joking that [...] "After every time I would hope that they would call and also hope not too– kind of like when <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> single." [...] However, following Washington's departure from the show, Hahn was brought back as a main character in the show's fourth season, replacing Burke as Seattle Grace's Head of Cardiothoracic Surgery. Smith has said that she was not expecting her character to be introduced to the show full-time, as she [...] "didn't want to be disappointed if it didn't happen." [...] She has stated that a deciding factor in her return was the opportunity it presented to explore the character in greater depth, explaining: [...] "When I work on something that has a beginning, middle and end, I can create an arc. With Dr. Hahn, I need to figure out who she is". Researching the role, Smith watched a heart surgery performed, and liaised with the surgical nurses employed by Grey's Anatomy producers to maintain realism in the show's operating room. She dubbed this research stressful, stating that [...] "I got very neurotic about the fact that I didn’t go to medical school. I’m not actually a doctor", explaining; [...] "I {{have no idea what it}} really is to be a surgeon and yet I have to act like I am really good at it.

40|$|POLICY The University of Houston <b>is</b> {{committed}} <b>to</b> {{providing a}} professional working and learning environment free from sexual harassment. Sexual harassment {{is a form}} of sex discrimination and is illegal. Sexual harassment on a university campus most often exploits a relationship between individuals of unequal power and authority (as, for example, between an employee and supervisor or between a student and teacher), but may also occur between student peers or employees of equal rank. At a university, sexual harassment also constitutes unprofessional conduct which compromises the university's commitment to the integrity of the learning process. As such, the University of Houston will not tolerate any form of sexual harassment. Failure to investigate allegations of sexual harassment or failure to take timely corrective action is considered a violation of the University's sexual harassment policy and may also violate federal and state laws. Furthermore, this institution <b>is</b> committed <b>to</b> providing the training necessary to educate the staff, faculty, and students to understand and respect these policies and procedures. DEFINITION Sexual harassment consists of the following: 1. unwelcome sexual advances, 2. requests for sexual favors, 3. verbal and written comments of a sexual nature, 4. and/or physical conduct of a sexual nature; when such conduct: a. Is made, either explicitly or implicitly, a term or condition of instruction, employment, or participation in a university activity; or b. <b>Is</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a basis for evaluation in making academic or personnel decisions affecting an individual; or c. Has the effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive university environment; or has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an individual's employment or learning.
