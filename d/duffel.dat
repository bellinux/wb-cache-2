Groza was mainly a placekicker in his first two years with the Browns, but he played a big part in the team's early success.

Groza sprained his ankle in the game and missed three field goals, but Cleveland won 14–9. Behind a powerful offense led by Graham, Motley and Lavelli, the Browns finished the 1947 season with a 12–1–1 record and made it back to the championship game.

The importance of the male genitalia for arriving at a more natural definition of these genera, was already recognized by Kato (1944 a) when he created Orientopsaltria for two species of Cosmopsaltria with rounded pygofer lobes, C. duarum (Walker, 1857), and C. jacoona Distant, 1888.

Six-minute walk test in {{patients}} with Down syndrome: validity and reproducibility. Arch Phys Med Rehabil 2009; 90 : 1423 - 7. Objectives: To examine {{the validity of the}} six-minute walk test (6 MWT) as a tool to evaluate functional exercise performance {{in patients}} with Down syndrome (DS). Design: Comparison of the six-minute walk distance (6 MWD) in 2 distinct groups of DS patients: with and without severe cardiac disease. To test reproducibility, a group of patients with DS performed the 6 MWT twice. Setting: Tertiary referral centers for patients with congenital heart defects and outpatient clinics for people with intellectual disabilities. Participants: Adult patients with DS with (n= 29) and without (n= 52) severe cardiac disease categorized by cardiac echocardiography. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measure: Distance walked on the 6 MWT. Results: The mean 6 MWD in the group with severe cardiac disease was 289 +/- 104 m and in the group without severe cardiac disease 280 +/- 104 m (P=. 70). Older age, female sex, and severe level of intellectual disability were all found to be independently and significantly correlated with a lower 6 MWD (r=. 67, P <. 001). The paired 6 MWD was not significantly different (310 +/- 88 m vs 317 +/- 85 m; P=. 40) in patients who performed the 6 MWT twice. The coefficient of variation was 11 %. Conclusions: The 6 MWD between the 2 groups was not significantly different. However, the walking distance inversely correlated with the level of intellectual disability. Therefore, the 6 MWT is not a valid test to examine cardiac restriction in adult patients with D...|$|R

PAH is classified by the 2009 updated clinical classification of pulmonary hypertension {{and a major}} subgroup is PAH due to congenital heart disease (CHD) with systemic-to-pulmonary shunt. CHD-PAH {{is a result of}} systemic-to-pulmonary shunting and chronic increased flow that ultimately results in adaptations of pulmonary vasculature and endothelial dysfunction. The advanced stage is called Eisenmenger syndrome which forms a small percentage (1 %) of all CHD patients. Therapies targeted on PAH symptoms are called primary therapy for PAH, but most CHD-PAH patients progress to advanced therapy which is directed at the PAH itself. In CHD-PAH, advanced therapies are extensively investigated for all three major pathways: endothelin- 1 receptor antagonists such as bosentan, prostanoids such as epoprostenol and phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors such as sildenafil. Endpoints in most trials were catheterization hemodynamics, World Health Organization functional class, six-minute walking distance and patient-focused outcomes, based on quality of life questionnaires and Borg dyspnea index. The BREATHE- 5 and EARLY study were two important randomized controlled trials showing efficacy of bosentan at short follow-up. Moreover in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome, one recent survival retrospective study with majority of patients on bosentan showed strong survival benefit over conservative therapy. A diversity of prospective cohort and retrospective studies were performed but all with limited data, due to small numbers and heterogeneity of underlying CHD diagnoses. Further larger studies are needed to determine optimal treatment for adults with CHD-PAH. This review focuses on bosentan in CHD-PAH. In particular, we discuss outcome of various clinical trials and compare efficacy and safety of bosentan to other advanced therapies.
