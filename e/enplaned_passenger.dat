The Team updated the Financial Benchmarking {{analysis}} in Ricondo report, using comparable airports to forecast operational metrics {{for a new}} San Diego airport. Using the forecasted operational metrics, the net present value (NPV) of the cash flows {{for the first five}} years was calculated. The construction and development costs were updated and forecasted out to 2030 for the five sites in the Decision Document. The analysis of opportunity costs from not replacing San Diego International Airport (SDIA) was updated to current dollars. SDIA operates at high efficiency levels compared to other large airports. They boast one of the best records for on-time departures & arrivals. Their average airfares are moderate and competitive. They charge airlines a comparatively low cost per <b>enplaned</b> <b>passenger</b> (CPEP). However, no amount of efficiency can compensate for the limitations of a single, 9400 ft. runway on 661 bounded acres. SDIA will reach maximum operational capacity of 275, 000 operations around the years 2033 - 2034. This is at least 11 to 18 years later than Hamilton, Rabinovitz, & Alschuler (HR&A) predicted in their 2001 ???The Impacts of Constrained Air Transportation Capacity on the San Diego Regional Economy??? (ICATCSD). SDIA will reach maximum capacity for air cargo tonnage in 2013. This is 6 years later than HR&A predicted in their 2001 ICATCSD Opportunity costs to the San Diego region in the year 2030 if no action is taken would be: 3. 9 to 7. 2 Billion dollars in lost Gross Regional Product (GRP) (1997), 20 to 38, 000 jobs lost, and 1. 7 to 3. 1 Billion dollars of personal income lost (1997). Construction costs are increasing at an exponential rate, leading to a development cost nearly 4 times higher in 2030. Construction costs have seen a sharper rise in skilled labor costs compared to materials costs. On the revenue side, baseline NPV of cash flows for 2025 - 2030 of new airport operations is 33 million (in 2013 dollars). Since 2008, San Diego's economy has been recovering from the global recession. The San Diego economy is currently growing faster than the California average, but slower than the national economy. San Diego???s population is also growing at a very slow pace, due to cost of living and doing business being high. The following are economic justifications for building a new airport: tap into international market, continue benefitting from cargo market, capitalize on industry trend toward larger jets, increased number of longer routes, increased diversification of airlines, increased business travel, and increased tourism travel. A new San Diego airport will have the best chance for success if they work with the airlines to leverage their common interests in order to optimize return on investment.

Our de-lay estimates are achieved using U. S. Department of Transportation data from 2007, and one quarter of booking data purchased from a large legacy carrier to validate our results. The results suggest that the rule has been a highly effective deterrent for airlines to keep tarmac times under three hours.

40|$|At a {{national}} level {{it is common to}} express the amount of air travel {{in terms of the number}} of revenue passenger miles flown or the number of <b>enplaned</b> <b>passengers.</b> This provides a way to resolve the difficulty of how to aggregate measures of air travel in many different markets of many different distances. However, information about the distribution of trip lengths is lost in the process. This information is of interest for a number of reasons. The type of aircraft that is most appropriate for different markets depends on the distances involved. The length of the trip is also likely to influence traveler behavior in terms of the importance of convenient access to airports, frequency of service, and willingness to make intermediate stops. A related issue is how the cost of air travel varies with the length of the trip. The cost structure of airline service is such that the cost per mile flown reduces with increasing trip length, and this is reflected in typical airline fares. However, other factors also influence fares, such as airline competition, and the fare structure may or may not reflect the costs involved for trips of different lengths. Therefore, this study examines the distribution of trip lengths and associated average fares in the U. S. domestic air travel market. For the purpose of this study, trip length is defined as the direct distance between the origin and destination of a trip. In practice, passengers may fly via intermediate stops, as when they take a connecting flight through an airline hub, and this will generally increase the distance flown. However, this aspect of trip length is not considered here. Air Transportation, Economics, Logistics...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{long-term}} prospects for airport development {{between now and}} the middle of the 21 st Century. It tries to identify both key issues and the range of probable outcomes. It draws on knowledge of the past, analysis of the future prospects, and an appreciation of the limits to extrapolation. It will be revised with the help of numerous experts in the field between now and Spring 2000. It suggests scenarios that need to be considered. Since specific predictions of future events are "always wrong " due to inevitable changes in circumstances, it is preferable to think about the range of probable developments rather than improbable specifics. Recognition of the possible eventualities enables strategic thinkers to build flexibility into their plans so that they can smoothly accommodate to what actually happens. The scenarios focus on three main elements: 1. The levels of traffic [...] passengers, cargo and aircraft; 2. The infrastructure that will be provided to accommodate these loads; and 3. The way these facilities will be managed. Traffic: Future levels of traffic are perhaps most questionable. While many Americans rarely if ever fly and the domestic market is far from saturated, there are many reasons to think that the rate of growth of US domestic traffic may continue its long-term decline. As seemingly small differences in assumptions about the rate of growth lead over a generation to enormous differences in totals, we must be very tentative about future levels of traffic. For example, by 2025 the number of <b>enplaned</b> <b>passengers</b> in the United States could be two or even three times the current 600 million a year.

40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} {{effectiveness}} of the 2010 Tarmac Delay Rule from a passenger - centric point of view. The Tarmac Delay Rule stipulates that aircraft lift-off, or an opportunity for passengers to deplane, must occur no later than three hours after the cabin door closure at the gate of the departure airport; and that an opportunity for passengers to deplane must occur no later than three hours after the touchdown at the arrival airport. The Tarmac Delay Rule aims to protect <b>enplaned</b> <b>passengers</b> on commercial aircraft from excessively long delays on the tarmac upon taxi-out or taxi-in, and monetarily penalizes airlines that violate the stipulated three-hour tarmac time limit. Comparing the actual flight schedule and delay data after the Tarmac Delay Rule was in effect with that before, we find that the Rule has been highly effective in reducing the frequency of occurrence of long tarmac times. However, another significant effect of the rule has been the rise in flight cancellation rates. Cancellations result in passengers requiring rebooking, and often lead to extensive delay in reaching their final destinations. Using an algorithm to estimate passenger delay, we quantify delays to passengers in 2007, before the Tarmac Delay Rule was enacted, and compare these delays to those estimated for hypothetical scenarios with the Tarmac Delay Rule in effect for that same year. Our delay estimates are calculated using U. S. Department of Transportation data from 2007. Through our results and several sensitivity analyses, we show that the overall impact of the current Tarmac Delay Rule is a significant increase in passenger delays, especially for passengers scheduled to travel on the flights which are at risk of long tarmac delays. We evaluate the impacts on passengers of a number of rule variations, including changes to the maximum time on the tarmac, and variations in that maximum by time-of-day. Through extensive scenario analyses, we conclude that a better balance between the conflicting objectives of reducing the frequency of long tarmac times and reducing total passenger delays can be achieved through {{a modified version of the}} existing rule. This modified version involves increasing the tarmac time limit to 3. 5 hours and only applying the rule to flights with planned departure times before 5 pm. Finally, in order to implement the Rule more effectively, we suggest the tarmac time limit to be defined in terms of the time when the aircraft begin returning to the gate instead of being defined in terms of the time when passengers are allowed to deplane.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{pervasive}} trends in the global airline industry {{over the past few}} three decades has been the rapid development of low cost carriers (LCCs). Australia has not been immune to this trend. Following deregulation of Australia&rsquo;s domestic air travel market in the 1990 s, a number of LCCs have entered the market, and these carriers have now captured around 31 per cent of the market. Australia&rsquo;s LCCs require reliable and accurate passenger demand forecasts as part of their fleet, network, and commercial planning and for scaling investments in fleet and their associated infrastructure. Historically, the multiple linear regression (MLR) approach has been the most popular and recommended method for forecasting airline passenger demand. In more recent times, however, new advanced artificial intelligence-based forecasting approaches &ndash; artificial neural networks (ANNs), genetic algorithm (GA), and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) - have been applied in a broad range of disciplines. In light of the critical importance of passenger demand forecasts for airline management, as well as the recent developments in artificial intelligence-based forecasting methods, the key aim of this thesis was to specify and empirically examine three artificial intelligence-based approaches (ANNs, GA and ANFIS) as well as the MLR approach, in order to identify the optimum model for forecasting Australia&rsquo;s domestic LCCs demand. This {{is the first time that}} such models &ndash; <b>enplaned</b> <b>passengers</b> (PAX) and revenue passenger kilometres performed (RPKs) &ndash; have been proposed and tested for forecasting Australia&rsquo;s domestic LCCs demand. The results show that of the four modeling approaches used in this study that the new, and novel, ANFIS approach provides the most accurate, reliable, and highest predictive capability for forecasting Australia&rsquo;s LCCs demand. A second aim of the thesis was to explore the principal determinants of Australia&rsquo;s domestic LCCs demand in order to achieve a greater understanding of the factors which influence air travel demand. The results show that the primary determinants of Australia&rsquo;s domestic LCCs demand are real best discount airfare, population, real GDP, real GDP per capita, unemployment, world jet fuel prices, real interest rates, and tourism attractiveness. Interestingly three determinants, unemployment, tourism attractiveness, and real interest rates, which have not been empirically examined in any previously reported study of Australia&rsquo;s domestic LCCs demand, proved to be important predictor variables of Australia&rsquo;s domestic LCCs demand. The thesis also found that Australia&rsquo;s LCCs have increasingly embraced a hybrid business model over the past decade. This strategy is similar to LCCs based in other parts of the world. The core outcome of this research, the fact that modelling based on artificial intelligence approaches is far more effective than the traditional models prescribed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), means that future work is essential to validate this. From an academic perspective, the modelling presented in this study offers considerable promise for future air travel demand forecasting. The results of this thesis provide new insights into LCCs passenger demand forecasting methods and can assist LCCs executives, airports, aviation consultants, and government agencies with a variety of future planning considerations...|$|R
40|$|A {{multiple}} regression analysis of domestic and local airline indirect costs was carried out to formulate cost estimating equations for airline indirect costs. Data from CAB and FAA sources covering the years 1962 - 66 was used, and the costs were broken down into the classification of the uniform system of accounts Form 41, used by the airlines in reporting to the CAB. Thus regression equations were found for 1) annual system expenses in the categories such as Passenger Servicing, Traffic Servicing, Promotion and Sales, General and Administrative, etc. {{as well as an}} overall indirect operating cost; and 2) annual station expenses where the Aircraft and Traffic Servicing expenses for individual stations are examined. A stepwise regression technique is used to select the best combinations of independent variables for the equations.

40|$|Introduction: 1. 1 The Future of the Aviation System. It {{is nothing}} if not presumptuous to look ahead twenty years in any phase of human activity. This seems {{particularly}} true in civil aviation where the certificated airlines are in the throes of transition from economic regulation to a free market system. Furthermore, while in the past forecasters could count on the number of players in the game remaining constant (subject to elimination by merger), currently new airlines are born every day, at least on paper. The friendly old aviation gang has broken up, with {{the rules of the game}} constantly changing. Thus at first glance an attempt now to predict what will happen in the future appears whimsical, if not downright foolish. However, this inquiry concerns not just the airlines, but aviation. Here that much-misused and maligned word, system, is justified. Airlines depend on many other parts: manufacturers build their aircraft, airports provide space to land them, and the air traffic control system keeps them apart. Then-there is general aviation, by some measures the largest part of the system. The flying farmer in Kansas views the big jets which occasionally appear high overhead as simply faster and more expensive Greyhounds; looking at clear and empty skies over his homestead, talk about the aviation system straining at capacity appears ludicrous. One possible approach to the future is to dissect the system and look at the components. The objection to this tack is the interrelationship of the parts if one part moves, then it affects most, if not all, of the other parts. [...] The problem is equivalent to solving a set of simultaneous equations (with possibly time-varying coefficients). For example, if some airports reach saturation, the effects on the system will appear in both the short term and the long term. In the short term, traffic may shift to other (nearby) airports; general aviation aircraft may be banned; larger aircraft may replace smaller aircraft, keeping operations almost constant while providing extra lift; or operations may simply remain at the saturation level. In the long term, more or longer runways may be added to the airports; larger and more sophisticated aircraft may be designed by the manufacturers; technological improvements in the ATC system may provide more airport and airway capacity. Furthermore, the outside world is interacting with the system and affecting its behavior. A slump in the economy leads to a downturn in travel, as fewer businessmen fly as well as fewer vacationers even the deepest discounts cannot attract the public when consumer confidence is down. [...] And in the long run, changes in lifestyles, population make-up, telecommunications, etc., alter travel patterns as well. Since the aviation system has reacted to internal and external forces over time, a plausible approach to the future is to look back and search for potential cause-effect relationships. Then, if long term trends exist inside and outside the system. and links between them are identified, pictures of the future can be drawn. These certainly will not be predictions, but rather possible evolutions of the system. Many alternative futures are possible, depending on the action taken by different persons both inside and outside the aviation system. With some luck the futures that will be presented here will seem credible, even if not highly probable, given the nature of the task. At the least, they are intended to stimulate thought about the likelihood of the outcomes they portray. Consequently, to planners concerned with aviation, they may provide guidelines for possible initiatives in research and technology. * The author would like to acknowledge the guidance and assistance of the contract monitors, Messrs Robert Letchworth and Matt Winston of NASA Langley Research Center. 1. 2 The Aviation System: Definitions and Measures The aviation system is sufficiently complex so that no single statistic can provide a comprehensive overview. However, there are measures of activity which indicate how fast the system is changing and some key variables which explain how the system functions. There are also constraints (or potential constraints) on the system (or various subsystems), and linkages between constraints and key variables. These constraints may or may not be quantifiable, such as regulatory changes, aircraft noise limitations, and airport curfews. It is possible to classify the subsystems of aviation in many ways the exact designation is not important if no major components are lost. [...] Most simply, the system can be split into the users of the system and the providers of the service. The users are general aviation and public-for-hire carriers (scheduled and unscheduled, a distinction which is gradually being blurred). The suppliers of the service are airports, airways, the ATC system, and the aerospace industry which builds the vehicles which flow over the system. More detail is provided in Figure 1. 1. Different classifications are possible. One used often (Schriever and Seifert, 1967) splits the system into air vehicle; air traffic control; and airports and terminals. Another widely used breakdown (FAA, 1967) is into air carriers, GA, fuel consumption, aircraft technology, air cargo, aviation safety and complementary and competing modes. Yet another way (CARD, 1971) is to look at the system from a mission point of view (commercial passenger service, air cargo, GA) and a system element point of view (air vehicles, ATC, airports, complementary surface transporta- tion). It is apparent that classifications and their concomitant emphases depend to a large degree on who is looking at the system and for what reason. Figure 1. 1 shows the complete system. Some parts of it will receive little analysis in this study: military components (since the emphasis is on civil aviation) and non-transportation-related GA activity. Table 1. 1 shows the key measures of activity which will be used throughout the study. Public Service General Aviation Passei Cargo The Aviation System A.

Kennedy won the debates (although this was disputed by some listeners) and the election (although some questions were raised about the decisive ballots in Chicago). The value of manned space exploration was being heatedly discussed, even as NASA (the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which itself had only been established in 1958, replacing NACA, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics) tentatively selected 1970 as the year for a manned lunar landing. In the air transport system, it had been over a year since the first turbo jet had been introduced in domestic service (B 707 - 12 C, December 10, 1958), followed quickly by two other turbine-powered aircraft, the turboprop Electra (January 23, 1959) and the DC- 8 (September 18, 1959). The transition to the jet age was well under way. (cont.) By the end of 1960 the domestic airlines had in their inventory 470 turbine-powered aircraft (246 turboprops and 224 turbojets) out of a total of 1980 aircraft. The total investment by the domestic passenger carriers reached $ 1. 66 billion. For the first time DC- 3 's carried less than half of local service airline traffic. The airlines had not yet passed the combined bus-railroad intercity common carrier passenger mile total (38. 8 billion RPM, 49. 3 % of the total RPMs). In fact, in domestic travel passenger miles flown in coach were still fewer than in first-class (47. 2 % compared to 52. 8 %), but,increasingly, faster trips as well as 25 % discounts were making coach ever more attractive. However, the new era was not without its problems. In 1960, there were 0. 93 fatalities per 100 million rpm in domestic passenger service, notably the second in-flight Electra crash (which led to severe speed restrictions on the aircraft, but no grounding) and the mid-air collision between a TWA Super Constellation and a UAL DC- 8 over Brooklyn, New York. 1960 was the worst year for accidents since 1951. As a result, questions were raised about the efficiency of the FAA (Federal Aviation Agency), which had been established in 1958, almost coincidentally with the introduction of the jets. The higher speeds of the turbine-powered aircraft required faster reaction times from the ATC system if safety was not to be compromised. Additionally, flight delays, diversions, and weather cancellations were estimated to have cost the airlines $ 25 - 50 million for the year. In the economic regulation area, 1960 saw the conclusion of the four-year-old General Passenger Fare Investigation (GPFI), in which the CAB (Civil Aeronautics Board) decided that a 10. 5 % return on investment would be proper for the trunks. However, a 5 % fare increase granted in June 1960 did not help the industry achieve this profit; rather, for the year profit shrank to $ 4 million (a 3. 4 % return), although gross revenues rose to $ 2 billion. Air cargo reached 920 million ton-miles, up from 350 million in 1950. While the air transport industry and general aviation were undergoing tremendous growth by practically any operational measure, complaints and apparent problems were abundant. In fact, President Kennedy established a task force ("Project Horizon") to "redefine and affirm" national aviation goals for the 1960 's. Alan Boyd, then the new Chairman of the CAB, was well aware of one of the objectives of the Board -to nurture the industry -when he reflected on the findings of the GPFI (which had noted that,while revenue growth proceeded unimpeded, profits trended downward since mid- 1955 and that the "transition to jet equipment which the industry is now undergoing has presented financial and other problems of a magnitude never before faced. " [ATA 1961]) "Today's low (airline) earnings focus attention on another of our immediate problems. Mach 3 (supersonic) is staring us in the face [...] . Carrier earnings are the only hope for a substantial private enterprise contribution to supersonic development and the nation must develop one. [...] Carrier earnings in the years immediately ahead are the only hope that a private enterprise air transport system can absorb the next equipment transition. " SST's, the need for improved earnings, and modernization of the ATC System aside, observers of the airline industry noted these additional problems facing air transportation in 1960 : 1. Overcapacity and the concomitant need for traffic to fill the seats; 2. Rising cost levels, in particular high wage costs which took up 42 % of total expenses, compared to 23 % for materials and services, 12 % for fuel and oil, and 11 % for amortization and depreciation; 3. Nascent noise problems; 4. Rising subsidy needs by local service carriers (from $ 15 million in 1950 to $ 37 million).

On August 18, 1927 an estimated 10,000 people came to welcome Charles Lindbergh in Moline and his famous plane, the Spirit of St. Louis on the Gugenheim tour, a cross-country commercial aviation promotion tour. In 1929 Phoebe Omlie set an altitude record above the airport in a Velie Monocoupe, the only plane ever manufactured in Moline, which still hangs in the passenger terminal. In 1947 the Metropolitan Airport Authority of Rock Island County was formed after seven townships voted to establish it.

The airport underwent major remodeling in 1961 and 1968, adding everything from baggage claim to a restaurant and boarding areas. The present airport terminal was completed in 1985, after studies showed that an addition to the 1954 structure would be more costly than an entirely new terminal. The shift to the new $11 million terminal allowed expansion of airline facilities; between 1979 and 1986, the number of airlines increased from two to seven.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Air {{passenger}} {{traffic in the}} United States showed remarkable growth during the economic expansion of the 1980 's. Each day {{a million and a}} quarter passengers board commercial flights. The boom coincided with the advent of airline deregulation in 1978. This drastic change in the industry has inspired professional and newspaper articles, graduate student theses, and books which have discussed the causes, effects, costs, and benefits of deregulation with predictably mixed conclusions. Economists, who like to predict the future by exercising econometric models, are finding that conditions in air transportation have become too dynamic (chaotic?) for their models to cope. Certainly the future of the air transportation industry is unclear. There has been, however, an unmistakable trend toward oligopoly, or, as industry spokesmen describe it, "hardball competition among the major airlines. " This trend has been accompanied by formations of hub fortresses owned by these survivors. Air traffic has always been concentrated in a few large cities; airplanes will go where there is a demand for them. But airline (rather than traffic) hubs have created artificial demand. Up to seventy percent of travellers boarding airplanes in the hub cities do not live anywhere near these cities - in fact, they may have no idea at which airport they are changing planes. Most passengers do not care, while travel cognoscenti soon learn to avoid certain airports (and airlines which frequent these airports). A hub airport is a frenzy of activity for short periods of time during the day, as complexes of airplanes descend, park and interchange passengers, and take off. Then the airport lies quietly. If observers were to arrive at a major hub between times of complexes, they would be perplexed to hear that "this {{is one of the most}} congested airports in the world. " Thus congestion and its evil twin, delay, are not constants in the system. Rather, they appear only if a number of conditions conspire to manifest themselves simultaneously, or nearly so. First, the weather must deteriorate from visual flight conditions to instrument flight conditions. Then, this must occur near peak demand conditions at the airport. Of course, some airports in the Unites States are always near peak conditions, among them the so-called slot constrained airports: New York's La Guardia and Kennedy, Washington's National, and Chicago's O'Hare. When weather goes bad at these airports or other major hubs during complexes, ripple effects start nearly all over the country, because some airlines have now designed schedules to maximize utilization of their airplanes. Very little slack time is built into the schedules to account for potential delays, although "block-time creep" exists: the phenomenon that travellers discover when they arrive at their destinations ahead of schedule (if they happen to leave on time). This "creep" protects the airlines from being branded as laggards by the DOT's Consumer On-Time Performance Data hit list. Thus a combination of management practices by airlines (which place great demand on terminal airspace over a concentrated period of time) and mother nature (which provides currently unpredictable behavior of weather near the airport) conspire to limit the capabilities to handle arrivals and departures at various airports below the numbers that had been scheduled. Travellers complain that the schedules aren't being met, and if enough people complain to Congress, or if the travellers themselves happen to be members of Congress, a national problem appears. How much of a problem is this? In 1988 there were 21 airports, according to the FAA, which exceeded 20, 000 hours of annual aircraft delay, perhaps 50, 000 hours per year, or 140 hours per day. (One, Chicago's O'Hare, exceeded 100, 000 hours.) These airports, in turn, averaged 1, 000 operations (arrivals and departures) per day, so that each operation would have averaged about 8 minutes of delay. At O'Hare, for example, 6 % of all operations experienced in excess of 15 minutes of delay. (In excess means just that - there is no knowledge of how much "in excess" is.) Conversely, this means that at that most congested airport in the United States, 94 % of all airplanes arrive or depart with less than 15 minutes of delay. However, airline delay statistics may be similar to the apocryphal story of the Boy Scout troop which drowned wading across a creek which averaged two feet in depth. There are estimates that on a dollar basis, delay accounts for a $ 3 billion cost to airlines, or a net societal cost of $ 5 billion if travellers' wasted time is included. Since in their best years U. S. airlines make about $ 3 billion in profit, reducing delay is a sure-fire way for airlines to climb out of their all too frequent financial morasses, as well as diminishing their passenger frustrations. Even though all of the numbers mentioned in the paragraphs above are subject to substantial caveats, it is indisputable that on certain days during the year the air transportation system seems to come to a crawl, if not a halt. Travellers either find themselves sitting at airport lounges observing cancellation and delay notices appearing on the departure and arrival screens, or sitting in airplanes (on runways or at gates) being told that there is an "air traffic delay. " Old-timers grumble that the only difference twenty years of technology improvements has made to the U. S. airspace system is that the wait is now on the ground instead of circling in the air near their destinations. To the casual observer, it would appear that a number of solutions exist to solve this problem. The most obvious is to pour more concrete: more airports, more and longer runways, more taxiways, more gates and terminals. This is analogous to widening highways and building more interstates for ground transportation congestion. The concrete solution, alas, runs into both financial and citizen roadblocks. It is very expensive - the latest airport coming off the drawing boards (Denver International) carries a tag of some $ 2 billion, with about $ 400 million of that in bonds being backed by a new funding creature, the Passenger Facility Charge (a head tax of up to 3 dollars assessed to every <b>passenger</b> <b>enplaning</b> at an airport - voluntary or not). The citizen roadblock is community objections to airport noisiness. The bill creating the PFC in 1990 also carried with it a mandate for the FAA to create a national noise policy so that individual airports would not wreak havoc with the whole system by creating their own local operational rules, such as curfews. The bill also attempted to pacify airport neighborhoods by setting a deadline for all U. S. aircraft to be quiet(er) - complying with Stage 3 regulations by the year 2000. More damaging than financial difficulties are the anti-noise sentiments, and the concomitant not-in-my-backyard syndrome, that are at the forefronts of protests of either an alert citizenry, or New Age Luddites, when any expansion plans are made public. Whatever one's view, it is a crowd vocal and seemingly powerful enough in local political circles to stop any large- scale progress to ground solutions of the congestion problem. That, then, leaves the air. It is intuitive that if airplanes were closer spaced than they are now, much more traffic would move through a given area in the same amount of time, and consequently airplanes would land (and take off) quicker, reducing any waiting (queue) time. This obviously increases airport noise levels. There are two problems with this approach. The first trick is to accomplish this safely. Safety has at least two dimensions: there is the physical, i. e., airplanes should not run into each other (or the ground, as a result of weather disturbances and wake vortices); and pilots (and controllers) should feel they are still in control of the situation, even after separation standards are reduced. The first aspect is mostly a matter of technology, the second mostly a matter of human factors. But if traffic moved quicker and noise of the aircraft is not reduced, the same citizens who had vehemently opposed the construction of additional ground facilities would once again rise in righteous anger and demand a stop to the more efficient techniques of flying airplanes which have caused an increase in the noise levels in their neighborhood. They, too, must be considered. This report will attempt to address some of the issues outlined above. The focus will be on technology and where it is best suited to provide an equitable and efficient expansion of capacity in the air transportation system. Ultimately, the discussion will be centered on NASA's potential contributions to solving the capacity problem. December 1991 Includes bibliographical references (leaf 57...|$|R
