40|$|Abstract—A {{probabilistic}} framework {{based on}} the Bayesian networks for modeling and real-time inferring human <b>fatigue</b> by integrating information from various sensory data and certain relevant contextual information is introduced. A static <b>fatigue</b> model that captures the static relationships between <b>fatigue,</b> significant factors that cause <b>fatigue,</b> and various sensory observations that typically result from <b>fatigue</b> is first presented. Such a model provides mathematically coherent and sound basis for systematically aggregating uncertain evidences from different sources, augmented with relevant contextual information. The static model, however, fails to capture the dynamic aspect of <b>fatigue.</b> <b>Fatigue</b> is a cognitive state that is developed over time. To account for the temporal aspect of human <b>fatigue,</b> the static <b>fatigue</b> model is extended based on dynamic Bayesian networks. The dynamic <b>fatigue</b> model allows to integrate <b>fatigue</b> evidences not only spatially but also temporally, therefore, leading to a more robust and accurate <b>fatigue</b> modeling and inference. A real-time nonintrusive <b>fatigue</b> monitor was built based on integrating the proposed <b>fatigue</b> model with a computer vision system developed for extracting various visual cues typically related to <b>fatigue.</b> Performance evaluation of the <b>fatigue</b> monitor using both synthetic and real data demonstrates {{the validity of the}} proposed <b>fatigue</b> model in both modeling and real-time inference of <b>fatigue.</b> Index Terms—Bayesian networks (BNs), dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs), human <b>fatigue</b> monitoring, information fusion, vigilance test.

METHODS. A random general population sample (n = 842) of British adolescents and their parents were assessed at baseline and 4 to 6 months later. The main outcomes were <b>fatigue,</b> chronic <b>fatigue,</b> and chronic <b>fatigue</b> syndrome, operationally defined. RESULTS. The incidence over 4 to 6 months was 30. 3 % for <b>fatigue,</b> 1. 1 % for chronic <b>fatigue,</b> and 0. 5 % for chronic <b>fatigue</b> syndrome. The point prevalence was 34. 1 % and 38. 1 % for <b>fatigue,</b> 0. 4 % and 1. 1 % for chronic <b>fatigue,</b> and 0. 1 % and 0. 5 % for chronic <b>fatigue</b> syndrome at time 1 and time 2, respectively. Of participants who were <b>fatigued</b> at time 1, 53 % remained <b>fatigued</b> at time 2. The 3 cases of chronic <b>fatigue</b> and 1 case of chronic <b>fatigue</b> syndrome at time 1 had recovered by time 2. Higher risk for development of chronic <b>fatigue</b> at time 2 was associated with time 1 anxiety or depression, conduct disorder, and maternal distress; in multivariate analysis, baseline anxiety or depression remained a significant predictor of chronic <b>fatigue.</b> Increased risk for development of <b>fatigue</b> at time 2 was associated with time 1 anxiety or depression, conduct disorder, and older age; in multivariate analyses, these factors and female gender all were significant predictors of <b>fatigue.</b> CONCLUSIONS. The incidence rates for chronic <b>fatigue</b> and chronic <b>fatigue</b> syndrome in this adolescent sample were relatively high, but the prognosis for these conditions was good.
