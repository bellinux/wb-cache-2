5000|$|A {{close look}} at the fixed duct support photo shows several {{properties}} or round ring supports. 1) there are stiffeners at roughly 60 degrees on center. This duct ring is fabricated from 2 rolled WT's, welded at the center. This is a smaller duct, with light loads, so that the bottom flange was slightly modified by support clearance requirements. A small gap is shown for placing the duct PTFE slide bearing, although a fixed support could also be inserted in this gap. In the background of this photo is a <b>duct</b> <b>flange.</b> The <b>duct</b> <b>flange</b> normally has 3/4" [...] bolts at 6" [...] nominal; spacing. <b>Duct</b> <b>flange</b> angle thickness needs to be designed for duct plate tensile stresses, as flanges will bend. 5/16" [...] or 3/8" [...] angle thicknesses are common. [...] See above photo of round duct elbows, transitions, and stiffeners. The duct elbow radius, are from 1 1/2 to 2 times the duct diameter. The round duct has ovaling, and shipping rings at 20 foot nominal spacing, and larger support rings at supports. The Y split has suction stiffeners at the duct intersection. Note the 3000 HP fan inlet transition and stack inlet transition also shown in this photo.|$|E

50|$|The heat {{exchanger}} was a shell assembly, {{consisting of a}} <b>duct,</b> bellows, <b>flanges,</b> and coils. It was mounted in the turbine exhaust duct between the oxidizer turbine discharge manifold and the thrust chamber. It heated and expanded helium gas {{for use in the}} third stage or converted LOX to gaseous oxygen for the second stage for maintaining vehicle oxidizer tank pressurization. During engine operation, either LOX was tapped off the oxidizer high-pressure duct or helium was provided from the vehicle stage and routed to the {{heat exchanger}} coils.|$|R
50|$|Duct connections: {{section to}} section.Ducts are shipped from {{fabricating}} facility to job sits on trucks, by rail, or on barges in lengths accommodating {{the mode of}} transport, often in 20 foot sections. These sections are connected with flanges, or weld straps. Flanges are provided at expansion joints, or to join low stress <b>duct</b> sections. <b>Flanges</b> {{may be difficult to}} design for the duct plate forces. Also flange gaskets add flexibility to the flanges that makes their ability to carry forces problematic. therefore weld straps (a short steel strap) are commonly used for higher stress duct plate connections.|$|R
40|$|The Consolidated Incineration Facility, at the Department of Energy`s Savannah River Site, is {{designed}} to treat solid and liquid RCRA hazardous and mixed wastes generated by site operations and clean-up activities. During CIF`s pretrial burn campaigns in 1995, an appreciable amount of water was recovered from the HEPA housings. Questions were immediately raised as {{to the source of}} the water, and the degree of wetness of the filters during operation. There are two primary issues involved: Water could reduce the life expectancy and performance of the HEPA filters, housing, and associated ducting, and wet HEPAs also present radiological concerns for personnel during filter change-out. A similar phenomenon was noted at the Offgas Components Test Facility (OCTF), a 1 / 10 scale pilot of CIF`s air pollution control system. Tests at OCTF indicated the water`s most likely origin to be vapor condensing out from the flue gas stream due to excessive air in-leakage at housing door seals, <b>ducting</b> <b>flanges,</b> and actual holes in the ducting. The rate of accumulation bears no statistical correlation to such process parameters as steam flow, reheater outlet temperature and offgas velocity in the duct. Test results also indicated that the HEPA filter media is moistened by the initial process flow while the facility is being brought on line. However, even when the HEPA filters were manually drenched prior to startup, they became completely dry within four hours of the time steam was introduced to the reheater. Finally, no demonstrable relationship was found between the degree of filter media wetness and filter dP...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Characterization and {{quantification}} of the transient electromagnetic (EM) fields {{generated in}} a gas-insulated substation (GIS) during switching operations has become important in recent years. This {{is due to}} increased use of sensitive electronic devices in the control circuitry of such substations. In this paper, a numerical model based on the finite-difference time-domain technique has been developed to compute the EM field emission from the gas-insulated bus <b>duct</b> through nonmetallic <b>flange</b> of the support insulator during switching operations. The shielding effectiveness (SE) of the bus duct/section for the EM fields has been evaluated using a derivative Gaussian current source and a short time sinusoidal current source. The effect of variations in dimensions of the slot formed by the nonmetallic flange as well as electromagnetic properties of the insulator/bus duct enclosure on SE has been studied. The variation in field pattern along the axis of bus duct at various distances due to the transient currents of different frequencies has been analyzed. The enhancement factor for the EM field levels due {{to the presence of}} a metallic structure has been reported. Finally, emission levels are calculated for the very fast transient currents generated in a 245 kV GIS and their dominant frequencies have been identified...|$|R
40|$|An {{inlet housing}} for a partial-admission turbine has been {{designed}} to cause the inlet airflow to make a smooth transition from an open circular inlet to an inlet slot. The smooth flow is required for purposes of measuring inlet flow characteristics and maximizing the efficiency of the turbine. A partial-admission turbine is a turbine in which the inlet slot occupies less than a complete circle around the rotor axis. In this case, the inlet slot occupies a 90 arc. The present special inlet-housing design is needed because the "bull nose" shape of a conventional turbine inlet housing fails to provide the required smooth transition in a partial-admission configuration and thereby gives rise to a loss of turbine efficiency and inaccuracies in inlet flow measurements. Upon entering the inlet housing through the circular opening, the flow encounters a "tongue"-shaped passageway, which serves as a ramp that diverts the flow to the first of two straight passages. This first passageway occupies a 90 arc and has a length equal to two passage heights. Instrumentation rakes for measuring the characteristics of the inlet flow are installed in this passageway. Just past the first straight passageway is the second one, which is narrower and leads to the 90 turbine inlet slot. This passageway is used to smooth the flow immediately prior to its passage through the turbine inlet slot. The length of this second passageway equals the length of the chord of a turbine vane. The inlet housing incorporates small ports for measuring static pressures at various locations of the flow, and incorporates bosses for the installation of the instrumentation rakes. The inlet housing also includes a flange at its inlet end for attachment to a circular inlet <b>duct</b> and a <b>flange</b> at its outlet end for attachment to the outer casing of the turbine...|$|R
