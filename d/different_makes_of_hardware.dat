50|$|Today, <b>different</b> <b>makes</b> <b>of</b> tenor horns have a {{wide range}} of bore sizes. Narrow bore {{instruments}} such as those made by the former Besson company tend to emphasise the tonal delicacy of older instruments, and play more like a French-styled flugelhorn, while larger bore instruments like those made by Courtois have a weight of sound much greater than traditional tenor horns, playing much more like a conical-bored trumpet. Good, well-made instruments should however, regardless of bore size, retain a light, velvety and mellow tone quality.|$|R
