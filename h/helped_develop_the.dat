5|$|Innovation led to {{business}} {{growth in the}} region. In 1884, John Henry Patterson acquired James Ritty's National Manufacturing Company along with his cash register patents and formed the National Cash Register Company (NCR). The company manufactured the first mechanical cash registers and {{played a crucial role}} in the shaping of Dayton's reputation as an epicenter for manufacturing in the early 1900s. In 1906, Charles F. Kettering, a leading engineer at the company, <b>helped</b> <b>develop</b> <b>the</b> first electric cash register, which propelled NCR into the national spotlight. NCR also <b>helped</b> <b>develop</b> <b>the</b> US Navy Bombe, a code-breaking machine that helped crack the Enigma machine cipher during World War II.|$|E

5|$|Euler <b>helped</b> <b>develop</b> <b>the</b> Euler–Bernoulli beam equation, {{which became}} a {{cornerstone}} of engineering. Aside from successfully applying his analytic tools to problems in classical mechanics, Euler also applied these techniques to celestial problems. His work in astronomy was recognized {{by a number of}} Paris Academy Prizes {{over the course of his}} career. His accomplishments include determining with great accuracy the orbits of comets and other celestial bodies, understanding the nature of comets, and calculating the parallax of the sun. His calculations also contributed to the development of accurate longitude tables.|$|E
5|$|Hand {{was also}} a {{founding}} member of the American Law Institute, where he <b>helped</b> <b>develop</b> <b>the</b> influential Restatements of the Law serving as models for refining and improving state codes in various fields. One American Law Institute recommendation was to decriminalize sexual conduct such as adultery and homosexuality, for which reason the July–August 1955 issue of the Mattachine Society Review, the magazine of the country's first nationwide homosexual organization, published a salute to Judge Hand featuring his photograph on the cover.|$|E

In addition, Duyệt opposed Emperor Minh Mạng's ascension and defended Christian missionaries and converts from the emperor's isolationist and Confucian policies. These attitudes brought Duyệt into conflict with Minh Mạng and led to the posthumous desecration of Duyệt's tomb, which provoked his adopted son Lê Văn Khôi to revolt against the court. Later, Emperor Thiệu Trị, the successor of Minh Mạng, rehabilitated Duyệt and restored his tomb.|$|E

5|$|A {{graduate}} of the University of Birmingham, Titterton worked in a research position under Mark Oliphant, who recruited him to work on radar for the British Admiralty during {{the first part of}} the Second World War.

He participated in the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests at the Bikini Atoll in 1946, where he performed the countdown for both tests. With the passage of the Atomic Energy Act of 1946, known as the McMahon Act, all British government employees had to leave. He was the last member of the British Mission to do so, in April 1947.|$|E

5|$|Development of Sonic Generations {{began in}} 2008, {{following}} {{the completion of}} Unleashed. Sonic Team sought to re-imagine the most popular aspects of the franchise in high-definition, and developed the title using the Hedgehog Engine. Each location and boss in the game is one previously seen in an earlier entry in the series, with the game including numerous other references to past titles. While Sonic Team was the game's main developer, Devil's Details and Dimps <b>helped</b> <b>develop</b> <b>the</b> Windows and 3DS versions, respectively. The game was first revealed in an internal Sega document that was leaked in 2009, and was released on November 1, 2011. The Windows version is noted for its active modding scene, where a dedicated community creates new gameplay mechanics, levels, and assets for the game.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of Terminator 3 in 2003, {{producers}} Andrew G. Vajna and Mario Kassar contracted Nick Stahl and Claire Danes to return as John Connor and Kate Brewster in another film. Director Jonathan Mostow <b>helped</b> <b>develop</b> <b>the</b> script, written by John Brancato and Michael Ferris, and was set to begin production in 2005 after completing another film. It was known by then that Arnold Schwarzenegger's role would be limited, as he had assumed office as Governor of California. The producers sought to have Warner Bros. finance the picture as they did for Terminator 3. In 2005, Stahl said John and Kate would be recast as the story jumped forward in time. By 2006, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (a successor to Orion Pictures and current owners of the Hemdale Film Corporation library, distributor and producer of the original film, respectively) was set to distribute the fourth film {{as part of the}} new CEO Harry Sloan's scheme to make the studio a viable Hollywood player.|$|E
5|$|Motives for {{collection}} of articles, such as Tipu's Tiger, are seen by literary historian Barrett Kalter {{as having a}} social and cultural context. The {{collection of}} Western and Indian art by Tipu Sultan is seen by Kalter as motivated {{by the need to}} display his wealth and legitimise his authority over his subjects who were predominantly Hindu and did not share his religion, viz. Islam. In the case of the East India Company, collection of documents, artefacts and objet's d'art from India <b>helped</b> <b>develop</b> <b>the</b> idea of a subjugated Indian populace {{in the minds of the}} British people, the thought being that the possession of such objects of a culture represented understanding of, dominance over, and mastery of that culture.|$|E

Trowbridge and Coup <b>helped</b> <b>develop</b> <b>the</b> initial storyboards for the attraction. They travelled to Massachusetts several times to meet with the animation directors, Jeff Kleiser and Diana Walczak, and their team at Kleiser-Walczak Construction Co. (now Synthespian Studios) who provided all the stereoscopic animation and custom software for squinching. Coup produced the film alongside Patrick Mooney and Mark Rhodes.

5|$|University of Chicago {{scholars}} {{have played a}} major role in the development of many academic disciplines, including: the Chicago school of economics; the Chicago school of sociology; law and economics theory in legal analysis; the Chicago school of literary criticism; the Chicago school of religion; and the behavioralism school of political science. Chicago's physics department <b>helped</b> <b>develop</b> <b>the</b> world's first man-made, self-sustaining nuclear reaction (Chicago Pile-1) beneath the viewing stands of university's Stagg Field. Chicago's research pursuits are aided through its operation of world-renowned institutions, including the nearby Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory and Argonne National Laboratory, as well as the Marine Biological Laboratory. The university is also home to the University of Chicago Press, the largest university press in the United States. With an estimated completion date of 2020, the Barack Obama Presidential Center will be housed at the university and include both the Obama presidential library and offices of the Obama Foundation.|$|E
5|$|In April 1894, a Scottish {{physician}} Sir Ronald Ross visited Sir Patrick Manson at {{his house}} on Queen Anne Street, London. This visit {{was the start of}} four years of collaboration and fervent research that culminated in 1897 when Ross, who was working in the Presidency General Hospital in Calcutta, proved the complete life-cycle of the malaria parasite in mosquitoes. He thus proved that the mosquito was the vector for malaria in humans by showing that certain mosquito species transmit malaria to birds. He isolated malaria parasites from the salivary glands of mosquitoes that had fed on infected birds. For this work, Ross received the 1902 Nobel Prize in Medicine. After resigning from the Indian Medical Service, Ross worked at the newly established Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and directed malaria-control efforts in Egypt, Panama, Greece and Mauritius. The findings of Finlay and Ross were later confirmed by a medical board headed by Walter Reed in 1900. Its recommendations were implemented by William C. Gorgas in the health measures undertaken during construction of the Panama Canal. This public-health work saved the lives of thousands of workers and <b>helped</b> <b>develop</b> <b>the</b> methods used in future public-health campaigns against the disease.|$|E
