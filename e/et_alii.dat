40|$|In Nature, Vol. 452 / 17 (April 2008), {{in section}} Books & Arts, p. 814, V. S. Ramachandran reviews "Mirrors in the Brain", {{a book by}} G. Rizzolatti and C. Sinigaglia printed by the Oxford University Press. Commenting on the {{so-called}} mirror neuron system (MNS), Ramachandran warns against speculative excesses. Indeed the MNS paradigm is becoming main stream in communication media and even an important feature to issues of public health policy, e. g. autism (see J. Electromyography and Kinesiology Vol. 22, Issue 1, Feb. 2012), neuro-rehabilitation, behavioural sciences(empathy, etc.). In their zeal to support MNS, the book's authors seem to even force some published results: their figs. 5. 9, 5. 10, that are admittedly taken from Buccino et al. (J Cogn Neurosci. 2004 Jan-Feb; 16 (1) : 114 - 26)), have been altered {{with respect to the}} original, in that the red yellow areas have been sensibly modified. Those figures summarise functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging results on subjects watching silent videos (e. g., man biting or speaking, monkey biting or lip-smacking, dog biting or barking), highlighting (i) effective MNS-based comprehension of another's action between con-specific subjects, (ii) less so between humans and monkeys, and (iii) poor between humans and dogs. The new figures published in the book, obviously addressed to general public, do support MNS, certainly more strongly so than Buccino <b>et</b> <b>Alii's</b> original figures (see also Rivista Medica S 4. Vol. 14, 2008, and PLoS One. 2012; 7 (6) :e 39145). Given the potential importance of the experiments described in the book for the MNS paradigm, the discrepancy pointed out above calls for deeper studies in order to remove any ambiguity in the data analysis and interpretation...|$|R

In particular, Ramazzini describes {{the case of a}} famed singer, who …quea post exantlatos cantus labores, gravissima raucedine persaepe corripi solet, quem affectum sibi familiarem ait post diuturnos cantus (after the prolonged effort in singing…she very often had a severe attack of hoarseness and she said that after singing for a long time she regularly suffers like this) 4.

25|$|The {{nasal septum}} is {{composed}} of the quadrangular cartilage, the vomer bone (the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone), aspects of the premaxilla, and the palatine bones. Each lateral nasal wall contains three pairs of turbinates (nasal conchae), which are small, thin, shell-form bones: (i) the superior concha, (ii) the middle concha, and (iii) the inferior concha, which are the bony framework of the turbinates. Lateral to the turbinates is the medial wall of the maxillary sinus. Inferior to the nasal conchae (turbinates) is the meatus space, with names that correspond to the turbinates, e.g. superior turbinate, superior meatus, <b>et</b> <b>alii.</b> The internal roof of the nose is composed by the horizontal, perforated cribriform plate (of the ethmoid bone) through which pass sensory filaments of the olfactory nerve (Cranial nerve I); finally, below and behind (posteroinferior) the cribriform plate, sloping down at an angle, is the bony face of the sphenoid sinus.|$|E
25|$|Though fossils {{revealing}} ichthyosaur behavior remain rare, one ichthyosaur fossil {{is known}} to have sustained bites to the snout region. Discovered in Australia, and analyzed by Benjamin Kear <b>et</b> <b>alii</b> in 2011, measurements of the wounds reveal that the bite marks were inflicted by another ichthyosaur, likely of the same species, a probable case of face biting during a conflict. The wounds show signs of healing in the form of bone growth, meaning that the victim survived the attack. Another, very large ichthyosaur close to nine metres in length was found in Svalbard; it was nearly complete save for its tail. Scrutiny of the find revealed that while hunting ammonites (as evidenced by an ammonite shell in the throat region), the ichthyosaur was ambushed and attacked, likely by a pliosaurid (known from the same habitat), which severed its tail. The ichthyosaur then sank to the depths, drowning and eventually becoming fossilized in the deep water. The find was revealed to the public in the National Geographic special Death of a Sea Monster.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the large}} number of specimens, {{statistical}} analysis can be used to investigate this problem. In 2008 Chiappe <b>et</b> <b>alii</b> published a morphometrical study of 106 fossils. The population showed a clear bimodal distribution {{of the size of the}} animals with two weight classes. However, there was no correlation between size and the possession of the long tail feathers. From this it was concluded that either the sexes did not differ in size or both sexes had the long feathers. The first case was deemed most likely which left the size distribution to be explained. It was hypothesised that the smaller animals consisted of very young individuals, that the large animals were adults and that the rarity of individuals with an intermediate size was caused by Confuciusornis experiencing a growth spurt just prior to reaching adulthood, the shortness of which would have prevented many becoming fossilised during this phase. This interpretation was criticised by Dieter S. Peters who pointed out that, as the smaller animals were not neonates, the young of Confuciusornis had to grow very fast immediately after hatching regardless. This would then imply two growth spurts, which assumption was not very parsimonious. He thought the data would be more simply explained by assuming that both sexes had the long feathers and one of them was the largest. He favoured the possibility that these were the females, having observed such a pattern with the modern pheasant-tailed jacana (Hydrophasianus chirurgus), a water-bird in which both sexes have long tails and the female sex is the heaviest. He accounted for the fact that most specimens show no tails at all by the possibility that Confuciusornis shed the feathers as a defence mechanism, a method used by several extant species, which would have been triggered by the stress induced by the very volcanic explosion that buried the animals.|$|E
5000|$|The {{full extent}} of the {{authority}} of commissaries Apostolic must be learnt from the diploma of their appointment. The usual powers which they possess, however, are defined in the common law of the Church. Commissaries can be empowered not only for judicial but also for executive purposes. When a papal commission mentions explicitly certain persons and certain things as subject to the authority of a commissary, and then adds in general that [...] "other persons and other things" [...] (quidam <b>alii</b> <b>et</b> res aliœ) are also included, it is understood that the latter phrase refers only to persons and things of equal or lower importance than those that are expressly named, and under no circumstances can the commissary's power extend to what is higher or more dignified (Cap. xv, de rescript.). If a bishop be appointed commissary Apostolic in matters that already belong to his ordinary (mainly diocesan) jurisdiction, he does not thereby receive a delegated jurisdiction superadded to that which he already possessed; such an Apostolic commission is said to 'excite', not to alter, his ordinary jurisdiction.|$|R
50|$|Already {{they were}} used at most of the {{conspicuous}} functions of the Church. Paulinus, bishop of Nola (d. 431), describes the altar at the eucharist as crowned with crowded lights, and even mentions the eternal lamp. For their use at baptisms we have, among much other evidence, that of Zeno of Verona for the West, and that of Gregory of Nazianzus for the East. Their use at funerals is illustrated by Eusebiuss description of the burial of Constantine, and Jeromes account of that of Saint Paula. At ordinations {{they were used}}, as is shown by the 6th canon of the Council of Carthage (398), which decrees that the acolyte is to hand to the newly ordained deacon ceroferarium cum cereo. This symbolism was not pagan, i.e. the lamps were not placed in the graves {{as part of the}} furniture of the dead; in the Catacombs they are found only in the niches of the galleries and the arcosolia, nor can they have been votive in the sense popularized later.

Monkeys are born in almost as helpless a condition as our own infants; and in certain genera the young differ fully as much in appearance from the adults, as do our children from their full-grown parents. (12. This remark is made with respect to Cynocephalus and the anthropomorphous apes by Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire and F. Cuvier, 'Histoire Nat. des Mammiferes,' tom. i. 1824.) It has been urged by some writers, as an important distinction, that with man the young arrive at maturity at a much later age than with any other animal: but if we look to the races of mankind which inhabit tropical countries the difference is not great, for the orang is believed not to be adult till the age of from ten to fifteen years. (13. Huxley, 'Man's Place in Nature,' 1863, p. 34.) Man differs from woman in size, bodily strength, hairiness, etc., {{as well as in}} mind, {{in the same manner as}} do the two sexes of many mammals. So that the correspondence in general structure, in the minute structure of the tissues, in chemical composition and in constitution, between man and the higher animals, especially the anthropomorphous apes, is extremely close.|$|E
