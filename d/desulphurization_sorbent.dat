The {{comparative study of}} desulphurization efficiency by using sintering red mud and traditional desulphurization sorbent-limestone had done in Liquid-column impingement Scrubber apparatus. The effects of gas velocity, liquid-gas ratio and pH value on desulphurization efficiency were studied. Results show that the desulphurization efficiency of sintering red mud is {{lower than that of}} limestone in the same slurry mass concentration, while the sintering red mud can be used as <b>desulphurization</b> <b>sorbent</b> when increase its slurry solid content in appropriate way. The gas and droplets can mix well in absorption section when the gas velocity is upper than 2. 7 m/s. The desulphurization efficiency higher than 80 % can be obtained when L/G ratio higher than 15 L/m 3 and the pH values between 5. 2 - 7...|$|E
40|$|AbstractApplying the oxyfuel {{process to}} the {{circulating}} fluidized bed technology, {{one of the}} major process concerns is the possible deposit formation on the immersed surfaces of the external heat exchangers caused by the recarbonation of unused calcined <b>desulphurization</b> <b>sorbent</b> (CaO). This paper presents first results from experiments carried out under air- and oxyfuel atmospheres in a lab-scale BFB of calcined limestone with an in-bed cooled deposition probe. It was found, that under oxyfuel conditions, the strong recarbonation of calcined particles on the cool surface lead to hard and stable carbonate depositions...|$|E
40|$|Aim of {{this thesis}} is {{to design a}} {{technology}} of a flue gas desulphurization of fluidized bed boiler. Currently, the state of technology {{is not able to}} provide flue gas desulphurisation to required level. For this reason it is necessary to build additional device for the desulphurisation. Theoretical part of the thesis deals with the emission limits of sulphur dioxide, available methods of <b>desulphurization</b> and <b>sorbents</b> suitable for the desulfurization. In practical part conditioned dry sorption method is chosen for the specified source, technological and structural design for suggested desulphurization technology including design of all device is proposed. The thesis also includes a technology design and a 3 D model...|$|R
