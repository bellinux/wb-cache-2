40|$|The {{operation}} {{environment in}} the roundwood trade in Finland in the 1990 ’s include several changes. They are changes {{in the structure of}} non-industrial private forest (NIPF) ownership, forest taxation, in forest legislation, in price recommendation agreement, diminishing resources of <b>forestry</b> <b>extension</b> <b>services,</b> etc. At the same time, the roundwood demand has been rising. All these developments cause uncertainty in wood procurement organisations, and call for research {{to find out how to}} adapt into the changing environment. The objective of this study is to produce information for roundwood purchasing planning and cus-tomer satisfaction management to be used by Stora Enso Metsä Customer Service, Helsinki. For this pur-pose, data needs to be gathered about the urban NIPFs and their forest estates, behaviour related to forestry and timber-selling, customer satisfaction in their latest timber selling transaction, and their opinions about Enso’s new customer service office and its service concept. To fulfil the objective of the study, a NIPF -owner -survey (N= 1064, response rate 39, 7 %) was con-ducted in October 1998 -January 1999. The sample was made on the basis of the marketing database of Stora Enso Oyj Forest Customer Service in Helsinki. In planning the frame of reference of the empirical study, the model of service quality by Grönroos was applied. The following aspects were included in the 7 -page questionnaire: demographic, sosio-economic and forest estate background, relation to the forest service supply, behaviour related to forestry, timber-selling motives and behaviour, last contact organisation and its image in forestry business, expectations and percep-tions in the latest timber-selling transactions, and behavioural intentions. The results revealed that the share of women, pensioners and academically educated people among forest owners was quite high. The majority of the forest estates of the metropolitan forest owners were situ-ated in the provinces of South Finland and East Finland. The average forest estate area was considerably smaller than in a previous study. Economic and recreational objectives were most important in the use of forests. Forest Associations were involved in half of the roundwood sales transactions of the respondents in the metropolitan area. The wood quantity of transactions was considerably higher than the average in the whole country. Bank-organised forest-related activities, taxation infos and trips to the forest were the most popular activities. Among the services, silvicultural advices were needed mostly and stub treatment least. Brochure material related to stumpage timber sales and taxation were considered most important compared to material related to delivery sales. The service expectations were at highest for women and they were less satisfied with the service than men. 2 nd and 3 rd generation residents of the metropolitan area thought about the new customer service concept more positively than the 1 st generation residents. Internet users under 60 years thought more positively about new satellite picture-based woodlot search concept. Cross-tabulation of factor scores against background variables indicated that women with relatively low education level a greater need to sell roundwood than entrepreneurs, white-collar workers and directors, and Internet users. Suspiciousness towards timber procurement organisations was relatively strong among women and those whose forest income share of the total income was either null or over 20 %. The average customer satisfaction score was negative in all nine questions. Statistical differences be-tween different companies did not exist in the average satisfaction scores. Stora Enso’s Helsinki forest cus-tomer service could choose the ability to purchase all timber grades as its competitive advantage. Out of nine service dimension included in the questionnaire, in this particular service dimension, Enso’s Helsinki forest customer service’s score exceeded most all organisations’ average customer satisfaction score. On the basis of importance – performance matrix, advice and quidance could have been provided more to the forest owners in their latest timber–selling transaction...|$|E
40|$|According to the {{classification}} of business activities in the National Classification of Activities, agriculture, forestry and fishery together account for 3. 43 % of all injuries recorded in 2009, which places them in {{the lower part of}} the annual review (Table 1). However, in the said group, the state forestry enterprise (Croatian Forests Ltd. Zagreb) accounts for 48. 46 % of all injuries at work, which makes 1. 66 % of all injuries recorded in 2009. Comparing the number of injuries in Croatian forests with the number of employees in 2009, an exceptionally high ratio is obtained of 29. 40 injuries per 1000 employees, the highest index among the above said industry sectors. Nevertheless, according to standard indicators of the level of security and protection of workers, in this decade forestry has recorded positive trends in relation to key indicators. Also, the state forestry enterprise halved the number of injuries (Table 2). Working techniques of workers directly employed in forest operations play a key role in achieving a satisfactory degree of safety and efficiency in forestry work. The assessment of working techniques of forest workers employed in logging and timber production has been carried out by the Faculty of Forestry continuously since 2000 (Table 3). Findings of a ten-year evaluation indicate the following:• since the beginning of monitoring, a relatively steady increasing trend of the level of working techniques has been recorded, while the accomplished potential (AP), calculated using the overall mean scores, has ranged between 0. 79 and 0. 88 utilizations,• mean value of AP is 0. 84, which suggests an average of 16 % of unaccomplished potential and it is a scope to improve working techniques,• rating of 2010 (2. 63) keeps the increasing trend of working techniques levels, but such a positive difference is not statistically significant,• a decreasing trend of the lowest ratings (1) stops in 2010, by reducing the share of medium grade (2) and increasing the proportion of top grade (3). The evaluation of mechanized skidding has been carried out since 2008 by separate monitoring of the skidder-driver and chokerman (Table 4). Key findings are as follows:• performance level of work activities moderately grows with a decrease of the weakest ratings (1) and with the increase of the share of medium grade (2),• mean value of the accomplished potential (AP) amounts to 0. 825 in 2009, which means an average of 17. 5 % of unaccomplished potential and it is a scope for improvement of working techniques. According to the Forests Act, forestry work can be carried out exclusively by registered and licensed contractors. According to the review of the Croatian Chamber of Forestry and Wood Technology of November 2010, there are 238 forestry contractors registered with license. It is evident that more than 85 % of all licensed service contractors are engaged in logging, silviculture, and construction of forest roads (Table 6). Past practice of training for professional forest work shows that the greatest problems are related to:• uneven and incomplete programs and subject-matter training,• a significant reduction, even lack of practical training,• application of non-transparent training evaluation criteria. Additionally, training is conducted by programs that are not verified or independently assessed, and also there is no control of adequacy of human and technical resources for training. Also, it is not known that anyone has ever been denied to organize the training, e. g. for lack of specific resources and training ground for practical work. Also, Croatian forestry has no compulsory certification of operators of forestry machinery. There is no organized training of forest owners for forest work in Croatia. The first step in building such a system started with training 17 professionals by the Forestry Extension Service during 2008 at the Faculty of Forestry, University of Zagreb, where they were trained as trainers of safety in forestry work. In future, they should be mediators between forest owners who are interested in independent forest operations and educational training centers. During 2009, 6 experts of the <b>Forestry</b> <b>Extension</b> <b>Services</b> went through training in the Secondary Forestry School in Karlovac by which they were trained to implement the theoretical part of the training of forest owners for forest work. A part of practical training of forest owners was planned to be carried out in the polygon of the Secondary Forestry School in Karlovac. Interest in training for independent forest operations was shown by more than 500 forest owners. The Faculty of Forestry in Zagreb developed the idea of establishing a National Center for forest work. The center is envisioned as an agency with public authorities and international accreditation for certification of training for forest work and for work with specific tools such as chainsaw (Fig. 2). The idea of the Center was first included in the project proposal of the National Program for occupational safety in forestry 2007. The primary tasks of the Center would be as follows:• connecting Croatia into European processes and programs related to safety in forestry,• establishing a collaborative network in order to implement the EU-project standard of forest workers in Croatia,• introduction of certification of all aspects of training for professional work (Fig. 1), including forest certification program, performance and contractor training,• introduction of certification for training of non-professionals (especially forest owners) to work with chainsaw,• verification procedures in licensing of registered forestry contractors,• monitoring of the minimum technical requirements for training polygons,• establishment of an IT system for providing security with a registry of certificates issued. Considering the current legislative context, the Center for Forest Work should be formed as an agency with public authorities. The framework for the establishment and functioning of the Center should be created by alterations of the »Ordinance on occupational safety in forestry«. This ordinance should impose an obligation of training certification for all holders of such activities in the forestry sector. The establishment of a Center would also stimulate training market development, where it would be important to observe the above said rules in determining the qualifications and minimum requirements for legal and natural persons engaged in training for forest work. In the preparatory phase, cooperation and partnership should be initiated by the signing of agreements regarding the establishment and start-up of the Center between the respective ministry, the Croatian Forests Ltd., Faculty of Forestry, and the Croatian Forest Research Institute – primarily for integrating human and technical resources. The forthcoming Center would be financed from the state budget for its public activities (e. g. implementation of IT system) and income earned from its own collection of fees from holders of certifications and/or licenses...|$|E

40|$|Cilj projekta koji se provodio od 1. srpnja 2006. do 1. srpnja 2008. bio je pružiti tehničku pomoć za pripremu modernizacije i revitalizacije industrije drvenog ugljena u Hrvatskoj, te šire korištenje biomase kao obnovljivog izvora energije. To uključuje bolje poznavanje i razumijevanje postojeće proizvodnje drvenog ugljena, ali i pripremu programa modernizacije i re­vitalizacije te jačanje sposobnosti glavnih subjekata za njegovu provedbu. U Hrvatskoj postoji samo jedan industrijski proizvođač drvenog ugljena – Belišće d. d. te više srednjih i manjih proizvođača koji koriste zidane peći. Osim njih, postoji i više stotina pojedinačnih proizvođača u različitim dijelovima Hrvatske koji proizvode u jamama ili zidanim pećima, ali nisu registrirani za tu proizvodnju. U provedbi projekta sudjelovali su vodeći stručnjaci s ovog područja iz Hrvatske i Europske unije na projektu, ali i svi relevantni su­dio­nici proizvodnog lanca te tržišta za drveni ugljen u Hrvatskoj. The single {{industrial}} charcoal {{producer in}} Croatia {{is located in}} Belisće, eastern Croatia. There are also several small to medium charcoal producers in Croatia using traditonal charcol production techniques. Na­mely, all producers apart from Belišće have traditional facilities and equipments with low productivity and conversion efficiencies. Thus, this sector require renovation and modernization in order become competitive with other international vendors. Croatia also has around 400 small-scale charcoal producers scattered in forest areas. Those producers are responsible for around half of the national charcoal production (approximately 3. 000 tonnes per year). Outdated technology of charcoal production and low conversion efficiency of wood into charcoal is forcing both small and large-scale charcoal producers out from the market. They are losing competitiveness in both input (wood) and output (charcoal) markets on national and international scale due to rapidly increasing demand for biomass. The consequences are reduced incomes for people involved in this industry and increased number of unemployment in rural areas. The demand for charcoal is fairly large and it is increasing rapidly. Worldwide consumption is estimated at 40. 5 million tonnes annually, with 19. 8 million tonnes just for Africa according to FAO statistics. Charcoal consumption in Croatia, used only as a barbecue fuel in households and restaurants, has been rising steadily {{over the last few}} years. Export possibilities for charcoal produced in Croatia are expanding but the price competition with producers from Asia, Latin America but also Bulgaria, Bosnia and Her­ze­go­vina and Serbia makes the export aspirations rather challenging. From the long term perspective, the key issue for a sustainable industrial charcoal production is the possibility of paying a higher price for feedstock (wood re­si­dues from wood processing industry and forestry waste). This can be achieved by increasing the price of charcoal sold on the market and by increasing the efficiency of charcoal production. Project activities were divided into six modules. The Module on Infor­ma­tion includes the preparation of CROWEIS and WISDOM. The Module on National and International Market analyzed, examined and evaluated the costs of raw materials, production costs and prices for charcoal. The Module on Technology and Technical Aspects assessed the technical, economic, and environmental competitiveness of existing charcoal production technologies and industries. The Module on Economics and Environmental Aspects prepared technical, economic, environmental and socio-economic studies to de­ter­mine the viability of the different charcoal production options being pro­moted. The Module on Legal Framework and Institutions carried out the analysis of the roles to be played by different national organizations in the implementation of integrated charcoal and wood energy policies and programmes. The Module on Training and Extension consisted in the preparation of specific training and extension material and the organization of international study tour and training courses in the country. The results and conclusions from the project and the identification of fu­ture action lead to the following recommendations: • The State Office for Standardisation should draft out the charcoal quality standard according to relevant European norms implementing their positive effects into our standards. • The State Office for Standardisation should form a Technical Committee for wooden biomass that would also be in charge for charcoal. • The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management should provide translation of relevant EU norms (especially EN 1860 - 2 : 2005) within the FAO project and submit that to the producers of charcoal who could then be able to implement them in their own production. • The Ministry of Regional Development, Forestry and Water Management should create legal framework to form market of wooden products (wood bourse) in order to make that raw material more available on the market. The Wood Processing and Use Act has been in the parliamentary procedure which will create a legal basis for formation of the said bourse. • The Ministry of Regional Development, Forestry and Water Management should promote and organise inspection of wooden products trade to ensure transparent trading in accordance with marketing terms. • The Ministry of Environmental Protection, Physical Planning and Con­struction should issue a legal obligation for deposing of biomass – wooden residual of wood processing industry and forestry in order to further incite energetic use. • The Ministry of Economy, Labour and Entrepreneurship should implement the system to encourage new charcoal production technologies which will increase the efficiency of the production. • The Environmental Protection and Energy Efficiency Fund, in cooperation with the respective ministries, in accordance to the operational programme for 2008, 2009 and 2010 shall carry out a tender for moder­nisation and expansion of the existing and starting up of the new charcoal production facilities. • The Ministry of Environmental Protection, Physical Planning and Con­struction, should issue guidelines for selection of location of the new facilities in accordance with the existing legal regulations regarding building due to avoid misinterpretation of regulation by the local/regional self-governance units. • <b>Forestry</b> <b>Extension</b> <b>Service</b> should organise education on advantages, possibilities and limitation of the charcoal producers associations and the possibilities to secure financing for modernisation of this production which would include the preparation of the guidebook. • Charcoal producers should form regional cooperatives and establish the national association of charcoal producers at the Croatian Chamber of Economy or independently in order to gain easier and more quality market appearance. The Croatian Chamber of Trades and Crafts should definitely be included in this process. • The referral centre should be formed either at the <b>Forestry</b> <b>Extension</b> <b>Service</b> or regional energy agencies that would provide information re­gard­ing new technologies, financial options, and mediate in the appearance of domestic producers on foreign markets...|$|R

40|$|Globally {{there has}} been a growing {{interest}} towards the privatization of agricultural <b>extension</b> <b>services.</b> Privatization of <b>extension</b> <b>service</b> delivery is being considered for Bangladesh with a view to lower the government expenditures, to increase the efficiency of service delivery and {{to improve the quality of}} the <b>extension</b> <b>services</b> in changed circumstances on the part of the farmers.

40|$|While {{agricultural}} <b>extension</b> <b>services</b> in Tanzania {{have mostly}} been provided and {{financed by the}} public sector, the landscape is changing {{with regard to the}} provision of <b>extension</b> <b>services</b> in the country. Observations reveal that several non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and farmer-led initiatives have, over time, supplemented <b>extension</b> <b>service</b> delivery of the public <b>extension</b> <b>services</b> with cost-sharing, but these experiences have not been formally integrated into the extension system nor has their potential to reduce public expenditure and improve quality of <b>extension</b> <b>service</b> been considered. As the government continues to face financial difficulties, it has started to reconsider the issue of public <b>extension</b> <b>service</b> and is currently entertaining the possibilities of gradually divesting the public sector of extension, leaving the private sector and users to take an increasing responsibility.

Providing of agricultural <b>extension</b> <b>service</b> is important foreign-political instrument of a state which has stimulates the development of agricultural production. Agricultural <b>extension</b> <b>service</b> must provide effective link between holdings-producers, agricultural research and other sources of information.

40|$|Problem statement: Jordans {{agricultural}} <b>extension</b> <b>service</b> {{is seriously}} under-staffed and its effectiveness is consequently compromised. Reservations are being expressed about {{the performance and}} capability of the agricultural extension system in Jordan. The performance of this sector has been disappointing and has failed to transfer agricultural technology to the farmers. The main objective {{of this study is}} to assess the effectiveness of Jordans agricultural <b>extension</b> <b>services.</b> Approach: The effect of <b>extension</b> <b>services</b> on olive productivity in the study area was investigated. A total number of 60 olive producers were selected to be interviewed for this study. This number was enough to achieve the study objectives. The interviewed producers were distributed almost equally within olive production locations in the study area. The sample obtained through the simple random sampling technique. The two groups had been chosen and distributed randomly into an experimental group (30 farmers; 10 for each source of <b>extension</b> <b>service)</b> and control group (30 farmers). The experimental group received <b>extension</b> <b>services</b> and the control group received no <b>extension</b> <b>services.</b> Two interview-cum-structured questionnaires were designed and used to collect information and data for this study. The first instrument was designed for farmers who received <b>extension</b> <b>services</b> and the second from farmers who received no <b>extension</b> <b>services.</b> Another questionnaire was designed for administrators of extension organizations concerned with providing <b>extension</b> <b>services</b> to farmers. To find the differences that may exist between two studied groups, One Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), t-test and LSD test via Statistical Package for Social Sciences software (SPSS) were used. The average net profit obtained from an area of one dynamo of olive farm was the main item to be considered in determining the effectiveness of agricultural extension activities. Results and Conclusion: The results of the study revealed that the net profit of farmers who received <b>extension</b> <b>services</b> is almost the same as those who do not receive any <b>extension</b> <b>services.</b> The provided <b>extension</b> <b>services</b> made no difference in the achievement of farmers regarding their production and consequently their net profits. The three main investigated sources of <b>extension</b> <b>services</b> provide inadequate and less effective <b>extension</b> <b>services.</b> To overcome most of the obstacles facing extension programs in Jordan the government should impart extensive in-service agricultural trainings to train the extension personnel to cope with the growing needs of farmers. The establishment of field demonstration sites, pilot sites on farmers fields around the demonstrations is another important issues to be covered...|$|R
40|$|In Nigeria, {{agricultural}} <b>extension</b> <b>services</b> {{have been}} dominated by the Agricultural Development Programme (ADPs) since the mid- 1970 s. However, the experiences of farmers are changing. Traditional <b>extension</b> <b>services</b> linked with production objectives and blanket recommendations can no longer meet farmers’ expectations. Therefore, extension practitioners need to meet this challenge by seeking private sector participation in the funding and delivery of <b>extension</b> <b>services.</b> This paper noted that <b>extension</b> <b>services</b> provided by the private sector, {{even when it is}} funded by government, is a positive feature and government can play a strategic role in identifying gaps in the provision of <b>extension</b> <b>services</b> that can be filled through a brokerage role or by contracting service providers. It then concluded that the sustainability of private sector participants in <b>extension</b> <b>service</b> delivery requires a new orientation among staff. This will require some investment in staff training and reorientation. Research and Development/Tech Change/Emerging Technologies,...|$|R
