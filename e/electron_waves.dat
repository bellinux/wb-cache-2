5|$|De Broglie's {{prediction}} {{of a wave}} nature for electrons led Erwin Schrödinger to postulate a wave equation for electrons moving {{under the influence of}} the nucleus in the atom. In 1926, this equation, the Schrödinger equation, successfully described how <b>electron</b> <b>waves</b> propagated. Rather than yielding a solution that determined the location of an electron over time, this wave equation also could be used to predict the probability of finding an electron near a position, especially a position near where the electron was bound in space, for which the electron wave equations did not change in time. This approach led to a second formulation of quantum mechanics (the first by Heisenberg in 1925), and solutions of Schrödinger's equation, like Heisenberg's, provided derivations of the energy states of an electron in a hydrogen atom that were equivalent to those that had been derived first by Bohr in 1913, and that were known to reproduce the hydrogen spectrum. Once spin and the interaction between multiple electrons were describable, quantum mechanics made it possible to predict the configuration of electrons in atoms with atomic numbers greater than hydrogen.|$|E

In the application of quantum mechanics to electromagnetism, i.e., quantum electrodynamics, gauge symmetry applies to both electromagnetic waves and <b>electron</b> <b>waves.</b> These two gauge symmetries are in fact intimately related. If a gauge transformation θ is applied to the <b>electron</b> <b>waves,</b> for example, then one must also apply a corresponding transformation to the potentials that describe the electromagnetic waves.

25|$|Since {{transmission}} electron goniometry {{is based}} on Bragg’s Law for the transmission (Laue) case (diffraction of <b>electron</b> <b>waves),</b> interzonal angles (i.e. angles between lattice directions) can be measured by a procedure that {{is analogous to the}} measurement of interfacial angles in an optical goniometer on the basis of Snell’s Law, i.e. the reflection of light. The complements to interfacial angles of external crystal faces can, on the other hand, be directly measured from a zone-axis diffraction pattern or from the Fourier transform of a high resolution TEM image that shows crossed lattice fringes.|$|E
25|$|Crystal {{structure}} {{can also}} be investigated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), also known as phase contrast. When using a field emission source and a specimen of uniform thickness, the images are formed {{due to differences in}} phase of <b>electron</b> <b>waves,</b> which is caused by specimen interaction. Image formation is given by the complex modulus of the incoming electron beams. As such, the image is not only dependent on the number of electrons hitting the screen, making direct interpretation of phase contrast images more complex. However this effect can be used to an advantage, as it can be manipulated to provide more information about the sample, such as in complex phase retrieval techniques.|$|E
25|$|Different imaging methods {{therefore}} {{attempt to}} modify the <b>electron</b> <b>waves</b> exiting the sample {{in a way that}} provides information about the sample, or the beam itself. From the previous equation, it can be deduced that the observed image depends not only on the amplitude of beam, but also on the phase of the electrons, although phase effects may often be ignored at lower magnifications. Higher resolution imaging requires thinner samples and higher energies of incident electrons, which means that the sample can no longer be considered to be absorbing electrons (i.e., via a Beer's law effect). Instead, the sample can be modeled as an object that does not change the amplitude of the incoming electron wave function, but instead modifies the phase of the incoming wave; in this model, the sample is known as a pure phase object. For sufficiently thin specimens, phase effects dominate the image, complicating analysis of the observed intensities. To improve the contrast in the image, the TEM may be operated at a slight defocus to enhance contrast, owing to convolution by the contrast transfer function of the TEM, which would normally decrease contrast if the sample was not a weak phase object.|$|E

We study, in particular, the energy transfer from a moderately strong infrared (IR) field to the <b>electron</b> <b>wave</b> packets {{as a function of}} time delay between the XUV and the IR fields. The use of an APT to generate the <b>electron</b> <b>wave</b> packets enables the generation at times not accessible through tunneling ionization. We find that a significant amount of energy is transferred from the IR field to the <b>electron</b> <b>wave</b> packets, when they are generated at a zero-crossing of the IR laser field.

2500|$|If the ejected {{photoelectron}} {{is taken}} to have a wave-like nature and the surrounding atoms are described as point scatterers, {{it is possible to}} imagine the backscattered <b>electron</b> <b>waves</b> interfering with the forward-propagating waves. The resulting interference pattern shows up as a modulation of the measured absorption coefficient, thereby causing the oscillation in the EXAFS spectra. A simplified plane-wave single-scattering theory has been used for interpretation of EXAFS spectra for many years, although modern methods (like FEFF, GNXAS) have shown that curved-wave corrections and multiple-scattering effects can not be neglected. The photelectron scattering amplitude in the low energy range (5-200 eV) of the photoelectron kinetic energy [...] become much larger so that multiple scattering events become dominant in the NEXAFS (or XANES) spectra.|$|E
