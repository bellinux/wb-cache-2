The main results show that students perform in different segment companies, but especially in service companies, 87 % are female and the predominant age group is between 17 and 24 years old.

50|$|In {{the absence}} of a joint secretariat to {{coordinate}} cooperation amongst NARC member states, Libya voluntarily played this role during the initial phase of starting up NARC which lasted for three years (2005-2008). Later on, the second meeting of NARC Ministers of Defence held in Tripoli in December 2008 approved a recommendation to establish an <b>executive</b> <b>secretariat</b> to be located in Tripoli. Subsequently, the NARC <b>Executive</b> <b>Secretariat</b> and Planning Element were inaugurated in April 2009. It was however, expected that staff from other member states will join the <b>Executive</b> <b>Secretariat</b> and PLANELM in September 2010. While both Egypt and Algeria had identified staff for the two elements, these countries were yet to sign the hosting agreement with Libya, and in some cases the deployment of staff was constrained by domestic considerations including promotions and retirements. Meanwhile, progress in generating the civilian officers for the PLANELM lagged even further behind; this essentially meant that the NARC PLANELM was purely military in 2010.|$|R
