This set-up uses a normal op-amp {{with an additional}} AC amplifier that goes alongside the op-amp. The chopper gets an AC signal from DC by switching between the DC voltage and ground at a fast rate (60Hz or 400Hz). This signal is then amplified, rectified, filtered and fed into the op-amp's non-inverting input. This vastly improved the gain of the op-amp while significantly reducing the output drift and <b>DC</b> <b>offset.</b> Unfortunately, any design that used a chopper couldn't use their non-inverting input for any other purpose. Nevertheless, the much improved characteristics of the chopper-stabilized op-amp made it the dominant way to use op-amps. Techniques that used the non-inverting input regularly would not be very popular until the 1960s when op-amp ICs started {{to show up in}} the field.|$|E

Herewith, a guided wave Six-Port interferometric radar system is presented. Due to limited matching and discontinuities in the radio frequency part of the system, the designers have to deal with <b>DC</b> <b>offsets.</b> The offset voltages in the baseband lead to worse relative modulation dynamics relating to the full scale range of the analog-to-digital converters and thus, considerably degrade the system performance. While common cancelation techniques try to estimate and extinguish the <b>DC</b> <b>offsets</b> directly, the proposed radar system is satisfied with equalizing both <b>DC</b> <b>offsets</b> for each of the two differential baseband signal pairs. Since the complex representation of the baseband signals is utilized for a subsequent arctangent demodulation, the proposed offset equalization implicates a centering of the in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) components of the received signal, which is sufficient to simplify the demodulation and improve the phase accuracy. Therefore, a standard Six-Port radar system is extended and a variable phase shifter plus variable attenuators are inserted at different positions. An intelligent algorithm adjusts these configurable components to achieve optimal I/Q offset cancelation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—There {{is a need}} among {{scientists}} and clinicians for low-noise low-power biosignal amplifiers capable of amplifying signals in the millihertz-to-kilohertz range while rejecting large <b>dc</b> <b>offsets</b> generated at the electrode–tissue interface. The advent of fully implantable multielectrode arrays has created the need for fully integrated micropower amplifiers. We designed and tested a novel bioamplifier that uses a MOS-bipolar pseudoresistor element to amplify low-frequency signals down to the millihertz range while rejecting large <b>dc</b> <b>offsets.</b> We derive the theoretical noise–power tradeoff limit—the noise efficiency factor—for this amplifier and demonstrate that our VLSI implementation approaches this limit by selectively operating MOS transistors in either weak or strong inversion. The resulting amplifier, built in a standard 1. 5 - m CMOS process, passes signals from 0. 025 Hz to 7. 2 kHz with an input-referred noise of 2. 2 Vrms and a power dissipation of 80 W while consuming 0. 16 mm 2 of chip area. Our design technique was also used to develop an electroencephalogram amplifier having a bandwidth of 30 Hz and a power dissipation of 0. 9 W while maintaining a similar noise–power tradeoff.

40|$|Grid-interactive power {{converters}} are normally synchronized to the grid using phase-locked loops (PLLs). The {{performance of the}} PLLs {{is affected by the}} non-ideal conditions in the sensed grid voltage such as harmonics, frequency deviations and <b>dc</b> <b>offsets</b> in single-phase systems. In this paper, a single-phase PLL is presented to mitigate the effects of these non-idealities. This PLL is based on the popular second order generalized integrator (SOGI) structure. The SOGI structure is modified to eliminate of the effects of input <b>dc</b> <b>offsets.</b> The resulting SOGI structure has a high-pass filtering property. Hence, this PLL is termed as high-pass generalized integrator based PLL (HGI-PLL). It has fixed parameters which reduces the implementation complexity and aids in the implementation in low-end digital controllers. The HGI-PLL is shown to have least resource utilization among the SOGI based PLLs with dc cancelling capability. Systematic design methods are evolved leading to the design that limits the unit vector THD to within 1 % for given non-ideal input conditions in terms of frequency deviation and harmonic distortion. The proposed designs achieve the fastest transient response. The performance of this PLL has been verified experimentally. The results are found to agree with the theoretical prediction.
