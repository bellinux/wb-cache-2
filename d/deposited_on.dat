Several million years later {{a thin layer}} of hypervelocity impact ejecta from the Sudbury impact event was <b>deposited</b> <b>on</b> the older, underlying, Gunflint Iron Formation, and the Rove was then <b>deposited</b> <b>on</b> top of the ejecta; it is estimated that at ground zero the earthquake generated by the meteor impact would have registered 10.2 on the Richter scale.|$|E

5|$|As {{its name}} implies, the mistle thrush is {{important}} in propagating the mistletoe, an aerial parasite, which needs its seeds to be <b>deposited</b> <b>on</b> the branches of suitable trees.

5|$|As the {{pressure}} was released by the cabin rupture, the convective rush of air caused the flames to spread across the cabin, beginning the second phase.

5|$|Honeyeaters {{are clearly}} the most {{important}} pollination vector, as inflorescences from which honeyeaters are excluded generally do not set any fruit. Moreover, honeyeaters have been observed moving {{from tree to tree}} with significant loads of B.sessilis pollen on their foreheads, beaks and throats, having acquired it by brushing against pollen presenters while foraging for nectar; experiments have shown that some of this pollen may be subsequently <b>deposited</b> <b>on</b> stigmas during later foraging.|$|E

5|$|Carbon dating {{carried out}} at the University of Edinburgh dated the skull to between 1650 and 1880, while {{the fact that it}} had been <b>deposited</b> <b>on</b> top of a layer of Victorian tiles {{suggested}} that it belonged to the end of this era. The skull had fracture marks consistent with Webster's account of throwing Thomas down the stairs, and it was found to have low collagen levels, consistent with it being boiled. In July 2011, the coroner concluded that the skull was indeed that of Thomas. DNA testing was not possible as she had died childless and no relatives could be traced; in addition, there was no record of where the rest of her body had been buried.|$|E
5|$|Henoch–Schönlein purpura is a small-vessel {{vasculitis}} {{in which}} complexes of immunoglobulin A (IgA) and complement component 3 (C3) are <b>deposited</b> <b>on</b> arterioles, capillaries, and venules. As with IgA nephropathy, serum levels of IgA {{are high in}} HSP and there are identical findings on renal biopsy; however, IgA nephropathy has a predilection for young adults while HSP is more predominant among children. Further, IgA nephropathy typically only affects the kidneys while HSP is a systemic disease. HSP involves the skin and connective tissues, scrotum, joints, gastrointestinal tract and kidneys.|$|E
5|$|Honeyeaters {{prefer to}} forage at {{individual}} flowers which have only just opened, as these {{offer the most}} nectar. As they probe for nectar, honeyeaters end up with large quantities of pollen on their beaks, foreheads and throats, some of which they subsequently transfer to other flowers. This transfer is quite efficient: flowers typically lose nearly all their pollen within four hours of opening, and pollen is <b>deposited</b> <b>on</b> the majority of stigmata. Around 15% of these stigmata end up with pollen lodged in the stigmatic groove, a prerequisite to fertilisation.|$|E

5|$|Pitted terrain {{has been}} {{observed}} in four craters on Vesta: Marcia, Cornelia, Numisia and Licinia. The formation of the pitted terrain is proposed to be degassing of impact-heated volatile-bearing material. Along with the pitted terrain, curvilinear gullies are found in Marcia and Cornelia craters. The curvilinear gullies end in lobate deposits, which are sometimes covered by pitted terrain, and are proposed to form by the transient flow of liquid water after buried deposits of ice were melted by {{the heat of the}} impacts. Hydrated materials have also been detected, many of which are associated with areas of dark material. Consequently, dark material is thought to be largely composed of carbonaceous chondrite, which was <b>deposited</b> <b>on</b> the surface by impacts. Carbonaceous chondrites are comparatively rich in mineralogically bound OH.|$|E
5|$|The Proterozoic {{sedimentary}} formations of the Pahrump Group were <b>deposited</b> <b>on</b> these basement rocks. This occurred following uplift {{and erosion}} of any earlier sediments from the Proterozoic basement rocks. The Pahrump {{is composed of}} arkose conglomerate (quartz clasts in a concrete-like matrix) and mudstone in its lower part, followed by dolomite from carbonate banks topped by algal mats as stromatolites, and finished with basin-filling sediment derived from the above, including possible glacial till from the hypothesized Snowball Earth glaciation. The very youngest rocks in the Pahrump Group are basaltic lava flows.|$|E
5|$|The inner Solar System's {{period of}} giant impacts {{probably}} {{played a role}} in the Earth acquiring its current water content (~6kg) from the early asteroid belt. Water is too volatile to have been present at Earth's formation and must have been subsequently delivered from outer, colder parts of the Solar System. The water was probably delivered by planetary embryos and small planetesimals thrown out of the asteroid belt by Jupiter. A population of main-belt comets discovered in 2006 has been also suggested as a possible source for Earth's water. In contrast, comets from the Kuiper belt or farther regions delivered not more than about 6% of Earth's water. The panspermia hypothesis holds that life itself may have been <b>deposited</b> <b>on</b> Earth in this way, although this idea is not widely accepted.|$|E
