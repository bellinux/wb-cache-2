40|$|Background - Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a {{periodic}} <b>febrile</b> <b>disorder,</b> characterised by fever and serositis. The acute phase response during attacks of FMF {{results from the}} release of cytokines, which in turn induce increased expression and changed glycosylation of acute phase proteins. A recent study indicated that attacks in FMF are accompanied by a rise of plasma concentrations of serum amyloid A (SAA) and C reactive protein (CRP), which remain significantly raised during remission relative to healthy controls. Another study suggested that obligatory heterozygotes also display an inflammatory acute phase response. Objective - To determine the state of inflammation in homozygotic and heterozygotic MEFV genotypes. Methods - CRP and SAA were studied by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The glycosylation of the acute phase protein, α 1 -acid glycoprotein (AGP), was visualised with crossed affinoimmuno-electrophoresis with concanavalin A as diantennary glycan-specific component and Aleuria aurantia lectin as fucose-specific affinity component.

A recent study indicated that attacks in FMF are accompanied by a rise of plasma concentrations of serum amyloid A (SAA) and C reactive protein (CRP), which remain significantly raised during remission relative to healthy controls. Another study suggested that obligatory heterozygotes also display an inflammatory acute phase response.  OBJECTIVE—To determine the state of inflammation in homozygotic and heterozygotic MEFV genotypes.  METHODS—CRP and SAA were studied by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The glycosylation of the acute phase protein, α 1 -acid glycoprotein (AGP), was visualised with crossed affinoimmunoelectrophoresis with concanavalin A as diantennary glycan-specific component and Aleuria aurantia lectin as fucose-specific affinity component.  RESULTS—FMF attacks were associated with an increase (p< 0. 05) in the serum inflammation parameters CRP, SAA, and AGP. The glycosylation of AGP showed an increase (p< 0. 05) in fucosylated AGP glycoforms, whereas the branching of the glycans remained unaffected. The glycosylation of AGP in the MEFV carrier group, compared with that in a healthy control group, was characterised by a significant increase (p< 0. 05) in branching of the glycans, whereas the fucosylation remained unaffected.  CONCLUSION—The findings suggest an FMF-specific release of cytokines, resulting in a different glycosylation of AGP between a homozygotic and heterozygotic MEFV genotype. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{recurrence}} of fever {{in a child}} with a history of Kawasaki syndrome (KS) poses a dilemma for clinicians who must consider the possibility of recurrent KS. In this report we present the cases of 4 patients who presented with classical symptoms of KS, were successfully treated with intravenous immunoglobulin, and later experienced a reappearance of inflammatory symptoms in a pattern consistent with a recurrent fever syndrome. The association of these syndromes within the same patient suggests that some patients may have a genetic propensity toward altered immune responses and autoinflammatory syndromes. We propose that these 2 syndromes exist within a family of <b>febrile</b> <b>disorders</b> related to innate immune dysregulation...|$|R

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{pathogenesis}} of fever. The physiologic mechanisms controlling heat production and elimination have been studied extensively, but knowledge {{of the ways in which}} the equilibrium between these forces is disturbed in disease is scanty. The endotox~n ~ of Gram-negative bacteria are capable of inducing high fever (I) and there is evidence suggesting that in certain bacterial infections, particularly when there is bacteremia, these endotoxins may play a role in the production of fever (2). A few viruses have also been shown to possess pyrogenic properties (3, 4). On the other hand many common pathogenic microorganisms contain no fever-producing component and even in infections due to pryogen-producing bacteria there is reason to believe that the fever accompanying active infection is not due to bacterial pyrogeu alone (5, 6). Furthermore, many <b>febrile</b> <b>disorders</b> do not involve invasion of the body by any known infections agent ~ ~amples being neoplastic diseases, hemolytic crises, hypersensitivity states, vascular occlusions, and metabolic abnormalities such as thyroid storm, gout, and porphyria.

40|$|Hyperimmunoglobulinaemia D and {{periodic}} fever syndrome (HIDS; MIM 260920) is a rare, apparently monogenic, {{autosomal recessive}} disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of fever accompanied with lymphadenopathy, abdominal distress, joint involvement and skin lesions. All patients have high serum IgD values (> 100 U/ml) and HIDS 'attacks' {{are associated with}} an intense acute phase reaction whose exact pathophysiology remains obscure. Two other hereditary <b>febrile</b> <b>disorders</b> have been described. Familial Mediterranean fever (MIM 249100) is an autosomal recessive disorder affecting mostly populations from the Mediterranean basin and is caused by mutations in the gene MEFV (refs 5, 6). Familial Hibernian fever (MIM 142680), also known as autosomal dominant familial recurrent fever, is caused by missense mutations in the gene encoding type I tumour necrosis factor receptor. Here we perform a genome-wide search to map the HIDS gene. Haplotype analysis placed the gene at 12 q 24 between D 12 S 330 and D 12 S 79. We identified the gene MVK, encoding mevalonate kinase (MK, ATP:mevalonate 5 -phosphotransferase; EC 2. 7. 1. 36), as a candidate gene. We characterized 3 missense mutations, a 92 -bp loss stemming from a deletion or from exon skipping, {{and the absence of}} expression of one allele. Functional analysis demonstrated diminished MK activity in fibroblasts from HIDS patients. Our data establish MVK as the gene responsible for HIDS...|$|R
40|$|Skin {{and joint}} manifestations {{are part of}} the {{clinical}} spectrum of many disorders. Well-known associations include psoriatic arthritis and arthritis associated with autoimmune connective tissue diseases. This review focuses on less common associations where skin lesions can provide easily accessible and valuable diagnostic clues, and directly lead to the specific diagnosis or limit the list of possibilities. This may also affect health care resources as diagnostic tests are often low-specific, highly expensive and poorly available. This group of diseases can be divided into two subsets, based on the presence/absence of fever, and then further classified according to elementary skin lesions (macular, urticarial, maculo-papular, vesico-bullous, pustular, petechial and nodular). In most instances joint involvement occurs as peripheral migrating polyarthritis. Erythematosus macular or urticarial rashes occur in most <b>febrile</b> <b>disorders</b> such as monogenic autoinflammatory syndromes, Schnitzler's syndrome, Still's disease and rheumatic fever and afebrile diseases as urticarial vasculitis. Pustular rash may be observed in chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) and pyogenic arthritis with pyoderma gangrenosum and acne (PAPA) syndrome (both febrile) as well as in Behcet's disease and Synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis and osteitis syndrome (both non-febrile). Papular lesions are typical of secondary syphilis, sarcoidosis, interstitial granulomatous dermatitis, papular petechial of cutaneous small-vessel vasculitis and nodular lesions of polyarteritis nodosa and multicentric reticulohistiocytosis all of which are afebrile. Differential diagnosis includes infections and drug reactions which may mimic several of these conditions.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{reported}} for determining urinary xanthenuric acid (XA), a meta. bolite of tryptophan. XA is extracted from urine with isobutanol (2. methyl. 1. propanol), transferred to ammonium hydroxide, and separated from other urinary metabolites on thin. Iayer cellulose plates {{with use of}} 0. 2 acetate buffer, mol/liter, pH 5. 4. The XA is measured spectrophotometrically after diazotization with 2 -chloro- 4. nitroaniline. The method, which is specific for XA, {{can be used to}} measure amounts as low as 0. 4 aug/mI of urine. It has a range from 0 to 24 g/ml, and results within this range are reproducible within approximately ± 5 %. Data obtained by this procedure are compa. rable to results reported for other methods. rrhe measurement of urinary xanthurenic acid has been used clinically to study vitamin B 6 defi-ciency (1), <b>febrile</b> <b>disorders</b> (2), and the effects of steroid hormones and contraceptive agents on tryptophan metabolism (3). Current methods for measuring tryptophan metabolites in human urine are slow, cumbersome, and often unreliable. Among the techniques used have been ion-exchange resin chromatography (4), thin-layer and paper chromatography (5 - 9), sol-vent extraction and separation, and various methods of spectrophotometry and fluorometry (10 - 14). This report presents a sensitive, specific, and accurate method for the determnation of a trypto-phan metabolite, xanthurenic acid (xA),’in urine. XA is extracted from urine with isobutanol by a mo-dification of Cohen’s procedure (10), isolated by thin-layer chromatography (5), and finally the concentration is determined spectrophotometrically after diazotization with CNA, a reagent described by Bartels and Boehmer (15) for the determination of bilirubin in plasma...|$|R
40|$|Practitioners have {{continually}} remade Chinese medicine as they {{evaluated the}} canons of antiquity with their clinical experiences. The history of medical discourse on diseases from the Inner Canon of the Yellow Emperor {{to the present}} reveals a continual process of refashioning the medical canon to adapt to local conditions, suit changing therapeutic preferences, {{and add to the}} accumulated corpus of medical knowledge. The discourse over epidemics in medical texts during the Qing dynasty, in particular, took the form of a debate about the contrasts between two <b>febrile</b> <b>disorders</b> [...] Cold Damage (shanghan) and Warm Factor disorders (wenbing). This debate illustrates a broad epistemological shift from placing truth in the sage writings of antiquity, as evidential scholarship in Confucian learning did, to repositioning authority in the local experience of the individual physician. This shift represents a transformation of the framework in which Chinese physicians understood disease and how they practiced medicine. Of parallel importance, it also reveals a significant new social development: the nineteenth-century invention of a new Jiangnan-centered wenbing tradition of medicine. ^ With the formation of this new wenbing tradition, the epistemological framework shifted from the Cold Damage tradition (which promoted universal medical knowledge, continuity with antiquity, and the canonical authority of the Han medical classics) to the Warm Factor disorders tradition (which proclaimed regional variation, discontinuity with the past, and locally tailored prescriptions for the more delicate southern body of the Jiangnan patient). This socio-intellectual fissure in medical thought occurred {{within the context of a}} heightened awareness of regional and ethnic differences from at least the Qianlong reign to the end of the Qing dynasty. I base these arguments on close readings of original editions of medical texts and their prefaces, imperial medical publications and local gazetteers, biographies of physicians, and unofficial anecdotes and jottings. I use methodologies from social history, the sociology of knowledge, and cultural studies to inform my reading in Chinese medicine. ^ The history of writings on wenbing unveils a trend of criticism and reassessment of the orthodox Cold Damage tradition that was based on practical experience, local medical knowledge, and native-place identity. The transformation of wenbing from a category of disorders under the Cold Damage umbrella, from the Han dynasty through the end of the eighteenth century, to a distinct medical tradition with a collected body of texts, over the course of the nineteenth century, was fundamentally about reasserting and reproducing a Jiangnan regional identity. ...|$|R

All mutations affect conserved amino acids. Heterologous expression of the corresponding mutant mevalonate kinases as fusion proteins with glutathione S -transferase in Escherichia coli showed a profound effect of each of the mutations on enzyme activity. In addition, immunoblot analysis of fibroblast lysates from patients using specific antibodies against mevalonate kinase identified virtually no protein.

40|$|Background Febrile seizure is {{the most}} common seizure <b>disorders.</b> <b>Febrile</b> seizure is divided into two groups of simple and complex seizures.   The aim of this {{epidemiological}} study was to assess the risk factors involved in the incidence of febrile seizures between the children referred to Besat hospital in the city of Sanandaj (Iran). Materials and Methods The present paper is a cross-sectional study performed on 334 children with 6 - 60 months of age hospitalized in Besat hospital in Sanandaj due to febrile seizures in 2014 and 2015. The data collection tool was a checklist including some information such as age, gender, final diagnosis and type of seizure, residential location, serum level of electrolytes and CBC. After collecting the data, description and analytical analysis were performed through SPSS version     20 software to assess the data. Results Among the 334 children (average age 22. 4 + 12. 8 months) hospitalized because of febrile        seizures, 57. 5 present were boys and the majority of them were living in the urban areas (72. 2 ‰). Also, 81 percent of the children were hospitalized due to simple febrile seizures and upper respiratory   tract infection (URTI) was {{the most common cause of}} febrile seizures with 42. 8 percent.

40|$|Since the {{increased}} sinking velocity of red cells seen in pregnancy and in various diseases {{is due to}} an aggregation of the ceils, {{the question of the}} mechanism of {{the increased}} rate of sinking becomes that of the factors promoting aggregation; the influence of changes in cell or plasma specific gravity and in plasma viscosity is usually negligible. The problem which presented itself may be stated as follows. The aggregation and therefore the sinking velocity of red cells are increased in human plasmas high in fibrinogen, as in pregnancy and in various <b>febrile</b> and neoplastic <b>disorders.</b> Aggregation and sinking velocity are increased by pure fibrinogen solutions and by various other agents, as gelatin, gum acacia, and casein; serum globulin is much less effective than fibrinogen and albumin almost without effect. Sinking velocity is proportional to the degree of aggregation of the cells as determined microscopically. The aggregation brought about by fibrinogen or gelatin is a rouleau formation and not, as in specific agglutination, a sticking at the first point of contact. The principal differences between slowly and rapidly settling human bloods are in the plasma, since the ceils of a non-pregnant woman sink almost as fast in "pregnant plasma " as do those of a pregnant woman, while pregnant and non-pregnant cells both sink slowly " in non-pregnant plasma. The possibility of a difference in the ceils of slowly and rapidly settling human bloods has not been excluded; we have demonstrated such differences in the cells of different species. The cells of horse blood settle many times as fast as those of beef blood, al...|$|R
