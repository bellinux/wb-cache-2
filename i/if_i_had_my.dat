2500|$|Near {{the end of}} {{his life}} Barlow was quoted in the Manchester Guardian: [...] "I don't think any cricketer has enjoyed his cricketing career better than I have done, and <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>my</b> time to come over again I should {{certainly}} be what I have been all my life – a professional cricketer".|$|E
2500|$|Stevens {{contracted}} tuberculosis in 1969 and {{was close}} to death {{at the time of}} his admittance to the King Edward VII Hospital, Midhurst, West Sussex. He spent months recuperating in the hospital and a year of convalescence. During this time Stevens began to question aspects of his life and spirituality. He later said, [...] "to go from the show business environment and find you are in hospital, getting injections day in and day out, and people around you are dying, it certainly changes your perspective. I got down to thinking about myself. It seemed almost as <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>my</b> eyes shut." ...|$|E
2500|$|The ritualistic {{elements}} {{involved in}} the execution of Coleman’s murder {{may have been in}} response to a public sermon made three years earlier by Brigham Young on March 3, 1863. In this sermon, Young states, “I am a human being, and I have the care of human beings. I wish to save life, and have no desire to destroy life. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>my</b> wish, I should entirely stop the shedding of human blood.” Following this statement, however, Young makes a statement regarding interracial relations in which he continues, [...] "Shall I tell you the law of God in regard to the African race? If the white man who belongs to the chosen seed mixes his blood with the seed of Cain, the penalty, under the law of God, is death on the spot. This will always be so." [...] Young continues his sermon by condemning whites for their abuse of slaves with the proclamation, “for their abuse of that race, the whites will be cursed, unless they repent.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{returning}} from the race in a distressed state, the colt {{showed no sign of}} injury and made a full recovery within twenty-four hours. This led to a great deal of rumour and speculation as observers attempted to explain the performance. Several horses in the Hern stable had been suffering from a respiratory infection in October and it was suggested that Gorytus may have been a sick horse {{on the day of the}} race. Hern, however, denied this, pointing out that the horse had been carefully monitored and tested in the build-up to the Dewhurst and had shown no sign of illness. Carson reported that the horse might have [...] "swallowed his tongue", but this was not supported by veterinary examination: the jockey later suggested that the horse's temperament was at fault, saying that [...] "he took the mickey out of us after his first two races. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>my</b> time again I'd ride him differently". The most popular theory was that Gorytus had been [...] "got at" [...] or [...] "nobbled": that is to say that a substance had been deliberately administered to the colt to prevent him from winning. Richard Baerlein, writing in The Guardian reported that the horse had been seen defecating with abnormal frequency before the race and suggested that Gorytus had been doped with croton oil, a substance used as a laxative for elephants. This would, however, would not be consistent with Hern's statement that the colt lost only ten pounds during the race. Hern had been congratulated by Phil Bull at Ayr Racecourse a week after Gorytus's win at Doncaster, and Bull had warned Hern that his biggest problem would be security, as some bookmakers had laid the horse to lose so much in the 2,000 Guineas that they could not afford to pay if he won the race. [...] The tabloid Daily Star presented the theory that the colt had been affected by exposure to an irritant, administered in an aerosol spray as he was led round the pre-race paddock. Carson however, rejected this idea by saying that no-one had come close enough to the horse to carry out this type of attack. If a substance was administered to the horse, it was not one detectable by testing procedures at the time: the post-race drug test carried out by the Jockey Club produced a negative result.|$|E
