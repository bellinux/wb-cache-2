Although the singer was born almost 12 years after Joanne's death, the latter's influence was predominant on the Germanotta family and Gaga's work, including naming her fifth studio album as Joanne. Joanne Trattoria, an Italian restaurant located at West 68th Street in New York City, was opened in January 2012 by Gaga. The restaurant is co-owned by Gaga's parents, Joe and Cynthia Germanotta. Chef Art Chef had met Gaga during a taping of The Oprah Winfrey Show, and partnered with Gaga for working in the restaurant. The New York Times described the place as having a [...] "well-stocked bar, a cozy back patio and seating for about 70 people". A long dream of Joe Germanotta, the restaurant serves Southern Italian cuisine.

Peasants, even among the poorest ones, were reluctant to accept land taken from the Church and offered to them, and as late as May 1940 some villages had not yet expropriated church lands, while others distributed much of it to priests' families. Priests made homeless were taken in by parishioners. Children, who no longer learned religion in school, obtained religious instruction privately.|$|R

5000|$|Elections in Czechoslovakia {{were held}} not {{to offer the}} {{electorate}} an {{opportunity to participate in}} a democratic choice of their government representatives but to confirm the representatives chosen by the KSC hierarchy. The 1960 constitution guaranteed multicandidate(but not multiparty) elections by requiring that the number of candidates to the National Assembly be greater than the number of posts. VoThe July 1971 electoral law lengthened the time between elections from four to five years (1971, 1976, 1981, 1986, and so forth) and designated that they take place in the fall, so that each election comes shortly after the party congress in the spring. The 1971 law replaced a 1967 electoral law that allowed the electorate to participate in the choice of candidates; the 1967 law was never applied because the 1968 elections were postponed by the August invasion. The November 1971 elections, then, were the first to be held since 1964. In these and subsequent elections, the National Front--nominally a coalition of all parties, but in truth controlled by the Communists--proposed single slates of candidates for the Federal Assembly, the two national councils, and the regional, district, and municipal national committees. The voter only had the option to cross out (disapprove) or not cross out (approve) the name of any or all official candidates nominated by the National <b>Front.</b> Polling <b>booths</b> are rarely used, and voting was often carried out collectively by the work force of each enterprise or by other groups of the population.|$|R

The standard Mac Pro featured two 2.66 GHz dual core Xeon (Woodcrest) processors, 1 GB RAM, 250 GB hard drive, and a 256 MB video card. An Xserve update, based on the dual core Xeons, was also announced. Redundant power and Lights Out Management were further product improvements to Apple's server lineup.
