Avaliaram-se as características: resistência à difusão do vapor de água na folha (Rd), condutância estomática (Ce), transpiração, teor relativo de água na folha (TRA) e potencial de água na folha (Yf) das plantas de pimentão, além de temperatura e radiação solar fotossinteticamente ativa (PAR). Os resultados demonstraram que as plantas de pimentão apresentam alterações no mecanismo fisiológico em função das condições hidro-climáticas ocorrentes ao longo do dia. O horário entre 12 h e 14 h é o mais indicado para a realização de determinações fisiológicas em plantas onde se deseja comparar o efeito do manejo diferenciado da disponibilidade hídrica, devido ser intervalo onde as variações destas características são mínimas.

50|$|A {{plurilateral}} {{treaty is}} a special type of multilateral treaty. A plurilateral treaty is a treaty between {{a limited number of}} states with a particular interest in the subject of the treaty. The primary difference between a plurilateral treaty and other multilateral treaties is that the <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>reservations</b> is more limited under a plurilateral treaty. Due to the limited nature of a plurilateral treaty, the full cooperation of the parties to the treaty is required in order for the object of the treaty to be met. As a result, reservations to plurilateral treaties are not allowed without the consent of all other parties to the treaty. This principle is codified in international law by article 20(2) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties:When it appears from the limited number of the negotiating states and the object and purpose of a treaty that the application of the treaty in its entirety between all the parties is an essential condition of the consent of each one to be bound by the treaty, a reservation requires acceptance by all the parties.|$|R

A primary contribution of our work is that our design is modular and provides a separation of the scheduler itself from the application-specific components needed for the scheduling process. As part of the scheduler, we have also developed a search procedure which effectively and efficiently identifies desirable schedules. As test cases for our approach, we selected two applications from the class of iterative, mesh-based applications. For each of the test applications, we developed data mappers and performance models. We used a prototype of our approach in conjunction with these application-specific components to perform validation experiments in production Grid environments. Our results show that our scheduler provides significantly better application performance than conventional scheduling strategies. We also show that our scheduler gracefully <b>handles</b> degraded levels <b>of</b> <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> application and Grid resource information.

30|$|Titan is {{essentially}} a programming model and {{a new way to}} deploy activity-aware Pervasive Apps in dynamic and heterogeneous environments at run time. We argue that Titan is well equipped to <b>handle</b> changing <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> processing resources (Section 5.1). However, Titan per se does not contain built-in mechanisms to deal with changing <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> sensors to perform activity recognition. This is an aspect that cannot be addressed solely by a programming model and run-time engine. It must be considered from a signal processing and machine learning perspective also. We discuss in Section 5.2 new signal processing and machine learning techniques developed by our group and others which aim at addressing some aspects of activity recognition with changing <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> sensors. We show that the design of Titan allows for the inclusion of such techniques into an activity-aware system. Combining these techniques with Titan further supports our objective of deploying activity-aware Pervasive Apps in real-world open-ended environments.|$|R

The purpose of the OTA Shear Program was to provide equipment that is needed for the processing of 40 foot long, sodium wetted, irradiated core components previously used in the FFTF reactor to monitor fuel and materials tests. There are currently 15 of these OTA test stalks located in the Test Assembly Conditioning Station (TACS) inerted vault. These need to be dispositioned for a shutdown mission to eliminate this highly activated, high dose inventory prior to turnover to the ERC since they must be handled by remote operations. These would also need to be dispositioned for a restart mission to free up the vault they currently reside in. The waste handling and cleaning equipment in the J 33 M Cell was designed and built for the <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> reactor components up to the standard 12 foot length. This program will provide the equipment to the IEM Cell to remotely section the OTAS into pieces less than 12 feet in length to allow for the necessary handling and cleaning operations required for proper disposition. Due to the complexity of all operations associated with remote <b>handling,</b> the <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> the IEM Cell training facility, and the major difficulty with reworking contaminated equipment, it was determined that preliminary testing of the equipment was desirable, This testing activity would provide the added assurance that the equipment will operate as designed prior to performance of the formal Acceptance Test Procedure (ATP) at the IEM Cell, This testing activity will also allow for some operator familiarity and procedure checkout prior to actual installation into the IEM Cell.

Objectives: To determine the impact <b>of</b> considering the <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> new drugs on the optimal initiation criteria for ART and outcomes in patients with HIV/AIDS. Methods: We enhanced a previously described simulation model of the optimal time to initiate ART to incorporate the rate <b>of</b> <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> new antiviral drugs.

40|$|When {{operating}} a cellular radio system at nearly full capacity, admitting yet another user may jeopardize {{the stability of}} the system as well as the performance of the individual users. Therefore, proper admission control is crucial. Prior art includes algorithms which are limiting the number of users or the uplink interference per cell. Both are known to yield roughly the same performance, but the former is difficult to configure, and the latter is based on a quantity, which is hard to measure accurately. The core idea in this work is to predict the relative load of the system directly, given that a user is admitted. Then, the user will be admitted if the predicted load in the specific cell, and in its neighbors, is below some threshold. The proposed uplink relative load estimate is focused on WCDMA. It utilizes measurements readily available in that system, either periodically scheduled or from handover events. Multi-services are naturally <b>handled,</b> and <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> high data-rate services are automatically limited with respect to coverage, compared to services of lower data-rate. Simulations indicate that the admission control operates satisfactory in different traffic situations with a universal parameter setting. Furthermore, the reporting overhead with periodical measurements can be avoided, since handover event-driven measurements yield roughly the same performance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Increasing the {{productivity}} of solar stills {{has been the focus}} of intensive research. Many introduced developments, however, require complex components and entail notable increases in cost and land requirements. Developing a compact, productive, and easy-to-operate system is a main challenge. This paper describes a sustainable modification of the solar still that significantly enhances its productivity without forsaking its basic features. A simple amendment in the form of a slowly rotating drum is introduced allowing the formation of thin water films that evaporate rapidly and are continually renewed. The performance of this system was compared against a control without the introduced drum. Throughout the experiment, the new system gave considerably higher yield than the control with an average increase in daily productivity of 200 %. Moreover, during sunshine hours, the increase in yield could surpass 6 – 8 times that of the control. Important parameters such as ease <b>of</b> <b>handling,</b> material <b>availability,</b> efficacy, low cost, safe water quality, and space conservation are maintained. One side-benefit of this design is solving stagnation problems that usually develop in conventional stills. The new simple modification in this study presents a cost-effective and efficient design to solar stills especially in areas with abundant sunshine...|$|R
