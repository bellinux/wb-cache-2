40|$|Colony-forming human {{epidermal}} {{cells are}} heterogeneous in their capacity for sustained growth. Once a clone has been {{derived from a}} single cell, its growth potential can be estimated from the colony types resulting from a single plating, and the clone can be {{assigned to one of}} three classes. The <b>holoclone</b> has the greatest reproductive capacity: under standard conditions, fewer than 5 % of the colonies formed by the cells of a <b>holoclone</b> abort and terminally differentiate. The paraclone contains exclusively cells with a short replicative lifespan (not more than 15 cell generations), after which they uniformly abort and terminally differentiate. The third type of clone, the meroclone, contains a mixture of cells of different growth potential and is a transitional stage between the <b>holoclone</b> and the paraclone. The incidence of the different clonal types is affected by aging, since cells originating from the epidermis of older donors give rise to a lower proportion of holoclones and a higher proportion of paraclones...|$|E
40|$|Aldehyde {{dehydrogenase}} 1 (ALDH) {{activity is}} considered to be a marker of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in many tumour models, since these cells are more proliferative and tumourigenic than ALDH(Lo) cells in experimental models. However it is unclear whether all CSC-like cells are within the ALDH(Hi) population, or whether all ALDH(Hi) cells are highly proliferative and tumourigenic. The ability to establish a stem cell hierarchy in vitro, whereby sub-populations of cells have differing proliferative and differentiation capacities, is an alternate indication of the presence of stem cell-like populations within cell lines. In this study, we have examined the interaction between ALDH status and the ability to establish a stem cell hierarchy in PC 3 prostate cancer cells. We demonstrate that PC 3 cells contain a stem cell hierarchy, and isolation of ALDH(Hi) cells enriches for the most primitive <b>holoclone</b> population, however <b>holoclone</b> formation is not restricted to ALDH(Hi) cells. In addition, we show that ALDH activity undergoes phenotypic plasticity, since the ALDH(Lo) population can develop ALDH(Hi) populations comparable to parental cells within 2 weeks in culture. Furthermore, we show that the majority of ALDH(Hi) cells are found within the least primitive paraclone population, which is circumvented by culturing PC 3 cells as spheroids in defined medium favouring stem cell characteristics. Although ALDH(Hi) status enriches for <b>holoclone</b> formation, this activity may be mediated by a minority of ALDH(Hi) cells...|$|E
40|$|MicroRNAs are {{critical}} regulators {{of stem cell}} behavior. The miR- 103 / 107 family is preferentially expressed in the stem cell-enriched corneal limbal epithelium and {{plays an important role}} in coordinating several intrinsic characteristics of limbal epithelial stem cells. To elucidate further the mechanisms by which miRs- 103 / 107 function in regulating limbal epithelial stem cells, we investigate the global effects of miRs- 103 / 107 on gene expression in an unbiased manner. Using antagomirs- 103 / 107, we knocked down endogenous miRs- 103 / 107 in keratinocytes and conducted an mRNA profiling study. We show that miRs- 103 / 107 target mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 7 (MAP 3 K 7) and thereby negatively regulate the p 38 /AP- 1 pathway, which directs epithelial cells towards a differentiated state. Pharmacological inhibition of p 38 increases <b>holoclone</b> colony formation, a measure of proliferative capacity. This suggests that the negative regulation of p 38 by miRs- 103 / 107 contributes to enhanced proliferative capacity, which is a hallmark of stem cells. Since miRs- 103 / 107 also promote increased <b>holoclone</b> colony formation by regulating JNK activation through non-canonical Wnt signaling, we believe that this microRNA family preserves "stemness" by mediating the crosstalk between the Wnt/JNK and MAP 3 K 7 /p 38 /AP- 1 pathways...|$|E
40|$|Cultured human {{epidermal}} keratinocyte {{stem cells}} (<b>holoclones)</b> are crucial for regenerative medicine for burns and genetic disorders. In serial culture, <b>holoclones</b> progressively lose their proliferative capacity to become transient amplifying cells with limited growth (paraclones), a phenomenon termed clonal conversion. Although it negatively impacts the culture lifespan {{and the success}} of cell transplantation, little is known on the molecular mechanism underlying clonal conversion. Here, we show that <b>holoclones</b> and paraclones differ in their actin filament organization, with actin bundles distributed radially in <b>holoclones</b> and circumferentially in paraclones. Moreover, actin organization sets the stage for a differing response to epidermal growth factor (EGF), since EGF signalling induces a rapid expansion of colony size in <b>holoclones</b> and a significant reduction in paraclones. Furthermore, inhibition of PI 3 K or Rac 1 in <b>holoclones</b> results in the reorganization of actin filaments in a pattern that {{is similar to that of}} paraclones. Importantly, continuous Rac 1 inhibition in <b>holoclones</b> results in clonal conversion and reduction of growth potential. Together, our data connect loss of stem cells to EGF-induced colony dynamics governed by Rac 1...|$|R
40|$|When primary {{cultures}} of normal cells are cloned, {{three types of}} colony grow, called <b>holoclones,</b> meroclones and paraclones. These colonies {{are believed to be}} derived from stem cells, transit-amplifying cells and differentiated cells respectively. More recently, this approach has been extended to cancer cell lines. However, we observed that meroclones from the prostate cancer cell line DU 145 produce <b>holoclones,</b> a paradoxical observation as meroclones are thought to be derived from transit-amplifying cells. The {{purpose of this study was}} to confirm this observation and determine if both <b>holoclones</b> and meroclones from cancer cell lines contain stem cells. We demonstrated that both <b>holoclones</b> and meroclones can be serially passaged indefinitely, are highly proliferative, can self-renew to form spheres, are serially tumorigenic and express stem cell markers. This study demonstrates that the major difference between <b>holoclones</b> and meroclones derived from a cancer cell line is the proportion of stem cells within each colony, not the presence or absence of stem cells. These findings may reflect the properties of cancer as opposed to normal cells, perhaps indicating that the hierarchy of stem cells is more extensive in cancer...|$|R
40|$|Primary keratinocytes exhibit three typical clonal morpholo-gies {{represented}} by <b>holoclones,</b> meroclones, and paraclones, with <b>holoclones</b> containing self-renewing stem cells, and meroclones and paraclones containing more mature and differentiated cells. Interestingly, long-term–cultured human epithelial cancer cells in clonal cultures also form <b>holoclones,</b> meroclones, and paraclones, and tumor cell <b>holoclones</b> have been hypothesized to harbor stem-like cells or cancer stem cells. However, {{the key question}} of whether tumor cell holo-clones genuinely contain tumor-initiating cells has not been directly addressed. Here, using PC 3 human prostate carcino-ma cells as a model, we provide direct experimental evidence that tumor cell <b>holoclones</b> contain stem-like cells that can initiate serially transplantable tumors. Importantly, holo-clones derived from either cultured PC 3 cells or holoclone-initiated tumors can be serially passaged and regenerate all three types of clones. In contrast, meroclones and paraclones cannot be continuously propagated and fail to initiate tumor development. Phenotypic characterizations reveal high levels of CD 44, A 2 B 1 integrin, and B-catenin expression in holo-clones, whereas meroclones and paraclones show markedly reduced expression of these stem cell markers.

40|$|Predicting {{the risks}} of {{permanent}} gene therapy approaches involving the use of integrative gene-targeting vectors has become a critical issue after the unfortunate episode of a clinical trial in children with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID).

Human epidermal stem cells, which have extensive proliferative potential in vitro, theoretically offer such a possibility as a method of assessment. By means of optimized organotypic culture and grafting methods, we demonstrate the long-term in vivo regenerative capacity of single gene-targeted human epidermal stem cell clones (holoclones). Both histopathological analysis of holoclone-derived grafts in immunodeficient mice and retroviral insertion site mapping performed in the <b>holoclone</b> in vitro and after grafting provide proof of the feasibility of pre-assessing genotoxicity risks in isolated stem cells before transplantation into patients.

40|$|Human limbal {{stem cells}} produce transit amplifying {{progenitors}} that migrate centripetally to regenerate the corneal epithelium. Coexpression of CCAAT enhancer binding protein (C/EBP), Bmi 1, and Np 63 identifies mitotically quiescent limbal stem cells, which generate holoclones in culture. Upon corneal injury, {{a fraction of}} these cells switches off C/EBP and Bmi 1, proliferates, and differentiates into mature corneal cells. Forced expression of C/EBP inhibits the growth of limbal colonies and increases the cell cycle length of primary limbal cells through the activity of p 27 Kip 1 and p 57 Kip 2. These effects are reversible; do not alter the limbal cell proliferative capacity; and are not due to apoptosis, senescence, or differentiation. C/EBP, but not Np 63, indefinitely promotes <b>holoclone</b> self-renewal and prevents clonal evolution, suggesting that self-renewal and proliferation are distinct, albeit related, processes in limbal stem cells. C/EBP is recruited to the chromatin of positively (p 27 Kip 1 and p 57 Kip 2) and negatively (p 16 INK 4 A and involucrin) regulated gene loci, suggesting a direct role of this transcription factor in determining limbal stem cell identity...|$|E

Increasing evidences suggest that cancer stem cells reside in the cells capable of forming <b>holoclones</b> continuously. However, in pancreatic cancer, holoclone-forming cells have not been characterized yet. Therefore, the goal of our present study was to indentify the holoclone-forming pancreatic cancer stem cells and develop an in vitro continuous colony formation system, which will greatly facilitate the study of pancreatic cancer stem cells. Pancreatic cancer cell line BxPC 3 was submitted to monoclonal cultivation to generate colonies. Based on the morphologies, colonies were classified and analyzed for their capacities of secondary colony formation, long-term survival in vitro, tumor formation in vivo, and drug resistance. Flowcytometry and quantitative RT-PCR were performed to detect the expression level of cancer stem cells associated cell surface markers, regulatory genes and microRNAs in distinct types of colonies. Three types of colonies with distinct morphologies were identified and termed as holo-, mero-, and paraclones, in which only <b>holoclones</b> generated descendant colonies of all three types in further passages.

40|$|Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is {{the most}} common type of soft tissue sarcoma in {{children}} and can be divided into two main subtypes: embryonal (eRMS) and alveolar (aRMS). Among the cellular heterogeneity of tumors, the existence of a small fraction of cells called cancer stem cells (CSC), thought to be responsible for the onset and propagation of cancer, has been demonstrated in some neoplasia. Although the existence of CSC has been reported for eRMS, their existence in aRMS, the most malignant subtype, has not been demonstrated to date. Given the lack of suitable markers to identify this subpopulation in aRMS, we used cancer stem cell-enriched supracellular structures (spheres and <b>holoclones)</b> to study this subpopulation. This strategy allowed us to demonstrate the capacity of both aRMS and eRMS cells to form these structures and retain self-renewal capacity.

Accumulating evidence indicates that miRNAs play critical roles in lung CSCs.

However, YAP 1 was also reported to be a tumor suppressor as its gene locus is deleted in some breast cancers. To clarify the role of this protein in the physiology of rapidly renewal cells, we investigated YAP 1 in human keratinocytes. Here, we show that YAP 1 overexpression in primary human keratinocytes blocks clonal evolution and induces cell immortalization, but not malignant transformation. YAP 1 overexpression led {{to an increase in}} cell proliferation, colony forming efficiency and <b>holoclone</b> percentage. Cells escaped from senescence, immortalized but still remained unable to grow in soft agar or express mesenchymal markers, suggesting that YAP 1 overexpression is not sufficient to promote a complete epithelial-mesenchymal transition and tumorigenic transformation.

The expression of LEKTI, a late differentiation marker, dramatically dropped to undetectable levels. Taken together, these data suggest that YAP 1 -overexpressing keratinocytes are maintained in the proliferative compartment...|$|E
40|$|Lung {{cancer is}} among the most lethal {{malignancies}} with a high metastasis and recurrence rate, which is probably due to the existence of lung cancer stem cells (CSCs). CSCs in many tumors including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have been identified using adhesion molecular CD 44, either individually or in combination with other marker(s). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate both normal stem cells and CSCs and dysregulation of miRNAs has been implicated in tumorigenesis. Recently, miR- 34 a was found to be downregulated in NSCLC cells but the biological functions of miR- 34 a in regulating NSCLC cell behavior have not been extensively studied.

40|$|PhDOral {{squamous}} cell carcinomas (OSCC) appear {{to contain a}} sub-population of cells endowed with indefinite self-renewal capacity, usually referred to as cancer stem cells (CSCs). These cells are clonogenic and are responsible, in all probability, for tumour initiation and propagation. Cancer cell lines consistently show morphological patterns similar to normal keratinocytes (<b>holoclones,</b> meroclones and paraclones) reflecting a hierarchical organization associated with stem, amplifying and differentiated cells. In-vitro studies of OSCC cell lines have revealed further phenotypic differences in colony formation between the stem and non-stem fractions and have identified cell surface proteins such as CD 44, E-Cadherin, Ã 9 ̆f-catenin and Vimentin which are differentially expressed in association with stemness. Recent studies suggest tumour progression {{to be associated with}} Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), a process occurring in SCCs which confers invasiveness and motility to CSCs and also suggests a strong involvement of external factors such as those present within the tumour-host microenvironment. Analysis of these properties may provide insight into mechanisms of stem cell fate determination and provide mechanisms for therapeutic targeting of CSCs. Methods and Materials: Immunocytochemistry was used to analyze differential expression of cell surface and internal markers for their role in stemness and EMT, FACS was used to isolate and analyze sub-fractions of cells for clonal studies. Real time videos of cell lines were used to examine cell movement in colonies and cell acquisition of a fibroblastic phenotype. As a test of whether this process is actually EMT, cells were exposed to TGF-Ã 9 ̆f, a known inducer of EMT, to determine whether this enhanced the formation of the mesenchymal-looking cells at colony margins. Results and Conclusions: Video images showed cells at the margins of <b>holoclones</b> acquiring a motile phenotype. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that certain stem-cell-related cell surface molecules were expressed at higher levels in <b>holoclones</b> than paraclones and at different levels within <b>holoclones.</b> Expression of CD 44 was stronger in the center than at the edge of <b>holoclones</b> suggesting that this molecule plays a role in maintaining a stem-like state. Some images indicated nuclear translocation of CD 44 and Ã 9 ̆f-catenin at colony margins. TGF-Ã 9 ̆f increased the incidence of mesenchymal-like cells at the edges of colonies and seemed to scatter and mobilize these cells with loss of the normal colony architecture.

Methodology/Principal Findings: Human LPC epithelia was extracted for small RNAs or dissociated for CEPC culture. By Agilent Human microRNA Microarray V 2 platform and GeneSpring GX 11. 0 analysis, we found differential expression of 18 microRNAs against central corneal (CC) epithelia, which were devoid of CEPCs.

Methods: Limbal and peripheral corneal explant cultures were pulse labeled with 5 - 5 -bromo- 2 #-deoxyuridine (BrdU) for 5 days, followed by a period of 3 -week chase. Cultured explants were cryosectioned and stained for BrdU. The epithelial cells in the outgrowth and those remaining on the explant were isolated and subjected to cytospin and double immunostaining for BrdU and p 63, followed by identification of label-retaining cells (LRCs) and quantification of p 63 expression using confocal microscopy. Results: A distinct population of small cells with large N/C ratio expressing high levels of p 63 retained the BrdU label after 21 -day chase. Further, this population of LRCs, negative for the differen-tiation marker K 3, was observed in the epithelial outgrowth of limbal but not in that of peripheral cornea. LRCs were seen to migrate along the cut edge of limbal explants in culture and were also observed as clusters of small cells in the outgrowth, which contained cells with the ability to form <b>holoclone</b> colonies. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that the small cells with large N/C ratio and high levels of p 63 have BrdU label retaining slow-cycling property, thus confirming that these 2 parameters in combination may serve as a precise marker for identification and quantification of ex vivo–expanded limbal SCs.

Some polypeptides are more abundant in putative epidermal stem cells than in TA cells, but no polypeptide {{confined to the}} stem cells has yet been identified. Here we show that the p 63 transcription factor, a p 53 homologue essential for regenerative proliferation in epithelial development, distinguishes human keratinocyte stem cells from their TA progeny. Within the cornea, nuclear p 63 is expressed by the basal cells of the limbal epithelium, but not by TA cells covering the corneal surface. Human keratinocyte stem and TA cells when isolated in culture give rise to <b>holoclones</b> and paraclones, respectively. We show by clonal analysis that p 63 is abundantly expressed by epidermal and limbal <b>holoclones,</b> but is undetectable in paraclones. TA keratinocytes, immediately after their withdrawal from the stem cell compartment (meroclones), have greatly reduced p 63, even though they possess very appreciable proliferative capacity.

Keratinocytes whose 14 - 3 - 3 final sigma has been down-regulated remain in the stem cell compartment and maintain p 63 during serial cultivation.

40|$|Osteosarcoma (OS) is {{the most}} common bone {{malignancy}} often producing aggressive tumours in adolescents. OS aetiology is poorly understood, however, recent studies suggest OS cancers contain a small population of cancer stem cells (CSC) which initiate tumour growth. The cancer stem cell hypothesis describes cancers as a hierarchical population of heterogeneous cells. It has been proposed that CSC are at the base of this hierarchy and are responsible for the initiation, growth and spread of the tumour and pose a therapeutic challenge due to enhanced chemotherapy resistance. This project had three aims: identifying whether OS cell lines contain subpopulations of putative CSC, identifying if CSC contribute to chemotherapeutic resistance and to elucidate paracrine cell signals controlling OS tumour growth. Eight OS cell lines (143 B, Cal 72, G 292, HOS, MG 63, MNNG-HOS, U 2 OS and SaOS- 2) along with the breast cancer cell line MCF 7 have been analysed for the presence of sub-population of cells expressing putative CSC markers (aldehyde dehydrogenase and CD 117). The intracellular enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) and tyrosine kinase receptor CD 117 were found to be heterogeneously expressed amongst the cell lines. All cell lines when plated at low density could recapitulate the colony hierarchies based on variation in colony morphology (<b>holoclones,</b> meroclones and paraclones), this was originally observed in carcinoma cell lines and is further putative evidence a CSC hierarchy exists within these cell lines.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Recent studies {{indicate}} {{the presence of a}} small, stem-like cell population in several human cancers that is crucial for the tumour (re) population. OBJECTIVE: Six established prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines-DU 145, DuCaP, LAPC- 4, 22 Rv 1, LNCaP, and PC- 3 -were examined for their stem cell properties in vitro. DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS: The colony-forming efficiency and self-renewal ability of morphologically distinguishable holoclones and paraclones were tested with low-density plating and serial passaging. Expression of the putative stem cell marker CD 133 and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) was examined with flow cytometry, and immunohistochemical stainings were made for CD 133, alpha 2 -integrin, nestin, BCRP, cytokeratin 5 (CK 5), and cytokeratin 18 (CK 18). RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Five out of six cell lines formed clear holo-, mero-, and paraclones. Unlike paraclones, we can maintain DU 145 holoclones in culture for several passages, which is indicative of self-renewal ability. Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis only in DU 145 cells, a small fraction (0. 01 %) of CD 133 (+) cells was detected. CD 133 (+) cells; however, like DU 145 BCRP(+) (0. 15 %) cells, they were not more clonogenic, and they did not show more <b>holoclone</b> formation than the marker-negative cells or unselected cells. Immunohistochemistry revealed alpha 2 -integrin and BCRP as potential stem cell markers and CK 5 with the combination of CK 18 to distinguish transient amplifying cells. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate the possible presence of stem-like cells in several established PCa cell lines. CD 133 selection does not enrich for stem-like cells in PCa cell lines...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Cancer stem-like {{cells are}} {{proposed}} to sustain solid tumors {{by virtue of}} their capacity for self-renewal and differentiation to cells that comprise the bulk of the tumor, and have been identified for a variety of cancers based on characteristic clonal morphologies and patterns of marker gene expression. Methods Single cell cloning and spheroid culture studies were used to identify a population of cancer stem-like cells in the androgen-independent human prostate cancer cell line PC 3. Results We demonstrate that, under standard culture conditions, ~ 10 % of PC 3 cells form holoclones with cancer stem cell characteristics. These holoclones display high self-renewal capability in spheroid formation assays under low attachment and serum-free culture conditions, retain their <b>holoclone</b> morphology when passaged at high cell density, exhibit moderate drug resistance, and show high tumorigenicity in scid immunodeficient mice. PC 3 holoclones readily form spheres, and PC 3 -derived spheres yield a high percentage of holoclones, further supporting their cancer stem cell-like nature. We identified one gene, FAM 65 B, whose expression is consistently up regulated in PC 3 holoclones compared to paraclones, the major cell morphology in the parental PC 3 cell population, and two genes, MFI 2 and LEF 1, that are consistently down regulated. This molecular profile, FAM 65 B high /MFI 2 low /LEF 1 low, also characterizes spheres generated from parental PC 3 cells. The PC 3 holoclones did not show significant enriched expression of the putative prostate cancer stem cell markers CD 44 and integrin α 2 β 1. PC 3 tumors seeded with holoclones showed dramatic down regulation of FAM 65 B and dramatic up regulation of MFI 2 and LEF 1, and unexpectedly, a marked increase in tumor vascularity compared to parental PC 3 tumors, suggesting a role of cancer stem cells in tumor angiogenesis. Conclusions These findings support the proposal that PC 3 tumors are sustained by a small number of tumor-initiating cells with stem-like characteristics, including strong self-renewal and pro-angiogenic capability and marked by the expression pattern FAM 65 B high /MFI 2 low /LEF 1 low. These markers may serve as targets for therapies designed to eliminate cancer stem cell populations associated with aggressive, androgen-independent prostate tumors such as PC 3. </p...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Cell {{therapy is}} an {{emerging}} therapeutic strategy aimed at replacing or repairing severely damaged tissues with cultured cells. Epidermal regeneration obtained with autologous cultured keratinocytes (cultured autografts) can be life-saving for patients suffering from massive full-thickness burns. However, {{the widespread use}} of cultured autografts has been hampered by poor clinical results that have been consistently reported by different burn units, even when cells were applied on properly prepared wound beds. This might arise from the depletion of epidermal stem cells (holoclones) in culture. Depletion of holoclones can occur because of (i) incorrect culture conditions, (ii) environmental damage of the exposed basal layer of cultured grafts, or (iii) use of new substrates or culture technologies not pretested for <b>holoclone</b> preservation. The aim {{of this study was to}} show that, if new keratinocyte culture technologies and/or "delivery systems" are proposed, a careful evaluation of epidermal stem cell preservation is essential for the clinical performance of this life-saving technology. METHODS: Fibrin was chosen as a potential substrate for keratinocyte cultivation. Stem cells were monitored by clonal analysis using the culture system originally described by Rheinwald and Green as a reference. Massive full-thickness burns were treated with the composite allodermis/cultured autograft technique. RESULTS: We show that: (i) the relative percentage of holoclones, meroclones, and paraclones is maintained when keratinocytes are cultivated on fibrin, proving that fibrin does not induce clonal conversion and consequent loss of epidermal stem cells; (ii) the clonogenic ability, growth rate, and long-term proliferative potential are not affected by the new culture system; (iii) when fibrin-cultured autografts bearing stem cells are applied on massive full-thickness burns, the "take" of keratinocytes is high, reproducible, and permanent; and (iv) fibrin allows a significant reduction of the cost of cultured autografts and eliminates problems related to their handling and transportation. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that: (i) cultured autografts bearing stem cells can indeed rapidly and permanently cover a large body surface; and (ii) fibrin is a suitable substrate for keratinocyte cultivation and transplantation. These data lend strength to the concept that the success of cell therapy at a clinical level requires cultivation and transplantation of stem cells. We therefore suggest that the proposal of a culture system aimed at the replacement of any severely damaged self-renewing tissue should be preceded by a careful evaluation of its stem cell population...|$|E
40|$|Although some markers for the {{epidermal}} {{stem cell}} compartment have been proposed, {{their role in}} specifically identifying keratinocyte stem cells is still controversial. Therefore, the identification of surface epithelial stem cells relies on either the evaluation of their proliferative capacity or on the identification of slow cycling, [3 H]TdR- and BrdU-retaining cells, the latter being feasible only on laboratory animals. The proliferative capacity of human lining epithelial stem cells can be evaluated in vitro by means of clonal analysis. Indeed, three types of keratinocytes with different capacities for multiplication have been identified and isolated in human epidermis, hair follicle, limbal-corneal and conjunctival epithelia, i. e. <b>holoclones,</b> meroclones and paraclones. The authors have recently demonstrated that cultured autografts bearing <b>holoclones</b> can indeed rapidly and permanently cover a large body surface. Preparation of the wound bed and maintenance of epidermal stem cells in culture {{are found to be}} crucial to the clinical success of the technology. The implications and clincial results of permanent coverage of massive full-thickness burns, treatment of "stable" vitiligo with cultured epidermal autografts and permanent coverage of damaged ocular surfaces after complete loss of the corneal-limbal epithelium as well as ex vivo gene therapy of junctional epidermolysis bullosa are reported in this study and literature review. Basic "quality controls" of the culture system may eliminate one important hitherto uncontrolled variable in the evaluation of cultured autograft clinical performance and should represent a starting point for improving epithelial cultivation, in order to achieve satisfactory and reproducible clinical result...|$|R
40|$|In human corneal epithelium, {{self-renewal}} and fate {{decision of}} stem cells are highly regulated in a niche microenvironment called palisades of Vogt in the limbus. Herein, we discovered that digestion with dispase, which cleaves off the basement membrane, did not remove the entire basal epithelial progenitor cells. In contrast, digestion with collagenase isolated on cluster consisting of not only entire epithelial progenitor cells but also their closely associated mesenchymal cells because of better preservation of some basement membrane matrix. Collagenase isolated more basal epithelial progenitor cells, which were p 63 α+ and small in the size (8 [*]μm in diameter), and generated significantly more <b>holoclones</b> and meroclones on 3 T 3 fibroblast feeder layers than dispase. Further, collagenase isolated more small pan-cytokeratin−/p 63 α−/vimentin+ cells with the size as small as 5 [*]μm in diameter and heterogeneously expressing vimentin, Oct 4, Sox 2, Nanog, Rex 1, Nestin, N-cadherin, SSEA 4, and CD 34. Maintenance of close association between them led to clonal growth in a serum-free, low-calcium medium, whereas disruption of such association by trypsin/EDTA resulted in no clonal growth unless cocultured with 3 T 3 fibroblast feeder layers. Similarly, on epithelially denuded amniotic membrane, maintenance of such association led to consistent and robust epithelial outgrowth, which was also abolished by trypsin/EDTA. Epithelial outgrowth generated by collagenase-isolated clusters was significantly larger in diameter and its single cells yielded more <b>holoclones</b> on 3 T 3 fibroblast feeder layers than that from dispase-isolated sheets. This new isolation method {{can be used for}} exploring how limbal epithelial stem cells are regulated by their native niche cells...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{widespread}} agreement from patient and professional organisations alike that the safety of stem cell therapeutics is of paramount importance, particularly for ex vivo autologous gene therapy. Yet current technology {{makes it difficult to}} thoroughly evaluate the behaviour of genetically corrected stem cells before they are transplanted. To address this, we have developed a strategy that permits transplantation of a clonal population of genetically corrected autologous stem cells that meet stringent selection criteria and the principle of precaution. As a proof of concept, we have stably transduced epidermal stem cells (<b>holoclones)</b> obtained from a patient suffering from recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa. <b>Holoclones</b> were infected with self-inactivating retroviruses bearing a COL 7 A 1 cDNA and cloned before the progeny of individual stem cells were characterised using a number of criteria. Clonal analysis revealed a great deal of heterogeneity among transduced stem cells in their capacity to produce functional type VII collagen (COLVII). Selected transduced stem cells transplanted onto immunodeficient mice regenerated a non-blistering epidermis for months and produced a functional COLVII. Safety was assessed by determining the sites of proviral integration, rearrangements and hit genes and by whole-genome sequencing. The progeny of the selected stem cells also had a diploid karyotype, was not tumorigenic and did not disseminate after long-term transplantation onto immunodeficient mice. In conclusion, a clonal strategy is a powerful and efficient means of by-passing the heterogeneity of a transduced stem cell population. It guarantees a safe and homogenous medicinal product, fulfilling the principle of precaution and the requirements of regulatory affairs. Furthermore, a clonal strategy makes it possible to envision exciting gene-editing technologies like zinc finger nucleases, TALENs and homologous recombination for next-generation gene therapy...|$|R

Tumor hypoxia is common and can contribute to drug resistance. To take advantage of hypoxia, bioreductive drugs that are activated to cytotoxic metabolites in a hypoxic tumor environment have been developed. The cytotoxicity of one such drug, AQ 4 N, was assessed under normoxic and hypoxic conditions across a panel of tumor cell lines. AQ 4 N showed significantly increased cytotoxicity under hypoxia in rat 9 L gliosarcoma and H 460 human non-small cell lung carcinoma cell cultures, but not in cultures often other human cancer cell lines. Thus, the bioreductive activation of AQ 4 N is not widespread in cancer cell lines. Protein levels of the quinone reductase DT-diaphorase were poorly correlated with AQ 4 N chemosensitivity across the cell line panel, and AQ 4 N chemosensitivity was unaffected by DT-diaphorase inhibitors, indicating little contribution of DT-diaphorase to AQ 4 N cytotoxicity. The vasodilator hydralazine decreased tumor perfusion and increased tumor hypoxia in 9 L tumor xenografts, {{and to a lesser extent}} in H 460 xenografts, but did not increase AQ 4 N-dependent anti-tumor activity. Combining of AQ 4 N with the anti-angiogenic drug axitinib did not augment AQ 4 N anti-tumor activity beyond that of axitinib alone, despite the increased hypoxic environment. Thus, AQ 4 N activation in vivo requires tumor hypoxia that is more extensive or prolonged than can readily be achieved by vasodilation or anti-angiogenic drug treatment. Cancer stem-like cells have been proposed to be critical for tumor growth, initiation, and drug resistance. Stem-like cells from six human tumor cell lines were isolated at frequencies ranging from 12 - 69 % based on their characteristic <b>holoclone</b> morphology. All but one tumor cell line yielded holoclones with the capacity for self-renewal. Tumor xenografts grown from H 460 holoclones showed significant increases in microvessel density and tumor blood perfusion compared to parental H 460 tumors. Microarray analysis identified genes commonly dysregulated in holoclone-derived H 460 tumors, including a network of genes associated with angiogenesis. These and other genes may serve as therapeutic targets to eliminate cancer stem-like cells or inhibit angiogenesis in H 460 tumors. Together, these studies advance efforts to improve bioreductive drug activity through anti-angiogenesis and elucidate the role of stem-like cells in tumor angiogenesis...|$|E
40|$|Telomeres cap {{the end of}} {{eukaryotic}} chromosomes {{and prevent}} the natural end of a chromosome from being recognised as a double-stranded DNA break. Dysfunctional telomeres may trigger replicative senescence, or fuse with other telomeres or with non-telomeric DNA breaks. The length of a telomere {{plays a key role}} in telomere function. Relatively little is known about how telomeric chromatin influences telomere length and function. A number of studies in mammalian cells have identified a handful of chromatin remodelling proteins and the chromatin marks they deposit in telomere length regulation. However such examples at human telomeres are scarce. The primary aim of this thesis was to investigate whether the chromatin structure of a telomere is a determinant of its length in human cells. Two approaches were taken to address this issue: Firstly, the chromatin structure of telomeres of differing lengths were directly analysed by measuring enrichment of histone modifications known to be prominent at telomeres in other model organisms. Secondly, selected chromatin remodelling proteins were studied to determine whether they play a role in telomeric chromatin structure and telomere length. Single Telomere Length Analysis (STELA) provides a high resolution method to measure telomere length distributions at individual chromosome ends. STELA assays were previously designed for the 2 p, 9 p, 11 q, 12 q, 16 p, 17 p and 18 q telomeres. An allele‐specific STELA assay has also been designed for the XpYp chromosome end. In this study novel telomere and telomeric allele‐specific qPCR assays were developed for the same chromosome ends. These qPCR assays, when used in conjunction with ChIP provide a tool for analysing telomeric chromatin structure at individual chromosome ends. Applying this ChIP‐qPCR approach alongside STELA allows any correlations between telomeric chromatin structure and telomere length to be identified. This approach suggested differences in telomeric chromatin structure between telomeres of different lengths in telomerase‐positive HT 1080 fibrosarcoma cells. Shorter HT 1080 telomeres were less abundant in H 3 and TRF 1 and also had lower levels of H 4 K 20 me 3 and, to a lesser extent, H 3 K 4 me 3 compared to longer telomeres. Differences in chromatin structure were not observed between telomeres of different lengths in telomerase negative MRC 5 fibroblasts. Changes in chromatin structure were observed at individual telomeres/telomere alleles were observed between actively proliferating cells and in cells undergoing senescence. Telomeric enrichment of H 3 and TRF 1 as well as the histone methylation marks H 3 K 4 me 3, H 3 K 9 me 3 and H 4 K 20 me 3 were reduced in senescent cells. The degree of chromatin structural change as the cells entered senescence differed between chromosome ends. This highlights the benefits of using the telomere-specific ChIP-qPCR approach over the more traditional ChIP-dot blot assays which would not be able to differentiate between the chromatin structure of different chromosome ends. To identify roles for chromatin remodelling proteins in telomere length maintenance siRNA mediated knockdown of selected chromatin remodelers was performed in a clonal population of HT 1080 cells followed by STELA analysis. RNAi-depletion of the histone methyltransferase (HMTase) III EHMT 2 resulted in an increase in very short 17 p telomeres whereas loss of another HMTase, DOT 1 L caused a divergence in the 17 p telomere length distribution suggesting the presence of two subpopulations of cells each with differing telomere length distributions. Subtle changes in mean telomere length was observed after siRNA mediated knockdown of the HMTases MLL and EZH 2, the histone deacetylases (HDACs) HDAC 1 and SIRT 6, the ATP dependent chromatin remodelling complex subunit BAF 155 and the H 3. 3 histone chaperone DAXX. However due to certain limitations of the RNAi screen the validity of these observations is questionable and more work would have to be performed to confirm whether these chromatin remodelers have an effect on telomere length. Finally, dramatic telomere shortening was observed in a keratinocyte <b>holoclone</b> population after siRNA mediated knockdown of DAXX at number of chromosome ends. Prolonged depletion of DAXX also caused an increase in telomere‐to‐telomere fusions. A similarly dramatic loss in telomere length was seen in these cells after knockdown of EHMT 2...|$|E

In a hyperproliferative skin disease, psoriasis, increased mitotic {{activity of the}} stem cells is chiefly responsible for epidermal hyperplasia. The effects of 1, 25 dihydroxyvitamin D 3 (1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3) and potent vitamin D 3 analogues (MC 1288 : 20 -epi- 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3, MC 1301 : 20 -epi- 24 a-homo- 26, 27 -dimethyl- 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3, KH 1060 : 20 -epi- 22 -oxa- 24 a-homo- 26, 27 -dimethyl- 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3) on the stem cells were investigated. Stem cells were identified retrospectively as those giving rise to large keratinocyte colonies in culture (<b>holoclones).</b> 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 (10 − 8 – 10 − 6 [*]M) suppressed formation of <b>holoclones</b> by stimulating the progenitor cell differentiation into the phenotype expressing differentiation markers (keratins K 1 /K 10 and involucrin). 20 -Epi vitamin D 3 analogues were more potent than 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 in inhibiting the clonal keratinocyte growth. This activity correlated {{with the ability to}} induce cell differentiation (KH 1060 >MC 1301 >MC 1288 > 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3). Cytokines modulated the effects of 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 on clonal growth. One of the following cytokines (epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor α, interleukin- 1 α, interleukin- 1 β, interleukin- 6, interleukin- 8) was required for 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 to suppress clonal growth and induce cell differentiation. In contrast, keratinocyte growth factor and insulin-like growth factor I attenuated the effects of 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3. In conclusion, 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 and 20 -epi vitamin D 3 analogues suppress clonal growth by directly inducing the differentiation of progenitor cells. It is conceivable that stimulation of stem cells differentiation is a major mechanism of action of vitamin D 3 compounds in psoriasis.

The best results were obtained with 90 mg/mL scaffolds. At this concentration, the fibril organization presented some similarities to that found in corneal stroma.

40|$|It is {{becoming}} increasingly more common to use culture expanded human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) in regenerative medicine due to their low incidence in vivo. However, their successful application is hampered {{by a lack of}} selective markers to positively identify the expanded multipotent cells. This study aimed to characterise STRO- 1 antigen as a potential biomarker of multipotency on cultured bone marrow derived hMSCs. In an attempt to identify the nature of this antigen, two techniques were implemented: peptide phage display technology and a microarray based approach. Changes in the expression of STRO- 1 were investigated during culture expansion of hMSCs. STRO- 1 expression positively correlated with cellular morphology and multilineage potential, whereby senescent cells down-regulated STRO- 1 antigen and exhibited decreased adipogenic and osteogenic potential. Furthermore, STRO- 1 was found to be heterogeneously expressed on hMSC populations and enrichment followed by lineage specific induction of the STRO- 1 BRIGHT fraction resulted in enhanced adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation potential. The expression of STRO- 1 antigen was further characterised as a marker of differentiation, whereby differentiating cells were found to down-regulate STRO- 1. A cellular hierarchy in hMSC population was therefore proposed based on STRO- 1 status, with the highest STRO- 1 expressive cells representing the multipotent subset. In an attempt to identify the epitope that STRO- 1 IgM antibody recognised, peptide phage display technology was used as solid and liquid phase panning systems but the approach yielded no promising peptide candidate. Subsequently, comparative gene expression microarray analysis of osteosarcoma cell lines (143 B, CAL 72, G- 292, HOS, MG- 63, Saos- 2 and U- 2 -OS) was implemented and a list of eight potential candidate genes encoding STRO- 1 antigen was selected. This work ultimately led to the identification of putative cancer stem cells (CSCs) in seven osteosarcoma cell lines initially based on STRO- 1 expression. With MG- 63 strongly expressing STRO- 1, the maintenance of MSC-like properties by STRO- 1 expressing cell lines was investigated. A heterogeneous pattern of osteogenic differentiation was observed between and within the cell lines. Closer inspection revealed a cellular hierarchy comprising of <b>holoclones</b> and paraclones, with the <b>holoclones</b> representing the putative CSCs in osteosarcoma. Overall, this thesis addressed the fields of regenerative medicine as well as oncology by proposing STRO- 1 antigen as a marker of multipotency on hMSCs and osteosarcoma holoclonal cells as the putative cancer stem cell targets for anti-cancer drug development.
