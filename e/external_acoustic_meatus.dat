40|$|Surgical {{exposure}} of internal <b>acoustic</b> <b>meatus</b> via typical suboccipital retrosigmoid craniotomy {{is limited by}} inner ear structures that should remain intact if hearing preservation is attempted. Feasibility of supracerebellar-infratentorial approach to the meatus with more medial angle of exposure and with preservation of inner ear structures was studied on fresh cadavers and on computed tomography pictures of temporal bones. Anatomical relationships of internal <b>acoustic</b> <b>meatus</b> and adjacent structures show marked individual variability. When typical retrosigmoid craniotomy is used to expose meatal fundus, significant medial retraction of cerebellar hemisphere is required in 47 % of the patients to avoid opening endolymphatic spaces. Internal <b>acoustic</b> foramen and <b>meatus</b> can be exposed via craniotomy situated under transverse sinus, with 10 - 15 mm downward retraction of cerebellum. Medial extent of craniotomy can be planned on preoperative imaging studies. Infratentorial supracerebellar {{exposure of}} internal <b>acoustic</b> <b>meatus</b> allows for more medial angle of surgical approach than standard retrosigmold craniotomy. It can be used when preoperative imaging studies show that anatomical relationships between internal <b>acoustic</b> <b>meatus</b> and inner ear structures would require excessive cerebellar retraction to visualize a whole tumor inside meatus...|$|R

40|$|A new periotic of Numataphocoena yamashitai {{from the}} upper part of the Horokaoshirarika Formation (lower Pliocene), Numata, Hokkaido, Japan shows younger ontogenetic {{features}} in comparison to the matured holotype (NFL 7). The referred specimen of N. yamashitai is smaller (approximately 90 % in size) than the physically and sexually matured holotype periotic. The holotype (NFL 7) and referred specimen (NFL 2617) show several differences owing to ontogenetic changes, such as: the holotype (NFL 7) has a more strongly swollen medial part of the anterior process, blunt anterior keel, rounded anterodorsal angle, deeper and clearer anterior incisure, more rounded pars cochlearis, deeper and narrower hiatus epitympanicus rather than a flat area, longer posterior process with an extra edge posterolaterally. N. yamashitai differs from other fossil phocoenids in having a narrower and sharper anterior part of the internal <b>acoustic</b> <b>meatus</b> and a robust anterior process. Haborophocoena toyoshimai similarly has a relatively narrow internal <b>acoustic</b> <b>meatus</b> and a robust anterior process, compared with other fossil phocoenids. Between N. yamashitai and H. toyoshimai, N. yamashitai has a narrower internal <b>acoustic</b> <b>meatus</b> and a more robust anterior process. These similarities imply a close relationship between Numataphocoena and Haborophocoena. The new specimen provides diagnostic features and insight into ontogenetic variation of N. yamashitai...|$|R

Diffuse meningiomatosis was diagnosed and radiation therapy was given with symptom stabilization. Four years later, left hearing loss and right hypoacusia occurred, with slight transient improvement after high-dose dexamethasone. Serum immunoglobulin (Ig) G 4 was increased. CSF analysis showed increased protein, oligoclonal IgG, plasma cells, and lympho-cytes. Cerebral biopsy showed meningeal plasma-cell granuloma with IgG 4 -positive polyclonal plasma cells and B-lymphocyte infiltration (figure 2).

5000|$|Microtia — A {{congenital}} defect characterized {{by either the}} severe underdevelopment or {{the absence of the}} pinna (outer ear). At one end of the spectrum is a pinna slightly smaller than normal, but of normal appearance, and {{at the other end of}} the spectrum is anotia, the absence of the pinna. The Nagata classiﬁcation correlates the ear deformity with the surgical approach thus: (i) Lobule type — The patient has an ear remnant and malpositioned lobule, but no concha, <b>acoustic</b> <b>meatus,</b> or tragus. (ii) Concha type — The patients presents an ear remnant, malpositioned earlobe, concha (with or without <b>acoustic</b> <b>meatus),</b> tragus, and antitragus with an incisura intertragica. (iii) Small concha type — The patient presents an ear remnant, malpositioned lobule, and a small indentation instead of a concha. (iv) Anotia — The patient presents either no ear remnant, or a minute, ear remnant. (v) Atypical microtia — The patient presents deformities of the ear that are not comprehended in the four preceding Nagata classifications.|$|R

50|$|In addition, {{the facial}} nerve {{receives}} taste sensations from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue via the chorda tympani; taste sensation {{is sent to the}} gustatory portion (superior part) of the solitary nucleus. General sensation from the anterior two-thirds of tongue are supplied by afferent fibers of the third division of the fifth cranial nerve (V-3). These sensory (V-3) and taste (VII) fibers travel together as the lingual nerve briefly before the chorda tympani leaves the lingual nerve to enter the tympanic cavity (middle ear) via the petrotympanic fissure. It joins the rest of {{the facial nerve}} via the canaliculus for chorda tympani. The facial nerve then forms the geniculate ganglion, which contains the cell bodies of the taste fibers of chorda tympani and other taste and sensory pathways. From the geniculate ganglion, the taste fibers continue as the intermediate nerve which goes to the upper anterior quadrant of the fundus of the internal <b>acoustic</b> <b>meatus</b> along with the motor root of the facial nerve. The intermediate nerve reaches the posterior cranial fossa via the internal <b>acoustic</b> <b>meatus</b> before synapsing in the solitary nucleus.|$|R
