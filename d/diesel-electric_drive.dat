500|$|The {{other major}} problem Ralph Budd faced in {{developing}} a practical high speed lightweight train {{was to find a}} powerplant adequate to drive a trainset at a speed competitive with the faster steam trains. The existing powerplants for motorized railcars were completely inadequate. [...] Contemporary four-stroke Diesel motors had unacceptably low power-to-weight ratios and were only efficient under an unacceptably narrow range of operating conditions. [...] Spark-ignited petroleum distillate motors also suffered from low power-to-weight ratios along with being maintenance-intensive and smokey, and gasoline motors showed limited potential for higher power hauling applications. [...] The solution to Budd's problem presented itself in the new two-stroke Diesel motors developed by the partnership of the Winton Engine Company and General Motors, which represented a factor-of-four improvement in power-to-weight ratio over the previous generation of Diesel motors. [...] Their efficient operating range was also improved, owing largely to improvements in fuel injection developed by GM and Winton. [...] A Diesel-electric system driven by the new motor was used to power General Motors' automotive assembly exhibit at the 1933 Century of Progress Chicago World's Fair. [...] Budd saw the compact, efficient system in action, saw a major piece of his lightweight train puzzle fall into place, then approached GM about developing it into a system for rail propulsion. [...] The result was a <b>Diesel-electric</b> <b>drive</b> system powered by an eight-cylinder, 600hp Winton 201A Diesel motor installed in a new three car stainless steel streamliner within a year. [...] In 1933 a Century of Progress exhibit inspired the Zephyr streamliner; the following year the new Zephyr streamliner inspired the Century of Progress fair {{and the rest of the}} country.|$|E

40|$|Master of AgribusinessDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsJason BergtoldEfficiency and {{technology}} are increasingly important selling points for combine harvesters. <b>Diesel-electric</b> hybrid <b>drives</b> have taken {{hold in the}} construction equipment industry, and are providing marketable efficiency benefits for some heavy equipment customers. This thesis explores the technical and economic feasibility of utilizing <b>diesel-electric</b> hybrid <b>drives</b> on AGCO combine harvesters. To determine the technical feasibility of utilizing <b>diesel-electric</b> hybrid <b>drives</b> on AGCO combine harvesters, a search was conducted for prior literature relating {{to the use of}} electric drives on other heavy, off-highway equipment. This information, coupled with data provided by experts in the field, was used to determine if electric drives could fulfill the unique requirements of combine harvesters, and be practically utilized for this application. To determine the economic feasibility of utilizing <b>diesel-electric</b> hybrid <b>drives</b> on AGCO combine harvesters, an optimization model was constructed to seek out the most economically viable configuration of electric drives for this application. The model takes in to consideration the different use-cases in which this equipment is expected to perform, as well as the component costs and operating efficiencies of both the drives in place currently and the proposed electric drives. The outcome of the model was then utilized to compare the best-case configuration to the minimum requirement for economic feasibility. The technical feasibility assessment conducted for this thesis led to the conclusion that it would be technically feasible to utilize electric drives on a combine harvester. There are commercially available electric drive components which are suitable for use in the environment that this equipment is expected to operate in, and a prototype combine harvester having electric drives has previously been constructed. The economic feasibility assessment conducted for this thesis revealed that it is not economically feasible to utilize electric drives on AGCO combine harvesters at this time. Under the current circumstances, the most economically viable configuration would take nearly twice the machine’s usable operating life to provide a benefit to a customer from fuel savings. Sensitivity analysis revealed that significant changes in the price of fuel or electric drive components would be necessary to change the outcome of this study...|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, LeTourneau, a heavy-equipment maker based in Longview, Texas, {{developed}} {{the idea of}} using a <b>diesel-electric</b> transmission to <b>drive</b> multi-wheeled vehicles. Each wheel was driven by a separate electric motor, which gave the vehicles much better traction as the force of the engine was spread across a number of wheels. In general terms these vehicles were similar to the diesel-electric locomotives that were being widely introduced by the railways at the same time, but they replaced the steel wheels with rubber ones. The earliest vehicles using the system were a number of 6x6 graders, wheel tractor-scrapers and other earthmovers.|$|R

40|$|The {{collaborative}} {{very light}} rail project involves {{the development of}} a novel railcar designed to revolutionise the rail industry: a self-powered, Very Light Rail (VLR) vehicle. Each of the two bogies contains a complete <b>diesel-electric</b> series-hybrid <b>drive</b> system, whilst the whole vehicle has undergone significant lightweighting activity to realise a target weight of less than 18 tonnes, or 1 tonne per linear meter. The target cost is £ 500, 000, which is to be achieved through the use of standardised, modular components, and appropriate materials and structural design methodologies. The research covers several aspects of the GB Rail Technical Strategy (RTS) chapter relating to Rolling Stock. Lightweighting leads to a reduction in the propulsion requirements and reduces the infrastructure installation and maintenance costs. The use of higher efficiency drive systems achieved through on-board energy systems enables a reduction in carbon emissions. These hybridisation activities improve the passenger experience through quieter operation, decreased vibration and the possible elimination of exhaust emissions in stations. Combining new drive systems with modular lightweight structures will lead to lower life-cycle costs and thus could enable the economical reopening of lines...|$|R

50|$|As an {{alternative}} to steam turbine propulsion found in full size destroyers and larger warships, many US destroyer escorts of the World War II period had <b>diesel-electric</b> or turbo-electric <b>drive,</b> in which the engine rooms functioned as power stations supplying current to electric motors sited close to the propellers. Electric drive was selected {{because it does not}} need gearboxes (which were heavily in demand for the fast fleet destroyers) to adjust engine speed to the much lower optimum speed for the propellers. The current from the engine room can be used equally well for other purposes, and post-World War II many destroyer escorts were recycled as floating power stations for coastal cities in Latin America under programs funded by the World Bank.|$|R
