5|$|The Celtics {{franchise}} has retired Johnson's #3 jersey, which hangs <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rafters</b> of the TD Garden, {{the home}} arena of the team. On April 5, 2010, the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame officially announced that Johnson had been posthumously {{elected to the}} Hall. He was formally inducted on August 13. He is considered by several sports journalists {{to be one of}} the most underrated players of all time.|$|E

50|$|Wind Braces, in architecture, are {{diagonal}} braces to tie <b>the</b> <b>rafters</b> of a roof together and prevent racking. In the better sort of medieval roofs they are arched, and run <b>from</b> <b>the</b> principal <b>rafters</b> to catch <b>the</b> purlins.|$|R
5|$|Scully and Doggett {{arrive at}} the crime scene in Idaho and meet Detective Yale Abbott. He says they are less sure that the bites were made by a human and draws their {{attention}} to the strange footprint, believing that wild animals fed on the bodies after the fact. Scully points out {{that there is only one}} footprint, which looks ominously human, and that if it were left by an animal there would be more footprints leading to the bodies. Scully and Doggett check out the house and find prints leading upstairs and into the attic. Inside, Scully and Doggett find the missing fingers of the undertaker. They look like they have been regurgitated by something and the claw marks in the attic suggest something was hanging <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rafters.</b> Meanwhile, elderly Mrs. McKesson is killed in her attic while looking at a photo album.|$|E
5|$|The hobo's third tale {{tells the}} story of Tom Sawyer, whom Bart portrays, and Huckleberry Finn, whom Nelson portrays. Tom is a rebellious trouble maker while Huck is a bully. Huck is caught holding hands with Becky (Lisa) and is forced to marry her by her father (Homer). Huck dodges the {{marriage}} and goes on the run with Tom, leaving Missouri for Missoura. However, they are chased by townspeople led by Becky's father and their families. Huck and Tom flee to a river boat, but are thrown into the Mississippi River and are caught by the townspeople. At their funeral, Tom and Huck are first revealed to not be in their caskets, seemingly watching the proceedings <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rafters</b> which they have big smiles on their faces, until Reverend Lovejoy orders their bodies lowered into the caskets, revealing that Tom and Huck are in fact dead.|$|E

50|$|Lacking a tie beam, the arch-braced (arched brace) truss gives a {{more open}} look to the {{interior}} of the roof. <b>The</b> principal <b>rafters</b> are linked by a collar beam supported by a pair of arch braces, which stiffen the structure and help to transmit the weight of the roof down through <b>the</b> principal <b>rafters</b> to <b>the</b> supporting wall. A double arch braced truss has a second pair of arched braces lower down, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rafter</b> to a block or inner sill: This form is called a wagon, cradle, barrel or tunnel roof because of this cylindrical appearance.|$|R
50|$|After {{retiring}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> DSIR, <b>Rafter</b> {{spent two}} years {{as director of the}} United Nations Environment Programme Monitoring and Assessment Research Centre in London.

He {{is considered by}} many of his peers {{to be one of the}} greatest professional wrestlers of all time.|$|E
25|$|Michael Benthall's 1955 Old Vic production, {{starring}} Katharine Hepburn and Robert Helpmann. Benthall {{had failed}} to cast Helpmann as Katherina in 1948, but in 1955, he cast him as Petruchio in a production noted for excess; Katherina is literally hung upside-down <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rafters,</b> she beats Petruchio with a slipper, he spends much of the play leaping over furniture and brandishing his whip. After a successful run at the Old Vic, the play went on tour to Australia.|$|E
25|$|Also in 1981, Crawford {{starred in}} the {{original}} London production of Cy Coleman's Barnum (1981) as the illustrious American showman P.T. Barnum.

60|$|The {{whole of}} this sordid abode was dimly lighted by an evil-smelling oil-lamp, which hung <b>from</b> <b>the</b> rickety <b>rafters</b> of <b>the</b> ceiling. It all looked so horribly squalid, so dirty and uninviting, that Marguerite hardly dared {{to cross the}} threshold.|$|R
25|$|In 1871, actor McKee Rankin became {{witness to}} {{an act of}} vigilante justice during an {{extended}} engagement at the Piper. Rankin and fellow thespian William H. Powers were at the bar next to the troupe's International Hotel headquarters, when a customer named Perkins shot another customer and was jailed by the local sheriff. Two days later, on a Sunday morning, Rankin witnessed the lynching of Perkins {{at the hands of}} a vigilante mob who hung Perkins <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rafters</b> of the Piper stage. The mob also pulled out their guns and shot Perkins' dangling body.|$|E
25|$|NASCAR {{traditionally}} {{has a special}} version of the chequered flag sewn for Victory Lane that has the name and date of the race on it, a practice that Sunoco has spread to IndyCar since taking over its fuel sponsorship. That flag {{is used for the}} team in the winner's photographs taken after the race, and is a prize awarded to the team along with the race trophy. Teams often hang such flags at their headquarters in a similar fashion to other sports teams hanging championship banners <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rafters</b> at stadiums.|$|E
25|$|New Jersey native Bruce Springsteen {{remains one}} of the most popular concert acts; his {{appearances}} have included a six-night run to open the arena in July 1981, a 10-night sold-out run in 1984, an 11-night run in 1992 and a 15-night sold-out run in 1999. This last feat was commemorated by a large banner hanging <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rafters,</b> next to the banners representing the achievements of the resident sports teams. Additionally, a number of tracks from his 1986 live album Live/1975-85 were recorded at the arena during concerts in 1981 and 1984. In 2015, Springsteen's August 5, 1984, concert was officially released as a live album.|$|E
5000|$|The Spiders' mascot, Spinner, {{was widely}} known as [...] "the hardest working mascot in sports."

500|$|In {{the pilot}} episode of Dallas, Pam and Bobby elope in New Orleans and are married by a Justice of the Peace. [...] After Bobby brings Pam home to Southfork, she is met with great hostility <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Ewing family {{for being the}} {{daughter}} of their enemy, Digger Barnes. [...] Early on, Bobby's brother, J.R. Ewing, accuses Pamela of being a spy for her brother, Cliff Barnes, who is building a case against Ewing Oil, claiming that she passed a very important company file to Cliff. Bobby vigorously defends his wife and the family eventually find out that Pam is innocent. Shortly after the pilot episode, Pam becomes pregnant with Bobby's child. However, she argues with a drunk J.R. and falls <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rafter</b> of a barn, prompting her to miscarry the baby.|$|R
60|$|His {{left hand}} went {{suddenly}} to his throat. He almost tore away {{the collar and}} primly arranged tie. Rochester was by his side in a second, and saved him from falling.

25|$|After Starrcade, The Giant {{was removed}} from the New World Order (nWo) for failing to help Hogan win his match. The Giant was also unhappy with how he was never given a match for Hollywood Hogan's WCW World Heavyweight Championship despite winning the World War 3 battle royal. At Souled Out, The Giant faced Hogan for the title, but the match ended with nWo members beating down The Giant. Roddy Piper {{continued}} his feud with Hogan after, and they faced each other at SuperBrawl VII for the title. Randy Savage interfered, helping Hogan win the match, and their feud ended. Throughout 1997, WCW seemed to revolve around Sting, whose character was changed to become an avenger, frequently seen observing <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rafters.</b> The storyline was built towards his match with Hogan for the title at the following Starrcade.|$|E
500|$|In 1921, Wright {{purchased}} an old {{dairy barn}} at 2515 Etna Street in Berkeley, California, and hired architect Bernard Maybeck to remodel {{it into a}} home. Nicknamed [...] "the barn", Wright's home featured [...] "a soaring ceiling with room for a rope swing hung <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rafters</b> and space enough for two grand pianos. Maybeck's daughter-in-law Jacomena Maybeck [...] "remembered evenings at Cedric Wright's studio, when the women wore evening dresses and the men wore tuxedos, and there was much music around the big stone fireplace." ...|$|E
500|$|Perry has {{included}} the {{song on the}} setlist for her 2011 world concert tour entitled California Dreams Tour. For performances of the track, the stage was decorated with cartoonish link sausages and rib-eye steak that dangled <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rafters,</b> while Perry {{was dressed in a}} catsuit. Along with Perry's performances of [...] "Teenage Dream" [...] and [...] "E.T.", music blog Idolator staff writer Erika Brooks Adickman cited [...] "Circle the Drain" [...] as being a highlight of the tour.

5000|$|In Andrew Lloyd Webber's 1986 stage version, Buquet {{describes}} the Phantom's appearance to the ballet chorus and demonstrates {{the way to}} counter his [...] "magical lasso" [...] (the Punjab lasso, the Phantom's weapon for strangling victims).

6000|$|In {{a letter}} from London, Howells writes of the good times he is [...] having over there with Osgood, Hutton, John Hay, Aldrich, and Alma [...] Tadema, excursioning to Oxford, feasting, {{especially}} [...] "at the Mitre [...] Tavern, where they let you choose your dinner <b>from</b> <b>the</b> joints [...] hanging <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rafter,</b> and have passages that you lose yourself in [...] every time you {{try to go to}} your room.... Couldn't you and Mrs. [...] Clemens step over for a little while?... We have seen lots of [...] nice people and have been most pleasantly made of; but I would [...] rather have you smoke in my face, and talk for half a day just for [...] pleasure, than to go to the best house or club in London." [...] The [...] reader will gather that this could not be entirely soothing to a man [...] shackled by a contract and a book that refused to come to an end.|$|R
500|$|When Owen Hart was to {{challenge}} The Godfather for the WWF Intercontinental Champion's title, he was performing as the Blue Blazer. The character, originally used by Hart {{in the late}} 1980s, had recently been revived as a superhero gimmick that parodied various wrestlers. At Over the Edge, Hart was to emulate World Championship Wrestling (WCW) wrestler Sting's (Steve Borden) ring entrance by descending from the arena rafters into the ring. The entrance was successfully tested on the November 15, 1998, episode of Sunday Night Heat; however, during his descent at Over the Edge, a cable disengaged from the safety vest he wore, and he fell more than [...] <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rafters</b> into the ring. As he fell, he landed chest-first {{on one of the}} ring's padded turnbuckles. The accident was not seen by television viewers. A pre-recorded interview video was shown at the start of Hart's descent, and when the broadcast returned live, the cameras quickly turned away from the ring to the audience. Soon afterward, Jim Ross, one of the commentators of the event, informed pay-per-view viewers that Hart had fallen <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rafters,</b> that the incident was [...] "not a part of the entertainment" [...] and that it was [...] "a real situation". EMTs came down to the ring and gave Hart CPR, but he showed no response to the treatment. Bringing Hart out on a gurney, the EMTs boarded the heavily injured wrestler into an ambulance and took him to a nearby hospital in Kansas City.|$|E
500|$|At 8:00 A.M. {{that same}} day, the four banners were removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rafters.</b> [...] Four days later, the {{athletic}} department officially deleted all mention of Webber, Taylor, Traylor and Bullock from the school's athletic records. These included Traylor's MVP awards in the 1997 NIT and 1998 Big Ten Tournament, as well as Bullock's standing as the Big Ten's all-time leader in 3-point field goals and the school's third all-time leading scorer and all-time leader free throws made. The deletions came because the payments may have compromised their amateur status. Several players not implicated in the scandal continue to be listed among the school's honorees such as Rob Pelinka (Walter Byers Scholarship, 1993), Juwan Howard and Jalen Rose (All-American, 1994) and Jerod Ward (Big Ten All-Tournament Team, 1998).|$|E
500|$|... 1000 Forms of Fear is {{primarily}} an electropop album, with influences of hip hop and reggae. It opens with [...] "Chandelier", an electropop song {{that features a}} reggae-influenced beat. Lyrically, the track talks about [...] "the glitter and fatigue of a party girl's life." [...] The follow-up, [...] "Big Girls Cry", was compared to Alanis Morissette's [...] "Hands Clean". On [...] "Burn the Pages", Sia described a friend she wants to cheer up: [...] "You're twisted up like a slipknot / Tied by a juicehead who just took his T-shot." [...] "Eye of the Needle" [...] is a [...] "military-march" [...] piano ballad, while [...] "Hostage" [...] is a new wave pop and ska track that features Sia's voice [...] "cracking like a punk singer." [...] The sixth song, [...] "Straight for the Knife", is instrumented by strings and lyrically details a tempestuous relationship: [...] "But will someone find me swinging <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rafters</b> / I’m hanging on your every word." ...|$|E
50|$|Much of the {{furniture}} was either found or donated, filling the space with couches, mattresses, hammocks suspended <b>from</b> <b>the</b> steal <b>rafters,</b> and large mounds of fabric, supported by garbage bags stuffed with paper retrieved <b>from</b> <b>the</b> recycling plant located around the corner on Plymouth Street. Occasionally, art collectives left behind specially constructed furniture and decoration pieces (one notable item included a 20 ft. tall volcano).|$|R
50|$|In 1966 {{the heating}} system was {{completely}} {{replaced by a}} gas-fired boiler and radiators. Also in 1966 the old slates were removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> roof, and <b>rafters,</b> felting and new slates supplied: The work continued into 1967. The Vestry roof needed all new timbers and slates.|$|R
