40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether there is a difference in a caregiver s quality of life based upon the caregiver s age, gender, ethnicity and the number of hours spent caring. The study targeted parents, guardians, and caregivers at the Speech, Language, and Hearing Clinic at California State University, Fresno. A diverse population of participants between the ages of 26 and 85 provided usable data. Participants completed the Adult Carer Quality of Life (AC-QoL) Questionnaire, which was analyzed using the Chi-Squared <b>Fisher</b> <b>s</b> Exact Test. Significance was set at the 0. 05 level. Results from the <b>Fisher</b> <b>s</b> Exact Test failed to reject the null hypotheses, and no significant differences were found in caregiver quality of life based upon the variables age, gender, ethnicity, and the number of hours spent caring...|$|R
