5|$|American kestrels feed {{largely on}} small {{animals such as}} grasshoppers, dragonflies, lizards, mice, voles, and small birds. The kestrel has also been {{reported}} to have killed snakes, bats, and squirrels. The kestrel is able to maintain high population densities, {{at least in part}} because of the broad scope of its diet. The American kestrel's primary mode of hunting is by perching and waiting for prey to come near. The bird is characteristically seen along roadsides or fields perched on objects such as trees, overhead power lines, or fence posts. It also hunts by <b>kiting,</b> hovering in the air with rapid wing beats and scanning the ground for prey. Other hunting techniques include low flight over fields, or chasing insects and birds in the air.|$|E
5|$|Redback spiderlings cohabit on the {{maternal}} web {{for several days}} to a week, during which time sibling cannibalism is often observed. They then leave by being carried on the wind. They follow light and {{climb to the top}} of nearby logs or rocks before extending their abdomens high in the air and producing a droplet of silk. The liquid silk is drawn out into a long gossamer thread that, when long enough, carries the spider away. This behaviour is known as ballooning or <b>kiting.</b> Eventually, the silken thread will adhere to an object where the young spider will establish its own web. They sometimes work cooperatively, climbing, releasing silk and being carried off in clusters. Juvenile spiders build webs, sometimes with other spiders.|$|E
5|$|Robert Wesley Rackstraw is {{a retired}} pilot and ex-convict who served on an army {{helicopter}} crew and other units during the Vietnam War. He {{came to the attention}} of the Cooper task force in February 1978, after he was arrested in Iran and deported to the U.S. to face explosive possession and check <b>kiting</b> charges. Several months later, while released on bail, Rackstraw attempted to fake his own death by radioing a false mayday call and telling controllers that he was bailing out of a rented plane over Monterey Bay. Police later arrested him in Fullerton on an additional charge of forging federal pilot licenses; the plane he claimed to have ditched was found, repainted, in a nearby hangar. Cooper investigators noted his physical resemblance to Cooper composite sketches (although he was only 28 in 1971), military parachute training, and criminal record, but eliminated him as a suspect in 1979 after no direct evidence of his involvement could be found.|$|E

The choice of an appropriate <b>kit</b> for a specific application {{should be based on}} the specific performance requirements with regard to the respective sample material. In this study, the performance of nine <b>kits</b> was evaluated: EpiTect Fast FFPE Bisulfite <b>Kit,</b> EpiTect Bisulfite <b>Kit,</b> EpiTect Fast DNA Bisulfite <b>Kit</b> (Qiagen), EZ DNA Methylation-Gold <b>Kit,</b> EZ DNA Methylation-Direct <b>Kit,</b> EZ DNA Methylation-Lightning <b>Kit</b> (Zymo Research), innuCONVERT Bisulfite All-In-One <b>Kit,</b> innuCONVERT Bisulfite Basic <b>Kit,</b> innuCONVERT Bisulfite Body Fluids <b>Kit</b> (Analytik Jena). The <b>kit</b> performance was compared with regard to DNA yield, DNA degradation, DNA purity, conversion efficiency, stability and handling using qPCR, UV, clone sequencing, HPLC, and agarose gel electrophoresis. All <b>kits</b> yielded highly pure DNA suitable for PCR analyses without PCR inhibition. Significantly higher yields were obtained when using the EZ DNA Methylation-Gold <b>Kit</b> and the innuCONVERT Bisulfite <b>kits.</b> Conversion efficiency ranged from 98. 7 % (EpiTect Bisulfite <b>Kit)</b> to 99. 9 % (EZ DNA Methylation-Direct <b>Kit).</b> The inappropriate conversion of methylated cytosines to thymines varied between 0. 9 % (innuCONVERT Bisulfite <b>kits)</b> and 2. 7 % (EZ DNA Methylation-Direct <b>Kit).</b> Time-to-result ranged from 131 min (innuCONVERT <b>kits)</b> to 402 min (EpiTect Bisulfite <b>Kit).</b> Hands-on-time was between 66 min (EZ DNA Methylation-Lightning <b>Kit)</b> and 104 min (EpiTect Fast FFPE and Fast DNA Bisulfite <b>kits).</b> Highest yields from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections without prior extraction were obtained using the innuCONVERT Bisulfite All-In-One <b>Kit</b> while the EZ DNA Methylation-Direct <b>Kit</b> yielded DNA with only low PCR-amplifiability.

The Factory would eventually become the Royal Aircraft Establishment, and Vivian Cody {{would go on to}} a long and successful career as a technical specialist. In 1908, the War Office officially adopted Cody's kites for the Balloon Companies he had been training. This group would in due course evolve into the Air Battalion of the Royal Engineers, No. 1 Company of which later became No. 1 Squadron, Royal Flying Corps and eventually No. 1 Squadron Royal Air Force.|$|E

25|$|The Edge {{administration}} battled Hague {{on other}} fronts as well. Walter D. Van Riper, whom Edge had appointed state attorney general, {{took over the}} Hudson County prosecutor's office and brought in outside investigators. Van Riper aggressively prosecuted unlawful activities protected by the Hague organization. In June 1944, he led raids on Hudson County horse race betting rooms, later obtaining the indictments from newly constituted Hudson grand juries, the first indictments for such activities since Hague had come to power. In the process, gambling on horse racing in Hudson County was virtually eliminated. In early 1945 Hague retaliated by having his hand-picked United States Attorney bring two federal indictments against Van Riper, one charging check <b>kiting</b> and the other related to the alleged sale of gasoline in the black market. Van Riper went to trial on both indictments and was acquitted of all charges. Edge and Van Riper were undeterred and continued to apply pressure on Hague. Major state jobs, which Hague once had controlled, now went to Republicans. The state civil service system was reformed and freed from Hague's domination. The actions of the Edge administration took a heavy toll on Hague, who retired from active politics in 1947 during the administration of Edge's successor, Republican Alfred E. Driscoll.|$|E
500|$|Presley's ancestry was {{primarily}} a Western European mix that included German, Scots-Irish, Scottish, and some French Norman. Gladys would often tell the family that before the Civil War, her great-great-grandmother, Morning Dove White, was a 'full-blooded Cherokee Indian', although some genealogists doubt the claim. In her book Elvis and Gladys, Elaine Dundy claims that Presley's great-great-grandmother Nancy Burdine Tackett was Jewish, citing a third cousin of Presley's, Oscar Tackett. However, {{there is no evidence}} that the Presley family shared this belief and the syndicated columnist Nate Bloom has challenged the cousin's account, which he calls a [...] "tall tale". Gladys was regarded by relatives and friends as the dominant member of the small family. Vernon moved from one odd job to the next, evincing little ambition. The family often relied on help from neighbors and government food assistance. The Presleys survived the F5 tornado in the 1936 Tupelo–Gainesville tornado outbreak. In 1938, they lost their home after Vernon was found guilty of <b>kiting</b> a check written by the landowner, Orville S. Bean, the dairy farmer and cattle-and-hog broker for whom he then worked. He was jailed for eight months at Parchman Farm (Mississippi State Penitentiary). Gladys and Elvis moved in with relatives.|$|E

2500|$|On December 2, 2010, Picard sued JPMorgan Chase, seeking {{damages and}} {{restitution}} {{of at least}} $6.4 billion. [...] The suit was initially sealed due to confidentiality concerns on Chase's part, but both parties agreed to unseal it on February 3, 2011. [...] The suit alleges that Chase knew or {{should have known that}} Madoff's wealth management business was a fraud. [...] However, Chase didn't report its concerns to regulators or law enforcement until October 2008, when it told the UK Serious Organised Crime Agency that the performance of Madoff's investments was [...] "too good to be true." [...] The suit also claimed that Chase bankers were making profitable deals with Madoff even as risk management executives expressed concern about the nature of Madoff's business. [...] It also claimed that Chase officials knew that Friehling & Horowitz wasn't peer reviewed or registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (it subsequently emerged that the Friehling firm had stated in writing {{for more than a decade}} that it didn't conduct audits). [...] Almost as seriously, Picard charged that Chemical/Chase's retail bankers failed to perform even basic oversight of Madoff's banking activities, despite several transactions dating as far back as the 1990s that raised the appearance of money laundering or check <b>kiting.</b> [...] Picard argued that even a cursory glance at Madoff's account activity at Chase would have revealed his business could not possibly have been legitimate. [...] He also argued that even after Chase reported its concerns about Madoff's performance to UK officials, it didn't put any restrictions on Madoff's banking activities until his arrest two months later.|$|E

Now that South Africa, with the exception of Rhodesia, has been paralysed, and Australia has not yet learned the things which belong to her peace, Canada has the chance of the century to attract good men and capital into the Dominion. But the men are much more important than the money. They may not at first be as clever with the hoe as the Bessarabian or the Bokhariot, or whatever the fashionable breed is, but they have qualities of pluck, good humour, and a certain well-wearing virtue which are not altogether bad. They will not hold aloof from the life of the land, nor pray in unknown tongues to Byzantine saints; while the very tenacity and caution which made them cleave to England this long, help them to root deeply elsewhere. They are more likely to bring their women than other classes, and those women will make sacred and individual homes.

GISTs with mutations within exon 11 (n= 12) or 9 (n= 1) of <b>KIT</b> were compared with GISTs without <b>KIT</b> mutations in exons 9, 11, 13, and 17 (n= 10), two of them had PDGFRA mutations. <b>KIT</b> amplification was studied by real-time PCR of <b>KIT</b> and beta-ACTIN genes, and by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using <b>KIT</b> and chromosome 4 centromere specific probes. <b>KIT</b> transcripts and protein expression were quantified by reverse transcription real-time PCR and Western blot respectively. Genomic analysis revealed a single mutated GIST with <b>KIT</b> amplification. <b>KIT</b> protein and RNA levels were highly variable in GISTs but closely correlated (r= 0. 82, P< 1. 10 − 5), and were higher in GISTs with <b>KIT</b> mutations (P= 0. 07 and P= 0. 03 respectively). In conclusion, contrasting with the regulation of other {{tyrosine kinase}} receptors, <b>KIT</b> overexpression in GISTs is rarely related to a gene amplification, which suggests a deregulation of <b>KIT</b> gene transcription...|$|R
