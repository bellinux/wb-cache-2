40|$|This paper {{studies the}} e¤ects of overcon 8 ̆ 5 dence in an investment-decision setting. A risk-averse agent privately observes {{information}} relevant to an investment decision, {{that he can}} report to a principal. In a standard common-priors setting, the optimal contract provides full insurance to the agent: the principal pays a 8 ̆ 5 xed wage to the agent, asks him to reveal his information, and implements the e ¢ cient <b>investment</b> <b>rule.</b> When the agent overestimates the expected revenue of the project following investment, however, {{he is willing to}} wager on success against the (relatively pessimistic) principal, and hence bear some project risk in equilibrium. In addition, because what the principal considers to be the optimal <b>investment</b> <b>rule</b> is too conservative according to the agents beliefs and the agent holds some stake in the choice of <b>investment</b> <b>rule,</b> he will accept a lower 8 ̆ 5 xed payment in exchange for a more liberal <b>investment</b> <b>rule.</b> This can be interpreted as giving more control to the agent. It is somewhat counterintuitive that, the principal will surrender more control to an agent with whom she disagrees more sharply...|$|R
40|$|We re-examine {{the basic}} {{investment}} problem of deciding when to incur a sunk cost {{to obtain a}} stochastically fluctuating benefit. The optimal <b>investment</b> <b>rule</b> satisfies a trade-off between a larger versus a later net benefit; we show that this trade-off is closely analogous to the standard trade-off for the pricing decision of a firm that faces a downward sloping demand curve. We reinterpret the optimal <b>investment</b> <b>rule</b> as a markup formula involving an elasticity that has exactly the same form as the formula for a firm's optimal markup of price over marginal cost. This is illustrated with several examples. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{develop a}} simple two-country model of {{international}} trade in which the transportation cost between countries is endogenously determined by pricing and investment decisions of cross-border transport infrastructure.

We also {{examine the effect of}} integrating operation. It is shown that <b>investment</b> <b>rule</b> in free access regime is inefficient.

40|$|In the {{literature}} investigating {{the impact of}} uncertainty on short-run and long-run investment, most authors have used a log linear profit function. This functional form has been generally considered a reasonable approximation for a more general one and {{has the advantage of}} providing closed form solutions for both short-run <b>investment</b> <b>rule</b> and long-run rate of capital accumulation. In this paper, we consider the profit function for the case of a monopolistic firm facing a linear demand function with additive shocks. Under this assumption, analytical solutions, for both short-run <b>investment</b> <b>rule</b> and long-run rate of capital accumulation, are not available. We then 1) propose an analytical approximation of the short-run <b>investment</b> <b>rule</b> and 2) show how such approximation can be used in order to derive the corresponding i) steady-state distribution of the optimal stock of capital and ii) the long-run average rate of capital accumulation. Finally, we compare the long-run rates of capital accumulation calculated under both profit function specifications. We find that, within a plausible range of parameter values, the two rates are significantly different. Hence, we conclude that the choice of a log linear functional form has a non-trivial impact on the magnitude of the long run rate of capital accumulatio...|$|R

50|$|All {{the main}} {{political}} parties in Britain agree that the national debt is too high, but there is disagreement as to the remedy.

50|$|Another {{possible}} {{financing method}} is the issuing of bonds. Investors can {{take out a}} bond with a reduced interest rate {{and in this way}} make an indirect donation to PSPP projects. Compared with typical bond schemes, whose interest levels are coupled to the credit rating of the company, and have minimum volume limits of approximately € 50 million (or € 5 million {{in the case of the}} new mid cap bonds), social bonds, with the waiver of a part of the interest by the investors, have definite advantages for social enterprises. A successful example is the “ELAG SOCIAL bond“ (ELAG=Elisabeth Liegenschafts-Entwicklungs-Aktiengesellschaft, Elisabeth Real Estate Development Stock Corporation). This stock company formed by the Caritas of the diocese of Linz and the KOOP Lebensraum Beteiligungs-AG has used the bond issue to ensure compliance with its <b>investment</b> <b>rules,</b> which specify low-risk investment, charitable-social purpose and investment in properties that should yield dividends not less than the rate of inflation.|$|E

5000|$|Ann Wagner has {{consistently}} opposed financial regulations, including retirement <b>investment</b> <b>rules</b> that require brokers {{to put their}} clients’ best interests before their own profits. Wagner {{has worked with the}} Trump Administration to target financial oversight rules. On February 3, 2017, Congresswoman Wagner appeared in the Oval Office with President Donald Trump during the signing of executive orders to examine a repeal of the popular Dodd-Frank financial regulatory package, as well as to delay the Department of Labor's proposed fiduciary standard, which requires that financial advisors act in their clients' best interests and disclose all fees. Wagner, who has been a vocal and consistent opponent of the fiduciary rule, was invited by President Trump to explain the rule to the White House press pool. She said to the assembled reporters, [...] "What we’re doing, is we are returning to the American people, low and middle income investors and retirees their own control over their own retirement savings." [...] President Trump then congratulated her, calling her a [...] "very special person." [...] Critics argue that this change allows brokers to conceal kickbacks and conflicts of interest from investors.|$|E

40|$|The {{learning}} of optimal discrete <b>investment</b> <b>rules</b> is analysed {{and related to}} the problem of forecasting financial returns. The aim is twofold: to characterize some 'good' learning methods for agents using <b>investment</b> <b>rules</b> of this form and to explain why many observed <b>investment</b> <b>rules</b> such as technical trading rules are discrete. A consistent estimator for discrete <b>investment</b> <b>rules</b> is used and it is shown, using simulations, that direct estimation of <b>investment</b> <b>rules</b> is preferable to the estimation of forecasting models to be used in such rules. This model and the associated results indicate {{there are a number of}} reasons why it may be easier to learn a good discrete investment rule than to learn a continuous rule; this provides a partial explanation of why discrete <b>investment</b> <b>rules</b> are used so widely. ...|$|E

Integrating taxes into real option theory, {{it can be}} shown that the possible approaches dynamic programming and contingent claims analysis yield identical <b>investment</b> <b>rules</b> under risk neutrality.

Prior research suggests that underlying the advertising cost–quality rule is a basic human attribution (the effort <b>investment</b> <b>rule)</b> that says, if someone invests a lot of effort in a cause, it implies a true belief in that cause.
