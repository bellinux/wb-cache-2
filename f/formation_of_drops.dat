30|$|Holdup minima can be {{justified}} by evaluation of operating regimes in the column, which here corresponds the transition from mixer-settler regime to dispersion regime. Mixer-settler regime {{is characterized by the}} separation of dispersed and continuous phases into individual distinct layers in the inter-plate spaces during the quiescent portion of the pulse cycle. This condition enhances the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> larger <b>drops</b> which stay on the internals and leads to the increase of holdup. When pulsation introduces into the column, residence time declines due to higher shear forces and drop breakage and as a consequence, the holdup decreases initially.

The effects of parameters such as Reynolds number, impact velocity, drop size ratio, and internal circulation are investigated, and different regimes for droplets collisions are simulated. In some cases, those calculations yield results corresponding to the four regimes of binary collisions: bouncing, coalescence, reflexive separation, and stretching separation.

While the desired drop sizes differ widely among these applications, the unifying goal is to produce drops having a narrow (mono-disperse) distribution of sizes centered about the targeted size. However, wide (poly-disperse) drop size distributions frequently appear as a consequence <b>of</b> the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> undesired smaller satellite <b>drops.</b> The <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> satellite <b>drops</b> {{has a number of}} disadvantages that are directly related to product quality and stability, and is among the most common causes of inefficiency and environmental pollution in commercial applications involving jet break up. Since surface tension is the driving force causing the jet instability, surfactants {{play a critical role in}} the break up processes and are routinely added to facilitate processing (e. g. avoid drop coalescence, reduce energy consumption), or are ubiquitous as contaminants. Although the break up of surfactant-free jets has been extensively studied, for reasons directly related to theoretical and experimental complexity, little is known about the effect of surfactants on the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> satellite <b>drops.</b> In this work, developments in the field of interfacial fluid dynamics were used to characterize the physical mechanisms that govern the capillary deformation and break-up of liquid jets in the presence of surfactants, with special focus on characterizing the mechanisms leading to <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> satellite <b>drops.</b> Results from these studies showed, for the first time, that the ability of surfactants to develop tangential stresses (Marangoni stresses) on interfaces provides a mechanism that favors the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> satellite droplets.

40|$|Abstract. Vapor-to-liquid {{phase change}} {{in the form of}} {{discrete}} drops on or under-neath a substrate is called dropwise condensation. The process is hierarchical {{in the sense that it}} occurs over a wide range of length and timescales. As the associated heat transfer coefficient is much higher than the film and mixed mode of conden-sation, it is of considerable interest in applications. The present study is focused on mathematical modelling of dropwise condensation process at multiple scales. The model includes <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>drops</b> at the atomistic scale, droplet growth, coalescence, instability, slide off and fall-off, followed by fresh nucleation of liquid droplets. The model shows that the largest stable cluster size in the atomic model matches the mini-mum drop radius estimated from thermodynamic considerations. The minimum drop radius is insensitive to surface texturing and does not provide controllability at larger length and timescales. A closer examination of droplet distribution over the substrate reveals that small drops are locations of high heat transfer rates, which diminishes with increasing drop radius. The largest drop diameter depends on its stability and hence, the interfacial forces at phase boundaries. Therefore, drop instability control...|$|E

A Lagrangian–Eularian model of the cloud-topped boundary layer is used to simulate the cloud measured during flight RF 07 of the DYCOMS-II field experiment. The model contains ~ 2000 air parcels that are advected in a turbulence-like velocity field. In the model all microphysical processes are described for each Lagrangian air volume, and turbulent mixing between the parcels is also taken into account.
