50|$|Eutrigla gurnardus, the <b>grey</b> <b>gurnard,</b> is {{a species}} of searobin native to the eastern Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea. This fish {{can be found at}} depths of from 10 to 340 m though it is not {{normally}} found below 150 m. This species grows to a length of 60 cm TL though usually reaching up to 30 cm TL. This species is the only known member of its genus.|$|E
5000|$|Marine life {{includes}} the basking shark {{which have been}} known to enter the harbour. In 1972 a particularly large example was seen at the end of Polruan Quay; it was longer than the width of the quay. Other fish that may be found in local waters including the estuary include: bass, wrasse (4 varieties), seahorse, pipe fish, pollack, coalfish, flounder, plaice, conger eel, European eel, dragonet, red gurnard, <b>grey</b> <b>gurnard,</b> blenny (shanney), bullhead, burbot, butterfish, sand-eel, salmon, sea trout, garfish, mackerel, angler fish (incorrectly named in restaurants [...] "monk fish"), dab, whitebait, scad (horse mackerel), shad, herring, turbot, pouting, poor cod and rockling.|$|E
5000|$|As other sea robins, <b>grey</b> <b>gurnards</b> produce sounds. Sound {{production}} in this species is {{often associated with}} competition for food. Small individuals produce more sounds than larger ones, and emit more [...] "grunts" [...] than [...] "knocks", probably because they more often compete for food by contest tactics whereas larger specimens predominantly scramble for food.|$|R
40|$|<b>Grey</b> <b>gurnards</b> (Eutrigla gurnardus) {{belong to}} the family of triglids. They are demersal, widely {{distributed}} fishes in the North Sea, ranked among the most dominant species. Triglids are known to produce sounds by drumming sonic muscles against their swimbladder. Analyses concerning differences between acoustical activity of groups and single fish were made by event-based recording of audio and video. Experiments were conducted in a two by two meter tank with a water level of 46 centimeters. Acoustical behavior of three different conditions was analyzed for periods of 48 hours. Compared were groups of five fish with single fish and with a group of four dummies and a single fish. Additional focus lay on determination of acoustic composition and a possible influence of the experimental tank. Recordings and analyses were conducted computer-based with software particularly configured for research on acoustical behavior of fish. Corrections and changes concerning experimental set-up recommended by previous work were considered. Improvement of tank acoustics could be found. In 108 days of recording a total of 4957 fish sounds were found that split up into five different categories: Knock, Grunt, Growl, Knock-train and a new category: Croak. Croaks were not described in any literature before. They seem to be very rare, since a total of only 20 sounds were found. All categories were described in detail. Results showed a high variance in acoustical activity in all experimental parts and an influence of water temperature and length of light period on sound generation. A significant difference was found between groups and single individuals concerning acoustical activity and -composition. The effect of dummies as replacement of group members was not explicit because of high variances in sound production. Received data showed a high potential for further investigation. Possible improvements were recommended. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{acoustic}} {{repertoire of}} captive <b>grey</b> <b>gurnard</b> Eutrigla gurnardus during competitive feeding {{consisted of three}} types of sound: knocks, grunts and growls. Knocks were audible as a single sound, whereas grunts and growls were perceived as longer, pulsed sounds to the human ear. Typically, knocks were composed of 1 – 2 pulses, grunts of 4 – 8 pulses and growls > 10 pulses. Growls were longer and had shorter pulse periods than grunts. All sound types had peak frequencies of c. 500 Hz. The sequences of behaviours observed during feeding interactions suggest that <b>grey</b> <b>gurnard</b> obtain food both by scramble and contest tactics. Competing fish emitted knocks mainly while grasping a food item and also during other non-agonistic behaviour, suggesting that knock production may reflect a state of feeding arousal but could {{also serve as a}} warning of the forager’s presence to nearby competitors. Grunts were mainly emitted during frontal displays, which were the most frequent behavioural act preceding grasps, suggesting that they {{may play a role in}} deterring other fish from gaining access to disputed food items...|$|E

40|$|During cruises with Danish {{research}} vessels {{more than}} 17, 000 wild marine fish belonging to 41 different species were sampled and examined virologically. Birnavirus serogroup B was isolated from 7 marine fish species: plaice (Pleuronectes platessa), dab (Limanda limanda), flounder (Platichthys flesus), smear dab (Microstomus kitt), {{long rough dab}} (Hippoglossoides platessoides), cod (Gadus morhua) and <b>grey</b> <b>gurnard</b> (Eutrigla gurnardus) with 43 of the 45 isolations coming from flatfish. Birnavirus serogroup B seems to be endemic in the North Sea close to Denmark and in the Skagerrak and the Kattegat. Surveillance of aquacultured fish, mainly rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), for VHS, IHN and IPN, in Denmark during the previous 30 years, have resulted in Birnavirus serogroup B isolations twice. These isolations were from healthy rainbow trout. Samples sent to the Danish Veterinary Laboratory for virological examination and charac-terisation have revealed the presence of Birnavirus serogroup B in haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), plaice and dab from wild marine fish caught by Irish fishermen and from Icelandic farmed halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{most obvious}} effect of fishing on non-target species is direct mortality. To {{quantify}} this {{effect on the}} vulnerability of species requires measurement of the current fishing mortality rate and of the tolerance of the species to fishing mortality. These are difficult to estimate for the little-studied non-target species. We describe two potential methods for estimating current fishing mortality rate when data are limited. Their application is illustrated for dab (Limanda limanda) and <b>grey</b> <b>gurnard</b> (Eutrigula gurnardus), two common non-target species in the North Sea. We also develop approaches to define tolerance levels for fishing mortality for little-studied and rare species, based on the potential jeopardy level: the fishing mortality that causes a reduction in spawning stock biomass per recruit relative to the unexploited situation. We propose that for non-target species, models founded on basic knowledge of life history parameters, and on generally established relationships between these parameters, may offer the only practical approach...|$|E
40|$|In 2009, a self-sampling {{programme}} {{was organized}} in the Netherlands, fishers sampling ca. 80 kg of discards from randomly selected bottom trawls in the North Sea. A statistical procedure is proposed to highlight samples, trips (with multiple samples), or vessels (which may have multiple trips within a year) where extreme mean lengths of discarded fish were observed. Randomization methods were used to test for evidence of non-randomness in patterns of highlighted discard samples, e. g. repeated observations of extreme mean lengths for consecutive discard samples across trips from the same vessel. European plaice (Pleuronectes platessa), common dab (Limanda limanda), <b>grey</b> <b>gurnard</b> (Eutrigla gurnardus), and whiting (Merlangius merlangus) were considered because these were the most abundant species {{in most of the}} discard samples. A linear mixed model was used to estimate randomsample effects on the estimated mean lengths by species. These random effects were incorporated into uni- and bivariate procedures to identify extreme samples that were summed for each vessel, and the probability of observing such numbers was estimated. Excluding these samples from the dataset had marginal effects on estimated size distributions of fish...|$|E
40|$|High {{trophic level}} {{consumers}} such as demersal fish influence the trophic structure of marine benthic communities. Owing to their high mobility, consumers could act as integrators by connecting food webs. But do fish {{species in the}} North Sea link food webs of benthic communities or do they feed habitat dependent on a local scale? We examined the diet of the dominant benthic fish species (dab, plaice, whiting and <b>grey</b> <b>gurnard)</b> at the North Frisian sublitoral in the German Bight. The study area comprises various habitats with their typical benthic associations. Sediments from fine to coarse sands, gravel and even rocky habitats are present. The diet of fish from two different habitats (fine and coarse sands) was compared by two methods: (a) stomach content analyses to identify distinct prey items {{as a kind of}} snapshot and (b) stable isotopes (&# 948; 15 N) to investigate long-term differences of habitat-dependent diet, i. e. differences in trophic positions. Both methods enable us to estimate inter-specific differences in feeding, i. e. to determine trophic niches of species and to compare intra-specific differences of habitat-dependent diet. Knowledge on trophic interactions of fish based on habitat dependency might therefore provide a key to determine habitats essential for fish feeding, useful for the development of ecological management and strategies for conservation...|$|E
40|$|The ICES Working Group on Assessment of New MoU Species met at ICES Head-quarters in Copenhagen, Denmark, during 18 – 22 March 2012. There were 9 partici-pants from 7 countries.

40|$|Lesser {{sandeels}} Ammodytes marinus are {{eaten by}} {{a range of}} predatory fishes including commercially fished species, but are also exploited at large scale by industrial fisheries. Is availability of sandeels, as key prey source, linked to the body condition of predatory fishes? In the North Sea, the largest sandeel biomass is concentrated in the Dogger Bank region. Here we studied predator-sandeel interactions at two sites differing widely in sandeel abundance and local sandeel fishing effort. Surveys took place in 2004, 2005, and 2006, years when local sandeel densities observed at these sites were low, intermediate, and high, respectively. Five predator species [...] whiting, lesser weever, <b>grey</b> <b>gurnard,</b> plaice, and haddock [...] showed better body condition indices in either the years or study area (or both) characterised by higher local sandeel densities, when compared to sandeel-poorer conditions. Moreover, whiting, weever, and gurnard condition was better for those individuals actually observed to have eaten sandeels (based on stomach contents) than for those that had not. As body condition relates to growth, reproduction, and survival, predators in sandeel-rich conditions may be inferred {{to have a higher}} fitness. These links between sandeel availability, sandeel consumption, and predator condition hint that, if large-scale localised depletions of sandeels were to occur, negative indirect effects on predatory fish might become apparent, underlining the importance of considering the sandeel fishery in an ecosystem context. © 2012 Crown Copyright...|$|E
40|$|Groundfish {{survey data}} from the German Bight from 1902 - 08, 1919 - 23, and 1930 - 1932 and ICES International Bottom Trawl Survey (IBTS) quarter 3 data from 1991 to 2009 were {{analysed}} with respect to species frequencies, maximum length, trends in catch-per-unit-effort, species richness parameters (SNR) and presence of large fish (Phi 40), the latter defined as average presence of species per haul with specimens larger than 40 cm given. Four different periods are distinguished: (a) before 1914 with medium commercial CPUE and low landings, Phi 40 approx. 2, high abundance in elasmobranchs and SNR conditions indicating highly diverse assemblages, (b) conditions immediately after 1918 with higher commercial CPUE, recovering landings, Phi 40 at > 4 in 1919, and SNR conditions indicating highly diverse assemblages, (c) conditions from 1920 to the early 1930 's with decreasing commercial CPUE, increased landings, decreasing Phi 40, SNR conditions similar to later years indicating less diverse assemblages, {{and a decrease in}} elasmobranchs. In the IBTS series (d), Phi 40 remains low indicating an increased rarity of large specimens, and SNR characteristics are similar to the third period. Dab, whiting and <b>grey</b> <b>gurnard</b> have increased considerably in the IBTS series as compared to the historic data.

40|$|In the European Union, the {{collection}} of discard data is enforced through the Data Collection Regulation or Framework (DCR/DCF) of the European Commission (EC). To comply with this ruling, approximately ten trips of discard-intensive beam-trawlers are being monitored annually since 1999 (Helmond and Overzee, 2010). In 2009, revisions to the DCF (2008 / 949 /EG), required member states to increase sampling intensity to i) improve the precision of their estimates and ii) the number of sampled métiers. To meet this requirement within an affordable budget, the Institute for Marine Resources and Ecosystem Studies (IMARES, part of Wageningen University and Research) set up a collaborative project between the Dutch fishing industry and the research institute to recruit a ‘reference fleet’ of vessel owners {{willing to participate in}} a self-sampling programme. This programme complemented the existing observer programme. In the observer programme, vessels were selected quarterly from a pool of available vessels, whereas in the self-sampling programme, trips were pre-determined from a reference fleet of participating vessels. Missing and/or wrong information precluded the inclusion of 17 % and 13 % of all self-sampled trips in 2009 and 2010. In total, 9 and 10 observer, and 63 and 132 valid self-sampling trips were completed in 2009 and 2010, respectively. For these remaining valid self-sampled trips, procedures were developed to test whether data quality was comparable with i) other self samples from the reference fleet and ii) comparable observercollected data (i. e. temporally and spatially overlapping trips). In addressing i), there were no unusual patterns in the length frequencies of self-sampled discards of European plaice (Pleuronectes platessa), common dab (Limanda limanda), <b>grey</b> <b>gurnard</b> (Eutrigla gurnardus), and whiting (Merlangius merlangus) in 2009 and 2010. In addressing ii), no significant differences in the discard rates of plaice between the two programmes were found. There was no evidence that sampling may have been biased at the vessel level, justifying the decision to present all discard estimates independent of the programme type. While in both programmes the majority of observations were done onboard beam-trawl vessels with mesh sizes ranging between 70 and 99 mm, in the self-sampling programme data from four additional beam- and otter-trawl métiers with two 70 - 99 and 100 - 119 mesh size ranges and other target species assemblages (i. e mixed crustaceans and/or demersal fish) were collected. This lead, apart from a considerable increase in sampling effort for some métiers, to an increase in the temporal and spatial spread of sampling. Samples from previously unsampled northern and eastern parts of the North Sea were available. The spatial distribution of sampling locations matched that of the total effort of the fleet for intensively-sampled métiers. In all but two métiers, combined fish and benthos discards exceeded the volume of landings. In contrast, large-mesh beam- and otter trawls (100 - 119 mm) landed on average more than they discarded. The majority of discards was comprised by benthic (invertebrate) species such as common starfish (Asteria rubens); sand star (Astropecten irregularis); swimming crab (Liocarcinus holsatus); and serpent star (Ophiura ophiura). Most frequently discarded fish species of no commercial value included: dragonet (Callionymus lyra); <b>grey</b> <b>gurnard</b> (Eutrigla gurnardus); scaldfish (Arnoglossus laterna); and solenette (Buglossidium luteum).

40|$|Catches of {{demersal}} fish from research vessel surveys in three {{areas around the}} British Isles from 1901 to 1907 were compared with survey catches in the same areas from 1989 to 1997. Mesh size and other characteristics of the trawls used suggested {{that some of these}} data were comparable, and could be used to describe changes in {{demersal fish}} assemblages over the last 80 years. In Start Bay (NW English Channel) and the Irish Sea, species diversity was the same in both periods, although the most abundant species in each period were not the same. In English coastal regions of the southern North Sea, fish populations became more diverse, as plaice Pleuronectes platessa and whiting Merlangius merlangus became less abundant, and the relative abundance of several non-target species such as dragonet Callionymus spp., bib Trisopterus luscus, and bull-rout Myoxocephalus scorpius increased. The proportion in the catch of small fish species (maximum body length 30 cm) in catches decreased in all regions during the time period, except in the Irish Sea where plaice replaced <b>grey</b> <b>gurnard</b> Eutrigla gurnardus as a dominant species. There was a decline in abundance of large sharks, skates and rays, including the common skate, Raja batis, white skate R. alba and the angel shark Squatina squatina. During historic surveys, 60 % of the elasmobranch fauna consisted of thornback ray Raja clavata, whereas in contemporary surveys the lesser spotted dogfish Scyliorhinus canicula was the most abundant elasmobranch. Changes in length-frequency distribution of fish in both target and non-target categories, and other observed changes, were thought to be a response to commercial exploitation, and corresponded to similar observations recorded elsewhere.

40|$|Although sound {{production}} in teleost fish is {{often associated with}} territorial behaviour, little is known of fish acoustic behaviour in other agonistic contexts such as competitive feeding and how it changes during ontogeny. The <b>grey</b> <b>gurnard,</b> Eutrigla gurnardus, frequently emits knock and grunt sounds during competitive feeding and seems to adopt both contest and scramble tactics under defensible resource conditions. Here we examine, for the first time, the effect of fish size on sound production and agonistic behaviour during competitive feeding. We have made sound (alone) and video (synchronized image and sound) recordings of grey gurnards during competitive feeding interactions. Experimental fish ranged from small juveniles to large adults and were grouped in four size classes: 10 – 15, 15 – 20, 25 – 30 and 30 – 40 cm in total length. We show that, in this species, both sound production and feeding behaviour change with fish size. Sound production rate decreased in larger fish. Sound duration, pulse duration and the number of pulses increased whereas the peak frequency decreased with fish size, in both sound types (knocks and grunts). Interaction rate and the frequency of agonistic behaviour decreased with increasing fish size during competitive feeding sessions. The proportion of feeding interactions accompanied by sound production was similar in all size classes. However, the proportion of interactions accompanied by knocks (less aggressive sounds) and by grunts (more aggressive) increased and decreased with fish size, respectively. Taken together, these results suggest that smaller grey gurnards compete for food by contest tactics whereas larger specimens predominantly scramble for food, probably because body size gives an advantage in locating, capturing and handling prey. We further suggest that sounds emitted during feeding may potentially give information on the motivation and ability of the individual to compete for food resources...|$|E

In the self-sampling programme, trips were pre-determined from a reference fleet of participating vessels. In total, 155 trips were sampled in 2011, of which 27 trips (17 %) were considered invalid due to missing or incomplete information. During the 128 valid self-sampling trips 248 hauls were sampled. While the majority of observations were done on board beamtrawl vessels with mesh sizes ranging between 70 and 99 mm targeting flatfish, data was collected from eight other metiers as well. These included beam trawls with other mesh sizes or target species assemblages, otter trawls and seines. This led, apart from a considerable increase in sampling effort for some métiers, to an increase in the temporal and spatial spread of sampling compared to the previous observer-based sampling. Samples from previously unsampled northern and eastern parts of the North Sea were available now. The spatial distribution of sampling locations matched that of the total effort of the fleet for intensivelysampled métiers.

40|$|The current {{reform of}} the Common Fisheries Policy anticipates more {{extensive}} use of long-term management plans which {{are consistent with the}} ecosystem approach to fishery management. Both long term management plans and estimates of the fishing mortality providing MSY are particularly sensitive to changes in natural mortality, and a prerequisite for estimating natural mortality correctly is the accurate knowledge of species interactions for application in multispecies models. The use of historic data in the multispecies models has so far been limited by the need for data to represent a full spatial coverage. However, the recent model developments have made it possible to integrate regional samples of stomach content data into the multispecies and ecosystem models. It is hence no longer necessary to have complete spatial coverage in a given year, before new stomach data can be included into the models. This provided a unique opportunity to utilize the vast amount of historic data available at individual fisheries research institutes. DTU Aqua together with 8 partners from the Baltic and North Sea has conducted a stomach collection and analysis project in order to (i) include all appropriate historical stomach content information into the Baltic and North Sea stomach content databases, (ii) conduct stomach content analyses of new cod stomachs collected in the Baltic Sea, to support our knowledge of the spatial and temporal stability of cod preferences, and (iii) conduct stomach content analyses of whiting stomachs collected in the Baltic Sea and <b>grey</b> <b>gurnard,</b> mackerel and hake collected in the North Sea to support our knowledge of potentially important predators for which the diet is presently poorly known or is expected to have changed significantly since the last sampling efforts in this area. All existing and new samples and data are included in the final product of this tender, i. e. a common stomach database in ICES exchange format, {{which is going to be}} made available to the scientific community via ICES. This database can then be used to re-estimate multispecies reference points such as FMSY of the different fish species. Within the Baltic Sea, efforts were focused on stomach content analyses of Baltic cod as the most abundant piscivorous fish in this ecosystem. The latest data in the cod stomach content database are from 1993. Since then, the Baltic has changed markedly. Both abundance and spatial distribution of cod and its major fish prey, herring and sprat have changed. Furthermore, due to the occurrence of extended hypoxic areas on the sea-bed, the availability of benthic food may also have changed dramatically. In addition to cod, a limited number of whiting stomach samples from the westernmost areas of the Baltic were collected and analyzed, as this species is potentially another important piscivorous predator in these regions. Before the start of the project, stomach content data for 49476 Baltic cod from the period 1977 - 1993 were available. The initial estimate in the proposal for the present stomach tender was that this number could be increased by ca. 170 % during the course of the project. However, considerably more data have been made available during the project, especially due to the initial underestimation of the available number of historic data. The new data that have been made available increased the number of data to 255 % of the initially available data. Since the focus of this tender was on the Baltic Sea, only relatively limited resources were allocated for work in the North Sea. Thus, in the North Sea, a ‘most benefits for least cost’ strategy was employed. This involved (1) the collection and analysis of new stomachs from selected species which were judged to provide the most relevant new knowledge for multispecies modeling and (2) the transformation of existing historic data into ICES exchange format. Stomachs of 1907 <b>grey</b> <b>gurnard,</b> 517 hake and 702 mackerel have been analyzed, corresponding to 119, 65 and 44 % of target values, respectively. In contrast to the Baltic Sea part of the project, that already had a large number of samples available from the beginning, the North Sea partners had to wait with initiating the stomach analyses until sufficient numbers of samples had become available, and hence the number of analyzed stomachs was not as predictable as for the Baltic Sea. Furthermore, the conversion of historic data from the DAPSTOM database has provided a large number of additional data for these three target species as well as a multitude of other species (> 207. 000 data records for 184 species). Both for the Baltic and the North Sea regions, the new data have already been used and generated great interest in the scientific community. In order to facilitate the application of these data, DTU Aqua will beyond this project make data extracts available on request and collaborate with ICES to make the database available on the ICES data portal as soon as possible...|$|E
