Loudness differences are a frequent source of audience complaints, especially TV commercials and promos that seem too loud.

Unfortunately the peak level reading does not correlate well with the perceived loudness. <b>It</b> <b>basically</b> should only be used to prevent overmodulation.|$|E

Haynes learned {{they were looking for a}} director when Vachon approached him in 2013. He regarded the story, its historical and social context, and collaborating again with Blanchett as motivating factors for his involvement. [...] "What was so interesting to me when I first read this script", Haynes said, [...] "is how <b>it</b> <b>basically</b> links that hothouse mentality of the desiring subject ... to that of the criminal subject, in that both are these over-productive minds that are conjuring narratives constantly ... this crazy state of this furtive hyperactivity in the mind."

Roeser commented later that he did not [...] "think Sony’s ever really known how to sell us, from the beginning (...) and Columbia never felt that they knew how to market us".

500|$|... "Daddy" [...] {{was written}} by Beyoncé as well as Mark Batson. It is the final song on Dangerously in Love, and is a hidden track on some copies. Beyoncé {{initially}} {{was not going to}} include the song on the album, however after undergoing multiple push-backs, she was able to work on extra material for the album which included [...] "Daddy". Over forty-three songs were recorded for Dangerously in Love, all of which were overseen by father Mathew, however Beyoncé secretly planted the song on the album as a hidden track which left Mathew speechless out of shock and appreciation. He later revealed during an interview with Billboard magazine in 2009: [...] "My favorite songs is... 'Daddy'... <b>It</b> <b>basically</b> says 'Thank you for all you've given me and when I marry a man, it will be like my daddy'".

[...] "Well Enough Alone", the first single from the album, was written about the departure of Joe Loeffler, and reached No.4 on the Mainstream rock charts. Chevelle toured with Evanescence, Finger Eleven, and Strata during March and April 2007, followed by a headlining tour with the latter two bands in May and June. The second single from the album, [...] "I Get It", was released on June 12, 2007, and a video for the song debuted on MTV on November 27, 2007. In July {{of the same year}} Chevelle toured Australia as a supporting act for the band The Butterfly Effect. On the tour in Australia, Chevelle's band manager Rose died of cancer, much to the distress of the band.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, Morley derided the {{seriousness}} of contemporary music writers: [...] "Many of the self-proclaimed American anti-rockists - or popists, or poptimists, or pop pricks - actually write {{with a kind of}} fussy, self-important rockist sheen. And for all their studious over-analysis, any definition of rockism is the same today as it's always been." [...] That same year, Rosen forewarned possible excesses of the new movement; that a hierarchy of music biased toward pop is no better than one biased toward rock because both genres have respectable qualities that cannot be ignored. A week later, PopMatters Rob Horning responded to Rosen's embracing of poptimism and wrote that it is [...] "sad to think the sharpest critics drowning in self-importance while believing they are shedding themselves of <b>it.</b> <b>Basically</b> by rejecting all that was once deemed important by a previous generation and embracing the opposite, you can make the case for your own importance. This is not optimism, it’s reaction."

[...] The Mail on Sunday wrote of Russell [...] " [...] has a mind like a steel trap and the organisational skills of Winston Churchill." [...] Reflecting in 1999, Greengrass admitted: [...] "In retrospect {{a lot of the}} things we did were ridiculous. We sit in [...] meetings today and we're like 'It's on the Internet. It's in Camden Market. Whatever'. I think we've learned our lesson." [...] According to Perry: [...] "It seemed, particularly once you heard the album, that this was cocaine grandeur of just the most ludicrous degree.

You just thought: Christ, there is so much coke being done here." ...|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{had already}} started work on the album with Williams, and during one of her breaks from recording, her manager Guy Oseary spoke to Timberlake, {{suggesting}} that it [...] "would be cool" [...] if he recorded some songs with her. Timberlake commented [...] "'That would be awesome,' but I thought, 'That'll never happen', [...] But it's a testament to Pharrell. He had already laid the groundwork {{where she was going}} with it. She played 'Candy Shop' for me, {{and a couple of other}} songs, and I thought, 'What a cool direction.' I thought she could essentially do the whole record with Pharrell if she wanted to, and I asked Tim, 'How do we fit in?' And <b>it</b> <b>basically</b> came down to how we did my record, co-producing, and just throwing Madonna in the mix." [...] The first track recorded by Madonna and Timberlake was [...] "Devil Wouldn't Recognize You". Timberlake felt that the song, which Madonna had been working on for years before the Hard Candy project, was comparable to [...] "Frozen" [...] (1998). He wanted to turn the line [...] "'The devil wouldn't recognize you, but I do" [...] into a catchy hook and make it sound like a concept.|$|E
500|$|The opening {{sequence}} of the episode was meant to replicate the same idea of season 2's premiere [...] "Man of Science, Man of Faith", where {{what seems to be}} a flashback is instead set on a new part of the island. Director Jack Bender questioned what Jack's goal was when he pulled on the chain, but Lindelof told him not to worry, because [...] "Fox will sell it, and he did". Lindelof described when Jack attacks his father at the AA meeting as [...] "pot-committed... <b>it</b> <b>basically</b> means you put so much money on the bluff, you can't fold your cards". The scene with Kate in a dress was inspired by Raiders of the Lost Ark, where Belloq gives a dress for Marion Ravenwood to wear, and was intended to make [...] "tom-boyish" [...] Kate feel vulnerable. The title, inspired by Charles Dickens' eponymous novel, refers to the reveal of another [...] "city" [...] on the island with the place where the Others live, in addition to the castaways' beach camp. The episode has only three characters of the second season's main cast, Jack, Kate and Sawyer. Lindelof later described this limited scope as [...] "a mistake, when the audience is away from the show for that long, they want to see everybody", causing the following season openers to have scenes with most of the main characters.|$|E
