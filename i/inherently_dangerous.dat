40|$|This paper proposes the {{building}} blocks towards a general theory on the optimal use of carrots and sticks in legal and social enforcement systems. Although in principle carrots and sticks are equivalent with respect to marginal incentives, the central theme of the paper {{is that they are}} nonequivalent in many other respects. Our central finding is that sticks are intrinsically superior to carrots because they are meant not to be applied: sticks incentivize simply by threatening, while carrots incentivize by actually rewarding. Consequently, sticks minimize sanctioning costs, risk bearing and distributional side-effects. We show that a perfectly informed principal will never use carrots. However, sticks are also <b>inherently</b> more <b>dangerous</b> tools in the hands of non-benevolent principals since enforcement under carrots is always Pareto efficient while enforcement under sticks is not even necessarily Kaldor-Hicks efficient. As society becomes more complex, labor mor...|$|R

In addition, the crew needs to be well trained at working together and with the ship in question. Finally, the sailor must be mentally prepared for dealing with harsh situations. There have been many well-documented cases where sailors had to be rescued simply {{because they were not}} sufficiently prepared (the sailors as well as the ship) or lacked experience for their venture and ran into serious trouble.|$|R

40|$|While {{carrots and}} sticks create in {{principle}} identical marginal incentives, {{they are not}} randomly used in legal enforcement systems. This paper tries to draw a broader picture of their nonequivalence than previous contributions. It analyzes the fundamental characteristics of carrots and sticks and derives general rules on their optimal use. If a benevolent principal is fully informed about the agents’ effort costs, she will only use sticks, as they {{are not meant to}} be applied, thus minimizing transaction costs and risks. In addition, sticks cause less distributional distortions when the agents are sufficiently homogenous with respect to effort costs and benefits. However, these comparative advantages of sticks weaken as the complexity of the situation increases (the principal is less informed or agents are heterogeneous). Moreover, sticks are <b>inherently</b> more <b>dangerous</b> tools in the hands of non-benevolent principals since enforcement under carrots is always Pareto efficient while enforcement under sticks is not even necessarily Kaldor-Hicks efficient. Our analysis suggests that, as society becomes more complex (labor more specialized, preferences more heterogeneous, and decisions more decentralized), carrots will be used more frequently...|$|R
