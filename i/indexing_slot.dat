30|$|In this study, all the nodes {{undergoing}} {{the proposed}} MSA process employ the initial frame length Linit. Linit is calculated as the upper bound of the affordable frame length. After the proposed MSA process is completed, the frame length {{of all the}} nodes may be less than Linit because of slot reuse in the TDMA system [22]. Therefore, Linitneeds to be reduced for efficiency. In the proposed MSA process, the slots are always allocated from each source-node side in a flow. Therefore, the <b>slot</b> <b>index</b> allocated by the destination node is the highest one in the flow. After the proposed MSA process is completed, all the destination nodes broadcast that <b>slot</b> <b>index.</b> If a destination node is related to multiple flows, the highest <b>slot</b> <b>index</b> among the <b>slot</b> <b>indices</b> allocated by the destination is broadcast. If a node hears a higher <b>slot</b> <b>index</b> than the one it currently knows, it rebroadcasts the new index.

We propose a novel terahertz slot waveguide structure to achieve a better tradeoff between propagation length and field confinement capacity, the novel waveguide consisting of a two slot structure. The performances of terahertz waveguides were investigated using the finite-element method. The results demonstrated that the hybrid slot waveguide (HSW) provides significantly enhanced field confinement in low <b>index</b> <b>slot</b> regions: more than five times that of traditional low <b>index</b> <b>slot</b> waveguides (LISWs). An optimized HSW structure was achieved by tuning the tradeoff between mode confinement and propagation length. We also showed that its integration in conventional planar waveguide circuits was greatly improved compared with the LISWs, by comparing their crosstalk.

This is not the case for classical rib and strip waveguides where light is predominantly guided in the high index material. However, in slot waveguides, light is confined in a low <b>index</b> <b>slot</b> region sandwiched between two high index rails and due to the discontinuity of the electric field at the interface between the rails and slot, a significant fraction of the electromagnetic field is localized in the slot. As such slot waveguides present an interesting alternative for biosensing applications especially when made using silicon nitride which permits slot widths of up to 200 nm and as such reachable fabrication tolerances, and reduced propagation losses compared to silicon slot waveguides with its higher refractive index contrast. Furthermore, for biosensing, the wider slot facilitates sample transport and using a multiple-slot structure, further enhancement of the optical confinement in low <b>index</b> <b>slot</b> regions is possible.

Thus, a careful design of the structures allows the realization of high sensitivity devices even in very low refractive index materials (e. g., polymers) to be achieved. Advantages of low index dielectrics in terms of cost, functionalization and ease of fabrication are discussed while keeping both CMOS compatibility and integrable design schemes.

30|$|For {{practical}} implementations, an SHP waveguide {{needs to}} be placed on a substrate. The presence of the substrate breaks the symmetry of SP mode, leading to the dramatic decrease of propagation length. Here in this paper, by introducing an asymmetry into the SHP waveguide, we propose a novel asymmetric hybrid plasmonic (AHP) waveguide to eliminate the influence of a substrate on its guiding properties and restore its broken symmetric SP mode. Based on the combination of symmetric and hybrid SP modes, the AHP waveguide exhibits a quite long propagation length along with nanoscale mode confinement. In the following sections, with the finite element method (FEM), we investigate the guiding properties of the AHP waveguide on a substrate at a wavelength of 1, 550  nm to target potential applications in telecommunications. Compared to an SHP waveguide with the same structure embedded in air cladding, the propagation length of the AHP waveguide is approximately the same along with a comparable normalized modal area. Moreover, the AHP waveguide has a horizontal slot structure featured with a horizontal low <b>index</b> <b>slot,</b> which can be convenient to be fabricated by layered deposition or thermal oxidation [21].|$|R

Finally, we show that knowing all ten rolls in advance, results in a relatively small increase in score. Although the game has a random component and requires a non-trivial strategy to be solved optimally, this strategy needs only polynomial time and space. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—With {{the rapid}} {{increase}} of real-time applications, jitter, delay, and throughput {{have become the}} three important QoS criteria in the scheduling of input-queued (IQ) switches with virtual output queues (VOQ). In this paper, we propose a novel frame-based scheduling algorithm, referred to as dichotomy slot allocation (DSA), to achieve high throughput, bounded delay, and bounded jitter. DSA possesses three major characteristics. First, DSA schedules the switch on a per-VOQ basis, and strives to provision QoS guarantees for each traffic stream corresponding to each VOQ. Second, DSA allocates the exact amount of slots to schedule the actual traffic of each VOQ, and decides the time slot for each packet. Third, DSA equally allocates the slots in a frame to each port pair, and then adjusts the scheduling to meet the actual traffic demand. The adjustment process employs a specially designed order named Dichotomy Order to guarantee QoS. Both analysis and simulation results demonstrate that DSA achieves good performance in jitter and throughput. <b>Index</b> Terms—Dichotomy <b>slot</b> allocation, input-queued switch, jitter, throughput, QoS.
