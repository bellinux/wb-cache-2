5|$|Arriving in Iaşi (Jassy) in 1876, Goldfaden was {{fortunate}} to be better known as a good poet — many of whose poems had been set to music and had become popular songs — than as a less-than-successful businessman. Nevertheless, when he sought funds from Isaac Librescu for another newspaper, Librescu was uninterested in that proposition. Librescu's wife remarked that Yiddish-language journalism was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> starve; she suggested {{that there would be}} a lot more of a market for Yiddish-language theater. Librescu offered Goldfaden 100 francs for a public recital of his songs in the garden of Shimen Mark, Grădina Pomul Verde ("the Green Fruit-Tree Garden").|$|E

The first place the Fabulous Ones show up after leaving Memphis is in Southwest Championship Wrestling from San Antonio, Texas. The Fabulous Ones {{supposedly}} won a tournament in Australia to become the first ever SWCW World Tag Team Champions. In reality, there was no tournament; it was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> reignite the feud between the Fabulous Ones and the Sheepherders who had been with the SWCW for a while. On March 4, 1984, the Sheepherders defeated the Fabulous Ones for the SWCW gold ending Keirn and Lane’s brief stay in Texas.|$|E

However, Yello abruptly cancelled the sessions after just ten days, unhappy {{with the sound of}} the album. Meier explained that the duo felt that the songs were losing their soul, saying, [...] "Getting technically more experienced was leading us onto a slick perfectionist track. We even went to a German digital studio to do the most perfect remixes on a digital machine with the SSL Desk and the rest of it. And we had to learn, a difficult process for us, that perfection is <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> escape from having nothing to say... With Stella we were being dragged down by an excess of perfection." [...] Blank later said, [...] "All the balances were wrong and the dynamic was lost, so I did lots of remixes again in Zurich to save this album". The group returned to their studios in Zurich and Blank started the process of remixing the tracks himself, with the exception of [...] "Desert Inn" [...] which he felt was acceptable as it was, [...] "Blue Nabou" [...] which the duo had already decided would not appear on the album and hence there was no urgency to improve it, and [...] "Angel No" [...] because Blank did not have time to mix it to the standard that he wanted. With the delay in mixing, the album's provisional release date of 1 October 1984 could not be met, and in order to avoid being lost among the Christmas releases, a new release date in January 1985 was set.|$|E

A plain distinction grows obscure of late: Man, if he will, may pardon; but the State [...] 10 Forgets its function if not fixed as Fate. So thought our sires: a hundred years ago, If men were knaves, why, people called them so, And crime could see the prison-portal bend Its brow severe at no long vista's end.

The public servant who has stolen or lied, If called on, may resign with honest pride: As unjust favor put him in, why doubt Disfavor as unjust has turned him out? Even it indicted, what is that but fudge To him who counted-in the elective judge?
