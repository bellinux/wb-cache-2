5|$|A third {{suggested}} alignment {{was some}} sort of planetary conjunction occurring on 21 December 2012; however, there was no conjunction on that date. Multi-planet alignments did occur in both 2000 and 2010, each with no ill result <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth.</b> Jupiter is the largest planet in the Solar System; larger than all other planets combined. When Jupiter is near opposition, the difference in gravitational force that the Earth experiences is less than 1% of the force that the Earth feels daily from the Moon.|$|E
5|$|The massive, compact {{nature of}} a white dwarf {{produces}} a strong surface gravity. Astronomers denote this value by the decimal logarithm of the gravitational force in cgs units, or log g. For IK Pegasi B, log g is 8.95. By comparison, log g <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> is 2.99. Thus the surface gravity on IK Pegasi is over 900,000 times the gravitational force on the Earth.|$|E

5|$|This rapid {{progress}} in geology and paleontology during the 1830s and 1840s was {{aided by a}} growing international network of geologists and fossil specialists whose work was organized and reviewed by {{an increasing number of}} geological societies. Many of these geologists and paleontologists were now paid professionals working for universities, museums and government geological surveys. The relatively high level of public support <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth</b> sciences was due to their cultural impact, and their proven economic value in helping to exploit mineral resources such as coal.|$|E
5|$|VHEMT {{promotes}} a more extreme ideology than Population Action International, {{a group that}} argues humanity should reduce—but not eliminate—its population to care <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth.</b> However, the VHEMT platform is more moderate and serious than the Church of Euthanasia, which advocates population reduction by suicide and cannibalism. The 1995 survey found that 36% considered themselves members of Earth First! or had donated to the group in the previous five years.|$|E

SvalSat and Poker Flat are collectively responsible for half of the network's 140 daily passes. Satellites operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration using SvalSat includes the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership and the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program. Other American satellites include the United States Geological Survey's Landsat 5 and Landsat 7 and the private Iridium Communications' satellites.|$|E

5|$|The {{series is}} notable for {{borrowing}} extensively from East Asian art and mythology for its universe, and employed cultural consultants Edwin Zane and calligrapher Siu-Leung Lee {{to help determine}} its art direction and settings. Its character designs are influenced by Chinese art and history, Hinduism, Taoism and Buddhism, and Yoga. The series' music and sound were composed by Jeremy Zuckerman and Benjamin Wynn, who experimented {{with a wide range}} of different instruments, including the guzheng, pipa, and duduk, to create music and sounds that matched the Asiatic-influenced setting of the show. The art style of the various fictitious locations visited throughout the series are based on real locations in Asia. Notably, sites such as the Forbidden City and the Great Wall of China in Beijing were inspirations <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> Kingdom city of Ba Sing Se in the show.|$|E
5|$|The {{story begins}} in the neutral Orb Union owned space colony Heliopolis, where secret {{development}} of 5 advanced mobile suits <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> Forces war effort {{in exchange for their}} technical data to be shared with the neutral Orb Union military. Additionally Heliopolis constructs a unique carrier battleship, the Archangel to base the five mobile suits from <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> Forces. The colony is attacked by ZAFT forces, the military of the Coordinators, with the objective of stealing the new units. During the incursion an Orb union student and Coordinator named Kira Yamato, upon seeing his friends in danger, pilots the GAT-X105 Strike mobile suit to fend off the invaders but the colony is critically damaged in the ensuing fight. As Heliopolis disintegrates, the survivors board the Archangel, and begin their journey to the Alliance base in Alaska. During the journey to Earth, Kira pilots the Strike to counter a series of attacks by ZAFT but is seemingly killed by his childhood friend, ZAFT soldier Athrun Zala, during one of their battles in which he also is nearly killed. Kira survives the attack and is taken by a blind priest to one of the PLANT space colonies, home to the Coordinators to recover. The Archangel arrives in Alaska but ZAFT launches a full-scale attack on the base overpowering their enemies.|$|E

30|$|The {{value of}} 33  °C was {{obtained}} from the difference between the current average temperature of <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> including its atmosphere (≈ 15  °C) and a calculated value of − 18  °C <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth’s</b> mean temperature without an atmosphere. However, Volokin and ReLlez (2014) showed that a more correct estimate <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth’s</b> mean temperature without an atmosphere is about − 75  °C. This error has been caused by incorrect application of the Stefan-Boltzmann radiation law to spheres. Taking 15  °C and subtracting − 75  °C results in a value of 90  °C.|$|R
