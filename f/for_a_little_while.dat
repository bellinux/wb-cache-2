5|$|And matters {{continued}} {{thus for}} a considerable time. But a sedition and civil war came upon the wretched people and turned their cruelty toward us against one another. So we breathed <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> as they ceased from their rage against us. But presently the change from that milder reign was announced to us, and great fear of what was threatened seized us.|$|E

25|$|The Attacker {{had a brief}} {{career with}} the Fleet Air Arm, not seeing any action during its time with the FAA and being taken out of {{first-line}} service in 1954. It remained in service with the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (RNVR) <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> longer, being taken out of service in early 1957. The Attacker was replaced in the front line squadrons by the later and more capable Hawker Sea Hawk and de Havilland Sea Venom.|$|E
25|$|In 1993 {{two of the}} 737-200s were {{replaced}} by Boeing 737-400s (C2-RN10 and 'RN11), leaving the venerable C2-RN3 (kept because it was convertible between passenger and freight configurations) to soldier on <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> longer. The airline, by now only operating a single 737-400, was corporatised in July 1996 as the Nauru Air Corporation (NAC) headed by a new CEO without ties to the government, enabling it to operate independently in a commercial marketplace, free from most of its government constraints.|$|E

Her role became one of conveying supplies to the various squadrons blockading French ports. On 15 March 1808 Mediator recaptured the Swedish ship Maria Christiana. In May 1808 Captain John Pasco managed to obtain the command of Mediator for three months.|$|E

25|$|Under heavy fire, the U.S. 35th Regiment {{infantry}} {{soldiers and}} dismounted 10th Cavalry troops advanced across the Mexico–US border through {{the buildings and}} streets of Nogales, Sonora and up onto the nearby hilltops. This was done while other units of the 35th Regiment held the main line near the border post. About 7:45pm, the Mexicans waved a large white flag of surrender over their customs building. Lt. Colonel Herman observed and then ordered an immediate cease fire. Snipers on both sides continued shooting <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> after the cease fire, but were eventually silenced upon orders from their superiors.|$|E
25|$|I wasn't {{meant to}} be the lead singer of the band. My whole idea was to play the {{saxophone}} and I really wanted Stephen Cummings to be the singer, 'cause we were really great mates but for whatever reason he bowed out after {{just a couple of}} rehearsals. We had a full list of songs by Wayne Burt and that really made the difference for us. I wasn't writing any songs really and I thought Wayne was a much better singer than me as well but he didn't want to be the lead singer, so we sort of shared it around <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while.</b> – Joe Camilleri.|$|E
25|$|While the fruitless {{negotiations}} {{were taking place}} the Fallschirmjägers were preparing {{to move away from}} their stronghold and find a new place to fight from. The arrival of the two Norwegian mortars had completely changed the tactical situation and the German force′s supply of ammunition was also running dangerously low. Schmidt decided that he had to move his troops into a new and more defensible position. Negotiations were kept up to buy time so the paratroopers could slip away into cover of darkness. Schmidt believed that strong German forces were advancing up the Gudbrandsdal valley and that if he could hold out <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> longer the situation might still be salvaged. The reality of the situation was however that the German advanced units were stuck just north of Minnesund far to the south of both Gudbrandsdal and Dombås.|$|E

25|$|The river Mazarus, {{which at}} that time appears to have formed the {{boundary}} with Segesta, was only about 25km west of Selinunte; and {{it is certain that}} at a somewhat later period the territory of Selinunte extended to its banks, and that that city had a fort and emporium at its mouth. On the other side Selinunte's territory certainly extended as far as the Halycus (modern Platani), at the mouth of which it founded the colony of Minoa, or Heracleia, as it was afterward called. It is clear, therefore, that Selinunte had already achieved great power and prosperity; but very little information survives about its history. Like most of the Sicilian cities, it passed from an oligarchy to a tyranny, and about 510BCE was subject to a despot named Peithagoras, who was overthrown {{with the assistance of the}} Spartan Euryleon, one of the companions of Dorieus. Euryleon himself ruled the city, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while,</b> but was speedily overthrown and put to death by the Selinuntines. The Selinuntines supported the Carthaginians during the great expedition of Hamilcar (480BCE); they even promised to send a contingent to the Carthaginian army, but this did not arrive until after Hamilcar's defeat at the Battle of Himera.|$|E
25|$|The route was {{finalized}} in the City of New York in 1890 and in Long Island City by 1891. Construction {{was started}} on June 7, 1892, as a NY project, {{and the bottom}} of the tunnel shaft was reached in December of the same year. As Steinway was the NY's biggest stockholder, the tunnel was named after him. However, soon after the start of construction, there were many complications. The project was difficult due to complex geological formations beneath the river, and there were frequent blowouts and floods. It was curtailed <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> when five people were killed on December 28, 1892. At the corner of Vernon Boulevard, Jackson Avenue and 50th Avenue, a -deep shaft was dug, and on December 28, during an attempt to heat frozen dynamite in the shaft, an uncontrolled explosion claimed five dead and twelve injured. Numerous surrounding houses were heavily damaged. Due to high compensation claims, the Company was financially ruined. Attempts to raise additional funds failed because of the stock market crash of 1893. Work was stopped as a result, and it was boarded up. Investors refused to fund the tunnel because they feared that it was unsafe. Until Steinway died in 1896, some attempts were occasionally made to resume construction.|$|E
500|$|Szilard and Zinn {{conducted}} a simple experiment {{on the seventh}} floor of Pupin Hall at Columbia, using a radium-beryllium source to bombard uranium with neutrons. Initially nothing registered on the oscilloscope, but then Zinn realized that it was not plugged in. On doing so, they discovered significant neutron multiplication in natural uranium, proving that a chain reaction might be possible. Szilard later described the event: [...] "We turned the switch and saw the flashes. We watched them <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> and then we switched everything off and went home." [...] He understood the implications and consequences of this discovery, though. [...] "That night, there was very little {{doubt in my mind that}} the world was headed for grief".|$|E

500|$|Æthelbald, who {{had ruled}} Mercia since 716, {{was assassinated in}} 757. According to a later {{continuation}} of Bede's Historia Ecclesiastica (written anonymously after Bede's death) the king was [...] "treacherously murdered at night by his own bodyguards," [...] though the reason why is unrecorded. Æthelbald was initially succeeded by Beornred, about whom little is known. The continuation of Bede comments that Beornred [...] "ruled <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while,</b> and unhappily", and adds that [...] "the same year, Offa, having put Beornred to flight, sought to gain {{the kingdom of the}} Mercians by bloodshed." [...] It is possible that Offa did not gain the throne until 758, however, since a charter of 789 describes Offa as being in the thirty-first year of his reign.|$|E
500|$|His body arches, forcing {{his torso}} to raise against the cross. Blood pours from the wounds {{in his hands}} as his head falls to the side from fatigue and the {{physical}} reality of approaching death. His body is naked except for a sheer and transparent loincloth that only just covers his thighs and buttocks. The choice of a white, veil-like loincloth, dramatically more modest than the red garment in the Arezzo work, {{may be influenced by}} earlier crucifixions by Giunta Pisano. His nakedness highlights his vulnerability and suffering. It seems influenced by a thirteenth-century Franciscan Meditation on Christ that emphasised pathos and human interest in the suffering of the Passion; [...] "Turn your eyes away from His divinity <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> and consider Him purely as a man".|$|E
500|$|Amir tells Sohrab of {{his plans}} {{to take him back}} to America and {{possibly}} adopt him. However, American authorities demand evidence of Sohrab's orphan status. Amir tells Sohrab that he may {{have to go back to}} the orphanage <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> as they encounter a problem in the adoption process, and Sohrab, terrified about returning to the orphanage, attempts suicide. Amir eventually manages to take him back to the United States. After his adoption, Sohrab refuses to interact with Amir or Soraya until the former reminisces about Hassan and kites and shows off some of Hassan's tricks. In the end, Sohrab only gives a lopsided smile, but Amir takes it with all his heart as he runs the kite for Sohrab, saying, [...] "For you, a thousand times over." ...|$|E

500|$|Lytle later noted, [...] "It was {{actually}} Jim 's fault. He {{suggested that we}} consider playing some shows, and I went, 'No', [...] he convinced me {{it might be a}} good idea. We talked about it <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while.</b> I didn't think anyone else in the band would be into it, [...] he checked around and it turns out they were all enthusiastic. I think I was the last one to say yes.... I {{was actually}} blown away that they even wanted to. Once I found that out, I said 'OK, let's start doing the work, figure out how to play the songs.' The weird moment was when he had the first rehearsal; I had no idea how it was going to turn out. After five days of playing together it actually sounded really good. It was too easy, and we were actually really having a good time together." ...|$|E
500|$|Music critic Keith Harris of Rolling Stone wrote, [...] "Janet Jackson has {{abandoned}} the plastic R of 2006's 20 Y.O. for a sexier brand of digitized megapop [...] you can dismiss any {{images of the}} abusive Jackson clan that flit into your mind. Just lie back and enjoy the sensations as pure aural autoeroticism." [...] Andy Kellman of Allmusic gave a four-out-of-five star rating, noting several tracks were [...] "as innocent, universal, and inviting as anything else in Janet's past", and called the songs [...] "Rock with U" [...] and [...] "2Nite" [...] "irresistible, grade-A dancefloor tracks". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine described it as Jackson's [...] "most cohesive album in a while", giving three-out-of-five stars. Dan Gennoe of Yahoo! Music UK gave it seven out of ten stars saying [...] "Still, if not perfect, there's plenty to like on Discipline, and while {{none of it is}} exactly vintage Janet, there's enough here to keep the Jackson name on pop's A-list <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> longer." ...|$|E
500|$|At a {{press conference}} in Paramount Studios in Los Angeles, Aguilera {{confirmed}} that she would be performing at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards on September 7, 2008. She discussed about allowing her newly born son, Max, to watch the performance, saying: [...] "This will be his first time watching me perform on television, but only <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>while</b> because he's not really allowed to watch television yet. I'll make an exception for the VMAs." [...] Aguilera discussed the concept of the performance beforehand saying: [...] "You're going to get a first look and a first listen at my new image and my new sound. The last album, the style and sound was about vintage glam — this one is all about the future". The performance began with Aguilera standing in a tower of neon-lit boxes, singing [...] "Genie 2.0" [...] while wearing second-skin leather catsuit accessorized with silver armbands, a black-leather cat mask, black cape and platinum-blond hair. Then, she began performing [...] "Keeps Gettin' Better". Nick Levine from Digital Spy called the performance [...] "sassy, slickly-choreographed".|$|E
