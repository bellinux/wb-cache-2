Furthermore, two towed Harvey torpedoes were mounted at the rear of the ship. While Petr Veliky was not really maneuverable enough to make full use of these weapons, they were a formidable deterrent to other ships trying to ram.|$|E

Composer Mark Snow used samples of Gregorian chants in his score for Melissa's death scene. The production team contacted officials of Apison, Tennessee, who sent them a real citizen's registry from the Civil War era which was reproduced by the props department and an expert calligrapher to make those Scully finds in the county courthouse.

2500|$|Churidars, or more {{properly}} churidar pyjamas, are tightly fitting trousers worn by {{both men and}} women in South Asia. Churidars are a variant of the common salwar pants. Salwars are cut wide at the top and narrow at the ankle. Churidars narrow more quickly, so that contours of the leg are revealed. [...] They are usually cut on the bias, making them naturally stretchy. Stretch is important when pants are closefitting. They are also longer than the leg and sometimes finish with a tightly fitting buttoned cuff at the ankle. The <b>excess</b> <b>length</b> falls into folds and appears like a set of bangles resting on the ankle (hence 'churidar'; 'churi': bangle, 'dar': like). When the wearer is sitting, the extra material is the [...] "ease" [...] that makes it possible to bend the legs and sit comfortably. [...] The word churidar is from Urdu and made its way into English only in the 20th century. Earlier, tight fitting churidar-like pants worn in India were referred to by the British as Moghul breeches, long-drawers, or mosquito drawers.|$|E

40|$|Following {{nosocomial}} {{cases of}} Legionella pneumophila, {{the investigation of}} a hot water system revealed that 81. 5 % of sampled taps were positive for L. pneumophila, {{despite the presence of}} protective levels of copper in the water. A significant reduction of L. pneumophila counts was observed by culture after heat shock disinfection. The following corrective measures were implemented to control L. pneumophila: increasing the hot water temperature (55 to 60 °C), flushing taps weekly with hot water, removing <b>excess</b> <b>lengths</b> of piping and maintaining a water temperature of 55 °C throughout the system. A gradual reduction in L. pneumophila counts was observed using the culture method and qPCR in the 18 months after implementation of the corrective measures.

50|$|Since Golomb-Rice {{codes are}} quite inefficient for {{encoding}} low entropy distributions because the coding rate {{is at least}} one bit per symbol, significant redundancy may be produced because the smooth regions in an image can be encoded at less than 1 bit per symbol. To avoid having <b>excess</b> code <b>length</b> over the entropy, one can use alphabet extension which codes blocks of symbols instead of coding individual symbols. This spreads out the <b>excess</b> coding <b>length</b> over many symbols. This is the “run” mode of JPEG-LS and it is executed once a flat or smooth context region characterized by zero gradients is detected. A run of west symbol “a” is expected and the end of run occurs when a new symbol occurs or the end of line is reached. The total run of length is encoded and the encoder would return to the “regular” mode.|$|R
50|$|The strain margin {{requirements}} tend to favour cable designs using multiple loose tubes. Tight-buffer cable designs {{do not provide}} sufficient strain margin and the optical fibre transmission performance is compromised under strong winds, heavy ice accretions and at high temperatures. In cables based on a single loose tube design, the optical fibres have too much freedom of movement along the cable axis. Consequently, mechanical {{energy in the form}} of wind-induced vibration of the host conductor causes the optical fibres to move gradually ‘downhill’ and allowing the <b>excess</b> fibre <b>length</b> to collect in the low point of the span. This uneven distribution of <b>excess</b> fibre <b>length</b> compromises the optical performance of the cable with increased optical attenuation at low temperatures in the relatively crowded sections of tube in the middle of spans and at high temperatures where the fibres are under strain at the high sections close to the towers. These problems are worse on longer spans.|$|R

50|$|To {{avoid the}} need for rolling-up <b>excess</b> <b>length,</b> using an {{extension}} reel or for cutting the cord to size, extension cords are sold in prefabricated lengths of 1 to 150 feet (30 cm to 45 m). Every foot of cord increases the electrical resistance, in turn decreasing the power the cord can deliver. Therefore, the longer the cord, the larger {{the diameter of the}} conductors need be to minimise voltage drop (wire gauge numbers are smaller for larger diameter wire). Because of this, it is best to use a cord that's exactly as long as needed and no more.|$|E
30|$|Introduction The {{impact of}} {{nosocomial}} infections (NI) {{in intensive care}} unit (ICU) on the whole hospital stay (from ICU admission to hospital discharge) is seldom studied and is still a subject of controversy.

40|$|The {{effects on}} system {{efficiency}} of <b>excess</b> refrigerant line <b>length</b> are calculated for an idealized residential {{heating and cooling}} system. By <b>excess</b> line <b>length</b> is meant refrigerant tubing {{in excess of the}} 25 R provided for in standard equipment efficiency test methods. The purpose of the calculation is to provide input for a proposed method for evaluating refrigerant distribution system efficiency. A refrigerant distribution system uses refrigerant (instead of ducts or pipes) to carry heat and/or cooling effect from the equipment to the spaces in the building in which it is used. Such systems would include so-called mini-splits as well as more conventional split systems that {{for one reason or another}} have the indoor and outdoor coils separated by more than 25 ft. This report performs first-order calculations of the effects on system efficiency, in both the heating and cooling modes, of pressure drops within the refrigerant lines and of heat transfer between the refrigerant lines and the space surrounding them...|$|R

50|$|During assembly, all {{components}} {{are placed on}} several brass rivets. The first {{components are}} generally an aluminum separator and a flat steel spring. Once a layer of tools is installed, another separator and spring are placed for the next layer of tools. This process is repeated until all the desired tool layers and the finishing separator are installed. Once the knife is built, the metal parts are fastened by adding brass flanged bushings to the rivets. The <b>excess</b> <b>length</b> of the rivets is then cut off to make them flush with the bushings. Finally the remaining length of the rivets is flattened into the flanged bushings.|$|E
50|$|Being {{cognizant}} {{of both a}} territory's siding capacity and the train length of all trains operating over a territory {{is a very important}} part of a train dispatcher/rail traffic controller's job. It may be necessary for trains to be held back at sidings which can contain them. Presently, in 2016, there is no system in place to prevent the meeting of two trains at a siding in which neither train could fit. That responsibility lies solely with the train dispatcher/RTC. Should such an event occur, the process and ensuing delay can be quite onerous. When such an occasion does happen, the <b>excess</b> <b>length</b> of one train would have to be moved to another track or ultimately to another location to permit the passing of the superior train.|$|E
25|$|A scale {{also allows}} bullets and cases to be sorted by weight, which can {{increase}} consistency further. Sorting bullets by weight has obvious benefits, as {{each set of}} matched bullets will perform more consistently. Sorting cases by weight is done to group cases by case wall thickness, and match cases with similar interior volumes. Military cases, for example, tend to be thicker, while cases that have been reloaded numerous times will have thinner walls due to brass flowing forward under firing, and <b>excess</b> case <b>length</b> being later trimmed from the case mouth.|$|R

50|$|One of the {{strengths}} of spiral coil binding is that the supplies are available {{in a variety of}} lengths. Most users purchase spiral coils in twelve inch lengths. This spine is inserted onto an eleven-inch document and the <b>excess</b> <b>length</b> of coil is cut and crimped {{at each end of the}} book. However, the forming process for creating spiral coil binding elements allows them to be created in virtually any length. Many binderies and print shops choose to purchase coils in 36-inch lengths in order to have the flexibility to bind custom document sizes and to reduce waste. For binding documents shorter than eleven inches it is also possible to purchase shorter lengths of spiral coil in order to save time and money.|$|E
5000|$|The {{fabric of}} the garment was {{typically}} cut longer than the shoulder-to-floor measurement of the women or man wearing it. The <b>excess</b> <b>length</b> was dealt with at the waist (creating the kolpos) and optionally the top edge (creating the apoptygma). To create the kolpos, a zone was tied around the body below the breast (high-girdled) or at the waist (low-girdled) and excess fabric was pulled up over it. The fabric fell over the girdle so as to hide it, and was often pulled longer in back than in front. This fold was the kolpos. A second (visible) zone could be tied over the kolpos to redefine the waist, high or low. This might be hidden again by the apoptygma, the loose, folded down top of the peplos.|$|E
