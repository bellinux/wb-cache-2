His father {{died when he was}} two years old, after the family had moved to Southend-on-Sea, Essex. His mother then moved with him to Brighton, Sussex, where they lived with her parents above a shop. Merrifield's archaeological career began in 1930 when, although still at school, he was taken on as an assistant to the curator of Brighton Museum, H. S. Toms. While working there, in 1935, he gained an external degree <b>in</b> <b>anthropology</b> from the University of London.|$|E

50|$|The German-born Franz Boas {{managed to}} shift the paradigm. His approach, later named {{cultural}} relativism, resists universal values of any kind.

This principle has been established as axiomatic <b>in</b> contemporary <b>anthropology.</b> The Vietnam War consolidated the Boasian shift <b>in</b> American <b>anthropology.</b>|$|R
5|$|After {{graduating from}} Jamaica High School in 1958, Savage {{attended}} Queens College, where {{he earned a}} bachelor's degree in biology in 1963. After college Savage taught high school for several years in New York City. His first marriage in 1964 to Carol Ely ended in divorce, and he remarried in 1967 after meeting his current wife, Janet. During this time Savage also worked for famous psychedelic drug advocate Timothy Leary as keeper of the stone gatehouse on the Hitchcock Cattle Company estate in Millbrook, New York, to which Leary had been given access. Leary hired him to the post because Savage did not use LSD himself. Savage then studied at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, earning a Master of Science in botany in 1970 and a Master of Arts <b>in</b> <b>anthropology</b> in 1972. He obtained a PhD in 1978 from the University of California, Berkeley, in nutritional ethnomedicine. His thesis was titled Nutritional Ethnomedicine in Fiji.|$|E
5|$|Ralph Merrifield (19131995) {{was born}} and raised in Brighton, and, {{following}} an education at Varndean Grammar School, he worked at Brighton Museum. Gaining a London External Degree <b>in</b> <b>anthropology</b> in 1935, he developed a lifelong interest in the religious and magical beliefs of England. After serving in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War, he returned to working at Brighton Museum, but in 1950 was appointed Assistant Keeper of the Guildhall Museum in the City of London. Over a six-month period in 1956 and 1957, he was stationed in Accra, Ghana, where he worked at the National Museum of Ghana, organising the collection in preparation for the country's independence from the British Empire in March 1957. Returning to the Guildhall Museum, Merrifield compiled the first detailed study of Roman London for 35 years, which was published as The Roman City of London (1965). Following the creation of the Museum of London in 1975, he became its Deputy Director, a post which he held until his retirement in 1978.|$|E
5|$|While some, like Spencer, used analogy {{from natural}} {{selection}} as an argument against government {{intervention in the}} economy to benefit the poor, others, including Alfred Russel Wallace, argued that action was needed to correct social and economic inequities {{to level the playing}} field before natural selection could improve humanity further. Some political commentaries, including Walter Bagehot's Physics and Politics (1872), attempted to extend the idea of natural selection to competition between nations and between human races. Such ideas were incorporated into what was already an ongoing effort by some working <b>in</b> <b>anthropology</b> to provide scientific evidence for the superiority of Caucasians over non white races and justify European imperialism. Historians write that most such political and economic commentators had only a superficial understanding of Darwin's scientific theory, and were as strongly influenced by other concepts about social progress and evolution, such as the Lamarckian ideas of Spencer and Haeckel, as they were by Darwin's work. Darwin objected to his ideas being used to justify military aggression and unethical business practices as he believed morality was part of fitness in humans, and he opposed polygenism, the idea that human races were fundamentally distinct and did not share a recent common ancestry.|$|E
