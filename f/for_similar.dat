5|$|Breeding {{in order}} to correct {{pigmentation}} often lacks dependability. Because colour is determined by many genes, {{some of which are}} recessive, crossbreeding a pigmentation non-standard yellow Labrador to a black Labrador may not correct the matter or prevent future generations carrying the same recessive genes. <b>For</b> <b>similar</b> reasons, crossbreeding chocolate to yellow Labradors is also often avoided.|$|E
5|$|In the Bahamas, {{insurers}} and reinsurers estimated industry insured losses at about $300million (2004 dollars). All cool-season vegetable plantings, {{and the entire}} banana crop, were lost during Frances. The pineapple crop was significantly impacted by wind damage in Eleuthera, while the entire fruit crop was lost <b>for</b> <b>similar</b> reasons. The corn crop in Long Island and Cat Island was completely lost. Significant poultry losses were experienced.|$|E

5|$|Although Dawkins {{invented the}} term meme, {{he has not}} claimed that the idea was entirely novel, {{and there have been}} other {{expressions}} <b>for</b> <b>similar</b> ideas in the past. For instance, John Laurent has suggested that the term may have derived from the work of the little-known German biologist Richard Semon. In 1904, Semon published Die Mneme (which appeared in English in 1924 as The Mneme). This book discusses the cultural transmission of experiences, with insights parallel to those of Dawkins. Laurent also found the term mneme used in Maurice Maeterlinck's The Life of the White Ant (1926), and has highlighted the similarities to Dawkins's concept.|$|E
5|$|Although Purkinje {{fibers and}} {{the bundle of}} His were {{discovered}} {{as early as the}} 19th century, their specific role in the electrical conduction system of the heart remained unknown until Sunao Tawara published his monograph, titled Das Reizleitungssystem des Säugetierherzens, in 1906. Tawara's discovery of the atrioventricular node prompted Arthur Keith and Martin Flack to look <b>for</b> <b>similar</b> structures in the heart, leading to their discovery of the sinoatrial node several months later. These structures form the anatomical basis of the electrocardiogram, whose inventor, Willem Einthoven, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology in 1924.|$|E

5|$|Although {{no longer}} {{employed}} by the New Zealand Company, Heaphy, emboldened {{by the success of}} his report and the public reception to his paintings, sought further opportunities <b>for</b> <b>similar</b> work. From London, he wrote to the company secretary seeking support for exploration of the area inland of Nelson. The response was unenthusiastic, the company was concentrating on developing its settlements, rather than undertaking in further exploration of the country. Despite this, Heaphy returned to New Zealand and arrived in Nelson on 22 December 1842.|$|E
5|$|Chief of Section D Ros Myers (Hermione Norris) {{introduces}} Lucas North (Richard Armitage) {{to one of}} Adam Carter's assets, Pakistani {{intelligence officer}} Marlin (Emilio Doorgasingh). Marlin has information about a planned attack by Al-Qaeda; a cell intends to create Internet chatter, followed by a dry run, after which they will commence a series of suicide attacks. The ringleader behind this is Nadif Abdelrashid (Ariyon Bakare) who was previously responsible <b>for</b> <b>similar</b> attacks in Turkey and Somalia. Ben Kaplan is in his first undercover operation disguised as a recent convert to Islam and {{becomes part of the}} cell. As part of his cover, Ben shares a flat with Jawad (Tariq Jordan), another member. However, {{over the course of the}} operation Ben becomes close to Jawad, which Ben's handler Lucas advises against, as Jawad is not an innocent.|$|E
5|$|Christian baptisteries and shrines were domed in the 4th century, {{such as the}} Lateran Baptistery and {{the likely}} wooden dome over the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.

The first domed basilica may have been built in the 5th century, with a church in southern Turkey being the earliest proposed example, but the 6th century architecture of Justinian made domed church architecture standard throughout the Roman east. His Hagia Sophia and Church of the Holy Apostles inspired copies in later centuries.|$|E

5|$|Demand for {{grinding}} {{machinery and}} specialist {{knowledge in the}} heat treatment of metals and other areas the company had developed was so high {{during the years of}} World War I that the government ordered other British manufacturers to produce Churchill designs. One specialist area was heat-treated blades used to cut the cables of sea mines. In April 1916 an increase in share capital to expand the factory further was authorised. During the war years the company was misled by a trade union such that it paid its male fitters, who were supervising female war workers, an increased wage of 48 shillings per week. The union told the company it was the rate paid <b>for</b> <b>similar</b> work at Armstrong Whitworth, when it was not.|$|E
5|$|Fans' {{behaviour}} {{at international}} games {{has led to}} various sanctions against the national team. Croatia was penalized and threatened with expulsion from UEFA for reports of racist behaviour by travelling fans at Euro 2004. UEFA and FIFA have both penalized the Croatian Football Federation (HNS) <b>for</b> <b>similar</b> incidents in the past. During a friendly match against Italy in Livorno, {{a small group of}} Croatia fans formed the shape of a swastika. Croatian fans were also heavily scrutinized for racist behavior against Turkey in 2008, as well as an incident of racial abuse towards English striker Emile Heskey in 2010. During the 2006 World Cup a Croatian fan evaded security at a German venue and approached Croatian players on the field; he was arrested and banned for trespassing. There were also reports of violent clashes between Croatian and Turkish supporters at Euro 2008, as well as improper conduct by Croatia fans at Euro 2012 and the 2014 World Cup.|$|E

The story is divided into chapters, which are in turn divided between two generations of characters. In between missions, the player units settle in a home base, where various actions such as forging new weapons, buying items, and triggering Support conversations between different characters.

5|$|Flood waters {{from the}} Murchison River {{finally began to}} recede on 17 March; however, it took several weeks for the river to return to its normal level. Although Emma had only minor effects in Carnarvon, the town enacted a A$14million ($10million USD) flood {{protection}} plan {{in the wake of}} the storm. The plan would lead to the construction of new levees in areas surrounding the town and keep flood waters within Nicol Bay Flats. Additionally, four sections of the North West Coastal Highway were set to be upgraded <b>for</b> <b>similar</b> reasons. Due to the combined effects of Cyclones Clare, Darryl, Jim, Emma, Kate and Glenda, gold production in Australia fell by 8 percent, resulting in earnings losses of A$130million.|$|E

A portion of the {{citizens}} of the city, demoralized and hungry, decided to surrender the city to Alcibiades <b>for</b> <b>similar</b> terms as the Selymbrians had received. On the designated night the defenders left their posts, and the Athenians attacked the Peloponnesian garrison in the city and their boats in the harbor. The portion of the citizenry that remained loyal to the Peloponnesians fought so savagely that Alcibiades issued a statement {{in the midst of the}} fighting which guaranteed their safety and this persuaded the remaining citizens to turn against the Peloponnesian garrison, which was nearly totally destroyed.|$|E
