5|$|The Houston Astros chose Nevin {{with the}} first overall pick in the 1992 Major League Baseball draft. Hal Newhouser, a scout for the Astros, had {{evaluated}} Derek <b>Jeter</b> extensively prior to the draft. Convinced that <b>Jeter</b> would anchor a winning team, Newhouser lobbied team management to select <b>Jeter,</b> and quit in protest over the Astros' decision to take Nevin instead. The Astros believed that <b>Jeter</b> would insist on a salary bonus of at least $1million to forgo his college scholarship for a professional contract. Signing bonuses given to {{the best player in}} the draft were increasing rapidly. Todd Van Poppel, regarded by many at the time the first pick of the 1990 MLB draft, signed for $1.2 million, while the 1991 MLB draft's first pick, Brien Taylor, signed for $1.55 million after insisting he would otherwise enroll in college. Meanwhile, the Astros were unable to sign their first-round draft pick in 1991, John Burke, who insisted on a bonus of $500,000 as the sixth overall selection. Consequently, the Astros passed on <b>Jeter</b> in the draft.|$|E

5|$|As a scout for the Houston Astros, Hal Newhouser {{evaluated}} <b>Jeter</b> extensively {{before the}} 1992 MLB draft.

Newhouser felt so strongly about Jeter's potential that he quit his job with the Astros in protest after they ignored his drafting advice.|$|E
