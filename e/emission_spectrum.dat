5|$|Supernova {{searches}} {{fall into}} two classes: those focused on relatively nearby events and those looking farther away. Because of {{the expansion of the}} universe, the distance to a remote object with a known <b>emission</b> <b>spectrum</b> can be estimated by measuring its Doppler shift (or redshift); on average, more-distant objects recede with greater velocity than those nearby, and so have a higher redshift. Thus the search is split between high redshift and low redshift, with the boundary falling around a redshift range of z=0.1–0.3—where z is a dimensionless measure of the spectrum's frequency shift.|$|E
5|$|In 1863, the German chemists Ferdinand Reich and Hieronymous Theodor Richter were testing ores {{from the}} mines around Freiberg, Saxony. They {{dissolved}} the minerals pyrite, arsenopyrite, galena and sphalerite in hydrochloric acid and distilled raw zinc chloride. Reich, who was color-blind, employed Richter {{as an assistant}} for detecting the colored spectral lines. Knowing that ores from that region sometimes contain thallium, they searched for the green thallium <b>emission</b> <b>spectrum</b> lines. Instead, they found a bright blue line. Because that blue line did not match any known element, they hypothesized a new element was present in the minerals. They named the element indium, from the indigo color seen in its spectrum, after the Latin indicum, meaning 'of India'.|$|E

5|$|The second {{first became}} {{a de facto}} base unit within the metric system when, in 1832, Carl Friedrich Gauss used it, the {{centimetre}} and the gram to derive the units associated with values of absolute measurements of the Earth's magnetic field. The second, if based on the Earth's rotation, is not a constant as the Earth's rotation is slowing down—in 2008 the solar day was 0.002s longer than in 1820. This had been known for many years; consequently in 1952 the International Astronomical Union (IAU) defined the second {{in terms of the}} Earth's rotation in the year 1900. Measurements of time were made using extrapolation from readings based on astronomy. With the launch of SI in 1960, the 11th CGPM adopted the IAU definition. In the years that followed, atomic clocks became significantly more reliable and precise; and in 1968 the 13th CGPM redefined the second in terms of a specific frequency from the <b>emission</b> <b>spectrum</b> of the caesium 133 atom, a component of atomic clocks. This provided the means to measure the time associated with astronomical phenomena rather than using astronomical phenomena as the basis from which time measurements were made.|$|E

40|$|Light {{emitting}} diodes (LEDs) {{consisting of}} p-GaN epitaxial films and n-ZnO nanorods have been fabricated and characterized. The rectifying behavior and <b>emission</b> <b>spectra</b> were strongly {{dependent on the}} electronic properties of both GaN film and ZnO nanorods. Light emission under both forward and reverse bias was obtained in all cases, and <b>emission</b> <b>spectra</b> could be changed by annealing the ZnO nanorods. The <b>emission</b> <b>spectra</b> could be further tuned by using a GaN LED epiwafer as a substrate. Both forward and backward diode behavior has been observed and the <b>emission</b> <b>spectra</b> were significantly affected by both {{the properties of the}} GaN substrate and the annealing conditions for the ZnO nanorods. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Corrected {{steady-state}} fluorescence <b>emission</b> <b>spectra</b> {{of various}} mechanical pulps and celluloses were measured using an excitation wavelength of 320 nm. Regardless of its source, cellulose displayed {{a relatively high}} characteristic <b>emission.</b> The <b>emission</b> <b>spectra</b> of mechanical pulps were red-shifted with respect to that of cellulose, and peak shapes were influenced by the pulping process, by hydrogen peroxide bleaching and by monochromatic UV irradiation of the sheets. Changes in <b>emission</b> <b>spectra</b> due to bleaching or UV-irradiation occurred principally in the 370 - 440 and 500 - 550 nm regions, and were similar to changes in reflectance spectra reported in the literature. Fluorescence <b>emission</b> <b>spectra</b> of commercial lignins and lignin model compounds were blue-shifted with respect to mechanical pulps, even upon absorption of the fluorophores on solid substrates. Concentration and inner filter effects were evident in <b>emission</b> <b>spectra</b> of commercial lignins, at concentrations as low as 60 ppm. These results suggest that, to a first approximation, <b>emission</b> <b>spectra</b> of mechanical pulps may {{be interpreted as a}} decrease in emission of cellulose caused by light absorption by lignin; changes due to bleaching and irradiation may be attributed to changes in lignin absorption...|$|R

25|$|Because a {{beta decay}} is {{accompanied}} by the emission of a neutrino that also carries a varying amount of energy away, the beta <b>emission</b> <b>spectrum</b> does not have sharp lines, but instead is broad.

25|$|A further {{disadvantage}} is {{that the}} gas envelope around certain types of stars can expand and contract, and some stars are variable. This method is unsuitable for finding planets around these types of stars, as changes in the stellar <b>emission</b> <b>spectrum</b> caused by the intrinsic variability of the star can swamp the small effect caused by a planet.|$|E

40|$|High-quality, melt-grown ZnO {{crystals}} are reported. The {{reflection and}} <b>emission</b> <b>spectra</b> of the melt-grown samples are {{compared with the}} same spectra from high-quality, vapor-grown ZnO crystals. We isolate the reflection and <b>emission</b> <b>spectra</b> predominantly related to the intrinsic properties associated with the wurtzite structure of the crystals. The quality of the crystals is reflected in the spectral reproduction of the intrinsic properties of the crystals. Both the ground state and the n= 2 state of the free excitons associated with the A, B, and C valence bands of the crystals are spectrally observed in reflection. Assuming a hydrogenic character for the free excitons, the binding energy of these excitons associated with all three valence bands was determined. For the intrinsic <b>emission</b> <b>spectra,</b> attention was focused on the A-band free excitons and related optical parameters. Both the reflection and <b>emission</b> <b>spectra</b> for the melt-grown material compared very closely with the same spectra observed from high-quality vapor-grown ZnO samples.

40|$|The DV-Xa {{molecular}} orbital (MO) calculation method {{was applied to}} the B K–V x-ray <b>emission</b> <b>spectra</b> of hexagonal (h-), cubic (c-) and wurtzite (w-) type boron nitrides (BN). The calculated B 2 p density of states (DOS) was in good agreement with the B K–V x-ray emission. The main peaks and low-energy satellite peaks in the B K–V x-ray <b>emission</b> <b>spectra</b> are due to the B 2 p and the B 2 p hybridized with N 2 s, respectively. The high-energy satellite peak in the B K–V x-ray <b>emission</b> <b>spectra</b> clearly corresponds to the p sub-band of the B 2 p DOS in h-BN. However, the high-energy satellite peak observed in w-BN is not in agreement with the B 2 p DOS. It is considered that the high-energy satellite peaks are due to less than four-coordinated B atoms such as have dangling bonds and defects in w-BN. In the B K–V x-ray <b>emission</b> <b>spectra</b> of h-BN, the synthesizing p and s sub-bands of B 2 p DOS could explain the polarized <b>emission</b> <b>spectra</b> very well.

25|$|Emission {{indicates}} that radiative energy is {{released by the}} material. A material's blackbody spectrum is a spontaneous <b>emission</b> <b>spectrum</b> determined by its temperature; this feature {{can be measured in}} the infrared by instruments such as the Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer (AERI). Emission can also be induced by other sources of energy such as flames or sparks or electromagnetic radiation in the case of fluorescence.|$|E

In addition to spectral discrimination, the CCMs can include trajectory discrimination and detection of size of the radiation source.|$|E

25|$|For many fluorophores the {{absorption}} spectrum is {{a mirror image}} of the <b>emission</b> <b>spectrum.</b> This is known as the mirror image rule and is related to the Franck–Condon principle which states that electronic transitions are vertical, that is energy changes without distance changing as can be represented with a vertical line in Jablonski diagram. This means the nucleus does not move and the vibration levels of the excited state resemble the vibration levels of the ground state.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 1864, William Huggins {{examined}} the spectra of about 70 nebulae. He found that roughly {{a third of}} them had the <b>emission</b> <b>spectrum</b> of a gas. The rest showed a continuous spectrum and thus were thought to consist of a mass of stars. A third category was added in 1912 when Vesto Slipher showed that the spectrum of the nebula that surrounded the star Merope matched the spectra of the Pleiades open cluster. Thus the nebula radiates by reflected star light.|$|E
25|$|Slipher and Edwin Hubble {{continued}} {{to collect the}} spectra from many diffuse nebulae, finding 29 that showed emission spectra and 33 that had the continuous spectra of star light. In 1922, Hubble announced that nearly all nebulae are associated with stars, and their illumination comes from star light. He also discovered that the <b>emission</b> <b>spectrum</b> nebulae are nearly always associated with stars having spectral classifications of B1 or hotter (including all O-type main sequence stars), while nebulae with continuous spectra appear with cooler stars. Both Hubble and Henry Norris Russell concluded that the nebulae surrounding the hotter stars are transformed in some manner.|$|E

25|$|Cathodoluminescence, the {{emission}} of light when atoms excited by high-energy electrons {{return to their}} ground state, is analogous to UV-induced fluorescence, and some materials such as zinc sulfide and some fluorescent dyes, exhibit both phenomena. Over the last decades, cathodoluminescence was most commonly experienced as the light emission from the inner surface of the cathode ray tube in television sets and computer CRT monitors. In the SEM, CL detectors either collect all light emitted by the specimen or can analyse the wavelengths emitted by the specimen and display an <b>emission</b> <b>spectrum</b> or {{an image of the}} distribution of cathodoluminescence emitted by the specimen in real color.|$|E
25|$|Characteristic X-ray {{emission}} (X-ray fluorescence): If {{the electron}} has enough energy it can knock an orbital electron {{out of the}} inner electron shell of a metal atom, {{and as a result}} electrons from higher energy levels then fill up the vacancy and X-ray photons are emitted. This process produces an <b>emission</b> <b>spectrum</b> of X-rays at a few discrete frequencies, sometimes referred to as the spectral lines. The spectral lines generated depend on the target (anode) element used and thus are called characteristic lines. Usually these are transitions from upper shells into K shell (called K lines), into L shell (called L lines) and so on.|$|E
25|$|The {{transfer}} characteristic of RO is usually represented as the electrical {{resistance of the}} photoresistor {{as a function of}} the current through the light source; it is a convolution of three main factors: the dependence of light source intensity on its current, optical coupling and spectral matching between the light source and photoresistor, and the photoresponse of the photoresistor. The first dependence is almost linear and temperature independent for LEDs in the practical range of the controlling current. On the contrary, for incandescent lamps the light-current curve is not linear, and the <b>emission</b> <b>spectrum</b> varies with temperature, and thus with the input current. As to the light detector, its properties depend on temperature, voltage and the history of utilization (memory effect). Therefore, the {{transfer characteristic}} takes a range of values.|$|E
