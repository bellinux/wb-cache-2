The system distinguished between system cartridges, which contained the monitor and utilities along with user data, and nonsystem cartridges, which contained user data only. A system cartridge contained the cartridge id and the cold-start program (bootstrap code) in sector 0 followed by a communications area and the resident monitor in sectors one and two. Sectors three through five contained the System Location Equivalence Table (SLET) - a directory of all phases of all monitor programs. Other control information filled out the first track.|$|E
40|$|The {{rotating}} cylinder electrode (RCE) configuration {{is one of}} the most used electrochemical configurations for turbulent flow regimes. For laminar regimes, it appears problematic to choose the adapted predictive correlation for limiting current density. This is essentially due to the difficulty of choosing the characteristic length and dimensionless number (Reynolds, Taylor, [...] .) in this geometrical configuration, mainly due to its two-dimensional character, whereas the rotating <b>disk</b> <b>cylinder</b> is well approximated with the monodimensional assumption. This two-dimensional character makes inaccurate the use of mean correlations because factors like electrode position and length are usually not correlated. The present work shows that in the case of the RCE configuration, the computational fluid dynamic calculation appears to be an adapted tool to access to the electrode vicinity hydrodynamic and mass-transport properties. A design methodology has been used to correlate laminar fluid flow properties with classical factors: kinetic viscosity, rotation velocity, and inner electrode diameter. The flow properties are correlated and lead to the mean wall shear stress at the electrode and then to the average current density at the electrode, which are original correlations under diffusion-limited assumptions. The present work uses published empirical correlations as experimental validation data...|$|E

40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU CommunityThe problem treated in this dissertation is {{the behavior of a}} projectile as it passes from air into water. The behavior of the water during the establishment of the flow and the development of the cavity is a transient phenomenon. A description of the behavior of the fluid during the entry of a body requires a knowledge of pressures, sizes and shares as functions of time. An extensive experimental program has been conducted in order to determine these functions. The surface pressures, axial body accelerations and fluid surface motions have been studied during the vertical entry of light conical bodies of 45 -, 90 - and 140 -degree total angle. Also, the axial accelerations and surface motions have been studied during the oblique entry of a moderately heavy <b>disk</b> <b>cylinder.</b> All of these tests include the flow-establishment phase and the early cavity-development chase. The results of the experimental program in which the axial accelerations of light conical bodies were measured indicate that a single drag-coefficient function exists for each shape, and that the actual acceleration of the body may be calculated from this function by the application of the princioles of elementry mechanics. This standardized drag-coefficient function has been determined {{for each of the three}} cone angles. Motion of the water surface has been studied during entry. The maximum advance of spray or surface has been measured for the oblique entry of cylinders. A dimensionless surface shape has been determined for each cone tested; it is shown to remain geometrically similar during moderate accelerations to within the accuracy of the experiment. The results of the experimental program in which the pressure distribution on conical bodies was measured include: A dimensionless pressure profile for the constant-velocity entry of each cone angle studied; the variation in pressure profile resulting from model mass; and the pressure distribution on the body during early cavity development. Analysis of the data shows that the maximum pressure coefficient depends only upon cone angle, and not upon entry velocity or model mass. During entry, the major increase in pressure coefficient over the steady-state value is shown to exist near the free surface, while pressure changes due to deceleration are shown to occur at deeper locations. The axial accelerations measured during the oblique entry of disk cylinders show that the drag coefficient is independent of velocity. Interpretation of the experimental results shows that the penetration ratio is independent of entry angle. The values of added mass and penetration ratio for the vertical entry of a <b>disk</b> <b>cylinder</b> are determined as limit values of the oblique entry of disk cylinders and the vertical entry of cones. A single function is shown to reoresent the drag coefficient-versus-distance function for the oblique entry of disk cylinders...|$|E
40|$|A new {{multimedia}} disk scheduling algorithm, termed Cascaded-SFC, is presented. The Cascaded-SFC multime-dia disk scheduler {{is applicable}} in environments where mul-timedia data requests arrive with different {{quality of service}} (QoS) requirements such as real-time deadline and user pri-ority. Previous work on disk scheduling has focused on op-timizing the seek times and/or meeting the real-time dead-lines. The Cascaded-SFC disk scheduler provides a uni-fied framework for multimedia disk scheduling that scales {{with the number of}} scheduling parameters. The general idea is based on modeling the multimedia disk requests as points in multiple multi-dimensional sub-spaces, where each of the dimensions represents one of the parameters (e. g., one dimension represents the request deadline, an-other represents the <b>disk</b> <b>cylinder</b> number, and a third di-mension represents the priority of the request, etc.). Each multi-dimensional sub-space represents a subset of the QoS parameters that share some common scheduling character-istics. Then the multimedia disk scheduling problem re-duces to the problem of finding a linear order to traverse the multi-dimensional points in each sub-space. Multiple space-filling curves are selected to fit the scheduling needs of the QoS parameters in each sub-space. The orders in each sub-space are integrated in a cascaded way to pro-vide a total order for the whole space. Comprehensive ex-periments demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the Cascaded-SFC disk scheduling algorithm over other disk schedulers. 1...|$|E
40|$|A new {{quality of}} service (QoS) aware disk {{scheduling}} algorithm is presented. It is applicable in environments where data requests arrive with different QoS requirements such as real-time deadline, and user priority. Previous work on disk scheduling has focused on optimizing the seek times and/or meeting the real-time deadlines. A unified framework for QoS disk scheduling is presented that scales {{with the number of}} scheduling parameters.

Then the disk scheduling problem reduces to the problem of finding a linear order to traverse these multi-dimensional points. Space-filling curves are adopted to define a linear order for sorting and scheduling objects that lie in the multi-dimensional space. This generalizes the one-dimensional disk scheduling algorithms (e. g., EDF, SATF, FIFO). Several techniques are presented to show how a QoS-aware disk scheduler deals with the progressive arrival of requests over time. Simulation experiments are presented to show a comparison of the alternative techniques and to demonstrate the scalability of the proposed QoSaware disk scheduling algorithm over other traditional approaches. 1...|$|E

To speed up the copy detection, RIME uses a new clustering/hashing approach that first clusters similar images on adjacent <b>disk</b> <b>cylinders</b> and then builds indexes to access the clusters made in this way. Searching for the replicas of an image often takes just one IO to look up the location of the cluster containing similar objects and one sequential file IO to read in this cluster.

In this note five axioms (A 1) -(A 5) for f are introduced. It is shown that if f satisfies them, then one is able to describe the homotopy types of the connected components of the stabilizers and orbits of f {{with respect to the}} right and left-right actions of diffeomorphism groups. In fact, the proof follows the line of the author’s paper concerning Morse functions. The essentially new result of the paper allows to reduce calculation of the fundamental group of the orbit of f to consider the connected components of stabilizers of functions defined on <b>disks,</b> <b>cylinders</b> and Mobius bands only.

40|$|In this study, we {{demonstrated}} that a thin aluminium disk {{can be used}} as nozzle to electrospin PVA nanofibres on a large-scale. A schematic of this electrospinning system and a SEM image of as-spun PVA nanofibers are shown in Figure 1. The lower part of the disk is inside a bath containing the polymer solution, which is connected to a high voltage powder supply. During electrospinning, the disk rotates and picks up a thin layer of electrically charged PVA solution. A large number of fibres are then electrospun simultaneously from two sides of tile disk and deposited on the electrode collector. With the small prototype unit we used, the fibre production rate can be as high as 6. 0 which is about 270 times higher than that of a corresponding normal needle electrospinning system (0. 022 g/hr). The effects of appliedb voltage, the distance between the disk nozzle and collector, and PVA concentration on the fibre morphology were examined. The dependency of fibre diameter on the PVA concentration showed a similar trend to that for a conventional electrospinning system using a syringe needle nozzle, but the diameter distribution was wider for the disk electrospun fibres in this study. The profiles of electric field strength in disk electrospinning showed considerable dependence on the disk thickness, with a thin disk exhibiting similar electric field profile to that of a needle electrospinning system, but a thick <b>disk</b> (<b>cylinder)</b> exhibiting levelled electric field between the disk and the collector. PVA nanofibres electrospun from disk electrospinning were compared to that electrospun from syringe needle and metal cylinder nozzles...|$|E
40|$|A subtle {{relation}} between Quantum Hall physics and {{the phenomenon of}} pairing is unveiled. By use of second quantization, we establish a connection between (i) a broad class of rotationally symmetric two-body interactions within the lowest Landau level and (ii) integrable hyperbolic Richardson-Gaudin type Hamiltonians that arise in (p_{x}+ip_{y}) superconductivity. Specifically, we show that general Haldane pseudopotentials (and their sums) can be expressed as a sum of repulsive non-commuting (p_{x}+ip_{y}) -type pairing Hamiltonians. For the Laughlin sequence, {{it is observed that}} this problem is frustration free and zero energy ground states lie in the common null space of all of these non-commuting Hamiltonians. This property allows for the use of a new truncated basis of pairing configurations in which to express Laughlin states at general filling factors. We prove separability of arbitrary Haldane pseudopotentials, providing explicit expressions for their second quantized forms, and further show by explicit construction how to exploit the topological equivalence between different geometries (<b>disk,</b> <b>cylinder,</b> and sphere) sharing the same topological genus number, in the second quantized formalism, through similarity transformations. As an application of the second quantized approach, we establish a "squeezing principle" that applies to the zero modes of a general class of Hamiltonians, which includes but is not limited to Haldane pseudopotentials. We also show how one may establish (bounds on) "incompressible filling factors" for those Hamiltonians. By invoking properties of symmetric polynomials, we provide explicit second quantized quasi-hole generators; the generators that we find directly relate to bosonic chiral edge modes and further make aspects of dimensional reduction in the Quantum Hall systems precise.

Quantitative data {{shows that the}} ratio of total chloroplast area to mesophyll cell area is constant across different cells within a single species, and also across species. Wild-type chloroplasts exhibit little scatter around this trend; highly irregularly-shaped mutant chloroplasts exhibit more scatter. Here we propose a model motivated by a bacterial quorum-sensing model consisting of a switch-like signalling network that turns off chloroplast growth. We calculated the dependence of {{the location of the}} relevant saddle-node bifurcation on the geometry of the chloroplasts. Our model exhibits a linear trend, with linearly growing scatter dependent on chloroplast shape, consistent with the data.

40|$|The {{solution}} of the classic problem of stress in a rotating elastic <b>disk</b> or <b>cylinder,</b> as solved in standard texts on elasticity theory, has two features: dynamical equations are used that are valid only in an inertial frame of reference, and quadratic terms are dropped in displacement gradient {{in the definition of}} the strain.

I provide an alternate formulation of the problem by transforming the dynamical equations to a corotating frame of reference of the disk/cylinder, where dropping the quadratic terms in displacement gradient is justified. The analysis shows that the classic textbook derivation of stress and strain must be interpreted as being carried out in the corotating frame of the medium. Comment: 13 pages.

The nanotubes consist of stacked, porous crystalline rings, and are held together primarily by side-chain van der Waals interactions. The peptoid nanotubes form without a central hydrophobic core, chirality, a hydrogen bond network, and electrostatic or π-π interactions.
