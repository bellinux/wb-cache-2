Antibiotics are often given if deemed appropriate based on the presumed underlying cause and the horse's CBC results. Therapy to help prevent endotoxemia and improve blood protein levels (plasma or synthetic colloid administration) may also be used if budgetary constraints allow. Other therapies include probiotics and anti-inflammatory medication. Horses that are not <b>eating</b> <b>well</b> may also require parenteral nutrition. Horses usually require 3–6 days of treatment before clinical signs improve.|$|E

2500|$|Aged around 18, {{he made a}} {{philosophical}} discovery that opened up to him [...] "a new Scene of Thought", which inspired him [...] "to throw up every other Pleasure or Business to apply entirely to it". He did not recount what this scene was, and commentators have offered a variety of speculations. One popular interpretation, prominent in contemporary Hume scholarship, {{is that the new}} [...] "scene of thought" [...] was Hume's realization that Francis Hutcheson's [...] "moral sense" [...] theory of morality could be applied to the understanding as well. Due to this inspiration, Hume set out to spend a minimum of ten years reading and writing. He soon came to the verge of a mental breakdown, suffering from what a doctor diagnosed as the [...] "Disease of the Learned". Hume wrote that it started with a coldness, which he attributed to a [...] "Laziness of Temper", that lasted about nine months. Later, some scurvy spots broke out on his fingers. This was what persuaded Hume's physician to make his diagnosis. Hume wrote that he [...] "went under a Course of Bitters and Anti-Hysteric Pills", taken along with a pint of claret every day. Hume also decided to have a more active life to better continue his learning. His health improved somewhat, but, in 1731, he was afflicted with a ravenous appetite and palpitations of the heart. After <b>eating</b> <b>well</b> for a time, he went from being [...] "tall, lean and raw-bon'd" [...] to being [...] "sturdy, robust [...] healthful-like". Indeed, Hume would become well known in his time for his [...] "corpulence", and his fondness for good port and cheese.|$|E
