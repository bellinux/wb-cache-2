The failure {{domain of the}} entire structural system is computed through the union of failure regions for various critical system failure modes. The effect of non-critical progressive damage is incorporated through structural reanalysis, resulting {{in the construction of}} several linear segments to approximately cover the system failure domain. An adaptive damage <b>imposition</b> <b>scheme</b> is outlined for the sake of computational efficiency. The proposed method is used to construct the system survival cdf (cumulative distribution function) of a two-rotor system...|$|E

50|$|In {{the summer}} of 1642 these {{national}} troubles helped to polarise opinion, ending indecision about which side to support or what action to take. Opposition to Charles also arose owing to many local grievances. For example, the <b>imposition</b> of drainage <b>schemes</b> in The Fens negatively affected the livelihood {{of thousands of people}} after the King awarded a number of drainage contracts. Many regarded the King as indifferent to public welfare, and this played a role in bringing a large part of eastern England into the Parliamentarian camp. This sentiment brought with it people such as the Earl of Manchester and Oliver Cromwell, each a notable wartime adversary of the King. Conversely, one of the leading drainage contractors, the Earl of Lindsey, was to die fighting for the King at the Battle of Edgehill.|$|R

The Environment Agency also hosts the CRC Registry where participants can register details and trade their emissions. It is also responsible for administering any sanctions for non-compliance. This {{is a classic example of}} the government using the skills of, in this case, a non-governmental public body in order to administer a policy they have established. Again, it is not an example of the power to govern being taken away from central government as the “enactment of legislation is evident as an explicit assertion of hierarchy”. It is the government who has delegated this responsibility to The Environment Agency, and they remain the ultimate statutory authority for the scheme.|$|R

In general, animal health status {{does not appear to be}} consistently better on organic than on conventional farms. This raises questions on the impacts of management and systems changes. Obviously, organic guidelines play a minor role with respect to the status of animal health, whereas differences in management practices and control tools within the farm system are expected be the main cause for substantial variation in the prevalence rates of diseases between farms. Any improvements in relation to animal health should be based on the implementation of monitoring systems including clinical assessments, abattoir data and review of treatment data, as well as health planning strategies taking into account feedback mechanisms. The latter, however, require clear guidelines concerning the level of production diseases expected as the output of the farm system. Currently, there is no common agreement about a threshold acceptable for organic livestock farming or about categories that allow to group different animal health levels in a range between very good and worse. Consequently, there is a need for a change in the paradigm from standard and resource oriented to a result and outcome oriented approach. Producers failing to meet certain health standards in the longer term should face consequences, such as <b>imposition</b> of improvements <b>schemes</b> and loss of product certification...|$|R
40|$|The work {{refers to}} the field of {{topology}} optimization for bidimensional structures and addresses the case in which global stress–constraints are considered to improve final designs. Most of the previous research tackles this topic relying on classical displacement–based finite elements where stresses are recovered via post–processing techniques. The work conversely investigates the use of a truly–mixed formulation where stresses are independent variables of the problem while displacements play the secondary role of Lagrangian multiplier. The implemented discretization is based on a composite triangular element whose features may be advantageously exploited in stress–constrained topology optimization. The discretization is checkerboard–free and allows to tackle topology optimization with element–based constraints without introducing any additional filtering technique. The high accuracy in the evaluation of the average stresses is expected to improve the efficiency of the numerical procedure, {{especially in the case of}} a single global constraint that has to govern the whole domain. The adopted discretization also passes the robustness condition even in the case of incompressible materials and this allows to menage strength constraints also for rubber–like components. Basing on these ideas, numerical investigations are carried out to test preliminary applications of the truly–mixed technique coupled with topology optimization and global stress–constraints. To handle the well–known singularity problem, that affects the constraints <b>imposition,</b> an alternative <b>scheme</b> is herein adopted instead of a classical "–relaxation. An example where a homogenous stress distribution is expected is firstly tested, having the aim of pointing out the main features of the proposed procedure. Afterwards, numerical simulations address a classical L–shaped specimen, pointing out pros and cons of the approach...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates two questions: One, {{how does}} a conquering state govern a foreign territory and its inhabitants from afar? Two, why was nineteenth century British colonialism marked by the authoritarian, illiberal rule of racially diverse colonies? To answer these questions, I examine the institutionalization of Crown Colony government, which was the standardized mode of colonial rule and long-distance imperial control {{in the nineteenth century}} British Empire. Defined by the Crown’s authority over colonial legislation and official appointments, the institutional framework of Crown Colony government was also a monocratic form of colonial rule that granted the Governor, as the Crown’s representative, powers over the colonial legislature and judiciary. To examine the processes of institutionalization, this study focuses on the paradigmatic cases of Jamaica and the Straits Settlements (Singapore, Penang and Malacca) because their re-constitution as Crown Colonies in the 1860 s marked the shift in imperial policy away from the use of the old representative system, which had been defined by the establishment of representative Assemblies. By examining the translation of colonial laws across the empire, I argue that Crown Colony government differed from English institutions of law and government because of officials’ concerns over the use of English “liberties” in racially divided societies. Because both officials and elites came to understand such “plural societies” as lacking in social or cultural cohesion and also being unfit to assimilate English liberties, they then contended that such colonies required the expansive powers of the colonial state to maintain the semblance of lawfulness and order. As I demonstrate, British officials thus formulated a racial sociology of empire that was realized in their gradual <b>imposition</b> of a <b>scheme</b> of constitutional progression upon a diverse range of colonies – this was a formalized scheme of colonial rule that rendered the seemingly “backward” and “less civilized” members of plural and traditional societies as less capable of “liberty” and “self-government” and more in need of the Crown’s protection. In light of its findings, this dissertation proposes that sociologists need to analyze the changing structures of sovereignty in order to grasp the transformations of law in colonial and post-colonial states...|$|R
40|$|National and {{intergovernmental}} {{regulation of}} fisheries has not prevented many failures of fisheries management around the world. New approaches {{to improving the}} environmental sustainability of fisheries have included the certification of fisheries harvested by sustainable means, and the ecolabelling of fish and seafood products from certified fisheries. The intention {{is to use the}} power of markets as an incentive to induce more sustainable fisheries. To date, only {{a relatively small number of}} fisheries have been certified, and these have been predominantly in developed countries. Critiques from developing countries of ecolabelling, as currently formulated, focus on five general areas: a) legitimacy and credibility; b) a mismatch between certification requirements and the reality of tropical small-scale fisheries; c) potential distortions to existing practices and livelihoods; d) equity and feasibility; and e) perceived barriers to trade. This paper reviews these developing country concerns on the basis of already certified fisheries, and on experiences from forestry, aquaculture and the aquarium industry, and also examines precedents and trends in international environmental and trade issues. It suggests that ecolabelling as currently practiced is unlikely to be widely adopted in Asian countries. Certification may have sporadic success in some eco-conscious, or niche, markets but it is unlikely to stimulate global improvement of fisheries management. The paper argues that to avoid the controversy that accompanies ecolabelling, the focus should be on revision of national fisheries management and not on an ad hoc approach to individual fisheries. Improvements in fisheries management, the equitable treatment of fishing sub-sectors and stakeholders within management schemes, and the prospect of reaping increased value-added from fisheries all require government acceptance of needs and actions. Governments should be encouraged to enter into broad coalitions to improve aspects of fisheries management, and to enhance efforts to develop locally relevant indicator systems for fisheries and for the ecosystem approach. Governments of developing countries must also first address the difficult questions of access to and tenure arrangements for their fisheries, as these are essential prerequisites for successful certification and product labeling. They will also need to legislate on the form and conduct of the postharvest chain and product control, as, in export markets, these are outside the control ofthe fishing communities. International agreement and clarity on trade, environmental (and health) standards affecting fisheries will augment national efforts. Advocacy coalitions that include governments, rather than extraterritorial <b>imposition</b> of labelling <b>schemes,</b> are required...|$|R
