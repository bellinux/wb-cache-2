Several manufacturers, {{and in particular the}} Aeolian Company, had published his compositions on perforated music rolls from about 1900 onwards. His sister-in-law, Sofia Satina, remembered him at the family estate at Ivanovka, pedalling gleefully through a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>rolls</b> <b>of</b> his Second Piano Concerto, apparently acquired from a German source, most probably the Aeolian Company's Berlin subsidiary, the Choralion Company.

50|$|A {{variety of}} {{cross-section}} profiles can be produced, but each profile requires a carefully crafted <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>roll</b> tools. Design <b>of</b> the <b>rolls</b> {{starts with a}} flower pattern, which is the sequence of profile cross-sections, one profile for each stand <b>of</b> <b>rolls.</b> The roll contours are then derived from the flower pattern profiles. Because of the high cost <b>of</b> the <b>roll</b> <b>sets,</b> computer simulation {{is often used to}} develop or validate the roll designs and optimize the forming process to minimize the number of stands and material stresses in the final product.|$|R

50|$|Roll forming, also spelled rollforming, {{is a type}} {{of rolling}} {{involving}} the continuous bending of a long strip of sheet metal (typically coiled steel) into a desired cross-section. The strip passed through <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>rolls</b> mounted on consecutive stands, each set performing only an incremental part of the bend, until the desired cross-section (profile) is obtained. Roll forming is ideal for producing constant-profile parts with long lengths and in large quantities.|$|R
40|$|Rolling is {{the process}} of {{reducing}} the thickness or changing the cross-section of a long work-piece by compressive forces applied through a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>rolls.</b> Rolling accounts for about 90 % of all metals produced by metalworking processes.

Effects of {{grinding}} corn {{through a}} 2 -, 3 -, or 4 -high roller mill on milling characteristics, and finishing pig growth performance and carcass characteristics. Journal of Animal Science, 94, 59 - 59. doi: 10. 2527 /msasas 2016 - 126 Finishing pigs (n = 922, initial BW = 40. 1 kg) {{were used in}} a 97 -d experiment {{to determine the effects}} of grinding corn through various roller mill configurations on milling characteristics and growth performance and carcass characteristics of finishing pigs in a commercial setting. Pens were randomly allotted to 1 of 4 experimental treatments by initial BW with 11 pens/treatment and 21 pigs/pen. All diets were fed in 5 phases with the same corn-soybean meal-based diets containing 20 % dried distiller’s grains with solubles. Experimental treatments included corn ground to 685 µm using 2 <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>rolls</b> (2 -high), corn ground to 577 µm using 3 <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>rolls</b> (3 -high), corn ground to 360 µm using 4 <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>rolls</b> in a fine grind configuration (4 -high fine), and corn ground to 466 µm using 4 <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>rolls</b> in a coarse grind configuration (4 -high coarse). The same roller mill was used for all configurations with the appropriate lower rolls completely open when using 2 or 3 <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>rolls.</b> Grinding rate (tonnes/hour) was greatest (P < 0. 05) for the 2 -high and 4 -high coarse configurations followed by the 3 -high configuration and lowest for the 4 -high fine configuration. Electricity cost was lowest (P < 0. 05) per tonne of ground corn for the 2 -high configuration and was greatest for the 4 -high fine configuration. Pigs fed diets containing corn ground with the 2 -high configuration had the greatest (P < 0. 05) ADFI and ADG with pigs fed diets with corn ground using the 4 -high fine configuration having the poorest ADFI and ADG (2. 81, 2. 73, 2. 65, 2. 73 kg for ADFI and 0. 987, 0. 967, 0. 940, 0. 971 kg for ADG for 2 -high, 3 -high, 4 -high fine, 4 -high coarse, respectively). There were no differences in G:F, caloric efficiency, or carcass characteristics among pigs fed diets ground with the different roller mill configurations. Feed cost/kg gain was lowest (P < 0. 05) for the 4 -high coarse configuration and revenue/pig was greatest (P < 0. 05) for the 2 -high and 4 -high coarse configurations. Income over feed cost (IOFC) was lowest (P < 0. 05) for pigs fed diets with corn ground using the 4 -high fine configuration; however, there were no differences in IOFC among the other milling configurations. In our study, roller mill configuration had a significant impact on grinding electricity cost, grinding rate, as well as ADFI and ADG; however, roller mill configuration had no impact on G:F...|$|R

The hydrodynamical equations of thermal convection in Boussinesq fluids involve two types of nonlinearity. The first describes self-interaction v. ∇v of the velocity field v, and the second nonlinearity v. ∇θ results from the advection of the temperature fluctuation θ by the velocity field. The nonlinearity v. ∇θ may be neglected in the asymptotic limit of zero Prandtl number [1]. The linearly growing two-dimensional (2 D) rolls then become exact solutions of nonlinear equations, if stress-free boundary conditions are considered. This makes this limit interesting even from purely theoretical point. Thual [12] recently showed by a most general 3 D direct numerical simulation...|$|R
