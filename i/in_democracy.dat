He attended the East Brunswick Public Schools at Frost School, Hammarskjold Middle School, Churchill Junior High School, and spent his sophomore year at East Brunswick High School. Eisenberg then transferred to the High School of Performing Arts in New York. When he was a senior, he received his breakthrough role in the independent comedy-drama film Roger Dodger. His work in the film prevented Eisenberg from enrolling at New York University. Instead, Eisenberg would go on to study anthropology and contemporary architecture at The New School in Greenwich Village, where he majored in liberal arts, with a concentration <b>in</b> <b>democracy</b> and cultural pluralism.|$|E
5|$|U.S. diplomats were {{concerned}} that the move {{would be seen as}} a power grab, as Diệm was organising and driving an electoral process in which he was a candidate. The Americans felt that a legislature should be formed first and that the body should oversee the referendum, but Diệm ignored their advice. Ambassador G. Frederick Reinhardt informed Washington that Diệm had no intention of allowing a level playing field for the opposition, and that the foreign press had already made much of Diệm's democratic pronouncements being a facade. The Department of State agreed and opted to avoid trumpeting the referendum as an exercise <b>in</b> <b>democracy</b> for fear of attracting negative reactions to their foreign policy. Nevertheless, U.S. officials in Vietnam were pleased with the referendum, as they saw it as an opportunity to strengthen South Vietnam and avoid defeat to the communists, as they saw a republican model as being more robust.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{examine the}} effects that revenue windfalls from {{international}} commodity price booms have on external debt in a panel of 93 countries during the period 1970 - 2007. Our main finding is that increases in the international prices of exported commodity goods lead to {{a significant reduction in}} the level of external debt <b>in</b> <b>democracies,</b> but to no significant reduction in the level of external debt in autocracies. To explain this result, we show that in autocracies commodity windfalls lead to a statistically significant and quantitatively large increase in government expenditures. <b>In</b> <b>democracies</b> on the other hand government expenditures did not increase significantly. We also document that following commodity windfalls the risk of default on external debt decreased <b>in</b> <b>democracies,</b> but increased significantly in autocracies...|$|R

50|$|Governments with {{democracy}} attributes are {{most common in}} the Western world and in some countries of the east. <b>In</b> <b>democracies,</b> large proportions of the population may vote, either to make decisions or to choose representatives to make decisions.

25|$|In 1860, the {{conflict}} over slavery led to the split in the Democratic Party in the 1860 Convention. Hardline pro-slavery Southerners rejected Douglas, and nominated their own candidate, Vice President John C. Breckinridge, while the Northern Democrats nominated Douglas. Douglas deeply believed <b>in</b> <b>democracy,</b> arguing {{the will of the}} people should always be decisive. When civil war came in April 1861, he rallied his supporters to the Union cause with all his energies, but he died of typhoid fever a few weeks later.|$|E
25|$|In {{domestic}} policy, Maximilian {{launched a}} series of reforms at the 1495 Diet of Worms, at which the Imperial Chamber Court (Reichskammergericht) was launched as the highest court. Another new institution of 1495 was the Reichsregiment or Imperial government, meeting at Nuremberg. This preliminary exercise <b>in</b> <b>democracy</b> failed and was dissolved in 1502. Attempts at creating a unified state were not very successful, but rather re-emerged {{the idea of the}} three divisions of Austria that existed prior to the unification of Frederick and Maximilian.|$|E

40|$|Death {{and disease}} exact a heavy toll on {{citizens}} <b>in</b> <b>democracies.</b> <b>In</b> response, citizens expect elected politicians to alleviate their suffering by providing public health funding to afflicted areas. I {{argue that the}} funding of health policy <b>in</b> <b>democracies</b> is subject to distributional incentives similar to other government policies. Patterns of government control, partisanship, strategic importance and quality of legislative representation condition the provision of public health funding within countries. In turn, public health spending conditions district mortality outcomes. I examine evidence from {{turn of the century}} France, United States and modern India to test this theory. First, I consider qualitative evidence of the distribution of health funds. I then assemble administrative district level electoral, budgetary and health information and predict levels of health funding and resulting mortality rates. Political importance, not just need, plays a prominent role in determining who lives and dies <b>in</b> <b>democracies.</b> This has profound implications for the plight of modern democracies facing disease threats...|$|R
25|$|Harman {{was later}} {{involved}} in a European Court of Human Rights case against MI5. During a 1984 television interview by Cathy Massiter, it was revealed personal files were held by MI5 on Harman and on the (by then former-) General Secretary of the NCCL, Patricia Hewitt.

25|$|The {{uncertainty}} of outcomes is inherent <b>in</b> <b>democracy,</b> which makes all forces struggle repeatedly for {{the realization of}} their interests, being the devolution of power {{from a group of}} people to a set of rules. Western democracy, as distinct from that which existed in pre-modern societies, is generally considered to have originated in city states such as Classical Athens and the Roman Republic, where various schemes and degrees of enfranchisement of the free male population were observed before the form disappeared in the West at the beginning of late antiquity. The English word dates to the 16th century, from the older Middle French and Middle Latin equivalents.|$|E
25|$|The French {{writer and}} {{traveler}} Alexis de Tocqueville, <b>in</b> <b>Democracy</b> in America (1835), expressed opposition to slavery while observing {{its effects on}} American society. He felt that a multiracial society without slavery was untenable, as he believed that prejudice against blacks increased as they were granted more rights (for example, in northern states). He believed that the attitudes of white southerners, and the concentration of the black population in the south, were bringing the white and black populations {{to a state of}} equilibrium, and were a danger to both races. Because of the racial differences between master and slave, he believed that the latter could not be emancipated.|$|E

40|$|Mature democracies {{increasingly}} {{confront the}} dilemma of apathetic citizens who have become disenchanted with traditional channels of participation in democratic governance procedures. <b>In</b> representative <b>democracies</b> <b>in</b> particular, this apathy is exemplified by falling voter turnouts, party memberships and participation in community association. To counter apathy, e-governance techniques including e-voting which is a crucial process <b>in</b> <b>democracies,</b> have been deployed by varied governments <b>in</b> mature <b>democracies,</b> leveraging the pervasive power of the Internet, particularly during elections. In this paper, the significant success story of French Presidential Elections in early 2007 is narrated and examined through the historiographical lens. Specifically, the process of this election, seemingly orchestrated via the Internet, is appraised as a valid benchmarking anti-apathy approach of e-governance, to enable better citizen participation, <b>in</b> this representative <b>democracy...</b>|$|R

25|$|Peter Singer, <b>in</b> <b>Democracy</b> and Disobedience, {{argues that}} {{compulsory}} voting could negate {{the obligation of}} a voter to support {{the outcome of the}} election, since voluntary participation in elections is deemed {{to be one of the}} sources of the obligation to obey the law in a democracy. In 1996 Albert Langer was jailed for three weeks on contempt charges in relation to a constitutional challenge on a legal way not to vote for either of the major parties. Chong, Davidson and Fry, writing in the journal of the right wing think tank the CIS, argue that Australian compulsory voting is disreputable, paternalistic, disadvantages smaller political parties, and allows major parties to target marginal seats and make some savings in pork-barrelling because of this targeting. Chong et al. also argue that denial is a significant aspect of the debate about compulsory voting.|$|E
