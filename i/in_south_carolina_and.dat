5|$|As {{it moved}} northward, Jeanne {{continued}} to drop moderate to heavy rainfall, including over 7inches (175mm) in southern Georgia. A cold front {{across the region}} caused the depression to accelerate northeastward, combining moisture from the Gulf of Mexico with cool and stable air over the Carolinas. This combination produced severe thunderstorms across the region, spawning six tornadoes in Georgia, eight <b>in</b> <b>South</b> <b>Carolina,</b> <b>and</b> eight in North Carolina.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{upon the}} storm's {{formation}} on May 8, {{a tropical storm}} watch was issued for coastal locations between Edisto Beach, South Carolina, and Cape Lookout, North Carolina. Early on May8, the watch was upgraded to a tropical storm warning between {{the mouth of the}} South Santee River <b>in</b> <b>South</b> <b>Carolina,</b> <b>and</b> Surf City, North Carolina. The remainder of the watch north of Surf City was updated to a warning shortly thereafter. All tropical cyclone advisories were discontinued shortly after Ana made landfall.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{remained}} {{close to the}} United States coastline, its impact was minor. Beach erosion and light rainfall was reported along much of the coastline, although the precipitation was beneficial in ending droughts <b>in</b> <b>South</b> <b>Carolina</b> <b>and</b> New England. High waves destroyed one house in North Carolina. Damage was heaviest in New England, where several buildings were damaged and thousands were left without power. The passage of Ginny resulted in a snow storm across eastern New England, particularly in northern Maine, where it killed two people. In Atlantic Canada, the extratropical storm produced high wind and waves, causing damage to boats and resulting in power outages.|$|E
5|$|Danny {{is notable}} for its extreme rainfall, the tornadoes {{generated}} by it, {{and the destruction}} it produced on its path, causing a total of nine fatalities and $ (1997USD, $ USD) in damage. The storm dropped a record amount of rainfall for Alabama, as at least 36.71inches (932mm) fell on Dauphin Island. Flooding, power outages, and erosion occurred {{in many areas of}} the Gulf Coast, and rescues had to be executed from flooded roadways. Tornadoes generated by Danny on the East Coast caused a great amount of damage. Of the nine fatalities caused by Danny, one happened off the coast of Alabama, four occurred in Georgia, two occurred <b>in</b> <b>South</b> <b>Carolina,</b> <b>and</b> two occurred in North Carolina.|$|E

5|$|Longstreet was not {{enthusiastic}} about secession from the Union, {{but he had}} long been infused {{with the concept of}} states' rights, and felt he could not go against his homeland. Although he was born <b>in</b> <b>South</b> <b>Carolina</b> <b>and</b> reared in Georgia, he offered his services to the state of Alabama, which had appointed him to West Point and where his mother still lived. Furthermore, he was the senior West Point graduate from that state, which implied a commensurate rank in the state's forces would be available. After settling his accounts, he resigned from the U.S. Army on May 8, 1861 to cast his lot with the Confederacy in the Civil War.|$|E
5|$|While {{some small}} teeth have been found, few fossilized skeletons of manta rays have been discovered.

Only three sedimentary beds bearing manta ray fossils are known, one from the Oligocene <b>in</b> <b>South</b> <b>Carolina</b> <b>and</b> two from the Miocene and Pliocene in North Carolina. Remains of an extinct species {{have been found in}} the Chandler Bridge Formation of South Carolina. These were originally described as Manta fragilis but were later reclassified as Paramobula fragilis.|$|E
5|$|A win by McCain over Huckabee <b>in</b> <b>South</b> <b>Carolina,</b> <b>and</b> by Romney over McCain in childhood-home Michigan, set up {{a pivotal}} battle in the Florida primary.

McCain won a 5percentage point victory on January 29. Although many Republican officials were now lining up behind McCain, Romney persisted through the nationwide Super Tuesday contests on February 5. There he won primaries or caucuses in several states, but McCain won in more and in larger-population ones. Trailing McCain in delegates by a more than two-to-one margin, Romney announced {{the end of his}} campaign on February 7.|$|E

5|$|Deinosuchus {{was present}} {{on both sides}} of the Western Interior Seaway. Specimens have been {{described}} from 10 U.S. states: Utah, Montana, Wyoming, New Mexico, New Jersey, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Texas, and North Carolina. David Schwimmer has said Deinosuchus fossils have been found <b>in</b> <b>South</b> <b>Carolina</b> <b>and</b> Delaware as well, but none of them from those two states have been formally described. A Deinosuchus osteoderm from the San Carlos Formation was also reported in 2006, so the giant crocodilian's range may have included parts of northern Mexico. Deinosuchus fossils are most abundant in the Gulf Coastal Plain region of Georgia, near the Alabama border. All known specimens of Deinosuchus were found in rocks dated to the Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous period. The oldest examples of this genus lived approximately 82 Ma, and the youngest lived around 73Ma.|$|E
5|$|Guy B., born 1862, first {{worked as}} a seaman. By 1900, he was married with several {{children}} and {{worked as a}} salesman. His youngest daughter was named Antoinette. In 1850, the senior Smith's household included four older women: Lavinia Smith, age 67 (his mother: b. c.1783 - d. bet.1860-1870), born <b>in</b> <b>South</b> <b>Carolina</b> <b>and</b> listed first as head of household; Sarah Williams, 57; Amelia Jones, 47; and Mary Hewlitt, 53, who were likely relatives or friends. By then Smith and his wife Malvina had three children: James, Henry and Amy. Each member of the household was classified as mulatto (or of mixed ancestry), and all but Lavinia Smith were born in New York. They lived in a mixed neighborhood in the Fifth Ward; in the census, nearly all other neighbors on the page were classified as white; many were immigrants from England, Ireland, and France.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, he was {{inspired}} to write music again {{after the birth of}} his first child, Michael, with fellow R singer and then-girlfriend Angie Stone. He also traveled back to the South, spending time <b>in</b> <b>South</b> <b>Carolina</b> <b>and</b> in his hometown of Richmond, Virginia, while reconnecting himself with the African-American musical history that had originally inspired him. Shortly after his son's birth and the release of his first live album Live at the Jazz Cafe (1998) through EMI Records, he began preparation for the recording of songs for Voodoo. In several interviews after its release, he cited his son's birth as an inspirational source and creative muse for him. A dedication to his son Michael and daughter Imani was included in the album's liner notes, which were co-written by D'Angelo and writer/musician Saul Williams. In a press video accompanying the release of Voodoo, D'Angelo suggested that he was attempting to create a new sound for him that was in transition.|$|E

5|$|The Convention met from February 3 – December 6, 1861, {{and elected}} John Janney its {{presiding}} officer. The majority at first voted {{to remain in}} the Union, but stayed in session awaiting events. At first, the speeches were mixed between Secessionists advocating leaving the Union, Conditional Unionists holding onto the patriotism of earlier times, and Unconditional Unionists insisting that secession was bad policy and unlawful. On March 4, Abraham Lincoln’s inauguration day, Jefferson Davis called up 100,000 militia to serve a year and sent besieging troops to surround Fort Sumter <b>in</b> <b>South</b> <b>Carolina</b> <b>and</b> Fort Pickens in Florida. That same day Waitman T. Willey from trans-Alleghany Monongalia County answered secessionists with a Unionist speech. He defended Virginia's institutions from Northern attacks against slavery, but “there is no constitutional right of secession...” He warned that secession would bring about war, taxes and the abolition of slavery in Virginia.|$|E
5|$|The M249 {{light machine}} gun (LMG), {{formerly}} designated the M249 Squad Automatic Weapon (SAW) and formally written as Light Machine Gun, 5.56mm, M249, is the American adaptation of the Belgian FN Minimi, a {{light machine gun}} manufactured by the Belgian company FN Herstal (FN). The M249 is manufactured in the United States by the local subsidiary FN Manufacturing LLC <b>in</b> <b>South</b> <b>Carolina</b> <b>and</b> is widely used in the U.S. Armed Forces. The weapon was introduced in 1984 after being judged the most effective {{of a number of}} candidate weapons to address the lack of automatic firepower in small units. The M249 provides infantry squads with the high rate of fire of a machine gun combined with accuracy and portability approaching that of a rifle.|$|E
5|$|Two {{days before}} Isabel made landfall, the National Hurricane Center issued a {{hurricane}} watch from Little River, South Carolina to Chincoteague, Virginia, including the Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds {{and the lower}} Chesapeake Bay. The NHC also issued a tropical storm watch south of Little River, South Carolina {{to the mouth of}} the Santee River, as well as from Chincoteague, Virginia northward to Little Egg Inlet, New Jersey. Hurricane and tropical storm warnings were gradually issued for portions of the East Coast of the United States. By the time Isabel made landfall, a tropical storm warning existed from Chincoteague, Virginia to Fire Island, New York and from Cape Fear, North Carolina to the mouth of the Santee River <b>in</b> <b>South</b> <b>Carolina,</b> <b>and</b> a hurricane warning existed from Chincoteague, Virginia to Cape Fear. Landfall forecasts were very accurate; from three days prior, the average track forecast error for its landfall was only 36miles (58km), and for 48hours in advance the average track error was 18miles (29km).|$|E

5|$|Washington {{went into}} {{quarters}} at Morristown {{during the winter}} of 1779–1780, which represented the worst suffering for the army during the war. The temperatures fell to 16 below zero, the New York Harbor was frozen over, and snow and ice covered the ground for weeks, with the troops again lacking provisions for a time as at Valley Forge. In late 1779, Clinton moved his forces south to Charleston for an offensive against the patriots led by Benjamin Lincoln. After his success there, Clinton returned victorious to New York, leaving Cornwallis in the south. Congress replaced Lincoln with Gates, despite Washington's recommendation of Greene. Gates failed <b>in</b> <b>South</b> <b>Carolina</b> <b>and</b> was then replaced by Greene. The British at the time seemed to have the South almost in their grasp. Despite this news, Washington was encouraged to learn in mid-1780 that Lafayette had returned from France with additional naval assets and forces.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} of Hermine, multiple tropical cyclone warnings and watches were issued in the Southeastern United States, while state of emergencies were declared in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, and New Jersey. Storm surge and heavy rainfall along the Florida gulf coast caused significant damage. In Citrus County, {{one of the}} worst areas impacted, 2,694structures sustained damage, of which 531 suffered major damage, while damage reached about $102million. Similar coastal and freshwater flooding occurred in Pasco County, where 7homes were destroyed, 305sustained major damage, and 1,564received minor damage. Winds primarily left power outages and downed trees, some of which fell onto buildings and vehicles. About 325,000people were left without electricity, including 80% of Tallahassee. One death occurred in the state after a tree fell on a homeless man's tent near Ocala. Flooding and fairly strong winds in other states such as Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina caused further damage, but to a lesser degree. One fatality each occurred <b>in</b> <b>South</b> <b>Carolina</b> <b>and</b> North Carolina. In New York, two fishermen drowned near the Wading River on Long Island due to rough surf. Overall, Hermine caused about $550million (2016USD) in damage in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Only {{weeks after}} the Darlington affair, the South Carolina Supreme Court {{declared}} the act creating the dispensary system {{in violation of the}} state constitution {{on the grounds that the}} government had no right to run a profit-making business. The vote was 2–1, with Justice Samuel McGowan in the majority. McGowan was a lame duck in office; Lieutenant Governor Gary had been elected to fill his seat effective August 1, 1894. Tillman closed the dispensaries temporarily, resulting in prohibition <b>in</b> <b>South</b> <b>Carolina,</b> <b>and</b> fired the constables. He had taken the precaution, once the court agreed to take the dispensary case, of having the 1893 legislature pass a revised dispensary law. When Gary took the bench, the Tillmanites would have a majority on the state Supreme Court, and Tillman instructed trial justices not to hear challenges to the 1893 law until after August 1. Tillman kept the law suspended until then, afterwards reopening the dispensaries under that statute. The high court declared the 1893 act constitutional on October 8, 1894, 2–1, with Gary voting in the majority.|$|E
