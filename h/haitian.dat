5|$|Sailing to {{intercept}} the <b>Haitian</b> ship, Yeo discovered {{her in the}} Gulf of Léogane and ordered Gaspard to surrender. The <b>Haitian</b> refused, and the frigates exchanged shots at 06:30. The superior seamanship and discipline on Southampton prevented Gaspard from boarding the British ship with his greater numbers and within half an hour Heureuse Réunion was dismasted and battered. At 07:45 the <b>Haitian</b> ship surrendered, Yeo depositing the crew ashore and bringing Heureuse Réunion to Port Royal, Jamaica. At Jamaica, his actions were approved by his superiors and Heureuse Réunion, renamed Améthyste, was returned to Henri Christophe.|$|E
5|$|As Southampton stopped firing, the {{remaining}} masts of the <b>Haitian</b> ship fell overboard. Casualties on Heureuse Réunion were immense: of the 600–700 crew, 105 were dead and 120 wounded, the latter including Gaspard, who subsequently died of his injuries. Yeo's loss was one man killed and ten wounded, from {{a crew of}} 212. Seeking to rid himself of so many prisoners, Yeo landed most of them at Maraguana before sailing to Port au Prince, where the rest were landed and temporary jury masts were fitted to Heureuse Réunion for the journey to Jamaica. The British retained 20 prisoners for trial at Port Royal. Heureuse Réunion was repaired at Jamaica and subsequently restored to Christophe under the name Améthyste, returning to <b>Haitian</b> service. Yeo's action in attacking the <b>Haitian</b> ship, although not officially sanctioned by his commanding officer beforehand, was commended.|$|E

50|$|Economic {{restraints}} amongst <b>Haitians</b> kept education {{informal and}} contained in their small communities, as such, {{very few of}} these <b>Haitians</b> had anything above a basic level of Creole literacy. This enabled <b>Haitians</b> to keep control over the cultural values their children received.|$|R
25|$|Though, <b>Haitians</b> and Jamaicans {{are near}} even in population, Jamaicans {{represent}} {{the majority of}} West Indians in West Philadelphia, {{where most of the}} overall West Indian population lives. This is because <b>Haitians</b> are more evenly distributed throughout the city, outside of West Philadelphia, there are smaller numbers of <b>Haitians</b> in several neighborhoods in the Lower Northeast. Aside from <b>Haitians</b> and Jamaicans, there are also sizable numbers of Trinidadians and Bajans.|$|R
25|$|Most modern <b>Haitians</b> are {{descendants}} of former black African slaves, including Mulattoes who are mixed-race. The remainder are of European descent and Arab <b>Haitians,</b> the {{descendants of}} settlers (colonial remnants and contemporary immigration during WWI and WWII). <b>Haitians</b> of East Asian descent or East Indian origin number approximately 400+.|$|R

5|$|In 1928, the {{gendarmerie}} was reorganized as the Garde d'Haïti {{and became}} the nucleus of what would eventually evolve into the reconstituted <b>Haitian</b> army. The later politicization of the <b>Haitian</b> military has been attributed by some to Haiti's early experience with the Gendarmerie d'Haïti. The gendarmerie's special access to U.S. resources and influence vested in it a measure of social control within Haiti that would become institutionalized in later years. On the other hand, former <b>Haitian</b> President Prosper Avril has observed that Haiti already had {{a long tradition of}} military involvement in government prior to the occupation, with 25 of its 26 pre-occupation presidents being either military officers or leaders of rebel groups. Avrill also contends the gendarmerie worked to instill a respect for political neutrality in its men.|$|E
5|$|On January 12, 2010, Haiti {{was struck}} by a magnitude-7.0 {{earthquake}}, the country's most severe earthquake in over 200 years. The epicenter of the quake was just outside the <b>Haitian</b> capital Port-au-Prince. Over 230,000 civilians have been confirmed dead by the <b>Haitian</b> government because of the disaster and around 300,000 have been injured. Approximately 1.2 million people are homeless and {{it has been reported that}} the lack of temporary shelter may lead to the outbreak of disease.|$|E

5|$|The Action of 3 February 1812 was {{an unusual}} minor naval {{engagement}} off the western coast of Haiti between a British frigate and a frigate manned by a loose coalition of <b>Haitian</b> rebels. The battle was fought {{against the background of}} the Napoleonic Wars and the collapse of government in Haiti {{in the aftermath of the}} <b>Haitian</b> Revolution eight years earlier. After the French had been expelled from Haiti in 1804, the newly independent nation was first ruled by Jean-Jacques Dessalines, who was murdered in 1806 and replaced by two of his advisors, Henri Christophe and Alexandre Pétion. These rulers divided the country between them and in the confused political situation that followed a number of minor fiefdoms appeared, including one led by Jérôme Maximilien Borgella in the south-west of the island called Sud. The small <b>Haitian</b> Navy defected to Borgella, who crewed the vessels with a collection of sailors from various countries, led by a notorious privateer named Gaspard.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Haitian</b> {{government}} did not request international assistance, although The United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the <b>Haitian</b> Red-Cross, which were already working in Haiti, took on some supporting roles. In response to local flooding, the Jacmel Regional branch of the Red Cross distributed an additional 400 water purification tablets, 11 boxes of high-energy biscuits, and 10 boxes of body soap.|$|E
5|$|A French-aligned <b>Haitian</b> general, André Rigaud, had {{instructed}} his forces to attack all foreign shipping within their range of operations. Accordingly, once Experiment and her convoy of merchant ships neared Gonâve, the picaroons attacked them, capturing {{two of the}} American merchant ships before withdrawing. Experiment managed to save the other two ships in her convoy, and escorted them to a friendly port. On the American side, only {{the captain of the}} schooner Mary was killed. Though the picaroons took heavy losses during this engagement, they remained strong enough to continue wreaking havoc among American shipping in the region. Only after Rigaud was forced out of power by the forces of Toussaint L'Ouverture, leader of the 1791 <b>Haitian</b> Revolution, did the picaroon attacks cease.|$|E
50|$|Majority of <b>Haitians</b> are Catholic but vodou is {{also present}} behind the scenes. Vodou is {{decentralized}} and flexible. The rituals involved in vodou strengthen community ties {{and help the}} oppressed <b>Haitians</b> deal with their suffering.|$|R
50|$|It is not {{uncommon}} for <b>Haitians</b> to illegally immigrate due to the inability to secure work visa for many poor rural <b>Haitians.</b> In many ways, they face a harsher risk leaving Haiti than those who choose to stay. Those traveling into another country illegally often choose to arrive on a boat. However, the boats have been proven to be extremely dangerous and there is a large percentage of <b>Haitians</b> who die at sea in an attempt to reach their destination. There was one instance that occurred in 2000 in which a boat, carrying <b>Haitians</b> to the Turks and Caicos Islands, capsized and killed sixty people that were on board.|$|R
50|$|Many <b>Haitians</b> {{migrate to}} the Dominican Republic {{increasing}} the youth population in the school systems. There was an increase of <b>Haitians</b> in the Dominican Republic after an earthquake struck the island in 2010, killing over 200,000 people.|$|R
5|$|A {{tropical}} storm watch was issued between Santo Domingo and the Dominican Republic/Haiti border on December 4, 56hours prior to landfall. This {{was raised to}} a {{tropical storm}} warning on December 5 while 32hours before landfall. In addition, tropical storm warnings were issued {{for all of the}} <b>Haitian</b> coastline and Jamaica.|$|E
5|$|After the Gulf War, {{elements}} of the brigade were dispatched to Haiti on a humanitarian mission. The 20th Engineer Brigade was assigned to construct base camps, improve the <b>Haitian</b> infrastructure, participate in humanitarian service projects, and assist with the reestablishment of public services, with a goal of improving overall quality of life within the country.|$|E
5|$|Another USCGA {{graduate}} was Lieutenant John Gazzo Martinez, who {{was born}} in New Orleans and entered the service during World War II. He received an Academy appointment in 1946, and in 1951 was commissioned an ensign in the Coast Guard. From 1954 to 1956 LTjg. Martinez served as commanding officer at the LORAN Transmitting Station in Yonago, Japan. Martinez prepared and delivered classes in LORAN (Long Range Aids to Navigation) procedures at the U.S. Air Force 34th Bombardment Squadron which was stationed nearby. He was later assigned as advisor in the U.S. Naval Mission to the <b>Haitian</b> Garde-Cotes d'Haiti. He taught classes for the <b>Haitian</b> military leadership and later oversaw the overhaul of Garde-Cotes patrol vessels.|$|E
50|$|Jamaicans, Trinidadians and Tobagonians, and <b>Haitians</b> {{were the}} largest non- Hispanic Caribbean populations.

50|$|In Manhattan, a small {{concentration}} of working-class <b>Haitians</b> (7%) congregates on the Upper West Side and Harlem. Some reside along Cathedral Parkway and in Washington Heights. Very few <b>Haitians</b> (less than 1%) establish their niches in the Bronx.|$|R
50|$|According to the {{government}} of Acre, since December 2010, approximately 15,000 <b>Haitians</b> have entered the border of Peru and the state settled precariously in the states of Acre and Amazonas. As of 2015, around 50,000 <b>Haitians</b> are living in Brazil.|$|R
5|$|Brussels-born <b>Haitian</b> athlete Nadine Faustin-Parker participated on Haiti's behalf at the Beijing Summer Olympics. She was 32 {{years old}} at the time, and was the only <b>Haitian</b> {{participating}} in the women's 100meters hurdles. Faustin-Parker previously competed in the same event at both the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney and at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. Faustin-Parker participated in the fifth heat during the August 17 preliminary round, completing her event in 13.25seconds. She finished sixth out of eight athletes, ahead of Indonesia's Dedeh Erawati (13.49seconds) and behind the Ukraine's Yevgeniya Snihur (13.06seconds). Faustin-Parker finished in 29th place out of the 40 participating athletes. She did not advance to further rounds.|$|E
5|$|Haiti sent a {{delegation}} {{to compete in}} the 2008 Summer Olympics, held in Beijing, People's Republic of China, from August 8 to August 24, 2008. Its participation in Beijing marked its seventh consecutive appearance at the summer Olympics and its fourteenth appearance overall, with its first being at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris. The <b>Haitian</b> Olympic team included seven athletes (three men and four women) participating in track and field (Barbara Pierre, Ginou Etienne, Nadine Faustin-Parker, and Dudley Dorival), boxing (Azea Austinama), and judo (Joel Brutus and Ange Jean Baptiste). More women participated for Haiti in 2008 than at any single Olympic games prior. Although Pierre and Dorival advanced to quarterfinals in their events, there were no <b>Haitian</b> medalists in Beijing. Brutus carried his country's flag at the ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|Heureuse Réunion {{responded to}} the cannonade in kind. During the engagement, Gaspard {{repeatedly}} attempted to board Southampton, where his vastly superior numbers could overwhelm the British crew. Yeo was aware of his enemy's intentions, and repeatedly manoeuvered out of the way, his more disciplined and agile vessel easily able to remain out of contact with the overloaded <b>Haitian</b> ship. Within half an hour the highly efficient gunners on Southampton had knocked down the main and mizen masts on Heureuse Réunion, leaving her unable to manoeuvre and vulnerable to repeated pounding at close range. Despite the severe damage the <b>Haitian</b> ship suffered, her crew continued to fire cannon at irregular intervals for 45 minutes, each shot prompting a broadside from the British ship. The two smaller <b>Haitian</b> vessels {{did not support the}} frigate, fleeing towards Maraguana near Petit Goâve to shelter under the batteries there. By 07:45, after over an hour of heavy fire, Yeo hailed Heureuse Réunion to discover whether or not she had surrendered. Somebody aboard replied that they had, although Gaspard had been seriously wounded and was no longer in command, so the identity of the person who gave the surrender is not known.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, after 1937, quotas {{restricted}} {{the number of}} <b>Haitians</b> permitted to enter the Dominican Republic, and a strict and often discriminatory border policy was enacted. Dominicans continued to deport and kill <b>Haitians</b> in southern frontier regions—as refugees died of exposure, malaria and influenza.|$|R
50|$|Next to the NYC/New Jersey/Connecticut/Massachusetts area, Philadelphia {{has also}} become home to {{a growing number of}} <b>Haitians.</b> Like many other groups, the lower cost of living in Philadelphia has {{attracted}} many immigrants who entered the US through New York. Unlike New York, the community is not centralized. There are large numbers of <b>Haitians</b> in North Philadelphia, Northeast, and some in other areas like Olney, East Mount Airy, Chestnut Hill, and West Philadelphia. The conservative number of <b>Haitians</b> in Philadelphia is 30,000.|$|R

5|$|In 1927 the {{gendarmerie}} {{was reporting}} a strength of 160 officers, 2,522 gendarmes and 551 rural policemen. Even {{at this late}} date only about 40 of the officers were <b>Haitian,</b> the majority being United States Marines and sailors.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Fort Lauderdale had the twenty-sixth highest {{percentage}} of <b>Haitian</b> residents in the US, at 6.9% of the city's population, and the 127th {{highest percentage}} of Cuban residents, at 1.7% of the city's residents.|$|E
5|$|For decades <b>Haitians</b> {{have been}} {{crossing}} the Haitian-Dominican border for various reasons, including voluntary and involuntary migration, long- and short-term {{residence in the}} Dominican Republic, legal and illegal entry, smuggling, and human trafficking. <b>Haitians</b> move across the Haitian-Dominican border in search of opportunities and they are highly vulnerable to exploitation. In fact, the Dominican Republic {{has one of the}} worst records of human rights abuses, including human trafficking, against migrant workers in all of the Caribbean. <b>Haitians</b> in the Dominican Republic are widely disparaged as a migrant minority because of the countries' proximity. During the dictatorial reign of Jean-Claude Duvalier in the 1970s and 80s, he sold <b>Haitians</b> at bulk rates to work on sugar plantations in the Dominican Republic.|$|R
5000|$|Many have {{observed}} {{that there is a}} clear distinction between Dominicans and <b>Haitians</b> in the Dominican Republic. The two groups of people do not function as one entity and there are many factors that contribute to those tensions. Some Dominicans view <b>Haitians</b> in the Dominican Republic as an invasion of their own space that they have fought very long and hard to live in. Some Dominicans view <b>Haitians</b> as less than and believe that they are only intended in the Dominican Republic to work. There is a strong sense of Dominican pride in the Dominican Republic, and oftentimes, <b>Haitians</b> cannot fit into their culture or way of life. Many of these current day beliefs have been influenced by the old Dominican dictator, Rafael Trujillo.|$|R
50|$|After {{the devastating}} {{earthquake}} of 12 January 2010, countless <b>Haitians</b> fled {{across the border}} to escape the quake's effects. The Dominican government {{was one of the first}} to send teams to help distribute food and medicine to the victims and made it easier for <b>Haitians</b> to acquire visas to receive treatment in Dominican hospitals. Supplies were transported to Haiti through the Dominican Republic, and many injured <b>Haitians</b> have been treated in Dominican hospitals. Virtually, every level of the Dominican efforts assisted its neighboring country.|$|R
