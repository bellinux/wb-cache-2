40|$|The {{application}} of solder joints for electrical and mechanical interconnections between two functional layers in electronic packages will {{be present in}} future devices, even in 3 D-electronic devices. Very different approaches are investigated such as copper pillar, full <b>inter-metallic</b> <b>joints</b> or Au-Sn nanosponge. But the interconnection realization by -solder bumps as well as Flip-Chip solder joints will be one high potential connection method. The fundamentals about the solder alloy properties are necessary for material selection at product planning phase and further for the reliability estimations. Modem simulation tools are used for weak point estimations {{as well as for}} lifetime estimations (e. g. FEM). Any simulation software demands martial properties. The paper presents an excerpt of characterization techniques and results for the following physical data of SnAg 3. 5 solder: Elastic modulus Poisson ratio Creep Lin. thermal expansion (CTE) Thermal conductivity Ele ctrical conductivity Fatigue...|$|E
