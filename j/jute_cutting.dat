40|$|Harvesting jute plants leaving 1 ``, 2 ", 3 ", 4 ", 5 " and 6 " {{from the}} basal portion {{in the soil}} and retted separately, {{produced}} {{significant effect on the}} production of <b>jute</b> <b>cutting</b> and fibre quality. Harvesting plants leaving 4 "- 6 " from the soil eliminated cutting completely and produced A-grade fibre. But harvesting plants leaving 4 "- 6 " of basal portion in the soil apprehend loss of fibre weight...|$|E

The lower part is hard fiber, which is called <b>jute</b> <b>cuttings</b> in Bangladesh and India (commonly called jute butts or jute tops elsewhere). <b>Jute</b> <b>cuttings</b> are lower in quality, but have {{commercial}} value for the paper, carded yarn, and other fiber processing industries. Jute fibers are kept in bundles in the background in a warehouse in Bangladesh.|$|R
40|$|Dissolving pulps are the raw {{materials}} of cellulose derivatives and of many other cellulosic products. Jute {{is a very good}} source of cellulose and worthy of consideration for the production of dissolving pulp. In this investigation <b>jute</b> fiber, <b>jute</b> <b>cuttings,</b> and <b>jute</b> caddis were used as {{raw materials}} to prepare dissolving pulp by a formic acid process. A very high bleached pulp yield (49 to 59 %) was obtained in this process. The ÔÅ°-cellulose content was 93 to 98 %, with a high pulp viscosity. Also a good brightness (81 to 87 %) was achieved in totally chlorine free bleaching. Jute fiber showed the best and jute caddis showed lowest performance in producing dissolving pulp via the formic acid process. R 18 -R 10 values were much lower than for conventional dissolving pulp...|$|R

Enzyme treated low-grade jute could be blended in higher amounts with superior quality jute without any {{adverse effect on}} the blended product. Polyester resin forms an intimate bond with jute fibres up to a maximum fibre : resin ratio (v/v) of 60 : 40. Significant improvement in mechanical properties of jute fibre composites was observed by incorporation of polyesteramide polyol. Hybrid laminates (10 -ply) containing 8 inner plies of untreated/silane/titanate/TDI treated jute fibre sandwiched between two outer plies of glass fibre (weight content of jute : 25 - 27 %) are made. Although there exists a good potential of jute-glass hybrid composites. Whereas, for resin with jute, the ratio maintained is 3. 5 - 4 : 1. The preferred natural fibre is jute {{in the form of}} needled jute felt. An acidic xylan from 4 % alkali soluble fraction of unretted jute bark (a hybrid derivative from intervarietal cross of Corchorus capsularis and capsularis blue seeded). Dioxane acidolysis lignin of jute stick was isolated. Jute seed cake, was low in protein and high in lysine, isoleucine and fibre content. Qualitative improvement of low grade <b>jute</b> and <b>jute</b> <b>cuttings</b> using a crude enzyme preparation from A. niger. Induced changes in the genetic architecture of some macro mutants of jute...|$|R
40|$|Jute {{geotextiles}} {{are widely}} used to stabilize steep banks and road <b>cuttings.</b> <b>Jute</b> protects bare surfaces until seeded grass becomes established, then after several years, the jute decays. To evaluate two types of jute geotextiles, eight erosion plots were established in July 1994 at the Hilton Experimental Site, Shropshire, UK. On 10 April 1995, the plots were treated as follows: (1) jute geotextile net; (2) jute mat; (3) perennial rye grass (Lolium perenne); and (4) bare soil, with duplicates of each treatment. Over one year, sediment yields from jute net and jute mat were 1. 1...|$|R
