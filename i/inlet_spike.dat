50|$|Air was {{initially}} compressed (and heated) by the <b>inlet</b> <b>spike</b> and subsequent converging duct between the centerbody and inlet cowl. The shock waves generated slowed {{the air to}} subsonic speeds relative to the engine. The air then entered the engine compressor. Some of this compressor flow (20% at cruise) was removed after the 4th compressor stage and {{went straight to the}} afterburner through six bypass tubes. Air passing through the turbojet was compressed further by the remaining 5 compressor stages and then fuel was added in the combustion chamber. After passing through the turbine the exhaust, together with the compressor bleed air, entered the afterburner.|$|E

40|$|A free-~et {{investigation}} of the internal-flow and burning ch~acteristics of a 16 -inch ram jet was conducted in the IIACA Iawis altitude wind tunuel. Data were obtained at Mmh numbers of 1. 35 and 1. 73 over a range of etit-nozzle areas. A single oblique shook diffuser with no internal oontractia and a corrugated gutter-grid flame holder were employed. At both lath numbers, the <b>inlet</b> <b>spike</b> was Positicmed to allow the conicxalnose shock to inter-sect the cowl lip. Excellent agreement was observed between the cold-flow and burni ~ dMfuser total-~ssure recovery under both subcritical and su. percritioaloperation. The trends in the variation of additive dz’egand the normal-shock ~osition with mass-flow ratio agreed with those theoretically predicted. The total-~essure drop across the combustion chzmher could be predicted with reasonable aocuracy frcm the computed flame-holder and combustion momentum pressure losses. At any combustion-chamber-inletMach nmber $ either subcritical or supercritical, similar velooity distributions resulted at the “combustion-chambertilet for both the present free-jet investigation and a previously conducted oonnected-pipe investigation.

40|$|A design {{methodology}} based on streamline-tracing is discussed {{for the design}} of external-compression, supersonic inlets for flight below Mach 2. 0. The methodology establishes a supersonic compression surface and capture cross-section by tracing streamlines through an axisymmetric Busemann flowfield. The compression system of shock and Mach waves is altered through modifications to the leading edge and shoulder of the compression surface. An external terminal shock is established to create subsonic flow which is diffused in the subsonic diffuser. The {{design methodology}} was implemented into the SUPIN inlet design tool. SUPIN uses specified design factors to design the inlets and computes the inlet performance, which includes the flow rates, total pressure recovery, and wave drag. A design study was conducted using SUPIN and the Wind-US computational fluid dynamics code to design and analyze the properties of two streamline-traced, external-compression (STEX) supersonic inlets for Mach 1. 6 freestream conditions. The STEX inlets were compared to axisymmetric pitot, two-dimensional, and axisymmetric <b>spike</b> <b>inlets.</b> The STEX inlets had slightly lower total pressure recovery and higher levels of total pressure distortion than the axisymmetric <b>spike</b> <b>inlet.</b> The cowl wave drag coefficients of the STEX inlets were 20 % of those for the axisymmetric <b>spike</b> <b>inlet.</b> The STEX inlets had external sound pressures that were 37 % of those of the axisymmetric <b>spike</b> <b>inlet,</b> which may result in lower adverse sonic boom characteristics. The flexibility of the shape of the capture cross-section may result in benefits for the integration of STEX inlets with aircraft...|$|R
40|$|A {{subscale}} aerodynamic {{model of}} the GTX air-breathing launch vehicle was tested at NASA Glenn Research Center's 10 - by 10 -Foot Supersonic Wind Tunnel from Mach 2. 0 to 3. 5 at various angles-of-attack. The objective of the test {{was to investigate the}} effect of angle-of-attack on inlet mass capture, inlet diverter effectiveness, and the flowfield at the cowl lip plane. The flow-through inlets were tested with and without boundary-layer diverters. Quantitative measurements such as inlet mass flow rates and pitot-pressure distributions in the cowl lip plane are presented. At a 3 deg angle-of-attack, the flow rates for the top and side inlets were within 8 percent of the zero angle-of-attack value, and little distortion was evident at the cowl lip plane. Surface oil flow patterns showing the shock/boundary-layer interaction caused by the <b>inlet</b> <b>spikes</b> are shown. In addition to inlet data, vehicle forebody static pressure distributions, boundary-layer profiles, and temperature-sensitive paint images to evaluate the boundary-layer transition are presented. Three-dimensional parabolized Navier-Stokes computational fluid dynamics calculations of the forebody flowfield are presented and show good agreement with the experimental static pressure distributions and boundary-layer profiles. With the boundary-layer diverters installed, no adverse aerodynamic phenomena were found that would prevent the inlets from operating at the required angles-of-attack. We recommend that phase 2 of the test program be initiated, where inlet contraction ratio and diverter geometry variations will be tested...|$|R

The effect of the gas contact time, pH control and water make-up flowrate were also evaluated during 8 months. The average elimination capacity was 13 g N m- 3 h- 1 and 3. 3 g C m- 3 h- 1 for NH 3 and VOCs, respectively. Maximum capacities obtained during an <b>inlet</b> concentration <b>spiking</b> experiment were 45 g N m- 3 h- 1 and 20 g C m- 3 h- 1 at a removal efficiency of 92. 5 and 46. 7...|$|R
40|$|The {{flow field}} at the left <b>inlet</b> <b>spike</b> tip of a YF- 12 A {{airplane}} was examined using at 26 deg included angle conical flow sensor to obtain measurements at free-stream Mach numbers from 1. 6 to 3. 0. Local flow angularity, Mach number, impact pressure, and mass flow were determined and compared with free-stream values. Local flow changes occurred {{at the same time}} as free-stream changes. The local flow usually approached the spike centerline from the upper outboard side because of spike cant and toe-in. Free-stream Mach number influenced the local flow angularity; as Mach number increased above 2. 2, local angle of attack increased and local sideslip angle decreased. Local Mach number was generally 3 percent less than free-stream Mach number. Impact-pressure ratio and mass flow ratio increased as free-stream Mach number increased above 2. 2, indicating a beneficial forebody compression effect. No degradation of the spike tip instrumentation was observed after more than 40 flights in the high-speed thermal environment encountered by the airplane. The sensor is rugged, simple, and sensitive to small flow changes. It can provide accurate imputs necessary to control an inlet...|$|E

The auxiliary scoop provided 17 percent additional air flow with a drop in critical pressure recovery from 0. 86 to 0. 81. However, in terms of inlet-engine matching, the pressure recovery of the undersized <b>spike</b> <b>inlet</b> operating at a specified corrected air flow increased with the scoop open, for example, from 0. 69 to 0. 81...|$|R
40|$|Propulsion {{integration}} for low-boom {{supersonic aircraft}} requires careful inlet selection, placement, and tailoring {{to achieve a}}cceptable propulsive and aerodynamic performance, without compromising vehicle sonic boom loudness levels. In this investigation, an inward-turning streamline-traced and axisymmetric <b>spike</b> <b>inlet</b> are designed and independently installed on a conceptual low-boom supersonic demonstrator aircraft. The airframe was pre-shaped to achieve a target ground under-track loudness of 76. 4 PLdB at cruise using an adjoint-based design optimization process. Aircraft and inlet performance characteristics were obtained by solution of the steady-state Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. Isolated cruise inlet performance including total pressure recovery and distortion were computed and compared against installed inlet performance metrics. Evaluation of vehicle near-field pressure signatures, along with under- and off-track propagated loudness levels is also reported. Results indicate the integrated axisymmetric spike design offers higher inlet pressure recovery, lower fan distortion, and reduced sonic boom. The vehicle with streamline-traced inlet exhibits lower external wave drag, which translates to a higher lift-to-drag ratio and increased range capability...|$|R
40|$|In {{a variety}} of {{aeronautical}} applications, the flow around conical bodies at incidence is of interest. Such applications include, {{but are not limited}} to, highly maneuverable aircraft with delta wings, the aerospace plane and nose portions of <b>spike</b> <b>inlets.</b> The theoretical model used has three parts. First, the single line vortex model is used within the framework of slender body theory, to compute the outer inviscid field for specified separation lines. Next, the three dimensional boundary layer is represented by a momentum equation for the cross flow, analogous to that for a plane boundary layer; a von Karman Pohlhausen approximation is applied to solve this equation. The cross flow separation for both laminar and turbulent layers is determined by matching the pressure at the upper and lower separation points. This iterative procedure yields a unique solution for the separation lines and consequently for the position of the vortices and the vortex lift on the body. Lastly, control of separation is achieved by blowing tangentially from a slot located along a cone generator. It is found that for very small blowing coefficients, the separation can be postponed or suppressedy completely...|$|R

The equations for a 1 -D, axisymmetric MHD generator/accelerator are derived and numerically integrated {{to determine the}} generator/accelerator performance characteristics. The concept offers a shockless means of interacting with high speed inlet flows and potentially offers variable inlet geometry performance without the complexity of moving parts simply by varying the generator loading parameter. The cycle analysis conducted iteratively with a <b>spike</b> <b>inlet</b> and turbojet flying at M = 7 at 30 km altitude is estimated {{to have a positive}} thrust per unit mass flow of 185 N-s/kg. The turbojet allowable combustor temperature is set at an aggressive 2200 deg K. The annular MHD Hall generator/accelerator is L = 3 m in length with a B(sub r) = 5 Tesla magnetic field and a conductivity of sigma = 5 mho/m for the generator and sigma= 1. 0 mho/m for the accelerator. The calculated isentropic efficiency for the generator is eta(sub sg) = 84 percent at an enthalpy extraction ratio, eta(sub Ng) = 0. 63. The calculated isentropic efficiency for the accelerator is eta(sub sa) = 81 percent at an enthalpy addition ratio, eta(sub Na) = 0. 62. An assessment of the ionization fraction necessary to achieve a conductivity of sigma = 1. 0 mho/m is n(sub e) /n = 1. 90 X 10 (exp - 6), and for sigma = 5. 0 mho/m is n(sub e) /n = 9. 52 X 10 (exp - 6) ...|$|R
