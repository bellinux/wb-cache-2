40|$|Automobile {{exhaust gas}} {{conversion}} was simulated with a reactor model based on first principles. The monolithic reactor was modelled as adiabatically operating with a uniform flow distribution over the channels and with constant heat and mass transfer coefficients. The kinetic rate equations {{in the model}} were constructed from elementary step kinetics of the individual global reactions. The model predictions for light-off curves compare quite well with experimental data from the literature. Light-off is in the sequence hydrogen, carbon monoxide, propene, but the light-off temperatures do not differ very much. The nitric oxide conversion as function of the reactor feed temperature passes through a maximum at high hydrocarbon conversion, but does not reach the level of 50 %, defined as light-off. Hydrogen is the major oxygen consumer in the front part of the reactor, while a slow reaction proceeds between CO and NO. At sufficiently high feed temperatures thermal reactor ignition occurs when the degree of CO surface coverage drops considerably. The corresponding increase of the O adatoms coverage causes increased reaction rates and a sudden temperature rise. Beyond the ignition point oxygen is mainly consumed by propene and by unconverted carbon monoxide. NO is reduced by unconverted hydrogen, while NO reduction by the hydrocarbon is not significant. Catalysts capable of increasing the NO surface coverage or the NO dissociation, or leading to a lower oxygen sticking coefficient would show a higher NO conversion maximum.

This work was studied the conversion of Nitric Oxide (NO) in exhaust <b>gas</b> catalytic <b>converter</b> affected by <b>gas</b> velocity and inlet temperature using numerical modeling. Approach: The simulation was based on a one-dimensional time-dependent model within a single monolith channel of the converter. Upon certain assumptions, the study was considered heterogeneous combustion reaction between gas and solid phases based on lumped kinetic reactions. In this study, constants and variables used for mass and heat transfers were dependent on gas or solid phase temperature and mole fraction. Finite difference scheme incorporated with the generated computer code was established for solving species and energy balances within gas and solid phases. Results: The NO conversion was increased with transient period in initial and reached steady state at different values. The lower inlet gas temperature was resulted in lesser NO conversion at the same inlet NO concentration and gas velocity. The light-off temperatures were up to 520 K and a sudden rise in NO conversion was from 550 - 605 K and decreasing onwards, generating working temperature window. NO conversion increased throughout the catalyst bed from the inlet and the conversion decreased as the gas velocity increased. Conclusion/Recommendations: Gas space velocity and gas temperature intake to the converter affected the NO conversion over the time and the axial distance from the catalyst bed inlet. The numerical results have summarily demonstrated a good approximation compared to experimental data provided in the literature. Further investigation of such effects on other gaseous components is recommended for future work...|$|R
