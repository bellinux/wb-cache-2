40|$|Utilization of the fly ashes is a {{major problem}} in many {{developing}} countries and in South Africa only about 7 % of the fly ash produced annually by coal-fired power stations, is being utilized. Although, fly ashes can be used as an alternative binder in alkali-activated concretes, strength development of these concretes at room temperature is slow limiting application of the material. <b>Direct</b> <b>electric</b> curing is proposed for heat curing of alkali-activated fly ash concrete which will open new opportunities for insitu applications of these concretes in the construction industry thus increasing the amount of benefi- cially utilized fly ash. Alkali-activated fly ash concretes containing unclassified low calcium fly ash, sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate solutions were cured at 60 C by means of <b>direct</b> <b>electric</b> curing. The electric resistivity and compressive strength development of the concretes were investigated. The resistivity strongly depends on the type of activator used.

40|$|Abstract Background In vivo {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to quantify the effectiveness of low-level <b>direct</b> <b>electric</b> current for different amounts of electrical charge and the survival rate in fibrosarcoma Sa- 37 and Ehrlich tumors, also the effect of <b>direct</b> <b>electric</b> in Ehrlich tumor was evaluate through the measurements of tumor volume and the peritumoral and tumoral findings. Methods BALB/c male mice, 7 – 8 week old and 20 – 22 g weight were used. Ehrlich and fibrosarcoma Sa- 37 cell lines, growing in BALB/c mice. Solid and subcutaneous Ehrlich and fibrosarcoma Sa- 37 tumors, located dorsolaterally in animals, were initiated by the inoculation of 5 × 10 6 and 1 × 10 5 viable tumor cells, respectively. For each type of tumor four groups (one control group and three treated groups) consisting of 10 mice randomly divided were formed. When the tumors reached approximately 0. 5 cm 3, four platinum electrodes were inserted into their bases. The electric charge delivered to the tumors was varied {{in the range of}} 5. 5 to 110 C/cm 3 for a constant time of 45 minutes. An additional experiment was performed in BALB/c male mice bearing Ehrlich tumor to examine from a histolological point of view the effects of <b>direct</b> <b>electric</b> current. A control group and a treated group with 77 C/cm 3 (27. 0 C in 0. 35 cm 3) and 10 mA for 45 min were formed. In this experiment when the tumor volumes reached 0. 35 cm 3, two anodes and two cathodes were inserted into the base perpendicular to the tumor long axis. Results Significant tumor growth delay and survival rate were achieved after electrotherapy and both were dependent on <b>direct</b> <b>electric</b> current intensity, being more marked in fibrosarcoma Sa- 37 tumor. Complete regressions for fibrosarcoma Sa- 37 and Ehrlich tumors were observed for electrical charges of 80 and 92 C/cm 3, respectively. Histopathological and peritumoral findings in Ehrlich tumor revealed in the treated group marked tumor necrosis, vascular congestion, peritumoral neutrophil infiltration, an acute inflammatory response, and a moderate peritumoral monocyte infiltration. The morphologic pattern of necrotic cell mass after <b>direct</b> <b>electric</b> current treatment is the coagulative necrosis. These findings were not observed in any of the untreated tumors. Conclusion The data presented indicate that electrotherapy with low-level DEC is feasible and effective in the treatment of the Ehrlich and fibrosarcoma Sa- 37 tumors. Our results demonstrate that the sensitivity of these tumors to <b>direct</b> <b>electric</b> current and survival rates of the mice depended on both the amount of electrical charge and the type of tumor. Also the complete regression of each type of tumor is obtained for a threshold amount of electrical charge. </p...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an empirical {{analysis of the}} supply-side constraints that impact household choices of space heating systems in French dwellings. Based on data from the 2006 National Housing Survey and the 2013 Household Survey, we estimate discrete choice models using socio-demographic, dwelling and spatial characteristics as determinants of choice. In order to capture the supply-side constraints, we perform a post-estimation clustering based on the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, which allows us to determine the groups of households that {{are most likely to}} choose each considered space heating system. The results suggest that for 2006, households living in individual houses preferred to heat space using an individual boiler, whereas those living in apartments opted for <b>direct</b> <b>electric</b> heating. In 2013 all households preferred <b>direct</b> <b>electric</b> heating, and wood heating became their second choice. The discrete choice models do not show a significant change in behavior from 2006 to 2013. The post-estimation clustering indicates that many households were strongly constrained by the conditions and characteristics of their living space in 2006. The mean probability of choosing <b>direct</b> <b>electric</b> heating or a boiler was more than 0. 8 for 21 % of households living in houses and for 36 % living in apartments. Thus, these households did not seem to have a choice. In 2013 the supply-side constraints were weaker. The highest mean probability (0. 755) is observed in the group opting for an individual boiler.
