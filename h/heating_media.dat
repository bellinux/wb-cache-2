As shown in the equation, the heat transfer area is one of the chief factors that affect the rate of conductive heat transfer. Therefore, it would be favourable to maximise the amount of area available for heat transfer. The limitations for these can be in terms of the cost per unit area as increasing the area would mean increasing the length of the tubes and also the shell of the evaporator which can significantly increase the cost of construction and maintenance,.|$|E

50|$|A Belt dryer / Belt cooler is {{a device}} {{designed}} for the particularly gentle thermal treatment of product. The wet product is continuously and evenly applied through an infeed chamber onto a perforated belt. The belt, predominantly in horizontal position, carries the product through the drying area which is divided into several sections. In these cells drying gas flows through or over the wet product and dries it. Each cell can be equipped with a ventilating fan and a heat exchanger. This modular design allows the drying and cooling temperatures to be controlled separately in the different sections. Thus, each dryer cell can be individually controlled and the drying / cooling air flow can be varied in each cell. In addition, {{the speed of the}} conveyor belt can be varied what gives an additional parameter for setting of drying time.The cells can be heated or cooled directly or indirectly, and all <b>heating</b> <b>media,</b> such as oil, steam, hot water or hot gas can be used.Belt dryers are ideally suited to drying almost any non-flowing product or more granular products that require a lower throughput capacity.|$|E

Methods and Results: The heat resistance of Listeria monocytogenes at 58 °C was studied in Brain Heart Infusion broth {{as a function of}} pH (from 5 - 0 to 7 - 0) and redox potential (Eh 7). The media redox was adjusted with nitrogen gas, potassium ferricyanide and dithiothreitol. A Weibull model was used to fit survival curves. The heat resistance parameter (δ 58 °C) was estimated from each inactivation curve. A major effect of pH was observed. Bigelow model was used to describe the effect of redox potential on the apparent L. monocytogenes heat resistance. The highest δ 58 °C values have been obtained at pH 7 - 0 and oxidizing conditions.

The addition of free fatty acids to <b>heating</b> <b>media</b> has a slight influence on the heat resistance of bacterial spores whatever the species or type of acid studied.

40|$|The {{survival}} and germination of Clostridium perfringens spores in different <b>heating</b> <b>media</b> and at different heating rates was studied {{to determine the}} fate of C. perfringens spores during abusive cooking and cooling of pork products. The heat resistance (HR) of C. perfringens spores from three strains that were either previously heat shocked (HS) or non-heat shocked (NHS) was determined individually and as a cocktail in phosphate buffer solution (pH 7. 4) (PBS), beef gravy (BG), ground pork (GP) and cured ground pork (CGP) at 75 ?C. The effect of the heating rate on HR, germination and outgrowth of C. perfringens spores in CGP was determined by increasing the temperature from 20 to 75 ?C {{at a rate of}} 4, 8, and 12 ?C/h prior to heating and holding at 75 ?C for 48 h. Heating rates at 4 ?C/h in GP and CGP were repeated with additional cooling from 54. 4 to 7. 2 ?C within 20 h (temperature abuse). Linear survival curves were observed on NHS spores in the four <b>heating</b> <b>media,</b> whereas HS spores showed linear curves when heated in PBS and BG, and biphasic curves when heated in GP and CGP. In general, HS spores were more heat sensitive than NHS spores. NHS spores heated in GP had greater HR than spores heated in CGP, BG or PBS. There were no significant differences (P> 0. 05) on the HR of C. perfringens spores in CGP heated from 20 to 75 ?C at 4, 8, or 12 ?C/h. Heating rates of 8 and 12 ?C/h showed no difference in germination and outgrowth of inoculated spores, whereas at 4 ?C/h, growth of C. perfringens occurred between 44 and 56 ?C. Temperature abuse during cooling of GP resulted in 2. 8 log CFU/g increase of C. perfringens counts. In CGP, C. perfringens counts decreased by 1. 1 log CFU/g during cooling from 54. 4 to 36. 3 ?C and then increased by 1 log CFU/g until the product reached 7. 2 ?C. However, with an initial inoculum in raw CGP of 5 log CFU C. perfringens spores/g, C. perfringens counts did not exceed 3. 4 log CFU/g during a 20 h abusive cooling. These results suggest there is no risk associated with C. perfringens in cured pork products under the conditions tested.

The temperature at the particle center was measured during the process, {{and used to}} evaluate heating rates, reaction temperatures and devolatilization times. A general observation was that beech wood is heated faster in fluoride and carbonate melts, but the differences diminish with increasing reactor temperatures. The highest heating rates at the particle center were observed in FLiNaK (46 – 56 °C/s). The effective pyrolysis temperature at which the main decomposition of cellulose and hemicellulose takes place showed a weak dependence on reactor temperature, but {{no significant difference between}} the <b>heating</b> <b>media</b> was discovered.

Traditional obstacle to utilisation of geothermal steam for chemical processes has been the limited steam temperatures and pressures available from the geothermal fluid separators.
