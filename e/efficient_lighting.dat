25|$|The {{initial cost}} of an {{incandescent}} bulb is small compared {{to the cost of}} the energy it uses over its lifetime. Incandescent bulbs have a shorter life than most other lighting, an important factor if replacement is inconvenient or expensive. Some types of lamp, including incandescent and fluorescent, emit less light as they age; this may be an inconvenience, or may reduce effective lifetime due to lamp replacement before total failure. A comparison of incandescent lamp operating cost with other light sources must include illumination requirements, cost of the lamp and labor cost to replace lamps (taking into account effective lamp lifetime), cost of electricity used, effect of lamp operation on heating and air conditioning systems. When used for lighting in houses and commercial buildings, the energy lost to heat can significantly increase the energy required by a building's air conditioning system. During the heating season heat produced by the bulbs is not wasted, although in most cases it is more cost effective to obtain heat from the heating system. Regardless, {{over the course of a}} year a more <b>efficient</b> <b>lighting</b> system saves energy in nearly all climates.|$|E

The building was designed to house 130 students split between two double rooms and 126 singles, but now fits up to 202 students, demonymously referred to as [...] "Cushlings". The house presently includes single dorms, one-room doubles, and two-room doubles and triples. Upon opening in 1927 (prior to Vassar's 1969 transition from being an all-female to co-ed college), the dormitory was limited to housing freshmen. It is now co-ed and acts as home to students from all grades including, as of 1999, the highest proportion of upperclassmen of any dorm at the school. Bathrooms are shared by all members of a hall. A minor renovation in summer 1995 and funded by the Estée Lauder Companies included more <b>efficient</b> <b>lighting,</b> rewiring, and new furniture for the house. Like all other Vassar dorms, Cushing houses a game room, a laundry room, and a Steinway grand piano.|$|E
2500|$|The overall {{energy savings}} from {{changing}} to more <b>efficient</b> <b>lighting</b> {{depends on the}} climate. In warm climates, <b>efficient</b> <b>lighting</b> has the additional energy-saving effect of {{reducing the amount of}} cooling required. In cold climates increased heating energy demand may offset some of the lighting energy saved with <b>efficient</b> <b>lighting.</b> [...] A report published in January 2008 found that in Los Angeles, where incandescent lighting results in increased air conditioning, electricity savings would pay for the initial cost of CFLs four times faster than in Vancouver, where incandescent lighting contributes to space heating. In all climates, there is a net cost saving from changing to compact fluorescent lighting. The cost of CFL and LED bulbs has declined greatly since 2008, which shortens the time needed to pay off their initial cost.|$|E
2500|$|In some cases, {{evaluation}} of existing plans {{has determined that}} more <b>efficient</b> <b>lighting</b> plans are possible. For instance, light pollution can be reduced by turning off unneeded outdoor lights, and only lighting stadiums when there are people inside. Timers are especially valuable for this purpose. One of the world's first coordinated legislative efforts to reduce the adverse effect of this pollution on the environment began in Flagstaff, Arizona, in the U.S. [...] There, over three decades of ordinance development has taken place, with {{the full support of}} the population, often with government support, with community advocates, {{and with the help of}} major local observatories, including the United States Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station.
