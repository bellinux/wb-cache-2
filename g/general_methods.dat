40|$|The {{importance}} of atmospheric down-welling radiation in studying building thermal environments and energy performance {{has been well}} identified, and empirical formulae to evaluate atmospheric down-welling radiation values developed with their inadequacies. In this paper, a study of developing an alternative <b>general</b> <b>method</b> for evaluating atmospheric down-welling radiation values to the water pond-based empirical formula by Clark and Allen is reported. The validity of the alternative <b>general</b> <b>method</b> has been demonstrated by comparing the atmospheric down-welling radiation values evaluated using the alternative <b>general</b> <b>method</b> and that using the Clark and Allen's formula. Since the alternative <b>general</b> <b>method</b> developed {{is based on a}} building roof system, and no water is involved, the alternative <b>general</b> <b>method</b> developed in this paper appears to have more advantages. On one hand, this could eliminate any potential impacts on prediction accuracy when water is used in different climates. On the other hand, the application of the alternative <b>general</b> <b>method</b> is relatively easier as only a suitable existing roof system is required. Therefore, the use of alternative <b>general</b> <b>method</b> can provide a more reliable and economic alternative in evaluating atmospheric down-welling radiation, when compared to using Clark and Allen's empirical formula. Practical application The alternative <b>general</b> <b>method</b> developed for evaluating atmospheric down-welling radiation values in this paper could be used {{as an alternative to the}} empirical formula proposed by Clark and Allen and is valid for all climate conditions and easy to be implemented to evaluate alternative <b>general</b> <b>method</b> values. It can be used when evaluating building night sky cooling, building passive cooling system, etc. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R

25|$|The {{earliest}} {{development of}} classical mechanics {{is often referred}} to as Newtonian mechanics. It consists of the physical concepts employed by and the mathematical methods invented by Newton, Leibniz and others. Later, more abstract and <b>general</b> <b>methods</b> were developed, leading to the reformulations of classical mechanics known as Lagrangian mechanics and Hamiltonian mechanics. These advances, made predominantly in the 18th and 19th centuries, extend substantially beyond Newton's work, particularly through their use of analytical mechanics.|$|E

25|$|In chemistry, the {{hydrogenation}} of carbon–nitrogen double {{bonds is}} {{the addition of}} the elements of dihydrogen (H2) across a carbon–nitrogen double bond, forming amines or amine derivatives. Although a variety of <b>general</b> <b>methods</b> have been developed for the enantioselective hydrogenation of ketones, methods for the hydrogenation of carbon–nitrogen double bonds are less general. Hydrogenation of imines is complicated by both syn/anti isomerization and tautomerization to enamines, which may be hydrogenated with low enantioselectivity {{in the presence of a}} chiral catalyst. Additionally, the substituent attached to nitrogen affects both the reactivity and spatial properties of the imine, complicating the development of a general catalyst system for imine hydrogenation. Despite these challenges, methods have been developed that address particular substrate classes, such as N-aryl, N-alkyl, and endocyclic imines.|$|E
25|$|Functional {{integration}} {{is the study}} of how brain regions work together to process information and effect responses. Though functional integration frequently relies on anatomic knowledge of the connections between brain areas, the emphasis is on how large clusters of neurons - numbering in the thousands or millions - fire together under various stimuli. The large datasets required for such a whole-scale picture of brain function have motivated the development of several novel and <b>general</b> <b>methods</b> for the statistical analysis of interdependence, such as dynamic causal modelling and statistical linear parametric mapping. These datasets are typically gathered in human subjects by non-invasive methods such as EEG/MEG, fMRI, or PET. The results can be of clinical value by helping to identify the regions responsible for psychiatric disorders, as well as to assess how different activities or lifestyles affect the functioning of the brain.|$|E
25|$|The {{asymptotic}} computational {{complexity of}} these algorithms may be misleading, {{because they can}} only be run on inputs of very small size. In a 1991 comparison, Hoon Hong estimated that Collins' doubly exponential procedure {{would be able to}} solve a problem whose size is described by setting all the above parameters to 2, in less than a second, whereas the algorithms of Grigoriev, Vorbjov, and Renegar would instead take more than a million years. In 1993, Joos, Roy, and Solernó suggested that {{it should be possible to}} make small modifications to the exponential-time procedures to make them faster in practice than cylindrical algebraic decision, as well as faster in theory. However, as of 2009, it was still the case that <b>general</b> <b>methods</b> for the first-order theory of the reals remained superior in practice to the singly exponential algorithms specialized to the existential theory of the reals.|$|E

25|$|Oocytes can be {{collected}} from most mammalian species. Conventional oocyte collection is when ovaries {{are removed from}} a donor animal; this is done posthumously in slaughter facilities. The ovaries are kept warm as they are brought back to a laboratory for oocyte collection. Keeping the ovaries warm helps increase the success rate of fertilization. Once collected the oocytes are assessed and categorized into small, medium, and large, and then matured for 20–23 hours. This simple, inexpensive technique can lead to about 24 oocytes collected from a bovine. Conventional oocyte collection is especially useful for females who unexpectedly die or who are incapable of being bred due to injury. A second option for oocyte collection is to utilize the transvaginal ultrasound guided oocyte collection method otherwise known as TUGA. Collection technique varies slightly by species, but the <b>general</b> <b>methods</b> for collection are the same; a needle is inserted into each ovarian follicle and pulled out via vacuum. The major benefit of using this method {{is the ability to}} expand the lifetime reproductive productivity, or the number of productive days an animal is in her estrous cycle. Pregnant cows and mares continue to develop new follicles until the middle of pregnancy. Thus, TUGA can be used to substantially increase the fitness of an individual because the female then has the potential produce more than one offspring per gestation.|$|E

2500|$|Although Diophantus made {{important}} {{advances in}} symbolism, he still lacked the necessary notation to express more <b>general</b> <b>methods.</b> This caused {{his work to}} be more concerned with particular problems rather than general situations. Some {{of the limitations of}} Diophantus' notation are that he only had notation for one unknown and, when problems involved more than a single unknown, Diophantus was reduced to expressing [...] "first unknown", [...] "second unknown", etc. in words. He also lacked a symbol for a general number [...] Where we would write , Diophantus has to resort to constructions like: [...] "... a sixfold number increased by twelve, which is divided by the difference by which the square of the number exceeds three".|$|E

[...] However, most intermediates are compounds that have never been made before, and these will normally be made using <b>general</b> <b>methods</b> developed by methodology researchers.

2500|$|The <b>general</b> <b>methods</b> for {{creating}} chimeric mice {{can be summarized}} either by injection or aggregation of embryonic cells from different origins. The first chimeric mouse was made by Beatrice Mintz in the 1960s through the aggregation of eight-cell-stage embryos. Injection {{on the other hand}} was pioneered by Richard Gardner and Ralph Brinster who injected cells into blastocysts to create chimeric mice with germ lines fully derived from injected embryonic stem cells (ES cells). Chimeras can be derived from mouse embryos that have not yet implanted in the uterus as well as from implanted embryos. ES cells from the inner cell mass of an implanted blastocyst can contribute to all cell lineages of a mouse including the germ line. [...] ES cells are a useful tool in chimeras because genes can be mutated in them through the use of homologous recombination, thus allowing gene targeting. [...] Since this discovery occurred in 1999, ES cells have become a key tool in the generation of specific chimeric mice.|$|E
