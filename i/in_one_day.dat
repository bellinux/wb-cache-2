5|$|Despite {{having lost}} 5–0 to the West Indies {{in each of}} the two most recent series, England had grounds for {{optimism}} leading up to the Test series: the West Indian team was ageing and lacked a leg-spinner; and the England team had home advantage.

5|$|England {{hosted the}} first three competitions. The ICC decided that England should host the first tournament because it was ready to devote the {{resources}} required to organising the inaugural event. India volunteered to host the third Cricket World Cup, but most ICC members preferred England as the longer period of daylight in England in June meant that a match could be completed <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>day.</b> The 1987 Cricket World Cup was held in India and Pakistan, the first hosted outside England.|$|E
