After looking through the papers of his father, who died in 1978, Nicholas found that <b>everything</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> place for its creation. He then wrote to all the members of the Romanov family who had been in communication with his father and it was agreed that a family association should be created. A year later, in 1979, the Romanov Family Association was officially formed with Prince Dmitri Alexandrovich as president and Nicholas as vice-president. When Vasili Alexandrovich became president in 1980, Nicholas remained vice-president.|$|E
25|$|Tiernan {{said in his}} book, The Dublin Bombings and the Murder Triangle, {{that the}} Monaghan bombing, which took place 90 minutes after the Dublin explosions, was {{executed}} by loyalists working {{under the direction of}} Hanna. According to Tiernan, {{a few days before the}} bombing, Hanna had visited a pub in Portadown to check that <b>everything</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> place for the operation to be carried out. The Monaghan bombing had been organised as a diversionary tactic to draw Gardaí away from the border, enabling the bombers to cross back into Northern Ireland undetected. According to submissions received by Mr. Justice Barron, the Monaghan bomb was assembled at the home of high-ranking UVF member Harris Boyle in Portadown.|$|E
500|$|Scientific rehearsals {{were held}} on 12 and 13 September. This was {{followed}} by an operational rehearsal on 19 September, which included fully assembling the bomb, since the radioactive components had arrived the day before on a Sunderland. Penney arrived by air on 22 September. <b>Everything</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> readiness by 30 September, and the only remaining factor was the weather. This was unfavourable on 1 October but improved the following day, when Penney designated 3 October as the date for the test. The final countdown commenced at 09:15 local time on 3 October 1952. The bomb was successfully detonated at 09:29:24 on 3 October 1952 local time, which was 23:59:24 on 2 October 1952 UTC, 00:59:24 on 3 October in London, and 7:59:24 on 3 October in Perth. The explosion occurred [...] below the water line, and left a saucer-shaped crater on the seabed [...] deep and [...] across.

500|$|Anderson's {{directing}} {{helped to}} energize the production, and {{the cast and}} crew worked more than usual to make sure that <b>everything</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> order for her. Production designer Corey Kaplan made sure that the episode featured a Buddhist temple at Anderson's request, and casting director Rick Millikan helped Anderson choose the appropriate actors and actresses. Millikan later said that he particularly enjoyed working with Anderson, because it was [...] "fun" [...] for him to watch her go through the casting process, which was entirely new to her. On set, Anderson's directing style was described as [...] "right on the money" [...] by Marc Shapiro in his book all things: The Official Guide to The X-Files, Volume 6. He later wrote that [...] "Anderson wielded a deft hand in her directorial debut, prodding the actors to her will, making decisions on the fly, and handling the complex special effects sequences". Fans of the show later wrote to express their appreciation of Anderson's directing abilities. Anderson was also involved in post-production editing, during which she was forced to cut the final conversation scene between Scully and Daniel Waterston by 10minutes {{in order to meet the}} allotted episode length.|$|E
500|$|Although {{she worked}} well into her seventh month, Cardinale's {{pregnancy}} was kept a tight secret. Tormented by thoughts of suicide, {{she fell into}} a state of depression. When she thought she could no longer hide her condition, she asked Cristaldi to terminate her contract. Understanding her predicament, he sent her to London for the birth, far away from the press. He simply explained that she had gone to England to learn English for a film. Cristaldi told Cardinale not to reveal her condition as she would be betraying the public and it would put an end to her career. So as to maintain the secret, he drew up a detailed American-style contract covering every little detail of her life, depriving her of any possibility of acting on her own behalf. Cardinale explained: [...] "I was no longer master of my own body or thoughts. Even talking with a friend about anything that could make me look different from my public image was risky, {{as if it had been}} publicized, I would have been in trouble. <b>Everything</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the hands of Vides". For seven years, Cardinale kept her secret, not only from the public, but also from her own son, Patrick, who grew up in the family with her parents and sister more or less as a brother until the day Enzo Biagi, a journalist, discovered the truth. After Cardinale decided to tell him everything, he published her story in [...] Oggi and L'Europeo.|$|E

2500|$|Although Postlethwaite {{remained}} {{with the team}} until [...] they were never to repeat their [...] success. When Walter Wolf closed the team {{down at the end}} of 1979 he transferred, along with the Wolf cars and driver Keke Rosberg to the Fittipaldi Automotive team. He produced a new design, the F8, for the latter half of 1980 but left to join Ferrari in early 1981. At the time the Italian team were considered amongst the best engine builders in the sport, but amongst the worst chassis designers. Postlethwaite was selected personally by Enzo Ferrari to rectify this problem and by the following year <b>everything</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> place for success.|$|E
2500|$|The writers {{decided to}} change the book's setting from London to Chicago because they were more {{familiar}} with the city and it also had a [...] "great alternative music scene", according to Pink.

I knew two or three different record shops when I was growing up that had a Rob, a Dick and a Barry in them". Charlotte Tudor, of the film's distributor, Buena Vista, said: [...] "Chicago has the same feel as north London, there is a vibrant music scene, a lot of the action is set in smoky bars and, of course, there is the climate. But everyone, including Nick, felt that geography was not the central issue. It has a universal appeal". Scenes were filmed in the neighborhood of Wicker Park, [...] and on the campus of Lane Tech High School.|$|E
