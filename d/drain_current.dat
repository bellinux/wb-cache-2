25|$|For either enhancement- or depletion-mode devices, at drain-to-source {{voltages}} {{much less}} than gate-to-source voltages, changing the gate voltage will alter the channel resistance, and <b>drain</b> <b>current</b> will be proportional to drain voltage (referenced to source voltage). In this mode the FET operates like a variable resistor and the FET {{is said to be}} operating in a linear mode or ohmic mode.|$|E
25|$|As {{the channel}} length becomes very short, these {{equations}} become quite inaccurate. New physical effects arise. For example, carrier transport {{in the active}} mode may become limited by velocity saturation. When velocity saturation dominates, the saturation <b>drain</b> <b>current</b> is more nearly linear than quadratic in VGS. At even shorter lengths, carriers transport with near zero scattering, known as quasi-ballistic transport. In the ballistic regime, the carriers travel at an injection velocity that may exceed the saturation velocity and approaches the Fermi velocity at high inversion charge density. In addition, drain-induced barrier lowering increases off-state (cutoff) current and requires an increase in threshold voltage to compensate, which in turn reduces the saturation current.|$|E
25|$|The MOSFET's {{advantages}} in digital circuits do not translate into supremacy in all analog circuits. The {{two types of}} circuit draw upon different features of transistor behavior. Digital circuits switch, spending {{most of their time}} either fully on or fully off. The transition {{from one to the other}} is only of concern with regards to speed and charge required. Analog circuits depend on operation in the transition region where small changes to Vgs can modulate the output (<b>drain)</b> <b>current.</b> The MOSFET and bipolar junction transistor (BJT) is preferred for accurate matching (of adjacent devices in integrated circuits), higher transconductance and certain temperature characteristics which simplify keeping performance predictable as circuit temperature varies.|$|E
40|$|Random dopant {{fluctuation}} {{effects of}} gate-all-around Si nanowire field-effect transistors (FETs) are investigated {{in terms of}} different diameters and junction gradients. The nanowire FETs with smaller diameters or shorter junction gradients increase relative variations of the <b>drain</b> <b>currents</b> and the mismatch of the <b>drain</b> <b>currents</b> between source-drain and drain-source bias change in the saturation regime. Smaller diameters decreased current drivability critically compared to standard deviations of the <b>drain</b> <b>currents,</b> thus inducing greater relative variations of the <b>drain</b> <b>currents.</b> Shorter junction gradients form high potential barriers in the source-side lightly-doped extension regions at on-state, which determines {{the magnitude of the}} <b>drain</b> <b>currents</b> and fluctuates the <b>drain</b> <b>currents</b> greatly under thermionic-emission mechanism. On the other hand, longer junction gradients affect lateral field to fluctuate the <b>drain</b> <b>currents</b> greatly. These physical phenomena coincide with correlations of the variations between <b>drain</b> <b>currents</b> and electrical parameters such as threshold voltages and parasitic resistances.

25|$|One {{advantage}} of the FET is its high gate to main current resistance, {{on the order of}} 100 MΩ or more, thus providing a high degree of isolation between control and flow. Because base current noise will increase with shaping time, a FET typically produces less noise than a bipolar junction transistor (BJT), and is thus found in noise sensitive electronics such as tuners and low-noise amplifiers for VHF and satellite receivers. It is relatively immune to radiation. It exhibits no offset voltage at zero <b>drain</b> <b>current</b> and hence makes an excellent signal chopper. It typically has better thermal stability than a BJT. Because they are controlled by gate charge, once the gate is closed or opened, there is no additional power draw, as there would be with a bipolar junction transistor or with non-latching relays in some states. This allows extremely low-power switching, which in turn allows greater miniaturization of circuits because heat dissipation needs are reduced compared to other types of switches.|$|E

2500|$|If drain-to-source voltage is increased, {{this creates}} a {{significant}} asymmetrical change {{in the shape of}} the channel due to a gradient of voltage potential from source to drain.

The FET is said to be in saturation mode; although some authors refer to it as active mode, for a better analogy with bipolar transistor operating regions.

We observe that the presence of such slow phenomena makes it very difficult to perform reliable low-frequency noise measurements, requiring a stable and repeatable steady-state bias point condition, and may explain the sometimes contradictory results that can be found in the literature about the dependence of the flicker noise power spectral density on gate bias...|$|R
