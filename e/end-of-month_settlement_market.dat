40|$|Abstract: We {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} the <b>settlement</b> <b>market</b> of life insurance policies on the monopolistic insurer's profit and social welfare. We assume that consumers differ only in their liquidity needs, and that the insurer cannot discriminate consumers based on their liquidity needs. When the <b>settlement</b> <b>market</b> incurs no costs, we find that the existence of the <b>settlement</b> <b>market</b> enhances social welfare. The welfare improvement comes not only from the saved costs, but also from the increased consumer bases. When the <b>settlement</b> <b>market</b> incurs costs, the results are complicated. Interestingly, social welfare can be improved, even if the <b>settlement</b> <b>market</b> is inefficient. However, {{it is also possible that}} social welfare is lowered even if the <b>settlement</b> <b>market</b> is efficient. The bottom line is that the introduction of a <b>settlement</b> <b>market,</b> regardless of its efficiency, changes the benefits and costs to the insurer's pricing strategy. Since the insurer does not fully internalize the consumer welfare, the profit maximizing strategy may fail to maximize the social welfare. Finally, the life <b>settlement</b> <b>market</b> is active as long as it is more efficient, regardless of its impact on social welfare...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} effect of life <b>settlement</b> <b>market</b> on the {{structure}} of the long-term contracts o¤ered by the primary insurance market, {{as well as on the}} consumer welfare in a dynamic model of insurance with one-sided commitment as in Hendel and Lizzeri (2003) and Daily, Hendel and Lizzeri (2008). We show that the presence of the <b>settlement</b> <b>market</b> a¤ects the extent as well as the form of dynamic reclassification risk insurance in the equilibrium of the primary insurance market; and that the <b>settlement</b> <b>market</b> generally leads to lower consumer welfare. In the most extreme form, the presence of the <b>settlement</b> <b>market</b> can completely unravel the dynamic contracts to a sequence of spot short-term contracts. We also examine the primary insurers’ response to the <b>settlement</b> <b>market</b> when they can offer enriched contracts by specifying optimally chosen cash surrender values (CSVs). We show that the option of specifying CSVs is a useless option when there is no settlement firms; but facing the threat from the settlement firms, contracts with optimally chosen health-contingent CSVs will emerge in the equilibrium of the primary market, and such contracts improve consumer welfare, even though consumer welfare is still lower than that without the secondary market. In contrast, the option to endogenously specify non-health contingent CSVs is useless for the primary insurers...|$|R
40|$|The {{similarities}} between the viatical <b>settlement</b> <b>market</b> and the standard market for insurance evoke {{the question of what}} effect asymmetric information, an oft discussed topic surrounding standard markets, might have in the viatical <b>settlement</b> <b>market.</b> In order to examine the possibility of the existence of adverse selection in this market, as well as {{to gain a better understanding}} of the dynamics of the market in general, I analyze a model describing consumer behavior in this market. Applying the results of my analysis to the logic of a classic adverse selection model, I develop and implement a test of adverse selection in the viatical <b>settlement</b> <b>market</b> using nationally representative data on viatical transactions. Additionally, I extract a new prediction from the consumer behavior model relating the probability of selling life insurance to both the policy’s face value and the policyholder’s mortality risk, and I test this prediction against data on HIV+ individuals. In the end I find that there is no empirical evidence for adverse selection in the viatical <b>settlement</b> <b>market,</b> and that the consumer behavior model is largely consistent with the data...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: We {{analyze the}} effects of life {{insurance}} settlement on the insurer’s profit and the consumer and social welfare. We consider a one-period model in which the insurance market is monopolistic and the <b>settlement</b> <b>market</b> is competitive. Policyholders face heterogeneous liquidity risks in addition to mortality risks. Liquidity risks are introduced to address the case in which policyholders need urgent cash, leading them to surrender or settle the policies. It is assumed that the insurer cannot observe the liquidity risks nor discriminate among policyholders based on liquidity risk. It is further assumed that no costs are incurred in policy surrender or settlement. We find that introduction of the life <b>settlement</b> <b>market</b> lowers monopolistic rent and insurer’s profit, and raises the insurance premium. The effects on consumer welfare and social welfare are mixed. Consumer welfare increases only when demand increases sufficiently. This finding implies that social welfare, {{as measured by the}} sum of consumer welfare and the insurer's profit, can increase if the increase in consumer welfare is greater than the decrease in insurer's profit. This finding contrasts with the existing literature, in which the <b>settlement</b> <b>market</b> lowers consumer and social welfare...|$|R

40|$|MBA thesisLife settlement, a {{transaction}} whereby the policyholder {{of a life}} insurance policy sells the future proceeds of the policy to a third party investor, has established itself as a legitimate alternative asset class in the US over the last decade.

Insurance product design, market intermediation, regulation, tax legislation, investment markets, investor rationale and more are explored through in-depth interviews with a range of industry experts. Results suggest that, in principle, there is no definitive reason why a South African life <b>settlement</b> <b>market</b> cannot exist. Across some dimensions the South African primary market may be even more conducive to life settlement transactions than the US.

40|$|The {{paper offers}} an {{explanation}} for the evolution and increasing maturity of the life <b>settlement</b> <b>market</b> and the implications for all longevity based financial instruments and products by exploring the market dynamics and asset valuation processes. The paper begins by revisiting the brief history of the life <b>settlement</b> <b>market</b> before examining the market’s evolution, finding that the increased participation in this multi-stage market has driven innovation, leading to the commoditization of various services and products which forces present service providers to either withdraw or adopt one of the operational marketing models, and lowers the barriers to entry for revolutionary service and product development. The paper then examines the value that the life settlement asset provides to both parties and establishes how that value is assessed. The paper finds that for impaired lives and specific other policies the settlement value is significantly greater than the surrender value, and that the calculation of worth to both buyer and seller must calculate both financial value and utilization value; the seller gains utilization from releasing liquidity, the buyer fro...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{economic}} model {{that allows a}} terminally ill policy-holder {{to decide whether or}} not to sell (part of) the policy in the viatical <b>settlement</b> <b>market.</b> The viatical <b>settlement</b> <b>market</b> emerged in the late 1980 s in response to the AIDS epidemic. Nowadays it is part of the large US <b>market</b> in life <b>settlements.</b> The policies traded in the viatical market are those of terminally ill policyholders expected to die within the next two years. The model is discrete and considers only the next two periods (years), since this is the max- imum remaining lifetime of the policyholder. The decisor has an initial wealth and has to share it between his own consumption and the bequests left to his heirs. We rst introduce the expected utility function of our decisor and then use dynamic programming to deduce the strategy that gives higher utility (not selling/selling (part of) the policy at time zero/selling (part of) the policy at time one). The optima depends on the value of the viaticated policy and on some personal parameters of the individual. We nd an analitical expression for the optimal strategy and perform a sensitivity analysis. expected utility, viatical settlement, dynamic programming...|$|R

Non-cash payments are intensively growing in the payment and <b>settlement</b> <b>market.</b> Modern electronic systems of interbank payments are introduced to satisfy this need. Interbank {{payment and settlement}} sector is very sensitive to changes in the market. This calls the demand to foresee adaptation of the payment and settlement system in the dynamic environment. The technological renewal of the payment and settlement system was aimed at increasing fund turnover as well as complying with the requirements applied with regard to payment systems. Such challenges make the subject of modelling and analysis of financial flows topical in interbank systems. The article presents a stochastic model for the interbank payment and settlement system and analyses possibility for optimisation of system costs. The results of application of the model developed to the analysis of the real flow of payments in the payment system are given...|$|R
