25|$|A multitiered {{network of}} transregional {{economic}} cooperation associations also was established. The Seventh Five-Year Plan (1986–90) divided China into three regions — eastern, central, and western, {{each with its}} own economic development plans. In addition to the three major regions, three echelons of economic cooperation zones were created. The first echelon — national-level economic development zones — cut across several provincial-level boundaries and linked major economic areas. Among these were the Shanghai Economic Zone, the Northeastern Economic Zone, the energy production bases centering on Shanxi Province, the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan Economic Zone, and the Southwestern Economic Zone. The second-echelon network linked provincial-level capitals with <b>designated</b> <b>ports</b> and cities along vital communication lines and included the Huaihai Economic Zone (consisting of fifteen coastal prefectures and cities in Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, and Shandong provinces) and the Pearl River Delta Economic Zone centered on the southern city of Guangzhou. The third tier of zones centered on provincial-level capitals and included the Nanjing Regional Economic Cooperation Association. Smaller-scale lateral economic ties below the provincial level, among prefectures, counties, and cities, also were formed.|$|E

50|$|When {{more than}} one bridge on a segment leads to a least-cost path to the root, the bridge with the lower bridge ID is used to forward {{messages}} to the root. The port attaching that bridge to the network segment is the <b>designated</b> <b>port</b> for the segment. In figure 4, there are two least cost paths from network segment d to the root, one going through bridge 24 and the other through bridge 92. The lower bridge ID is 24, so the tie breaker dictates that the <b>designated</b> <b>port</b> is the port through which network segment d is connected to bridge 24. If bridge IDs were equal, then the bridge with the lowest MAC address would have the <b>designated</b> <b>port.</b> In either case, the loser sets the port as being blocked.|$|R

5000|$|Breaking ties for <b>designated</b> <b>ports.</b> When {{the root}} bridge {{has more than}} one port on a single LAN segment, the bridge ID is {{effectively}} tied, as are all root path costs (all equal zero). The designated port then becomes the port on that LAN segment with the lowest port ID. It's put into Forwarding mode while all other ports on the root bridge on that same LAN segment become non-designated ports and are put into blocking mode. Not all bridge/switch manufacturers follow this rule, instead making all root bridge ports <b>designated</b> <b>ports,</b> and putting them all in forwarding mode. A final tie-breaker is required as noted in the section [...] "The final tie-breaker." ...|$|E

Cargo liners sailed from port to port along routes and on schedules published in advance.|$|E
