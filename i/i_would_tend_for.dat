Women farmers <b>would</b> <b>tend</b> crops <b>for</b> $1.20 a day, compared to the going rate of $2.00 a day for male labor. There was some resistance in the community to using women laborers. Governor Emerson Harrington gave {{a speech at the}} mansion porch in support of the efforts in July 1918. Troops were also able to live at the house and commute to war-effort jobs. Most of Baker's ships were lost in the war. He died later that year in California.|$|R
40|$|Debates {{over the}} future of the civil service are usually couched in terms of a {{trade-off}} between accountability and impartiality. If that were all at stake, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tend</b> to take the accountability side, at least insofar as government lawyers are concerned. To put the matter in the larger framework so ably developed by my colleague Steve Calabresi in this symposium, government lawyers must serve as "advocates"and "ambassadors"for the incumbent Administration's political/legal viewpoints, and these roles surely require a strong dose of accountability-stronger than one ever gets from tenured lawyers. I have argued, however, that there should be another dimension to the debate: {{what might be called the}} trade-off between transience and stability. High level tenured lawyers bring a long-term perspective to legal problems that is lacking in political lawyers. This long-term perspective generates various forms of institutional capital associated with the values of predictability, consistency, protection of reliance interests, and respect for tradition. These values are especially important in matters of government. Government ultimately rests on coercion. With the threat of coercion in the background, legal arguments will be more persuasive if they are leavened with a healthy respect for continuity with the past. Thus, political lawyers will perform more effectively if they are backstopped by high-level tenured lawyers, who bring with them a natural tendency to promote continuity. This enhanced effectiveness applies, moreover, regardless of which function political lawyers are asked to perform-including advocating the President's constitutional vision...|$|R

It was now located in 236 Utica Avenue Brooklyn, only this time they owned the whole building and no longer had to rent. When Sam's son Jerry came home, Jerry married Bernice.

60|$|That is {{by way of}} digression, only to {{show that}} we believe that a tax on a {{commodity}} is a factor in its price, which I thought was a tolerably simple proposition. What a dangerous thing it will be, year after year, to associate the idea of Empire, of our kith and kin beyond the seas, of these great, young, self-governing Dominions in which our people at present take so much pride, with an enhancement, however small, in the price of the necessary commodities of the life and the industry of Britain! It seems to me that, quite apart from the Parliamentary difficulty to which I have referred, which <b>I</b> think <b>would</b> <b>tend</b> to organise and create anti-Colonial sentiment, you would, by the imposition of duties upon the necessaries of life and of industry, breed steadily year by year, and accumulate {{at the end of a}} decade a deep feeling of sullen hatred of the Colonies, and of Colonial affairs among those poorer people in this country to whom Mr. Lloyd George referred so eloquently yesterday, and whose case, when stated, appeals to the sympathy of every one round this table.

30|$|Bias in the unchanged-pixel mean {{represents}} average phenological difference or possible {{atmospheric effects}} between acquisitions, when known causes of change (e.g. land use, fire, infestation, or snow) are avoided in sampling. If beta variation within unburned is spatially uniform (unlike Figure 7), the biased distribution is approximately normal {{with a standard}} deviation ca. < 50 (Figure 8 center). In those cases, the unchanged-pixel statistics can be used to calibrate one dNBR to another, by subtracting the bias from the dNBR dataset. Then, the adjusted unburned distribution has a mean of zero to better represent no ecological change due to fire. Figure 8 center is a case where shifting the dNBR by about + 25 points would be warranted, due to the normal distribution and relatively low standard deviation. This <b>would</b> <b>tend</b> to compensate <b>for</b> the ecological difference between scenes that was not related to fire, and make fire-caused change more directly comparable between the dNBR datasets.|$|R

40|$|Escherichia coli grew {{exponentially}} at {{a reduced}} {{rate in the}} presence of 50 or 100 Î¼g of trimethoprim/ml if the low-molecular-weight products of folate metabolism or their precursors (thymidine, purines, methionine, glycine, and pantothenate) were supplied in the medium. Folate metabolism was inhibited 99. 9 % by these concentrations of trimethoprim, but a low level of formylation of methionyl transfer ribonucleic acid (met-tRNAF) could be detected. However, in a medium containing all major amino acids, nucleosides, and vitamins, formylation of met-tRNAF was undetectable {{in the presence of}} trimethoprim. No other amino-masked amino acids were detected, and methionine remained a major amino-terminal amino acid of mature proteins. met-tRNAF was rapidly labeled with exogenous methionine and was associated with 30 s ribosomal subunits and 70 s ribosomes. It was concluded that initiation of protein synthesis can occur with unformylated met-tRNAF in E. coli. Changes in macromolecular composition were associated with the lack of formylation, in particular a fourfold increase in both met-tRNAF and ribosomal subunits. These changes <b>would</b> <b>tend</b> to compensate <b>for</b> the low specific rate of initiation with unformylated met-tRNAF...|$|R
40|$|This thesis explores {{one aspect}} of the {{relationship}} between sex and language. Twenty pairs of eleven and twelve year old children were tape-recorded during two discussion tasks. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of the data were carried out to investigate to what extent previously reported sex differences in interactional style could be observed in this group of New Zealand school children. Particular attention was paid to the relationship between such differences {{and the way in which}} children learn through talk in peer discussion. Two general hypotheses were tested: (<b>i)</b> that girls <b>would</b> <b>tend</b> to use a more collaborative, polite, and affiliative style of interaction, while boys <b>would</b> <b>tend</b> to use a more competitive, task-oriented style, paying less attention to the processes of interaction, and (ii) that the style of interaction associated with females would be more conducive to effective discussion from a pedagogical point of view. There were no significant sex differences in the use of interruptive forms and overlaps. However, the girls produced more talk relative to the boys in the mixed-sex context, supportive minimal responses were distributed differently, suggesting different norms as to their use and function, and there was a marked sex difference in the use of strategies for expressing disagreement: the boys were over four times more likely than the girls to produce bald, unmodified disagreements (approximately half of their total disagreement responses), while over 90 % of the girls' disagreement responses were qualified in some way. These differences in style were linked to the results of the qualitative analysis of the data which provided clear evidence that the sex composition of the dyads was an important variable in determining the overall quality of discussion, with the girls more likely to facilitate effective, open-ended, elaborated discussion than the boys...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a general}} notion in the {{literature}} that, with increasing latitude, trees have deeper crowns {{as a result of}} a lower solar elevation angle. However, these predictions are based on models that did not include the effects of competition for light between individuals. Here, I argue that there should be selection for trees to increase the height of the crown base, as this decreases shading by neighbouring trees, leading to an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS). Because the level of between-tree shading increases with decreasing solar angle, the predicted ESS will shift to higher crown base height. This argument is supported by a simulation model to check for the effects of crown shape and the change of light intensity that occurs with changing solar angle on model outcomes. So, the lower solar angle at higher latitudes <b>would</b> <b>tend</b> to select <b>for</b> shallower, and not deeper, crowns. This casts doubt on the common belief that a decreasing solar angle increases crown depth. More importantly, it shows that different assumptions about what should be optimized can lead to different predictions, not just for absolute trait values, but for the direction of selection itself. 8 page(s...|$|R
