40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{the use of}} the magnetic-field-dependence of highly spatially confined, GHz-frequency <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>resonances</b> in a <b>ferromagnetic</b> nanostructure for the detection of adsorbed magnetic nanoparticles. This is achieved in a large area magnonic crystal consisting of a thin ferromagnetic film containing a periodic array of closely spaced, nano-scale anti-dots. Stray fields from nanoparticles within the anti-dots modify resonant dynamic magnetisation modes in the surrounding magnonic crystal, generating easily measurable resonance peak shifts. The shifts are comparable to the resonance linewidths for high anti-dot filling fractions with their signs and magnitudes dependent upon the modes' localisations (in agreement with micromagnetic simulation results). This is a highly encouraging result for the development of frequency-based nanoparticle detectors for high speed nano-scale biosensing. Comment: 7 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

The resonance field shifts to the lower (higher) field for the magnetic field along a © axis as the temperature is decreased below 60 K, and reaches continuously in the low temperature ferromagnetic state. The frequency-field relation in the ferromagnetic state has linear correlation with the slope of g= 2 for each directions as in the conventional <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>resonances.</b> The line width also increases with decreasing temperature without motional narrowing, even in the ferromagnetic state.

In particular, when an AC field is applied perpendicular to the detection direction (called the [...] "transverse susceptibility" [...] regardless of the frequency), the effect has a peak at the <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> frequency of the material with a given static applied field.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{theoretical}} {{investigation of the}} effects of spin-orbit (SO) interactions in ferromagnetic metal nano-particles. Part I of the thesis is devoted to an elementary introduction of the research field, including recent experimental advances which partly motivated the work presented here. At the core of the thesis lie four original papers, collected in Part II, which are presented and summarized {{at the end of the}} introduction. In Paper I we introduce a microscopic tight-binding model to study the mesoscopic physics of the nanoparticle magnetocrystalline anisotropy and the hysteresis in the quasiparticle excitation spectra. The model predicts features that agree qualitatively with tunneling spectroscopy experiments, such as large fluctuations in the anisotropy energy per atom when one electron is added to the nanoparticle. Moreover, this model provides a connection between a microscopic Hamiltonian and energy-functional expressions based on classical micromagnetic theory. Paper II presents a theoretical study of the mesoscopic fluctuations of g-tensors in metal nanoparticles. The analysis is based on the tight-binding model of Paper I, and includes both spin and orbital contributions to the g-tensors. The spin contribution is shown to be in agreement with random matrix theory predictions. Furthermore, the orbital contribution in the strong spin-orbit coupling regime depends crucially on the orbital character of the quasi-particle wavefunctions. Paper III is devoted to the essential role played by SO interactions in determining the energies of the collective <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>resonances</b> and their coupling to low-energy particle-hole excitations. It is argued that a crossover between Landau-damped <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>resonances</b> and pure-state collective magnetic excitations occurs as the number of atoms in typical ferromagnetic transition metal nanoparticles drops below 10 ^ 4. This picture is supported by a RPA-type of calculation based on the model of Paper I. The significance of this picture for the interpretation of recent single-electron tunneling experiments is discussed. Paper IV addresses the regime of ultra small ferromagnetic transition-metal nanoparticles, where particle-hole and collective excitations are separable in energy. It is argued that in this regime a nanoparticle can be described by an effective Hamiltonian with a single giant spin degree of freedom. The total spin S of the effective Hamiltonian is specified by a Berry curvature Chern number that characterizes the topologically non-trivial dependence of the nanoparticle's many-electron wavefunction on magnetization orientation. These ideas are illustrated within the tight-binding model of Paper I...|$|R
40|$|Heterostructures {{consisting}} of a cuprate superconductor YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 x and a ruthenate/manganite (SrRuO 3 /La 0. 7 Sr 0. 3 MnO 3) spin valve have been studied by SQUID magnetometry, <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>resonances</b> and neutron reflectometry. It was shown that due {{to the influence of}} magnetic proximity effect a magnetic moment is induced in the superconducting part of heterostructure {{and at the same time}} the magnetic moment is suppressed in the ferromagnetic spin valve. The experimental value of magnetization induced in the superconductor has the same order of magnitude with the calculations based on the induced magnetic moment of Cu atoms due to orbital reconstruction at the superconductor-ferromagnetic interface. It corresponds also to the model that takes into account the change in the density of states at a distance of order of the coherence length in the superconductor. The experimentally obtained characteristic length of penetration of the magnetic moment into superconductor exceeds the coherence length for cuprate superconductor. This fact points on the dominance of the mechanism of the induced magnetic moment of Cu atoms due to orbital reconstruction. Comment: 20 pages, 9 figure...|$|R

40|$|Biosensing with ferromagnet-based magnetoresistive devices {{has been}} {{dominated}} by electrical detection of particle-induced changes to a device’s (quasi-) static magnetic configuration. There are however potential advantages to be gained from using field dependent, high frequency resonant magnetization dynamics for magnetic particle detection. Here, we demonstrate the use of nanoconfined <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>resonances</b> in periodically nanopatterned magnetic films for the detection of adsorbed magnetic particles having diameters ranging from 6 nm to 4 ???m. The nanopatterned films contain arrays of holes which appear to act as preferential adsorption sites for small particles. Hole-localized particles act in unison to shift the frequencies of the patterned layer’s ferromagnetic-resonance modes, with shift polarities determined by the localization of each mode within the nanopattern’s repeating unit cell. The same polarity shifts are observed for a large range of coverages, even when quasicontinuous particle sheets form above the hole-localized particles. For large particles, preferential adsorption no longer occurs, leading to resonance shifts with polarities that are independent of the mode localization, and amplitudes that are comparable to those seen in continuous layers. Indeed, for nanoparticles adsorbed onto a continuous layer, the particle-induced shift of the layer’s fundamental mode is up to 10 times less than that observed for nanoconfined modes in the nanopatterned systems, the low shift being induced by relatively weak fields emanating beyond the particle {{in the direction of the}} static applied field. This result highlights the importance of having particles consistently positioned in the close vicinity of confined modes...|$|R

50|$|Experimentally, {{there are}} many {{techniques}} that exist to study magnetic phenomena, {{each with its own}} limitations and advantages. The experimental techniques can be distinguished by being time-domain (optical and field pumped TR-MOKE), field-domain (<b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> (FMR)) and frequency-domain techniques (Brillouin light scattering (BLS), vector network analyser - <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> (VNA-FMR)). Time-domain techniques allow the temporal evolution of the magnetisation to be traced indirectly by recording the polarisation response of the sample. The magnetisation can be inferred by the so-called 'Kerr' rotation. Field-domain techniques such as FMR tickle the magnetisation with a CW microwave field. By measuring the absorption of the microwave radiation through the sample, as an external magnetic field is swept provides information about magnetic resonances in the sample. Importantly, the frequency at which the magnetisation precesses depends on the strength of the applied magnetic field. As the external field strength is increased, so does the precession frequency. Frequency-domain techniques such as VNA-FMR, examine the magnetic response due to excitation by an RF current, the frequency of the current is swept through the GHz range and the amplitude of either the transmitted or reflected current can be measured.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ferromagnetic</b> <b>resonance,</b> or FMR, is a spectroscopic {{technique}} {{to probe the}} magnetization of ferromagnetic materials. It is a standard tool for probing spin waves and spin dynamics. FMR is very broadly similar to electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and also somewhat similar to nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), except that FMR probes the sample magnetization resulting from the magnetic moments of dipolar-coupled but unpaired electrons, while NMR probes the magnetic moment of atomic nuclei that are screened by the atomic or molecular orbitals surrounding such nuclei of non-zero nuclear spin.|$|E
40|$|Co 2 MnGe {{films of}} {{different}} thicknesses (34, 55, and 83 nm) were grown by rf sputtering at 400 °C on single-crystal Al 2 O 3 corundum substrates showing an in-plane c axis. Their dynamic magnetic properties were studied using conventional and microstrip line (MS) <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>resonances</b> (FMRs), {{as well as}} Brillouin light scattering (BLS) techniques. The effective magnetizations and gyromagnetic factors are first deduced from the resonance spectra involving the uniform magnetic mode under in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic applied fields. The angular dependence of the frequency, measured under a weak in-plane magnetic applied field, then allows deriving of the parameters describing the in-plane magnetic anisotropy. In the 34 - and 55 -nm-thick films, its behavior is described assuming a magnetic energy density showing an orthorhombic symmetry with a twofold axis normal to the film and planar anisotropy axes at ±pi/ 4 of the c axis of the substrate; however, due to the comparative deduced values of the pertinent coefficients, this energy density is predominantly tetragonal. In the thickest film (83 nm), one of the planar anisotropy axes is parallel to c and approximate tetragonal symmetry is no more observed. Moreover, the orthorhombic symmetry is not completely fulfilled and a small misalignment between the principal directions connected to the uniaxial and the fourfold energy terms appears. Finally, the perpendicular surface standing modes, which are observed in MS-FMR and in BLS spectra, allow evaluation of the exchange stiffness constant. Good agreement between BLS and MS-FMR measurements has been found...|$|R
40|$|Two {{ferromagnetic}} layers magnetically decoupled by a thick normal {{metal spacer}} layer can be, nevertheless, dynamically coupled via spin currents emitted by the spin-pump and absorbed through the spin-torque effects at the neighboring interfaces. A decrease of damping in both layers {{due to a}} partial compensation of the angular momentum leakage in each layer was previously observed at the coincidence of the two <b>ferromagnetic</b> <b>resonances.</b> In case of non-zero magnetic coupling, such a dynamic exchange {{will depend on the}} mutual precession of the magnetic moments in the layers. A difference in the linewidth of the resonance peaks is expected for the acoustic and optical regimes of precession. However, the interlayer coupling hybridizes the resonance responses of the layers and therefore can also change their linewidths. The interplay between the two mechanisms has never been considered before. In the present work, the joint influence of the hybridization and non-local damping on the linewidth has been studied in weakly coupled NiFe/CoFe/Cu/CoFe/MnIr spin-valve multilayers. It has been found that the dynamic exchange by spin currents is different in the optical and acoustic modes, and this difference is dependent on the interlayer coupling strength. In contrast to the acoustic precession mode, the dynamic exchange in the optical mode works as an additional damping source. A simulation in the framework of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert formalism for two ferromagnetic layers coupled magnetically and by spin currents has been done to separate the effects of the non-local damping from the resonance modes hybridization. In our samples both mechanisms bring about linewidth changes of the same order of magnitude, but lead to a distinctly different angular behavior. The obtained results are relevant for a broad class of coupled magnetic multilayers with ballistic regime of the spin transport...|$|R

40|$|We review some of {{our recent}} results {{concerning}} the single and multiple eletromagnetic scattering by magnetic spherical particles. For a single electromagnetic scattering we show that the magnetic contribution alters, when compared to nonmagnetic scattering, {{the behavior of the}} cross sections and mean cosine of the scattering angle (á cos qñ). For <b>ferromagnetic</b> particles, <b>resonances</b> may occur even in the small-particle limit when the particle radius is much smaller than the wavelength. The resonances increase the cross-sections while á cos qñ is diminished, and even may become negative. Several quantities such the Ioffe-Regel parameter for localization are calculated for the multiple scattering regime. We show that magnetic scattering favors the observation of localization of electromagnetic waves in three dimensions. Further, this is also verified for dynamical experiments, where we show that the diffusion constant can be very small. Since the magnetic permeability of the scatterers can vary significatively around the Curie-Weiss critical temperature, experiments should be done on the microwave region and the scatterers should be soft ferrites.
