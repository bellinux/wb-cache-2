50|$|The Myriad 1 {{computer}} was mounted {{in a small}} desk format, and was far smaller than any comparable machine at the time. Eight bit paper tape was (somewhat) standard input (the software could handle data input in either the ASCII or the rather idiosyncratic KDF9 character codes) - but a high speed 1000-characters per second electrostatic reader made by Facit was capable of projecting paper tape across a room in spectacular fashion. A <b>high-speed</b> <b>printer</b> was provided. The major machine cycle time was around 800 nanoseconds, with inner cycles around 200 nanoseconds.|$|E
50|$|Though {{intended}} as a <b>high-speed</b> <b>printer,</b> the SC4020 {{could be used to}} create vector-graphical output of scientific and engineering data, rather than plotting numbers by hand. Early installations of the SC4020, with its plotter capability, were at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory in Livermore, CA and at Bell Telephone Laboratories, Incorporated in Murray Hill, NJ. The SC4020 could also be used to create computer-animated movies on a frame-by-frame basis. These computer-animated movies, usually using vector graphics, were of scientific and engineering data and also of artistic investigations, done with the 35 mm camera or the 16 mm camera. Pin-registered cameras were used for creating movies on the SC4020 to minimize jitter. Computer-animated movies using raster graphics were created on the SC4020 at Bell Labs in the early 1960s using FORTRAN and the BEFLIX subroutine language.|$|E

50|$|During the Tiananmen Square {{protests of}} 1989 the student protesters {{received}} donations from abroad. From places {{as far as}} the United States and Europe to places as close as Hong Kong, many people showed their support for the students. Many of these people showed their support not just vocally or through political channels, but also through donations. These donations came through channels such as pro-democracy fundraisers and other large events, which helped gather support for the movement. Donations included both money and other much needed supplies, such as tents and other basic necessities including food, computers, <b>high-speed</b> <b>printers,</b> and advanced communication equipment. According to Chai Ling, one of the top student leaders, in an interview that took place on May 28, 1989, these donations helped to raise the fluctuating spirits and morale of the students, giving an illusion of strength to the protesters and helping to improve the deteriorating conditions of the square.|$|R

50|$|Addition took 285 microseconds and {{multiplication}} 20 milliseconds, making arithmetic operations {{much faster}} than the Harvard Mark I. Data {{that had to be}} retrieved quickly was held in electronic circuits; the remainder was stored in relays and as holes in three continuous card-stock tapes that filled another wall. A chain hoist was needed to lift the heavy reels of paper into place. The machine read instructions or data from 30 paper tape readers connected to three punches, and another a table look-up unit consisted of another 36 paper tape readers. A punched card reader was used to load data, and results were produced on punched cards or <b>high-speed</b> <b>printers.</b> The 19-digit word was stored on the card stock tape or registers in binary coded decimal, resulting in 76 bits, with two extra bits for indicating positive or negative sign and parity, while the two side rows were used for sprockets.

He had the idea of gluing short pieces of magnetic tape to each plastic card, but the glue warped the tape, making it unusable. When he returned home, Parry's wife Dorothea was using a flat iron to iron clothes. When he explained his inability to get the tape to [...] "stick" [...] to the plastic {{in a way that would}} work, she suggested that he use the iron to melt the stripe onto the card. He tried it and it worked. [...] The heat of the iron was just high enough to bond the tape to the card. Magnetic stripes are now used on credit cards, debit cards, gift cards, stored-value cards, hotel keycards, and security identification badges.|$|R

40|$|Transcript, 42 pp. Audio file {{available}} at [URL] describes National Cash Register's (now NCR) {{early years in}} the electronic computing industry. Mumma {{went to work for}} NCR in 1939 in their newly formed Electronic Research Department. Before the war he designed gas thyratron tubes for use as decimal counters in an electronic calculator, a working model of which was completed before the war. Mumma discusses the contact NCR had during this period with MIT and Harvard, and reviews some of the early research projects and personnel at NCR. He describes in guarded terms work NCR did before the war for NDRC on a secret communication system and during the war on a high speed counter for measuring muzzle velocity of cannon shells. He recounts how war-time work on cryptanalytic equipment took all the company's effort, and how this shaped company policy resisting government contract work after the war. The second half of the interview describes NCR's move into commercial electronic computing in the 1940 s, 1950 s, and early 1960 s, with such products as cash registers with punched tape, accounting machines with electronic multiplier, <b>high-speed</b> <b>printers,</b> bar code readers, point-of-sale terminals, and magnetic ink character recognition equipment. Mumma explains how NCR considered purchasing the Eckert-Mauchly Company prior to its acquisition of Computer Research Corporation, as a way of entering the computer field. The division of labor between NCR-Dayton and the NCR-CRC division are considered, as are the difficulties of promoting, developing, and marketing electronic technology in the mechanically-oriented environment of NCR headquarters in Dayton...|$|R
