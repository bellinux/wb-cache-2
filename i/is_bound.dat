5|$|Since {{irreversible}} inhibition {{often involves}} the initial {{formation of a}} non-covalent EI complex, it is sometimes possible for an inhibitor to bind to an enzyme {{in more than one}} way. For example, in the figure showing trypanothione reductase from the human protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, two molecules of an inhibitor called quinacrine mustard are bound in its active site. The top molecule <b>is</b> <b>bound</b> reversibly, but the lower one <b>is</b> <b>bound</b> covalently as it has reacted with an amino acid residue through its nitrogen mustard group.|$|E

5|$|In blood plasma, zinc <b>is</b> <b>bound</b> to {{and transported}} by albumin (60%, low-affinity) and {{transferrin}} (10%). Because transferrin also transports iron, excessive iron reduces zinc absorption, and vice versa. A similar antagonism exists with copper.

By applying dimensional analogy, one may infer that a four-dimensional cube, known as a tesseract, <b>is</b> <b>bounded</b> by three-dimensional volumes. And indeed, this is the case: mathematics shows that the tesseract <b>is</b> <b>bounded</b> by 8 cubes. Knowing this is key to understanding how to interpret a three-dimensional projection of the tesseract. The boundaries of the tesseract project to volumes in the image, not merely two-dimensional surfaces.|$|R

According to this theory, perceptual experience <b>is</b> <b>bound</b> up in multiple conceptualizations (expectations, judgments and desires). This proliferation of conceptualizations form our illusory superimposition of concepts like self and other upon an ever changing stream of aggregate phenomena.|$|E

Loki's wife Sigyn collects the venom into a bucket, but whenever she leaves to empty it, the drops reach Loki's face, and the pain he experiences causes convulsions, resulting in earthquakes. Loki is further described as being bound this way until the onset of Ragnarök.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{enters the}} body through the {{digestive}} tract. A transporter protein on {{the cells of}} the small bowel, copper membrane transporter 1 (Ctr1; SLC31A1), carries copper inside the cells, where some <b>is</b> <b>bound</b> to metallothionein and part is carried by ATOX1 to an organelle known as the trans-Golgi network. Here, in response to rising concentrations of copper, an enzyme called ATP7A releases copper into the portal vein to the liver. Liver cells also carry the CMT1 protein, and metallothionein and ATOX1 bind it inside the cell, but here it is ATP7B that links copper to ceruloplasmin and releases it into the bloodstream, as well as removing excess copper by secreting it into bile. Both functions of ATP7B are impaired in Wilson's disease. Copper accumulates in the liver tissue; ceruloplasmin is still secreted, but in a form that lacks copper (termed apoceruloplasmin) and is rapidly degraded in the bloodstream.|$|E
5|$|Gravitational {{interaction}} with nearby stars and galactic tides modified cometary orbits {{to make them}} more circular. This explains the nearly spherical shape of the outer Oort cloud.

Recent {{studies have shown that the}} formation of the Oort cloud is broadly compatible with the hypothesis that the Solar System formed as part of an embedded cluster of 200–400 stars. These early stars likely played a role in the cloud's formation, since the number of close stellar passages within the cluster was much higher than today, leading to far more frequent perturbations.|$|E
