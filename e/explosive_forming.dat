50|$|<b>Explosive</b> <b>forming</b> is a {{metalworking}} {{technique in}} which an explosive charge is used instead of a punch or press. It {{can be used on}} materials for which a press setup would be prohibitively large or require an unreasonably high pressure, and is generally much cheaper than building a large enough and sufficiently high-pressure press; on the other hand, it is unavoidably an individual job production process, producing one product at a time and with a long setup time.|$|E

It proved particularly useful for making high-strength corrugated parts which would otherwise have to be milled out of ingots much larger than the finished product.

The {{purpose of the}} tests was twofold:(1) to determine the residual stresses resulting from <b>explosive</b> <b>forming,</b> and (2) to compare the three experimental stress analysis techniques. In addition, the tensile and fatigue strength, ductility, hardness, and stress corrosion susceptibility of the as-drawn and the explosive formed stainless steel tube materials were correlated {{to determine the effect}} of <b>explosive</b> <b>forming</b> on these properties. <b>Explosive</b> <b>forming</b> was found to completely change prior residual stress patterns. The deflection and strain gage techniques of experimental stress analysis both indicated relatively low residual stress levels in the tubes, i. e., less 15 percent of ultimate strength. The local strain technique gave similar results but the operator induced data scatter w ere much greater. The mechanical strengths were increased significantly in the explosive formed tubes, as was the susceptibility to stress corrosion. Ductility and hardness both showed significant decreases after <b>explosive</b> <b>forming.</b> In view of the increased strength resulting from <b>explosive</b> <b>forming,</b> the residual stresses in the hexagonal tubes are probably inconsequential as compared to the residual stresses in the as-drawn tubes...|$|E

Considering the important influence of improving the current <b>explosive</b> <b>forming</b> techniques on increasing the efficiency and control over the <b>explosive</b> <b>forming</b> procedure, the effects of air and water as the energy-conveying medium, and also their differences will be illustrated in this paper. Hence, {{a large number of}} <b>explosive</b> <b>forming</b> tests have been conducted on two sizes of thin walled cylindrical shells by using air and water as the working medium. Comparative diagrams of the maximum radial deflection of work-pieces of the same size, {{as a function of the}} scaled distance, show that for the points with the same values of scaled distance, the maximum radial deformation caused by the under water explosive loading is 4 to 5 times more than the deflection of the shells under <b>explosive</b> <b>forming,</b> while using air. Results of this experimental research have also been compared with other studies which show that using water as the energy conveying media increases the efficiency up to 4. 8 times. The effect of the media on failure modes of the shells, and the necking mechanism of the walls of the specimens, while being explosively loaded, are also discussed in this issue. Measuring the tested specimens shows that, the increase in the internal volume has been accompanied by necking of the walls, which finally results in the radial rupture of the structure...|$|E
