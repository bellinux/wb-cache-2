25|$|Ubiquitous as {{they are}} now at shrines, Komainu have been used {{outdoors}} only since the 14th century. In Asia, the lion was popularly believed to have the power to repel evil, and for this reason it was habitually used to <b>guard</b> <b>gates</b> and doors. In Japan, too it ended up being installed at the entrance of shrines and temples next to the lion-dog. As a protection against exposure to Japan's rainy weather, the komainu started being carved in stone.|$|E

50|$|The Nashua Manufacturing Company {{received}} a charter in the 1820s to make cloth and to trade near the Nashua River. Three {{miles from where}} the company's mills were being built, a dam was constructed at Mine Falls. A power canal was hand-dug {{under the supervision of}} James Baldwin. His idea was to change the course of the water from the river, through the <b>guard</b> <b>gates,</b> and into the canal. By the time the water reached the mills, it had enough velocity to turn the waterwheels under the building.|$|E
50|$|The lock was {{constructed}} by the Corps of Engineers from 1908-1913 {{as part of the}} Erie Canal. It has been that facility to house large Great Lakes vessels that have carried essential goods to business and industry in Western New York. The lock went through its first rehabilitation in 1975. From 1984-1986 the locks <b>guard</b> <b>gates</b> and the operating system were rehabilitated. Since the 90’s many things have been done to provide a safer work environment, such as the installation of new fencing, railing and ladders. Other things like the refurbishing of the lock houses, and the widening and capping of all concrete approach walls have been done as well.|$|E
50|$|The {{lock gates}} were 56 ft wide and 90 ft high. The locks were {{carefully}} {{designed to address}} the great variation in {{the height of the}} river, the difference between high and low water being 55 ft. This condition made it necessary to build a series of three sets of gates, increasing in height from the lower entrance to the huge upper guard gate, only two sets being used at one time. When the river was low, the upper <b>guard</b> <b>gates</b> remained open continually and the lower sets were operated. When the water rose enough to drown the lower gates, they were swung open and the lifting work was done by the others. The upper approach was formed by masonry wall extending from the guard gate in a long sweep of 1200 ft, and the bank behind was armored against floods with riprapped stone.|$|E

They range from 1 Bedrooms to 3 Bedrooms in the price range {{anywhere}} from $125,000 (for 1 bedrooms) to $900,000 (for 3 bedrooms). Eastern Shores is a guard gated community, manned by a North Miami Beach Police Officer 24 Hours 7 Days a Week. This guard house and <b>guard</b> <b>gates</b> were created in 1997. Eastern Shores is a very safe neighborhood and crimes usually never occur. Eastern Shores created their own Fire Rescue Department named Eastern Shores Fire Rescue station which is located {{right next to the}} guard house and Eastern Shores Basketball court and Playground. Eastern Shores is located right next to the Intracoastal Mall which has a Movie Theater, a frozen yogurt shop, Winn-Dixie, Kirklands Home Store, a Shoe Store, an Apparel Store, an Office Building, a Spanish Cuisine, an Italian Restaurant, a Steakhouse, and more. A couple of those restaurants, {{you will be able to}} drive your boat right up and enjoy a gourmet meal! Almost every single property in Eastern Shores has a waterfront view.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, we propose a new design flow for the {{analysis}} and the implementation of circuits on Flash-based FPGAs hardened against Single Event Effects (SEEs). The solution we developed is based on two phases: 1) an analyzer algorithm able to evaluate the propagations of SETs through logic gates; 2) a hardening algorithm able to place and route a circuit by means of optimal electrical filtering and selective <b>guard</b> <b>gates</b> insertions. The effectiveness of the proposed design flow has been evaluated by performing hardening on seven benchmark circuits and comparing the results using different implementation approaches on 130 nm Flash-based technology. The obtained results have been validated against radiation-beam testing using heavy-ions and demonstrated that our solution is able to decrease the circuits sensitivity versus SEE by two orders of magnitude with a reduction of resource overhead of 83 % with respect to traditional mitigation approache...|$|E
40|$|The aim {{with this}} thesis {{has been to}} make a survey of {{radiation}} hardened electronics, explaining why and how radiation affects electronics {{and what can be}} done to harden it. The effects radiation have on electronics in general and in specific commonly used devices are explained qualitatively. The effects are divided into Displacement Damage (DD), Total Ionizing Dose (TID) and Single Event Effects (SEEs). The devices explained are MOSFETs, Silicon On Insulator (SOI) transistors, 3 D-transistors, Power transistors, Optocouplers, Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), three dimensional circuits (3 D-ICs) and Flash memories. Different radiation hardening by design (RHBD) techniques used to reduce or to remove the negative effects radiation induces in electronics are also explained. The techniques are Annular transistors, Enclosed source/drain transistors, Guard rings, Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR), Dual Interlocked Storage Cells (DICE), <b>Guard</b> <b>gates,</b> Temporal filtering,Multiple drive, Charge dissipation, Differential Charge Cancellation (DCC), Scrubbing, Lockstep, EDAC codes and Watchdog timers...|$|E
