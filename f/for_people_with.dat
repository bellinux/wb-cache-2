5|$|Chelation {{therapy is}} used in cases of acute lead poisoning, severe poisoning, and encephalopathy, and is {{considered}} <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> blood lead levels above 25µg/dL. While the use of chelation <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> symptoms of lead poisoning is widely supported, use in asymptomatic people with high blood lead levels is more controversial. Chelation therapy is of limited value for cases of chronic exposure to low levels of lead. Chelation therapy is usually stopped when symptoms resolve or when blood lead levels return to premorbid levels. When lead exposure has taken place over a long period, blood lead levels may rise after chelation is stopped because lead is leached into blood from stores in the bone; thus repeated treatments are often necessary.|$|E

5|$|Long-term {{follow up}} by specialists in {{endocrinology}} is generally needed <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> known hypopituitarism.

5|$|There {{are many}} smaller sports clubs in Odense {{covering}} athletics, badminton, basketball, boxing, climbing, cycling, fencing, football, golf, gymnastics, handball, jujitsu, karate, riding, roller-skating, shooting, swimming, table tennis, tennis, volleyball, yoga and wrestling {{as well as}} several specialising in facilities <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> disabilities.|$|E
5|$|A racehorse {{was named}} after the paper in 1991, which was owned by a {{consortium}} of 250Echo readers. The gelding won races at Hamilton, Redcar, Newcastle upon Tyne and Haydock in the early 1990s, but {{had to be put}} down on 17 February 1996 after pulling up badly lame during a routine morning gallop. The Echo was also used in a display at the Science Museum in London in 1999, to show how writing can be made simpler <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> reading difficulties, and a specially printed edition of the newspaper appeared on the TV show Touching Evil, starring Robson Green, in the same year.|$|E

5|$|Access {{to parts}} of the station is {{difficult}} <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> physical disability. The introduction of lifts in 2010 made the taxi rank and underground station accessible from the concourse, though customers found them unreliable and frequently broken down.

5|$|Adjuvant {{chemotherapy}} {{refers to}} the use of chemotherapy after apparently curative surgery to improve the outcome. In NSCLC, samples are taken of nearby lymph nodes during surgery to assist staging. If stage II or III disease is confirmed, adjuvant chemotherapy improves survival by 5% at five years. The combination of vinorelbine and cisplatin is more effective than older regimens. Adjuvant chemotherapy <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> stage IB cancer is controversial, as clinical trials have not clearly demonstrated a survival benefit. Chemotherapy before surgery in NSCLC that can be removed surgically also appears to improve outcomes.|$|E
5|$|CPAs {{have been}} {{implemented}} {{for the management of}} a plethora of chronic disease states, including diabetes mellitus, asthma, and hypertension. Evidence suggests that CPAs have resulted in beneficial health outcomes for patients involved. It has been shown that pharmacists working with providers under CPAs help deliver higher quality of care in the setting of psychiatry to promote medication adherence, managing venous thromboembolism in outpatient clinics, and in the oncology setting, including the management of antiemetic (anti-vomiting) therapy. Within these settings, CPAs have resulted in improved attainment of goal laboratory values like hemoglobin A1c for diabetics, improved lung function for asthmatics, and improved blood pressure control <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> hypertension.|$|E

5|$|Continuous passive motion (CPM) {{has been}} used to improve healing of the {{articular}} surface during the postoperative period <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> full-thickness lesions. It has been shown to promote articular cartilage healing for small (< 3 mm in diameter) lesions in rabbits. Similarly, Rodrigo and Steadman reported that CPM for six hours per day for eight weeks produced an improved clinical outcome in humans.|$|E
5|$|Details on {{reversing}} warfarin {{are provided}} in clinical practice guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians. <b>For</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> an international normalized ratio (INR) between 4.5 and 10.0, a small dose (about 1000 mcg = one milligram) of oral vitamin K is sufficient. When warfarin is being given and INR is in therapeutic range, simple discontinuation of the drug for five days is usually enough to reverse the effect and cause INR to drop below 1.5.|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy surgery may be {{an option}} <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> focal {{seizures}} that remain a problem despite other treatments. These other treatments include at least a trial {{of two or three}} medications. The goal of surgery is total control of seizures and this may be achieved in 60–70% of cases. Common procedures include cutting out the hippocampus via an anterior temporal lobe resection, removal of tumors, and removing parts of the neocortex. Some procedures such as a corpus callosotomy are attempted in an effort to decrease the number of seizures rather than cure the condition. Following surgery, medications may be slowly withdrawn in many cases.|$|E

Streptococcal infections may also lead to acute glomerulonephritis; however, the incidence of this side effect is not reduced by the use of antibiotics.|$|E
5|$|Final {{outcomes}} <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> SCSFLS remain poorly studied. Symptoms may resolve in {{as little}} as two weeks, or persist for months. Less commonly, patients may suffer from unremitting symptoms for many years. People with chronic SCSFLS may be disabled and unable to work. Recurrent CSF leak at an alternate site after recent repair is common.|$|E
5|$|First-line {{treatment}} of AML consists primarily of chemotherapy, and {{is divided into}} two phases: induction and postremission (or consolidation) therapy. The goal of induction therapy is to achieve a complete remission by reducing the number of leukemic cells to an undetectable level; the goal of consolidation therapy is to eliminate any residual undetectable disease and achieve a cure. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is usually considered if induction chemotherapy fails or after a person relapses, although transplantation is also sometimes used as front-line therapy <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> high-risk disease. Efforts to use tyrosine kinase inhibitors in AML continue.|$|E

5|$|<b>For</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> relapsed AML, {{the only}} proven {{potentially}} curative therapy is a {{hematopoietic stem cell}} transplant, if one has not already been performed. In 2000, the monoclonal antibody-linked cytotoxic agent gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg) was approved in the United States for people aged more than 60 years with relapsed AML who are not candidates for high-dose chemotherapy. This drug was voluntarily withdrawn from the market by its manufacturer, Pfizer in 2010.|$|E
