5|$|Although {{the cavalry}} had been {{successful}} <b>in</b> <b>protecting</b> <b>the</b> park, by 1914 the average soldier was not cutout for the strenuous, diplomatic and tedious {{nature of the}} work, and {{the high level of}} training related to cavalry skills. World War I added further impetus to a transition back to civilian management, to relieve the army of a duty that could be performed by civilian rangers. In July 1914, the 1st Cavalry was withdrawn from Yellowstone and replaced with a composite unit of 200 cavalrymen from throughout the army, many of whom had served in Yellowstone previously.|$|E
5|$|Amid {{reports of}} looting, {{concerns}} were {{raised about the}} safety of the antiquities of the famous Egyptian Museum, near the epicenter of the Cairo protests. Egyptian state television announced in the evening that army commandos had secured the museum. Protesters joined soldiers <b>in</b> <b>protecting</b> <b>the</b> museum, situated beside the burning ruling party headquarters. Looters managed to enter during the night from the roof to damage a number of small artifacts, and it was initially reported that they had ripped the heads off two mummies, but subsequent reports claimed that Egypt's top archaeologist had mistaken skulls from other skeletons, and that the mummies were intact.|$|E

5|$|Jordan {{is a key}} ally of the USA and UK and, {{together}} with Egypt, {{is one of only}} two Arab nations to have signed peace treaties with Israel, Jordan's direct neighbour. Jordan views an independent Palestinian state with the 1967 borders, as part of the two-state solution and of supreme national interest. The ruling Hashemite dynasty has had custodianship over holy sites in Jerusalem since 1924, a position re-inforced in the Israel–Jordan peace treaty. Turmoil in Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa mosque between Israelis and Palestinians created tensions between Jordan and Israel concerning the former's role <b>in</b> <b>protecting</b> <b>the</b> Muslim and Christian sites in Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|King John used York Castle {{extensively}} {{during his}} reign, using the keep as his personal quarters {{for his own}} security. The castle was kept in good repair during that time. During this period, the first records {{of the use of}} the castle as a jail appeared, with references to prisoners taken during John's Irish campaigns being held at York Castle. By the 13th century there was a well-established system of castle-guards in place, under which various lands around York were granted in return for the provision of knights and crossbowmen to assist <b>in</b> <b>protecting</b> <b>the</b> castle.|$|E
5|$|Plans {{were made}} to seal off the river with a chain or a boom {{stretching}} between the blockhouse and Tilbury Fort on the other bank, which was eventually accomplished {{at a cost of}} £305. Further work was carried out on the defences, possibly including raising earthworks and establishing watch-houses. Fears of an invasion persisted for many years afterwards and in 1598 Charles Howard, the Lord High Admiral, expressed his concerns about the effectiveness of the Gravesend Blockhouse <b>in</b> <b>protecting</b> <b>the</b> Thames.|$|E

5|$|The Armenian Apostolic Church is {{the oldest}} {{national}} church in the world, and had a major role <b>in</b> <b>protecting</b> <b>the</b> Armenian identity through the centuries of foreign domination. Many Armenian communities {{in the country are}} concentrated around churches that serve as community centers. The first Armenian Apostolic church in America, named Church of Our Savior, was built in 1891 in Worcester. The American Diocese of the Church was established in 1898 by Catholicos Mkrtich Khrimian. In 1916 there were 34 Armenian parishes with 27,450 members with a predominantly male population. The top states with Armenian church followers were Massachusetts, Michigan, California and New York. The Western Diocese was established in 1927.|$|E

5|$|The early women’s {{movement}} in China focused on eradicating {{the assumption that}} women were inferior to men. The early reformers believed that women needed help to improve their own attitudes about themselves, since even the women generally considered themselves to be inferior to men. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) had shown an early interest <b>in</b> <b>protecting</b> <b>the</b> rights of women. During the 2nd National Congress in 1922, the CCP issued a statement arguing {{for the end of}} Chinese traditions that repress women. The CCP also released a formal letter ensuring equality under the law for both men and women, and guaranteed equal pay for both genders during the 3rd National Congress.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to its role <b>in</b> <b>protecting</b> <b>the</b> Thames, the fort had various military uses during the 18th century. From 1716 onwards, the Board of Ordnance began {{to use it as}} a gunpowder depot; there were safety restrictions on moving gunpowder in and out of the London docks, so Tilbury was used instead. Two large magazines were built, able to hold 3,600 barrels of powder each, and the old blockhouse and other buildings were converted to act as further magazines. Eventually the fort could hold more than 19,000 barrels of gunpowder. It was also used as a transit depot for soldiers and, after the Jacobite rising of 1745, as a prison to hold 268 Highlander prisoners of war. The Jacobite prisoners were kept in the gunpowder magazines and 45 died from typhus before they were sent on to London for trial.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>protecting</b> <b>the</b> RAF bombers, Fighter Command lost 20 fighters, 14 pilots {{killed and}} three captured. Only {{eight of the}} RAF fighters were shot down by the Luftwaffe. A further eight were shot down by AAA fire, two {{collided}} and two were lost to unknown causes. Ten of the fighters were Spitfires, six were Hawker Hurricanes and four were Westland Whirlwinds. During the air battles, mutual overclaiming took place, though the Luftwaffe was significantly worse. RAF Fighters claimed 16 Bf 109s destroyed and 13 damaged. Four Fw 190s were also claimed destroyed and six damaged. Actual German losses amounted to 17 fighters, along with five Do 217s. Human casualties amounted to 23 killed. German fighter units claimed 60 RAF aircraft shot down, with JG 26 awarded seven kills and six probable victories. Actual British losses were 41, a number of which were lost to AAA fire. III./KG 2 had participated in raids against RAF airfields. The Luftwaffe had flown 300 fighter and 40 bomber missions during the 11—12 February.|$|E
5|$|In the Main Story, Nero is a {{young man}} who lives in the castle-town of Fortuna on a mysterious island, {{isolated}} {{from the rest of the}} world. Fortuna is home to The Order of the Sword, a sect of holy knights who worship the demon Sparda as their God. Their leader, is the High Priest Sanctus, who leads the congregation as a benevolent spiritual leader, despite Nero's clear lack of faith. With the white hair and attitude not unlike a descendant of Sparda, his true parentage remains a mystery. Discovered on the island as a baby, Nero was sent to live with Credo, The Captain of the Holy Knights, who raised Nero to fight demons alongside his peaceful younger sister Kyrie, whom Nero eventually develops feelings for. Though Nero does not believe in The Order’s worship of Sparda, and openly subverts convention by using firearms, and customizing his own sword with a motorcycle handle that shoots flames, he truly believes <b>in</b> <b>protecting</b> <b>the</b> innocent.|$|E

In addition to legally-binding agreements, as discussed in Recommendation #4, all affected levels of government (local, state, tribal, etc.) must have, at a minimum, a meaningful consultative role in all other important decisions.

5|$|She {{was thought}} to have {{committed}} suicide, but took on the alias, , {{to serve as the}} leader of the Resistance before joining the group. Her desire for revenge against Archadia, for the horrors its army committed on her people, was manipulated by the Occuria to reinforce their rule over Ivalice. Along the course of the story, the Occuria created an image of the late Rasler to lead Ashe wherever they needed her to go. In their encounter, the Occuria offered her nethicite to rule as another Dynast-King, and conquer Ivalice in their stead. At the final moment, however, Ashe rejected Occuria's offer to use the nethicite. Ashe acknowledges Larsa's intention to stop the war and finally makes her way to Vayne in the Sky Fortress Bahamut to end it. A year after the Bahamut's crash, Ashe is crowned Queen of Dalmasca and eventually rejoins her friends <b>in</b> <b>protecting</b> <b>the</b> peace from the mysterious Judge of Wings in Revenant Wings. She is also featured in the rhythm game Theatrhythm Final Fantasy as a subcharacter representing Final Fantasy XII.|$|E
5|$|France, {{friendly}} towards both Russia and Austria, {{suggested a}} series of territorial adjustments, in which Austria would be compensated by parts of Prussian Silesia, and Prussia in turn would receive Polish Ermland (Warmia) {{and parts of the}} Duchy of Courland and Semigallia, a Polish fief already under Baltic German hegemony. King Frederick II of Prussia had no intention of giving up Silesia, gained recently in the Silesian Wars. He was, however, also interested in finding a peaceful solution– his alliance with Russia would draw him into a potential war with Austria, and the Seven Years' War had left Prussia's treasury and army weakened. He was also interested <b>in</b> <b>protecting</b> <b>the</b> weakening Ottoman Empire, which could be advantageously utilized {{in the event of a}} Prussian war either with Russia or Austria. Frederick's brother, Prince Henry, spent the winter of 1770–71 as a representative of the Prussian court at Saint Petersburg. As Austria had annexed 13 towns in the Hungarian Szepes region in 1769 (violating the Treaty of Lubowla), Catherine II of Russia and her advisor General Ivan Chernyshyov suggested to Henry that Prussia claim some Polish land, such as Ermland. After Henry informed Frederick of the proposal, the Prussian monarch suggested a partition of the Polish borderlands by Austria, Prussia, and Russia, with the largest share going to the party most weakened by the recent changes in balance of power, Austria. Thus Frederick attempted to encourage Russia to direct its expansion towards weak and dysfunctional Poland instead of the Ottomans. Austrian statesman Wenzel Anton Graf Kaunitz counter-proposed that Prussia take lands from Poland in return for relinquishing Silesia to Austria, but this plan was rejected by Frederick.|$|E
