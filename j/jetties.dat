5|$|The {{shifting}} Columbia Bar makes passage {{between the}} river and the Pacific Ocean difficult and dangerous, and numerous rapids along the river hinder navigation. Pacific Graveyard, a 1964 book by James A. Gibbs, describes the many shipwrecks near the mouth of the Columbia. <b>Jetties,</b> first constructed in 1886, extend the river's channel into the ocean. Strong currents and the shifting sandbar remain a threat to ships entering {{the river and}} necessitate continuous maintenance of the <b>jetties.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the 2008 Mumbai attacks, {{there had}} been a {{proposal}} to close all the <b>jetties</b> and replace them with two newer ones to be built near the Bombay Presidency Radio Club.|$|E
5|$|There {{are five}} <b>jetties</b> located around the gateway monument. The first jetty is {{exclusive}} to the Atomic Research Centre {{while the second}} and third are used for commercial ferry operations, the fourth one is closed and the fifth is exclusive to the Royal Bombay Yacht Club. The second and third <b>jetties</b> are the starting point for tours of Elephanta Caves, which is a 50-minute boat ride away by ferry. Other routes from the Gateway include ferry rides to Alibaug and Mandwa. These ferries are said to carry passengers above their certified capacity due to their popularity.|$|E
5|$|The {{power station}} {{also has a}} <b>jetty</b> (see § <b>Jetty)</b> – imports via the <b>jetty</b> ended c.1980 – in 2004 the <b>jetty</b> was trialled for the import of Tall Oil by barge.|$|R
50|$|Woody Point <b>Jetty</b> - 240 metre <b>jetty,</b> {{re-opening}} in December 2008. Original <b>jetty</b> {{was built}} in 1888 and has been reconstructed during 2008 {{at a cost of}} 9.6 million. The new <b>jetty</b> has informative displays, seating and facilities for fishing.|$|R

Like Delta State, Rivers State is a principal petroleum-producing region of Nigeria.|$|R
5|$|As {{early as}} 1881, {{industrialists}} proposed altering the natural channel of the Columbia to improve navigation. Changes {{to the river}} {{over the years have}} included the construction of <b>jetties</b> at the river's mouth, dredging, and the construction of canals and navigation locks. Today, ocean freighters can travel upriver as far as Portland and Vancouver, and barges can reach as far inland as Lewiston, Idaho.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species can}} roll {{themselves}} into a ball, a behaviour used in defence that also conserves moisture. Members of the families Ligiidae and Tylidae, commonly known as rock lice or sea slaters, are the least specialised of the woodlice for life on land. They inhabit the splash zone on rocky shores, <b>jetties</b> and pilings, may hide under debris washed up on the shore and can swim if immersed in water.|$|E
5|$|Owing to the {{proliferation}} of beaches, boat ramps and <b>jetties,</b> the West Lake is the area most used by swimmers and vessels. A bike path also surrounds the lake, and riding, walking or jogging around the lake are a popular activity on the weekends. Fireworks are often held over the lake on New Year's Eve, and a large show called Skyfire has been held at the lake since 1989.|$|E
5000|$|Also at the {{premises}} are {{the remains of}} a 13 m above sea level <b>jetty,</b> the third to be constructed. The first <b>jetty</b> was constructed in 1878 during the construction of the lighthouse, and was only 5 m high. It was destroyed in 1904 and a larger <b>jetty</b> was built. This second <b>jetty</b> was repaired and reconstructed multiple times, in 1913-1915 and 1932. Finally, the third <b>jetty</b> was built in 1959. The shore end of the <b>jetty</b> was demolished in 1986. [...] the <b>jetty</b> still stands, though most of it has rusted and fallen into the sea. A small storehouse in poor shape stands next to the <b>jetty.</b> The storehouse is the oldest building on the island, being constructed in 1879-1880.|$|R
40|$|Langkawi, officially {{known as}} Langkawi the Jewel of Kedah is an {{archipelago}} of 104 {{islands in the}} Andaman Sea, some 30 km off the mainland coast of northwestern Malaysia. It can only be accessed by using air and water transport. Generally, there are three main <b>jetty</b> terminal function as <b>jetty</b> passenger terminal was built as the entrance through the waterway to Langkawi including Kuala Perlis <b>Jetty</b> Terminal, Kuala Kedah <b>Jetty</b> Terminal and Penang <b>Jetty</b> Terminal. The three terminal <b>jetty</b> is also under the administration {{and management of the}} Marine Department of Malaysia. In this study, three of the selected terminal is Kuala Perlis <b>Jetty</b> Terminal, Kuala Kedah <b>Jetty</b> Terminal and terminal Kuah <b>Jetty</b> Terminal. Langkawi will be visited by tourists, especially during international program like Langkawi International Maritime and Aerospace Exhibition (LIMA) and Le Tour de Langkawi. The attractiveness of a tourism center to Langkawi depending on the level of maintenance at the <b>jetty</b> terminal. The Maintenance of <b>Jetty</b> Terminal To Langkawi is selected as title of Academic Project II (BSS 658). This study has been conducted to achieve the following three objectives including to study the maintenance of <b>jetty</b> terminal, to identify the user perception and satisfaction with the maintenance of <b>jetty</b> terminal and to suggest improvements of facilities of <b>jetty</b> terminal. Distribution of the questionnaire was carried out to obtain the needed data is done on the three diffent terminal <b>jetty</b> involving respondents from ferry users and staff of the Marine Department of Malaysia. The data collected is then analyzed to determine whether {{the results of this study}} is successful or not achieving the objectives. All suggestions and criticisms regarding terminal <b>jetty</b> terminal is accounted for improvement for convenience of ferry users...|$|R
25|$|The first {{classification}} {{is a type}} 1 <b>jetty.</b> This type of <b>jetty</b> {{is significantly}} longer than the surf zone width and the waves break at the shore end of the <b>jetty.</b> The effect of a Type 1 <b>jetty</b> is sediment accumulation in a wedge formation on the <b>jetty.</b> These waves are large and increase in size as they pass over the sediment wedge formation. An example of a Type 1 <b>jetty</b> is Mission Beach, San Diego, California. This 1000-meter <b>jetty</b> was installed in 1950 {{at the mouth of}} Mission Bay. The surf waves happen north of the <b>jetty,</b> are longer waves, and are powerful. The bathymetry of the sea bottom in Mission Bay has a wedge shape formation that causes the waves to refract as they become closer to the <b>jetty.</b> The waves converge constructively after they refract and increase the sizes of the waves.|$|R
5|$|As {{the islands}} have no {{harbours}} or anchorages, the phosphate ships were loaded by securing to deep moorings and embarking their cargo via cantilever <b>jetties.</b> During south-westerly wind periods—which are common from November to March—the ships {{had to stop}} loading and sail away from the island until conditions improved. It was common for these ships {{to be allowed to}} drift to save fuel, and there were often several vessels lying off Nauru.|$|E
5|$|Until 1928, the Indian River Inlet was {{a natural}} {{waterway}} that shifted {{up and down a}} two-mile (3.2km) stretch of the coast. Dredging kept the inlet open in its current location between 1928 and 1937, and in 1938 the United States Army Corps of Engineers built <b>jetties</b> that hold it in place. With the inlet in a fixed place, it became possible after 1928 to build a bridge to span it, and the completion of the Ocean Highway in 1933 prompted Delaware to build a span to connect the northern and southern segments of the highway.|$|E
5|$|As a whole, {{pinnipeds}} can {{be found}} in a variety of aquatic habitats, including coastal water, open ocean, brackish water and even freshwater lakes and rivers. Most species inhabit coastal areas, though some travel offshore and feed in deep waters off oceanic islands. The Baikal seal is the only freshwater species, though some ringed seals live in freshwater lakes in Russia close to the Baltic sea. In addition, harbor seals may visit estuaries, lakes and rivers and sometimes stay as long as a year. Other species known to enter freshwater include California sea lions and South American sea lions. Pinnipeds also use a number of terrestrial habitats and substrates, both continental and island. In temperate and tropical areas, they haul-out on to sandy and pebble beaches, rocky shores, shoals, mud flats, tide pools and in sea caves. Some species also rest on man-made structures, like piers, <b>jetties,</b> buoys and oil platforms. Pinnipeds may move further inland and rest in sand dunes or vegetation, and may even climb cliffs. Polar-living species haul-out on to both fast ice and drift ice.|$|E

50|$|<b>Jetty</b> {{was started}} in 1995 and was hosted by MortBay, {{creating}} version 1.x and 2.x, until 2000. From 2000 to 2005, <b>Jetty</b> was hosted by sourceforge.net where version 3.x, 4.x, and 5.x were produced. In 2005, the entire <b>Jetty</b> project moved to codehaus.org. As of 2009, the core components of <b>Jetty</b> have been moved to Eclipse.org, and Codehaus.org continued to provide integrations, extensions, and packaging of <b>Jetty</b> versions 7.x and 8.x (not 9.x) In 2016, the main repository of <b>Jetty</b> moved to Github, {{but it is still}} developed under the Eclipse IP Process.|$|R

5|$|Facilities at Giant's Grave improved, and {{included}} <b>jetties</b> to enable ships' ballast to be landed and dumped, {{rather than being}} thrown overboard. This latter approach had caused problems at Newport for the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal, where ballast had been thrown into the river, and at Cardiff for the Glamorganshire Canal, {{where it had been}} thrown into the canal basin. Efforts were also made to improve the facilities at Neath. From 1818, a Harbour Board was established, and banks of copper slag, marked with buoys, were used to confine the channel. This enabled ships of over 300 tons to reach Neath quays on spring tides, although on neap tides Giant's Grave still had to be used. From 1824, when the connection to the Tennant Canal opened, much of the trade crossed the river and passed down the western bank to the port of Swansea.|$|E
5|$|The {{fighting}} {{occurred after}} a company-sized Australian force from the 31st/51st Infantry Battalion made an amphibious landing {{north of the}} Porton Plantation <b>jetties</b> {{in an attempt to}} outflank the Japanese positions on the Ratsua front, which were holding up the advance of the 26th and the 31st/51st Infantry Battalions from the 11th Brigade. The Australians landed unopposed and established a small perimeter, but some of their landing craft ran aground and they were unable to bring their heavy weapons and support elements ashore. Troops from the Japanese 87th Naval Garrison Force quickly surrounded the beachhead and, as their supply situation grew desperate, the Australians were forced to withdraw. In the course of their evacuation by sea another landing craft ran aground. Over the next two days several unsuccessful rescue attempts were made until eventually, in the early morning of 11 June, the last Australian survivors were picked up.|$|E
5|$|Development of Lae as a port, on {{the other}} hand, was envisaged from the start; but when the town was captured, the port was blocked by sunken barges and debris. The only {{discharge}} facilities were two rickety <b>jetties</b> unable to hold trucks. The first cargo was delivered by LST, and brought ashore over the beach by DUKWs, LCMs and lighters. Australian and American DUKWs were operated as a common pool. Initially, the US Navy would only allow the LSTs to arrive at night, {{and they had to}} shove off before daybreak. Only in November did it allow them to operate in daylight. Sunken Japanese barges were cleared away by a 150-ton floating crane. American engineers then installed a floating dock, which was towed to Lae in sections. It opened on 20 October, and a Type C1 ship, the Cape Kreig, discharged there that day. A new dock was completed on 23 November, although it was used to unload the Liberty ship Fremont Older on 15 November. A fuel jetty was built, along with a bulk petroleum storage facility, and the first tanker discharged there on 20 November. A 4-inch pipeline was run through to Nadzab.|$|E

50|$|Brighton is {{the home}} of the Brighton <b>Jetty</b> Classic, an Open Water Swim made up of the 1500 metre Brighton <b>Jetty</b> Classic Swim and the 400 metre <b>Jetty</b> Swim, aimed at first time open water swimmers. The Brighton <b>Jetty</b> Classic had its first year in 2006 when {{approximately}} 800 swimmers successfully completed the event. It is an annual event, being hosted on the first Sunday in February. The 2010 event had over 1200 swimmers, making it the largest open water swim in South Australia. The course is around the Brighton <b>Jetty,</b> which makes the <b>Jetty</b> a fantastic viewing platform for spectators.|$|R

5|$|In July, Furious {{embarked}} nine Fulmars of 800 Squadron, 'A' Flight of 880 Squadron {{with four}} Sea Hurricane IBs, nine Swordfish from 812 Squadron and nine Albacores of 817 Squadron {{to attack the}} German-occupied ports of Kirkenes, Norway, and Petsamo, Finland, departing Scapa Flow on the 23rd in company with the carrier , two cruisers and six destroyers. The two carriers and their escorts gathered in Seidisfjord, Iceland, {{under the command of}} Rear Admiral Wake-Walker where they refuelled in late July. Furious attacked ships in Petsamo on 30 July with all of her Swordfish and Albacores, escorted by six Fulmars and all four Sea Hurricanes, but there was very little shipping present. One small ship, MV Trotter, was sunk, several oil storage tanks were set afire, and several wooden <b>jetties</b> were torpedoed. The British ships had been spotted before the attack and two Fulmars and an Albacore were shot down by the alerted defences. Furious was short of fuel and had to leave shortly afterwards, but she transferred her Albacores to Victorious to fill up that carrier's decimated squadrons before she left. Sea Hurricanes of 880 Squadron shot down a shadowing Dornier Do 18 flying boat on 31 July as the ship was leaving.|$|E
25|$|<b>Jetties</b> {{are added}} to bodies of water to {{regulate}} erosion, preserve navigation channels, and make harbors. <b>Jetties</b> are classified into four different types and have two main controlling variables: the type of delta {{and the size of}} the jetty.|$|E
25|$|In 1890 the Aransas Pass & Harbor Company, under {{government}} contracts, {{launched a}} plan to deepen the channel through the pass and over the sandbar. The plan called {{for the construction of}} two brand new <b>jetties</b> but the plan failed to increase the depth of the channel. Another plan was put into action, calling for the blasting of the channel with thousands of pounds of dynamite, but this also failed. The newest <b>jetties,</b> and shallow draft would have to stay as they were for the time being.|$|E
50|$|The first Brighton <b>Jetty</b> {{was built}} in 1886 and {{weathered}} the sea and storms for over 100 years. The Brighton <b>jetty</b> was badly damaged by winter storms in the 1994.

50|$|In {{earlier years}} such produce was {{exported}} from Cowell {{by means of}} sailing ketches. The first <b>jetty</b> at Cowell was built in 1881, and although several extensions were added later, it was still of an inadequate length. A new main <b>jetty</b> was opened in 1913 but the old <b>jetty</b> remained until demolished in 1975. The old <b>jetty</b> was then replaced by a structure on concrete piles with wood deck, some 146 metres long, known as the fishermen's <b>jetty.</b>|$|R

25|$|Human {{activities}} such as dam construction can interfere with natural sediment flows (thereby reducing riverine sediment sources.) Construction of littoral barriers such as <b>jetties</b> and deepening of inlets can prevent longshore sediment transport.|$|E
25|$|Diffraction {{can occur}} {{with any kind}} of wave. Ocean waves {{diffract}} around <b>jetties</b> and other obstacles. Sound waves can diffract around objects, which is why one can still hear someone calling even when hiding behind a tree.|$|E
25|$|It also {{operates}} passenger {{ships to}} Colombo and Lakshadweep. Boat services are operated by Kerala Shipping and Inland Navigation Corporation, the State Water Transport Department and private firms from various boat <b>jetties</b> in the city. The junkar ferry for the transshipment of vehicles and passengers between the islands are operated between Ernakulam and Vypin, and between Vypin and Fort Kochi. However, {{with the construction}} of the Goshree bridges (which links Kochi's islands), ferry transport has become less essential. The main boat <b>jetties</b> are Ernakulam Main Boat Jetty near Park Avenue, High Court Jetty in Banerjee Road, Embarkation Jetty in Willingdon Island and Fort Kochi Jetty.|$|E

50|$|Construction {{of a new}} <b>jetty</b> of 240 {{m length}} located 50 m east of the BHP <b>jetty</b> was {{completed}} in 2009 to replace the public amenity lost by the progressive closure of the BHP <b>jetty.</b>|$|R
50|$|A <b>jetty</b> is {{an upper}} floor {{that depends on}} a {{cantilever}} system in which a horizontal beam, the <b>jetty</b> bressummer, supports the wall above and projects forward beyond the floor below (a technique also called oversailing). The bressummer (or breastsummer) itself rests {{on the ends of}} a row of <b>jetty</b> beams or joists which are supported by <b>jetty</b> plates. <b>Jetty</b> joists in their turn were slotted sideways into the diagonal dragon beams at angle of 45° by means of mortise and tenon joints.|$|R
