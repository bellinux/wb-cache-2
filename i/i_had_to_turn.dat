2500|$|In 2009, Lords {{appeared}} in the direct-to-DVD science fiction movie, Princess of Mars, alongside Antonio Sabàto, Jr. She later regretted making the movie saying: [...] "Somewhere in my heart of hearts I was worried that I might be doing something wrong but I believed the voices of those around me who said 'No, it'll be artistic, no it'll be creative. You'll look beautiful. We have a very limited budget but honest, you'll be proud.' And it was bad, very bad. At least that was what I was told. After watching the first two minutes <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> it off and hide under the covers." ...|$|E
2500|$|On June 19, 2007, Fator {{made his}} first {{national}} appearance on America's Got Talent. Speaking on the experience, Fator said, [...] "Not in my wildest dreams did I imagine I would win that show...Essentially I auditioned because the guy that was the ventriloquist the first season got on Late Show with David Letterman... So I figured I'd do three episodes like he did and end up on 'David Letterman.'" [...] After winning the show, Fator actually had to turn the Letterman gig down fourteen times before his schedule was clear so he could appear. [...] "My schedule got so packed, and it broke my heart every time <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> him down," [...] Fator says.|$|E
6000|$|... "Fact, and {{the next}} morning <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> my shoes inside out to {{accommodate}} the socks," [...] finished Whopper. [...] "Yes, that was a wind to remember." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He shall tell me!" [...] {{he muttered}} to himself, [...] "or I will expose him, if <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> detective and follow him round the world." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then the Atterby-Smiths {{leave on}} Monday if <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> {{them out of}} the house. So we shall get one evening clear at any rate. Stop a minute," [...] and she rang the bell.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{be damned}} if I'm going to quit," [...] he said to himself, [...] "if <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> street-sweeper. There must be some job {{here in the city}} that I am capable of filling, and I'm pretty sure that I can at least get a job as office-boy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear," [...] said Leland hoarsely, [...] "I {{have never}} regretted it, and I {{would not even}} if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> {{teamster}} and let Prospect go, except for the trouble it would bring you." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{found the}} {{forecastle}} of the Spitfire {{a dark and}} rather unwholesome place. The ventilation was bad, {{and the smell of}} tar and oakum was so strong that for a moment <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> away to catch my breath.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{never would}} leave me. He {{absolutely}} drove {{me out of}} the country because he would follow me about when we were hunting. He insulted me so grievously that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> tail and run away from him. What did he want of me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The thing's {{perfectly}} simple. You're going {{north in}} her. In {{one or two}} respects I'm sorry <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> you out, but, to be quite straight, you're {{not the kind of}} man I want beside me now. You're too fond of company, and have a--inconvenient habit of talking in your cups." ...|$|R
5000|$|The final {{chapters}} {{contain an}} inter-office memo concerning Ted's treatment and prognosis {{at the hospital}} {{where he is now}} a patient, and a letter from one of Charlie's friends describing assorted developments in the students' lives during the months following this incident. The story ends with Charlie addressing the reader: [...] "That's the end. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> off the light now. Good night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But till {{that time}} shall come, my lord, I shall hold my own at Hogglestock as you hold your own here at Barchester. Nor have you more power <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> {{me out of}} my pulpit by your mere voice, than <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> you out of your throne by mine. If you doubt me, my lord, your lordship's ecclesiastical court is open to you. Try it there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You needn't be worried," [...] the invalid replied. [...] "Now my leg doesn't ache so bad, I {{can keep}} mighty still, {{no matter what}} happens. Yesterday <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> over pretty often to rest it, an' was 'fraid {{sometimes}} the folks would hear me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do: Colligan {{got drunk}} here one night. He {{wanted me to}} give him a farm, and said cursed queer things about my sister. I hardly know what he said; but I know <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> him out of the house, and there was a {{scrimmage}} between us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, a cow!" [...] {{answered}} Ben, and {{his tone}} showed his deep disgust. [...] "I {{was going down}} the hill just as nicely as you please when along came a cow. A man was driving her, {{and when he saw}} us coming he did his best to get the cow out of our way. But that mooly didn't budge {{from the middle of the}} road, so <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> to one side--and this is the consequence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am very sorry, Monsieur, but to-night {{every place}} is taken. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> others away already," [...] he declared. [...] "A {{thousand}} regrets." ...|$|R
5000|$|How {{very like}} the future this place might be: a tiny world just {{big enough to}} support the cubicle of one Knowledge Worker. I feel a wave of {{loneliness}} and head back down. But I'm going too fast. I plunge right on through the office floor and into the bottomless indigo below. Suddenly I can't remember how <b>to</b> stop and <b>turn</b> around. Do I point behind myself? Do <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> around before <b>I</b> can point? I flip into brain fugue.|$|R
2500|$|Keane {{has done}} media work but {{expressed}} {{his lack of}} enthusiasm to do so again in future when he said, [...] "I was asked last week by ITV to do the Celtic game," [...] he said. [...] "A {{couple of weeks before}} that I was asked to do the United game against Celtic at Old Trafford. I think I've done it once for Sky. Never again. I'd rather go to the dentist. You're sitting there with people like Richard Keys and they're trying to sell something that's not there." [...] Keane added, [...] "Any time I watch a game on television <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> the commentators off".|$|R
6000|$|... [Picture: Boot] Of course <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> every mortal {{thing out}} now, and, of course, I {{could not find}} it. I rummaged the things up into much the same state that {{they must have been}} before the world was created, and when chaos reigned. Of course, I found George’s and Harris’s {{eighteen}} times over, but I couldn’t find my own. I put the things back one by one, and held everything up and shook it. Then I found it inside a boot. I repacked once more.|$|E
60|$|The {{effect was}} electrical, since our attackers {{had never seen}} {{anything}} of the kind before. For a while they all drew off, which gave me time to reload. Then they came on again and I repeated the process. For a second time they retreated and after consultation which lasted for a minute or more, made a third attack. Once more I saluted them {{to the best of my}} ability, though on this occasion only three men and a horse fell. The fifth shot was a clean miss because they came on in such a scattered formation that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> from side to side to fire.|$|E
60|$|I {{reckoned}} that at {{the rate}} of walking of a team of oxen we covered about two miles an hour. Therefore, when I was sure that {{two and a half hours}} had passed--such hours, my friends, cramped, suffocated, and nearly poisoned with the fumes of the lees--when they had passed, I was sure that the dangerous open country was behind us, and that we were upon the edge of the forest and the mountain. So now <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> my mind upon how I was to get out of my barrel. I had thought of several ways, and was balancing one against the other when the question was decided for me in a very simple but unexpected manner.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} on 89.3 The Current, front man Justin Vernon was questioned about current plans for the band and expressed their desire to take a break: [...] We're winding it down. I {{look at it like}} a faucet. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> it off and walk away from it because so much of how that music comes together is subconscious or discovering. There’s so much attention on the band, it can be distracting at times. I really feel the need to walk away from it while I still care about it. And then if I come back to it - if at all - I'll feel better about it and be renewed or something to do that.|$|R
5000|$|Constantine <b>I,</b> said <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been <b>turned</b> into a stone statue, {{although}} not resting within a mountain ...|$|R
5000|$|On September 25, 2012, Vernon {{walked away}} from Bon Iver temporarily, {{virtually}} {{putting an end to}} the band for the time being. When asked for reasoning, he replied, [...] " [...] I'm winding it down.

60|$|Thus <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> out my fine gowns (grown all {{too tight}} for me) and betake {{me to the}} Queen, who had become a little old woman, but was as gay and kind as ever, and told me much about my mother and sister. The King himself came and spoke to me, and said he {{supposed}} I wished to have the old title revived; but I told him, with all thanks, that I liked my husband better by his own name than by that which I had rather leave sacred to my brother; whereat he laughed, and said he must make a low bow to me, as being the first person he had met who had nothing to ask from him.|$|E
6000|$|Mavovo, it is true, {{remained}} cheerful. His {{faith in}} his [...] "Snake" [...] was really touching. He offered {{to go through that}} divination process again in our presence and demonstrate that there was no mistake. I declined because I had no faith in divinations, and Stephen also declined, for another reason, namely that the result might prove to be different, which, he held, would be depressing. The other Zulus oscillated between belief and scepticism, as do the unstable who set to work to study the evidences of Christianity. But Sammy did not oscillate, he literally howled, and prepared the food which poured in upon us so badly that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> on Hans to do the cooking, for however little appetite we might have, it was necessary that we should keep up our strength by eating.|$|E
60|$|I saw her again, years afterward, {{when she}} was a married woman playing with her children. She stamped her foot at a naughty one, and I saw the gleam of her teeth as she gnashed them in the dear pretty way I can't forget; and then a boy and girl, {{fighting}} for her shoulders, brought the whole group joyously to the ground. She picked herself up in the old leisurely manner, lazily active, and looked around her benignantly, like a cow: our dear wild one safely tethered at last with a rope of children. I meant to make her my devoirs, but, as I stepped forward, the old wound broke out afresh, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> away. They were but a few poor drops, which fell because I found that she was even a little sweeter than I had thought.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nor <b>have</b> <b>I.</b> What {{can we do}} but pity each other, and {{swear that}} we will be friends,--dear friends. There is the oak-tree and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> got <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> back. We <b>have</b> said {{everything}} that we can say,--unless you will tell me that you will be my brother." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That was beautifully done," [...] Margery {{called back}} to him. [...] "Now <b>I</b> <b>have</b> room enough <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> around without any trouble at all." ...|$|R
40|$|Compost happens! ” Perhaps {{you have}} seen this {{statement}} printed on t-shirts or in farm-related magazines. Each time I read this I am always left bewildered: Yes, compost happens, but how? Even after surveying the vast technical literature, one might still ask: What is compost? Do <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> it? Should <b>I</b> layer everything or mix it? How do I know {{if it is good}} or not? How do I know it is ready? And did it really happen? Ehrenfried Pfeiffer, one of the pioneer's of the bio-dynamic movement, wrote: There is not just one compost for everything, nor is all the organic material or waste (from the moment it arrives in the dump or compost yard, and on through all stages of fermentation and decay) yet to be defined as compost...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's a title," [...] {{explained}} Baldy, [...] "up {{among the}} picture-cards; but it don't take no tricks. I'll tell you, Webb. It's a brand they're got for certain animals in Europe. Say that {{you or me}} or one of them Dutch dukes marries in a royal family. Well, by and by our wife gets to be queen. Are we king? Not in a million years. At the coronation ceremonies we march between little casino and the Ninth Grand Custodian of the Royal Hall Bedchamber. The only use we are is to appear in photographs, and accept {{the responsibility for the}} heir- apparent. That ain't any square deal. Yes, sir, Webb, you're a prince- consort; and if I was you, I'd start a interregnum or a habeus corpus or somethin'; and I'd be king if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> {{from the bottom of the}} deck." ...|$|E
6000|$|Orion did {{not come}} to Hannibal until two or three years after my father's death. Meantime he {{remained}} in St Louis. He was a journeyman printer and earning wages. Out of his wage he supported my mother and my brother Henry, who was two years younger than I. My sister Pamela helped in this support by taking piano pupils. Thus we got along, but it was pretty hard sledding. I was not one of the burdens, because I was taken from school at once, upon my father's death, and placed {{in the office of the}} Hannibal [...] "Courier," [...] as printer's apprentice, and Mr. S., the editor and proprietor of the paper, allowed me the usual emolument of the office of apprentice--that is to say board and clothes, but no money. The clothes consisted of two suits a year, but one of the suits always failed to materialize and the other suit was not purchased so long as Mr. S.'s old clothes held out. I was only about half as big as Mr. S., consequently his shirts gave me the uncomfortable sense of living in a circus tent, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> up his pants to my ears to make them short enough.|$|E
6000|$|The Brownville House dined early, {{and after}} dinner {{the next day}} Miss Maynard, {{who had not been}} at table, came to me on the veranda, attired in the demurest of walking costumes, saying not a word. [...] "He" [...] was evidently [...] "not about." [...] We went slowly up the road that led to the Old Mill. She was {{apparently}} not strong and at times took my arm, relinquishing it and taking it again rather capriciously, I thought. Her mood, or rather her succession of moods, was as mutable as skylight in a rippling sea. She jested as if she had never heard of such a thing as death, and laughed on the lightest incitement, and directly afterward would sing a few bars of some grave melody with such tenderness of expression that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> away my eyes lest she should see the evidence of her success in art, if art it was, not artlessness, as then I was compelled to think it. And she said the oddest things in the most unconventional way, skirting sometimes unfathomable abysms of thought, where I had hardly the courage to set foot. In short, she was fascinating in a thousand and fifty different ways, and at every step I executed a new and profounder emotional folly, a hardier spiritual indiscretion, incurring fresh liability to arrest by the constabulary of conscience for infractions of my own peace.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{might be}} a sort of {{protection}} for me, if you remained in it,' said Mr Boffin; 'you might stand betwixt him and me, and take the edge off him.

6000|$|... "Now, Tom, <b>I</b> reckon you'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> {{around and}} help me take these youngsters to the sheriff. <b>I</b> would rather <b>have</b> them in your wagon than on horseback." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, <b>I</b> reckon you'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> back!" [...] cried Nat Poole, in triumph, {{after so}} much had been piled in the roadway that passing was {{totally out of}} the question.|$|R
