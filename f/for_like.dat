25|$|Franklin saw the {{printing}} press as a device to instruct colonial Americans in moral virtue. Frasca argues he saw this as a service to God, because he understood moral virtue in terms of actions, thus, doing good provides a service to God.

He tried to influence American moral life through construction of a printing network based on a chain of partnerships from the Carolinas to New England. Franklin thereby invented the first newspaper chain. It {{was more than a}} business venture, <b>for</b> <b>like</b> many publishers since, he believed that the press had a public-service duty.|$|E
25|$|Whether or {{not this}} or indeed any so called 'super-dairy' is ever built, this {{controversy}} {{is likely to have}} a lasting impact on Britain's future dairy policy. Supporters claim large scale farming offers opportunities to meet food security and climate change challenges of the future. Research by opponents counter this hypothesis with an argument that the economics of the system are unsustainable in a report titled: ''; however, the figures used in this report have also been heavily criticised by the industry's leading providers of economics data DairyCo, part of the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board, saying that the different systems are not being compared on a like <b>for</b> <b>like</b> basis and are ‘astonishingly naïve’. However, there are concerns that any similar proposal, if successful, would set a precedent for the development of large-scale farming systems more commonly associated with the US where such units are known as CAFOs - although with the definition of a dairy CAFO being over 750 cows, , the dairy industry's levy and advisory body, says there are already at least 12 such farms operating successfully and without issues - as proven by the lack of media interest in these farms - in England.|$|E
