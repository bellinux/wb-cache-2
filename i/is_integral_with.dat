2500|$|The {{eccentric}} rod provides motion {{to the expansion}} link (7) which is pivoted in a central location back {{to the body of}} the locomotive. The expansion link holds the radius bar (8), captive by a die block [...] which <b>is</b> <b>integral</b> <b>with</b> the radius bar but is free to move vertically in a constrained curved path along the expansion link.|$|E
2500|$|The {{island of}} Luzon is {{bisected}} by the braided N-S trending Philippine Fault System. [...] Luzon is not bisected E-W, and illustrations showing anything similar are erroneous. Northern Luzon <b>is</b> <b>integral</b> <b>with</b> southern Luzon. Any suggestion that Northern Luzon {{is not part}} of the Philippine Mobile Belt is not borne out by the detailed fault mapping of Pinet and Stephan (1989), and others. [...] A common tectonic plate illustration for the Philippines is incorrect in this regard.|$|E
2500|$|The single-seat Kittiwake I {{monoplane}} {{was designed}} for sports flying and as a glider tug. It is an all-metal aircraft, with low [...] cantilever wings of parallel chord built around a single spar carrying 5° of dihedral. NACA single slotted flaps occupy {{the whole of the}} trailing edge inboard of the ailerons. The wings attach to a centre section which <b>is</b> <b>integral</b> <b>with</b> the fuselage, a feature intended to help construction in a small space like a garage. [...] The straight tapered fin carries a horn balanced rudder and the constant chord tailplane has a starboard side trim tab.|$|E

50|$|The 3-speed {{and reverse}} gearbox <b>was</b> <b>integral</b> <b>with</b> the engine, {{and had a}} variety of ratios {{depending}} on application. A four-speed gearbox was introduced in 1932 and in 1933 synchromesh was added to third and top ratios extending to second gear in 1934.|$|R
2500|$|Based on the G36, Heckler & Koch {{also created}} the {{semi-automatic}} SL8 rifle and the straight-pull, bolt-action R8, which are {{offered to the}} civilian sport shooting markets. The SL8 is substantially different from the G36, it has a modified receiver and a thumbhole stock with a cheek rest, which <b>is</b> <b>integral</b> <b>with</b> the trigger group. The SL8 has a heavy profile, extended, [...] barrel {{that does not have}} a flash hider or bayonet lug. The rifle uses a 10-round single-stack magazine and an extended top rail used to mount a wide variety of Picatinny-standard optics. Mounted to the rail are a set of iron sights with a hooded foresight and adjustable flip rear aperture. The SL8 can also mount the G36 carry handle and integrated sight assembly, after removing the mechanical iron sights. The SL8 has an unloaded weight of 4.3kg, overall length of 980–1030mm and a trigger rated at 20 N.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} of the Sherwood Ranger has an {{aluminium tube}} structure, with ply formers and spruce stringers, and is fabric covered apart from glass fibre mouldings {{in the engine}} and cockpit areas and forming the rear decking. [...] The nose is quite slender; the separate open cockpits are {{in tandem with the}} forward one a little behind {{the leading edge of the}} wing and the other under the trailing edge, where a slight upper wing cut-out improves the pilot's view. [...] The fin <b>is</b> <b>integral</b> <b>with</b> the fuselage structure and carries a deep, rounded rudder which extends to the lower fuselage. [...] The tailplane, mounted on top of the fuselage, has an unusually low aspect ratio and is almost semicircular in plan. These horizontal surfaces are thin and without camber. Separate elevators allows rudder movement between them. The tailplane is braced to the top of the fin and to the fuselage bottom. The fixed conventional undercarriage has mainwheels, fitted with brakes, on split axles mounted from a bungee [...] sprung compression frame below the central fuselage and hinged by faired, V-form legs to its lower longerons. [...] There is a bungee sprung, castoring tailwheel.|$|E

50|$|The sharply swept fin (used to {{increase}} control power and stability {{with a smaller}} fuselage, reducing weight), <b>was</b> <b>integral</b> <b>with</b> the fuselage and supported the plywood skinned tail plane at approx ⅓ fin span.

50|$|The fin <b>was</b> <b>integral</b> <b>with</b> the {{fuselage}} and also skinned with plywood.

50|$|The {{fuselage}} of the Tagak was a {{wood and}} plywood framed semi-monocoque skinned with Wobex and ply. Its cabin, behind the 185 hp Lycoming flat six engine, was 3.26 m (10 ft 6 in) {{long to the}} rear of the pod. There were two front seats under the wing leading edge, two more behind and room for one or two (stacked) stretcher cases. The cabin had two windows on each side and the rear part of the pod, which projected behind the wing trailing edge, was also extensively glazed. The two tail booms, of all ply construction, <b>were</b> <b>integral</b> <b>with</b> the wing centre section. The fins, with long chord underside fillets, <b>were</b> <b>integral</b> <b>with</b> the booms. The tailplane was rectangular and extended beyond the fins, carrying a horn balanced elevator. The fixed surfaces were of wood and ply construction, with Wobex covering; control surfaces were fabric covered.|$|R

50|$|The soft skirted {{full face}} mask is the more common arrangement, and is {{generally}} considerably lighter and more compact than the band masks.

This is mounted in a steel frame which <b>is</b> <b>integral</b> <b>with</b> the fixed cantilever main undercarriage and its optionally streamlined, tapering legs and faired wheels. This arrangement places the main landing gear further forward than usual, providing a drag moment to oppose that of the fin in vertical flight. The tailwheel is steerable.|$|E

50|$|Electrification {{had been}} {{discussed}} over many decades {{but in the}} late 1950s it became a definite intention. The Cathcart circle was to be resignalled and electrified.
