40|$|The {{study period}} (i. e., 1999 - 2014) is {{characterized}} by declining labor force participation rates, rising disability enrollment, varying <b>healthcare</b> utilization, <b>and</b> increasing and changing composition of healthcare provider employment. However, {{little is known about}} the effect labor force participation and disability enrollment both have on the US healthcare system (i. e., <b>healthcare</b> utilization <b>and</b> employment). This dissertation is comprised of three manuscripts answering questions related to these relationships. Results show that labor force participation is a more robust indicator than the unemployment rate for exploring the effect of the labor market on <b>healthcare</b> spending <b>and</b> health outcomes, with healthcare spending itself exhibiting a unique relationship with healthcare provider employment. In addition, results show that rising disability enrollment is also related with healthcare provider employment with a unique effect for mental and physical disability enrollment. Last, results show that the effect of disability programs on <b>healthcare</b> utilization <b>and</b> access extends beyond those receiving benefits to also include those applying for benefits. Collectively, this research demonstrates relationships between declining labor force participation, rising disability enrollment, <b>and</b> <b>healthcare</b> utilization <b>and</b> employment.

40|$|A two-factor {{regression}} model {{was used to}} examine the relationship between returns on healthcare equity REITs (EREITs) <b>and</b> <b>healthcare</b> stocks from 1985 to 1992. General stock indices were incorporated in the model to account for the influence of the market. Multiple positive contemporaneous relationships were found between six of the seven REITs studied and portfolios of other healthcare stocks. Furthermore, in four of the six REITs with positive results, significant correlations were evident between individual REIT portfolios and the SIC indices with which they showed a significant relationship. These results are consistent with a common factor or factors affecting the returns of both <b>healthcare</b> EREITs <b>and</b> stocks. The relationships found between returns on <b>healthcare</b> EREITs <b>and</b> <b>healthcare</b> stocks, especially the correlation between the classification of the EREIT portfolios and SIC indices, indicate the importance of real estate management for <b>healthcare</b> firms <b>and</b> asset subclassification choice for the real estate manager.

40|$|Abstract Background HIV disease {{itself is}} {{associated}} with increased <b>healthcare</b> utilization <b>and</b> <b>healthcare</b> expenditures. HIV-infected persons with lipodystrophy {{have been shown to}} have poor self-perceptions of health. We evaluated whether lipodystrophy in the HIV-infected population was associated with increased utilization of <b>healthcare</b> services <b>and</b> increased <b>healthcare</b> costs. Objective To examine utilization of <b>healthcare</b> services <b>and</b> associated costs with respect to presence of lipodystrophy among HIV-infected patients. Methods <b>Healthcare</b> utilization <b>and</b> cost of <b>healthcare</b> services were collected from computerized accounting records for participants in a body image study among HIV-infected patients treated at a tertiary care medical center. Lipodystrophy was assessed by physical examination, and effects of lipodystrophy were assessed via body image surveys. Demographic and clinical characteristics were also ascertained. Analysis of <b>healthcare</b> utilization <b>and</b> cost outcomes was performed via between-group analyses. Multivariate modeling was used to determine predictors of <b>healthcare</b> utilization <b>and</b> associated costs. Results Of the 181 HIV-infected participants evaluated in the study, 92 (51 %) had clinical evidence of HIV-associated lipodystrophy according to physician examination. Total healthcare utilization, as measured by the number of medical center visits over the study period, was notably increased among HIV-infected subjects with lipodystrophy as compared to HIV-infected subjects without lipodystrophy. Similarly, total healthcare expenditures over the study period were $ 1, 718 more for HIV-infected subjects with lipodystrophy than for HIV-infected subjects without lipodystrophy. Multivariate modeling demonstrated strong associations between <b>healthcare</b> utilization <b>and</b> associated costs, and lipodystrophy score as assessed by a clinician. <b>Healthcare</b> utilization <b>and</b> associated costs were not related to body image survey scores among HIV-infected patients with lipodystrophy. Conclusion Patients with HIV-associated lipodystrophy demonstrate an increased utilization of healthcare services with associated increased healthcare costs as compared to HIV-infected patients without lipodystrophy. The economic <b>and</b> <b>healthcare</b> service burdens of HIV-associated lipodystrophy are significant and yet remain inadequately addressed by the medical community. </p...|$|R
