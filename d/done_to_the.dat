5|$|When {{neutrophils}} {{release their}} granule contents in the kidney, {{the contents of}} the granule (reactive oxygen compounds and proteases) degrade the extracellular matrix of host cells and can cause damage to glomerular cells, affecting their ability to filter blood and causing changes in shape. In addition, phospholipase products (e.g., leukotrienes) intensify the damage. This release of substances promotes chemotaxis of more neutrophils to the site of infection, and glomerular cells can be damaged further by the adhesion molecules during the migration of neutrophils. The injury <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> glomerular cells can cause renal failure.|$|E

5|$|A round Norman-style apse {{was added}} to the church in 1868, the architects being the Lancaster {{partnership}} of Paley and Austin. The incumbent, the Rev.

Architect J.S.Crowther oversaw further alterations in 1881–83; a baptistery was built, the organ was moved and choir stalls were built in the chancel. Some work was <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> interior of the tower in 1908. Renovations in 1955 included the addition of a central aisle and the removal of some of the church furnishings. The Victorian pulpit was replaced. A small extension was added north of the tower in 2005.|$|E

5|$|After the work-ins had ended, work {{continued}} on finishing the cap which {{was scheduled for}} lift-on in October. The weather hampered the work initially, but {{the application of a}} modern microporous paint, designed to withstand normal movement of the timber and yet remain waterproof, was completed in time for the lift-on. A mini work-in was held the weekend before the cap was lifted, with 17 people participating over the weekend. Final work was <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cap and a new window was fitted to the stone floor of the mill. The tarpaulin was removed and the trammel dismantled. The 5-ton cap was lifted into place by a mobile crane on 24 October 1983, watched by a crowd of some 70 people. The fitting of the cap was toasted with beer from Adnams Brewery, Southwold.|$|E
5|$|Between 1859 and 1860, Frewin Hall {{housed the}} future Edward VII whilst he {{attended}} Christ Church. The chapel and old kitchen were planned to {{form part of}} a new, third, quadrangle for Brasenose. The valuable rents that the shops {{on the south side}} of Brasenose earned the college provided the most significant reason for the delay in further expansion, which only began in 1886 when work on the west side was started. It was finally completed in 1911, the last work having been <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> High Street frontage. Frewin Hall was reconstructed between 1887 and 1896, as were the chapel and antechapel. It had been in 1886 that Cradock had died and was replaced by Albert Watson.|$|E

A child’s bloody print is found, but Scully doesn’t believe that a child did this. Meanwhile, the beggar, somehow disguised as an ordinary-looking Caucasian man, applies for a janitorial job at a Cheverly, Maryland elementary school. In the morgue, Scully describes the massive stomach damage <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> body which leads Doggett to the idea of drugs being forcibly cut out of him. However, the man showed no sign of drugs in the blood tests and Scully tells Doggett that his time of death was 24 to 36 hours prior, long before he left India. Due to a discrepancy in weight, she begins to believe that there was a passenger in the corpse.|$|E

In the 1980s extensive remodelling of the White House was done. In April 2001, The Scout Association moved its program staff from London to Gilwell Park, where its training staff were already located.

5|$|Euryalus, {{named after}} the Greek hero Euryalus, was laid down on 18 July 1899 by Vickers, Sons & Maxim at their Barrow-in-Furness shipyard. She was {{launched}} 20 May 1901 in front of 30,000 spectators, and christened by Mrs. Douglas Vickers, wife {{of one of the}} directors of the company. On 11 June 1901, {{the south side of the}} Ramsden dock at Barrow caught fire, and was practically destroyed before the flames could be extinguished. The recently launched Euryalus was laying alongside this wharf, and the fire set ablaze the teak wood sheathing of the cruiser. Considerable damage was <b>done</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ship before she was hauled from the pier into the middle of the dock, and her completion was severely delayed. Towed to Cammell Laird at Birkenhead for repairs, the ship slipped off the blocks supporting her in drydock and was severely damaged. While on sea trials, she collided with the auxiliary vessel Traveller on 27 June 1903 at Devonport. Euryalus was finally completed on 5 January 1904, nearly two years after her sister ships.|$|E
