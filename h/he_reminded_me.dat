6000|$|... "What {{nonsense}} he talks!" [...] Cristel exclaimed. [...] "All mere fancy! <b>He</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of the {{old song}} called 'The Nervous Man.' Do you know it, Mr. Roylake?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He was chiefly {{concerned}} lest I {{should be}} disappointed. Then <b>he</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> that the benefit to mankind had {{come all the}} sooner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly," [...] Freddy answered. [...] "We've a {{political}} reception, semi-diplomatic. I saw our old friend only yesterday, and <b>he</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> {{that he was}} coming." ...|$|E
60|$|Stroeve, {{looking at}} her with perplexity, hesitated. His {{forehead}} was all puckered, and his red mouth set in a pout. <b>He</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> oddly of an agitated guinea-pig.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Glad to know him,' says I, 'but in {{his present}} {{condition}} <b>he</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of the joke Shakespeare got off on Julius Cæsar. We might say about your friend: ...|$|R

60|$|I liked Nielsen's looks then. <b>He</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> of Jim Emett, the Mormon giant to whom {{difficulties}} and obstacles were but spurs to achievement. Such men {{could not be}} defeated.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{meant no}} offence," [...] the recruit said. [...] "The man <b>he</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> of had a queer history, and I suppose {{that is what}} put it into my head." ...|$|E
60|$|When {{we reached}} the rectory gate, he had cooled a little. As we crossed the garden, <b>he</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> that I stood pledged to be present when the bandage was taken off.|$|E
5000|$|Anna Tambour: [...] "In human terms, if I had {{to compare}} him to other authors, I {{would say that}} <b>he</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> more of a mug of hot Lear blended with Cummings, served with a squeeze of post-enema'd Shelley." ...|$|R

60|$|Thus I made it appear, and so persuaded myself, that my {{ambition}} {{had been}} {{prompted by a}} craving for knowledge. As {{soon as he could}} recover himself <b>he</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> that he had on many occasions declared I had a brain.|$|E
2500|$|He had the {{pleasing}} {{face and}} he was very virtuous. His speaking style was so delightful that people were not tired of hearing his words and his bright face was very charming. Khomeini said about him: «When I see him, <b>he</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of Allah.» ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then why {{the devil}} don't {{you see that}} he doesn't get too much?" [...] the {{newcomer}} said sharply. [...] "Don't {{you know what it}} means in this climate? Why, he's on the high-road to a fever now. Who on this earth is it <b>he</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look at Shields," [...] said Mr. Spence. [...] "He {{might be}} posing for a statue {{to be called}} 'Despair!' <b>He</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of Macduff.

60|$|I saw Uriah {{watch her}} while she greeted us; and <b>he</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> of an ugly and rebellious genie {{watching}} a good spirit. In the meanwhile, some slight sign passed between Mr. Micawber and Traddles; and Traddles, unobserved except by me, went out.|$|E
6000|$|... "This made me laugh; the King {{asked the}} reason. I told him, <b>He</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> of the RUSSE A PARIS, that charming {{little piece of}} verse of M. de Voltaire's; and we remembered charming things out of it, which made us both laugh. He said, ...|$|E
60|$|The man didn't say a word. He {{seemed to}} be {{brooding}} on something. He {{was one of those}} silent men. <b>He</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> of Joe, the old dog down the street at the grocer's shop, who lies at the door all day, blinking and not speaking to anybody.|$|E
5000|$|Ran Yagil, nrg Maariv: [...] "The {{writer is}} a lawyer by {{profession}} - but also made a serious inquiry that serves the plot meticulously… Shoham has {{a great sense of}} humor… In his best moments <b>he</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> the undisputed king of the crime novel today - John Grisham." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't like {{to praise}} him too much," [...] I rejoined, [...] "lest I should appear to praise myself; <b>he</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> {{so much of}} what I was at his age. If your {{beautiful}} mother were to come to life for an hour she would see the resemblance." ...|$|R
5000|$|According to Toulouse and France teammate, Maxime Médard, Fickou [...] "is {{one of the}} 10 best centres in {{the world}} and soon he will be number one. <b>He</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of Sonny Bill Williams: tall, athletic, technical, with a good {{hand-off}} and a feel for the game.

6000|$|... "I have no idea," [...] he answered. [...] "I {{only know}} that when I saw him enter, it gave me almost a shock. <b>He</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> most strangely {{of a man who}} has been dead for many years. I could {{scarcely}} take my eyes off him at first." ...|$|E
60|$|The House was {{certainly}} all mouth for the moment, but, as I could feel, quite in earnest. A Minister {{with a piece}} of typewritten paper seemed to be fending off volleys of insults. <b>He</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> somehow of a nervous huntsman breaking up a fox in the face of rabid hounds.|$|E
60|$|He {{lifted a}} dish-cover, and helped {{his wife and}} daughter. His face was lined and fallen like an old man's after debauch, but his hand did not shake, and his voice was clear.

6000|$|... "I don't. Besides, it {{made him}} seem so ridiculous, and--I don't know why it is--I can't forgive a man for looking ridiculous.

You ought to see his eyes flash." ...|$|R
2500|$|Tubridy {{has been}} subject to {{commentary}} about his physical appearance. He {{describes himself as a}} [...] "young fogey".

6000|$|... 'Ay; {{anybody can}} {{be what you}} call graceful, if he lives a little time in a city, and keeps his eyes open. And he might have picked up his gentlemanliness {{by going to the}} {{galleries}} of theatres, and watching stage drawing-room manners. <b>He</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of one of the worst stories I ever heard in my life.' ...|$|R
