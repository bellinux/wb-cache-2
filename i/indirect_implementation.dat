Reduction of structural mode interactions over the entire mode duration is presented. The control mode using a discrete time observer structure is described to show the convergence of the spacecraft attitude transients during Delta-V thrusting maneuvers without preloading thrusting bias to the onboard control processor.

The most efficient algorithms for image spectrum extraction from raw SAR data appear to be those containing an intermediate image formation step.

It is also shown that a proposed indirect procedure for digitally implementing the same compact formulation is somewhat more efficient than the classical matched-filtering approach. However, this indirect procedure includes the image formation process as part of the total algorithm. Indeed, the computational savings afforded by the <b>indirect</b> <b>implementation</b> are identical to those obtained in SAR image formation processing when the matched-filtering algorithm is replaced by the well-known 'dechirp-Fourier transform' technique. Furthermore, corrections to account for slant-to-ground range conversion, spherical earth, etc., are often best implemented in the image domain, making intermediate image formation a valuable processing feature...|$|E

The measuring of surface temperatures at the building envelopes by means of well-practiced commercial temperature sensors are typically applied whose attributes can successfully be employed especially for the field of thermal building performance aspects. In addition, besides of their certain own accuracy level and final implementation for instance as an input parameter into the simulation model, typical methods of their final application related to the opaque and transparent building surfaces and their contact and non-contact modes may have the significant influence. The paper presents a representative confrontation of surface {{temperature monitoring}} of several temperature sensors as finally compared with the form of their final application on standard vertical building surfaces. Three typical ways of installation are demonstrated on opaque and transparent building component under real climate conditions applying of commercial thermocouples, digital temperature and infrared sensors.

The tool is viewed as vital for transmission of business data electronically. Despite the substantial benefits, only a fraction of companies worldwide have implemented EDI. Thus, this research is intended to examine the actual scenario of EDI implementation by focusing on manufacturers in Malaysia. The key objectives of this research are to identify EDI barriers, benefits, determinants and present integration levels; to discover the differences existed in EDI barriers, benefits, determinants and integration level based on demographic variables; to examine the influence of barriers, integration level and determinants towards the extent of received or perceived benefits; and to investigate influence of benefits on the improvement in firm performance, based on usersâ€™ perception. This research employs a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods to obtain comprehensive findings. Mail surveys were conducted resulting in 108 usable questionnaires while in-depth interviews were conducted with 6 manufacturers. The findings indicate that there are more â€œmandatedâ€� (type of) users and <b>indirect</b> <b>implementation</b> has become a common practice among the respondents. Organizational aspects are the major determinants; time-based benefits are the key benefits; financial aspects are the critical barriers; and only a few respondents have highly integrated EDI. The findings also indicate that the extent of received or perceived EDI benefits is significantly influenced by the determinants, barriers and level of integration. The level of EDI integration is found to be similar among different types of users; however it differs according to firm size. Only few respondents (44. 5 %) agreed that EDI benefits have brought positive impacts on their firm.

The aim of this work was to identify implementations of LBM that would achieve high computational performance with low memory consumption. Effects of memory addressing schemes were investigated in particular. Data layouts for velocity distribution values were also considered, and they {{were found to be}} related to computational performance. A novel bundle data layout was therefore introduced.

40|$|Generalized {{algebraic}} {{data types}} (GADTs) have received much attention {{recently in the}} functional programming community. They generalize the (type) parameterized algebraic datatypes (PADTs) of ML and Haskell by permitting value constructors to return specific, rather than parametric, typeinstantiations of their own datatype. GADTs {{have a number of}} applications, including strongly-typed evaluators, generic pretty-printing, generic traversals and queries, and typed LR parsing. We show that existing object-oriented programming languages such as Java and C ♯ can express GADT definitions, and a large class of GADT-manipulating programs, through the use of generics, subclassing, and virtual dispatch. However, some programs can be written only through the use of redundant runtime casts. Moreover, instantiationspecific, yet safe, operations on ordinary PADTs only admit <b>indirect</b> cast-free <b>implementations,</b> via higher-order encodings. We propose a generalization of the type constraint mechanisms of C ♯ and Java to both avoid the need for casts in GADT programs and higher-order contortions in PADT programs; we present a Visitor pattern for GADTs, and describe a refined switch construct as an alternative to virtual dispatch on datatypes. We formalize both extensions and prove type soundness...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyze various effects of informational constraints. In {{chapters}} 1 and 2 we consider a robust model of bilateral trade where traders have private reservation values and utility functions are common knowledge. In chapter 1 we study direct-revelation mechanisms. Under incentive and participation constraints, we define the notion of ex-post constrained efficiency, which {{does not depend on}} the distribution of types. Given ex-post incentive and participation constraints, a sufficient condition for constrained efficiency is simplicity: the outcome is a lottery between trade at one type-contingent price and no trade. For constant-relative-risk-aversion environments, we characterize simple mechanisms. Under risk neutrality they are equivalent to probability distributions over posted prices. Generically, simple mechanisms converge to full efficiency as agents' risk aversion goes to infinity. Under risk neutrality, ex-ante optimal mechanisms are deterministic, and under risk aversion, they are not. In chapter 2 we address <b>indirect</b> <b>implementation.</b> We define Mediated Bargaining Game-a continuous-time double auction with a hidden order book. It is the optimal bargaining game in the sense that its ex-post Nash equilibria in weakly undominated strategies constitute the Pareto-optimal frontier of the set of all ex-post Nash equilibria of all bargaining games. In Mediated Bargaining Game, type-monotone Bayesian equilibria coincide with ex-post Nash equilibria. The inefficiency due to incomplete information is manifested through delay. In contrast with the direct revelation mechanisms, in Mediated Bargaining Game the mechanism designer does not need to know the agents' risk attitudes. Informational constraints may also be a result of agents' subjective knowledge of the economic situation. In chapter 3 we study normal-form games, where each player may be aware of a subset of the set of possible actions, and has a set of possible awareness architectures. Awareness architecture is given by agents' perceptions, and an infinite regress of conjectures about others. Awareness equilibrium is a steady state where neither actions nor awareness architectures can change. We provide conditions under which awareness equilibria exists and study a parametrization of the set of possible awareness architectures...|$|E

We aimed to compare the medium-term (16 months) cost-effectiveness and the long-term (40 months) economic outcomes of a bespoke cognitive-behavioural group treatment (STreSS) with that of enhanced usual care (EUC). Methods: We obtained complete data on healthcare and indirect costs (i. e. labour-marked-related and health-related benefits) from public registries for 120 participants from a randomised controlled trial. Costs were calculated as per capita public expenses in 2010 €. QALYs gained were estimated from the SF- 6 D. We conducted a medium-term cost-effectiveness analysis and a long-term cost-minimization analysis from both a healthcare (i. e. direct cost) and a societal (i. e. total cost) perspective. Results: In the medium term, the probability that STreSS was cost-effective at thresholds of 25, 000 to 35, 000 € per QALY was 93 – 95 % from a healthcare perspective, but only 50 – 55 % from a societal perspective. In the long term, however, STreSS was associated with increasing savings in indirect costs, mainly due to {{a greater number of}} patients self-supporting. When combined with stable long-term reductions in healthcare expenditures, there were total cost savings of 7184 € (95 % CI 2271 to 12, 096, p = 0. 004) during the third year after treatment. Conclusion: STreSS treatment costs an average of 1545 €.

The speed control scheme consists of a standard <b>indirect</b> vector control <b>implementation</b> for torque control, with a sliding mode speed controller.

The performance of single component sliding mode controller with boundary layer is further improved by dual component sliding mode controller. Robustness to variation of parameters, like rotor resistance and moment of inertia are demonstrated through simulation. Results are compared with fixed gain controllers.

However, current security policy approaches are usually static, and slow to adapt to ever-changing requirements, let alone catching up with reality.

This gives {{a glimpse of the}} unsustainable nature of a global problem, any improvement in terms of closing the 'time window to adapt' would be a significant step forward. To exacerbate the situation, a simple change in threat and attack vector or even an implementation of the so-called 'bring-your-own-device' paradigm will greatly change the frequency of changed security requirements and necessary solutions required for each new context.

40|$|Innovation is {{considered}} to be of crucial importance for organisational survival and growth, and in this respect employees play a leading role, as {{they are the ones who}} develop innovative ideas. At the same time, the struggle for organisational survival and growth gives rise to perceptions of job insecurity. To date, few studies have explored how employees’ innovative work behaviour (IWB) is influenced by the perceived threat of job loss (i. e. job insecurity). As both job insecurity and IWB are increasingly salient in light of organisational change and competition, the present study examines the relationship between job insecurity and IWB, as well as the role of psychological contract breach in explaining this relationship. We hypothesized a negative relation between job insecurity and innovative work behaviour, with psychological contract breach as a mediator in this relationship. Participants were 190 employees from an industrial organisation that had faced restructuring and downsizing for several years. Contrary to our predictions, no direct association was found between job insecurity and the two sub-dimensions of innovative work behaviour (i. e., idea generation and idea <b>implementation).</b> <b>Indirect</b> relationships, however, were found between job insecurity and the two types of IWB through psychological contract breach. Surprisingly, psychological contract breach was positively related to idea generation and idea implementation. These findings shed new light on the relationship between job insecurity and IWB...|$|R

Drawing on the theory of underenforced constitutional norms, first articulated by Dean Lawrence Sager of the University of Texas School of Law, this Article argues that state legislatures have an independent constitutional duty to recognize and fund a qualified right to appointed counsel at welfare administrative hearings.

A user-friendly computer program, CyberMart, which calculates the total energy {{performance of a}} supermarket, is presented. The modelling method described in this thesis has four phases: the first phase is the de-velopment of a conceptual model that includes its objectives, the envi-ronment and {{the components of the}} system, and their interconnections. The second phase is a quantitative model in which the ideas from the conceptual model are transformed into mathematical and physical rela-tionships. The third phase is an evaluation of the model with a sensitivity analysis of its predictions and comparisons between the computer model and results from field measurements. The fourth phase is the model ap-plication in which the computer model answers questions identified {{in the beginning of the}} modelling process as well as other questions arising throughout the work. Field measurements in seven different supermarkets in Sweden were car-ried out to: (i) investigate the most important parameters that influence energy performance in supermarkets, (ii) analyse the operation of new system designs with <b>indirect</b> system <b>implementation</b> in Sweden during recent years, and (iii) validate the computer model. A thorough sensitivity analysis shows a total sensitivity of 5. 6 %, which is a satisfactory result given a 10 % change in the majority of input parame-ters and assumptions, with the exception of outdoor temperatures and solar radiation that were calculated as extreme values in METEO-NORM. Comparisons between measurements and simulations in five supermarkets also show a good agreement. Measurements and simula-tion results for a whole year were not possible due to lack of data. CyberMart opens up perspectives for designers and engineers in the field by providing innovative opportunities for assessment and testing of new energy efficient measures but also for evaluation of different already-installed system designs and components. The implementation of new energy-saving technologies in supermarkets requires an extensive inte-grated analysis of the energy performances of the refrigeration system, HVAC system, lighting, equipment, and the total energy usage. This analysis should be done over a long period, to evaluate and compare the real energy performance with the theoretical values calculated by Cyber-Mart. QC 2010033...|$|R

It is motivated by the increasing emphasis that has been placed {{in recent years by}} academics and practitioners on the use of a more economics-based approach {{to improve the quality of}} Competition Authority decisions and the parallel emphasis by some eminent commentators on adopting a decision error-cost minimisation approach in selecting decision rules or standards. Our analysis of the choice of decision rules captures the effects of decision errors and also the important indirect effect of different rules in deterring firms to take specific actions. We also address the effects of the length of the litigation cycle, of implementation costs, of the possibility of fine-tuning antitrust penalties to decision rules and of asymmetries in the deterrent effects of these rules on firms taking benign and harmful actions. A number of interesting results and insights emerge: 1. Even if we do not take into account implementation costs, the fact that with the use of economic models we can discriminate more accurately between harmful and benign cases of specific actions in no way guarantees that Rule of Reason type procedures will be superior to Per Se rules. 2. When <b>indirect</b> effects and <b>implementation</b> costs are not taken into account an effectively discriminating Rule of Reason procedure is certainly better than Per Se rules on welfare grounds, though it may not be best on decision error cost minimisation grounds...|$|R
40|$|While the {{transfer}} of "best practices" by MNCs is frequently regarded as contributing towards convergence, recent research has noted important changes in these processes, that is {{the diversity of the}} HR transfer process. While there is extensive literature on direct HRM transfers (forward diffusion) from a MNC BQ to a subsidiary, there is little on what happens when BRM transfers are mediated by a regional level. MNC regionalisation has been noted in the international business research (e. g. Perlmutter, Bartlett & Ghoshal 1989, Rugman, 2000, 2005, Schuh 2007). Authors have identified that MNCs are regionalising their business rather than operating at a country level or global level (Rugman 2002, Schuh 2007). However, how regionalisation makes impacts on HRM transfer has yet to be explored in IHRM research. Further, there has been a shortage of studies of HRM transfers in developing countries. This thesis seeks to chart some of the diversity in {{the transfer}} process. It is based on a study of a Swiss MNC, with a focus on the subsidiary in Sri Lanka and the regional HQ in India. The study outlines the changes in HR transfer that took place following regionalisation in the mid- 1990 s, specifically the thesis examines the impact of the introduction of a regional level, whereby HRM practice transfers to the overseas subsidiary are mediated by a regional headquarters (HQs). The thesis devised a combined model of direct and mediated HRM transfers, developed from Liu's model (2004). The Research Hypotheses (RHs) in the thesis viere concerned with the elements of cultural and institutional distances between the countries where Swiss Co, SwissCo SL and SAR HQs were located, MNC company level factors (subsidiary's strategic role, MNC structure and organizational culture compatibility), practice level factors (HRM innovation and knowledge characteristics), HRM transfer mechanisms (direct and <b>indirect),</b> employee <b>implementation</b> and internalisation, and reverse transfer. The thesis derived a set of research hypotheses (RHs) from the combination model and examined their support in the SwissCo case study before the MNC introduced regionalisation (direct transfers) and after the process (direct and mediated transfers). The thesis found support for some RHs, partial support for some, mixed support for some and limited support for others. The support found for some of the RHs varied by period. The thesis found strong support for the RHs that cultural distance and incompatible organizational cultures formed significant barriers to HRM transfer. Strong support was also found RH that HRM transfer Is easier where subsidiaries and employees perceived an HRM transfer to be of benefit to them. The thesis makes a contribution to the development of knowledge and theory on HRM transfers, especially for HRM transfer to a subsidiary taking place when a regional layer is present.

40|$|The {{need for}} {{sustainable}} investments has grown dramatically {{in recent years}} and so has the pressure on investors, especially state-owned investors, to integrate sustainability factors in their investments. Several researchers state that private equity investors {{play a major role in}} creating new businesses and influencing new companies towards sustainability. On the Swedish private equity market, a major part of the funds available to growth companies are provided by the Government. State-owned investor’s role to create sustainable businesses in Sweden is therefore essential. However, research on how to implement ESG issues into venture capital investments is rare. Still today, we could not find any reports on how ESG issues are implemented by Swedish state-owned investors. An empirical study was conducted on four major Swedish state-owned investors with the purpose to answer how state-owned investors implement ESG issues in venture capital investments. The study also aimed to identify problems with implementing ESG and how can state-owned investors work to deal with these problems. Interviews with investment managers and people working within these organization showed that it is generally up to each investor how ESG issues are being considered in the due diligence and screening process within direct investments. When it comes to post-investment activities the responsibility to work with ESG issues lays upon the board of each firm. The study further showed that little is being done to implement ESG issues within indirect investments. The study shows that ESG issues are not included in the valuation of general partner or as criteria for investing in a fund or other partnerships. A final conclusion is that when it comes to how state-owned investors are working with venture capital investments, ESG issues are integrated in how investors think, but it is not implemented in how investors act. In order to move from integration to implementation we suggest that investors could use a set of templates in the screening and due diligence process. Every template should be specific for the sector that includes the type of ESG criteria that is relevant for this sector. When it comes to <b>indirect</b> investments, the <b>implementation</b> of ESG issues is harder due to limited possibility to actively directing funds. The focus should be working with co-investors with the same values and beliefs and influence the board of the fund...|$|R

This thesis addresses {{the costs of}} implementation of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) in the particular case of Snake River chinook salmon. Unlike most previous listings under the act, restoration of Snake River salmon will have impacts on a very broad array of industries and user groups over a region that spans several states and crosses international boundaries. It is indeed projected that the potential economic effects of salmon recovery will outweigh those of every other species listing under the ESA put together. While the case of Snake River salmon may not be entirely representative of ESA listings in general, {{it is an important}} test case for economic analysis of species recovery. What is particularly notable about the ESA is the unequivocalness of its mandate: take no action that further threatens an identified species, and take all action necessary to restore the population to a level at which its survival is assured. Upon implementation, however, it becomes immediately obvious that absolute certainty is unattainable, at any cost, and that resources for restoration are indeed limited. Thus arises {{the question of how to}} balance cost against risk of extinction. While the explicit balancing of costs and benefits of species recovery is (at least presently) essentially forbidden under the Act, the increasing marginal cost of further increments of risk reduction makes the consideration of the economics of species recovery unavoidable. The approach taken in this thesis is to define a cost effectiveness frontier which identifies the least cost recovery alternatives for each incremental decrease in risk of extinction, i. e define cost as a function of probability of survival. Monte-carlo simulations using a set of salmon life-cycle models are employed to assess the probability of survival achievable under a broad range of recovery alternatives. Alternatives range from elimination of sport and commercial harvest of Snake River chinook, alternative operation of hydropower facilities in the Snake and Columbia Basins, including removal of one or more dams on the Snake River, increased barge transportation of outmigrating juvenile salmon, improvement in upstream passage and spawning habitat, and a number of others. The alternatives considered span a range of costs and degrees of political acceptability. Cost assessments are largely gathered from ongoing federal and state planning analyses and include both direct and <b>indirect</b> costs of <b>implementation.</b> In addition to the level of costs under each alternative, this analysis also addresses the distribution of economic impacts across different user groups in the Columbia and Snake River Basin...|$|R
