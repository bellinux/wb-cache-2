25|$|The anti-disco backlash, {{combined}} with other societal and radio industry factors, {{changed the face of}} pop radio in the years following Disco Demolition Night. Starting in the 1980s, country music began a slow rise in American main pop charts. Emblematic of country music's rise to mainstream popularity was the commercially successful 1980 movie Urban Cowboy. Somewhat ironically, the star of the film was John Travolta, who only three years before had starred <b>in</b> <b>Saturday</b> Night Fever, a film that featured disco culture.|$|E

25|$|Eccleston {{completed}} a two-year Performance Foundation Course at Salford Tech {{before going on}} to train at the Central School of Speech and Drama.

At the age of 25, Eccleston made his professional stage debut in the Bristol Old Vic's production of A Streetcar Named Desire.

The pole-sitting car of Shane Van Gisbergen and Jonathon Webb were in contention until Van Gisbergen stalled in the final pit stop and the car would not restart. Other leading contenders had various issues throughout the day. Scott McLaughlin and Alexandre Prémat led the most laps but were forced out of contention when McLaughlin hit the wall after being passed by Van Gisbergen. Craig Lowndes received a drive-through penalty for spinning Mark Winterbottom in the closing stages, with the two cars finishing tenth and sixth respectively. David Reynolds and Dean Canto had an alternator failure while running second. The Holden Racing Team had a difficult weekend, with the car of Garth Tander and Warren Luff being withdrawn from the event after a major crash <b>in</b> <b>Saturday</b> practice, while James Courtney and Greg Murphy suffered electrical problems throughout the race.

Despite finishing fifth, Whincup extended his championship lead with Winterbottom overtaking Lowndes for second place.|$|E
500|$|Perowne's {{composure}} {{and success}} mean the implied violence {{is in the}} background. His personal contentment, (at {{the top of his}} profession, and [...] "an unashamed beneficiary of the fruits of late capitalism") provides a hopeful side to the book, instead of the unhappiness in contemporary fiction. McEwan's previous novels highlighted the fragility of modern fulfilled life, seemingly minor incidents dramatically upsetting existence. Saturday returns to a theme explored in Atonement, which plotted the disruption of a lie to a middle-class family, and in The Child in Time, where a small child is kidnapped during a day's shopping. This theme is continued <b>in</b> <b>Saturday,</b> a [...] "tautly wound tour-de-force" [...] set in a world where terrorism, war and politics make the news headlines, but the protagonist has to live out this life until he [...] "collides with another fate". <b>In</b> <b>Saturday</b> Perowne's medical knowledge captures the delicate state of humanity better than novelists' imaginations: his acquaintance with death and neurological perspective better capture human frailty.|$|E
