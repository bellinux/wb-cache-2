The public is willing <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> extra rice price in substitution of a rice subsidy reduction impact for the mitigation programmes. More specifically, the study ascertains that households on average are willing <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> 25 % more for rice in replace of the subsidy reduction impact. This value conveys a total economic value of MYR 557 million per annum, based on the total annual rice consumption of Malaysians who are willing <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for the rice subsidy reduction impact.

40|$|It {{has been}} argued that the {{willingness}} <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for health care services in contingent valuation studies should be assessed ex ante from an insurance perspective. It may however be easier to assess the willingness <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> among a group of patients in need of a specific treatment. This willingness <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> measure can be used to estimate the expected willingness <b>to</b> <b>pay.</b> This paper investigates the relationship between ex ante and expected willingness <b>to</b> <b>pay.</b> It is shown that expected willingness <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> is a lower bound for ex ante willingness <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for a treatment that restores the individual to full health for an individual that is risk averse with respect to income. For a treatment that does not restore an individual to full health the expected willingness <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> is not necessarily a lower bound for the ex ante willingness <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> if the marginal utility of income increases with better health. willingness <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> health care contingent valuation cost-benefit analysis...|$|R

In these instances, contingent valuation studies should include measures of quality perceptions as covariates in the willingness <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> model {{in order to avoid}} omitted variable bias. Variation in quality perceptions across respondents leads to a potential endogeneity of quality perceptions. We address the potential for endogeneity bias using an instrumental variable approach in which a measure of quality perceptions is included as a determinant of willingness <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> and is simultaneously determined by various exogenous factors. The willingness <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> model is estimated jointly with quality perceptions allowing for correlation of the error terms.
