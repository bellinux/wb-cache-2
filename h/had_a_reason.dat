5|$|Cunningham drew on his {{religious}} faith to persevere through the loss, believing that God <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> for everything to happen. Immediately after the game, he expressed this belief {{in an attempt}} to console Carter. The following season, Cunningham was benched for poor play after six games and was released by the Vikings {{at the end of the}} year. He also would never play in a Super Bowl.|$|E
5|$|The US Chief of Army Staff, General Martin Dempsey, said Pakistan's {{anger was}} {{justified}} as it <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> to be furious given {{the loss of}} life. However, Dempsey did not apologise, saying {{he did not know}} enough about the incident and an inquiry was still being conducted. A senior advisor to Afghan President Hamid Karzai warned that Pakistan and Afghanistan may be on a course toward military conflict. Hamid Karzai contacted the Pakistani Prime Minister to discuss the NATO strike and gave his condolences over the deaths of soldiers.|$|E
25|$|Even though Seleucus now {{had about}} 20,000 soldiers, {{they were not}} enough to {{withstand}} the forces of Antigonus. He also did not know when Antigonus would begin his counterattack. On the other hand, he knew {{that at least two}} eastern provinces did not have a satrap. A great majority of his own troops were from these provinces. Some of Evagoras' troops were Persian. Perhaps a portion of the troops were Eumenes' soldiers, who <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> to hate Antigonus. Seleucus decided {{to take advantage of this}} situation.|$|E
50|$|According to Thomas Nagel, consequentialism {{need not}} be too {{demanding}} since {{it is possible to}} distinguish between 'agent-neutral' reasons and 'agent-relative' reasons. An agent-neutral <b>reason</b> is <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> that applies to anybody, regardless of their particular circumstances: thus, anybody <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> to want any pain to stop, regardless of whether it is his. An agent-relative <b>reason</b> is <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> that applies only to particular individuals: thus, not everybody <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> to want me to study every day, however, I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> to want to study every day, namely, because I want to pass my exams.|$|R

25|$|Ironically, the National {{opposition}} {{prompted the}} adoption of the statute in 1947 when its leader, and future prime minister, Sidney Holland introduced a private member's bill to abolish the Legislative Council. Because New Zealand required the consent of the British Parliament to make the necessary amendments to the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852, Peter Fraser, now Prime Minister, <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> to finally adopt the statute. It was formally adopted on 25 November 1947 with the Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1947, along with consenting legislation from the British Parliament—New Zealand was the last Dominion listed in the statute to adopt it.|$|E
25|$|The family appealed, {{contrasting}} {{her case}} {{with that of}} Juan Lafuente, another possible victim whose petition the court's counterpart in Dutchess County, where he lived, had accepted. Like Philip, his exposure to the attacks is based on circumstantial evidence. He, too, had recently lost a job and struggled with depression, and as a volunteer fire marshal in Poughkeepsie might himself have <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> to offer assistance at the attack site. His office was eight blocks north of the W.T.C. complex, but the court accepted testimony from someone who frequented the same local deli claiming he had overheard Lafuente say he had {{a meeting at the}} Trade Center that morning. Philip's family believes Lafuente's petition, with similarly minimal evidence of the alleged decedent's presence {{at the site of the}} attacks, was accepted primarily because his wife, Colette, was mayor of Poughkeepsie at the time and the case was heard there rather than in Manhattan.|$|E
500|$|Sophie Grace Chappell argues that, without {{external}} reasons for action, it becomes impossible {{to maintain that}} {{the same set of}} moral reasons applies to all agents equally. In cases where someone has no internal reason to do what others see as the right thing, they cannot be blamed for failing to do it, because internal reasons are the only reasons, and blame, Williams wrote, [...] "involves treating the person who is blamed like someone who <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> {{to do the right thing}} but did not do it." ...|$|E

500|$|The [...] "yacht cruiser" [...] {{project was}} handled {{separately}} by the navy; Morin's design was again ruled out, now {{because he had}} focused his design {{too much on the}} yacht aspect of the vessel, neglecting its military qualities. Again, the navy chose Fiala's proposal, named IIb, {{as the basis for the}} [...] "yacht cruiser", citing its heavier armament and higher speed, compared to Morin's vessel. But no final design had been approved by the time Franz Ferdinand was assassinated in Sarajevo on 28 June 1914; with the death of the man who had requested the [...] "yacht cruiser", the navy no longer <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> to pursue the project.|$|E
500|$|Hardy {{released}} two character promotional vignettes, that he {{was planning}} to use before he was offered a new contract by WWE. Hardy called himself The Angelic Diablo with the tagline [...] "the scar will become a symbol" [...] in reference {{to the way in which}} he had been treated by Lita and WWE. On the June 20 episode of Raw, during the storyline wedding of Edge and Lita, Hardy's entrance music and video were played when the priest asked if anyone <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> why Edge and Lita should not be wed. On the July 11 episode of Raw, Hardy made his return, attacking Edge as he made his way to the ring. On the July 13 episode of WWE's webcast Byte This!, which featured Lita as its guest, one of the callers was Hardy himself.|$|E
500|$|In 1991, Zappa {{was chosen}} {{to be one of}} four {{featured}} composers at the Frankfurt Festival in 1992 (the others were John Cage, Karlheinz Stockhausen, and Alexander Knaifel). Zappa was approached by the German chamber ensemble Ensemble Modern which was interested in playing his music for the event. Although ill, he invited them to Los Angeles for rehearsals of new compositions and new arrangements of older material. Zappa also got along with the musicians, and the concerts in Germany and Austria were set up for later in the year. Zappa also performed in 1991 in Prague, claiming that [...] "was {{the first time that he}} <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> to play his guitar in 3 years", and that that moment was just [...] "the beginning of a new country", and asked the public to [...] "try to keep your country unique, do not change it into something else".|$|E

500|$|... "Judge, Jury, Executioner" [...] was lauded by {{television}} critics. Mark A. Perigard of the Boston Herald {{called it an}} [...] "incredible episode"; [...] "Walking Dead again proves {{it is one of}} the best dramas on TV and almost makes me feel good about paying my cable bill." [...] Writing for the San Antonio Express-News, Rene Guzman opined that it [...] "delivers all that messy drama in spades with a true gut-wrenching end to one of the series’ core characters". Wetpaint's Molly Friedman stated that in [...] "Judge, Jury, Executioner", the audience [...] "finally <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> to shed some tears and remember just how much we care about the original gang of apocalyptic misfits". Kevin Yeoman of The Christian Science Monitor and E! Online journalist Tierney Bricker concluded that the episode managed to effectively surprise the audience, while Cyriaque Lamar of io9 declared that [...] "Judge, Jury, Executioner" [...] was inferior to its predecessor by writing that it [...] "served up a bunch of quasi-entertaining scenes of people arguing and capped them off with one of the most accidentally funny closers ever committed to basic cable". In his B+ review, Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club said that the episode continued the series' path of a more focused and central direction. Josh Jackson of Paste was intrigued with the series' exploration of morality during an apocalyptic event in [...] "Judge, Jury, Executioner". Eric Goldman of IGN was much more pessimistic about the episode than the general consensus. In his 6.5 out of 10 rating review, he called it [...] "especially dull" [...] when compared to the previous installment.|$|E

40|$|Transmission {{principles}} concern {{how some}} reasons for action {{are grounded in}} the fact that the action in question is a means to something else we <b>have</b> <b>reason</b> to do. <b>A</b> widely accepted transmission principle: Necessary Means Transmission: If <b>A</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> to φ, and ψ-ing is a necessary means for A to φ, then <b>A</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> to ψ. 1 A more controversial proposal: Liberal Transmission (LT) : If <b>A</b> <b>has</b> <b>an</b> intrinsic <b>reason</b> to φ, and ψ-ing is a means for A to φ, then <b>A</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> to ψ. 2 • φ-ing is a means to ψ-ing iff φ-ing helps to bring it about that one ψ-s. • p is <b>an</b> intrinsic <b>reason</b> to φ iff p is <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> to φ that is not grounded {{in the fact that}} φ-‐ing is a means to another action that one has reason to perform. Why Liberal Transmission is of philosophical interest: • It is important to know whether we can rely on LT in practical deliberation. • J. Raz uses LT in his argument against the wide-scope account of instrumental rationality. • M. Schroeder’s account of means/end-incoherence presupposes LT. • J. Way relies on LT in his argument for scepticism about ‘wrong kind reasons’. ...|$|R

A second group would have been a cutter party preparing to launch a boat to rescue the Walrus crew if it ditched, or to board Kormoran, with their life jackets mistaken for aprons. The JCFADT report suggests a third group: a damage control party in fire-fighting gear.|$|E
2500|$|Female {{civilian}} internees (including nuns) and children: This compound {{was located}} at {{the western part of}} the camp, slightly removed from the other compounds. The internees were mostly Dutch and British, with a few Eurasian and Chinese women, and four American women, including Agnes Newton Keith. Their quarters were described by an internee as [...] "new and fair" [...] and [...] "they <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> area for cultivation." [...] The camp mistress was initially Mother Bernardine, an English Roman Catholic nun, but when she became ill Mrs. Dorie Adams, wife of the master of the men’s camp, took over the role. The women were housed in five very small barracks and each person was allotted a space of 6 feet by 4 feet (1.8m by 1.2m) in which to live and store his or her possessions. A chapel was constructed at one end of one of the huts.|$|E
2500|$|A {{reporter}} for BBC News explained that following the attempt on Paul's life, viewers {{would be left}} to guess the culprit {{from a number of}} suspects in a similar way to the popular Dallas storyline [...] "Who shot J.R.?" [...] There were officially six suspects for the attempted murder. The developments leading up to moment Paul is pushed were played out over five episodes, each focusing on one of the suspects. The episodes explored possible motives and the events involving Paul and the suspects. Dennis told an Inside Soap columnist that each episode would begin with Paul standing on the mezzanine, before it flash backs to the events preceding it. Viewers would then see why each suspect <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> to harm him. Bower revealed that the viewers would know ahead of the characters who the actual culprit was.

2500|$|A legend is that Lincoln {{is shown}} using sign {{language}} to represent his initials, {{with his left}} hand shaped to form an [...] "A" [...] and his right hand to form an [...] "L". The National Park Service denies both stories, calling them urban legends. However, historian Gerald Prokopowicz writes that, while {{it is not clear that}} sculptor Daniel Chester French intended for Lincoln's hands to be formed into sign language versions of his initials, it is possible that French did intend it, because he was familiar with American Sign Language, and he would have <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> to do so, i.e., to pay tribute to Lincoln for having signed the federal legislation giving Gallaudet University, a university for the deaf, the authority to grant college degrees. The National Geographic Society's publication, On This Spot: Pinpointing the Past in Washington, D.C., states that French had a son who was deaf, and the sculptor was familiar with sign language. Historian James A. Percoco has observed that, although there are no extant documents showing that French carved Lincoln's hands to represent the letters [...] "A" [...] and [...] "L" [...] in American Sign Language, [...] "I think you can conclude that it's reasonable to have that kind of summation about the hands." ...|$|E
2500|$|The priest Hovhannes who {{salvaged}} {{the remains}} of the old manuscript reports in one of the colophons that he had suffered seeing the old manuscript {{fall into the hands of}} the [...] "infidels" [...] like [...] "a lamb delivered to wolves" [...] and that he renovated it so that the [...] "royal memorial written in it might not be lost". Part of the original colophons, the [...] "royal memorial" [...] reports that the manuscript was written in the see of Hromkla in 1266 for the king Hethum. The uncials are identical to that of MS 539 and similar marginal ornaments adorn both. Yet another manuscript attributed to Roslin and his assistants is MS 32.18 currently located at the Freer Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. The colophons are lost but the name of the sponsor, Prince Vassak (brother of king Hethum I) is written on the marginal medallion on page 52: [...] "Lord bless the baron Vassak" [...] and again on the upper band of the frame around the Raising of Lazarus: [...] "Lord have mercy on Vassak, Thy servant, the owner of this, Thy holy Gospel". The uncials and the ornaments match those of MS 539 and MS 5458. Prince Vassak was sent to Cairo by his brother in 1268 to pay ransom and obtain the release of prince Levon and thousands of other hostages captured after the disastrous Battle of Mari. They returned home on June 24, 1268. At this time Roslin had already completed the copy and illustrations of MS 10675 and his chief patron, Catholicos Constantine I having died, Roslin would have been free to work for another patron such as prince Vassak who <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> to celebrate.|$|E
