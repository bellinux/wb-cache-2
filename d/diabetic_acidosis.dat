On October 2, 1980, Mrs. Tutton stopped administering insulin and within 2 days her son became dangerously ill. The physician who attended the child said that on admission to hospital the child was dangerously ill, suffering from <b>diabetic</b> <b>acidosis,</b> a potentially fatal disorder which was due to the absence of insulin. The doctor admonished the parents when he learned that they had consciously withheld the insulin. He told the parents that insulin would be required by their son for life. Nevertheless, shortly after, Mrs. Tutton believed that she had had a vision of God in which she was told that Christopher had been cured and no more insulin was needed. Mrs. Tutton stopped the insulin injections on October 14, 1981. October 17, 1981 Christopher was taken to the hospital and pronounced dead on arrival due to complications of diabetic hyperglycemia.|$|E

An emaciated patient suffering from Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and volume depletion presented with acidosis of unknown origin. Preliminary investigations appeared to rule out lactic <b>acidosis,</b> <b>diabetic</b> keto-acidosis and <b>acidosis</b> due to base loss. We have previously reported a technique utilizing liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) {{which can be used}} to characterize the underlying aetiology of acidosis and applied it to ultrafiltrate derived from a blood sample taken from this patient. The anion profile obtained on the chromatogram showed elevated levels of acetoacetate and hydroxybutyrate but no evidence of lactic acidosis, nor was the profile typical of that seen in unexplained acidosis. We concluded that the patient was suffering from keto-acidosis associated with starvation and dehydration, the biochemical features being obscured by both the patient's chronic malnutrition and minimal muscle mass.

40|$|A {{controversy}} exists {{whether the}} administration of carbohydrates in addition to insulin in patients in <b>diabetic</b> <b>acidosis</b> actually speeds recovery from ketosis. The arguments used by the proponents (1 - 3) and opponents (4, 5) of the early use of carbohydrate are well known, and need not be elaborated. Franks, Berris, Kaplan, and Myers (5) found {{no difference in the}} average length of time it took for acetone to disappear from the urine by qualitative tests in <b>diabetic</b> <b>acidosis</b> whether early glucose was used or not. However, most investigators have found urinary ketones, particu-larly by qualitative tests, a poor guide to the de-gree of ketonemia. One {{reason for this is that}} urinary ketones continue to be excreted until blood levels reach extremely low levels (6), usu-ally in sufficient quantities to cause a " 4 -plus" qualitative test. To study the effect of carbohydrate on recovery from ketosis, the fall in total blood ketones in diabetic ketosis during insulin therapy, with and without the addition of carbohydrate, has been measured. The effectiveness of intravenous fruc-tose in lowering blood ketone levels has been com-pared to glucose because of preliminary observa-tions by Daughaday and Weichselbaum (7), since confirmed by others (8 - 10), that there was rela-tively normal utilization of fructose in <b>diabetic</b> <b>acidosis.</b> METHODS A direct comparison of therapies was made possible by inducing ketosis twenty times in eight diabetic patients...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that in <b>diabetic</b> <b>acidosis</b> the serum proteins (1, 2, 3), hemoglobin and blood cell volume (1, 2) are usually normal or high, falling with recovery from the acute condition.

This conception has received sup-port from direct blood volume studies made by the carbon monoxide method by Chang and Harrop (4). In general it has been assumed that the hemoconcentration of acidosis is related to general body water de-pletion. In the present study, by comparison of serum proteins with other chemical constituents of the blood and with clinical features of the condition, an attempt has been made to test this conclusion and to evalu-ate the importance of hemoconcentration and general body fluid loss in <b>diabetic</b> <b>acidosis.</b> MATERIAL AND METHODS The methods of chemical analysis employed have been described frequently in other papers from this department (5). Altogether 53 cases of <b>diabetic</b> <b>acidosis</b> have been studied. Of these 12 died. Death was in no case referable to uncomplicated diabetes. The patients who died had pneumonia, septicemia or cerebral hemorrhage and these associated con-ditions seemed to play a predominant role in determining their fatal endings. Total serum proteins were determined 117 times in 32 cases; protein fractions 54 times in 15 cases. In most instances the total acid-base equilibrium of the serum was determined simultaneously and in some cases the cell volume and oxygen capacity of the blood as well. Studies were made on admission and at varying intervals during the subsequent course in the hospital. General level and course of serum proteins During the acute stage of <b>diabetic</b> <b>acidosis</b> the serum proteins are usually normal, sometimes distinctly above normal.

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of gastrointestinal symptoms {{in patients with}} <b>diabetic</b> <b>acidosis</b> frequently challenges the physician's clinical acumen.

The pathogenesis of the reversible gastrointestinal symptoms which frequently accompany <b>diabetic</b> <b>acidosis</b> has not been rigorously defined and may be multifactorial, involving metabolic, humoral, and neural processes. Careful attention to the medical history and abdominal examination greatly facilitates distinguishing patients with intra-abdominal pathology from those with reversible symptoms secondary to ketoacidosis. Similarily, the judicious use of laboratory tests (electrocardiography, blood counts, urinalysis, serum enzyme profile, and abdominal roentgenograms) materially aids in differential diagnosis.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{study the}} etiology, {{clinical}} presentation and outcome of infantile onset diabetes mellitus (DM). DESIGN: Descriptive cohort study. Retrospective study from 1999 - 2007 and prospective from 2008 - 2012. SETTING: The diabetic clinic at a Pediatric tertiary care referral Institute in Chennai. METHODS: All infants diagnosed to have diabetes {{at less than}} one year of age were studied. Study variables were age at onset, gender, mode of presentation, birth weight, initial blood glucose, serum HbA 1 c, serum c-peptide levels, outcome at initial presentation, insulin requirement, associated comorbid conditions, genetic analysis and outcome {{at the end of the}} study or until they were followed up. RESULTS: 40 infants with infantile onset diabetes were studied. 8 % of all children with onset of DM at less than 12 years of age were IODM. Though 67. 5 % of these children presented with <b>Diabetic</b> keto <b>acidosis</b> (DKA), only 30 % had a provisional diagnosis of DM or DKA at first physician contact. Among the IODM with onset at less than 6 months 84 % were monogenic. Clinical presentation included breathlessness, vomiting, fever, polyuria, poor weight gain and irritability. 63 % of IODM with onset less than 6 months and 30 % of IODM with onset more than 6 months were of low birth weight. Nearly 85 % of the study group had low c peptide levels. 84. 5 % of IODM with onset less than 6 months and 55 % of those with onset more than 6 months were monogenic. Wolcott Rallison syndrome was the commonest type encountered. Genetic diagnosis aided switching over from insulin to oral sulphonylurea in 5 children with KCNJ 11 and ABCC 8 mutations. Missed diagnosis, recurrent admissions for metabolic instability and developmental delay were common problems in IODM. Mortality at 12. 5 year follow up was 32. 5 %. CONCLUSIONS: IODM with onset at less than 6 months is predominantly monogenic and low birth weight is more common. 55 % of IODM were misdiagnosed at onset.

As mGFR decreased from 60 to 90 to < 20 ml/min per 1. 73 m 2, the prevalence of hyperparathyroidism increased from 17 to 85 %, anemia from 8 to 41 %, hyperphosphatemia from 1 to 30 %, metabolic acidosis from 2 to 39 %, and hyperkalemia from 2 to 42 %. Factors most strongly associated with metabolic complications, independent of mGFR, were younger age for acidosis and hyperphosphatemia, presence of diabetes for <b>acidosis,</b> <b>diabetic</b> kidney disease for anemia, and both male gender and the use of inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system for hyperkalemia. mGFR thresholds for detecting complications with 90 % sensitivity were 50, 44, 40, 39, and 37 ml/min per 1. 73 m 2 for hyperparathyroidism, anemia, acidosis, hyperkalemia, and hyperphosphatemia, respectively.

There is increasing recognition, however, of a group of acidotic patients who have a large anion gap that is not explained by either keto- or lactic acidosis nor, in most cases, is inappropriate fluid resuscitation or ingestion of exogenous agents the cause. Methods: Plasma ultrafiltrate from patients with <b>diabetic</b> ketoacidosis, lactic <b>acidosis,</b> acidosis of unknown cause, normal anion gap {{metabolic acidosis}}, or acidosis as a result of base loss were examined enzymatically for the presence of low molecular weight anions including citrate, isocitrate, α-ketoglutarate, succinate, malate and d-lactate. The results obtained from the study groups were compared with those obtained from control plasma from normal volunteers. Results: In five patients with lactic acidosis, a significant increase in isocitrate (0. 71 ± 0. 35 mEq l- 1), α-ketoglutarate (0. 55 ± 0. 35 mEq l- 1), malate (0. 59 ± 0. 27 mEq l- 1), and d-lactate (0. 40 ± 0. 51 mEq l- 1) was observed. In 13 patients with diabetic ketoacidosis, significant increases in isocitrate (0. 42 ± 0. 35 mEq l- 1), α-ketoglutarate (0. 41 ± 0. 16 mEq l- 1), malate (0. 23 ± 0. 18 mEq l- 1) and d-lactate (0. 16 ± 0. 07 mEq l- 1) were seen.

The main objections to this theory have been that the red cell has not only a slower metabolic rate (2) but also an anion pattern that differs mark-edly from that of other cells (3). In the studies here reported, erythrocyte base and water were measured during <b>diabetic</b> <b>acidosis</b> and recovery, and an attempt made to interpret the observed data in terms of a logical and orderly sequence of events, both within the erythrocyte and within other body compartments. The shifts found in base and water were qualitatively similar to those demonstrated previously by other workers in total intracellular base and water, using balance tech-niques (4 - 6). Furthermore, in most instances they were quantitatively reconcilable with changes that have been demonstrated in the anion com-position of the erythrocyte (7). This suggests that this readily available cell may serve as an in-dicator of intracellular base and water shifts in disease.

At autopsy the orbital tissues, meninges, and brain are invaded by fungus. Involvement of the paranasal sinuses has been noted in a few instances. In the past the fungus had not been isolated by culture and was classified as Mucor {{on the basis of}} its morphology in histologic preparations. The phycomycete Rhizopus oryzae of the order Mucorales has recently been isolated at autopsy in this laboratory from a diabetic patient who died with this infection. The clinical aspects of this unusual disorder, the autopsy findings, mycologic studies, and a review of the literature have already been reported.

40|$|In a {{previous}} paper (1) {{the nature and}} causes of the bicarbonate deficit and other serum electrolyte changes in <b>diabetic</b> <b>acidosis</b> were dis-cussed from a theoretical standpoint, and disordered electrolyte patterns actually observed were analyzed {{in the light of}} this theoretical discussion. It was pointed out that displacement of bicarbonate from combinations with base by ketone acids is a process which can be reversed completely with the contribution from outside sources of nothing except the ability to burn carbohydrate. Base in combination with ketone acids may be considered potential bicarbonate. On the other hand, the loss of base with ketone acids in the urine introduces an irreversible process, because base for the replacement of that sacrificed must come from external sources. Such base deficiences may become quite extreme, but ordinarily they are small compared with the deficiences of base combined with chloride. The actual extent of the body chloride losses is hardly evident from the concentrations of this ion found in the serum, because it i...|$|E

40|$|LIPEMIA retinalis {{is a rare}} {{complication}} of diabetes mellitus. Falls x stated in 1943 that only 61 cases of lipemia retinalis had been reported {{up to that time}} and that his case was the sixty-second. We wish to place on record an additional instance of this condition which was observed in a young white adult male who was admitted to Kennedy Veterans Administration Hospital in moderately severe <b>diabetic</b> <b>acidosis</b> and in whom both lipemia retinalis and skin lesions of xanthoma diabeticorum were observed.

Briefly, the term "lipemia retinalis,, was first used by Heyl 2 in 1880 when he described the appearance of the ocular fundi in a 20 year old male who was treated for diabetes mellitus. Heyl believed that the appearance of the retina was due to the presence of fat in abnormal amounts in the serum of the blood. Subsequent investigators confirmed the ophthalmoscopic findings. The majority of instances of lipemia retinalis had been noted in young male diabetic...|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} ten years there has been an {{increasing}} interest in the electrolyte structure of the blood. This interest grew from a realiza-tion of the impossibility of interpreting isolated changes in single constituents. Methods for partitioning the anions developed with much greater rapidity than did a similar approach to the cations. In 1923 the authors published with Loeb and Palmer a series of studies on the serum acids including a few base partitions. Although the acid determinations were quite consistent, base results were unsatis-factory due to the unreliability of the sodium and potassium methods. With the development of an accurate method for estimating total cations, a more satisfactory understanding of the total electrolyte structure is possible. This method has evolved slowly and in our hands has not been considered reliable prior to the past three years, when our data became sufficiently consistent to report. We have discarded most of our work before that time. Even before an acceptable method for total base appeared, Van Slyke and co-workers filled the only essential remaining gap in anion analysis by determining a formula for base bound to protein. It is now possible, therefore, to arrive at a fairly accurate picture of the total electrolyte distribution in serum. It is proposed in this paper to discuss the results obtained by studies carried out on normals and patients with pneumonia, nephritic acidosis, nephritic edema, and <b>diabetic</b> <b>acidosis.</b> A few observations during diuresis are included...|$|E
40|$|Plasma free {{fatty acids}} (also {{variously}} referred to as nonesterified fatty acids and unesterified fatty acids) have assumed importance as a small but very rapidly metabolized component of serum lipids (1, 2). Their derivation from the fat of adipose tissue has been demonstrated and may represent an important form in which stored fat is mobilized, transported and made available for fuel during starvation (3). The concentration of {{free fatty acids}} (FFA) in plasma increases during starvation (4), in the "metabolic " starvation of <b>diabetic</b> <b>acidosis</b> (5) and of hyperthyroidism (6). When an overnight fast is terminated by the administration of 50 to 100 g of carbohydrate, an abrupt fall in concen-tration of plasma FFA occurs within one-half hour and lasts for several hours, and a similar but less marked drop follows a protein meal (1, 2). On the other hand, following a fat meal of equal or greater caloric value, the FFA either do not change appreciably or rise {{much as they do}} during a similar period of fasting (2, 7). The decrease in concentration of FFA appears to occur in response to an-increase in carbohy-drate utilization. The absence of such a drop in concentration after a fat meal would seem to indi-cate insensitivity of the FFA regulatory system to fat or merely the substitution of FFA derived from ingested fat for those derived from adi-pose fat (3). An alternative possibility is herein suggested, namely that relative inefficiency of fat metabolism in persons adapted to a high car...|$|E
40|$|An {{enhanced}} urinary excretion of citrate after {{administration of}} alkali and a diminished citrate excretion after administration of ammonium chlo-ride were first observed by Ostberg in 1931 (1). More recently, {{it has been}} {{pointed out that the}} quantity of citrate excreted in the urine is not a direct consequence of acidification or alkaliniza-tion of the urine as believed by Ostberg, but rather is related to systemic pH (2). Hypercitraturia is associated with alkalosis and hypocitraturia with acidosis. This correlation appears to be inde-pendent of the mechanism of production of the al-tered acid-base balance. Thus, urinary citrate is diminished in <b>diabetic</b> <b>acidosis</b> (1, 3, 4), as a re-sult of the intracellular acidosis of potassium de-pletion (5, 6), and in the metabolic acidosis in-duced by acetazolamide (2, 7, 8), as well as by administration of NH 4 Cl, CaCl, and HCl. In-creased excretion of citrate in the urine has been observed during respiratory alkalosis (4, 6, 9) as well as during metabolic alkalosis. Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain this effect of altered acid-base balance on urinary citrate excretion. One hypothesis holds that al-terations of pH influence the synthesis of citrate and its subsequent secretion by renal tubules (10). This implies that the intracellular pH of the re-nal tubular cell influences substrate metabolism in the Krebs citric acid cycle with subsequent trans-port of metabolites from the renal cell into the tubular urine. The second hypothesis, based on data obtained by conventional clearance tech-niques (11, 12), suggests that acidosis results in *Work supported by research grant A- 2598 from th...|$|E
40|$|In 1874 Lehmann 50 {{noticed that}} {{injection}} of sugar into the mesenteric veins produced greater glycosuria in fasted than in fed dogs. In 1890 Hofmeister 40 {{found that the}} administration of starch-gruel to previously fasted dogs often provoked glycosuria. Since then the phenomenon of starvation diabetes has been repeatedly reported in one connection or another; but its implications have not been fully recognized {{in the interpretation of}} physiological experiments and haave received scant attention in the clinic. Its significance in connection with the treatment of <b>diabetic</b> <b>acidosis</b> has been especially neglected. The recent appearance, from one of the leading diabetic clinics, of a series of papers objecting to the use of glucose in the treatment of diabetic acidoisiS 42, 81, 82 has tempted the author to review the subject. t Because Barrenscheen 4 and Nagasuye 72 found that a single feeding of glucose after a 3 -day fast promoted no deposition of glycogen in the livers of dogs, starvation diabetes was first attributed to impairment of hepatic glycogenesis. Subsequent investigations have proved that this deduction was erroneous; the defect lies not in glycogenesis, but in the oxidation of glycogen by the tissues. Although this defect appears to be related to depletion of liver glycogen, this correlation is probably more or less fortuitous. Starvation diabetes seems to come on. when an animal is subsisting upon a diet of fat and protein and is dependent upon the latter for the provision of carbohydrate. By such devious paths and profuse experimental data have these conclusions been reached, that compre...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{recognized}} that a depression of the concentration of potassium in serum may reflect a concomitant deficiency of potassium in {{the cells of the}} body (1). Low concentrations of potassium in serum and diminished potassium contents of skeletal muscle have been reported in experimental animals maintained on diets deficient in potas-sium (2) and in animals treated with large doses of desoxycorticosterone (3). Depressions of the concentration of potassium in serum have been ob-served clinically in patients receiving desoxycorti-costerone (4), in familial periodic paralysis (5, 6), in <b>diabetic</b> <b>acidosis</b> (7, 8), in intestinal obstruc-tion (9), and in diarrhea (10). In some of these conditions deficit of cellular potassium has been indicated by negative balances of potassium when the intake of potassium was low and retention of potassium when the ion was administered (10 - 13). However, significant alterations in the cellular content of potassium may occur without much change in the amount and concentration of potas-sium in the extracellular fluid and serum (10, 14). Levels of serum potassium therefore, may, but do not necessarily, reflect the state of depletion or re-pletion of cellular potassium. The study reported here was undertaken in an attempt to elucidate some of the clinical problems of potassium deficiency in adult patients. These problems include the relation of the concentration of potassium in serum to cellular deficiency of the ion, the extent of such cellular deficiencies and their relation to retention of administered potas-sium, and the physiological abnormalities by which such deficits are produced...|$|E
