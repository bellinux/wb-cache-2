5|$|Costume {{designer}} Anthony Powell {{found it}} a challenge to create Connery's costume because the script required the character to wear the same clothes throughout. Powell thought about his own grandfather and incorporated tweed suits and fishing hats. Powell felt it necessary for Henry to wear glasses, but {{did not want to}} hide Connery's <b>eyes,</b> <b>so</b> chose rimless ones. He could not find any suitable, so he had them specially made. The Nazi costumes were genuine and were found in Eastern Europe by Powell's co-designer Joanna Johnston, to whom he gave research pictures and drawings for reference.|$|E
5|$|Mengele's {{experiments}} with eyes included attempts to change eye color by injecting chemicals {{into the eyes}} of living subjects and killing people with heterochromatic <b>eyes</b> <b>so</b> that the eyes could be removed and sent to Berlin for study. His experiments on dwarfs and people with physical abnormalities included taking physical measurements, drawing blood, extracting healthy teeth, and treatment with unnecessary drugs and X-rays. Many of the victims were sent to the gas chambers after about two weeks, and their skeletons were sent to Berlin for further study. Mengele sought out pregnant women, on whom he would perform experiments before sending them to the gas chambers. Witness Vera Alexander described how he sewed two Romani twins together back to back in an attempt to create conjoined twins. The children died of gangrene after several days of suffering.|$|E
5|$|The Olympic venues were {{designed}} to reflect Norwegian culture and character. The hall was designed to play on Scandinavian folklore, such as the Hall of the Mountain King in Henrik Ibsen's Peer Gynt and the caves of fairy-tale trolls. This has for instance been emulated {{through the use of}} shotcrete on the walls to give a dark and mysterious impression. Lighting is used to create high contrast, such as from the entrance which is dark with pools of light, to the main hall which is brightly lit, to emphasize its size. The dark entrance is also used to adjust the spectators' <b>eyes</b> <b>so</b> the main hall seems brighter. A contrast has also been used between the grandstands' slender lines and the coarse finish of the cavern rock. Red was chosen as the hall's main color because of natural occurrence of red in the rock. Glass tiles are used as they give associations to ice. Ventilation, energy and other installations use shine metal, representing silver embedded in the rock. The main hall is designed as an amphitheater with close contact between spectators and athletes.|$|E

25|$|In later stories, Lamia was cursed {{with the}} {{inability}} to close her <b>eyes</b> <b>so</b> that she would always obsess over {{the image of her}} dead children. Some accounts (see Horace, below) say Hera forced Lamia to devour her own children. Myths variously describe Lamia's monstrous (occasionally serpentine) appearance as a result of either Hera's wrath, the pain of grief, the madness that drove her to murder, or—in some rare versions—a natural result of being Hecate's daughter.|$|E
25|$|Lamia was a {{queen of}} Libya, whom Zeus loved. Hera turned {{her into a}} monster and murdered their {{children}}. Or, alternatively, she killed Lamia's children and the grief turned her into a monster. Lamia was cursed with the inability to close her <b>eyes</b> <b>so</b> that she would always obsess over {{the image of her}} dead children. Zeus gave her the gift {{to be able to take}} her eyes out to rest, and then put them back in. Lamia was envious of other mothers and ate their children.|$|E
25|$|As the {{conflict}} finally draws to a close, Estinien offers to seal away Nidhogg's <b>eyes</b> <b>so</b> their power {{could no longer}} be used for evil. However, Nidhogg's rage proves too great and his eyes overwhelm Estinien's psyche, possessing him and transfiguring his body into that of the great wyrm. With that, Nidhogg's shade escapes to rally his horde anew. Returning to Ishgard, the Warrior of Light receives a hero's welcome as Aymeric pledges to reconcile Ishgard's true past with the peace promised by the present. As Thordan's illegitimate son, he assumes temporary rule of Ishgard. Under this uneasy accord, Ishgard rejoins the Eorzean Alliance.|$|E

25|$|Read this {{carefully}} {{as it may}} save your life or {{the life of a}} relative or a friend. In the next few days, {{some or all of the}} cities named on the reverse side will be destroyed by American bombs. These cities contain military installations and workshops or factories, which produce military goods. We are determined to destroy all of the tools of the military clique that they are using to prolong this useless war. Unfortunately, bombs have no <b>eyes.</b> <b>So,</b> in accordance with America's well-known humanitarian policies, the American Air Force, which does not wish to injure innocent people, now gives you warning to evacuate the cities named and save your lives.|$|E
25|$|The {{siege of}} Jerusalem in 597BCE {{led to the}} city being {{overcome}} by the Babylonians, who then took the young King Jehoiachin into Babylonian captivity, together {{with most of the}} aristocracy. Zedekiah, who had been placed on the throne by Nebuchadnezzar (the Babylonian king), rebelled, and Nebuchadnezzar, who at the time (587/586BCE) was ruler of a most powerful empire, recaptured the city, killed Zedekiah's descendants in front of him, and plucked out Zedekiah's <b>eyes</b> <b>so</b> that that would be the last thing he ever saw. The Babylonians then took Zedekiah into captivity, along with prominent members of Judah. The Babylonians then burnt the temple, destroyed the city's walls, and appointed Gedaliah son of Achikam as governor of Judah. After 52 days of rule, Yishmael, son of Netaniah, a surviving descendant of Zedekiah, assassinated Gedaliah after encouragement by Baalis, the king of Ammon. Some of the remaining population of Judah, fearing the vengeance of Nebuchadnezzar, fled to Egypt.|$|E
500|$|As {{recounted in}} Ovid's Metamorphoses, {{the death of}} Argus Panoptes also {{contains}} an explicit celestial reference: [...] "Argus lay dead; so many <b>eyes,</b> <b>so</b> bright quenched, and all hundred shrouded in one night. Saturnia [...] retrieved those eyes to set in place among the feathers of her bird [...] and filled his tail with starry jewels." ...|$|E

500|$|During her career, she was {{described}} as [...] "the face of Argentine film", and through the years, many hailed her as having [...] "the most beautiful eyes in the world." [...] Bence liked {{to tell a story}} that Paul Newman once recounted that he wore sunglasses to hide his <b>eyes</b> <b>so</b> he would be known for his acting. She agreed that the work was the more important legacy. In November 2010, the journalist Daniel Gómez Rinaldi published a book entitled Amelia Bence: Los ojos más lindos del mundo, a biography of the actress.|$|E
500|$|The [...] is a {{heightened}} form of Sharingan introduced {{towards the end}} of Part I. At that time, the Mangekyō Sharingan is explained to be rare, even among the members of the Uchiha clan, and present only in those who have killed the person closest to them, be it their best friends, relatives, or significant others, either accidentally or intentionally. Madara Uchiha is stated to be the first person to awaken the Mangekyō Sharingan, which resulted in a common tradition for members of the Uchiha clan to follow his example by killing their friends, though an ability of the Mangekyō (Susanoo) had been used since {{the time of the first}} Sharingan user, Indra. In the case of transplanted eyes, when one of the eyes from the same eyeset awakens the Mangekyō, the other eye awakens the Mangekyō too; this happened when Kakashi killed his best friend, causing Mangekyō to awaken in both himself and Obito. As explained late in Part II, the event is the end result of the [...] "Curse of Hatred", in which the brain releases special chakra to the <b>eyes</b> <b>so</b> that the Sharingan eventually transforms into Mangekyō Sharingan. While benefiting from increased power, the Uchiha clan members who possess the Mangekyō Sharingan will start to lose their sanity, eventually descending to complete madness.|$|E
500|$|... "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] {{features}} {{the deaths of}} Patricia and Jimmy, who were both consumed by walkers. Alongside {{the deaths of the}} aforementioned characters, the episode's script initially called for the deaths of Hershel, as well as Shane Walsh and Randall, both of whom had died in the previous installment. Since Kirkman felt {{that there was a lot}} of potential development in Hershel, his death was scrapped from the script. Although plans to write off the character commenced earlier in the season, Mazzara opined that his hypothetical death would have carried no emotional resonance. [...] "The plan was always to whack Hershel, and I actually told Scott Wilson, 'Thanks for everything you've done, but in the next script we're going to kill off your character.' We started writing that and it felt like Hershel's death was playing as a plot device and we were getting no emotional resonance. It was just playing as a gratuitous death. This was one of those examples where we won't play a shocking death for the sense of death; we have to get something out of it. We got nothing out of it. If you look at the shot of Hershel looking back and seeing that barn burning and his farm completely lost to the zombies, that shot was well worth it because we see the farm was really a character and you can only see that through Hershel's <b>eyes.</b> <b>So</b> it was the right call to keep him alive." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That is Molly's Thomson's [...] "Seasons,"' {{said the}} brother, {{remember}}ing, {{as we are}} so apt to remember the old thing that had met his <b>eye</b> <b>so</b> often in the old house. 'Where did you get it?' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "He {{may follow}} us {{and try to}} make trouble," [...] {{returned}} Dave. [...] "He is very bitter--and so is Job Haskers. They'd put themselves out a whole lot to give us a black <b>eye,</b> <b>so</b> to speak." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{story begins}} with a dialog between two characters. The first asks the other [...] "You do know why you're here?", and the second replies: [...] "Yes, there's great {{confusion}} on earth, and the power that is has concluded the following: Perfect man has visited earth already and His voice was heard; The voice of imperfect man must now be made manifest; and I have been selected as the most likely candidate." [...] This statement is followed by [...] "Where's the Show" [...] and [...] "Let Me Be a Man". In the medley, Nelson depicts {{the birth of the}} character, who implores God to become a man. The song is followed by [...] "In God's Eyes", depicting the character learning to act as a good Samaritan. In [...] "Family Bible", the character describes his memories of and nostalgia for his childhood, the times with his family and the reading of the family Bible. [...] "It's Not for Me to Understand" [...] depicts the character praying, after watching a blind child listening to other children playing and finding himself unable to understand why God allowed that to happen. God replies to the Imperfect Man, [...] "It's not for you to reason why, you too are blind without my <b>eyes,</b> <b>so</b> question not what I command". In the last stanza, the character now expresses [...] his fear of the Lord and his reluctance to question the unfairness of the world again. The medley [...] "These Are Difficult Times / Remember the Good Times", describes the character's bad times and his recovery by remembering the good times.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Davros {{was designed by}} Nation to have created the Daleks in his image, and to also be a [...] "spokesperson" [...] for the Daleks as {{he felt it was}} [...] "boring" [...] listening to Daleks giving speeches. The design was inspired by the Mekon, a comic book character with no body but a [...] "green, dome-like head" [...] which Hinchcliffe remembered from his childhood. Davros attracted the attention of BBC prosthetics designer John Friedlander who agreed to come off another show to make Davros' mask. The latex mask was moulded to Michael Wisher's face by make-up artist Sylvia James. Wisher could even eat while wearing the mask. Regular latex instead of the more mouldable foam latex was used because the latter was too expensive. [...] The cast and crew regarded Davros' effects as a great technical achievement considering the budget and time period they worked in. Two children visiting Baker at the BBC studios were scared by Wisher in costume; they thought he was a statue at first. When sitting in Davros' Dalek-like base, Wisher wore knee pads and a kilt because trousers were too uncomfortable. To prepare during rehearsals, Wisher acted in a wheelchair with a paper bag over his head that only had slits cut out for his <b>eyes</b> <b>so</b> he would be used to the [...] "disorienting" [...] situation and be able to express himself without using his whole face. Wisher, a heavy smoker, put two holes {{in the top of the}} bag so he could smoke underneath it in rehearsals. Wisher also provided some of the voices for the Daleks with Roy Skelton; in some scenes, he was acting to his own pre-recorded dialogue.|$|E
500|$|The role of Kimberly Corman {{was given}} to Canadian actress A.J. Cook, who {{previously}} starred in the 1999 film The Virgin Suicides. Cook described her role as [...] "a very strong girl, very determined because her mother died a year earlier, {{right in front of}} her <b>eyes,</b> <b>so</b> she had to grow up quick." [...] Ellis described her role as [...] "a girl who can have some fun cause they're going on a trip and they're gonna have a good time, yet someone who can stand up to Clear, to come and challenge Clear on a race, and to bother with Clear." [...] Cook added that [...] "it's rare to find one strong female lead in a horror film, not to mention two [...]” Ellis and Perry were amazed by her sensitivity and vulnerability in her performance, and she was hired instantly. [...] " [...] were at the beginning of what's going to be a long successful career for her," [...] Perry cited. Michael Landes, who appeared in the TV series , was cast as Thomas Burke. Landes defined him as [...] "a real nice, decent guy who comes across this huge car accident [...] who is very intrigued to begin with" [...] and as [...] "the guy who bumps into the girl and he goes nuts as her protector." [...] Ellis pointed out that he [...] "just wanted to find someone who's young and who can relate to these kids. It wasn't an older guy, but still strong enough and yet sensitive. [...] brought this really good balance to his part." [...] Landes was cast a day after his audition, which caused flight schedule problems on his departure two days after and cancellation of his appointments.|$|E

2500|$|Dana {{describes}} Kevin: [...] "He was an unusual-looking white man, {{his face}} young, almost unlined, but his hair completely gray and his <b>eyes</b> <b>so</b> pale {{as to be}} almost colorless….I looked away startled, wondering whether I had really seen anger there. Maybe he was {{more important in the}} warehouse than I had thought. Maybe he had some authority..." [...] (Kindred, p.54) ...|$|E
2500|$|... {{in which}} he {{received}} a revelation that he was appointed by the Lord Jesus Christ to write The Heavenly Doctrine to reform Christianity. According to The Heavenly Doctrine, the Lord had opened Swedenborg's spiritual <b>eyes</b> <b>so</b> that from then on, he could freely visit heaven and hell and talk with angels, demons and other spirits and the Last Judgment had already occurred the year before, in 1757.|$|E
2500|$|Reeves {{described}} the creature's reaction to its surroundings thus: [...] "It’s this new environment that it finds frightening". To indicate this, Reeves suggested {{the addition of}} white in the creature's <b>eyes</b> <b>so</b> it would look similar to a spooked horse. The filmmakers generated and used the idea of parasites because the film could not realistically have scenes between the human protagonists and the enormous creature.|$|E
5000|$|Eye Guy (voiced by Richard Cansino) A multi-eyed {{monster that}} {{is prone to}} eye-related puns. He imprisoned Billy's cousin Will within the {{dimension}} inside his main <b>eye</b> <b>so</b> Rita could use his genius. This monster was destroyed by the Megazord.|$|R
50|$|A {{fluorescein}} angiography is {{a medical}} procedure in which a fluorescent dye is injected into the bloodstream. The dye highlights the {{blood vessels in the}} back of the <b>eye</b> <b>so</b> they can be photographed. This test is often used to manage eye disorders.|$|R
