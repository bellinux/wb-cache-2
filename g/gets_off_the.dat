According to Lost executive producers/writers/showrunners Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse, there are two main themes in the fourth season: [...] "the castaways' relationship to the freighter folk" [...] and [...] "who <b>gets</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> island and the fact that they need to get back". The fourth season was acclaimed for its flash-forwards, pace and new characters.|$|E

PSM3 described the game as [...] "a masterpiece of balance, of design, and the jewel in Sony's online crown." [...] UK magazine Edge described it as an [...] "instantly gratifying experience", also saying {{that the lack of}} a single-player campaign was made up for by [...] "its brilliantly implemented notion of flight and considered balance".

He felt that [...] "Hanabi" [...] "focuses strongly on her vocal qualities {{as well as some}} interesting phrasing [...] ", while he concluded that the song [...] "Close to You" [...] " [...] never quite <b>gets</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> ground, especially when compared to the ending track, [...] " [...] Greenberg, who had written the extended biography of Hamasaki on the same website, had listed [...] "Hanabi" [...] as one of her career standouts. CDJournal had reviewed each track on their mini-review. For [...] "Independent", the reviewer called it a [...] "upper dance tune" [...] and felt the song sounded [...] "aggressive." [...] For the second track, the reviewer commended the song's composition and production and called it a [...] "summery, refreshing dance tune." [...] However, slight criticism was directed on the chorus that needed [...] "minor adjustment." [...] For the third track, the reviewer felt that the song expressed the sadness of the end of summer through a Japanese fireworks motif, and praised her freely expressed world view.|$|E

After they retrieve the birds, Chandler suggests Joey keeps them.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reaction}} was not universally affirmative, but Richard Corliss of Time stated that Spielberg [...] "has energized each frame with allusive legerdemain and an intelligent density {{of images and}} emotions." [...] Janet Maslin from The New York Times called the film [...] "a visual splendor, a heroic adventurousness and an immense scope that make it unforgettable." [...] Julie Salamon of The Wall Street Journal wrote that the film as [...] "an edgy, intelligent script by playwright Tom Stoppard, Spielberg has made an extraordinary film out of Mr. Ballard's extraordinary war experience." [...] J. Hoberman from The Village Voice decried that the serious subject was undermined by Spielberg's [...] "shamelessly kiddiecentric" [...] approach. Roger Ebert gave a mixed reaction, [...] "Despite the emotional potential in the story, it didn't much move me. Maybe, like the kid, I decided that no world where you can play with airplanes can be all that bad." [...] On his TV show with Gene Siskel, Ebert said that the film [...] "is basically {{a good idea for}} a film that never <b>gets</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> ground." [...] Siskel added, [...] "I don't know what the film is about. It's so totally confused and taking things from different parts. On one hand, if it wants to say something about a child's-eye view of war, you got a movie made by John Boorman called Hope and Glory that was just released that is much better, and much more daring in showing the whimsy that children's view of war is. On the other hand, this film wants to hedge its bet and make it like an adventure film, so you've got like Indiana Jones with the John Malkovich character helping the little kid through all the fun of war. I don't know what Spielberg wanted to do." ...|$|E

She boards a train to Palermo, and as the train pulls away, Sandro runs after it and jumps aboard. On the train Claudia is annoyed, saying, [...] "I don't want you with me." [...] She says it would be easier if they sacrifice now and deny their attraction, but Sandro sees no sense in sacrificing anything.

2500|$|The other style, the [...] "ghost rider," [...] when {{performed}} correctly, can {{be faster}} than the [...] "dismount to mount" [...] style, but has the tendency to be more dangerous, {{which is one of}} the reasons why it is no longer taught to rookies during rookie week. In order to perform the exchange the rider goes through all the same steps as in the [...] "dismount to mount" [...] exchange, except, instead of stepping off the bike, the rider sets the handlebars and then grabs hold of the seat. Once set, the rider will push herself off the back of the bike while it is still moving. As long as the handle bars stay in line and the rider clears the back wheel, then the bike will keep going straight on its own until the other rider grabs hold and jumps on. The name [...] "ghost rider" [...] comes from the fact that when the first rider <b>gets</b> <b>off,</b> <b>the</b> bike keeps going as if someone were really still on it, like a ghost. There are several risks to this exchange. The first is if the first rider doesn't set the handle bars properly, then when she lets go, the bike will swerve and the rider will be thrown from the bike, and possibly take out other members of hers or other teams. Any rider performing this exchange must also be careful to clear the back wheel of the bike or else face the inevitable injuries associated with this type of accident. Another risk is that the second rider can miss the bike and it will cut into other teams exchanges or even worse, race traffic. In the women's race, the only team to consistently use this technique is Kappa Alpha Theta.|$|E

2500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Paul [...] "Coy" [...] Allen and was filmed in November 2009. The video uses the version of the song that features only SoShy because Nelly's verse was recorded after Timbaland and SoShy filmed the music video. On November 16, 2009, Rap Up released a 50-second preview/teaser of what the video will entail. The video premiered exclusively on Timbaland's official website on November 22, 2009. The video is an estimated 7 minutes in length, longer than the song itself, featuring a story plot which begins with a girl who has been studying for a year in Italy, talking to her mother {{on the phone and}} then a friend who convinces her to go to a nightclub. [...] While she's talking the camera gives a closeup of a birthmark or scar in the shape of two overlapping circles. [...] On the way to the club, she is being tracked by a wall-walking vampire, as well as a black cat and Timbaland's character. [...] As the vampire moves in on her, Timbaland's character zips in between them without her noticing. [...] The cat changes into the form of a Japanese businessman to board the bus after her where SoShy appears singing her verses, and as she <b>gets</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> bus, SoShy intercepts the cat/businessman keeping him from leaving the bus after her. The girl meets yet another man at the club who appears to be a friend or lover, but as they are dancing, she notices a woman staring at her strangely while two other dancers mime a vampire attack on the dance floor. [...] Rattled, she runs out and her companion follows to comfort her and asks her to tell him what she saw, to which she replies [...] "I think I saw a vampire". This scene is very similar to the iconic scene in Twilight upon which the video is based.|$|E
