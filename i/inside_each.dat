5|$|Red Rackham's Treasure (1944) {{tells of}} the {{adventure}} Tintin and his friends undertake to recover the lost treasure of the pirate Red Rackham, believed by Tintin to be aboard the shipwrecked Unicorn. Sir Francis had built three models of the Unicorn and had hidden a treasure map <b>inside</b> <b>each</b> one. The adventure, told across both books, leads Tintin to the Unicorn and to the lost treasure.|$|E
5|$|The Ficus genus is {{composed}} of 800 species of vines, shrubs, and trees, including the cultivated fig, defined by their syconiums, the fruit-like vessels that either hold female flowers or pollen on the <b>inside.</b> <b>Each</b> fig species has its own fig wasp which (in most cases) pollinates the fig, so a tight mutual dependence has evolved and persisted throughout the genus.|$|E
5|$|The premaxillary bones {{each house}} a single incisor, {{which is located}} at the front tip. They end in a V shape at the front margin and in a narrow point at the back margin. <b>Inside</b> <b>each</b> premaxilla is a large opening, the {{anterior}} palatal foramen. The maxillary bone contains the other upper teeth. The mandible ranges from thin to robust and houses the lower teeth.|$|E

5|$|A {{resolution}} to this apparent inconsistency {{is offered by}} inflationary theory in which a homogeneous and isotropic scalar energy field dominates the universe at some very early period (before baryogenesis). During inflation, the universe undergoes exponential expansion, and the particle horizon expands much more rapidly than previously assumed, so that regions presently {{on opposite sides of}} the observable universe are well <b>inside</b> <b>each</b> other's particle horizon. The observed isotropy of the CMB then follows from the fact that this larger region was in causal contact before the beginning of inflation.|$|E
5|$|Replacement of the ship's -tall, -wide lower masts in {{wood was}} not feasible, {{so they were}} made of steel tube cut and welded to shape, with a ladder <b>inside</b> <b>each</b> mast to allow access to the {{platforms}} on the masts. The three masts and the bowsprit were stepped in place between September 1984 and February 1985. Warriors engines, boilers and auxiliary machinery were considered too expensive to rebuild, so replicas were built from sheet steel with a few components made from cast iron to duplicate the look of the real equipment. The replica engines can rotate slowly, using electrical power, to allow visitors to imagine how they might have looked in operation.|$|E
5|$|The hoard was {{concentrated}} {{in a single}} location, within the completely decayed remains of a wooden chest. The objects had been grouped within the chest; for example, pieces such as ladles and bowls were stacked <b>inside</b> <b>each</b> other, and other items were grouped in a way consistent with being held within an inner box. Some items had been disturbed by burrowing animals and ploughing, but the overall amount of disturbance was low. It was possible to determine the original layout of the artefacts within the container, {{and the existence of}} the container itself, due to Lawes' prompt notification of the find, which allowed it to be excavated in situ by professional archaeologists.|$|E
