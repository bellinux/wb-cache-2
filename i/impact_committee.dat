40|$|Background: Increasing {{numbers of}} women {{veterans}} (WV) present an organizational challenge to a healthcare system that primarily serves men. WV use reproductive services traditionally not provided by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Objective: Examine the association of organizational factors and adoption of comprehensive women’s health (WH) care in the VHA. Study Design: Cross-sectional secondary analysis of the 2007 VHA Survey of Women’s Veterans Health Programs and Practices. Methods: Dependent measures were (a) model of women’s health care: separate women’s health clinic (WHC), designated women’s health provider within primary care (DWHP), both (WHC/DWHP), or neither and (b) availability of five basic WH services: cervical cancer screening and evaluation and management of: vaginitis, menstrual disorders, contraception and menopause. Exposure variables were organizational factors drawn from an adaptation of the Greenhalgh model of diffusion of innovations including structural factors, measures of absorptive capacity and system readiness for innovation. Results: Compared to sites with DWHP or neither, WHC and WHC/DWHP were more likely at facilities with: a gynecology clinic, an academic affiliation, a WH representative on high <b>impact</b> <b>committee,</b> and {{a greater number of}} WV. Academic affiliation and high <b>impact</b> <b>committee</b> remained significant in multivariable analysis. All five basic WH services {{were more likely to be}} offered at sites with WHC or WHC/DWHP, remaining significant after adjusting for organizational factors. Conclusion: Facilities that adopt WHC are associated with greater absorptive capacity (academic affiliation and WH representation on high-impact committees) and are more likely to deliver basic WH services.

In order to bring additional rigor to the Fund's approach to program impact assessment an <b>impact</b> assessment <b>committee,</b> comprised of RBF trustees and staff, was established in March 2012. This committee continued the work of the Fund's 2003 Foundation Performance Assessment Committee that provided guidance to efforts to streamline internal processes, solicit grantee feedback on the RBF's funding approach, and conduct program reviews at regular intervals to assess program impact. The task for the 2012 <b>Impact</b> Assessment <b>Committee</b> was to further define and embed regular program review and impact assessment activities in the Fund's institutional processes in a manner that supports its program approach and grantmaking style. Principles and Conclusions to Guide the Fund's Approach to Impact The <b>Impact</b> Assessment <b>Committee</b> developed the following principles to guide the Fund's approach to impact assessment. * The Fund's impact assessment approach is rooted in its mission and its program goals and reflects and supports the RBF grantmaking style as captured in its program statement. It must be flexible enough to work across the Fund's six programs and their respective evolving contexts. * Given the nature of the RBF's grantmaking, a wide range of indicators and information is needed to understand the impact the Fund is having on a field or issue. * The Fund's approach to impact assessment is action-oriented. It enables staff and trustees to better understand the effectiveness of our grantmaking in light of the context in which our grantees are working, make mid-course corrections as necessary, and identify opportunities to share our insights with external audiences. * Impact assessments focus on the contribution of the Fund's grantmaking to a field or issue over the long term; staff monitor indicators of progress over the near and medium term. * The impact assessment process should add value to Fund and grantee work, not create administrative and financial burdens...|$|R

The House of Commons departmental select committees were designed to address this concern but their record has been mixed. This three-year project will pursue in-depth analysis of the select committee system - employing interviews, documentary and data analysis - designed to address some fundamental questions: How do accountability mechanisms develop and work at Westminster? Is government subjected to rigorous scrutiny? How can scrutiny by select committees, and by extension, parliament, be improved? The project has three research perspectives. First, it will analyse select committees {{through the lens of}} social psychology and the insights of the group processes literature, to help answer a key question: how do MPs manage their party identities in the context of 'all-party' committee environments? Second, it will probe the 'scrutiny universes' inhabited by select committees, universes which can expand or contract depending on the nature of individual committees and the way they perceive their scrutiny job. Finally, it will explore the <b>impact</b> of select <b>committee</b> scrutiny on parliament, government and the media, by examining how select committee work is discussed in the House of Commons, how government actors perceive the scrutiny <b>impact</b> of select <b>committees,</b> and also how th...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to detect the <b>impact</b> of audit <b>committee</b> {{characteristics}} on Lebanese financially distressed and non-distressed banks. Four characteristics of the audit committee are being examined; size, composition, frequency of meeting and financial expertise. The sample includes 54 ebanese banks with fiscal years-end between 2009 and 2011. The financially distressed and non-distressed banks have been identified from bank profitability. Our Results show that the financial distress of banks has a significant negative relation with the meeting frequency of the audit committee. Hence, the evidence suggests that the meeting frequency of audit committee members is an important factor as it helps the audit committee to hinder the financial distress of the bank. Meeting frequency plays an important role to ensure audit committee effectiveness. In other words, the audit committee with frequent meetings is able to help audit committee members to ensure the integrity of financial reporting, to provide better monitoring and to review effectively the operations.

In particular, the study examined the <b>impact</b> of audit <b>committee</b> characteristics (independence, size, frequency of meeting and financial expertise) on earnings management in periods prior to and following the transformation program (2003 - 2009). As of 31 December 2010, there were 33 public-listed companies categorized as Government-Linked Companies (GLC Transformation Policy, 2010) and there were 20 firms that have complete data that resulted in the total number of firm-year observations to 120 for six years (years 2003 - 2009).   Results show that the magnitude of earnings management as proxy of financial reporting quality is influenced by the audit committee independence. Agency theory was applied to explain audit committee, as a monitoring mechanism as well as reducing agency costs via gaining competitive advantage in knowledge, skills, and expertise towards financial reporting quality. The study is important as it provides additional knowledge about the <b>impact</b> of audit <b>committees</b> effectiveness on reducing the earnings management, and assist practitioners, policymakers and regulators such as Malaysian Institute of Accountants, Securities Commission and government to determine ways to enhance audit committees effectiveness and improve the financial reporting of GLCs, as well as improving the quality of the accounting profession...|$|R
