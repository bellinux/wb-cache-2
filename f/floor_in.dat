5|$|An ally of Senator Richard Mentor Johnson, who was {{a primary}} voice against the {{practice}} of debt imprisonment, Rowan made a notable speech denouncing the practice on the Senate <b>floor</b> <b>in</b> 1828. A consistent opponent of internal improvements and tariffs, even those that would benefit his own constituents, he voted against a measure allocating federal funds {{for the construction of}} a road connecting the cities of Lexington and Maysville. The vote was ill-received by the people of the state, and Rowan's popularity took a significant hit. When the bill was re-introduced in the next congressional session, Rowan voted for it only after receiving significant pressure from the state legislature to do so. The bill passed in this session, but newly elected president Andrew Jackson vetoed it.|$|E

While he initially kept the infection private, Gardiner made his condition public on December 23, 1932. Even though he was ill, Gardiner played the next night in Toronto. Though his fifty-five saves were the deciding factor in the Black Hawks win and his performance was so good that both league President Frank Calder and Maple Leafs star forward Charlie Conacher praised him, he was so sick he would collapse on the dressing room <b>floor</b> <b>in</b> between periods with a fever of over 100 degrees Fahrenheit; after the game Gardiner was rushed to a local hospital.

5|$|From series {{three of}} Robot Wars, the Gauntlet and Trial stages of each heat were dropped, {{with the whole}} of the main {{competition}} formed around direct combat. Razer's first battle of the series was against Backstabber. Scott lowered Razer's arm into an extrusion on Backstabber, and Lewis pushed their opponent into the 'pit', an open hole in the arena <b>floor.</b> <b>In</b> the second round, despite causing damage to Aggrobot, Razer lost due to a mechanical failure: the valve which controls the direction of hydraulic fluid in the arm jammed, causing Razer's arm to raise to its full height and refuse to lower. With its rear wheels off the ground, Razer was weaponless and immobile, and eliminated early from the main competition once more. Outside of the main UK championship, Razer won the concurrent Pinball Warrior Tournament side event and retained the Best Design award.|$|E
5|$|Harding {{had spoken}} out against lynching in his April 1921 speech before Congress and {{supported}} Congressman Leonidas Dyer's federal anti-lynching bill, which passed the House of Representatives in January 1922. When {{it reached the}} Senate <b>floor</b> <b>in</b> November 1922, it was filibustered by Southern Democrats, and Lodge withdrew it so as to allow the ship subsidy bill Harding favored to be debated (it was likewise filibustered). Blacks blamed Harding for the Dyer bill's defeat; Harding biographer Robert K. Murray noted that it was hastened to its end by Harding's desire to have the ship subsidy bill considered.|$|E
5|$|In 1865–1867 Captain Thomas Chaloner and William Downing Bruce {{carried out}} the first major {{excavation}} by cutting a trench across the site.

Evidence of the 1289 fire was discovered in the form of pieces of fused metal – an amalgam of lead, silver and iron that had melted and penetrated the <b>floor</b> <b>in</b> the heat of the fire. The Office of Works carried out excavations in 1932 in conjunction with work to consolidate the walls and grounds so they could be opened to the public. Further work was carried out by Roy Gilyard Beer between 1947–54 for the Ministry of Works, which exposed more of the site and cleared material from the 19th century.|$|E
