500|$|The {{painting}} was purchased in 2006 by the National Portrait Gallery, London, with funds raised through their 150th anniversary gala, {{after more than}} nine months' consideration. The cost was rumoured {{to be more than}} £100,000, though Zarin gives a price of £95,000. The acquisition was criticised by Starkey, who said, [...] "if the National Portrait Gallery has public money to burn, then so be it ... depends on mere hearsay and tradition, and it is not good enough". Foley countered, [...] "The evidence has been supported by people who know far more about the science of painting than David Starkey. I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>his</b> problem is– is it because he didn't find it?" ...|$|E
500|$|General Howe {{spent the}} winter {{planning}} {{a campaign to}} capture {{the seat of the}} rebel Congress, Philadelphia. [...] The constant skirmishing throughout the winter had taken its toll on his troops stationed in New Jersey, and even a major attack on the Continental Army outpost at Bound Brook in April had not been entirely successful. [...] Howe apparently did not divulge his plans or his intended route to Philadelphia to many people, and General Washington did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>his</b> intentions were, although Philadelphia was one target he suspected Howe was interested in. [...] On May 29, Washington moved most of his army from its winter quarters near Morristown to a strong position at Middlebrook in the Watchung Mountains from which he could observe and interfere with British moves toward Philadelphia.|$|E
500|$|President Reagan professed that he {{was unaware}} of the plot's existence. He opened his own {{investigation}} and appointed two Republicans and one Democrat (John Tower, Brent Scowcroft and Edmund Muskie, known as the [...] "Tower Commission") to investigate the scandal. The commission could not find direct evidence that Reagan had prior knowledge of the program, but criticized him heavily for his disengagement from managing his staff, making the diversion of funds possible. A separate report by Congress concluded that [...] "If the president did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>his</b> national security advisers were doing, he should have." [...] Reagan's popularity declined from 67% to 46% in less than a week, the greatest and quickest decline ever for a president. The scandal resulted in fourteen indictments within Reagan's staff, and eleven convictions.|$|E

500|$|But {{where he}} will be missed the most will be among {{those people who have}} been sharers of his bounty. [...] Their name is legion. [...] He gave quietly, but he gave liberally. [...] It was true of him that he did not let his right hand <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>his</b> left hand did. [...] Very {{frequently}} the recipient of his bounty could only guess from whence the gift came. [...] He aided the needy in distress in thousands of ways. [...] He seemed to have some occult way of finding out that people needed assistance at certain times, and then he knew how to come to their aid without offending. [...] Hundreds whom the public would never dream had needed his assistance blessed his name as they gazed upon his features for the last time, because he came to them in a substantial way at a critical time. [...] This is where and by whom he will be missed the most. [...] Truly he was a great man.|$|E
500|$|In January 1987, Congress {{announced}} it was opening {{an investigation into the}} Iran–Contra affair. Depending upon one's political perspective, the Congressional investigation into the Iran–Contra affair was either an attempt by the legislative arm to gain control over an out-of-control executive arm, a partisan [...] "witch hunt" [...] by the Democrats against a Republican administration or a feeble effort by Congress that did far too little to rein in the [...] "imperial presidency" [...] that had run amok by breaking numerous laws. The Democratic-controlled United States Congress issued its own report on November 18, 1987, stating that [...] "If the president did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>his</b> national security advisers were doing, he should have". The congressional report wrote that the president bore [...] "ultimate responsibility" [...] for wrongdoing by his aides, and his administration exhibited [...] "secrecy, deception and disdain for the law". It also read that [...] "the central remaining question {{is the role of the}} President in the Iran–Contra affair. On this critical point, the shredding of documents by Poindexter, North and others, and the death of Casey, leave the record incomplete".|$|E
2500|$|Tsuyokiss Nigakki is {{the sequel}} to Tsuyokiss where Leo was not in love to anyone in the first term. [...] At the {{beginning}} of the second term, Leo has been worried about what to do after graduation because he does not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>his</b> dream is. Then, Serebu Tachibana transfers to his class and she sits down next to him.|$|E

2500|$|... "I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>his</b> {{feelings}} were regarding his death," [...] Joseph Cotten later wrote. [...] "He {{did not want}} a funeral; {{he wanted to be}} buried quietly in a little place in Spain. He wanted no memorial services..." [...] Cotten declined to attend the memorial program; instead he sent a short message, ending with the last two lines of a Shakespeare sonnet that Welles had sent him on his most recent birthday: ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{was said}} of Taylor (see Haygarth and Nyren in particular) {{that he was}} an [...] "admirable" [...] cover field and a strong thrower. [...] As a batsman, he was a great hitter but [...] "didn’t guard his wicket well enough" [...] and had a {{tendency}} to cut at straight balls [...] "like Beauclerk later". [...] He was also an effective bowler and took many wickets, though we don’t <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>his</b> pace was. [...] Nyren commends Taylor on his fielding and says {{he was one of the}} best ever seen.|$|E
2500|$|On Sunday, March 1, 1992, Gabriel Erem, {{the editor}} of Lifestyles Magazine told Schneerson that on the {{occasion}} of his ninetieth birthday they would be publishing a special issue and wanted to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>his</b> message to the world was. Schneerson replied that [...] "'Ninety,' in Hebrew, is ‘tzaddik,’ which means ‘righteous.’ And that is a direct indication for every person to become a real tzaddik - a righteous person, and to do so for many years, until 120." [...] This message, Schneerson added, applies equally to Jews and non-Jews.|$|E

6000|$|... "Or {{have you}} got his writing to any document? Have you {{anything}} {{to show that he}} <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>his</b> son was doing when he borrowed money of you? Is it not perfectly clear that he knew nothing about it?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Also, in {{a reading}} that Berryman gave at the Guggenheim Museum with Robert Lowell in 1963, he {{discusses}} {{the character of}} Henry by saying, [...] "Henry has a hard time. People don't like him, and he doesn't like himself. In fact, he doesn't even <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>his</b> name is. His name at one point seems to be Henry House, and at another point {{it seems to be}} Henry Pussycat[...] [...]He [...] has a 'friend' who calls him [...] Mr. Bones, and I use friend in quotation marks because {{this is one of the}} most hostile friends who ever lived." [...] Controversially, the unnamed [...] "friend," [...] to whom Berryman refers, speaks in a Southern, black dialect and in [...] "blackface," [...] as Berryman indicates, suggesting a kind of literary minstrelsy.|$|E
2500|$|Cindy McCain, wife of John McCain. Before {{appearing}} on stage, a video tribute honoring Cindy McCain {{was shown to}} the delegates. She then appeared and introduced the seven McCain children. McCain portrayed her husband as a [...] "straight talker" [...] and a father who, by example, has passed his love of his country onto his children. She avoided criticizing Democratic nominee Barack Obama, rather she praised her husband, saying, [...] "He has shown the value of self-sacrifice by daily example and, above all John showers us with the unconditional love and support every family dreams of. I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>his</b> children say of him. And his courageous service to America in war and peace leaves no doubt what our forefathers would make of him." [...] She also showed her support for Vice Presidential nominee Sarah Palin, all before her husband took the stage.|$|E
2500|$|On April 29, Cervera steamed from Cape Verde. Panic {{gripped the}} U.S. populace, {{who did not}} <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>his</b> ships might do: attack the largely undefended East Coast while the fleet sailed about {{in an effort to}} engage him, prey upon American shipping, or perhaps sail up the Potomac and set fire to Washington, D.C. Ultimately, Cervera did none of these, {{managing}} to evade the U.S. fleet for several weeks, confounding his American counterparts, and re-coaling in the process before finally seeking refuge in the harbor of Santiago de Cuba. On May 29, 1898, an American squadron sighted Cervera's newest ship, the Cristobal Colon, and immediately established a blockade around the mouth of the harbor. The Spanish soon found themselves [...] "blockaded closely by an American semicircle of ships about six miles from the Morro by day, and moving discreetly closer after nightfall." [...] Moreover, by early July the Spanish were nearly surrounded at Santiago from the east by an advancing American army numbering some 16,000 soldiers, by 3,000 Cuban insurgents to the west, and by the American fleet to the south.|$|E
50|$|The Molinist {{claims that}} in this example, God <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>His</b> free creatures would choose under {{hypothetical}} circumstances, namely that the Sodomites would have responded {{in such a way}} that Sodom would still have been in existence in Jesus' day.|$|R
60|$|And thus, Bashti, {{with a fine}} fresh idea {{inside his}} head, bowed his chief's head in consent that his people could flock aboard and trade. Very few of them <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>his</b> idea was or that he even had an idea.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{nonsense}} are you talking, old cock?" [...] says Mr. Brummell; [...] "Wales {{was never}} here. His late Majesty George IV. passed through {{on his way}} to Hanover. My good man, you don't seem to <b>know</b> <b>what's</b> up at all. What is he talkin' about the siege of Calais? I lived here fifteen years!

60|$|Clayton {{opened his}} fingers.
