40|$|Arguably {{the most}} {{important}} task in creation of software is user requirement specification. Accurate requirement specification allows avoidance of errors in late stages of software development. This is extremely important in critical systems, where even vague error can cause great financial losses or even human victims. One of {{the methods used for}} precise user requirement specification is use of formal specifications. Formal specification is a mathematical method for describing of software or hardware, which might be suitable for system realization. Nevertheless, the construction of formal specifications does not guarantee the correctness of specification. For this reason <b>formal</b> specification <b>validation</b> is necessary. In this paper methods of <b>formal</b> specification <b>validation</b> are discussed. Two most popular methods of <b>formal</b> specification <b>validation</b> are reachable state graph analysis and invariant checking. Reachable state graph analysis consists of graph generation and graph analysis. Graphs can be analyzed for dead-ends, closed loops, state reach ability checking, coordinate restriction checking or invariant checking. Traditional reachable graph generation algorithm uses unanalyzed states queue to produce reachable state graph. Each step single state is analyzed and depending on results new vertex or edge is added to state graph. An improvement to the algorithm to consider is usage of parallel programming to process multiple states simultaneously. This allows increasing the speed of algorithm execution, since multiple states will be processed in time just one state was processed. Experiments with single channel processing systems showed, that usage of parallel reachable state generation algorithm for solution of this problem increased analysis performance by up to 35 %, depending on number of states...|$|R
