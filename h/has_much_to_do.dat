5|$|This {{beautiful}} and stylish player was unlucky to emerge {{on the horizon}} of big cricket {{at a time when}} NSW had virtually an international side for its State XI. When his opportunity did come, Alan proved a real stalwart. In addition, his Trumperian style must have influenced for good vast numbers of young boys. Unquestionably, the line of Trumper and Kippax <b>has</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the grace and elegance which is more frequently associated with players from NSW than from other States.|$|E
5|$|The {{terrain of}} the {{peninsula}} <b>has</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the geology of the Aegean Region in general. The peninsula was shaped into its current form over several geological eras with the tectonic merging of Paleozoic schist formations, Mesozoic limestone and marble deposits, and finally the accretion of large clays and other sediments during the Neogene period. This is partly because of Turkey's unstable fault block terrain, {{and because of the}} close proximity of the Anatolian-Aegean plate boundary, which generates massifs of mountains all across western Turkey. This includes the peninsula and the mountains surrounding the Büyük Menderes River, known collectively as the Menderes Massif.|$|E
25|$|The Western Theater {{typically}} receives {{less attention}} than the Eastern Theater. This <b>has</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the greater proximity {{of action in}} the east to capitals and to major population centers. However, some historians consider it the war's most important theater. While the Eastern Theater essentially remained in stalemate until 1864, Union troops in the west, beginning in 1861, were able to steadily surround and drive back the Confederate troops, forcing them into eventual capitulation. This was done through a steady series of Union victories in major battles, interrupted by only a single defeat, which took place at Chickamauga.|$|E

25|$|The {{doctrine}} of the limited scope (or extent) of the atonement is intimately tied up with the {{doctrine of}} the nature of the atonement. It also <b>has</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the general Calvinist view of predestination. Calvinists advocate the satisfaction theory of the atonement, which developed in the writings of Anselm of Canterbury and Thomas Aquinas. In brief, the Calvinistic refinement of this theory, known as penal substitution, states that the atonement of Christ pays the penalty incurred by the sins of menthat is, Christ receives the wrath of God for sins and thereby receives in himself the penalty of the sins of men.|$|E
25|$|Newer {{versions}} of the firmware contain the option to choose between five overclock ("turbo") presets that when used, attempt to maximize {{the performance of the}} SoC without impairing the lifetime of the board. This is done by monitoring the core temperature of the chip, the CPU load, and dynamically adjusting clock speeds and the core voltage. When the demand is low on the CPU or it is running too hot the performance is throttled, but if the CPU <b>has</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> and the chip's temperature is acceptable, performance is temporarily increased with clock speeds of up to 1GHz depending on the individual board and on which of the turbo settings is used.|$|E
500|$|Sebastian {{reflected}} on his song's popularity, [...] "I guess its success {{is due to}} it being a well-written pop ballad, coupled {{with the fact that}} it's perfectly suited to my voice, and also my back-story... It doesn't take a genius to realise that the show was mostly responsible for the songs enormity but still, I'm glad I was the guy standing there at the end singing it". In a review for Sebastian's fifth number one single [...] "Who's That Girl" [...] in 2010 The Vines Tim Byron said [...] "Angels Brought Me Here" [...] was [...] "heavily associated with the climax of the show, and thus [...] pre-packaged meanings and associations that other songs will not ... something of the joy of music, of its eternal mystery, gets leached out in the process". Byron felt there was considerable [...] "controversy over whether to give ARIA awards to people like Guy Sebastian" [...] due to concerns about the artist's credibility. Byron added [...] "But it's hard to argue that Guy Sebastian's continued success, seven years later, <b>has</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with Australian Idol.....even his 'brand recognition' will have faded by now.....If he is still successful, it's more and more because of his musical talent." ...|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after her}} {{marriage}} to Hurley, Lloyd went to Bournemouth to recuperate from exhaustion. [...] Within days she was back performing in London music halls. From {{the start of the}} new century, music hall artistes and theatre managers had been in dispute over working conditions, a reduction in pay and perks, and an increased number of matinée performances. [...] The first significant rift was a 1906 strike, initiated by [...] The Variety Artistes' Federation. The following year, the Music Hall War commenced, which saw the Federation fight for more freedom and better working conditions on behalf of music-hall performers. Although popular enough to command her own fees, Lloyd supported the strike, acted as a picket for the strikers and gave generously to the strike fund. To raise spirits, she often performed on picket lines and took part in a fundraising performance at the Scala Theatre. During one demonstration, she recognised someone trying to enter and shouted, [...] "Let her through, girls, she'll close the music hall faster than we can." [...] The singer was Belle Elmore, later murdered by her husband, Dr. Crippen. The dispute ended later the same year with a resolution broadly favourable to the performers. In 1909, Lloyd appeared at the Gaiety Theatre in Dundee where a critic for The Courier noted [...] "Her bright smile and fascinating presence <b>has</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with her popularity, while her songs are of the catchy style, perhaps not what a Dundee audience is familiar with, but still amusing and of an attractive style." ...|$|E

RTÉ's coverage of the sport through ProBox live is also {{partly responsible for the}} surge in boxing's popularity in Ireland. [...] Sixteen of Irelands 28 Olympic medals were won in Boxing.|$|E
2500|$|The film {{takes place}} during {{the events of the}} Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War but {{attracted}} controversy over its fictional portrayal of historical British figures and atrocities. Professor Mark Glancy, teacher of film history at Queen Mary, University of London has said: [...] "It's horrendously inaccurate and attributes crimes committed by the Nazis in the 1940s to the British in the 1770s." [...] While {{it is clear that the}} actions of then-Colonel Banastre Tarleton were certainly despicable, they were nowhere near the atrocities in the film, especially with the infamous [...] "Burning church" [...] scene, of which there is no historical or written record. Australian film critic David Edwards asserts that [...] "this fictional story is set around actual events, but it is not a history of what America was, or even an image of what it has become—it's a dream of what it should be....The Patriot is a grand epic full of action and emotion....But it's also surprisingly insightful in its evaluation of the American ideal—if not the reality." [...] While, as critic Roger Ebert states, [...] "None of it <b>has</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the historical reality of the Revolutionary War".|$|E

2500|$|Plato often {{discusses}} the father-son relationship {{and the question}} of whether a father's interest in his sons <b>has</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with how well his sons turn out. In ancient Athens, a boy was socially located by his family identity, and Plato often refers to his characters in terms of their paternal and fraternal relationships. Socrates was not a family man, and saw himself as the son of his mother, who was apparently a midwife. A divine fatalist, Socrates mocks men who spent exorbitant fees on tutors and trainers for their sons, and repeatedly ventures the idea that good character is a gift from the gods. Plato's dialogue Crito reminds Socrates that orphans are at the mercy of chance, but Socrates is unconcerned. In the Theaetetus, he is found recruiting as a disciple a young man whose inheritance has been squandered. Socrates twice compares the relationship of the older man and his boy lover to the father-son relationship (Lysis 213a, Republic 3.403b), and in the Phaedo, Socrates' disciples, towards whom he displays more concern than his biological sons, say they will feel [...] "fatherless" [...] when he is gone.|$|E
