40|$|Early {{diagenesis}} (ED), {{the physical}} and biogeochemical changes undergone in surficial sediments, {{plays an important role}} in the biogeochemical cycles of key elements (carbon, nitrogen and oxygen) in highly productive shelf-seas. Modelling the process uses a relatively simple set of mathematical equations to represent the transport and reaction terms. We have calibrated an existing steady-state ED model, which we have expanded to include more processes and variables (e. g. mineralisation of organic matter using iron oxide and sulphate) to examine the fate of the nutrients through sediment water exchanges. Biogeochemical cycles can be affected by resuspension as a result of release or uptake of nutrients, which can also have a considerable effect on primary productivity. Resuspension is a wide-spread transport process in shallow seas due to winds, tides and biological activity. In contrast to previous <b>diagenetic</b> <b>modelling,</b> we aim to model resuspension and its effect on nutrient cycling. We will also study the resuspension effects on reactions such as the reoxidation or burial of reduced compounds and associated nutrients. We will present results from the modelling experiments, showing the relative role of various oxidising agents (oxygen, nitrate, iron oxide and sulphate) during the degradation of organic matter in the sediments. Observations made in the North Sea provide suitable data to calibrate the model. Current results show that the model is able to give realistic representations of sedimentary nutrient profiles from the North Sea. We aim to present preliminary results showing the effect of resuspension on the transport processes of nutrients across the sediment-water interface, and will discuss the implications that this may have on the calculation of nutrient budgets in continental shelf sea...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: <b>Diagenetic</b> <b>modelling,</b> the {{mathematical}} simulation of {{the breakdown of}} sedimentary organic matter and subsequent fate of associated nutrients, has progressed {{to a point where}} complex, non-steady state environments can be accurately modelled. A genetic algorithm has never been used in conjunction with an early diagenetic model, and so we aim to discover whether this method is viable to determining a set of realistic model parameters, which itself is often a difficult task. Materials and methods: A range of sensitivity analyses were conducted to establish the parameters for which the model was most sensitive before a micro-genetic algorithm (?GA) was used to fit an output from a previously published diagenetic model (OMEXDIA) to observational data, taken at the North Dogger site from a series of cruises in the North Sea. Profiles of carbon, oxygen, nitrate and ammonia were considered. The method allows a set of parameters to be determined in a manner analogous to natural selection. Each iteration of the genetic algorithm within each experiment decreases the variance between the observed profiles and those calculated by OMEXDIA. Results and discussion: Despite some of the observed profiles, particularly for carbon, showing unusual patterns, the genetic algorithm was able to generate a set of parameters which was able to fit the observations. The genetic algorithm can therefore help to determine the values of other parameters used in the model, for which observational values are difficult to measure (e. g. the flux of organic matter to the sediment from the overlying water column and the rates of degradation of organic matter). We also show that the values of the parameters determined by the ?GA technique are able to be used in a potentially temporally predictive manner. Conclusions: The ?GA used is a viable method to fit carbon and nutrient sedimentary profiles observed in complex, dynamic shelf sea systems, despite OMEXDIA originally being designed for a different sedimentary environment. The results therefore show that this novel use of a genetic algorithm is a suitable method for both model calibration and validation and that the technique may help in explaining processes which are poorly understood...|$|E
40|$|The Lower Acacus Formation {{consists}} of fourteen deltaic packages which change laterally across the Hamada Basin, NW Libya. Southern fluvial-channel sandstones prograded northward into coastal-deltaic sandstones and siltstones, {{and eventually to}} offshore-marine sandstones and shales. Each depositional environment in the Lower Acacus Formation produced a characteristic facies with specific compositional characteristics. [...] Petrographic and petrophysical properties of selected sandstone units within the Lower Acacus Formation indicate that the sandstones have been altered by the diagenetic processes of compaction, authigenesis, and dissolution. Three diagenetic facies are identified from the southern basin flanks to the northern basin centre respectively: (a) quartz-cemented facies, (b) carbonate-cemented facies, and (c) clay-cemented facies. Each of the diagenetic facies contains a characteristic authigenic mineral suite reflecting a specific sequence of alterations which are (a) quartz-overgrowths and iron oxide, (b) carbonate cementation and dissolution, and (c) clay authigenesis respectively. [...] Isotopic study of selected sandstone units reveals a diagenetic history involving meteoric fluids modified by increasing water/rock interactions and saline (connate) water mixing with burial. [...] The major types of porosity have a regional distribution related to type of grain framework, matrix and cement in each depositional facies. Dissolution of carbonate cements and unstable grains was the dominant process to create secondary porosity; such porosity being associated with the proximal deltaic facies. Preserved primary porosity is mainly associated with the fluvial-channel facies. Microporosity and some fracture porosity are the dominant porosity types in the distal deltaic and reworked marine- offshore facies. With continued diagenesis, differential cementation and dissolution redistributed porosity and modified primary porosities in the Lower Acacus Formation. [...] A multistage model of the leaching of carbonate cements and secondary porosity development is proposed. This includes: (I) a shallow depth (early) diagenetic stage wherein CO₂-charged meteoric waters flushed through channel systems of the fluvial sandstone facies {{in the southern part}} of the basin, and (2) a deeper (late) diagenetic stage mainly due to carbonic acid-rich waters expelled from maturing organic-rich Tanezzuft shales into the deltaic sandstone facies in the northern part of the basin. [...] Early diagenesis recognized in the different sandstones of the Lower Acacus Formation has major impact on the present-day hydrologic system across the Hamada Basin. Present-day hydrologic zones have a distribution which is spatially expanded relative to the Lower Acacus diagenetic zones and indicates the role of fluid flushing and dilution through time. [...] At the basin-wide scale the relationship between sandstone facies and the distribution of diagenetic elements is an important aspect of the Lower Acacus reservoir character heterogeneity. Recognized diagenetic facies heterogeneity includes: (1) iron-oxides and interstitial clay coatings associated with quartz-overgrowths in the quartz- cemented facies of fluvial origin, (2) calcite cement patterns in the carbonate-cemented facies of proximal deltaic origin, (3) ferroan-dolomite cement associated with the fine-grained, micaceous, clay-clast-rich sandstones of proximal deltaic origin, and with the reworked marine sandstone units, and (4) authigenic clay (kaolinite) and its effect on permeability throughout the various depositional facies. [...] Integration of the many data sets results in a basin-wide 3 -D geological model which includes four phases of major regional diagenetic changes: Phase I and II represent reduction of primary porosity and permeability in fluvial sandstone units. Phase III led to secondary pore formation and to modification of primary porosity in proximal delta front sandstone units. Phase IV represents pore-filling in distal delta front siltstones and reworked marine sandstone units. [...] Improved regional basin analysis and computerized basin modelling must consider and apply the variability expected from a multitude of parameters ranging from primary depositional processes to processes of burial and subsequent modification of formation characteristics. Commonly-applied generalizations regarding diagenesis as determined from individual well studies are inadequate and in many instances perhaps invalid for developing productive regional model. Use of regional <b>diagenetic</b> <b>modelling</b> integrated with depositional facies and basin analysis represents an initial step in predicting regions of maximum enhanced and preserved porosity in the subsurface. ...|$|E

40|$|In marine {{biogeochemical}} modeling, {{the sediment}} is usually represented by <b>diagenetic</b> <b>models,</b> but in shallow ecosystems these models are incomplete, {{because they do}} {{not take into account the}} benthic primary production. While microphytobenthos (MPB) is known to strongly impact mineralization pathways and nutrient fluxes, MPB is rarely integrated as an explicit variable. To investigate the impact of microphytobenthos on early diagenesis in sediment, we built a fine-scale dynamic model, based on the <b>diagenetic</b> <b>model</b> OMEXDIA and including MPB and associated processes. The model outputs were similar to a data set of MPB-colonized sediment sampled in Florida Bay, suggesting that the model can recreate a realistic situation. The model showed that MPB activities induced a strong diurnal rhythm on concentration profiles, fluxes, and mineralization processes. When MPB was present at the sediment surface, the total mineralization was strongly enhanced thanks to the supply of labile organic matter. In contrast, coupled nitrification-denitrification was inhibited by a factor of 3. 8. This inhibition can be explained by the competition for nitrate and ammonium between MPB and bacteria. Nitrogen uptake of MPB represented 96 % of the daily supply of dissolved inorganic nitrogen. This was more than 50 times greater than N consumption by denitrification. With MPB, sediment nitrogen flux to the water column was reduced by a factor of 70, suggesting that sediment colonized by MPB represents a minor source of nutrients for phytoplankton and bacterioplankton. Results showed that current <b>diagenetic</b> <b>models</b> are not well-suited for shallow ecosystems with significant MPB primary production. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The MEDIA (Modelling Early DIAgenesis) {{software}} package comprises a flexible and extensible software system that provides problem-solving assistance for simulating 1 D reactive transport in surface sediments. MEDIA allows multiple <b>diagenetic</b> <b>models</b> {{to be built}} by extending a model template with new model components from a toolbox of available objects (elements, species, parameters, reactions). A detailed review is given of the transport and reaction components available for model construction. Upon assemblage, the model is channelled to the numerical subunit of the MEDIA package. Via a canonical transformation, the user-defined mixed kinetic-equilibrium model is rearranged into a proper set of differential algebraic equations (DAE), for which both steady state and transient solutions can be calculated. Steady-state profiles are obtained either directly using a Newton-Raphson method, or alternatively, as the asymptotic result of a dynamic simulation. Dynamic simulations involve a global implicit procedure based on the stiff- ODE solver package VODE, employing a direct substitution approach {{to reduce the number}} of equations in the DAE system.

In this paper we use a two-layer, analytic <b>diagenetic</b> <b>model</b> applied in the North Sea coastal waters to derive simple mathematical relationships linking benthic N and P fluxes at the sediment water interface to organic matter inputs to the sediment.

The model was first verified by comparing nutrient and oxygen depth profiles and mineralization features along an eutrophication gradient with results obtained under the same conditions with a dynamic, vertically resolved model (OMEXDIA). The model was then applied to several stations in the North Sea characterized by different sediments and the results were compared with available data (NO 3, NH 4, PO 4 and O 2 sediment profiles and sediment–water fluxes). Finally, we performed numerous Monte-Carlo model simulations with different parameter values to derive simplified mathematical relationships of benthic N and P fluxes at the sediment water interface. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{changes that}} sediments undergo after {{deposition}} are collectively known as diagenesis. Diagenesis is not {{widely recognized as}} a source for mathematical ideas; however, the myriad processes responsible for these changes lead {{to a wide variety of}} mathematical models. In fact, most of the classical models and methods of applied mathematics emerge naturally from quantification of diagenesis.

Diagenetic problems of concern to modern mathematics exist in abundance; these include free-boundary problems that predict the depth of biological mixing or the penetration of O 2 into sediments, algebraic-differential equations that result from the fast-reversible reactions that regulate pH in pore waters, inverse calculations of input functions (histories), and the determination of the optimum choice in a hierarchy of possible <b>diagenetic</b> <b>models.</b> This review highlights and explores these topics with the hope of encouraging further modeling and analysis of diagenetic phenomena...|$|R
40|$|Microporous {{and tight}} limestones, with {{contrasting}} porosity and permeability values {{directly related to}} the microfabric of the micritic matrix, outcrop in the Urgonian Formation of the French Jura Mountains. This study investigates the factors controlling the differentiation between the microporous and tight facies, and proposes a <b>diagenetic</b> <b>model</b> for the development and preservation of the microporosity in these limestones. The petrophysical properties are not related to the depositional texture, the petrographical content or the mineralogical composition. However, the tight layers contain indications of emersion (e. g. : bird eyes, keystone vugs, and desiccation cracks). The sedimentation in very shallow conditions up to emersion is confirmed by the covariant more positive values of oxygen and carbon isotopes. The microporous intervals systematically occur a few meters below the tight layers affected by emersion. This position strongly suggests the importance of meteoric water input rapidly after sedimentation in the differentiation between tight and microporous limestones. The <b>diagenetic</b> <b>model</b> proposed for the development and preservation of the microporous facies involves partial early cementation of the interstitial mud, mainly composed of low-Mg calcite crystals (sedimentation during a calcite sea period), inside a meteoric phreatic lens by in situ dissolution–reprecipitation processes (“hybrid Ostwald ripening”). This early cementation partly preserves the original microfabric and intercrystalline microporosity and allows the carbonate sediment to resist compaction during burial. The identification of the conditions favorable to the development of microporosity in these Urgonian limestones may improve the knowledge and modeling of some microporous carbonate reservoir rocks...|$|R

40|$|Diagenetic {{processes}} are important drivers of water column biogeochemistry in coastal areas. For example, sediment oxygen consumption {{can be a}} significant contributor to oxygen depletion in hypoxic systems, and sediment–water nutrient fluxes support primary productivity in the overlying water column. Moreover, nonlinearities develop between bottom water conditions and sediment–water fluxes due to loss of oxygen-dependent processes in the sediment as oxygen becomes depleted in bottom waters. Yet, sediment–water fluxes of chemical species are often parameterized crudely in coupled physical–biogeochemical models, using simple linear parameterizations that are only poorly constrained by observations. <b>Diagenetic</b> <b>models</b> that represent sediment biogeochemistry are available, but rarely are coupled to water column biogeochemical models because they are computationally expensive. Here, we apply a method that efficiently parameterizes sediment–water fluxes of oxygen, nitrate and ammonium by combining in situ measurements, a <b>diagenetic</b> <b>model</b> and a parameter optimization method. As a proof of concept, we apply this method to the Louisiana Shelf where high primary production, stimulated by excessive nutrient loads from the Mississippi–Atchafalaya River system, promotes the development of hypoxic bottom waters in summer. The parameterized sediment–water fluxes represent nonlinear feedbacks between water column and sediment processes at low bottom water oxygen concentrations, which may persist for long periods (weeks to months) in hypoxic systems such as the Louisiana Shelf.

40|$|Highlights • An {{empirical}} <b>diagenetic</b> <b>model</b> includes redox-dependent P storage by microorganisms. • Sediment {{mixing and}} burrowing by animals strongly enhances P burial. • Supporting {{evidence for a}} decrease in oceanic P inventory in the early Paleozoic. Abstract A <b>diagenetic</b> <b>model</b> is used to simulate the diagenesis and burial of particulate organic carbon (Corg) and phosphorus (P) in marine sediments underlying anoxic versus oxic bottom waters. The latter are physically mixed by animals moving through the surface sediment (bioturbation) and ventilated by burrowing, tube-dwelling organisms (bioirrigation). The model is constrained using an empirical database including burial ratios of Corg with respect to organic P (Corg:Porg) and total reactive P (Corg:Preac), burial efficiencies of Corg and Porg, and inorganic carbon-to-phosphorus regeneration ratios. If Porg is preferentially mineralized relative to Corg during aerobic respiration, as many previous studies suggest, then the simulated Porg pool {{is found to be}} completely depleted. A modified model that incorporates the redox-dependent microbial synthesis of polyphosphates and Porg (termed the microbial P pump) allows preferential mineralization of the bulk Porg pool relative to Corg during both aerobic and anaerobic respiration and is consistent with the database. Results with this model show that P burial is strongly enhanced in sediments hosting fauna. Animals mix highly labile Porg away from the aerobic sediment layers where mineralization rates are highest, thereby mitigating diffusive PO 43 − fluxes to the bottom water. They also expand the redox niche where microbial P uptake occurs. The model was applied to a hypothetical shelf setting in the early Paleozoic; a time of the first radiation of benthic fauna. Results show that even shallow bioturbation at that time may have {{had a significant impact on}} P burial. Our model provides support for a recent study that proposed that faunal radiation in ocean sediments led to enhanced P burial and, possibly, a stabilization of atmospheric O 2 levels.

One of the most crucial factors {{for the application of}} <b>diagenetic</b> <b>models</b> is the accurate formulation of microbial degradation rates of particulate organic carbon (POC) and the coupled biogenic CH 4 formation. Wallmann et al. (2006) suggested a kinetic formulation considering the ageing effects of POC and accumulation of reaction products (CH 4 , CO 2 ) in the pore water. This model is applied to data sets of several ODP sites in order to test its general validity. Based on a thorough parameter analysis considering a wide range of environmental conditions, the POC accumulation rate (POCar in g/cm 2 /yr) and the thickness of the gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ in m) were identified as the most important and independent controls for biogenic GH formation. Hence, depth-integrated GH inventories in marine sediments (GHI in g of CH 4 per cm 2 seafloor area) can be estimated as: GHI = a · POCar · GHSZb · exp (&minus;GHSZc/POCar/d) + e with a = 0. 00214, b = 1. 234, c = &minus; 3. 339, d = 0. 3148, e = &minus; 10. 265.

The vertical distribution of macrofauna biomass generally followed the TOC (total organic carbon) profiles. The trophic structure reflected differences in relative quality of the organic matter. In the high amount-high quality TOC sediment at the German Eight station, most organisms were found at shallow sediment depths (< 2 cm), mainly feeding on freshly deposited or (re-) suspended material as interface or suspension feeders. Skagerrak sediments, containing a large amount of refractory organic matter, supported a small-sized deeply penetrating fauna (up to 20 cm) consisting mainly of deep-living deposit feeders and also endobenthic predators. Highest diversity of trophic groups, largest individual sizes and deepest distribution were found in sediment with organic matter of intermediate quantity and quality at the Frisian Front. The highly dynamic, coarse-grained Broad Fourteens sediments were very poorly inhabited, probably due to the extremely high hydrodynamic stress and low quantity of TOC. With the aid of a simple <b>diagenetic</b> <b>model,</b> we analysed the potential effect of bioturbation on the distribution of food in the investigated sediments. The model predicted for a given bioturbation coefficient that total mineralization rate at depth reaches an optimum when the arriving material is of intermediate quality, whereas it is not possible for macrofauna to redistribute the organic matter up to depth when the quality of the arriving material is high. The results of the <b>diagenetic</b> <b>model</b> agreed well with our characterization of the fauna community on the basis of principal bioturbation categories (species causing surface deposition, biodiffusion, conveyor belt transport).

Ocean margin sediments account for about 85 % of the materials accumulating in the ocean and about 80 - 90 % of the mineralization in marine sediments.

40|$|We used a <b>diagenetic</b> <b>model</b> to {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that manganese-rich layers in gas hydrate-bearing Arctic Ocean sediments are reliable time markers for interglacial periods. In the model, diagenesis is fuelled by two sources of reactive carbon: particulate organic carbon settling to the sediment surface, and methane diffusing up from deep gas hydrate deposits. The model includes oxidation of organic carbon and soluble reduced manganese by oxygen supplied continuously from an invariant bottom-water oxygen reservoir; reduction of particulate manganese by hydrogen sulfide generated through anaerobic methane oxidation; transport of dissolved oxygen and manganese by diffusion; and advective transport of particulate components by burial. [ [...] . ] Model runs reveal that, under idealized but realistic conditions for the Arctic Ocean, oxidation of upward-diffusing Mn(II) generates post-depositional manganese enrichments that cannot readily be distinguished from the manganese-rich sediment layers that accumulate during interglacials. This compromises the use of manganese-rich layers as proxies for interglacial periods. In contrast, manganese-rich layers may be used as first-order markers of interglacial periods in sediments where gas hydrates or other forms of reactive carbon are absent...|$|R
40|$|The {{amount and}} {{formation}} rate of methane in marine sediments {{is a crucial}} aspect when determining both the methane fluxes towards the ocean-atmosphere system {{and the potential for}} dissolved methane to form other phases (e. g. free gas and hydrate). Nevertheless, due to the low methane solubility at ambient pressure (ca. 1. 5 mM for average seawater temperature and salinity) methane degassing upon core retrieval limits the accuracy of methane concentrations measured above 1. 5 mM. While several tools have been developed that may tackle this problem (e. g. autoclave coring), these methods may not be readily available nor practical for the entire scientific community. Nevertheless, <b>diagenetic</b> <b>models</b> which simulate both δ 13 C-methane and δ 13 C-DIC (dissolved inorganic carbon) can not only be used to better infer methane concentration profiles, but may also provide a comprehensive method for constraining methanogenic and methanotrophic rates in a cost-efficient manner. Here, we demonstrate the application of these carbon isotope, reaction-transport models to both steady-state and transient geochemical conditions in sediments located both in the shelf and in the slope...|$|R

In Cormorant and Tern iilite particles are thin (20 - 40 A), lath-shaped and liable to damage during drying before air permeability measurement, leading to erroneously high pcrmeabilities. The magnitude of this drying effect (K~r conventional drying/Kair critical point drying) varies with illite morphology and the timing of hydrocarbon emplacement. In Tern pore-filling illites occur above and below the oil-water contact, and there is no significant difference in drying effect. In Cormorant, the drying effect is higher below the oil-water contact where a diversity of late diagenetic pore-filling illite morphologies occur. Injectivity tests on cores from Cormorant indicate that sea water injection will not lead to impairment of reservoir quality as a result of clay dispersal or other rock-related phenomena. Impairment occurred when flooding cores with produced water and was avoided by introducing divalent cations, saline brines or approximating in situ equilibriu...|$|R

The resulting lack of flexibility and extensibility, {{and the need for}} ground-level reprogramming, constitutes a major barrier for potential model users.

We have explored the advantages of object-oriented technology and the concept of a problem-solving environment {{to improve the quality of}} software for reactive transport modelling. A general blueprint for an object-oriented code for modelling early diagenesis is presented. The MEDIA environment consists of a toolbox of building blocks (element, species and process objects), which can be combined freely by the user to construct new models (without the need for recompilation).

40|$|We {{test whether}} organic matter degradability, mixing activity, and total {{sediment}} mineralization {{can be estimated}} by inversion of a coupled nonlinear numerical steady-state <b>diagenetic</b> <b>model.</b> We use a single data set comprising oxygen, nitrate, ammonium and organic carbon versus depth profiles from a slope station in the Goban Spur area (1034 m, Northeast Atlantic). Based on an extensive sensitivity analysis, it appears that (1) when using all data, the total mineralization rates can be determined with reasonable precision; bioturbation and degradability are less well constrained and (2) total mineralization rates can be determined based on nitrate and oxygen profiles only; estimates of organic matter mixing rates and degradability are refined when including the solid phase organic carbon profile. The bulk mixing rates obtained for organic carbon are one order of magnitude higher than mixing rates previously estimated from 210 Pb profiles, lending validity to the hypothesis that organic particles are mixed faster than inert particles. The degradability of the organic carbon prior to its incorporation in the sediment is {{in the order of}} 10 - 30 y - 1, indicating that mineralization in this slope station of the Goban Spur area is fueled mainly by freshly deposited organic matter...|$|R
40|$|Syngenesis versus {{epigenesis}} in the Kupferschiefer genetic {{model is}} still a matter of controversy. The title of the article {{seems to be a}} paraphrase of a well-known paper by WEDEPOHL (1971), “Kupferschiefer as a prototype of syngenetic sedimentary ore deposits”. It is intended, however, more as a paradigm for the genesis of the hydrogen-sulphide geochemical barrier, an important ore formation episode prior to heavy metal accumulation, which shows the utility of RENFRO’s (1974) epigenetic model. Barite mineralization in Lokve is a stratabound ore deposit conformably situated at the Permian-Triassic boundary. It bears only two ore minerals, barite and pyrite exclusively, separated into two distinct, juxtaposed horizons stretching for tens of kilometers. The discovery of cryptalgal fabrics and other conspicious sedimentary features in underlying siliciclastics with massive pyrite and surmounting barite-bearing dolomites supports their affiliation to a tidal flat facies and sabkha environment. Barite and pyrite accumulation were formed by an early diagenetic, bacteriogenic sulphate reduction in a peritidal muddy environment, concommitant to a widespread process of evaporative dolomitization. The early <b>diagenetic</b> <b>model</b> is supported by an analysis of the sedimentary facies, trace element geochemistry and sulfur isotope distribution along two vertical profiles across the stratabound barite and pyrite mineralization...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{measurements}} of dissolved oxygen (DO) along the Laurentian Trough revealed {{the presence of}} hypoxic waters in the bottom 50 meters of the water column of the Lower St. Lawrence Estuary (LSLE). In addition to {{the change in the}} oceanic regime on the continental shelf {{at the mouth of the}} Gulf of St. Lawrence proposed by others, a large sediment oxygen demand along the LSLE though to contribute to this DO depletion. To verify the latter hypothesis, I developed a laterally integrated, two-dimensional model of the DO distribution for the bottom waters of the Laurentian Trough. The fluid transport is parameterized in a simple advection-diffusion finite-element grid where the sedimentation of organic matter feeds the mineralization processes that lead to O 2 depletion in the deep waters. Using realistic parameters obtained from field data, the <b>diagenetic</b> <b>model</b> reproduces the measured sediment oxygen demands (SODs) along the Gulf of St. Lawrence portion of the trough but overestimates them in the lower estuary. Since our modeled estuary DO levels are comparable to the measured DO values when a large SOD is applied, we suggest that the oxygen fluxes, calculated from the DO gradients measured with micro-electrodes across the sediment-water interface of cores recovered in the LSLE, are underestimated...|$|R
40|$|Hydrocarbon {{exploration}} in The Netherlands has a chequered history from serendipitous oil shows via chance oil/gas discoveries {{to finding the}} largest continental European oil field in 1943, followed by finding the largest gas field {{in the world in}} 1959. The present contribution traces the development of moderate to good porosity/permeability trends in depositional facies of Zechstein Stassfurt carbonates in a ‘gas play’ intermediate in significance between the above two plays but all {{in the northern part of}} The Netherlands. Various depositional facies in the Stassfurt carbonates were turned into ‘carbonate fabric units’ by diagenetic processes creating or occluding the porosity/permeability. This formed moderate to good gas reservoirs in barrier-shoal, open-marine shelf and proximal-slope carbonates in the subsurface of the province of Drenthe in the NE Netherlands. The <b>diagenetic</b> <b>models</b> forming these carbonate fabric units are linked to the variety of facies in a depositional model which shows explain and predicts the reservoir trends. Such depositional/diagenetic facies are ‘translated’ into characteristic petrophysical values recognisable on wire line logs in uncored wells, and in characteristic seismic expressions that show these trends in undrilled areas. This approach has been proven to be effective in delineating porosity trends, visualised by 3 -D seismic in the Collendoornerveen field, and thus provides a new exploration ‘tool’ in hydrocarbon exploration...|$|R

A negative seasonal correlation was observed between oxygen consumption and coupled nitrification–denitrification rates in surface sediments. Elevated values of oxygen consumption rates were reached during warm periods (up to 87. 7 mmol m– 2 d– 1) whereas nitrification and denitrification rates remained close to the lowest rates reported for coastal sediments (values around 0. 021 to 0. 35 mmol N m– 2 d– 1 for nitrification and 0. 014 to 0. 045 mmol N m– 2 d– 1 for denitrification). A steady-state <b>diagenetic</b> <b>model</b> closely represented the seasonal negative correlation of oxygen uptake, coupled nitrification–denitrification rates, the vertical distribution patterns of pore water oxygen and the solid phase distribution of organic carbon when nitrification inhibition by sulfide was included. Simulation adjusted to field data also highlighted the importance of oxygen penetration depth in the seasonal variation of nitrification. The modelling indicated that anaerobic metabolism was the most significant pathway (65 to 80 %) during organic matter mineralization with a clear seasonal increase during warm periods. These warm periods were also characterized by the higher benthic demand of oxygen mostly used to re-oxidize the by-products from anaerobic reactions (from 57 to 82 %), the other part being used for carbon mineralization...|$|R
