40|$|Abstract. In {{this work}} {{numerical}} simulation and measurements of three-dimensional radiation patterns of a mobile handset {{model in the}} presence of a human head phantom were performed at 1800 MHz. Based on theoretical and experimental results, the influence of the human head on the radiation efficiency of the handset has been investigated as a function of the handset size and the distance between the head and the handset during its operation. Furthermore, the relative amount of the electromagnetic power absorbed in the head has been obtained. It was found that significant reduction of the absorbed power (about 50 %) with proportional increment of the handset radiation efficiency could be achieved by moving the phone for 1 cm only away from the <b>head.</b> <b>Agreement</b> between theoretical and experimental results was found to be very good...|$|R

40|$|Most {{syntactic}} {{accounts of}} affix order in inflection are actually “hybrid”: Closeness of affixes to stems reflects syntax, but {{the position of}} affixes w. r. t stems is determined by morphological stipulation.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} Spec <b>head</b> " <b>agreement,</b> {{construed}} as agreement under {{left to right}} Merge {{is not only a}} possible agreement configuration, but probably the only agreement configuration, contra Agree (Chomsl~ 2001). The first part addresses DP internal agreement in Maasai and English. The attested agreement patterns within the Maasai DP fall out from Spec <b>head</b> <b>agreement</b> (Koopman 2003 a, 2003 b). Attested and unattested agreement patterns fall out from the syntactic hierarchy and the derivation. English long distance agreement in the DP does not support Agree, as agreement can be triggered early in the derivation. The second part of the paper discusses individual cases that have been taken to provide support for Agree. I will show how each case is in fact consistent with Spec head, where the following play an important role: agreement can be triggered under pied-piping, accounting for long distance agreement in Tsez (Polinsky and Potsdam 2001) and agreement can be triggered low in the derivation, as in English existential constructions. A case study of nominative objects in Icelandic implements a Spec head account, and argues on the basis of morphological evidence that these constructions should he analyzed as double nominative constructions, with the verb agreeing with two nominatives. The analysis hears on the nature of inherent case (an argument is presented that inherent case must he decomposed), the structural location of nominative case, clausal structure, silent expletives, default agreement, double agreement and intervention effects. The latter are shown not to hear on Agree. I...|$|R
