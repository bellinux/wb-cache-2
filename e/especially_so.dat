5|$|All welding of {{tantalum}} {{must be done}} in an {{inert atmosphere}} of argon or helium in order to shield it from contamination with atmospheric gases. Tantalum is not solderable. Grinding tantalum is difficult, <b>especially</b> <b>so</b> for annealed tantalum. In the annealed condition, tantalum is extremely ductile and can be readily formed as metal sheets.|$|E
5|$|Molybdenum is also {{valued in}} steel alloys for its high {{corrosion}} resistance and weldability. Molybdenum contributes corrosion resistance to type-300 stainless steels (specifically type-316) and <b>especially</b> <b>so</b> {{in the so-called}} superaustenitic stainless steels (such as alloy AL-6XN, 254SMO or 1925hMo). Molybdenum increases lattice strain, thus increasing the energy required to dissolve iron atoms from the surface. Molybdenum {{is also used to}} enhance the corrosion resistance of ferritic (for example grade 444) and martensitic (for example 1.4122 and 1.4418) stainless steels.|$|E

5|$|The Charolais breed was small, {{and most}} closely {{physically}} resembled the Morvan horse, another now-extinct French type. The breed {{had a short}} head with small ears and a short, strong neck attached low on the shoulder. The body was short and rounded, with a broad croup and strong legs. They were {{generally considered to be}} small and inelegant. They were strong, robust and hardy, the last of these traits <b>especially</b> <b>so</b> before the breeding changes of the 19th century, and were known for their pulling power.|$|E
5|$|In frogs, the {{hind legs}} {{are larger than}} the fore legs, <b>especially</b> <b>so</b> in those species that principally move by jumping or swimming. In the walkers and runners the hind limbs are not so large, and the burrowers mostly have short limbs and broad bodies. The feet have adaptations for the way of life, with webbing between the toes for swimming, broad {{adhesive}} toe pads for climbing, and keratinised tubercles on the hind feet for digging (frogs usually dig backwards into the soil). In most salamanders, the limbs are short and {{more or less the}} same length and project at right angles from the body. Locomotion on land is by walking and the tail often swings from side to side or is used as a prop, particularly when climbing. In their normal gait, only one leg is advanced at a time in the manner adopted by their ancestors, the lobe-finned fish. Some salamanders in the genus Aneides and certain plethodontids climb trees and have long limbs, large toepads and prehensile tails. In aquatic salamanders and in frog tadpoles, the tail has dorsal and ventral fins and is moved from side to side as a means of propulsion. Adult frogs do not have tails and caecilians have only very short ones.|$|E
5|$|Religion {{has always}} been closely tied to European {{political}} affairs, and as such it {{played an important role}} during marriage negotiations. The 1572 wedding in Paris of the French princess Margaret of Valois to the leader of France's Huguenots, Henry III of Navarre, was ostensibly arranged to effect a rapprochement between the nation's Catholics and Protestants, but proved a ruse for the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre. After the English Reformation, matches between English monarchs and Roman Catholic princesses were often unpopular, <b>especially</b> <b>so</b> when the prospective queen consort was unwilling to convert, or at least practice her faith discreetly. Passage of the Act of Settlement 1701 disinherited any heir to the throne who married a Catholic. Other ruling houses, such as the Romanovs and Habsburgs, have at times also insisted on dynastic marriages only being contracted with people of a certain faith or those willing to convert. When in 1926 Astrid of Sweden married Leopold III of Belgium, it was agreed that her children would be raised as Catholics but she was not required to give up Lutheranism, although she chose to convert in 1930. Some potential matches were abandoned due to irreconcilable religious differences. For example, plans for the marriage of the Catholic Władysław IV Vasa and the Lutheran Elisabeth of Bohemia, Princess Palatine proved unpopular with Poland's largely Catholic nobility and were quietly dropped.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} observations {{focused on}} understanding the epochs and timescales {{of the formation}} and evolution of early-type galaxies, particularly those in clusters. We show that while early-type cluster galaxies are on average older and closer to coeval {{than their counterparts in}} the field, significant age spreads (a factor of two in massive ellipticals, more in low-mass galaxies, <b>especially</b> <b>SO's)</b> still exist in these objects. We then show that it is now possible to detect the evolution of early-type galaxies directly by comparing deep absorption-line spectroscopy of intermediate-redshift cluster galaxies with local cluster galaxies. We find that the stellar populations of early-type cluster galaxies do indeed evolve, at a rate that appears to be consistent with the cosmological lookback time...|$|R

Hamas spokesmen stated that their stance would not change, and that Abbas is not constitutionally permitted to call a referendum, <b>especially</b> <b>so</b> soon after the January elections.|$|E
25|$|By 1997, {{there were}} calls within the United Nations to draw all UN {{agencies}} working on development issues together; {{for the many}} UN Development Programmes, Funds, and Specialised Agencies were encroaching upon each other's activities.

25|$|Physical {{dormancy}} or {{hard seed}} coats occurs when seeds are impermeable to water. At dormancy break, a specialized structure, the ‘water gap’, is disrupted {{in response to}} environmental cues, <b>especially</b> temperature, <b>so</b> water can enter the seed and germination can occur. Plant families where physical dormancy occurs include Anacardiaceae, Cannaceae, Convulvulaceae, Fabaceae and Malvaceae.|$|R
