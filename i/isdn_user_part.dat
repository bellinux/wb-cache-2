For signalling, CS networks use <b>ISDN</b> <b>User</b> <b>Part</b> (ISUP) (or BICC) over Message Transfer Part (MTP), while IMS uses SIP over IP.

50|$|The {{limitation}} of IDSL {{is that the}} customer no longer has access to ISDN signaling or voice services. But for Internet service providers, who do not provide a public voice service, IDSL is an alternative way of using POTS dial service to offer higher-speed Internet access, targeting the embedded base of more than five million <b>ISDN</b> <b>users</b> as an initial market.|$|R
5000|$|A {{signalling}} gateway (SGW) interfaces {{with the}} signalling {{plane of the}} CS. It transforms lower layer protocols as Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP, an IP protocol) into Message Transfer Part (MTP, an Signalling System 7 (SS7) protocol), to pass <b>ISDN</b> <b>User</b> <b>Part</b> (ISUP) from the MGCF to the CS network.|$|E
50|$|Release cause {{codes are}} used to {{identify}} and debug any events occurring in <b>ISDN</b> <b>User</b> <b>Part</b> signaling. Every event in ISUP signaling generates a cause code number. Even for a normal ISUP call, a cause code is generated. There are lot of applications developed based on the cause code from ISUP signaling. Similarly Telecom operators trace for Causecodes to debug any call failures.|$|E
5000|$|BICC {{signaling}} {{messages are}} {{nearly identical to}} those in <b>ISDN</b> <b>User</b> <b>Part</b> (ISUP); the main difference being that the narrowband circuit identification code (CIC) has been modified. The BICC architecture consists of interconnected serving nodes that provide the call service function and the bearer control function. The call service function uses BICC signaling for call setup and may also interwork with ISUP. The bearer control function receives directives from the call service function via BICC Bearer Control Protocol (ITU-T recommendation Q.1950) and is responsible for setup and teardown of bearer paths {{on a set of}} physical transport links. Transport links are most commonly Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) or Internet Protocol (IP).|$|E

5000|$|The {{earliest}} deployed {{upper layer}} protocols in the SS7 suite were dedicated to the setup, maintenance, and release of telephone calls. [...] The Telephone User Part (TUP) was adopted in Europe and the Integrated Services Digital Network (<b>ISDN)</b> <b>User</b> <b>Part</b> (ISUP) adapted for {{public switched telephone network}} (PSTN) calls was adopted in North America. ISUP was later used in Europe when the European networks upgraded to the ISDN. [...] North America has not accomplished full upgrade to the ISDN, and the predominant telephone service is still the older Plain Old Telephone Service. Due to its richness and the need for an out-of-band channel for its operation, SS7 is mostly used for signaling between telephone switches and not for signaling between local exchanges and customer-premises equipment.|$|E
50|$|The SS7 {{protocol}} stack may be partially mapped to the OSI Model of a packetized digital {{protocol stack}}. OSI layers 1 to 3 {{are provided by}} the Message Transfer Part (MTP) and the Signalling Connection Control Part (SCCP) of the SS7 protocol (together {{referred to as the}} Network Service Part (NSP)); for circuit related signaling, such as the BT IUP, Telephone User Part (TUP), or the <b>ISDN</b> <b>User</b> <b>Part</b> (ISUP), the User Part provides layer 7. Currently there are no protocol components that provide OSI layers 4 through 6. The Transaction Capabilities Application Part (TCAP) is the primary SCCP User in the Core Network, using SCCP in connectionless mode. SCCP in connection oriented mode provides transport layer for air interface protocols such as BSSAP and RANAP. TCAP provides transaction capabilities to its Users (TC-Users), such as the Mobile Application Part, the Intelligent Network Application Part and the CAMEL Application Part.|$|E

In order to achieve this network, data links need to provide data speeds which allow applications to function properly. Many important networked applications require high bandwidth to perform effectively. This thesis presents an analysis of Basic Rate Interface (BRI) Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) as a data link technology for extending Local-Area Network (LAN) connectivity. Hardware and software capabilities are presented in detail. A representative <b>ISDN</b> <b>user</b> needs analysis is also provided. A study is made of an ISDN installation and implementation to determine if ISDN is a viable solution to extending LAN connectivity. Considerations of particular importance include Internet Protocol (IP) compatibility, bonding separate channels to act as a single 128 Kbps logical channel, and native support for IP multicast addressing.

Both of these standards rely on the use of Time Division Multiplex (TDM) as a media bearer and SS 7 as signalling bearer, where both bearers require use of very expensive telecom-specific hardware. The thesis proposes the solution to use RTP as media bearer and IP as signalling bearer towards the handset in GSM and only use TDM as media bearer and SS 7 as signalling bearer towards the VMS.

Each change in the specification of the product should be immediately checked formally against the requirements’ specification. This paper presents semi-automated system abstraction, automated model extraction, simulation, and formal verification of real-life complex SDL specification. Sound algorithms implemented in our sdl 2 pml automated model extraction tool preserve all properties of the SDL system. Sdl 2 pml includes our model of discrete time, abstraction, and support for all relevant SDL functionality and constructs such as dynamic process creation, rational data types, and communication with more than one process instance. To the best of our knowledge, most of them are not supported by any other known approach. We use our SpinRCP tool for simulation and formal verification of the extracted model with the Spin model checker. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach on <b>ISDN</b> <b>User</b> adaptation protocol from SI 3000 Softswitch. The extracted Promela model is the largest one ever processed by Spin.
