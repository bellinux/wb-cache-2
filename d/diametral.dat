50|$|A <b>diametral</b> {{compression}} test involves applying a stress load or {{force to the}} point where a material object is split in half (down the diameter of the object).

50|$|The polar {{triangle}} {{associated with}} a triangle ABC is defined as follows. Consider the great circle that contains the side BC. This great circle {{is defined by the}} intersection of a <b>diametral</b> plane with the surface.

The points B' and C' are defined similarly.|$|E
50|$|As Erdős also observed, {{the set of}} {{pairs of}} points realizing the {{diameter}} of a point set must form a linear thrackle: no two diameters can be disjoint from each other, because if they were then their four endpoints would have a pair at farther distance apart than the two disjoint edges. For this reason, every set of n points in the plane can have at most n <b>diametral</b> pairs, answering a question posed in 1934 by Heinz Hopf and Erika Pannwitz. Andrew Vázsonyi conjectured bounds {{on the number of}} diameter pairs in higher dimensions, generalizing this problem.|$|E

Many lines serve as connections from housing areas to the metro, railway or tram stations: many lines serve as local service or as feeder connections (metro and tram lines are primarily <b>diametral).</b> Main terminals of metropolitan buses are near metro stations: Černý Most, Zličín, Háje, Letňany, Nové Butovice, Želivského, Českomoravská, Kačerov, Budějovická, Depo Hostivař, Dejvická, Na Knížecí (Anděl), Skalka, Palmovka, Nádraží Holešovice, Florenc etc. Some suburban and long-distance buses stop at these stations. The main stations of long-distance buses are , Černý Most and Zličín.|$|E
50|$|Originally {{they had}} {{intended}} to mount the new engine in the Henschel-designed Tiger tank, but although the engine was smaller, in a <b>diametral</b> manner than the V-12 piston engine it replaced, its beginnings as the axial compressor-based BMW 003 aviation turbojet meant {{that it was too}} long to fit in the Tiger I's engine bay. Attention then turned to the Panther, which by this point in the war was to be the basis of all future tank production anyway (see the Entwicklung series for details). For experimental fitting, Porsche provided one of the prototype Jagdtiger hulls.|$|E
50|$|The engine has {{crosshead}} bearings so {{that the}} always-vertical piston rod allows a tight seal under the piston. Consequently, the lubrication of the engine is split: the cylinders and the crankcase use different lubricants, each being specialised for and dedicated to its role. The cylinders are lubricated by continual, timed injection of consumable lubricant, formulated to protect the cylinders from wear and to neutralise the acids formed during combustion of the high-sulfur fuels commonly used. The crosshead design reduces sideways forces on the piston, keeping <b>diametral</b> cylinder liner wear {{in the order of}} only about 0.03 mm per 1000 hours.|$|E

5000|$|At {{the top of}} the gyro assembly, {{above the}} compensator, right on center, is an exciter coil fed with {{low-voltage}} AC. Above that is a shallow black-painted wooden bowl, inverted. Inlaid in its surface, in grooves, are two coils essentially like two figure 8s, but shaped more like a letter D and its mirror image, forming a circle with a <b>diametral</b> crossover. One coil is displaced by 90 degrees. If the bowl (called an [...] "umbrella") is not centered above the exciter coil, either or both coils have an output that represents the offset. This voltage is phase-detected and amplified to drive two DC servo motors to position the umbrella in line with the coil.|$|E
50|$|Standard profile angles are {{established}} {{in connection with}} standard proportions of gear teeth and standard gear cutting tools. Involute gears operate together correctly after a change of center distance, and gears designed for a different center distance can be generated correctly by standard tools. A change of center distance is accomplished by changes in operating values for pitch diameter, circular pitch, <b>diametral</b> pitch, pressure angle, and tooth thicknesses or backlash. The same involute gear may be used under conditions that change its operating pitch diameter and pressure angle. Unless {{there is a good}} reason for doing otherwise, it is practical to consider that the pitch and the profile angle of a single gear correspond to the pitch and the profile angle of the hob or cutter used to generate its teeth.|$|E
50|$|When gear {{dimensions}} {{are in the}} metric system the pitch specification is generally in terms of module or modulus, which is effectively a length measurement across the pitch diameter. The term module is understood to mean the pitch diameter in millimeters divided {{by the number of}} teeth. When the module is based upon inch measurements, it is known as the English module to avoid confusion with the metric module. Module is a direct dimension, unlike <b>diametral</b> pitch, which is an inverse dimension ("threads per inch"). Thus, if the pitch diameter of a gear is 40 mm and the number of teeth 20, the module is 2, which means that there are 2 mm of pitch diameter for each tooth. The preferred standard module values are 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 25, 32, 40 and 50.|$|E
50|$|For any bounded set S in any metric space, d/2 ≤ r ≤ d. The first {{inequality}} {{is implied}} by the triangle inequality for {{the center of the}} ball and the two <b>diametral</b> points, and the second inequality follows since a ball of radius d centered at any point of S will contain all of S. In a uniform metric space, that is, a space in which all distances are equal, r = d. At {{the other end of the}} spectrum, in an injective metric space such as the Manhattan distance in the plane, r = d/2: any two closed balls of radius d/2 centered at points of S have a nonempty intersection, therefore all such balls have a common intersection, and a radius d/2 ball centered at a point of this intersection contains all of S. Versions of Jung's theorem for various non-Euclidean geometries are also known (see e.g. Dekster 1995, 1997).|$|E

A chamfered specimen is designed with four flats on the outer diameter {{for the purpose of}} creating sectors of variable wall thickness which establishes a more nearly plane strain state in the thinnest-gauge sections. Ramp-hold tests conducted in 40 MPa of iodine at 32 S’C show that at a measured <b>diametral</b> strain of 0. 88, chamfered specimens fail while regular tubing specimens require <b>diametral</b> strains of 2 % or greater for failure.
