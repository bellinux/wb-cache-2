50|$|In 1806 a <b>forge</b> {{was built}} near the Afon Lwyd {{to serve the}} ironworks. At {{about the same time}} a row of twelve cottages (<b>Forge</b> Row, Cwmavon) were built for the workers of the <b>forge.</b> The <b>forge</b> closed later but was revived in 1823, and Cwmavon House was built (sometime between 1825 and 1835) about 40m north of <b>Forge</b> Row for Mr Partridge, owner the <b>forge.</b> The <b>forge</b> closed in 1840 and many of the workers moved away.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1590s records exist of {{what became}} known as the Upper <b>Forge</b> at Lydbrook built by Thomas Bainham and later owned by Robert Devereux, second Earl of Essex. In 1628 it was {{described}} as standing on [...] "Hangerbury Common, below the King's Forge". By 1668 the Upper <b>Forge</b> had disappeared. Three other <b>forges</b> existed. The Middle <b>Forge</b> built in the 1590s was opposite what is now Beard's bakery building. After the demise of the original Upper <b>Forge,</b> the Middle <b>Forge</b> eventually took on the name of Upper <b>Forge.</b> The Lower <b>Forge</b> was built in 1610 (standing within two hundred yards from the Wye). Standing up-stream from the Upper <b>Forge</b> was the King's Howbrook <b>Forge</b> (also known as the Lydbrook <b>Forge)</b> built in 1612/13. This stood opposite what is now Brook House (was once the Yew Tree Inn). In March 1650 the <b>Forge</b> was demolished. Not far away and built in the same period was the King's Furnace powered by the Lyd (where the How brook joins the Lyd) this ceased by 1674. By the early 18th century only two <b>forges</b> existed, the Upper <b>Forge</b> (the renamed old Middle <b>Forge)</b> and the Lower <b>Forge.</b> In 1702 a further <b>forge</b> existed, although it location is now unknown, the New <b>Forge.</b> This <b>forge</b> was somewhere between the two others as it took on the name of 'Middle Forge'. By 1818 after many changes of hands both owners and tenants, the Partridge family dominated the iron works at Lydbrook. In 1622 there are details of a grist mill and a battering works nearby a disused cornmill. The Lower <b>Forge</b> became in its turn a Corn Mill. Existing also in Lydbrook around the 1690s was an Anvil making works.|$|R

5|$|In 1846, Bolckow and Vaughan {{built their}} first blast {{furnaces}} at Witton Park, founding the Witton Park Ironworks.

Three days later, he was charged under his real name {{for the murder of}} Gerard Lowe in a River View Hotel room some time between 8 March and 9. In subsequent hearings, he was additionally charged with forgery (<b>forging</b> Lowe's signature five more times to obtain cash and goods worth $3,200), vandalism (smashing the glass panel), possession of an offensive weapon (the electroshock weapon), and possession of a controlled drug (he had 24 sticks of cannabis {{at the time of his}} arrest).|$|E
5|$|Puddling process: The {{puddling}} process was known the ancient Chinese during the Han Dynasty by the 1st century AD. The improvement of steelmaking processes improved {{the overall quality}} of steel by repeated <b>forging,</b> folding, and stacking of wrought iron from pig iron to make swords.|$|E
5|$|Roman {{military}} equipment was mass-produced in state-run fabricae ("factories") which brought together advanced <b>forging</b> technology and skilled artisans. Roman weapons were mostly made of internally produced steel such as chalybs Noricus which {{was superior to}} unhardened iron. In contrast, <b>forging</b> technology, capacity and personnel were more limited in Germania libera, although {{there is evidence that}} production and standardization of equipment had greatly improved since the time of the Roman Principate. Steel-making was also known in Germania libera (spathae and rapier-like swords out of flexible steel were in use). But Alamanni production of sophisticated forge-products such as metal armour, helmets and swords was on a much smaller scale than the Romans'. Simple weapons such as axes and knives seem often to have been made of unhardened iron.|$|E

5|$|The Middle Ages brought {{advances}} in forge welding, in which blacksmiths pounded heated metal repeatedly until bonding occurred. In 1540, Vannoccio Biringuccio published De la pirotechnia, which includes {{descriptions of the}} <b>forging</b> operation. Renaissance craftsmen were skilled in the process, and the industry continued to grow during the following centuries.|$|E
5|$|Because {{titanium}} is {{resistant to}} corrosion by sea water, {{it is used}} to make propeller shafts, rigging, and heat exchangers in desalination plants; heater-chillers for salt water aquariums, fishing line and leader, and divers' knives. Titanium is used in the housings and components of ocean-deployed surveillance and monitoring devices for science and the military. The former Soviet Union developed techniques for making submarines with hulls of titanium alloys <b>forging</b> titanium in huge vacuum tubes.|$|E

25|$|However, {{the most}} evident {{trace of the}} iron {{industry}} {{in the region is}} the <b>forge</b> of Gysinge. This <b>forge</b> was established in 1668 initially for the production of arms. The <b>forge's</b> location permitted a good access to metal, extracted at the mine of Dannemora, to wood and to the energy of the Gysinge rapids. The <b>forge</b> grew rapidly and in the 18th century there were constructed around the <b>forge</b> homes, mills, stables, a manor and even a hotel. In the 18th century, the <b>forge</b> was {{one of the largest in}} the country, with 50 people working at the mill proper, and 3000 people connected to the <b>forge</b> in other ways. The <b>forge</b> was also the first in the world to use an oven for induction, the oven Kjellin. The <b>forge</b> closed at the beginning of the 20th century.|$|R

5|$|Drivers can {{get away}} with this rule-breaking due to their paper-based log books. As a driver records their time spent behind the wheel, there is very little to stop them from <b>forging</b> their log books. There is very {{superficial}} oversight and some drivers take advantage of this fact. Surveys indicate that between 25% and 75% of drivers violate the HOS. Other drivers maintain more than one log book, showing falsified versions to enforcement officers.|$|E
5|$|Early Neolithic era began around 5500 BCE {{with the}} arrival from the middle Danube area of people, who kept livestock, {{cultivated}} crops, made pottery and smooth-surface tools.

5|$|In its raw form, {{tungsten}} {{is a hard}} {{steel-grey metal}} that is often brittle and hard to work.
