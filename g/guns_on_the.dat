5|$|Royal Oak was {{initially}} armed with 24 smoothbore, muzzle-loading 68-pounder <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> main deck and 11 rifled breech-loading (RBL) Armstrong seven-inch, 110-pounder guns. Eight {{of these were}} also on the main deck {{and the other three}} served as chase <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> upper deck, two at the bow and one aft.|$|E
5|$|The British {{also built}} three emplacements for breech-loading (BL) <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fort's glacis.|$|E
5|$|An {{experimental}} fire-control {{director was}} fitted {{in the forward}} spotting top and evaluated in May 1910. The <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> forward turret roof were transferred to the superstructure in 1913–1914 and the roof guns from the wing turrets were remounted in the aft superstructure about a year later; all of the four-inch guns in the superstructure were enclosed to better protect their crews. In addition, a single three-inch (76mm) anti-aircraft (AA) gun was added on the former searchlight platform between the aft turrets. Shortly afterwards, the <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> aft turret were removed as were one pair from the superstructure. Around the same time another three-inch AA gun {{was added to the}} aft turret roof.|$|E

5|$|Several radars {{were added}} during the war. A Type 285 gunnery radar was mounted {{on top of}} the HACS {{director}} and a Type 271/73 surface search radar was installed abaft the two-pounder <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> forecastle.|$|E
5|$|The <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> forward turret roof were {{transferred}} to the superstructure in 1914 and the guns from the wing turrets were remounted in the aft superstructure in 1914–1915; all of the four-inch guns in the superstructure were enclosed to better protect their crews. In addition, a single three-inch (76mm) anti-aircraft (AA) gun was added on the former searchlight platform between the aft turrets. Shortly afterwards, the <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> aft turret were removed as were one pair from the superstructure. Around the same time another three-inch AA gun {{was added to the}} aft turret roof.|$|E
5|$|After the {{restoration}} of Charles II to the throne in 1660, {{a survey of the}} castle was carried out, which recommended repairs to the site. A survey carried {{out at the end of}} the 1730s suggested that the castle had ten artillery positions, but that there were not enough <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island to arm both the castle and the other defences, and that some of the guns that were available were unusable.|$|E

5|$|As soon as A and B Squadrons of the 11th Light Horse Regiment {{reached the}} town and dismounted, the 4th Machine Gun Squadron stopped their {{covering}} fire, to target the German or Ottoman machine <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right, which they silenced. Then the 4th Machine Gun Squadron galloped forward {{to take up a}} position at the western end of the town, while the two attacking squadrons dismounted, to approach the railway station buildings on foot.|$|E
5|$|During her Royal Navy {{service as}} HMS President, she was {{initially}} rated at 50 guns, {{although she was}} at this stage armed with 60 guns—thirty 24-pounders (10.9kg) on the upper deck, twenty-eight 42-pounder (19kg) carronades on the spar deck, plus two more 24-pounder <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> forecastle. In February 1817, she was again re-rated, this time to 60 guns.|$|E
5|$|In 1739, the War of Jenkins' Ear {{broke out}} between Britain and Spain, and the {{decision}} was taken to improve the defences at Cromwell Castle. Abraham Tovey, the Master Gunner at the nearby fortification known as the Garrison, constructed a large gun-platform for a battery of six <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> south-west side of the tower, possibly on top of any pre-existing 16th-century platform. A parapet protected the guns, a new entrance was cut into the main tower and other adjustments made.|$|E

5|$|Lion {{received}} a fire-control director between mid-1915 and May 1916 that centralised the pointing and firing {{of the guns}} {{under the command of}} the director positioned on the foremast. The turret crewmen merely had to follow pointers controlled by the director to align their <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> target. This greatly increased accuracy as it was easier to spot the fall of shells and eliminated the problem of the ship's roll dispersing the shells as each turret fired individually.|$|E
5|$|President and Endymion {{continued}} to England, arriving at Spithead on 28March. President was commissioned into the Royal Navy {{under the name}} HMS President. Her initial rating was set at 50 guns, although she was at this stage armed with 60 guns—thirty 24-pounders (10.9kg) on the upper deck, twenty-eight 42-pounder (19kg) carronades on the spar deck, plus two more 24-pounder <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> forecastle. In February 1817 she was again re-rated, this time to 60 guns.|$|E
5|$|Princess Royal {{received}} a fire-control director between mid-1915 and May 1916 that centralised fire-control under the gunnery officer who now fired the guns. To align their <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> target, the turret crewmen {{had to follow}} pointers whose position was transmitted from the director. This greatly increased accuracy as {{it was easier for}} the director to spot the fall of shells and eliminated the shell spread caused by the ship's roll as the turrets fired individually.|$|E

5|$|She {{received}} a fire-control director between mid-1915 and May 1916 that centralised fire control under the director officer who now fired the guns. The turret crewmen merely {{had to follow}} pointers transmitted from the director to align their <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> target. This greatly increased accuracy since the ship's roll no longer dispersed the shells as each turret fired on its own; also, the fire-control director could more easily spot {{the fall of the}} shells.|$|E
5|$|Sōryūs {{second wave}} {{consisted}} of nine A6M Zeros and seventeen D3As. The former attacked Naval Air Station Kaneohe Bay, losing one Zero to American anti-aircraft <b>guns.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> return trip, the Zero pilots {{claimed to have}} shot down two American aircraft while losing two of their own. The D3As attacked various ships in Pearl Harbor, {{but it is not}} possible to identify which aircraft attacked which ship. Two of them were shot down during the attack.|$|E
5|$|The {{armament}} of the Warrior-class ships {{was intended}} to be 40 smoothbore, muzzle-loading 68-pounder guns, 19 on each side on the main deck and one each fore and aft as chase <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> upper deck. This was modified during construction to ten rifled 110-pounder breech-loading guns, twenty-six 68-pounders, and four rifled breech-loading 40-pounder guns.|$|E

5|$|The entire battle lasted {{approximately}} {{one to two}} hours. Maximilian took refuge in Byczyna, but the Poles took control of his artillery and turned the <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> town. Before the Polish forces began their assault, Maximilian surrendered and was taken prisoner. The battle, therefore, ended up being the decisive victory for the Polish-Swedish faction.|$|E
5|$|The fort's {{armament}} {{was reduced}} {{during the war}} as other forts and batteries took over some of its duties. Two of the six-inch guns were shipped across the river to Cliffe Fort in 1914 and the QF <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> roof were withdrawn. An anti-aircraft battery was established north-west of the fort for defence against Zeppelins and enemy bombers.|$|E
5|$|The guns {{on top of}} Cochranes {{centreline}} 9.2-inch turrets {{were removed}} in 1915–16. The aftermost 3-pounder <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> superstructure were removed during 1917 {{as well as the}} guns on top of the forward 9.2-inch wing turrets. This reduced her total to twenty 3-pounder guns, excluding the AA guns. Cochranes foremast was converted to a tripod mast to support the weight of a fire-control director in 1917, but the director was not actually fitted until August 1918.|$|E
