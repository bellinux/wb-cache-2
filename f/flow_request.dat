40|$|A {{number of}} studies report that ICT sectors are {{responsible}} for up to 10 % of the worldwide power consumption and that a substantial share of such amount {{is due to the}} Internet infrastructure. To accommodate the traffic in the peak hours, Internet Service Providers (ISP) have overprovisioned their networks, with the result that most of the links and devices are under-utilized most of the time. Thus, under-utilized links and devices may be put in a sleep state in order to save power and that might be achieved by properly routing traffic flows. In this paper, we address the design of a joint admission control and routing scheme aiming at maximizing the number of admitted flow requests while minimizing the number of nodes and links that need to stay active. We assume an online routing paradigm, where flow requests are processed one-by-one, with no knowledge of future flow requests. Each <b>flow</b> <b>request</b> has requirements in terms of bandwidth and m additive measures (e. g., delay, jitter). We develop a new routing algorithm, E 2 -MCRA, which searches for a feasible path for a given <b>flow</b> <b>request</b> that requires the least number of nodes and links to be turned on. The basic concepts of E 2 -MCRA are look-ahead, the depth-first search approach and a path length definition {{as a function of the}} available bandwidth, the additive QoS constraints and the current status (on/off) of the nodes and links along the path.

For this purpose, IAC requires each node locally to estimate the channel utilization ratio and then to compare with the threshold {{to determine whether the}} current channel utilization has exceeded the minimum permissible threshold. If exceeded, each node is required to compute the available bandwidth and broadcast this information to all the interfering nodes. IAC requires all the receiving nodes to buffer these broadcasts and as a result, when a new <b>flow</b> <b>request</b> arrives at each node, it locally determines whether the incoming flow can be accepted by comparing the new flow requirement with the buffered bandwidth information.|$|E

In this technique, multiple paths are discovered among source and destination. Among the discovered routes, the optimal paths are selected based on bandwidth constraints, delay constraints and path stability. When any <b>flow</b> <b>request</b> is received, it is initially categorized as real time and non-real time flows where real time flows are given higher priority.

The Base Station (BS) estimates the parameters such as number of user requests, flow rate, queue length and received signal strength for each user and updates them periodically. When a request arrives at BS, buffer allocation factor is estimated by applying fuzzy logic over these parameters. Then the <b>flow</b> <b>request</b> with high buffer allocation factor is admitted first and rest of the flow requests waits in a queue. Upon new request arrival, if its buffer allocation factor is low, the request is rejected.

When a <b>flow</b> <b>request</b> arrives, the data packets are automatically admitted and the INSIGNIA component attempts to set up soft-state reservations. The data packets follow a directed graph set up by TORA. If an intermediate mobile device detects that it has insufficient available resources (e.g., by comparison to the channel idle time ratio (CITR)) or its queue is full beyond a certain threshold level, it notifies the previous device on the path. This device then attempts to route the session via different downstream devices. If all of the intermediate nodes' resources are sufficient to support at least the session's minimum required throughput, reservations are set up along the path, as in INSIGNIA. The merit of INORA is that multiple paths can cooperatively support the session; nevertheless, this is only under a simplified interference model.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Due to {{the strict}} {{requirements}} of emerging applications, per-flow admission control is gaining increasing importance. One way to implement per-flow admission control is using an onpath resource reservation protocol, where the admission {{decision is made}} hop-by-hop after a new <b>flow</b> <b>request</b> arrives at the network boundary. The next-steps in signaling (NSIS) working group of the Internet engineering task force (IETF) is standardising such an on-path signaling protocol. One of the reservation methods considered by NSIS is reduced-state mode, which, suiting the differentiated service (DiffServ) concept, only allows per-class states in interior nodes of a domain. Although there are clear benefits of not dealing with per-flow states in interior nodes—like scalability and low complexity—, without per-flow states the handling of re-routed flows, e. g., after a failure, is a demanding and highly non-trivial task. To be applied in carrier-grade networks, the protocol needs to be resilient in this situation. In this article, we will explain {{the consequences of a}} route failover to resource reservation protocols: Severe congestion and incorrect admission decisions due to outdated reservation states. We will set requirements that handling solutions need to fulfill, and we propose extensions to reduced-state protocols accordingly. We show with a set of simulated scenarios that with the given solutions reduced-state protocols can handle re-routed flows practically as fast and robust as stateful protocols...|$|E
