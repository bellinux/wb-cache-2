Although he received stock options for the commercials, Shatner says that reports {{that they are now}} worth {{hundreds of millions of dollars}} are exaggerated. Shatner was also the CEO of the Toronto, Ontario-based C.O.R.E. Digital Pictures, a special effects studio that operated from 1994 to 2010.|$|E
25|$|Film scholar Greg Jenkins <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>a</b> {{detailed}} analysis of the adaptation of the novel as a screenplay. The novel is in three parts. The film greatly expands the relatively brief section in Part I, about the boot camp on Parris Island, and essentially discards Part III. This gives the film a twofold structure, telling two largely independent stories connected by the same characters acting in each. Jenkins believes this structure is a development of concepts that Kubrick has had since the 1960s. At that time, Kubrick talked about wanting to explode the usual conventions of narrative structure.|$|E

Abby Sunderland from the USA (sister to Zac Sunderland) departed on 23 January 2010, on a journey similar to Perham's.

The 16-year-old Laura Dekker from The Netherlands became the youngest solo-round-the-world sailor, albeit with planned stops. She finished in Sint Maarten on 21 January 2012.|$|E

25|$|Tayler Marshall (2006–11; {{character}} {{introduced in}} 2003) portrays Kenzo Harper. Kenzo {{is the youngest}} member of the Harper household, son of Janey, grandson of Ben and Susan and nephew of Michael and Nick. Even at such a young age, he's shown a massive intelligence which at times even rivals, and at times even beats, Michael's. At the end of series nine, he <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>a</b> project about his family and he tells them his teachers want him to see a psychologist. As portrayed by Tayler Marshall, Kenzo bears a striking resemblance to his uncle Nick (Kris Marshall). Before becoming Kenzo in 2006, Tayler Marshall portrayed a guest at Kenzo's third-birthday party in 2005.|$|E
25|$|Davydova {{also participated}} in the 1981 World Championships, her last major {{international}} event. The USSR won team gold. Davydova contributed more points towards the Soviet team score than anyone else. She {{finished third in the}} all-around final after an improper landing in the balance beam event. Had she not sat down on her beam dismount she would have won gold. Davydova suffered a serious neck injury in pre-competition warm up but still finished 3rd AA and was the only gymnast from any nation to make all 4 event finals. Davydova was the total points top scoring gymnast at the 1981 World Championships. She won silver on floor and bronze on bars. She would have won gold on vault but was unable to stand the incredibly difficult vault of her own invention, full twist on front tuck off. Jackie Fie, the US Head Judge on vault at the 81 World championships wrote that if the other vaults were to be marked out of 10 then Davydova's one should be scored out of 10.5. Davydova's vault was the pinnacle of the event. It was the most difficult vault of the competition – in either women's or men's gymnastics. Davydova {{is the only one who}} <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>a</b> vault that a male gymnast has not. Until Gabrielle Douglas 2015, she was the only IOC Olympic champion, since 1980, to have medalled in a World Championships after she had won the Olympic AA title.|$|E
