40|$|This work {{investigates the}} effect of a {{three-way}} catalytic converter and sampling dilution ratio on nano-scale exhaust particulate matter emissions from a gasoline direct-injection engine during cold-start and warm-up transients. Experimental results are presented from a four cylinder in-line, four stroke, wall-guided direct-injection, turbo-charged and inter-cooled 1. 6 litre gasoline engine. A fast-response particulate spectrometer for exhaust nano-particle measurement up to 1000 nm was utilised. It was observed that the three-way catalytic converter had a significant effect on particle number density, reducing the total particle number by up to 65 % over the duration of the cold-start test. The greatest change in particle number density occurred for particles less than 23 nm diameter, with reductions of up to 95 % being observed, whilst the number density for particles above 50 nm diameter exhibited a significant increase. The exhaust temperature plays a significant role on the influence of the catalytic converter on the nano-scale particulate matter. It is evident that the dilution ratio of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>sample</b> has a distinct effect on the particulate matter number and size distribution, influencing the engine-out PM more significantly than the tailpipe-out PM during cold-start engine operation. The catalytic converter also has a considerable effect on the estimated total particle mass...|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of hydrogen through the low temperature-ethanol steam reforming (LT-ESR) reaction requires {{the development of}} an efficient catalyst. A bimetallic formulation, based on Pt and Ni and supported on CeO 2 was investigated, in terms of activity, selectivity, stability. Very interesting results were obtained, with a complete ethanol conversion and a perfect agreement between the experimental and equilibrium products distributions, yet at T ≥ 300 °C, contact time= 240 ms and stoichiometric water/ethanol molar ratio. Furthermore, the selectivity towards the desired compounds was very high, with low coke selectivity and appreciable stability, especially with higher water/ethanol ratio. A mechanistic study of the reaction was carried out through the detailed analysis of the experimental evolution of the products distribution as a function of contact time (3 - 600 ms) and temperature (340 - 480 °C). The most significant result was the formulation of a possible Pt/Ni/CeO 2 catalysed reaction pathway, that includes the following steps: ethanol adsorption followed by dehydrogenation to acetaldehyde; intermediate decomposition and reforming to CH 4, CO, H 2 and CO 2; CO-WGS and CO 2 methanation reaction.

After heating the derivatives are extracted with toluene-cyclohexane and 1 l samples injected on-column on a OV 1 capillary column. Using an FID the lower limit of detection is 15 – 18 pg for formaldehyde (about 8 – 10 ppbv for a 16 l <b>exhaust</b> <b>sample).</b> Taking the blank into account, the limit is about 40 ppbv.

40|$|Nitric oxide {{and smoke}} {{emissions}} in diesel engine {{can be controlled}} by optimising the air/fuel mixture and combustion temperature. Early in-cylinder diesel injection that produces premixed charge can simultaneously reduce NOx and smoke emissions. However, there could {{be an increase in}} hydrocarbons and CO emissions due to fuel impinged to the cylinder wall. The focus of the present work is on the effects of a variation of pilot injection timing with EGR to NOx and smoke level of a modern V 6 common rail direct injection. This study is carried out at two different engine load conditions of 30 Nm and 55 Nm, at constant engine speed of 2000 rpm. Emissions of NOx are measured from the <b>exhaust</b> <b>sample</b> line by an exhaust gas analyzer (Horiba MEXA- 7100 EGR). Smoke level is measured by using an AVL 415 S smoke meter which provides results directly as a Filter Smoke Number (FSN) unit. The results show that the early pilot injection timing contributed to the lower smoke level and higher NOx emissions. The higher level of NOx is due to higher combustion temperatures resulting from the complete combustion. Meanwhile, the lower smoke level is due to complete fuel combustion and soot oxidation. The early pilot injection timing produces an intermediate main ignition delay which also contributed to complete combustion. The formation of smoke is higher at a high engine load compared with low engine load is due to the higher amount of fuel being injected, resulting in higher smoke formatio...|$|E
40|$|Diesel exhaust {{contains}} numerous {{toxic substances}} that show different modes of action such as triggering {{aryl hydrocarbon receptor}} (AhR) -mediated pathways. We investigated AhR-mediated activity of exhaust generated by a heavy-duty diesel engine operated with or without iron- or copper/iron-catalyzed diesel particulate filters (DPFs). AhR agonists were quantified using the DR-CALUX reporter gene assay (exposure of cells for 24 h). We found 54 - 60 ng 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin CALUX equivalents (TCDD-CEQs) per m 3 of exhaust in unfiltered samples and 6 - 16 ng TCDD-CEQ m 3 in DPF-treated samples. DPF applications decreased TCDD-CEQ concentrations by almost 90 %. Concentrations of known AhR agonists were determined with GC/HRMS and converted to TCDD-CEQ concentrations using compound-specific relative potency values. The analyzed nine polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and the 172, 3, 7, 8 -chlorinated dibenzodioxins/furans (23, 7, 8 -PCDD/Fs) contributed only marginally (0. 6 - 1. 6 %) to the total agonist concentration. However, both DPFs also decreased concentrations of individual PAHs by 7 (0 - 80 %. Variation of the assay exposure time (8, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h) revealed that AhR-mediated activity decreased over time and reached a plateau after 72 h, which was most likely due to biotransformation of AhR agonists by the exposed H 4 IIE cells. At the plateau, we measured 1 - 2 ng TCDD-CEQ m(- 3) in both an unfiltered and a filtered <b>exhaust</b> <b>sample.</b> Our findings show that DPFs are a promising technology to detoxify diesel exhaust regarding compounds with AhR-mediated activit...|$|E

40|$|Papers {{presented}} at the first Lunar Science Conference [1] and those published in the subsequent Science Moon Issue [2] reported the C content of Apollo II soils, breccias, and igneous rocks as rang-ing from approx. 50 to 250 parts per million (ppm). Later Fegley & Swindle [3] summarized the C content of bulk soils from all the Apollo missions as ranging from 2. 5 (Apollo 15) to 280 ppm (Apollo 16) with an overall average of 124 +/- 45 ppm. These values are unexpectedly low given that multiple processes should have contributed (and in some cases continue to contribute) to the lunar C inventory. These include exogenous accretion of cometary and asteroidal dust, solar wind implantation, and synthesis of C-bearing species during early lunar volcanism. We estimate the contribution of C from exogenous sources alone is approx. 500 ppm, which is approx. 4 x greater than the reported average. While the assessm ent of indigenous organic matter (OM) in returned lunar samples {{was one of the}} primary scientific goals of the Apollo program, extensive analysis of Apollo samples yielded no evidence of any significant indigenous organic species. Furthermore, with such low concentrations of OM reported, the importance of discriminating indigenous OM from terrestrial contamination (e. g., lunar module <b>exhaust,</b> <b>sample</b> processing and handling) became a formidable task. After more than 40 years, with the exception of CH 4 [5 - 7], the presence of indigenous lunar organics still remains a subject of considerable debate.

40|$|Methyl esters of soybean oil, {{known as}} biodiesel, are {{receiving}} increasing attention {{as an alternative}} fuel for diesel engines. Biodiesel is a nontoxic, biodegradable, and renewable fuel {{with the potential to}} reduce engine exhaust emissions. However, previous results have shown that biodiesel produces a higher fraction of soluble organic material (SOF) in the exhaust particulate matter than petroleum-based diesel fuel although its total particulate emissions were lowered. Also, because biodiesel has a high boiling point and low volatility compared with diesel fuel, its unburned hydrocarbon vapor could be lost by deposition in the hydrocarbon sampling line. This loss could be the source of reported reductions in hydrocarbon emissions from biodiesel-fueled engines. No information about whether the typical measurement temperature for unburned hydrocarbons is suitable for biodiesel hydrocarbon measurement is available. In this project, the formation of SOF in diesel exhaust particulates and the deposition of hydrocarbons in heated sampling lines were studied experimentally and theoretically;The experimental results showed that biodiesel produced a higher SOF fraction in its total particulates than diesel fuel under virtually all engine operating conditions. The SOF fraction decreased with increasing filter temperature at constant dilution ratio and with increasing dilution ratio at constant filter temperature. Biodiesel injection tests, where a small quantity of neat biodiesel was injected into the exhaust gas showed that most of the unburned biodiesel showed up in the soluble organic fraction of the collected particulates. The response of the heated flame ionization detector did not match the concentration change of unburned biodiesel in the exhaust gas. Based on the predicted results from condensation and multicomponent adsorption models, adsorption of vapor phase hydrocarbons on the carbon particle surface is the primary source of the SOF in the total particulate matter. The condensation process, by itself, cannot explain the formation of SOF during the dilution process. Adsorption of hydrocarbons is also shown to take place during transport of the hydrocarbon sample, even at high temperature. At the standard hydrocarbon measurement temperature, adsorption onto the sampling line walls could affect the concentration of unburned hydrocarbons and biodiesel in the exhaust gas sample. However, when the hydrocarbon sampling line temperature was heated to 250 °C, adsorption did not show significant effect on reducing the hydrocarbon concentration in the <b>exhaust</b> <b>sample...</b>|$|E
40|$|Diesel exhaust {{particulates}} are {{the subject}} of increasingly severe legislation controlling mass emissions throughout the world. Other emissions, which are currently unregulated, are also receiving closer scrutiny. In particular, polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAC), some of which are known carcinogens, are being studied. A total exhaust solvent scrubbing apparatus (TESSA) has been constructed to sample diesel exhaust hydrocarbons, using a solvent mixture to strip organic compounds from exhaust gases. This avoided adsorption of hydrocarbons onto particulates, when fitted close to the exhaust port, and minimised the formation of sampling artifacts. TESSA yielded new information, enabling lighter more volatile organics such as 2 - and 3 -ringed PAC to be characterised, these could not be collected by a dilution tunnel filter, which trapped particulates effectively but did not sample the hydrocarbons which had remained in the gas-phase. TESSA has proved itself to be uniquely suitable for the sampling of gaseous hydrocarbons with which there is currently an increased interest. Experiments using TESSA have confirmed that there is a contribution to the exhaust from small amounts of fuel passing through the combustion chamber substantially unchanged, as well as from partially burnt or pyrolysed products of combustion. New techniques have been developed to aid the interpretation of data obtained from high resolution gas chromatography and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, in order to assess the origin of specific groups of compounds within the highly complex samples obtained from diesel exhaust. Naphthalene and phenanthrene were shown to increase their concentration relative to their alkylated derivatives in an <b>exhaust</b> <b>sample</b> when compared to the relative concentrations found in the fuel. These parent compounds were being formed within the combustion chamber, as well as surviving in unburnt fuel. Nitro-PAC were detected only at considerably lower concentrations than had previously been found on dilution tunnel filter samples. Two new methods for assessing the contribution of lubricating oil to diesel exhaust emissions have been developed, and involved matching common peaks in a sample and a lubricating oil standard. The results demonstrated that lubricating oil makes a significant contribution to the total particulates. Increased control of lubricating oil leakage to the exhaust would help to reduce particulate emissions to below the new stringent limits. Perkins Engineering, Peterboroug...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigated}} the statistical relationship between particle and semivolatile organic chemical constituents in gasoline and diesel vehicle <b>exhaust</b> <b>samples,</b> and toxicity as measured by inflammation and tissue damage in rat lungs and mutagenicity in bacteria. <b>Exhaust</b> <b>samples</b> were collected from “normal ” and “high-emitting ” gasoline and diesel light-duty vehicles. We employed a combination of principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least-squares regression (PLS; also known as projection to latent structures) to evaluate the relationships between chemical composition of vehicle exhaust and toxicity. The PLS analysis revealed the chemical constituents covarying most strongly with toxicity and produced models predicting the relative toxicity of the samples with good accuracy. The specific nitro-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons important for mutagenicity were the same chemicals that have been implicated by decades of bioassay-directed fractionation. These chemicals were not related to lung toxicity, which was associated with organic carbon and select organic compounds that are present in lubricating oil. The results demonstrate {{the utility of the}} PCA/PLS approach for evaluating composition–response relationships in complex mixture exposures and also provide a starting point for confirming causality and determining the mechanisms of the lung effects.

In this study, extensive air sampling campaigns had been conducted at GZ urban sites and in Dinghu Mountain (DM), a rural site, in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) during the spring of 2001 and 2005. Additionally, roadside and tunnel samples were collected in GZ in 2000 and 2005. Later, <b>exhaust</b> <b>samples</b> from liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) - and gasoline-fueled taxis were collected in 2006. All samples were analyzed for C- 2 -C- 10 non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs).

Propane (47 %) was the dominant hydrocarbon in the exhaust of the LPG-fueled taxis, while ethene (35 %) was the dominant one in that of gasoline-fueled taxis. The use of LPG-fueled buses and taxis since 2003 and the leakage from these LPG-fueled vehicles were the major factors for the much higher level of propane in GZ urban area in 2005 compared to 2001.

Both gaseous and particulate emissions were evaluated. Eight gaseous and twenty-two particulate polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were quantified in this study. In the gaseous phase, naphthalene (67 - 89 %) was the most abundant PAH {{in all of the}} <b>exhaust</b> <b>samples.</b> The contribution of acenaphthylene in the gaseous phase was significantly higher in emissions from the Chinese restaurants, whereas fluorene was higher in emissions from the Western cooking style restaurants (i. e., Western restaurants and Western fast-food restaurants).

Controlled cooking conditions were monitored in a staff canteen to compare the emissions from several different local cooking styles, including deep frying, steaming, and mixed cooking styles (combination of steaming and frying). Deep frying produced the highest amount of total gaseous PAHs, 6 times higher than the steaming. However, steaming produced the highest particulate emissions.

40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. September 2010. Major: Mechanical engineering. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); viii, 86 p., appendices A-C. Diesel ash emissions are the non-combustible portion of diesel particulate matter and are mainly derived from metallic lube oil additives such as Ca, Mg, and Zn {{as well as}} engine wear metals including Fe. Diesel particulate filters (DPF) are used to filter engine particle emissions and are routinely regenerated, oxidizing the material in the filter. After filter regeneration, metallic ash remains. Over time, this ash can build up in the filter, increasing the filter pressure drop and eventually plugging the filter. Ash emissions {{can also be used}} to calculate engine lube oil consumption. A high temperature oxidation method (HTOM) has been developed to measure ash emissions in real-time. The HTOM uses a tube oven to oxidize the combustible fraction of an engine <b>exhaust</b> <b>sample.</b> The remaining particles are then measured with real-time and near real-time particle sampling techniques. The HTOM system improvements are discussed along with validation testing and further recommendations regarding improvements in the apparatus and procedure. Atomized lube oil was used as a test aerosol. Special lube oil blends were formulated to determine measurement sensitivity to specific ash constituents. Ca and Mg were readily detectable by the HTOM. However, the HTOM was not very sensitive to Zn based additives. Chemical equilibrium models show that Ca and Mg formed stable oxides at oven temperatures while Zn went to a gaseous phase. Repeatability in lube oil spray ash measurements was better than 10 %. Engine exhaust repeats did not show as good repeatability. However engine exhaust is a much less stable and repeatable aerosol. Steady-state engine ash emissions were sampled from two different Diesel engines (1. 9 L VW and Cummins APU) at different speeds and loads. Lube oil doped fuel was also used in the engine tests to artificially increase oil consumption and ash emissions. The engine lube oil consumption was predicted from known lube oil ash concentrations and measured ash emissions. The non-doped fuel tests yielded lower than expected lube oil consumption estimates while the doped tests showed an ash recovery of 31 %. Transient ash measurements were demonstrated. Ash and soot measurements were made downstream a loading DPF. The downstream soot particle surface area concentrations tracked better with the ash than soot volume concentrations. Transient engine speed and loads were also measured by the HTOM. Ash diameter concentrations were measured in real-time showing definite spikes of ash emissions at transient load steps...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} two contrasting implementations of the optical-feedback cavity-enhanced {{absorption spectroscopy}} (OF-CEAS) technique. OF-CEAS com- bines passive optical-feedback locking of semiconductor lasers with cavity-enhanced absorption spectroscopy, and {{is well suited}} to sensitive detection of pressure- broadened trace gases. Chapters 1 and 2 set the work in this thesis in context, by describing the theory and discussing the motivations behind trace gas sensing by tuneable laser spectroscopy in the near- and mid-IR. Chapter 3 reviews the theory of OF-CEAS, prior to presenting {{the results of an}} experimental implementation based on a near-IR DFB diode laser setup following the traditional V-cavity methodology to spatially decouple the optical- feedback beam from the direct back reflection. The capabilities of the system are demonstrated by accurate determination of a self-broadened half-width at half- maximum of a CO 2 transition, and by detection of acetylene in a car <b>exhaust</b> <b>sample.</b> Chapter 4 describes the design and implementation of the linear cavity method- ology for QCL OF-CEAS, which is the significant contribution of this work. Successful OF-CEAS locking with the linear cavity is shown for two different DFB-QCLs, with close operating wavelengths (5. 5 and 5. 2 µm) but quite different operating powers and facet size. Chapter 5 presents quantitative spectroscopic results from the linear cavity OF-CEAS instrument, using both lasers. Spec- troscopy on mixes of N 2 O and NO returned sensitivities, quantified by the α min, of 2. 7 × 10 − 8 cm − 1 in 1 s at 0. 28 atm and 2. 4 × 10 − 8 cm − 1 in 1 s at 0. 19 atm respectively. Limited by etalon fringing on the baseline, the α min compared well with those obtained with V-cavity QCL OF-CEAS instruments. The temporal stability was investigated by Allan variance calculations and the best minimum detectable concentrations for the linear QCL OF-CEAS instrument were 32 ppm for N 2 O (35 s) and 5 ppb for NO (2 s). For NO, this detection limit compares favourably with other mid-IR QCL-based NO sensors, and is sufficient for mon- itoring NO in polluted urban environments. With the Maxion DFB-QCL, mon- itoring of NO in air outside the laboratory was attempted, and an air sample drying system benchmarked. Although this experiment proved unsuccessful, it was possible detect trace amounts of NO desorbing from the walls of the gas cell. Over the course of one hour the concentration rose from 3. 8 ± 0. 7 ppb to 28. 4 ± 0. 2 ppb, leading to a rate of desorption of 6. 76 ± 0. 01 × 10 − 3 ppb s − 1. The sensitivity (α min) of these spectra was 7. 0 × 10 − 9 cm − 1 in 1 s, improved due to the higher mirror reflectivity at the lasing wavelength of the Maxion DFB-QCL, although still limited by etalon fringing.

40|$|The Pearl River Delta (PRD) {{is one of}} {{the most}} industrialized and {{urbanized}} regions in China. With rapid growth of the economy, it is suffering from deteriorating air quality. Non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) were investigated at urban and suburban sites in Guangzhou (GZ), a rural site in PRD and a clean remote site in South China, in April 2005. Additional roadside samples in GZ and Qingxi (QX, a small industrial town in PRD), ambient air samples at the rooftop of a printing factory in QX and <b>exhaust</b> <b>samples</b> from liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) -fueled taxis in GZ were collected to help identify the source signatures of NMHCs. A large fraction of propane (47 %) was found in <b>exhaust</b> <b>samples</b> from LPG-fueled taxis in GZ and extremely high levels of toluene (2. 0 - 3. 1 ppmv) were found at the rooftop of the printing factory in QX. Vehicular and industrial emissions were the main sources of NMHCs. The effect of vehicular emission on the ambient air varied among the three PRD sites. The impact of industrial emissions was widespread and they contributed greatly to the high levels of aromatic hydrocarbons, especially toluene, at the three PRD sites investigated. Leakage from vehicles fueled by LPG contributed mainly to the high levels of propane and n-butane at the urban GZ site. Ethane and ethyne from long-range transport and isoprene from local biogenic emission were the main contributors to the total hydrocarbons at the remote site. Diurnal variations of NMHCs showed that the contribution from vehicular emissions varied with traffic conditions and were more influenced by fresh emissions at the urban site and by aged air at the suburban and rural sites. Isoprene from biogenic emission contributed largely to the ozone formation potential (OFP) at the remote site. Ethene, toluene and m/p-xylene were the main contributors to the OFP at the three PRD sites. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|A diesel {{particulate}} matter analyzer capable of direct, real-time measurement of engine exhaust particulate {{is necessary to}} effectively institute source control technology currently being used on diesel equipment {{and to ensure that}} the control measures are working. To investigate the potential of a differential pressure monitor to measure diesel {{particulate matter}} in undiluted <b>exhaust,</b> <b>samples</b> were collected from three different diesel engines-Kubota, Isuzu, and Deutz-running under 12 different RPM and load scenarios. These measurements were compared to elemental carbon concentrations in the <b>sampled</b> <b>exhaust</b> as determined by using the NIOSH 5040 analytical method. Elemental carbon is used as a surrogate measurement for diesel particulate matter. The results of the two data sets were then compared using a linear regression analysis. The coefficient of determination (or R 2) was calculated to be 0. 98, 0. 94, and 0. 74 for the Kubota, Deutz, and Isuzu engines, respectively. R 2 values of this magnitude indicate that this method can be successful in estimating elemental carbon emissions in the engines tested. In addition, for replicate samples, the coefficient of variation ranged from 7. 1 % to 10. 2 % with an average of 8. 5 %. These data indicate that this method could prove useful to mechanics as they work to maintain engines and DPM control technologies...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of ambient temperature on exhaust emissions for an instrumented Euro 1 SI car was determined. A real world test cycle was used, {{based on an}} urban drive cycle that {{was similar to the}} ECE urban drive cycle. It was based on four laps of a street circuit and an emissions sample bag was taken for each lap. The bag for the first lap was for the cold start emissions. An in-vehicle direct <b>exhaust</b> dual bag <b>sampling</b> technique was used to simultaneously collect <b>exhaust</b> <b>samples</b> upstream and downstream of the three-way catalyst (TWC). The cold start tests were conducted over a year, with ambient temperatures ranging from – 2 °C to 32 °C. The exhaust system was instrumented with thermocouples so that the catalyst light off temperature could be determined. The results showed that CO emissions for the cold start were reduced by a factor of 8 downstream of catalyst when ambient temperature rose from - 2 °C to 32 °C, the corresponding hydrocarbon emissions were reduced by a factor of 4. There was no clear relationship between NOx emissions and ambient temperature. For subsequent laps of the test circuit the reduction of CO and HC emissions as a function of ambient temperature was lower. The time for catalyst light off increased by 50...|$|R
40|$|The <b>exhaust</b> <b>sampling</b> system using California Analytical Instruments analyzers was re-designed {{to provide}} {{increased}} functionality, reduced down time, and reduced maintenance costs. The project phases consist of concept formulation, initial design formulation, detailed design, and final assembly. The {{performance of the}} sampling system is verified by conducting a dynamometer test using a diesel engine as an exhaust source. Data was acquired to eliminate any unforeseeable issues that may have arisen from the design and fabrication process. Simple design changes were made after the first trial and those changes were validated through the second test trial. It was concluded that a functional sampling system can be designed and constructed in-house. It was also demonstrated that the thermoelectric sample gas chillers used {{in the design of}} the sampling system are capable in delivering a consistently dry sample provided the sample pressure and ambient temperature are kept stable...|$|R
40|$|A thermal/optical carbon {{analyzer}} {{equipped with}} seven-wavelength light source/detector (405 – 980 nm) for monitoring spectral reflectance (R) and transmittance (T) of filter samples allowed "thermal spectral analysis (TSA) " and wavelength (λ) -dependent organic-carbon (OC) –elemental-carbon (EC) measurements. Optical sensing was calibrated with transfer standards traceable to absolute R and T measurements, adjusted for loading effects to report spectral light absorption (as absorption optical depth (τ a, λ)), and verified using diesel <b>exhaust</b> <b>samples.</b> Tests on ambient and source samples show OC and EC concentrations equivalent to those from conventional carbon analysis when {{based on the}} same wavelength (~ 635 nm) for pyrolysis adjustment. TSA provides additional information that evaluates black-carbon (BC) and brown-carbon (BrC) contributions and their optical properties in the near infrared to the near ultraviolet parts of the solar spectrum.

40|$|Odor and {{chemical}} analyses {{were carried out}} on the <b>exhaust</b> <b>samples</b> from a J- 57 combustor can operated over a range of inlet conditions, and with several fuel types and nozzle modifications. The odor characteristics and total intensity of odor for each exhaust were determined over a range of dilutions {{to allow for a}} least squares determination of the intensity at 1, 000 to 1 dilutions. Analytical measures included the concentration of total hydrocarbons and the concentrations of aromatic organic species and oxygenated organic species from collected samples which were taken concurrently. A correlation was found between the concentration of the odorous oxygenated fraction and the total intensity of aroma. Inlet operating conditions and nozzle modifications which increase the efficiency of combustion as measured by exhaust gas analyses reduce the odor intensity and the quantity of oxygenates in the exhaust. The type of fuel burned altered the intensity of odor in relation to the quantity of oxygenates produced and, in some instances, changed the odor character...|$|R
40|$|Methods for {{measuring}} concentrations and emission rates of particulate matter (PM) from mechanically ventilated livestock buildings were evaluated {{in a laboratory}} facility and in a swine-finishing barn. Concentrations of PM were measured inside the room (room sam-pling) and at the exhaust duct (exhaust sam-pling). Concentrations at the exhaust duct were determined using high-volume traverse downstream of the exhaust fan, low-volume traverse downstream of the fan, and fixed sampling upstream and downstream of the fan. The traverse methods, which served as the reference, were conducted under isokinetic conditions; fixed sampling was done under both isokinetic and sub-isokinetic conditions. Compared to the traverse method, both room <b>sampling</b> and <b>exhaust</b> <b>sampling</b> under sub-isokinetic conditions overestimated PM con-centrations. Fixed sampling under isokinetic conditions, on the other hand, {{did not differ significantly}} (P> 0. 05) from the high-volume traverse method. Thus, isokinetic fixed sam-pling can be an alternative to the more expen-sive and time-consuming high-volume PM traverse method to measure PM concentra-tions and emission rates at the exhaust...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{effects of}} {{relative}} humidity (RH), carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4), oxygen (O 2) presence and gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) on H 2 S adsorption dynamics of KOH/CaO impregnated activated carbon are investigated in this study. X-ray diffraction (XRD), {{scanning electron microscopy}} with energy dispersive X-ray detector (SEM-EDX), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) techniques are applied and nitrogen adsorption characteristics are determined for characterization. The presence of water, O 2 and lower GHSV has beneficial effects on the activated carbon performance. CO 2 decreases the adsorption capacity due to its acidic characteristics. Best adsorption capacity is obtained as 13 wt % in KOH/CaO impregnated activated carbon, in a CH 4 (60 %) /CO 2 (38 %) /O 2 (2 %) gas atmosphere, at ambient temperature, RH 90 and 5000 h- 1 GHSV.

40|$|The {{exposure}} to diesel exhaust was studied in underground mining of oil shale in Estonia. The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate different approaches to exposure assessment. Fifty men who drove diesel-powered excavators underground were compared with 50 surface workers who had no known occupational {{exposure to}} diesel <b>exhaust.</b> <b>Samples</b> of respirable air were analyzed for 1 -nitropyrene and pyrene. Urine samples were collected at the start and after the first and the last shift of the same week, and were analyzed for 1 -hydroxypyrene. Although ambient monitoring of 1 -nitropyrene indicated a relatively high exposure of underground workers to diesel exhaust compared to surface workers (approximately 10 -fold higher), only a small increase in the excretion of 1 -hydroxypyerene was observed. Nonoccupational exposures such as smoking, recent consumption of grilled food, and recent proximity to an open fire had a greater impact on urinary excretion of 1 -hydroxypyrene than occupational exposure to diesel exhaus...|$|R
40|$|A {{constant}} volume sampler (CVS) compatible auto <b>exhaust</b> particulate <b>sampling</b> {{system has}} been built which <b>samples</b> <b>exhaust</b> isokinetically at constant temperature. This system yields internally consistent results and is capable of frequent and convenient operation. This paper describes an auto <b>exhaust</b> particulate <b>sampling</b> system developed at Esso Research and Engineering Company. This system is capable of frequent and convenient operation, is compatible with constant volume sampling (CVS) of auto exhaust, and collects particulate matter at constant temperature during the 1972 or 1975 Federal Test Procedure. Compatibility is obtained because the particulate sampler requires {{only a small portion}} of the diluted exhaust, the major portion of the sample is available to the CVS system for the measurement of gaseous emissions. Conditions used in the measurement of exhaust particulate conform to those mandated by the Federal Test Procedures for gaseous emissions. Comprehensive investigations of auto exhaust particulate production have been hampered by the absence of collection and sampling systems that would allow meaningful and reproducible particulate emissions data to be obtained. While several laboratory methods are now being used to collect automotive particulate, they cannot be operated conveniently or frequently, and do not allow simultaneous assessment of gaseous emissions, that is, they are not compatible with the CVS system. The sampling systems used by earlier workers (1, 2) are similar and ar...|$|R
