It's all about somebody they call the Sultan Aladdin, not our friend of the lamp, of course, but rather like him in having to do with genii or giants or something of that sort. They say he commanded the giants to build him a sort of pagoda, rising higher and higher above all the stars. The Utmost for the Highest, as the people said when they built the Tower of Babel. But the builders of the Tower of Babel were quite modest and domestic people, like mice, compared with old Aladdin. They only wanted a tower that would reach heaven-- a mere trifle. He wanted a tower that would pass heaven and rise above it, and go on rising for ever and ever.

There she dwelt in sorrow, neither eating nor drinking, till she tasted of a mixture of barley and water (cyceon), and was moved to smile by the mirth of Iambe. Yet she still held apart in wrath from the society of the gods, and still the <b>earth</b> <b>bore</b> not her fruits, till the gods bade Hermes restore Persephone.

He narrowly escaped capital punishment, when in a last-minute confession he convinced the court that he had acted under duress, as Kern threatened to kill him when he tried to withdraw from the murder plot. Thus he got away with 15 years in prison for accessory to murder. He also may have benefitted by a letter which had been written by Mathilde Rathenau, the victim's mother, to Techow's mother: In grief unspeakable, I give you my hand.

60|$|The gallant {{incident}} of the cloak {{is the traditional}} account of this celebrated statesman's rise at court. None of Elizabeth's courtiers knew better than he how to make his court to her personal vanity, or could more justly estimate the quantity of flattery which she could condescend to swallow. Being confined in the Tower for some offence, and understanding the Queen was about to pass to Greenwich in her barge, he insisted on approaching the window, that he might see, at whatever distance, the Queen of his Affections, the most beautiful object which the <b>earth</b> <b>bore</b> on its surface. The Lieutenant of the Tower (his own particular friend) threw himself between his prisoner and the window; while Sir Waiter, apparently influenced by a fit of unrestrainable passion, swore {{he would not be}} debarred from seeing his light, his life, his goddess! A scuffle ensued, got up for effect's sake, in which the Lieutenant and his captive grappled and struggled with fury, tore each other's hair, and at length drew daggers, and were only separated by force. The Queen being informed of this scene exhibited by her frantic adorer, it wrought, as was to be expected, much in favour of the captive Paladin. There is little doubt that his quarrel with the Lieutenant was entirely contrived for the purpose which it produced.|$|R
5000|$|According to Hesiod's Theogony (c. 8th - 7th century BC), Typhon {{was the son}} of Gaia (Earth) and Tartarus: [...] "when Zeus {{had driven}} the Titans from heaven, huge <b>Earth</b> <b>bore</b> her {{youngest}} child Typhoeus of the love of Tartarus, by the aid of golden Aphrodite". The mythographer Apollodorus (1st or 2nd century AD) adds that Gaia bore Typhon in anger at the gods for their destruction of her offspring the Giants. Numerous other sources mention Typhon as being the offspring of Gaia, or simply [...] "earth-born", with no mention of Tartarus. However, according to the Homeric Hymn to Apollo (6th century BC), Typhon was the child of Hera alone. Hera, angry at Zeus for having given birth to Athena by himself, prayed to Gaia, Uranus, and the Titans, to give her a son stronger than Zeus, then slapped the ground and became pregnant. Hera gave the infant Typhon to the serpent Python to raise, and Typhon grew up to become a great bane to mortals.Several sources locate Typhon's birth and dwelling place in Cilicia, and in particular the region {{in the vicinity of the}} ancient Cilician coastal city of Corycus (modern Kızkalesi, Turkey). The poet Pindar (c. 470 BC) calls Typhon [...] "Cilician," [...] and says that Typhon was born in Cilicia and nurtured in [...] "the famous Cilician cave", an apparent allusion to the Corycian cave in Turkey.

6000|$|This is the generally-current belief. On this {{assumption}} the received geological classifications {{appear to be}} framed. The Silurian system, the Devonian system, the Carboniferous system, etc., are set down in our books as groups of formations which everywhere succeed {{each other in a}} given order; and are severally everywhere of the same age. Though it may not be asserted that these successive systems are universal; yet it seems to be tacitly assumed that they are. In North and South America, in Asia, in Australia, sets of strata are assimilated to one or other of these groups; and their possession of certain mineral characters and a certain order of superposition are among the reasons assigned for so assimilating them. Though, probably, no competent geologist would contend that the European classification of strata is applicable to the globe as a whole; yet most, if not all geologists, write as though it were. Among readers of works on Geology, nine out of ten carry away the impression that the divisions, Primary, Secondary and Tertiary, are of absolute and uniform application; that these great divisions are separable into subdivisions, each of which is definitely distinguishable from the rest, and is everywhere recognizable by its characters as such or such; and that {{in all parts of the}} Earth, these minor systems severally began and ended at the same time. When they meet with the term [...] "Carboniferous era," [...] they take for granted that it was an era universally carboniferous--that it was, what Hugh Miller indeed actually describes it, an era when the <b>Earth</b> <b>bore</b> a vegetation far more luxuriant than it has since done; and were they in any of our colonies to meet with a coal-bed, they would conclude that, as a matter of course, it was of the same age as the English coal-beds.|$|R
6000|$|We {{saw that}} among various rude races other {{theories}} {{of the origin of}} man were current. Men were thought to have come out of {{a hole in the ground}} or a bed of reeds, and sometimes the very scene of their first appearance was still known and pointed out to the curious. This myth was current among races who regarded themselves as the only people whose origin needed explanation. Other stories represented man as the fruit of a tree, or the child of a rock or stone, or as the descendant of one of the lower animals. Examples of these opinions in Greek legend are now to be given. In the first place, we have a fragment of Pindar, in which the poet enumerates several of the centres from which different Greek tribes believed men to have sprung. [...] "Hard it is to find out whether Alalkomeneus, first of men, arose on the marsh of Cephissus, or whether the Curetes of Ida first, a stock divine, arose, or if it was the Phrygian Corybantes that the sun earliest saw--men like trees walking;" [...] and Pindar mentions Egyptian and Libyan legends of the same description.(1) The Thebans and the Arcadians held themselves to be [...] "earth-born". [...] "The black <b>earth</b> <b>bore</b> Pelasgus on the high wooded hills," [...] says an ancient line of Asius. The Dryopians were an example of a race of men born from ash-trees. The myth of gens virum truncis et duro robore nata, [...] "born of tree-trunk and the heart of oak," [...] had passed into a proverb even in Homer's time.(2) Lucian mentions(3) the Athenian myth [...] "that men grew like cabbages out of the earth". As to Greek myths of the descent of families from animals, these will be examined in the discussion of the legend of Zeus.|$|R

This paper focuses on the MASE concept and extrapolates a future design based on microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), multifunctional microsystems (MMS), and three-dimensional multichip modules (3 -D-MCM). Miniaturization of the electronics increases the payload volumes and power capabilities significantly and this is the main rationale for pursuing extreme miniaturization. The original MASE vehicle accommodated 1 – 2 instruments while the MEMS enhanced miniature autonomous submersible explorer (MEMSEMASE) accommodates up to six instruments. It is shown that the occupied area of the electronics components is reduced eight times, and the volume 25 times. The vehicle is shaped as a tube with 5 cm in diameter and 20 cm in length and can support 8 W continuously over 5 h. The maximum range is 25 km while the typical onboard instrumentation is conductivity, temperature, depth (CTD), and a high resolution camera. An optical fiber is used for bidirectional communication with the vessel. The goal of this enriched concept is to present an extremely miniaturized submersible design. The vehicle volume is defined to fit inside host vehicles with the goal of future deployment on Europa, oceans on <b>Earth,</b> and <b>bore</b> holes.

Insects [...] Have made the lion mad ere now; a shaft [...] I' the heel o'erthrew the bravest of the brave; [...] A wife's Dishonour was the bane of Troy; [...] A wife's Dishonour unkinged Rome for ever; [...] An injured husband brought the Gauls to Clusium, [...] And thence to Rome, which perished for a time; [...] 440 [...] An obscene gesture cost Caligula[460] [...] His life, while <b>Earth</b> yet <b>bore</b> his cruelties; [...] A virgin's wrong made Spain a Moorish province; [...] And Steno's lie, couched in two worthless lines, [...] Hath decimated Venice, put in peril [...] A Senate which hath stood eight hundred years, [...] Discrowned a Prince, cut off his crownless head, [...] And forged new fetters for a groaning people! [...] Let the poor wretch, like to the courtesan[461] [...] Who fired Persepolis, be proud of this, [...] 450 [...] If it so please him--'twere a pride fit for him! [...] But let him not insult the last hours of [...] Him, who, whate'er he now is, was a Hero, [...] By the intrusion of his very prayers; [...] Nothing of good can come from such a source, [...] Nor would we aught with him, nor now, nor ever: [...] We leave him to himself, that lowest depth [...] Of human baseness. Pardon is for men, [...] And not for reptiles--we have none for Steno, [...] And no resentment: things like him must sting, [...] 460 [...] And higher beings suffer; 'tis the charter [...] Of Life. The man who dies by the adder's fang [...] May have the crawler crushed, but feels no anger: [...] 'Twas the worm's nature; and some men are worms [...] In soul, more than the living things of tombs.[462] ...|$|R
