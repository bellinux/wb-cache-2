50|$|A 1955 {{study by}} Mary John {{identified}} fifteen species of grey mullets. She reports that most species of grey millets {{migrate to the}} lake during the months when Kayal {{is connected to the}} sea. The Kayal is rich in prawns. An environment impact assessment by National Thermal Power Corporation in association with the Fisheries department lists about 70 species of fishes in the Kayal. There are about 40 commercially important fish species which includes flathead mullet, greenback mullet, longarm mullet, largescale mullet, gold-spot mullet, bluespot mullet, tade grey mullet, bluetail mullet, Commerson's glassy perchlet, bald glassy perchlet, greasy grouper, tiger perch, spotted catfish, milkfish, longfin snake-eel, largetooth flounder, Solea indica, roughscale tonguesole, speckled tonguesole, barracuda, pearlspot, orange chromide, sulphur goatfish, spotted scat, whipfin silver-biddy, slender silver-biddy, small Bengal silver-biddy, common ponyfish, splendid ponyfish, shortnose ponyfish, Indo-Pacific tarpon, tenpounder, fringescale sardinella, Indian anchovy, Commerson's anchovy, Malabar thryssa and walking catfish. Besides the commercially important species there are about 30 other species of fish including northern whiting, bigeye trevally, black-tailed trevally, congaturi halfbeak, long-billed halfbeak, Quoy's garfish, chacunda gizzard shad, milkspotted puffer, diodon, <b>Indian</b> <b>halibut,</b> chorinemus, dusky sleeper, tank goby, mangrove red snapper, dory snapper, sleepy goby, sharptail goby, spotfin snouted goby Indian short-finned eel, Macrognathus guentheri, long whiskers catfish, yellow catfish, striped dwarf catfish, scarlet-banded barb, greenstripe barb, climbing perch, Indian carplet and spotted snakehead.|$|E
40|$|The {{proximate}} compositions and {{amino acid}} make-up of silver jew fish (Johnius argentatus), <b>Indian</b> <b>halibut</b> (Psettodes erumei), grey mullet (Mugil cephalus) and pearl spot (Etroplus suratensis) are reported. Calorific values of these fishes have been calculated from their proximate compositions and their amino acid make-up {{compared with the}} available data for beef and egg. From the study, pearl spot is adjudged {{to be the most}} nutritive among the fishes studied, followed by <b>Indian</b> <b>halibut,</b> grey mullet and silver jew fish...|$|E
40|$|Heavy metal {{contaminants}} in fish {{are of particular}} interest because of their potential risk to human. This study was undertaken to determine the levels of arsenic in two fish type including tiger tooth croaker and Indian halibut  in Esfahan. A total of 42 fish samples including 28 tiger tooth croaker (Otolithes ruber) and 14 <b>Indian</b> <b>halibut</b> (Psettodes erumei) were collected from retails of Esfahan from May 2010 to January 2011. For detection of arsenic contamination, the edible muscles of  fish samples were analyzed by hydride generation atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The arsenic contamination in fish samples {{were found to be}} in the range of 11 to 98 µg/kg. Concentration of arsenic in tiger tooth croaker and <b>Indian</b> <b>halibut</b> was 11 - 56 and 32 - 98 µg/kg, respectively. Arsenic concentrations were below the limit was acceptable to the World Health Organization. According to the results, the concentration of arsenic did not exceed the maximum acceptable intake limit...|$|E
40|$|Demersal finfishes {{are one of}} {{the major}} {{components}} in the marine fish landings along the Indian coast. Demersal fish groups such as the sharks, groupers, snappers, threadfins, porn frets and <b>Indian</b> <b>halibut</b> are commercially valuable and contribute substantially to the economy of Indian marine fisheries. Some of these groups, especially of large-size, are targeted by the fishermen by using different craft and gear combinations. However, several other demersal finfishes are not targeted, but are landed as bycatch by shrimp trawlers...|$|E
40|$|Fishes {{belonging}} to the families Bothidae (flounders), Cynoglossidae (tongue soles), Psettodidae (<b>Indian</b> <b>halibut)</b> and Soleidae (soles) are popularly known as flatfishes. Eleven genera and 25 species of flatfishes contribute to minor or major fisheries along the Indian coast (Table 1). A compressed and asymmetrical body with both the eyes lying {{on one side of}} the head is characteristic of the flatfishes. Most of them are small to medium sized fishes barring Psettodes erumei, which attains 60 cm length. They are exclusive benthic fishes, found mainly on muddy or sandy bottom of shelf areas; most of them are restricted to shallow waters of less than 60 m depth. However, P. erumei and Cynoglossus bilineatus are known to occur up to 100 m and 400 m depth respectivel...|$|E
40|$|Four hilminth larvae from {{different}} fish hosts caught from Emirati coasts are described. Two are metacercariae related to genus Stephanostomum, type (I) and (II). Type (I) was found encycsted in body cavities of the <b>Indian</b> <b>halibut</b> Psettodes erumei and the areolate grouper Epinephelus areolatus, and type (II) {{in the golden}} stripped goatfish Mulloides flavolineatus. The third larva is related to Acanthocephala and identified as Serrasentis sagittifer. It was collected from the body cavity of the spotted lizard fish Saurida undosquamis. The fourth larva belongs to the didymozoid trematodes, and was found infecting the kidneys of different hosts, such as Saurida undosquamis, the Jack pomfret Parastromateus niger and the mackerel tuna Euthynnus affinis. The larvae related to Stephanostomum type (I) and (II) and the dydimozoid type are described {{for the first time}} in the Arabian Gulf...|$|E
40|$|Demersal finfishes {{are one of}} {{the major}} {{components}} in the marine fi sh landings along the Indian coast. Demersal fish groups such as the sharks. groupers. snappers. threadfins, porn frets and <b>Indian</b> <b>halibut</b> are commercially valuable and contribute substantially to the economy of Indian marine fi sheries. Some of these groups, especially of large-size, are targeted by the fishermen by using different craft and gear combinations. However, several other demersal finfishes are not targeted, but are landed as bycatch by shrimp trawlers. Compared with the pelagics, the demersal finfishes are less affected by the changes in the environment. such as changes in temperature, speed and direction of currents. Hence, the biological characteristics of the demersals are relatively stable. Consequent upon {{the increase in the number}} and efficiency of trawlers, the demersal landings have increased in the last 40 years. However, indiscriminate trawling in the last one decade has affected the bottom habitat and the demersal resources as well. ow there are evidences of decline in the stocks of few demersal groups and shift in the composition of the landings...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to investigate the}} cause of mortality in the captive stock of <b>Indian</b> <b>halibut,</b> Psettodes erumei (Bloch & Schneider, 1801) (Psettodidae). Halibuts were severely infected with two species of parasitic copepods, Protochondracanthus alatus (Heller, 1868) and P. trilobatus (Pillai, 1964) (Poecilostomatoida, Chondracanthidae) and also with protozoan Amyloodinium sp. (Blastodinida, Oodiniaceae) on gills. Since the parasitic copepods have high host specificity on P. erumei, {{a large number of}} copepods were collected. Gill lamellae appeared pale and excess mucous secretion was observed on the body surface. Histopathological changes were mainly in the gill tissues with severe lamellar hypertrophy and hyperplasia, lamellar fusions with the presence of trophonts of Amyloodinium sp. Wild caught tilapia, and juveniles of mullet and milkfish used as live feed were suspected to be the cause of transmission to the rearing system. Infected fishes showed loss of appetite, irregular swimming, restlessness, exhaustion and gaping at the surface. Samples tested were negative for betanodavirus and systemic bacterial infection. Management intervention and multiple treatment of rearing facility using formalin @ 200 ppm controlled the infection, and half of the stock could escape from mortality...|$|E
