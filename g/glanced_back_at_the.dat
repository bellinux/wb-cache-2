60|$|He <b>glanced</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> village, {{then turned}} right round and {{regarded}} it steadfastly.|$|E
60|$|It was a {{pleasant}} voice,--Mrs. Peyton's. He <b>glanced</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> gateway; it was empty. He looked quickly {{to the right and}} left; no one was there.|$|E
60|$|There were {{no other}} diversions {{to be found in}} the pew. She <b>glanced</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> congregation. She thought that it would be amiable to bow to Mrs. Champ Perry.|$|E

60|$|The long boy removed himself slowly, {{loath to}} leave. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> door he cast an affectionate <b>glance</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> table.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> pamphlet's authors, <b>glancing</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{difficult}} {{economic times}} of the previous decade, asked and answered {{the question of the}} town's future prosperity: ...|$|R
6000|$|Jack drew a long breath, and <b>glanced</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> saloon. [...] "Ye ain't goin' back {{to class}} now, are ye?" [...] he said hurriedly. [...] "Ef you ain't, I'll--I'll see ye home." ...|$|E
60|$|Miles {{continuously}} <b>glanced</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> church door. Jackson Elder did not appear. The door did {{not once}} open after the awkward {{entrance of the}} first guests. Miles's hand closed on Bea's arm.|$|E
60|$|Dartrey <b>glanced</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> hall stand. There was no hat or coat there {{except his}} own. He {{followed}} Nora {{into the little}} study, which was separated only by a curtain from the dining room.|$|E
60|$|One <b>glance</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fiery torrent, {{which even}} the {{children}} were trying to turn from the town, and he realized how important was even one man's labor in this battle with the flames.|$|R
60|$|In fact, if <b>the</b> {{reader will}} <b>glance</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> dialogue--I {{know he has}} no time to, but if he does--he will see that, being {{something}} of a snoopopath himself, he has invented the whole story.|$|R
60|$|The puff did {{not last}} long, dying away to nothing in a few minutes, and then the lugger lay {{immovable}} again. The men whistled, stamped the deck impatiently, and cast anxious <b>glances</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> cutter.|$|R
60|$|Taylor stopped {{listening}} and <b>glanced</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{location of the}} Tube. Mary was undersurface there. He hated to leave her, even though he couldn't see her again until the Tube was unsealed. But then he shrugged and followed the others.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-night," [...] said Willie; [...] "good-night, Jim." [...] Jim replied good-night heartily, {{and then}} Willie {{stepped into the}} dark passage. He <b>glanced</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fairy before {{shutting}} the door, {{but her eyes were}} closed, so he said good-night to her in his heart, and went home.|$|E
60|$|When {{the shimmering}} blaze of {{moonlight}} lay close {{in front of}} them, he let his paddle trail in the water {{for a moment or}} two, and, turning, <b>glanced</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> house on the bluff. Its lower windows blinked patches of warm orange light against the dusky pines.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tie {{her up in}} {{the snow}} to wait till to-morrow morning. My horse is tired and it may save us trouble," [...] he began, then added, after <b>glancing</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> crowd behind him and next at Lysbeth, [...] "no, I will come." ...|$|R
60|$|He laughed. It was {{absurd to}} admit it, but nothing had pleased {{him so much}} since the coming of his misfortune! She was {{thoughtful}} for some time, {{every now and then}} <b>glancing</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> newspaper. Over their coffee she broke into a little reminiscent laugh.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, {{one could}} tell strange {{stories of the}} old days," [...] they heard Ridley say, as he sank into his chair again. <b>Glancing</b> <b>back,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> doorway, they saw Mr. Pepper {{as though he had}} {{suddenly}} loosened his clothes, and had become a vivacious and malicious old ape.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{does well}} to keep there," [...] said Seti, [...] "I {{think that if}} she came out those priests would murder her if they could. Also there are others," [...] and he <b>glanced</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> chariot that bore Userti in state. [...] "Say, Ana, can you {{interpret}} all this matter?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hope," [...] said Leland gravely, [...] "is {{a little}} like the germ in the wheat. It lies dormant; but, while its husk lasts, it will not die. I think," [...] and he <b>glanced</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> vast sweep of {{sprouting}} green, [...] "I was like that dusty ploughing, waiting for the rain." ...|$|E
60|$|Annie {{knelt on}} him, {{the other girls}} knelt and hung on to him. Their faces were flushed, their hair wild, their eyes were all {{glittering}} strangely. He lay at last quite still, with face averted, as an animal lies when it is defeated and {{at the mercy of}} the captor. Sometimes his eye <b>glanced</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> wild faces of the girls. His breast rose heavily, his wrists were torn.|$|E
60|$|Soon {{we were in}} {{the green}} country, and I took one last <b>glance</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> smoke-filled sky. Faint and far came the low thud of an explosion. Then I turned my face against Ernest's breast and wept softly for the Cause that was lost. Ernest's arm about me was eloquent with love.|$|R
40|$|We <b>glance</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{short period}} of the great discoveries between 1970 and 1974 {{that led to the}} restablishment of Quantum Field Theory and the {{discovery}} of the Standard Model of Elementary Particles, in particular Quantum Chromodynamics, and ask ourselves where we stand now. [...] Talk delivered <b>at</b> <b>the</b> QCD Euroconference 98 on Quantum Chromodynamics, Montpellier, July 1998...|$|R
60|$|She evidently {{wanted him}} to come, and Leland, who seemed to feel it, <b>glanced</b> <b>back</b> irresolutely <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sloo.|$|R
60|$|Dripping {{from the}} waist with snow water, he reslung his traps, <b>glanced</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sombre bush behind him and then plunged into that ahead, while the dusk was closing in when he stood panting amidst the stumps of smaller trees. The mark of the axe was on them, and {{somebody}} had piled up a mound of rock and stones. Alton drew in a long breath and shook off his burden.|$|E
60|$|They {{shook hands}} and parted, he hurrying away with the glad tidings to Phillimore Gardens, she {{tripping}} back to her captivity with the lightest heart that she had felt for a weary time. Passers-by <b>glanced</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bright little face under the bright little bonnet, and Ezra Girdlestone, {{looking down at her}} from the drawing-room window, bethought him that if the diamond speculation should fail it would be no hardship to turn to his father's word.|$|E
60|$|As {{we walked}} rapidly down Howe Street I <b>glanced</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{building}} {{which we had}} left. There, dimly outlined at the top window, I could see {{the shadow of a}} head, a woman's head, gazing tensely, rigidly, out into the night, waiting with breathless suspense for the renewal of that interrupted message. At the doorway of the Howe Street flats a man, muffled in a cravat and greatcoat, was leaning against the railing. He started as the hall-light fell upon our faces.|$|E

6000|$|... "I'm so {{glad you}} think so. Thank {{you very much for}} your {{kindness}} to him, especially for this museum affair; it will keep him happy while he is lame, give me a chance to soften and smooth this poor, rough lad, and make him love us. What did inspire you with such a beautiful, helpful idea, Teddy?" [...] asked Mrs. Bhaer, <b>glancing</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> pleasant room, as she turned to leave it.|$|R
50|$|Cobb {{manages to}} escape with Jimmy but is soon confronted by an undead Big Ben who wants revenge on him; Ben was taken {{prisoner}} and tortured before dying, and he blames Cobb {{for failing to}} save him. Cobb confronts Ben, no longer afraid of his fears, and destroys him with explosives {{as he and his}} son escape the burning house. In the end, he triumphantly <b>glances</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> house while regaining control of his life and reunites with his wife and child.|$|R
6000|$|Miss Starbrow still {{remained}} standing near, watching her, {{and in spite}} of her own great anger, she could not help feeling very much astonished at such an outburst of fury from a girl who had always seemed to her so mild-spirited. She touched the crumpled piece of paper with her foot, then <b>glanced</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> girl seated again with bowed head and covered face. What had she meant by a telegram? Curiosity overcame the impulse to walk away, and stooping, she picked up the paper and smoothed it out and read, [...] "From Miss Starbrow, Twickenham. To Miss Affleck, Dawson Place." ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{a lonely}} and little frequented road {{which led to}} his friend's house. Early as it was, Smith did not meet a single soul upon his way. He walked briskly along until {{he came to the}} avenue gate, which opened into the long gravel drive leading up to Farlingford. In front of him he could see the cosy red light of the windows glimmering through the foliage. He stood with his hand upon the iron latch of the {{swinging}} gate, and he <b>glanced</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> road along which he had come. Something was coming swiftly down it.|$|E
60|$|On {{the alley}} {{in one corner}} of the {{property}} stood a garage and stable, in which Jimmy could see men working upon the owner's cars and about the box-stalls of his saddle horses. At the sight of the horses Jimmy heaved another sigh as he continued his way to the rear entrance. As he stood waiting for a reply to his summons he <b>glanced</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> stable to see that horses had just entered and that their riders were dismounting, evidently two of the women of the household, and then a houseman opened the door and Jimmy made his delivery and started to retrace his steps to his wagon.|$|E
60|$|Granet <b>glanced</b> eagerly <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{original}} message. It {{consisted of}} a few perfectly harmless sentences concerning various rates of exchange. He gave it to his uncle with a smile.|$|R
500|$|Many reviews complimented the episode's songs. Huffington Post {{reviewer}} Mike Moody {{noted that}} both the dry humor in the episode and its songs were humorous, writing, [...] "I usually find myself heading to the kitchen when the songs come on -- but I usually <b>glance</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> TV to see if Jemaine is making a funny face – and I rush back to the couch once the last note drops. But I can't wait to download tonight's Police-inspired [...] jam." [...] The Guardian named [...] "Sugalumps" [...] {{one of the top}} five best season two Flight of the Conchords songs.|$|R
60|$|With {{these words}} the Lieutenant-Governor hastily left the room, while Alice and her cousin more slowly followed, {{whispering}} together, and once pausing to <b>glance</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> mysterious picture. The Captain of Castle William fancied that the girl's air and mien were such as might {{have belonged to}} one of those spirits of fable-fairies, or creatures of a more antique mythology--who sometimes mingled their agency with mortal affairs, half in caprice, yet with a sensibility to human weal or woe. As he held the door for her to pass, Alice beckoned to the picture and smiled.|$|R
