5|$|Bernard Lovell {{built the}} Transit Telescope at Jodrell Bank {{in the late}} 1940s. This was a -diameter radio {{telescope}} that could only point directly upwards; {{the next logical step}} was to build a telescope that could look at all parts of the sky so that more sources could be observed, as well as for longer integration times. Although the Transit Telescope had been <b>designed</b> <b>and</b> constructed by the astronomers that used it, a fully steerable telescope would need to be professionally <b>designed</b> <b>and</b> constructed; the first challenge was to find an engineer willing to do the job. This turned out to be Charles Husband, whom Lovell first met on 8 September 1949.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Axiomatic <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>design</b> {{structure}} matrix (DSM) are two popular design methods at the moment, {{while most}} related researches only apply the basic ideas of axiomatic design or DSM to some cases. This paper first analyses the disadvantages of both axiomatic <b>design</b> <b>and</b> DSM. After deep investigations, the paper then puts forward {{that there are}} strong complementarities between axiomatic <b>design</b> <b>and</b> DSM. Based on the complementarities between axiomatic <b>design</b> <b>and</b> DSM, it is proposed that axiomatic design’s design matrix (DM) can be transformed into corresponding DSM for structural evaluation. In this way, axiomatic <b>design</b> <b>and</b> DSM can benefit from each other. The logic of integration between axiomatic <b>design</b> <b>and</b> DSM is interpreted in this paper. A computer aided conceptual design system has been developed to enable the integration of axiomatic <b>design</b> <b>and</b> DSM...|$|R

40|$|Outsourcing <b>design</b> <b>and</b> {{engineering}} {{tasks in}} product development is increasingly popular. However, firms that outsource <b>design</b> <b>and</b> engineering tasks often experience problems.

This paper identifies the limits of <b>design</b> <b>and</b> engineering outsourcing in product development, and the sources of these limits. To do so, it investigates the organizational challenges that a major European automotive manufacturer faced when it decided to adopt an extreme form of <b>design</b> <b>and</b> engineering outsourcing. Based on an in-depth case study, we identify the sources of problems with outsourcing <b>design</b> <b>and</b> engineering tasks in product development, and {{shed light on the}} limits of <b>design</b> <b>and</b> engineering outsourcing in product development...|$|R
5|$|In 1666 John Mylne <b>designed</b> <b>and</b> {{was engaged}} to build Panmure House, near Forfar, for the 2nd Earl of Panmure. After his death, the work was {{continued}} by Alexander Nisbet, possibly {{with the assistance of}} William Bruce. This house, demolished in 1950, resembled Heriot's Hospital and other Scottish 17th-century buildings, rather than looking forward to the new classical styles which would be introduced by Bruce. During the Second Anglo-Dutch War of 1665–1667, Mylne <b>designed</b> <b>and</b> built fortifications at Lerwick, which were later reconstructed as Fort Charlotte. He provided a design for Linlithgow's tolbooth in 1667, but following his death another mason was sought, and a different design built. Another scheme was for Leslie House, carried out after his death by Robert Mylne, again with the advice of Bruce.|$|E

40|$|Book synopsis: <b>Design</b> <b>and</b> Anthropology {{challenges}} conventional thinking {{regarding the}} nature of <b>design</b> <b>and</b> creativity, {{in a way that}} acknowledges the improvisatory skills and perceptual acuity of people. Combining theoretical investigations and documentation of practice based experiments, it addresses methodological questions concerning the re-conceptualisation of the relation between <b>design</b> <b>and</b> use from both theoretical and practice-based positions. Concerned with what it means to draw 'users' into processes of <b>designing</b> <b>and</b> producing this book emphasises the creativity of <b>design</b> <b>and</b> the emergence of objects in social situations and collaborative endeavours. Organised around the themes of perception and the user-producer, skilled practices of <b>designing</b> <b>and</b> using, and the relation between people and things, the book contains the latest work of researchers from academia and industry, to enhance our understanding of ethnographic practice and develop a research agenda for the emergent field of design anthropology. Drawing together work from anthropologists, philosophers, designers, engineers, scholars of innovation <b>and</b> theatre practitioners, <b>Design</b> <b>and</b> Anthropology will appeal to anthropologists and to those working in the fields of <b>design</b> <b>and</b> innovation, and the philosophy of technology and engineering...|$|R
