5|$|In 2013, Todd {{returns to}} Llanview {{to check on}} Dani, who had {{previously}} phoned him several times. He witnesses Dani collapse from a drug overdose due to her abuse of oxycodone. While she is recovering at the hospital, an alive Victor arrives. A surprised Téa, Dani, and Jack welcome Victor back, while Todd tries to bond with his children. Todd remains concerned about Jack and Dani, attempting to buy their affections with money and deciding {{the best way to}} win them over <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> a truce with Victor. He also tries to win back Blair's affections. He eventually admits he only pretended to get along with Victor to lure him into a false sense of security. Victor admits that he poisoned Todd's scotch with arsenic and then tried to strangle him. Jack takes Todd to the hospital, where he recovers but is frustrated when his family continues to defend Victor. Victor realizes he must leave town and says goodbye to his family. Todd shows Blair a threatening note he received with the names of all his loved ones on it. The mysterious Tattoo Organization that held Victor demands that Todd find and kill Victor. Todd, Blair and Téa devise a scheme to fool this organization into believing Victor is dead. Feeling secure that their scheme has worked, they plan for a future. Todd receives another note by the Tattoo Organization, this time telling him that he failed them and that Victor has been recaptured. Todd is told that he must leave Llanview and go to the address given on the note. Todd and Blair are devastated. Todd says goodbye to Viki and his children, but does not tell them the real reason he is leaving is to protect their family. Before Todd leaves, he and Blair make love one last time, and it is revealed that they have remarried.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{practice}} <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> {{the same}} person Giannis Eleftheriou: the proper name is vernacular (and not Ioannis), but the surname is an archaic genitive. However, children are almost always baptised with the archaic form of the name so in official matters the child will {{be referred to as}} Ioannis Eleftheriou and not Giannis Eleftheriou.|$|E
25|$|As most {{definitions}} of color distance are distances within a color space, the standard means of determining distances is the Euclidean distance. If one presently has an RGB (Red, Green, Blue) tuple and wishes {{to find the}} color difference, computationally {{one of the easiest}} <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> R, G, B linear dimensions defining the color space.|$|E

25|$|Terminology that {{is viewed}} by some as being more neutral and {{inclusive}} of non-Christian people <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> this the Current or Common Era (abbreviated as CE), with the preceding years referred to as Before the Common or Current Era (BCE). Astronomical year numbering and ISO 8601 avoid words or abbreviations related to Christianity, but use the same numbers for AD years.|$|E
25|$|Another custom <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> all the {{children}} (in Orthodox congregations boys only) to a special aliyah called Kol HaNe'arim (all {{the children}}). In many congregations, a large talit is spread out {{over the heads of}} {{all the children}} as the blessing over the Torah is pronounced, and for the congregation to bless the children by reciting (in Hebrew) a verse from Jacob's blessing to Ephraim and Manasseh, Genesis 48:16.|$|E

500|$|Skyler Miller, a {{reviewer}} at Allgame who {{compared the}} console {{adaptation to the}} original game, admitted that the graphics are [...] "recognizable," [...] but claims that the version is [...] "missing much of the original's detail and character." [...] Miller's final judgment <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> it [...] "a passable effort" [...] and to compare unfavourably to the arcade version. Edward J. Semrad, a contemporary technical writer and computer specialist with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel included the game in his list of games that were [...] "watered-down versions of {{what we see in}} the arcades" [...] and praised the PC version for its superiority.|$|E
500|$|Davis {{appreciated}} Hammond's {{closeness to}} the SG-1 team and {{his willingness to}} compromise. At {{the beginning of the}} series, Hammond does not accept the alien warrior Teal'c but comes to trust and respect him after realizing Teal'c's devotion to the Stargate Program. Despite his admiration for Dr. Daniel Jackson's enthusiasm in the beginning, Hammond has a hard time understanding Daniel's unorthodox and non-military approach to problems until Hammond comes to realize the importance of a civilian viewpoint to SG-1's mission. When the alien Jonas Quinn joins SG-1 in season 6, Davis compared Hammond's response to Jonas to his reaction to Teal'c in season 1. Although Hammond does not blame Jonas for Daniel's death in [...] "Meridian", [...] "the situation does make it difficult for [...] to totally take the young man under his wing and embrace him like family as he has the rest of SG-1". Davis named the NID as Hammond's only source of frustration, since they regularly outflank Hammond and SG-1. Hammond's only option <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> the President for support, but most cases end with SG-1 or Hammond breaking the rules to assure the survival of humanity, so [...] "Hammond will do whatever he must to get things done".|$|E
2500|$|In the {{tradition}} of several New Worlds Alliance (NWA) organizations, the regular tPON meetings have been named Summons. [...] While this was initially considered the acceptable singular and plural form of the word, the current practice on the group's mailing list <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> these meetings Summonses in the plural form.|$|E

2500|$|The poet {{states that}} the genre of his poetry is Revolutionism (Krāntivāda). In the second canto, the poet defines the true {{revolution}} as one caused by change in thoughts. Aṣṭāvakra, while speaking to Kahola, says that Oṃ Śāntiḥ (Hail Peace!) is the old proclamation, the new one should be Oṃ Krāntiḥ (Hail Revolution!).

2500|$|... "Omar from Brooklyn" [...] {{is another}} regular {{called on the}} Boomer and Carton Show. An avid Bills fan, Omar's {{trademark}} <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> in on a Monday to rant (often incoherently due to his thick accent) about the Bills shortcomings and his hatred for other New York teams. During these calls there is usually Middle Eastern music playing in the background, courtesy of WFAN. Boomer and Carton had Omar in studio as a guest, and Omar received a pie in the face from Boomer. Omar also received tickets from Boomer to a Jets-Bills game in 2011.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{statement}} released after clashes in Benghazi, a Libyan official {{warned that the}} Government [...] "will not allow {{a group of people}} to move around at night and play with the security of Libya". The statement added: [...] "The clashes last night were between small groups of people – up to 150. Some outsiders infiltrated that group. They were trying to corrupt the local legal process which has long been in place. We will not permit that at all, and we call on Libyans to voice their issues through existing channels, even if it <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> for the downfall of the government." ...|$|E

2500|$|Throughout the 1930s and 1940s the Yi people (also {{known as}} Nuosu) of China terrorized Sichuan to rob and enslave non-Nuosu {{including}} Han people. The {{descendants of the}} Han Chinese slaves are the White Yi (白彝) and they outnumber the Black Yi (黑彝) aristocracy by ten to one. As much as {{tens of thousands of}} Han slaves were incorporated into Nuosu society every year. The Han slaves and their offspring were used for manual labor. There is a saying goes like: [...] "the worst insult to a Nuosu <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> him a [...] "Han" [...] (with the implication being that [...] "your ancestors were slaves")".|$|E
2500|$|The writ was {{designed}} to fill this gap somewhat to correct errors of fact affecting the validity and regularity of the judgment. [...] It was commonly used in civil cases, but seldom in criminal cases. [...] Vermont decisions have long recognized the general availability of coram nobis. In 1830, the Vermont Supreme Court explained that a writ of coram nobis will lie for error in fact, {{but it does not}} lie for error in law. [...] The function of the writ <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> {{to the attention of the}} trial court facts and circumstances outside the record which would have precluded the entry of judgment had such facts been known and established at the time of the conviction.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{strategies}} {{exist to}} identify which array probes show an unusual level of over expression or under expression. The simplest one <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> [...] "significant" [...] any probe that differs {{by an average of}} at least twofold [...] between treatment groups. More sophisticated approaches are often related to t-tests or other mechanisms that take both effect size and variability into account. [...] Curiously, the p-values associated with particular genes do not reproduce well between replicate experiments, and lists generated by straight fold change perform much better. This represents an extremely important observation, since the point of performing experiments has to do with predicting general behavior. The MAQC group recommends using a fold change assessment plus a non-stringent p-value cutoff, further pointing out that changes in the background correction and scaling process have only a minimal impact on the rank order of fold change differences, but a substantial impact on p-values.|$|E

2500|$|Kagen {{came under}} fire for a rumored comment at a November 13, 2006 White House function, after Appleton-area {{newspapers}} picked up on a story printed in an alternative paper, The Scene. According to the paper, Congressman-elect Kagen met presidential adviser Karl Rove in a bathroom and told him : [...] "You recognize me? My name's Dr. Multimillionaire and I kicked your ass." [...] The term [...] "Dr. Multimillionaire" [...] refers to the name [...] "Dr. Millionaire" [...] the Republican campaign {{used to refer to}} Kagen during the 2006 campaign. The Scene also said that the Congressman-elect thanked Vice President Cheney and President Bush for campaigning in Wisconsin for his opponent, telling them, [...] "'I couldn't have won without your help.'" [...] It is reported that he then addressed First Lady Laura Bush as Barbara, saying [...] "I learned on the campaign trail that the biggest insult you could do to another man <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> his wife by another name." ...|$|E
2500|$|Each {{official}} game requires having several referees {{present as}} well as an official snitch. The referees are the head ref whose job is to control the field and administer fouls and yellow or red cards to offending players, assistant refs who assist the head referee in watching for illegal plays, the snitch ref who follows the snitch once they enter the field and determine whether or not the catch was clean, and the goal refs whose job is to determine whether the quaffle went through the hoop. Assistant refs are oftentimes called bludger or beater refs, and their job <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> [...] "beat" [...] (or, in French, [...] "touché") when the beat was clean (meaning hit the opposing player), to help determine whether a goal was scored based on the beat and assist with making calls concerning illegal action or give verbal warnings to players. Assistant referees are also able to communicate to the head ref for a stoppage of play if witness to an action that would result in a yellow card. Snitch refs, whilst the snitch is off field, act as an additional bludger ref.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, Simpson {{starred in}} his own improv, hidden-camera prank TV show, Juiced. Typical of the genre, Simpson would play a prank on {{everyday}} people while secretly filming them {{and at the end}} of each prank, he would shout, [...] "You've been Juiced!" [...] Less typical, each episode opened with topless strippers dancing around Simpson, who is dressed as a pimp. He sings his own rap song, which includes the lyrics [...] "Don't you know there's no stopping the Juice / When I'm on the floor I'm like a lion on the loose / Better shoot me with a tranquilizer dart / Don't be stupid, I'm not a Simpson named Bart." [...] In one episode, Simpson is at a used car lot in Las Vegas where he attempts to sell his white Bronco (made famous during the chase in Los Angeles prior to his arrest). A bullet hole in the front of the SUV is circled with his autograph, and he pitches it to a prospective buyer by saying that if they [...] "ever get into some trouble and have to get away, it has escapability." [...] In another sketch called [...] "B-I-N-G-O.J.", Simpson pretends to be having an affair with another man's girlfriend. Later he transforms into an old white man whose dying wish <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> a game of bingo. [...] "Juiced" [...] aired as a one-time special on pay-per-view television and was later released on DVD.|$|E
