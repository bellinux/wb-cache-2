40|$|Let {{me first}} {{illustrate}} what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> most <b>important</b> aspect of <b>the</b> so-called Takenaka plan. By now, many policymakers and academics share a high {{praise for the}} Takenaka plan of October 30, 2002 as the decisive way of ending the decade-long banking crisis of Japan. 1 However, few remem-ber how its reputation has evolved from being too tough to being too com-promised, and finally to producing moral hazard by rescuing shareholders of a failing bank. Ironically, appearing too tough made the stock prices de-cline, and failure, nationalization, and bailing out shareholders of the Res-ona Bank produced a moral hazard rally in May 2003. Let me explain the evolution briefly. (See Hoshi and Ito [2004] for a re-view of the Financial Services Agency from 1998 to 2004.) In the spring to summer of 2002, a hot debate regarding the soundness of the Japanese banking system took place.
