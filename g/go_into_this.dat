2500|$|The film Stargate rushed {{very quickly}} over how a Stargate {{actually}} works and is operated, but the subsequent television shows <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> {{area in a}} great amount of detail. In the series SG-1, it is explained that a stargate's destination is not fixed, but is singled out by a process known as [...] "dialing". Once a destination is selected by the traveler, the Stargate generates a wormhole between itself and a complementary device at the destination, by being supplied with a threshold amount of raw energy. Objects in transit between gates are broken down into their individual elemental components, and then into energy as they pass through the event horizon, and then travel through a wormhole before being reconstructed on the other side.|$|E
2500|$|Swamy {{demanded that}} an {{independent}} committee should be formed {{to check the}} security and safety of the Electronic Voting Machines (EVM) to avoid any rigging or tampering. He argued that countries like US, Japan, UK, Germany and Netherlands have abandoned EVMs and are using paper-ballot system and demanded that a printed receipt {{should be given to}} every voter after casting the vote. His PIL to investigate the working of EVM was dismissed by the Delhi High Court on 17 January 2012. The court refused to give any direction to the Election Commission to bring back paper-ballot system or use of printed receipts. The Commission argued that the use of paper is not feasible due to the huge size of Indian electorate. The court further asked the Election Commission to [...] "immediately begin a process of wider consultations" [...] and the Parliament [...] "to <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> question in depth and decide".|$|E
2500|$|We didn't {{actually}} have the idea. It was the record company. The record company guys were like, [...] "Even {{if we have}} to go to jail, there's no question that we'll release that." [...] On the song [...] "Virgin Killer", time is the virgin killer. But then, when we had to do the interviews about it, we said [...] "Look, listen to the lyrics and then you'll know what we're talking about. We're using this only to get attention. That's what we do." [...] Even the girl, when we met her fifteen years later, had no problem with the cover. Growing up in Europe, sexuality, of course not with children, was very normal. The lyrics really say it all. Time is the virgin killer. A kid comes into the world very naive, they lose that naiveness and then <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> life losing all of this getting into trouble. That was the basic idea about all of it.|$|E

2500|$|Brando starred as Colonel Walter E. Kurtz in Francis Ford Coppola's Vietnam epic Apocalypse Now (1979). He plays {{a highly}} {{decorated}} U.S. Army Special Forces officer who goes renegade, running his own operation based in Cambodia and is feared by the U.S. military {{as much as}} the Vietnamese. Brando was paid $1million a week for 3 weeks work. The film drew attention for its lengthy and troubled production, as Eleanor Coppola's documentary Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse documents: Brando showed up on the set overweight, Martin Sheen suffered a heart attack, and severe weather destroyed several expensive sets. The film's release was also postponed several times while Coppola edited millions of feet of footage. In the documentary, Coppola talks about how astonished he was when an overweight Brando turned up for his scenes and, feeling desperate, decided to portray Kurtz, who appears emaciated in the original story, as a man who had indulged every aspect of himself. Coppola: [...] "He was already heavy when I hired him and he promised me {{that he was going to}} get in shape and I imagined that I would, if he were heavy, I could use that. But he was so fat, he was very, very shy about it... He was very, very adamant about how he didn't want to portray himself that way." [...] Brando admitted to Coppola that he had not read the book, Heart of Darkness, as the director had asked him to, and the pair spent days exploring the story and the character of Kurtz, much to the actor's financial benefit, according to producer Fred Roos: [...] "The clock was ticking on this deal he had and we had to finish him within three weeks or we'd <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> very expensive overage... And Francis and Marlon would be talking about the character and whole days would go by. And this is at Marlon's urging—and yet he's getting paid for it." ...|$|E
