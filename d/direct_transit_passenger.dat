40|$|Abstract. The {{target of}} the paper {{is to find the}} {{similarities}} and particularities of the travel and tourism market in each Baltic country by comparing the main statistical indicators. For this purpose, bibliography review/analysis, induction and de-duction, as well as statistical analysis methods such as grouping, processing and comparison methods are used. The research shows that Estonia features the highest travel and tourism industry’s share both in the total GDP of the country and employ-ment, exceeding the average figures of the EU countries. Estonia is a leader among the Baltic countries both {{in terms of the number}} of foreign visitors with an overnight stay and the total number of nights spent in tourist accommodation. Lithuania has developed the most even distribution of tourist accommodation within the country – in contradistinction to Estonia and Latvia that face too high concentration of tourists in capital cities. Riga airport is the leading airport in the Baltic region showing the highest results for <b>direct</b> and <b>transit</b> <b>passengers</b> volume, aircraft movements and the number of direct destina-tions offered. Estonia not only is very successful in using its seafront location and developing an effective ferry route network but also has positioned Tallinn as one of the Baltic Sea cruise destinations that is offered by the largest cruise companies...|$|R

5000|$|The {{international}} zone {{in an international}} airport is the area where arriving international passengers have not formally entered the country by clearing arrival customs and immigration controls, and departing passengers have formally exited the country by clearing exit immigration control. <b>Transit</b> <b>passengers</b> can take connecting international flights in the {{international zone}} without clearing customs and immigration controls, {{and in most cases}} do not require a visa. Some countries, however, require passengers of certain nationalities to hold a <b>direct</b> airside <b>transit</b> visa even when they would not need to pass through border controls. A major exception is the United States, where all passengers arriving on international flights are subject to customs and immigration inspections. Hence, transiting at a U.S. airport require at least a C-1 transit visa, or a travel authorization for Visa Waiver Program (VWP) travelers. A common feature of the international zone is duty-free shopping for departing and <b>transit</b> <b>passengers.</b> International zones in airports are fully {{under the jurisdiction of the}} country where they are located and local laws apply.

40|$|<b>Transit</b> <b>passenger</b> market {{segmentation}} enables transit operators to target different classes of transit users for targeted surveys and various operational and strategic planning improvements. However, the existing {{market segmentation}} {{studies in the}} literature have been generally done using passenger surveys, which have various limitations.

This paper proposes a comprehensive methodology for passenger segmentation solely using SC data. After reconstructing the travel itineraries from SC transactions, this paper adopts the density-based spatial clustering of application with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm to mine the travel pattern of each SC user. An a priori market segmentation approach then segments <b>transit</b> <b>passengers</b> into four identifiable types.

40|$|Horizontal equity {{requires}} equal {{distribution of}} investment/benefit/costs among equal members of society. In other words, a <b>transit</b> <b>passenger</b> should {{pay as much}} as he/she uses. This study evaluated the measure of fulfillment of this rule in a case study, developed a distance-based fare structure, and shows that justice is better served by switching to the proposed structure. Fare elasticity of demand and probability distribution of <b>transit</b> <b>passenger</b> trip lengths were investigated through a field survey. Although mainly used in the measurement of inequality in income or wealth, the Gini index and the recovery ratio (revenue to cost for each <b>transit</b> <b>passenger)</b> in evaluating equity were used in this study. Results show that the Gini index would decrease from 0. 38 to 0. 17 after switching from a flat to a distance-based structure. Assessment of the ratio of revenue per mile over cost per mile (RPM/CPM) shows that switching to a distance-based fare structure makes the RPM/CPM curve significantly flatter, which indicates more similarity among passengers. As a byproduct, the amount of change in demand and revenue of the transit system also were formulated...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} network-based model for {{investigating}} the optimal transit fare structure under monopoly and oligopoly market regimes with {{uncertainty in the}} network. The proposed model treats the interaction between transit operators and <b>transit</b> <b>passengers</b> in the market as a two-level hierarchical problem with the transit operator sub-model at the upper-level and the <b>transit</b> <b>passenger</b> sub-model at the lower-level. The upper-level problem {{is to determine the}} fare structure so as to optimize the objective function of the transit operators, whereas the lower-level problem represents the path choice equilibrium of the <b>transit</b> <b>passengers.</b> In order to consider the uncertainty effects on transit network, the proposed model incorporates the unreliability component of transit services into the passenger disutility function, which is mainly due to variations of the in-vehicle travel time and the dwelling time of transit vehicles at stops. With the use of the proposed model, a numerical example is given to assess the impacts of the market regimes and the unreliability of the transit services on the optimal transit fare structure. © Springer Science + Business Media, LLC 2009. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Modifying a high {{occupancy}} vehicle (HOV) lane into a high occupancy/toll (HOT) lane generally involves allowing single occupant vehicles (SOVs) {{to travel}} on the free-flow HOV lane for a toll. This may entice some former transit riders to pay the toll to obtain the benefits of traveling in their own vehicle on the HOV lane. Thus, {{the introduction of a}} HOT lane has the potential to impact transit ridership, dramatically lowering the average vehicle occupancy of the lane. In 2003, surveys were distributed to park-and-ride bus passengers on the Katy Freeway and Northwest Freeway corridors in Houston. Passengers? responses to questions regarding their trip characteristics, their socioeconomic characteristics, and stated preference scenarios were used to develop a mode choice model. To determine how <b>transit</b> <b>passengers</b> might react to a proposed HOT lane, HOT lane scenarios with varying tolls and travel time savings were simulated using this model. For all scenarios, {{only a small percentage of}} <b>transit</b> <b>passengers</b> were estimated to switch to driving alone on the HOV lane. Fewer people would switch during the peak period than during the off-peak period. <b>Transit</b> <b>passengers</b> shifting to SOV on the HOV lane would reduce the average vehicle occupancy (AVO) only about 1 percent to 2 percent. SOV drivers shifting from the general purpose lanes to the HOV lanes are likely to affect AVO much more. However, as long as free-flow conditions are maintained, this analysis shows that the HOV lane can be successfully adapted to a HOT lane and move more people, even if a few <b>transit</b> <b>passengers</b> choose to drive alone...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Currently, various {{information}} retrieval {{methods have been}} implemented and are used on the Internet. For example, the existing shortest-path system obtains {{the information from the}} shortest-path database (DB), which is constructed in advance using Dijkstra’s algorithm. However, employing a subway, if an accident disrupts the path between any two stations, the shortest-path DB does not remain intact, and must be reconstructed from scratch using Dijkstra’s algorithm. In this paper, we propose a more efficient shortest-path searching method that does not require reconstructing the entire path from scratch. And, {{in the case of the}} shortest path, the transit process may have a great influence on the shortest-path search. Existing methods, such as Dijkstra’s algorithm, might offer unavailable shortest-path information because they do not consider the condition of <b>transit</b> <b>passengers.</b> In this paper, we propose a variable weighted graph constructed from information about the <b>transit</b> <b>passenger’s</b> condition. We propose a method that obtains the available shortest-path information using a variable weighted graph. In addition, we describe our retrieval system for offering the available shortest-path information in the light of the <b>transit</b> <b>passenger’s</b> condition.
