500|$|On November 8, 2006, the {{day after}} she filed for divorce from Federline, Spears {{recorded}} [...] "Radar" [...] with Ezekiel Lewis and Patrick M. Smith of The Clutch at Sony Music Studios in New York City. Lewis had {{wanted to work with}} her {{for a long time and}} was motivated to produce something for her that was going to [...] "help her project become a great project to come back with". Smith stated that the team tried to create a record [...] "for the Britney Spears that we know and love" [...] and that it did not [...] "touch on anything that was really dealing with all the stuff that she was dealing with." [...] Both commented that although Spears arrived late to the recording sessions, she caught them off guard with her efficiency and professionalism, with Lewis adding, [...] "It was absolutely nuts, and she took directions very well. [...] I don't know what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>expecting</b> because we went in to cut that record {{the day after}} she filed divorce from Kevin [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|Andrew Orloff, the Creative Director and Visual Effects Supervisor of Zoic Studios, {{considered}} the creature {{one of the}} most challenging effects his company helped make for the season. He explained that this and other designed monsters are [...] "really super fantastical, they’re really out there, the anatomy and the biology of them is so wild and crazy, that it really takes a lot to make it look real in the scene and make it a part of the actors are reacting to these things – to get the audience to believe in it is kind of the biggest challenge we’ve faced on the show so far." [...] During filming, the cast and crew referred to the monster as a [...] "were-upine" [...] or [...] "porcuman". Lance Reddick commented on set, [...] "When I first got here tonight, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>expecting</b> zombies to come up out of the ground. And the actual creature looks so bizarre, I mean it really looks like something I wouldn't want to be caught in the woods with." [...] The crew spent over a week collecting and placing the plane wreckage together. According to Set Dresser Russ Griffin, the set included approximately 15,000 pounds worth of plane parts.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Give It Away" [...] {{was made by}} French fashion {{photographer}} and director Stéphane Sednaoui. Kiedis wanted the video to be visually distinct and readily identifiable but disliked much of the material Warner Bros. sent for him to choose from: [...] "I started viewing reels and reels and reels of video directors but nothing looked good to me. Everything was the same, boring, homogenized, contrived shit." [...] Upon finding Sednaoui's reel, however, Kiedis noticed it was [...] "like nothing else. It was slower and poetic, shot in black and white. It seemed like authentic art, not something shot for MTV." [...] He and Flea met with Sednaoui {{to talk about the}} video, for which the director proposed a [...] "very desolated [...] very graphic landscape," [...] while heavily focusing on the band members with little to no outside influence. It was decided that the video would be filmed in black and white while Sednaoui took the idea of painting the band members with silver acrylic from previous photo shoots he had done. Sednaoui recalls that he was [...] "amazed by what [...] gave me because they went far far far beyond what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>expecting</b> and I think that's one of my best experiences in that regard". The overall mood of the video was intended to be a personification of the song, which is upbeat and lively.|$|E
500|$|William Whitaker of the Abilene Reporter-News {{gave the}} film a {{negative}} review, stating, [...] "where <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>expecting</b> a dramatic retelling {{of the mysterious}} case concerning the phantom killer and his bizarre murders, I was greeted with an extremely uneven picture, collapsing into the most sickening, blood-weltering scenes one minute and then lapsing into some incredibly bad comedy relief the next." [...] He continued, [...] "Such vivid contrasts in the film's approach to its subject lead to its downfall. Any effect the disgustingly boring and extremely brutal murder scenes have go to waste seconds later when director Charles B. Pierce leads the picture {{into some of the}} type of poor comedy relief that one is used to seeing in budget pictures of the '60s. As a result, the film is unable to conjure up any mood or suspense." [...] He concludes with, [...] "All in all, the picture is an unpleasant little film and Pierce, after going overboard on the blood and gore scenes, never seems to be able to decide as to how serious the picture should be," [...] and that [...] "both mature and immature minds should avoid the film." [...] A reporter in El Paso, Texas, gave it a mixed review, writing that [...] "this mixture of humor with fact saved 'The Town...' as it wakes the audience when things begin to lag." [...] He goes on to write, [...] "All things considered, the movie is entertaining and would appeal to those who savor unsolved murder mysteries." ...|$|E

[...] Like Sepinwall and Gibson, Frederick praised the {{performance}} by Levi and Dalton, writing, [...] "Chuck's heartbreak and desperation were incredibly poignant throughout the bulk of the episode." [...] Like Gibson, Frederick also praised the scene depicting Chuck's surrender to Vivian, calling it [...] "sniffle-inducing". Frederick continued that Dalton [...] "plays Hartley Winterbottom with a great sincerity and vulnerability." [...] Frederick also called it [...] "a great reward to the fans that the episode didn't cheat us out of the Chuck/Sarah wedding at all." [...] Frederick wrote, [...] "While I'm not blown away by this finale, I still am satisfied with it, because it represents the values we've come to expect from Chuck: the ideas of hope, family, and sticking together {{in the face of the}} most adverse of circumstances." [...] Ryan McGee of The Onion A.V. Club rated the episode a B+ on an A+ to F scale, although criticizing its [...] "mechanics". Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode a rating of 9.5 out of 10, a series high alongside season two's [...] "Chuck Versus Santa Claus" [...] and [...] "Chuck Versus the Colonel", season three's [...] "Chuck Versus the Beard" [...] and [...] "Chuck Versus the Subway", and season five's [...] "Chuck Versus the Kept Man" [...] and [...] "Chuck Versus the Goodbye". Goldman wrote, [...] "Chuck had more ups and downs than usual this season, but it ended on a very strong note. With Sarah's life in danger, Chuck and all his friends and family proved they would risk everything to save her, and it made for a very compelling, involving hour." ...|$|E

[...] "Radar" [...] was originally planned to be released as the third single from Blackout, according to Lewis. [...] "Break the Ice" [...] was released instead and [...] "Radar" [...] was chosen as the fourth single. In July 2008, a CD single was released in countries such as New Zealand and Sweden. However, a wider release was scrapped when Spears began recording new material for her sixth studio album, Circus. On May 7, 2009, the song was announced as the fourth single from Circus.|$|E
2500|$|Raja Petra {{was held}} without trial under the ISA at the Kamunting Detention Centre in {{northern}} Perak state, which had 60 ISA detainees, mostly suspected Islamic extremists. The ISA permits an initial detention of two months for investigation, {{followed by a}} two-year jail sentence which can be renewed indefinitely. The 1948 ISA is a holdover from British colonial rule, intended for use against communist insurgents. Raja Petra's wife Marina Lee Abdullah said: [...] "(Police) said my husband has been sent to Kamunting this morning {{and that he will}} remain there for two years with no trial. This is the worst news I can receive but we will keep fighting for his release. This is dirty foul play by the government as they know {{that we are in the}} process of fighting for his release in the court but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>expecting</b> this. Raja Petra was detained for allegedly 'insulting Islam' and publishing articles on his website which has tarnished the country's leadership to the point of causing confusion among the people." [...] Raja Petra's lawyer sought his release in a court hearing but this was dismissed. Raja Petra's detention caused widespread protests by civil society groups, lawyers and other online commentators.|$|E
2500|$|Although he {{embarked}} on the Test leg of England's tour of Bangladesh in March 2010, Onions returned {{home with a}} back injury without playing a match. Alastair Cook, England captain on the tour, voiced his disappointment that Onions {{would not be able}} to play for England: [...] "He was a huge part of our plans and he still is, obviously, because of the way he bowled in South Africa, where he was unlucky not to take more wickets than he did. He bowled really well there, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>expecting</b> him come to these conditions and bowl well here as well." [...] The injury prevented Onions from playing most of the English cricket season. He also underwent surgery on his left knee to repair cartilage. Speaking of his disappointment at not being able to play for England, Onions said [...] "The last few months have been massively frustrating. When you've had a place in the team for a while and you lose it it's hugely disappointing and hurts a lot. Before the injury everything had been like a dream for me, all I ever wanted to do was play for England, but the last six months have been tough." [...] In April 2010 Wisden Cricketers' Almanack named him as one of its five cricketers of the year for 2009. Onions did not recover in time to play in the 2010–11 Ashes series. However he was named in England's 27-man performance squad the following March after recovering from surgery.|$|E
