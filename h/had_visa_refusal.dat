25|$|In October 2014, it was {{reported}} that the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with the European Union might not be ratified by Bulgaria and Romania unless the visa requirement was lifted for their citizens by Canada. Under Canadian legislation, for a country {{to be added to the}} visa waiver list there should be less than 3% immigration violations and <b>visa</b> <b>refusal</b> rate of less than 3% over 3 years. For Bulgarians the immigration violation rate was 4.4% in 2013 and the average 3 year <b>visa</b> <b>refusal</b> rate was 15.76%. For Romanians the immigration violation rate was 2.7% in 2013 and the average 3 year <b>visa</b> <b>refusal</b> rate was 15%.

An assistant legislative director at the American Jewish Committee stated that Israel had a [...] "relatively low <b>visa</b> <b>refusal</b> rate," [...] despite heavy screening and security procedures.

25|$|Representative Brad Sherman {{argued that}} there exist at least five other {{countries}} with a <b>visa</b> <b>refusal</b> rate of over 3% which were allowed into the program, and these rates were higher than Israel's 5.4% refusal rate. He added that he believes that accepting Israel to the visa waiver program wouldn't cause discrimination, but rather end it, and criticized opponents of the bill {{as members of a}} campaign to delegitimize the state of Israel.|$|R
50|$|President Obama {{promised that}} Poland would {{be added to}} the program, in a meeting with Polish President Bronislaw Komorowski in December 2010; however no date has been set for when Poland will be added. Organizations such as the Federation for American Immigration Reform and the Center for Immigration Studies still oppose Poland's {{admission}} both due to its continued high <b>visa</b> <b>refusal</b> rate, as well as its being a major source of illegal immigrants; the CIS also criticized South Korea's admission to the program on these grounds.|$|R

He argues that taking a harder line on visa applications from Russia could therefore offer a natural route to exert pressure over Ukraine, however such a policy would also carry a significant cost for EU countries...|$|R

50|$|If {{immigrant}} {{intent is}} presumed based upon inferences made by consular or Department of Homeland Security's border review, this is grounds for termination of non-immigrant <b>visas</b> issued, <b>refusal</b> of the <b>visa</b> application, <b>refusal</b> of admission {{at the port}} of entry, refusal of readmission, or removal (deportation). Further, if a border or consular official believes that a visa holder is intentionally misrepresenting himself, then the applicant for entry into the U.S. can also be permanently barred for visa fraud. Unless the foreigner holds a dual intent type visa, (s)he is subject to review for immigrant intent on each visit to the United States.|$|R

[...] Some Poles have been deeply disappointed by the Obama administration's inaction on the issue, and believe this was an empty promise. [...] Poland remains the only Central European country that is not a participating nation in the VWP , due to a <b>visa</b> <b>refusal</b> rate above the critical threshold of 3%.|$|R

50|$|After {{years of}} <b>visa</b> <b>refusals</b> {{due to his}} past arrests for {{marijuana}} possession, Japan had finally allowed McCartney, and thus Wings, to perform. It would be McCartney's first time playing there since 1966 with the Beatles, and anticipation was running high with Wings' tour completely sold out. However, upon his arrival in Tokyo on 16 January 1980, a search of McCartney's luggage revealed a bag containing 219 grams of marijuana, prompting his immediate arrest and eventually cancelling the tour. After a nine-day jail stay, McCartney was released and returned home to his Scottish farm. Deciding to put Wings on hold while he contemplated his future, he now decided to issue his solo recordings from the previous summer.|$|R
50|$|The Quartetto Italiano have {{recorded}} the complete quartets by Beethoven, Mozart, Schumann, Brahms and Webern. They rarely collaborated with external members, but two notable recordings are Mozart's Clarinet Quintet with Antoine-Pierre de Bavier (Decca, early 1950s), and Brahms's Piano Quintet Op.34 with Maurizio Pollini (Deutsche Grammophon, 1979). They also planned to play Schubert's String Quintet with Pierre Fournier, and Mozart's Quintet with two violas (K.516) with Milan Škampa, violist of the Smetana Quartet, but neither project was realized, the first {{due to the}} impossibility of finding a concert date, the second due to a <b>visa</b> <b>refusal</b> from the Czechoslovakian authorities.

5000|$|The Government {{restricted}} {{religious freedom}} both actively and indirectly. The Government enforced laws that limit freedom of worship, speech, and assembly. The Government was sometimes responsible for and regularly failed to condemn acts of religious insensitivity or intolerance. The Government frequently referred to groups {{it did not}} consider to be traditional as [...] "nontraditional," [...] and government officials and state media widely used the term [...] "sect" [...] when referring to such groups, {{although it is not}} an official designation. Foreign missionaries, clergy, and charity workers faced increased government obstacles, including deportation and <b>visa</b> <b>refusal</b> or revocation. With or without official registration, some religious groups encountered difficulty renting or purchasing property to establish places of worship, building churches, or reacquiring state-controlled religious property. The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community is banned in Belarus.|$|R

Permanent residents of designated countries who are not citizens of a designated country do not qualify for a visa waiver. The criteria for designation as program countries are specified in Section 217 (c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Title [...] ). The criteria stress passport security and a very low nonimmigrant <b>visa</b> <b>refusal</b> rate, not more than 3% as specified in Section 217(c)(2)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act and ongoing compliance with the immigration law of the United States.|$|R

25|$|In 2000 Singh was {{appointed}} by then Foreign Secretary Robin Cook as 'Independent Monitor for Entry Clearance' between October 2000 and November 2002. The position was established in 1993 and requires a review of around 1000 randomly chosen entry clearance refusals without a right of appeal {{and looking at the}} overall quality of refusal decisions, paying particular attention to fairness, consistency and the procedures used to reach those decisions. He makes random checks on some 800-1,000 <b>visa</b> <b>refusals</b> a year to see whether decisions are consistent and fair, and makes an annual report to the Parliament of the United Kingdom suggesting any improvements he thinks necessary. Singh is the second person to hold the job – his predecessor was Dame Elizabeth Anson.

50|$|Respect for {{religious}} freedom has recently worsened. The Government continued to restrict religious freedom {{in accordance with}} the provisions of a 2002 law on religion and a 2003 concordat with the Belarusian Orthodox Church (BOC), a branch of the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC) and the only officially recognized Orthodox denomination. Although there is no state religion, the concordat grants the BOC privileged status. Protestants in particular attracted negative attention, presumably for their perceived links with the United States. Numerous anti-Semitic acts and attacks on religious monuments, buildings, and cemeteries occurred with little discernible response from the Government. Authorities kept many religious communities waiting as long as several years for decisions about property registration or restitution. Authorities also harassed and fined members of certain religious groups, especially those that the authorities appeared to regard as bearers of foreign cultural influence or as having a political agenda. Foreign missionaries, clergy, and humanitarian workers affiliated with churches faced many government-imposed obstacles, including deportation and <b>visa</b> <b>refusal</b> or cancellation.|$|R
