25|$|The Copenhagen <b>Frequency</b> <b>Plan</b> of 1948 {{resulted}} in Norway only being allocated one medium wave and one long wave frequency. The audio quality diminished as Norwegian transmitters {{were forced to}} share frequencies with foreign channels. This could be overcome by installing a network of FM broadcasting transmitters. The Telegraphy Administration rejected FM, stating that this would require the entire country to buy new radios. A 1949 plan proposed a new long wave transmitter at Kløfta and a national network of medium wave transmitters. NRK accepted the transmitter at Kløfta, but rejected the medium wave transmitters. As {{twenty percent of the}} population lacked acceptable radio coverage, NRK decided in 1953 to build FM transmitters in Western Norway and Agder to reach these areas. An advantage of building FM transmitters was that they could be co-located with television transmitters, reducing the roll-out costs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Frequency {{assignment}} {{is a well-known}} problem in Operations Research for which different mathematical models exist depending on the application specific conditions. However, most of these models are far from considering actual technologies currently deployed in GSM networks (e. g. frequency hopping). These technologies allow the network capacity to be actually increased to some extent by avoiding the interferences provoked by channel reuse due to the limited available radio spectrum, thus improving the Quality of Service (QoS) for subscribers and an income for the operators as well. Therefore, the automatic generation of <b>frequency</b> <b>plans</b> in real GSM networks is of great importance for present GSM operators. This {{is known as the}} Automatic <b>Frequency</b> <b>Planning</b> (AFP) problem. In this paper, we focus on solving this problem for a realistic-sized, real-world GSM network by using Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs). To be precise, we have developed a (1, λ) EA for which very specialized operators have been proposed and analyzed. Results show that this algorithmic approach is able to compute accurate <b>frequency</b> <b>plans</b> for real-world instances. ...|$|R
