5|$|Beetles have {{a variety}} of ways to communicate, <b>including</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> pheromones. The {{mountain}} pine beetle emits a pheromone to attract other beetles to a tree. The mass of beetles are able to overcome the chemical defenses of the tree. After the tree's defenses have been exhausted, the beetles emit an anti-aggregation pheromone. The species can stridulate to communicate.|$|E

5|$|In June 2009, Square Enix {{announced}} {{they had decided}} not to use PlayOnline for Final Fantasy XIV due to the marked decrease of content on the service.

In June 2011, Square Enix announced that they would merge the account management portion of the PlayOnline service into Square Enix accounts from July 2011 and culminate on August 31, 2011. However, PlayOnline is still required in order to actually play Final Fantasy XI. Square Enix replicated the idea of the friends list from Final Fantasy XI in Final Fantasy XIV.

5|$|Manufacturers and {{academics}} have conducted studies and experiments {{in an effort}} to improve the stretchiness, melting characteristics, browning, fat content and water retention of pizza cheese. Several patents exist for specialized varieties of pizza cheese and for its processing. A study by Rudan and Barbano found that the addition of a thin layer of vegetable oil atop low- and reduced-fat pizza cheese increased meltability and reduced browning and dehydration when the product was cooked, but the texture remained overly chewy and tough. A study by Perry et al. found various methods to heighten the melt of low-fat pizza cheese by increasing its moisture, <b>including</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> pre-acidification, fat-replacers, and exopolysaccharide starter cultures as well as higher pasteurization temperatures.|$|E

5|$|The episode {{had been}} written by Markus and McFeely, the writers of the Captain America films, by January 2014, with the episode being officially ordered that May. Hayley Atwell reprises her role as Carter from the film series, and is joined by regular cast members James D'Arcy, Chad Michael Murray, Enver Gjokaj, and Shea Whigham. Dominic Cooper guest stars as Stark, also reprising his film role, while Costa Ronin portrays the younger version of another film character, Anton Vanko. The episode {{contains}} several other connections to the films, <b>including</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> archive footage from The First Avenger. Costume designer Giovanna Ottobre-Melton and visual effects companies Industrial Light & Magic and Base FX worked on establishing an authentic period setting for the episode, a fictionalized 1940s New York.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} the first in the series to feature the {{character}} of Worf, who had previously been a character on , in a central storyline. Due to time restraints in filming, there were edits made to the scripts and the production team were forced to make best use of the cave sets which had been seen on the show previously. The sword itself was created specifically for the episode, and was made to seem more elaborate than the bat'leths previously seen in Star Trek, including hand etchings to make it appear similar to Damascus steel. Composer David Bell sought to bring influences of Richard Wagner into the score, <b>including</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> Wagner tubas. Although producers were disappointed with the initial fan reaction, critics later gave a mostly positive response to the episode and compared it to Indiana Jones and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.|$|E
5|$|The {{final two}} co-productions of the 1970s, both made in 1979, {{occurred}} in Kuwait and Spain. The Kuwaiti show, Iftah Ya Simsim, which ran until 1990, {{was the first}} of its kind in the Arab world. It used Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), and was broadcast in 22 Arab countries. The show continued to be well-known decades after it went off the air. It returned in 2013, and had similar goals and objectives as the original version, <b>including</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> MSA. Barrio Sésamo, made in Spain, featured a snail character who was able to hide a thousand and one things in her shell. One of the show's Muppet characters, Dr. Valentin Ruster, was based upon Dr. Valentin Fuster, a native Spaniard who worked at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. Dr. Fuster's likeness was created to educate children in Spain about exercise and eating healthy.|$|E

5|$|The {{flag was}} officially adopted on March 5, 1923, {{and has been}} a symbol of the state of Washington since then. Washington had {{achieved}} statehood in 1889, but did not have an official flag at the time. The Washington chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution designed the flag in 1915 and campaigned for its adoption by the Washington State Legislature in the early 1920s. The state flag has undergone minor revisions since its adoption, <b>including</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> standardized colors in 1955 and a modernized seal in 1967.|$|E
5|$|Upon its October 1974 release, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre {{was banned}} {{outright}} in several countries, and numerous theaters later stopped showing {{the film in}} response to complaints about its violence. While it initially drew a mixed reception from critics, it was enormously profitable, grossing over $30 million at the domestic box office. It has since received a positive reappraisal and gained {{a reputation as one}} of the best and most influential horror films in cinema history. It is credited with originating several elements common in the slasher genre, <b>including</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> power tools as murder weapons and the characterization of the killer as a large, hulking, faceless figure. The popularity of the film led to a franchise that continued the story of Leatherface and his family through sequels, remakes, one prequel, comic books and video games.|$|E
5|$|Warfare was endemic {{in early}} Anglo-Saxon England, and major {{conflicts}} still occurred approximately every generation {{in the later}} period. Groups of well-armed noblemen and their households formed the heart of these armies, supported by larger numbers of temporary troops levied from across the kingdom, called the fyrd. By the 9th century, armies of 20,000 men could be called up for campaigns, with another 28,000 men available to guard urban defences. The most common weapon was the spear, with swords used by the wealthier nobles; cavalry was probably less common than in wider Europe, but some Anglo-Saxons did fight from horseback. The Viking attacks on England in the 9th century led to developments in tactics, <b>including</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> shield walls in battle, and the Scandinavian seizure {{of power in the}} 11th century introduced housecarls, a form of elite household soldier who protected the king.|$|E
