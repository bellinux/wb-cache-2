40|$|AbstractThe {{evacuation}} process <b>in</b> a <b>supermarket</b> is simulated by {{a two-dimensional}} Cellular Automata (CA) model in this paper. In this model, the interactions among people and those {{between people and}} obstacles in forward direction are considered, and the ‘Danger-degree’ concept is introduced to solve the path select of people evacuation process. This paper studies the effect of different shelves’ orientation and personal familiarity degree of exits to evacuation time. The result shows if occupants are fewer <b>in</b> <b>supermarket,</b> shelves orientations have little influence on evacuation time; but when occupants are larger, the longitudinal shelves orientation is more appropriate for evacuation <b>in</b> <b>supermarket</b> than transverse shelves orientation. The {{study also found that}} the evacuation time reduces, the exits’ available time improve with the increase of personal familiar with exits by induction. This can provide theoretical foundation for arranging the shelves orientation <b>in</b> <b>supermarket</b> as well as drafting contingency plans of pedestrians’ induction evacuation...|$|R
5|$|In the 1960s, {{isolated}} {{communities were}} unable to access produce {{that the majority of}} Britain would such as peppers or aubergines. Artisan Welsh produce was limited or non-existent, farms rarely made their own cheese, and Welsh wine was of poor quality. By the 1990s, historical Welsh foods were going through a revival. Farmers' markets became more popular, Welsh organic vegetables and farm-made cheese started to appear <b>in</b> <b>supermarkets.</b> Other modern Welsh characteristics are more subtle, such as supermarkets offering salty butters and laverbread or butchers labelling beef skirt as 'cawl meat'.|$|E

5|$|The Shabbat and festival breads of the Yemenite Jews {{have become}} popular in Israel {{and can be}} bought frozen <b>in</b> <b>supermarkets.</b> Jachnun is very thinly rolled dough, brushed with oil or fat and baked {{overnight}} at a very low heat.

Kubaneh is a yeast dough baked overnight and traditionally served on Shabbat morning. Lahoh is a spongy, pancake-like bread made of fermented flour and water, and fried in a pan.

40|$|The {{last two}} decades have seen rapid {{economic}} growth in Zambia {{and the proliferation of}} foreign supermarket chain stores. However, this growth has translated into neither significant job creation nor significant poverty reduction. Furthermore, while the expansion of <b>supermarket</b> chains <b>in</b> Zambia has continued, local processing firms' participation <b>in</b> <b>supermarket</b> value chains remains limited. This paper assesses the hindrances to local processing firms' participation <b>in</b> <b>supermarket</b> value chains and how those firms' participation might stimulate growth through regional trade. Our results show that local processing firms' participation <b>in</b> regional <b>supermarket</b> value chains is constrained by a number of factors that pose either strategic or structural barriers to entry...|$|R
5|$|Thomcord grape is {{a hybrid}} of Thompson Seedless grape (Vitis vinifera, or Sultanina), which is popular <b>in</b> <b>supermarkets</b> during the summer, and seeded Concord grape (Vitis labrusca), {{commonly}} used to make grape juice and jelly. It is a plump, juicy, seedless table grape and is slightly firmer than Concord. Thomcord has a blue-black skin with medium thickness and a whitish bloom. Unlike Concord, whose tough skin separates easily from the fruit, Thomcord has a more edible skin that clings to the flesh, much like Thompson Seedless. It has an aromatic flavor, similar to the Concord in taste ("labrusca"), though lighter due to the sweet, mild taste from Thompson Seedless.|$|E

40|$|The {{expansion}} of <b>supermarkets</b> <b>in</b> developing countries may have far-reaching consequences for poverty and rural development. While {{previous studies have}} compared farm profits between participants and non-participants <b>in</b> <b>supermarket</b> channels, wider household welfare effects have hardly been analyzed. Moreover, structural {{differences between the two}} groups have been ignored. We address these issues by using endogenous switching regression and building on a survey of vegetable farmers in Kenya. Participation <b>in</b> <b>supermarket</b> channels is associated with a 50 % gain in average household income, leading to significant poverty reduction. To realize these benefits on a larger scale will require institutional and policy support. supermarkets; household income; sample selection; endogenous switching regression; Kenya; Africa...|$|R
