25|$|In {{the decades}} {{immediately}} before Canadian Confederation in 1867, French-speaking Quebeckers, known as Canadiens in French, remained a majority within Canada East. Estimates of their {{proportion of the}} population between 1851 and 1861 are 75% of the total population, with around 20% of the remaining population largely composed of English-speaking citizens of British or Irish descent. From 1871 to 1931, the relative size of the French-speaking population stayed much the same, rising to a peak of 80.2% of Quebec's population in 1881. The proportion of citizens of British descent declined slightly <b>in</b> <b>contrast,</b> <b>from</b> a peak of 20.4% of the population in 1871, to 15% by 1931. Other minorities made up the remainder {{of the population of the}} province.|$|E
25|$|For {{the early}} period, before the 6th century BC, the term Ionic temple can, at best, {{designate}} a temple in the Ionian areas of settlement. No fragments of architecture {{belonging to the}} Ionic order have been found from this time. Nonetheless, some early temples in the area already indicate the rational system that was to characterise the Ionic system later on, e.g. the Heraion II of Samos. Thus, even at an early point, the axes of the cella walls aligned with the column axes, whereas in Doric architecture, the external wall faces do so. The early temples also show no concern for the typical Doric feature of viewability from all sides, they regularly lack an opisthodomos; the peripteros only became widespread {{in the area in}} the 4th century BC. <b>In</b> <b>contrast,</b> <b>from</b> an early point, Ionic temples stress the front by using double porticos. Elongated peristaseis became a determining element. At the same time, the Ionic temples were characterised by their tendency to use varied and richly decorated surfaces, as well as the widespread use of light-shade contrasts.|$|E

50|$|After the war {{was over}} the troops were eager to return home, but no troop ships were available.

5|$|The sexual {{freedoms of}} Liao also stood <b>in</b> stark <b>contrast</b> <b>from</b> {{those of the}} Han Chinese. Women from the upper Liao classes, {{like those of the}} Han Chinese upper classes, had {{arranged}} marriages, in some cases for political purposes. However women from the lower classes of the Liao did not have arranged marriages, and would attract suitors by singing and dancing in the streets. The songs served as self-advertisements, with the women telling of their beauty, familial status, and domestic skills. Virginity was not a requirement for marriage among the Liao, and many Liao women were sexually promiscuous before marriage, which stood <b>in</b> sharp <b>contrast</b> <b>from</b> the beliefs of the Han Chinese. Khitan women had the right to divorce their husbands and were able to remarry after being divorced.|$|R
5000|$|The town derived {{its name}} from an archaic Langkasuka-Malay language, which means [...] "the declaratory place".

50|$|The third {{generation}} Audi 100, launched in September 1982, had an aerodynamic look, achieving a drag coefficient of 0.30 for its smoothest base model. The increased aerodynamic efficiency resulted in better fuel economy. The design was <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>from</b> the boxy {{shape of the}} C2. Audi innovated flush windows on the C3, a key area for aerodynamic drag that has been widely adopted by other manufacturers. The aerodynamic body gave the 100 higher top speed than other cars of similar engine size. A new technology introduced in the C3 included the procon-ten safety system.|$|E
50|$|Real estate or {{immovable}} property {{is a legal}} term (in some jurisdictions) that encompasses land along with anything permanently affixed to the land, such as buildings. Real estate ({{immovable property}}) is often considered synonymous with real property, <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>from</b> personal property (also sometimes called chattel or personalty). However, for technical purposes, some people prefer to distinguish real estate, referring {{to the land and}} fixtures themselves, from real property, referring to ownership rights over real estate. The terms real estate and real property are used primarily in common law, while civil law jurisdictions refer instead to immovable property.|$|E

(<b>In</b> <b>contrast,</b> <b>from</b> 1879/80 onward the directories show the other terminal as [...] "Exchange Station, Drake St"). Neither the map by Dixon & Hindle [...] nor the 1906 OS map gives a name for the station other than 'Midland Station', though the latter does name Exchange Station.|$|E
50|$|Historically, {{government}} spending increased year-over-year in nominal (i.e., unadjusted for inflation) terms from 1971 to 2009. However, {{by limiting the}} rate of growth in discretionary spending (defense and non-defense) while growing revenues, the budget was balanced from 1998-2001. From 1990 to 1999, discretionary spending grew by a total of 14%, while revenues grew 77%. <b>In</b> <b>contrast,</b> <b>from</b> 2000-2009, discretionary spending grew by a total of 101% while revenues grew only 4% (see graphic at right). Though a balanced budget is ideal, allowing down payment on debt and more flexibility within government budgeting, limiting deficits to within 1% to 2% of GDP is sufficient to stabilize the debt.|$|E

50|$|The {{historic}} city centre of Mühlhausen consists of three parts. Within the inner city wall are the old town (south of Schwemmnotte river around Untermarkt and St. Blaise's Church) and the new town (north of Schwemmnotte river around Obermarkt and St. Mary's Church). The former suburbiums of Mühlhausen are situated between the inner and the outer city walls. Like the inner city, they are of medieval origin, but <b>in</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>from</b> the core, this area was overbuilt often during the city's later history and today shows a mixture {{of old and new}} buildings. Within the inner city walls, most buildings date back to the Middle Ages. In the late 19th and the 20th century, the city grew into all directions and a relatively low density of buildings is typical for Mühlhausen, so that the built-up area is very large in relation to the number of inhabitants.|$|E
