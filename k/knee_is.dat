5|$|Low {{back pain}} may be {{classified}} {{based on the}} signs and symptoms. Diffuse pain that does not change in response to particular movements, and is localized to the lower back without radiating beyond the buttocks, is classified as nonspecific, the most common classification. Pain that radiates down the leg below the <b>knee,</b> <b>is</b> located on one side (in the case of disc herniation), or is on both sides (in spinal stenosis), and changes in severity in response to certain positions or maneuvers is radicular, making up 7% of cases. Pain that is accompanied by red flags such as trauma, fever, a history of cancer or significant muscle weakness may indicate a more serious underlying problem and is classified as needing urgent or specialized attention.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{symptom of}} prepatellar {{bursitis}} is the {{swelling of the}} area around the kneecap. It generally does not produce a significant amount of pain unless pressure is applied directly to the swelling. The area of swelling may be red (erythema), warm to the touch, or surrounded by cellulitis, particularly if the area has become infected. In such cases, the bursitis is often accompanied by fever. Unlike arthritis, prepatellar bursitis generally does not affect the range of motion of the knee, though it may cause some discomfort when the <b>knee</b> <b>is</b> completely flexed. Flexion and extension of the knee may cause crepitus.|$|E
5|$|Chris's <b>knee</b> <b>is</b> {{badly injured}} when Danni's ex-boyfriend Stephen Montague (Damian Hill) attacks him. He {{undergoes}} surgery and the flirts with nurse Will Dempier (Christian Heath) when he suffers {{a reaction to}} the analgesic. Chris becomes frustrated when Hudson is not there for him, and questions how he can be in a relationship and feel so alone. He decides to ask Will out for a drink, but later cancels. Chris collapses due to complications from his surgery and is readmitted to hospital. He apologises to Will for cancelling on him and then tells him about Hudson. During Chris's next visit to Hudson, he appears distracted and when Hudson asks him if he is seeing someone else, Chris hesitates and Hudson breaks up with him. Chris tells Hudson about Will and how lonely he is. Hudson does not want Chris to date him out of guilt, and they say goodbye. Chris spends some time with Will and they begin dating, but the relationship ends when Will's dog, Napoleon, bites Kyle's dog Bossy, and Will refuses to accept responsibility or apologise.|$|E
40|$|The {{model of}} {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) geometric <b>knee</b> <b>was</b> built, which included femoral-tibial, patellofemoral articulations and {{the bone and}} soft tissues. Dynamic finite element (FE) model of <b>knee</b> <b>was</b> developed to simulate both the kinematics and the internal stresses during knee flexion. The biomechanical experimental system of <b>knee</b> <b>was</b> built to simulate knee squatting using cadaver knees. The flexion motion and dynamic contact characteristics of <b>knee</b> <b>were</b> analyzed, and verified by comparing with the data from in vitro experiment. The {{results showed that the}} established dynamic FE models of <b>knee</b> <b>are</b> capable of predicting kinematics and the contact stresses during flexion, and could be an efficient tool for the analysis of total knee replacement (TKR) and knee prosthesis design...|$|R

5|$|During Harrison's administration, the Lakota Sioux, {{previously}} {{confined to}} reservations in South Dakota, grew restive {{under the influence}} of Wovoka, a medicine man, who encouraged them to participate in a spiritual movement called the Ghost Dance. Many in Washington did not understand the predominantly religious nature of the Ghost Dance, and thought it was a militant movement being used to rally Native Americans against the government. On December 29, 1890, troops from the Seventh Cavalry clashed with the Sioux at Wounded Knee. The result was a massacre of at least 146 Sioux, including many women and children; the dead Sioux were buried in a mass grave. In reaction Harrison directed Major General Nelson A. Miles to investigate and ordered 3500 federal troops to South Dakota; the uprising was brought to an end. Wounded <b>Knee</b> <b>is</b> considered the last major American Indian battle in the 19th century. Harrison's general policy on American Indians was to encourage assimilation into white society and, despite the massacre, he believed the policy to have been generally successful. This policy, known as the allotment system and embodied in the Dawes Act, was favored by liberal reformers at the time, but eventually proved detrimental to American Indians as they sold most of their land at low prices to white speculators.|$|E
25|$|When the <b>knee</b> <b>is</b> semi-flexed, the biceps femoris in {{consequence}} of its oblique direction rotates the leg slightly outward.|$|E
25|$|Historically, Wounded <b>Knee</b> <b>is</b> {{generally}} considered {{to be the end of}} the collective multi-century series of conflicts between colonial and U.S. forces and American Indians, known collectively as the Indian Wars. It was not however the last armed conflict between Native Americans and the United States.|$|E
50|$|Snake Hips is a {{movement}} in which the <b>knees</b> <b>are</b> moved forward and back, first one knee then the other, while keeping the feet together. As in Ball the Jack, in which the <b>knees</b> <b>are</b> held together, {{this results in a}} rotation of the hips.|$|R
30|$|Firstly the <b>knee</b> <b>was</b> tested intact, and {{static and}} dynamic {{measurements}} recorded. After the intact <b>knee</b> <b>was</b> tested, the ACL was entirely cut, using an open technique through a minimally invasive medial parapatellar arthrotomy. The arthrotomy was then closed and both static and dynamic measurements recorded.|$|R

25|$|Knee {{ligament}} {{injuries are}} a common injury in wrestling. One being an injury to the Medial collateral ligament which {{is also known as}} the MCL and is located on the inside. Another common injury to the <b>knee</b> <b>is</b> on the outside Lateral Collateral Ligament which is known as the LCL. Leg or knee injuries are commonly caused by over twisting the leg outward {{from the middle of the}} body.|$|E
25|$|This is {{the last}} phase of the {{recovery}} rehabilitation. Phase V includes returning to sports after being cleared by therapist or surgeon. In order {{for this to happen}} the patient must have full range of motion, continue maintaining strength and endurance, and be able to increase proprioception with agility drills. Patient is still to be aware that going down hill or down stairs while the <b>knee</b> <b>is</b> aggravated may cause further injury like a meniscus tear.|$|E
25|$|The main {{surgical}} wound is {{over the}} upper proximal tibia, which prevents the typical pain experienced when kneeling after surgery. The wound is typically smaller {{than that of a}} patellar ligament graft, and so causes less post-operative pain. Another option first described in 2004, a minimally invasive technique for harvesting {{from the back of the}} <b>knee,</b> <b>is</b> faster, produces a significantly smaller wound, avoids the complications of graft harvesting from the anterior incision, and decreases the risk of nerve injury.|$|E
30|$|The <b>knee</b> <b>was</b> then scanned using a 64 -slice multidetector CT scanner (Siemens Sensation, Munich, Germany). Scans were {{performed}} with the full body tilted in lateral decubitus using 0.6  mm thick slices from extension to full flexion, by 20 ° increments controlled with a goniometer. The <b>knee</b> <b>was</b> scanned again with the same technique after TKA implantation.|$|R
5000|$|Dawn dolls' <b>knees</b> <b>are</b> {{known to}} take on a greenish tinge over time due to the copper inside the joint. The copper wire inside the <b>knees</b> <b>is</b> what allows the joints to [...] "click" [...] into and hold various positions. The dolls with the green knee {{problems}} tend to be the ones with the slightly heavier builds.|$|R
25|$|<b>Knees</b> <b>are</b> {{tightened}} (in effect, {{the knee}} caps pulled up) and facing forward.|$|R
25|$|Arthroplasty is an {{orthopedic}} surgery where the articular {{surface of a}} musculoskeletal joint is replaced, remodeled, or realigned by osteotomy or some other procedure. It is an elective procedure that is done to relieve pain and restore function to the joint after damage by arthritis (rheumasurgery) or some other type of trauma. As well as the standard total knee replacement surgery, the uni-compartmental knee replacement, in which only one weight-bearing surface of an arthritic <b>knee</b> <b>is</b> replaced, is a popular alternative.|$|E
25|$|Rotation on {{the spot}} about a {{vertical}} axis is achieved by the helicopter turn: The diver bends the knees so that the fins are approximately in line with, but raised slightly above the body axis, and ankle movements are used to scull water sideways. The fin is rotated to maximize sideways projected area, then a combination of rotation of the lower leg and <b>knee</b> <b>is</b> used to produce sideways thrust. The fin is feathered to reduce drag for the return stroke. Thrust away from the centreline is more effective for most divers.|$|E
25|$|In Paris {{there is}} a full length marble statue by Pierre Julien, now in the Louvre, that was {{commissioned}} in 1781 and exhibited at the 1785 Salon. The writer is represented in an ample cloak, sitting in contemplation on a gnarled tree on which a vine with grapes is climbing. On his <b>knee</b> <b>is</b> the manuscript of the fable of the fox and the grapes, while at his feet a fox is seated on his hat with its paw on a leather-bound volume, looking up at him. Small scale porcelain models were made of this by the Sèvres pottery and in polychrome porcelain by the Frankenthal pottery. In the following century small models were made of the bronze statue by Etienne Marin Melingue, exhibited in Paris in 1840 and in London in 1881. In this the poet is leaning thoughtfully against a rock, hat in hand. Also in the Cour Napoléon of the Louvre is the 1857 standing stone statue by Jean-Louis Jaley.|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} in unlimited. Previous studies of human <b>knee</b> motion <b>are</b> based on finite rotation data collected using large rotation steps varying from 5 to 30 degrees. In some cases this rotation data {{is used to}} develop axes of rotation for the joint. For such analysis, the rotation axis developed may be {{significantly different from the}} joint's instantaneous axis of rotation because, in general, the axis of rotation developed using finite rotation steps only closely approximates the true instantaneous axis of rotation if the step size is small. For the current study, a device has been developed to record high frequency (15 Hz) rotation and translation data of the femur and tibia during knee flexion. Kinematic constraint equations have been developed to analyze the six degree of freedom rotation and translation data to obtain an accurate approximation to the instantaneous axis of rotation. Four cadaveric <b>knees</b> <b>were</b> II analyzed with all ligaments intact. Motion characteristics common to all <b>knees</b> <b>were</b> identified. The most obvious characteristic, internal tibial rotation, was related to the initial varus/valgus orientation of each knee. The anterior cruciate ligaments (ACL) of these same <b>knees</b> <b>were</b> subsequently severed, the <b>knees</b> <b>were</b> measured, and the motion analyzed. Differences in the motion characteristics of each <b>knee</b> <b>were</b> detected alter the ACL was cut[URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|R

25|$|The {{harmonic}} {{movements of}} the dolphin kick and flutter kick are {{in contrast to the}} breaststroke whip kick, which really deserves the name kick. Scissor kick and frog kick are intermediate. Humans have strong muscles in the legs and would need swim fins (like a frog) to bring all their power into the water and stand with the sole of the feet on the water. Rather the leg grabs almost as much water as the foot and a small amount of water is accelerated to high kinetic energy, but not much impulse is transferred. The toes are bent, the feet point 45° outwards, the sole points backwards, to mimic a hydrofoil. While closing in a V shape to the rear a small “lifting” force can be felt. Unlike in the other kicks, the joints are moved into extrema. Before the kick the <b>knee</b> <b>is</b> maximally bent and the upper leg is rotating along its axis to its extreme outer position and the lower leg is twisted to extreme, {{at the end of the}} kick the ankles are maximally turned to the inside so that the soles clap together to achieve a nozzle effect like in a jelly fish. Therefore, training involves getting flexible in addition to fitness and precision. The sudden sideways stress on knee at the kick can lead to uncomfortable noise and feeling for the beginner and to wear for the senior.|$|E
500|$|DVT in {{the legs}} is {{proximal}} (or iliofemoral) when above the knee and distal (or calf) when below the knee. DVT below the popliteal vein, a proximal vein behind the <b>knee,</b> <b>is</b> classified as distal and has limited clinical significance compared to proximal DVT. An initial episode of DVT is called incident and any subsequent DVT is termed recurrent. [...] Bilateral DVT refers to clots in both legs while unilateral means that only a single leg is affected.|$|E

After his second retirement following the 1997–98 NBA season, the following quote from the 1992 film A River Runs Through It was added to the base: [...] "At that moment I knew, surely and clearly, that I was witnessing perfection. He stood before us, suspended above the earth, free from all its laws like a work of art, and I knew, just as surely and clearly, that life is not a work of art, and that the moment could not last." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{anatomy of}} the forelegs begin at the scapula. This is the {{shoulder}} in which provides the ease of movement as it is connected to various bones surrounding it such as the cervical vertebra (a section of the spine). The next bone is the humerus which leads onto the radius below. The radius is then connected to {{the bones of the}} knee. The carpus is located at front of the knee and the pisiform is the back of the knee. Below the <b>knee</b> <b>is</b> the cannon bone which is also known as the 3rd metacarpal. 55 million years ago when the Eohippus existed, the cannon bone used to be the 3rd toe of the foot. It's fusion took place in order to increase height and power of the limb. Behind the cannon bone are the splint bones. The splint bones are also known as the 2nd and 4th metacarpal and fused 25 - 35 million years ago {{during the time of the}} Miohippus. They provide extra strength and support of the cannon bone and used to be the 2nd and 4th toes of the foot. Below the cannon bone is the fetlock joint in which lays a structure if many bones. Firstly are the sesamoid bones that act as part of the system that allows the leg to drop as pressure is applied and spring back up as pressure is released. Below this is the proximal phalanx also known as the long pastern which is followed by the middle phalanx (short pastern). Below these bones are the navicular bone and the distal phalanx. the distal phalanx can be known as the coffin bone or the pedal bone. Below the navicular bone is the navicular bursa.|$|E
