5|$|English has {{two primary}} tenses, past (preterit) and non-past.

5|$|Another {{difference}} is {{the manner in which}} random battles are encountered. Like other Final Fantasy games, random battles occur on the world map. However, in Final Fantasy Tactics, random battles only occur in pre-set locations, marked in green on the world map. Passing over one of these spots may result in a random encounter. Another major aspect of battles is magical attacks. Certain magical attacks cause area of effect damage, and many of the more powerful magical attacks require several turns of charging. Hit Points of enemy units are also visible to the player (<b>except</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of certain bosses), allowing the player to know exactly how much damage they still have to inflict on a particular unit.|$|E
5|$|Before public release, {{work units}} go through several quality {{assurance}} steps to keep problematic ones from becoming fully available. These testing stages include internal, beta, and advanced, before a final full release across Folding@home. Folding@home's work units are normally processed only once, <b>except</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rare event that errors occur during processing. If this occurs for three different users, {{the unit is}} automatically pulled from distribution. The Folding@home support forum {{can be used to}} differentiate between issues arising from problematic hardware and bad work units.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the start}} of the match, much of the {{attention}} was placed on the weather forecast and the prospects of rain. In their 12 tour matches leading up to the Tests, Australia had been almost completely untroubled by the opposition <b>except</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two matches against Yorkshire and Hampshire on rain-affected pitches. In these two matches they came close to defeat after heavy batting collapses before recovering to victory. It was thus thought that the toss could be of great importance, especially if the team batting first had accumulated a substantial total by the time rain came. The match was the first Ashes Test to be played on English soil since the end of World War II.|$|E

5|$|Between 1925 and 1929, the SS was {{considered}} to be a small Gruppe (battalion) of the SA. <b>Except</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Munich area, the SS was unable to maintain any momentum in its membership numbers, which declined from 1,000 to 280 as the SA continued its rapid growth. As Heiden attempted to keep the SS from dissolving, Heinrich Himmler became his deputy in September 1927. Himmler displayed good organizational abilities compared to Heiden. The SS established a number of Gaus (regions or provinces). The SS-Gaus consisted of SS-Gau Berlin, SS-Gau Berlin Brandenburg, SS-Gau Franken, SS-Gau Niederbayern, SS-Gau Rheinland-SÃ¼d, and SS-Gau Sachsen.|$|E

A short high whistle is the primary contact call between a pair, while a harsh scraping call is the most common call used by females and large young, and brooding females call to their young with a deep, soft, frog-like croak.|$|E
