5|$|When Holmenkolbanen, the {{operator}} of the Holmenkoll Line, was merged into Oslo Sporveier in 1975, plans {{were put in}} place to replace the old teak cars with faster units that could operate from Nationaltheatret to Frognerseteren in 25 minutes—allowing a turn-around time of one <b>hour.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> time there had been two separate pools of trains for the eastern and western networks. On the eastern metro, the T1000 units were in use, while the western network was using older material. During the 1980s, some T1000 stock had been rebuilt with pantograph, and taken into use on the western network.|$|E
5|$|Pottier {{also won}} the fourth stage. In the fifth stage, he was leading by one <b>hour</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> halfway point. A cycling legend says {{that he decided to}} stop, entered a bar and ordered a bottle of wine, and drank it almost completely. When he saw the first other cyclists passing by, Pottier mounted his bicycle again, went after them, and won the stage. By this point, Pottier was leading the overall {{classification}} firmly. The winner of the 1905 Tour de France, Louis Trousselier, had had a bad first half of the Tour, and was many points behind. Trousselier rediscovered his form {{in the second half of}} the race, won the 7th, 9th, 10th and 11th stages, and was challenging the second place of Georges Passerieu. Passerieu defended his position by winning the 12th stage. In the last stage, Pottier showed his strength by winning the stage, after finishing together in Paris with Passerieu.|$|E
25|$|In 1921 it {{had been}} {{considered}} desirable to augment train lengths at the busy periods, and four new trailer coaches to the original specification were built at Eastleigh; 24 five-car trains were run per <b>hour</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> busiest times.|$|E
50|$|Cut-off {{times for}} the race were 4 <b>hours</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Álfavatn aid station (after {{approximately}} 22 km) and 6 <b>hours</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Emstrur aid station (after approximately 38.5 km).|$|R
50|$|Tjøtta's most {{prominent}} hobby is long-distance running. He discovered his talent during {{a stay in}} the United States, where jogging was popular.

25|$|After the Hillary Step, climbers {{also must}} {{traverse}} a loose and rocky section {{that has a}} large entanglement of fixed ropes that can be troublesome in bad weather.

25|$|Underwood {{took the}} last four Australian wickets in 27 balls in the final half an <b>hour</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the fifth Test in 1968, after a heavy {{thunderstorm}} {{on the fifth day}} had all but ended the match, to square an Ashes series that Australia were winning 1–0. He was named in 1969 as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year. Underwood also toured Australia in 1970–71, dismissing Terry Jenner to win the seventh Test at Sydney, and regain the Ashes.|$|E

25|$|When {{operated}} from austere {{bases and}} improvised landing strips such as public roads, an intended {{function of the}} type, a single Viggen could be maintained {{by a team of}} five conscripts under the supervision of a single chief mechanic. During such operations, a standard turnaround, including refueling and rearming, took less than ten minutes to perform; while an engine replacement took four hours. Over the long term, the Viggen required 22 man hours per flight hour of maintenance work at the depot level, and nine man hours per flight <b>hour</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> front line.|$|E
25|$|Observant Jews {{will eat}} only meat or poultry that is {{certified}} kosher. The meat {{must have been}} slaughtered by a shochet (ritual slaughterer) in accordance with Jewish law and is entirely drained of blood. Before it is cooked, it is soaked in water for half an hour, then placed on a perforated board, sprinkled with coarse salt (which draws out the blood), and left to sit for one <b>hour.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> end of this time, the salt is washed off and the meat is ready for cooking. Today, kosher meats purchased from a butcher or supermarket are usually already kashered as described above, and no additional soaking or salting is required.|$|E
25|$|Kosgei won the Berlin Half Marathon in 2006, {{setting a}} half {{marathon}} personal best of 59:07 minutes {{as well as}} bettering his marks over 15km and 20km along the way.

He took three consecutive wins at the Amatrice-Configno road race from 2008 to 2010, building upon his first win in 2003.

25|$|In {{the second}} innings, Caddick {{showed signs of}} {{returning}} to his best and took good advantage of {{the deterioration of the}} pitch, using good short-of-a-length deliveries to pick up six wickets and put England in a commanding position, needing just 194 to win. Curtly Ambrose (6–24) was at his most devastating, removing Atherton and Smith very early, and Ramprakash being run out, putting England in dire straits. Only Stewart managed to get into double figures, and only he and Thorpe survived more than half an <b>hour</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> crease facing the menace of Walsh and Ambrose, and by the close on the fourth day, England were reeling at 40/8, still 5 short of their lowest score in Tests.|$|E
25|$|Reliability: A {{wind farm}} has high {{technical}} reliability {{when the wind}} blows. That is, the output {{at any given time}} will only vary gradually due to falling wind speeds or storms (the latter necessitating shut downs). A typical wind farm is unlikely to have to shut down in less than half an <b>hour</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> extreme, whereas an equivalent sized power station can fail totally instantaneously and without warning. The total shut down of wind turbines is predictable via weather forecasting. The average availability of a wind turbine is 98%, and when a turbine fails or is shutdown for maintenance it only affects {{a small percentage of the}} output of a large wind farm.|$|E
25|$|The Salvage Pass, {{introduced}} in season {{two of the}} Australian version, is awarded to {{the winners of the}} first leg. The team who receives the pass may choose to give themselves a one-hour head start {{for the start of the}} next leg of the race or save the last team to arrive at the Pit Stop from elimination. This pass was also used alongside the Express Pass in The Amazing Race Philippines; however, teams in the Philippine version have the option of using it to gain a 30-minute advantage at a task rather than an <b>hour</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> start of the leg. For instance, it was used to enter the location of a clue box 30 minutes before opening time. The Salvage Pass was also featured in the third season of the Israeli version.|$|E

25|$|Upul Tharanga {{made another}} big score as Sri Lanka once again batted Bangladesh {{out of the}} game. The left-hander, who had a disappointing run in the Indian Oil Cup a month earlier, now hit plenty of {{boundaries}} into the off side, as he and Sanath Jayasuriya flayed the Bangladeshi pacers Tapash Baisya, Syed Rasel and Nazmul Hossain. Admittedly, Tharanga had a slice of luck early on, as Manjural Islam Rana dropped him at slip on 13, but he never failed from there. In the opening 15 overs, Tharanga and Jayasuriya added 100 runs, before Jayasuriya finally edged a short-pitched ball behind to wicket-keeper Khaled Mashud. A slower period followed, as number 3 Dilshan was more cautious against the seam bowlers, spending an <b>hour</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> crease but only making 27. Tharanga, however, accumulated singles well off the spinners, keeping the run rate well above five an over to end with 105 before Rana got his revenge - Tharanga came down the pitch to Rana, but missed the ball, and was stumped by Masud.|$|E
