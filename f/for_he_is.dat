5|$|The exact date of Gubazes's {{accession}} is unknown, but it {{must not}} have been much earlier than 541, when he is first attested as king of the Lazi. It is very likely that before his accession he had lived for several years at the Byzantine capital, Constantinople, <b>for</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> recorded {{to have been a}} silentiarius, an influential position at the imperial palace; alternatively, but less probably, he may have been given the title as an honorary appointment after his accession.|$|E
5|$|John Troglita {{is first}} {{mentioned}} as having {{participated in the}} Vandalic War (533–534) under Belisarius, and may be identifiable with another John, who commanded a unit of foederati in the battles of Ad Decimum and Tricamarum. Troglita remained {{in the province of}} Africa after Belisarius's departure in 534, and participated in the expeditions of Solomon against the Moors in 534–535. At the time, he was probably the local military governor (dux) in either Byzacena or, more probably, Tripolitania, <b>for</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> mentioned as leading successful expeditions against the Leuathae tribe. Troglita also fought against the mutinous army under the renegade Stotzas, participating in the first victory under Belisarius at Membresa in 536, and then, under Solomon's successor Germanus, in the decisive battle at Scalas Veteres in spring 537. In this battle, {{he was one of the}} commanders of the cavalry on the Byzantine army's right wing, which according to the historian Procopius was defeated and driven off by Stotzas's men, losing its standards in the process. Nevertheless, the battle resulted in an imperial victory. In 538, Troglita distinguished himself in the Battle of Autenti, probably in the Byzacena.|$|E
5|$|Manju (Sripriya) {{was raised}} in a {{dysfunctional}} family that consisted of a timid father and a philandering mother; she hurtles from one disastrous affair to another, leading to her degenerating into a cynical woman. Into her life enter two radically different men. One of them is her boss, Thyagu (Rajinikanth), who owns the advertising agency she works <b>for.</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> a stereotype of the successful man: money-minded, opinionated, arrogant, and a male chauvinist. In sharp contrast is Arun (Kamal Haasan), who has come to Chennai from Coimbatore to make a documentary on women. Sensitive and sincere, he believes his job has a purpose and is both shocked and amused at the cynical attitudes of Manju and Thyagu.|$|E
60|$|He {{did not say}} it very loud, <b>for</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not {{by nature}} a demonstrative man; neither did <b>he</b> whisper it, <b>for</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not ashamed to thank his God for mercies received.|$|R
50|$|<b>For</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{never far}} away.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> smiled; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{becoming}} calmer now, <b>for</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing something: <b>he</b> <b>was</b> obtaining results.|$|R
5|$|There {{are those}} who will {{consider}} it their duty, as friends of the Negro people, to tell us to revile him, to flee, even from the presence of his memory, to save ourselves by writing {{him out of the}} history of our turbulent times. Many will ask what Harlem finds to honor in this stormy, controversial and bold young captainand we will smile. Many will say turn awayaway from this man, <b>for</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not a man but a demon, a monster, a subverter and an enemy of the black manand we will smile. They will say that he is of hatea fanatic, a racistwho can only bring evil to the cause for which you struggle! And we will answer and say to them: Did you ever talk to Brother Malcolm? Did you ever touch him, or have him smile at you? Did you ever really listen to him? Did he ever do a mean thing? Was he ever himself associated with violence or any public disturbance? For if you did you would know him. And if you knew him you would know why we must honor him... And, in honoring him, we honor the best in ourselves.|$|E
5|$|Æthelred usually {{acted with}} the {{permission}} of or in association with King Alfred, but occasionally he acted independently of him. Although sometimes described as plain dux or ealdorman, his status was clearly quite different from that of other duces, <b>for</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> also accorded styles which aspire to divine grace and which appear to verge on the royal. In other words, there is no mistaking that the Mercians retained a conception of their ruler as a rightful successor to earlier kings, and a conception of their land as a kingdom with its own identity; but there is also no mistaking that Æthelred moved in an Alfredian world.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} very happy to hear it, my dear," [...] said her father. He waited--waited, looking at her, while she stared, in a long silence, at the fire. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> curious and impatient, <b>for</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> sure {{she was going to}} speak of Morris Townsend; but he let her take her own time, <b>for</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{determined}} to be very mild.|$|R
60|$|Frank smiled, <b>for</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{likewise}} {{very fond}} of little Constance.|$|R
60|$|Gabriel {{remained}} musing {{and said}} nothing, <b>for</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> in doubt.|$|R
25|$|<b>For</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> {{tenacious}} of his point.|$|E
25|$|<b>For</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> {{the cleanest}} {{in the use}} of his forepaws of any quadruped.|$|E
25|$|<b>For</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> {{the quickest}} to his mark of any creature.|$|E
60|$|But Sammy {{could not}} reply. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> thunderstruck. Neither could his father speak, <b>for</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> choking.|$|R
60|$|The aged butler became {{conscious}} with a jerk, <b>for</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> nodding.|$|R
60|$|She paused {{before she}} answered, <b>for</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> very stern and peremptory.|$|R
25|$|<b>For</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> {{the servant}} of the Living God duly and daily serving him.|$|E
25|$|The Strength of Israel {{will not}} lie nor relent. <b>For</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> not a man, that He should relent.|$|E

60|$|This reply disconcerted {{the fiery}} mountaineer, <b>for</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> anxious to fight.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, it <b>was</b> {{supposed}} that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> goin' deranged, poor fellow, {{and at last}} he suddenly disappeared, no one could tell why; but it's clear enough now, <b>for</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> made to put the accounts all wrong, and I suppose the struggle in his mind drove him to suicide, <b>for</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a long, thin, weakly sort of man, without much brains except for figures." ...|$|R

25|$|May Christ {{our true}} God, through the intercessions of His most pure Mother, of our holy and God-bearing fathers {{and of all}} the saints, have mercy on us and save us, <b>for</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> good and the Lover of mankind.|$|E
25|$|In the Poetic Edda poem Hárbarðsljóð, Meili {{receives}} a single mention; the god Thor declares that, {{even if he}} were an outlaw, he would reveal his name and his homeland, <b>for</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> the son of Odin, the brother of Meili, and the father of Magni.|$|E
25|$|May Christ {{our true}} God, Who for the {{salvation}} of the world endured spitting, and scourging, and buffeting, and the Cross, and death, through the intercessions of His most pure Mother, of our holy and God-bearing fathers, {{and of all the}} saints, have mercy on us and save us, <b>for</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> good and the Lover of mankind.|$|E

60|$|His Royal Highness was in rare good humour, <b>for</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> winning prodigiously.|$|R
60|$|I flatter {{myself that}} this nearly struck home, <b>for</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> plainly annoyed.|$|R
25|$|Suddenly, Gyges runs in distraught, <b>for</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> {{the bearer}} of evil news. He is {{followed}} by the priests of Venus who demand an audience with the King. Candaules, alarmed, orders them to be admitted. The priests are afraid, for Venus has already given signs of her displeasure, since hunger, pestilence and other miseries have fallen on the land and are spreading throughout Lydia.|$|E
25|$|In his commentary, {{the first}} bird {{represents}} the individual soul, {{while the second}} represents Brahman or God. The soul is essentially a reflection of Brahman. The tree represents the body. The soul identifies itself with the body, reaps the fruits of its actions, and undergoes rebirth. The Lord alone stands as an eternal witness, ever contented, and does not eat, <b>for</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> the director of both the eater and the eaten.|$|E
25|$|May Christ {{our true}} God, through the intercessions of His most pure Mother; of the holy, glorious and all-praised apostles, * of (the {{patron saint of}} the church or monastery), of (the saint whose feast day it is), of the holy and righteous {{ancestors}} of God, Joachim and Anna; {{and of all the}} saints, have mercy on us and save us, <b>for</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> good and the Lover of mankind.|$|E

60|$|Dick {{thought this}} probable, <b>for</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> wearing only his thin, {{ordinary}} clothes.|$|R
