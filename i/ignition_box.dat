50|$|Buddy Baker {{qualified}} on the pole, but {{dropped out}} on lap 38 with ignition problems causing a misfiring engine. The team {{had made some}} minor repairs by welding before the race and it was thought the primary ignition control box had been damaged. During attempts to diagnose and repair the problem, the team switched to the backup box and replaced much of the ignition system, to no avail. When the team returned home after the race, engine builder Waddell Wilson checked and determined that the crewman who had switched to the backup box by unplugging the primary <b>ignition</b> <b>box</b> and plugging into the backup box had in fact, during the chaos, plugged back into the defective primary box. When Wilson switched to the backup <b>ignition</b> <b>box,</b> the car fired in perfect condition.|$|E
5000|$|Hot Rod Magazine named MSD's 6A <b>ignition</b> <b>box</b> {{into its}} second {{class of the}} Speed Parts Hall of Fame in 2009 in {{recognition}} of how the company has helped to shape the American racing industry. MSD also received honors as the SEMA manufacturer {{of the year in}} both 2005 and 2007. The current president of the company, Russell Stephens, has also served {{on the board of directors}} for SEMA (2002-2006).|$|E
5000|$|Two singles were {{released}} from the album later in the year, [...] "Somebody to Love" [...] and [...] "White Rabbit", peaked respectively at number five and number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and are the band's only Top 40 hits on that chart. Both mono and stereo mixes are available on two 2001 reissues, an RCA Gold CD edition {{and as part of}} the <b>Ignition</b> <b>box</b> set. Another stereo reissue appeared on August 19, 2003, with six bonus tracks, including the mono A-sides of [...] "Somebody to Love" [...] and [...] "White Rabbit". The 2003 reissue was produced by Bob Irwin. The original United Kingdom version of the LP was a mish-mash of the United States version and their first LP, Jefferson Airplane Takes Off. [...] "Today" [...] was not released as a single but was played repeatedly on college radio and underground Classic rock stations across the nation repeatedly during the summer of love 1967 and remains one of their most popular songs to date.|$|E
50|$|An F3 racing kit was {{produced}} {{for a few}} years which included <b>ignition</b> <b>boxes,</b> carbs and exh, helping increase maximum revs, power and torque.|$|R
50|$|Yamaha {{produced}} the road going two-stroke motorcycle, {{loosely based on}} the TZ250 Yamaha racing bike. Parallel-twin, reverse cylinder and finally V-twin variants were produced. It evolved as a natural replacement for the popular RD 250/Yamaha RD350LC series of the 1980s. It has the Yamaha Power Valve System (YPVS) which raises and lowers the exhaust port depending on the rpm of the engine. The YPVS servo motor starts to open at about 6,000rpm. In standard form 50 bhp is claimed at 10,000rpm. Although mid 40s is more realistic, and will not rev much above 9,500rpm in standard trim, owing to the restrictive standard exhausts and <b>ignition</b> <b>boxes.</b>|$|R
40|$|The National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) is {{the support}} center for wild land {{firefighting}} in the US located in Boise, ID. One {{of the many}} activities that the NIFC coordinates is prescribed burns. Prescribed burns are one of NIFC’smanagement tools to help prevent major forest fires by burning undergrowth and they also help with maintaining and improving habitat. Recently, NIFC has decommissioned their prescribed burn apparatus {{due to lack of}} safety specifications, the Terra-Torch, produced by Firecon, based out of Ontario, Oregon. Last year, Boise State University produced a burn apparatus prototype for NIFC to replace the Terra-Torch. Although last year’sprototype was better than the Terra-Torch, NIFC wants Boise State University to re-engineer the apparatus utilizing standard parts with certain safety ratings such as the Underwriters Laboratories (UL) rating. Our group has focused on re-engineering the ergonomics and robustness of last year’sapparatus using standardized parts. We have focused our attention to the apparatus’sfront handle and igniter bracket. So far, we have developed a front handle design that will include two switches: one that will control the igniter switch and the other will control both the pump’sclutch and mapp gas solenoid. With this design, we will have a fail-safe system that will protect the operator and others around. The failsafe system will shut down the apparatus in case the operator would happen to fall and or drop the apparatus. This would include extinguishing the flame and disengaging the clutch to the pump. Our design for the igniter bracket include: two hose clamps and a curved flame tip. The two hose clamps and curved flame tip will provide easy adjustability for any weather condition to ensure proper ignition of the gelled fuel. In near future, we plan on relocating the sparker <b>ignition</b> <b>box,</b> and mapp gas solenoid. Once these items are completed, we will have a working prototype. We will first test our prototype with water to ensure that our apparatus is sealed properly. If the water test is a success then by mid March, we plan on testing our prototype with NIFC using the actual gelled fuel. The exact date is unknown at this time due to weather conditions and NIFC’s schedule. Once we have the form of our apparatus finalized, we also plan on having the entire apparatus powder coated Boise State blue and orange...|$|E
