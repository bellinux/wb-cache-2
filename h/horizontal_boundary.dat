40|$|Two-dimensional {{convective}} {{flows in}} shallow and tall cavities with adiabatic or conducting <b>horizontal</b> <b>boundaries</b> and driven by differential heating {{of the two}} vertical end walls, are studied numerically over a range of Rayleigh numbers and Prandtl numbers. As the Rayleigh number increases, nonlinearity first affects the flow structure in the turning regions near {{the ends of the}} cavity. These `end-zone problems' have been investigated by a combined computational and analytical approach. Numerical solutions are found using a DuFort-Frankel-Multigrid method, and appear to be in good agreement with theoretical predictions of a boundary-layer structure at high values of the Rayleigh number. For time-dependent shallow cavity flows, new theoretical solutions and numerical solutions are obtained by both analytical and computational methods. A numerical scheme for finding thermal convective flows in a finite laterally heated cavity is described in detail in Chapter 2. The end-zone problems for tall cavities with conducting and adiabatic <b>horizontal</b> <b>boundaries</b> are considered in Chapters 3 and 4 respectively. For shallow cavities, the end-zone problems for these two thermal boundary conditions are considered in Chapters 5 and 6.

In contrast to the ‘filling box ’ process of Baines and Turner [1], the convective circulation involves vertical dif-fusion in the interior and a stabilising buoyancy flux distributed over the <b>horizontal</b> <b>boundary.</b> The latter flux causes the density distribution to reach a steady state. Applied to the laboratory experiments of Mullarney et al.

40|$|In {{this work}} {{we discuss the}} impact of the new ICT techno-economic {{paradigm}} upon the vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>boundaries</b> of the firm and ask whether the change in the sources of competitive advantage has resulted in changes in the size distribution of firms and also in the degree of concentration of industries. Drawing both on firm-level and national statistical data we assess the evolution of the overall balances between the activities which are integrated within organizations and those which occur through market interactions. While the new paradigm entails ``revolutionary'' changes in the domain of technology, the modification in industrial structures has been somewhat more incremental. Certainly, the vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>boundaries</b> of firms have changed and together one is observing a turnover in the club of biggest world firms accounting also for a shift in the relative importance of industrial sectors. Nonetheless, we do not observe an abrupt fading of the Chandlerian multidivisional corporation in favour of smaller less-integrated firms.
