25|$|JG 300 had {{its origins}} in April 1943, when Major Hajo Herrmann, a {{decorated}} bomber pilot, advocated the use of single-seat day fighters as night fighters against the Royal Air Force (RAF) bomber offensive. He suggested that single seat fighters could operate in the bombers' <b>general</b> <b>target</b> area using the light of target indicators, massed searchlights and the fires {{on the ground to}} spot their targets. These operations were tested over Berlin during May and June 1943 and codenamed Wilde Sau.|$|E
2500|$|During {{and after}} the Xinhai Revolution, many groups that participated wanted their own pennant as the {{national}} flag. During the Wuchang Uprising, the military units of Wuchang wanted the nine-star flag with Taijitu. Others in competition included Lu Haodong's Blue Sky with a White Sun flag. Huang Xing favored a flag bearing the mythical [...] "well-field" [...] system of village agriculture. In the end, the assembly compromised: the national flag would be the banner of Five Races Under One Union. The Five Races Under One Union flag with horizontal stripes represented the five major nationalities of the republic. The red represented Han, the yellow represented Manchus, the blue for Mongols, the white for Muslims, and the black for Tibetans. Despite the <b>general</b> <b>target</b> of the uprisings to be the Manchus, Sun Yat-sen, Song Jiaoren and Huang Xing unanimously advocated racial integration {{to be carried out}} from the mainland to the frontiers.|$|E

2500|$|One common way of {{reconciling}} {{these two}} opposing forces {{is simply to}} exempt all gene and protein symbols from the glossing rule. This is certainly fast and easy to do, and in highly specialized journals, it is also justified because the entire target [...] has high subject matter expertise. (Experts are not confused {{by the presence of}} symbols (whether known or novel) and they know where to look them up online for further details if needed.) But for journals with broader and more <b>general</b> <b>target</b> readerships, this action leaves the readers without any explanatory annotation and can leave them wondering what the apparent-abbreviation stands for and why it was not explained. Therefore, a good alternative solution is simply to put either the official gene name or a suitable short description (gene alias/other designation) in parentheses after the first use of the official gene/protein symbol. This meets both the formal requirement (the presence of a gloss) and the functional requirement (helping the reader to know what the symbol refers to). The same guideline applies to shorthand names for sequence variations; AMA says, [...] "In general medical publications, textual explanations should accompany the shorthand terms at first mention." [...] Thus [...] "188del11" [...] is glossed as [...] "an 11-bp deletion at nucleotide 188." [...] This corollary rule (which forms an adjunct to the spell-everything-out rule) often also follows the [...] "abbreviation-leading" [...] style of expansion that is becoming more prevalent in recent years. Traditionally, the abbreviation always followed the fully expanded form in parentheses at first use. This is still the general rule. But for certain classes of abbreviations or acronyms (such as clinical trial acronyms [...] or standardized polychemotherapy regimens [...] ), this pattern may be reversed, because the short form is more widely used and the expansion is merely parenthetical to the discussion at hand. The same is true of gene/protein symbols.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} a {{resource}} allocation method {{for the better}} velocity estimation. Targets are divided into <b>general</b> <b>targets</b> and key targets according to different velocity accuracy requirements. Supposing that the system resources are relatively sufficient, the optimization object {{is to improve the}} estimation performance for key targets using all the remaining resources when <b>general</b> <b>targets</b> have met the given velocity estimation mean square error (MSE). In this paper, limited system resources and partial given performance requirements are considered. In this case, resource utilization and system performance can be improved together. To exploit system potential, a joint resource allocation problem including transmitter, receiver, transmitted power, and signal time, is studied in this work, and the corresponding optimization problem is solved by SOCP via convex relaxation. Finally, effectiveness of proposed method is verified by extensive simulations.|$|R

In this work, we improve the estimation performance for key target when maximizing the system resource utilization of <b>general</b> <b>targets.</b> We formulate the optimization problem to a three-step suboptimal method where each optimization problem {{is transformed into}} a SOCP form by convex relaxation.

50|$|In {{addition}} to ship-board target observations, rangekeepers could also take input from spotting aircraft or even manned balloons {{tethered to the}} own ship. These spotting platforms could be launched and recovered from large warships, like battleships.

After World War II, helicopters became available {{and the need to}} conduct the dangerous operations of launching and recovering spotting aircraft or balloons was eliminated (see Iowa-class battleship for a brief discussion).|$|E
50|$|In late October {{and early}} November 1944, {{a series of}} {{tactical}} raids were carried out as training exercises for the crews. On 27, 18 October B-29s attacked lightly defended Japanese installations on Truk. The submarine pens at Truk were the target, and four Superfortresses had to abort because of the usual engine problems, and combat formations were scrappy. The bombing results were mediocre, with only nine planes bombing the primary target {{and only a few}} bombs hitting it. The same two groups returned to Truk on 30 October with even fewer bombs landing on the target. The third try, on 2 November, was briefed as a radar bombing mission. Again the results were indifferent, with bombs scattered all over the <b>general</b> <b>target</b> area.|$|E

The arrows with the buckskin shield also symbolize Oklahoma's Indian heritage, (a depiction of a buckskin shield is found on the state flag of Oklahoma). The sunburst design, a favorite Indian symbol, alludes to the unit's mission to provide <b>general</b> <b>target</b> acquisition, survey and meteorological support to the artillery with a corps. The sixteen stylized rays symbolize the sixteen battle honors of some elements of the organization. The fleur-de-lis represents the unit's service in Europe, World War II.
