5|$|A {{second major}} cause of {{morbidity}} and mortality in the North Atlantic right whale is entanglement <b>in</b> <b>fishing</b> gear. Right whales ingest plankton with wide-open mouths, risking entanglement in any rope or net fixed in the water column. Rope wraps around their upper jaws, flippers and tails. Some are able to escape, but others remain tangled. Whales can be successfully disentangled, if observed and aided. In July 1997, the U.S. NOAA introduced the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan, which seeks to minimize whale entanglement <b>in</b> <b>fishing</b> gear and record large whale sightings in an attempt to estimate numbers and distribution.|$|E
5|$|Another study {{focusing}} on the Gulf of Mexico, using a mix of data from US pelagic longline surveys from the mid-1950s and observations from the late-1990s, estimated a decline in numbers in this location of 99.3% over this period. However, changes <b>in</b> <b>fishing</b> practices and data collection methods complicate estimates.|$|E

5|$|Both {{species are}} listed as {{vulnerable}} by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Anthropogenic threats include pollution, entanglement <b>in</b> <b>fishing</b> nets, and direct harvesting for their gill rakers for use in Chinese medicine. Their slow reproductive rate exacerbates these threats. They are protected in international waters by the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals, but are more vulnerable closer to shore. Areas where mantas congregate are popular with tourists. Only a few public aquariums are large enough to house them.|$|E
5|$|Globally, pelican {{populations are}} {{adversely}} affected by four main factors: declining supplies of fish through overfishing or water pollution, destruction of habitat, direct effects of human activity such as disturbance at nesting colonies, hunting and culling, entanglement <b>in</b> <b>fishing</b> lines and hooks, and lastly the presence of pollutants such as DDT and endrin. Most species' populations {{are more or less}} stable, although three are classified by the IUCN as being at risk. All species breed readily in zoos, which is potentially useful for conservation management.|$|E
5|$|In 2004 the {{government}} went before Moskowitz seeking summary judgement. The case turned {{on whether the}} KD II was a fishing vessel under the SFPA.

5|$|Loggerheads are {{considered}} {{an endangered species}} and are protected by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.

5|$|Sea snakes are {{generally}} reluctant to bite, {{and are usually}} considered to be mild-tempered, although variation is seen among species and individuals. Some species, such as P. platurus, which feed by simply gulping down their prey, {{are more likely to}} bite when provoked because they seem to use their venom more for defense. Others, such as Laticauda, use their venom for prey immobilization; these snakes are often handled without concern by local fishermen, who unravel and toss them back into the water barehanded when the snakes become entangled <b>in</b> <b>fishing</b> nets. Species reported as much more aggressive include Aipysurus laevis, Astrotia stokesii, Enhydrina schistosa, Enhydrina zweifeli, and Hydrophis ornatus.|$|E

40|$|In {{response}} to most stressors, fish will elicit a generalized physiological stress response, which involves the {{activation of the}} hypothalamic–pituitary–interrenal axis (HPI). As in other vertebrates, this generalized stress response comprises physiological responses that are common {{to a wide range}} of environmental, physical and biological stressors. Recently, several families of heat shock proteins (hsps) have been proposed as indicators of a generalized stress response at the cellular level. Recent findings that hsp levels, <b>in</b> various <b>fish</b> tissues, respond {{to a wide range of}} stressors have supported the use of these proteins as indicators of stressed states <b>in</b> <b>fish.</b> However, Summary the cellular stress response can vary, for example, according to tissue, hsp family and type of stressor. This brief overview of these responses <b>in</b> <b>fish</b> asks the question of whether changes in levels and families of hsps can be used as a suitable indicator of stressed states <b>in</b> <b>fish.</b> By casting this question in the context of the well-established generalized physiological stress response <b>in</b> <b>fish,</b> we argue that the use of hsps as indicators of stressed states <b>in</b> <b>fish</b> <b>in</b> general is premature...|$|R
