5|$|Reaching {{a length}} of at least , the Tasmanian {{numbfish}} has a trowel-shaped pectoral fin disc with a short, blunt snout and concave leading margins. The medium-sized eyes are followed by smaller, nearly circular spiracles with smooth rims. A pair of large electric organs are located {{on either side of}} the head. There is a curtain of skin between the nostrils with a three-lobed posterior margin. The narrow, highly protrusible mouth is encircled by a <b>deep</b> <b>groove.</b> The teeth are small and diamond-shaped with pointed tips; they are arranged with a quincunx pattern into bands, which remain exposed when the mouth is closed. There are five pairs of gill slits beneath the disc.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese sleeper ray has {{an almost}} {{circular}} pectoral fin disc wider than long. Two large, kidney-shaped electric organs are visible {{under the skin}} {{on either side of}} the head. The small, protruding eyes are immediately followed by larger spiracles with prominently raised, smooth rims. The nostrils are small and placed close together, and between them is a curtain of skin that overlaps the mouth. The protrusible mouth forms a short, transverse line and is surrounded by a <b>deep</b> <b>groove.</b> There are fewer than 25 tooth rows in each jaw, arranged into bands; the teeth are small with oval bases and pointed crowns. Five pairs of short gill slits are located on the underside of the disc.|$|E
5|$|The round ribbontail ray has a thick {{pectoral}} fin disc wider {{than it is}} long, with a smoothly rounded outer margin. The eyes are of medium size and are followed by larger spiracles. There is a short and broad curtain of skin between the oval nostrils, with a finely fringed trailing margin. The mouth is wide and curved, with faint furrows at the corners. There is a row of seven papillae on the floor, with the outermost pair smaller and set apart from the others. There are 37–46 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 39–45 tooth rows in the lower jaw. The teeth are small with a <b>deep</b> <b>groove</b> across the crown, and are arranged in a dense quincunx pattern into flattened surfaces.|$|E

5|$|According to Novas (1993), Herrerasaurus can be {{distinguished}} based on the following features: {{the presence of a}} premaxilla-maxilla fenestra, and the dorsal part of laterotemporal fenestra is less than a third as wide as the ventral part; the presence of a ridge on the lateral surface of the jugal bone, and a deeply incised supratemporal fossa that extends across the medial postorbital process; the subquadrate ventral squamosal process has a lateral depression, and the quadratojugal bone overlaps the posterodorsal quadrate face; the pterygoid process of the quadrate has an inturned, trough-shaped ventral margin, and the presence of a slender ribbed posterodorsal dentary process; the surangular bone has a forked anterior process for articulation with the posterodorsal dentary process; the humerus' internal tuberosity is proximally projected and separated from the humeral head by a <b>deep</b> <b>groove</b> (also present in coelophysoids); possesses enlarged hands, which are 60% {{of the size of the}} humerus+radius, and the humeral entepicondyle is ridge-like with anterior and posterior depressions; and the posterior border of the ilial peduncle forms a right angle with the dorsal border of the shaft on the ischium.|$|E
5|$|The puffadder shyshark is more slender {{than other}} shysharks, with a short, broad, dorsally {{flattened}} {{head and a}} narrowly rounded snout. The large, oval-shaped eyes have cat-like slit pupils, a simple nictitating membrane (a protective third eyelid), and a prominent ridge underneath. The nostrils are very large, {{with a pair of}} greatly expanded, triangular flaps of skin in front that are fused together and reach the mouth. There is a <b>deep</b> <b>groove</b> connecting the excurrent (outflow) opening of each nostril to the mouth, obscured by the nasal flaps. The mouth is short with furrows at the corners on both jaws. There are 26–30 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 27–33 tooth rows in the lower jaw. Tooth shape is sexually dimorphic: those of males are longer and three-pointed, while those of females are shorter and five-pointed. Unusually, the two halves of the lower jaw are connected by a special cartilage, which allows a more even distribution of teeth and may increase bite strength.|$|E
25|$|In the female, a <b>deep</b> <b>groove</b> forms {{around the}} phallus. The sides of it grow dorsalward as the labioscrotal folds, which {{ultimately}} form the labia majora in females. The labia minora, in contrast, arise by the continued {{growth of the}} lips of the groove on the under surface of the phallus; {{the remainder of the}} phallus forms the clitoral glans.|$|E

25|$|The skull was long, low, and curved so {{that both}} {{extremities}} {{were higher than}} the middle. The premaxilla bones that formed {{the end of the}} snout were enlarged to form a wide tip; there were at least four teeth in the right premaxilla and five in the left. The left maxilla (main tooth-bearing bone of the upper jaw) is more complete than the right, and had at least 29teeth. There was a <b>deep</b> <b>groove</b> along the midline of the nasals and the frontals; the frontals were fused into a single bone, as is seen in other adult mesoeucrocodylians. Unlike derived neosuchians, it had external antorbital fenestrae. Tykoski and colleagues subjected the skull to CT scanning, which revealed internal cavities and air passages, and showed that it had a double-walled secondary palate similar to that of true crocodylians, and similar pneumatic cavities as well.|$|E

25|$|These are {{medium to}} large flies of compact structure, with clear wings of complex venation. Antennae are highly {{characteristic}} with antennae consisting of several compact segments that {{lie in a}} <b>deep</b> <b>groove</b> between the eyes; the outermost segment of each antenna bears a feather like structure, the arista, which projects forwards. Species within Musca, Hydrotaea, and similar genera have mouthparts adapted for sponging nutritious liquids with their labellar lobes (see photograph of Calliphora mouthparts which also have this sponge structure). Some species of this type, such as Musca vestustissima (Australian bush-fly) also have, {{as part of this}} sponge structure, small teeth that can scrape at host's skin down to superficial capillaries to feed on blood. Cattle are a typical host for Musca and similar species of house-flies that are attracted to protein containing liquids at the eyes and nostrils of their hosts.|$|E

500|$|Passer predomesticus is {{a fossil}} {{passerine}} {{bird in the}} sparrow family Passeridae. First described in 1962, it is known from two premaxillary (upper jaw) bones found in a Middle Pleistocene layer of the Oumm-Qatafa cave in Palestine. The premaxillaries resemble those {{of the house and}} Spanish sparrows, but differ in having a <b>deep</b> <b>groove</b> instead of a crest on the lower side. Israeli palaeontologist Eitan Tchernov, who described the species, and others have considered it to be close to the ancestor of the house and Spanish sparrows, but molecular data point to an earlier origin of modern sparrow species. Occurring in a climate Tchernov described as similar to but rainier than that in Palestine today, it was considered by Tchernov as a [...] "wild" [...] ancestor of the modern sparrows which have a commensal association with humans, although its presence in Oumm-Qatafa cave may indicate that it was associated with humans.|$|E
500|$|The antlion larva has {{a robust}} [...] body, a very plump abdomen, and a thorax bearing {{three pairs of}} walking legs. The {{prothorax}} forms a slender mobile [...] "neck" [...] for the large, square, flattened head, which bears an enormous pair of sickle-like jaws with several sharp, hollow projections. The jaws are formed by the maxillae and mandibles; the mandibles each contain a <b>deep</b> <b>groove</b> over which the maxilla fits neatly, forming an enclosed canal for injecting venom to immobilise the victim, and enzymes to digest its soft parts. The larva is clad in forward-pointing bristles which help it to anchor itself and exert greater traction, enabling it to subdue prey considerably larger than itself. Antlion larvae are unusual among insects in lacking an anus. All the metabolic waste generated during the larval stage is stored; some is used to spin the silk for the cocoon {{and the rest is}} eventually voided as meconium {{at the end of its}} pupal stage.|$|E
500|$|The {{cerebrum}} is {{the largest}} {{part of the human}} brain, and is divided into nearly symmetrical left and right hemispheres by a <b>deep</b> <b>groove,</b> the longitudinal fissure. The outer part of the cerebrum is the cerebral cortex, made up of grey matter arranged in layers. It is [...] thick, and deeply folded to give a convoluted appearance. Beneath the cortex is the white matter of the brain. The largest part of the cerebral cortex is the neocortex, which has six neuronal layers. The rest of the cortex is of allocortex, which has three or four layers. The hemispheres are connected by five commissures that span the longitudinal fissure, the largest of these is the corpus callosum. The surface of the brain is folded into ridges (gyri) and grooves (sulci), many of which are named, usually according to their position, such as the frontal gyrus of the frontal lobe or the central sulcus separating the central regions of the hemispheres. There are many small variations in the secondary and tertiary folds.|$|E

40|$|To {{simulate}} food contact surfaces with pits or cracks, {{stainless steel}} plates with grooves (depths between 0. 2 and 5 mm) were constructed. These plates were artificially contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes in clean conditions, with organic soiling, or after 14 days of biofilm formation after which inactivation of the pathogen by Suma Tab D 4 (sodium dichloroisocyanurate, 240 and 300 mg/liter), Suma Bac D 10 (quaternary ammonium compound, 740 mg/liter), and bacteriophage suspension (Listex P 100) was determined. Both chemical disinfectants performed well in suspension tests and in clean carrier tests according to the European standard with a reduction of more than 5 and 4 log units, respectively, of Listeria cells after 5 min of contact time. However, for the plates with grooves, the reduction could not meet the standard requirement, although a higher reduction of L. monocytogenes was observed in the shallow grooves compared with the <b>deeper</b> <b>grooves.</b> Furthermore, presence of food residues and biofilm reduced {{the effect of the}} disinfectants especially in the <b>deep</b> <b>grooves,</b> which was dependent on type of food substrate. Bacteriophages showed the best antimicrobial effect compared with the chemical disinfectants (sodium dichloroisocyanurate and quaternary ammonium compound) in most cases in the shallow grooves, but not in the <b>deep</b> <b>grooves.</b> The chlorine based disinfectants were usually less effective than quaternary ammonium compound. The results clearly demonstrate that surfaces with grooves influenced the antimicrobial effect of the chemical disinfectants and bacteriophages because the pathogen is protected in the <b>deep</b> <b>grooves.</b> The use of bacteriophages to inactivate pathogens on surfaces could be helpful in limited cases; however, use of large quantities in practice may be costly and phage-resistant strains may develop...|$|R
