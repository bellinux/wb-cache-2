Although <b>interspousal</b> <b>tort</b> immunity has been eliminated as a doctrinal matter, it endures as a reality. Liability insurance is inseparable from tort liability and drives the tort litigation system in this {{as well as other}} contexts. The insurance family member exclusion and the insurance intentional acts exclusion operate together to ensure that <b>interspousal</b> <b>tort</b> claims such as domestic violence tort claims will not be brought. These are reasonably considered to be gender-specific harms and the exclusion of them from tort compensation is a failing of the existing torts system. The article, which ties torts and insurance to feminist theory, was written for a conference which asked participants to explore relational feminism as articulated by scholars such as Robin West and Mary Becker. A liberal feminist critique of family member exclusions, which forbid liability coverage of claims between family members, would claim that they are based on stereotyping about relationships and collusion between family members, and that they should be abolished. A relational feminist viewpoint, which posits that individuals value community and relationships above self-interest, might at first glance provide a justification for family member exclusions. But a broader relational feminist viewpoint might support broader loss-sharing across communities with a recognition that all policyholders should, as part of valuing community and relationships, help compensate through insurance premiums those injured by intentional torts of family members. Therefore, a relational feminist viewpoint might also support their abolition...|$|E
40|$|According to the {{conventional}} domestic violence narrative, judges historically have ignored or even shielded “wife beaters” {{as a result of}} the patriarchal prioritization of privacy in the home. This Article directly challenges that account. In the early twentieth century, judges regularly and enthusiastically protected female victims of domestic violence in the divorce and criminal contexts. As legal and economic developments appeared to threaten American manhood and traditional family structures, judges intervened in domestic violence matters as substitute patriarchs. They harshly condemned male perpetrators—sentencing men to fines, prison, and even the whipping post—for failing to conform to appropriate husbandly behavior, while rewarding wives who exhibited the traditional female traits of vulnerability and dependence. Based on the same gendered reasoning, judges trivialized or even ridiculed victims of “husband beating. ” Men who sought protection against physically abusive wives were deemed unmanly and undeserving of the legal remedies afforded to women. Although judges routinely addressed wife beating in divorce and criminal cases, they balked when women pursued a third type of legal action: <b>interspousal</b> <b>tort</b> suits. The most prominent example of this response is Thompson v. Thompson, 218 U. S. 611 (1910), in which the U. S. Supreme Court refused to allow a wife to sue her husband in tort for assaulting her. Judges distinguished tort actions from divorce and criminal suits because tort’s assertive legal posture and empowering remedy seemingly subverted established gender roles. In a world in which women appeared to be radically advancing in work and politics, male judges used the moral theater of their courtrooms to strongly and publicly address domestic violence but only in ways that reinforced gender and marital hierarchies...|$|E
40|$|Tort {{liability}} {{expanded in}} the twentieth century, a shift scholars generally attribute to the reorganization of tort law around the fault principle. In privileging compensation and deterrence, this reconfiguration ended various restrictions on liability, long viewed as arbitrary, including limits to the recovery for emotional harm and interspousal immunities. Tort and family law scholars alike portray the end of such immunities as a milestone for gender equality. Their elimination enables spouses and partners to secure compensation for emotional and physical abuse arising in intimate relationships. Yet, tort law is not operating in this way. On the contrary, by endorsing a family/ market distinction in private law, scholars have pushed intimate liability claims between spouses away from tort law and into family law. As a result, compensation for emotional harm is mostly actionable in tort when it occurs {{in the realm of}} the market rather than {{in the realm of the}} family. Today, intimate liability is left to the agendas of political reformers. Feminists on the left and social conservatives on the right are shaping the litigation on interspousal torts, but they have opposing political agendas. While feminists seek to create more gender equality and protect women both within and outside the marital bond, social conservatives seek to strengthen traditional family values by favoring married plaintiffs only. Both sets of reformers, however, care more about promoting their respective agendas than redressing the harm suffered by those who do not fit their stereotyped narratives. The current intimate liability regime has a class bias. Plaintiffs in upper-middle-class marriages can benefit from <b>interspousal</b> <b>tort</b> litigation, particularly during divorce proceedings, because they can pay for private liability insurance. Low- and middle-income married couples, who cannot afford such liability insurance, cannot bring these claims and instead are at the mercy of tort lawyers operating on contingency fees. Furthermore, unless litigation on emotional harm happens during the breakup of a marriage, it is almost impossible for non-married plaintiffs to recover damages. These include nonmarried partners, cohabitants, and same-sex couples. To overhaul such unequal outcomes, this paper suggests departing from a market/ family dichotomy in tort law. It advocates reconceptualizing intimate liability as a stand-alone tort remedy in order to deter abusive emotional behavior enabled by relationships in which economic and emotional dependency are deeply intertwined...|$|E
40|$|Some {{fear that}} {{requiring}} litigation of <b>interspousal</b> <b>torts</b> in a divorce action may undermine the policy premises of no-fault divorce. Fear of res judicata may encourage divorce litigants to scrape the 2 ̆ 2 {{bottom of the}} barrel 2 ̆ 2 and assert every conceivable tort claim that arose during the marriage. Divorce litigation will thus become more bitter and hostile than it already is. Others fear that divorce litigation will become unmanageable as tort claims and third parties are added to joined tort/divorce litigation. The thesis {{of this article is}} that, despite these concerns, as a general rule, spouses should be required to litigate tort claims against each other that arose during the marriage relationship in the divorce action, or lose them. This proposed rule flows from the general thrust of both modern procedural and divorce reform, which encourage resolution of all grievances between a divorcing couple in a single proceeding. While claims for tort and divorce serve different social purposes, the facts establishing both claims and relief the plaintiff receives are inextricably intertwined. Modern rules of procedure generally compel parties to join such interconnected claims. The problems that the opponents of mandatory joinder foresee can be solved in a modern procedural system; careful judicial administration can prevent loss of jury trial rights and inequitable application or undue complication of the divorce action. Modern courts are capable of dealing with claims based on different legal theories arising out of a single factual base in one litigation...|$|R
