25|$|Among the 5 million, 771,844 were {{military}} casualties {{killed in}} action and other causes. The military only covers 15% of the total casualties. The main question <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> 85% (spread over all millets) of the casualties, which is more {{but not less than}} 4,000,000. Ottoman statistics analyzed by Turkish Kamer Kasim (Manchester University, Ph.D.), claims that cumulative percentage was 26.9% (higher than 25% reported by western sources) of the population, which this size stands out among the countries that took part in World War I. To understand the size of the issue, Kamer Kasım's %1.9 increase on the totals adds 399,000 civilians to the total number, which has not been reported in western sources.|$|E
500|$|At the burnings of Isabella Condon in 1779 and Phoebe Harris in 1786, the sheriffs present {{inflated}} their expenses; in {{the opinion}} of Simon Devereaux they were probably dismayed at being forced to attend such spectacles. [...] Harris's fate prompted William Wilberforce to sponsor a bill which if passed would have abolished the practice, but as one of its proposals would have allowed the anatomical dissection of criminals other than murderers, the House of Lords rejected it. [...] The burning in 1789 of Catherine Murphy, a counterfeiter, was impugned in Parliament by Sir Benjamin Hammett. [...] He called it one of [...] "the savage remains of Norman policy" [...] and amidst a growing tide of public disgust at the burning of women, Parliament passed the Treason Act 1790, which for women guilty of treason substituted hanging for burning. [...] It was followed by the Treason Act 1814, introduced by Samuel Romilly, a legal reformer. [...] Influenced by his friend, Jeremy Bentham, Romilly had long argued that punitive laws should serve to reform criminal behaviour and that far from acting as a deterrent, the severity of England's laws was responsible for an increase in crime. [...] When appointed the MP for Queensborough in 1806 he resolved to improve what he described as [...] "Our sanguinary and barbarous penal code, written in blood". He managed to repeal the death penalty for certain thefts and vagrancy, and in 1814 proposed to change the sentence for men guilty of treason to being hanged until dead and the body left at the king's disposal. [...] However, when it was pointed out {{that this would be a}} less severe punishment than that given for murder, he agreed that the corpse should also be decollated, [...] "as a fit punishment and appropriate stigma." [...] This <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> Jeremiah Brandreth, leader of a 100-strong contingent of men in the Pentrich rising and one of three men executed in 1817 at Derby Gaol. [...] As with Edward Despard and his confederates the three were drawn to the scaffold on sledges before being hanged for about an hour, and then on the insistence of the Prince Regent were beheaded with an axe. [...] The local miner appointed to the task of beheading them was inexperienced though, and having failed with the first two blows, completed his job with a knife. [...] As he held the first head up and made the customary announcement, the crowd reacted with horror and fled. [...] A different reaction was seen in 1820, when amidst more social unrest five men involved in the Cato Street Conspiracy were hanged and beheaded at Newgate Prison. [...] Although the beheading was performed by a surgeon, following the usual proclamation the crowd was angry enough to force the executioners to find safety behind the prison walls. [...] The plot was the last [...] crime for which the sentence was applied.|$|E

My books were written many years before the Harry Potter books (Charmed Life was first published in 1977), so any similarities probably come from what she herself read as a child.

2500|$|The {{officers}} {{serving in}} the Irish regiments in the French army were the other Irish community of significance that sought the services of the Irish colleges. General Count Daniel O’Connell and Charles Edward Jennings de Kilmaine, later General Kilmaine, were among the many officers for whom the Irish college issued certificates. [...] “Many {{of the students who}} entered the Irish college at a tender age did not persevere to the priesthood and some opted for a military career,” Swords continues. [...] Presumably this <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> James Blackwell as in 1784 he subsequently joined the Esterhazy regiment of Hussars in the French army, becoming, at the same time, a naturalized citizen of his adopted country, a fact that undoubtedly saved his life later on. He remained with this regiment until it was finally disbanded in 1791.|$|E
2500|$|McTaggart remarked, [...] "If {{somebody}} takes a {{third of}} somebody's book, which <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> me, they are lifting out the heart and guts of somebody else's individual expression." [...] Goodwin had previously reached a [...] "private settlement" [...] with McTaggart over the issue. In an article she wrote for Time magazine, she said, [...] "Though my footnotes repeatedly cited Ms. McTaggart's work, I failed to provide quotation marks for phrases that I had taken verbatim... The larger question {{for those of us}} who write history is to understand how citation mistakes can happen." [...] In its analysis of the controversy, Slate criticized Goodwin for the aggrieved tone of her explanation, and suggested Goodwin's worst offense was allowing the plagiarism to remain in future editions of the book even after it was brought to her attention.|$|E

60|$|But {{it appears}} that New Jersey was not yet {{sufficiently}} discovered, and after having been left {{for a long time}} in the possession of its true owners, the Lenni-Lenape, it was again visited by Europeans. In 1609 the celebrated Henry Hudson, then in the service of the Dutch East India Company, started westward to try to find a northwest passage to China. In those bygone days, whenever a European explorer set out to find an easy passage to the East, he was very apt to discover New Jersey; and this <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> Henry Hudson.

60|$|This <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> these buccaneers {{who would}} not give up a piratical life; driven away from Jamaica, from San Domingo, and even from Tortuga, they {{retained}} a resting-place only at New Providence, {{an island in the}} Bahamas, and this they did not maintain very long. Then they spread themselves all over the watery world. They were no longer buccaneers, they were no longer brothers of any sort or kind, they no longer set out merely to pillage and fight the Spaniards, but their attacks were made upon people of every nation. English ships and French ships, once safe from them, were a welcome prey to these new pirates, unrestrained by any kind of loyalty, even by any kind of enmity. They were more rapacious, they were more cruel, they were more like fiends than they had ever been before. They were cowardly and they no longer proceeded against towns which might be defended, nor ran up alongside of a man-of-war to boldly board her in the very teeth of her guns. They confined themselves to attacks upon peaceable merchant vessels, often robbing them and then scuttling them, delighted with the spectacle of a ship, with all its crew, sinking hopelessly into the sea.|$|E
