25|$|Doug Walters {{went to the}} wicket when Australia's total {{stood at}} 4/192 just before tea and played his shots to such telling effect that, by the time stumps arrived, he had scored 103...He opened the dressing-room door, expecting a flood of {{congratulations}} from his fellow players on the brilliance of his stroke play. His team mates, however, had anticipated Walters' expectations and were hidden in the shower room. Ian Chappell, the Aussie skipper, {{was alone in the}} room, hunched over a newspaper crossword. Chappell looked up as Walters entered, well ahead of his fellow batsmen. 'What {{the hell are you doing}} back here? <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> to get out tonight'...|$|E
500|$|Irataba {{was away}} at Fort Yuma during {{the attack on}} the settlers, and upon hearing of it he scolded the Mohave. Chooksa homar participated in the events and {{reported}} that Irataba told the warriors, [...] "I hear you fought, though <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> to. And you will have war again: I know it. You used to fight the Maricopa. I want to go [...] to see the Maricopa and tell them: 'The Mohave will not come any more to attack you'." [...] Irataba, weary of the constant fighting and worried that further conflicts with neighboring tribes would draw more attention from the US soldiers, organized a peace expedition to the Maricopa, settling the ancient disputes between the two peoples.|$|E
2500|$|Later that night, Amahl's mother weeps, {{praying that}} Amahl {{not become a}} beggar ("Don't Cry Mother Dear"). After bedtime ("From Far Away We Come"), {{there is a knock}} at the door and the mother tells Amahl to go see who it is ("Amahl ... Yes Mother!"). He is amazed when he sees three splendidly dressed kings (the Magi). At first the mother does not believe Amahl, but when she goes to the door to see for herself, she is stunned. The Three Kings tell the mother and Amahl they are on a long journey to give gifts to a wondrous Child and they would like to rest at their house, to which the mother agrees ("Good Evening!"; [...] "Come In!"), saying that all she can offer is [...] "a cold {{fireplace}} and a bed of straw". The mother goes to fetch firewood, and Amahl seizes the opportunity to speak with the kings. King Balthazar answers Amahl's questions about his life as a king and asks what Amahl does. Amahl responds that he was once a shepherd, but his mother had to sell his sheep. Now, he and his mother will have to go begging. Amahl then talks with King Kaspar, who is childlike, eccentric, and a bit deaf. Kaspar shows Amahl his box of magic stones, beads, and licorice, and offers Amahl some of the candy ("Are You A Real King?"; [...] "This is My Box"). The mother returns ("Amahl, <b>I</b> <b>Told</b> <b>You</b> <b>Not</b> To Be A Nuisance!"). He defends himself, saying [...] "They kept asking me questions," [...] when of course it has in fact been Amahl asking the kings questions. Amahl is told to go fetch the neighbors ("All These Beautiful Things"; [...] "Have You Seen a Child?") so the kings may be fed and entertained properly ("Shepherds! Shepherds!"; [...] "Emily! Emily"; [...] "Olives and Quinces"; [...] "Dance of the Shepherds").|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] cried Andre-Louis, with a grimace. [...] "You hurt me, monsieur. <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> to push against me." [...] He {{raised his}} voice that all might hear him, and once more impelled M. de Chabrillane back into the rain.|$|R
60|$|I said I'd do my best, didn't I? And <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> to worry.|$|E
60|$|RUDOLPH: Second halfcrown waste money today. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> go with drunken goy ever. So {{you catch}} no money.|$|E

60|$|Aldo. Look you now, son Woodall, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> was <b>not</b> mistaken; my rascal's in town, with {{a vengeance}} to him.|$|R
60|$|CLEOPATRA (cutting {{her short}} despotically). Have <b>I</b> <b>not</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> to deny things?

6000|$|... "I {{want you}} to {{understand}} that you cannot come back here. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> did <b>not</b> wish to sell you a pistol, and that ought to be enough." ...|$|R
60|$|MINNIE. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> {{to worry}} about me and George. I ran away from him once--I guess I won't {{have to do it}} again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Violets! Oh, and spring! Daren, it {{was good}} of you to gather them for me. I remember.... But <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> to come again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I believe,' she said, 'I {{was rude}} just now when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> to talk. I am sorry for it; I shall know better next time.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My young friend," [...] Wrayson said, [...] "I {{may just}} as well warn you that I think {{you are going to}} be disappointed. I am almost certain that I know the {{contents}} of that packet. You will find that it consists, as <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> before, <b>not</b> of securities at all, but simply a few old letters." ...|$|R
6000|$|Presently, when I {{had marked}} a Prayer Book for him, he said, [...] "And may I ask that the--the craving <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> of may <b>not</b> come on so intolerably?" ...|$|R

60|$|SIR HOWARD (drily). <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>you</b> were <b>not</b> in {{a strong}} position, Captain Brassbound. (Looking implacably at him.) You are laid by the heels, my friend, as I said you would be.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, as <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> he was <b>not</b> at {{the place}} of meeting,' De Stancy replied. And taking from his pocket the bag of ready money he placed it intact upon the table.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, I had rather cheat the hangman. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> those doctors {{yesterday}} {{that they were}} giving themselves and {{me a great deal}} of useless trouble. The villains, as <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> could <b>not</b> believe we should not betray them, and meant to make an end of us all. It's best as it is. My poor faithful Hans would never have had another happy moment." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "All {{this sort}} of talk," [...] cried the barber, still unmollified, [...] "is, as <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> once before, <b>not</b> in my line. In a few minutes I shall shut up this shop. Will you be shaved?" ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{stopped for}} a moment, and then she said: [...] "You know <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>you</b> should <b>not</b> call me Kate, being so much younger; but, as you are so much younger, you may kiss me if you like." ...|$|R
