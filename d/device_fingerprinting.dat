25|$|<b>Device</b> <b>fingerprinting</b> is {{a fairly}} new {{technology}} that is useful in fraud prevention and safeguarding any information from one's computer. <b>Device</b> <b>fingerprinting</b> uses data from the device and browser sessions to determine the risk of conducting business with the person using the device. This technology allows companies to better assess the risks when business is conducted through sites that include, e-commerce sites, social networking and online dating sites and banks and other financial institutions. ThreatMetrix {{is one of the}} leading vendors of <b>device</b> <b>fingerprinting.</b> This company employs a number of techniques to prevent fraud. For example, ThreatMetrix will pierce the proxy to determine the true location of a device. Due to the growing number of hackers and fraudsters using 'botnets' of millions of computers that are being unknowingly controlled, this technology will help not only the companies at risk but the people who are unaware their computers are being used.|$|E
25|$|Sentinel Advanced Detection Analysis and Predator Tracking (A.D.A.P.T.) is <b>device</b> <b>fingerprinting</b> {{software}} technology that identifies the device (computer, tablet, smartphone, …) {{being used to}} access a website. This information in turn {{can be used to}} help differentiate legitimate users from those using false identities or those attempting to work anonymously. A.D.A.P.T. uses only HTTP and JavaScript to identify a device and identifies devices without requesting any personal information entered directly by the user. It makes an accurate “fingerprint” of the device by using many different pieces of information including, operating system, browser, and PC characteristics. A.D.A.P.T. is concealed in that the user of the device has no idea that the device is being “fingerprinted” and there is no actual tagging of the device.|$|E

50|$|Online venues {{may be more}} {{vulnerable}} to certain types of fraud, especially collusion between players.

Online poker rooms also check players' IP addresses in order to prevent players at the same household or at known open proxy servers from playing on the same tables. Digital <b>device</b> <b>fingerprinting</b> also allows poker sites to recognize and block players who create new accounts in attempts to circumvent prior account bans, restrictions and closures.|$|E
40|$|Device {{specific}} power consumption information {{leads to a}} high potential for energy savings. Smart meters are currently deployed in several countries, but they are only able to track the overall consumption in domestic and commercial buildings. One promising option to gain device specific information is called Nonintrusive Load Monitoring (NILM), which can be of great use in combination with smart metering. In NILM, device specific information is achieved by disaggregating the overall load profile from a single-point measurement using <b>device</b> <b>fingerprints</b> and machine learning techniques. In this paper we focus on unsupervised learning methods to minimize the learning phase of <b>device</b> <b>fingerprints.</b> To increase the algorithm accuracy a range of several electrical features are taken into account.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Each {{digital camera}} has an {{intrinsic}} fingerprint that {{is unique to}} each camera. This <b>device</b> <b>fingerprint</b> can be extracted from an image, and {{can be compared to}} a reference <b>device</b> <b>fingerprint</b> to determine the device origin. The complexity of the filters proposed to accomplish this is increasing. In this note, we use a relatively simple algorithm to extract the sensor noise from images. It has the advantages of being easy to implement and parallelize, and working faster than the wavelet filter that is common for this application. In addition, we compare the performance with a simple median filter, and whether a previously proposed fingerprint enhancement technique improves results. Experiments are performed on approximately 7500 images originating from 69 cameras, and the results are compared with this often used wavelet filter. Despite the simplicity of the proposed method, the performance exceeds the common wavelet filter, and reduces the time needed for the extraction.
