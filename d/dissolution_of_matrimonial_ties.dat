60|$|Among {{the other}} means of luxury and {{pleasure}} which Smerdis found in the royal palaces, and which he appropriated to his own enjoyment, were Cambyses's wives. In those times, Oriental princes and potentates--as is, in fact, the case at the present day, in many Oriental countries--possessed {{a great number of}} wives, who were bound to them by different sorts <b>of</b> <b>matrimonial</b> <b>ties,</b> more or less permanent, and bringing them into relations more or less intimate with their husband and sovereign. These wives were in many respects in the condition of slaves: in one particular they were especially so, namely, that on the death of a sovereign they descended, like any other property, to the heir, who added as many of them as he pleased to his own seraglio. Until this was done, the unfortunate women were shut up in close seclusion on the death of their lord, like mourners who retire from the world when suffering any great and severe bereavement.|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} article {{mechanisms}} of penetration of persons of clergy origin into the elite of Russian Empire in XVIII - ﬁ rst quarter of XIX century is to be analysed. The term «elite» means the military and state «generals», which achieved 1 - 5 ranks under the Table of Ranks. We found an extremely {{small number of people}} of clergy origin among the elite of Russian Empire. What hindered the advancement of clergy? The author proposes that the signiﬁcance of the Table of Ranks and of the system of promotion in rank as a social elevator for persons of not-noble origin was overpriced, and also highlights the inertia of pre-Petrine localism. The system <b>of</b> <b>matrimonial</b> <b>ties</b> and <b>of</b> patronage to relatives backed by the economic power based on large land ownership allowed boyar aristocracy get a strong position and high ranks among the new elite during the reforms of Peter the Great. Therefore it was quite diﬃcult for people of clergy and else not-noble origin to achieve high ranks. In addition the Church administration cared about its own personnel and resisted moving of talented seminarists to the civil service. The analysis of the data shows that patronage was one of the decisive factors of vertical social mobility for persons of clergy origin. Many former seminarists entered the civil service, but three cases of seven mentioned in the article are connected with military service. Everyone was under patronage of a powerful authority, often serving as an aide-decamp or a secretary. There were two barriers: the rejection of aristocracy to the priests’ sons and the corporatism of Church administration and education and in general the closedness of clergy of the Synodal perio...|$|R

I will specifically try to analyse the conciliation difficulties between what is stipulated in each relevant field after the death of one of the spouses. The surviving spouse’s situation often depends on the simultaneous effect <b>of</b> the <b>matrimonial</b> property regime and also of Succession Law. In fact, this study deals with a classical problem of PIL which has been subject to recent innovative interpretations and has acquired a new importance.

40|$|The {{system of}} joint {{property}} reveals, apart of positive features, several vices as well. These are particularly conspicious in {{the aspect of}} managing joint property and spouses' liability for debts. Complications can appear especially in those situations when family owned producing firms {{are a part of}} joint property. If one can nevertheless adopt a possibly wide understanding of acts of ordinary management of joint property, then family owned producing firms can efficiently operate within joint property of a normally functioning family. The system enables the spouses to use profits derived from such firms already in the time of joint property existence. Only in case of the most important acts as alienation, burdening and several others the cooperation of spouses must be required. In absence of consent for management between spouses, the spouse whose rights in joined property are being injured can demand a protection provided by law. Yet the spouse devoid of appropriate qualifications or a trade license is not competent to demand a court ruling depriving the second spouse of management rights in joint property (art. 40 of Family and Guardianship Gode F. G. C.). He can only demand to have the spouse obliged to divide profits derived from running a family owned producing firm, and also in case of damage incurred by acts of the spouse, to have him redress ithe damage, on the grounds of art. 415 of Givi] Code (C. C.). If those measures prove to be not adequate, the spouse can demand, in the last resort, a judicial <b>dissolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>matrimonial</b> property community (art. 52 F,G. C).

60|$|A volume {{might be}} filled with stories of the strange and {{exciting}} incidents {{that grew out of}} this pretended popish plot. Its consequences extended disastrously through many years, and involved a vast number of innocent persons in irretrievable ruin. The true character of Oates and his accomplices was, however, at length fully proved, and they themselves suffered the fate at last which they had brought upon others. The whole affair was a disgrace to the age. There is no circumstance connected with it which can be looked upon with any pleasure except King Charles's fidelity to his injured wife in refusing to abandon her, though he no longer loved her. His defense of her innocence, involving, as it did, a continuance <b>of</b> the <b>matrimonial</b> <b>tie,</b> which bound them together when all the world supposed that he wished it sundered, seems to have resulted from a conscientious sense of duty, and implies certain latent traits of generosity and nobleness in Charles's character, which, though ordinarily overpowered and nullified by the influences of folly and vice, still always seem to have maintained their hold, and to come out to view from time to time, {{in the course of the}} gay monarch's life, whenever any emergency occurred sufficient to call them into action.|$|R

40|$|El trabajo muestra la evolución de la trama política general, española mediante el análisis en una zona concreta de la Región de Murcia en el período 1891 - 1910. La primera parte indaga en la estructura de la propiedad presentando a los grupos sociales. La segunda parte atiende expresamente a la política, mostrando la relación entre la dinámica de los poderes locales y del estado a través de la organización de las elecciones. La tesis demuestra que en el período estudiado no se produce ni una sola elección libre y democrática. Finalmente expone información sobre las revueltas sociales que se produjeron y la contundente represión en una aparente contradicción entre actitudes de paternalismo y de violencia, las dos caras definitorias del sistema caciquil. The {{study is}} centred upon the small boroughs which formed three {{separately}} named districts, {{in the period}} 1891 - 1910, and which formed societies of a rural charachter, {{in the midst of}} the general transformation towards capitalistic norms. These district were characterised by the unequal distribution of property, - concentrated in few hands: - those of the descendants of the established oligarchy, and those of a reduced number of merchants and landowners, these latter two grown richer by the forming <b>of</b> <b>matrimonial</b> <b>ties</b> with the former. Only between a quarter and a half of the individuals who comprised these rural-societes had access to the ownership ofland. The rest was made up of tenant- farmers, casual-workers, and the poor. All undergoing a new breed of property, that property associated with work, - a 'structural-proverty'; into which this study has attempted to penetrate. The division has been found to have been underlined, due to the inexistence of associations capable of representing collective interests, - the first of such movements oniy appeared during this same periodo it was within this context that universal-suffrage for men first appeared, which, in the three districts studied was so denaturalised as not to have produced a single democratic election whose voting resulted in its electors being representad by any freely- appointed parliamentarian. This being so, it has been necessary to investigase the totality of electoral resuits and returns of the three main groups, Conservative, Liberal, and Republican. In order to be able to exert such control over the popular vote, it was essential for the grand-propietors to create social-restrictions, managed by the local, party-bosses, who embodied the oligarchic sectors of the societies and who, via paternalistic measures, administered a goverment of authoritarian, repressive, charachter whose essence was the domination of local-counciis, and channels of communication with the word outside...|$|R

And the {{difference}} began {{of course in}} her being addressed, even by Maisie, from that day and by her particular request, as Mrs. Beale. It was there indeed principally that it ended, for except that the child could reflect that she should presently have four parents in all, and also {{that at the end}} of three months the staircase, for a little girl hanging over banisters, sent up the deepening rustle of more elaborate advances, everything made the same impression as before. Mrs. Beale had very pretty frocks, but Miss Overmore's had been quite as good, and if papa was much fonder of his second wife than he had been of his first Maisie had foreseen that fondness, had followed its development almost as closely as the person more directly involved. There was little indeed in the commerce of her companions that her precocious experience couldn't explain, for if they struck her as after all rather deficient in that air of the honeymoon of which she had so often heard--in much detail, for instance, from Mrs. Wix--it was natural to judge the circumstance in the light of papa's proved disposition to contest the empire <b>of</b> the <b>matrimonial</b> <b>tie.</b> His honeymoon, when he came back from Brighton--not on the morrow of Mrs. Wix's visit, and not, oddly, till several days later--his honeymoon was perhaps perceptibly tinged with the dawn of a later stage of wedlock. There were things dislike of which, as the child knew it, wouldn't matter to Mrs. Beale now, and their number increased so that such a trifle as his hostility to the photograph of Sir Claude quite dropped out of view. This pleasing object found a conspicuous place in the schoolroom, which in truth Mr. Farange seldom entered and in which silent admiration formed, during the time I speak of, almost the sole scholastic exercise of Mrs. Beale's pupil.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} my final thesis "Matrimonial {{property}} {{in the context of}} inheritance proceedings" is to analyse law dealings with settlements <b>of</b> <b>matrimonial</b> property and its application in inheritance proceedings. I emphasize problems caused by a lack of interconnection between the legislation <b>of</b> <b>matrimonial</b> property and the law of succession where I focus on both the substantial as well as procedural law. Furthermore, I discuss a tension between two principles - free will and protection of a surviving spouse - which emerges during the settlements <b>of</b> <b>matrimonial</b> {{property in the}} inheritance proceedings and which is apparent from the amount of rights given to the surviving spouse under the law of succession. Additionally, I compare the Czech legislation in this matter to the English law, even though England belongs to different legal culture where the concept <b>of</b> <b>matrimonial</b> property has not been fully introduced yet. However, considering the need for adjusting the Czech legislation <b>of</b> <b>matrimonial</b> property to the law of succession, I suggest that the protection which is given to the surviving spouse under English law might be inspiring for the Czech legislator...|$|R

40|$|The Hindu Marriage Act of 1955, besides {{providing}} {{for the first time}} in India statutory divorce as a matrimonial remedy for all Hindus (section 13), officially recognised customary divorce as well (section 29 (2)), consequently offering both possibilities to those couples willing to end their <b>matrimonial</b> <b>tie.</b> Interestingly enough, the directions of development of these two institutions have been until now almost opposite. The statutory divorce policy, which until the mid- 1980 s tended to facilitate <b>dissolution</b> <b>of</b> marriages, has since the 1990 s been replaced by careful consideration of the possible financial disadvantages of divorce, especially for women. An inverse trend has characterised the official treatment of customary divorce, which was at first strongly discouraged in the post-Independence period, and later from the 1990 s onwards, gradually encouraged especially in view of the multiple advantages of relying on the traditional family.
