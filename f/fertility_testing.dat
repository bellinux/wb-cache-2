40|$|Background: With {{improved}} cure {{rates of}} cancer in children and adolescents, {{the long-term effects of}} oncological treatment, including impaired fertility, have become an important clinical issue. Methods: In 2008, we conducted a nationwide survey in Germany in which we asked 4689 female and male patients who had been treated for cancer in childhood or adolescence for information on menstruation, previous <b>fertility</b> <b>testing</b> (if any), attempts to conceive, and pregnancies. In a complementary study carried out in 2009, 748 former cancer patients in Berlin were offered hormone testing and sperm analysis. The defined criteria for suspected infertil-ity were, in women, anti-muellerian hormone levels below 0. 1 ng/mL; in men, FSH levels above 10 IU/L and inhibin B levels below 80 pg/mL, or azoospermia. Results: The respondents to the nationwide survey included 1476 leukemia survivors and 1278 persons who had had a solid tumor. 104 former leukemia patients and 96 former solid tumor patients had already undergone <b>fertility</b> <b>testing,</b> leading to the suspicion of infertility in 26 % and 34 % of the persons in these respective groups (95 % confidence intervals [CI], 18 %‚Äì 34 % and 25 %‚Äì 43 %). The patients who were tested in the Berlin study included 59 leukemia survivors and 104 persons who had had a solid tumor. The frequency of suspected infertility in these two groups was 25 % and 27 %, respectively (95 % CI, 14 %‚Äì 36 % and 18 %‚Äì 36 %). Conclusion: Up to one-third of adults who undergo <b>fertility</b> <b>testing</b> after having been treated for cancer in childhood or adolescence have suspected infertility.

40|$|With {{advances}} in cancer treatment, more pediatric cancer patients {{have increased their}} life expectancy. Because cancer-related therapy causes various physical and psychological problems, many male survivors experience later problems with thyroid and sexual functions, and with growth.

Cancer and cancer-related treatment can impair fertility by damage to the testes, to the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, or to the genitourinary organs. Prior radiation therapy to the testes, the use of alkylating agents, and central hypogonadism further impair fertility in male survivors of childhood cancer.

40|$|Agri-environmental support {{included}} in the General Agri-Environmental Protection Scheme (GAEPS) is used to compensate the farmers {{for the loss of}} farm income and increased production costs due to the adaptation of more environmentally-friendly production practices. This study is an attempt to estimate and aggregate the costs of the GAEPS. The main costs at the farm level consist of investments to manure and silage storage, crop losses due to reduced use of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilisers, and landscape management. Other major sources of additional costs are the plant cover criterion, regular soil <b>fertility</b> <b>testing,</b> and nutrient analyses of manure. Filter strips, testing of pesticide sprayers, and making an environmental management plan for the farm are also cost-creating activities. According to the calculations, the total cost of the adaptation of the GAEPS are ca. FIM 850 million annually.

40|$|The rabbit is the {{smallest}} and least expensive laboratory animal in which serial semen samples can be obtained for morphologic, biochemical, and fertility evaluation. The female rabbit has a predictable reproductive cycle and can be artificially inseminated with a known amount of sperm during <b>fertility</b> <b>testing.</b> These advantages make the rabbit an extremely valuable model for studying the effects of chemicals or other stimuli on the male reproductive system. Quantitative evaluation of the testis, semen, and accessory reproductive organs is important in order to detect subtle effects of a chemical on reproductive capacity. Evaluation of testis size, serum hormone concentrations, and the number, morphology, motility, and fertility of sperm in the ejaculate can be performed serially in the live rabbit. Weights of testes and accessory reproductive organs, estimates of daily sperm production, and histomorphometric data on the seminiferous epithelium can be obtained after sacrifice. Multinucleated spermatids, focal tubular hypospermatogenesis, swelling of spermatocytes, and cytoplasmic vacuoles in Sertoli's cells occur commonly in testes of control rabbits.

40|$|Subsurface {{infiltration}} {{and surface}} bioretention systems composed of engineered and/or native soils are preferred tools for stormwater management. However, the disturbance of native soils, {{especially during the}} process of adding amendments to improve infiltration rates and pollutant removal, may result in releases of nutrients in the early life of these systems. This project investigated the nutrient release from two soils, one disturbed and one undisturbed. The disturbed soil was collected intact, but had to be air-dried, and the columns repacked when soil shrinkage caused bypassing of water along the walls of the column. The undisturbed soil was collected and used intact, with no repacking. The disturbed soil showed elevated releases of nitrogen and phosphorus compared to the undisturbed soil for approximately 0. 4 and 0. 8 [*]m of runoff loading, respectively. For the undisturbed soil, the nitrogen release was delayed, indicating that the soil disturbance accelerated the release of nitrogen into a very short time period.

40|$|AbstractThe microRNA miR- 29 {{is widely}} {{distributed}} and highly expressed in adult mouse brain during the mouse's lifetime. We recently created conditional mutant mice whose miR- 29 was brain-specifically knocked down through overexpression of an antisense RNA transgene against miR- 29. To explore {{a role for}} brain miR- 29 in maximizing organismal fitness, we assessed somatic growth, reproduction, and lifespan in the miR- 29 -knockdown (KD) mice and their wild-type (WT) littermates. The KD mice were developmentally indistinguishable from WT mice with respect to gross morphology and physical activity. <b>Fertility</b> <b>testing</b> revealed that KD males were subfertile, whereas KD females were hyperfertile, {{only in terms of}} reproductive success, when compared to their gender-matched WT correspondents. Another phenotypic difference between KD and WT animals appeared in their lifespan data; KD males displayed an overall increasing tendency in post-reproductive survival relative to WT males. In contrast, KD females were prone to shorter lifespans than WT females. These results clarify that brain-targeted miR- 29 knockdown affects both lifespan and reproduction in a gender-dependent manner, and moreover that the reciprocal responsiveness to the miR- 29 knockdown between these two phenotypes in both genders closely follow life-course models based on the classical trade-off prediction wherein elaborate early-life energetic investment in reproduction entails accelerated late-life declines in survival, and vice versa. Thus, this study identified miR- 29 as the first mammalian miRNA that is directly implicated in the lifetime trade-off between the two major fitness components, lifespan and reproduction...|$|E

Pretested structured questionnaire and focused group discussion were employed to generate data. All generated survey {{data were analyzed using}} descriptive statistics of SPSS 20. Broody hens were the only means of egg incubation and chick brooding. Broody hens were selected based primarily on body size, broody character, ability of defending predator and number of eggs laid from which broody character predominates the other parameters. Eggs laid at home were the predominant source of egg for incubation and selected mainly based on size, shape and season in which the egg is laid. A bamboo basket bedded with teff straw, a nest on the ground and a nest under bed were the common laying nest preparations. Farmers practiced to store eggs in either directly on the laying nest, in cold room and on the grain. The preferable season of allowing broody hen to hatch was from October to December because of better feed access, less predator and better chick survivability.

40|$|Currently, {{evaluation}} of sperm quality is primarily based on in-vitro measures of sperm function such as motility, viability and/or acrosome reaction. However, results are often poorly correlated with fertility, and alternative diagnostic tools are therefore needed both in veterinary and human medicine. In a recent pilot study, we demonstrated that MS profiles from intact chicken sperm using MALDI-TOF profiles could detect {{significant differences between}} fertile/subfertile spermatozoa showing that such profiles could be useful for in-vitro male <b>fertility</b> <b>testing.</b> In the present study, we performed larger standardized experimental procedures designed {{for the development of}} fertility- predictive mathematical models based on sperm cell MALDI-TOF MS profiles acquired through a fast, automated method. This intact cell MALDI-TOF MS-based method showed high diagnostic accuracy in identifying fertile/subfertile males in a large male population of known fertility from two distinct genetic lineages (meat and egg laying lines). We additionally identified 40 % of the m/z peaks observed in sperm MS profiles through a top-down high-resolution protein identification analysis. This revealed that the MALDI-TOF MS spectra obtained from intact sperm cells contained a large proportion of protein degradation products, many implicated in important functional pathways in sperm such as energy metabolism, structure and movement. Proteins identified by our predictive model included diverse and important functional classes providing new insights into sperm function as it relates to fertility differences in this experimental system. Thus, in addition to the chicken model system developed here, with the use of appropriate models these methods should effectively translate to other animal taxa where similar tests for fertility are warranted...|$|E

Based on these results, a new fertilizer management strategy was designed to meet varying soil fertility needs at the level of a cluster of villages by applying a full nutrient dose if > 50 percent fields were deficient and a half dose in the case of fields < 50 percent deficient. Improved nutrient management significantly increased crop productivity in groundnut (Arachis hypogaea) (17 ‚Äì 86 percent), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) (30 ‚Äì 55 percent), soybean (Glycine max) (10 ‚Äì 40 percent), and maize (Zea mays) (10 ‚Äì 50 percent) with favorable benefit-cost ratios (1. 43 ‚Äì 15. 2) over farmers‚Äô practice.
