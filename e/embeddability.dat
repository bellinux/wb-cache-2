2500|$|The {{theory of}} {{complexes}} of groups (see Haefliger, Corson Bridson-Haefliger) provides a higher-dimensional generalization of Bass–Serre theory. The {{notion of a}} graph of groups is replaced by that of a complex of groups, where groups are assigned to each cell in a simplicial complex, together with monomorphisms between these groups corresponding to face inclusions (these monomorphisms are required to satisfy certain compatibility conditions). One can then define an analog of the fundamental group of a graph of groups for a complex of groups. However, in order for this notion to have good algebraic properties (such as <b>embeddability</b> of the vertex groups in it) and {{in order for a}} good analog for the notion of the Bass–Serre covering tree to exist in this context, one needs to require some sort of [...] "non-positive curvature" [...] condition for the complex of groups in question (see, for example [...] ).|$|E

5000|$|The {{relation}} [...] "injects into" [...] is a preorder (that is, a reflexive and transitive relation), and [...] "be isomorphic" [...] is an equivalence relation. Also <b>embeddability</b> {{is usually}} a preorder, and similarity {{is usually a}}n equivalence relation (which is natural, but not provable {{in the absence of}} formal definitions). Generally, a preorder leads to an equivalence relation and a partial order between the corresponding equivalence classes. The Schröder-Bernstein property claims that the <b>embeddability</b> preorder (assuming that it is a preorder) leads to the similarity equivalence relation, and a partial order (not just preorder) between classes of similar objects.|$|E
50|$|A {{result of}} Joseph J. Kohn states that global <b>embeddability</b> is {{equivalent}} to the condition that the Kohn Laplacian have closed range. This condition of closed range is not a CR invariant condition.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the basic}} {{questions}} of CR Geometry is to ask when a smooth manifold endowed with an abstract CR structure can be realized as an embedded manifold in some [...] Thus {{not only are we}} embedding the manifold,but we also demand for global embedding that the map embedding the abstract manifold in [...] must pull back the induced CR structure of the embedded manifold( [...] coming {{from the fact that it}} sits in [...] ) so that the pull back CR structure exactly agrees with the abstract CR structure. Thus global embedding is a two part condition.Here the question splits into two. One can ask for local <b>embeddability</b> or global <b>embeddability.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{projective}} {{plane is}} a 2-dimensional projective space, {{but not all}} projective planes can be embedded in 3-dimensional projective spaces. Such <b>embeddability</b> {{is a consequence of}} a property known as Desargues' theorem, not shared by all projective planes.|$|E

5000|$|An {{important}} question is to characterize those semigroups for which this map is an embedding. This need not always be the case: for example, take S to be the semigroup of subsets of some set X with set-theoretic intersection as the binary operation (this {{is an example of}} a semilattice). Since A.A = A holds for all elements of S, this must be true for all generators of G(S) as well: which is therefore the trivial group. It is clearly necessary for <b>embeddability</b> that S have the cancellation property. When S is commutative this condition is also sufficient and the Grothendieck group of the semigroup provides a construction of the group of fractions. The problem for non-commutative semigroups can be traced to the first substantial paper on semigroups. [...] Anatoly Maltsev gave necessary and sufficient conditions for <b>embeddability</b> in 1937.|$|E
50|$|The Robertson-Seymour theorem {{proves that}} subcubic graphs (simple or not) are well-founded by homeomorphic <b>embeddability,</b> {{implying}} such a sequence cannot be infinite. So, for each value of k, {{there is a}} sequence with maximal length. The function SSCG(k) denotes that length for simple subcubic graphs. The function SCG(k) denotes that length for (general) subcubic graphs.|$|E
5000|$|For the <b>embeddability</b> of noncommutative semigroups in groups, cancellativity is {{obviously}} a necessary condition. However, it is not sufficient: there are (noncommutative and infinite) cancellative semigroups that cannot be embedded in a group.To obtain a sufficient (but not necessary) condition, it may be observed that the proof of the result that a finite cancellative semigroup S is a group critically depended {{on the fact that}} Sa = S for all a in S. The paper [...] generalized this idea and introduced the concept of a right reversible semigroup. A semigroup S is said to be right reversible if any two principal ideals of S intersect, that is, Sa ∩ Sb ≠ Ø for all a and b in S. The sufficient condition for the <b>embeddability</b> of semigroups in groups can now be stated as follows: (Ore's Theorem) Any right reversible cancellative semigroup can be embedded in a group, [...]|$|E
5000|$|In {{dimension}} 3, {{there are}} obstructions to global <b>embeddability.</b> By taking small perturbations {{of the standard}} CR structure on the three sphere [...] the resulting abstract CR structure one gets, fails to embed globally.

50|$|Since unitals are block designs, two unitals {{are said}} to be {{isomorphic}} if there is a design isomorphism between them, that is, a bijection between the point sets which maps blocks to blocks.

50|$|Though wqo is an {{appealing}} notion, many important infinitary operations do not preserve wqoness. An example due to Richard Rado illustrates this. In a 1965 paper Crispin Nash-Williams formulated the stronger notion of bqo {{in order to}} prove that the class of trees of height ω is wqo under the topological minor relation. Since then, many quasi-orders have been proven to be wqo by proving them to be bqo. For instance, Richard Laver established Fraïssé's conjecture by proving that the class of scattered linear order types is bqo. More recently, Carlos Martinez-Ranero has proven that, under the Proper Forcing Axiom, the class of Aronszajn lines is bqo under the <b>embeddability</b> relation.|$|E

50|$|In set theory, Hamkins has {{investigated}} the indestructibility phenomenon of large cardinals, proving that small forcing necessarily ruins the indestructibility of supercompact {{and other large}} cardinals and introducing the lottery preparation as a general method of forcing indestructibility. Hamkins introduced the modal logic of forcing and proved with Benedikt Löwe that if ZFC is consistent, then the ZFC-provably valid principles of forcing are exactly those in the modal theory known as S4.2. Hamkins, Linetsky and Reitz proved that every countable model of Gödel-Bernays set theory has a class forcing extension to a pointwise definable model, in which every set and class is definable without parameters. Hamkins and Reitz introduced the ground axiom, which asserts that the set-theoretic universe is not a forcing extension of any inner model by set forcing. Hamkins proved that any two countable models of set theory are comparable by <b>embeddability,</b> and in particular that every countable model of set theory embeds into its own constructible universe.|$|E
50|$|In {{dimension}} 3, a non-perturbative set {{of conditions}} that are CR invariant has been found by Sagun Chanillo, Hung-Lin Chiu and Paul C. Yang that guarantees global <b>embeddability</b> for abstract strongly pseudo-convex CR structures defined on compact manifolds. Under {{the hypothesis that the}} CR Paneitz Operator is non-negative and the CR Yamabe constant is positive, one has global embedding. The second condition can be weakened to a non-CR invariant condition by demanding the Webster curvature of the abstract manifold be bounded below by a positive constant. It allows the authors to get a sharp lower bound on the first positive eigenvalue of Kohn's Laplacian. The lower bound is the analog in CR Geometry of the Andre Lichnerowicz bound for the first positive eigenvalue of the Laplace-Beltrami operator for compact manifolds in Riemannian geometry. Non-negativity of the CR Paneitz operator in dimension 3 is a CR invariant condition as follows by the conformal covariant properties of the CR Paneitz operator on CR manifolds of real dimension 3, first observed by Kengo Hirachi. The CR version of the Paneitz operator, the so-called CR Paneitz Operator first appears in a work of C. Robin Graham and Jack Lee. The operator is not known to be conformally covariant in real dimension 5 and higher, but only in real dimension 3. It is always a non-negative operator in real dimension 5 and higher.|$|E
