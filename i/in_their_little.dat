500|$|Alexandra's first child, Albert Victor, {{was born}} two months {{premature}} in early 1864. Alexandra showed devotion to her children: [...] "She {{was in her}} glory when she could run up to the nursery, put on a flannel apron, wash the children herself and see them asleep <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>little</b> beds." [...] Albert Edward and Alexandra had six children in total: Albert Victor, George, Louise, Victoria, Maud, and John. All of Alexandra's children were apparently born prematurely; biographer Richard Hough thought Alexandra deliberately misled Queen Victoria as to her probable delivery dates, as {{she did not want}} the queen to be present at their births. During the birth of her third child in 1867, the added complication of a bout of rheumatic fever threatened Alexandra's life, and left her with a permanent limp.|$|E
500|$|The tale {{is set in}} {{a forest}} and begins with [...] "once upon a time". Timmy Tiptoes is [...] "a little fat {{comfortable}} grey squirrel" [...] living in a nest thatched with leaves in the top of a tall tree with his little wife, Goody. Over the course of several days, the two collect nuts <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>little</b> sacks for the coming winter and spring, and store the nuts in hollow tree stumps near their home. Timmy wears a red jacket he removes while working, and his wife wears a pink dress and apron. When the stumps are full, the couple make use of a tree-hole that once belonged to a woodpecker. The nuts rattle [...] "down [...] down [...] down inside", and Goody wonders how they will ever retrieve them. Timmy reminds her he will be much thinner by springtime and will be able to pass through the little hole.|$|E
500|$|Sharky Extreme praised FreeSpace 2 {{for having}} the {{enormous}} capital ships, as this burst the [...] "trapped in a bubble" [...] trend in Wing Commander- and - type games. Instead of the action simply coming to the player, it flows all around, and the player {{is the one who}} has to go and seek it. The scenes of these giant ships duking it out, with many gnat-like fighters swarming around <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>little</b> dances of death, have led reviewers to feel a sense of epicness, comparable to reliving battles in science fiction series like Babylon 5 and Star Wars. Similarly, PC Gamer praised the scaling of ships and battles and said that they [...] " [...] as close to creating the feeling of a World War II naval battle in space as any game has ever come" [...] and that [...] "That's what fighter combat, in space or on Earth, should be all about.".|$|E

2500|$|... "Ruth the Moabitess": In {{modern style}} one would not, in referring, {{at this stage}} of the narrative, to Ruth, deem it in the least degree {{necessary}} or advantageous to repeat the designation [...] "the Moabitess." [...] The repetition is antique, and calls to mind the redundant particularization of legal phraseology - [...] "the aforesaid Ruth, the Moabitess." [...] She was willing and wishful to avail herself of an Israelitish privilege accorded to the poor, the privilege of gleaning after the reapers in the harvest-fields (see Leviticus 19:9; Leviticus 23:22: Deuteronomy 24:19). Such gleaning was a humiliation to those who had been accustomed to give rather than to get. But Ruth saw, in the pinched features of her mother-in-law, that there was now a serious difficulty in keeping the wolf outside the door. And hence, although there would be temptation in the step, as well as humiliation, she resolved to avail herself of the harvest season to gather as large a store as possible of those nutritious cereals which form the staff of life, and which they would grind for themselves <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>little</b> handmill or quern. She said, with beautiful courtesy. [...] "Let me go I, pray, thee;" [...] or, [...] "I wish to go, if you will please to allow me." [...] Such is the force of the peculiar Hebrew idiom.|$|E
