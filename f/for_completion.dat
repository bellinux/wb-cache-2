5|$|Due to {{the project}} being split into two phases, it was decided for {{efficiency}} to design each phase as mirror image halves of one complete station with only the handful of items the whole site would share (like the flue stack and coal handling area) and so needed to be build in First Half, being the difference. This extended to seeking the same contractors and suppliers as worked on First Half <b>for</b> <b>Completion.</b> Unfortunately due to the decade timespan between comparable works on the 2 phases several manufacturers that had supplied First Half had merged or ceased trading, combined with changes in legislation, this meant numerous components and equipment ranges used for First Half were either no longer available <b>for</b> <b>Completion</b> or had significantly changed. Separately, operating experience over that timespan had led to design improvement in equipment and plant specified by the Board, leading to a few significant areas of the design of Completion being altered.|$|E
