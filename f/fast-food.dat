50|$|Nutripoints is {{a system}} for rating foods on a {{numerical}} scale for their overall nutritional value. The method {{is based on an}} analysis of 26 positive (such as vitamins, minerals, protein, fiber) and negative factors (such as cholesterol, saturated fat, sugar, sodium) compared to the calories in the food. The overall Nutripoint score of the food is the result. The higher the value, the more nutrition per calorie (nutrient density) and the least negative factors in the food. Thus, the higher the Nutripoint score, the better the food for overall health. The system rates 3600+ foods including basic foods like apples and oranges, <b>fast-foods,</b> and brand-name foods.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Recently, {{researchers}} have linked {{the availability and}} popularity of energy dense <b>fast-foods</b> to an increasingly obesogenic environment. Such availability has led to both over consumption and under nourishment, especially in lower income neighborhoods that fail to offer healthier alternatives. These “food deserts ” play their part in both the increasing trend of obesity and the climbing costs associated with treating obesity-related disorders. In order to address this issue, food environments could be engineered by employing creative zoning in at-risk areas. Zoning allows municipalities to support developments that promote health, safety, and public welfare; in this context, zoning law could be utilized to support healthy, and more affordable, lifestyles. However, there is currently a lack of both empirical and public support for such an intervention on any scale. These issues could be addressed through the utilization of convenient pilots {{and the formation of}} relationships with target communities, culminating in the implementation of small-scale designs and, ultimately, large-scale intervention studies. In doing so, a foundation may be built upon which the development of a legitimate, environmental design approach t...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} this Bachelor Thesis {{is to find}} out whether parents and their {{children}} prefer a healthy and balanced diet. At present, when everyone is in a hurry and tries to make everything easier, the results are that we devote little time and attention to our diet and lifestyle in general. The proportion of frozen ready-made meals and the number of <b>fast-foods</b> increases, and many people do not have enough time when at home to prepare fresh meals for themselves. I am inclined to believe that proper eating habits remain during the rest of one?s life. I was therefore interested in how children eat after leaving the nursery school facilities. Being assisted by their parents, I monitored a selected group of children, focusing on their diets in their respective families. Further, I analysed with the parents their opinions on the menu setup in the nursery school. I interviewed children in the nursery school in a form of playing about which meals they preferred and what the term ?healthy diet? meant for them. The thesis conclusion evaluates the children?s eating habits...|$|R
5000|$|Chelton Beach Provincial Park is {{a provincial}} park in Prince Edward Island, Canada. Located on the once farm of Louis Pearson of the {{aforementioned}} province, Chelton Beach is the chief tourism center {{of the community of}} Chelton. The surrounding area is heavily poulated with cottages of which most, if not all, are for seasonal use only. It is located approximately 15 minutes by car from the Confederation Bridge though quite far from any other metropolitan center. Despite this the beach is relatively well used, filling beyond its official boundaries on most warm days. As is usual in the region of the Seven Mile Bay, the region to which Chelton belongs, at low tide the beach's surface area increases notably due to the great amount of sand bars. The park itself is composed of two buildings, a shower/restroom facility and a canteen where <b>fast-foods</b> can be purchased. Until the early 2000s there was a large wooden jungle gym, a merry-go-round, a swing set, a see-saw, and a large slide, all dating from, at least, the 1970s. These structures were gradually torn down after being deemed unsafe by the province. The swing set and slide were replaced shortly after their predecessors's demolition.|$|R

40|$|Obesity is {{excessive}} {{body fat}} {{on a scale}} that adversely affects health. Childhood obesity is increasing world-wide and is an important risk factor for many chronic diseases. In order to explore the association between childhood obesity and putative risk factors among primary school girls, the present study was carried out. In this study, all the obese students (according to Iranian references) from a sample of 835 school girls aged 8 - 11 y were considered as the case group (n= 134). 134 control students with normal weight (5 th percentile < BMI &# 8804; 85 th Percentile) were chosen randomly and obese children were matched with non–obese children by age, school and classroom. For each subject, we interviewed the mother and filled 3 questionnaires covering potential risk factors for obesity. Results showed that obese children had significantly higher probability of having obese parents compared to controls. Daily energy and macronutrient intake and frequency of consuming fast foods and fizzy drinks were higher in the case group. Compared to normal children, obese ones spent more time in front of the TV or the computer non-obese children; the differences were statistically significant (P< 0. 05). The duration of daily physical activity, energy and macronutrient intake per kilogram body weight, and parental education were all significantly higher in the control group (P< 0. 05). Most obese girls were born in winter or autumn while non–obese girls were born mostly in spring and summer (P< 0. 015). Obesity is a multi-factorial syndrome involving genetic, environmental and behavioral alterations. In this study, daily energy and macronutrient intake, physical activity, parental education, season of birth, frequency for eating <b>fast-foods</b> and fizzy drinks and time spent watching T.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Dietary habits {{have been}} {{indicated}} by research as key elements in both disease pathogenesis and prevention and health promotion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed {{data collected from}} Italian university students regarding consumption of fruits, vegetables, <b>fast-foods,</b> sweets, energizing drinks, and coffee, average number of eating episodes per day and regularity of breakfast habits. RESULTS: 44 % of the university student population eats in average at least 1 portion of fruit per day. 22. 5 % eats at least 2 portions of vegetables per day. 8. 5 % eats in average 5 times per day with 48. 6 % declaring an average of 3 eating episodes per day. 11. 3 % consumes eccessive amounts of caffeine. 49. 1 % of the females reaches the recommended consumption of fruit, compared to only 33. 8 % of males (p < 0. 05). 27. 7 % of females eats at least 2 portions of vegetables per day, compared to 12. 0 % of males (p < 0. 05). Eccessive coffee drinkers pass from 8. 9 % in the 18 - 21 age group to 16 % in the 25 - 30 year old age group (p < 0. 05). DISCUSSION: This study showed that the eating habits of young adults do not follow national recommendations. Less than 50 % of university students eats at least 1 portion of fruit per day and less than 1 out of 4 eats at least 2 portions of vegetables per day.

40|$|International audienceAbstractBackgroundThe {{association}} between socioeconomic position and diet {{in early childhood}} has mainly been addressed based on maternal education and household income. We aimed to assess {{the influence of a}} variety of social factors from different socio-ecological levels (parents, household and child-care) on multi-time point dietary patterns identified from 2 to 5 y. MethodThis study included 974 children from the French EDEN mother-child cohort. Two multi-time point dietary patterns were derived in a previous study: they correspond to consistent exposures to either core- or non-core foods across 2, 3 and 5 y and were labelled “Guidelines” and “Processed, fast-foods”. The associations of various social factors collected during pregnancy (age, education level) or at 2 -y follow-up (mother’s single status, occupation, work commitments, household financial disadvantage, presence of older siblings and child-care arrangements) with each of the two dietary patterns, were assessed by multivariable linear regression analysis. ResultsThe adherence to a diet close to “Guidelines” was positively and independently associated with both maternal and paternal education levels. The adherence to a diet consistently composed of processed and <b>fast-foods</b> was essentially linked with maternal variables (younger age and lower education level), household financial disadvantage, the presence of older sibling (s) and being cared for at home by someone other than the mother. ConclusionsMultiple social factors operating at different levels (parents, household, and child-care) were found {{to be associated with the}} diet of young children. Different independent predictors were found for each of the two longitudinal dietary patterns, suggesting distinct pathways of influence. Our findings further suggest that interventions promoting healthier dietary choices for young children should involve both parents and take into account not only household financial disadvantage but also maternal age, family size and options for child-care...|$|R
