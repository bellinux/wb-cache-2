50|$|Whatever {{she wrote}} was a {{critical}} success and also sold well. But the money wasn't {{enough to cover the}} heavy expenses of her Mogoșoaia project (where the pavement of the Grand Hall is covered with gold), so she began writing popular romances under the pseudonym Lucile Décaux, and articles for fashion magazines under her own name. She <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>long-term</b> <b>contract</b> with The Saturday Evening Post and Paris-Soir. In the 1920s and the 1930s, Mogoșoaia Palace was to become the second League of Nations, as the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, Louis Barthou, put it.

30|$|However, the {{equipment}} itself often becomes {{an important factor}} when choosing the associate university. One of the respondents tells of how {{at least one of}} the projects approved under Federal Law No. 218 would never have been possible without the particular equipment involved. These kinds of commissions create a long history of collaboration with the university. It means that when a similar task comes up, the company comes to a university it already knows. One of the examples of this kind of collaboration is a company that works in 3 D graphics and <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>long-term</b> <b>contract</b> with the university for the calculations: it pays a small sum every month for a small amount of these calculations and if a larger commission comes up, ‘They also phone us. They are our priority customers… When the work is done we calculate the costs, make up the final contract and the invoice’ai. This is a classic example of a ‘vacillating’ contract relationship where it is impossible to calculate all the details of the contract beforehand and the final contract is made post factum, the relations being based on the mutual trust between partners.|$|R
50|$|A {{long period}} of {{inactivity}} ended in 1994, when the Circle Jerks reunited and signed a major label deal with Mercury Records, <b>a</b> move that <b>had</b> <b>a</b> few business complications: Hetson was still with Bad Religion, who <b>had</b> signed <b>a</b> <b>long-term</b> <b>contract</b> with Atlantic Records, while Schloss {{had been part of}} a band contracted to Interscope. After ironing out these difficulties, the band recorded Oddities, Abnormalities and Curiosities, released in the summer of 1995, but broke up once again. Reasons for this breakup were essentially the same as they were in 1990.|$|R

50|$|Hall's {{career was}} almost an {{uninterrupted}} success. She {{made more than}} 70 records for Decca, had her own BBC Radio series Wrapped in Velvet (making her the first black artist to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long-term</b> <b>contract</b> with the BBC), and appeared on the stage, in films, and in nightclubs (of which she owned her own in New York, London and Paris).

Her London nightclub The Old Florida Club owned by Hall and her husband was destroyed by a landmine during an air raid in 1939. Her husband Bert was in the club's cellar when the landmine exploded but he survived the attack.

During the show she mentions how she had just returned home from a tour.|$|R
50|$|The Consul's {{grandparents}} {{had been}} Merin Aspic (of Lusus) and Siri (of the lush ocean-planet Maui-Covenant). Aspic <b>had</b> signed <b>a</b> <b>long-term</b> <b>contract</b> {{to engage in}} several voyages aboard a spinship (with all the years lost to relativistic time dilation that that implies), which would make multiple trips to Maui-Covenant to build a farcaster portal, thereby connecting Maui-Covenant to the waiting voracious hordes of Hegemony tourists.

However, his best friend is killed by a Covenanter who disagrees violently with Maui-Covenant joining the WorldWeb (the events parallel those of Romeo and Juliet).|$|R
5000|$|Losey <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>long-term</b> <b>contract</b> with Dore Schary at RKO when Howard Hughes {{purchased}} {{the company in}} 1948 and began purging it of leftists. Losey later explained how Hughes tested employees {{to determine if they}} had Communist sympathies: [...] I was offered a film called I Married a Communist, which I turned down categorically. I later learned that it was a touchstone for establishing who was a [...] "red": you offered I Married a Communist to anybody you thought was a Communist, and if they turned it down, they were. Hughes responded by holding Losey to his contract without assigning him any work. In mid-1949, Schary persuaded Hughes to release Losey, who soon began working as an independent on The Lawless for Paramount Pictures. Soon he was working on a three-picture contract with Stanley Kramer. Then his name was mentioned by two witnesses before HUAC in the spring of 1951. Losey's attorney suggested arranging a deal with the committee for testimony in secret. Instead Losey abandoned his work editing The Big Night and left for Europe with his wife Louise a few days later, while HUAC took weeks to try unsuccessfully to serve him with a subpoena compelling his testimony.|$|R
50|$|Fox Sports {{no longer}} {{broadcast}} the Bowl Championship Series following {{the conclusion of}} the Orange Bowl on January 5; the network had carried the first three BCS National Championship stand-alone games.

50|$|Under the old studio system, {{vehicles}} were sometimes created for a promising young, inexperienced, or imported actor who <b>had</b> signed <b>a</b> <b>long-term</b> <b>contract</b> with <b>a</b> major studio. By showcasing that actor's talents, the vehicle {{was an attempt}} to create another bankable star bound to the studio until their contract expired. Vehicles were created for rising or established stars as diverse as Fred Astaire, Joan Crawford, the Marx Brothers and Elvis Presley. In some cases, audiences could be depended on to buy tickets to a succession of a favorite star's vehicles regardless of their plots or even their overall quality, as long as care was taken to present that star well.|$|R

50|$|Nonetheless, until 1997, CHAN {{bought the}} provincial rights to several popular series from CFTO's parent company, Baton Broadcasting. However, {{tensions}} were exacerbated that year when Baton won a licence {{to operate a}} new television station in Vancouver, CIVT-TV (channel 32), and immediately moved much of CHAN's stronger programs there. Baton won controlling interest in CTV soon after channel 32's launch, and it became an open secret that CIVT would eventually replace CHAN as the CTV station for the Vancouver market. CHAN <b>had</b> signed <b>a</b> <b>long-term</b> <b>contract</b> with CTV several years earlier that would not expire until 1999, but was extended to 2001.

A small amount of CHUM Limited-produced programs also aired on CHAN at times during the period from 1997 to 2001, including CityLine.|$|R

It {{was one of}} only five stations (not counting satellites or semi-satellites) under Meredith ownership (the company having recently sold off WTVH) {{at the time of the}} deal. In June 2006, the station's website was redesigned (along with those of four of Meredith's other stations). The old website was operated by the Local Media Network division of WorldNow.
