5|$|Fleas and ticks {{are common}} causes of {{physical}} irritation. In {{a study in}} Egypt, a species of Hyalomma was dominant in dromedaries, comprising 95.6% of the adult ticks isolated from the camels. In Israel, the number of ticks per camel ranged from 20 to 105. Nine camels in the date palm plantations in Arava Valley were <b>injected</b> <b>with</b> ivermectin, which is not effective against Hyalomma tick infestations. Larvae of the camel nasal fly Cephalopsis titillator can cause possibly fatal brain compression and nervous disorders. Illnesses that can affect dromedary productivity are pyogenic diseases and wound infections caused by Corynebacterium and Streptococcus, pulmonary disorders caused by Pasteurella such as hemorrhagic septicemia and Rickettsia species, camelpox, anthrax, and cutaneous necrosis caused by Streptothrix and deficiency of salt in the diet.|$|E
5|$|It {{is not yet}} {{known what}} {{specific}} agent in the body brings about the allergic reaction to the radiation. When patients with SU were <b>injected</b> <b>with</b> an irradiated autologous serum, many developed urticaria within the area of injection. When {{people who did not}} have SU were injected, they did not demonstrate similar symptoms. This indicates that the reaction is only a characteristic of the patients with solar urticaria and that it is not phototoxic. It is possible that this photoallergen is located on the binding sites of IgE that are found on the surface of mast cells. The photoallergen is believed to begin its configuration through the absorption of radiation by a chromophore. The molecule, because of the radiation, is transformed resulting in the formation of a new photoallergen.|$|E
5|$|Like all rare-earth metals, cerium is of low to {{moderate}} toxicity. A strong reducing agent, it ignites spontaneously in air at 65 to 80°C. Fumes from cerium fires are toxic. Water {{should not be}} used to stop cerium fires, as cerium reacts with water to produce hydrogen gas. Workers exposed to cerium have experienced itching, sensitivity to heat, and skin lesions. Cerium is not toxic when eaten, but animals <b>injected</b> <b>with</b> large doses of cerium have died due to cardiovascular collapse. Cerium is more dangerous to aquatic organisms, on account of being damaging to cell membranes, but this is not an important risk because it is not very soluble in water.|$|E

5|$|From 1945 to 1947, {{eighteen}} human {{test subjects}} were <b>injected</b> <b>with</b> plutonium without informed consent. The tests {{were used to}} create diagnostic tools to determine the uptake of plutonium in the body {{in order to develop}} safety standards for working with plutonium. Ebb Cade was an unwilling participant in medical experiments that involved injection of 4.7 micrograms of Plutonium on 10 April 1945 at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. This experiment was under the supervision of Harold Hodge. Other experiments directed by the United States Atomic Energy Commission and the Manhattan Project continued into the 1970s. The Plutonium Files chronicles the lives of the subjects of the secret program by naming each person involved and discussing the ethical and medical research conducted in secret by the scientists and doctors.

5|$|Metroid Fusion is an action-adventure {{platform}} shooter {{in which}} the player controls Samus Aran. Like previous games in the series, Metroid Fusion {{is set in a}} large open-ended world with elevators that connect regions, which each in turn contains rooms separated by doors. Samus opens most doors by shooting at them, while some only open after she reaches a certain point. Metroid Fusion unfolds in a more linear manner than previous Metroid games due to its focus on storyline; for example, Navigation Rooms are introduced in Metroid Fusion, which tell the player where to go. The gameplay revolves around solving puzzles to uncover secrets, platform jumping, and shooting enemies while searching for power-ups that allow Samus to reach new areas. <b>Injected</b> <b>with</b> a Metroid vaccine in Metroid Fusion, Samus can absorb X Parasites that restore health, missiles, and bombs. Power-ups can be obtained either by downloading them in Data Rooms, or absorbing a Core-X, which appears after defeating each boss. Metroid Fusion includes gameplay mechanics new to the series such as the ability to grab ledges and climb ladders.|$|E
5|$|Only {{a single}} Tyrannosaurus rex {{specimen}} has been conclusively shown {{to belong to}} a specific sex. Examination of B-rex demonstrated the preservation of soft tissue within several bones. Some of this tissue has been identified as a medullary tissue, a specialized tissue grown only in modern birds as a source of calcium for the production of eggshell during ovulation. As only female birds lay eggs, medullary tissue is only found naturally in females, although males are capable of producing it when <b>injected</b> <b>with</b> female reproductive hormones like estrogen. This strongly suggests that B-rex was female, and that she died during ovulation. Recent research has shown that medullary tissue is never found in crocodiles, which are thought to be the closest living relatives of dinosaurs, aside from birds. The shared presence of medullary tissue in birds and theropod dinosaurs is further evidence of the close evolutionary relationship between the two.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effect of the ergot alkaloid, ergotamine (ET), on the induction of CYP 3 A and the interaction in vivo and in vitro with ET. Sprague-Dawley rats were treated intraperitoneally for 4 days as follows: control (<b>injecting</b> <b>with</b> 0. 5 ml of only corn oil); dexamethasone treatment (<b>injecting</b> <b>with</b> 100 mg/kg of dexamethasone in corn oil); and ergotamine treatment (<b>injecting</b> <b>with</b> 100 mg/kg of ergotamine in corn oil). Liver tissues were collected from each group (n = 5, total of 30 rats) and liver microsomes were prepared. Cytochrome CYP 3 A activity was evaluated using ET and its isomer as substrates in medium containing liver microsomes and NADPH at 37 ℃ for 30 min. HPLC was used to measure the disappearance of the substrate and the appearance of the metabolites. Liver microsomes from rats pretreated with dexamethasone were five times more (P 0. 05) in activity of CYP 3 A when compared to the control group (5. 2 vs. 7. 0 nM ET/min/mg protein; SE = 4. 83) or ET isomer (1. 5 vs. 4. 7 nM ET isomer/ min/mg protein; SE = 1. 70). When ketoconazole was used as specific inhibitor of CYP 3 A, ergotamine metabolisms were inhibited in a dose dependent fashion reaching a maximum at an inhibitor to substrate ratio of greater than one and LD 50 at 0. 5 nM of ketoconazole/mg protein. The data presented in this study suggest that although the ergot alkaloids ergotamine and its isomer are ideal substrates for the isozyme CYP 3 A, these compounds have no effect on the induction of CYP 3 A after 4 days of treatment...|$|R

5|$|Silver {{compounds}} {{have low}} toxicity {{compared to those}} of most other heavy metals, as they are poorly absorbed by the human body when digested, and that which does get absorbed is rapidly converted to insoluble silver compounds or complexed by metallothionein. However, silver fluoride and silver nitrate are caustic and can cause tissue damage, resulting in gastroenteritis, diarrhoea, falling blood pressure, cramps, paralysis, and respiratory arrest. Animals repeatedly dosed with silver salts have been observed to experience anaemia, slowed growth, necrosis of the liver, and fatty degeneration of the liver and kidneys; rats implanted with silver foil or <b>injected</b> <b>with</b> colloidal silver have been observed to develop localised tumours. Parenterally admistered colloidal silver causes acute silver poisoning. Some waterborne species are particularly sensitive to silver salts {{and those of the}} other precious metals; in most situations, however, silver does not pose serious environmental hazards.|$|E

5|$|The {{method of}} {{embalming}} used by White is unrecorded, but in 1748 {{he had studied}} under the anatomist William Hunter, who had developed an early system of arterial embalming, therefore {{it is likely that}} White used the same method. The veins and arteries would have been <b>injected</b> <b>with</b> a mixture of turpentine and vermilion, after which the organs would have been removed from the chest and abdomen and placed in water, to clean them and to reduce their bulk. As much blood as possible would then have been squeezed out of the corpse, and the whole body washed with alcohol. The next stage would have been to replace the organs and to repeat the injection of turpentine and vermilion. The body cavities would then have been filled with a mixture of camphor, nitre and resin, before the body was sewn up and all openings filled with camphor. After a final washing, the body would have been packed into a box containing plaster of Paris, to absorb any moisture, and then probably coated with tar, to preserve it.|$|E
