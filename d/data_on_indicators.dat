40|$|OBJECTIVES: To use PERISTAT <b>data</b> <b>on</b> <b>indicators</b> of {{maternal}} mortality and morbidity to explore maternal health outcomes in Europe, {{and to discuss}} the implications of variations in the data sources for these indicators. STUDY DESIGN: The PERISTAT feasibility study provides the source for this descriptive study, covering 15 European countries. Maternal mortality ratios are calculated, and data to describe maternal mortality by age, cause of death and mode of delivery are pooled for the countries that provided data. RESULTS: Data presented show an increased risk {{of maternal}} death among older mothers and for caesarean sections compared with other modes of delivery, and the three most prevalent causes of maternal deaths reported were embolism, hypertensive diseases of pregnancy, and haemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: Variations in maternal mortality ratios reflect different data sources with varying levels of ascertainment in addition to differences in the number of maternal deaths. Further development is needed to construct comparable indicators of maternal morbidity. PERISTAT ISCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: After {{making a}} case that more {{attention}} needs {{to be given to}} the quality of data on corruption, we analyze and test the validity of data on corruption using the full range of data sets employed in corruption research. First, we show that different classes of sources of <b>data</b> <b>on</b> <b>indicators</b> of corruption, a distinction based on who evaluates a country’s level of corruption, rely on different standards to assess corruption and that the difference in standards does not hold consistently across countries. Second, we show that the problem with indicators is simply imported into Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index (CPI) and the World Bank’s Control of Corruption Index (CCI). Systematic differences among indicators are disregarded in the selection of indicators used in these indices. And the rule to aggregate indicators further induces bias that undermines the comparability of the CPI and the CCI. The implications of this assessment for the analysis and production of data on corruption are spelled out...|$|E
