40|$|Today ATM {{technology}} is facing challenges from Integrated Service IP, IP switching, <b>Gigabit</b> <b>IP</b> <b>router</b> and Gigabit Ethernet. Although ATM is approved by ITU-T {{as the standard}} technology in B-ISDN, its survivability is still in question. Since ATM-UBR (Unspecied Bit Rate) provides no service guarantee and ATM-ABR (Available Bit Rate) is still unattainable for most users, many existing users {{have little or no}} incentives to migrate to ATM technology. The Guaranteed Frame Rate (GFR) service is introduced to deal with this dilemma. The GFR can guarantee the Minimum Cell Rate (MCR) with fair access to excess bandwidth. This paper studies various schemes to support the GFR. We have studied dierent discarding and scheduling schemes, and compared their throughput and fairness when TCP/IP traÆc is carried. Through simulations, it is shown that only per-VC queueing withWeighted Round Robin (WRR) can guarantee Minimum Cell Rate.

The IP protocols have proven tobe very flexible and have been deployed widely over the past two decades. As technology makes it possible to communicate at gigabitspeeds, it is essential to create scalable, high-performance routers that implement IP protocols. In the past ten years, AsynchronousTransfer Mode (ATM) technology has emerged as a key component of next generation networks. ATM offers unprecedented scalabil-ity and cost/performance, as well as the ability to reserve network resources for real-time oriented traffic and support for multipointcommunication. Although IP and ATM often have been viewed as competitors,we believe their complementary strengths and limitations form a natural alliance that combines the best aspects of both technologies. For instance, one limitation of ATM networks has been the relatively large gap between the speed of the network data paths and thecontrol operations needed to configure those data paths to mee...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A {{technology}} for multicasting packetized multimedia streams such as IPTV over the Internet backbone is proposed and explored through extensive simulations. An RSVP or DiffServ al-gorithm {{is used to}} reserve resources (i. e., bandwidth and buffer space) in each packet-switched <b>IP</b> <b>router</b> in an <b>IP</b> multicast tree. Each <b>IP</b> <b>router</b> uses an Input-Queued (IQ) switch architecture with unity speedup.

A playback buffer is used at each destination to filter out residual network jitter and deliver a very low-jitter video stream to each end-user. Detailed simulations of an IPTV distribution network, multicasting 75 high-definition video streams over a fully-saturated IP backbone are presented. The simulations represent the transmission of 129 billion cells of real video data and where performed on a 160 -node cluster com-puting system.

In an energy-minimized design, the set of nodes corresponds to <b>IP</b> <b>routers</b> and optical switch nodes, and the link set symbolizes the physical fibers in the network. The proposed optimization model decreases energy dissipations in the network such as <b>IP</b> <b>routers</b> and WDM transponders to minimize overall network energy consumption. From the simulation results, it is observed that the proposed scheme consumes less power than the traffic grooming scheme when the lightpath bypass strategy is implemented. It is seen that the network size growth increases the power savings of the lightpath strategy because it provides longer lightpaths and allows bypassing of more intermediate switch nodes.|$|R

Several features make individual elements more powerful and complex configurations easier to write, including pull connections, which model packet flow driven by transmitting hardware devices, and flow-based router context, which helps an element locate other interesting elements.

40|$|SUMMARY In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{protocol}} for multicast communication called Multicast Datagram Transfer Protocol (MDTP) to provide multicast for video broadcasting {{service on the}} Internet. MDTP is a oneto-many multicast communication protocol, which is constructed based on IPv 4 unicast protocol by utilizing <b>IP</b> <b>Router</b> Alert Option, and it uses unicast addressing and unicast routing protocol. A mechanism is presented to allow a router to remove identical video stream, to duplicate a video stream, and to forward each copy of the duplicated video stream to its destinations. Ordinary <b>IP</b> <b>routers</b> that do not support MDTP will treat the MDTP packets as normal unicast packets. Hence, gradual deployment is possible without tunneling technique. With a delegation mechanism, MDTP router is also able to handle request from clients, and serve the requested video stream. The simulation {{results show that the}} average bandwidth usage of MDTP is close to the average bandwidth usage of IP multicast. MDTP also has greater efficiency than XCAST, and its efficiency becomes significant for a large number of clients. key words: multicast communication, video broadcasting, <b>IP</b> <b>Router</b> Aler...|$|R
