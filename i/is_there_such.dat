2500|$|Professor Dooge was {{involved}} {{in some of the}} earliest work done to identify the causes of climate change. He was heavily involved in the discussions within WMO in 1978 that eventually led to the first World Climate Conference being held in Geneva in 1979.

2500|$|When {{there are}} only two {{alternatives}} to choose from, May's theorem shows that only simple majority rule satisfies a certain set of criteria (e.g., equal treatment of individuals and of alternatives; increased support for a winning alternative should not make it into a losing one). On the other hand, when {{there are at least three}} alternatives, Arrow's theorem points out the difficulty of collective decision making.

2500|$|The {{resistivity}} {{of different}} materials varies by an enormous amount: For example, the conductivity of teflon is about 1030 times {{lower than the}} conductivity of copper. Why <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>such</b> a difference? Loosely speaking, a metal has large numbers of [...] "delocalized" [...] electrons that are not stuck in any one place, but free to move across large distances, whereas in an insulator (like teflon), each electron is tightly bound to a single molecule, and a great force is required to pull it away. Semiconductors lie between these two extremes. More details {{can be found in}} the article: Electrical resistivity and conductivity. For the case of electrolyte solutions, see the article: Conductivity (electrolytic).|$|E
2500|$|This third form of {{the messiah}} is {{referred}} to in halachic writings as the Mashiach Shebador, meaning the messiah of the generation. According to the Chatam Sofer: [...] "In every generation there is one righteous man (tzaddik) who merits to be the Messiah... and when the time comes, God will reveal Himself to him and send him." [...] According to Rabbi Chaim Hezekiah Medini, not only <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>such</b> a figure in each generation, but this figure was sometimes explicitly identified as such. [...] "They assumed who it [...] may be... Rabbi Judah the prince... in his generation they said and {{knew that it was}} he who was worthy... and [...] based on this the disciples of the Arizal wrote that in his time it was him. All this is simple and straightforward." ...|$|E

He did not invent the phrase; he acknowledged borrowing it from Lord Shaftesbury. In 1853, during the preparation for the Crimean War, Shaftesbury wrote to Foreign Minister Aberdeen that Greater Syria was [...] "a country without a nation" [...] in need of [...] "a nation without a country... <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>such</b> a thing?

[...] In his diary that year he wrote [...] "these vast and fertile regions will soon be without a ruler, without a known and acknowledged power to claim dominion. The territory must be assigned to some one or other... There is a country without a nation; and God now in his wisdom and mercy, directs us to a nation without a country."

2500|$|Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury, in July 1853, who was President of the London Society for Promoting Christianity Amongst the Jews {{wrote to}} Prime Minister Aberdeen that Greater Syria was [...] "a country without a nation" [...] {{in need of}} [...] "a nation without a country... <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>such</b> a thing? To be sure there is, the ancient and {{rightful}} lords of the soil, the Jews!" [...] In May of the following year, {{he wrote in his}} diary [...] "Syria is 'wasted without an inhabitant'; these vast and fertile regions will soon be without a ruler, without a known and acknowledged power to claim dominion. The territory must be assigned to some one or other... There is a country without a nation; and God now, in His wisdom and mercy, directs us to a nation without a country". In 1875, Shaftesbury told the annual general meeting of the Palestine Exploration Fund that [...] "We have there a land teeming with fertility and rich in history, but almost without an inhabitant – a country without a people, and look! scattered over the world, a people without a country".|$|E
2500|$|... "This begs many questions. First, <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>such</b> a {{thing as}} 'the {{international}} community'? Do people in China, which accounts for {{a fifth of the}} world's population, and the Buddhists, who account for another fifth—among others—really want the U.S. and its client states to bomb the Serbs or Iraqis? And who exactly, and when, deputed the U.S. to act on behalf of this 'world community'? ... Secondly, can the blunt weapon of force, of whose use U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright boasted, balance conflicting and competing ethnic, religious, economic and political interactions over this wide and conflictive region? Can the U.S. raise the expectations of the Albanians and Slav Moslems without affronting Macedonians, Greeks, Italians, Bulgars and Croats, as well as Serbs? ... Thirdly, can force be a substitute for policy? It was a wise German who said that you can do anything with bayonets except sit on them. The same goes for gunships, the modern equivalent of gunboat diplomacy. Bomb and rocket once, and it has an effect. But if the victim survives, the second bout is less effective, because the victim is learning to cope." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kierkegaard {{moves the}} reader {{from the idea}} of the Creator to that of an eternal salvation. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>such</b> a thing as an eternal salvation? He says. It may be a merit of our present age that in many ways it has known how to work the wish weary and in that way to wean the soul from wishing; it may be to its {{advantage}} if it thereby has developed an honest earnestness that for the good renounces the fraudulence of wishes. We do not reproach the age for having made the idea {{of the power of the}} wish into playing with words if it thereby motivates someone to work with his own hands instead of with the borrowed energy of the wish. But the wish for heaven's salvation-is this, too, a play on words, as wishing for heavenly help has become for the frivolous, who thinks that we ought to depend on God the way we depend on people –that is, if you help yourself then God does the rest. And if the wish for heaven's salvation has become playing with words, has the aim in it been to incite people to work all the harder to gain it? This seems not at all to be the case. Instead, eternal salvation seems to have become what the thought of it has become, a loose and idle phrase, at times virtually forgotten, or arbitrarily left out of the language, or indifferently set aside as an old-fashioned turn of speech no longer used but retained only because it is so quaint. And whereas in the old days one received heaven's salvation by the grace of God, nowadays heaven's salvation often seems to have become like an old, decrepit person who in the house of the mighty sustains his life on the miserable bread of charity.
