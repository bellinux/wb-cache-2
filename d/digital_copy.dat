40|$|One {{concern with}} {{digitization}} {{in the cultural}} sector is that unauthorized, <b>digital</b> <b>copying</b> will disrupt cultural supply. This paper discusses the evidence for an impact of <b>digital</b> <b>copying</b> on the commercial supply of new, copyrighted sound recordings in Germany. The method is an intervention analysis for short time series. In spite of a severe recession in the primary market for sound recordings with the diffusion of <b>digital</b> <b>copying</b> technology, the annual number of new titles released to the market continued to expand. There is no significant deviation from a long-term upward trend. Further empirical research is needed {{on the impact of}} <b>digital</b> <b>copying</b> on the supply of protected works, as well as on intervening factors fostering the supply of copyright works. According to the findings of this paper, it is questionable whether more extensive public expenditure on copyright protection is desirable...|$|R
