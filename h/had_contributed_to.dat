5|$|István Jósika, István Bodoni, {{and other}} fellow-students of Andrew became {{important}} advisors {{of the young}} Sigismund Báthory in Transylvania. After the Diet of Transylvania expelled the Jesuits in December 1588, Pope Sixtus V excommunicated Sigismund. Andrew went to Transylvania and sent letters to Rome to achieve a reconciliation, emphasizing that the Jesuits' aggressive proselytizing policy <b>had</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> their unpopularity in the predominantly Protestant principality.|$|E

5|$|Filmed between May and June 1980, Inseminoid {{is based}} on a script written by Nick and Gloria Maley, a couple who <b>had</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> the special effects of Warren's films {{starting}} with Satan's Slave (1976). A low budget of £1million, half of which was contributed by the Hong Kong Shaw Brothers, funded location filming in both the Chislehurst Caves in Kent and on the island of Gozo in Malta. Composer John Scott perfected the electronic score of Inseminoid in multiple hours-long studio sessions following the completion of shooting.|$|E

5|$|Michael Farrar {{underwent}} surgery in December 1995 to treat an abscess {{in his brain}} caused by the poisoning. Fearful that Farrar would not survive the proceedings, and knowing that his testimony was key to their case, prosecutors videotaped his testimony beforehand. The surgery was successful, and Farrar testified in person and recounted Green's problems with alcohol and the break-up of their marriage. Under cross-examination by Green's counsel, he admitted that both he and Green <b>had</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> {{the problems in the}} couple's marriage and that his relationship with his son had been so adversarial that they had sometimes come to blows.|$|E

An inquiry determined that modifications to the windscreen <b>had</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> the accident but the main factor had been the pilot's handling of the highly sensitive controls. Engineers recalculated the stress factors on the airframe and they {{were found to be}} safe; the crash was attributed to pilot error and the sensitivity of the controls.|$|E
5|$|The credits {{printed on}} the sleeve of the first release were largely {{incomplete}} and made no distinction between the recording sessions of 1982-84 and those of 1987-88, apparently validating the false assumption that the original line-up of Blue Öyster Cult had reunited for {{the making of the}} album.

5|$|There {{were also}} {{penalties}} enacted against the French officers whose neglectful behaviour <b>had</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> the mutiny at Yen Bay. Resident Superior Robin released Resident Massimi from his duties {{immediately after the}} mutiny. No punishment was handed down to Commandant Le Tacon, the main person responsible for the security at Yen Bay which had failed to stop the mutiny. Neither Robin nor General Aubert, who were ultimately accountable for the failures of their subordinates, were punished. The former remained in Indochina as Governor General until retiring in 1936. Aubert returned to France when his three-year term ended {{in the autumn of}} 1930.|$|E
5|$|By May 1944, {{the parishioners}} <b>had</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> the war having given {{thousands}} of pints of {{blood to the}} Blood Banks; given money to the war relief campaigns; been active on the home front, and sent 808 {{men and women to}} the Armed Forces. There was a group that prepared and sent out a weekly special bulletin to the parishioners in the Armed Forces. These parishioners were happy to receive news from home on the progress of their new church and many of them sent home money to go towards the building fund. During the war, hundreds of dollars came in from these parishioners fighting in the war. Of the 808 parishioners who went off to war, seven died and their names were engraved on a piece of granite outside of the church: James DiMuzio, Arthur Capo, Nick Costelli, Justine DeFelices, Neal Chipoletti, and Anthony Zaffuto.|$|E

5|$|Despite Spielberg's rejection, {{the studio}} {{went ahead with}} plans to make the sequel, leading to an arduous 18-month {{pre-production}} process. Howard Sackler, who <b>had</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> the first film's script but chose not to be credited, was charged with writing the first draft. He originally proposed a prequel based on {{the sinking of the}} USS Indianapolis, the story relayed by Quint in the first film. Although Universal president Sidney Sheinberg thought Sackler's treatment for the film was intriguing, he rejected the idea. On Sackler's recommendation, theatre and film director John D. Hancock was chosen to helm the picture. Sackler later felt betrayed when Dorothy Tristan, Hancock's wife, was invited to rewrite his script.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{transition}} of the young bands from being local attractions to touring extensively in the UK, major record labels' A agents still did not recognise the rising new trend. Thus, most new bands signed contracts with small independent labels, which could afford only limited printings of singles and albums and usually offered only national distribution. Many other bands, including Iron Maiden, Def Leppard and Diamond Head, self-produced their first releases and sold them through mail order or at concerts. Saxon {{were the first to}} sign with an internationally distributed label, the French Carrere Records, followed by Def Leppard with Phonogram in August 1979, and Iron Maiden with EMI in December 1979. In early 1980, EMI tested the market with the Neal Kay-compiled album Metal for Muthas and a UK tour of the bands that <b>had</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> the compilation, eventually signing Angel Witch (who were dropped after the release of their first single) and Ethel the Frog.|$|E
5|$|Elements of {{the zero}} gravity scenes were handled by Pacific Data Images, while phaser beams and {{transporter}} effects were generated by Visual Concept Engineering, {{an offshoot of}} ILM that <b>had</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> The Wrath of Khan and The Final Frontier. Despite the overall count of effects shots being dropped from over 100 to 51, the project was still large, and required virtually the entire ILM staff to complete. Farrar's goal was to economize the remaining effects; if three shots were similar, {{they would try to}} tell the story with only one. Cheap animatics provided Meyer with placeholders to cut into the film and avoid costly surprises. Stock footage from previous films were used whenever possible, but it was often unfeasible to do so; as the original USS Enterprise had been destroyed in , all shots of the USS Enterprise-A had to feature the updated ship registry.|$|E

5|$|Father Secchi {{produced}} {{some of the}} first color illustrations of Mars in 1863. He used the names of famous explorers for the distinct features. In 1869, he observed two dark linear features on the surface that he referred to as canali, which is Italian for 'channels' or 'grooves'. In 1867, English astronomer Richard A. Proctor created a more detailed map of Mars based on the 1864 drawings of English astronomer William R. Dawes. Proctor named the various lighter or darker features after astronomers, past and present, who <b>had</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> the observations of Mars. During the same decade, comparable maps and nomenclature were produced by the French astronomer Camille Flammarion and the English astronomer Nathan Green.|$|E
5|$|In 1020, King Canute {{elevated}} Roskilde to a bishopric, {{giving it}} high national status. Absalon, the Danish bishop, had a brick church {{built on the}} site of Harald's church in 1170. Today's cathedral was completed in 1275 after five of Absalon's successors <b>had</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> its construction. As a result of Absalon's influence, many other churches were built in the vicinity, making Roskilde the most important town in Zealand. Coins were minted there from the 11th to the 14th century. In 1150, Sweyn Grathe built a moat around the city. The Roskilde bishops owned large areas of land in the region including, from 1186, Havn on the Øresund which later became Copenhagen. By the time of the Danish Reformation in 1536, there were 12 churches and five monasteries in the city.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to further Cossack attacks Tatar incursions continued as well, in 1623 and 1624 reaching almost as far west as the Vistula, with the attendant plunder and taking of captives. More effective defense {{was put together}} by the freed Koniecpolski and Stefan Chmielecki, who defeated the Tatars on several occasions between 1624 and 1633, using the quarter army supported by the Cossacks and general population. More warfare with the Ottomans took place in 1633–1634 and ended with a peace treaty. In 1644 Koniecpolski defeated Tugay Bey's army at Okhmativ and before his death planned an invasion against the Crimean Khanate. King Władysław IV's ideas of a grand international war-crusade against the Ottoman Empire were thwarted by the inquisition sejm in 1646. The state's inability to control {{the activities of the}} magnates and the Cossacks <b>had</b> <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> the semi-permanent instability and danger at the Commonwealth's south-eastern frontiers.|$|E
