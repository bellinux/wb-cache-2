25|$|Having {{seen the}} disaster, Henry Charles ran to Rocky Point, {{where there was}} a {{telephone}} link to the quarantine station at William Head. The quarantine station received the call at 7:56 p.m. They blew the <b>emergency</b> <b>whistle,</b> and five minutes later Captain Thomas Riley took out the government steamer Madge to go to the scene (Madge as the quarantine vessel always had steam up, because they never knew when a ship might arrive.) When they got there, they cruised around in the dark for about two hours looking for bodies or wreckage, but found none.|$|E
25|$|The Flyer's {{gangplank}} {{was extended}} out {{to one of}} these freight loading slips. As the passengers were boarding, the slip locking mechanism gave way, the ramp collapsed into the water, and 50 people were tumbled into the sound. The captain of the Flyer saw the accident and immediately blew the <b>emergency</b> <b>whistle.</b> The fireboat Snoqualmie, which had {{come to the aid of}} the Flyer twenty years before, now again went to her assistance, as did the launch Skeeter, skipper Roy Lillico, and boat of the Rosalie, in charge of mate Louis Van Bogaert. The captain ordered the crew to toss life preservers and anything else floatable to the people struggling in the water. Within ten minutes, all but two people, Mrs. G.V. Leonard and a one–year–old baby, Carl Bruder, had been rescued. Their tragic drownings broke the Flyer's long record of passenger safety.|$|E
50|$|Upon {{dropping}} off the crew from the Stefano, Abram Kean headed away to retrieve his own crew. By 1:30pm, a blizzard had begun {{and was in}} full effect. Abram Kean spent the day retrieving his own men and their equipment, while heading back toward the SS Newfoundland, which had only sounded its <b>emergency</b> <b>whistle</b> twice that night, because its captain, Westbury Kean was sure his crew was safe on the Stephano.|$|E
50|$|Votes tabulated, Mr. Stephens and Miss Gardner {{announce}} Tommy and Carrie as Prom King and Queen. While {{the assembled}} salute {{them with the}} school song ("Alma Mater"), Sue spots the bucket dangling above the coronation area, confirming her worst suspicions. Frantic, she tries to warn Miss Gardner, but the teacher, who's been wary of Sue's motives in forgoing her Prom in favor of Carrie, pushes {{her out of the}} gym. Chris cues Billy, who yanks the bucket and drenches Carrie in blood. As the Prom-goers' stunned silence turns to derisive laughter, her unimaginable humiliation turns to fury - and then madness. Lashing out with her power, she exacts a terrible revenge on friend and foe alike ("The Destruction"). Powerless, Sue watches her classmates all perish. She alone survives. As <b>emergency</b> <b>whistles</b> sound and sirens wail, Sue follows the path of destruction that leads through the street to Carrie's house.|$|R
50|$|Two philosophies {{surround}} {{the preparation of}} mini survival kits. Some people like to carry a few, relatively large items such as a knife, matches, <b>whistle,</b> <b>emergency</b> food, water bottle, etc. Others prefer a collection of smaller but more comprehensive items such as rubber bands, paper clips, fishing equipment, lashing material, razor blades, etc. The decision of which technique to subscribe to depends on one's physical condition, survival skills, wilderness knowledge, and other factors.|$|R
50|$|Speedy reveals himself {{once they}} are on a cruise liner, and Daffy quickly tries to get rid of him, but is tricked into the ocean, {{narrowly}} avoiding becoming shark bait. He decides to stay in his cabin, but Speedy again tricks him and gets his lunch. Thoroughly annoyed, Daffy attempts to fool Speedy into jumping overboard by pulling the <b>emergency</b> <b>whistle,</b> but instead is himself fooled into jumping ship.|$|E

5000|$|On May 9, 2017, a South Korean {{fishing vessel}} (about 60- to 70 feet in length) accidentally {{collided}} with the port side of [...] USS Lake Champlain while the ship was underway and conducting [...] "routine operations in international waters" [...] off Asia. No one was injured. The Navy ship had attempted to contact the vessel, but the fishing boat lacked a radio. The fishing vessel {{did not respond to}} USS Lake Champlain's <b>emergency</b> <b>whistle.</b> Both the cruiser and the fishing vessel were undamaged enough to able to sail away under their own power.|$|E
50|$|Navigation and map-reading are {{essential}} hillwalking skills on high ground and mountains, {{due to the}} variability of British and Irish weather {{and the risk of}} rain, low cloud, fog or the onset of darkness. In some areas it is common for there to be no waymarked path to follow. In most areas walking boots {{are essential}} along with weatherproof clothing, spare warm clothes, and in mountainous areas a bivvy bag or bothy bag in case an accident forces a prolonged, and possibly overnight halt. Other important items carried by hillwalkers are: food and water, an <b>emergency</b> <b>whistle,</b> torch/flashlight (and spare batteries), and first aid kit. And, where reception permits, a fully charged mobile phone is recommended. Hillwalkers are also advised to let someone know their route and estimated time of return or arrival.|$|E

5000|$|As No. 4 {{approached}} the interlocking tower at Shops Junction, tower operator J. S. Johnson showed {{a clear signal}} from the tower's train order signals, indicating all was clear. As he stopped to record the train in his logs, he noticed {{that there was no}} entry showing that the opposing train No. 1 had passed. Johnson reported to the dispatcher who telegraphed back, [...] "He meets No. 1 there, can you stop him?" [...] Johnson sounded the <b>emergency</b> <b>whistle,</b> but there was no one at the rear of No. 4 to hear it. The train passed {{on the assumption that the}} clear train order board indicated that the line ahead was clear. Also, the engineman and conductor failed to visually inspect the train register at Shops Junction to ascertain as to whether No. 1 had yet arrived. That was required by operating instructions issued by the railroad's management prior to the wreck.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In {{search and}} rescue missions, Micro Air Vehicles (MAV’s) can assist rescuers to faster locate victims inside a large search area and to {{coordinate}} their efforts. Acoustic signals {{play an important role}} in outdoor rescue operations. Emergency whistles, as found on most aircraft life vests, are commonly carried by people engaging in outdoor activities, and are also used by rescue teams, as they allow to signal reliably over long distances and far beyond visibility. For a MAV involved in such missions, the ability to locate the source of a distress sound signal, such as an <b>emergency</b> <b>whistle</b> blown by a person in need of help, is therefore significantly important and would allow the localization of victims and rescuers during night time, through foliage and in adverse conditions such as dust, fog and smoke. In this paper we present a sound source localization system for a MAV to locate narrowband sound sources on the ground, such as the sound of a whistle or personal alarm siren. We propose a method based on a particle filter to combine information from the cross correlation between signals of four spatially separated microphones mounted on the MAV, the dynamics of the aerial platform, and the doppler shift in frequency of the sound due to the motion of the MAV. Furthermore, we evaluate our proposed method in a real world experiment where a flying micro air vehicle is used to locate and track the position of a narrowband sound source on the ground.
