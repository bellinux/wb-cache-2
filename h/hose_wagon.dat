25|$|After the Great Fire, a small one-story wood frame firehouse {{was erected}} near {{the foot of}} Madison Street, but not quite at the present site. It opened January 3, 1891 with a crew of nine, the new fireboat Snoqualmie and a small <b>hose</b> <b>wagon.</b> In 1902, a larger two-story wood frame {{building}} was constructed on the present site and in 1910, the new fireboat Duwamish replaced the Snoqualmie. The wood frame building was demolished in 1916 and replaced by an elegant brick building in 1917, incorporating Craftsman and Tudor Revival details. An additional fireboat Alki came into service in 1928.|$|E
50|$|The {{main floor}} of the {{building}} is an open 57 by 64 ft room with no supporting posts. When it was built it could hold four <b>hose</b> <b>wagons</b> and had stalls for ten horses that pulled the wagons. The stalls were paved with vitrified brick, and each had its own sewer connect. There was also a ventilation system to help eliminate odors and flies.|$|R

25|$|Forest Grove {{started a}} {{volunteer}} fire department on February 4, 1894, with {{combination of two}} fire companies. The department was created after bucket brigades were determined to be inefficient, and the two fire companies {{spent too much time}} fighting each other. One of the first chiefs was J. G. Lenneville, who was first elected to the post in 1901, and served through at least 1923. In December 1907, the city purchased a <b>hose</b> <b>wagon</b> for $100. The city replaced the fire bell that had been housed at a church and at the Old College Hall at Pacific University with an electric siren in October 1925. A 1907 steamer used by the Portland Fire Bureau was bought by Forest Grove in 1933 for $150, and is still owned by the fire department.|$|E

50|$|The city hosts four museums. The Fire Museum {{is housed}} in a {{restored}} 1901 firehouse building. The museum's firefighting equipment and memorabilia include leather fire buckets used in colonial times, a display showing the evolution of sprinkler systems, a horse-drawn <b>hose</b> <b>wagon,</b> a 1921 Ahrens-Fox fire pumper, and a 105 ft 1911 water tower.|$|E
50|$|In 1877, {{not long}} after the city water works had been established, the city leaders thought that there would be {{sufficient}} water pressure to fight fires. The fire chief was ordered to remove all of the steamers from service and reduce the force to only 14 men. Shortly thereafter, there was a disastrous fire in the West Bottoms. The KCFD was only able to respond with <b>hose</b> <b>wagons</b> and suffered from low water pressure. As a result, the entire block was threatened and several buildings were destroyed. The steamers were placed back in service the next day.|$|R
5000|$|On May 17, 1849 at 9:00 p.m. a {{fire alarm}} sounded in St. Louis. The paddle wheeled {{steamboat}} [...] "The White Cloud" [...] {{on the river}} {{at the foot of}} Cherry Street was on fire. The volunteer Fire Department with nine hand engines and <b>hose</b> reel <b>wagons</b> promptly responded. The moorings holding the [...] "White Cloud" [...] burned through and the burning steamboat drifted slowly down the Mississippi River, setting 22 other steam boats and several flatboats and barges on fire.|$|R
50|$|In May 1910, two {{motorized}} <b>hose</b> <b>wagons</b> {{were placed}} into service at Engine Co. 6 and Engine Co. 8. On November 5 of that year, Engine Co. 10 was placed into service at Station 10 Saw Mill River Road with Engine Co. 8's former apparatus. The first motorized pumping engine arrived in 1911 and was placed into service at Engine Co. 5. In 1912, a two shift/platoon system was enacted so firemen could work shorter hours. In 1913, the Telegraph Bureau {{was moved to}} City Hall. The system was now made up of over 150 Fire Alarm Boxes and over 100 miles of telegraph wire. The Fire Chief's office was also moved to City Hall. That same year, the YFD's first motorized ladder truck arrived from the American LaFrance company. The Chief of Department and 2 Assistant Chiefs were also given automobiles. By the end of 1913, 8 pieces of fire apparatus were motorized. In 1914, Truck Co. 4 was placed into service at the Station 4 Radford Street Firehouse. By May 22, 1916, the entire Yonkers Fire Department was motorized, marking {{the end of the}} horse-drawn fire apparatus era. At the end of 1916, the YFD had over 126 firemen.|$|R
50|$|The steam-driven pumper, the <b>hose</b> <b>wagon,</b> and the hood-and-ladder truck {{became the}} three major horse-drawn {{firefighting}} vehicles. However, it was the steamer, usually driven with horses harnessed two or three abreast, that provided the most spectacular sight as it flew {{down the street with}} smoke pouring from the funnel of its boiler, building up a head of steam to run the pumps.|$|E

50|$|Crew {{members had}} to smash {{portholes}} to drag some passengers {{out of their}} cabins. Moments before the whistle sounded, the pier’s night watchman noticed the flames coming from the ship and called the Toronto Fire Department. A pumper truck, a <b>hose</b> <b>wagon,</b> a high-pressure truck, an aerial truck, a rescue squad, the deputy chief and a fireboat were dispatched to the scene. Ambulances and police were also dispatched. The first fire truck arrived at the pier at 2:41 a.m.|$|E
5000|$|The American LaFrance Fire Engine Company {{was one of}} {{the oldest}} fire {{apparatus}} manufacturers in the United States. With roots that go back to approximately 1832, the companies that went on to become American LaFrance built hand-drawn, horse-drawn, and steam-powered fire engines. Founded in 1873 by Truckson LaFrance and his partners, including Alexander S. Diven [...] as the LaFrance Manufacturing Company selling hand powered equipment. The International Fire Engine Company, corporate predecessor of American LaFrance, built some steam power fire engines between 1903 and 1907. Apparatus built by International included horse drawn steamers, <b>hose</b> <b>wagons,</b> and hook & ladders to chemical engines, water towers and combinations. The American LaFrance Fire Engine Company was formed in 1903. Its corporate offices and manufacturing plant were in Elmira, New York. It also operated a Canadian plant in Toronto, Ontario, where it sold apparatus under the name Lafrance-Foamite, until 1971. ALF delivered its first motorized fire engine in 1907. Over the years, American LaFrance built thousands of fire trucks including chemical engines, combination pumpers, aerial ladder trucks, Aero Chief snorkel trucks, and airport crash trucks. The classical style of the American LaFrance apparatus is easily recognized. Some of the company's innovations led to changes in the industry, most notably the cab forward style cab.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to conduct a thorough accounting of energy used to transport liquid pig manure from farm storage to the field and to surface-apply the manure. Energy consumption was determined using both energy data from the literature plus data from field-scale research. Energy consumption was compared between two manure application systems (the drag hose and the slurry wagon systems) and two application timing treatments (single vs. twice-annual manure application). The single annual application of liquid pig manure applied at 81. 5 m 3  ha- 1 and transported 1. 8  km from storage to field consumed 2180 mJ ha- 1 with the drag hose system and 2185 mJ ha- 1 with the slurry wagon system. The twice-annual manure application regime used 2726 and 2209 mJ ha- 1 for the drag <b>hose</b> and slurry <b>wagon</b> systems, respectively. When energy use was calculated on the basis of MJ per kg of available N, liquid pig manure applied once annually with the slurry wagon system provided N at 17. 76 mJ kg- 1 of available N, which was 33 % of the energy cost of N from anhydrous ammonia and 23 % of the energy cost of N from urea. Manure transport distance could be increased to 8. 4  km before the energy cost per kg of available N from pig manure was equivalent to anhydrous ammonia, and up to 12. 3  km before the energy cost of manure N was equivalent to urea N. Despite the high energy cost to deliver liquid pig manure from storage to field, the much lower cost per kg of available N compared to inorganic fertilizer N highlights the opportunities that exist for improving the energy efficiency of industrial agriculture by replacing inorganic fertilizers with manure. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{department}} {{received its}} first motorized unit in September 1909, with the $4,750 {{purchase of a}} Seagrave, <b>hose</b> <b>wagon</b> and chemical engine. Following another major fire in 1924 at the Motor Transit building, the number of fire hydrants in the city was doubled. By 1938, the department had grown to 33 firefighters and five engine companies spread out across four stations. Starting in 2000, the department transitioned to the Advanced Life Support (ALS) level of support.|$|E

50|$|In 1883, a {{new city}} fire station was {{constructed}} at 514 Fifth Street (118-5318-0011). “Fire Station No. 1,” which boasted 15 men, 1 steam engine (pulled by 4 horses), 1 <b>hose</b> <b>wagon</b> (pulled by 2 horses), and 1 hook and ladder (pulled by 4 horses), served {{for more than four}} decades before being supplanted by a new Art Deco style facility designed by Clark and Crowe at the intersection of Fifth and Church Streets (demolished). Biggers School (called the “Fifth Avenue Public School” in 1890), located at the west corner of Clay and Fifth Streets, opened in 1881 with a capacity of 305 students. The large building was designed by August Forsberg, and was demolished in 1967. Except for the school and the Gist, Bruce, and Halsey tobacco facilities, the “lower” end of Fifth Street (the 200-400 blocks) was primarily residential in nature during {{the last quarter of the}} nineteenth century. The 500 block contained a bakery & confectionery, two grocery stores, an ice cream parlor and dairy, a drug store, the Lynchburg Steam Laundry, and the newly constructed Fifth Street Fire Station (118-5318-0011), which was labeled “Fire Station No. 1.” The 600 and 700 blocks of Fifth Street boasted 18 stores, a restaurant, wood working shop, and the former Phoenix Carriage Works at Fifth and Federal. Three of these stores remain, including the early 19th century buildings at 612 and 708 Fifth (118-5318-0018 and 118-5318-0027, respectively) and the circa 1850 brick building at 620 Fifth Street (118-5318-0021). The 900 and 1000 blocks of Fifth Street contained six grocery stores (including R.H. Padgett’s store, which occupied an ancient c. 1800 store at the corner of Polk and Fifth that was demolished in the mid-20th century), two shoe stores, a candy store, a barber, and two tobacco factories (J.B. Evans & Son and Loyd Phelps & Co.).|$|E
50|$|On December 13, 1997, The African American Firefighter Museum opened. Firefighter/lead Paramedic Michelle Banks {{served as}} the first President. On opening day, Fire Chief Bamattre spoke to the Old Stentorians and issued a formal apology for {{enduring}} a terrible time during {{the integration of the}} LAFD during the mid 1950s. Station 30, along with station 14, integrated in 1956 and was later closed in 1980. It is now home to the African American Firefighter Museum and is dedicated to collecting, conserving and sharing the shared history and heritage of African American firefighters. The history of African American firefighters in Los Angeles spans more than 100 years and provides a unique glimpse into the history of firefighting, race relations and segregation in the City. It was one of two segregated fire stations where black firefighters worked in Los Angeles between 1924 and 1955. It was built in 1913 and served the Central Avenue community of the City. It is now beautifully restored and has the original apparatus floor tiles, poles and kitchen out-building. In 1985 Old Fire Station 30 was declared a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument - #289 on the historic register - and is the recipient of the Los Angeles Conservancy's 1999 Preservation Award. It is opened to the public as a museum. In 2009 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places along with No. 14. Old Fire Station 30 exhibits display a wide array of firefighting gear including vintage engines (a 1890 <b>hose</b> <b>wagon</b> and a 1940 Pirsch ladder truck), uniforms from LA County and LA City firefighters, New York badges and uniforms, helmets of all kinds, displays of African American women firefighters, photographs, and other paraphernalia and firefighting artifacts.|$|E
