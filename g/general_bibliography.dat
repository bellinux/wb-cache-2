His first publication, in 1876, was a monograph on Samuil Micu-Klein. When he entered the Academy Library in 1879, the beginning of a 56-year affiliation that would end with his death, the institution had 6,000 donated volumes; by 1885, there were 30,000 and its formative phase was complete. In 1895, he started a bibliographic office at the library that through 1925 would attract the efforts of the country's scholars interested in creating a <b>general</b> <b>bibliography</b> of Romanian culture.|$|E
