5|$|Initially, {{high-ranking}} US Navy officials {{elected to}} contract a private salvage firm {{to free the}} battleship, but Admiral Smith, at the time Commander, Cruisers, Atlantic, {{and the man who}} was responsible for issuing Missouris orders disagreed with this plan. He reasoned that if the Navy got her on to the shoal, then they should be responsible for getting her off the shoal. Ultimately, he won his case for a US Navy salvage effort, but he was explicitly informed by officials at The Pentagon that his career would ride on his ability to successfully get Missouri back into <b>deep</b> <b>water.</b> To better organize the salvage effort, Smith and a number of men on his staff moved aboard Missouri to supervise her return to <b>deep</b> <b>water.</b> Smith's supervision also extended to answering the nearly 10,000 letters sent to the Navy from concerned citizens offering advice on how to get the battleship back into <b>deep</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E

5|$|Anthozoans are {{exclusively}} marine, {{and include}} sea anemones, stony corals, soft corals, sea pens, sea fans and sea pansies. Anthozoa {{is the largest}} taxon of cnidarians; over six thousand solitary and colonial species have been described. They {{range in size from}} small individuals less than half a centimetre across to large colonies a metre or more in diameter. They include species {{with a wide range of}} colours and forms that build and enhance reef systems. Although reefs and shallow water environments exhibit a great array of species, there are in fact more species of coral living in <b>deep</b> <b>water</b> than in shallow, and many taxa have shifted during their evolutionary history from shallow to <b>deep</b> <b>water</b> and vice versa.|$|E

5|$|Habitat types include polar, temperate, {{subtropical}} and tropical. The terrestrial {{vegetation type}} may be forest, steppe, grassland, semi-arid or desert.

This natural haven is what made Falmouth such an important harbour, it being the last good shelter for ships heading westwards towards the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E

2500|$|An {{unintended}} consequence of ending the water diversions was {{the onset of}} a period of [...] "meromixis" [...] in Mono Lake. In the time prior to this, Mono Lake was typically [...] "monomictic"; which means that at least once each year the <b>deeper</b> <b>waters</b> and the shallower waters of the lake mixed thoroughly, thus bringing oxygen and other nutrients to the <b>deep</b> <b>waters.</b> In meromictic lakes, the <b>deeper</b> <b>waters</b> do not undergo this mixing; the deeper layers are more saline than the water near the surface, and are typically nearly devoid of oxygen. As a result, becoming meromictic greatly changes a lake's ecology.|$|R
5|$|Brazil {{has one of}} {{the largest}} {{renewable}} energy programs in the world, involving production of ethanol fuel from sugar cane, and ethanol now provides 18 percent of the country's automotive fuel.

5|$|<b>Deep</b> <b>water</b> coral {{habitats}} {{are also}} threatened by human activities, particularly by indiscriminate trawling. These ecosystems have been little studied, {{but in the}} perpetual darkness and cold temperatures, animals grow and mature slowly and there are relatively fewer fish worth catching than in the sunlit waters above. To what extent deep-water coral reefs provide a safe nursery area for juvenile fish has not been established, {{but they may be}} important for many cold-water species.|$|E
5|$|Fisheries {{operating}} off Portugal and Japan {{are responsible}} for most commercial landings of the kitefin shark, generally as bycatch in bottom trawls and on hook-and-line. Portugal reported a kitefin shark bycatch of 282 tons in 2000 and 119 tons in 2003. In {{other areas of the}} northeastern Atlantic this shark is rare and reported catches are likely confounded by misidentifications of other species; some are caught by mixed-species gillnet fisheries operating in <b>deep</b> <b>water</b> west of the British Isles, where surveys suggest that kitefin shark numbers may have declined by 94% since the 1970s. In the Mediterranean, this shark is caught incidentally by bottom trawl and gillnet fisheries. Although it is generally discarded alive, many are unable to return to <b>deep</b> <b>water</b> and do not survive. In the Southern Hemisphere, catches by the Australian South East Trawl Fishery are increasing following the relaxation of regulations regarding seafood mercury content; this species is not included under Australian fishery quotas. New Zealand kitefin shark catches peaked from 1986 to 1997. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the kitefin shark as Near Threatened worldwide, and as Vulnerable in the northeastern Atlantic in light of documented population declines.|$|E
