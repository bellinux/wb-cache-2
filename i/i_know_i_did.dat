500|$|In {{the general}} {{election}} of 1747, the Prince of Wales again campaigned actively for the opposition but Pelham's party won easily. Like his father before him, the Prince entertained opposition figures at his house in Leicester Square. When the Prince of Wales died suddenly in 1751, his eldest son, Prince George, became heir apparent. The king commiserated with the Dowager Princess of Wales and wept with her. As her son would not reach the age of majority until 1756, a new British Regency Act was passed to make her regent, assisted by a council led by the Duke of Cumberland, in case of George II's death. The king also made a new will, which provided for Cumberland to be sole regent in Hanover. After {{the death of his}} daughter Louisa {{at the end of the}} year, George lamented, [...] "This has been a fatal year for my family. I lost my eldest son– but I am glad of it... Now [...] is gone. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not love my children when they were young: I hated to have them running into my room; but now I love them as well as most fathers." ...|$|E

In {{an interview with}} Guitar World magazine in 2003, he stated: [...] "I can't speak for the , but for me drugs were {{an integral part of}} the whole thing, right from the beginning, right to the end." [...] After the band's 1973 North American tour, Page told Nick Kent: [...] "Oh, everyone went over the top a few times. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> and, to be honest with you, I don't really remember much of what happened." ...|$|E
2500|$|The series {{debuted in}} an hour-long format, but {{was put on}} hiatus {{only a few weeks}} into the season. CBS had moved the series to Saturday nights, which led to falling ratings. [...] When The Twilight Zone {{returned}} in December, the episodes were half-hour shows, and generally contained only one story. [...] The series was cancelled by February, with remaining episodes being aired over the summer as hour-long multi-story episodes. [...] Season 2 only ran for 11 episodes; several of the unproduced episodes would be filmed for season 3. In regard to writing for the episode [...] "The Girl I Married", J. M. DeMatteis commented [...] "I have a feeling that the show that appears will not bear much relation to what I wrote. What I've found out is that this season—unlike last, where the script was pretty much regarded as sacrosanct—the network is really interfering a lot. [...] Regardless, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> a good job and it was a real satisfying experience." ...|$|E

"Do you not? <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> <b>I</b> {{think that}} {{young men in}} society {{are bound to be}} agreeable, and that they should not be there if they {{do not know how to}} talk pleasantly, and to give {{something}} in return for all the trouble we take for them." ...|$|R

"Well, they didn't like it much, but I {{think most}} of them had a respect for him. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> He has a whole lot of assurance, an air of knowing what he's talking about, and {{apparently}} he doesn't give a continental whether he's popular or not.

Then something resembling a little grey snake, about the thickness of a walking stick, coiled up out of the writhing middle, and wriggled in the air towards me--and then another.|$|E

There was certainly no reason why I should do anything else, but when the impatient Percy started, my mind was not in the least made up; I remained on the seat beside him simply because I was there.|$|E
