50|$|On June 25, 2015, Hall, Rick, and Murdock reunited for {{the first}} time in over twenty years for a {{performance}} at Shea Stadium in Bushwick, Brooklyn. They were joined by Rachel Swaner on keyboards and accordion. The set consisted of songs from throughout the various King Missile incarnations. The original three members of King Missile played several more shows with a different keyboardist between 2015 and 2017. On February 18, 2017, keyboardist and bassist Chris Xefos rejoined the group for a performance at The <b>Gutter</b> <b>Bar</b> in Brooklyn.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Sediment {{samples were}} {{collected}} from selected <b>gutters</b> and Lagos <b>bar</b> beach for the investigation of trace element concentrations. The metals investigated were chromium, lead, arsenic, selenium, cadmium and barium using the atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The results obtained further revealed elevated concentrations metals from both selected gutters and the Lagos bar beach. It was also observed that the Lagos bar beach is {{the receiving end of}} all the pollution loads arising from the channeled gutters. These elevated trace element concentrations obtained in sediment in this study were compared with other similar studies. The sediment contaminations by metals were traceable to industries and anthropogenic substances in Lagos metropolis. @JASE...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} modern {{greenhouses}} {{is based on}} a compromise between a maximized transmission of solar radiation and a minimized heat loss within an economic context. This could be satisfied by the use of transparent double-layered zigzag plates as a covering material. The MatLight computer model was developed to compute the effect on transmission of a greenhouse cover due to the use of these plates. A greenhouse cover without construction elements such as <b>gutters</b> and glazing <b>bars,</b> with a span width of 3 ? 2 m and a roof slope of 25 Â°, was covered with a double zigzag plate. This greenhouse was proved to have a diffuse transmission loss of 1 ? 6 nd a gain in transmitted direct radiation up to 5 n winter for NS-orientation, compared with a single-glass cover. The insulation of the cover increases by 16 &Eth;This is a promising result for practical application...|$|R
