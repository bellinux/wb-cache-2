30|$|Besides cash, other {{non-cash}} {{bonds and}} financial instruments should be promoted {{to lessen the}} economic burden on mining companies. Expanding the types of bonds available can be applied gradually (Cheng 2010 a, b). Initially, some types of less “hard” bonds such as letters of credit, trust funds, <b>deposits</b> <b>of</b> <b>security,</b> {{or a combination of}} financial assurances along with cash can be available for companies to use as financial collateral. Later, other “soft” types <b>of</b> financial <b>securities</b> such as corporate assets and investments can be adopted. Self-bonding is not recommended because of the experiences in other countries of company bankruptcies and that no reserves of funds are available to complete the reclamation work (Riley and Isidore 2016; Corkery 2016). Research about bond types and their suitable conditions should also be carried out by academia.|$|R

40|$|Nine {{years ago}} the Nebraska Legislature enacted the Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act {{in an attempt to}} solve the {{pressing}} social problem presented by uncompensated victims of Nebraska automobile accidents. The Supreme Court of Nebraska in upholding the act stated that its purpose was to protect the motoring public from the operation of motor vehicles by financially irresponsible persons. The act was designed to accomplish this purpose in two ways: (1) by the direct operation of its post-accident requirements and (2) by the indirect psychological effect of inducing owners and operators of motor vehicles to purchase automobile liability insurance to escape the possibility of suspension <b>of</b> rights or <b>depositing</b> <b>of</b> <b>security</b> with the state. It is the conclusion of this writer that the act falls far short of achieving its intended objective. The {{purpose of this article is}} to discuss and evaluate the effectiveness of the Nebraska act and the supplementary and alternative plans enacted in other jurisdictions, and to advocate the adoption of a sound plan based upon compulsory automobile insurance...|$|R

40|$|This Note {{analyzes}} {{the legislative history}} <b>of</b> the <b>Securities</b> Act <b>of</b> 1933, the <b>Securities</b> Exchange Act <b>of</b> 1934, and the Banking Act of 1933 to ascertain whether Congress may have intended to include modern instruments such as high-yield time deposit savings certificates - items utilized today as alternative investment vehicles to minimize the effects of double digit inflation and interest rates. This Note examines the split among the circuits which have attempted to reconcile statutory language and congressional intent with the practicalities of the modern complex financial marketplace in determining whether promissory notes, including certificates <b>of</b> <b>deposit,</b> are <b>securities.</b> This Note concludes that Congress {{did not intend to}} cover certificates <b>of</b> <b>deposit</b> within the scope <b>of</b> the <b>securities</b> acts. Furthermore, in view of the potential over-regulation of the banking industry, courts should not stretch the statutory definition <b>of</b> a <b>security</b> to afford an additional jurisdictional means for aggrieved certificate holders to be heard before the federal bench...|$|R

Manhattan's East Side has undergone nearly continuous urban changes over the past sixty years. Kips Bay, a very small district or neighborhood in New York's midtown, went from older tenements and lofts to a higher-rise complex of apartments and, along 1 st Avenue, to Medical Row dominated by New York University and Bellevue Hospital. Virtually standing unchanged, except right on 29 th Street, are the neighborhood religious centers and the author's grade school - P. S. 116. The author lived in the 300 block on 29 th from 1934 to 1937, revisiting the neighborhood now and then. He later moved west. When he returned to the city for a year, he attended Seward Park High School in lower Manhattan. Having left Kips Bay so young - age 9 - he did not retain any friends. As a retired professor of geography, his neighborhood reconstruction and personal memoir have relied on new encounters, the Internet, and, at times, sheer luck.

40|$|This article uses {{contemporary}} {{business records}} {{to provide the}} first authoritative empirical breakdown of the general characteristics of English commercial bank lending to industrial firms in the {{three and a half}} decades before the First World War. The results confirm that the bulk of commercial bank support for industry was in the form of short-term credit. In particular, the overdraft system was operated {{in such a way as}} to provide industrial concerns with an readily accessible and flexible means of meeting cash flow and working capital requirements. A sizeable proportion of such loans required the <b>deposit</b> <b>of</b> no tangible <b>security</b> although over time this proportion declined. There were important differences in terms of collateral requirements demanded of private partnerships and limited companies, with the latter having to provide additional security to cover their limited liability status. In terms of the degree of bank involvement in the finance of industry a significant finding is that the commercial banks did lend to finance industrial fixed capital investment and, though most loans were short-term, about one-fifth were lent for two or more years through the rolling-over of short period loans. ...|$|R

40|$|Can tax regimes {{shape the}} {{incentives}} of governments {{to engage in}} or support counterinsurgency operations? India’s Maoist belt contains {{a large share of}} the country’s most valuable mineral deposits. Indian mining royalties benefit the States, but they are set by the central government. States are largely responsible for counter-insurgency operations within their territory. Therefore, the royalty regime could shape the incentive of states to support counter-insurgency efforts ien mining areas. This paper exploits the introduction of a 10 % ad valorem tax on iron ore that was responsible for a 10 -fold increase in royalty collections by the affected State governments. In a panel of district-level violence outcomes between 2007 and 2011, I find that the royalty hike was followed by a significant intensification of State violence in those districts that contain <b>deposits</b> <b>of</b> iron ore. There is no such impact for the <b>deposits</b> <b>of</b> other key minerals that were not subject to the royalty hike: bauxite and coal. These results are consistent with states taking the fiscal value of districts into account when they decide on the intensity <b>of</b> <b>security</b> operations...|$|R
