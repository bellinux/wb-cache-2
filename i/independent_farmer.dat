25|$|With the {{invention}} of agriculture, humans were able to clear sections of rainforest to produce crops, converting it to open farmland. Such people, however, obtain their food primarily from farm plots cleared from the forest and hunt and forage within the forest to supplement this. The issue arising is between the <b>independent</b> <b>farmer</b> providing for his family and the needs and wants of the globe as a whole. This issue has seen little improvement because no plan has been established for all parties to be aided.|$|E
2500|$|By 1908, much of {{the vigor}} and {{determination}} {{that went into the}} organization of the Association gradually died out due to a combination of internal and external complications. Most notably, the unfavorable land tenure system, the indolent and indifferent farmer, financial inability, and trust opposition all succeeded in the delay of progressive action. One of the most discouraging obstacles that the Association faced was the <b>independent</b> <b>farmer</b> who asserted his independence by refusing to join the association. These nonmembers, or [...] "hillbillies," [...] believed a better price could be obtained by refusing to join the association, and, in many instances, actually succeeded in obtaining significantly higher prices from the ATC representatives due to the shortage of tobacco. One representative of the American Tobacco Company remarked: [...] "What is the use of going into the association? We will give you as good and better prices than they can get for you {{and there will be no}} commissions or expenses. Sell to us direct, here is the cash for you now!" [...] Consequently, this refusal of cooperation would ultimately result in the deterioration of the public’s opinion of the Planters’ Protective Association.|$|E

60|$|It was {{a second}} to {{remember}} another phase of the matter. The sheep were not insured. All the savings of a frugal life had been dispersed at a blow; his hopes of being an <b>independent</b> <b>farmer</b> were laid low--possibly for ever.

40|$|Broiler {{farms are}} dealing with many risks, {{especially}} the risk of production due to the mortality. This study aimed to: 1) analyze the factors that affect the production of broiler chickens, 2) analyze the risks faced by broiler farmers, and 3) analyze the risk preferences of production. This study used two business patterns of broiler chicken farms, i. e. cooperation/partnership and independent. This {{study was conducted in}} Bekasi, a research area which was intentionally chosen in a consideration that the area hasg a positive population trend. There were 74 breeders involved in this study. The analysis was conducted by using Just Pope function model and utility maximization. The results suggest that the factors affecting broiler production include feeds and husks for the <b>independent</b> <b>farmers.</b> Feeds, vaccines and density are influential variables for production by the cooperative farmers. The variables that increase the production risks in the <b>independent</b> <b>farmers</b> include vaccines, labor, and husk, while the variable affecting the cooperative farmers is labor. The variable that can minimize risks for the <b>independent</b> <b>farmers</b> is feeds, while for the cooperative farmers, the variable is vaccine. The risk preference of the <b>independent</b> <b>farmers</b> on the overall input usage is the risk averse or a tendency to avoid risk. Broiler chicken farms require a counseling to improve their quality of human resources, accurate schedule of vaccine applications, and attention to husk condition in order to reduce risks.
