The neurosensory retina was isolated from retina of SD rat and it was tested by hematoxylin-eosin(HE) staining. The pathological changes of light-injured neurosensory retina was observed under transmission electron microscope.

On a cell dry weight basis, the amino acid-deprived cells produced four-to eightfold more protease(s) than did exponential cells grown in complete medium. These results demonstrate that viridans streptococci are capable of elaborating potentially damaging compounds even when their multiplication has been arrested by nutritional deprivation...|$|R
40|$|An iron-binding {{compound}} {{was isolated}} from ethyl acetate extracts <b>of</b> culture <b>supernatant</b> <b>fluids</b> <b>of</b> Pseudomonas aeruginosa and was purified by successive paper and thin-layer chromatographic procedures. The purified compound {{was characterized by}} UV, visible, infrared, and fluorescence spectroscopy. The compound possesses phenolic characteristics, {{with little or no}} similarity to dihydroxybenzoates and no indication of a hydroxamate group. P. aeruginosa synthesized the compound during active growth in culture media containing less than 5 X 10 (- 6) M added FeCl 3. When added to iron-poor cultures of P. aeruginosa, the compound promoted the growth of the bacterium and also reversed growth inhibition by the iron chelator ethylenediamine-di-(o-hydroxyphenylacetic acid) ...|$|R
40|$|Antibodies against Clostridium difficile toxin A were {{purified}} by {{affinity chromatography}} from antiserum prepared against crude C. difficile toxin preparations. The affinity-purified antibody preparation {{was free of}} detectable amounts of antibodies to other C. difficile antigens, as demonstrated by crossed immunoelectrophoresis, and specifically neutralized the cytotoxicity of toxin A. An {{indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) was subsequently developed using the antibody preparation for the specific detection of toxin A. The ELISA, which could detect 1 ng (5 ng/ml) of toxin A, was used to quantitate the toxin in the culture <b>supernatant</b> <b>fluids</b> <b>of</b> strains of C. difficile. The ELISA values for toxin A closely correlated with the toxin A and B cytotoxic titers <b>of</b> the <b>supernatant</b> <b>fluids.</b> In addition, toxin A was detected by ELISA in human fecal specimens from persons with antibiotic-associated colitis, demonstrating that this toxin is produced during C. difficile colitis...|$|R
40|$|A toxic {{phospholipase}} D (PLD) is putatively {{involved in}} pathogenesis of Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis infections. We report here the cloning and {{expression of the}} PLD gene (pld) in Escherichia coli. A cosmid library of DNA from C. pseudotuberculosis biovar ovis isolate Whetten 1 was constructed and screened for PLD-producing recombinants by plating them on LB agar containing sheep erythrocytes and equi factors. One recombinant, designated pCpO 1, yielded a gene product which displayed synergistic hemolytic and sphingomyelinase D activities, {{both of which are}} characteristic of PLD. Subcloning into pUC 19 yielded a recombinant, pCpO 50, which contained a 1. 8 -kilobase insert. Analysis <b>of</b> <b>supernatant</b> <b>fluids</b> and cell extracts of cultures of E. coli(pCpO 50) revealed sphingomyelinase activity and a protein of about 31, 000 Mr, neither of which were detected in E. coli(pUC 19). The 31 -kilodalton protein also reacted with antibodies in serum from a sheep naturally infected with C. pseudotuberculosis, serum which also contained PLD-neutralizing antibodies. When Southern blots of BamHI digests of DNA from biovar ovis and biovar equi isolates of C. pseudotuberculosis were probed with pCpO 50, bands of 4. 8 and 1. 9 kilobases, respectively, were seen, suggesting that the genome organization of pld is different for isolates from the two biovars...|$|R
