5|$|A {{large number}} of {{spin-off}} video <b>games</b> have also been made for the Final Fantasy series. These spin-off <b>games</b> vary in their relation to the main series; the first, The Final Fantasy Legend <b>games,</b> were marketed as related in North America but {{were considered to be}} the first three <b>games</b> of the SaGa series in their native Japan, and later SaGa <b>games</b> released outside Japan bear no Final Fantasy branding. Dissidia Final Fantasy, on the other hand, is a fighting game using characters from the main series exclusively. Overall, more than 30 <b>games</b> have been released as spin-offs of the main Final Fantasy series, many within their own sub-series.|$|E

5|$|ABA <b>Games</b> is a Japanese {{video game}} developer, {{composed}} solely of game designer Kenta Cho. ABA Games' works, available as open source freeware, are predominantly shoot 'em up <b>games</b> often inspired by classic <b>games</b> in the genre. Its <b>games</b> feature stylised retro graphics, innovative gameplay features and modes and {{are set in}} random rather than scripted events. These creations have been acclaimed {{as some of the}} best and well-known independent <b>games</b> available, though some commentators, including Cho himself, feel they are too simple for commercial release.|$|E
5|$|ABA Games' sole developer, Kenta Cho, {{began writing}} <b>games</b> {{as a child}} during the 1980s using the NEC PC-6001 microcomputer, as there were few commercially {{available}} <b>games.</b> After leaving university, Cho contemplated professional <b>games</b> development but ultimately instead joined Toshiba to work in multimedia research and development. He continues to work full-time for Toshiba while running ABA <b>Games</b> as a hobby, working mainly on weekends. Cho is the sole contributor to ABA <b>Games.</b> Lacking musical training, he creates the soundtracks to his <b>games</b> using commercially available, pre-made samples. ABA <b>Games</b> releases a game approximately every six months, with {{the first three months}} spent creating prototypes and the latter three spent refining a finished version.|$|E

5|$|After {{the success}} of the 1896 <b>Games,</b> the Olympics entered a period of {{stagnation}} that threatened their survival. The Olympic <b>Games</b> held at the Paris Exposition in 1900 and the Louisiana Purchase Exposition at St. Louis in 1904 were side shows. The <b>Games</b> in Paris did not have a stadium, but were notable for being the first time women took part in the <b>Games.</b> When the St. Louis <b>Games</b> were celebrated roughly 650 athletes participated, but 580 were from the United States. The homogeneous nature of these celebrations was a low point for the Olympic Movement. The <b>Games</b> rebounded when the 1906 Intercalated <b>Games</b> (so-called because they were the second <b>Games</b> held within the third Olympiad) were held in Athens. These <b>Games</b> were, but are not now, officially recognised by the IOC and no Intercalated <b>Games</b> have been held since.
