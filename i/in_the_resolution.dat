5|$|Five {{days after}} the British surrendered, Congress passed a {{resolution}} agreeing to erect a structure dedicated to commemorating {{those who participated in}} the battle. Construction of the monument was delayed, however, as the federal government had several other financial obligations that were considered to be of a more urgent nature. The battle's centennial sparked renewed enthusiasm <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>resolution</b> and prompted the government to begin building the monument in 1881 amid national support. The structure was formally erected in 1884 and currently resides within Colonial National Historical Park.|$|E
5|$|The Government of Canada {{should call}} on the United Nations Security Council to seriously engage itself <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>resolution</b> of the {{conflict}} in Sri Lanka, and to investigate the conduct of both parties during the conflict with respect to international law. The Government of Canada should also initiate {{a dialogue with the}} Government of Sri Lanka, in conjunction with the international community, aimed at laying the groundwork for a political reconciliation between the communities. If these efforts fail, the Government of Canada should consider financial and diplomatic sanctions, including, but not limited to, advocating for Sri Lanka’s suspension from the Commonwealth, as well as incentives.|$|E
5|$|Use {{of oxygen}} or sulphur as the {{nucleophilic}} atom causes minor differences in catalysis. Compared to oxygen, sulphur’s extra d orbital makes it larger (by 0.4 Å) and softer, {{allows it to}} form longer bonds (dC-X and dX-H by 1.3-fold), and gives it a lower pKa (by 5 units). Serine is therefore more dependent than cysteine on optimal orientation of the acid-base triad members to reduce its pKa {{in order to achieve}} concerted deprotonation with catalysis. The low pKa of cysteine works to its disadvantage <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>resolution</b> of the first tetrahedral intermediate as unproductive reversal of the original nucleophilic attack is the more favourable breakdown product. The triad base is therefore preferentially oriented to protonate the leaving group amide to ensure that it is ejected to leave the enzyme sulphur covalently bound to the substrate N-terminus. Finally, resolution of the acyl-enzyme (to release the substrate C-terminus) requires serine to be re-protonated whereas cysteine can leave as S−. Sterically, the sulphur of cysteine also forms longer bonds and has a bulkier van der Waals radius and if mutated to serine can be trapped in unproductive orientations in the active site.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> Security Council’s <b>resolution</b> 1325 {{addressed}} <b>the</b> major {{negative impact}} that armed conflict has {{on women and}} children. This <b>in</b> turn complicates <b>the</b> Council’s work on maintaining international peace and security. <b>The</b> <b>resolution</b> therefore highlights women’s rights as participants in peace- and conflict processes. The aim of this thesis was to analyze how gender is expressed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United Nations’ Security Council’s <b>resolutions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area of Women, Peace and Security. I investigated the way <b>the</b> rhetoric language <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>resolutions</b> produce and reproduce gender stereotype conceptions about women and men, and further what this means in a political security context. In this way I generate knowledge about what security is and who security is for as outlined <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>resolutions.</b> Through a discursive perspective I investigate power relations between security identities that are constructed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>resolutions.</b> My results indicate that stereotypical conceptions about masculinity and femininity are produced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Security Council’s <b>resolutions.</b> Through <b>the</b> discursive reading of <b>the</b> <b>resolutions</b> I also {{found out that the}} sovereignty of the State remains a challenge for the Council’s work to maintain international peace and security. This because the State is a gendered organization, which in a traditional security context, excludes women. I further conclude that the security issues that are expressed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>resolutions</b> reproduce inequalities between women and men since the language of the Council stereotypes traditional ways of seeing gender as dichotomies of perpetrator/victim, aggressive/peaceful...|$|R

The G10 Governors created the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision (BCBS), which remains active to this day.
