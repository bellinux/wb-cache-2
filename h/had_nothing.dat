5|$|Guiteau came {{to believe}} he had lost the {{position}} {{because he was a}} Stalwart. The office-seeker decided {{that the only way to}} end the internecine warfare in the Republican Party was for Garfield to die—though he <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> personal against the president. Arthur's succession would restore peace, he felt, and lead to rewards for fellow Stalwarts, including Guiteau.|$|E

5|$|Another {{factor in}} the Mellotron's sound is that the {{individual}} notes were recorded in isolation. For a musician accustomed to playing in an orchestral setting, this was unusual, and meant that they <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> against which to intonate. Noted cellist Reginald Kirby refused to downtune his cello to cover the lower range of the Mellotron, and so the bottom notes are actually performed on a double bass. According to Mellotron author Nick Awde, one note of the string sounds contains {{the sound of a}} chair being scraped in the background.|$|E

5|$|By {{the turn}} of the twentieth century the church had little to show from its earlier history, or indeed of its former wealth, beyond the great size of the church. The church was {{relatively}} plainly decorated – see below – and <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> by way of old fittings, plate or vestments. Amongst its liturgical plate were a chalice of 1788, an alms plate of 1839, a set of chalice, paten and flagon of 1841, and a silver mounted glass cruet of 1909.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{being the}} draft {{that got the}} film green-lit, Straczynski's script was tossed aside. Production was to begin {{at the start of}} 2009, but was delayed while the script was {{completely}} re-written by Matthew Michael Carnahan to set the film in the present, leaving behind much of the book's premise to make it more of an action film. In a 2012 interview, Brooks stated the film now <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> in common with the novel other than the title. Filming commenced mid-2011, and the film was released in June 2013.|$|E
5|$|During the negotiations, the {{relatives}} {{of several of the}} West Side Boys were brought to the gang's camp to ask them to release the British soldiers.

5|$|Parker and Stone {{were very}} happy with the episode, but {{received}} feedback from fans {{that it was one of}} the weaker episodes of the first season, and that the constant jokes about Barbra Streisand started to grow redundant.
