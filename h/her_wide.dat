5|$|The project's {{finalization}} {{lasted for}} two years due to {{the intention of the}} team behind it to improve it as much as possible. According to Gočeva and the producer Micevski, the group's members' acquaintance with each other helped them in setting the right musical direction with the recording of Makedonsko Devojče 2. Musically, the album is similar to its predecessor; the songs are characterized by elements of Macedonian traditional music, but are adapted to a modern style which is contemporary {{at the time of the}} release of the album, thus intertwining pop and jazz elements. The lyrics cover emotional states of sadness, happiness, love and longing experienced by a mellow woman. The songs were written and composed specifically for Gočeva, taking into account <b>her</b> <b>wide</b> vocal range and musical versatility; all of them are sang without using any backing vocals.|$|E

25|$|The {{maiden voyage}} of the Livadia {{revealed}} that <b>her</b> <b>wide</b> flat bottom was highly prone to damage by wave slamming. She spent her brief {{career as a}} yacht in the docks and was used for her intended purpose only once, carrying Grand Dukes Constantine and Mikhail across the Black Sea. Alexander III {{had no interest in}} resurrecting an inherently flawed ship, and in August 1881 Livadia was moored in Nikolaev and then hulked and stripped of her former luxuries.

25|$|As {{the product}} of a morganatic marriage, and without {{succession}} rights to the throne, Francis was not acceptable as a husband for princesses in most of the European royal houses. He further had little income in comparison with other European princes. He thus married into a richer family, by marrying his father's third cousin (in descent from King George II of Great Britain) Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge, the younger daughter of Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge, and a granddaughter of George III, who was known as 'Fat Mary' because of <b>her</b> <b>wide</b> girth. That, together with {{the fact that she was}} (by 1866) already in her thirties, meant that Mary Adelaide was also short of choices for marriage.|$|E
25|$|Goldmark's {{interest}} in the subject of the Queen of Sheba was inspired by his pupil, mezzo-soprano Caroline von Gomperz-Bettelheim, whose beauty was once compared to that of the Queen of Sheba by a friend of Goldmark. Bettelheim possessed a striking voice and the role was written to show off <b>her</b> <b>wide</b> range and dramatic skills. However, Bettelheim never performed the role, as the opera took twelve years {{to make it to the}} stage. Goldmark began working on the opera in 1863, but the first working libretto proved unsuitable. Mosenthal's libretto was provided two years later, but Goldmark was not satisfied with the happy ending. After some deliberation, Goldmark rewrote the ending of the opera to finish with the tragic death of Assad.|$|E
