60|$|The French have no front gardens; but <b>the</b> <b>street</b> {{is every}} man's front garden. There are trees <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> and {{sometimes}} fountains. <b>The</b> <b>street</b> is <b>the</b> Frenchman's tavern, for he drinks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> It is his dining-room, for he dines <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> It is his British Museum, for the statues and monuments in French streets are not, as with us, of the worst, {{but of the}} best, art of the country, and they are often actually as historical as <b>the</b> Pyramids. <b>The</b> <b>street</b> again is <b>the</b> Frenchman's Parliament, for France has never taken its Chamber of Deputies so seriously as we take our House of Commons, and the quibbles of mere elected nonentities in an official room seem feeble to a people whose fathers have heard the voice of Desmoulins like a trumpet under open heaven, or Victor Hugo shouting from his carriage amid {{the wreck of the}} second Republic. And as <b>the</b> Frenchman drinks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> and dines <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> so also he fights <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> and dies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> so that <b>the</b> <b>street</b> can never be commonplace to him.|$|R

5|$|Around the {{painting}} lie corpses {{in various states}} of undress. The Destroying Angel was painted shortly after Etty's visit to Paris in which he had witnessed the July Revolution at first hand, and the sight and smell of the dead <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> had left a strong impression on him. The heaped bodies in The Destroying Angel were probably directly inspired by the events Etty had witnessed in France, and perhaps also by the cholera epidemic which killed thousands in London in 1832.|$|E

Following his move to France, Comminges attended Louis Thuillier High School in Amiens.|$|E

So we love Snoop and we wish he had been here, but I think shooting him in L.A. will be good because we'll have more time, more control. He probably would have gotten really mobbed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> here anyway.|$|E
