He signed his first professional contract with Tottenham Hotspur in 1985, {{but was unable to}} gain a regular place in the team. In 1989, he moved on to Newcastle United, where he made over 80 appearances in the Football League. He later played for Portsmouth, Southend United and Leyton Orient before <b>dropping</b> <b>into</b> non-League football.|$|E
5|$|Cardiff were relegated for {{the first}} time in their history in 1929 and entered a period of decline, <b>dropping</b> <b>into</b> the third tier two years later. The club did manage to return to the top tier in 1952, but their relegation in 1962 led to a decline in the club's {{fortunes}} that saw them outside the top division for 51 years, the longest absence in the club's history, not returning until 2013. Relegation from Division Two in the 1984–85 season saw the club enter a downward period that culminated with their joint lowest ever finish in the Football League, 22nd in the fourth tier in the 1995–96 season.|$|E

Stuart went on to gain promotion back into the Football League with AFC Wimbledon, before dropping back into non-League with Sutton United and Margate - where he went on to become player/assistant manager.|$|E

5|$|After <b>dropping</b> <b>into</b> the Third Division, Cardiff were {{continuously}} in {{the lower}} two divisions of the Football League between 1985 and 1993 as the club appointed several managers in attempts to stabilize the team's performances. They were relegated to the Fourth Division once in the 1985–86 season and, despite returning to the Third Division on two occasions, in 1996 finished in their lowest-ever league position– 22nd of 24 in Division Three. In 1995, Cardiff and other Welsh clubs competing in English leagues were banned from entering the Welsh Cup by the Football Association of Wales after pressure from UEFA, {{who did not want}} teams playing in two national cup competitions. Their final match in the competition was a 2–1 defeat to Wrexham in the 1995 final.|$|E
5|$|Aesthetically, {{the game}} used Fire Emblem {{elements}} as motifs, but took its setting and premise of {{a clash between}} worlds from Shin Megami Tensei. The battle system was originally going {{to be similar to}} a Fire Emblem game, but while it did incorporate elements such as the Weapon Triangle, it ultimately became a turn-based RPG battle system. After Atlus was made primary developer, the story was set in modern-day Tokyo and written around a group of young people facing challenges together. Its upbeat focus on character drama was a deliberate shift away from the dark scenarios of the Megami Tensei series. The game takes place in multiple locations around Tokyo, including Shibuya and Harajuku. The modern setting provided challenges for incorporating Fire Emblem characters, as characters in medieval armor just <b>dropping</b> <b>into</b> a modern setting would have looked strange. Among the considered possibilities were introducing Fire Emblem characters as human party members. In the end, it was decided to make them summoned helpers similar to the demons of Shin Megami Tensei, drawn into the real world from their Idolosphere dimension.|$|E
5|$|The {{crinoline}} {{needed to}} be rigid enough to support the skirts in their accustomed shape, but also flexible enough to be temporarily pressed out of shape and spring back afterwards. Other materials used for crinolines included whalebone, gutta-percha and vulcanised caoutchouc (natural rubber). The idea of inflatable hoops was short-lived as they were easily punctured, prone to collapse, and due {{to the use of}} brimstone in the manufacture of rubber, they smelled unpleasant. Although hard rubber hoops of gutta-percha worked satisfactorily at first, they were brittle and easily crushed without recovering their form. Despite objections that the sharp points of snapped steels were hazardous, lightweight steel was clearly the most successful option. It reduced the number of petticoats and their weight, and offered increased freedom of movement of the legs. However, hasty or careless movements in a hoop skirt could lead to accidentally revealing more than intended. An advertisement published in The Lady's Newspaper in 1863 for a cage crinoline with waved hoops attempted to reassure the potential customer that while wearing it, activities such as climbing stairs, passing to her theatre seat, <b>dropping</b> <b>into</b> armchairs and leaning against furniture would be possible without hindrance either to herself or to others around her.|$|E

5|$|York were relegated {{from the}} Second Division in 1998–99, after <b>dropping</b> <b>into</b> 21st {{place on the}} last day of the season. In December 2001, long-serving {{chairman}} Douglas Craig put the club and its ground up for sale for £4.5million, before announcing that the club would resign from the Football League if a buyer was not found. Motor racing driver John Batchelor took over the club in March 2002, and by December the club had gone into administration. The Supporters' Trust (ST) bought the club in March 2003 after an offer of £100,000 as payment for £160,000 owed in tax was accepted by the Inland Revenue. Batchelor left having diverted almost all of the £400,000 received from a sponsorship deal with Persimmon to his racing team, and having failed to deliver on his promise of having ST members on the board. York failed to win any of their final 20 league fixtures in 2003–04 and finished bottom of the Third Division. This meant the club was relegated to the Football Conference, ending 75 years of Football League membership.|$|E
5|$|The side {{also won}} the Welsh Cup in 1927 {{defeating}} Rhyl 2–0 and {{would go on to}} win the FA Charity Shield after beating amateur side the Corinthians 2–1 at Stamford Bridge. However, the club soon entered a decline after their cup success and were relegated from the First Division in the 1928–29 season, despite conceding fewer goals than any other side in the division, and suffered a second relegation two years later, <b>dropping</b> <b>into</b> the Third Division South {{for the first time since}} they joined the Football League. During their time in the division, Cardiff recorded their biggest ever win when they beat Thames by a scoreline of 9–2 but, after finishing the 1932–33 season in 19th place, manager Fred Stewart tendered his resignation from his post after 22 years in charge of the team. Club founder Bartley Wilson stepped in to replace Stewart; however the results continued to be disappointing, and in March 1934, Ben Watts-Jones was given the opportunity to manage the club he had supported as a youngster. However, he was unable to turn the team's fortunes around by the end of the season, meaning Cardiff City were forced to apply for re-election after finishing bottom of the division. Watts-Jones remained in charge for another three years until he was replaced by Bill Jennings but Cardiff remained in the Third Division South until the Football League was suspended following the outbreak of World War II.|$|E

The club reached the final, defeating Panathinaikos, Werder Bremen, Sporting Lisbon and Fiorentina along the way. The final in Manchester against Zenit St. Petersburg, who were managed by former Rangers manager Dick Advocaat, ended in a 2–0 defeat. An estimated 200,000 supporters travelled to Manchester for the event, and some disorder occurred.|$|E

25|$|The {{existing}} {{majorities in}} the bodies {{on the different}} levels of church organisation remained, since in the synods the majority of German Christian synodals had voted for an abolition of further church elections. Parishioners' democratic participation by elections only re-emerged {{after the end of}} the Nazi reign. The Nazi government preferred the Protestant church bodies to weaken their influence in Germany by letting them enter into a destructive self-deprecation, once in while orchestrated by Nazi government interference in favour of the German Christians, but mostly in favour of the Protestant church bodies' <b>dropping</b> <b>into</b> insignificance.|$|E
25|$|Adam Johnson was {{recalled}} {{from his}} successful loan spell at Watford (where he scored 5 goals in 11 games) {{in time for}} the home game versus Aston Villa. He was immediately restored to the starting line-up, beginning the game on the left with Downing moving up front. Boro started well but conceded just before half time, and again just after the break, with the third going in ten minutes later. Astonishingly despite the 0–3 defeat, Middlesbrough avoided <b>dropping</b> <b>into</b> the bottom three: Bolton won versus Manchester United and moved out of the drop zone, but Sunderland's 1–7 defeat at Everton dropped them below the Boro on goal difference.|$|E
25|$|As reigning champions, Basel were favourites {{to retain}} their league title and as Swiss champions, they entered the Champions League in the third {{qualifying}} round. They were drawn against Internazionale, however, and lost 5–2 on aggregate, subsequently <b>dropping</b> <b>into</b> the UEFA Cup. In {{the first round of}} the UEFA Cup, Basel defeated the Russian side Terek Grozny 3–1 on aggregate. In the group stage, they faced considerabley tougher opponents, being drawn in Group E with Feyenoord, Schalke 04, Ferencváros and Hearts. They finished third in the group on seven points and qualified for the Round of 32, where they were defeated 2–0 on aggregate by Lille.|$|E

25|$|The club's struggles {{continued}} {{after their}} relegation to the 2. Bundesliga. Needing an away win {{in their final}} match {{of the season in}} order to avoid being sent down to the Regionalliga Süd (III), they instead went down to a 0:3 defeat to Karlsruher SC and finished in 15th place. They re-bounded the following season, taking the Regionalliga title, and making their way back to second division competition. Subsequently, 'Haching' has delivered poor results in the 2. Bundesliga, narrowly avoiding being relegated again in both 2004 and 2006 before finally <b>dropping</b> <b>into</b> the Regionalliga in 2007, finishing 16th in the table due to FC Carl Zeiss Jena's 2–1 win against FC Augsburg.|$|E
25|$|The {{flying boat}} squadrons {{operating}} from Pembroke Dock, were occupied with {{a myriad of}} tasks during the Second World War. Principal among these was Air Sea Rescue (ASR) with which most aircraft were equipped with Lindholme Gear for <b>dropping</b> <b>into</b> the sea for downed aircrews. The squadron also had responsibility for convoy escort duties in the Atlantic and also as hunter killers in Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW). On 2 June 1943, a Short Sunderland of No 461 Squadron (11 Crew, 9 Australian, 2 British) was attacked whilst on an ASR patrol over the Bay of Biscay by 8 Junkers 88 fighter aircraft. The Sunderland had been searching the Bay of Biscay area for a downed BOAC aircraft that had been shot down over that area the previous day (and included amongst its passenger manifest the actor Leslie Howard) when it was attacked by the Luftwaffe. The crew managed to down three of the enemy aircraft, but limped home with an airframe like a colander due to the strafing bullet runs that the Junkers 88s had taken against it. The aircraft was landed hard at Praa Sands in Cornwall and whilst most of the crew were injured, {{there was only one}} fatality. The tide destroyed the airframe the next day.|$|E
