Crono's mother accidentally enters the time gate at the fair before it closes, {{prompting}} Crono, Marle, and Lucca to {{set out in the}} Epoch to find her while fireworks light up the night sky. Alternatively, if the party used the Epoch to break Lavos's outer shell, Marle will help her father hang Nadia's bell at the festival and accidentally get carried away by several balloons. Crono jumps on to help her, but cannot bring them <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>earth.</b> Hanging on in each other's arms, the pair travel through the cloudy, moonlit sky.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before the}} band {{embarked}} on a European tour {{in the summer of}} 1998, Ward suffered a heart attack and was temporarily replaced by former drummer Vinny Appice. Ward returned in time for the US tour with openers Pantera, which began in January 1999 and continued through the summer, headlining the annual Ozzfest tour. Following the Ozzfest appearances, the band was put on hiatus while members worked on solo material. Tony Iommi released his first official solo album, Iommi, in 2000, while Osbourne continued work on his next solo release, <b>Down</b> <b>to</b> <b>Earth.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of their warming effects when {{relatively}} thin, cirrus clouds have been implicated as a potential partial cause of global warming. Scientists have speculated that global warming could cause high thin cloud cover to increase, thereby increasing temperatures and humidity. This, in turn, would increase the cirrus cloud cover, effectively creating a positive feedback circuit. A prediction of this hypothesis is that the cirrus would move higher as the temperatures rose, increasing the volume of air underneath the clouds and the amount of infrared radiation reflected back <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>earth.</b> In addition, the hypothesis suggests that the increase in temperature would tend to increase the size of the ice crystals in the cirrus cloud, possibly causing the reflection of solar radiation and the reflection of the Earth's infrared radiation to balance out.|$|E

5|$|In {{promoting}} the series, both Piper and Eccleston stressed Rose's heroic characteristics whilst Davies highlighted her <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>earth</b> qualities and quintessential Britishness. Critical reaction {{noted that the}} character was more developed, independent and equal to the Doctor than previous companions had been, whilst the character's overall role in the narrative {{of the first two}} series was praised. However, reaction to the character's 2008 return was more mixed. Piper won numerous awards for her portrayal of Rose—including two National Television Awards—and since her initial role in the series, the character has ranked highly in numerous 'best companion' polls. After leaving as a series regular, Piper experienced success in other high-profile roles as an actress which has been partly attributed to her performances in Doctor Who.|$|E
5|$|The {{momentum}} {{behind the}} NWOBHM also benefited already established bands, which reclaimed the spotlight with new and acclaimed releases. Ex-Deep Purple singer Ian Gillan returned to sing heavy metal with the album Mr. Universe in 1979 {{and was on}} the forefront of the British metal scene with his band Gillan in the following years. His former Deep Purple bandmate Ritchie Blackmore also climbed the UK charts with his hard rock group Rainbow's releases <b>Down</b> <b>to</b> <b>Earth</b> (1979) and Difficult to Cure (1981). Black Sabbath recovered and returned to success with the albums Heaven and Hell (1980) and Mob Rules (1981), featuring the ex-Rainbow singer Ronnie James Dio. 1980 saw several other entries by hard rock and heavy metal bands in the top 10 of the British charts: MSG's first album peaked at No.8, Whitesnake's Ready an' Willing at No.6, Judas Priest's best-seller British Steel and Motörhead's Ace of Spades at No.4, while Back in Black by AC/DC reached number one.|$|E
