40|$|This paper {{gives the}} results of 27 {{laboratory}} measurements of the sound insulation of 75 mm thick tongue and groove autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) panels with stated nominal dry density of 510 kg/m 3 (a surface density of 38. 2 kg/m 2). which are lined with 13 mm thick gypsum plasterboard. Two configurations that are presently common forms of construction in a region of Australia were tested; 1. <b>Furring</b> <b>channel</b> one side and stud wall the other that maintained an overall wall width of 243 mm, and 2. Direct fix one side and stud wall the other. In both cases the gypsum plasterboard is mounted on 64 mm steel studs. The gap between the panels and the steel studs is 20, 35 or 48 mm. With {{the exception of one}} empty cavity, the cavity on this side contains 11 kg/m 3 glass fibre batts with thickness of 50, 75, 90 or 110 mm. On {{the other side of the}} panels, the gypsum plasterboard is mounted on furring channels and adjustable clips which are screwed to the panels or in 6 cases directly screwed to the panels. Except for the directly screwed cases, the gap between the panels and the gypsum plasterboard is 30, 43 or 58 mm. The cavity is empty or contains 50 or 70 mm thick 11 kg/m 3 glass fibre batts or 25 mm thick 24 kg/m 3 glass fibre batts. The 13 mm gypsum plasterboard has nominal surface densities of 7. 2, 8. 5 or 10. 5 kg/m 2. The aim was to develop a system which has a laboratory measured Rw+Ctr equal to or greater than 50 dB which is required by the National Construction Code (NCC) of Australia for walls between separate dwellings. A system with cavities on both sides of the wall is desirable because it allows services to be accommodated without the need for chasing which is not permitted. The undesirable effect is a resultant large Ctr making it difficult to achieve an Rw +Ctr equal to or greater than 50 dB...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{shows how}} to use a {{mathematical}} model to predict the vibration of lightweight timber-framed floor/ceiling systems (LTFSs) caused by mechanical excitation. The LTFS considered here is made up of an upper floor layer, a cavity space with timber joists and a ceiling. These components are joined by timber battens, ceiling <b>furring</b> <b>channels</b> and ceiling clips. The vibration in the structure is caused by a localized excitation on the top surface and the resulting vibration level of the ceiling surface will be analysed. The cavity space is filled with fibre infill for damping the sound transmitting through the cavity. A unique feature of the design and the model is the sand-sawdust mixture in the upper layer. The theoretical model and the experimental measurements show that the sand-sawdust dampens the vibration in the frequency range between 10 and 200 Hz. The damping by the sand-sawdust and the fibre infill are found by comparing the numerical simulations against the experimental measurements. We show that the simple linear frequency dependent loss factors can be used to predict the low-frequency vibrations of LTFSs...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{multicarrier}} techniques are {{considered in the}} context of the future wideband wireless networks. An overview of the different access schemes based on a combination of code division and multicarrier techniques, such as multi-carrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA), multi-carrier direct sequence CDMA (MC-DS-CDMA) and multi-tone CDMA (MT-CDMA) is presented first. Afterwards, MC-CDMA systems are considered for the downlink of high rate cellular networks. The performance of different mono-user detection techniques are first analytically estimated and then compared with the help of Monte Carlo simulations <b>fur</b> a Rayleigh <b>channel.</b> Simulation results on the performance of mono-user and multi-user detection techniques are also provided for bad urban (BU) hilly terrain (HT) and vehicular UMTS channels. With regard to the channel coding, convolutional codes and turbo-codes are considered. Among others, a new linear detection technique named global minimum mean square error algorithm (GMMSE) is compared to multi-user parallel interference cancellation detection technique. It is shown that GMMSE offers good pemfurmance especially for non-full load systems. Thus, the efficiency of MC-CDMA as a very promising multiple access and robust modulation scheme is successfully demonstrated for the downlink of the future wideband mobile networks...|$|R
40|$|By {{deploying}} a {{data logger}} {{specifically designed for}} the purpose, {{it was possible to}} record heart rate, fH (beats/min), from free-ranging gentoo penguins, Pygoscelis papua, and Antarctic fur seals, Arctocephalus gazella, at the British Antarctic Survey Base at Bird Island. The heart rate data were then converted into oxygen consumption (VO 2, mlO 2 min- 1 kg- 1) and/or energy expenditure (W/kg) using equations that had been derived from calibration experiments. In these experiments the relationships between fH and VO 2 were determined in animals at rest and while exercising at different levels on a treadmill or in a static water channel (penguins) and in a variable speed flume (California sea lions, Zalophus californianus, as surrogate fur seals) or in a static water <b>channel</b> (<b>fur</b> seals). The validity of using these relationships was tested by recording simultaneously fH, VO 2 by direct respirometry and VCO 2 by the doubly labelled water (DLW) technique in six penguins and in six California sea lions during 72 h and 24 h, respectively, at various levels of activity. For the penguins, both indirect methods gave mean algebraic errors within 2 % of the measured VO 2, whereas for the sea lions, the mean algebraic errors were 36. 4 % for the DLW method and 2. 7 % for the fH method. The range of errors was greater for the DLW method, in both species. Field data from 15 penguins indicate that the fH method provides data that are comparable to those obtained using the DLW method, but with the added advantage that they can be broken down into the energy costs for specific types of behaviour. The implanted data loggers also recorded the temperature of the abdominal cavity (T(ab)) and it was evident that this routinely decreased by approximately 2 degrees C during diving bouts and by a maximum of almost 5 degrees C. Such temperature decreases, particularly if representative of similar decreases in other tissues, may at least partly explain why the energy costs of travelling to and from the foraging site and of foraging itself are similar to those for penguins resting in water at 5 degrees C. Field data from 15 female fur seals indicate that, when the animals are ashore, there is good agreement between the values for mean energy expenditure obtained by the fH and DLW methods. However, when the animals are at sea, the values obtained by DLW are substantially greater than those obtained by fH. When the at-sea values are corrected for the apparent overestimations referred to above, there is good agreement between the data obtained using the two methods. The data derived from fH indicate that, as with the penguins, the energy expenditures during travelling to and from the foraging site and during foraging {{are similar to those of}} fur seals resting in water at 7 degrees C...|$|R
