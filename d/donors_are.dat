5|$|Blood {{transfusion}} {{was formerly}} the second-most common {{mode of transmission}} for Chagas disease, but {{the development and implementation}} of blood bank screening tests has dramatically reduced this risk in the 21st century. Blood donations in all endemic Latin American countries undergo Chagas screening, and testing is expanding in countries, such as France, Spain and the United States, that have significant or growing populations of immigrants from endemic areas. In Spain, <b>donors</b> <b>are</b> evaluated with a questionnaire to identify individuals at risk of Chagas exposure for screening tests.|$|E
5|$|Lithotrophic {{bacteria}} can use inorganic compounds {{as a source}} of energy. Common inorganic electron <b>donors</b> <b>are</b> hydrogen, carbon monoxide, ammonia (leading to nitrification), ferrous iron and other reduced metal ions, and several reduced sulfur compounds. In unusual circumstances, the gas methane can be used by methanotrophic bacteria as both a source of electrons and a substrate for carbon anabolism. In both aerobic phototrophy and chemolithotrophy, oxygen is used as a terminal electron acceptor, whereas under anaerobic conditions inorganic compounds are used instead. Most lithotrophic organisms are autotrophic, whereas organotrophic organisms are heterotrophic.|$|E

5|$|The {{work may}} have been {{intended}} for private devotion, perhaps as a portable altarpiece for a migrant cleric. That the frames are so richly decorated with Latin inscriptions indicates that the donor, whose identity is lost, was highly educated and cultured. Because {{of a lack of}} surviving documentary evidence on commissions of 15thcentury-Northern painting, the identities of <b>donors</b> <b>are</b> often established through evidence gathered by modern art historians. In this work, damaged coats of arms on the borders of the interior wings have been identified with the Giustiniani of Genoa– an influential albergo active from 1362– who established trade links with Bruges as early as the mid-14th century.|$|E
5|$|In acidic aqueous solution, thorium {{occurs as}} the tetrapositive aqua ion 4+, which has tricapped {{trigonal}} prismatic molecular geometry: at pH<3, the solutions of thorium salts {{are dominated by}} this cation. The Th4+ ion is {{the largest of the}} tetrapositive actinide ions, and depending on the coordination number can have a radius between 0.95and1.14Å. It is quite acidic due to its high charge, slightly stronger than sulfurous acid: thus it tends to undergo hydrolysis and polymerisation (though to a lesser extent than Fe3+), predominantly to 6+ in solutions with pH 3 or below, but in more alkaline solution polymerisation continues until the gelatinous hydroxide Th(OH)4 forms and precipitates out (though equilibrium may take weeks to be reached, because the polymerisation usually slows down before the precipitation). As a hard Lewis acid, Th4+ favours hard ligands with oxygen atoms as donors: complexes with sulfur atoms as <b>donors</b> <b>are</b> less stable and are more prone to hydrolysis.|$|E
5|$|The {{exterior}} {{consists of}} the two donor wings, a pair of saints, and two panels with Gabriel presenting himself to Mary. The <b>donors</b> <b>are</b> on the outer wings, kneeling in front of prayer books. Four imitation statues in grisaille make up the inner panels. The lower two depict Saint Sebastian and Saint Anthony. Sebastian was the saint of plagues and an intercessory against epidemics, Anthony {{the patron saint of}} skin diseases and ergotism, known in medieval times as St Anthony's Fire. The two saints had strong associations with the Burgundian court as well: Philip the Good was born on St Anthony's day, he had an illegitimate son named Anthony, and two of Rolin's sons were named Anthony. St Sebastian was the patron saint of Philip the Good's chivalric Order of the Golden Fleece, of which Rolin was a member.|$|E

25|$|Today in the {{developed}} world, most blood <b>donors</b> <b>are</b> unpaid volunteers who donate blood for a community supply. In poorer countries, established supplies are limited and donors usually give blood when family or friends need a transfusion (directed donation).

Donors can also have blood drawn for their own future use (autologous donation). Donating is relatively safe, but some donors have bruising where the needle is inserted or may feel faint.|$|E

40|$|Background: Detection of {{specific}} antibodies to Treponema pallidum in serum is correlated with present or past Syphilis.

Methods: A total of 24, 000 blood <b>donors</b> <b>were</b> screened to detect the presence {{of specific}} antibodies against T. pallidum by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) according to standard test kit protocol. Initially reactive samples were reconfirmed by repeat testing and repeatedly reactive samples were considered seropositive for Syphilis. Results: The seroprevalence of specific antibodies to T. pallidum among blood <b>donors</b> <b>was</b> found 0. 42 % (95 % CI= 0. 3 - 0. 5 %). There was an increasing trends of syphilis as {{the age of the}} donors increased (Cochrane-armitage test, P 0. 05), in first time <b>donors</b> <b>was</b> 0. 36 % and in repeated <b>donors</b> <b>was</b> 0. 48 % (P> 0. 05), among volunteer <b>donors</b> <b>was</b> 0. 41 % and among replacement <b>donors</b> <b>was</b> 0. 50 % (P> 0. 05).

40|$|Background: One of the {{responsibilities}} of blood center is to provide safety to blood <b>donors.</b> It <b>is</b> mandatory to screen a blood donor for hemoglobin (Hb) or hematocrit which should not be less than 12. 5 g/dl or 38 % Hct. Most commonly applied method for hemoglobin estimation is copper sulphate method, but this method has chances of false acceptance as well as false deferral. In order to avoid this chance of error, digital hemoglobinometer is used. This study was planned to analyze effect of application of digital hemoglobinometer for detection of Hb on <b>donors,</b> who <b>are</b> deferred by copper sulphate method. Materials and Methods: Total 35, 339 voluntary non renumareted altruistic <b>donors</b> <b>were</b> {{included in this study}} between the periods of September 2005 to July 2006. Total deferred <b>donors</b> <b>were</b> 8622 (24. 39 %) and donors deferred due to hemoglobin by copper sulphate method were 4391 (50. 92 %). Digital hemoglobinometer was applied on 3163 deferred donors (72. 03 %). Results of digital hemoglobinometer were validated by known controls. Result: Digital hemoglobinometer was applied on 3163 <b>donors</b> who <b>were</b> deferred by copper sulphate method. Out of this, donors accepted by digital hemoglobinometer were 1196 (37. 01 %). Total repeat <b>donors</b> <b>were</b> 629 (52. 50 %) and first time were 567 (47. 40 %). Male <b>donors</b> <b>were</b> 891 (74. 44 %) and females were 305 (25. 50 %). Donors deferred with digital hemoglobinometer were 2135, out of them 1097 (51. 14 %) were repeat, 1038 (48. 38 %) were first time, 1349 (60. 79 %) were male, 786 (34. 47 %) <b>donors</b> <b>were</b> female <b>donors.</b> Range of hemoglobin in deferred <b>donors</b> <b>was</b> 7. 0 to 12. 4 and in accepted donors 12. 5 to 16. 4. Conclusion: By the application of digital hemoglobinometer 37. 81 % <b>donors</b> <b>were</b> found hemoglobin > 12. 5 which were deferred with copper sulphate method and unnecessary deferral of <b>donors</b> can <b>be</b> reduced to a great extent.
