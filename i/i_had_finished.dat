25|$|Such {{moments in}} life are just as memorable as when one is {{appointed}} to prominent positions. When my comrades took farewell to me, I was equally moved as I had ever been when I was given an important office. What I thought most about was that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>finished</b> my duties towards the people, the Party and the state. This memory is very precious to me.|$|E
500|$|Scurvy curs! {{they were}} my abhorrence; I should have liked {{nothing better than to}} have been the death of every one of them. In fact, on one occasion, I intimated the propriety of a canine crusade to Mehevi; but the benevolent king would not consent to it. He heard me very patiently; but when <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>finished,</b> shook his head, and told me, in confidence, that they were [...] "taboo".|$|E
500|$|Levin's {{interest}} in indexes developed {{from his work}} on The Pendulum Years. He compiled his own index for the book, [...] "and swore a mighty oath, when <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>finished</b> the task, that I would rather die, and in a particularly unpleasant manner, than do it again". He contrived to include in his index an obscene joke {{at the expense of}} the hapless prosecutor in the Chatterley trial, but found the difficulty of indexing so great that he became a champion of the Society of Indexers. [...] He wrote several articles on the subject, and when reviewing books made a point of praising good indexes and condemning bad ones.|$|E

2500|$|My father, after <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>finished</b> {{saying what}} I have {{repeated}} above, {{looked at me}} a moment, raised his hand above his head and slowly said, with tears glistening in his eyes: [...] "My son, I can swear before high heaven that what I have {{told you about the}} origin of [...] is true. Your mother and sister, Mrs. Athalia Robinson, were present when that book was handed to me in Mentor, Ohio, and all I ever knew about the origin of [...] was what Parley P. Pratt, Oliver Cowdery, Joseph Smith and the witnesses who claimed they saw the plates have told me, and in all of my intimacy with Joseph Smith he never told me but one story." ...|$|E
2500|$|He said he {{was left}} {{exhausted}} and depressed by his dealings with Kasenetz and Katz. [...] "In the mornings I {{would go into the}} office and start writing and after <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>finished</b> one song in a day, which was very high output for me, they'd {{come up to me and}} say: 'Give us another song!' And I'd say 'OK' – because I'm like that. They'd keep up the pressure so that I kept on writing. I was there in their offices working like that for six or eight weeks and when I flew home to Manchester I went straight round to see my doctor. I was feeling sick and could not eat. The doctor told me: 'You are totally over-worked.' I don't think I've ever felt so depressed as I did when I came back from New York." ...|$|E
2500|$|This theory {{contradicts the}} {{testimony}} of Rigdon to his son John, just prior to his death and long after he had ceased an affiliation {{with any of the}} sects of Mormonism: [...] "My father, after <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>finished</b> saying what I have repeated above, looked at me a moment, raised his hand above his head and slowly said, with tears glistening in his eyes: 'My son, I can swear before high heaven that what I have told you about the origin of [...] is true.

2500|$|He {{began and}} {{finished}} {{composition of the}} Symphonie fantastique in 1830, a work which would bring Berlioz much fame and notoriety. He entered into a relationship with– and subsequently became engaged to– Marie Moke, despite the symphony being inspired by Berlioz's obsession with Harriet Smithson. As his fourth cantata for submittal to the Prix de Rome neared completion, the July Revolution began. [...] "I was finishing my cantata when the revolution broke out," [...] he recorded in his Mémoires. [...] "I dashed off the final pages of my orchestral score {{to the sound of}} stray bullets coming over the roofs and pattering on the wall outside my window. On the 29th <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>finished,</b> and was free to go out and roam about Paris till morning, pistol in hand." [...] He finally won the prize with the cantata Sardanapale. He also arranged the French national anthem La Marseillaise and composed an overture to Shakespeare's The Tempest, which was the first of his pieces to play at the Paris Opéra. An hour before the performance, a sudden storm created the worst rain in Paris in 50 years, meaning the performance was almost deserted. Berlioz met Franz Liszt who was also attending the concert. This proved to {{be the beginning of a}} long friendship. Liszt would later transcribe the entire Symphonie fantastique for piano to enable more people to hear it.|$|E
