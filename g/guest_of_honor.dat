25|$|During this time, Joplin {{created an}} opera company of 30 people and {{produced}} his first opera A <b>Guest</b> <b>of</b> <b>Honor</b> {{for a national}} tour.

Joplin could not meet the company's payroll or pay for its lodgings at a theatrical boarding house. It is believed that the score for A <b>Guest</b> <b>of</b> <b>Honor</b> was lost and perhaps destroyed because of non-payment of the company's boarding house bill.|$|E
