5|$|Joe Shea got up {{and started}} calmly with {{a report on the}} state of the investigation. But within a minute, he was rambling, and in another thirty seconds, he was incoherent. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> and saw my father, in the grip of {{dementia}} praecox. It was horrifying and fascinating at the same time.|$|E
500|$|May then {{conducted}} his own VID pass about [...] {{above the}} helicopters and reported, [...] "Tally 2." [...] May later stated to a USAF {{accident investigation board}} that his [...] "Tally 2" [...] call meant that he saw two helicopters but {{did not mean that}} he was confirming Wickson's identification of them as Hinds. Neither F-15 pilot had been informed that U.S. Army Black Hawks participating in OPC often carried auxiliary fuel tanks mounted on wings nor had either been instructed in the paint scheme that Iraqi Hind helicopters used, light brown and desert tan, which was different from the dark green color used by the Black Hawks. Wickson later stated that, [...] "I had no doubt when <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> that he was a Hind[...] [...] [...] The Black Hawk did not even cross my mind." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> in blank amazement. The thing seemed impossible.|$|E
6000|$|Jimmy looked scared, and arter ’e {{was gone}} I turned to Bill, and <b>I</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>’im</b> and <b>I</b> says [...] "What’s the little game, Bill?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "’I {{mean the}} fits,’ ses <b>I,</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>’im</b> very steady, ’It’s no good looking hinnercent like that, ’cos I see yer chewing soap {{with my own}} eyes.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Compeyson, he <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> me very noticing, and <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> He has a {{watch and}} a chain and a ring and a breast-pin and a {{handsome}} suit of clothes.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with a contemptuous {{amusement}} that daunted him.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> blankly. I had {{forgotten}} all about Lord Porthoning.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> in surprise. He {{repeated}} the movement--a grotesque one.|$|E
6000|$|He.--A musician! Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> {{and grind}} my teeth, [...] saying: If thou wert ever {{to know a}} note of music, I believe I [...] would wring thy neck.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>'im</b> hard, but 'e {{stood there}} <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> {{me with his}} fat baby- face, and I knew he didn't mean any harm; so I {{answered}} 'im perlite and wished 'im good night.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! He's {{a curious}} animal and seems remarkably small, now that <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> No {{one would think}} of biting such a little thing, except a coward like me," [...] {{continued}} the Lion sadly.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> curiously. A {{man does}} not often confess himself entirely friendless.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> curiously. I {{had never}} {{understood}} his insistence on that point.|$|E
60|$|It was a {{singular}} question. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> quickly. His face was sphinxlike.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>’im,</b> {{and then}} <b>I</b> {{turned to the}} policeman. [...] "So long as she goes off my wharf, I don’t mind where she goes," [...] I ses. [...] "The skipper’s goings-on ’ave {{got nothing to do}} with me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Escape?" [...] quoth <b>I,</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> and endeavouring to {{keep from}} my eyes the {{contempt}} that was in my heart. Dear God! Had revenge been all I sought of him, how I might have gloated over his miserable downfall! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{a man of}} {{that kind}} ever came to be Laura Waynefleet's father is more than I can figure out!" [...] he said. [...] "It's a {{question}} that worries me every time <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> Guess she owes everything to her mother; and Mrs. Waynefleet {{must have been a}} mighty patient woman." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> again. Good is so overpoweringly frivolous. 'What is it?' I said.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> sideways. He {{was really}} a dear. Niceness fairly exhaled from him.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> In {{the popular}} phrase, I {{could hardly believe}} my own ears.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] said <b>I,</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> steadfastly, [...] "if I {{have caused}} you any pain, any misery, any torment of the soul, any anguish of heart, any agony of jealousy, or mental torture of any kind, I am heartily glad of it, {{for all of}} these things you have brought on me." ...|$|R
5000|$|Prohlížel jsem si ho. - <b>I</b> was <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> (<b>I</b> was {{studying}} him.) ...|$|R
60|$|I was too {{astonished}} to speak; <b>I</b> simply <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with my mouth open.|$|R
60|$|I {{dropped my}} glance, browbeaten for an instant. Then <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> again, and smiled.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> {{a little}} puzzled. His words {{had seemed to}} possess some special significance.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> in surprise. He {{was waiting}} for my answer {{with an air of}} anxiety.|$|E
5000|$|To me, when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> he's like, he's like, Eric Koston, {{but just}} with this, like ... take away all the, all the perfection, and everything, and add, like, this, like, lazy {{attitude}} problem, or something, you know, like, he's just, like, that good, but it's just like, [...] "Well, whatever". He's like, he's really that good.|$|R
60|$|I was not afraid, but my head swam {{a little}} and <b>I</b> only <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> mutely.|$|R
5000|$|Novelist Lev Grossman, in an {{interview}} with NPR, praised the backstory of the Ice King and the exploration of his condition, noting that his origin is [...] "psychologically plausible". He also stated [...] "My dad has been going through having Alzheimer's, and he's forgotten so much about who he used to be. And <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> and think this cartoon is about my father dying." ...|$|R
60|$|For {{the moment}} I forgot this man's {{kindness}} to me. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with a shudder.|$|E
60|$|A man's figure {{suddenly}} {{appeared on the}} left. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> puzzled, wondering whence he had come.|$|E
60|$|He sat, {{with that}} carved {{grin on his}} face, looking at the fire, as <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Tyrrel {{paused a}} moment again. His face was like marble. Then he added, {{in a tone of}} the profoundest anguish, [...] "Till this minute, Eustace, I've never told anybody. And if it hadn't been forced out of me by that poor man's {{tortured}} and broken-hearted face, I wouldn't have told you now. But could <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> to-day and not break down before him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I have {{no doubt}} of it, and he {{expected}} to play the same game with me. The fellow reminds me, whenever <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> of a sort of incarnate familiar demon. When I asked my uncle whether he could guess {{what had become of}} her, he held up his hands with a hideous French grimace. I could have taken him by the throat.' ...|$|R
60|$|He <b>looked</b> so attentively <b>at</b> me that <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> attentively <b>at</b> <b>him</b> {{and felt}} sure I {{understood}} him.|$|R
