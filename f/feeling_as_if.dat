Willer pointed out the problems specific to lesbians were job security and advancement, and family relationships, child custody, and visitation. <b>Feeling</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> their issues were not being addressed by homophile organizations, {{many members of the}} DOB began to say that lesbians had more in common with heterosexual women than men.|$|E

25|$|Although {{much closer}} to the epicenter, the states of Jalisco, Colima, Guerrero and Michoacán {{suffered}} only mild to moderate damage. Landslides caused damage at Atenquique, Jalisco, and near Jala, Nayarit. Rockslides were reported along highways near Ixtapa, Guerrero, with sand volcanos and ground cracks in Lazaro Cardenas. Students at the Universidad de las Américas in nearby Puebla reported <b>feeling</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the cafeteria had been lifted and rocked back and forth, shattering windows and injuring some people but mostly causing panic. A small tsunami caused only mild damage to Lázaro Cárdenas and Zihuatanejo. Some fishing boats were reported missing but these reports were never confirmed. One exceptional case was in Ciudad Guzmán, Jalisco, where about 60 percent of the buildings were destroyed, with about 50 dead. Some damage also occurred as far away as the states of Mexico, Morelos and parts of Veracruz, on the Gulf coast. Coastal and most inland damage was moderated by {{the fact that most of}} the west of Mexico sits on bedrock, which serves to transmit the shockwaves without amplifying them. La Villita, and Infiernillo Dams, near the coast, were superficially damaged and undamaged respectively.|$|E
25|$|While {{both were}} important, Sasun Eff was {{absolutely}} essential. His refusal would damn the Cabinet as a Talib ministry and doom it to failure from the outset. I left my {{cup of tea}} undrunk and rushed {{back to the office}} to tell Mr Philby. He wasn't there, but there was a light in Sir Percy's room. I went in and told him. He bade me go at once to Sasun Eff and charged me to make him change his mind. I set off <b>feeling</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> I carried the future of the 'Iraq in my hands, but when I got to Sasun's house to my immense relief I found Mr Philby and Capt Clayton already there. The Naqib had got Sasun's letter and had sent Mr Philby off post haste. I arrived, however, in the nick of time. They had exhausted all their arguments and Sasun still adhered to his decision. I think my immense anxiety must have inspired me for after an hour of concentrated argument he was visibly shaken, {{in spite of the fact}} that his brother Sha'al (whom I also admire and respect) came in and did his best against us. Finally however we persuaded him that Sir Percy had no desire to thrust Talib or anyone else upon Mesopotamia, but that Talib like everyone else must be given his chance. If he proved valuable he would take his part in the foundation of national institutions, if not he was politically a dead man. We got Sasun Eff to consent to think it over and to come and see Sir Percy next day. I had an inner conviction that the game was won—partly, thank heaven, to the relations of trust and confidence which I personally had already established with Sasun—but we none of us could feel sure. You will readily understand that I didn't sleep much that night. I turned and turned in my mind the arguments I had used and wondered if I could not have done better.|$|E

Roxy suspects that Jack and Honey are having an affair and tells Ronnie, who confronts Jack. He denies this and later, Roxy decides Amy should move without her and then asks Ronnie to adopt Amy. After an emotional discussion, Ronnie agrees but later the sisters secretly plan for Roxy to join the couple in Essex. However, on her wedding day, Roxy packs her things as she reveals she is moving away to live with Glenda and Danny, <b>feeling</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she will ruin Ronnie's happiness. After an argument, Ronnie convinces Roxy to give her away, and she agrees. While {{on the way to}} the wedding, Ronnie and Roxy visit Phil for a final time and take a picture with him, unbeknownst to him that it'll be the last time he'll see them. At the wedding, Roxy begins to break down and says she cannot give Ronnie away and runs out. Ronnie is unable to face Jack and runs off in tears, later revealing she wishes Roxy to move with them and will not accept any other outcome. Jack eventually accepts and they marry after Roxy gives her away. Later, the two sisters get drunk after a happy day and wander outside the hotel; precariously perched on the hotel roof, still drinking champagne, they discuss their time in the square and the start of a new era. Ronnie and Roxy find the hotel swimming pool, and Roxy jumps in. Ronnie is unable to remove her wedding dress and sees Roxy motionless at the bottom of the pool. Ronnie jumps in to rescue her, but is weighed down by her wedding dress and drowns alongside her sister. The following morning, police find their bodies in the pool and inform Jack's brother Max Branning (Jake Wood), who then breaks the news to a devastated Jack. A few days later, Jack receives their wedding video and watches Ronnie saying how much she loves him, and is emotional watching it. Jack later visits her body in the chapel of rest a day before her and Roxy's funerals and says an emotional farewell to her. At the inquest into Ronnie and Roxy's deaths, their deaths are ruled as misadventure.|$|E

Despite reassurances from Yanti that many singers continue to perform into their sixties, Chrisye observed that increasing numbers of established acts were being pushed aside by newcomers. While in this state of despair, Chrisye was approached by Jay Subyakto and Gauri Nasution, who offered him a solo concert at the Plenary Hall of the Jakarta Convention Centre, which had never before hosted a solo concert by an Indonesian artist.

500|$|Distortions of self-experience such as <b>feeling</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> one's {{thoughts}} or feelings {{are not really}} one's own to believing thoughts are being inserted into one's mind, sometimes termed passivity phenomena, are also common. There is often an observable pattern of emotional difficulty, for example lack of responsiveness. Impairment in social cognition is associated with schizophrenia, as are symptoms of paranoia. Social isolation commonly occurs. Difficulties in working and long-term memory, attention, executive functioning, and speed of processing also commonly occur. In one uncommon subtype, the person may be largely mute, remain motionless in bizarre postures, or exhibit purposeless agitation, all signs of catatonia. People with schizophrenia often find facial emotion perception to be difficult.

500|$|The {{culmination}} of the plot saw Lydia stab Zoe. The storyline {{was described as a}} [...] "brutal attack" [...] and at the time producers refused to reveal if Zoe would survive. Describing the terror Lydia causes for Zoe, a spokesperson for the serial stated: [...] "Zoe can’t believe it when Lydia admits the parachute was meant for her. As soon as she realises Lydia wanted her dead she tries to run. That’s when Lydia pulls out a knife and stabs her." [...] This led to a fight between Lydia and Charlotte who arrives with Dave Colburn (Elliot James Langridge).

500|$|The National Trust {{states that}} Newton House is [...] "thought {{to be one}} of the most haunted houses in Britain", and Wales Online cites it as one of the most notable ghostly houses of Wales. Over the years, many ghost {{sightings}} or paranormal activity have been allegedly witnessed at the house. The servants' basement is one of the purported centres of activity, with numerous sightings, particularly of a ghost known as Walter the Butler who worked at the house. People have reported smelling his tobacco smoke in the room, muffled voices and lights eerily turning on and off on their own accord. Visitors have reported <b>feeling</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they are being choked when walking up and down the cantilever staircase; this is believed to be related to the strangling of Lady Elinor Cavendish, the cousin of the lady of Newton House in the 1720s, by a lover whom she had rejected. The alleged hauntings at the property began to be investigated by television journalists in the 1980s, and on one occasion crewmen mysteriously fell ill one after the other while shooting there. During one investigation, the spectre of a young, beautiful girl was said to have glided across the room and disappeared through the cupboard door. The house was later the subject of an investigation in the 11th and 15th series of the Most Haunted programme.|$|E
500|$|While playing junior hockey, Hextall's coaches {{advised him}} that he would not reach the NHL if he {{continued}} to move the puck. Not everyone agreed; NHL goaltender Darren Pang described <b>feeling</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> [...] "he had just witnessed Superman flying out of a phone booth" [...] when he saw Hextall's puckhandling ability in a minor league game. Former NHL goaltender Johnny Bower, when scouting for the Toronto Maple Leafs in Brandon, remarked that Hextall would at times let in soft goals, and doubted if he would reach the NHL; Hextall retained a tendency to let in occasional weak goals throughout his career. Hextall claims his adventurous style stemmed from his youth, when he played on outdoor ice rinks with a skater's stick, rather than the heftier goaltender's stick. Martin Brodeur modelled his own play on that of Hextall, saying [...] "I love {{the fact that he was}} playing the puck. He was one of the first goalies that came out and played the puck. He was a little rough for my liking, but it was entertaining. The playing of the puck was the big thing." [...] Hextall's mobility provided extra passing opportunities for his defencemen: when killing a penalty they would frequently pass the puck back to him, relieving some of the pressure on his team. He is described on the Hockey Hall of Fame's Legends of Hockey website as being [...] "perhaps the game's most mobile goalie of all time." ...|$|E

[...] Arnell subsequently developed the idea of a recording studio setting, thinking that it was [...] "the most pure way to do it". He wanted to make the music video as [...] "uncontrived as possible" [...] without [...] "any other bullsh-- or effects in the way of it." [...] While Arnell conceded that music video may seem like a simple concept, the shoot itself took over twelve hours to complete and said that it was [...] "one of the hardest things I've ever done." [...] The group performed it [...] "over and over again because I was just trying to get different shots, different angles, different qualities." [...] As for the decision to shoot the video in black-and-white, Arnell felt it best captured the essence of the ballad. He also noted that was his intention to give the music video the <b>feeling</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> One Direction are singing it right to you, [...] "It's purely about the clarity of it.
