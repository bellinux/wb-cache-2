40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{determine}} {{distribution of}} arthropods in processed rice {{products such as}} rice flour and rice cereal-based <b>infant</b> <b>food.</b> MethodsRandom samples of rice flour and rice cereal-based <b>infant</b> <b>food</b> purchased from commercial outlets were examined {{for the presence of}} arthropods using a modified Berlese Tullgren Funnel Method. Mites were mounted prior to identification and weevils were directly identified. ResultsFor non-expired products, infestation was found in 6. 7 % of rice flour and none was found in rice cereal-based <b>infant</b> <b>food</b> samples. The arthropods found in the flour samples were Cheyletus spp., Suidasia pontifica (S. pontifica), Tarsonemus spp., Tyrophagus putrescentiae (T. putrescentiae), Sitophilus granarius (S. granarius) and Sitophilus oryzae (S. oryzae). Others which cannot be identified were Oribatid and Prostigmatid mites. The most common mites in rice flour were Tarsonemus spp. (69. 1 %), followed by S. pontifica (18. 2 %). For expired products, only one sample of rice cereal-based <b>infant</b> <b>food</b> was infested and the infestation was by mites of the family Tydeidae. ConclusionsThis study demonstrates the presence of 4 allergenic species of S. pontifica, T. putrescentiae, S. granarius and S. oryzae in rice flour. These arthropods can contribute to the incidence of anaphylaxis upon consumption by atopic individuals. There was no infestation of arthropods in rice cereal-based <b>infant</b> <b>food</b> surveyed except for an expired product in a moderate rusty tin container...|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} of aluminium in food can have different causes. Thus, for example, {{it can be}} due to natural contents in certain food ingredients or aluminium-containing additives. Another source can be the transfer of aluminium from food packaging, cooking utensils, or kitchen equipment etc. Below, the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) assesses aluminium contents in baby food {{with regard to their}} potential health effects. The trigger for the BfR opinion was a British study which measured aluminium contents in <b>infant</b> <b>food.</b> In addition to that data, the BfR drew on aluminium contents in baby food which had been made available by the supervisory authorities of the federal states. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has inferred a tolerable weekly intake (TWI) of 1 mg of aluminium per kg of body weight. The analysis of the available data on aluminium in <b>infant</b> <b>food</b> shows that both the use of baby food in powder form which is then mixed with drinking water and the use of ready-to-eat liquid food can lead to a situation where the TWI value is reached or even exceeded. However, the toxicological concept used - referring to the TWI - only has limited informative value for the health assessment of <b>infant</b> <b>food,</b> since the TWI value does not apply to babies under the age of 12 weeks. So far, however, there has been no scientific evidence to sug-gest that aluminium intake levels resulting from the consumption of <b>infant</b> <b>food</b> are harmful to the health of babies.

The selected foods encompass 347 food resources, namely 297 plant products from home gardens or collected from natural vegetation and 50 animals, either domesticated or from the wild. The compiled data reveal that {{the distribution of the}} available food resources was unbalanced between agro-ecological zones. Only a few animal ingredients are obtainable in northern Benin. Most resources are seasonal, but their availability may be extended. A high variation was observed in energy and nutrient contents.
