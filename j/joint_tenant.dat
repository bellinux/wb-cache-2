60|$|When Marie Melmotte assured Sir Felix Carbury {{that her}} father had already endowed her with a large fortune which could not be taken from her without her own consent, she spoke no more than the truth. She knew of the matter almost as little as it was {{possible}} that she should know. As far as reticence on the subject was compatible with the object he had in view Melmotte had kept from her all knowledge of the details of the arrangement. But it had been necessary when the thing was done to explain, or to pretend to explain, much; and Marie's memory and also her intelligence had been strong beyond her father's anticipation. He was deriving a very considerable income from a large sum of money which he had invested in foreign funds in her name, and had got her to execute a power of attorney enabling him to draw this income on her behalf. This he had done fearing shipwreck in the course which he meant to run, and resolved that, let circumstances go as they might, there should still be left enough to him of the money which he had realised to enable him to live in comfort and luxury, should he be doomed to live in obscurity, or even in infamy. He had sworn to himself solemnly that under no circumstances would he allow this money {{to go back into the}} vortex of his speculations, and hitherto he had been true to his oath. Though bankruptcy and apparent ruin might be imminent he would not bolster up his credit by the use of this money even though it might appear at the moment that the money would be sufficient for the purpose. If such a day should come, then, with that certain income, he would make himself happy, if possible, or at any rate luxurious, in whatever city of the world might know least of his antecedents, and give him the warmest welcome on behalf of his wealth. Such had been his scheme of life. But he had failed to consider various circumstances. His daughter might be untrue to him, or in the event of her marriage might fail to release his property,--or it might be that the very money should be required to dower his daughter. Or there might come troubles on him so great that even the certainty of a future income would not enable him to bear them. Now, at this present moment, his mind was tortured by great anxiety. Were he to resume this property it would more than enable him to pay all that was due to the Longestaffes. It would do that and tide him for a time over some other difficulties. Now in regard to the Longestaffes themselves, he certainly had no desire to depart from the rule which he had made for himself, on their behalf. Were it necessary that a crash should come they would be as good creditors as any other. But then he was painfully alive to the fact that something beyond simple indebtedness was involved in that transaction. He had with his own hand traced Dolly Longestaffe's signature on the letter which he had found in old Mr Longestaffe's drawer. He had found it in an envelope, addressed by the elder Mr Longestaffe to Messrs. Slow and Bideawhile, and he had himself posted this letter in a pillarbox near to his house. In the execution of this manoeuvre, circumstances had greatly befriended him. He had become the tenant of Mr Longestaffe's house, and at the same time had only been the <b>joint</b> <b>tenant</b> of Mr Longestaffe's study,--so that Mr Longestaffe's papers were almost in his very hands. To pick a lock was with him an accomplishment long since learned. But his science in that line did not go so far as to enable him to replace the bolt in its receptacle. He had picked a lock, had found the letter prepared by Mr Bideawhile with its accompanying envelope, and had then already learned enough of the domestic circumstances of the Longestaffe family to feel assured that unless he could assist the expedition of this hitherto uncompleted letter by his own skill, the letter would never reach its intended destination. In all this fortune had in some degree befriended him. The circumstances being as they were it was hardly possible that the forgery should be discovered. Even though the young man were to swear that the signature was not his, even though the old man were to swear that he had left that drawer properly locked with the unsigned letter in it, still there could be no evidence. People might think. People might speak. People might feel sure. And then a crash would come. But there would still be that ample fortune on which to retire and eat and drink and make merry for the rest of his days.|$|E

50|$|Rights {{that arise}} by {{operation}} of law often arise by design of certain contingencies set forth in a legal instrument.

5000|$|Severance {{in equity}} can be {{achieved}} in five main ways. Firstly, the most certain way to sever is to serve a statutory notice under Law of Property Act 1925 section 36 on the other joint tenants [...] "a notice in writing of such desire" [...] to sever one's share. Some courts have construed this provision restrictively, so in Harris v Goddard the Court of Appeal held that because Mrs Harris in her divorce petition requested merely that [...] "such order be made... in respect of the former matrimonial home", and did not request that an order be made immediately, she had not yet severed her share. This meant that when Mr Harris unexpectedly died after a car crash, {{she was able to}} remain a <b>joint</b> <b>tenant</b> and inherit the whole home, and the children of Mr Harris' first marriage did not. A notice will be considered effective, or [...] "served" [...] under Law of Property Act 1925 section 196 when it is left at a person's home or office, or if posted and so long as it does not go undelivered (in contrast to the postal rule) when it would ordinarily arrive. In Kinch v Bullard Mrs Johnson was terminally ill, and wished to sever her share of the home and sent a letter, but when she realised that Mr Johnson was ill too and would die first, she wanted to cancel her severance notice. Neuberger J held that because the letter was already delivered to Mr Johnson's house, it could not be withdrawn, even though Mr Johnson had not yet read it. Second, and in contrast to the formalistic approach for section 36, it was held in Burgess v Rawnsley that a course of dealings between two people can manifest the intention to sever. Mr Burgess had discussed with Ms Rawnsley selling her share in a property for £750 but negotiations stalled when she asked for more, and then he unexpectedly died. [...] "'Even if there was not any firm agreement but only a course of dealing", said Lord Denning MR, [...] "it clearly evinced an intention by both parties that the property should henceforth be held in common and not jointly." [...] Third, simply making an agreement to sell one's share will be counted by the courts as severing. Fourth, the declaration of bankruptcy effects severance, as under the Insolvency Act 1986 section 306, a bankrupt's estate will vest immediately in the trustee in bankruptcy. Fifth, killing a <b>joint</b> <b>tenant</b> will sever a share, because the Forfeiture Act 1982 generally prevents a killer to benefit from his wrong. However, in Re K the Court of Appeal upheld a claim by a lady to be relieved from forfeiture using a discretion in section 2. Mrs K had shot and killed her husband, but only after prolonged domestic violence, and she had been cleared of murder because it did not count as intentional. Lastly, if practical, beneficial owners may request trustees to physically partition property under Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996 section 7, and compensate the different owners in money as is appropriate.|$|E

5000|$|In Georgia, {{joint tenancy}} is {{commonly}} conveyed in a deed as [...] "Joint Tenants with Rights of Survivorship". The legal {{effect of this}} type of tenancy is a [...] "life estate" [...] with a [...] "contingent remainder". Translated, this means that the interest of each <b>joint</b> <b>tenant</b> can be thought of in two parts: the [...] "present" [...] interest while the parties are both alive and what happens in the [...] "future" [...] when one of the tenants dies. Viewed separately, the interest of each independent co-tenant is only [...] "temporary" [...] interest while they both co-tenants are alive and neither owns a [...] "full" [...] interest. The [...] "full" [...] interest is determined by who outlives the other and vests automatically in the survivor at, and only at, the time of death. In the case of a mortgage executed by only one of the living joint tenants, the mortgage does not sever the tenancy. Instead, the mortgage is interpreted as conveying whatever interest the debtor holds. In this example, that would be the debtor's life (or [...] "temporary") estate only, since both parties are still living, but the lender would also be entitled to the full estate, but only if the debtor were to outlive the other joint-tenant. Consequently, if the debtor dies first, the co-tenant, who is not party to the mortgage, would take full ownership interest of the property free and clear of the mortgage. However, just because a surviving co-tenant isn't liable on the mortgage {{does not mean that the}} mortgage is extinguished or that the property is not subject to foreclosure if the mortgage isn't paid. The Georgia Supreme Court decision of Manders v. King, 284 Ga. 338, 339, 667 S.E.2d 59, 60 (2008) is instructive. [...] "Georgia is one of several states adhering to the common-law doctrine of exoneration, which provides that, unless a will specifically provides otherwise, an heir or devisee of real property may look to the decedent's personal property for satisfaction of liens on devised real property, at the expense of the residuary legatees or distributees of the decedent's personal estate. J. Kraut, Annotation, Right of Heir or Devisee to Have Realty Exonerated from Lien Thereon at Expense of Personal Estate, 4 A.L.R.3d 1023, § 3. See Raines v. Shipley, 197 Ga. 448, 458, 29 S.E.2d 588 (1944) (“Under the general law it was the duty of the executors to discharge this particular mortgage debt devised real property from the personal property of the testatrix, if any she had....”). See also Killingsworth v. First Nat. Bank of Columbus, 237 Ga. 544, 546, 228 S.E.2d 901 (1976) (estate required to exonerate devised real property by paying balance of mortgage liens so long as the liens were debts of the testator and not an assumption of debts of a predecessor in title). Id. In Manders, the Court held “a surviving <b>joint</b> <b>tenant</b> does not qualify for exoneration of a mortgage on joint tenancy property unless there is language in the decedent's will clearly expressing an intention that the mortgage debt be paid.” In re Estate of Young, supra; In re Estate of Dolley, supra, 265 Cal.App.2d at 72.2. In short, if there is a mortgage on a property that was executed by only one joint-tenant and that joint-tenant dies, unless there is a specific provision in the Will of the deceased joint-tenant that estate assets should be used to pay the outstanding mortgage, then surviving joint-tenant is not exonerated from the mortgage and the property is subject to foreclosure if the mortgage goes into default.|$|E
