40|$|International audienceIn {{hydrological}} models evaporation from interception {{is often}} disregarded, combined with transpiration, or {{taken as a}} fixed percentage of rainfall. In general interception is {{not considered to be}} a significant process in rainfall-runoff modelling. However, it appears that on average interception can amount to 20 ? 50 % of the precipitation. Therefore, knowledge about the process of interception is important. Traditional research on interception mainly focuses on canopy interception and almost completely denies forest floor interception, although this is an important mechanism that precedes infiltration or runoff. Forest floor interception consists partly of interception by dry soil, partly of interception by short vegetation (mosses, grasses and creeping vegetation) and partly of interception by litter. This research concentrates on litter interception: to measure its quantities at point scale and subsequently to upscale it to the scale of a <b>hydrotope.</b> A special measuring device has been developed, which consists of a permeable upper basin filled with forest floor and a watertight lower basin. Both are weighed continuously. The device has been tested in the Huewelerbach catchment (Luxembourg). The preliminary measuring results show that the device is working properly. For November 2004, evaporation from interception is calculated to be 34 % of the throughfall in the Huewelerbach catchment...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis {{second part}} of the paper {{presents}} the details of the eco-hydrological model SWIM simulating the natural water supply and its coupling to WBalMo, a water management model. Based on the climate scenarios of the STAR model, SWIM simulates the natural water and matter fluxes for the entire Elbe River area. All relevant processes are modelled for <b>hydrotopes</b> and the resulting discharges are accumulated in subbasins. The output data are input for the water management model WBalMo and the quality models Moneris and QSim. WBalMo takes storage management, inputs and withdrawals into account and analyses how demands by industry, power plants and households will be met at changing natural supply conditions.

Studies have found <b>hydrotopes</b> to be very slightly volatile, with vapour pressures <2.0x10-5 Pa. They are aerobically biodegradable. Removal via the secondary wastewater treatment process of activated sludge is >94%. [...] Acute toxicity studies on fish show an LC50 >400 mg active ingredient (a.i.)/L. For Daphnia, the EC50 is >318 mg a.i./L. The most sensitive species is green algae with EC50 values {{in the range of}} 230-236 mg a.i./ L and No Observed Effect Concentrations (NOEC) in the range of 31-75 mg a.i./L. The aquatic Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC) was found to be 0.23 mg a.i./L. The Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC)/PNEC ratio has been determined to be < 1 and, therefore, hydrotropes in household laundry and cleaning products have been determined to not be an environmental concern.|$|R
40|$|Two species Gomphonema laticollum Reichardt and Gomphonema bukycanyona sp. nov. are {{recorded}} {{for the first}} time from the <b>hydrotopes</b> of Ukraine. Their morphology using CM and SEM microphotos and geographic distribution are described. New terminology is suggested for the poles of the heteropolar frustule. Depending on the pole contour valve headand footor head poleandfoot pole are used to date. However, many species of Gomphonema Ehrenb. do not have a wide round pole that resembles a head, instead they may have the same contour on both poles. According of every pole functions an attaching valve pole is a pole with pore fields or other structures that attach individual to substratum. A free valve poleis relatively freely located in a space pole. The function of free pole consists in expansion ofindividual contact space – a part of the environment where an individual may interact directly with its physical body and its biospace (=био-поле in Rus.). Within an individual contact space physical, maximum energy and informative interaction, high interchange of substances are accomplished between individual and environment. This ecosystem parameter is a part of individual biosphereand impacts directly on the formation of a species econiche. Proposed terms concern functional morphology of the genera with heteropolar frustule as Gomphonema, Didymosphenia M. Schmidt, Meridion Agardh, Licmophora Agardh and other.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{effects of}} different land use management practices on carbon fluxes {{at the regional}} scale we developed an integrated model by coupling an ecohydrological river basin model SWIM (Soil and Water Integrated Model) and a soil organic matter model SCN (Soil-Carbon-Nitrogen model). The latter is a submodel of the forest growth model 4 C. The extended integrated model combines hydrological processes, crop and vegetation growth, carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus cycles and soil organic matter turnover. It {{is based on a}} three level spatial disaggregation scheme (basin, subbasin and hydrotopes), whereas a <b>hydrotope</b> is a set of elementary units in the subbasin with a uniform land use and soil type. The direct connection to land use, soil and climate data provides a possibility to use the model for analyses of climate change and land use change impacts on hydrology and soil organic matter turnover. Aim {{of this study is to}} test the model performance and its capability to simulate carbon pools and fluxes in right magnitude and temporal behaviour at the regional scale. As a first step, the model was parameterised and validated for conditions in East Germany, incorporating values known from literature and regionally available times series of carbon pools and fluxes. This provides verification of carbon pools and fluxes in the landscape and verifies the correct representation of the environmental processes therein. Based on this, different land management strategies (e. g. soil cultivation techniques, crop residue returns) and land use change options (e. g. conversion of agricultural areas to forest or to set-aside areas) can be simulated to assess the behaviour of water and carbon fluxes as well as carbon sequestration options...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{hydrological}} validation {{described in}} this paper follows a bottom-up approach, when at first 12 mesoscale subbasins, covering the main subregions of the basin, are validated, and then the information gained from the mesoscale is used to validate the hydrological processes of the whole basin. Special {{attention was paid to}} the use of spatial information (maps of water table depth) in addition to usual point data (water discharge at gauge stations) to validate the model. While the primary purpose of distributed hydrological models is to reproduce both water fluxes in subbasins and <b>hydrotopes</b> along with river discharge, they are often validated using only observed river discharge. The paper describes a method to reproduce and validate also local hydrological processes such as water table dynamics inside subbasins, using contour maps of the water table and observed groundwater level data as additional input for the validation. The investigation was carried out with the ecohydrological model SWIM (Soil and Water Integrated Model), which integrates hydrology, vegetation, erosion and nutrient dynamics at the watershed scale. It was developed to investigate the impacts of climate and land use changes on the hydrological processes and water quality at the meso- to macroscale. The study area is the German part of the Elbe basin (80, 256 km 2). It is representative of humid / semi-humid landscapes in Europe, where water availability during the summer season is the limiting factor for plant growth and crop yields...|$|R
40|$|The model SWIM (Soil and Water Integrated Model) was {{developed}} {{in order to provide}} a comprehensive GIS-based tool for hydrological and water quality modelling in mesoscale and large river basins (from 100 to 10, 000 km" 2), which can be parameterised using regionally available information. The model {{was developed}} for the use mainly in Europe and temperate zone, though its application in other regions is possible as well. SWIM is based on two previously developed tools - SWAT and MATSALU (see more explanations in section 1. 1). The model integrates hydrology, vegetation, erosion, and nutrient dynamics at the watershed scale. SWIM has a three-level disaggregation scheme 'basin -sub-basins - hydrotopes' and is coupled to the Geographic Information System GRASS (GRASS, 1993). A robust approach is suggested for the nitrogen and phosphorus modelling in mesoscale watersheds. SWIM runs under the UNIX environment. Model test and validation were performed sequentially for hydrology, crop growth, nitrogen and erosion in a number of mesoscale watersheds in the German part of the Elbe drainage basin. A comprehensive scheme of spatial disaggregation into sub-basins and <b>hydrotopes</b> combined with reasonable restriction on a sub-basin area allows performing the assessment of water resources and water quality with SWIM in mesoscale river basins. The modest data requirements represent an important advantage of the model. Direct connection to land use and climate data provides a possibility to use the model for analysis of climate change and land use change impacts on hydrology, agricultural production, and water quality.

40|$|The paper {{provides}} the research results representing {{the dynamics of}} species composition and production of wood stands in suramens of Mari El Republic Trans-Volga region as mathematical models. It was determined that there are 15 tree species growing on this territory, however the composition of a particular forest stand includes no more than seven tree species. Almost all suramen <b>hydrotopes,</b> {{with the exception of}} the swampy ones, are dominated by birch trees, the share of which is especially high in wet suramens, which proves the significant transformation of the forest structure. With the growth of tree stands the species composition inevitably changes towards original formations: in new and wet suramens the tree stand transforms into spruce forest mixed with linden and oak, while in wet suramens the forest stand transforms into spruce forest mixed with birch trees, and in swampy areas – into sticky alder forest. The greatest maximum plant biomass in new suramens is by pine trees, which are followed by spruce and oak trees. Aspen and birch trees are outsiders in this respect. In wet suramens the greatest plant biomass is produced by spruce trees while the least, by sticky alder trees. In terms of annual plant biomass increment the highest is by aspen trees in all types of suramens excluding the swampy ones. In complex plantations in terms of species composition with the growth of forest stand, there are distinct variations of the total tree bole biomass. This occurs due to gradual elimination of some species and their replacement with others. Forest stands in surames of Mari El Republic Trans-Volga region do not use their production capacity to the fullest. There are still reserves to be used. In new and wet suramens the birch and aspen may be replaced by conifers and in some cases even by oak. However, the final decision as on replacement should be taken based on economic calculations and ecological limitations. The paper also stresses that special attention of foresters should be paid on establishing the wood stands when the trees are still young...|$|R
40|$|Microstructures in two mixed {{surfactants}} {{systems that}} show novel transformations {{as a function}} of composition and temperature have been explored. Indirect imaging methods like Small Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) along with direct imaging methods like Cryogenic Transmission Electron Microscopy (Cryo-TEM) and recently developed Freeze Fracture Direct Imaging (FFDD have been used extensively to characterize and identify the changes in the microstructures in the mixed surfactant systems {{as a function of}} composition, temperature and external force fields. As water is added to a solution of an anionic surfactant, AOT (2 ethylhexyl sodium sulfosuccinate) and a zwitterionic surfactant, lecithin (phosphatidylcholine) in isooctane, the microstructure evolves from a water-in-oil microemulsion to a bicontinuous highly viscous gel phase. SANS experiments show that the gel consists of highly ordered aqueous and organic nanochannels. Depending upon the composition and temperature these ordered phases display either hexagonal or lamellar symmetries. FFDI has been used extensively to image the hexagonal and lamellar micro structures of the gel phase and shows that the structures at high water contents are multilamellar vesicles, and not planar sheets. It has also been observed that the application of shear orients the cylinders in the hexagonal phase in the direction of flow and reduces the inter-cylinder spacing. The lamellar polycrystalline phase does not show any preferential alignment after application of shear, confirming that this phase consists of multilamellar vesicles. When the mixed phase (hexagonal + lamellar) is subjected to shear, the hexagonal component aligns, while the lamellar portion remains unaffected. When an aligned hexagonal phase is heated past the hexagonal to lamellar phase transition temperature, cylinders merge in the (1, 0) direction to form planar sheets parallel to the walls of a Couette cell. Cryogenic-TEM has been used extensively to map the transformation of cetyl trirnethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) micelles to elongated micelles, vesicles and tubules and double layered vesicle structures as a range of phenolic derivatives are doped into the system. The addition of <b>hydrotopes</b> as well as more insoluble dopants to micelles to drive structural transitions represents an interesting approach to controlling functionality in complex fluids...|$|R
