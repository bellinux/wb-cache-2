5|$|The {{overarching}} methodological {{principle of}} positivism is to conduct sociology in broadly {{the same manner}} as natural science. An emphasis on empiricism and the scientific method is sought to provide a tested foundation for sociological research {{based on the assumption that}} the only authentic knowledge is scientific knowledge, and that such <b>knowledge</b> <b>can</b> only arrive by positive affirmation through scientific methodology.|$|E
5|$|Dhumavati is the {{primordial}} darkness and ignorance, from which rises {{the world of}} illusion. She represents the darkness/ignorance before creation and after decay. This ignorance, which obscures the ultimate reality, is necessary because without the realization of this ignorance, true <b>knowledge</b> <b>can</b> not be achieved. Dhumavati also represents yogic sleep (Yoganidra), the pre-creation state of consciousness, {{as well as the}} primal sleep (the Void) in which all creation would dissolve and reach ultimate reality of Brahman. This void is pure consciousness, the cessation of movements of the mind, and silence. Even Dhumavati's ability to spread disease is also considered positive, as disease punishes the wicked and restores cosmic order. Dhumavati is also associated with the heart or middle region of the body.|$|E
40|$|<b>Knowledge</b> sharing <b>can</b> {{be seen as}} {{a social}} dilemma. Mutual <b>knowledge</b> sharing <b>can</b> lead to a benefit for all the participants. However, {{establishing}} voluntary <b>knowledge</b> sharing <b>can</b> be difficult because each member benefits from the knowledge offered by others but gains little from the own contribution. Knowledge markets could overcome this problem. To analyze knowledge markets we designed and implemented the Data Trader Game. This computer-assisted game was used for the real-life experiments of different market mechanisms and their effects on knowledge sharing...|$|R

25|$|Diversity between team members’ {{backgrounds}} and <b>knowledge</b> <b>can</b> increase team creativity by expanding the total collection of unique {{information that is}} available to the team and introducing different perspectives that can integrate in novel ways. However, under some conditions, diversity can also decrease team creativity by {{making it more difficult}} for team members to communicate about ideas and causing interpersonal conflicts between those with different perspectives. Thus, the potential advantages of diversity must be supported by appropriate team processes and organizational cultures in order to enhance creativity.|$|E
25|$|Henriques further {{argues that}} {{developing}} {{such a system}} for integrating knowledge {{is not just an}} academic enterprise. He suggests that in an increasingly complex world, the fragmented state of <b>knowledge</b> <b>can</b> be seen {{as one of the most}} pressing social problems of our time. Henriques also believes that history seems to attest that the absence of a collective worldview ostensibly condemns humanity to an endless series of conflicts that inevitably stem from incompatible, partially correct, locally situated justification systems. Thus, from Henriques' perspective, there are good reasons for believing that if there was a shared, general background of explanation, humanity might be able to achieve much greater levels of harmonious relations.|$|E

25|$|To begin with, Kant's {{distinction}} between the a posteriori being contingent and particular knowledge, and the a priori being universal and necessary knowledge, must be kept in mind. For if we merely connect two intuitions together in a perceiving subject, the knowledge is always subjective because it is derived a posteriori, when what is desired is for the knowledge to be objective, that is, for the two intuitions {{to refer to the}} object and hold good of it necessarily universally for anyone at any time, not just the perceiving subject in its current condition. What else is equivalent to objective knowledge besides the a priori, that is to say, universal and necessary knowledge? Nothing else, and hence before <b>knowledge</b> <b>can</b> be objective, it must be incorporated under an a priori category of the understanding.|$|E
25|$|China has {{increasingly}} encouraged multinational corporations to create R centers in China. Chinese critics {{have argued that}} foreign owned R mainly benefits foreign companies and removes many talented Chinese researchers from indigenous companies and institutions. Chinese supporters {{have argued that the}} foreign R serves as a role model and encouragement for indigenous companies and creates skilled communities from which labor and <b>knowledge</b> <b>can</b> easily flow to indigenous companies. In 2010 there were 1,200 such R centers and 400 out the Fortune 500 corporations had created such R centers. Corporations have argued that this is a necessity in order to adapt products for the local requirements of the Chinese market as well as it being essential for maintaining global competitiveness to make use the many available Chinese engineers and scientists. China is now ranked first when multinational corporations are asked in which nation future R centers {{are most likely to be}} located.|$|E
