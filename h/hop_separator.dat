50|$|Horst {{revolutionized}} {{the processing of}} hops with the invention of his mechanical <b>hop</b> <b>separator,</b> patented 1909 in Elk Grove, California. It picked the hops while discarding the bine and leaves. It produced 25 bales of hops in one day, while an experienced worker picked just two bales in a week, allowing him to bypass the hassles of hiring seasonal labor. Horst continuously invented new hop-related machinery (1884-1924) holding at least 14 patents. In the first season that Horst used the new machine, he advertised and kept hop pickers on hand, in case anything went wrong. When the separator proved itself and the pickers were told {{that there would be}} no work, the workers went on strike and blocked access to the kilns, halting the harvest.|$|E
50|$|Hop {{plants are}} planted in rows about 2 to 2.5 m apart. Each spring, the roots send forth new bines that are started up strings {{from the ground}} to an {{overhead}} trellis. The cones grow high on the bine, and in the past, these cones were picked by hand. Harvesting of hops became much more efficient with {{the invention of the}} mechanical <b>hops</b> <b>separator,</b> patented by Emil Clemens Horst in 1909.|$|R
