50|$|In 1996, <b>Direct</b> <b>Overwrite</b> {{technology}} was introduced for 90 mm discs eliminating the initial erase pass when writing. This requires special media.|$|E
50|$|Light Intensity Modulated <b>Direct</b> <b>OverWrite</b> (LIMDOW) {{technology}} used a different write technology, which improved {{on the performance}} levels of earlier magneto-optical devices.|$|E
50|$|GeSbTe (germanium-antimony-tellurium or GST) is a phase-change {{material}} from the group of chalcogenide glasses used in rewritable optical discs and phase-change memory applications. Its recrystallization time is 20 nanoseconds, allowing bitrates of up to 35 Mbit/s to be written and <b>direct</b> <b>overwrite</b> capability up to 106 cycles. It is suitable for land-groove recording formats. It is often used in rewritable DVDs. New phase-change memories are possible using n-doped GeSbTe semiconductor. The melting point of the alloy is about 600 °C (900 K) and the crystallization temperature is between 100 and 150 °C.|$|E
50|$|Phase-change {{memory has}} many near ideal memory qualities such as non-volatility, fast {{switching}} speed, high endurance {{of more than}} 1013 read -write cycles, non-destructive read, <b>direct</b> <b>overwriting</b> and long data retention time of more than 10 years. The one advantage that distinguishes it from other next generation non-volatile memory like {{magnetic random access memory}} (MRAM) is the unique scaling advantage of having better performance with smaller sizes. The limit to which phase-change memory can be scaled is hence limited by lithography at least until 45 nm. Thus, it offers the biggest potential of achieving ultra-high memory density cells that can be commercialized.|$|R
40|$|<b>Direct</b> <b>overwrite</b> in {{magneto-optical}} recording {{is necessary to}} overcome the latency incurred by conventional erase before write recording on magneto-optical disks. In this work we theoretically analyze the thermomagnetic recording process on optical disks using a domain wall motion model. The wall motion model developed in this work {{can be used to}} examine overwrite schemes on both bilayer and single layer disks, that either rotate beneath an optical head or remain stationary. The model is directly compared with experiment for a GdTbFe <b>direct</b> <b>overwrite</b> sample, and is shown to produce results that are in agreement with experimental observations. We show that variations in the domain wall saturation velocity {{can mean the difference between}} writing or erasing a bit on the disk, and hence is a critical parameter in the recording process. We also show that <b>direct</b> <b>overwrite</b> by means of interior nucleation is highly unlikely. Rather, we show that the recording process involves a dynamic balance between those pressures which act to move the domain wall and those which act to freeze it into place. Finally we analyze the Nikon bilayer <b>direct</b> <b>overwrite</b> scheme, and then demonstrate an alternative bilayer overwrite scheme which avoids a major problem with the Nikon scheme...|$|E
40|$|WE have {{designed}} a dual-beam magneto-optical (MO) storage system {{to test the}} dynamic storage properties of MO disks. The characteristics of this dual-beam system are demonstrated. Magnetic field modulated <b>direct</b> <b>overwrite,</b> which is a promising technique for highspeed MO storage, is realized on TbFeCo MO disks with this dual-beam MO system. The effect of light intensity, magnetic field intensity, and linear velocity of the disk and the modulating frequency variation on carrier-to-noise ratio is investigated.

40|$|The {{programming}} inputs for phase-change {{random access}} memories (PRAMs) can be significantly reduced by using voltage pulse for RESET (V(reset)) and current pulse for SET (I(set)) for different structures. Based upon two-dimensional electrothermal simulations, the PRAM cells can be operated by V(reset) and I(set) pulses of 50 ns at amplitudes {{as low as}} 0. 27 V and 35 mu A, respectively. The <b>direct</b> <b>overwrite</b> function can be achieved under this mode, and extra asynchronous suspending circuits are not needed. (C) 2009 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Magneto-optic, {{magnetic}} {{and structural}} techniques {{were used to}} examine the properties of Pt/Co multilayers and the variation of the manufacturing conditions was found to greatly effect these properties Three conditions were required to produce multilayers with rectangular polar Kerr hysteresis loops with coercivities of 3. 3 kOe and polar Kerr rotations of 0. 32 deg. These were the use of a thin platinum underlayer, the sputter etching of both the substrate and the underlayer and the sputter gas pressure used. The properties of these multilayers after heating in a variety of conditions were examined and {{it was found that the}} coercivity and polar Kerr loop shape could be altered by the use of the appropriate heating conditions. The coercivity of multilayers with the same nominal structure could be varied between 1. 7 and 10. 3 kOe, although the nucleation field was never greater than 6. 2 kOe. The mechanism behind these coercivity changes is related to the oxidation of cobalt in the multilayer and is discussed in detail. The magnetic reversal mechanisms of a set of multilayers with a range of coercivities are also examined. The properties of stacked multilayers (i. e. one deposited on top of the other) were examined with a view towards <b>direct</b> <b>overwrite</b> applications. It was found that the use of a platinum spacer layer effected the exchange coupling between the two stacked multilayers. The variation of the Curie temperatures with individual multilayer structure is also reported.
