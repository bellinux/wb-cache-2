5|$|The {{route from}} Victoria to Orpington via Herne Hill is {{projected}} to be amongst the most congested and overcrowded in South East London by 2026. Network Rail is considering grade-separating the two lines passing through Herne Hill so that trains would not cross each other's paths at the station's junctions; this restricts the number of services that can pass through the station. A 2008 route utilisation strategy for South London concluded that this improvement will not be required before 2020 but recommended safeguarding the required land. <b>Grade-separation</b> is supported by Southeastern and First Capital Connect believed it should be given more consideration, but Network Rail has stated {{that it would be}} difficult to carry out the work because the station is on a viaduct and surrounded by buildings. The 2011 route utilisation strategy, which examined options for congestion relief at Herne Hill before 2031, did not suggest <b>grade-separation</b> as an option in the 2011â€“2031 period.|$|E
25|$|The section between Limehouse and Wennington is {{maintained}} by RMS (A13) Plc {{as part of}} a 30-year DBFO deal reached with the Highways Agency in 2000. It was RMS who undertook <b>grade-separation</b> of the East Ham & Barking Bypass section in 2002-2004. RMS also maintain the A1203 Limehouse Link tunnel as well as the Aspen Way and East India Dock Link tunnel sections of the A1261 through Docklands. This latter route runs just south of the A13, is dual carriageway and nearly all grade-separated and acts as an alternative to East India Dock Road and much of Commercial Road.|$|E
25|$|Streetcar {{congestion}} {{in downtown}} Boston {{led to the}} subways in 1897 and elevated rail in 1901. The Tremont Street Subway was the first rapid transit tunnel in the United States. <b>Grade-separation</b> added capacity and avoided delays caused by cross streets. The first elevated railway and the first rapid transit line in Boston were built three years before the first underground line of the New York City Subway, but 34 {{years after the first}} London Underground lines, and long after the first elevated railway in New York City, its Ninth Avenue El started operations on July 1, 1868 in Manhattan as an elevated cable car line.|$|E
50|$|In the Delaware urban area, U.S. Route 42 is a two-lane freeway between London Road and U.s. Route 23, it {{has some}} <b>grade-separations.</b> Incidentally its {{intersection}} with U.S. Route 23, with which it runs concurrent, is at-grade.|$|R
25|$|On {{the western}} side of Ottawa, phase two opened a year later in October, 1961. The central section {{presented}} the greatest challenge, as an embankment was built to create <b>grade-separations.</b> In addition, the structures over the Rideau Canal and river required several years of construction. On May15, 1964, the majority of the third phase was ceremonially opened.|$|R
50|$|The route {{had several}} {{segments}} under consideration for <b>grade-separations.</b> The LRT Baseline (DEIR) included a minimal set of grade separations: the design options specified additional grade separations. The locally preferred alternative (LPA) {{adopted by the}} Metro Board included the LRT Baseline plus some additional grade separations (e.g. Design Options 1, 2 and 4). Other grade separations were also still under consideration. All grade separations {{are subject to the}} Metro Grade Crossing Policy.|$|R
25|$|However, {{just east}} of Blackwall, at the {{crossing}} of the River Lea, there is a TOTSO (turn-off to stay on) with the A1261 East India Dock Link Tunnel, and the road changes character dramatically, becoming a dual three-lane expressway. This grade-separated route continues {{all the way to}} the Greater London Boundary. Notable junctions include Canning Town, and the A406 junction near Beckton, as well as the single carriageway Lodge Avenue flyover near Barking, where the old A13 route (Ripple Road) merges with the new. Grade-separated in 2002-2004, the dual carriageway section through Newham is Newham Way, while through Barking it is Alfreds Way, both comprising the East Ham & Barking Bypass, and originally dualled by the 1960s. This section is structurally sound and built to high standards, but was subject to a 40mph (64km/h) speed limit. Prior to <b>grade-separation,</b> the speed limit was 50mph (80km/h). Works involved inserting new underpasses at Prince Regent and Movers Lane, a new flyover at Beckton Alps, and expanding Canning Town flyover from two lanes either way to three. Also inserted was the free-flow link to the A1261 tunnel. London Bus route 173 is the only route to use the A13 here, between Beckton Alps and Ripple Road. However, the speed limit was increased back to 50mph in 2011.|$|E

500|$|Despite some modern infrastructure, {{including}} traffic circles, interchanges, {{and some}} <b>grade-separations,</b> {{the majority of}} the new superhighway was not controlled-access. This meant existing farmers and homeowners along several segments that were once concession roads were permitted to build driveways and entrances onto the road. In addition, {{the majority of the}} crossroads encountered along the route were at-grade intersections. This combined with the ever-increasing number of automobiles, traffic jams, accidents and deteriorating pavement led the Department of Highways to report it had begun [...] "salvaging" [...] the QEW in their 1953 annual report.|$|R
50|$|The Queensway was {{constructed}} in four phases, each opening independently: phase one, from Alta Vista Drive (now Riverside Drive) east to Highway 17 (Montreal Road); phase two, from Highway 7 and Highway 15 (Richmond Road) to Carling Avenue; phase three, from Carling Avenue to O'Connor Street; and, phase four, from O'Connor Street to Alta Vista Drive, crossing the Rideau Canal and Rideau River.Phase one opened to traffic on November 25, 1960, extending up to the Rideau River.On {{the western side of}} Ottawa, phase two opened a year later in October, 1961. The central section presented the greatest challenge, as an embankment was built to create <b>grade-separations.</b> In addition, the structures over the Rideau Canal and river required several years of construction. On May 15, 1964, the majority of the third phase was ceremonially opened,completing the Carling Avenue interchange and extending the freeway as far as Bronson Avenue.Several months later, on September 17 the short but complicated section east to O'Connor Street was opened.This left only phase four, the central section of the Queensway, which was opened in three segments. On November 26, 1965, the structures over the Rideau Canal were opened to traffic. At the same time, the westbound lanes of the Queensway were extended to Concord Street, located west of the Nicholas Street interchange.The interchange opened on January 1, 1966, allowing travel in both directions over the canal.The final segment, linking the two section of the Queensway, was placed into service on October 28, 1966.Following this, the Highway 17 designation was applied along the Queensway and the old routing renumbered as Highway 17B.|$|R

50|$|Prior to 2004, the {{interchange}} {{from the}} Indiana Toll Road to southbound I-65 required making a physical left turn onto I-65 via a traffic signal; traffic from northbound I-65 to I-90 bypassed the traffic signal via an isolated right-turn lane. This deficiency {{has since been}} corrected by a <b>grade-separation.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{fourth and}} current station {{was built by}} RDG in 1930 {{as part of a}} <b>grade-separation</b> project which {{eliminated}} running down the middle of Cresson Street. Despite the station building's suboptimal passenger location on the outbound side (going away from Center City Philadelphia), it is open for ticket sales on weekday mornings.|$|E
50|$|Chelten Avenue {{station is}} a SEPTA Regional Rail station in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Located on West Chelten Avenue in the Germantown neighborhood, it serves the Chestnut Hill West Line.

50|$|Originally, {{the route}} {{was called the}} Gateway Arterial Road because the road was not at {{motorway}} status, the road passing through three large roundabouts north of the Brisbane River. Therefore, {{to cope with the}} heavy traffic, the government began upgrading the road in 1987. Duplication to four lanes and <b>grade-separation</b> was completed in several stages between 1989 and 1996.|$|E

50|$|DN5 {{has been}} {{designated}} as a priority express road, being upgraded between 2006 and 2009. Between Bucharest and Giurgiu, for the most part, it is a non-grade separated dual carriageway with no emergency lane, with entrances and exits from adjacent roads using roundabouts. Some segments (such as the AdunaÅ£ii CopÄƒceni bypass) are constructed to full motorway standard (dual carriageway, full <b>grade-separation,</b> wide median separation).|$|E
50|$|The {{junction}} was upgraded as part {{of works}} on the M50 motorway. Congestion was alleviated by providing a third level of <b>grade-separation,</b> allowing Dublin - Cork/Limerick traffic to travel from the M50 to the N7 without having to navigate a roundabout. The junction upgrade was substantially complete by December 2008, with only minor finishing works outstanding. A similar upgrade of the N4/M50 interchange was completed on 20 December 2007. http://www.m50.ie/pages/n4.htm.|$|E
50|$|VicRoads has {{undertaken}} a planning {{study for the}} upgrading of the Hume Freeway by removal of direct access from adjoining properties and <b>grade-separation</b> of the intersections between Kalkallo and Beveridge.

Left-in/left-out sliproads provided at Mulhouse Road (for access to the Royal Victoria Hospital), the closure of access to Roden Street {{and the provision of}} a segregated busway from Broadway into the Europa Buscentre were also completed.|$|E
50|$|A premetro {{design means}} that an {{underground}} rapid transit system is {{built in the}} city centre, but only a light rail or tram system in the suburbs. Conversely, other cities have opted to build a full metro in the suburbs, but run trams in city streets to save the cost of expensive tunnels. In North America, interurbans were constructed as street-running suburban trams, without the <b>grade-separation</b> of rapid transit. Premetros also allow a gradual upgrade of existing tramways to rapid transit, thus spreading the investment costs over time. They are most common in Germany with the name Stadtbahn.|$|E
50|$|The RAC has {{lobbied for}} {{continued}} improvements to Reid Highway, calling for <b>grade-separation</b> at the Malaga Drive intersection, {{and to make}} the highway a dual carriageway for its entire length. The WA State Government initially did not commit to further major upgrades, instead funding an upgrade to the turning lanes at the Malaga Drive intersection. In December 2012, the State Government announced that the Malaga Drive intersection would be grade separated by 2014-15, with work commencing in 2013-14. The project uses the same diamond interchange design that was constructed at Alexander Drive and Mirrabooka Avenue in 2011.|$|E

The section between Interstate 285 (I-285; Atlanta Bypass) and SR 140 (Jimmy Carter Boulevard) and concurrent with SR 141 in Norcross is a freeway. North of SR 140, Peachtree Industrial Boulevard splits from SR 141 and continues to the northeast as a highway with at least four lanes and center median, traveling through the cities of Peachtree Corners, Duluth, Suwanee, Sugar Hill, and Buford. This portion is maintained by Gwinnett County. In the future, the county plans a <b>grade-separation</b> upgrade for the portion between the SR 141 split and Sugarloaf Parkway.|$|E
50|$|Ryde Road {{was built}} in the early 1900s, after the first bridge was built across the steep valley formed by the Lane Cove River. Its name was derived from the simple fact that it leads to Ryde. In 1964, it was {{designated}} as a part of 'Ring Road 3' (later becoming Metroad 3 and A3). A new six-lane high-level bridge across the river in 1967, replacing the ricketty wooden structure and winding approaches, and Ryde Road was partly realigned and re-constructed from 2 lanes to 6 lanes to the Pacific Highway between 1967 and 1972. The <b>grade-separation</b> of the Pacific Highway junction, by building a tunnel under the highway and railway line connecting to Mona Vale Road, was completed in 1989.|$|E
5000|$|Mashhad Urban Railway (Ù‚Ø·Ø§Ø± Ø´Ù‡Ø±ÛŒ Ù…Ø´Ù‡Ø¯, {{the literal}} {{translation}} of the name from Persian) is a rapid transit urban rail line in Mashhad, Iran.

50|$|The Toronto Transit Commission's 85 Sheppard East and 190 Scarborough Centre Rocket bus routes links Agincourt Station to Don Mills {{station in}} the west, the 85 {{continues}} east into Scarborough while the 190 continues express to Scarborough Centre station. The proposed Sheppard East LRT would create a <b>grade-separation</b> of the rail line at Sheppard Avenue East (this started in December, 2009), with a connection from the LRT platform to the GO platform. But now it seems that plans {{have been made to}} build a second track from Agincourt to Markham GO so the line will operate on weekends. The Rob Ford administration saw a cancellation of the LRT projects, with an intended Sheppard subway line extension; however, on March 22, 2012 Toronto City council voted to reinstate the Sheppard LRT project and construction should restart sometime within the next few years.|$|E
5000|$|The line often {{operates}} at capacity, and various options {{to increase capacity}} have been considered, such as four-car trains or more frequent trains. Both have problems: {{it would be difficult}} or impossible to lengthen some of the station platforms, and the number of trains already causes delays for other vehicles at level crossings. Thus it may not be possible to increase Blue Line ridership without an extremely expensive <b>grade-separation</b> project, either by elevation, by an entrenchment method similar to that used by the nearby Alameda Corridor freight rail [...] "expressway", or by building another parallel transit corridor to relieve capacity strains from the Blue Line. When the Regional Connector project linking Blue and Expo Line tracks with the Gold Line tracks in Little Tokyo is completed, this may result in even more capacity problems, with ridership expected to grow even more once the connector is open for service.|$|E
