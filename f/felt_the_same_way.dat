500|$|Against {{calls for}} {{personal}} temperance instead of government restraint, Dow remained steadfast, {{saying that the}} only way to fight drunkenness was [...] "more jail for the rascals." [...] In 1876, he supported the election of Rutherford B. Hayes, a Republican and teetotaler. The following year, Dow saw some success for prohibition as Maine's legislature strengthened the weak prohibition law there by banning distilling in the state. Despite that minor victory, Dow began to sour on the Republican party, believing them insufficiently committed to his cause and disappointed at their failure to protect the rights of Southern blacks as Reconstruction came to an end. Other temperance advocates <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way,</b> and some had organized a new Prohibition Party in 1869. The Prohibitionists focused their efforts on banning alcohol to the exclusion of all other issues. Most party members came from pietist churches, and most, like Dow, were former Republicans. They had won very few votes in the 1872 and 1876 presidential elections, but as temperance advocates grew disenchanted with the Republican Party, they hoped to win converts in 1880.|$|E

40|$|Like activity-based workspaces, {{innovative}} {{spaces are}} {{deemed to be}} efficient and flexible, but they are most {{often called upon to}} support collaborative and creative team work instead of individual whom sometime will work in a team. Our research objective is to further explore the links between the project team and its space to identify advantages as well as drawbacks and to determine if the company benefits from the adoption of open creative space with diverse collaborative areas. A case study of one world class company with several teams and diverse spaces is in progress. Our results suggest that communication and coordination are well served by open creative spaces without negative impact on employees autonomy but intimacy is jeopardized which, paired with background noise that never stop, can lead to stress at work. This research shows that several elements of open spaces are <b>felt</b> in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> by a team or by department employees. But a team requires proximity that is essential to the exchange of information and coordination among the members while the lateral and hierarchical relationships are slightly redefined. Building managers needs to understand the percieved message that the individual receives from his organization through the design and allocation of spaces devoted to him and his team: freedom of action, empowerment to innovate or alienation to an environment that he does not control and which reduces him to a means of production until he leaves exhausted? The relationships between the feeling evoked by ambient conditions and their impacts on the individual, his tasks, his colleagues and his team is stronger than we could think. The temperature, the lighting as well as the variety of meeting rooms and their equipment’s form a complex whole of which we do not yet know all the impacts on the worker and the teams. Indeed, the diversity of spaces and their equipment fits perfectly into the teams' activities, resulting in a positive synergy in terms of coordination, communication and creativity. Creative spaces deserve their name when it comes to teamwork...|$|R
500|$|Measure for Measure has {{frequently}} {{been considered a}} [...] "problem play". It was a problem for Hazlitt in that it contains almost no character with whom one can feel complete sympathy.

[...] Angelo, the Deputy ruler of Vienna, is forgiven by the Duke but draws only Hazlitt's hatred, as [...] "he {{seems to have a}} much greater passion for hypocrisy than for his mistress." [...] "Neither are we enamoured of Isabella's rigid chastity, though she could not act otherwise than she did." [...] Isabella's brother Claudio [...] "is the only person who feels naturally", yet even he does not show well in his pleading for life at the sacrifice of his sister's virginity. There is no easy solution for his plight, and [...] "he is placed in circumstances of distress which almost preclude the wish for his deliverance." [...] Over a century later, commentator R.W. Chambers placed Hazlitt as the first of a long line of notable Shakespearean critics who <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way,</b> and he quoted Characters of Shakespear's Plays in establishing his contention (as a basis for arguing his own different view of the play) that Hazlitt was among the first of dozens of distinguished critics who could not comprehend how Mariana could love and plead for someone like Angelo, and in general showed a distaste for much in Measure for Measure.|$|E

One of the conditions of Aden's tenancy was to never sleep with Nicole, this made the pair feel guilty that they had deceived Roman. Lasance felt the storyline was controversial as he had a strong fan base for his relationship with Belle Taylor (Jessica Tovey) - which meant he knew it would [...] "cause a stir" [...] and divide the audience.

40|$|This {{project is}} largely {{creative}} in nature offering {{the first half}} of a now published novel entitled Stranger Than Kindness and a textual and critical analysis of that novel that explores the experience of traumatized or ‘bruised’ nurses. The novel, half set in 1989 and half set in 2013, follows the clinical and personal traumatization of two nurses and their tentative steps towards restoration. It reveals a backdrop of a sometimes subtle institutionalized brutality and a culture that lends itself to the individual collection or absorption of difficulty. It uses gentle magical realism to counterpoint the gritty backdrop of the pre-community care asylum of the 1980 s and the neoliberal, free market setting of the modern world of healthcare {{in the second half of}} the book. It’s dénouement is a celebration of whimsy in the face of hard industrialized science. The novel reveals the capacity of the nurse to collect emotional residue, trauma or bruising and be both changed and hurt by the experience of care to the point of being damaged. It essentially resorts to poetics to explore the ‘felt’ world of the nurse or carer. In tone and in theme the book is a novel of the emotions. Valuing an emotional literacy over medical rationalism, it seeks to gently reclaim the idea that caring for others is a pursuit or enactment of embodied wisdom rather than just the exercising of scientific knowledge. The critical discussion uses the text of the novel to make three observations in relation to the research question. The first is that the question is political. It is strikingly unaddressed in policy responses to ‘The Francis Report’ (2013) and perhaps in terms of mainstream research it is unaskable because it addresses <b>the</b> <b>felt</b> world. In <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> that <b>the</b> novel explores a hierarchy of values in the caring profession, the ensuing critical discussion reveals a hierarchy of knowledge. The second observation is that it is our tacit understanding of what reason is and how we make sense of the world we have constructed that helps make questions about bruised or damaged nurses somehow beyond convention. Iain McGilchrist’s The Master And His Emissary (2009) offers a way of making sense of that by exploring the contemporary imbalance between the logical and linear thinking of the left hemisphere and the integrative and imaginative right hemisphere. We have come to prize the measurable over the experiential or contextual and reflective to such an extent that we organize the world accordingly. The third observation, which emerges from the first two and the novel, is the suggestion that nursing is assuming an ill-fitting Cartesian epistemology that cannot do justice to its breadth or holistic need. I suggest that a philosophy that took clearer account of the body, the senses and <b>the</b> <b>felt</b> world would more comfortably accommodate and legislate for the needs of the nurse and the profession of nursing. An embodied realism (Lakoff and Johnson, 1999) that emerges from Damasio (2000, 2012) and Merleau-Ponty (2005) offers the potential to restore a more balanced and less reductionist philosophy that might enable a fuller and more person-centred response to the nursing crises. A further more general observation the thesis makes is that fiction can inform social science and offers a way in which it can do that. Thus it finds itself in a tradition of narrative inquiry (Clandinin and Connelly, 2000). However, it also notices the potential paradox in valuing art as a sociological resource: something that offers us knowledge, meaning and even moral review while turning to cognitive neuroscience to legitimize that methodology...|$|R
