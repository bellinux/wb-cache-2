40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{achievable}} data rate of cooperative relaying strategies in networks where nodes operate in half-duplex mode.

Furthermore, we devise two kinds of communication strategies, each aiming at a different objective. The former ensures a fair rate allocation to the network nodes, but it neglects their energy constraints. The latter does consider energy constraints by meeting the requirements on the average power consumption at each node and by providing fairness in the data rate allocation.

40|$|Sustainability is {{becoming}} {{an integral part of}} the life-cycle development of built facilities. It is increasingly highlighted during the post construction phase, as facility management personnel can have major influence to the sustainability agenda through operational and strategic management functions. Sustainable practices in facility management can bring substantial benefits such as reducing energy consumption and waste, while increasing productivity, financial return and corporate standing in the community. Despite the potential, facility managers have yet to embrace sustainability ideas holistically and implement them in their operation. The lack of capabilities and skills coupled with knowledge gaps are among the barriers. In the developmental context, capabilities are vital to foster the competency of an organisation. Facility managers need to be empowered with the necessary knowledge, capabilities and skills to support sustainability. This research investigates the potential people <b>capabilities</b> <b>factors</b> that can assist in the implementation of sustainability agenda in facility management practices. Through questionnaire survey, twenty three critical people <b>capability</b> <b>factors</b> were identified and encapsulated into a conceptual framework. The critical factors were separated into four categories of strategic capabilities, anticipatory capabilities, interpersonal capabilities and system thinking capabilities. Pair-wise comparison and Interpretive Structural Modelling techniques were then used to further explore the interrelationship and influence of each critical factor. An interpretive structural model for people capability was developed to identify the priority of critical factors and provide a hierarchical structure to guide facility managers for appropriate actions. The research concludes with three case-studies of professional facility management practices to finalise the developed people capabilities framework and interpretive structural model. Through the identification and integration of different perceptions and priority needs of the stakeholders, a set of guidelines for action and potential effects of each people <b>capability</b> <b>factor</b> were brought forward for the industry to promote sustainability endeavour in facility management practices...|$|R

40|$|Modern power DMOS {{transistors}} greatly {{benefit from}} the continuous advances of the technology, which yield devices with very low area-specific RDS,on figures of merit and therefore allow for significantly reduced active areas. However, in many applications, where the devices must dissipate high amounts of energy and thus are subjected to significant self-heating, the active area is not dictated by RDS,on requirements, but by the energy constraints. In this paper, a simple method of improving the <b>energy</b> <b>capability</b> and reliability of power DMOS transistors operating in pulsed conditions is proposed and experimentally verified. The method consists in redistributing the power density from the hotter to the cooler device regions, hence achieving a more homogeneous temperature distribution and a reduced peak temperature. To demonstrate the principle, a simple gate offset circuit is used to redistribute the current density to the cooler DMOS parts. No technology changes are needed for the implementation, only {{minor changes to the}} driver circuit are necessary, with a minimal impact on the additional required active area. Improvements in the <b>energy</b> <b>capability</b> from 9. 2 % up to 39 % have been measured.
