5|$|Amplexus {{between the}} male and female occurs mainly in water, but {{sometimes}} at substantial distances away on dry land. Observations of breeding sites <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>the</b> males linger around the courting area for much longer times, while females mostly stay at other places to find food before meeting the males there. During amplexus, the males grab the females near their armpits after climbing on their backs. In the wild, amplexus usually takes between 10 minutes and five days. Artificially induced amplexus in the laboratory has been observed to last 50 hours, but there have been reports of five days. Sometimes, amplexus will not result in eggs being laid.|$|E
5|$|Critics of {{the system}} suggest that rules {{for the use of}} DRS have created an {{inconsistency}} of approach to lbw decisions depending on the circumstances of the referral. Opponents also doubt that the ball-tracking technology used in deciding lbws is reliable enough, but the ICC state that tests <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>the</b> system to be 100% accurate. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) have consistently declined to use DRS in matches involving India owing to their concerns regarding the ball-tracking technology. Early DRS trials were conducted during India matches, and several problems arose over lbws, particularly as the equipment was not as advanced as it later became. The BCCI believe the technology is unreliable and open to manipulation.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} effect of winter and spring sowing on yield and plant traits of safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.) cultivars under Tekirdağ conditions. This research was conducted at Applying Research Field, Faculty of Agriculture University of Namık Kemal in 2006 - 2007. Fourteen safflower cultivars were used in this study. The research was conducted using a randomized complete block, split plot design with three replicates. Different sowing time significantly affected some agronomic characters of the genotypes used in this study. There was interaction between genotypes and sowing times. According to the results of this research; Yenice <b>has</b> <b>showed</b> <b>the</b> tallest values in winter sowing 207. 5 cm for plant height, Montola 2000 <b>has</b> <b>showed</b> <b>the</b> smallest values in spring sowing 55. 2 cm for plant height.

5|$|Hopping or jumping is conceptually {{the most}} basic {{mechanism}} for diffusion of adatoms. In this model, the adatoms reside on adsorption sites on the surface lattice. Motion occurs through successive jumps to adjacent sites, the number of which depends {{on the nature of}} the surface lattice. Figures 1 and 3 both display adatoms undergoing diffusion via the hopping process. Studies <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>the</b> presence of metastable transition states between adsorption sites wherein it may be possible for adatoms to temporarily reside.|$|E
5|$|In {{other parts}} of the body, {{circulation}} in the lymphatic vasculature clears extracellular waste products from the cell tissue. For the tissue of the brain, such a system has not yet been identified. However, the presence of a glymphatic pathway has been proposed. Newer studies from two laboratories <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>the</b> presence of meningeal lymphatic vessels running alongside the blood vessels, and these have been shown with lymph valves, to be more extensive {{at the base of the}} brain where they exit with the cranial nerves.|$|E
5|$|In the tropics, many {{amphibians}} breed continuously or at {{any time}} of year. In temperate regions, breeding is mostly seasonal, usually in the spring, and is triggered by increasing day length, rising temperatures or rainfall. Experiments <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>the</b> importance of temperature, but the trigger event, especially in arid regions, is often a storm. In anurans, males usually arrive at the breeding sites before females and the vocal chorus they produce may stimulate ovulation in females and the endocrine activity of males that are not yet reproductively active.|$|E

5|$|The jaguar, Panthera onca, is {{the only}} extant New World member of the genus Panthera. DNA {{evidence}} shows the lion, tiger, leopard, jaguar, snow leopard, and clouded leopard share a common ancestor, and that this group is between six and ten million years old; the fossil record points {{to the emergence of}} Panthera just two to 3.8 million years ago. Phylogenetic studies generally <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>the</b> clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa) is basal to this group. The position of the remaining species varies between studies and is effectively unresolved.|$|E
5|$|Human {{occupation}} continued {{throughout the}} Iron Age. A stone enclosure was constructed around 300 BC with timber revetting, and ploughing ceased within the hilltop site. Excavations <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>the</b> signs {{of four and}} six post rectangular buildings which were gradually replaced with roundhouses. Large ramparts and elaborate timber defences were constructed and refortified over the following centuries. Excavation revealed round and rectangular house foundations, metalworking, and a possible sequence of small rectangular temples or shrines, indicating permanent oppidum-like occupation. Excavations were undertaken by local clergyman James Bennett in 1890 and Harold St George Gray in 1913, followed by major work led by archaeologist Leslie Alcock from 1966–1970. He identified a long sequence of occupation on the site {{and many of the}} finds are displayed in the Museum of Somerset in Taunton. The finds from the Late Bronze Age to the Early Iron Age, exploring the ramparts and southwestern gate structure, represent one of the deepest and most complex Iron Age stratigraphic sequences excavated in southern Britain.|$|E

5|$|In humans, {{cells with}} location-specific firing {{patterns}} {{have been reported}} during a study of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. They were undergoing an invasive procedure to localize {{the source of their}} seizures, with a view to surgical resection. The patients had diagnostic electrodes implanted in their hippocampus and then used a computer to move around in a virtual reality town. Similar brain imaging studies in navigation <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>the</b> hippocampus to be active. A study was carried out on taxi drivers. London’s black cab drivers need to learn the locations {{of a large number of}} places and the fastest routes between them in order to pass a strict test known as The Knowledge in order to gain a license to operate. A study showed that the posterior part of the hippocampus is larger in these drivers than in the general public, and that a positive correlation exists between the length of time served as a driver and the increase in the volume of this part. It was also found the total volume of the hippocampus was unchanged, as the increase seen in the posterior part was made at the expense of the anterior part, which showed a relative decrease in size. There have been no reported adverse effects from this disparity in hippocampal proportions.|$|E
5|$|Queen Mary, {{along with}} the other Jutland wrecks, has been {{declared}} a protected place under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 to discourage further damage to the resting place of 1,266 officers and men. Surveys of this site conducted by nautical archaeologist Innes McCartney in 2001–03 <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>the</b> wreck is in three sections, with the two forward sections being heavily damaged and in pieces. Her aft end is upside down and relatively complete except for her propellers, which have been salvaged. Examination of the damage to the ship has suggested that the initial explosion was not in the magazine of 'A' or 'B' forward main turrets, but instead in the magazine of the forward 4-inch battery. An explosion of the quantity of cordite in the main magazine would have been sufficient to also ignite 'Q' magazine, destroying much more of the ship. The explosion in the smaller magazine would have been sufficient to break the ship in two, the blast then spreading to the forward magazine and ripping apart the forward section.|$|E
5|$|The sand whiting is a {{schooling}} species, whose {{movements are}} associated with a variety of factors including prey, lunar patterns and spawning movements; although there appears to be little consistency in its movements in relation to these factors. Studies on the species over the period of a year <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>the</b> species does not change its local distribution {{over the course of a}} day, generally being of the same abundance during both night and day. Seasonal abundance due to spawning is variable, with studies conducted in Moreton Bay, Queensland finding the species recruits heavily to shallow waters and increase numbers during winter months, while studies in the Noosa River estuary have shown no difference in numbers recruited over the course of a season. Like other sillaginids, they have the ability to 'burrow' into the sand and remained hidden until a predator or seine net has passed by.|$|E

5|$|The {{story of}} Kingsglaive was based around {{a portion of}} the {{original}} opening of Final Fantasy XV, which would <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>the</b> invasion of Insomnia by Niflheim's army. This had to be cut from the game due to concerns over the volume of content, but as the team still wanted to show this event, they incorporated it into the plot of Kingsglaive. To ensure a connection between the movie and the game, both projects used the same shared script as their core. That script was written by Saori Itamuro based on a draft by Kazushige Nojima. The team also wanted a proper cinematic experience that would appeal to a large audience, so they brought in a professional screenwriter, Takashi Hasegawa, to create a full-length cinematic script. Los Angeles-based company Hydra Entertainment assisted with creating the script alongside Hasegawa, in addition to writing assistance from Hollywood staff. The storyline was designed to complement and {{set the stage for the}} events of Final Fantasy XV without revealing major plot elements from the game. The movie was created for a primarily English audience, with the script translation handled by Square Enix's in-house localization team. As many team members were Final Fantasy fans, frequent nostalgic references to earlier entries in the series were included.|$|E
