40|$|Current {{views of}} {{sustainability}} expect <b>digital</b> <b>ecologies,</b> networked knowledge translated into biomaterial ecologies of consumption or applied design. This expectation {{emerges as a}} regulation of the current extended networks of production brought about by twentieth century networks of design. Such networks are characterised by their attachment to the materialities of design; both in the collective appreciation of ‘design’ in our material world and in the physical links that bind ‘designers’ together; their co-study, co-practice and co-presence in studio. However, the more modern knowledge economy is explained as the separation of design from its material expression, saliently exemplified by certain processes of branding. The industrialisation of emergent economies proceeds through the migration of production into less developed economies with design activity remaining in developed economies., My paper situates the importance of historicity in having induced the design network’s rôle gauging reverberations in the global economy. I analyse <b>digital</b> <b>ecologies</b> in their nexus between representing the dissociation of design and material and the manifesting the grown of designed economies.

Del Favero, Brown, Shaw and Weibel have explained that traditionally narrative is conceptualized as mono-temporal and linear whereas interactive narrative is commonly understood as non-linear. In contrast to this, in T_Visionarium narrative {{is to be}} understood as [...] "multi-temporal", a concept that alleviates the sharp distinction between linear and non-linear narratives 9. They explain this concept as the mingling of virtual time and real time. This occurs in T_Visionarium as the viewer searches the televisual database in virtual time and experiences the consequences of this navigation in real time. Tim Barker builds on this description to situate the [...] "multi-temporal" [...] in T_Visionarium as the consequence of the viewer's ability to access multiple temporal episodes simultaneously. As each television clip represents different time periods, the result of accessing these all at once is what he refers to as a [...] "multi-temporal duration", a duration of time that is made up of multiple and differentiated representations of time 10. In this model of interaction, the viewer and the database form [...] "…a <b>digital</b> <b>ecology</b> able to generate unprecedented aesthetic and social meanings" [...] 11. In other words, the viewer and the database of T_Visionarium collaborate to generate the narrative events that constitute T_Visionarium.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. There is {{an ongoing}} {{discussion}} in HCI {{on the need for}} new theories, methods and techniques to assist researchers and practitioners in both the design of better digital artifacts and effective evaluation of them. As part of this discussion we observe a recent trend where researchers from the IT domain present various definitions of ecologies, approaching the question, “What is a <b>digital</b> <b>ecology?</b> ” from various perspectives. This paper reviews existing definitions, comparing their strengthens and weaknesses and presents a unified definition of digital ecologies, through a theoretical discussion based on systems thinking. It is our ambition that this paper will inspire deeper consideration on what constitutes a <b>digital</b> <b>ecology</b> and how this view of technology affects existing design and evaluation methods and techniques...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Different {{approaches}} for engineering multi-agent {{systems have been}} proposed over time. However, {{there is a lack}} of attention towards the social aspects of multi-agent systems. In this paper we present an approach for engineering multi-agent systems, which considers multi-agent systems as <b>digital</b> <b>ecologies.</b> Different agent ecologies can work together and act as digital ecosystem. In such ecosystem the social aspects of the agents are well defined and all the subcomponents of the multi-agent system work together to achieve a fine integration of the whole ecosystem. Instead of focusing on internal model of software agents our methodology attempts to capture the dynamic and social behaviors of agents by focusing on the cooperation, coordination, negotiation and management attributes of the system. From implementation point of view, the proposed engineering methodology is grounded in our multi-agent framework and the concepts developed using this methodology can be mapped to implementation easily. The framework provides support for integration of web-services and uses peer-to-peer approach for resource discovering...|$|R

With the dramatic growth of digital {{information in the}} world, organizations, {{in an age of}} information ecology can easily be affected by the consequences of information {{ecological imbalance}}. This imbalance may be triggered by maladjustment of the circulation in the system, by the abnormal flowing of some kinds of information, or the malfunction of some components in the chain of information flow. An information flow intervention approach, which imposes some control over information flow by means of semantic annotation, is proposed from the perspective of operationality and feasibility. The principal components in the proposed model are explained and the working principle of the model is explained. This research aims to realize ecological balance in a digital ecosystem by intervening in the flow of information, and consequently, providing some mechanism that will lead to the universal governance of the digital ecosystem...|$|E

However, this simplified approach yields sufficiently accurate time-series (depicting the business growth) extendable to forecasting regimes. The efficacy of the proposed method is determined via goodness-fit evaluations both in time- and frequency-domains.

40|$|This chapter {{explores the}} {{challenges}} of sustaining <b>digital</b> <b>ecologies</b> {{within the context of}} a postmodern era that has been characterized by limitlessness. Rejecting a simple model of growth that looks only to increase resources (more computers, more hardware, more personnel), I propose a development model that engages the real material, social, and psychological limits of a digital commons. This model of a digital commons intersects Garret Hardin’s ecological rivalrous commons with Lawrence Lessig’s construct of the innovations commons. Hardin’s work posits that shared physical spaces (like pastures) have material limits and that individuals will act in self-interest to maximize their use of such space, depleting resources until they disappear. Hardin advocates the imposition of limits (i. e., use laws) to protect the commons against destructive self-interest. Lessig contrasts this model with the “innovation commons ” of the Internet, which depends on use. Open-source code, for example, encourages the exchange of innovation. The more that users can access and improve code, the more the innovation commons will improve. But intellectual property laws limit such exchange, consequently depleting the availability and development of ideas. A digital commons thus requires rivalrous as well as innovative commons for sustainability. The sustaining of such a complex commons must therefore engage with the panorama of limits, which are neither good nor bad, but, instead, warrant careful attention by those seeking to develop thoughtful, creative, and nimble pedagogical uses of cyberspace...|$|R

The new emerging platforms transform the concept of compatibility in the mobile ecology.

40|$|In this paper, {{we offer}} a new {{conceptual}} approach to analyzing the interrelations between {{formal and informal}} pedagogical sites for learning about youth mental (ill) health with a specific focus on digital health technologies. Our approach builds on an understanding of public pedagogy to examine the pedagogical modes of address (Ellsworth 1997) that are (i) produced through ‘expert’ discourses of mental health literacy for young people; and (ii) include digital practices created by young people as they seek to publicly address mental ill health through social media platforms. We trace the pedagogic modes of address that are evident in examples of digital mental health practices {{and the creation of}} what we call therapeutic publics. Through an analysis of mental health apps, we examine how these modes of address are implicated in the affective process of learning about mental (ill) health, and the affective arrangements through which embodied distress is rendered culturally intelligible. In doing so, we situate the use of individual mental health apps within a broader <b>digital</b> <b>ecology</b> that is mediated by therapeutic expertise and offer original contributions to the theorization of public pedagogy...|$|E

40|$|Early 21 st century {{societies}} are evolving into {{a hybrid of}} real and synthetic worlds where everyday activities are mediated by technology. The result is {{a new generation of}} users extending their everyday experiences into these emerging <b>digital</b> <b>ecologies.</b> However, what happens when users re-create their human identity in these spaces? How do the tools of new technologies such as the mobile phone allow them to capture and share their experiences? In order to address these issues this chapter presents the findings from a three-year study into mobile phone use in urban culture. The study revealed that for a new generation the mobile was integral in the formation of fluid social interactions and had accelerated urban mobility. Users once restrained by pre-made plans were able to spontaneously traverse the city and suburbs, swarming between friendship groups and activities. Distinct user archetypes were emerging from these mobile phone driven sub-cultures whose practices were bringing about fundamental changes in social mores with respect to engagement and commitment, to notions of fluid time versus fixed time and ultimately to urban mobility. Connectivity had become central to what it means to have a social identity and users were responding to this by merging bits of data to create their 'ideal digital self' through which they communicate socially. Yet, recent developments in mobile phone design reveal the potential {{for a new generation of}} people to recontextualize their use in a way that moves beyond 'the social', as they utilise sensors and data capturing and sharing functionalities in new mobile devices to augment their 'social butterfly' identity with an ideology of a 'socially conscious urban citizen'...|$|R
40|$|Sounds of the Suburb was a {{commissioned}} {{public art}} proposal {{based upon a}} brief set by Queensland Rail for the major redevelopment at their Brunswick Street Railway Station, Fortitude Valley, Brisbane. I proposed a large scale, electronic artwork to be distributed across the glass fronted structure of their station’s new concourse building. It {{was designed as a}} network of LED based ‘tracking’ - along which would travel electronically animated, ‘trains’ of text synchronised to the actual train timetables. Each message packet moved endlessly through a complex spatial network of ‘tracks’ and ‘stations’ set both inside, outside and via the concourse. The design was underpinned by large scale image of sound waves etched onto the architecture’s glass and was accompanied by two inset monitors each presenting ghosted images of passenger movements within the concourse, time-delay recorded and then cross-combined in realtime to form new composites. [...] - Each moving, reprogrammable phrase was conceived as a ‘train of thought’ and ostensibly contained an idea or concept about popular cultures surrounding contemporary music – thereby meeting the brief that the work should speak to the diverse musical cultures central to Fortitude Valley’s image as an entertainment hub. These cultural ‘memes’, gathered from both passengers and the music press were situated alongside quotes from philosophies of networking, speed and <b>digital</b> <b>ecologies.</b> These texts would continually propagate, replicate and cross fertlise as they moved throughout the ‘network’, thereby writing a constantly evolving ‘textual soundcape’ of that place.
