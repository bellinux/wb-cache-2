A detailed narrative of his activities during the 1916 Rising is contained in a handwritten letter he sent in 1937 to Máire English, supporting her claim to a Military Service Pension.

50|$|The {{idea for}} the show came from the UK {{programme}} Police Five and the German Aktenzeichen XY … ungelöst (<b>File</b> <b>Reference</b> XY … Unsolved). Producers viewed the shows and rejected the overt reconstructions with music to build suspense in America's Most Wanted, and were also against the idea of filming the reconstruction {{from the perspective of}} the offender as in Aktenzeichen XY … ungelöst (particularly for sexual assaults). However, they favoured the idea of audience participation in the show. It started as Crimewatch UK and was due to run for three programmes only. It was regarded as an experiment when it was first shown, partly because of doubts about whether police would take part, whether witnesses and victims would welcome the idea, whether it would actually lead to arrests, and whether it could be considered to prejudice a jury. In over 25 years, 57 murderers, 53 rapists and sex offenders, 18 paedophiles, and others were captured as a direct result of Crimewatch appeals.|$|E

40|$|Presented is a user-oriented {{analysis}} of short term file usage in a 4. 2 BSD UNIX environment. The key {{aspect of this}} analysis is a characterization of users and files, which is {{a departure from the}} traditional approach of analyzing <b>file</b> <b>references.</b> Two characterization measures are employed: accesses-per-byte (combining fraction of a <b>file</b> <b>referenced</b> and number of <b>references)</b> and <b>file</b> size. This new approach is shown to distinguish differences in files as well as users, which cam be used in efficient file system design, and in creating realistic test workloads for simulations. A multi-stage gamma distribution is shown to closely model the file usage measures. Even though overall file sharing is small, some files belonging to a bulletin board system are accessed by many users, simultaneously and otherwise. Over 50 % of users <b>referenced</b> <b>files</b> owned by other users, and over 80 % of all files were involved in such references.

40|$|Most modern cache systems {{treat each}} access as an {{independent}} event. Events in a computer system, however are driven by programs. Thus, accesses occur in distinct sequences and {{are by no means}} random. The result is that modern caches ignore useful information. In a Unix file system, when the executable for the program make is referenced, it is likely that references to files such as cc, as, and ld will soon follow. To successfully track the <b>file</b> <b>reference</b> patterns, a model must efficiently handle the large number of distinct files, as well as the constant addition and removal of files. To further complicate matters, the permanent nature of a file system requires that this model be able to run continuously, forcing any realistic model to address issues of long-term model buildup and adapting to changing patterns. We have adapted a multi-order context modeling technique used in the data compression method Prediction by Partial Match (PPM) to track <b>file</b> <b>reference</b> patterns. We then modifi [...] ...|$|E
