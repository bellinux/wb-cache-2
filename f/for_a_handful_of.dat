5|$|In {{neighbouring}} Denmark, motte-and-bailey castles appeared somewhat {{later in}} the 12th and 13th centuries and in more limited numbers than elsewhere, due to the less feudal society. Except <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> <b>of</b> mote and bailey castles in Norway, built {{in the first half}} of the 11th century and including the royal residence in Oslo, the design did not play a role further north in Scandinavia.|$|E
5|$|Case Closed was {{conceived}} in 1994, during {{the rise of}} mystery genre manga due to the publishing of the Kindaichi Case Files series; the first chapter appeared in Shogakukan's Weekly Shōnen Sunday on January 19. Aoyama cites the stories of Arsène Lupin, Sherlock Holmes and the samurai films by Akira Kurosawa as influences on his work. When scripting each chapter, he ensures the dialogue remains simple and spends an average of four hours for each new case and twelve for more complicated ones. Each case spans several chapters (except <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> <b>of</b> shorter cases that only span one), and is resolved at the end where characters explain {{the details of their}} solutions in simple terms; a database consisting of all the cases from the manga was launched in 2007.|$|E

5|$|In 2002, Mya Breitbart, Forest Rohwer, {{and colleagues}} used {{environmental}} shotgun sequencing (see below) {{to show that}} 200 liters of seawater contains over 5000 different viruses. Subsequent studies showed {{that there are more}} than a thousand viral species in human stool and possibly a million different viruses per kilogram of marine sediment, including many bacteriophages. Essentially all of the viruses in these studies were new species. In 2004, Gene Tyson, Jill Banfield, and colleagues at the University of California, Berkeley and the Joint Genome Institute sequenced DNA extracted from an acid mine drainage system. This effort resulted in the complete, or nearly complete, genomes <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> <b>of</b> bacteria and archaea that had previously resisted attempts to culture them.|$|E
5|$|Somewhere premiered at the 67th Venice International Film Festival {{where it}} {{received}} the Golden Lion {{award for best}} picture. Critical opinion was mildly positive. Reviewers praised the patience of the film's visual style and its empathy <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> <b>of</b> characters, but some found Somewhere to be too repetitive of themes in Coppola's previous work, or did not sympathize with the protagonist because of his relative success. It was released to theaters in the United Kingdom and Ireland on December 10, 2010, and in the United States on December 22, 2010.|$|E
5|$|Susan is {{identified}} as Mike's bride in the sixth season premiere. Her marriage to Mike destroys her friendship with Katherine. After the wedding, Julie is strangled outside of Susan's home. Julie slips into a coma following her attack. While {{waiting for her to}} awaken, Susan learns that Julie had dropped out of medical school, was involved with a married man, and had a pregnancy scare before her attack. When Julie awakens, she refuses to identify the married man she was seeing. Later in the season, Julie's attacker is revealed to be Eddie Orlofsky (Josh Zuckerman), a local young adult who is also responsible <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> <b>of</b> murders in Fairview. Prior to the attack, Susan had taken Eddie on as an art student and he developed a crush on her. When he discovered that she was remarrying Mike and that she did not see him as a romantic suitor, he attacked Julie, mistaking her for Susan.|$|E

5|$|By 1904, Crawford {{dominated}} the Repton team. He scored 759 runs and his 75 wickets {{were more than}} the combined total {{of all the other}} bowlers in the team. He was particularly effective in the school's most important fixtures. The report in Wisden described him as possibly the best amateur bowler in England that year: he bowled medium-paced off spin, although he varied the speed of his delivery from slow to fast. Surrey County Cricket Club took an interest in Crawford almost immediately, calling him to a trial in 1903. Following his achievements in 1904, he was invite to play for the county. The county club {{was in the midst of}} a spell of uncertainty; several men captained the team, but only <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> <b>of</b> matches each. The composition of the side continually changed, and the team performed poorly, causing unrest among supporters accustomed to success. Crawford was just one of many players brought in as an experiment, albeit one of the most successful. He made his first-class debut against Kent. Taking three wickets and top-scoring in Surrey's first innings with 54, Crawford did well enough to retain his place for another seven games, and was praised in the press for his performances. Against Gloucestershire, he took seven wickets for 43 runs in the second innings, and a total of ten wickets in the match. In the season as a whole he took 44 first-class wickets at an average of 16.93 to top the county's bowling averages, and scored 229 runs at an average of 16.35.|$|E

25|$|By 1935, low-definition {{electromechanical}} {{television broadcasting}} had ceased in the United States except <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> <b>of</b> stations run by public universities that continued to 1939. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) saw {{television in the}} continual flux of development with no consistent technical standards, hence all such stations in the U.S. were granted only experimental and non-commercial licenses, hampering television's economic development. Just as importantly, Philo Farnsworth's August 1934 demonstration of an all-electronic system at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia pointed out the direction of television's future.|$|E
25|$|In early November 2006, Josh Eppard and Michael Todd {{left the}} band for {{personal}} reasons, forcing Matt Williams and the band's drum technician, Michael Petrak, {{to fill out}} temporarily the band's rhythm section <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> <b>of</b> shows. In April 2007, bassist Michael Todd rejoined Coheed and Cambria, and the band entered the Los Angeles-based studio with new producer Nick Raskulinecz. The following June Chris Pennie, formerly of the Dillinger Escape Plan, joined Coheed and Cambria as its drummer, but due to contractual restrictions with his previous record label, Pennie did not appear on the band's fourth release. Instead, Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins recorded the drums, making use of several ideas Pennie had previously written in correspondence with Sanchez.|$|E
25|$|NY631 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY370 near {{the eastern edge}} of Baldwinsville. The route heads northeastward through a residential section of town of Lysander, paralleling the Baldwinsville village line to an intersection with NY31 across from an Anheuser-Busch brewery. At this point, NY631 turns eastward, overlapping with NY31 for a half-mile (0.8km) to the southwestern edge of Lysander's Radisson community. The routes split here, with NY631 heading northward into a commercial district as a four-lane divided highway named Willett Parkway. The commercial properties give way to homes at a junction with the two-lane West Entry Road, where NY631 turns west to bypass northeast Baldwinsville. While on West Entry Road, the highway crosses mostly undeveloped areas, save <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> <b>of</b> industrial complexes along the highway.|$|E

25|$|Purvis and Finch {{looked toward}} 1997 with high hopes, but Finch {{informed}} Purvis {{that the team}} could not run a full season without solid sponsorship. After running the first four races, and only a 9th at Daytona to show for it, Finch and Purvis parted. Purvis went and teamed with Larry Lockamy to drive the No. 28 Opryland Chevy <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> <b>of</b> races. At Nashville Speedway USA, Purvis made his first start in the No. 28 and showed off with a 4th-place finish. Back at Myrtle Beach, Purvis started 2nd and finished 8th. Meanwhile, Finch was finalizing his deal to get Purvis back. At Homestead-Miami, Purvis debuted the No. 4 Lance Snacks Chevy, but finished 38th in the race. Despite only running ten races, the three top-10s allowed Purvis to finish 44th in points.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the First World War {{there was a sense of}} dissatisfaction in how honours were distributed. The effect was the passage of the Nickel Resolution. The resolution created a policy of Canadians not being appointed to peerages or titular honours, and the government of Canada only making recommendation <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> <b>of</b> non-titular honours. In 1931, the Statute of Westminster reaffirmed the equality of the self-governing dominions of the British Empire, however there was no mechanism to establish honours specific to the dominions. In 1935, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Long Service Medal was established as the first award specifically for service in Canada. The Canadian government managed the creation of this medal by passing the recommendation for creating the honour on to the Dominions Office, who had experience with drafting Royal Warrants. In 1934, King George V signed the Royal Warrant creating the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Long Service Medal. Prime Minister R.B. Bennett countersigned the Royal Warrant 15 December 1934 signifying that the King was acting on the advice of his Canadian Ministry.|$|E
25|$|In 1975, Elmore, Duncan, Valenti, Freiberg and Cipollina {{recorded}} a reunion album, Solid Silver, on Capitol Records. The album also included contributions {{from a variety}} of Bay Area musicians, including former keyboardist Nicky Hopkins, session vocalist Kathi McDonald and Jefferson Starship multi-instrumentalist Pete Sears. Freiberg had initially replaced Marty Balin in Jefferson Airplane following his release from prison in 1972 and remained with the group as they evolved into the mammothly successful Jefferson Starship. Released in November 1975, it fared better from a commercial and critical standpoint than the preceding two albums but only managed to peak at No. 89. While Freiberg elected not to rejoin the live group {{as a result of his}} Jefferson Starship commitments, Cipollina, keyboardist Michael Lewis and bassist Skip Olsen toured with the returning trio <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> <b>of</b> concerts in 1975, culminating in an appearance at San Francisco's Winterland Ballroom on December 28. Shortly thereafter, Cipollina departed once again and the remaining quintet continued to tour clubs intermittently until finally dissolving in 1979.|$|E
