25|$|Ion {{exchange}} chromatography (usually {{referred to}} as ion chromatography) uses an ion exchange mechanism to separate analytes based on their respective charges. It is usually performed in columns but can also be useful in planar mode. Ion exchange chromatography uses a charged stationary phase to separate charged compounds including anions, cations, amino acids, peptides, and proteins. In conventional methods the stationary phase is an ion exchange resin that carries charged functional groups that interact with oppositely charged groups of the compound to retain. There {{are two types of}} ion exchange chromatography: Cation-Exchange and Anion-Exchange. In the Cation-Exchange Chromatography the stationary phase has negative charge and the <b>exchangeable</b> <b>ion</b> is a cation, whereas, in the Anion-Exchange Chromatography the stationary phase has positive charge and the <b>exchangeable</b> <b>ion</b> is an anion.

The similarity of the Vmax. values for various <b>exchangeable</b> <b>ions</b> but the difference of this from the Vmax. in the absence of <b>exchangeable</b> <b>ions</b> may indicate that transport of pyruvate occurs with H+ and not in exchange for an OH- ion. The inhibition of transport by alpha-cyano- 4 -hydroxycinnamate took several seconds to reach completion at 0 degrees C.

The inhibitor can be displaced by substrates that can also enter the mitochondria independently of the carrier and so compete with the inhibitor for the substrate-binding site on the inside of the membrane. A mechanism for transport is proposed that invokes a transition state of pyruvate involving addition of an -SH group to the 2 -carbon of pyruvate.

The effect of various parameters influencing contact angle measurements such as relative humidity (RH), particle size and surface roughness has also been examined.

As far as the effect of particle size is concerned, the results obtained on montmorillonite of four different sizes show that the smallest angles are obtained on films of particles of the smallest sizes for a given <b>exchangeable</b> <b>ion.</b> This is clearly linked to differences in roughness that were deduced by analysing Atomic Force Microscopy experiments.

The finer particle size clinoptilolite had a greater capacity to remove metal cations from aqueous solution. However, ion-exchange results from atomic absorption analysis showed that the larger particle sizes, removed more magnesium ions.

The published article is copyrighted by Springer and can be found at: [URL] trace element molybdenum (Mo) is essential to a suite of nitrogen (N) cycling processes in ecosystems, but there is limited information on its distribution within soils and relationship to plant and bedrock pools. We examined soil, bedrock, and plant Mo variation across 24 forests spanning wide soil pH gradients on both basaltic and sedimentary lithologies in the Oregon Coast Range. We found that the oxidizable organic fraction of surface mineral soil accounted for an average of 33 % of bulk soil Mo across all sites, followed by 1. 4 % associated with reducible Fe, Al, and Mn-oxides, and 1. 4 % in <b>exchangeable</b> <b>ion</b> form. Exchangeable Mo was greatest at low pH, and its positive correlation with soil carbon (C) suggests organic matter as the source of readily exchangeable Mo. Molybdenum accumulation integrated over soil profiles to 1 m depth (τMo[subscript]Nb) increased with soil C, indicating that soil organic matter regulates long-term Mo retention and loss from soil. Foliar Mo concentrations displayed no relationship with bulk soil Mo, and were not correlated with organic horizon Mo or soil extractable Mo, suggesting active plant regulation of Mo uptake and/or poor fidelity of extractable pools to bioavailability. We estimate from precipitation sampling that atmospheric deposition supplies, on average, over 10 times more Mo annually than does litterfall to soil. In contrast, bedrock lithology had negligible effects on foliar and soil Mo concentrations and on Mo distribution among soil fractions.

40|$|The {{surface and}} porous {{properties}} of New Zealand metahalloysites, {{and the manner}} in which these properties are affected by chemical and physical treatments, have been studied by adsorption methods. The clay mineral surface has a considerable influence on the nature of the adsorption, process, polar water and ethyl chloride molecules giving rise to low pressure hysteresis not observed for the adsorption of nitrogen and argon. Low pressure hysteresis is attributed to structuring effects in the interfacial layer, desorption occurring from a layer more densely packed than during adsorption. Treatment of the mineral with solutions of metal chlorides altered the specific surface area to a small degree while treatment with trimethylchlorosilane was found to have a considerable effect on the surface properties. Particle morphology is found to have a significant influence on the effects which take place upon heating metahalloysite, larger changes in specific surface area occuring for material having an elongated particle shape. Vacuum outgassing at raised temperatures causes small changes only in the specific surface area and pore size distribution of a metahalloysite prepared by dehydrating an halloysite from TePuke. Dehydroxylation gave rise mainly to small pores of diameter 30 - 100 Å. The surface area changes, which occur as the outgassing temperature is increased, are explained by a combination of three effects, loss of strongly adsorbed water, particle coalescence and dehydroxylation. Gravimetric water vapour sorption measurements were made on homoionic metahalloysite saturated with the exchange cations Li+, Na+, K+, Rb +, Cs +, Mg 2 +, Ca 2 + and Sr 2 +. The size and range of the hysteresis loop is found to vary with the nature of the <b>exchangeable</b> <b>ion.</b> The relative effect of the various cations depends upon their respective polarizabilities. Li+ and Mg 2 + ions are anomalous in their behaviour, an effect attributed to their small size and consequent high energy of interaction with the mineral surface. This high interaction energy retards the ion hydration below that expected for the high polarizability of these ions. A molecular adsorption model is advanced which assumes specific site adsorption, the sites being intimately connected with the exchange cations. The completion of the various stages postulated in the model correspond closely to the points, on Jura- Harkins’ plots of the experimental data, at which distinct slope changes occur, and which indicate ‘phase’ changes in the adsorbed film. Small highly charged ions stabilise a molecular arrangement believed to be similar to the Hendricks-Jefferson ‘nett’ structure. The larger ions disrupt this structure and for these ions a ‘phaset’ change is observed which corresponds with the formation of a closest-packed adsorbed layer. The proposed adsorption model is essentially the same as that successfully used for the kaolinite-water system. That similar models can be employed to predict the nature of the adsorption of water vapour on both kaolinite and metahalloysite is an indication of the resemblance between the two mineral surfaces...|$|E

The fact that the layers do not spontaneously dissociate in solution despite the high charge density of the surfaces points to a considerable specific adsorption potential of the counter <b>ions</b> (the <b>exchangeable</b> <b>ions)</b> to tile surface (~ 0. 2 ev). The consequences for ion exchange are briefly discussed. Next, two possibilities for the status and position of the counter ions are con...|$|R

Bacteriol. 91 : 1582 – 1588. 1966. —Native spores of Bacillus megaterium Texas, and H-spores produced by titration of native spores to pH 4 with mineral acid, did not germinate {{in a solution}} of alanine and inosine unless a strong electrolyte was present. Ca-spores prepared from either H-spores or native spores did germinate efficiently in the same solution without a strong electrolyte. Of several other bivalent cations tested, only strontium and barium could substitute for calcium in conditioning spores for subsequent germination {{in the absence of}} an electrolyte. Variable responses were obtained with different metal ion forms of 62 unidentified soil isolates and several stock species of Bacillus. Although the pattern of response was not uniform in all organisms, ions played a crucial role in the germinability of the great majority of strains tested...|$|R

One way to counter this soil fertility problem is ISFM, i.e., Integrated Soil Fertility Management, a technique that makes use of both organic and inorganic resources resulting in greater yield response and better nutrient storage (Bedada et al. 2014; Ewusi-Mensah et al. 2015). For example, combination of cow dung with NPK (15 : 15 : 15) in the concentration of 3  t/ha and 100  kg/ha, respectively, showed marked increase of 8.9  t/ha in the yield of potato tuber in comparison to control that yielded only 1.8  t/ha. The organic carbon of the soil after treatment with this combination was found to be significantly increased from 1.33 to 3.21  %. The combination also improved soil organic matter, phosphate availability, <b>exchangeable</b> <b>ions,</b> effective cation exchange capacity and pH in comparison to untreated soil (Onwudike 2010). The same combination has also been reported to increase the yield of maize (Ayoola and Makinde 2008; Bedada et al. 2014).|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] The {{adsorption}} of the sulfonylurea herbicide rimsulfuron, [N-((4, 6 -dimethoxypyrimidin- 2 -yl) aminocarbonyl) - 3 -(ethylsulfonyl) - 2 -pyridinesulfonamide], on {{clay minerals}} with different saturating cations was studied. Three smectites with different lattice charge distribution (hectorite, montmorillonite and nontronite) were selected and made homoionic to Ca 2 +, Cu 2 + and AP +. Because of {{the instability of}} rimsulfuron in water, the experiments were carried out in chloroform solution. The interaction mechanism depends {{on the nature of}} the saturating cation and the tetrahedral layer charge of the silicate. Among the <b>exchangeable</b> <b>ions</b> studied, only AP + is able to produce degradation of the herbicide to N-(4, 6 -dimethox-ypyrimidin- 2 -yl) -N-[(3 -(ethylsulfonyl) - 2 -pyridinyl]urea. In this case, the lower the tetrahedral charge, the more active the degradation. The Ca 2 +-saturated clays are ineffective in the degradation. In contrast, the formation of a stable chelate complex with the saturating ion permits rimsulfuron to be adsorbed to a rather high extent into Cu(II) -clays and to be stable against degradation...|$|R
40|$|Bauxite residue, {{a highly}} {{alkaline}} solid waste, is extremely hazardous {{to the surrounding}} environment and current research approaches have largely focused on the removal and separation of alkaline substances. Natural weathering processes may be a step forward {{in terms of their}} regeneration. In this study, natural evolution of basic alkalinity, electrical conductivity, <b>exchangeable</b> <b>ions</b> and acid neutralizing capacity of residue in the disposal areas was discussed. Minerals, exchangeable cations and alkaline anions were analyzed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) and titration, respectively. Acid neutralizing capacity was carried out by batch neutralization experiments. Basic alkalinity, electrical conductivity, cation exchange capacity and exchangeable sodium percentage decreased with increasing disposal duration. Sodium was the predominant exchangeable cation in fresh residue but its concentration significantly decreased with increasing time from initial disposal. The acid neutralizing capacity of bauxite residue was investigated by incubation with hydrochloric acid. Acid neutralizing capacity curves changed with disposal duration and each revealed a characteristic buffering behavior that could be controlled by its alkaline components...|$|R
