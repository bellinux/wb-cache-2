5|$|The Heskeths' first child, Anna Maria (known as Maria to {{distinguish}} her from three close relatives named Anna), {{was born in}} 1827. Three more children—named Metcalfe Bold, Debonnaire and Frances—all died in infancy. In 1831 Hesketh changed his name by royal licence to Hesketh-Fleetwood, incorporating the better-known family name of his ancestors into his own. Debonnaire contracted tuberculosis and died in early 1833. Shortly before Debonnaire's death Hesketh-Fleetwood contracted scarlet fever. This was followed by erysipelas, a bacterial infection so severe that it necessitated the removal of one of <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> <b>At</b> {{the end of the}} year, the Rossall estate was severely flooded and suffered damage costing about £3,000 to repair. Hesketh-Fleetwood subsequently spent very little time at Rossall.|$|E
5|$|The {{first hint}} of his death to the Soviet people came at 7:15 p.m. Moscow Time, when the usual {{television}} programs were altered and a pop music concert {{was replaced by a}} documentary on Vladimir Lenin. On Vremya, the Soviet Union's state television newscast, the hosts wore somber clothes instead of their normally informal dress code. At first, Soviet citizens believed it was Andrei Kirilenko who had died, as he had not been present at the 65th anniversary of the October Revolution a few days earlier (he died in 1990). Furthermore, other abrupt changes to the television line-up occurred, such as the appearance of an unscheduled program of war reminiscences and the replacement of an ice hockey game on Channel Two with Tchaikovsky's Pathétique symphony. Brezhnev's death was announced on 11 November simultaneously by Soviet radio and television hosts. The television announcement was read by Igor Kirillov with tears in <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>at</b> 11 a.m. Moscow Time.|$|E

He {{was considered to be}} one of The Gromble's worst students and now works as a mold farmer because he lost his stench as a kid.|$|E

500|$|Much {{has been}} made of the {{fragmented}} editing of Don't Look Now, and Nicolas Roeg's work in general. Time is presented as 'fluid', where the past, present and future can all exist in the same timeframe. [...] John's premonitions merge with the present, such as {{at the start of the}} film where the mysterious red-coated figure is seemingly depicted in one of his photographic slides, and when he 'sees' Laura on the funeral barge with the sisters and mistakenly believes he is seeing the present, but in fact it is a vision of the future. [...] The most famous use of this fragmented approach to time is during the love scene, in which the scenes of John and Laura having sex are intercut with scenes of them dressing afterwards to go out to dinner. After John is attacked by his assailant in the climactic moments, the preceding events depicted during the course of the film are recalled through flashback, which may be perceived as his life flashing before <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> <b>At</b> a narrative level the plot of Don't Look Now can be regarded as a self-fulfilling prophecy: it is John's premonitions of his death that set in motion the events leading up to his death. According to the editor of the film, Graeme Clifford, Nicolas Roeg regarded the film as his [...] "exercise in film grammar".|$|E
500|$|In contrast, Australia batted with {{apparent}} ease, as the overcast skies {{cleared and}} sun came out. The debutant Watkins sent down four overs for 19 runs with his bruised shoulder {{and did not}} bowl again. He was in much pain and his limp bowling did little to trouble the Australian openers. Morris and Barnes batted comfortably and passed England's first innings total by themselves, taking {{less than an hour}} to push the Australians into the lead. O'Reilly felt the Australian openers wanted to prove [...] "the pitch itself had nothing whatever to do with the English batting debacle". Australia reached 100 at 17:30 with Barnes on 52 and Morris on 47. The only chance came when Barnes powerfully square cut Bedser low to point, where Young spilled the catch. When Young came on to bowl, his finger spin was expected to trouble the batsmen on a rain-affected surface, but he delivered little variation in pace and trajectory and Barnes in particular hit him repeatedly through the off side field. The score had reached 117 after only 126 minutes, when Barnes was caught behind from Hollies for 61. The right-handed Australian opener stumbled forward to a fast-turning leg break that caught his outside edge. He had overbalanced and would have been stumped if he had failed to make contact with the leather. This brought Bradman to the crease shortly before 18:00, late on the first day. As Bradman had already announced the tour would be his last at international level, the innings would be his last at Test level if Australia batted only once. The crowd gave him a standing ovation as he walked out to bat; Yardley led the Englishmen and the crowd in giving his Australian counterpart three cheers, before shaking Bradman's hand. With 6,996 Test career runs, Bradman needed only four runs to average exactly 100 in Test cricket. Bradman took guard and played the first ball from Hollies, a leg break, from the back foot. The leg spinner pitched the next ball up, bowling Bradman for a duck with a googly that went between bat and pad as the Australian skipper leaned forward. Bradman appeared stunned by what had happened and slowly turned around and walked back to the pavilion, receiving another large round of applause. It was claimed by many, including Hollies, that Bradman became emotional and had tears in <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>at</b> the ovation given to him by the crowd and the English players, and that this hampered his ability to see and hit the ball. Bradman admitted to being moved by the applause, but always denied shedding tears, saying [...] "to suggest I got out, as some people did, because I had tears in my eyes while I was looking at the bowler was quite untrue. Eric Hollies deceived me and he deserves full credit." ...|$|E
2500|$|On Tuesday, April 17, 2007, the {{day after}} the Virginia Tech massacre, in which a student named Seung-Hui Cho used guns to kill 32 {{students}} and professors before committing suicide, while contestant Chris Richardson and Ryan Seacrest were discussing the shooting after Chris's critique, Simon Cowell apparently appeared to be rolling <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>at</b> the incident, when he was actually speaking to Paula Abdul and did not hear what Chris had said. On the results show the next day, Cowell stated: [...] "I may not be the nicest person in the world, but I would never, ever, ever, disrespect those families or those victims, and I felt it was important to set the record straight." [...] To clear Cowell's name, a video was shown on the result show which showed Cowell and Abdul talking with an inset of Chris and Seacrest discussing the shooting. Also, Seacrest began the performance show by acknowledging what had happened the day before.|$|E

2500|$|Davey {{arrived at}} Talladega the {{following}} week wearing dark shades to hide eyes severely bruised in the Pocono crash, Allison famously told a reporter asking to see <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>at</b> the press conference, [...] "You can see it, but its ugly". His arm was in a cast {{that allowed him to}} drive, and velcro attachments to his glove and the car's shifter knob helped him drive with less exertion, but Bobby Hillin, Jr. would relieve Davey after the initial laps of the DieHard 500. [...] Under NASCAR rules, the driver who takes the green flag is the one assigned to the points for all drivers that drive that car during the race. [...] Hillin drove the No. 28 Texaco-Havoline Ford Thunderbird to a third-place finish at Talladega, helping Davey and the team keep pace with Elliott. [...] The team was a strong contender for the win until suffering a jack failure on a pit stop. The following week, veteran road racer Dorsey Schroeder would relieve Allison, but he could only manage a 20th-place finish.|$|E
2500|$|In his statements, Goetz {{described}} his past mugging, {{in which he}} was injured and the only assailant arrested went unpunished. He called New York City [...] "lawless" [...] and expressed contempt for its justice system, calling it a [...] "joke," [...] a [...] "sham," [...] and [...] "a disgrace". Goetz said that when the four men he shot surrounded him on the train, he feared being [...] "beaten to a pulp" [...] as well as being robbed. He denied any premeditation for the shooting, something that had been speculated on by the press. Asked what his intentions were when he drew his revolver, Goetz replied, [...] "My intention was to murder them, to hurt them, to make them suffer as much as possible." [...] Later in the tape, Goetz said, [...] "If I had more bullets, I would have shot 'em all again and again. My problem was I ran out of bullets." [...] He added, [...] "I was gonna, I was gonna gouge one of the guys' [...] eyes out with my keys afterwards", but said he stopped when he saw the fear in <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> <b>At</b> the criminal trial, Goetz's defense attorneys, Barry Slotnick and Mark M. Baker, argued that this and other extreme statements by Goetz were the product of emotion and an overactive imagination.|$|E
2500|$|Once Io {{was given}} to Hera, she tied her to a tree and sent her servant Argus to keep Io {{separated}} from Zeus. [...] Argus was a loyal servant to Hera and he has immense strength and one hundred eyes all over his body. It {{was not possible to}} go past Argus since he never closed more than half <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>at</b> any time. Zeus was afraid of Hera's wrath could not personally intervene, so to save Io, he commanded Hermes to kill Argus, which he does by lulling all one hundred eyes into eternal sleep. In Ovid's interpolation, when Hera learned of Argus' death, she took his eyes and placed them in the plumage of the peacock, her favorite animal, accounting for the eye pattern in its tail and making it the vainest of all animals. Hera, furious about Io being free and the death of Argus, sent a gadfly (Greek oistros, compare oestrus) to sting Io as she wandered the earth. [...] Eventually Io made it to Egypt, the Egyptians worshiped the snow-white heifer and named her the Egyptian goddess Isis. [...] Hera permitted Zeus to change Io back into her human form, under the condition that he never look at her again. [...] Io, the goddess-queen of Egypt, then bore Zeus' son as the next King.|$|E
