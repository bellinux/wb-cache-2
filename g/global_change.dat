5|$|In October 2004, Tony Blair {{announced}} he would not lead the party into a fourth general election, but would serve a full third term. Political comment over the relationship between Brown and Blair continued up to and beyond the 2005 election, which Labour won with a reduced majority and reduced vote share. Blair announced on 7 September 2006 that he would step down within a year. Brown was the clear favourite to succeed Blair; {{he was the only}} candidate spoken of seriously in Westminster. Appearances and news coverage leading up to the handover were interpreted as preparing the ground for Brown to become Prime Minister, in part by creating the impression of a statesman with a vision for leadership and <b>global</b> <b>change.</b> This enabled Brown to signal the most significant priorities for his agenda as Prime Minister; speaking at a Fabian Society conference on 'The Next Decade' in January 2007, he stressed education, international development, narrowing inequalities (to pursue 'equality of opportunity and fairness of outcome'), renewing Britishness, restoring trust in politics, and winning hearts and minds {{in the war on terror}} as key priorities.|$|E

40|$|The <b>global</b> <b>changes</b> {{are marked}} by {{alteration}} on the normal patterns of important biochemical and biophysical processes of the Earth. However, the real effects {{as well as the}} feedbacks of the <b>global</b> <b>changes</b> over vegetation are still unclear. Part of this uncertainty {{can be attributed to the}} inattention of stakeholders and scientists towards vegetation and its complex interrelations with the environment, which drive plant physiological processes in different space-time scales. Notwithstanding, some key subjects of the <b>global</b> <b>changes</b> could be better elucidated with a more plant physiological ecology approach. We discuss some issues related to this topic, going through some limitations of approaching vegetation as a static component of the biosphere as the other sub-systems of the Earth-system change. With this perspective, this review is an initial reflection towards the assessment of the role and place of vegetation structure and function in the <b>global</b> <b>changes</b> context. We reviewed the Earth-system and <b>global</b> <b>changes</b> terminology; attempted to illustrate key plant physiological ecology researches themes in the <b>global</b> <b>changes</b> context; consider approaching plants as complex systems in order to adequately quantify systems characteristics as sensibility, homeostasis, and vulnerability. Moreover, we propose insights that would allow vegetation studies and scaling procedures in the context of the Earth-system. We hope this review will assist researchers on their strategy to identify, understand and anticipate the potential effects of <b>global</b> <b>changes</b> over the most vulnerable vegetation processes from the leaf to the global levels...|$|R

I examined the impact of three of these <b>global</b> <b>changes,</b> including elevated carbon dioxide, increased soil nitrogen availability and large-scale deforestation, on the biodiversity of soil fungi in three separate ecosystems. The responses of fungi to <b>global</b> <b>changes</b> were variable across ecosystems and the experimental system and were not readily predicted by observed changes in the plant community. However, subtle shifts in the community composition of fungi were observed in response to all <b>global</b> <b>changes.</b> Whether these shifts will impact the ecosystem function of these systems in unclear, but previous studies suggest that even small changes in community dynamics can have large effects on important processes, such as nitrogen cycling and carbon storage.

40|$|<b>Global</b> <b>changes</b> have to {{be taken}} into account to reach the {{objective}} of good water status, laid down by the European Water Framework Directive (2000 / 60 /CE). The 2016 - 2021 master plan for water development and management of the Rhone-Mediterranean basin (SDAGE Rhône-Méditerranée) set the climate change adaptation as a new basic orientation of the water policy. For the local managers of water resources, this policy is difficult to implement because of a deficit of knowledge and methods. The Crau aquifer (550 km 2) supplies water for 300, 000 inhabitants, for major economic sectors and for agriculture. 70 % of the aquifer recharge depend on irrigated grasslands (14, 000 ha) with water derived from the Durance River. Located in coastal area, the south part of aquifer is sensitive to saltwater intrusions, which are mainly controlled by recharge conditions. But at medium term these recharge conditions could be affected by <b>global</b> <b>changes,</b> e. g. the decrease of water availability from the Durance River and the decrease of irrigated grassland surfaces due to urban sprawl. The local public manager of the Crau aquifer (SYMCRAU) has defined with the stakeholders an action plan ("contrat de nappe de la Crau") to anticipate <b>global</b> <b>changes</b> and propose adaptation solutions. Collaborations with research institutes have been developed to study <b>global</b> <b>changes</b> processes and better forecast their local impacts. A numerical model of surface drainages and groundwater flows allows quantifying the sensitivity of the resource to <b>global</b> <b>changes.</b> Special protection areas were identified to protect future of drinking water supply. Additional studies are scheduled to assess the impact of recharge decrease on saltwater intrusions and on wetland ecosystems.

25|$|Since {{the onset}} of the Green Revolution {{in the middle of the}} last century, vast amounts of {{nitrogen}} fertilizers have been produced and introduced to almost all agricultural systems. This has led to increases in plant available nitrogen in ecosystems around the world due to agricultural runoff and wind-driven fertilization. As discussed earlier, nitrogen can have a significant positive effect on the level and rate of soil respiration. Increases in soil nitrogen have been found to increase plant dark respiration, stimulate specific rates of root respiration and increase total root biomass. and nitrogen supply over four years of growth. <b>Global</b> <b>Change</b> Biology. 6, 13-24. This is because high nitrogen rates are associated with high plant growth rates. High plant growth rates will lead to the increased respiration and biomass found in the study.
