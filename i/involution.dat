Brendle and Farb [BF] gave an answer in the case of g≥ 3, b= 0 and g≥ 4, b= 1, by describing a generating set consisting of 6 <b>involutions.</b> Kassabov showed that for every b Mod(Σ_g,b) can be generated by 4 <b>involutions</b> if g≥ 8, 5 <b>involutions</b> if g≥ 6 and 6 <b>involutions</b> if g≥ 4.
