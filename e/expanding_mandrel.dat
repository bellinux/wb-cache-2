25|$|There {{are many}} types of collet used in the {{metalworking}} industry. Common industry-standard designs are R8 (internally threaded for mills) and 5C (usually externally threaded for lathes). There are also proprietary designs which only fit one manufacturer's equipment. Collets can range in holding capacity from zero to several inches in diameter. The {{most common type of}} collet grips a round bar or tool, but there are collets for square, hexagonal, and other shapes. In addition to the outside-holding collets, there are collets used for holding a part on its inside surface {{so that it can be}} machined on the outside surface (similar to an <b>expanding</b> <b>mandrel).</b> Furthermore, it is not uncommon for machinists to make a custom collet to hold any unusual size or shape of part. These are often called emergency collets (e-collets) or soft collets (from the fact that they are bought in a soft (unhardened) state and machined as needed). Yet another type of collet is a step collet which steps up to a larger diameter from the spindle and allows holding of larger workpieces.|$|E
50|$|Built by William Church, who {{is mainly}} remembered for his {{typesetting}} machine, although he also experimented with locomotives, {{it was an}} 0-2-2 well tank locomotive with horizontal outside cylinders at the rear. Dr Church had invented an <b>expanding</b> <b>mandrel</b> for fixing boiler tubes, {{and it was the}} first tank engine to have a multitube boiler. It used piston valves and eccentric motion.|$|E
50|$|In 1839 (age 23) {{while working}} for B. Hick and Son, John Hick Jr as he was {{referred}} to at the time, was awarded the Silver Medal by the Society of Arts for his novel invention of an <b>expanding</b> <b>mandrel</b> for turning lathes, it was an adaptation of a principle developed by Marc Brunel for pully block manufacture at Portsmouth and received the praise of three eminent engineers; Bryan Donkin, Joshua Field and John Rennie.|$|E
50|$|Another type of mandrel is {{the chuck}} that a lathe uses to hold pieces of wood, metal or plastic to be {{machined}} as they are turned. In this way, rods can be threaded, furniture legs are turned to have æsthetic patterns, and irregularly-shaped objects can be given a round shape. There are several types of mandrels used with lathes. Original <b>expanding</b> <b>mandrels</b> have a slightly tapered wedge that will expand to hold the item.|$|R

5000|$|The Xpandrel {{method of}} <b>expanding</b> <b>mandrels</b> was {{introduced}} in the mid-1990s. This method uses basic mechanical principles of deformation to achieve expansion of a non-tapered mandrel. Using various methods of actuation, the body of the mandrel is deformed below the limit of elasticity to provide repeatable holding forces without typical deformation caused by pressing on tapered mandrels. Other commercial mandrels are very slightly tapered, and the hollow object slides down the taper until it [...] "sticks". The shop-made mandrel shown in the photo is designed to clamp a hollow tube or gear between the two tapered plugs. There is little about such a mandrel that can't be made right on the lathe on which it is to be used, so {{it is not uncommon for}} machinists to make a mandrel to hold a particular item and then set the mandrel aside hoping to use it again some day. Mandrels of this type are usually set in the lathe on centers and turned with a lathe dog.|$|R

40|$|The {{segmented}} <b>expanding</b> <b>mandrel</b> test is modified {{and improved}} to yield more quantitative {{information on the}} local stress and strain concentrations in Zircaloy tubing samples. The experimental apparatus has undergone changes in segment design, end restraint fixture design and the method of sample heating.

A chamfered specimen design has been introduced for the purpose of producing a near plane-strain condition.

50|$|Shape-memory {{coupling}} is {{a system}} for connecting pipes using shape-memory alloys. In its typical form the technique uses an internally ribbed sleeve of alloy such as Tinel that is slightly smaller in diameter than the pipes it is to connect. The sleeve is cooled in liquid nitrogen then, in this low-temperature state, mechanically <b>expanded</b> with a <b>mandrel</b> to fit easily over the two pipe ends to be joined. After fitting, it is allowed to rewarm, when the memory effect causes the sleeve to shrink back to its original smaller size, creating a tight joint.|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} briefly {{the test}} methods used, within {{the in the}} EERA JPNM Pilot Project TASTE, for defining the tensile and creep material properties relevant {{to the integrity of}} nuclear fuel claddings. These properties are challenging to extract from thin walled tubes since the standard test methods use test specimen that require minimum material thicknesses in the order of 10 mm or more. In consequence the thin walled material properties are acquired through a number of testing techniques and evaluation methodologies suitable for the thin walled product form. In this report the different test methods and their data assessment requirements are briefly described. The test methods evaluated here comprises of sub-size (curved specimen) tensile testing (ST) of the cladding tube, micro specimen (dog-bone) tensile testing (MT), Small Punch testing (SP), Segmented <b>Expanding</b> Cone <b>Mandrel</b> tests (SCM), the ring tension (RT) and ring compression (RC) tests and internal pressure testing (IP).

It is shown that the test can be used to derive stress-strain curves at moderate plastic deformation provided the friction coefficients are low and known. The pellet–cladding can be simulated by selecting representative friction coefficients and segments to represent cracked fuel. The test used limited amount of material and it is simple to perform. In particular the test can be used quantify how defects assess the ductility of thin-walled cladding tubes. JRC. F. 4 -Safety of future nuclear reactor...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} a fixture device is very laborious, {{requiring}} consideration of many issues from series production, information on the raw part material, required precision surfaces, ensuring an appropriate orientation scheme, continue with requirements related device itself as number of parts, parts type, complexity, manageability, easy operation and maintenance. That is why realising a proper analyse regarding the possible failures associated to these issues is overwhelming.

40|$|The {{segmented}} <b>expanding</b> <b>mandrel</b> test is {{modified to}} provide additional information on the localized stresses and strains during ramp-hold tests. A chamfered specimen is designed with four flats on the outer diameter {{for the purpose of}} creating sectors of variable wall thickness which establishes a more nearly plane strain state in the thinnest-gauge sections. Ramp-hold tests conducted in 40 MPa of iodine at 32 S’C show that at a measured diametral strain of 0. 88, chamfered specimens fail while regular tubing specimens require diametral strains of 2 % or greater for failure. Calculations made with a two-dimensional, finite elements code show that at a measured diametral strain of 0. 84, the local strains in the clad ID over the segment interfaces are nearly identical for the regular and chamfered samples while the local stress in the chamfered sample is 1. 5 % greater. Results suggest that the smaller diametral failure strain of the chamfered specimen at low measured diametral strains is mainly due to its near plane strain condition and the higher hoop stresses resulting therefrom. 1...|$|E
40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis concerns the mechanical properties and structure of extruded short glass Fibre-Filled polyethylene. High density polyethylene was compounded with E-glass and coupling agent, and extruded into 110 m diameter pipe, using a normal production extruder, by Stewarts & Lloyds Plastics, Huntington. A normal die and a novel die, based on the Monsanto <b>expanding</b> <b>mandrel</b> die, were used to produce pipes with varying fibre orientation distributions (FED). The structure of the pipe was analysed in terms of density, crystallinity, glass weight Fraction, and Fibre length and orientation distributions. Various mechanical properties were measured, to confirm the structure results, namely tensile creep and compression modulus, and tensile strength. 3 -point bending tests of pipe were undertaken. The measured deflections under load were compared with simple bending theory and finite element analysis predictions. Kc, a Jc,-testing of samples was undertaken. JC-testing was not successful, so Kc testing was adopted. The Kc results are analysed in terms of FOD and test seed, and it is shown that alignment {{in the direction of}} load does not allays produce the most resistance to crack growth. Fatigue testing of impact tension and slant-edge cracked specimens was undertaken, with crack growth at several angles to extrusion. Results are very different for samples produced with the different dies, and also depend on fibre length, glass volume fraction, angle to extrusion, and test stress amplitude...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an assessment of}} the segmented <b>expanding</b> <b>mandrel</b> (SEM) test for material characterization and structural integrity assessment of nuclear fuel claddings. The loading is induced by expanding segments, which are placed inside a cladding tube, radially to simulate cracked fuel that expands thermally. Experimental results are presented for zircaloy- 2 cladding tubes for different number of segments. The tests are analysed with semi-analytical models and two-dimensional finite element models. A complex stress field with stress concentrations occurs {{at the edge of the}} segments, which simulates pellet cladding interaction. The variation of the stresses and the strength of the stress and strain concentrations increases with fewer segments and increases strongly with higher friction coefficient between segments and the cladding tube. By increasing the number of segments and ensuring a low friction coefficient, the deformation is close to axi-symmetric and the SEM can be used to determine qualitatively the material properties such as fracture criteria and stress¿strain curves, but the test is more appropriate for assessment of how defects and microstructure affect ductility. For simulation of mechanical pellet-cladding interaction it is important that the friction coefficient is representative. The resulting stress concentrations promote failure at lower loads and need to be taken into account for the integrity assessment. The SEM test can then be used as a relatively simple test for assessment of pellet fuel cladding interaction. JRC. DDG. F. 5 -Safety of present nuclear reactor...|$|E
