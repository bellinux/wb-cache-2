5000|$|In addition, {{as in the}} {{previous}} example, Old Japanese /p/ became modern [...] "h". When a Middle Chinese word ended in /p/, this produced <b>further</b> <b>complications</b> <b>in</b> Japanese. For example, Middle Chinese [...] "ten" [...] (Standard Mandarin [...] "shí", Cantonese [...] ) was borrowed as Old Japanese /zipu/. In time this went through a series of changes: /zipu/ > /zihu/ > /ziu/ > [...] > [...] "jū".

50|$|Public {{floating}} {{also increases}} pressure on {{a company to}} perform. Whenever the general public, as company shareholders, demand dividends without keeping the company's economic circumstances in proper perspective, it increases performance pressure on the company. Secondly, sometimes companies provide false financial reports to sell shares which lead towards <b>further</b> <b>complications</b> <b>in</b> market. In 2005, AIG had to pay a fine of $1.7 billion {{as a result of}} improper accounting. Additionally, Lehman Brothers went bankrupt in 2008 after using a small firm to secretly manipulate its balance sheets. Both cases illustrate that, as a result of pressure to sell shares, companies may manipulate their financial statements, and later on face the consequences (Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy in 2008, AIG's bail out by the U.S government in 2008).|$|E
50|$|A <b>further</b> <b>complication</b> <b>in</b> {{the case}} of neutron {{scattering}} from hydrogenous materials is the strong incoherent scattering of hydrogen (80.27(6) barn). This leads to a very high background in neutron diffraction experiments, and may make structural investigations impossible. A common solution is deuteration, i.e., replacing the 1-H atoms in the sample with deuterium (2-H). The incoherent scattering length of deuterium is much smaller (2.05(3) barn) making structural investigations significantly easier. However, in some systems, replacing hydrogen with deuterium may alter the structural and dynamic properties of interest.|$|R

The two became a sweet couple but as days test their relationship, they stop themselves in impoverishment so they broke up and remained friends. In the meantime, after several attempts, Kara had finally succeeded to meet her twin sister Sara in one of Edward's concert. Kara pleaded with Sara not to tell their parents yet of her return {{in order to avoid}} <b>further</b> <b>complications</b> <b>in</b> her family.

50|$|All {{relative}} clauses {{are introduced}} by the relative particle wo (‘where’), never by the relative pronouns der, die, das, welcher, welches as in Standard German, e.g. ds Bispil, wo si schrybt vs. Standard German das Beispiel, das sie schreibt (‘the example that she writes’); ds Bispil, wo si dra dänkt vs. Standard German das Beispiel, woran sie denkt (‘the example that she thinks of’).
