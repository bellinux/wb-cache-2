5|$|When {{added to}} glass, thorium dioxide helps {{increase}} its refractive index and decrease dispersion. Such glass finds application in high-quality lenses <b>for</b> <b>cameras</b> and scientific instruments. The radiation from these lenses can darken them {{and turn them}} yellow {{over a period of}} years and degrade film, but the health risks are minimal. Yellowed lenses may be restored to their original colourless state by lengthy exposure to intense ultraviolet radiation. Thorium dioxide has since been replaced by rare-earth oxides in this application, as they provide similar effects and are not radioactive.|$|E

25|$|The use {{of false}} camera {{mountings}} was banned. Teams had previously exploited a loophole in the regulations {{that allowed them}} to add additional pieces of bodywork to the car in the place of camera mountings and take advantage of the aerodynamic benefits. From 2014, this loophole was closed, with the regulations rewritten to only allow camera mountings to be used <b>for</b> <b>cameras.</b> This rule was later updated to force the teams to mount the cameras on an external piece of bodywork after Red Bull fitted its cameras within the nose of the RB10 chassis.|$|E

25|$|Adolf Miethe {{designed}} a high-quality, sequential-exposure color camera, which was manufactured by Bermpohl and became available commercially in 1903. Prokudin-Gorsky published {{an illustration of}} it in Fotograf-Liubitel in 1906. The most common model used a single oblong plate 9cm wide by 24cm high, the same format as Prokudin-Gorsky's surviving negatives, and it photographed the images in unconventional blue-green-red sequence, {{which is also a}} characteristic of Prokudin-Gorsky's negatives if the usual upside-down image in a camera and gravity-compliant downward shiftings of his plates are assumed. An inventor as well as a photographer, Prokudin-Gorsky patented an optical system <b>for</b> <b>cameras</b> of the simultaneous-exposure type, and it is often claimed or implied that he invented, or at least built, the camera used for his Russian Empire project. No definite written or photographic documentation of his field equipment is known to exist, only the evidence inherent in the photographs themselves, and no rationale has been suggested for going to the trouble and expense of building a functionally identical copy of a Miethe-Bermpohl camera instead of simply buying one.|$|E

500|$|Machinima {{can be less}} {{expensive}} than other forms of filmmaking. Strange Company produced its feature-length machinima film BloodSpell for less than £10,000. Before using machinima, Burnie Burns and Matt Hullum of Rooster Teeth Productions spent US$9,000 to produce a live-action independent film; in contrast, the four Xbox game consoles used to make Red vs. Blue in 2005 cost $600. The low cost caused a product manager for Electronic Arts to compare machinima to the low-budget independent film The Blair Witch Project, without the need <b>for</b> <b>cameras</b> and actors. Because these are seen as low barriers to entry, machinima {{has been called a}} [...] "democratization of filmmaking". Berkeley weighs increased participation and a blurred line between producer and consumer against concerns that game copyrights limit commercialization and growth of machinima.|$|E

500|$|To {{achieve the}} effect in which water {{appears to be}} flowing from subjects' mouths, each video has a segment where the subject's lips are puckered, which is then timed to {{correspond}} to the spouting water, reminiscent of gargoyle fountains. Each face is cropped so that no hair and usually no ears are visible. Since there is no tripod designed <b>for</b> <b>cameras</b> turned on their sides, an adjustable barber/dentist's chair was used to minimize {{the need for the}} movement of the state-of-the-art camera during filming. Nonetheless, in some case, digital manipulation was necessary to properly simulate puckering in the exact proper location on the video. [...] Many of the faces had to be stretched {{in order to get the}} mouths properly positioned. [...] Additionally, each video was color-corrected for brightness, contrast and color saturation. [...] Both the playback equipment and the final videos had to be further adjusted to account for sunlight during viewing.|$|E
500|$|Observers {{commented that}} California Chrome {{appears to be}} a very {{intelligent}} horse, as he expresses curiosity about everything around him. His idiosyncrasies, included a fondness for one specific brand of horse cookies. [...] His tendency to perform a flehmen response for no obvious reason, particularly when being bathed, prompted the press to claim that he is [...] "smiling". He will deliberately stop and put his ears forward to [...] "pose" [...] <b>for</b> <b>cameras</b> when he hears them clicking. As Alan Sherman explained, [...] "He's a ham"; and exercise rider Willie Delgado gave him an additional nickname, [...] "Vogue". As a younger horse, notably in 2014, he would not walk forward out of horse vans designed for a forward exit; he would only back out, a quirk discovered by the press when he was first unloaded off of an airplane. At the Sherman stables, he had a green tetherball in his stall to play with, but his worst bad habit is that he sometimes bites.|$|E
500|$|Robert Gottschalk founded Panavision in late 1953, in {{partnership}} with Richard Moore, Meredith Nicholson, Harry Eller, Walter Wallin, and William Mann; the company was formally incorporated in 1954. Panavision was established principally for the manufacture of anamorphic projection lenses to meet the growing demands of theaters showing CinemaScope films. At the time of Panavision's formation, Gottschalk owned a camera shop in Westwood Village, California, where many of his customers were cinematographers. [...] A few years earlier, he and Moore—who worked {{with him in the}} camera shop—were experimenting with underwater photography; Gottschalk became interested in the technology of anamorphic lenses, which allowed him to get a wider field of view from his underwater camera housing. The technology was created during World War I to increase the field of view on tank periscopes; the periscope image was horizontally [...] "squeezed" [...] by the anamorphic lens. After it was unsqueezed by a complementary anamorphic optical element, the tank operator could see double the horizontal field of view without significant distortion. Gottschalk and Moore bought some of these lenses from C. P. Goerz, a New York optics company, for use in their underwater photography. As widescreen filmmaking became popular, Gottschalk saw an opportunity to provide anamorphic lenses to the film industry—first for projectors, and then <b>for</b> <b>cameras.</b> Nicholson, a friend of Moore, started working as a cameraman on early tests of anamorphic photography.|$|E

2500|$|Margaret's {{interest}} in photography {{began as a}} young woman's hobby, supported by her father's enthusiasm <b>for</b> <b>cameras.</b> Despite her interest, in 1922, she began studying herpetology at Columbia University, only to have her {{interest in}} photography strengthened after studying under Clarence White (no relation). She left after one semester, {{following the death of}} her father. She transferred colleges several times, attending [...] the University of Michigan (where she became a member of Alpha Omicron Pi sorority), Purdue University in Indiana, and Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. Bourke-White ultimately graduated from Cornell University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1927, leaving behind a photographic study of the rural campus for the school's newspaper, including photographs of her famed dormitory, Risley Hall. A year later, she moved from Ithaca, New York, to Cleveland, Ohio, where she started a commercial photography studio and began concentrating on architectural and industrial photography.|$|E
