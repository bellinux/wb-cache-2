40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the long-term effects}} of <b>joint</b> <b>protection</b> on health status of people with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Design: A four-year follow-up of a randomized, controlled, assessor-blinded trial was conducted. Setting: Two rheumatology outpatient departments. Participants: People with rheumatoid arthritis less than five years since diagnosis. Interventions: Two 8 -hour interventions were originally compared: a standard arthritis education programme, including 2 ½ hours of <b>joint</b> <b>protection</b> based on typical UK occupational therapy practice (plus 5 ½ hours on RA, exercise, pain management, diet and foot care); and a <b>joint</b> <b>protection</b> programme, using educational–behavioural training. Main measures: Adherence to <b>joint</b> <b>protection,</b> pain, hand pain on activity, Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales 2 and Arthritis Self-efficacy were recorded at 0 and 4 years. Results: Sixty-five people attended the <b>joint</b> <b>protection</b> and 62 the standard programmes. Groups at entry were similar in age (51 years; 49 years), disease duration (21 months: 17. 5 months) and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory and disease-modifying drugs. At four years, the <b>joint</b> <b>protection</b> group continued to have significantly better: <b>joint</b> <b>protection</b> adherence (p = 0. 001); early morning stiffness (p = 0. 01); AIMS 2 activities of daily living (ADL) scores (p = 0. 04) compared with the standard group.
