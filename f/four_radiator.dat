40|$|The NavX-NCS Professional GNSS Simulator may {{be fitted}} {{with up to}} 4 {{independent}} RF outputs. Potentially multiple RF outputs {{could be used to}} simulate multiple vehicles (for example, for real time kinematic (RTK) or formation flying scenarios), or multiple antennas on the same vehicle (for example, for attitude determination scenarios), or for separate elements of a Controlled Reception Pattern Antenna (CRPA). In addition to the independent RF outputs the Simulator would also be fitted with a combined RF output for standard single output testing. Tests are performed with the GALANT multi-antenna GNSS receiver developed by DLR. GALANT utilities an array antenna with <b>four</b> <b>radiator</b> elements and applies adaptive array processing after correlation of the signals of each of the four antenna channels. Because the array processing is applied after correlation, the directions of arrival of the GNSS satellite can be estimated and individual antenna beams can be adaptively steered to the satellites in view by adaptive digital beam forming. Additionally, strong interference signals are suppressed by generation of nulls during the beam forming process. By comparison of the estimated satellite directions with the known satellite positions from the decoded almanac the attitude of the array itself can be determined. In order to achieve a high accuracy in the direction of arrival estimations and the attitude determination a continuous calibration of the differential carrier phases between the four receiver hardware channels is performed by utilization of a special PRN code. The achieved accuracy is about 1 °. For real antenna measurements the calibration PRN code is generated internally within the receiver, mixed up to RF and fed into four calibration inputs of the array antenna. However, in the hardware simulations no antenna is used and the simulator signals are directly fed into the receiver RF frontend. Therefore, the calibration code is generated by the NavX-NCS simulator. Exemplary results of different static and dynamic test scenarios will be presente...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} an {{extension}} of previous work to evaluate the applicability of Design of Experiments (DOE) /Response Surface Methodology to on-orbit thermal analysis. The goal was to determine if the methodology could produce a Response Surface Equation (RSE) that predicted the thermal model temperature results within +/- 10 F. An RSE is a polynomial expression that can then be used to predict temperatures for a defined range of factor combinations. Based on suggestions received from the previous work, this study used a model with simpler geometry, considered polynomials up to fifth order, and evaluated orbital temperature variations to establish a minimum and maximum temperature for each component. A simplified Outer Mold Line (OML) thermal model of the Orion spacecraft was used in this study. The factors chosen were the vehicle's Yaw, Pitch, and Roll (defining the on-orbit attitude), the Beta angle (restricted to positive beta angles from 0 to 75), and the environmental constants (varying from cold to hot). All factors were normalized from their native ranges to a non-dimensional range from - 1. 0 to 1. 0. Twenty-three components from the OML were chosen and the minimum and maximum orbital temperatures were calculated for each to produce forty-six responses for the DOE model. A customized DOE case matrix of 145 analysis cases was developed which used analysis points at the factor corners, mid-points, and center. From this data set, RSE s were developed which consisted of cubic, quartic, and fifth order polynomials. The results presented are for the fifth order RSE. The RSE results were then evaluated for agreement with the analytical model predictions to produce a +/- 3 (sigma) error band. Forty of the 46 responses had a +/- 3 (sigma) value of 10 F or less. Encouraged by this initial success, two additional sets of verification cases were selected. One contained 20 cases, the other 50 cases. These cases were evaluated both with the fifth order RSE and with the analytical model. For the maximum temperature predictions, 12 of the 23 components had all predictions within +/- 10 F and 17 were within +/- 20 F. For the minimum temperature predictions, only 4 of the 23 components (the <b>four</b> <b>radiator</b> temperatures), were within the 10 F goal. The maximum temperature RSEs were then run through 59, 049 screening cases. The RSE predictions were then filtered to find 55 cases that produced the hottest temperatures. These 55 cases were then analyzed using the thermal model and the results compared against the RSE predictions. As noted earlier, 12 of the 23 responses were within +/- 10 F at 17 within +/- 20 F. These results demonstrate that if properly formulated, an RSE can provide a reliable, fast temperature prediction. Despite this progress, additional work is needed to determine why the minimum temperatures responses and 6 of the hot temperature responses did not produce reliable RSEs. Recommend focus areas are the model itself (arithmetic vs. diffusion nodes) and seeking consultations with statistical application experts...|$|E

40|$|Water to be {{generated}} by, delivered to, and processed by the International Space Station (ISS) {{is a critical}} Environmental Control and Life Support (ECLS) element, especially for the early ISS missions. A {{significant portion of the}} water required by the ISS shall be provided by the Shuttle Transportation System (STS) Orbiter. The balance of water generated by the Orbiter Fuel Cells (FC), minus that water consumed by the Orbiter Flash Evaporator System (FES) and crew, is available for transfer to the ISS. During later missions, crew respired and perspired water, as well as effluent water from the Orbiter LiOH canisters, will be collected as condensate and available for transfer to the ISS. Orbiter radiator performance provides the most variance in determining the amount of net Orbiter water available for transfer to the ISS. As radiator performance decreases, the dependence upon the FES (and FC water) increases for rejecting Orbiter waste heat. Generally, radiator performance decreases as the ISS assembly size increases (especially as solar arrays are added), and also as beta angle increases. ISS solar array deployment necessitates the use of models with articulating solar arrays (for Earth local-vertical attitudes), as array position dramatically affects Orbiter radiator performance. Recent developments in the relaxation of beta angle limitations have also increased the complexity and difficulty of providing water to the ISS. Other factors that may hinder the ability to transfer water are the number of empty Contingency Water Containers (CWCs) available, duration of open-hatch time, crew activity timeline, and full CWC storage capability.

40|$|The Experimental Probe of Inflationary Cosmology (EPIC) is an {{implementation}} of the NASA Einstein Inflation Probe mission, {{to answer questions about}} the physics of Inflation in the early Universe by measuring the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). The mission relies on a passive cooling system to cool the enclosure of a telescope to 30 K; a cryocooler then cools this enclosure to 18 K and the telescope to 4 K. Subsequently, an adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator further cools a large focal plane to approx. 100 mK. For this mission, the telescope has an aperture of 1. 4 m, and the spacecraft's symmetry axis is oriented approx. 45 degrees relative to the direction of the sun. The spacecraft will be spun at approx. 0. 5 rpm around this axis, which then precesses on the sky at 1 rph.

40|$|A compact {{wideband}} pattern-reconfigurable antenna that {{is based}} on multiple radiators and switchable director/reflector is presented. The antenna consists of two quarter-wavelength radial radiators placed on two sides of a central feeder at the top layer. The bottom layer of the antenna includes a truncated quarter-wavelength ground plane and two quarter-wavelength parallel strips surrounding the <b>radiators.</b> <b>Four</b> p-i-n diodes, which are interlocked in pair, are used to control the radiation direction by selecting the radiator at the top layer and switching the strips at the bottom layer between being a director or reflector.

40|$|This work seeks {{designs of}} novel antennas, {{such as the}} {{rectangular}} waveguide narrow-wall longitudinal-aperture antenna arrays for S band high power applications. This antenna is designed to perform as a uniform array with minimum power reflected into the feed-waveguide. Based on the configuration, the double-narrow-wall-slot-array design is proposed for higher gain and grating lobes suppression. This work also deals with the S band compact narrow-wall slot-array proposed to be rendered as a conformal antenna structure. Moreover, this work proposes a circularly polarized narrow-wall longitudinal-aperture array design to produce both vertically and horizontally polarized radiated power. In the end, this work presents and discusses a couple of mechanisms for beam-steering of S band narrow-wall longitudinal-aperture array designs. The S-band narrow-wall longitudinal-aperture array design consists of four narrow wall longitudinal-slot radiators and one H-plane-bend-radiator. The design {{is a combination of}} computational and microwave network analysis techniques. First, HFSS is used to analyze the S-parameters, phases and radiated power of the narrow-wall longitudinal-slot radiators as well as the H-plane-bend radiator. Second the microwave network is applied to design a uniform linear array by neglecting the external coupling between the elements. Finally, Full-wave analysis is used to validate the array design from microwave network analysis. The double-narrow-wall slot-array design is the best narrow-wall longitudinal-slot array design with a peak gain of approximately 15 dB. It consists of two identical narrow-wall-slot-arrays with a common broad wall. It has a much more uniform aperture electric field distributuion than the single array design. As a result, a higher gain with suppressed grating lobes is achieved. The S-band curved rectangular waveguide narrow-wall longitudinal-aperture antenna is proposed to perform as a conformal antenna structure. It is based on a rectangular waveguide bend {{so that it can be}} mounted easily on vehicles. It also consists of <b>four</b> narrow-wall longitudinal <b>radiators</b> and one H-plane-bend-radiator similar to the narrow-wall longitudinal slot-array. A circularly polarized narrow-wall longitudinal-aperture array design is also discussed. It produces both vertically and horizontally polarized radiated power. The configuration verified by simulation places adjacent narrow-wall longitudinal radiators orthogonally and keeps the centers of all <b>four</b> narrow-wall longitudinal <b>radiators</b> at the same level. A study of beam-steering capability is also conducted. It is divided into two parts. One moves the main beam on the plane orthogonal to the narrow-wall and orthogonal to the broad-wall of the rectangular waveguide. The other moves the main beam on the plane orthogonal to the narrow-wall and parallel to the broad-wall of the rectangular waveguide. The S-band narrow-wall longitudinal-slot array design works well both ways. Finally, the experiment is designed and conducted to validate the theoretical analysis results for the design of S-band narrow-wall longitudinal-slot array. The results obtained lead to the conclusion that there is good agreement between the theoretical and experiment results. U. S.

40|$|In {{traditional}} {{liquid cooled}} {{internal combustion engine}} systems, the coolant temperature is controlled by a thermostat which governs the coolant flow rate to the radiator. The thermostat is effectively a directional control valve in which the spool displacement is used to direct flow to the radiator. The coolant temperature is primarily a function of <b>four</b> parameters, namely <b>radiator</b> and thermostat characteristics, coolant flow rate and ambient temperature. By employing closed-loop feedback, the coolant temperature can be controlled according to environmental conditions. To achieve this goal the overall system must be correctly designed. That is the issue discussed in this paper. The increasing use of simulation for both circuit and component analysis in the automtive industry has come about due to the requirement for acceptable transient as well as steady state system performance. The computer simulation package Bathfp, originally developed at the Fluid Power Centre, University of Bath, U.

40|$|During an Extravehicular Activity (EVA), the {{astronaut}} s metabolic {{heat and the}} heat produced by the Portable Life Support Unit (PLSS) must be rejected. This heat load is currently rejected by a sublimator, which vents up to eight pounds of water each EVA. However, for advanced space missions of the future, water venting to space needs to be minimized because resupply impacts from earth will be prohibitive. If this heat load could be radiated to space from the PLSS, which has enough surface area to radiate most of the heat, {{the amount of water}} now vented could be greatly reduced. Unfortunately, a radiator rejects heat at a relatively constant rate, but {{the astronaut}}s generate a variable heat load depending on how hard they are working. Without a way to vary the heat removal rate, the astronaut would experience cold discomfort or even frostbite. A proven method allowing a radiator to be turned-down is to sequentially allow tubes that carry the heat transfer fluid to the radiator to freeze. A drawback of current freezable radiators using this method is that they are far to heavy for use on a PLSS, because they use heavy construction to prevent the tubes from bursting as they freeze and thaw. This creates the need for a large radiator to reject most of the heat but with a lightweight tube that doesn t burst as it freezes and thaws. The new freezable radiator for the Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) has features to accommodate the expansion of the radiator fluid when it freezes, and still have the high tube to fin conductance needed to minimize the number and weight of the tubes. Radiator fluid candidates are water and a propylene glycol-water mixture. This design maintains all materials within their elastic limits so that large volume changes can be achieved without breaking the tube. This concept couples this elastic expansion with an extremely lightweight, extremely high conductivity carbon fiber fin that can carry the heat needed to thaw a frozen tube. By using most of the exposed surface area of the PLSS as a radiator, the system can reject about 75 % of the highest heat load, and reduce the loss of water through sublimation by a factor of <b>four.</b> The proposed <b>radiator</b> and a small water tank can be no heavier than the current system...|$|R
