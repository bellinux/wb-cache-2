5|$|<b>Jesus</b> <b>Christ</b> <b>is</b> the Head of the Church {{which is}} {{constituted}} by the Holy Spirit {{and consists of}} born again believers.

5|$|<b>Jesus</b> <b>Christ</b> <b>is</b> {{the only}} Son of God the Father. For {{the sake of}} {{humanity}} and its salvation, he became flesh, lived on earth and was crucified, died and was buried; rose from the dead and ascended to heaven, seated at the right hand of the Father.|$|E
50|$|The Reorganized Church of <b>Jesus</b> <b>Christ</b> <b>was</b> a sect {{that was}} created in 1907 from dissenting members of The Church of <b>Jesus</b> <b>Christ</b> (Bickertonite).

5|$|New Age {{literature}} often {{refers to}} benevolent non-human spirit-beings {{who are interested}} in humanity's spiritual development; these are variously referred to as angels, guardian angels, personal guides, masters, teachers, and contacts. New Age angelology is nevertheless unsystematic, reflecting the idiosyncrasies of individual authors. The figure of <b>Jesus</b> <b>Christ</b> <b>is</b> often mentioned within New Age literature as a mediating principle between divinity and humanity, as well as an exemplar of a spiritually advanced human being.|$|E
5|$|The {{description}} {{provided by}} Blake to Humphrey {{explains that the}} work depicts the resurrection. The top of the work depicts Christ on the Throne of Judgement with Heaven opened up across the painting. Behind Christ are the heads of infants which represent creation coming from <b>Jesus.</b> <b>Christ</b> <b>is</b> surrounded by the four Zoas and seven angels that have vials filled with God's wrath. An image of a tabernacle with a cross inside is depicted above Christ. An image of baptism is to Christ's right and the Last Supper is to Christ's left with both representing eternal life. Further to Christ's right is {{the resurrection of the}} just and to the left is the resurrection and subsequent fall of the wicked. Adam and Eve are below Christ, and Abraham and Moses are nearby. Below Moses is Satan wrapped by the Serpent and in the centre is the book of death. At the top is the book of life, and the Christian Church is the figure of a woman on top of the moon.|$|E

25|$|The Catholic {{teaching}} {{on this subject}} is expressed in the papal encyclical Ad Caeli Reginam, issued by Pope Pius XII. It states that Mary is called Queen of Heaven because her son, <b>Jesus</b> <b>Christ,</b> <b>is</b> the king of Israel and heavenly king of the universe; indeed, the Davidic tradition of Israel recognized {{the mother of the}} king as the Queen Mother of Israel.|$|E
25|$|Most Latter Day Saint sects {{believe that}} {{authority}} from <b>Jesus</b> <b>Christ</b> <b>is</b> {{necessary in order}} to baptize, give the gift of the Holy Ghost, or administer the Lord's Supper (or the sacrament).

25|$|Whether Adam is the personage that {{we should}} {{consider}} Our Heavenly Father, or not, is considerable of a mystery to a good many.
