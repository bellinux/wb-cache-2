40|$|In this appendix, we {{show the}} results of a {{synthetic}} data analysis. We simulate data in a four-brand market, with 2446 observations. The data is generated according to a twostage model, consisting of a multivariate probit consideration set formulation, followed by a multinomial probit brand choice model. We replicate the simulation using four sets of data-generating parameters. We eliminate the <b>empty</b> consideration <b>sets</b> from the data to mimic what happens in extant consideration sets models, which allow for <b>empty</b> consideration <b>sets</b> but do not use <b>empty</b> <b>sets</b> observations. Averaged across the replications, 1796 observations remain. On the resulting dataset, we estimate our model, which takes into account that <b>empty</b> consideration <b>sets</b> might occur, and compare it to a benchmark model that uses a multivariate probit model in the consideration set stage that {{does not take into account}} that <b>empty</b> consideration <b>sets</b> are present in practice. The goal of this analysis is twofold: To show that our model can recover the DGP parameters well; To show that our model outperforms competing models when <b>empty</b> consideration <b>sets</b> are present, but not observed as is the case in most scanner panel datasets...|$|R
5|$|There {{is another}} {{concrete}} definition of evenness: if {{the objects in}} a set can be placed into two groups of equal size, then the number of objects is even. This definition {{is equivalent to the}} first one. Again, zero is even because the <b>empty</b> <b>set</b> can be divided into two groups of zero items each.|$|E
5|$|Zero is a number, {{and numbers}} {{are used for}} counting. Given a set of objects, one uses a number to {{describe}} how many objects are in the set. Zero is the count of no objects; in more formal terms, it {{is the number of}} objects in the <b>empty</b> <b>set.</b> The concept of parity is used for making groups of two objects. If the objects in a set can be marked off into groups of two, with none left over, then the number of objects is even. If an object is left over, then the number of objects is odd. The <b>empty</b> <b>set</b> contains zero groups of two, and no object is left over from this grouping, so zero is even.|$|E
