40|$|We have {{analyzed}} whether caudal {{regions of}} the caudate putamen receive <b>direct</b> <b>projections</b> from thalamic sensory relay nuclei such as the ventrobasal complex. To this aim, the delivery of the retrograde neuroanatomical tracer Fluoro-Gold into the caudal caudate putamen resulted in the appearance of retrogradely labeled neurons in the ventral posteromedial and ventral posterolateral thalamic nuclei. These projections were further confirmed with injections of the anterograde tracers biotinylated dextran amine or Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin into these thalamic nuclei, by showing the existence of axonal terminal fields located in the caudal striatum. These results support the existence of <b>direct</b> <b>projections</b> linking the thalamic ventrobasal complex and the caudal striatum in the rat, probably via collateralization of thalamocortical axons when passing through the caudate putamen, and therefore supporting the putative involvement of the caudal striatum in sensory-related functions...|$|R
40|$|Rodents {{constitute}} good {{models for}} studying the neural basis of sociosexual behavior. Recent findings in mice have revealed the molecular identity of the some pheromonal molecules triggering intersexual attraction. However, the neural pathways mediating this basic sociosexual behavior remain elusive. Since previous work indicates that the dopaminergic tegmento-striatal pathway {{is not involved in}} pheromone reward, the present report explores alternative pathways linking the vomeronasal system with the tegmento-striatal system (the limbic basal ganglia) by means of tract-tracing experiments studying <b>direct</b> and indirect <b>projections</b> from the chemosensory amygdala to the ventral striato-pallidum. Amygdaloid projections to the nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, and adjoining structures are studied by analyzing the retrograde transport in the amygdala from dextran amine and fluorogold injections in the ventral striatum, as well as the anterograde labeling found in the ventral striato-pallidum after dextran amine injections in the amygdala. This combination of anterograde and retrograde tracing experiments reveals <b>direct</b> <b>projections</b> from the vomeronasal cortex to the ventral striato-pallidum, as well as indirect projections through different nuclei of the basolateral amygdala. <b>Direct</b> <b>projections</b> innervate mainly the olfactory tubercle and the islands of Calleja, whereas indirect projections are more widespread and reach the same structures and the shell and core of nucleus accumbens. These pathways are likely to mediate innate responses to pheromones (<b>direct</b> <b>projections)</b> and conditioned responses to associated chemosensory and non-chemosensory stimuli (indirect projections). Comparative studies indicate that similar connections are present in all the studied amniote vertebrates and might constitute the basic circuitry for emotional responses to conspecifics in most vertebrates, including humans...|$|R

40|$|Studies {{in humans}} and monkeys report {{widespread}} multisensory interactions {{at or near}} primary visual and auditory areas of neocortex. The range and scale of these effects has prompted increased interest in interconnectivity between the putatively “unisensory” cortices at lower hierarchical levels. Recent anatomical tract-tracing studies have revealed <b>direct</b> <b>projections</b> from auditory cortex to primary visual area (V 1) and secondary visual area (V 2) {{that could serve as}} a substrate for auditory influences over low-level visual processing. To better understand the significance of these connections, we looked for reciprocal projections from visual cortex to caudal auditory cortical areas in macaque monkeys. We found <b>direct</b> <b>projections</b> from area prostriata and the peripheral visual representations of area V 2. Projections were more abundant after injections of temporoparietal area and caudal parabelt than after injections of caudal medial belt and the contiguous areas near the fundus of the lateral sulcus. Only one injection was confined to primary auditory cortex (area A 1) and did not demonstrate visual connections. The projections from visual areas originated mainly from infragranular layers, suggestive of a “feedback”-type projection. The selective localization of these connections to peripheral visual areas and caudal auditory cortex suggests that they are involved in spatial localization...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{posterior}} {{parietal cortex}} (PPC) {{serves as an}} interface between sensory and motor cortices by integrating multisensory signals with motor-related information. Sensorimotor transformation of somatosensory signals is crucial for the generation and updating of body representations and movement plans. Using retrograde transneuronal transfer of rabies virus in combination with a conventional tracer, we identified direct and polysynaptic somatosensory pathways to two posterior parietal areas, the ventral lateral intraparietal area (LIPv) and the rostral part of the medial intraparietal area (MIP) in macaque monkeys. In addition to <b>direct</b> <b>projections</b> from somatosensory areas 2 v and 3 a, respectively, we found that LIPv and MIP receive disynaptic inputs from the dorsal column nuclei as directly as these somatosensory areas, via a parallel channel. LIPv is the target of minor neck muscle-related projections from the cuneate (Cu) and the external cuneate nuclei (ECu), and <b>direct</b> <b>projections</b> from area 2 v, that likely carry kinesthetic/vestibular/optokinetic-related signals. In contrast, MIP receives major arm and shoulder proprioceptive inputs disynaptically from the rostral Cu and ECu, and trisynaptically (via area 3 a) from caudal portions of these nuclei. These findings {{have important implications for}} the understanding of the influence of proprioceptive information on movement control operations of the PPC and the formation of body representations.
