The hybrid heterostructures such as core-shell nanowires tend to improve the properties of the nanowires in the application of high-temperature sensing [4] and high-performance field-effect transistors [5] and the enhancement of hydrogen generation efficiency in visible photocatalytic processes [6]. SiC nanostructures are well known for their superior mechanical properties, high thermal conductivity, low thermal-expansion coefficient, good thermal-shock resistance, chemical stability, and electron affinity which make them excellent candidates for work in harsh environments [7, 8].

40|$|Irreversible {{electroporation}} (IRE) is a {{new technology}} for ablating aberrant tissue that utilizes pulsed electric fields (PEFs) to kill cells by destabilizing their plasma membrane. When treatments are planned correctly, the pulse parameters and location of the electro-des for delivering the pulses are selected to permit destruction of the target tissue without causing thermal damage to the surrounding structures.

In all three patients groups severe disturbances of skin microcirculation could be observed. In the POAD group changes of areterial perfusion pressure play an important role for microcirculatory responses. When perfusion pressure is impaired by leg elevantion tcPO 2 recordings are impaired, too. In contrast to healthy subjects who show a decrease of cutaneous flow when they rise form lying to standing, all patients with PAOD increased with tcPO 2 (37 degree C) indicating the disturbance of integrity of this reflex. The same pattern of reactions occurs during the venous occlusion manoeuvre. Patients with CVI are mainly compromised by their venous hypertension. Leg elevation leeds to an outflow of blood from venous pools. Therefore skin capillary blood flow is increased as was shown by both methods. When venous pressure is incrased during leg dependency cutaneous blood flow is derminished. This effect is more marked than the pure vasoconstrictor response in healthy subjects. The same effect could be recorded during the venous occlusion procedure. In the third group (PAOD combined with CVI) most of the effects on skin microcirculate are paralysed by both disorders.

30|$|The EIS and cycling {{capacity}} {{indicate that}} the 5 - and 8 -ton pressed electrodes with the poorest wettability would require much longer wetting time for reaching their true electrochemical potential capacity. In general, longer wetting time requirements would be stressful for the fast productivity of batteries and can only be considered to some degree upon optimization and balancing to desired electrochemical properties. Figure  4 c demonstrates the stable cycle behavior of calendered electrodes compared to the not-pressed electrodes, but with a capacity tradeoff which was considerable of 3 - and 5 -ton pressed electrode cells. In Fig.  4 c, the not-pressed electrode cell showed a delithiation charge capacity of 629.3  mAh g− 1 in the first cycle which faded to 552.6 mAh g− 1 at 100 th cycle at 0.5 C cycling. The not-pressed Si/alloy electrodes showed high capacity at the first cycle and started to fade gradually for the next 20 cycles before stabilizing. The gradual fading for the initial cycles in not-pressed Si/alloy electrode cell is attributed to its relatively high lithium loss in solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formations due to its high active surface area (Fig.  3 b). It was also observed that during the cycle stabilizing stage, the capacity gradually increases for next following cycles which {{can be attributed to}} the increased lithiation into new active sites of the electrode as electrolyte wettability (i.e., electrolyte activating new open sites of the electrodes and also impregnating into deeper <b>electrode</b> <b>core)</b> gets improved with extended cycling. Similar cycling behavior was reported in the prior Si anode works [30, 31]. The calendered electrode cells showed a first cycle capacity of 574.2, 368.0, and 288.3  mAh g− 1 for the 3 -, 5 -, and 8 -ton pressed electrodes, respectively. The capacity of the calendered electrode cells was lower because of the reduced active surface area (low surface area for pressed electrodes, Fig.  3 b) and poor electrolyte wettability (increasing contact angle with pressing, Fig.  2 c) limiting the overall electrochemical activity. However, the calendered electrode cells showed very stable cycle retention behavior compared to the not-pressed electrode cell due to improved particle-to-particle contact with pressing and improved particles connectivity. The capacity after 100 cycles for the 3 -, 5 -, and 8 -ton pressed electrode cells was 606.1, 375.7, and 284.7  mAh g− 1, respectively.|$|E

Some disadvantages are that this process can produce excessive, noxious smoke (making it difficult to see the weld pool); As with all welding processes, the proper electrode must be chosen to obtain the required mechanical properties.

Six kinds of electrodes were investigated {{to determine the effect}} of electrode design/material on electrode life and welding performance. The variables were material (Class 2 and Class 3), electrode shape (Dome and Parabolic), and coating on the electrode surface (Ni/TiC coating). Weld qualities were evaluated with mechanical tests, such as tensile shear and peel test, and analyzed using electrical weld signals. Since electrode life and weldability is strongly related to electrode surface degradation, the electrode surface was printed using carbon paper to clearly record the progression of the electrode life cycle. After finishing the electrode life test, the metallurgy of the electrodes was analyzed using standard cross sectioning techniques, optical microscopy, hardness and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques. A new type of <b>electrode,</b> with <b>core</b> inserts, is examined for improvements to weldability and increase electrode life when welding zinc coated advanced high strength steel. By using a refractory material insert, the electrode exhibited a local high resistance which promoted weld nugget growth.

At a low angle of impingement, the abrasive type cutting is the dominating factor for material removal, and at a higher angle of impingement, impact-type as well as abrasive-type cutting actions play critical roles.

30|$|The other {{drawback}} of {{the above}} system is the loosely distributed CdS array on the CF surface, possessing large pores, which allows for polymer to penetrate deeply into the CdS nanobrush structure (see insert in Fig.  3) and to contact with the CF electrode and thus to contribute to undesirable current leakage. This drawback is clearly seen upon comparison of performance of solar cells prepared on the CF and on the flat ITO electrode. The latter geometry provides tighter CdS layer and better solution of the shortcutting problem which is particularly important in cells where the polymer layer (SSPSSC and ISC) or a liquid contact (DSSC) is used. As a result, {{a significant increase in}} the open-circuit voltage can be achieved (Table  2). Therefore, deposition of a tighter CdS shell layer around the CF <b>core</b> <b>electrode</b> is necessary to solve the above problem. Finally, there is a problem with the reliable contact between the organic layer and the top PEDOT:PSS electrode. We have revealed that casting of the PEDOT:PSS electrode from a solution leads to shortcutting problem, but the mechanically pressed PEDOT:PSS film onto the top of the assembly does not provide a tight contact. The above contact problems affect reproducibility of the device substantially, with variation of photocurrent within one order of magnitude depending on the contact quality (cast or pressed, etc.).|$|R

Mathematical models have been devised expressing the levels of controllable welding factors {{as a function of}} the joint geometry, such that acceptable weld beads are produced. Weld beads were required to be both geometrically acceptable and mechanically sound despite changes in the root face thickness (0. 5 mm - 2. 5 mm) and root gap (0 - 1. 5 mm). The equations are intended to form part of an adaptively controlled robotic arc welding system. Simulation was used to develop the adaptive expressions. The study was applied to the root weld bead of the closing seam of railway bogie side frames fabricated from structural steel. The self shielding flux <b>cored</b> <b>electrode</b> arc welding process was used to weld single J preparations orientated in the horizontal-vertical position. Single sided full penetration welds with underbeads were required. The weld bead geometry was defined in terms of ten responses. Mathematical models derived from factorially designed experiments were used to relate the weld bead geometry, incidence of porosity and the occurrence of electrode stubbing to a function of upto seven factors. A data base of almost 1000 test welds was generated, in which each test was characterised by 76 pieces of information. Analysis of variance was used to determine which factors most influenced each of the responses. Multiple regression enabled an expression for each response to be derived {{as a function of the}} welding factor levels.

Structural analysis of the nanocomposite electrodes were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis. The electrochemical performances of the prepared supercapacitor were studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in 1. 0 M Na 2 SO 3 and 1. 0 M Na 2 SO 4 aqueous solutions, respectively. The experimental results showed that the highest specific capacitance of 43 F/g is achieved with a fairly low Fe 3 O 4 nanomaterials loading (4 wt. %) in 1 M Na 2 SO 3. It is clear that the low concentration of nanostructured Fe 3 O 4 has improved the capacitive performance of the composite via pseudocapacitance charge storage mechanism as well as the enhancement on the specific surface areas of the electrode. However, further increasing of the Fe 3 O 4 content in the electrode is found to distort the capacitive performance and deteriorate the specific surface area of the electrode, mainly due to the aggregation of the Fe 3 O 4 particles within the composite. Additionally, the CV results showed that the Fe 3 O 4 /AC nanocomposite electrode in Na 2 SO 3 electrolyte exhibits a better charge storage performance if compared with Na 2 SO 4 solution.

40|$|High-resolution {{electrical}} resistivity measurements {{are made on}} saturated rocks using novel laboratory instrumentation and multiple electrical voltage measurements involving in principle a four-point electrode measurement but with a single, moving <b>electrode.</b> Flat, rectangular <b>core</b> samples are scanned by varying the electrode position over a range of hundreds of millimetres with an accuracy of {{a tenth of a}} millimetre. Two approaches are tested involving a contact electrode and a non-contact electrode arrangement. The first galvanic method uses balanced cycle switching of a floating direct current (DC) source to minimise charge polarisation effects masking the resistivity distribution related to fine scale structure. These contacting electrode measurements are made with high common mode noise rejection via differential amplification with respect to a reference point within the current flow path. A computer based multifunction data acquisition system logs the current through the sample and voltages along equipotentials from which the resistivity measurements are derived. Multiple measurements are combined to create images of the surface resistivity structure, with variable spatial resolution controlled by the electrode spacing. Fine scale sedimentary features and open fractures in saturated rocks are interpreted from the measurements with reference to established relationships between {{electrical resistivity}} and porosity. Our results successfully characterise grainfall lamination and sandflow cross-stratification in a brine saturated, dune bedded core sample representative of a southern North Sea reservoir sandstone, studied using the system in constant current, variable voltage mode. In contrast, in a low porosity marble, identification of open fracture porosity against a background very low matrix porosity is achieved using the constant voltage, variable current mode. This new system is limited by the diameter of the electrode that for practical reasons can only be reduced to between 0. 5 and 0. 75 mm. Improvements to this resolution may be achieved by further reducing the electrode footprint to 0. 1 mm × 0. 1 mm using a novel high-impedance, non-contact potential probe. Initial results with this non-contact electric potential sensor indicate the possibility for generating images with grain-scale resolution...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} {{conducting}} polymers such as poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) to store a drug as a dopant and release it following electrical stimulus make them an intriguing coating possibility for intracortical electrodes, {{along with their}} ability to reduce electrode impedance. The mechanism allows {{for the release of}} an assortment of useful agents, including anti-inflammatory drugs and neuromodulatory chemicals. We evaluated the release capabilities of a multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) -doped PEDOT coating incorporating the anti-inflammatory steroid dexamethasone in vitro using sputtered-gold macroelectrodes, and then applied the coating to half of the electrodes within 16 -shank platinum/iridium floating microelectrode arrays for chronic in vivo evaluation in rat visual cortex. Impedance measurement, neurophysiological recording, and cyclic voltammetric release stimulus (- 0. 9 V to 0. 6 V, 1 V/s, 20 cycles) was performed daily to all channels. On the 11 th day, histology was performed to quantitatively characterize inflammatory tissue response using OX 42 (microglia) and GFAP (astroglia). Equivalent circuit analysis was performed to assist the interpretation of impedance data. Our results indicated that the MWCNT/PEDOT-coated gold macroelectrodes released double the amount of dexamethasone using passive release followed by CV stimulation (10 sets of 20 cycles) compared to passive release alone. Coatings applied to Pt/Ir microelectrodes reduced 1 kHz impedance in PBS by approximately 38 %. Coated probes in vivo exhibited a significant decrease in 1 kHz impedance for the initial three days of implantation followed by an increase, between days 4 and 7, to values equivalent to those exhibited by uncoated probes. Neurophysiological recording performance of coated and uncoated probes remained equivalent {{for the duration of the}} experiment, in terms of signal-to-noise ratio and noise amplitude. Histology revealed no significant difference in tissue inflammatory response to coated and uncoated electrodes. Explant imaging revealed the presence of a membranous film enveloping coated electrodes, and equivalent circuit analysis suggested that the day 4 - 7 increase in 1 kHz impedance of coated electrodes was due to a decrease in effective surface area of the coatings as well as the <b>core</b> <b>electrodes.</b> Additional work was also performed developing a model for the in vivo microinjection of the enzyme Chondroitinase ABC into tissue surrounding implanted microelectrodes...|$|R
40|$|Robotic Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) {{is used in}} fatigue loaded {{structures}} where {{demands on}} weld quality are very high. Bead dimensions of a weld such as penetration bead thickness and toe radius can reveal whether a weld can reach high fatigue life. However, several welding parameters have high impact on these dimensions. From previous research it has been indicated that geometrical parameters such as torch angle, weld position, push or pull direction etc. are the most influential ones concerning quality of a weld with solid wires. Welding technology offers solid or metal cored wires for robotic GMAW. Even though metal cored wires depict several advantages compared to solid, a lot of skepticism is faced among industries due to its higher cost. Response parameters of a fillet weld by robotized GMAW using metal cored wire were investigated {{as a function of}} welding geometry parameters. The goal is to reveal the optimal settings aiming at as high productivity as possible. Iteration of welding tests using solid wire has been made in order to depict repeatability of previous test results with the same settings. Next step consisted of several series of experiments varying geometrical parameters using metal <b>cored</b> <b>electrode.</b> Repetition of this series for different values of wire feed rate has been carried out and comparisons are made. In order to reveal higher possible productivity, a few tests were carried out for the optimal welds from previous steps for different welding speeds and with pulsed welding. Specimens were cut, grinded and etched. Measurement of weld dimensions was performed via Lumenera software. Analysis of the results was made with JMP 11 software by SAS. Results indicated that for metal cored wire the majority of high quality welds were performed in push direction, PA position and gun angle of 35 o. Correlation analysis showed the nature of the relationships between input and output parameters. Prediction models were constructed for all weld dimensions using regression analysis. Tests with higher welding speeds suggest that there are possibilities for productivity improvement. Pulsed welding revealed that only a trade-off between values of bead thickness and penetration can create a quality weld. Less total amount of high quality welds are observed in pulsed welding, in comparison with conventional welding...|$|R
40|$|Fuel cells (FCs) are {{believed}} to be promising energy conversion systems to satisfy today’s increasing energy demand because of their high energy output and zero environmental impact. The cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is recognised to be kinetically limited step in fuel cell. As commonly used electrocatalyst, platinum (Pt) has been inhibited from large-scale production because of its high cost, susceptive to fuel poisons and low stability. Therefore, numerous efforts have been devoted in developing novel nanostructured materials with high efficiency, low cost and environmental friendliness for the ORR. The main goal for this study is to design and develop novel nanostructured electrocatalysts for the ORR to reduce or replace the utilization of Pt, meanwhile with acceptable efficiency, better stability as well as high selectivity to resist the poison from the fuels. Such catalytic materials will would largely reduce the cost of catalysts in FCs and improve the cell performance by facilitating the ORR process and eliminating the by-products. In this study, two analogue FC systems, proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) and anion exchange membrane fuel cell (AEMFC) were considered and different types of electrocatalysts were synthesized and examined in these systems respectively. Pt alloy (Pt-Pd, Pt-Cu) electrocatalysts were firstly synthesized through a facile aqueous based galvanic replacement and their electrocatalytic performance was examined in acidic environment and in PEMFC. One issue that cause the poor stability of Pt is the aggregation and dissolution of Pt nanoparticle on carbon black during the long term electrochemical process. In this study, using the in-situ localization method, Pt nanoparticles were grown on a palladium shells through a modified galvanic replacement forming a Pt-Pd alloyed nanostructure. This material showed enhanced ORR performance and better stability under the accelerated durability test (ADT) up to 10, 000 cycles. The electrochemical performance of this materials were analysed through the rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) and single H 2 /O 2 proton exchange membrane fuel cell test. The improved electrocatalytic performance and better stability were attributed to the unique structure of Pt/Pd and the strain effects caused by the incorporation of Pd into the lattice of Pt. A hollow platinum-copper (PtCu) nanoparticle with mesoporous features was prepared through a modified galvanic replacement method using copper nanoparticles as sacrificial templates. The bimetallic PtCu nanoparticle with much lower cost compared with the Pt, showed improved electrocatalytic performance towards the ORR and with extreme stability under the ADT up to 10, 000 cycles. The performance of this material was investigated using various electrochemical testing methods including the rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) and single H 2 /O 2 proton exchange membrane fuel cell test. The improved performance of this material was attributed to the geometric and electronic changes of Pt surface due to the alloying of copper, abundant mass transfer channels and the high specific surface area of the mesoporous PtCu. In the alkaline medium; oxygen could be reduced through a faster reaction kinetic thus offering more choices in selecting electrocatalysts. Moreover, with the development of anion exchange membrane (AEM) in recent decades, the AEMFC has been witnessed as a promising fuel cell system that could provide comparable electrocatalytic performance with the PEMFC. Therefore there is an urgent need for developing novel ORR electrocatalysts in alkaline medium and for AMEFC. Following the development of this sacrificial template method, a palladium (Pd) - nickel (Ni) hollow nanoparticle using Pd and Ni to replace the utilization of Pt was synthesized and the electrocatalytic performance of this material was examined under the alkaline medium and in AMEFC. The PdNi alloyed hollow nanoparticles showed porous features on the shells and also exhibited much improved electrocatalytic performance and stability compared with the commercial Pt/C. The electrochemical tests were performed through the rotating disk electrode (RDE) system and AEMFC test. The improved performance of this material was ascribed to the changes of electronic structure and the “strain effect” of Pd when alloying Pd with Ni. In addition, porous structure of this material would also provide large surface area and active sites thus benefiting the reduction of oxygen and mass transfer through the nanoparticles. Further work includes the synthesis of nitrogen doped graphene nanostructures for the oxygen reduction reaction in the alkaline medium. For this work, the thin polypyrrole (PPy) was deposited onto the graphene aerogel through vapor phase polymerisation (VPP) and the deposited PPy was used as a nitrogen source to provide nitrogen into graphene lattice when thermal treatment. The advantage of this method is that, the deposited PPy could effectively prevent graphene sheets from stacking during the drying and thermal annealing process and the robust crumpled graphene sheets could also be produced during this process. This 3 -dimensional (3 D) microporous structure could provide the electrocatalysts with ample active site and abundant ion and mass transfer channels thereby facilitating the ORR process. In this process, the nitrogen content and configuration could be well managed through varying the heating temperature thus providing further ways in regulating the ORR performance of the electrocatalysts. The electrochemical properties were tested using the rotating disk electrode (RDE) system and anion exchange membrane fuel cell test revealing the improved catalytic performance of this material compared with the traditional prepared nitrogen doped flat graphene materials. The improved electrocatalytic performance was suggested to arisen from the optimised n itrogen configuration and the robust 3 D porous structure on the <b>electrodes.</b> In addition, <b>core</b> shell cobalt and cobalt oxide nanostructure supported on nitrogen doped graphene aerogel was also prepared at last and used an comparable electrocatalysts with Pt for the AMEFC. The cobalt oxides coupled on graphene supports have been widely reported with improved catalytic ORR performance, however the relatively low electrical conductiv ities were thought to inhibit the electron transfer around the nanoparticle s. Inspiring the advantage of the core shell nanostructure, a core shell structured consis ting of cobalt core and cobalt oxide shell was prepared and anchored onto the graphene sheets through a feasible one-pot hydrothermal process. This material was characterised with sc anning electron microsc opy, transition electron microscopy and energy X-ray dispersive ma pping analysis to confirm the successful synthesis of core shell structure. The elec trochemical performan ce was tested through the rotating disk electrode (RDE) showing improved performance in comparison with the pure cobalt oxide or nitrogen doped graphe ne aerogel electrocatal ysts. The improved electrocatalytic performance wa s attributed to the well-defin ed core shell structure and the designed 3 D structure of the supporting materials...|$|R
