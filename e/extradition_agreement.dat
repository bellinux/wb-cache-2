5|$|On January 12, 2011 Itzhak and Meir Abergil, {{together}} with Sasson Barashy, Moshe Malul and Israel Ozifa, were extradited to the US, arriving in Los Angeles on January 13, aboard an American government airplane. They {{were being held}} in the Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles, facing a 77-page, 32-count federal indictment that alleges murder, massive embezzlement, money laundering, racketeering and running a large Los Angeles-based Ecstasy ring. The trial was set for November 8, 2011 in the Los Angeles Federal District Court. If convicted, they may face life imprisonment, but not the death penalty, as US authorities have promised their Israeli counterparts that even if found guilty of murder, the five suspects would not be given the death penalty. Under {{the terms of the}} <b>extradition</b> <b>agreement,</b> they would likely serve their sentence in an Israeli prison. Shortly after the extradition, a threatening letter was found under the car of the wife of the Prosecutor who was involved in the extradition.|$|E

The government in Yemen is aware of the UK's request to question Abdulhak, however the UK does not have an <b>extradition</b> <b>agreement</b> with Yemen. A demonstration in Oslo on 1 December 2009 called for further action from Norwegian authorities.|$|E
25|$|It {{emerged that}} a number of the {{suspects}} made prepared statements to police {{on both sides of the}} border, with their legal representatives present, in the weeks after the murder. They were then questioned under caution by the authorities. As the suspects live and travel between the Republic and Northern Ireland, extraditions may have to be sought to bring those responsible to justice in the Republic of Ireland. An <b>Extradition</b> <b>Agreement</b> in place between the Irish and British governments means that extradition orders can only be made when the police force requesting the extradition has sufficient evidence to charge the suspect, and can only question them after they are charged in a court of law.|$|E

40|$|The {{successful}} {{operation of}} international <b>extradition</b> <b>agreements</b> requires good faith and fairness from sovereign states in {{their dealings with}} one another. Fraud {{in the performance of}} treaty obligations derogates the underlying norms of international public order. If sovereign states are to trust one another in discharging their mutual obligations under any treaty, some body of imperative norms-the violation of which is actionable by the victimized sovereign-is necessary. However, while international extradition treaties impose reciprocal obligations on sovereign states, remedies for the violation of these assumed norms are deficient. This comment highlights the potential for abuse of international <b>extradition</b> <b>agreements</b> through fraud and the injustice resulting from the lack of adequate remedies for such abuse...|$|R
50|$|Originally a {{professor}} at University of Hong Kong, because of the <b>extradition</b> <b>agreements</b> between the US and Hong Kong, Cheung has since stayed in mainland China, {{a country that has}} no such agreements with America.

500|$|Lee Bo (aka Paul Lee, 李波, age 65), was a British {{citizen and}} the husband of Sophie Choi, who is in turn {{one of the three}} {{shareholders}} of Mighty Current. Lee regularly helped out in the bookstore. Lee Bo's wife has written a column for 20 years under the pen name of Syu Fei at Ta Kung Pao – owned by the Liaison Office; Lee worked at Joint Publishing until he started work at the bookstore. Since the disappearances of four of his colleagues, he had been doing anonymous interviews with BBC and various media. After the arrest of Yiu Man-tin and the disappearance of three of his colleagues, Lee went on record to say that their motive was purely economic, and that not setting foot in the mainland was the cost to bear for being in the publishing business. Lee was last seen on 30 December 2015, while delivering books in Chai Wan to a certain unknown client. Choi, who had been expecting Lee home for dinner at around 7.15pm on 30 December, raised the alarm when he failed to return home. Lee had apparently received an order for about ten books from a new customer and had arranged to hand them over in person that night. He descended his building in a lift with at least eight other people at around 6pm, and witnesses saw him being pushed by a group of men into a minivan, which sped away the moment he was securely on board. Choi, Lee Bo's wife, later received a telephone call from him from a Shenzhen number. Uncharacteristically speaking in Mandarin Chinese and apparently with someone whispering over his shoulder, Lee said that {{he had to go to}} the mainland on urgent business and that he would not be back home for some time. He assured her that he was well but assisting with investigations. His wife was told to be discreet. The Immigration Department has no record of Lee having left Hong Kong, and Hong Kong does not have any <b>extradition</b> <b>agreement</b> with the PRC. The fact that his home return permit was left at home led many to fear that he may have somehow been abducted by the mainland public security bureau and renditioned to Shenzhen. His disappearance is the only known disappearance that occurred in Hong Kong territory, and thus sparked even more concern on whether the integrity of [...] "one country, two systems" [...] is being maintained.|$|E
2500|$|In 1978, Kavaja and SOPO companions {{numbering}} {{over one}} hundred (including Stojiljko Kajević) were arrested in New York City by U.S. law enforcement officials. Kavaja was released on $250,000 bail, and after visiting his family in New York City, on June 20, 1979 he hijacked an American Airlines 727 (Flight 293 from New York City to Chicago). He planned to demand Kajević's release and then fly to a destination of Kajević's choosing. When he realized that Kajević would not be released, he let the plane's passengers go, retaining only the pilot, co-pilot and flight engineer. In an odd twist, included in this group was his own lawyer Deyan Rasha Brashich that took {{the place of the}} Hostages [...] David Lenevsky, who is the same attorney used by renowned Serbian-American crime lord Vojislav Stanimirović for the Vizcaya Heist case. [...] He forced the crew to fly back from Chicago to JFK Airport in New York City. There, he transferred to a larger plane (a Boeing 707) and demanded to be taken to Johannesburg, South Africa. On the advice of his lawyer David Lenevsky he flew to Ireland, which he was told did not have an <b>extradition</b> <b>agreement</b> with the United States. Hoping for political asylum, Kavaja surrendered in Shannon, Ireland with attorney Deyan Ranko Brashich [...] and Kavaja was returned to America to again face a criminal trial.|$|E

50|$|On 13 January, Wang and {{his wife}} left the PRC for the United States {{arriving}} at Los Angeles with Wang using his ROC passport with a B1 visa, {{and his wife}} entering using her US passport. Two days later, the Taipei Prosecutor's Office declared Wang a wanted fugitive, and his ROC passport was revoked by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA). MOFA also contacted the US Department of Justice (DOJ) requesting assistance in having Wang extradited back to Taiwan. However, this proved to be difficult as the ROC's diplomatic isolation meant that it had few standing <b>extradition</b> <b>agreements</b> with other states, though US authorities did have an information sharing system in place which was used to coordinate efforts between the two sides.|$|R
50|$|SS Polarlys was the {{backdrop}} of the first detective novel Georges Simenon (of Maigret fame) ever signed with his real name instead of a pseudonym. In this non-Maigret novel (French title Le Passager du Polarlys) the ship's captain (whose character is not unlike Maigret) has to turn detective after a German police investigator has been murdered on board his ship, in connection with the drug-related death of a young model in the Montparnasse painters and drop-outs Parisian community of the roaring twenties. The whole story unfolds during the trip from Hamburg (then the start of the Bergen Steamship Company arm of the Hurtigruten) to the northern Hurtigruten terminal in Kirkenes where the criminal commits suicide by jumping overboard, while his female accomplice (and sister) attempts escape to Soviet Union (then without <b>extradition</b> <b>agreements</b> with capitalist western countries).|$|R

5000|$|The BBC {{reports that}} a [...] "source close to the investigation" [...] admits {{that there is not}} {{currently}} enough evidence to try Tan in Singapore, particularly since the two members of the syndicate whose testimony was responsible for his arrest refuse to testify in open court. No other jurisdiction with an outstanding warrant for his arrest has <b>extradition</b> <b>agreements</b> with the country. However, it remains possible that he could be held indefinitely: §44 of the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act permits a suspect to be held 16 days from the time of his arrest and §241 of the 1955 Prevention of Corruption Act permits him to be held up to a year without trial. Such a decision will be considered by the Ministry of Home Affairs and an advisory council before being personally made by President Tony Tan. Further, Singapore still does not formally acknowledge his detention and the year-long pretrial term can be extended by the authorities.|$|R

50|$|After {{being taken}} into custody, McCord {{was shocked to}} learn that the penalty for drug {{smuggling}} in Bangladesh was death. The police allegedly led McCord to believe that if she identified the supplier who gave her the heroin, all charges would be dropped and she would be allowed to go home. As an American teenager raised to trust the police, McCord perhaps took them at their word. She told Christian Reader Magazine that she had heard of <b>extradition</b> <b>agreements</b> and expected, at the very least, to be returned to the US once she led them to the supplier. Her good behavior in prison, {{and the fact that the}} judge did not believe McCord to be a frequent smuggler, resulted in McCord receiving a life sentence rather than death by hanging. McCord reported being told that the court asked the Americans if they could sentence her to hang as a sign of solidarity with the US Government's War on Drugs. McCord was told that the court was advised that the Americans would accept no harsher sentence for their citizen than what had historically been handed down to one of their own women for a similar case. Days before McCord's sentencing hearing, she told Christian Reader, a renowned drug dealer in Dhaka was sentenced mid-trial to life imprisonment. She was later released for mistrial, but the precedent had been set; McCord was sentenced to 30 years—the Bangladeshi equivalent of a life sentence.|$|R

40|$|<b>Extradition</b> <b>agreements</b> between Member States {{and third}} States {{fall within the}} {{competence}} of Member States, but the ruling in Aleksei Petruhhin (Court of Justice, judgment of 6 September 2016, case C- 182 / 15 [GC]) shows that Member States must exercise this competence in light of EU law if extradition may affect an EU citizen’s fundamental rights protected under the Treaties and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. This can be the case if the EU citizen who is subject to extradition has exercised his right to free movement by moving from his home State to another Member State. Extradition of Petruhhin, an Estonian citizen, was requested by Russia while he was exercising his right to freedom of movement and residence in Latvia. As {{is the case in}} many States, the national law of Latvia does not extend the same level of protection against extradition to foreign citizens, as to its own nationals. The Court of Justice ruled that in such a case, extradition of an EU citizen to a third State is generally prohibited under Art. 18 TFEU and can only be justified if the prosecution in the home Member State is not possible. In addition, this case confirms earlier rulings that the extradition of an EU citizen will not be permitted if his fundamental rights under the Charter will be endangered in the requesting State. The case concerns prohibitions of absolute character, such as prohibition against torture and degrading treatment. To determine the possibility of breach of rights under the Charter, the Member State must undertake a rigorous verification of the level of protection of human rights in the relevant third State before deciding whether to grant the extradition request...|$|R

50|$|The {{consensus}} {{in international law}} is that a state {{does not have any}} obligation to surrender an alleged criminal to a foreign state, because one principle of sovereignty is that every state has legal authority over the people within its borders. Such absence of international obligation, and the desire for the right to demand such criminals from other countries, have caused a web of extradition treaties or agreements to evolve. When no applicable <b>extradition</b> <b>agreement</b> is in place, a sovereign may still request the expulsion or lawful return of an individual pursuant to the requested state’s domestic law. This can be accomplished through the immigration laws of the requested state or other facets of the requested state’s domestic law. Similarly, the codes of penal procedure in many countries contain provisions allowing for extradition to take place {{in the absence of an}} <b>extradition</b> <b>agreement.</b> Sovereigns may, therefore, still request the expulsion or lawful return of a fugitive from the territory of a requested state in the absence of an extradition treaty.|$|E
