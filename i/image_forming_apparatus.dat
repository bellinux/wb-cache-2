40|$|The {{overflow}} fusion {{process was}} an important method for the manufacture of glass sheet that is currently used {{for the production of}} TFT/LCD display devices. The design of <b>forming</b> <b>apparatus</b> was critical for very high surface quality of glass to allow the successful application of semiconductor type material. However, there is only a little of researches had been presented in the literatures, because of difficulties and expansions in experiments. In this study, a numerical model for simulation of molten glass flow through the isopipe during overflow fusion process was carried out. The effect of temperature of <b>forming</b> <b>apparatus</b> and of molten glass on the flow patterns during overflow fusion process was investigated. It was found that the stability and flatness of sheet glass was influenced strongly by the temperature of <b>forming</b> <b>apparatus</b> and molten glass. A precise control of overflow temperature and temperature distribution of isopipe was needed for maintaining a stable flow and uniform thickness...|$|R

40|$|A {{favorable}} {{image of}} the territory is a factor of attracting investors, tourists and labor force. Using of image approach to foreign territory management practice is already producing positive effects, {{but there are some}} difficulties in Russia, particularly in the Far East. Authors explore scientific publications in a foreign press, describing various marketing techniques used to territorial <b>image</b> <b>forming</b> in foreign countries. The territorial image is its image {{from the point of view}} of different public groups. Favorable territorial image is a powerful way of working with mass consciousness. Territorial <b>image</b> can be <b>formed</b> by various marketing techniques. This article presents the results of a preliminary study of scientific publications of materials in the past three years, selected for content analysis in foreign databases such as Scopus and Web of Science. This study was conducted by a traditional analysis of documents. Its aim was the selection of publications describing the use different marketing techniques of territorial <b>image</b> <b>forming</b> in foreign countries and their grouping according to the technology used and the time period. The analysis has revealed the relationship between using individual technologies of territorial <b>image</b> <b>forming</b> and territorial life cycle stages. Based on these results authors suggested the following algorithm for successful image formation of Russian Far East regions: 1) diagnosis of region life cycle stage; 2) assessment of the current image of region; 3) assessment of image parameters corresponding to region life cycle stage and consumers’ needs; 4) using of <b>image</b> <b>forming</b> marketing technologies. Directions for further research of the author of this work are: modeling of interrelation between the territorial life cycle stage and <b>image</b> <b>forming</b> factors; diagnosis of Russian Far East regions life cycle stages; assessment of the current images of Russian Far East regions; development of <b>image</b> <b>forming</b> strategies for Russian Far East regions...|$|R

40|$|We show that, {{when the}} <b>images</b> <b>formed,</b> the frontal {{part of the}} Shroud of Turin laid on a body in the same {{position}} as when the blood stains formed by contact. In other words, after the Shroud was laid on top of a body, no forceful flattening occurred before the <b>images</b> <b>formed.</b> Moreover, the argument that {{the top half of the}} Shroud could not have been draping a real body when the <b>images</b> <b>formed</b> – to avoid prominent image distortions – is shown to be incorrect. If a cloth is appropriately laid on the front part of a body, and a body <b>image</b> <b>forms</b> by a vertical projection on the cloth, no major image distortions occur. Small image distortions are to be expected, and indeed we can observe some on the Shroud. These two aspects – the Shroud was not forcefully flattened before the <b>images</b> <b>formed</b> and no major image distortions occur due to the way the Shroud was laid on the body – give the simplest scenario for the formation of the images. There is no need to claim a special event that would have flattened the Shroud before the <b>images</b> <b>formed.</b> Our analysis is based on precise length measurements on digital images, the blood stain locations, and geometry.

We interpret the occurrence of this <b>image</b> <b>form</b> {{in terms of a}} chemical bond that forms between the apex of the tip and the nearest Ga atom in the top row of the sample surface. The formation of such a bond has recently been predicted theoretically.
