These equations are based on measurements performed at Oslo airport in 2001. Implementation of the routines into NORTIM is ahead of standardization, a decision taken to minimize the differences between calculated noise levels and results from noise monitoring systems. It is also a conservative step, since the new routines ends the overestimation of lateral attenuation in the existing standard. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of a noise prediction tool for the simulation of <b>engine</b> <b>installation</b> <b>effects</b> involving high frequency sources and large scale configurations of arbitrary geometry is described in this paper. The program, Fast Scattering Code (FSC) v 3. 1 /v 3. 2, incorporates an iterative conjugate gradient method (CGM) for fast convergence and parallel programming constructs for multi-processor usage in shared and distributed memory environments. The frequency limitations of the single processor codes FSC v 2. 0 /v 3. 0 are eliminated by using direct matrix-vector multiplication with minimal memory requirements. The applicability of the code is demonstrated through comparisons with experimental data obtained at the NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) for a 3 % scale model of a blended wing body (BWB) airframe. Although {{the characteristics of the}} ducted noise generator used in the tests could not be fully simulated, predicted nacelle <b>installation</b> <b>effects</b> are in very good agreement with the measured data.

40|$|The major {{techniques}} for measuring jet noise have significant drawbacks, especially when including <b>engine</b> <b>installation</b> <b>effects</b> such as jet–flap interaction noise. Numerical methods including low order correlations and Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) {{are known to}} be deficient for complex configurations and even simple jet flows. Using high fidelity numerical methods such as large eddy simulation (LES) allows conditions to be carefully controlled and quantified. LES methods are more practical and affordable than experimental campaigns. The potential to use LES methods to predict noise, identify noise risks, and thus modify designs before an engine or aircraft is built is a possibility in the near future. This is particularly true for applications at lower Reynolds numbers such as jet noise of business jets and jet-flap interaction noise for under-wing <b>engine</b> <b>installations.</b> Hence, we introduce our current approaches to predicting jet noise reliably and contrast the cost of RANS–numerical-LES (RANS–NLES) with traditional methods. Our own predictions and existing literature are used to provide a current guide, encompassing numerical aspects, meshing, and acoustics processing. Other approaches are also briefly considered. We also tackle the crucial issues of how codes can be validated and verified for acoustics and how LES-based methods can be introduced into industry. We consider that hybrid RANS–(N) LES is now of use to industry and contrast costs, indicating the clear advantages of eddy resolving methods...|$|R
40|$|The {{wind tunnel}} {{is still an}} {{important}} pillar for the aerodynamic investigations of <b>engine</b> <b>installation</b> <b>effects,</b> such as the strong aerodynamic interferences between an underwing mounted engine and the wing itself. To consider real engine effects on the aerodynamics in the wind tunnel environment the turbine powered simulator (TPS) technique {{is one of the}} widely applied technologis. Especially for underwing installed engines thrust affects the aerodynamic drag. Reflecting the fact that in modern aircraft design <b>engine</b> <b>installation</b> improvements on drag counts in small numbers, and considering that the TPS technology cannot match the real engine in all parameters, the questions arises if no matching parameters exist what is their influence on drag. Usually fan Mach numbers and total thrust coefficients of the real engine can be correctly realized by TPS. In the present contribution the essential parameters of engine simulation are determined and in particular the thrust ratios, i. e. turbine thrust to fan thrust of real engines and simulators at different bypass ratios (BPR) in the range of 6 – 17 at cruise conditions will be evaluated. Considerable differences of the thrust ratios between the engines and the simulators exist in particular at high freestream Mach numbers. Therefore, the aim of this contribution will be to clarify the influence of the thrust ratio on the drag behaviour of an aircraft configuration. First, the theoretical background on the drag determination theory is derived. Based on this theory the analysis of the thrust ratio is done using mainly experimental results. Additional numerical results by solving the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations are used to support the analysis...|$|R

40|$|There is a {{need for}} a wave drag method that {{combines}} the speed of handbook methods with the accuracy of computational methods. Especially determining the onset of wave drag as well as the initial drag rise is important in initial design stages. Meta-models allow this by capturing the trends present in previously computed data, providing an accurate and fast representation. In this report, it is investigated what gains can be achieved by applying the meta-modeling method GT-Approx to the aerodynamic tool MSES. The total drag calculated by MSES for a super critical airfoil was verified using wind tunnel experiments. It was found that aerodynamic characteristics and pressure distributions are accurate up until M = 0. 76. GT-Approx was critically evaluated. It was found that the general prediction quality was good, but that the error increased substantially for complex cases, such as high M or high cl This issue is solved by increasing the resolution of the input data. By optimizing the resolution for the different input variables the average prediction error decreased by 30 % for cdv and 70 % for cdw. Especially for the difficult cases, the accuracy greatly improved. Two A 320 variants are evaluated using GT-Approx and a direct application of MSES. The performance of GTApprox is good. An average difference of 0. 21 drag counts between MSES and GT-Approx was achieved, with an in-calculation computation time of 5. 13 ? 10 ??s per calculation instead of 5. 58 s using a direct application of MSES. GT-Approx is extended to a quasi- 3 Dmethod, using the simple sweep method. This quasi- 3 D method is used to calculate the value of CDw for two test cases. The calculated values of CDw are compared with CFD data. It was found that the region of validity of the quasi- 3 D method is highly limited. Up until 60 % of the wing, root and tip effects, fuselage <b>effects</b> and <b>engine</b> <b>installation</b> <b>effects</b> render any comparison useless. Beyond this value the first test case showed no correlation, whereas the second showed reasonable accuracy. Due to lack of more 3 D CFD data, no clear explanation for the difference was found. In general it is concluded that the combination of an aerodynamic tool with a meta-model is able to combine low computation times with high accuracy, but only if the aerodynamic model is accurate.

40|$|Due to a {{trend towards}} Ultra High Bypass Ratio engines the {{corresponding}} engine/airframe interference {{is becoming a}} key aspect in aircraft design. The present economic situation increases the pressure on commercial aviation companies to reduce the Direct Operating Cost, and the environmental situation requires {{a new generation of}} aircraft with a lower environmental impact. Therefore detailed aerodynamic investigations are required to evaluate the real benefits of new technologies. The presented research activity is part of a long-term project with the main objective of generating a reliable and accurate tool to predict the performance of an aircraft over the whole flight domain. In particular the aim of this research was to perform advanced CFD in order to establish a tool able to evaluate <b>engine</b> <b>installation</b> <b>effects</b> for different configurations and attitudes. The developed tool can be provided with correlations of the Net Propulsive Force (NPF), the force exerted by the power-plant to the aircraft, as a function of position. This can be done in principle at cruise, hold, climb, descent, take-off and landing, to model the different integration effects at different phases. Due to the complexity of the problem it was only possible at an initial stage to determine these correlations at cruise condition. Two parametric test cases were evaluated, showing that the engine horizontal positioning can influence the mission fuel burn by up to 6. 4 %. According to the extensive literature review that has been done, this study can be regarded as the first open literature engine position-NPF parametric study using CFD. Even though no correlations were extracted for other conditions; a deployed high-lift wing configuration was also studied in detail, defining the main aerodynamics effects of the engine integration at high angle of attack. A topological study of the high-lift installation vortices is presented in this work and it can be considered the first in the open literature. It {{should be pointed out that}} extensive research is currently underway to correctly evaluate the high-lift aerodynamic using CFD. The Propulsive System Integration (PSI) in high-lift conditions is adding flow features to an already demanding problem, making it a real challenge for the numerical methods. Nevertheless the additional effects of a nacelle chine on the maximum lift were also evaluated. The main outcomes of this PhD research were: a coupled performance modelling tool able to handle the effects of engine-airframe integration as a function of geometry and attitude, and a topological study of the high-lift installation vortices. During the course of the work, this research was successfully suggested as an extra activity for the European NEWAC project (New Aero Engine Core Concepts), and resulted in a new deliverable for that project...|$|R

Data are also compared with the flight results of a boattail plug nozzle and a cylindrical nacelle plug nozzle. A favorable <b>installation</b> <b>effect</b> occurred from Mach 0. 82 to 0. 96 with a nominal 4 -percent corrected secondary weight-flow ratio. This favorable effect resulted from changes in pressure forces on the nozzle surfaces.
