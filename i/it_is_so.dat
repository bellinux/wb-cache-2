5|$|The {{lipid bilayer}} {{is a very}} {{difficult}} structure to study because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> thin and fragile. In spite of these limitations dozens of techniques have been developed over the last seventy years to allow investigations of its structure and function.|$|E
5|$|Banksia sessilis {{is highly}} {{susceptible}} to dieback {{caused by the}} introduced plant pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi, a soil-borne water mould that causes root rot; in fact <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> reliably susceptible that it is considered a good indicator species {{for the presence of}} the disease. Most highly susceptible species quickly become locally extinct in infected areas, {{and in the absence of}} hosts the disease itself eventually dies out. However, B.sessilis, being an aggressive coloniser of disturbed and open ground, often colonises old disease sites. The new colonies are themselves infected, and thus P.cinnamomi survives at these sites indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|Because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> {{far from}} the nearest major landmass, the {{ecosystem}} of Kohala has experienced the phenomenon of geographic isolation, resulting in an ecosystem radically {{different from that of}} other places. Invasive species introduced by man present a problem to Kohala's ecosystem, as they push native species out of their habitat. There are several initiatives to preserve Kohala's ecosystem. Crops, especially sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas), have been harvested on the Leeward side of the volcano for centuries as well. The northern part of the island is named after the mountain, with two districts named North and South Kohala. King Kamehameha I, the first King of the Kingdom of Hawaii, was born in North Kohala, near Hawi.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> sad {{to think}} that in human affairs this {{condition}} is not unfrequently the precursor of misfortune. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> not necessarily <b>so.</b> Happily, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not always <b>so.</b> Indeed, we would fain hope that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not often <b>so,</b> but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> on this occasion.|$|R

5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> {{similar in}} {{morphology}} and habits to the carrion crow (Corvus corone), {{for many years}} they were considered by most authorities to be geographical races of one species. Hybridization observed where their ranges overlapped added weight to this view. However, since 2002, the hooded crow has been elevated to full species status after closer observation; the hybridisation was less than expected and hybrids had decreased vigour. Within the hooded crow species, four subspecies are recognized, with one, the Mesopotamian crow, possibly distinct enough to warrant species status itself.|$|E
5|$|The 5 o'clock wave is {{a fictional}} theory on {{the reasons for}} Wagga Wagga's {{sporting}} success. According to the local urban myth, at precisely 5 o'clock arrives a giant wave which flushes a secret nutrient into the Murrumbidgee River following the release {{of water from the}} Blowering and Burrinjuck Dams. The wave is said to continue down river at high speed, and indeed visitors are told <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> powerful that surfers can ride it along the meandering river until it reaches the town of Narrandera.|$|E
5|$|The score {{came under}} {{scrutiny}} from various soundtrack forums soon after being released. Spectral {{analysis of the}} content of the CD revealed certain frequency cutoff patterns around 16kHz, which are typical for lossy codecs. By analyzing the block size of these cutoffs, individuals at Hydrogenaudio were able to identify the lossy codec that was used before mastering the CD as MP3 with a sample rate of 48kHz. According to the aforementioned forums, Varèse's German subsidiary Colosseum Schallplatten acknowledged this as a mastering error, while Varèse Sarabande itself denied this. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> far unclear if a remastered version with full frequency content will be released.|$|E

5|$|Indium is a silvery-white, highly ductile post-transition metal with {{a bright}} luster. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> soft (Mohs {{hardness}} 1.2) that like sodium, it can be cut with a knife. It also leaves a visible line on paper. It {{is a member of}} group 13 on the periodic table and its properties are mostly intermediate between its vertical neighbours gallium and thallium. Like tin, a high-pitched cry is heard when indium is bent – a crackling sound due to crystal twinning. Like gallium, indium is able to wet glass. Like both, indium has a low melting point, 156.60°C (313.88°F); higher than its lighter homologue, gallium, but lower than its heavier homologue, thallium, and lower than tin. The boiling point is 2072°C (3762°F), higher than that of thallium, but lower than gallium, conversely to the general trend of melting points, but similarly to the trends down the other post-transition metal groups because of the weakness of the metallic bonding with few electrons delocalized.|$|E
5|$|Mercury(I) {{chloride}} (also {{known as}} calomel or mercurous chloride) {{has been used}} in traditional medicine as a diuretic, topical disinfectant, and laxative. Mercury(II) chloride (also known as mercuric chloride or corrosive sublimate) was once used to treat syphilis (along with other mercury compounds), although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> toxic that sometimes the symptoms of its toxicity were confused with those of the syphilis it was believed to treat. It is also used as a disinfectant. Blue mass, a pill or syrup in which mercury is the main ingredient, was prescribed throughout the 19th century for numerous conditions including constipation, depression, child-bearing and toothaches. In the early 20th century, mercury was administered to children yearly as a laxative and dewormer, and it was used in teething powders for infants. The mercury-containing organohalide merbromin (sometimes sold as Mercurochrome) is still widely used but has been banned in some countries such as the U.S.|$|E

5|$|NGC 678 and NGC 680 are a pair {{of galaxies}} in Aries that are only about 200,000 light-years apart. Part of the NGC 691 group of galaxies, both are at a {{distance}} of approximately 130 million light-years. NGC 678 is an edge-on spiral galaxy that is 4.5 by 0.8 arcminutes. NGC 680, an elliptical galaxy with an asymmetrical boundary, is the brighter of the two at magnitude 12.9; NGC 678 has a magnitude of 13.35. Both galaxies have bright cores, but NGC 678 is the larger galaxy at a diameter of 171,000 light-years; NGC 680 has a diameter of 72,000 light-years. NGC 678 is further distinguished by its prominent dust lane. NGC 691 itself is a spiral galaxy slightly inclined to our line of sight. It has multiple spiral arms and a bright core. Because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> diffuse, it has a low surface brightness. It has a diameter of 126,000 light-years and is 124 million light-years away. NGC 877 is the brightest member of an 8-galaxy group that also includes NGC 870, NGC 871, and NGC 876, with a magnitude of 12.53. It is 2.4 by 1.8 arcminutes and is 178 million light-years away with a diameter of 124,000 light-years. Its companion is NGC 876, which is about 103,000 light-years from the core of NGC 877. They are interacting gravitationally, as they are connected by a faint stream of gas and dust. Arp 276 is a different pair of interacting galaxies in Aries, consisting of NGC 935 and IC 1801.|$|E
