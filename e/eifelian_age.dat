It was named for the Kačák Member of the Srbsko Formation in Bohemia, where it is represented by a black shale interval within a sequence of limestone. In marine environments, this appears as an anoxic event, often forming potential hydrocarbon source rocks such as the Marcellus Shale. Within the Old Red Sandstone continent, it is represented by the Achanarras lake, the deepest and most widespread lake that developed within the Orcadian Basin.

The sequence continues with the Rousay flagstones deposited in a similar lacustrine environment. The flagstones show a marked cyclicity in their sedimentation, with 86 such cycles being counted for the whole sequence.

40|$|During the Devonian Period {{the cool}} water Malvinokaffric Realm was located at high palaeolatitudes in the {{southern}} hemisphere. The Realm is defined by its highly endemic marine benthic fauna, which makes extra-Malvinokaffric correlations problematic. Investigation of the Devonian palynomorphs from an extensive regional sub-surface dataset (24 wells) in the Chaco Basin, Bolivia, reveals {{the presence of a}} number of stratigraphically restricted and regionally correlative epiboles (peak abundances) of the distinctive palynomorphs Bimerga bensonii, Crucidia camirense, Evittia sommeri, Petrovina connata and Ramochitina magnifica. These palynomorph epiboles were then located at outcrop by a high-resolution palynological investigation (225 samples) of two Bolivian outcrop localities in the Chaco Basin: Bermejo, Santa Cruz Department and Campo Redondo, Chiquisaca Department. The important Evittia sommeri epibole in the basal Los Monos Formation is related to a marine transgression that is present in both these outcrop sections. Additional chronostratigraphic control on this marine transgression comes from the occurrence of rare goniatites in the base of the Huamampampa Formation at Campo Redondo, which are at least early <b>Eifelian</b> in <b>age</b> (post Chotlatin small letter e with brevec Event). Based on the goniatite together with spore data, the marine transgression with Evittia sommeri in the basal Los Monos Formation can be tentatively assigned to the Mid Devonian (mid-late Eifelian) Ka?ák Event. The presence of a datable Malvinokaffric goniatite has shown that key spore taxa which are used zonally in both Laurussia and Gondwana do not all have coincident first occurrences in both areas. Furthermore, despite the appearance of some cosmopolitan elements in the microflora, Mid and Late Devonian spore assemblages in Bolivia are distinct from other regions in being relatively impoverished in both progymnosperm and lycopod spores. This floral difference is attributable to the Malvinokaffric Realm continuing to retain a distinctive cool climatic signature throughout this interval. However, the sporadic occurrences of extra-Malvinokaffric macrofauna in restricted stratigraphic intervals of the Middle Devonian in South America and South Africa are significant. The oldest known occurrence of the extra-Malvinokaffric brachiopod Tropidoleptus in Bolivia is coincident with the late Eifelian basal Los Monos Formation transgression. Hence there was a relationship between influxes of this fauna and marine transgressions, i. e. temporary periods of reduced climatic gradient. The migration of Devonian spores, and particularly heterosporous spores, between Gondwana and Laurussia clearly occurs during the Mid and Late Devonian. This is at variance with models claiming a wide Rheic Ocean during much of the Devonian...|$|R
40|$|Diverse and well-preserved radiolarian faunas {{are rare}} in the Early Paleozoic, but the {{importance}} of the result of the ages should suggest some idea on the provenance linkage and terrane amalgamation in the NEO. A moderately well-preserved radiolarian fauna consisting of 12 Devonian taxa was recovered from siliceous strata in both the Djungati and Gamilaroi terrane, in the southern New England Orogen, New South Wales. Fauna includes; Trilonche davidi(Hinde), Tr. hindea (Hinde), Tr. echinata (Hinde), Tr. minax (Hinde), Tr. vetusta (Hinde), Tr. elegan (Hinde), Tr. palimbola (Foreman), Tr. tanheensis (Luo, Aitchison 2 ̆ 6 Wang), Palaeoscenidium cladophorus(Deflandre), Stigmosphaerostylus sp., Helenifore laticlavium (Nazarov) and Protoholoeciscus hindea (Aitchison) Results of radiolarian studies on each site provide reliable age constraints on the timing of sedimentation of each terrane. The Birpai sub-terrane recovered well radiolarian faunas that contained Helenifore laticlavium (Nazarov), which dates the terrane to a lower Famennian (Cheng, 1986) the upper Frasnian age. Protoholoeciscus hindea (Aitchison), recovered from the Djungati cherts at the Barnard River dated an age of Lower (Emsian) to Middle (<b>Eifelian)</b> Devonian <b>age.</b> The needle-like spines and spumellarians with three -bladed spines, from the Woolomin beds at Chaffey Dam, are indicative of Middle Devonian and younger radiolarians (Jones and Murchey, 1986). Indicative of fossils are scarce even though there was a thick exposure of cherts reflecting the extensive deformation at this site. The red ribbon-bedded cherts of the Djungati terrane were accreted in a sediment starved trench probably associated with an intra-oceanic island arc, but there is no evidence linking the red-ribbon cherts as an accretionary complex of the Gamilaroi terrane. The rarity of zircons and SHRIMP ages of the two zircons obtained from the coarse sandstones from the Upper Barnard River reflects events of much older origins than the sedimentary rocks themselves, and further support the distal environment for formation. These Devonian lithologies have inherited structural patterns as a result of processes of accretion and orogenesis throughout the Carboniferous. Three different types of structures are distinguished: (i) conjugate arrays of en echelon, quartz-filled tension gashes, showing extensional shear offsets. (ii) Fining directions on tuffs and overlay sequences, showing younging directions. (iii) Fold vergence. From these results geological model of the Chaffey Dam, Yarras district have been established in relation to the NEO. The structural data from this report supports the theory proposed by Aitchison (1992), about the collision of the Gamilaroi terrane giving rise to a subduction flip, causing another subduction zone developed east of accreted Gamilaroi terrane rocks in association with the east-dipping subduction...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{composition}} of the allochthonous flora from Dechra Aït Abdallah (Central Morocco), initially described by Termier and Termier (1950), is reassessed from newly collected fossil material. Our work provides an updated taxonomic treatment of the plant remains. The flora comprises two lycophytes (including Leclercqia complexa), the probable iridopterid Anapaulia moodyi, and two aneurophytalean progymnosperms: Rellimia sp. and "Aneurophyton" maroccanum. Our revision confirms the Termiers' main conclusions that this Devonian flora is to date the most diverse and best known from Africa. Based on the complete paleontological evidence available from this locality, a Givetian age is as likely as an <b>Eifelian</b> <b>age</b> for the flora. The abundance of plant remains associated with the extreme scarcity of fertile organs may {{be accounted for by}} a taphonomic sorting, climatic conditions and/or specific ecological strategies. The flora of Dechra Aït Abdallah shows similarities with the Middle Devonian floras from the European part of Laurussia.

40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} {{precisely}} establish the bio- and chronostratigraphic position of several {{levels of the}} Silurian-Devonian succession of Bolivia, {{with respect to the}} International Time Scale, additional Silurian and Devonian localities belonging to the Eastern Cordillera and the Interandean Zone areas have been recently revised and sampled, both for macrofossils and palynomorphs. Specifically, the localities are Nunumayani, and Muruhuta from the late Silurian-early Devonian time interval. Correlations with other fossiliferous localities are discussed, namely Huacallani and Rumicorral. A new outcrop yielding Middle Devonian tabulate corals at Pisacavina is described; its faunal content is described, and compared with the historical coral collection. As a result, it appears clearly that the Silurian-Devonian Bolivian fauna needs a thorough revision, as well as the selection of stratigraphically significant macrofossils. Besides macrofossils, the analysis of palynomorph assemblages is significant in establishment of both intra-Bolivian and international correlations before any reliable biogeographic reconstruction is done. This paper records the first discovery of a plant of the genus Protolepidodendron from the Devonian of Bolivia.

40|$|The fossils studied {{came from}} {{outcrops}} of the Maecuru and Curuá rivers, State of Pará, {{belonging to the}} upper strata of theMaecuru Formation, <b>Eifelian</b> <b>age.</b> In this formation, two associations of marine benthic invertebrate can be identified, each inferring adistinct paleoenvironment. The association analyzed occurs in medium and coarse sandstones and shows “Schuchertella” agassizi andPtychopeteria eschwegei as predominant organisms. It was idnetified 12 species of brachiopods, 20 species of bivalves, 12 of trilobites, 8 of gastropods, 6 of bellerophonts, 3 of crinoids and 3 of tentaculitids in this association. Brachiopods are the most abundant organisms,responsible for approximately 50 % of it, followed by tentaculitids and bivalves. Trilobites, gastropods and bellerophonts sum less than 10 % of the aforementioned association. Crinoids {{were not included in}} the quantitative analysis because they are only found as calicinalplates and disarticulated column disks. The brachiopods showed, through their morphofunctional characteristics, suspension feedersrecumbent (free-lying) epifaunal life habit or a pedicle attached mode of life. The bivalves showed a predominant suspension feeder semiinfaunalhabit, attached by byssus threads to the substratum, and an infaunal mode of life. All the trilobites showed a predator/scavengerand vagile epifaunal habit. The epifaunal platyceratids represents the gastropods with low mobility (coprophagous/suspension feeders). The bellerophonts showed an epifaunal highly/medium mobility and grazing/predator habit. The tentaculitids having a semi-infaunal,suspension feeder habit. The suspension feeder forms (brachiopods, bivalves and tentaculitids) account for over 90 % of the organisms, withthe remaining percentage distributed among the predator/scavenger (trilobites), coprophagous/suspension feeders (gastropods), grazers/predators (bellerophonts) and deposit feeders (rare bivalves). The predominance of suspension feeder forms corroborates the environmentinferred for the association, since suspension feeders adapt more easily to rough waters and coarse sediments. The life habits showedadaptations concerning a shallow marine environment with agitated waters, well-oxygenated, normal salinity and moderate temperature...|$|E
40|$|Scolecodonts (polychaete jaws) {{are common}} and diverse microfossils in {{many types of}} Palaeozoic marine sediments. They bring useful {{information}} on phylogeny of polychaete annelids {{and can be used}} as palaeoenvironmental indicators, and to a lesser degree in biostratigraphy. The number of studies on Devonian scolecodonts is, however, rather limited and in most cases single-element-based classification (parataxonomy) has been used. Here we report a well preserved assemblage of scolecodonts from the type Eifel area, Germany. The studied section lies within the Blankenheim syncline, between the villages of Blankenheim and Blankenheimerdorf. It comprises shallow shelf mixed carbonate and siliciclastic deposits of <b>Eifelian</b> <b>age</b> (kockelianus and ensensis conodont Biozones, beginning of the Kačák Event Interval) that were accumulated in near shore settings on the southern margin of the former Avalonia microcontinent. The family-level composition of the recovered Eifelian polychaete fauna is generally similar to the Silurian associations known from Baltica, Laurentia and Perunica, predominated by polychaetaspids, particularly of the genus Oenonites, mochtyellids (Mochtyella) and paulinitids (Kettnerites). However, characteristic of the Eifelian fauna is the occurrence of kielanoprionids (Kielanoprion), a family that is unknown from the pre-Devonian. In the studied samples kielanoprionids reach up to 20 % of the assemblage. Representatives of atraktoprionids, skalenoprionids and tetraprionids are much less common. Comparison with contemporaneous polychaete faunas from other regions is complicated due to limited number of studies. However, the Eifelian assemblage seems to be very similar to those described previously from the Middle Devonian of North America and Upper Devonian of Poland. This suggests that many Devonian polychaetes were both long-ranging and geographically widespread. Good preservation of specimens at hand brings also new information on poorly known jawed polychaete taxa and helps to elucidate some aspects of the phylogeny of the group.

40|$|Three {{members are}} informally {{distinguished}} in this formation (A, B, and C from base to top). They are {{present at the}} western part of the outcrop (thickness ca. 246 m). On the eastern and southeastern part, only member A and basal part of member B are present and the thickness is reduced to ca. 20 m. A sharp surface of discontinuity separates member A from member B. The Portilla Formation abounds in reef-building elements associated with other groups. Five major carbonate facies types are established that belong to a complex biostromal ‘reef’ facies. Vertical and lateral facies changes are demonstrated. The carbonate facies was deposited in a shallow-marine environment. Towards end of deposition of member A, sharp changes in depositional conditions occurred, soon followed by a notable influx of siliciclastics. A distinctive barrier ‘reef’ pattern was established during deposition of member B. It protected a back-reef area from the open shallow sea. This back-reef environment was separated from an area of dominantly siliciclastic deposition in the southeast by an extremely shallow marine or shoal area which might have been emergent. During deposition of member B there occurred a rhythmic alternation of the back-reef carbonates and the carbonates continuous with the ‘reef’ barrier, probably reflecting minor changes in sea level likely due to epeirogenetic movements of the bottom. Eventually organic growth and associated carbonate sedimentation exceeded the rate of subsidence and as a result the ‘reefs’ laterally shifted seawards, followed by the back-reef facies. The facies pattern suggests an increasingly emergent tendency of the marginal part of the carbonate basin due to bottom movements. The barrier ‘reef’ pattern of member B probably terminated due to changes in relative subsidence during deposition of member C. A strong supply of siliciclastics during the deposition of the Nocedo Formation brought an end to the carbonate sedimentation of the Portilla Formation. The variation in thickness in the Portilla Formation has been mainly due to a slow and prolonged differential subsidence of the carbonate depositional basin. The absence of a large part of member B and member C in the easterly and southeasterly directions is probably largely due to non-deposition of sediments. Seventeen species are described of rhynchonellid brachiopods, out of which four species are new. Three new genera are established. Wherever available some critical German rhynchonellid species have been sectioned for comparison. The rhynchonellid and atrypid brachiopod fauna from the Portilla Formation show a great affinity with the Middle Devonian fauna of Eifel region, Germany. The Spanish fauna could be assigned to the mixed or Eifel facies, or close to this type. Striking similarity exists also between the Spanish fauna and the Middle Devonian fauna from the Holy Cross Mountains, Poland. The rhynchonellids and atrypids strongly suggest that the Eifelian — Givetian boundary lies in the basal part of member B. It is suggested that member A is of <b>Eifelian</b> <b>age</b> and that members B and C, apart from the basal part of member B are of Givetian age...|$|E
