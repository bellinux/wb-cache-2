5|$|Chelation challenge, {{also known}} as {{provocation}} testing, is used to indicate an elevated and mobilizable body burden of heavy metals including lead. This testing involves collecting urine before and after administering a one-off dose of chelating agent to mobilize heavy metals into the urine. Then urine is analyzed by a laboratory for levels of heavy metals; from this analysis overall body burden is inferred. Chelation challenge mainly measures the burden of lead in soft tissues, though whether it accurately reflects long-term exposure or the amount of lead stored in bone remains controversial. Although the technique {{has been used to}} determine whether chelation therapy is indicated and to <b>diagnose</b> heavy metal exposure, some evidence does not support these uses as blood levels after chelation are not comparable to the reference range typically used to <b>diagnose</b> heavy metal poisoning. The single chelation dose could also redistribute the heavy metals to more sensitive areas such as central nervous system tissue.|$|E

This study’s aim was to identify the causes and characteristics of uncoded <b>diagnoses.</b> Methods: Uncoded <b>diagnoses</b> from computerized HICs (outpatient, inpatient, and the diagnosis procedure-combination per-diem payment system [DPC/PDPS]) submitted to the National Health Insurance Organization of Kumamoto Prefecture in May 2010 were analyzed. The text documentation accompanying the uncoded <b>diagnoses</b> was used to classify <b>diagnoses</b> in accordance with the International Classification of Diseases- 10 (ICD- 10). The text documentation was also classified into four categories using the standard descriptions of <b>diagnoses</b> defined in the master files of the computerized HIC system: 1) standard descriptions of <b>diagnoses,</b> 2) standard descriptions with a modifier, 3) non-standard descriptions of <b>diagnoses,</b> and 4) unclassifiable text documentation. Using these classifications, the proportions of uncoded <b>diagnoses</b> by ICD- 10 disease category were calculated. Results: Of the uncoded <b>diagnoses</b> analyzed (n = 363 753), non-standard descriptions of <b>diagnoses</b> for outpatient, inpatient, and DPC/PDPS HICs comprised 12. 1 %, 14. 6 %, and 1. 0 % of uncoded <b>diagnoses,</b> respectively.

40|$|In fault {{detection}} and isolation, diagnostic test results {{are commonly used}} to compute a set of <b>diagnoses,</b> where each diagnosis points at a set of components which might behave abnormally. In distributed systems consisting of multiple control units, the test results in each unit {{can be used to}} compute local <b>diagnoses</b> while all test results in the complete system give the global <b>diagnoses.</b> It is an advantage for both repair and fault-tolerant control to have access to the global <b>diagnoses</b> in each unit since these <b>diagnoses</b> represent all test results in all units. However, when the <b>diagnoses,</b> for example, are to be used to repair a unit, only the components that are used by the unit are of interest. The {{reason for this is that}} it is only these components that could have caused the abnormal behavior. However, the global <b>diagnoses</b> might include components from the complete system and therefore often include components that are superfluous for the unit. Motivated by this observation, a new type of diagnosis is proposed, namely, the condensed diagnosis. Each unit has a unique set of condensed <b>diagnoses</b> which represents the global <b>diagnoses.</b> The benefit of the condensed <b>diagnoses</b> is that they only include components used by the unit while still representing the global <b>diagnoses.</b> The proposed method is applied to an automotive vehicle, and the results from the application study show the benefit of using condensed <b>diagnoses</b> compared to global <b>diagnoses.</b> Funding Agencies|Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research||Scania CV AB|...|$|R
