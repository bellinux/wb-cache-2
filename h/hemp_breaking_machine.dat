40|$|Eleven {{percent of}} the eggs {{produced}} in the U. S. go to egg breaking plants to produce more than 800 million pounds of various liquid egg products annually. This {{study was conducted to}} determine the wastewater problems of thfs industry, the potential for reduction of wastewaters by in-plant management methods, and the treatability of the effluents. This report is divided into three sections- industry re-view, waste characterization and in-plant control, and treatability. Five egg breaking plants were sampled which covered a size ranging from small installations (one egg <b>breaking</b> <b>machine)</b> to one of the largest (twelve <b>breaking</b> <b>machines).</b> Three facilities were extensively sampled before and after in-plant management methods were adopted to determine the effectiveness of source control of wastes.

50|$|Jacques Morali's {{music was}} {{characterized}} by simple arrangements, a unique sense of camp and simple catchy melodies that could easily be remembered. Between 1974 and 1982, he recorded over 65 albums. He co-wrote songs for many artists including Patrick Juvet, Régine, Dalida, Eric Russell, Cher, Patricia Norton, Julius Brown, Starlight, Diva, Dennis Parker, David London, Wayne Scott, Lova Moor and Pia Zadora. After the post-1970s disco backlash, little was heard from Morali until his 1983 production work with <b>Break</b> <b>Machine</b> and 1984's Eartha Kitt album, I Love Men.|$|R

50|$|The Polish {{military}} realized {{early on}} that machine enciphering would change the science of cryptology and from 1929 employed mathematicians to work on cryptanalysis. However, as the goal of Japanese-Polish cryptographic cooperation was to train the Japanese side to break Russian codes, {{there would have been}} no need for the Polish cryptologists to reveal methods of <b>breaking</b> <b>machines</b> the Russians were not using. Teaching the Japanese the latest and greatest methods would not be of any use against Russian codes and would only risk the Germans finding out and changing their codes. The Poles thus had a strong incentive to teach the Japanese just as much as they needed to know.|$|R
5000|$|In 1967, Henson {{used the}} [...] "Wheel-Stealer" [...] puppet for an IBM {{training}} film called Coffee <b>Break</b> <b>Machine.</b> In the sketch, called [...] "The Computer Dinner", the monster (with frightening eyes and fangs) devours a complex coffee making machine as it describes its different parts. When he is finished, the machine announces the monster has activated the machines anti-vandalism system, which contains {{the most powerful}} explosives known to man. The monster promptly explodes. This sketch was also performed in October, 1967 on The Ed Sullivan Show. It was also later performed on the George Burns episode of The Muppet Show using the Luncheon Counter Monster.|$|R
5000|$|The 885 {{is a small}} {{thyratron}} tube, using xenon gas. This {{device was}} used extensively in the timebase circuits of early oscilloscopes in the 1930s. It was employed in a circuit called a relaxation oscillator. During World War II, small thyratrons similar to the 885 were utilized in pairs to construct bistables, the [...] "memory" [...] cells used by early computers and code <b>breaking</b> <b>machines.</b> Thyratrons were also used for phase angle control of alternating current (AC) power sources in battery chargers and light dimmers, but these were usually of a larger current handling capacity than the 885. The 885 is a 2.5 volt, 5-pin based variant of the 884/6Q5.|$|R
40|$|Conversion {{of cocoa}} beans to {{chocolate}} product is, therefore, {{one of the}} promising alternatives to increase the value added of dried cocoa beans. On the other hand, the development of chocolate industry requires an appropriate technology that is not available yet for small or medium scale of business. Breaking and deshelling cocoa roasted beans is one important steps in cocoa processing to ascertain good chocolate quality. The aim {{of this research is}} to study performance of rotary cutter type <b>breaking</b> <b>machine</b> for <b>breaking</b> and deshelling cocoa roasted beans. Indonesian Coffee and Cocoa Research Institute has designed and tested a rotary cutter type <b>breaking</b> <b>machine</b> for <b>breaking</b> and deshelling cocoa roasted beans. Breaker unit has rotated by ½ HP power, single phase, 110 / 220 V and 1440 rpm. Transmission system that use for rotating breaker unit is pulley and single V belt.

50|$|Inevitably {{the bosses}} {{of the plant}} {{and some of its}} workers were caught up in the purges of the later 1930s. These {{included}} the party agitator Boris Bibikov who was shot as a Trotskyite but who its seems had sympathised with Kirov. Part of his story is told by his grandson, Owen Matthews, in an English language family memoir. Amongst the accusations made in these cases were various forms of sabotage in the plant including <b>breaking</b> <b>machines,</b> delaying the payment of wages etc. To the extent that these were genuine problems it seems likely that they were actually explained by the inexperience of quickly trained workers using expensive machinery and the various bureaucratic hiccups of the day.|$|R

40|$|One of the {{problems}} of real-life production scheduling is dynamics of manufacturing environments with new production demands and <b>breaking</b> <b>machines</b> during the schedule execution. Simple rescheduling from scratch in response to unexpected events occurring on the shop floor may require excessive computation time. Moreover, the recovered schedule may be prohibitively deviated from the ongoing schedule. This thesis reviews existing approaches in the field of dynamic scheduling and proposes techniques how to modify a schedule to accommodate disturbances such as resource failure, hot order arrival or order cancellation. The importance is put on the speed of suggested procedures as well as on a minimum modification from the original schedule. The scheduling model is motivated by the FlowOpt project, which is based on the Temporal Networks with Alternatives. The algorithms are written in the C# language...|$|R
