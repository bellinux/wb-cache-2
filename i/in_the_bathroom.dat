40|$|Background: The {{most common}} oral hygiene aid {{used to improve}} the oral health of an {{individual}} is toothbrush and it is often neglected to maintain in a proper aseptic condition, which could probably result in contamination by various micro-organisms. Aims: 1) To assess the microbial contamination of the hard deposit on the toothbrush head, between the bristle tufts, after 1 and 3 months of use. 2) To assess the microbial contamination of the hard deposit on the toothbrush head, between the bristle tufts, which were kept <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathrooms</b> with and without attached toilet. Setting and Design: An in vitro study. Materials and Methods: Twenty toothbrushes kept <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathrooms</b> with an attached toilet and 20 toothbrushes kept <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathrooms</b> without an attached toilet were collected from the participants, making it a total of 40. Among these 20 toothbrushes in each group, 10 were used for 1 month duration and 10 were used for 3 months duration. Results: Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas, Lactobacillus, Klebsiella, Candida species were isolated in 1 month and 3 months used toothbrushes kept <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathrooms</b> without attached toilet. Escherichia coli was found in 3 months used toothbrushes kept <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathrooms</b> with attached toilet. Micro-organisms were found in isolated form in toothbrushes used for 1 month, whereas in toothbrushes used for 3 months they are found in clumps. Conclusion: Hard deposit on the toothbrush head between bristle tufts is a nidus for growth of micro-organisms, which not only affects the oral health but also affects the general health of an individual...|$|R
