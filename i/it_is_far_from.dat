5|$|The castle's {{location}} was ostensibly chosen to protect England's south coast from raids by the French.

5|$|Literature {{academic}} Jayne Ashleigh Glover {{says that}} while Zone Three on the surface {{appears to be a}} feminist utopia, Lessing shows that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> idyllic. The story narrators, the Chroniclers of Zone Three, question their zone's behaviour and attitudes, and warn of the dangers of stagnation. Al•Ith, upon returning to Zone Three, is shunned by its inhabitants for failing to attend to their zone's needs, and Zone Three's stasis manifests itself in xenophobia when Al•Ith brings back new perspectives, followed by visitors from Zone Four.|$|E
5|$|The {{weakening}} of royal authority {{may also have}} resulted in the conquest of much of southern Italy by the Lombards, in which modern scholars believe Alboin played no role at all, probably taking place in 570 or 571 under the auspices of individual warlords. However <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> certain that the Lombard takeover occurred during those years, as very little is known of Faroald and Zotto's respective rise to power in Spoletium (Spoleto) and Beneventum (Benevento).|$|E

25|$|If {{we want to}} fix {{the value}} of n prior to the {{experiment}} {{then we have to}} take the balls one by one until we have n balls. The balls are therefore no longer independent.

See the entry for noncentral hypergeometric distributions for an explanation of the difference between these two distributions and a discussion of which distribution to use in various situations.|$|E

25|$|Loop quantum {{gravity is}} {{formulated}} in a background-independent language. No spacetime is assumed a priori, but {{rather it is}} built up by the states of theory themselves – however scattering amplitudes are derived from -point functions (Correlation function (quantum field theory)) and these, formulated in conventional quantum field theory, are functions of points of a background space-time. The relation between the background-independent formalism and the conventional formalism of quantum field theory on a given spacetime is far from obvious, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> obvious how to recover low-energy quantities from the full background-independent theory. One would like to derive the -point functions of the theory from the background-independent formalism, in order to compare them with the standard perturbative expansion of quantum general relativity and therefore check that loop quantum gravity yields the correct low-energy limit.|$|E

500|$|The Orkneyinga Saga {{says that}} a dispute between Thorfinn Sigurdsson, Earl of Orkney, and Karl Hundason began when Karl Hundason became [...] "King of Scots" [...] and claimed Caithness. The {{identity}} of Karl Hundason, unknown to Scots and Irish sources, {{has long been a}} matter of dispute, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> clear that the matter is settled. The most common assumption is that Karl Hundason was an insulting byname (Old Norse for [...] "Churl, son of a Dog") given to Macbeth by his enemies. William Forbes Skene's suggestion that he was Duncan I of Scotland has been revived in recent years. Lastly, the idea that the whole affair is a poetic invention has been raised.|$|E
500|$|It has {{traditionally}} been supposed that King Owen the Bald of Strathclyde died at the Battle of Carham and that the kingdom passed {{into the hands of}} the Scots afterwards. This rests on some very weak evidence. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> certain that Owen died at Carham, and it is reasonably certain that there were kings of Strathclyde as late as 1054, when Edward the Confessor sent Earl Siward to install [...] "Malcolm son of the king of the Cumbrians". The confusion is old, probably inspired by William of Malmesbury and embellished by John of Fordun, but there is no firm evidence that the kingdom of Strathclyde was a part of the kingdom of the Scots, rather than a loosely subjected kingdom, before the time of Malcolm II of Scotland's great-grandson Malcolm Canmore.|$|E

She summarised, [...] "The smile and laughter will not leave you while it still manage to moisten your eyes here and there". Sandhya Rao of Sify stated, [...] "Manam`s story is something new within Telugu films context, but the way the film showcases romance and emotion, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> a regular fare.

500|$|Sati, the {{practice}} where a widow would immolate herself with her dead husband's body, is evidenced in Vijayanagara ruins. About fifty inscriptions {{have been discovered}} in Vijayanagara which are called Satikal (Sati stone) or Sati-virakal (Sati hero stone). According to Ashis Nandy, the Vijayanagara practice {{was an example of}} an [...] "epidemic" [...] of sati practice just like Rajput kingdoms under attack by Mughal armies, attributing {{the practice}} to foreign intrusions from the persistent wars between Muslim sultanates and the Hindu kingdom, in contrast to others who question the evidence. According to scholars such as John Hawley, [...] "the evidence about the extent of the custom and about the classes that practiced <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> clear, since most accounts come from Muslim chroniclers or European travelers" [...] who did not have means and objectivity to report about the practice or its circumstances accurately.|$|E

Veeyen of Nowrunning.com gave the film 2 out of 5 stars and wrote [...] "Loham has none of the shine or shimmer that was expected of it. At best it looks like an antique bronze piece that has taken some fine patina all over it", but he praised Mohanlal and Siddique's performances. Parech C. Palicha of Rediff.com commented, [...] "Loham lacks lustre, and is not original at all". Sify praised the performance of Mohanlal and the humour of Siddique and Soubin Saheer but criticized the script, saying, [...] "Loham is about a topical subject, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> engaging". Raj Vikram of Metromatinee said that technically the film is slick with well shot sequences.
