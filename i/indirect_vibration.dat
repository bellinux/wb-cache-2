40|$|The {{effects of}} {{ultrasonic}} vibration (UV) treatment on microstructure of semi-solid aluminum alloys {{and the application}} of UV in rheocasting process are reviewed. Good semi-solid slurry can be produced by high-intensity UV process for aluminum alloys. The microstructures of Al-Si, Al-Mg and Al-Cu alloys produced by rheocasting assisted with UV are compact and with fine grains. The mechanical properties of the UV treated alloys are increased by about 20 %- 30 %. Grain refinement of the alloys is generally considered because of cavitation and acoustic streaming caused by UV. Apart from these mechanisms, a hypothesis of the fuse of dendrite root caused by capillary infiltration in the ultrasonic field, as well as a mechanism of crystallites falling off from the mould-wall and crystal multiplication by mechanical <b>vibration</b> effect in <b>indirect</b> ultrasonic <b>vibration</b> are proposed to explain the microstructure evolution of the alloys...|$|R
40|$|Available from: [URL] a {{wide variety}} of {{industrial}} applications, an increasing demand exists to improve the reliability and availability of induction motor drives. Common failures occurring in such drives can be classified into electrical and mechanical faults (rotor eccentricity, bearing faults, shaft misalignment, load unbalance, gearbox fault or general failure in the load part of the drive). Mechanical faults are most commonly detected through vibration or noise monitoring, but stator current monitoring is an interesting alternative. Indeed, current sensors are cost-effective, easy to implement, and most drives already contain such sensors for protection and control purposes. However, the effects of mechanical faults on the stator currents are more <b>indirect</b> compared to <b>vibration</b> or noise analysis. This work focuses on various aspects of mechanical fault detection through stator current monitoring, starting from a general theoretical analysis to signal processing methods for fault detection and several application examples...|$|R
40|$|The {{main idea}} of this thesis is to {{investigate}} the literature about the models that were developed to link the physical degradation with <b>indirect</b> measures like <b>vibration.</b> Wear is the chosen degradation mechanism for the project. Fast Fourier Transformation and Wavelet Transformation {{seem to be the}} most promising techniques {{in order to deal with}} the objective of finding the models. After a sufficient amount of literature review, it appears that no one has actually developed a physical degradation model based on vibration signals. There are a lot of papers discussing Fast Fourier Transform and Wavelet Transform to assess the fault diagnostics but they all lack in developing any physical model that can link the physical degradation with vibration signals. The other possibility is to set up a laboratory to develop the understanding of vibration signals based on conducting experimental analysis but it is beyond the scope of this project. Taking the above into consideration, and due to experimental limitations, further objectives which depend upon the main idea have been changed accordingly. In order to deal with wear, Arhcard‘s wear law has been used extensively. But as far as wear in gearbox of offshore wind turbine is concerned, not much work has been done in relating Archard‘s wear law to the wear propagating in the gears. Due to the simplicity of Archard‘s wear law, it has been chosen to develop a wear model for gears of offshore wind turbine. Consequently, the wind load study has been performed in order to see the effect of wind load on the wear in a gearbox, because in offshore the wind load is comparatively larger as compared to onshore. The offshore wind has both the temporal and the spatial variation with the stochastic nature therefore modelling the wind speed is not an easy task. An attempt has been made to model wind speed based on the data obtained from National Data Buoy Center. The Archard‘s wear model has been analysed based upon the developed wind model to see the behaviour of wear in gears. Uncertainties such as epistemic and aleatory present in both, wind model and wear prediction model, have been discussed. Finally, maintenance strategies have been developed by applying Monte Carlo simulation to the proposed wear prediction model for gears. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: The apexification is {{the first}} {{alternative}} treatment on a permanent tooth when, after a tooth trauma and {{in the presence of}} immature apex trauma, pulp necrosis occurs. Many studies have demonstrated the efficacy of mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) as apical sealing material of choice in these cases, but has a degree of filtration as all other materials. The objective {{of this study was to}} analyze the seal ability of MTA on the duct walls in immature teeth unirradicular apexes, using <b>indirect</b> <b>vibration.</b> Material and Methods: The study was conducted on 45 teeth divided into 3 groups: Group A or control group in which no vibration for placing the MTA was used, Group B and C or groups where <b>indirect</b> <b>vibration</b> analysis was used. All samples were immersed in methylene blue to assess filtration. After performing longitudinal cuts millimetric measuring were made of the degree of filtration, divided into 3 degrees (2 mm each grade filtration). Results: Results obtained confirm our hypothesis, obtaining lesser degree of filtration those groups in which <b>indirect</b> <b>vibration</b> (Groups B and C) was performed. It was shown that the degree of filtration is closely linked to the degree of adaptation. Conclusions: MTA vibration offers better results in its adaptation to the canal walls, significantly reducing the degree of filtration...|$|E
40|$|There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} to suggest that acute <b>indirect</b> <b>vibration</b> acts on muscle to enhance force, power, flexibility, balance and proprioception suggesting neural enhancement. Nevertheless, the neural mechanism(s) of vibration and its potentiating effect have received little attention. One proposal suggests that spinal reflexes enhance muscle contraction through a reflex activity known as tonic vibration stretch reflex (TVR), which increases muscle activation. However, TVR is based on direct, brief, and high frequency vibration (> 100 Hz) which differs to <b>indirect</b> <b>vibration,</b> which is applied to the whole body or body parts at lower vibration frequency (5 - 45 Hz). Likewise, muscle tuning and neuromuscular aspects are other candidate mechanisms used to explain the vibration phenomenon. But there is much debate in terms of identifying which neural mechanism(s) are responsible for acute vibration; due to a number of studies using various vibration testing protocols. These protocols include: different methods of application, vibration variables, training duration, exercise types and a range of population groups. Therefore, the neural mechanism of acute vibration remain equivocal, but spinal reflexes, muscle tuning and neuromuscular aspects are all viable factors that may contribute in different ways to increasing muscular performance. Additional research is encouraged to determine which neural mechanism(s) and their contributions are responsible for acute vibration. Testing variables and vibration applications need to be standardised before reaching a consensus on which neural mechanism(s) occur during and post-vibratio...|$|E
40|$|The Nature Conservancy and the Conservation Biology Institute {{conducted}} {{an analysis of}} the potential environmental impacts of the proposed California High Speed Rail project as detailed in the 2004 Draft Programmatic Environmental Impact Report. The analysis intended to match the scale of the programmatic EIR in order to inform comments and to create a synoptic view of the project with select focal examples of potential impact areas for non-governmental organization partners and funders. An initial, more thorough, analysis covered areas outside of the Bay Area alignments. The question of choosing the high speed rail modal alternative versus the increased highways and airports or no action alternatives was not addressed. The analysis utilized GIS and was based on high speed rail alignment data, including information on structure (bridge, tunnel, trench) and spatial alignment relative to right of ways (in, adjacent, new). For each geographical region and subset, proposed options were analyzed in terms of their ecological impacts. Data layers used were: public land and private conservation land (2003), wetlands and vernal pools, The Nature Conservancy portfolio conservation areas, the California Natural Diversity Database, potential wilderness, and potential wildlife linkages. Impacts from construction as well as operations and maintenance were included. Direct impacts include removal of vegetation, wildlife mortality, water pollution, noise, light, and <b>vibration.</b> <b>Indirect</b> impacts include changes in surface and groundwater flow, wildlife behavior and movement, potential changes to disturbance, invasion of exotics, growth inducement, and potential benefits associated with restoration opportunities. An example of the analysis results is displayed, detailing the scope and specificity of the report output. The results indicate that special areas for concern are: habitat fragmentation for wide-ranging species in the southern Sierra Nevada and Transverse Ranges; Orange and San Diego counties in terms of threatened and endangered species, lagoons, interior stream habitats, and wildlife linkages; wetlands and vernal pools in the Central Valley; and the Western Mojave Desert in terms of growth inducement and impacts to groundwater. The EIR did not provide sufficient information to make a decision on preferred routes. Although a system-wide assessment is the time to consider range-wide effects on ecosystems and species, the programmatic EIR deferred many analyses to project-level review, which is constrained to a specific geography {{to such a degree that}} many issues would be ignored. In order to take advantage of the opportunity to restore connectivity with the high speed rail project, it is recommended that wildlife crossing structures should be: located along natural travel routes, with suitable habitat and topography for target species; designed to accommodate different taxonomic groups; located every 1. 5 to 2 kilometers; aligned with crossing structures on Interstates and highways; integrated with sound walls to reduce the adverse affects of noise, vibration, and light on wildlife movement; and integrated with fencing where beneficial to guide animals toward crossing structures. The overall analysis suggests that there are several thematic areas in need of further consideration at broad scales. Opportunities exist to restore movement barriers, and these options should be further explored. Overall, the EIR/S inadequately analyzed major environmental impacts including noise, light, invasive species management, and wildlife linkages and potential to restore connectivity. The authors conclude that interagency collaboration between the High Speed Rail Authority, transportation agencies, and land management agencies (USFS, BLM, State Parks), and the development of a long-term coordinated plan will improve the project ecologically...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{demands from}} governments {{on the engine}} manufactures to lower the fuel consumption, lower the exhaust emissions and to reduce the noise have lead to an intensive research in the combustion process. Measurement of the combustion process inside the cylinder is only suitable in laboratory environment due {{to a number of}} limitations; the pressure transducer needed to measure the pressure is expensive, difficult to mount in the cylinder and has a limited lifetime that is much shorter than the engine's lifetime. Demands of on-board diagnostics where the combustion process is continuously monitored, on production vehicles have created a need for a method to indirectly measure the combustion process. The two main <b>indirect</b> methods are <b>vibration</b> measurement based reconstruction and crankshaft angular speed measurement reconstruction. The combustion process give rise to vibrations in the engine body that in the former method is measured with an accelerometer and the pressure can be reconstructed by using inverted transfer functions. The idea behind the latter method, the crankshaft angular speed reconstruction method, is that when one cylinder fires the produced torque is higher than the load torque and the crankshaft accelerates. As next cylinder goes into compression the total load torque increases and the crankshaft speed will decrease. This is repeated when the next cylinder fires and the produced crankshaft speed fluctuations will then contain information about the combustion and compression that caused it. In this thesis an indirect method to predict the maximum cylinder pressure is developed based on the crankshaft speed fluctuations combined with neural networks. The speed fluctuations were measured on a 6 -cylinder inline diesel engine at 9 speed-load-combinations. A two layer (one hidden and one output layer) feedforward neural network was trained with the backpropagation algorithm. The prediction accuracy for pmax was found to be better than ± 5 % at 95 %-confidence interval for the validation set. Another important parameter for the engine control and for optimising the fuel efficiency {{at the same time as}} the exhaust emissions are kept to a minimum, is the position of the pistons most upper position, TDC (top dead centre). The TDC position is normally measured mechanically with means that need access to the cylinders (the cylinder head has to be removed). This method is time consuming and therefore expensive and because of that not used on production engines. Several indirect methods to measure the TDC- positions have been suggested. Either based on measured cylinder pressures, that again need a pressure transducer mounted in the cylinder, or on the crankshaft speed fluctuations. An indirect method based on the speed fluctuations, that are measured when the starter motor rotates the engine with turned off ignition, is developed. From the measured crankshaft speed fluctuations the TDC-positions can be determined either by curve fitting or with neural networks. The TDC position determined by curve fitting has a bias error, due to the out-of-phase acceleration component in the crankshaft that are induced by the starter motor, but also caused by heat exchange between the compressed gas and the cylinder walls and gas. The results from the neural network were found to be better and the TDC-position for all 6 cylinders was determined within ± 0. 1 degree crank angle at 95 %-confidence interval.
