40|$|Among the {{different}} socioeconomic impacts resulting from an oil spill, non-commercial effects represent an important share, {{especially when the}} disaster happens on a highly populated area. The Amoco Cadiz case, which offers {{a good example of}} a comprehensive economic damage assessment, demonstrates that fact. Nevertheless non-commercial losses, such as recreation and amenity losses are rarely estimated. Concerning damage caused by the Erika wrecking, this type of damage did concerned a quite short period of time but a highly populated shoreline close to an urbanized area, those of Nantes. For the residents, the lost of amenity is a major component of the whole damage. Residents were disturbed by the accident, through their leisure activities, mainly <b>fishing</b> <b>on</b> <b>foot,</b> a very popular activity on this coastline. Two surveys of the coastal inhabitants affected by the pollution and the inhabitants of Nantes are used to evaluate the oil spill effects on <b>fishing</b> <b>on</b> <b>foot</b> in the six months following the shipwreck. The majority of interviewees gave up this activity. In threequarters of the cases, other outdoor recreational activities, especially hiking, replace...|$|E

50|$|In 1793 the {{fishermen}} in Mullion Cove applied to Lanhydrock {{for permission to}} develop the cove as an inshore seine fishery, and by 1805 much of the pilchard catch was taken by boat to Penzance and Newlyn to be cured. In 1806 a total of 7000 hogsheads of pilchards were recorded taken from Mullion. It is likely that by this time several fish cellars had been built in Cove, putting the <b>fishing</b> <b>on</b> an economic <b>footing.</b> It {{should be noted that}} at that time the fishing had as much connection with Predannack as it did with Mullion, and it was hoped that the new industry would encourage occupation and building at Predannack.
