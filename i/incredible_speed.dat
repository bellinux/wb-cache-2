25|$|His {{technique}} is awesome! Even today, nobody has really {{come to the}} state that he was playing at. As good as players are, they haven’t gotten to where he is. There's {{a lot of guys}} that play fast and a lot of guys that play clean, and the guitar {{has come a long way}} as far as speed and clarity go, but nobody plays with the whole fullness of expression that Django has. I mean, the combination of <b>incredible</b> <b>speed</b> – all the speed you could possibly want – but also the thing of every note have a specific personality. You don’t hear it. I really haven’t heard it anywhere but with Django.|$|E
25|$|Superhuman Strength: In human form, Michael is able {{to fully}} stop a truck that had just {{initiated}} its brakes, can break steel chains and rip a first aid kit box from a wall. When changed to his Hybrid form, Michael's strength increases significantly. He holds his ground against Viktor, a centuries-old Vampire Elder, in physical combat immediately following the transformation, taking the Elder by surprise with his <b>incredible</b> <b>speed</b> and strength before ultimately falling prey to Viktor's much greater combat experience and superior battle technique. Although Michael {{is one of the}} most physically powerful beings of the series, his lack of combat experience tends to put him at a disadvantage when facing particularly experienced combatants, though his raw strength, speed and rage is often enough to compensate for this when facing the average Vampire or Lycan; Viktor is the only non-Hybrid being that Michael couldn't defeat due to Viktor's vast combat experience as an Elder Vampire. He can also punch through a Werewolf's chest with ease. His strength is so great that he {{is able to}} kill William, the first Werewolf in existence (who had been weakened by centuries without sustenance), by tearing his head in half with his bare hands, despite having recently recovered from being impaled by Markus. He also holds his own against another Hybrid, Markus, despite the latter's status as the eldest of the Vampires.|$|E
500|$|Although orchestral players resented Sargent {{for much}} of his career after the 1936 interview, {{instrumental}} soloists generally liked working with him. The cellist Pierre Fournier called him a [...] "guardian angel" [...] and compared him favourably with George Szell and Herbert von Karajan. Artur Schnabel, Jascha Heifetz and Yehudi Menuhin thought similarly highly of him. Cyril Smith wrote in his autobiography, [...] "...he seems to sense what the pianist wants of the music even before he begins to play it.... He has an <b>incredible</b> <b>speed</b> of mind, and it has always been a great joy, as well as a rare professional experience, to work with him." [...] For this reason, among others, Sargent was continually in demand as a conductor for concertos.|$|E
5000|$|The {{mid-19th century}} saw the {{explosion}} of the [...] "pelota craze". The player [...] "Gantxiki" [...] is considered the original [...] "father" [...] of the chistera, the basket-shaped racquet which can propel the ball at <b>incredible</b> <b>speeds,</b> introduced around 1850.|$|R
50|$|Sabbac has super human strength, agility and endurance. He {{is able to}} fly at <b>incredible</b> <b>speeds</b> {{and project}} fire from his mouth and hands. He is now several stories high. He gets this by saying Sabbac, and turns back in the same way.|$|R
50|$|MyControl Speedway {{differs from}} other race tracks in Second Life as it hosts races with no entry limits on cars. This is {{referred}} to as 'open-formula' racing and allows competitors to create a car that is capable of racing at <b>incredible</b> <b>speeds,</b> unlike in the limited entry races elsewhere.|$|R
500|$|Khalid's elite light cavalry, the Mobile guard, {{acted as}} {{the core of the}} Muslim cavalry during the {{invasion}} of Syria. It was composed of highly trained and seasoned soldiers, the majority of whom had been under Khalid's standard during his Arabian and Persian campaigns. Muslim cavalry was a light cavalry force armed with 5 meter long lances. They could charge at an <b>incredible</b> <b>speed</b> and would usually employ a common tactic of Kar wa far literary meaning [...] "engage-disengage", or in modern term: “hit-and-run.” They would charge on enemy flanks and rear, their maneuverability making them very effective against heavily armored Byzantine and Sassanid cataphracts. Khalid's famous flanking charge {{on the final day of}} the Battle of Yarmouk stands as testimony to just how well he understood the potentials and strengths of his mounted troops.|$|E
2500|$|As the Roman baggage train {{came into}} view, the Belgic force {{suddenly}} rushed {{out of the}} trees and surprised their opponents, overwhelming the Roman cavalry. They crossed the shallow river at full speed and charged up the hill against the legions setting up camp, giving them no time to get into battle formation. [...] It seemed to Caesar that the Nervii came on with <b>incredible</b> <b>speed,</b> all at once pouring {{out of the trees}}, charging across the river and overrunning his legionaries.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{accounts}} {{record that}} the creature {{appeared to have}} [...] "no visible arms" [...] due to its <b>incredible</b> <b>speed,</b> while others reported long, stringy arms, protruding {{from the front of}} its body, with long, claw-like fingers. The creature {{is referred to as the}} [...] "Lizard Monster" [...] on the March 10, 2010, episode of MonsterQuest. Some witnesses reported seeing a large, pulsating red ball of light that hovered above or rested on the ground. Ufologists believe that it may have been a powered craft that the entity had piloted.|$|E
50|$|Counter - When the {{opponent}} charges and launches a Special Throw, if the player can grab the disc while directly facing their opponent {{and then quickly}} throw it, the disc will be returned with the same special movement of {{the opponent}}'s Special throw but even faster (allowing for multiple counters to reach <b>incredible</b> <b>speeds).</b>|$|R
5000|$|A female automata {{who serves}} under Aberdeen. She does {{whatever}} her [...] "master" [...] tells her {{and is very}} strong - able block Nick's axe with just her bare hand.

5000|$|Meteorite had {{the ability}} to {{generate}} an aura of unknown energy, which condensed ambient air molecules into a protective shield of [...] "hard air". Her force field could be used to deflect physical attacks, or rapidly extended to attack others. The energy aura that created her air shield also allowed her to fly at <b>incredible</b> <b>speeds.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Constellation {{became the}} first {{official}} U.S. Navy ship put to sea. Almost immediately after getting underway, Constellation was ordered to the Caribbean Sea to protect American interests against the French. Tensions had increased following the Haitian Revolution and later independence in 1804, as European powers attempted to maintain control. During the naval Quasi-War with the new revolutionary French Republic, Constellation, {{under the command of}} Captain Thomas Truxtun, was forced into two major ship-to-ship naval battles involving the French ship L'Insurgente and the heavier frigate Vengeance. With its victories in both encounters, Constellation also achieved the first capture by an American vessel of an enemy ship (L'Insurgente). Its return to Baltimore was accompanied by joyous celebration and nationwide fame. The Constellation's <b>incredible</b> <b>speed</b> and power inspired the French to nickname her the [...] "Yankee Racehorse".|$|E
2500|$|Halo 5: Guardians {{takes place}} in the year 2558, and is set eight months after the events of Halo 4. The game follows the human fireteams Blue Team and Fireteam Osiris. Blue Team is led by Master Chief Petty Officer John-117 (Steve Downes) and is {{composed}} of the Spartan-II teammates he fought alongside in the timeframe before Halo: Combat Evolved: Linda-058 (Brittany Uomoleale), an elite sniper; Kelly-087 (Michelle Lukes), a scout known for her <b>incredible</b> <b>speed</b> and John's closest friend; and Frederic-104 (Travis Willingham), who is Blue Team's highest-ranking officer, but defers to Master Chief. The members of Blue Team are all Spartan-IIs, augmented super soldiers who were abducted and trained as children; they are among the last Spartan-IIs left alive. Fireteam Osiris comprises Spartan-IVs, a newer generation of Spartans who joined the program as adult members of the military. Fireteam Osiris is led by Jameson Locke (Ike Amadi), a former agent of the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) and skilled tracker. The other members of Fireteam Osiris are: Holly Tanaka (Cynthia McWilliams), a survivor of a Covenant attack on her world; Olympia Vale (Laura Bailey), who can speak many of the Covenant's dialects; and Edward Buck (Nathan Fillion), a veteran former Orbital Drop Shock Trooper, who was a main character in [...]|$|E

50|$|A very realistic, {{full-size}} {{plane was}} {{featured on the}} Wonder Woman live-action series, and shown {{several times during the}} World War II era. It was featured as a jet in two episodes of the CBS series, set in the 1970s, before disappearing. After its disappearance, Wonder Woman runs at <b>incredible</b> <b>speeds,</b> jumping great distances, or even changes costumes and rides to her destination on motorcycles.|$|R
50|$|How {{does the}} force of {{spinning}} affect {{the body and the}} mind? Jonathan attempts to escape from a locked barrel pushed down a large hill and rolling at 126 revolutions per minute, spins on a chair at <b>incredible</b> <b>speeds</b> and then navigates barefoot through piles of broken glass, and withstands two Gs of force on his body courtesy of the Water Wheel of Doom.|$|R

He apparently does not need food, water, air or sleep, and has endured for millions of years serving Paradise.|$|R
50|$|A {{cortical}} modem {{is a type}} {{of brain}} machine interface that specifically inject images directly into the visual cortex by way of a direct neural interface (DNI) chip. The true breakthrough goal lies in the information transfer speed. Both computers and the human brain can transfer information at <b>incredible</b> <b>speeds,</b> and the real bottleneck in the field of brain-computer interaction is the lack of data transfer speeds between the two.|$|R
60|$|They stood side by side, watching. With <b>incredible</b> <b>speed,</b> the Black Dragon {{passed into}} the clouds and out again.

50|$|After {{testing and}} practice, {{participants}} generally praised the course. However, {{there was an}} underlying concern around the paddock about the <b>incredible</b> <b>speeds.</b> Cars were routinely turning laps at an average speed of more than 30 mph faster than laps turned at Indianapolis. Another point of concern was the abrupt transition from the steep 31° banking in the turns to the nearly flat apron. Drivers were worried that a spinning car may come down the banking and hit the apron, resulting in a serious crash.|$|R
