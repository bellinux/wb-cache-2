2500|$|Given Schiller's {{view that}} {{the meaning of a}} thought amounts to the {{consequences}} one means to bring about by the thought, Schiller further concluded that the truth of a thought depends on whether it actually brings about the consequences one intended. For example, if while following a cooking recipe that called for salt <b>I</b> were <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> [...] "Cerebos is salt", my thought will be true if it consequently leads me to add Cerebos and produce a dish with the intended taste. However, if while working in a chemistry lab to produce a certain mixture <b>I</b> were <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> [...] "Cerebos is salt", my thought would both have a different meaning than before (since my intent now differs) and be false (since Cerebos is only equivalent to salt for culinary purposes). According to Schiller, the question of what a thought like [...] "Cerebos is salt" [...] means or whether it is true can only be answered if the specific circumstances with which the thought arose are taken into consideration. While there is some similarity here between Schiller's view of meaning and the later ordinary language philosophers, Schiller's account ties meaning and truth more closely to individuals and their intent with a specific use rather than whole linguistic communities.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Tally-ho Thompson,' says Sergeant Witchem, after merely wetting {{his lips}} with his brandy-and-water, 'Tally-ho Thompson {{was a famous}} horse-stealer, couper, and magsman. Thompson, in {{conjunction}} with a pal that occasionally worked with him, gammoned a countryman out of a good round sum of money, under pretence of getting him a situation - the regular old dodge - and was afterwards in the [...] "Hue and Cry" [...] for a horse - a horse that he stole down in Hertfordshire. I had to look after Thompson, and I applied myself, of course, in the first instance, to discovering where he was. Now, Thompson's wife lived, along with a little daughter, at Chelsea. Knowing that Thompson was somewhere in the country, I watched the house - especially at post-time in the morning - thinking Thompson was pretty likely to write to her. Sure enough, one morning the postman comes up, and delivers a letter at Mrs. Thompson's door. Little girl opens the door, and takes it in. We're not always sure of postmen, though the people at the post-offices are always very obliging. A postman may help us, or he may not, - just as it happens. However, I go across the road, and I say to the postman, after he has left the letter, [...] "Good morning! how are you?" [...] "How are YOU!" [...] says he. [...] "You've just delivered a letter for Mrs. Thompson." [...] "Yes, I have." [...] "You didn't happen to remark what the post-mark was, perhaps?" [...] "No," [...] says he, [...] "I didn't." [...] "Come," [...] says I, [...] "I'll be plain with you. I'm in a small way of business, and I have given Thompson credit, and I can't afford to lose what he owes me. I know he's got money, and I know he's in the country, and if you could tell me what the post-mark was, I should be very much obliged to you, and you'd do a service to a tradesman in a small way of business that can't afford a loss." [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I do assure you that I did not observe what the post-mark was; all I know is, that there was money in the letter - I should say a sovereign." [...] This was enough for me, because of course I knew that Thompson having sent his wife money, it was probable she'd write to Thompson, by return of post, to acknowledge the receipt. So I said [...] "Thankee" [...] to the postman, and I kept on the watch. In the afternoon I saw the little girl come out. Of course I followed her. She went into a stationer's shop, and I needn't say to you that I looked in at the window. She bought some writing-paper and envelopes, and a pen. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> [...] "That'll do!" [...] - watch her home again - and don't go away, you may be sure, knowing that Mrs. Thompson was writing her letter to Tally-ho, and that the letter would be posted presently. In about an hour or so, out came the little girl again, with the letter in her hand. I went up, and said something to the child, whatever it might have been; but I couldn't see the direction of the letter, because she held it with the seal upwards. However, I observed that {{on the back of the}} letter there was what we call a kiss - a drop of wax by the side of the seal - and again, you understand, that was enough for me. I saw her post the letter, waited till she was gone, then went into the shop, and asked to see the Master. When he came out, I told him, [...] "Now, I'm an Officer in the Detective Force; there's a letter with a kiss been posted here just now, for a man that I'm in search of; and what I have to ask of you, is, that you will let me look at the direction of that letter." [...] He was very civil - took a lot of letters from the box in the window - shook 'em out on the counter with the faces downwards - and there among 'em was the identical letter with the kiss. It was directed, Mr. Thomas Pigeon, Post Office, B-, to be left till called for. Down I went to B- (a hundred and twenty miles or so) that night. Early next morning I went to the Post Office; saw the gentleman in charge of that department; told him who I was; and that my object was to see, and track, the party that should come for the letter for Mr. Thomas Pigeon. He was very polite, and said, [...] "You shall have every assistance we can give you; you can wait inside the office; and we'll take care to let you know when anybody comes for the letter." [...] Well, I waited there three days, and began to think that nobody ever WOULD come. At last the clerk whispered to me, [...] "Here! Detective! Somebody's come for the letter!" [...] "Keep him a minute," [...] said I, and I ran round to the outside of the office. There I saw a young chap with the appearance of an Ostler, holding a horse by the bridle - stretching the bridle across the pavement, while he waited at the Post Office Window for the letter. I began to pat the horse, and that; and I said to the boy, [...] "Why, this is Mr. Jones's Mare!" [...] "No. It an't." [...] "No?" [...] said I. [...] "She's very like Mr. Jones's Mare!" [...] "She an't Mr. Jones's Mare, anyhow," [...] says he. [...] "It's Mr. So and So's, of the Warwick Arms." [...] And up he jumped, and off he went - letter and all. I got a cab, followed on the box, and was so quick after him that I came into the stable-yard of the Warwick Arms, by one gate, just as he came in by another. I went into the bar, where there was a young woman serving, and called for a glass of brandy-and-water. He came in directly, and handed her the letter. She casually looked at it, without saying anything, and stuck it up behind the glass over the chimney-piece. What was to be done next? ...|$|E

5000|$|Beginning around 2000, the Magic {{began to}} push the City of Orlando for a brand new arena, {{replacing}} the TD Waterhouse Centre. Since the city, as well as Orange County, were not keen on picking {{up the tab for}} a second facility in a little over a decade, the Magic stated they would contribute to the cost of building it. They did not, however, say how much. They also indicated they expected public dollars to be used, too. Discussions became contentious in 2001, as the team threatened to look elsewhere if Orlando would not build a new arena, or contribute a significant amount to a renovation. At the time, the team was losing $8 million annually. Magic President Bob Vander Weide stated, [...] "If we can't break even in the long term and we can't stay competitive, maybe this isn't the best place for us." [...] The Magic outlined where an arena should be built, the potential cost, what type of tax should pay for it and what could be done with the existing building once it was abandoned by the team. In a meeting with county and city officials, team owner DeVos said he was seeking $200 million in public money, including $121.5 million from the tourist tax collected by the county, $50 million from the city of Orlando and $28.5 million from the state. Officials were staunchly opposed. Any plans for renovation or replacement relied on tourist-tax revenue, and after the terrorist attacks of 9/11, the numbers of tourists in the area declined sharply. Then-Orlando Mayor Glenda Hood and Orange County Mayor Rich Crotty were close to a deal for a major renovation, but talks were broken off for several years due to the sagging tourist tax dollars. At the grand opening of the Amway Center on October 1, 2010, Crotty remarked [...] "When I look around this building, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> 'Boy, am I glad that didn't work.'

Castillo was chosen out of hundreds of other actresses for the role of Sabrina. After several weeks of waiting, she was contacted by the show again and read for executive producer, Frank Valentini. She went back for another chemistry test in late August. Castillo began filming her scenes on August 31, 2012. During the audition, the actresses started out getting [...] "pretty" [...] to do a fantasy scene in which the character admits her love for Patrick, and then transforming into a nerdy girl with glasses for the rest of the scene. To make sure she stood out from the 9 other actresses that the producers had called back, Castillo admitted that she [...] "decided to have fun." [...] Several days later, Castillo learned from her manager that she had booked the role. The character first appeared on September 19, despite some sources stating the first air date to be September 14.

The book presents a series of chapters that recognise the tensions between giving voice and the ethical concerns that mean voices are kept hidden;the values of creative forms to reach new audiences and break down barriers; {{and the importance of}} building a shared vocabulary so that researchers who apply multimodal participatory techniques can work together to refine and improve their craft...|$|E
