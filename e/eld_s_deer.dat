Dropping the tail at the end of the flight may additionally have made deer inconspicuous.

The diculty in the application of the results of [SV 1] to higher Chow groups {{lies in the fact that}} a priori higher Chow are not dened as singular homology of a sheaf. To overcome this diculty we prove that for an ane varietie X higher Chow groups CH i (X; n) of codimension i dimX may be computed using equidimensional cycles only(this is done in the rst two sections of the paper).

This is not surprising as quartz grains dominate most beach sands. Scientists, delving below the sea-surface since ~ 1980, discovered carbonate grains increase dramatically with water depth. Physical parameters such as tides, storms and currents cause mixing, transport and weathering of the entire package of grains. Sea-floor morphology further alters the ill-conceived perception of a flat surface veneered with even sized, similar grains. Chemical weathering and minor biogenic predation cause further disruption, with anthropogenic activity impinging on the natural cycle in an alarming manner and rate. This project studied 295 samples from the entire beach to 20 m water depth from 22 transects orthogonal to the beach, along the 100 km coastline adjacent {{to the city of}} Adelaide, South Australia. Results showed sediment grain-size heterogeneity is widespread, as a result of differences in mineralogy and source, particularly of the biogenic carbonate grains. This has implications for successful beach management strategies.

40|$|Since the 1800 <b>s,</b> brocket <b>deer</b> {{have been}} an {{important}} source of meat and income for subsistence and professional hunters in the Peruvian Amazon. Today, local people continue to hunt brocket deer for subsistence meat and for sale in local meat markets. Although brocket deer are not hunted as frequently as peccaries, they make a significant contribution to rural household economies. This study assessed the sustainability of hunting of brocket deer by local communities in the Tamshiyacu Tahuayo Communal Reserve (TTCR), northeastern Peru. We analyzed data from 1991 to 1999 using density comparisons, hunting pressures, an age structure model, and a harvest model comparing results between heavily hunted, slightly hunted, and non-hunted sites. The four approaches agreed that brocket deer are harvested sustainably. The sustainability of brocket deer hunting will depend on the continued presence of other valuable wildlife species (e. g. peccaries and large rodents), which are more preferred due to their ease of hunting and higher rates of encounters. Gross productivity indicates that brocket deer are showing resilience in the form of density dependent reproductive adjustments in the TTCR, but they may still be vulnerable to overhunting. Consequently, current levels of harvesting may be continued until further ecological and biological information on the species' population trends assist in defining more reliable sustainable offtake levels.

We developed a potential distribution model in Sardinia using Ecological Niche Factor Analysis. To assess the deer's protection status we compared the model with the existing and proposed conservation areas and investigated different conservation scenarios in relation to the expansion of its current range and resilience to future changes in land use and predicted trends of desertification. According to our results over 70 % of Sardinia is unsuitable to the deer, nevertheless high suitability areas (Mediterranean forests away from main roads) are available throughout the island, particularly in the south and in the central-eastern part. Existing protected areas do not provide for the conservation of the deer but public owned forests, where hunting is prohibited, extend some level of protection, and the protected areas proposed by the Regional administration, if implemented, will be increasing this protection. Three main areas have emerged as conservation priorities to guarantee adequate conservation potential in the future. Our approach provides valuable data to inform conservation policy, and could be easily replicated {{in other parts of the}} Mediterranean...|$|R
40|$|In New Jersey, annual {{losses from}} white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) {{depredation}} to agricultural crops have been estimated {{as high as}} 10 million. Additional problems caused by the state 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> overabundance of <b>deer</b> include increasing vehicle/deer collisions, possible human health concerns regarding increasing incidences of Lyme disease, {{and a loss of}} flora and fauna diversity. In an effort to reduce deer numbers and minimize damage, both non-lethal and lethal management practices have been used with limited success. Hunter access to private lands remains the biggest impediment to effective deer management in New Jersey. I propose an incentive-based program to increase lease and fee hunting on private lands in New Jersey. Among the benefits of such a program are an increase in landowner income, safe and controlled areas for hunters, and greater reduction of the deer population and resulting damage while improving overall wildlife management. I also discuss other types of wildlife-related lease and fee recreation and areas of needed research to effectively implement a private lands program...|$|R
