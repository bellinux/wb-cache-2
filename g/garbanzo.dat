25|$|Traditionally based {{mostly on}} tourism, sport fishing, salt {{production}} and mining, in 2012 the GDP {{of the state}} accounted for only 0.73% of the country’s GDP, but grew 3.13% {{in comparison to the}} year prior. In 2013, this growth increased to 7.8%. Unemployment in 2013 was 5.1% with employment shifting away from agriculture and fishing to mining and industry (up 19.9%) and commerce (up 4.9%). Today, agriculture, fishing and forestry account for only 3.89% of the state GDP.

25|$|Two iconic American {{stories have}} Spanish antecedents, too. Almost 80 years before John Smith's alleged rescue by Pocahontas, {{a man by}} the name of Juan Ortiz told of his remarkably similar rescue from {{execution}} by an Indian girl. Spaniards also held a thanksgiving—56 years before the famous Pilgrims festival—when they feasted near St. Augustine with Florida Indians, probably on stewed pork and <b>garbanzo</b> beans. As late as 1783, at the end of the American Revolutionary War, Spain held claim to roughly half of today's continental United States (see New Spain); in 1775, Spanish ships even reached Alaska. From 1819 to 1848, the United States and its army increased the nation's area by roughly a third at Spanish and Mexican expense, including today's three most populous states: California, Texas, and Florida. Hispanics became the first American citizens in the newly acquired Southwest territory and remained the ancestral majority in several states until the 20th century.|$|E

2500|$|Bentazon is a {{selective}} herbicide as it only damages plants unable to metabolize the chemical. It is considered safe {{for use on}} alfalfa, beans (with the exception of <b>garbanzo</b> beans [...] ), corn, peanuts, peas (with the exception of blackeyed peas [...] ), pepper, peppermint, rice, sorghum, soybeans and spearmint; as well as lawns and turf. Bentazon is usually applied aerially or through contact spraying on food crops to control the spread of weeds occurring amongst food crops. Herbicides containing bentazon should be kept away from high heat as it will release toxic sulfur and nitrogen fumes.|$|E
