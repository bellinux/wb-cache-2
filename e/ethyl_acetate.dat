5|$|Siddiqui was {{the first}} {{scientist}} to bring the anthelmintic, antifungal, antibacterial, and antiviral constituents of the Neem tree {{to the attention of}} natural products chemists. In 1942, he extracted three bitter compounds from neem oil, which he named as nimbin, nimbinin, and nimbidin respectively. The process involved extracting the water-insoluble components with ether, petrol ether, <b>ethyl</b> <b>acetate</b> and dilute alcohol. The provisional naming was nimbin (sulphur-free crystalline product with melting point at 205°C, empirical composition C7H10O2), nimbinin (with similar principle, melting at 192°C), and nimbidin (cream-coloured containing amorphous sulphur, melting at 90–100°C). Siddiqui identified nimbidin as the main active antibacterial ingredient, and the highest yielding bitter component in the neem oil. These compounds are stable and found in substantial quantities in the Neem. They also serve as natural insecticides.|$|E

25|$|The natural {{esterification}} {{that takes}} place in wines and other alcoholic beverages during the aging process is an example of acid-catalysed esterification.

As a result, <b>ethyl</b> <b>acetate</b> – the ester of ethanol and acetic acid—is the most abundant ester in wines. Other combinations of organic alcohols (such as phenol-containing compounds) and organic acids lead to a variety of different esters in wines, contributing to their different flavours, smells and tastes.

Despite the advantages of such controlled fermentations, the fermentation involved {{in the production of}} chocolate is still a spontaneous process that relies on the natural microbiota at cocoa farms. However, recent studies indicate that certain thermotolerant Saccharomyces cerevisiae cultures can be used as starter cultures for cocoa pulp fermentation. In this study, we investigate the potential of specifically developed starter cultures to modulate chocolate aroma. Specifically, we developed several new S. cerevisiae hybrids that combine thermotolerance and efficient cocoa pulp fermentation with a high production of volatile flavor-active esters. In addition, we investigated the potential of two strains of two non-Saccharomyces species that produce very large amounts of fruity esters (Pichia kluyveri and Cyberlindnera fabianii) to modulate chocolate aroma. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the cocoa liquor revealed an increased concentration of various flavor-active esters and a decrease in spoilage-related off-flavors in batches inoculated with S. cerevisiae starter cultures and, to a lesser extent, in batches inoculated with P. kluyveri and Cyb. fabianii.
