6000|$|... "By no means. But {{you know}} he has a roving disposition, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> sort of fondness for Jackson--the boss of the ranch." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Easy with him," [...] Harry said. [...] "Steady {{with that}} arm. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> {{shoulder}} broken, {{as well as}} this knock on the head that has stunned him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But my idea is this: {{if a man}} {{has saved}} a few pounds himself, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> right {{to give it to}} those he loves best. Now I have no {{children}} of my own.' ...|$|E
60|$|Cetewayo groaned {{but said}} nothing. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> become too faint to speak.|$|R
60|$|MABEL. He was {{changing}} his clothes to go out. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> gone.|$|R
60|$|Alan {{looked at}} it critically. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> helped to make it not long before.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am only {{repeating the}} general voice," [...] said Sydney, with a gleam upon her face, half-droll, half-tender. [...] "Poor little man! I got him alone this morning, {{while his mother}} was pouring forth to mine, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> little more notion where thanks are due." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At least, I should {{communicate}} with the police, and have a special constable put on outside in Belmore Street," [...] said I. [...] "As to the letter, if the writer wishes to be anonymous, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> right to remain so. We must trust to the future to show some reason for the curious course which he has adopted." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Let me collect myself; he {{is going}} to the {{observatory}} of Cambridge, United States, to meet some gentlemen there, and spy through the great refractor. Then there's the observatory of Chicago; and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> letter to make him beknown to a gentleman in the observatory at Marseilles--and he wants to go to Vienna--and Poulkowa, too, he means to take in his way--there being great instruments and a lot of astronomers at each place.' ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Thaksin failed on {{the populist}} {{movement}} and now <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> resorted {{to some sort}} of assassination attempt." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> {{heard nothing}} specific, though <b>he</b> may <b>have</b> caught up vague threats in {{wandering}} through the streets." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'll {{tell you}} what,' said Charles, {{lowering}} his voice,' from what Bolton says, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> a dread of worse than brain fever.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Think {{what you}} please, Dean, but I {{advise you to}} say as little as {{possible}} if you wish to remain. I have not accepted Mr. Coventry yet, and if he chooses to set aside the engagement his family made for him, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> right to do so. Miss Beaufort would hardly care to marry him against his will, because he pities her for her unhappy love," [...] and with a tranquil smile, Miss Muir walked away.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{say they}} have {{committed}} him to gaol. So my informant tells me. But {{of course all the}} Plumstead and Framley set will move heaven and earth to get him out, so that he may be there as a disgrace to the diocese. I wonder how the dean will feel when he hears of it! I do, indeed. For the dean, though he is an idle, useless man, with no church principles, and no real piety, still he has a conscience. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> conscience." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] Monsieur du Tillet agreed, {{but in a}} {{somewhat}} doubtful tone of voice. [...] "So far as assurances go {{there is nothing to}} be desired, and he has, as I said, so far acted loyally up to them, and yet somehow I do not like him. It strikes me that he is playing a game, although what that game is I cannot say. At anyrate I do not trust him; he speaks smoothly but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> double face, and that he is cruel and treacherous." ...|$|E
60|$|My ready {{acquiescence}} pleased him. I {{could see}} that <b>he</b> was relieved. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> expected me to jib {{at the prospect of}} actual work.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is obvious}} that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> tact, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> feeling," [...] said Father Agustin. [...] "But <b>has</b> <b>he</b> not some news for us, perhaps?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I must admit," [...] {{the doctor}} answered, [...] "that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> very {{little chance of}} recovery. His {{constitution}} <b>has</b> gone. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> no recuperative powers." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{find that}} Mr. Neville is {{very fond of}} shooting,--so much so that [...] before we knew {{anything}} of him except his name we had heard that he [...] had been on our coast after seals and sea birds. We have very high [...] cliffs near here,--some people say {{the highest in the}} world, and [...] there is one called the Hag's Head from which men get down and [...] shoot sea-gulls. He has been different times in our village of [...] Liscannor, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> boat there or at Lahinch. I believe [...] he has already killed ever so many seals.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, {{you don't}} know what I've endured! He {{used to spend}} long periods away from me, and I {{remained}} alone at Skene from morning till night, alone with my abject fear. Sometimes, it seemed that he was seized with a devouring lust for the gutter, and {{he would go to}} Liverpool or Manchester and throw himself among the very dregs of the people. He used to pass long days, drinking in filthy pot-houses. While the bout lasted, nothing was too depraved for him. He loved the company of all that was criminal and low. He used to smoke opium in foetid dens--oh, you have no conception of his passion to degrade himself--and at last he would come back, dirty, with torn clothes, begrimed, sodden still with his long debauch; and his mouth was hot with the kisses of the vile women of the docks. Oh, he's so cruel when the fit takes him that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> fiendish pleasure in the sight of suffering!' ...|$|E
6000|$|But it {{was only}} when I had myself become a medical man that I was able to {{appreciate}} how entirely he is a survival of a past generation. He had learned his medicine under that obsolete and forgotten system by which a youth was apprenticed to a surgeon, in the days when the study of anatomy was often approached through a violated grave. His views upon his own profession are even more reactionary than his politics. Fifty years have brought him little and deprived him of less. Vaccination was well within the teaching of his youth, though <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> secret preference for inoculation. Bleeding he would practise freely but for public opinion. Chloroform he regards as a dangerous innovation, and he always clicks with his tongue when it is mentioned. He has even been known to say vain things about Laennec, and to refer to the stethoscope as [...] "a newfangled French toy." [...] He carries one in his hat out of deference to the expectations of his patients; but he is very hard of hearing, so that it makes little difference whether he uses it or not.|$|E
6000|$|... "Didn't he {{manage to}} beat the blues at Amaillou and at Coron, and at Durbelli√®re? Faith, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> done nothing but beat them these three months." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He hasn't been in {{the house}} above five minutes yet," [...] said Lady Albury, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> been very quick." [...] Ayala thought so too.|$|R
6000|$|... "He is gone, poor fellow!" [...] he said. [...] "He {{never spoke}} again. The bullet went {{close to the}} heart. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> bled to death, internally.|$|R
60|$|After the soup, we had turbot, and {{by and by}} {{a bottle}} of Chateau Margaux, very delectable; and then some lambs' feet, delicately done, and some cutlets of I know not what {{peculiar}} type; and finally a ptarmigan, which is of the same race of birds as the grouse, but feeds high up towards the summits of the Scotch mountains. Then some cheese, {{and a bottle of}} Chambertin. It was a very pleasant dinner, and my companions were both very agreeable men; both taking a shrewd, satirical, yet not ill-natured, view of life and people, and as for Mr. Douglas Jerrold, he often reminded me of E---- C------, in the richer veins of the latter, both by his face and expression, and by a tincture of something at once wise and humorously absurd in what he said. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> kinder, more genial, wholesomer nature than E----, and under a very thin crust of outward acerbity I grew sensible of a very warm heart, and even of much simplicity of character in this man, born in London, and accustomed always to London life.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the morning}} Mr. Fernlea said to Roland, when he {{appeared}} at the office, [...] "The more I think of it, the more I am convinced {{that it would be}} dangerous to try and get any of the directors to act with us. Johnstone virtually runs the concern, and the others know very little about it, and I do not think that I could get any of them to move. The best man that I can think of is Hertman. He is one of our most prominent men of business, and is a large shareholder in the bank, and is intelligent and independent; and if he were convinced that wrong had been done he would take it up. Hitherto he has, of course, been under the impression that your father was guilty, and expressed himself freely in condemnation of the policy of the directors in allowing him to escape and in hushing matters up. He is not a client of mine, but I am concerned in business transactions with him, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> respect for my judgment, as I have for his. I have written a note saying that I want to speak to him on business, and shall be glad if he will come over to my office, or I will go over to his, as will be most convenient to him. Will you take it across at once? His office is in Exchange Street." ...|$|E
5000|$|Colin Escott, {{author of}} the sleeve notes for Elvis Presley - The Million Dollar Quartet, {{reported}} that according to Sun employee and session participant Charles Underwood, Presley and Phillips went into the control room while Lewis was playing and Presley commented to Bob Johnson that [...] "Lewis could go. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> great future ahead of him. He had a different style {{and the way he}} plays piano and gets inside me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I presume {{there is}} nothing more I can do for you, and that is {{apparently}} Captain Esmond. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> some business with me," [...] he said.|$|R
6000|$|... "Past it rather," [...] Peter answered, {{shutting}} up his book. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> {{walked a}} little slower than he used, these few last evenings, mother." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But yet <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{the feeling}} of the House with him," [...] said the Duke. [...] "I {{happened}} to be present in the gallery at the time." ...|$|R
5000|$|On April 20, 2010, Douglas {{was sentenced}} {{to five years in}} prison for both {{possessing}} heroin and dealing large amounts of methamphetamine and cocaine out of a New York hotel room. Michael Douglas publicly assumed blame for [...] "being a bad father" [...] but said that without prison intervention, Cameron [...] "was going to be dead or somebody was gonna kill him. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> chance to start a new life, and he knows that." ...|$|E
5000|$|U.S. Representative Gillis William Long of Alexandria {{endorsed}} Edwards. Of Treen, Long, said: [...] "I {{dealt with}} him for seven year the House, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> hard time working with people {{and coming up with}} compromise solutions." [...] Long incorrectly predicted that the Treen-Edwards showdown would be [...] "a close race." [...] Long said that the state political arena had changed from 1971, when he ran for governor, to the 1983 contest, from [...] "the politics of personality to the politics of demographics." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{new head}} coach of Elfsborg, J√∂rgen Lennartsson {{was the one who}} scouted Joackim already during his time at Stab√¶k. He commented on Joackim: [...] "He is a type of player I think we are missing a little. He is a Jari Illola-type, slow but still skilled. I {{followed}} him during my time at Stab√¶k and he has done an incredibly good job at Sarpsborg. He is a typical two-way player and he's really fit. 28 starts in Tippeligaen this season. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> very good shot and is good in his main game. He is a good team player and a great guy, I'm very happy that we could bring him to Elfsborg." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He is a gentleman." [...] said Lady Laura; [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> position. <b>I</b> {{do not see}} why {{he should}} not ask any girl to marry him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are a poor butcher," [...] {{she said}} at length, [...] "after {{so many years of}} practice. Let Kaku yonder try. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> more skill in murder." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He is not sentimental," [...] said Mrs. Penniman; [...] "but, to be {{perfectly}} fair to him, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has,</b> in his own narrow way, {{a certain sense of}} duty." ...|$|R
