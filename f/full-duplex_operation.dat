50|$|The BroadR-Reach {{automotive}} Ethernet standard realizes simultaneous transmit {{and receive}} (i.e., <b>full-duplex)</b> <b>operations</b> on a single-pair cable {{instead of the}} half-duplex operation in 100BASE-TX, which uses one pair for transmit and one for receive {{to achieve the same}} data rate. In order to better de-correlate the signal, the digital signal processor (DSP) uses a highly optimized scrambler when compared to the scrambler used in 100BASE-TX. This provides a robust and efficient signaling scheme required by automotive applications. The BroadR-Reach automotive Ethernet standard uses a signaling scheme with higher spectral efficiency than that of 100BASE-TX. This limits the signal bandwidth of Automotive Ethernet to 33.3 MHz, which is about half the bandwidth of 100BASE-TX. A lower signal bandwidth improves return loss, reduces crosstalk, and ensures that BroadR-Reach automotive Ethernet standard passes the stringent automotive electromagnetic emission requirements.|$|R

In [8], authors aimed to design the optimal jamming vector that maximizes the secrecy rate and mitigates loop interference. To enhance secrecy performance of a multiple-input-single-output-single-eavesdropper (MISOSE) relay system, a joint information beamforming and jamming beamforming strategy were proposed to guarantee both transmitting security and receiving security for a FD base station in [9].

5000|$|Transmission {{operation}} is simpler as the timing {{does not have}} to be determined from the line state, nor is it bound to any fixed timing intervals. As soon as the sending system deposits a character in the shift register (after completion of the previous character), the UART generates a start bit, shifts the required number of data bits out to the line, generates and sends the parity bit (if used), and sends the stop bits. Since <b>full-duplex</b> <b>operation</b> requires characters to be sent and received at the same time, UARTs use two different shift registers for transmitted and received characters. High performance UARTs could contain a transmit FIFO (first in first out) buffer to allow a CPU or DMA controller to deposit multiple characters in a burst into the FIFO rather than have to deposit one character at a time into the FIFO. Since transmission of a single or multiple characters may take a long time relative to CPU speeds, a UART maintains a flag showing busy status so that the host system knows if there is at least one character in the transmit buffer or shift register; [...] "ready for next character(s)" [...] may also be signaled with an interrupt.|$|E
