5|$|At the Falls of Arcadia, {{a fictional}} planned {{community}} in San Diego County, California, disgruntled homeowner Dave Kline arrives {{at home to}} find a package from an unknown person. The package contains a tacky whirligig, which Kline puts on his roof to annoy the neighbors. While <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> that night, Kline hears an intruder in the house. He goes to investigate while his wife, Nancy, stays <b>in</b> <b>bed.</b> A mysterious creature attacks and kills the Klines.|$|E

Matthew began creating the melody and track, and I started working on the lyrics. I remember staying <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> for three days, writing 25 versions of the lyric. I love being <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> and writing lyrics, and having my dog Jet and my kitty Dash on the bed. Anyway, we finally finished the lyric, then we completed the demo.|$|E
40|$|Fed cattle {{closeouts}} {{from the}} years 2007 - 2009 were analyzed {{to measure the}} difference in performance of cattle fed in open lots compared to cattle fed <b>in</b> <b>bedded</b> confinement buildings. Cattle fed <b>in</b> <b>bedded</b> confinements had better feed conversions and heavier finish weights then cattle fed in open lots. Cattle fed <b>in</b> <b>bedded</b> confinements also tended to have better daily gains then cattle fed in open lots...|$|R
40|$|This study {{measured}} growth (Average Daily Gain or ADG), {{feed intake}} (Average Daily Feed Intake or ADFI), feed efficiencies, and lean/fat deposition in heavyweight market finishing pigs <b>in</b> <b>bedded</b> hoop barns. The pigs were housed <b>in</b> <b>bedded</b> hoop barns, which {{are of interest}} because of their recent popularity in the niche market for pork from pigs not reared in conventional confinement. Pigs <b>in</b> <b>bedded</b> hoop barns consume some bedding,which may impact feed utilization. Further, the thermal environment is variable and closely matches the seasonal environment. Also, the market is calling for heavier pigs {{and there is a}} lack of performance information for these weights, especially <b>in</b> <b>bedded</b> hoop barns...|$|R

5|$|Dannemann, {{the only}} {{eyewitness}} to Hendrix's final hours, said that sometime after 3 a.m., she prepared two tuna fish sandwiches for them after arriving {{back at her}} basement apartment. Around 4 a.m., Hendrix, struggling with insomnia after having consumed amphetamines hours earlier, asked her for sleeping tablets. She later said she refused his request hoping he would fall asleep naturally. Dannemann said she surreptitiously took a sleeping tablet sometime around 6 a.m., with Hendrix still awake. She awoke sometime between 10 and 10:20a.m. to find him sleeping normally <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> next to her. She said she then left to purchase cigarettes, and when she returned around 11 a.m., found him <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> breathing, although unconscious and unresponsive. She telephoned for an ambulance at 11:18a.m. and one arrived at 11:27a.m.|$|E
50|$|The {{investigation}} {{began with}} a report to police {{of the discovery of}} Yolanda Johnson's body. The report was made by Solomon. Johnson, a drug user and a prostitute, had been bound and was found partially nude. Apodaca, also a drug user and a prostitute, was bound and buried wrapped up <b>in</b> <b>bedding.</b> Polidore was bound and partially nude. Washington, a prostitute and possibly a drug user, may have been bound and wrapped up <b>in</b> <b>bedding.</b> Vitela, a drug user and prostitute, was nude and wrapped <b>in</b> <b>bedding.</b> This was also true of Jacox. Massey, possibly a drug user and prostitute, was bound, nude, and wrapped <b>in</b> <b>bedding.</b> These common factors were interpreted by police to mean they were dealing with only one killer.|$|R

5|$|Generally, {{for people}} {{experiencing}} difficulties with sleep, spending less time <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> results in {{deeper and more}} continuous sleep, so clinicians will frequently recommend eliminating use of the bed for any activities except sleep (or sex).|$|E

40|$|More pigs {{are being}} {{produced}} <b>in</b> <b>bedded</b> {{systems such as}} hoop barns due {{to the increase in}} demand for niche pork. Most of the current swine nutrition information has been generated in confinement settings without bedding. As omnivores, pigs ingest some bedding. There are questions about the effects of the ingested bedding on growth and feed utilization by the modern market pig. More knowledge in this area will allow for more accurate feed formulation <b>in</b> <b>bedded</b> systems...|$|R
