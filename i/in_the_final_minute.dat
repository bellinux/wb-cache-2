Later in the quarter, Henry scored his second long touchdown of the game for Alabama on a 61—yard reception from McCarron that cut the Oklahoma lead to 38–31. However, the Sooners closed {{the game with a}} long drive that ran down the clock and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>minute,</b> an Eric Striker sack of McCarron caused a fumble that Grissom recovered and returned eight-yards for a touchdown and made the final score 45–31.

5|$|Arsenal's {{final game}} at the stadium was their FA Premier League match on 7 May 2006 against Wigan Athletic, the last game of the season. The team needed to better the result of {{neighbours}} Tottenham Hotspur to again secure qualification for the Champions League. Having been 2–1 behind, a hat trick by captain and all-time leading goal scorer Thierry Henry secured qualification, with Henry kneeling down to kiss the turf on scoring what {{proved to be the}} final goal seen at the stadium. The last goal scored in a regulation {{game at the}} stadium came in a Football Aid charity match when lifelong fan Alan Alger scored a penalty <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>minute</b> of a fixture played on Thursday 8 June 2006 (exactly one month and one day after Henry's goal). After the stadium's closure, Arsenal held an auction to sell off many of the stadium's parts, including pieces of the pitch, the goalposts and former manager George Graham's desk. Sale of the stadium's seats had to be cancelled after it was found they contained trace amounts of the toxic metal cadmium.|$|E
5|$|Atlético de Kolkata had {{the first}} major {{opportunity}} {{of the second half}} when Jakub Podaný crossed the ball into the box with both Baljit Sahni and Arnal looking to head it in before David James came out to catch the ball. The Kerala Blasters soon had three chances in three minutes but could not convert any of those into goals. Just after the 60th minute, Kerala Blasters defender Sandesh Jhingan almost headed the ball into his own net while trying to clear it. The Kerala Blasters continued to have the most chances throughout the match, which was compounded in the last minute of regulation time when Michael Chopra had his point blank range shot saved by Apoula Edel. Four minutes later, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>minute</b> of stoppage time, Atlético de Kolkata substitute Mohammed Rafique headed home a corner from Podaný to win the match and the championship.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the absence}} of Bertuzzi for the {{remainder}} of the season, Näslund led the Canucks to the Northwest Division title they had lost the previous season. Bertuzzi was replaced on the top line by Matt Cooke. The Canucks' division title placed them third in the Western Conference standings, matching them against the sixth-placed Calgary Flames in the opening round of the 2004 playoffs. In the seventh and deciding game of the series between the two teams, the Canucks faced a one-goal deficit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>minute</b> of regulation time. With the Canucks having pulled their goaltender for an extra attacker, Näslund stickhandled the length of the ice past two defenders, before shooting the puck on goal. Calgary goaltender Miikka Kiprusoff saved the shot before Cooke scored on the rebound with six seconds left in the game. Despite the effort, Calgary subsequently eliminated Vancouver a minute-and-a-half into the subsequent overtime period on a powerplay goal. Näslund finished the playoffs with nine points in seven games.|$|E

5|$|Hamm was a {{key part}} of the U.S. team at the 1996 Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta; this was the first Olympic tournament to include women's soccer. The U.S. faced Denmark in their first {{preliminary}} round match. Hamm scored a goal and served an assist to Tiffeny Milbrett to lead the U.S. to a 3–0 win. The team defeated Sweden 2–1 next at the Orlando Citrus Bowl. After tying China 0–0 in their final preliminary round match, the U.S. finished second in Group E. Defeating Norway in the semi-finals, the team faced China in the final. Hamm played despite having foot and groin injuries, suffered during team training and the match against Sweden. Although she was carried off by stretcher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>minute,</b> her team won their first Olympic gold medal with a 2–1 win witnessed by 76,481 fans in the stadium – the largest crowd for a soccer event in the history of the Olympics and the largest crowd for a women's sports event in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Huddersfield {{started the}} 2005–06 {{season in the}} same form. Brandon scored his first goal of the season during a 2–1 win over Doncaster Rovers on 29 August 2008, which gave them their fifth win from seven games during the month. In mid-November, Brandon signed the two-year {{contract}} extension, which kept him at Huddersfield until June 2008, and instantly targeted promotion. The following month Brandon scored the only goal of a 1–0 win over non-league Worcester City in the FA Cup second round to earn Huddersfield a tie with Premiership champions Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. Two days later, Brandon received another red card, as both he and David Mirfin were sent off <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>minute</b> of a 2–2 draw with Milton Keynes Dons. Brandon returned to the side following his suspension and helped Huddersfield to win {{a place in the}} play-offs. He was an unused substitute in the first leg 1–0 victory over Barnsley, and he played just eight minutes of the second leg, as Huddersfield lost 3–1 to again miss out on promotion.|$|E

Young and Curie were both in the Marist Class 4A sectional in the 2014 IHSA playoffs and could have met again in the round of sixteen on March 14 if they had both won three regional contests. Despite forfeiting all wins in CPL games, Curie remained eligible to compete in the IHSA playoffs due to differences in eligibility rules. On March 4, Curie lost their opening IHSA playoff game to 11–11 DuSable High School by an 88–85 margin in overtime. It marked Curies first loss of the season on the court with Alexander in the lineup. Alexander posted 25 points, 15 rebounds, and 8 blocks despite fouling out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>minute</b> of regulation time. Curie trailed 13–2 early and led 47–32 midway through the third quarter. Curie starters Josh and Joseph Stamps were ineligible for IHSA play as was Malik Washington.|$|E

5|$|On March 26, 1931, Ross {{substituted}} a sixth skater for goaltender Tiny Thompson <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>minute</b> {{of play in}} {{a playoff}} game against the Montreal Canadiens. Although the Bruins lost the game 1–0, Ross became the first coach to replace his goaltender with an extra attacker, a tactic which became widespread practice in hockey. Stepping aside as coach in 1934 to focus on managing the team, Ross hired Frank Patrick as coach with a salary of $10,500, which was high for such a role. However rumours spread during the season that Patrick was drinking heavily and not being as strict with the players as Ross wanted. After the Bruins lost their playoff series with the Toronto Maple Leafs in the 1936 playoffs, {{the result of an}} 8–1 score in the second game, a newspaper claimed that Patrick had been drinking the day of the game and had trouble controlling the team. Several days later, Ross relieved Patrick of his duties and once again assumed the role of coach.|$|E
5|$|On {{the opening}} kickoff {{of the second}} half, Derrick Henry forced a Keon Hatcher fumble that was {{recovered}} by Eddie Jackson for the Crimson Tide. Three plays later, Alabama led 35–0 after McCarron threw a 17-yard touchdown pass to O. J. Howard. On their next offensive drive, T. J. Yeldon scored on a 24-yard touchdown run that extended the Crimson Tide lead to 42–0. The Alabama defense then had their second Allen interception of the evening on the Razorbacks possession that ensued with Cyrus Jones' play at the 47-yard line. With the offensive reserves in the game, Blake Sims led the team to a 45–0 lead after Cade Foster connected on a 48-yard field goal. Henry then made the final score 52–0 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>minute</b> of play with his 80-yard touchdown run. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Razorbacks 14–8 (17–7 without NCAA vacations and forfeits).|$|E
5|$|The game {{received}} heavy {{media attention}} with over ten television stations and seventy news reporters being represented. The North Carolina Tar Heels jumped {{out to an}} early 197 lead in the first half, before the Jayhawks were able to close the lead before halftime. In the second half, the Jayhawks managed to fully overcome the deficit and take the lead. However, the Tar Heels were able {{to tie the game}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>minute,</b> sending the game to overtime. The first overtime saw each team score a basket before time ran out, while the second overtime saw zero points scored due to poor offensive execution on both teams parts.

5|$|Celtic {{reached the}} European Cup final again in 1970. Celtic knocked out Basel {{in the first}} round, then {{defeated}} Portuguese side Benfica 3–0 at Parkhead in {{the first leg of}} the second round. Celtic's performance was impressive, and they were unfortunate not to score more. Benfica rallied in the return match and put Celtic under intense pressure from the start. John Fallon was outstanding in goal for Celtic and with the game nearing its end had limited the score to 2–0 for the Portuguese side. Diamantino, however, scored direct from a free-kick <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>minute</b> to level the tie on aggregate and force extra-time. No further goals were scored in the additional 30 minutes, and the tie was decided by the toss of a coin. Captain Billy McNeill successfully called, and Celtic progressed to the quarter-finals. Celtic were unhappy that the tie had been decided in this manner, and suggested to UEFA an alternative of using a scoreline {{based on the number of}} corners forced in extra-time. UEFA rejected this proposal, but soon afterwards introduced penalty kick shoot-outs in the European Cup to decide drawn ties after extra-time. Celtic went on to face Italian champions Fiorentina in the quarter-finals, winning 3–1 on aggregate.|$|E
5|$|End Dante Lavelli {{returned}} to the lineup for the Browns' week-eight game against the New York Yankees after recovering from a broken leg sustained in the preseason. Lavelli's return had an immediate impact. He caught a 29-yard pass from Graham for the Browns' first touchdown in the first quarter. Graham then threw two more touchdowns {{in the second quarter}} to Bob Cowan and Mac Speedie. Cowan scored after catching Graham's pass behind New York's defenders and running 35 yards for the end zone. Receptions by Cowan and Lavelli set up Speedie's 9-yard touchdown. Lavelli caught another touchdown {{at the beginning of the}} third quarter to give the Browns a 28–0 lead. Graham ran 22 yards for a fifth Browns touchdown in the fourth quarter after a pass play broke down. The Yankees avoided a shutout <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>minute</b> of the game, when end Buddy Young got behind Cleveland's defenders and caught a 34-yard touchdown pass from Pete Layden. The Browns had 486 total yards in the game, including 337 yards of passing. While Cleveland remained undefeated, the San Francisco 49ers continued to hold the best record in the AAFC with nine straight wins to begin the season.|$|E
5|$|In the quarter-finals, Queen of the South played Second Division club Dumbarton, also at Palmerston Park.

Despite Dumbarton's efforts, Queen of the South sealed the victory with a goal from Derek Lyle <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>minute</b> of the match to win 2–0 and progress to the semi-finals. With four teams left in the tournament, Queen of the South travelled to Love Street to face fellow First Division club St Mirren. Paul Shields scored first for Queen of the South in the seventh minute but was cancelled out five minutes later with a goal from Brian McGinty to make it 1–1 before Derek Lyle put Queen of the South back in front shortly before half time. Early in the second half, both teams scored again; Martin Cameron for St Mirren and Steve Bowey for Queen of the South to make the scoreline 3–2 to the away team. With ten minutes left to play, Gerhard Fellner equalised for St Mirren to make it 3–3 but late goals in the final two minutes from a Peter Weatherson free kick and Shields' second goal of the game won the match 5–3 and sent Queen of the South into the final for the second time in its history.|$|E
