40|$|Increasing {{areas of}} altered wetland are being {{restored}} by re-flooding the soil. Evidence {{in the literature}} indicates that this practice can induce the redox-mediated release of soil nutrients, thereby increasing the risk of diffuse water pollution. However, {{for the sake of}} improving wedand management decisions, {{there is a need for}} more detailed studies of the underlying relationship between the hydrological and redox dynamics that explain this risk; this is particularly the case in agricultural peatlands that are commonly targeted for the creation of lowland wet grassland. A 12 -month field study was conducted to evaluate the relationship between hydrological fluctuations and soil redox potential (Eh) in a nutrient-rich peat field (32 g N kg(- 1) and 1100 mg P kg(- 1) in the surface 0 - 30 cm soil) that had been restored as lowland wet grassland from intensive arable production. Field tensiometers were installed at the 30 -, 60 - and 90 -cm soil depths, and Pt electrodes at the 10 -, 30 -, 60 - and 90 -cm depths, for <b>daily</b> <b>logging</b> of soil water tension and Eh, respectively. The values for soil water tension displayed a strong negative relationship (P 330 mV) in the surface, 0 - 10 cm layer of peat coincided with intense precipitation events. Redox potential throughout the 30 - 100 cm profile also fluctuated seasonally; indeed, at all depths Eh displayed a strong, negative relationship (P < 0. 001) with water table height over the 12 -month study period. However, Eh throughout the 30 - 100 cm profile remained relatively low (< 230 mV), indicating permanently reduced conditions that are associated with denitrification and reductive dissolution of Fe-bound P. The implications of these processes in the N- and P-rich peat for wetland plant diversity and water quality are discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the {{management}} of forests in nature conservation areas represents a key interest in Europe, animal-powered logging is only rarely covered by scientific papers. The main aim {{of this study was to}} explore the occurrences of this practice in Hungarian nature conservation areas (i. e. that belong to IUCN Categories Ia, II or V as well as Natura 2000 SPA or SAC sites) that are owned by the state (i. e. about 75 % of all the forested nature conservation areas), and compile the characteristics, advantages and disadvantages of animal-powered logging according to interviews with loggers. All the Forest Districts in Hungary (116) were contacted by phone. 26 % of the Forest Districts apply animal logging regularly (draft horse in every case), but only 2. 6 % (a mere 3 Forest Districts) own a horse stock for this purpose, while the others (27) employ contractors. 7. 76 % (9 Forest Districts) use animal power for skidding only occasionally and none of them own horses. All operate at least partially on nature conservation areas. Although 2. 6 % of the Forest Districts own a horse stock, they do not use animal power for skidding. The average animal logging operation consists of two animals and three people (one of them leads the horses) that do thinning in young stands and selection work. Data on advantages and disadvantages was gathered via semi-structured onsite interviews. The <b>daily</b> <b>logging</b> capacity of a single draft horse ranges from 4. 5 m 3 to 30 m 3, depending on topography and weather conditions. Resulting advantages include: less harm to topsoil, wood stands, and saplings, the support of natural regeneration of forests, horses are more economical than machines in thick snow, there is no use of fossil fuels, more jobs are created, and preservation of native horse breeds is supported. Conversely, output capacity is less compared to the use of machines, and only few people want or are able to work with draft horses. It is mostly the terrain conditions (especially efficient in steep terrain) and the environmental constraints that determine the use of horses instead of skidders...|$|E

40|$|Novel {{periodic}} {{extensions of}} dynamic long memory regression models with autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic errors are {{considered for the}} analysis of daily electricity spot prices. The parameters of the model with mean and variance specifications are estimated simultaneously by the method of approximate maximum likelihood. The methods are implemented for time series of 1, 200 to 4, 400 daily price observations. Apart from persistence, heteroskedasticity and extreme observations in prices, a novel empirical finding is the importance of day-of-the-week periodicity in the autocovariance function of electricity spot prices. In particular, <b>daily</b> <b>log</b> prices from the Nord Pool power exchange of Norway are modeled effectively by our framework, which is also extended with explanatory variables.
