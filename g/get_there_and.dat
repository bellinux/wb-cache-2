500|$|Jon Landau {{describes}} [...] "Starting a New Life" [...] as [...] "both {{the simplest}} and lyrically the most significant cut on the album as Van spells out with perfect clarity the statement of Tupelo Honey: it expresses his need {{to take stock of}} himself, to see how far he has come, to record the support of those who have helped him <b>get</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> together with them to 'start a new life.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Regarding her {{approach}} to acting, Moore {{said in a}} 2002 interview that she leaves 95 percent of the performance to be discovered on set: [...] "I {{want to have a}} sense of who a character is, and then I want to <b>get</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> have it happen to me on camera." [...] The aim, she said, is to [...] "try to get yourself in a position to let the emotion [...] to you, that you don't bring the emotion to it... and when it happens, there's nothing better or more exciting or more rewarding." ...|$|E
500|$|Actress Jasika Nicole, {{who plays}} junior FBI agent Astrid Farnsworth, {{described}} the episode in a May 2009 interview, [...] "It's about spontaneously combusting. This is the episode I get {{to get out}} of the lab. I remember thinking I can't wait to see what the set's going to look like and how they will make it look when the spontaneous combusting takes place. And we <b>get</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> it's just smoke on the walls, like a kitchen fire. I thought that was so funny because I thought there were going to be body parts everywhere, like a small explosion. But it's a really good episode, which leads you into the coolest parts of the finale episode." ...|$|E

500|$|Executive {{producer}} J. H. Wyman later indicated how [...] "White Tulip" [...] {{helped with}} {{the evolution of the}} show in an interview: [...] "It's very important to constantly try to attract more viewers and to try and not make the show alienating... Our solution {{came in the form of}} ‘White Tulip' and episodes like that, because we realized what we need to do to satiate both our hardcore fans and our financial responsibility is to create a term that we coined a 'mythalone.' It sounds really simple when you say it now, like, ‘Yes, sure, you have a great standalone case, plus you thread in some great mythology.' But I've got to tell you it took us a long time to <b>get</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> realize it. Now we have that our template for telling stories that we think satisfies both parties". He and Pinkner later listed [...] "White Tulip" [...] as one of their favorite episodes.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} in the online {{speculative}} fiction magazine Strange Horizons, Tony Keen was critical of Bear's novel, saying that {{the present and future}} passages [...] "do not mesh terribly well", and that it is [...] "too long" [...] with [...] "too many ideas". He complained that the book was difficult to follow and that Bear keeps [...] "moving the goalposts as it suits his narrative". Keen said that for a science fiction novel, he was surprised at its [...] "lack of consistency", and called it more a work of fantasy than science fiction. He said the [...] "revelations" [...] at the end still did not help explain what had happened, but that [...] "by this point, it was for me hard to care". A {{review in the}} Oakland Tribune complained that Bear, who it felt is not strong on [...] "crafting memorable characters", [...] "struggles" [...] with the novel's multiple viewpoints. The review added that while he [...] "takes a long time to <b>get</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> arrives with a palpable scent of anticlimax, [...] does deliver at the end", although with not enough to satisfy the reviewer.|$|E
500|$|Just {{minutes after}} the game ended, Appalachian State {{students}} began celebrating on the two main streets in Boone, North Carolina: King Street and Rivers Street. The group eventually advanced to Kidd Brewer Stadium, Appalachian State's home field, and tore {{down one of the}} goalposts. The students proceeded to carry the goalpost over a mile before depositing it in the front yard of the school's chancellor, Kenneth E. Peacock. He was fine with this, saying [...] "as good as today was for Appalachian State, they can take it up there and put it down. I can't wait to <b>get</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> see it." [...] Several students jumped nude into the duck pond behind ASU's dining hall, a campus tradition for celebrating big football victories. When the team returned to their stadium in buses at 11:00p.m., they were greeted by a crowd of thousands of students and fans. It took the team 20minutes to get from their buses to the locker room due to the crowd. The celebration in Boone was not limited to Appalachian State's campus; the Boone Mall was [...] "flooded" [...] with cars, and a sports apparel shop carrying ASU gear, Sports Fanatic, reported that sales were seven times higher than normal.|$|E

500|$|The young Alf Ramsey was {{described}} by his friend Fred Tibble as [...] "a very quiet boy who really loved sport". In his 1952 autobiography Talking Football, Ramsey would describe [...] "liv for the open air from the moment I could toddle", spending hours each day in the meadow behind the family cottage, playing ball games with his brothers. He learned skills such as ball control, kicking and heading with a tennis ball. From the age of five, Ramsey attended Becontree Heath School, which had a roll of about 200 pupils aged from four to 14. He and his brothers had to walk two hours from their house to <b>get</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> passed a ball between {{each other on the}} way to break the monotony. Ramsey was not especially popular socially, nor particularly diligent as a student, but he excelled in sports. In addition to football, he played cricket to a high standard and represented the school in the high jump, the long jump, the 100-yard and 200-yard dash. Despite his diminutive stature, he also enjoyed boxing until an incident when he was 10 years old, when a much larger opponent—"as wide as I was tall" [...] in Ramsey's recollection—gave him a severe beating in a school tournament. Ramsey carried a noticeable scar above his mouth, a memento of this fight, {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
500|$|Less than a {{week after}} the election, Douglas wrote to one of her {{supporters}} that she did not think there was anything her campaign could have done to change the result. Blaming the war, voter mistrust of Truman's foreign policy, and high prices at home, Douglas stated that she lost in California because Nixon was able to take {{a large part of the}} women's vote and the labor vote. Later in November, she indicated that liberals must undertake a massive effort to win in 1952. In 1956, she stated in an interview that, while Nixon had never called her a communist, he had designed his whole campaign to create the impression that she was a communist or [...] "communistic". In 1959, she wrote that she had not particularly wanted to be a senator, and in 1962 she stated that the policy of her campaign was to avoid attacks on Nixon. In her memoirs, published posthumously in 1982, she wrote, [...] "Nixon had his victory, but I had mine... He hadn't touched me. I didn't carry Richard Nixon with me, thank God." [...] She concluded her chapter on the 1950 race with, [...] "There's not much to say about the 1950 campaign except that a man ran for Senate who wanted to <b>get</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> didn't care how." ...|$|E
500|$|Dean-Charles Chapman, who portrayed King Tommen Baratheon, {{spoke about}} filming his death scene, saying [...] "I was jumping onto a crash mat. Height-wise, I think if I was {{standing}} on the floor, it was up to my chest. But the crash mat was pretty thick. I must have done that about 50 times. My face was pretty bruised up. My face took it a little bit." [...] Eugene Simon, who portrayed Lancel Lannister, also spoke about his death scene revealing about his discussions with Sapochnik, [...] "the note was when Lancel was dragging his body, {{there was a sense of}} someone who is trying to put aside their pain of being stabbed and being paralyzed as much as possible in order to try to defend what little hope there is left of trying to save the sept and also to save their life. It really only comes down to the very last few nanoseconds of footage that you realize the cause is lost." [...] Simon also stated about the filming of Jonathan Pryce's, who portrays the High Sparrow, final scene, [...] "we had a very big nice round of applause when that took place. I remember that scene very well; we had 200 or so supporting actors in there, all of whom were so committed. They stayed there all day and did wonderful reactions to all the really intense bits. When the first part of the bomb goes off, all of them really, really performed that there was a full-on nuclear explosion going on underneath them." [...] He continued, [...] "We had a big round of applause and celebration after that scene was done because I think we all knew it was going to be pretty monumentous. We said goodbye to countless Tyrells, Kevan Lannister my father, the High Sparrow and dozens of other. It was a pretty extraordinary day." [...] In regards to the non-verbal exchange between Jaime and Cersei Lannister when she is sitting on the Iron Throne, Sapochnik stated [...] "I thought that non-verbal exchange was a very interesting moment but it wasn't clear from the script what exactly Benioff and Weiss wanted. So we just tried a few things, following our noses, drawing from what we knew about these characters and what you see was one of the versions we shot. Interestingly in the edit I still couldn't find a version I felt worked so I actually dropped the moment entirely out of my cut but David and Dan reinstated and to great effect. In fact, I can't really remember the sequence without it anymore. I think he's saying 'don't' and she's saying 'too late.'" [...] He continued [...] "The wonderful thing about filmmaking is you make and remake your film or episode a number of times over the duration of its existence. Firstly in the script stage, second is in prep when you plan how you're going to execute it. Third is in production when you actually <b>get</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> have to change everything and finally, in the edit, when you realize what you thought something meant means something totally different when put before or after another juxtaposing or complimentary image." ...|$|E

2500|$|Twilight frets how {{to escape}} the trap in time before realizing that the only {{solution}} is to have Spike deliver the Heart to the ponies below, even though she believes this will cause her to fail her test to Celestia. Spike races ahead of King Sombra's attacks, but falls off with the Heart. Shining Armor throws Cadance at Spike and the Heart; she catches both in time before King Sombra can <b>get</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> glides down {{to the base of}} the castle, the Crystal Heart restoring both her strength and magic. Quickly placing the Heart in its proper place, Cadance addresses the Crystal Ponies as their princess and instructs them to power the Heart. The positive feelings from the ponies cause the Heart to be recharged, and King Sombra shatters, causing him to explode [...] With the Heart restored, the Crystal ponies regain their crystalline appearance, and the effect extends to Princess Cadance, Shining Armor, and Twilight and her friends, while they remain in the city.|$|E
2500|$|The Scotiabank Saddledome {{was one of}} many {{buildings}} impacted by the 2013 Alberta floods. [...] The flooding of the Elbow and Bow Rivers swamped many areas of the city, including Stampede Park where the Saddledome is located. [...] The event level of the arena was reported to be filled with water up to the 10th row of seating and the dressing rooms and control room for the video replay screen were under water. At a press conference held on June 22, 2013, team president Ken King stated that the arena had flooded up to the eighth row and that the event level of the facility was a [...] "total loss." [...] He added that the team's equipment and some memorabilia had also been destroyed, but expressed confidence that the facility would be repaired and ready in time for the October start to the season. Prospect Ben Hanowski was among the 100,000 people forced to evacuate by the floods. He described the situation as [...] "almost terrifying," [...] but praised the city's community spirit in the disaster: [...] "I didn’t know how I was going to get [...] I didn’t know if I could get a rental car out of the garage and through some water to get up here, and I had a person come up to me right away and ask if I had a place to go and if I had a way to <b>get</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> basically offered me a ride somewhere. I’d never met the person before. I think that example, right there, kind of speaks to what the city of Calgary is all about." ...|$|E
