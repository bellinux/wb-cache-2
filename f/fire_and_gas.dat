25|$|The 46th Division {{had been}} very unlucky during the war, the {{infantry}} in particular taking appalling casualties at the Hohenzollern Redoubt and Gommecourt, but it gained revenge at the Battle of the St Quentin Canal on 29 September 1918 when it performed {{one of the great}} feats of the First World War by crossing the canal and breaking open the Hindenburg Line. Careful artillery preparation and support {{was an integral part of}} this success. Hill Child had nine brigades of field artillery under his command, including CCXXXI Brigade, and several brigades of corps heavy artillery were also firing on the division's front. The bombardment began on the night of 26/27 September with harassing <b>fire</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> shells, followed with intense bombardment with high explosive shells until the morning of the assault. Every field gun was used in carefully timed barrages: 'creeping barrages' (including smoke shells) ahead of the attacking troops, with pauses at the end of each phase, including a 'standing barrage' of three hours to allow mopping-up of the first objectives to be carried out, and the second wave of troops to pass through and renew the attack behind the creeping barrage. The first of these creeping barrages actually progressed at twice the normal pace while the infantry rushed downhill to seize the canal crossings; it was described in the Official History as 'one of the finest ever seen'.|$|E
2500|$|Alongside the {{potential}} for gains in combat experience it is also thought that various strategic initiatives were first tried as part of Luftwaffe involvement in the conflict. Theories on strategic bombing were first developed by the Luftwaffe with the first exhibition of [...] "carpet bombing" [...] in the September 1937 Asturias campaign. Comparisons between the raid on Guernica {{and the fate of}} other cities during the conflict are also telling. As the fighting progressed into March 1938 Italian pilots flying as Aviazione Legionaria under Field Marshal Hugo Sperrle were involved in thirteen raids against Barcelona involving <b>fire</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> bombs.|$|E

5000|$|The {{technical}} report provides two primary guidance efforts. The {{first is the}} development of a lifecycle for the performance based design on <b>Fire</b> <b>and</b> <b>Gas</b> systems. This safety lifecycle includes the steps required to design a functionally safe <b>fire</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> system, along with establishing the requirements of each of the steps. The {{technical report}} also defines the two metrics that define the effectiveness of <b>fire</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> systems (as opposed to the single metric of safety integrity level (SIL) that is employed for safety instrumented systems (SIS)). These two metrics are coverage and safety availability.The coverage of a <b>fire</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> detection array is defined in two ways. Geographic coverage and scenario coverage. The geographic coverage is the fraction of the area of given elevation of interest where if a fire or a gas release were to occur (i.e., be centered) the fire or gas release would be detected by the <b>fire</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> detection array. Geographic coverage is only concerned with the location and performance attributes of detection equipment and obstructions to the [...] "view" [...] of the equipment. Scenario coverage, on the other hand, is defined as the fraction of fire or gas release scenarios that if they were to occur, would be detected by the <b>fire</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> detection array. Scenario coverage considers not only the location and attributes of the <b>fire</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> detection equipment, but also considers the location, frequency, and dimensions of the fires and gas releases that can occur in a process facility. While scenario coverage provides a richer understanding of the performance of a <b>fire</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> detection system, it also is more resource consuming to calculate.|$|E

50|$|In 2006, the ISA 84 {{committee}} {{developed a}} working group to study {{the issue of how}} <b>fire</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> systems should be treated with respect to the IEC 61511 standard for safety instrumented systems. Many industry practitioners were having trouble utilizing the IEC 61511 standard for the design of <b>fire</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> systems for two reasons: <b>fire</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> systems are not 100% effective in detecting fires and gas releases (i.e., coverage is not 100%), and even if a fire or gas release is detected, the consequences of the incident are not prevented, they are only reduced (i.e., mitigative). As a result, the techniques and metrics shown in IEC 61511 are not adequate to perform <b>fire</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> system design. The ISA 84 committee formed {{a working group}} to study the issue. In 2010, this working group released the first version of the ISA 84.00.07 technical report that laid out new techniques and metrics that were required to effectively design FGS systems using the performance based techniques that underpin the IEC 61511 standard.|$|E
