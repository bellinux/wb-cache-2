Resulting field strengths for harmonic emission are found to be consistent with typical International Sun Earth Explorer 3 (ISSE 3) observations at 1 AU. <b>Fundamental</b> <b>emission</b> at 1 AU is found to proceed only when stimulated by the presence of a source of ion sound waves. However, it is argued that electrostatic decay of Langmuir waves can supply the necessary waves provided the driving electron beam is sufficiently fast. Under these conditions, the predicted fundamental field strengths can account for both the highest and typical fields observed; they also dominate the predicted harmonic fields, consistent with observations. This mechanism is also consistent with previous observations that <b>fundamental</b> <b>emission</b> generally occurs early in type III events, when the beam is fastest. For typical parameters it is shown that neither fundamental nor harmonic emission saturates its respective source instability, contrary to previous assumptions.

40|$|The {{polarization}} {{characteristics of}} zebra patterns (ZPs) in type IV solar bursts were studied. We analyzed 21 ZP events observed by the Assembly of Metric-band Aperture Telescope and Real-time Analysis System between 2010 and 2015 and identified the following characteristics: {{a degree of}} circular polarization (DCP) {{in the range of}} 0 %- 70 %, a temporal delay of 0 - 70 ms between the two circularly polarized components (i. e., the right- and left-handed components), and dominant ordinary-mode emission in about 81 % of the events. For most events, the relation between the dominant and delayed components could be interpreted in the framework of <b>fundamental</b> plasma <b>emission</b> and depolarization during propagation, though the values of DCP and delay were distributed across wide ranges. Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} DCP and delay were positively correlated (rank correlation coefficient R = 0. 62). As a possible interpretation of this relationship, we considered a model based on depolarization due to reflections at sharp density boundaries assuming <b>fundamental</b> plasma <b>emission.</b> The model calculations of depolarization including multiple reflections and group delay during propagation in the inhomogeneous corona showed that the DCP and delay decreased as the number of reflections increased, which is consistent with the observational results. The dispersive polarization characteristics could be explained by the different numbers of reflections causing depolarization. Comment: 27 pages, 8 figures, published in Ap...|$|R

40|$|Residual gas in disks around {{young stars}} can spin down stars, {{circularize}} {{the orbits of}} terrestrial planets, and whisk away the dusty debris {{that is expected to}} serve as a signpost of terrestrial planet formation. We have carried out a sensitive search for residual gas and dust in the terrestrial planet region surrounding young stars ranging in age from a few Myr to ~ 10 Myr in age. Using high resolution 4. 7 micron spectra of transition objects and weak T Tauri stars, we searched for weak continuum excesses and CO <b>fundamental</b> <b>emission,</b> after making a careful correction for the stellar contribution to the observed spectrum. We find that the CO emission from transition objects is weaker and located further from the star than CO emission from non-transition T Tauri stars with similar stellar accretion rates. The difference is possibly the result of chemical and/or dynamical effects (i. e., a low CO abundance or close-in low-mass planets). The weak T Tauri stars show no CO <b>fundamental</b> <b>emission</b> down to low flux levels (5 x 10 ^(- 20) - 10 ^{- 18 } W/m^ 2).

Predictions from this model are compared in detail with particle, Langmuir wave, and radio data from the International Sun Earth Explorer- 3 (ISSE- 3) spacecraft and with other observations to clarify the roles of <b>fundamental</b> and harmonic <b>emission</b> in type III radio bursts.

Local electromagnetic emission sets in only after Langmuir waves are seen, in accord with the standard theory, which relies on nonlinear processes involving Langmuir waves. In the events investigated here, fundamental radiation appears to dominate early in the event, followed and/or accompanied by harmonic radiation after the peak, with a long-lived tail of multiply scattered <b>fundamental</b> or harmonic <b>emission</b> extending long afterwards.

40|$|Young circumstellar disks {{that are}} still {{embedded}} in dense molecular envelopes may differ from their older counterparts, but are historically difficult to study because emission from a disk can be confused with envelope or outflow emission. CO <b>fundamental</b> <b>emission</b> is a potentially powerful probe of the disk/wind structure within a few AU of young protostars. In this paper, we present high spectral (R= 90, 000) and spatial (0. 3 ") resolution VLT/CRIRES M-band spectra of 18 low-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) with dense envelopes in nearby star-froming regions to explore the utility of CO fundamental 4. 6 micron emission as a probe of very young disks. CO <b>fundamental</b> <b>emission</b> is detected from 14 of the YSOs in our sample. The emission line profiles show a range of strengths and shapes, but can generally be classified into a broad, warm component and a narrow, cool component. The broad CO emission is detected more frequently from YSOs with bolometric luminosities of 15 Lsun, and as with CO emission from CTTSs is attributed to the warm (~ 1000 K) inner AU of the disk. The CO emission from objects with high bolometric luminosity is produced in cooler (~ 320 K), narrow lines in 12 CO and in rarer isotopologues. From some objects, the narrow lines are blueshifted by up to ~ 10 km/s, indicating a slow wind origin. For other sources the lines are located at the systemic velocity of the star and likely arise in the disk. For a few YSOs, spatially-extended CO and H 2 S(9) emission is detected up to 2 " from the central source and is attributed to interactions between the wind and surrounding molecular material. Warm CO absorption is detected in the wind of six objects with velocities up to 100 km/s, often in discrete velocity components. That the wind is partially molecular where it is launched favors ejection in a disk wind rather than a coronal or chromospheric wind. Comment: 26 pages, accepted by A&...|$|E
30|$|White {{electroluminescence}} from {{a single}} emitting layer device {{can be achieved by}} two methods: blending polymers with two complementary or three <b>fundamental</b> <b>emission</b> colors, or doping a wide energy gap host material with small percentages of lower energy phosphorescent emitters. Both methods are suitable for low cost large area WOLED fabrication since combining multiple color emission in a single layer allows easy processing from solution or evaporation techniques. However, a careful control of morphology and composition of the emitting layer is fundamental to manage energy transfer processes responsible for white light output. The major drawback of this approach versus that based on stacked emitting layers is that it is more difficult to compensate the differential aging of emitters blended with a precise molar ratio in a single emitting layer. In particular, in WOLEDs made of binary or ternary blends, the control of emitters ratio is less critical than in doped systems but, their efficiency and brightness are lower since singlet emitters are generally used.|$|E
40|$|The {{radiation}} emission mechanism {{responsible for}} both type-II and type-III solar radio bursts is commonly accepted as plasma emission.
