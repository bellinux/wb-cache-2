5|$|Between 1594 and 1603, Elizabeth <b>faced</b> <b>her</b> {{most severe}} test in Ireland during the Nine Years' War, a revolt {{that took place}} at the height of {{hostilities}} with Spain, who backed the rebel leader, Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone. In spring 1599, Elizabeth sent Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, to put the revolt down. To her frustration, he made little progress and returned to England in defiance of her orders. He was replaced by Charles Blount, Lord Mountjoy, who took three years to defeat the rebels. O'Neill finally surrendered in 1603, a few days after Elizabeth's death. Soon afterwards, a peace treaty was signed between England and Spain.|$|E
5|$|She wore an {{imported}} black satin dress heavily beaded {{with tiny}} black jet beads, black satin slippers, beaded, and {{had on her}} rarely beautiful diamonds.... She stood before us, seemingly slight, graceful of carriage, and exquisitely beautiful even to critical eyes. Then, still standing, she <b>faced</b> <b>her</b> class as one who knew herself {{to be a teacher}} by divine right. She turned to the student {{at the end of the}} first row of seats and took direct mental cognizance of this one, plainly knocked at the door of this individual consciousness.... This continued until each member of the class had received the same mental cognizance. No audible word voiced the purely mental contact.|$|E

500|$|In season three, Abby {{sets her}} {{sights on the}} wealthy Gary Ewing, the husband of her good friend Valene Ewing. While Gary {{initially}} thwarted her attempts, he eventually gave in and had a full-fledged affair with her. Actress Joan Van Ark, who played Val, said: [...] "I went in way early, whenever Donna Mills came on the show, and told David Jacobs that it made total sense that Gary would fall for Abby. Because they were celebrating Donna Mills and she became the center I can’t believe I did that but it really provided us with some great stories. And it was the longest running story on the show." [...] Dan Lewis of the Sarasota Journal said, [...] "In a recent episode, Abby lures Gary Ewing into an affair, and sets it up so that his wife will discover it. After she completed the scene, Miss Mills recalls, the crew hissing at her – jokingly, of course." [...] The character was known for her numerous rivalries with other female characters, such as Paige and Karen. Carole Glinez said, [...] "Mills' character <b>faced</b> <b>her</b> rival Paige, played by future Desperate Housewives sexpot Nicollette Sheridan." ...|$|E
500|$|LayCool {{faced the}} WWE Women's Champion Beth Phoenix in a two-on-one {{handicap}} match on the 14 May episode of SmackDown. Layla pinned Phoenix {{to win the}} Women's Championship for the first time, becoming the first British woman to hold the title. Following her win, LayCool began calling themselves the co-Women's Champions. On 1 June, {{it was announced that}} LayCool would be mentoring Kaval during the second season of NXT. On 18 July, Layla had her first title defense when she defeated Kelly Kelly at the Money in the Bank. On 30 July, SmackDown General Manager Theodore Long informed LayCool that there was only one Women's Champion, and they had a week to decide who it would be. The following week, LayCool revealed that they had cut the title belt into two, turning it into a friendship charm and circumventing Long's orders. In September, Layla and McCool challenged WWE Divas Champion Melina to a championship unification match at Night of Champions. McCool participated in the match and won, with Layla's help, to unify both title into the WWE Unified Divas Championship. Layla unofficially became the co-champion, and defended the title against Melina the following night on Raw.

Following Survivor Series, Natalya and Phoenix formed an alliance to continue the feud with LayCool, and at the [...] in December, LayCool lost to them in the first Diva's tag team tables match in WWE. LayCool invoked their rematch clause in January 2011, prompting the scheduling of a two-on-one handicap match for the Royal Rumble. At the event however, the anonymous Raw General Manager altered the match to a fatal four-way, also involving Eve Torres who went to win the title.|$|E

2500|$|Martin <b>faced</b> <b>her</b> first electoral test {{as leader}} at the 2001 election. At the time, the Country Liberal Party had held office for 27 years, and Labor had never come {{particularly}} close to government. [...] Indeed, it had never managed to win more than nine seats at any election. However, the ALP was coming off a particularly successful eighteen months, and Martin ran a skilled campaign. She was also {{able to take advantage}} of a number of gaffes made by then-Chief Minister Denis Burke, such as the decision to preference One Nation over the ALP – which lost the CLP a number of votes in crucial Darwin seats. [...] The election also came during a bad time for the federal Coalition government, which was under fire for introducing a GST after previously vowing not to do so.|$|E
