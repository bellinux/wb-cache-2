40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we focus on}} a certain self-distributive {{multiplication}} on coalgebras, which leads to so-called rack bialgebra. Inspired by semi-group theory (adapting the Suschkewitsch theorem), we do some structure theory for rack bialgebras and cocommutative Hopf dialgebras. We also construct canonical rack bialgebras (some kind of enveloping algebras) for any Leibniz algebra and compare to the existing constructions. We are motivated by a differential geometric procedure which we call the Serre functor: To a pointed differentible manifold with multiplication is associated its distribution space supported in the chosen point. For Lie groups, it is well-known that {{this leads to the}} universal enveloping algebra of the Lie algebra. For Lie racks, we get rack-bialgebras, for Lie <b>digroups,</b> we obtain cocommutative Hopf dialgebras. The canonical rack bialgebras we have constructed for any Leibniz algebra lead then to a simple explicit formula of the rack-star-product on the dual of a Leibniz algebra recently constructed by Dherin and Wagemann in 2013. We clarify this framework doing some deformation theory. Comment: 76 page...|$|R

The main result of this paper is that every <b>digroup</b> is isomorphic to a transformation <b>digroup.</b> The notion of a <b>digroup</b> we shall use in this paper was introduced in Chapter 6 of [6]. Its special case, which is {{the notion of a}} <b>digroup</b> with an identity, was introduced independently by people who work in different areas of mathematics ([1], [3] and [5]). After reviewing some basic definitions about digroups in Section 1, we introduce in Section 2 the notion of a symmetric <b>digroup</b> on the Cartesian product ∆ × Γ, where ∆ and Γ are two sets. If |∆ | = 1, then a symmetric <b>digroup</b> on ∆ ×Γ becomes the symmetric group on the set Γ, where |∆ | denotes the cardinality of ∆. In Section 3 we prove that every <b>digroup</b> is isomorphic a subdigroup of a symmetric <b>digroup,</b> which is a better counterpart of Cayley’s Theorem in the context of digroups. 1 The Notion of a <b>Digroup</b> The following definition of a <b>digroup</b> is a version of Definition 6. 1 of [6]. Definition 1. 1 A nonempty set G is called a <b>digroup</b> if there are two binary operations ⇀ · and ↼ · on G such that the following three properties are satisfied. (i) (The Diassociative Law) The two operations ⇀ · and ↼ · are diassociative; that is, x ⇀ · (y ⇀ · z) = (x ⇀ · y) ⇀ · z = x ⇀ · (y ↼ · z), (1) 1 for all x, y, z ∈ G. (x ↼ · y) ⇀ · z = x ↼ · (y ⇀ · z), (2) (x ⇀ · y) ↼ · z = (x ↼ · y) ↼ · z = x ↼ · (y ↼ · z) (3) (ii) (Bar-unit) There is an element e of G such that for all x ∈ G. x ⇀ · e = x = e ↼ · x (4) (iii) (One-sided Inverses) For each element x in G, there exist two elements x ℓ − 1 e and x...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The “coquecigrue ” {{problem for}} Leibniz algebras {{is that of}} finding an {{appropriate}} generalization of Lie’s third theorem, that is, of finding a generalization {{of the notion of}} group such that Leibniz algebras are the corresponding tangent algebra structures.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this note}} I will {{describe}} a simple, but non-trivial, explicit {{example of a}} solution to the “coquecigrue ” problem of Loday. More precisely, a Leibniz algebra structure will be defined on R 4, and therefrom a <b>digroup</b> contained in this space, whose tangent space at the unit element inherits the original Leibniz algebra structure. This illustrates both, the properties that might be expected from the coquecigrues, and the difficulties still remaining in the full understanding of the problem. Introduction. The “coquecigrue ” problem of Loday may be thought of as the analog in the context of Leibniz algebras to Lie’s third problem. That is to say, given a Leibniz algebra, one wishes to construct a manifold possessing also an algebraic structure, {{in such a way that}} its tangent space at some distinguished point inherits the structur...|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the notions of}} one-sided dirings, 3 -irreducible left modules, 3 -primitive left dirings, 3 -semi-primitive left dirings, 3 -p rimitive ideals and 3 -radicals. The main results consists of two parts. The fi rst part establishes two external characterizations of a 3 -semi-primitive left diring. The second part characterizes the 3 -radical of a left diring by using 3 -primitive ideals. By forgetting some structures of a 7 -tuple introduced in Chapter 4 of [3], we get three roads of generalizing {{the notion of a}} ring R. The first one is to keep the additive group structure of R and to replace the multiplicative monoid structure of R by a dimonoid with a one-sided bar-unit. The second one is to replace the additive group structure of R by a commutative <b>digroup</b> and to keep the multiplicative monoid structure of R. The third one is to replace the additive group structure of R by a commutative <b>digroup</b> and to replace the multiplicative monoid structure of R by a dimonoid with a one-sided bar-unit. Although {{we do not know how}} far we can go along the third road now, the first two roads are good enough to develop the counterpart of the basic ring theory. The purpose of this paper is to study the counterpart of the Jacobson radical for rings along the first road. This paper consists of five sections. In Section 1 we {{introduce the}} notion of a one-sided diring and discusses its basic properties. In Section 2 we consider so me fundamental concepts and results about a left module over a left diring. In S ection 3 we introduce the notion of a 3 -irreducible left module and prove that Schur Lemma is still true for 3 -irreducible left modules over a left diring. In Section 4 we introduce the notions of 3 -primitive left dirings and 3 -semi-primitive left dirings, and establish two external characterizations of a 3 -s emiprimitive left diring. In Section 5 we introduce the notion of the 3 -radic al of a left diring by using the intersection of the annihilators of all 3 -irr educible left R-modules, and prove that the 3 -radical of a left diring R is equal to the intersection of the 3 -primitive ideals of R. 1...|$|E
