5|$|Carroll had {{considered}} {{running for the}} U.S. Senate in 1968, but {{dropped out of the}} race after just two weeks when he discovered that it would take well over $100,000 to run a competitive primary campaign. In 1971, former governor Bert T. Combs sought a second term as <b>governor</b> <b>and</b> chose Carroll as his informal running mate. (The <b>governor</b> <b>and</b> lieutenant governor were elected separately at the time.) Combs, an Eastern Kentucky native, sought geographic balance for the ticket by selecting Carroll, from the far-west Jackson Purchase. Combs said he would provide the needed financing, and Carroll agreed to enter the race.|$|E
5|$|Kentucky {{is one of}} {{only five}} U.S. states to hold gubernatorial {{elections}} in odd-numbered years—commonly called an off-year election. Louisiana, Mississippi, Virginia, and New Jersey also hold off-year gubernatorial elections. The general election for <b>governor</b> <b>and</b> lieutenant governor is held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The <b>governor</b> <b>and</b> lieutenant governor are inaugurated on the fifth Tuesday after their election. This was changed from the fourth Tuesday after the election by the 1850 constitution.|$|E

5|$|The {{office of}} {{lieutenant}} governor {{was created in}} 1868, abolished in 1875, and recreated in 1901. According to the current constitution, should the governor {{be out of the}} state for more than 20 days, the lieutenant governor becomes acting <b>governor,</b> <b>and</b> if the office of governor becomes vacant the lieutenant governor ascends to the governorship. Earlier constitutions said the powers of the governor devolved upon the successor, rather than them necessarily becoming governor, but the official listing includes these as full governors. The <b>governor</b> <b>and</b> lieutenant governor are not elected on the same ticket.|$|E

5|$|Under the {{original}} {{terms of the}} state constitution, the lieutenant governor was elected for a two-year term on a separate ticket from the governor; because of this, the <b>Governor</b> <b>and</b> Lieutenant Governor of Wisconsin {{have not always been}} of the same party. After a 1967 amendment, however, the two have been nominated, and voted upon, as a single ticket. Another 1967 amendment increased the terms of both the <b>governor</b> <b>and</b> lieutenant governor to four years. There is no limit to the number of terms a lieutenant governor may hold.|$|E

5|$|As the {{celebrations}} {{in honor of}} Scott's military career continued across Kentucky, he began {{to consider the possibility}} of running for governor in 1808. By mid-1806, state senator Thomas Posey and Lexington lawyer Thomas Todd had already declared their candidacies. Posey had been chosen speaker pro tem of the state Senate and, with the death of Lieutenant Governor John Caldwell in 1804, had assumed the role of acting lieutenant <b>governor</b> <b>and</b> presiding officer in the Senate. He subsequently lost his senatorial re-election bid, but continued to act as lieutenant <b>governor</b> <b>and</b> preside over the Senate. His opponents claimed that since he was no longer a member of the Senate, he was not qualified to act as lieutenant governor; additionally, they charged that he was sympathetic to the hated Federalist Party, even though he self-identified as a Democratic-Republican. Although he was not successfully unseated as the Senate's presiding officer, the controversy diminished his chances in the 1808 election. In 1807, Todd removed himself from contention as well, accepting Governor Greenup's appointment to the Kentucky Court of Appeals.|$|E
