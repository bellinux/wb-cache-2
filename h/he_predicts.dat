5|$|That night, Black is {{kidnapped by}} the group of natives. He is taken to the sewers and forced to consume snake venom; he sees visions, but insists they are from his psychic gift {{rather than from the}} venom. <b>He</b> <b>predicts</b> that the native tribes will reunite and that the buffalo will return to New York. However, he is soon rescued by Michaels and a group of police, who place Reynard and his tribe under arrest. As the tribe—now reunited in police custody—are led away, a {{travelling}} rodeo loses track of four buffalo, which run free through the city streets.|$|E
25|$|Kurzweil {{explains}} that in 1999 computers {{are essential to}} most facets of life, yet <b>he</b> <b>predicts</b> no major disruption related to the then-pending Y2K problem. He says computers are narrow-minded and brittle so far, but suggests in specific domains they are showing signs of intelligence. As examples Kurzweil cites computer generated or assisted music, and tools for the automatic or semi-automatic production of literature or poetry. He shows examples of paintings by AARON as programmed by Harold Cohen which can be automatically created. Kurzweil reviews some of his predictions from The Age of Intelligent Machines and various past presentations, and is very pleased with his record. Finally <b>he</b> <b>predicts</b> a new Luddite movement as intelligent machines take away jobs, although <b>he</b> <b>predicts</b> {{a net gain of}} new and better jobs.|$|E

25|$|The show {{is known}} for its {{prediction}} segment that appears {{at the end of each}} broadcast. Typically there are four predictors: Corso, Herbstreit, Howard, and an invited guest, usually a celebrity, prominent athlete, or radio personality associated with the host school for that week. The show always concludes with Corso's prediction for the host school's game, after which he dons the mascot's headgear of the team <b>he</b> <b>predicts</b> to win the game, usually to the ire or excitement of local fans.|$|E
25|$|From 1992 to 2002, {{he worked}} on his {{controversial}} book A New Kind of Science, which presents an empirical study of very simple computational systems. Additionally, it argues that for fundamental reasons these types of systems, rather than traditional mathematics, are needed to model and understand complexity in nature. Wolfram's conclusion is {{that the universe is}} digital in its nature, and runs on fundamental laws which can be described as simple programs. <b>He</b> <b>predicts</b> that a realization of this within the scientific communities will have a major and revolutionary influence on physics, chemistry and biology and the majority of the scientific areas in general, which is the reason for the book's title.|$|E

25|$|Thorstein Eriksson {{resolves}} {{to go to}} Vinland for {{the body}} of his brother. The same ship is prepared yet again and Thorstein sets sail with a crew of 25 and his wife Gudrid (ON: Guðríðr). The expedition never reaches Vinland and after sailing the whole summer, the ship ends up back at the coast of Greenland. During the winter, Thorstein falls ill and dies but speaks out of his dead body and tells the fortune of his wife Gudrid. <b>He</b> <b>predicts</b> that Gudrid will marry an Icelander and have {{a long line of}} “promising, bright and fine, sweet and well-scented” descendants. Thorstein also predicts that she will leave Greenland for Norway and from there she will set out for Iceland. She will, however, live so long that she outlives her husband. Once her husband passes, Thorstein foresaw, she would travel abroad once again, going south on a pilgrimage and then return to her farm in Iceland. When she returns, a church will be built. From the time it is built until she dies, she will remain there and take holy orders.|$|E
25|$|Future {{contracts}} are another way our farmer can hedge his risk without {{a few of}} the risks that forward contracts have. Future {{contracts are}} similar to forward contracts except they are more standardized (i.e. each contract is the same quantity and date for everyone). These contracts trade on exchanges and are guaranteed through clearinghouses. Clearinghouses ensure that every contract is honored and they take the opposite side of every contract. Future contracts typically are more liquid than forward contracts and move with the market. Because of this, the farmer can minimize the risk he faces in the future through the selling of future contracts. Future contracts also differ from forward contracts in that delivery never happens. The exchanges and clearinghouses allow the buyer or seller to leave the contract early and cash out. So tying back into the farmer selling his wheat at a future date, he will sell short futures contracts for the amount that <b>he</b> <b>predicts</b> to harvest to protect against a price decrease. The current (spot) price of wheat and the price of the futures contracts for wheat converge as time gets closer to the delivery date, so in order to make money on the hedge, the farmer must close out his position earlier than then. On the chance that prices decrease in the future, the farmer will make a profit on his short position in the futures market which offsets any decrease in revenues from the spot market for wheat. On the other hand, if prices increase, the farmer will generate a loss on the futures market which is offset by an increase in revenues on the spot market for wheat. Instead of agreeing to sell his wheat to one person on a set date, the farmer will just buy and sell futures on an exchange and then sell his wheat wherever he wants once he harvests it.|$|E
500|$|Kaczynski {{states that}} {{technology}} {{has had a}} destabilizing effect on society, has made life unfulfilling and has caused widespread psychological suffering. He argues that because of technological advances, most people spend their time engaged in useless pursuits which he calls [...] "surrogate activities", wherein people strive towards artificial goals. Examples he gives of surrogate activities include scientific work, consumption of entertainment and following sports teams. <b>He</b> <b>predicts</b> that further technological advances will lead to extensive human genetic engineering and that human beings will be adjusted {{to meet the needs}} of the social systems, rather than vice versa. He believes that technological progress can be stopped, unlike others who he says understand some of its negative effects yet passively accept it as inevitable, and calls for a return to [...] "wild nature".|$|E

500|$|After {{two and a}} {{half years}} of training, Sasuke tries to kill a {{weakened}} Orochimaru before he can take possession of his younger body. After Orochimaru's defeat, he proceeds with his goal to kill Itachi, Sasuke forms team Hebi and tracks him down. They fight, but at the climax of the battle Itachi dies from a preexisting illness. After the battle, Sasuke meets Itachi's superior, Tobi, who reveals that Itachi killed the Uchiha under the orders of Konohagakure and spared Sasuke out of love, not contempt. Sasuke reunites with Hebi, which he renames [...] "Taka", and declares his intention to destroy Hidden Leaf village in retribution. By now, his Sharingan has evolved into a Mangekyo Sharingan, giving Sasuke powerful new techniques. After agreeing to work temporarily for Akatsuki, Sasuke becomes a criminal. During this time, Sasuke kills one of the masterminds behind the Uchiha Massacre, Danzo Shimura, who was acting as the Hokage, the leader of Konohagakure. Sasuke is then confronted by his former teammates from Team 7, and Naruto challenges him to a final fight sometime in the future, when <b>he</b> <b>predicts</b> that they will both die if he fails to stop his actions. Soon after, Sasuke asks Tobi to transplant Itachi's eyes, which restores his eyesight and gives him eternal Mangekyo Sharingan.|$|E
500|$|Kaczynski {{argues that}} erosion {{of human freedom}} is a natural product of {{industrial}} society because [...] "he system has to regulate human behavior closely in order to function," [...] and that reform {{of the system is}} impossible as [...] "hanges large enough to make a lasting difference in favor of freedom would not be initiated because it would be realized that they would gravely disrupt the system." [...] However, he states that the system has not yet fully achieved [...] "control over human behavior" [...] and [...] "is currently engaged in a desperate struggle to overcome certain problems that threaten its survival." [...] <b>He</b> <b>predicts</b> that [...] "f the system succeeds in acquiring sufficient control over human behavior quickly enough, it will probably survive. Otherwise it will break down," [...] and that [...] "the issue will most likely be resolved within the next several decades, say 40 to 100 years." [...] Kaczynski therefore states that the task of those who oppose industrial society is to promote [...] "social stress and instability," [...] and to propagate [...] "an ideology that opposes technology," [...] one that offers the [...] "counter-ideal" [...] of nature [...] "in order to gain enthusiastic support." [...] Thus, when industrial society is sufficiently unstable, [...] "a revolution against technology may be possible." ...|$|E
500|$|There {{has been}} {{substantial}} criticism over the austerity measures implemented by most European nations to counter this debt crisis. US economist and Nobel laureate Paul Krugman argues that an abrupt return to [...] "'non-Keynesian' financial policies" [...] {{is not a}} viable solution. Pointing at historical evidence, <b>he</b> <b>predicts</b> that deflationary policies now being imposed on countries such as Greece and Spain will prolong and deepen their recessions. Together with over 9,000 signatories of [...] "A Manifesto for Economic Sense" [...] Krugman also dismissed the belief of austerity focusing policy makers such as EU economic commissioner Olli Rehn and most European finance ministers that [...] "budget consolidation" [...] revives confidence in financial markets over the longer haul. In a 2003 study that analysed 133 IMF austerity programmes, the IMF's independent evaluation office found that policy makers consistently underestimated the disastrous effects of rigid spending cuts on economic growth. In early 2012 an IMF official, who negotiated Greek austerity measures, admitted that spending cuts were harming Greece. In October 2012, the IMF said that its forecasts for countries which implemented austerity programmes have been consistently overoptimistic, suggesting that tax hikes and spending cuts have been doing more damage than expected, and countries which implemented fiscal stimulus, such as Germany and Austria, did better than expected. Also Portugal did comparably better than Spain. The latter introduced drastic austerity measures but was unable not meet its EU budget deficit targets. On the other hand, Portugal's leftist coalition fought austerity (it increased the minimum wage by 25 percent and took back cuts in the pension system and the public sector) {{and at the same}} time reduced its budget deficit to below three percent in 2016. According to historian Florian Schui from University of St. Gallen no austerity program has ever worked. Schui particularly notes Winston Churchill's attempt in 1925 and Heinrich Brüning's attempt in 1930 during the Weimar Republic. Both led to disastrous consequences.|$|E

Similarly in 2009 he says there is interest and speculation about the Turing test, by 2019 there are [...] "prevalent reports" [...] of computers passing the test, but not rigorously, while by 2029 machines [...] "routinely" [...] pass the test, although there is still controversy about how machine and human intelligence compare.|$|E
