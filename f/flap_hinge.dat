Silva publicly announced that certification would be complete in June 2010 and that he was seeking funding for the stages beyond that, including production. By June 2010 the flight testing had just commenced with re-instrumentation and solving a landing gear door flutter issue. By the end of 2010 certification flight testing had identified two problem areas, loss of rudder effectiveness in power-off spins and lack of flap effectiveness. The former problem was to be addressed with stick shaker and stick pusher systems, labeled the Stall Prevention System, and the latter with revised <b>flap</b> <b>hinge</b> geometry to achieve a more effective slot.

40|$|The Active Aeroelastic Wing {{airplane}} {{was successfully}} flight-tested in March 2005. During phase 1 of the two-phase program, an onboard excitation system provided independent control surface movements {{that were used}} to develop a loads model for the wing structure and wing control surfaces. The resulting loads model, which was used to develop the control laws for phase 2, is described. The loads model was developed from flight data {{through the use of a}} multiple linear regression technique. The loads model input consisted of aircraft states and control surface positions, in addition to nonlinear inputs that were calculated from flight-measured parameters. The loads model output for each wing consisted of wing-root bending moment and torque, wing-fold bending moment and torque, inboard and outboard leading-edge <b>flap</b> <b>hinge</b> moment, trailing-edge <b>flap</b> <b>hinge</b> moment, and aileron hinge moment. The development of the Active Aeroelastic Wing loads model is described, and the ability of the model to predict loads during phase 2 research maneuvers is demonstrated. Results show a good match to phase 2 flight data for all loads except inboard and outboard leading-edge <b>flap</b> <b>hinge</b> moments at certain flight conditions.

40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} {{the effect of}} prolonging the standard suction duration during laser-assisted in-situ keratomileusis (LASIK) {{and its effect on}} flap thickness and hinge length using sub-Bowman keratomileusis (SBK) microkeratome. Methods: Fifty-six eyes (28 patients) were included and divided into 2 groups; Group-A: eyes with flatter corneas (36 eyes, 18 patients) and mean keratometric readings ranging from 40. 13 to 43. 71 diopters (D). Group-B: eyes with steeper corneas (20 eyes, 10 patients) with mean keratometric readings ranging from 43. 85 to 46. 72  D. One-Use-Plus SBK microkeratome was used for flap creation. For right eyes, flap was created immediately once suction was built up. In left eyes, the surgeon waited for 10  s after suction was built up before flap creation. <b>Flap</b> <b>hinge</b> length and flap thickness were measured using surgical caliper and ultrasonic pachymetry, respectively. Results: Statistically significant differences were observed in corneal <b>flap</b> <b>hinge</b> size between right eyes versus left eyes, with a mean of 3. 98  ±  0. 48 vs. 3. 78  ±  0. 55  mm (p <  0. 001). Mean flap thickness in both eyes did not prove to be statistically significantly different with either surgical technique (90. 2  ±  1. 68 vs. 90. 07  ±  1. 44  μm, p =  0. 8). Sub-group analysis of Group-A vs. Group-B revealed hinge sizes that were significantly larger in steeper corneas (p <  0. 01 and p <  0. 05, respectively). However, flap thickness in both groups was unaffected by surgical procedure (p =  0. 5).

40|$|This is a {{follow-on}} {{study to}} a 2010 correlation effort. Measured {{data from the}} SMART rotor test in the NASA Ames 40 - by 80 - Foot Wind Tunnel are compared with CAMRAD II calculations. As background, during the wind tunnel test, unexpectedly high inboard loads were encountered, and it was hypothesized {{at that time that}} due to changes in the flexbeams over the years, the flexbeam properties used in the analysis needed updating. Boeing Mesa, recently updated these properties. This correlation study uses the updated flexbeam properties. Compared to earlier studies, the following two enhancements are implemented: i) the inboard loads (pitchcase and flexbeam loads) correlation is included for the first time (reliable prediction of the inboard loads is a prerequisite for any future anticipated flight-testing); ii) the number of blade modes is increased to better capture the flap dynamics and the pitchcase-flexbeam dynamics. Also, aerodynamically, both the rolled-up wake model and the more complex, multiple trailer wake model are used, with the latter slightly improving the blade chordwise moment correlation. This sensitivity to the wake model indicates that CFD is needed. Three high-speed experimental cases, one uncontrolled free flap case and two commanded flap cases, are considered. The two commanded flap cases include a 2 o flap deflection at 5 P case and a 0 o flap deflection case. For the free flap case, selected modifications to the HH- 06 section flap airfoil pitching moment table are implemented. For the commanded 2 o flap case, the experimental flap variation is approximately matched by increasing the analytical <b>flap</b> <b>hinge</b> stiffness. This increased <b>flap</b> <b>hinge</b> stiffness is retained for the commanded 0 o flap case also, which is treated as a free flap case, but with larger <b>flap</b> <b>hinge</b> stiffness. The change in the mid-span and outboard loads correlation due to the updating of the flexbeam properties is not significant. Increasing the number of blade modes results in an effective, commanded <b>flap</b> <b>hinge</b> stiffness of 4 X baseline, not 3 X as reported earlier. The inboard loads correlation is reasonable, but needs further study. Overall, the free flap case correlation is reasonable, thus confirming the basic correctness of the current semi-empirical modifications; the correlation for the commanded 2 o flap at 5 P case and the 0 o flap case is also reasonable...|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted in}} the Static Test Facility of the NASA Langley 16 -Foot Transonic Tunnel to determine the internal performance of two-dimensional convergent-divergent nozzles designed to have simultaneous pitch and yaw thrust vectoring capability. This concept utilized divergent flap rotation of thrust vectoring in the pitch plane and deflection of flat yaw flaps hinged {{at the end of}} the sidewalls for yaw thrust vectoring. The hinge location of the yaw flaps was varied at four positions from the nozzle exit plane to the throat plane. The yaw flaps were designed to contain the flow laterally independent of power setting. In order to eliminate any physical interference between the yaw flap deflected into the exhaust stream and the divergent flaps, the downstream corners of both upper and lower divergent flaps were cut off to allow for up to 30 deg of yaw flap deflection. The impact of varying the nozzle pitch vector angle, throat area, yaw <b>flap</b> <b>hinge</b> location, yaw flap length, and yaw flap deflection angle on nozzle internal performance characteristics, was studied. High-pressure air was used to simulate jet exhaust at nozzle pressure ratios up to 7. 0.
