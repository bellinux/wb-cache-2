5|$|The Student Disciplinary Tribunal (SDT) is {{responsible}} for sanctioning erring students. Common offenses include student misconduct and fraternity rumbles. The SDT is composed of a chairperson, two appointees of the chancellor, a student <b>juror,</b> and a parent <b>juror.</b>|$|E
5|$|If {{the trial}} judge erroneously permits the {{striking}} of a <b>juror</b> under Batson, and the error is preserved, the only remedy is automatic reversal. If {{the trial judge}} erroneously prevents the striking of a <b>juror</b> under Batson, and the <b>juror</b> is seated, the Constitution permits a jurisdiction to utilize harmless error analysis. The race of the defendant is irrelevant to a Batson claim. Batson also permits the prosecutor to challenge defense peremptory strikes ("reverse Batson"). And, Batson applies equally to race and gender.|$|E
5|$|Lee Woods {{was tried}} twice, {{after his first}} trial ended in a mistrial due to a <b>juror</b> in her 20s falling ill. Wood's attorney, Samuel J. Karlin, told the judge his client wanted to {{continue}} with the ill <b>juror,</b> instead of using an alternate. At his second trial on March 16, 2009, Lee Woods was found guilty of aggravated murder, attempted aggravated murder, and 3 charges of gun possession. He was also {{sentenced to life in prison}} without the possibility of parole.|$|E
5000|$|North Carolina selects <b>jurors</b> {{through the}} use of voir dire, which permits {{involved}} parties to ask questions of potential <b>jurors</b> for the purpose of determining whether or not these <b>jurors</b> should serve on the case. Voir dire has aims to get potential <b>jurors</b> speaking about themselves and to elicit truthful and complete answers from potential <b>jurors.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Since {{there is}} always the {{possibility}} of <b>jurors</b> not completing a trial for health or other reasons, often one or more alternate <b>jurors</b> are selected. Alternates are present for the entire trial but do not take part in deliberating the case and deciding the verdict unless {{one or more of the}} impaneled <b>jurors</b> are removed from the jury. [...] In Connecticut, alternate <b>jurors</b> are dismissed before the panel of sworn <b>jurors</b> begin deliberation. [...] Connecticut General Statutes 51-243(e) and 54-82h do not allow alternate <b>jurors</b> to be segregated from the regular sworn <b>jurors.</b> In civil cases in Connecticut, C.G.S. 51-243(e) provides that alternate <b>jurors</b> [...] "shall be dismissed." [...] This differs from the power given to the court in criminal trials under C.G.S. 54-82h, permitting the court not to dismiss the alternate <b>jurors,</b> and to have the regular jury panel begin deliberations.|$|R

5|$|Some {{academic}} researchers {{argue that}} the actual efficacy of SJS is obscured by poor research methodology. Specifically, demographic characteristics used to predict <b>juror</b> attitudes and <b>juror</b> verdicts may not hold true across all kinds of cases. For example, men convict more frequently than women in some types of criminal trials but less frequently in others. Besides this, demographic characteristics are often less predictive than the attitudes jurors hold; for example, attitudes towards rape are better verdict-predictors than gender in rape trials.|$|E
5|$|Despite his federal pardon {{for being}} a Confederate general, Ross was disqualified from voting and serving as a <b>juror</b> by the first Reconstruction Act of March 2, 1867. This act, and the Supplementary Reconstruction Act passed three weeks later, disenfranchised anyone who had held a federal or state office before {{supporting}} the Confederacy.|$|E
5000|$|On June 20, jury {{selection}} was completed. Six <b>jurors</b> and four alternates were selected.

Five of the <b>jurors</b> are considered white, one is considered non-white, or mixed black and Hispanic. All of the alternates were white (one male alternate {{has been described as}} possibly Hispanic). [...] The jury was sworn in, and all remaining potential <b>jurors</b> were dismissed.|$|R
5000|$|Nelson {{was acquitted}} of murder on October 29, 1992. The racial {{composition}} of the jury (which was considered relevant {{in the context of}} the racially charged atmosphere) is unclear: some contemporary reports described the jury as having consisted of six black <b>jurors,</b> four Hispanic <b>jurors</b> and two white <b>jurors.</b> Later reports described the jury as having consisted of eight black <b>jurors,</b> two white <b>jurors</b> and two Guyanese Americans of undisclosed race or as being [...] "predominantly black".

40|$|<b>Jurors</b> are laypersons with no {{specific}} expert knowledge, {{yet they are}} routinely placed in situations in which they need to critically evaluate complex expert testimony. This paper examines <b>jurors</b> 2 ̆ 7 reactions to experts who testify in civil trials and the factors <b>jurors</b> identify as important to expert credibility. Based on in-depth qualitative analysis of interviews with 55 <b>jurors</b> in 7 civil trials, we develop a comprehensive model of the key factors <b>jurors</b> incorporate into the process of evaluating expert witnesses and their testimony. Contrary to the frequent criticism that <b>jurors</b> primarily evaluate expert evidence {{in terms of its}} subjective characteristics, the results of our study indicate that <b>jurors</b> consider both the messenger and the message in the course of evaluating the expert 2 ̆ 7 s credibility...|$|R
5|$|During jury {{selection}} in the United States, attorneys have two options for excluding potential jurors. The first option {{is a challenge}} for cause, in which attorneys must state the reason for a challenge (such as clear bias or a conflict of interest), the opposing party is allowed to respond, and the judge decides whether to exclude the <b>juror.</b> The second option is a peremptory challenge, where an attorney can exclude a <b>juror</b> without stating any reason. While challenges for cause are unlimited, attorneys have {{a limited number of}} peremptory challenges, sometimes as few as four, although 10 is more common in non-capital felony cases.|$|E

5|$|The theory behind SJS is that <b>juror</b> attitudes predict voting {{preferences}} most effectively. By discovering what relationships {{exist between}} certain attitudes, attorneys can exclude {{those from the}} jury whose attitudes would predispose them to a bad verdict.|$|E
40|$|A field {{experiment}} tested {{the effect of}} an Arizona civil jury reform that allows <b>jurors</b> to discuss evidence among themselves during the trial. Judges, <b>jurors,</b> attorneys, and litigants completed questionnaires in trials randomly assigned to either a Trial Discussions condition, in which <b>jurors</b> were permitted to discuss the evidence during trial, or a No Discussions condition, in which <b>jurors</b> were prohibited from discussing evidence during trial according to traditional admonitions. Judicial agreement with jury verdicts did not differ between conditions. Permitting <b>jurors</b> to discuss the evidence did affect the degree of certainty that <b>jurors</b> reported about their preferences {{at the start of}} jury deliberations, the level of conflict on the jury, and the likelihood of reaching unanimity...|$|R

5|$|Another {{simplified}} experiment {{indicated that}} lawyers trained {{in a systematic}} selection method made better predictions of <b>juror</b> verdicts in two of four cases – the sale of illegal drugs and a military court-martial (the other two cases were murder and drunk driving). The systematic method was more effective in those two cases where the predictive relationships between demographic variables and attitudes/verdicts were strongest, and least effective where such predictive relationships were weak or nonexistent.|$|E
5|$|Comparatively, machinimists using pre-made virtual {{platforms}} like Second Life {{have indicated}} that their productions can be made quite successfully with no cost at all. Creators like Dutch director Chantal Harvey, producer of the 48 Hour Film Project Machinima sector, have created upwards of 200 films using the platform. Harvey's advocacy of the genre {{has resulted in the}} involvement of film director Peter Greenaway who served as a <b>juror</b> for the Machinima category and gave a keynote speech during the event.|$|E
5|$|In post-trial analyses, {{blame for}} the outcome varied. Mamie Till Bradley was criticized for not crying enough on the stand. The jury was noted to have been picked almost {{exclusively}} from the hill country section of Tallahatchie County, which, due to its poorer economic make-up, found whites and blacks competing for land and other agrarian opportunities. Unlike the population living closer to the river (and thus closer to Bryant and Milam in Leflore County), who possessed a noblesse oblige toward blacks, according to historian Stephen Whitaker, those {{in the eastern part}} of the county were virulent in their racism. The prosecution was criticized for dismissing any potential <b>juror</b> who knew Milam or Bryant, for the fear that such a <b>juror</b> would vote to acquit. Afterward, Whitaker noted that this was a mistake, as anyone who had personally known the defendants usually disliked them. One <b>juror</b> voted twice to convict, but on the third discussion, acquiesced and voted with the rest of the jury to acquit. In later interviews, the jurors acknowledged that they knew Bryant and Milam were guilty, but simply did not believe that life imprisonment or the death penalty were fit punishment for whites who had killed a black man. But two jurors said as late as 2005 that they believed the defense's case. They said that the prosecution had not proved that Till had died, nor that it was his body that was removed from the river.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{empirical}} {{research suggests that}} <b>jurors</b> struggle to understand and correctly apply the standard of proof. Many researchers have focused on methods to re-write jury instructions so that standards of proof are clearer and easier for <b>jurors</b> to understand. This dissertation suggests the fundamental cause of <b>jurors</b> 2 ̆ 7 confusion concerning standards of proof is that <b>jurors</b> may use different decision processes (intuitive decision processing or systematic decision processing) and decision indices (objective probabilistic judgment or subjective confidence) depending upon their transient emotions or the seriousness of charge. ^ Study 1 assessed whether experiencing particular emotions (sadness or anger) could change mock <b>jurors</b> 2 ̆ 7 decision styles and their application of the standard of proof. Study 2 examined whether {{the severity of the}} charge against the defendant and the order of questionnaire administration could influence mock <b>jurors</b> 2 ̆ 7 fact processing and final verdicts. Results of study 1 showed that mock <b>jurors</b> induced to feel incidental sadness used rational decision processing, employed standards of proof, and made use of strength of evidence (objective probability information) as the law intended. In contrast, mock <b>jurors</b> induced to feel incidental anger relied on intuitive processing, and failed to make appropriate use of standards of proof and the strength of the evidence. Results of study 2 indicated that the order of questionnaire administration influenced mock <b>jurors</b> 2 ̆ 7 decision styles. When mock <b>jurors</b> assessed case arguments before reaching verdicts, they used rational decision processing and followed the order of questionnaires. In contrast, when mock <b>jurors</b> decided verdicts first, they relied on intuitive processing. However, contrary to expectations, the severity of charges did not influence mock <b>jurors</b> 2 ̆ 7 decision styles. ^ The results of these studies suggest that <b>jurors</b> 2 ̆ 7 misunderstanding of the standard of proof may arise from the different types of fact-finding processes they use. Trial characteristics (i. e., severity of charge) or incidental emotion might contribute varied styles of processing that characterizes <b>jurors</b> 2 ̆ 7 decision-making. Implications of these results and possible future studies are discussed. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{trial judge}} has an {{obligation}} to ensure an impartial jury, especially vis-a-vis <b>juror</b> biases and media coverage by such means as jury selection (including voir dire and for-cause challenges), jury sequestration, and jury instructions. For example, this may require the court to permit voir dire {{on the subject of the}} juror's potential racial prejudice. In some circumstances, the Sixth Amendment even requires the trial judge to grant a defendant's change of venue motion if an impartial jury cannot be obtained otherwise.|$|E

40|$|<b>Jurors</b> in {{criminal}} cases occasionally "nullify" the law by acquitting defendants who they believe are guilty according to the instructions given to them in court.

5|$|There {{are three}} steps to a Batson inquiry. First, the party {{opposing}} {{the use of}} a peremptory challenge must make a prima facie case.
