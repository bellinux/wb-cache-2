25|$|The steel quick-action vise doesn't suffer so {{much from}} this problem. With one exception, it {{functions}} well {{on the end of}} the bench. Its main drawback as a tail vise is the distance of the dog from the edge of the vise. Ideally, the dog hole strip should be fairly close to the edge of the bench. This puts your weight more directly over the work and behind the plane, enabling you to put more power and control into the operation with less strain. It is also important to keep the dog holes near the edge so that fenced planes can easily be used. With even a small quick-action vise the dog hole strip is still pretty far from the edge. So <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> use a quick-action vise as a tail vise, get the smallest good one you can find.|$|E
2500|$|October – On October 25, the Mormons and Gays website was {{revised and}} moved to mormonandgay.lds.org where it states, [...] "If you {{experience}} same-sex attraction, you may choose to use a sexual orientation label to describe yourself. ... <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> <b>to...</b> openly identify as gay, you should be supported." [...] The website says that [...] "sexual desires can be ... changeable" [...] and [...] "shifts in sexuality can and do occur for some individuals", but notes that therapy focusing on [...] "a change in sexual orientation" [...] is [...] "unethical".|$|E
2500|$|Vanguard {{journalist}} Ochereome Nnanna wrote positively of the book, [...] "The simple impression I get is {{that the}} man is a very imaginative, straightforward, practical person; the ultimate Mr. Big Shot. He will be your friend if you come to him with genuine friendship, but he will give you a fight of your life <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> fight. That is my kind of person." [...] Fashion designer Emilia Wickstead told the Financial Times the book inspired her at a young age to become an entrepreneur. Real Estate Weekly wrote, [...] "Think Big And Kick Ass is the title of one of Trump's books and the icon of everything Trump." [...] London Review of Books wrote that the work was a way to capitalize on the aspirations of consumers. The Washington Free Beacon rated the work's cover as the second best of all of Trump's book covers, and characterized the book as exemplifying [...] "The Trumpean Ideal".|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{was here}} last season, with two gentlemen from New York," [...] {{explained}} the hunter. [...] "I built that shack fer 'em. You {{can use it}} until you put up something better---that is, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> stay here." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It's no trouble," [...] the Captain replied, [...] "and {{apart from}} the disagreeable nature of your business, I am delighted {{to have you on}} board. If you can forget your suspicions about this fellow Craig, I shall do my best to make your trip a {{pleasant}} one as far as Port Said, or on to India <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> take the trip with me." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> not <b>to</b> evacuate, {{families}} and individuals should carefully monitor the hurricane updates provided by local the local {{television and radio}} crews.

"Miller {{must have}} bought the {{manuscript}} from Palliser," [...] he said, [...] "when {{he knew what}} sort of an offer Dartrey {{was going to make}} to me and realised how it would affect him. Horlock, I am not sure, after all, that I don't rather envy you <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> drop out of politics.

6000|$|... 'Could be? Can be {{and shall}} be, {{on your own}} terms,' {{returned}} my aunt, 'if you say the word. Think of this now, both of you.

6000|$|... "After hours," [...] she {{reassured}} him. [...] "Susan and I {{are going}} to talk a little nonsense after the day's work. You may join in if you can unbend so far.

6000|$|... "The issuing of your invitations," [...] Francis remarked, [...] "is {{of course}} a matter which {{concerns}} nobody else except yourself. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> do <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> favour me with one, I shall be delighted to come, provided Margaret has no objection." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Zaki," [...] he said, on {{returning}} to the hut, {{of which he had}} again taken possession, [...] "we must have one more talk. I have told you about the possible change in my position, and that I was shortly leaving for England. You begged me to take you with me, and I told <b>you</b> that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> go, I would do so. I shall be put in orders, tomorrow, for six months' leave. If I succeed in proving my claim to a title, which is what you would call here an emirship, I shall not return. If I fail, I shall be back again, in six months.

5000|$|You {{could fight}} a Jap on even terms, {{but you had}} to make him fight your way. He could outturn you at slow speed. You could outturn him at high speed. When you got into a turning fight with him, you dropped your nose down so you kept your {{airspeed}} up, you could outturn him. At low speed he could outroll you because of those big ailerons ... on the Zero. If your speed was up over 275, you could outroll Zero. His big ailerons didn't have the strength to make high speed rolls... You could push things, too. Because ... <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> go home, <b>you</b> could go home.

6000|$|... "I {{think they}} are both at the mansion, Signorina, {{although}} the student Americano may not yet have returned from Sorrento.

'Time presses,' {{said their}} visitor, who, {{although}} {{he sought to}} express the deepest interest, had something cold and even in his speech, that grated on the ear; 'and danger surrounds us.

2500|$|William Shaw {{suggests}} that the problem can be avoided if a distinction is made between potential people, who need not concern us, and actual future people, who should concern us. He says, [...] "utilitarianism values the happiness of people, not the production of units of happiness. Accordingly, one has no positive obligation to have children.

"I am a Scottish {{officer in}} the King of Sweden's army," [...] Malcolm said, [...] "and fought at Schiefelbrune and New Brandenburg, and in the fight when the Imperialists tried to relieve Colberg, and having, I hope, done my duty in three such desperate struggles against the Imperialist veterans, I need not shrink from an {{encounter}} with these freebooters. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> defend the village I am ready to strike a blow at them, for they have held me captive for five days, and have degraded me by making me cook for them." ...|$|E

There are plenty of planks to be obtained at a place three miles above here, and it would not take many hours to construct the false deck.
