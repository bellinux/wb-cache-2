5|$|During the War of 1812, White {{enlisted in}} the United States Army as a soldier and was {{promoted}} to the military rank of ensign. In 1815, White was qualified as Clerk of Court for both the county and circuit courts of Hampshire County, Virginia (now West Virginia) and he continued to <b>hold</b> <b>these</b> offices through successive appointments and elections for 46 years between 1815 and 1861. To date, White remains the longest-serving Clerk of Court for Hampshire County since the office's creation in 1757. As a prominent lawyer and court clerk, White taught jurisprudence. Many of White's law students later became eminent lawyers and public officials in their own right, including Henry Bedinger, United States House Representative and United States Ambassador to Denmark.|$|E

5|$|The cavalry {{divisions}} were to ride northwards up {{the coastal}} Plain of Sharon, then eastwards over the Mount Carmel Range {{and onto the}} Esdraelon Plain (also known as the Jezreel Valley and the plain of Armageddon), to block the line of retreat of the Ottoman Seventh and Eighth Armies fighting the XX and XXI Corps in the Judean Hills. If the Esdraelon Plain could be quickly captured, while the two Ottoman armies continued fighting the British Empire infantry, the lines of retreat by railway and road could be cut. The success of this plan depended on a rapid advance to simultaneously almost encircle the Seventh and Eighth Armies in the Judean Hills and capture Liman von Sanders and the Yilderim Army Group general headquarters. Further, in order to consolidate their success, the cavalry {{would be required to}} <b>hold</b> <b>these</b> places for some time. Operating many miles from their base, they would be dependent on rations being quickly and efficiently transported forward from base.|$|E
5|$|On the {{authority}} of Thomas B. Larkin, Quartermaster General of the United States Army, the US servicemen buried at Brookwood during the Second World War were exhumed in January–May 1948. Those whose next of kin requested it were shipped to the United States for reburial, and the remaining bodies were transferred to the new cemetery outside Cambridge. (Brookwood American Cemetery had also been the burial site for those US servicemen executed while serving in the United Kingdom, whose bodies had been carried to Brookwood by rail from the American execution facilities at Shepton Mallet. They were not transferred to Cambridge in 1948, but instead reburied in unmarked graves at Oise-Aisne American Cemetery Plot E, a dedicated site for US servicemen executed during the Second World War.) The railway service had been suspended in 1941, and North station (renamed North Bar after the ending of rail services) {{was used as a}} temporary mortuary to <b>hold</b> <b>these</b> bodies while awaiting shipment to the USA or Cambridge. As the branch line into the cemetery was no longer in use, temporary platforms were built on the branch line serving the National Rifle Association's shooting range at Bisley, {{on the opposite side of}} the LSWR line from the cemetery. Following the removal of the US war graves the site in which they had been buried was divided into cemeteries for the Free French forces and Italian prisoners of war.|$|E

25|$|The noblesse de chancellerie first {{appeared}} {{during the reign of}} Charles VIII {{at the end of the}} 15th century.

Non-nobles paid enormous sums to <b>hold</b> <b>these</b> positions, but this form of nobility was often derided as savonnette à villain ("soap for serfs").|$|E

25|$|In {{spite of}} these arguments, a {{significant}} proportion of Valencian population refuse to identify Valencian with Catalan. This phenomenon is known as blaverism. This position is often held by those who use Castilian more commonly than Valencian or do not use the latter fluently as well as promote Spanish nationalism and oppose Catalan independence. The government of the PP has been criticized for publicly endorsing some of these positions. However, younger generations educated in Valencian are much less likely to <b>hold</b> <b>these</b> views.|$|E
25|$|By 1311, Władysław was {{in power}} in Lesser Poland and his Kuyavian patrimony.

Three years later, Greater Poland also came under his rule. However, John of Luxemburg, King of Bohemia, also claimed the Polish crown. In {{alliance}} with the Teutonic Order, he attacked Władysław's forces from the north and west, while the Brandenburgians attempted to capture Greater Poland.

25|$|Despite the {{position}} of the official organizations, an opinion poll carried out between 2001 and 2004 showed {{that the majority of the}} Valencian people consider Valencian different from Catalan.

Furthermore, the data indicates that younger generations educated in Valencian are much less likely to <b>hold</b> <b>these</b> views.
