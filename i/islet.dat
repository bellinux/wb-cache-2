40|$|Insufficient {{oxygenation}} {{can limit}} the long-term survival of encapsulated <b>islets</b> in subcutaneous tissue. Transplantation of coencapsulated pig <b>islets</b> with adipose or bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (AMSCs or BM-MSCs, respectively) was investigated {{with regard to}} implant vascularization, oxygenation, and diabetes correction in primates. The in vivo impact of MSCs on graft oxygenation and neovascularization was assessed in rats with streptozotocin (STZ) -induced diabetes that were subcutaneously transplanted with <b>islets</b> coencapsulated with AMSCs (n[*]=[*] 8) or BM-MSCs (n[*]=[*] 6). Results were compared to <b>islets</b> encapsulated alone (n[*]=[*] 8). STZ diabetic primates were subcutaneously transplanted with <b>islets</b> coencapsulated with BM-MSCs (n[*]=[*] 4) or AMSCs (n[*]=[*] 6). Recipients were monitored metabolically and immunologically, and neoangiogenesis was assessed on explanted grafts. Results were compared with primates transplanted with <b>islets</b> encapsulated alone (n[*]=[*] 5). The cotransplantation of <b>islets</b> with BM-MSCs or AMSCs in diabetic rats showed significantly higher graft oxygenation than <b>islets</b> alone (3 % and 3. 6 % O 2 for islets[*]+[*]BM-MSCs or AMSCs, respectively, vs. 2. 2 % for <b>islets</b> alone). A significantly better glycated hemoglobin correction (28 weeks posttransplantation) was found for primates transplanted with <b>islets</b> and MSCs (7. 4 % and 8. 1 %, respectively) in comparison to <b>islets</b> encapsulated alone (10. 9 %). Greater neoangiogenesis {{was found in the}} periphery of coencapsulated <b>islets</b> and AMSCs in comparison to <b>islets</b> alone (p[*]<[*] 0. 01). In conclusion, the coencapsulation of pig <b>islets</b> with MSCs can improve significantly the islets' survival/function in vitro. The coencapsulation of <b>islets</b> with MSCs improves implant oxygenation and neoangiogenesis. However, the cotransplantation of <b>islets</b> with MSCs improves only slightly the long-term function of a subcutaneous bioartificial pancreas in a primate preclinical model...|$|R
40|$|Many {{previous}} studies of obese rodents documented biochemical changes in pancreatic <b>islets</b> that contribute to hyperinsulinemia in vivo.

40|$|Anaplerosis, the net {{synthesis}} in mitochondria of {{citric acid}} cycle intermediates, and cataplerosis, their export to the cytosol, {{have been shown}} to be important for insulin secretion in rodent beta cells. However, human <b>islets</b> may be different. We observed that the enzyme activity, protein level, and relative mRNA level of the key anaplerotic enzyme pyruvate carboxylase (PC) were 80 – 90 % lower in human pancreatic <b>islets</b> compared with <b>islets</b> of rats and mice and the rat insulinoma cell line INS- 1 832 / 13. Activity and protein of ATP citrate lyase, which uses anaplerotic products in the cytosol, were 60 – 75 % lower in human <b>islets</b> than in rodent <b>islets</b> or the cell line. In line with the lower PC, the percentage of glucose-derived pyruvate that entered mitochondrial metabolism via carboxylation in human <b>islets</b> was only 20 – 30 % that in rat <b>islets.</b> This suggests human <b>islets</b> depend less on pyruvate carboxylation than rodent models that were used to establish the role of PC in insulin secretion. Human <b>islets</b> possessed high levels of succinyl-CoA: 3 -ketoacid-CoA transferase, an enzyme that forms acetoacetate in the mitochondria, and acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase, which uses acetoacetate to form acyl-CoAs in the cytosol. Glucose-stimulated human <b>islets</b> released insulin similarly to rat <b>islets</b> but formed much more acetoacetate. β-Hydroxybutyrate augmented insulin secretion in human <b>islets.</b> This information supports previous data that indicate beta cells can use a pathway involving succinyl-CoA: 3 -ketoacid-CoA transferase and acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase to synthesize and use acetoacetate and suggests human <b>islets</b> may use this pathway more than PC and citrate to form cytosolic acyl-CoAs...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{possibility}} of transplanting microencapsulated pancreatic <b>islets</b> into patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, either as allografts or xenografts, has attracted great interest. A critical {{evaluation of the}} results obtained reveals that the success has been very limited. The aim {{of the present study was}} to compare the in vitro function of microencapsulated <b>islets</b> obtained from adult humans, adult mice, adult rats, and fetal pigs. METHODS: Human pancreatic <b>islets</b> were isolated at beta-Cell Transplant in Brussels, Belgium, and sent to the Department of Medical Cell Biology, Uppsala University in Uppsala, Sweden. Rat and mouse pancreatic <b>islets</b> and fetal porcine islet-like cell clusters (ICC) were prepared in Uppsala. All groups of <b>islets</b> were subsequently sent to the Department of Biotechnology, Norwegian Institute of Biotechnology, University of Trondheim, Trondheim, Norway. After 1 day in tissue culture, the <b>islets</b> were microencapsulated in alginate then cultured and sent back to Uppsala the next day. After either overnight culture (day 1) or 6 days of culture (day 6), the microencapsulated <b>islets</b> were examined for their insulin content and insulin release. Nonencapsulated <b>islets</b> from the same isolations were used as controls. RESULTS: The insulin content of rodent and human <b>islets</b> was not affected by microencapsulation, whereas porcine ICC showed a diminished insulin content. Microencapsulated porcine ICC also had a marked reduction in their insulin secretion in response to stimulation with glucose or glucose + theophylline both on days 1 and 6 in tissue culture. Mouse <b>islets</b> showed a reduced insulin response at both time points. Rat <b>islets</b> exhibited an inhibition of insulin secretion on day 1, but this had been restored by day 6. Human <b>islets</b> had well-preserved insulin secretion after both days 1 and 6. Microencapsulated human <b>islets</b> showed a normal morphology 3 - 4 weeks after intraperitoneal transplantation to nude mice. CONCLUSIONS: Pancreatic <b>islets</b> isolated from human, rat, and mouse donors show a glucose-stimulated insulin release in vitro after microencapsulation and repeated transports between laboratories. The insulin secretory capacity of microencapsulated human and rat <b>islets</b> was preserved best, whereas mouse <b>islets</b> and particularly fetal porcine ICC were impaired by microencapsulation.
