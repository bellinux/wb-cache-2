40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to generally assess the technical efficiency of sawn timber produced from timber <b>flitching.</b> (This study was carried out at Bodija plank market in Ibadan to assess the technical efficiency of sawn timber produced from timber <b>flitching</b> and also to assess) assess and it expressed the general assessment of processing (the waste in timber <b>flitching.</b> Data were collected on all the species commonly <b>flitched</b> and their various dimensions were equally measured. The waste arising from conservation errors in timber <b>flitching</b> determined by comparing the conventional dimensions of sawn wood with the series of variation discovered in the dimension <b>flitched</b> wood. From the result, 13 different species, which are the most prominent <b>flitched</b> logs in the market, were randomly selected and measurements were taken on individual species. This was represented in the table 2 (Species A – M) and 10 planks were selected and dimensional measurement i. e. length, breadth and thickness were taken and recorded. Four species A, G, H and J with mean volume of 58788. 76 cm 3, 62168. 83 cm 3, 50609. 61 cm 3 and 62377. 77 cm 3 respectively were discovered to have different variations from the conventional volume of 56633. 69 cm 3. Also, nine different lumber species were considered under the conventional dimension of 28316. 85 cm 3 (i. e. 5. 08 cm x 15. 24 cm x 365. 76 cm). The study also revealed that C, F, K and L <b>flitched</b> dimensions were greater than the conventional dimension. Significant lumber conversion efficiency was noticed in species D and M with volume recovery of 28330. 83 cm 3 and 28316. 84 cm 3 respectively. Species B has the lowest volume recovery of 11, 466. 28 cm 3. Bar chart was used to determine the frequency of waste generated from the results. The act of timber <b>flitching,</b> which is mostly rampant among the timber exploiters, cannot be discarded since they supplement the sawn wood.

25|$|Essex is {{also home}} to the Dunmow <b>Flitch</b> Trials, a {{traditional}} ceremony that takes place every four years and consists of a test of a married couple's devotion to one another. A common claim of the origin of the Dunmow <b>Flitch</b> dates back to 1104 and the Augustinian priory of Little Dunmow, founded by Lady Juga Baynard. Lord of the Manor Reginald Fitzwalter and his wife dressed themselves as humble folk and begged blessing of the Prior a year and a day after marriage. The prior, impressed by their devotion, bestowed upon them a <b>flitch</b> of bacon. Upon revealing his true identity, Fitzwalter gave his land to the priory on condition that a <b>flitch</b> should be awarded to any couple who could claim they were similarly devoted.|$|E

25|$|By the 14th century, the Dunmow <b>Flitch</b> Trials {{appear to}} have {{achieved}} a significant reputation outside the local area. The author William Langland, {{who lived on the}} Welsh borders, mentions it in his 1362 book The Vision of Piers Plowman in a manner that implies general knowledge of the custom among his readers.|$|E
500|$|The Dunmow {{tradition}} was revived in Victorian times, largely {{inspired by a}} book (The <b>Flitch</b> of Bacon) by William Harrison Ainsworth. [...] <b>Flitch</b> trials are still held in modern times at Great Dunmow. [...] A counsel is employed to cross-examine the nominated couples and attempt to show they are undeserving of the award.|$|E
500|$|Although the <b>flitch</b> {{ceremony}} at Dunmow is generally held to have originated with the Fitzwalters in the 13th century {{there are some}} who would date it to earlier Norman or Saxon times, one suggested date being 1104, the founding of the Little Dunmow Priory. [...] This is partly because the <b>flitch</b> of Dunmow seems to have already been common knowledge in very early works such as the prologue to Chaucer's [...] "Wife of Bath" [...] and also in the Visions of Pierce Plowman by William Langland. [...] Some would also read passages in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle as alluding to the Dunmow <b>flitch.</b>|$|E

5000|$|A slab hut is {{actually}} a 'slab-walled' structure. Its walls were, strictly speaking, built from 'flitches'. Slabs are sawn from a trunk, <b>flitches</b> are split from it. [...] Hut-builders felled selected trees, and sawed the trunks into suitable lengths. They then split these lengths into <b>flitches</b> using a maul and a wedge. Timber was split , that is, along the grain, instead of by the traditional British [...] method, from {{the core of the}} trunk out towards the bark. There was neither time nor tools suitable to properly dress timber into planks, nor to season the timber; it was used green.|$|R

500|$|There is {{evidence}} that the <b>flitch</b> of bacon tradition existed outside Britain in mainland Europe and some would push its origins back as far as Saxon times.

500|$|It is {{possible}} that the <b>flitch</b> of bacon custom was at one time quite widespread. [...] There was a <b>flitch</b> of bacon tradition at the Abbey of St Melaine, Rennes, Brittany, where the bacon is said to have hung for six centuries without being claimed. [...] In Vienna, there was a similar tradition in which the prize was a ham of bacon rather than a <b>flitch.</b> [...] The ham was hung over the city gate, from where the winner was expected to climb up and remove it himself. [...] One such winner had the prize revoked after winning it, after he inadvertently let slip that his wife would rebuke him for staining his coat while bringing down the ham.|$|E

5000|$|Although not {{dissimilar}} in {{layout to}} {{other types of}} sawmills, case mills were typically smaller in scale owing to the smaller size of the logs that were milled and the smaller size of the end product. A three-person mill, comprising a single circular saw bench (number one bench) and a docking saw, could produce up to 500 cases per day. Logs were broken down at the number one bench into longitudinal lengths of timber (<b>flitches).</b> The <b>flitches</b> were cut to required length at the docking saw. Waste material from the initial breaking down process (including edging) was cut down for firewood at the docking saw or disposed of. The lengths of timber ready for assembly as cases were known as [...] "shooks".|$|R

500|$|There was {{an attempt}} made to claim the <b>flitch</b> on 12 June 1772 by John and Susan Gilder. [...] The couple had given due notice of their claim and were {{accompanied}} by a large crowd of onlookers. [...] However, {{the lord of the}} manor had ordered that the ceremony should not take place and the gates of the priory were nailed shut to prevent it. [...] By 1809 the tradition was definitely abolished. [...] A further attempt to claim the <b>flitch</b> was made in 1832 by Josiah Vine, a retired cheesemaker, who travelled with his wife from Reading to make his claim. [...] He too was refused a trial by a very unsympathetic Steward of Little Dunmow. [...] John Bull on 8 October 1837 reported that it had been revived by the Saffron Walden and Dunmow Agricultural Society. [...] Apparently however, this <b>flitch</b> was merely distributed at the annual society dinner. [...] In 1851 a couple from Felstead were also refused a trial at the Priory, but obtained a <b>flitch</b> from the people of nearby Great Dunmow who felt that they deserved it.|$|E
500|$|The {{awarding}} of a <b>flitch</b> of bacon to married couples who can swear to not having regretted their marriage {{for a year}} and a day is an old tradition, the remnants of which still survive in some pockets in England. [...] The tradition was maintained at Wychnoure until at least the eighteenth century but now remains only as a carving over the fireplace. [...] At Little Dunmow in Essex a similar ceremony also survived into the eighteenth century. [...] The tradition can be traced back to at least the fourteenth century at both sites and the Dunmow <b>flitch</b> is referred to in Chaucer. [...] The {{awarding of}} a <b>flitch</b> at both sites seems to have been an exceedingly rare event.|$|E
500|$|A rather better-known {{example of}} the {{awarding}} of a <b>flitch</b> of bacon to married couples occurred at Little Dunmow Priory in Essex. [...] It is generally held to have been instituted by the family of Robert Fitzwalter in the 13th century. [...] According to Rev. W. W. Skeat in his notes to the fourteenth-century The Vision of William Concerning Piers the Plowman, In the present passage we have the earliest known allusion to the singular custom known as that of [...] "the Dunmow <b>flitch</b> of Bacon." [...] The custom was—"that if any pair could, after a twelvemonth of matrimony, come forward, and make oath at Dunmow [...] that, during the whole time, they {{had never had a}} quarrel, never regretted their marriage, and, if again open to an engagement, would make exactly that they had made, they should be rewarded with a <b>flitch</b> of Bacon." [...] It is referred to in Chaucer (1343–1400) {{in a way that makes}} clear the reference would already be well known to the reader. [...] It continued to be awarded until the middle of the 18th century, the last successful claim being made on 20 June 1751. [...] The ceremony of this last <b>flitch</b> award was recorded by the artist David Ogborne who was present at the time to make sketches and, later, engravings. [...] His images were later used as source material by Ainsworth for his novel, The <b>Flitch</b> of Bacon. [...] Ainsworth's 1854 novel proved so popular that it revived the custom which has continued in one form or another down to the present day and is now held every leap year.|$|E

500|$|The <b>flitch</b> of bacon, subtitled The {{custom of}} Dunmow: {{a tale of}} English home is a novel by William Harrison Ainsworth first {{published}} in 1854. [...] The central plot {{of the story is}} the <b>flitch</b> at Dunmow and the scheming by the leading character to be awarded it by marrying a succession of women in an attempt to find the right one. [...] The description of the ceremony in the book is partly based on the art of David Ogborne, an eyewitness to the last ceremony in 1751.|$|E
500|$|The winning couple are escorted {{away in a}} grand {{ceremony}} with [...] "trompets, tabourets, {{and other}} manoir of mynstralcie". [...] Although this is a valuable prize, {{it does not seem}} to have been claimed very often. [...] Horace Walpole, who visited Whichnoure in 1760, reported that the <b>flitch</b> had not been claimed for thirty years and that a real <b>flitch</b> of bacon was no longer kept ready at the manor. [...] A replacement, carved in wood, was now displayed over the mantle of the fireplace in the main hall, presumably in order to continue to meet the conditions of the original land grant.|$|E
500|$|The <b>flitch</b> {{trials were}} revived in the Victorian era after the {{publication}} of Ainsworth's novel in 1854 which proved to be tremendously popular. [...] Ainsworth aided the reinstitution by himself donating two flitches for the first of the revived ceremonies in 1855. [...] They have been held ever since {{in one form or another}} except for a gap caused by the World Wars. [...] The first ceremony after World War II was held in 1949, despite rationing still being in force. [...] The modern trials are held every fourth year on leap years; the next one is planned for 2020. [...] The event is organised by the Dunmow <b>Flitch</b> Trials Committee who employ a counsel to cross-examine the applicants in an attempt to save the bacon for the sponsors who donated it. [...] The trial is decided by a jury.|$|E
60|$|There {{was evidently}} some {{controversy}} in the interior as to the course at this moment to be pursued. Master Joseph remonstrated against the policy of concession, called conciliation, which his father would fain follow, and was for instant coercion; but age and experience carried the day, {{and in a few}} minutes some <b>flitches</b> were thrown out of the window to the Hell-cats who received the booty with a cheer.|$|R
