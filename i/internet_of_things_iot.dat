In this paper, we are introducing the concept of pattern-based data sharing in big data environments. The proposed methodology enables local data processing near the data sources and transforms the raw data streams into actionable knowledge patterns. These knowledge patterns have dual utility of availability of local knowledge patterns for immediate actions {{as well as for}} participatory data sharing in big data environments.

Moreover, most existing work focuses on privacy-preserving range query neglecting collusion attacks and probability attacks, which are more threatening to network security. In this paper, we first propose a secure range query protocol called secRQ, which not only protects data privacy, but also resists collusion attacks and probability attacks in tiered wireless sensor networks. Generalized inverse matrices and distance-based range query mechanism are used to guarantee security as well as high efficiency and accuracy. Besides, we propose the mutual verification scheme to verify the integrity of query results. Finally, both theoretical analysis and experimental results confirm the security, efficiency and accuracy of secRQ...|$|R

ITSs inform drivers about unfavorable and dangerous road conditions such as weather situation, accidents, work zones, and emergencies (e.g., bushfire, flood) to improve road safety and traffic management and to provide value-added services while on the road [2, 3]. Proper information delivery needs an appropriate routing mechanism. The routing needs to route precise and updated information about traffic mobility (e.g., number of vehicles on the road and their directions and velocities). The collection and provision of this information can be done through VANETs by using two kinds of communication technologies, namely vehicle-to-vehicle (V 2 V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V 2 I) [4, 5]. By delivering this information timely, better decisions can be made by drivers and accidents can be avoided.|$|R
