The Coast Guard removed the site from consideration in May 2012 due to opposition from Cross Sound Ferry over use of its property.

5|$|Once the Space Telescope {{project had}} been given the go-ahead, work on the program was divided among many institutions. Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) was given {{responsibility}} for the design, development, and construction of the telescope, while Goddard Space Flight Center was given overall control of the scientific instruments and ground-control center for the mission. MSFC commissioned the optics company Perkin-Elmer to design and build the Optical Telescope Assembly (OTA) and Fine Guidance Sensors <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>space</b> telescope. Lockheed was commissioned to construct and integrate the spacecraft in which the telescope would be housed.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Endeavour docking, the Russian {{resupply}} spacecraft Progress M1-4, {{which came}} to the station in mid-November, was undocked to make room <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>space</b> shuttle. This Progress spacecraft remained undocked {{for the duration of}} STS-97, parked in orbit about a mile away from the station. It docked manually again with the station on 26 December by Gidzenko, after Endeavour left. The automatic docking system for this Progress spacecraft had failed on the first docking in November. The crew spent much of the following week unloading the Progress spacecraft.|$|E

5|$|Disorder {{followed}} William's death; {{everyone who}} had been at his deathbed left the body at Rouen and hurried off to attend to their own affairs. Eventually, the clergy of Rouen arranged to have the body sent to Caen, where William had desired {{to be buried in}} his foundation of the Abbaye-aux-Hommes. The funeral, attended by the bishops and abbots of Normandy as well as his son Henry, was disturbed by the assertion of a citizen of Caen who alleged that his family had been illegally despoiled of the land on which the church was built. After hurried consultations the allegation was shown to be true, and the man was compensated. A further indignity occurred when the corpse was lowered into the tomb. The corpse was too large <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>space,</b> and when attendants forced the body into the tomb it burst, spreading a disgusting odour throughout the church.|$|E

5|$|Faget's {{preliminary}} Apollo design {{employed a}} cone-shaped command module, supported {{by one of}} several service modules providing propulsion and electrical power, sized appropriately <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>space</b> station, cislunar, and lunar landing missions. Once Kennedy's Moon landing goal became official, detailed design began of a Command/Service Module (CSM) in which the crew would spend the entire direct-ascent mission and lift off from the lunar surface for the return trip, after being soft-landed by a larger landing propulsion module. The final choice of lunar orbit rendezvous changed the CSM's role to the translunar ferry used to transport the crew, along with a new spacecraft, the Lunar Excursion Module (LEM, later shortened to Lunar Module, LM) which would take two men to the lunar surface and return them to the CSM.|$|E
5|$|STS-300 was the {{designation}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> Shuttle Launch on Need (LON) missions {{to be launched}} on short notice for STS-114 and STS-121, {{in the event that}} the shuttle became disabled or damaged and could not safely return to Earth. The rescue flight for STS-115, if needed, would have been STS-301. After STS-115, the rescue mission designations were based on the corresponding regular mission that would be replaced should the rescue mission be needed. For example, the STS-116 rescue mission was branded STS-317, because the normal mission scheduled after STS-116 was STS-117. Should the rescue mission have been needed, the crew and vehicle for STS-117 would assume the rescue mission profile and become STS-317. All potential rescue missions were to be launched with a crew of four, and would return with ten or eleven crew members, depending on the number of crew launched on the rescued shuttle. Missions were expected to last approximately eleven days. None of the planned contingency missions was ever flown.|$|E

On June 29, Atlantis successfully docked with Mir, {{becoming the first}} US spacecraft to dock with a Russian spacecraft since the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project in 1975. Atlantis delivered Cosmonauts Anatoly Solovyev and Nikolai Budarin, who would form the expedition EO-19 crew, and retrieved Astronaut Norman Thagard and Cosmonauts Vladimir Dezhurov and Gennady Strekalov of the expedition EO-18 crew. Atlantis also carried out on-orbit joint US-Russian life sciences investigations aboard a Spacelab module and performed a logistical resupply of the station.|$|E

5|$|The soup {{has even}} {{played a role}} in the Soviet space program. In March 1961, as part of a {{communications}} equipment test, a pre-recorded recipe for borscht was broadcast from the Korabl-Sputnik 4 spacecraft. The craft, carrying animals and a mannequin, had been launched into low Earth orbit in preparation for manned space flights. Actual borscht eventually made its way into outer space as space food for Soviet and, later, Russian cosmonauts. Originally, a puréed version of borscht was supplied in tubes. All ingredients <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>space</b> borscht (which include beef, beetroots, cabbage, potatoes, carrots, onions, parsley root and tomato paste) were cooked separately, then combined one by one in strictly controlled order, sterilized, packed into tubes, sealed airtight and autoclaved. In the 1970s, the tubes were replaced with packages of rehydratable freeze-dried borscht with regular-size bits of cooked vegetables.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to reduced}} {{interest}} in his pre-war work, Coggins applied for a position teaching watercolor at Hunter College. He taught watercolor painting there from 1948 to 1952. In New York, {{as a result of}} his friendship with Fletcher Pratt, Coggins was introduced to the members of the Hydra Club, where he met Judith Merril and L. Ron Hubbard. Coggins was also invited to join Pratt's Trap Door Spiders club, where he became closely associated with L. Sprague de Camp and Isaac Asimov. The contact with such visionary thinkers complimented his exposure to the German V-2 rockets in Europe and served to strengthen his growing interest in space travel, rockets, and science fiction. In 1951 and 1952, Coggins collaborated again with Fletcher Pratt on two classic books: Rockets, Jets, Guided Missiles & Space Ships, and By Space Ship to the Moon. The books were released amidst the great wave of interest in space travel sweeping the United States and the rest of the world in the 1950s, and they were published in several countries and translated into other languages. These books made the prospect of space exploration seem a practical possibility. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) scientists used the books to demonstrate their ideas to Congressmen when seeking funding <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>space</b> program, and there are many NASA scientists today who retain fond memories of the influence the books had on their careers.|$|E

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 71 - 73). We examine the Mityagin problem: how {{to characterize the}} extension property in geometric terms. We start with three methods of extension <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>spaces</b> of Whitney functions. One of the methods was suggested by B. S. Mityagin: to extend individually {{the elements of a}} topological basis. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>spaces</b> of Whitney functions on Cantor sets K(), which were introduced by A. Goncharov, we construct topological bases. When the set K() has the extension property, we construct a linear continuous extension operator by means of suitable individual extensions of basis elements. Moreover, we use local Newton interpolations to contruct an extension operator. In the end, we show that <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>spaces</b> of Whitney functions, there is no complete characterization of the extension property in terms of Hausdorff measures or growth of Markov's factors. by Zeliha Ural Merpez.
