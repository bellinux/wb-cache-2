5|$|Governor Breathitt died of {{tuberculosis}} on February 21, 1834, and Morehead {{was sworn in}} as governor the following day. The replacement of a Democratic governor with one from the rival National Republican party caused a great deal of angst among Democrats, but the ascendancy of Democrat James Guthrie to president of the state senate and Morehead's willingness to retain Breathitt's secretary of state, Lewis Saunders, <b>did</b> <b>much</b> to allay their fears.|$|E
