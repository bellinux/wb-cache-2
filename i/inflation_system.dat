2500|$|On the A0 {{model the}} front Rockwell steer-drive axle has Hendrickson {{parabolic}} taper leaf springs. The rear tridem unit is sprung by Hendrickson-Turner air suspension. The rearmost axle is a steer-drive unit. All axles are Rockwell SVI 5MR hub-reduction with differential locks. Steering is power-assisted, {{and has an}} auxiliary pump should the main pump fail. Mechanical linkage also provides operator control in event of hydraulic oil pressure loss. [...] Rockwell (now AxleTech) S-cam drum brakes are fitted. A CM Automotive central tire <b>inflation</b> <b>system</b> (CTIS) is fitted, this having four predetermined terrain settings (Highway, Cross-Country, Mud & Snow, Emergency) that enable the operator to adjust tire pressure and lock-up to suit the terrain being crossed. A Run Flat mode checks tire pressures regularly and inflates as needed to compensate for leak(s).|$|E

40|$|Summary Air-supported {{structures}} {{can provide}} a suitable artificial environment for encouraging plant growth. How this can be achieved with a low rate of energy expenditure is described. The structural behaviour of air-supported structures is outlined, and the factors affecting the selection of cover materials, <b>inflation</b> <b>systems</b> and other auxiliary equipment discussed. Ventilation rates through air-supported greenhouses are examined, and the structures rated {{according to the requirements}} of their <b>inflation</b> <b>systems.</b> Methods of heating or cooling the environemnet within the greenhouse, and controls for internal humidity and carbon-dioxide concentrations, are discussed. It is concluded that air-supported structures can be utilised effectively as greenhouses. ...|$|R
50|$|There {{can be a}} {{conflict}} between the requirements for good surface trim and large reserve of buoyancy, particularly with back <b>inflation</b> <b>systems,</b> where a large volume {{is more likely to}} move the centre of buoyancy further back than the centre of gravity, and moving the centre of gravity further back by shifting weights may compromise trim stability at neutral buoyancy.|$|R

5000|$|One {{problem is}} lack of standardization. Tires are often {{purchased}} in bulk and moved between tractors over time, so a given TPMS system can only work with compatible sensors in the tires, creating logistic problems. RF systems for these units must also work over much longer ranges, which may force repeater systems to be installed on the tractor or trailer. It is expected that battery lives on these systems {{should be in the}} five- to seven-year range, since the cost of breaking down a tire can be so much more expensive. The U.S. Department of Transportation's maximum-loading requirements force trailer manufacturers to spread loads over multiple axles, giving rise to trailers with typically 8 to 12 tires, but as many as 96 tires on specialty haulers. [...] Tire casings can have typical lifetimes of ten or more years, through multiple retreading processes. This has given rise to a specialized industry that focuses solely on issues found in the trucking industry. [...] Central <b>inflation</b> <b>systems</b> originally claimed to eliminate the need for pressure-monitoring <b>systems.</b> Some major <b>inflation</b> <b>systems</b> are Meritor PSI, Hendrickson International, Stemco AERIS and Vagia (used mostly in South America). They have not yielded a complete solution, since they do not solve all the issues (i.e., no support for the steerable axle), and they bring new issues with maintenance of the rotary couplings in the hub caps. <b>Inflation</b> <b>systems</b> can sometimes shorten the life of tires by concealing slow leaks caused by embedded objects, which drivers would otherwise remove after inspecting the problem tire.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{nowadays}} tractors construction. Theoretical part {{is divided into three}} subgroups - tractor engine, powertrain and chassis. The problematics of emission limits is discussed in the first subgroup. Major part of second subgroup is devoted to hydro mechanical powertrain.

Practical part devotes to methodology and field measurements with the aim on various weight distribution of the tractor. Measurements were realized with CASE IH Magnum 370 CVX tractor.

50|$|The usual <b>inflation</b> <b>system</b> {{is from a}} {{low-pressure}} hose from the primary breathing gas supply, but a dedicated direct feed pony bottle was common on early buoyancy compensators, and remains an option for some models. Most BCs allow oral inflation both underwater and on the surface. This could theoretically reduce gas consumption, but is generally not considered worth the effort and slightly increased hazard of taking the DV out of the mouth underwater, and possibly having to purge it before breathing again. Oral inflation is, however, an effective alternative inflation method {{in case of a}} failure of the pressurized <b>inflation</b> <b>system.</b> Emergency inflation by expendable CO2 cartridge is provided on some BCs.|$|E
