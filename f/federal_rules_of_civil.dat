5|$|A {{week after}} the crash, the {{families}} of various passengers aboard Flight 706 began filing lawsuits and court papers against Hughes Airwest and, later, {{the government of the}} United States. The first filing was by the family of Keith A. Gabel, which filed a motion to perpetuate testimony in the Central District of California on June 16, 1971. This motion requests that the court issue a court order for a person's deposition to be taken, and can be done prior to a lawsuit being filed under the <b>Federal</b> <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Civil</b> Procedure.|$|E

25|$|Louisiana's {{criminal}} law largely rests on English common law. Louisiana's administrative law is generally {{similar to the}} administrative law of the U.S. federal government and other U.S. states.

25|$|Equity {{courts were}} widely distrusted {{in the northeastern}} US {{following}} the American Revolution. A serious movement for merger of law and equity began in {{the states in the}} mid-19th century, when David Dudley Field II convinced New York State to adopt {{what became known as the}} Field Code of 1848. The federal courts did not abandon the old law/equity separation until the promulgation of the <b>Federal</b> <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Civil</b> Procedure in 1938.|$|E
25|$|Except for suits by incarcerated persons, non-prisoner litigants {{proceeding}} in forma pauperis, or (in some circumstances) by seamen, U.S. Marshals {{no longer}} serve leading process or subpoenas in private civil actions {{filed in the}} U.S. district courts. Under the <b>Federal</b> <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Civil</b> Procedure, process may be served by any U.S. citizen {{over the age of}} 18 who is not a party involved in the case. The Marshals still levy executions and serve writs of garnishment.|$|E
25|$|Federal {{cases and}} some states follow Federal Rule 27 (a) (3) of the <b>Federal</b> <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Civil</b> Procedure {{concerning}} {{the production of}} documents in pretrial discovery, including those pertaining to depositions. These can include the subpoena duces tecum to produce documents, {{or in some cases}} to undergo a physical or mental examination. In the Ninth Circuit, interpreting Rule 27 literally, it has been held that a party can simply produce the documents only, and in certain cases, avoid an oral deposition when presented with subpoena duces tecum.|$|E

5000|$|Acceptance or waiver {{of service}} is {{encouraged}} by some court systems, especially U.S. federal courts.

25|$|Examples {{of common}} law being {{replaced}} by statute or codified rule in the United States include criminal law (since 1812, U.S. federal courts and most {{but not all of}} the States have held that criminal law must be embodied in statute if the public is to have fair notice), commercial law (the Uniform Commercial Code in the early 1960s) and procedure (the <b>Federal</b> <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Civil</b> Procedure in the 1930s and the Federal Rules of Evidence in the 1970s). But note that in each case, the statute sets the general principles, but the interstitial common law process determines the scope and application of the statute.|$|E
25|$|This {{allowed for}} {{representative}} suits {{in situations where}} {{there were too many}} individual parties (which now forms the first requirement for class action litigation, numerosity). However, this rule did not allow such suits to bind similarly situated absent parties, which rendered the rule ineffective. Within ten years, the Supreme Court interpreted Rule 48 in such a way so that it could apply to absent parties under certain circumstances, but only by ignoring the plain meaning of the rule. In the rules published in 1912, Equity Rule 48 was replaced with Equity Rule 38 as part of a major restructuring of the Equity Rules, and when federal courts merged their legal and equitable procedural systems in 1938, Equity Rule 38 became Rule 23 of the <b>Federal</b> <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Civil</b> Procedure.|$|E
25|$|Garner {{has contributed}} to the field of {{procedural}} rules. From 1992 to 1994, he revised all amendments to the sets of Federal Rules—Civil, Appellate, Evidence, Bankruptcy, and Criminal—for the United States Judicial Conference. In the mid-1990s, he restyled the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which were adopted by the Judicial Conference, then by the United States Supreme Court, and enacted by Congress. The <b>Federal</b> <b>Rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>Civil</b> Procedure were restyled in 1993–1994 and adopted on December 1, 2007. The Administrative Office of the United States Courts has printed and distributed Garner's booklet Guidelines for Drafting and Editing Court Rules (1st ed. 1996, 5th ed. 2007). Garner has revised the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure, the California Rules of Appellate Procedure, the California Judicial Council Rules, the Local Rules of the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, and the Rules on Judicial-Conduct and Disability Proceedings (for federal courts). In 2015, after a 15-year hiatus, he returned as a style consultant to the U.S. Judicial Conference's Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure.|$|E

Previously, under the standard the Court set forth in Conley v. Gibson, a complaint need only state a [...] "conceivable" [...] set of facts to support its legal claims—that is, that a court could only dismiss a claim if it appeared, beyond a doubt, that the plaintiff {{would be able to}} prove no set of facts in support of her claim that would entitle her to relief. In Twombly, the court adopted a more strict, [...] "plausibility" [...] standard, requiring in this case [...] "enough facts to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of illegal agreement".|$|R
