500|$|At the Scottish Labour Party Conference in March 2012, Lamont {{announced}} her intention {{to establish a}} Commission to examine {{the prospect of a}} fully devolved Scottish Parliament. This would give the Scottish Government the power to make decisions on policies relating to issues such as welfare benefits, income tax and corporation tax, effectively making it a fully self-governing region of the United Kingdom. The Commission, chaired by Lamont and including politicians, academics and trade union members, {{met for the first time}} in October 2012. It published an interim report in April 2013, recommending that Scotland have autonomy over income tax, but leaving decisions on corporation tax and welfare to the UK Parliament. But party members opposed it, warning that the plans could threaten the Barnett formula, the <b>financial</b> <b>mechanism</b> under which Scotland receives an annual average of £1,600 per head more in UK Government spending than does the rest of the UK. Ian Davidson, chair of the House of Commons Scottish Affairs Select Committee said the proposals could affect spending in poorer areas. Macintosh subsequently warned that devolving responsibility for income tax would reduce the Scottish tax base and result in independence by default, a claim that Guy Lodge and Alan Trench of the Institute for Public Policy Research called [...] "highly disingenuous" [...] because income tax makes up only 23% of the taxes collected by the UK Government.|$|E

40|$|AbstractMany countries, {{including}} Colombia, require new <b>financial</b> <b>mechanisms</b> {{that lead}} to increased coverage in supplies of drinking water, particularly in rural areas. However, the establishment of such mechanisms demands new public and private policies that promote and increase financial assets in capital markets. This paper examines how green <b>financial</b> <b>mechanisms</b> can lead to increased coverage of potable water through the funding of new water infrastructure systems in Colombia. Achieving this goal requires both private investment and clean <b>financial</b> <b>mechanisms</b> that promote a low-emissions infrastructure. To address this need, this paper proposes a new financing model that involves green financing, capital markets, and {{the private and public}} sectors. In addition, it introduces new policies that the Colombian government should plan to implement to foster private participation and the development of infrastructure-related financial assets. As a result, this paper should contribute to increasing the role of the capital markets and private involvement {{in the development of a}} sustainable rural drinking water infrastructure...|$|R

40|$|Global {{climate and}} energy {{governance}} {{have led to}} the creation of a wide range of international and regional institutions, initiatives and <b>financial</b> <b>mechanisms</b> dedicated to fostering renewable energies. Furthermore, a low-carbon economy has evolved in recent years. The objective of this paper is to assess the potential benefits and merits of these institutions, initiatives and mechanisms from the perspective of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. The central questions are if and how these organizations, initiatives and finance mechanisms could support a country from MENA in its efforts to implement large-scale capacities for renewable energy production. For this purpose, Morocco was chosen as a case study. The findings in this paper indicate that the existing institutions and <b>financial</b> <b>mechanisms</b> do not sum up to a coordinated governance approach, although the main needs of a country or region appear to be addressed. The existing institutions and <b>financial</b> <b>mechanisms</b> vary significantly in their ability to support countries, especially those taking the lead in renewable energy implementation.

The decision to make the GEF an independent organization enhanced the involvement of developing countries in the decision-making process and in implementation of the projects. Since 1994, however, the World Bank has served as the Trustee of the GEF Trust Fund and provided administrative services. As part of the restructuring, the GEF was entrusted to become the <b>financial</b> <b>mechanism</b> for both the UN Convention on Biological Diversity and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. In partnership with the Montreal Protocol of the Vienna Convention on Ozone Layer Depleting Substances, the GEF started funding projects that enable the Russian Federation and nations in Eastern Europe and Central Asia to phase out their use of ozone-destroying chemicals. The GEF subsequently was also selected to serve as <b>financial</b> <b>mechanism</b> for three more international conventions: The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (2001), the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (2003), and the Minamata Convention on Mercury (2013).|$|E
