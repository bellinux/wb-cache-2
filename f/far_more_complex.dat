5|$|Decompression {{theory is}} not an exact science. Decompression models {{approximate}} a physiological process that is incompletely understood, and rather complex, by simple mathematical models, {{in the hope of}} producing a useful procedure with acceptably low risk of injury to the user. New information allows theories and models to be modified to provide more reliable results, and the availability of faster and more powerful computer processors at low cost has made more exhaustive numerical methods more practicable, and the computation of relatively <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>complex</b> models is now quite possible, even in real time.|$|E
5|$|This {{major change}} from a Classical design to a <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>complex</b> revival style, little known in Russia, meant Vorontsov had to find an {{alternative}} architect to execute a new design. This was further complicated by Vorontsov's desire to not only have a loose Jacobean style, but also to incorporate motifs from Islamic architecture so as to highlight the oriental strain evident in the Khan's Palace, Enikale Fort, and other local Tatar architecture. The resulting design was to highlight the Crimea's position {{as a place where}} the East and West meet. It was a radical departure from the Neoclassical strain that dominated the Russian architecture of the period.|$|E

5000|$|The {{struggle}} between Caesar's and Pompeius' factions {{is portrayed as}} mere jealousy on Pompeius' part for Caesar [...] "stealing {{the love of the}} people" [...] from him, Pompeius having once been a champion of the Plebs.

5|$|During the 16th {{century the}} Ethiopian biographical {{tradition}} became <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>complex,</b> intertextual, and broader in {{its view of}} the world given Ethiopia's direct involvement in the conflicts between the Ottoman and Portuguese empires in the Red Sea region. The annals of Dawit II (r. 1508–1540) describe the defensive war he waged against the Adal sultan Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi (r. 1527–1543), in an episodic format quite different from the earlier chronicling tradition. The chronicle of Gelawdewos, perhaps written by the Ethiopian Orthodox Church abbot Enbaqom (1470–1560), is far more detailed than any previous Ethiopian work of history. It explains the Ethiopian emperor's military alliance with Cristóvão da Gama (1516–1542), son of the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama, against the Adal Sultan al-Ghazi and his Ottoman allies, and later against the Ottoman governor of Yemen, Özdemir Pasha (d. 1560).|$|E
5|$|Cell theory led {{biologists}} to re-envision individual organisms as interdependent assemblages {{of individual}} cells. Scientists in the rising field of cytology, armed with increasingly powerful microscopes and new staining methods, soon {{found that even}} single cells were <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>complex</b> than the homogeneous fluid-filled chambers described by earlier microscopists. Robert Brown had described the nucleus in 1831, {{and by the end}} of the 19th century cytologists identified many of the key cell components: chromosomes, centrosomes mitochondria, chloroplasts, and other structures made visible through staining. Between 1874 and 1884 Walther Flemming described the discrete stages of mitosis, showing that they were not artifacts of staining but occurred in living cells, and moreover, that chromosomes doubled in number just before the cell divided and a daughter cell was produced. Much of the research on cell reproduction came together in August Weismann's theory of heredity: he identified the nucleus (in particular chromosomes) as the hereditary material, proposed the distinction between somatic cells and germ cells (arguing that chromosome number must be halved for germ cells, a precursor to the concept of meiosis), and adopted Hugo de Vries's theory of pangenes. Weismannism was extremely influential, especially in the new field of experimental embryology.|$|E
5|$|This {{practice}} was replaced in 1900 by a <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>complex</b> system of assessments and donations designed {{to raise the}} money to support strikes. This system was replaced in 1901 because it was impractical. The 1901 system required every local union and the central committee to create strike funds. Local unions would receive support for strikes from Berlin under certain circumstances, and the central Business Committee's fund would be replenished by all member organizations in amounts proportional to their membership and the average wage of their members. This system, too, proved problematic because it penalized the larger, wealthier unions— especially the construction workers in Berlin who had higher wages but also higher costs of living. From 1901 to 1903, many small organizations joined the federation, yet the FVdG's membership fell as the punitive strike support system drove some larger unions out. In 1903, the federation not only changed its name to the Free Association of German Trade Unions but also decided to return to the old system of voluntary contributions. This system remained in place until 1914. The Business Committee worked to ensure that unions contributed as much as they could. Often the committee resorted to threatening unions with expulsion in order to raise funds for a strike. Fritz Kater called this a dictatorship necessary for the movement, but local organizations still had far more autonomy than their counterparts in other German labor federations.|$|E

50|$|Another {{interesting}} progression, for him, is {{the change}} in the richness of the world at each level of being. A mineral has no world as such.

At the operational level, where the situation is <b>far</b> broader, <b>more</b> <b>complex</b> and <b>more</b> uncertain, and evolves over hours and days, the organization must collectively make sense of enemy dispositions, intentions and capabilities, as well as anticipate the (often unintended) effects of own-force actions on a complex system of systems.|$|R

Konev ordered that the 59th and 60th Armies advance frontally, while the 21st Army encircled the area from the north.

25|$|The new {{generation}} Zero-Hum P-90 Hx by Kinman has an authentic P-90 sound and appearance but is <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>complex</b> with some 202 individual parts. Sonically destructive magnetic coupling between the coils is negated by highly efficient magnetic shields around the upper coil.

Kinman advertise their P-90 Hx as having a sonically transparent 600-Ohm hum sensor which is remarkable considering the large amount of hum that P-90s put out.|$|E
25|$|The {{water system}} however was <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>complex</b> {{than just the}} {{reservoirs}} and the water conduits and involved a very sophisticated ancient system of closed pipes and irrigation.

25|$|Biblical {{scholars}} have historically {{focused on the}} textual evidence to construct the history of idolatry in Judaism, a scholarship that post-modern {{scholars have}} increasingly begun deconstructing.

50|$|Parkinson's law of triviality is C. Northcote Parkinson's 1957 {{argument}} {{that members of}} an organisation give disproportionate weight to trivial issues.

40|$|In 1932 Robbins set out {{to inquire}} about that which defines {{the subject matter of}} {{economic}} analysis: what economists can and cannot say and the method by which they can reach their conclusions. But this was <b>far</b> <b>more</b> a <b>complex</b> struggle than ‘merely’ to identify the methodology of economic analysis. At that time, he also had to cross swords with other approaches concerning the delineation of the subject of economics. On the one hand, he had to fend off historicism or the claim that social phenomena cannot be subdivided into separate spheres of examination. On the other hand, he also had to position himself vis-à-vis the empirical drive emanating from institutional economics of the time...|$|R
25|$|In comparison, LORAN was {{deliberately}} {{designed to allow}} skywaves to be used, and the resulting received signal was <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>complex.</b> The groundwave remained fairly sharp, but could be received only at shorter distances and was primarily used during the day. At night, as many as thirty different skywaves might be received from a single transmitter, often overlapped in time, creating a complex return pattern. Since the pattern depended on the atmospherics between the transmitter and receiver, the received pattern was different for the two stations. One might receive a two-bounce skywave from one station {{in the same time}} as a three-bounce wave from another, making interpretation of the display quite difficult.|$|E

25|$|In {{the latter}} part of the twentieth century, {{research}} trends shifted to more intense study of spaces like manifolds which are locally well understood (being locally homeomorphic to Euclidean space) but have complicated global behavior.
