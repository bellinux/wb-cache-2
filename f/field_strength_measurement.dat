40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a novel and efficient hybrid model combining a two-dimensional (2 -D) site-specific model and a statistical model to characterize multipath fading in indoor environments. The site-specific model describes the propagation effects of interior walls and building walls. The latter model char-acterizes {{the effect of}} scattering due to rough surface boundaries and/or randomly positioned scatterers such as furniture and per-sonnel, which significantly affects small-scale fading. The hybrid model is computationally efficient since only the 2 -D site-specific model is needed. In addition to accurately predicting mean field strength, the model can effectively quantify the relative mean contribution of diffused scattering with a factor. The factor is also an effective index to quantify the cluttering strength of the propagation environment: 1) light-cluttering situation 0 35 and 2) heavy-cluttering situation 0 65.

A large amount of experi-mental data for 2. 44 -GHz radio at many different sites shows that a Nakagami distribution describes the fading distribution well.

The method consists in magnetizing the parts and measuring the residual tangential magnetic field strength. Calibration is necessary by parts with well known case depth. Demagnetization is required too. The ultrasound backscattering is the well known base for measuring the thickness of hardened surface layers (case depth measuring) [1, 2]. However, there are some areas, where {{the application of the}} ultrasound method is difficult or even impossible. This is the matter with parts having a thickness of the hardened layer smaller than 1. 5 mm and a core strength higher than 1000 MPa. This is the matter too with parts having a complex geometry, such as crankshafts, racks and gear components, especially in the teeth area, where the distance between the teeth is to narrow for the ultrasonic sensor. Difficult too is the determination of the point, where the hardened layer is running into the unhardened part. Another problem is the unexpected appearance of unhardened areas.

Considering previous studies and the facts about potential health effects of these fields, the present study aimed to evaluate the ELF-MF flux densities from power distribution lines near hospitals in Tehran. ELF-MF measurements were performed according to IEEE standard procedures-Std 644 - 1994 near the hospitals entrances using HI- 3604 Power Frequency <b>Field</b> <b>Strength</b> <b>Measurement</b> System during three different time periods (i. e. 12 - 3 AM, 9 - 12 AM, 6 - 9 PM).

There were no statistically significant differences in ELF-MF flux densities neither among different hospital groups nor among different time periods. The ELF-MF flux densities from power distribution lines around Tehran hospitals were much less than the standards values, implying that it can be considered only in epidemiological studies.

40|$|The FORS 1 {{instrument}} on the ESO Very Large Telescope {{was used}} to obtain low-resolution circular polarised spectra of nearly a thousand different stars, {{with the aim of}} measuring their mean longitudinal magnetic fields. A catalogue of FORS 1 magnetic measurements would provide a valuable resource with which to better understand the strengths and limitations of this instrument and of similar low-dispersion, Cassegrain spectropolarimeters. However, FORS 1 data reduction has been carried out by a number of different groups using a variety of reduction and analysis techniques. Our understanding of the instrument and our data reduction techniques have both improved over time. A full re-analysis of FORS 1 archive data using a consistent and fully documented algorithm would optimise the accuracy and usefulness of a catalogue of field measurements. Based on the ESO FORS pipeline, we have developed a semi-automatic procedure for magnetic field determinations, which includes self-consistent checks for field detection reliability. We have applied our procedure to the full content of circular spectropolarimetric measurements of the FORS 1 archive. We have produced a catalogue of spectro-polarimetric observations and magnetic field measurements for about 1400 observations of about 850 different objects.

40|$|The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a {{particle}} accelerator aimed at exploring deeper into matter than ever before, {{is currently being}} constructed at CERN. Beam optics of the LHC, requires stringent control of the field quality of about 8400 superconducting magnets, including 1232 main dipoles and 360 main quadrupoles to assure the correct machine operation. The measurement challenges are various: accuracy on the <b>field</b> <b>strength</b> <b>measurement</b> up to 50 ppm, harmonics in the ppm range, measurement equipment robustness, low measurement times to characterize fast field phenomena. New magnetic measurement systems, principally based on analog solutions, have been developed at CERN to achieve these goals. This work proposes the introduction of digital technologies to improve measurement performance of three systems, aimed at different measurement target and characterized by different accuracy levels. The high accuracy measurement systems, based on rotating coils, exhibit high performance in static magnetic field. With varying magnetic field the system accuracy gets worse, independently from coil speed, due to the limited resolution of the digital integrator currently used, and the restrictions of the standard analysis. A new integrator based on ADC conversion and numerical integration is proposed. The experimental concept validation by emulating the proposed approach on a PXI platform is detailed along with the improvements {{with respect to the}} old integrators. Two new analysis algorithms to reduce the errors in dynamic measurements are presented. The first combines quadrature detection and short time Fourier transform (STFT) of the acquired magnetic flux samples; the second approach is based on the extrapolation of the magnetic flux samples. Unlike other algorithms presented in the literature, both the proposals do not require the information about the magnet current and are able to work in real time so, can be easily implemented in firmware on DSP. The performance of the new proposals are assessed in simulation. As far as medium accuracy systems are concerned, at CERN was originally developed a probe to measure the sextupolar and decapolar field harmonics of the superconducting dipoles using a suitable Hall plates arrangement for the bucking of the main dipolar field, which is, 4 orders of magnitude higher than the measurement target. The output signals of each Hall plate belonging to the same measurement ring are mixed using analog cards. The resultant signal is proportional to the field harmonic to measure. A complete metrological characterization of this sensor was carried out, showing the limitation of a fully analog solution. The main problems found were the instability of the analog compensation cards and the impossibility to correct the non linearity effects beyond the first order. An automatic calibration procedure implemented in the new instrument software is presented to guarantee measurement repeatability. In alternative a digital bucking solution, namely the compensation of the main field after the sampling of each hall plate signal by means of numerical sum, is proposed. An implementation of this approach, based on 18 bit ADC converter, over-sampling and dithering techniques as well as compensation of the Hall plates non linearity in real time is analyzed. Finally, as far as the low accuracy measurement systems are concerned, the design of an instrument based on a rotating Hall plate to check the polarity of all LHC magnets is presented. Even if this architecture is characterized by low accuracy in the measurement of field strength and phase, the results are sufficient to identify main harmonic order, type and polarity with practically no errors, thanks to an accurate definition of the measurement algorithm. A complete metrological characterization of the prototype developed and a correction of all the systematic measurement errors was carried out.

The critical frequency of the E-layer was not measurable beyond 1600 h IST on eclipse day due to the strong blanketing sporadic-E, but there is a 20 % decrease in the critical frequency of the F 1 -layer.

40|$|An inter-laboratory {{comparison}} of <b>field</b> <b>strength</b> <b>measurements</b> {{was conducted in}} order to verify the comparability of high-frequency electromagnetic field measurements. For this purpose, 17  participating teams hosted by the working group "procedures of exposure determination" of the LAI (Länderausschuss für Immissionsschutz, state committee on immission control) determined the <b>field</b> <b>strength</b> at given stations around a hospital situation. At those stations very different signals were generated, such as sine wave signals at 27 MHz and 433 MHz, signals from a diathermy device in Continuous-Wave (CW) and Pulse-Width-Modulation (PWM) mode, from a GSM base station at 900 MHz and 1800 MHz, from a UMTS base station, from a babyphone device and from a DECT cordless phone. This contribution describes {{the evaluation of the}} measured values and the approach to the computation of a reference value. Considering various sources of electromagnetic fields in the areas of personal safety at work and of immission control, the most important results are presented and the conclusions drawn are discussed...|$|R
