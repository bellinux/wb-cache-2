So hop aboard the Twilight Zone Express. Put your memory in reverse, and together, we will remember the way it was. The back page of this 44-year-old newspaper recalled the dramatic events of 1955. The polio vaccine was developed by Dr. Jonas Salk. President Eisenhower suffered a heart attack. The first atomic-powered submarine, the Nautilus, was launched.

It rained a lot {{during the}} shoot, which would shut us down because {{you could hear the}} rain on the roof, it was too loud, so we’d have to wait it out. One day we were sitting around Junior and Susie’s house, and Alec gets behind the camera and does about a five-minute {{impression}} of Tak Fujimoto. Then he moves over to the electrical department and does spot-on impressions of all of those guys. Everybody was awestruck. He also did <b>an</b> impression of <b>me</b> that was rather insulting, and very funny. What I wanted to do in that was have the audience go on that ride with Junior while he was running around and playing cop, and to really enjoy it—and the audiences I saw it with did—but then slowly I wanted to take it away from them, so that by the end they would feel a little bit guilty about having so much fun earlier on in the picture. However, it kind of backfired—we did a preview in New Jersey, and the audience was horrified when Junior died, they practically rioted when Alec was killed... Alec had a little problem with that—he wanted to be a little broader, I was afraid he was commenting on the character, but I must tell you: he was right. We didn’t really agree on set, but then he <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>call</b> later... and said: “Hey, I’m glad you made me do this and that.” I said: “I’m glad you did what you did, too.” It was a little broader than I would’ve asked him to play it, but I really like what he did.|$|R

40|$|Three {{articles}} {{from the early}} years of Molecular Biology of the Cell (MBoC) have had remarkably many citations in the literature since their publication � 10 years ago. As a coauthor of these articles and the former editor of MBoC, I was asked for possible explanations. I believe the answer lies in the unusual nature of these articles: each presents and summarizes gene expression data for nearly every gene in the yeast or human genomes. Continuing interest in the data themselves by cell biologists, rather than results or conclusions drawn by the authors, best accounts for the citation history. The flatness of the numbers of citations over time, the continuing high rate of accesses to individual Web sites set up to allow searching and display of the underlying data, and the large fraction of citations in journals focused on mathematics and computation all support the same conclusion: it’s the data. Shortly after David Drubin accepted the position of editorin-chief of Molecular Biology of the Cell (MBoC), he <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>call.</b> David wanted to talk about {{the early years of}} the journal, when Keith Yamamoto and I were responsible for its policies and editorial management. The discussion dwelt only briefly on the core values that drove the founding of the journal and its early management. After all, David had long served the journal as associate editor. David was interested in understanding something quite different. He noticed that MBoC published quite a few articles in early years that appear to have attained notable and enduring influence, as measured by their citation history. I was a coauthor of a few of these. Why did I think these articles appeared at that time in MBoC? Is there a special niche, defined by such articles? Could MBoC do more to attract such manuscripts in the future? We agreed that I would think about this and potentially write a retrospective based on the articles I coauthored.

5000|$|Click-to-call (CTC) is {{actually}} a misleading name for this technology in its most common 21st century implementation. [...] "Click-to-call" [...] technology now virtually always refers to a means for a web consumer to ask a website operator to call her.
