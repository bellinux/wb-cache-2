40|$|The biosynthetic pathway for {{tyrosine}} synthesis {{is regulated}} both by repression of enzyme synthesis and by feedback inhibition of enzyme activity in Bacillus subtilis. Nevertheless, wild-type cells produce significantly more tyrosine than {{is required for}} protein synthesis, and {{part of this is}} excreted into the medium. Alteration of nutritional and other environmental conditions of cultivation strongly influenced the amount of tyrosine excretion. The excretion of tyrosine by wild-type cells was compared with that of a regulatory mutant having a feedback-insensitive prephenate dehydrogenase. Tyrosine excretion varied directly with the in vitro activity of prephenate dehydrogenase and inversely with temperature in the two strains. The regulatory mutant excreted five times as much tyrosine as the wild type at all growth temperatures examined. The carbon source used for growth significantly influenced the level of tyrosine excretion. The specific activity of prephenate dehydrogenase was also affected by the carbon source. Incorporation studies with isotopic tyrosine and <b>fluorometric</b> <b>determinations</b> of tyrosine concentrations extractable in hot water were used to measure operationally the tyrosine pools in the mutant and wild-type strains.

40|$|A {{series of}} Escherichia coli K- 12 AB 1157 strains with normal and {{defective}} deoxyribonucleic acid repair capacity were {{more resistant to}} treatment with 8 -methoxypsoralen (8 -MOP) and near-ultraviolet light (NUV) than a comparable series of strains from the B/r WP 2 family although sensitivities to 254 -nm ultraviolet light were closely similar. The difference was most marked with strains deficient in both excision and postreplication repair (uvrA recA). The hypothesis that the internal level of 8 -MOP was lower in K- 12 than B/r uvrA recA derivatives was ruled out {{on the basis of}} <b>fluorometric</b> <b>determinations</b> of 8 -MOP content and the similar inactivation curves for phage T 3 treated intracellularly within the two strains. The demonstration of liquid holding recovery with AB 2480 but not WP 100 (both recA uvrA strains) and the somewhat greater resistance of the former strain to inactivation by captan revealed the presence in the K- 12 strain of a deoxyribonucleic acid repair system independent of the recA+ and uvrA+ genes. The presence of this repair system did not, however, affect the survival of T 3 phage treated with 8 -MOP plus NUV and probably has a relatively small effect on survival of AB 2480 under normal conditions. Experiments in which 8 -MOP monoadducts were converted to cross-links by a second NUV exposure in the absence of 8 -MOP indicated that the level of potentially cross-linkable monoadducts immediately after 8 -MOP + NUV is about eightfold lower in K- 12 -than in B/r-derived strains. It is therefore suggested that the photoproduct yield in the former is well below that in the latter. In agreement with this is the observation that, during the first 10 min after treatment, deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis was just over five times more sensitive to inhibition by 8 -MOP plus NUV in WP 100 than in AB 2480. We assume that 8 -MOP in K- 12 bacteria is hindered in some way from adsorbing to cellular (though not to phage T 3) deoxyribonucleic acid. Consistent with this, 8 -MOP has been shown to act as an inhibitor of a component of repair of 254 -nm ultraviolet light damage in WP 2 but not in AB 1157...|$|R

Recovery experiments averaged 98 - 101 %. The standard deviation for duplicate determina-tions averaged ± 0. 20 mg/ 100 ml. EXPERIENCE with the automated colorimetric (1) and <b>fluorometric</b> (2) <b>determination</b> of serum calcium has indicated they are not suitable for use with serums which are icteric (3), lipernic (4), or contain abnormal concentrations of sonic protein fractions (5). Tn the colorimetric method {{this is due to the}} use of 1 N HC 1 as sample diluent to promote complete ionization of serum calcium before dialysis. During this acidi-fication step, protein precipitation occurs with those samples containing abnormal levels of some protein fractions (ie macroglobulins). The fluorometric method does not have the protein precipitation problem since saline is used for sample dilution. However, it has been found to be unreliable for use with lipemic and icteric serums, since excessive concentrations of lipids and bile pigments interfere with the fluores-cence of the calcein-calcium complex. The fluorometric calciuni procedure presented in this report can be reliably used for a wider variety of pathologic serums than either the colorimetricor fluorometric method mentioned above. Dialysis is used to eliminate bile pigment and lipid interference with fluorescence. In addition, the incidence of protein precipitation in the flow stream is minimized by use of a smaller sample volume and an HC 1 concentration one-fifth (ie 0. 2 N) of that used in the colorimetric procedure.

40|$|Summary: A {{combined}} adsorption-gel filtration {{technique has}} been developed for the quantitation of the cortisol-bin-ding capacity of transcortin: Endogenous steroids are removed from plasma by adsorption on uncoated charcoal. Saturation of the "stripped " binding sites of transcortin is accomplished by equilibrating the sample with a definite amount of labeled cortisol of low specific activity (0. 1 ^Ci/^g). Transcortin-bound [4 - 14 C]cortisol is isolated by gel filtration over Sephadex G- 50 at 4 °C and measured by liquid scintillation counting. The cortisol-binding capacity of transcortin is calculated directly {{on the basis of}} the known specific activity of cortisol. The modification described eliminates methodological disadvantages associated with the original gel filtration procedures, i. e. the possible inter-ference of various endogenous steroids with cortisol binding to transcortin, and the necessity of <b>fluorometric</b> or colori-metric <b>determination</b> of protein-bound cortisol.

This procedure has proved to be less discriminant {{over the past few years}} because of changes in newborn feeding and because of early discharge of newborns from the nursery. We have developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to measure the deficient enzyme in HT in dried-blood spots. Fumarylacetoacetase (FAH) (E.

This improvement in the fluorometric method for the determination of phenylalanine was accomplished by (1) decreasing the initial incubation pH from 5. 8 to 5. 0, and (2) increasingthe incubation temperature from 60 #{ 176 }to 85 #{ 176 }. A study of the effect of pH on the fluorescence level in both the acid and alkaline reactions demonstrated the presence of fluorescence pH plateaus. These plateaus indicate that the fluores-cence level was relatively unaffected by a change in pH within specified ranges. A study of the specificity led to the discovery that the inclusion of a peptide control was necessary to correct for one type of nonspecific fluorescence.

A discussion of sensor methodology for the monitoring of reaction intermediates is presented and a simple kinetic model for predicting the time dependent response of such sensors is developed. Two possible mechanisms for the Fujiwara reaction with chloroform are discussed. The effect of pyridine, water, and base concentrations on reaction kinetics was evaluated to develop single-phase Fujiwara reagent mixtures for both <b>fluorometric</b> and spectrophotometric <b>determinations</b> of chloroform. A unique "continuous-exposure" apparatus allowing vapor phase transport of chloroform from an aqueous sample to a conventional cuvette was constructed. The spectrophotometric detection limit for chloroform is 11 ng/mL and the method was shown to be suitable {{for the analysis of}} tap water. Two fiber optic chemical sensors (FOCS) for the detection of chloroform were developed. An aliquot of the optimized fluorometric reagent solution is held in contact with the fiber optic probe within a light-tight enclosure and is isolated from a bulk sample by a trapped headspace. One FOCS utilizes 1. 3 mL of reagent held in a reservoir and the other utilizes a 10 -μL drop of reagent suspended on the sensing tips of the fiber optic probe. Chloroform vapor from the sample migrates into the FOCS and reacts with the reagent to produce a fluorescent reaction intermediate which is monitored at 590 nm; the rate of increase in the fluorescence signal is related to chloroform concentration. Both FOCSs give detection limits better than 0. 1 ng/mL. The response and total measurement times are comparable for the two FOCSs, and the duration of the linear response is limited by inner-filter effects.

The same identifiability criterion is applicable for systems where quenching can be neglected. The linked parameters in the global analysis are rational functions of the rate constants, independent of the excitation and emission wavelengths. The developed algorithms for the global parametric fit of fluorometric titration curves are explored using simulations. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Inhibition of the {{angiotensin}} I converting enzyme (ACE) is {{an important}} therapeutic approach {{in the treatment of}} several cardiovascular disorders. In this study the inhibitory potential of procyanidin-rich fractions of grape seed (Vitis vinifera L.) was evaluated. The inhibitory capacity was assayed by <b>fluorometric</b> <b>determination</b> of the amount of histidyl-leucine released from the substrate utilized in the presence of ACE from rabbit lung. Four purified monomers [(+) -catechin, (-) -epicatechin, (+) -catechin-O-gallate, and (-) -epigallocatechin] were also tested for comparison. Results showed that the natural phenolic extracts exhibit higher inhibitory potential than the monomers, and that fractions with higher average degrees of polymerization (DPn = 8, IC 50 = 0. 1 mg/L) present lower IC 50 than the intermediate ones (DPn = 5, IC 50 = 3. 5 mg/L). Such findings strengthen the idea that the inhibitor extension, and the number of heterocyclic oxygen and hydroxyl groups in their structures, could define their in vitro action.

40|$|Edwardsiella tarda, a Gram-negative {{member of}} the family Enterobacteriaceae, has been implicated in {{significant}} losses in aquaculture facilities worldwide. Here, we assessed the intra-specific variability of E. tarda isolates from 4 different fish species in the eastern United States. Repetitive sequence mediated PCR (rep-PCR) using 4 different primer sets (ERIC I 2 ̆ 6 II, ERIC II, BOX, and GTG 5) and multi-locus sequence analysis of 16 S SSU rDNA, groEl, gyrA, gyrB, pho, pgi, pgm, and rpoA gene fragments identified two distinct genotypes of E. tarda (DNA group I; DNA group II). Isolates that fell into DNA group II demonstrated more similarity to E. ictaluri than DNA group I, which contained the reference E. tarda strain (ATCC # 15947). Conventional PCR analysis using published E. tarda-specific primer sets yielded variable results, with several primer sets producing no observable amplification of target DNA from some isolates. <b>Fluorometric</b> <b>determination</b> of G + C content demonstrated 56. 4...|$|E
40|$|We have {{synthesized}} water dispersible CdTe {{quantum dots}} (QDs) in different sizes and with various capping reagents, and {{have studied the}} effects of their size on the sensitivity and selectivity in the <b>fluorometric</b> <b>determination</b> of metal ions, particularly of silver(I). It is found that {{an increase in the}} particle size of homocysteine-capped CdTe QDs from 1. 7 nm to 3. 3 nm and to 3. 7 nm enhances both the sensitivity and selectivity of the determination of Ag(I) to give an ultimate limit of detection as low as 8. 3 nM. This effect can partially be explained by the better passivation of surface traps on smaller sized QDs via adsorption of Ag(I), thereby decreasing the apparent detection efficiency. In addition, the presence of CdS in the CdTe QDs is likely to play a role. The study demonstrates that an improvement in sensing performance is accomplished by using QDs of fine-tuned particle sizes. Such effects are likely also to occur with other QD-based optical probes...|$|E
