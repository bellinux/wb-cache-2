40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} {{public opinion}} on <b>common</b> European <b>policies</b> in foreign affairs and defence. It proposes three models of support for <b>common</b> <b>policies</b> in these fields. Drawing on Eurobarometer data, the analysis shows that instrumental self-interest and territorial identities contribute considerably to explaining support for common foreign affairs and defence policies. Moreover, support for <b>common</b> <b>policies</b> is strongly driven by domain-specific evaluations of the European Union's performance. These findings suggest that popular support for <b>common</b> European <b>policies</b> in foreign affairs and defence has an experiential base. Thus, elites {{have an incentive to}} respond to public opinion when making policy decisions, so this analysis supports the liberal view in international relations rather than the realist account...|$|R
