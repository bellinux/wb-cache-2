Major discoveries {{can be made}} in one branch of mathematics and be relevant to another, yet the relationship goes undiscovered for lack of social contact between mathematicians. Social constructivists argue each speciality forms its own <b>epistemic</b> <b>community</b> and often has great difficulty communicating, or motivating the investigation of unifying conjectures that might relate different areas of mathematics. Social constructivists see the process of [...] "doing mathematics" [...] as actually creating the meaning, while social realists see a deficiency either of human capacity to abstractify, or of human's cognitive bias, or of mathematicians' collective intelligence as preventing the comprehension of a real universe of mathematical objects. Social constructivists sometimes reject the search for foundations of mathematics as bound to fail, as pointless or even meaningless.|$|E

Through the advent of a novel class of objects {{at the end of the}} 1970 s in Europe and the USA, namely plant elicitors that trigger the plant's own defence reactions, we witness how dissent between <b>epistemic</b> <b>communities</b> appears where assimilation had been the rule. The convergence between the industry and the academia as a coherent " phytosanitary universe ", despite the fact that they are made of several <b>epistemic</b> <b>communities,</b> is put to the test by plant elicitors, which do not fit exactly within existing categories. The plasticity of plant elicitors who can serve both as epistemic things and technical objects (Rheinberger 1997) does not suffice to qualify them as boundary objects bridging diverging communities. In particular, the specific arrangement of <b>epistemic</b> <b>communities</b> that they reveal can be described as Matryoshka dolls.

40|$|Almost {{two decades}} ago, Peter M.

Specifically, the approach was designed to address decision-making instances characterized by technical complexity and uncertainty. Control over the production of knowledge and information enables <b>epistemic</b> <b>communities</b> to articulate cause and effect relationships and so frame issues for collective debate. Remarkably however, we still know very little about the variety of ways in which decision-makers actually learn from <b>epistemic</b> <b>communities.</b> This article suggests that variety is best captured by differentiating between the control enjoyed by decision-makers and <b>epistemic</b> <b>communities</b> over the production of substantive knowledge – or means – that informs policy {{on the one hand and}} the policy objectives – or ends – to which that knowledge is directed on the other.

As long as knowledge about the world politics' reality has a causal impact on this reality, those players who posses and control knowledge have a dominant role in the game. Yet, <b>epistemic</b> <b>communities</b> are not a single, coherent body.

Epistemic communities also have brought attention to the habitat fragmentation and decline of biodiversity on the planet. This has led to reform throughout the world creating conservation agencies and policies. In California, an ecological <b>epistemic</b> <b>community</b> succeeded in creating the Memorandum of Understanding Biological Diversity (MOU on Biodiversity). The agreement covered all habitats and species in California for protection. The MOU on Biodiversity was followed by the Endangered Species Act which applied to all of the United States. Epistemic communities have a direct effect on agenda setting in intergovernmental organizations and indirect effect on the behavior of small countries. The ideas and policies of an <b>epistemic</b> <b>community</b> can become orthodoxy through the work of that community and through socialization.

5000|$|An <b>epistemic</b> <b>community</b> is a {{transnational}} {{network of}} knowledge-based experts who help decision-makers {{to define the}} problems they face, identify various policy solutions and assess the policy outcomes. The definitive conceptual framework of an <b>epistemic</b> <b>community</b> is widely accepted as that of Peter M. Haas. He describes them as [...] "...a network of professionals with recognised expertise and competence in a particular domain and an authoritative claim to policy relevant knowledge within that domain or issue-area."Although the members of an <b>epistemic</b> <b>community</b> may originate {{from a variety of}} academic or professional backgrounds, they are linked by a set of unifying characteristics for the promotion of collective amelioration and not collective gain. This is termed their [...] "normative component". In the big picture, epistemic communities are socio-psychological entities that create and justify knowledge. Such communities can constitute of only two persons and yet gain an important role in building knowledge on any specific subject. Miika Vähämaa has recently suggested that epistemic communities consist of persons being able to understand, discuss and gain self-esteem concerning the matters being discussed.|$|E
50|$|As a result, <b>epistemic</b> <b>communities</b> have {{a direct}} input on how {{international}} cooperation may develop in the long term.

The transnational nature of <b>epistemic</b> <b>communities</b> means numerous states may absorb new patterns of logic and behaviour, leading {{to the adoption of}} concordant state policies. Therefore, the likelihood of convergent state behaviour and associated international coordination is increased.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{contributes}} {{to the analysis of}} where and how both exploitation and exploration may take place inside and between communities and organizations. It connects with the discussion of differences between communities of practice and <b>epistemic</b> <b>communities.</b> The analysis allows for differences in cognition within communities of practice (‘cognitive distance’). Such distance yields potential novelty but creates problems in utilizing that potential. In communities of practice and <b>epistemic</b> <b>communities</b> different trade-offs are made between {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} cognitive distance. Communities of practice are more oriented at exploitation, at relatively small cognitive distance. Exploration may take place in <b>epistemic</b> <b>communities,</b> with larger internal cognitive distance, but may also arise from interaction between different communities of practice, utilizing the distance between them. Organizations serve to provide the basis for the governance of such interaction. This, however, does limit the cognitive distance, and hence exploration potential, within an organization. For more radical exploration, interaction is needed between organizations, at the price of greater efforts to set up and govern collaboration. Next to <b>communities</b> of practice, <b>epistemic</b> <b>communities</b> and organizations, the analysis also includes communities of professionals across different organizations. They also have a role to play in a wider system of organizational forms for exploitation and exploration. ...|$|R

40|$|We analyse the {{question}} of what role and positions <b>epistemic</b> <b>communities</b> have in the agora, and more specifically in the new mediating organizations that are established at the interface of the state, businesses and universities. These new organizational structures embody the present politics of knowledge that reign in national science policy globally. The new organizational structures, as potentially new agoras, also epitomize several of the changes that have taken place in the science and industry landscape of the past decades all over Europe and the world. We are interested in understanding how <b>epistemic</b> <b>communities</b> are situated vis-�-vis agora in knowledge production. The empirical example comes from Finland, where major new institutional reforms in science policy, the new strategic centres of science, technology and innovations, have been implemented to create possibilities for new knowledge creation and new product and service development. These centres of science, technology and innovations (CSTIs) were originally planned as functioning agoras, open, simultaneous and joint platforms for the state, businesses, researchers and universities.

40|$|This paper {{suggests}} a new synthesis of knowledge-based {{approaches to the}} theory of the firm. It employs a social-constructivist and contextual conceptualization of knowledge as residing in groups of practitioners, <b>epistemic</b> <b>communities,</b> arguing that the ease or difficulty of sharing knowledge is more dependent on the cognitive capabilities of the exchange partners than on the characteristics of the knowledge they exchange. On the basis of this conceptualization, a simple typology of four basic knowledge processes is proposed: articulation, replication, combination and integration. The latter requires exchange and reconciliation of knowledge across <b>epistemic</b> <b>communities,</b> whose members are often unfamiliar with one another’s specialized codes, theories and tools (Grant, 1996 a, 1996 b). Firms constitute <b>epistemic</b> <b>communities</b> in their own right, conferring on their members the means by which specialist knowledge can be effectively combined and integrated.

50|$|An <b>epistemic</b> <b>community</b> in {{international}} relations (IR) is a network of professionals with recognized knowledge and skill in a particular issue-area.

Third, they share notions of validity, or internationally defined criteria for validating knowledge in their area of know-how. However, the members are from all different professions. Epistemic communities also have a common set of practices associated with a set of problems towards which their professional knowledge is directed, because of the belief that human welfare will benefit as a result. Communities evolve independently and without influence of authority or government. They {{do not have to be}} large; some are made up of only a few members.
