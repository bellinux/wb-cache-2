25|$|And this {{is clearly}} {{theoretically}} correct, since it is leading order and <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>all</b> the symmetries into account. But it doesn't match experiment. The interaction that does couples the nucleons to the gradient of the pion field.|$|E

He {{came to power}} years before when he murdered his brother, the previous king, and drove his brother's wife and infant son, Ignosi, out into the desert to die. Twala's rule is unchallenged. An evil, impossibly ancient hag named Gagool is his chief advisor. She roots out any potential opposition by ordering regular witch hunts and murdering without trial all those identified as traitors. When she singles out Umbopa for this fate, <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>all</b> Quatermain's skill to save his life.|$|E
500|$|Grant waged {{his bloody}} Overland Campaign in 1864. This is often {{characterized}} as a war of attrition, given high Union losses at battles such as the Battle of the Wilderness and Cold Harbor. Even though they {{had the advantage of}} fighting on the defensive, the Confederate forces had [...] "almost as high a percentage of casualties as the Union forces". The high casualty figures of the Union alarmed the North; Grant had lost a third of his army, and Lincoln asked what Grant's plans were, to which the general replied, [...] "I propose to fight it out on this line if <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>all</b> summer." ...|$|E
500|$|The final season, , is set {{three years}} later. Korra slowly recovers from the {{injuries}} incurred {{in the fight}} with Zaheer, traveling the world alone and haunted by fear. Meanwhile, Suyin's former head of security, Kuvira, reunites the fractured Earth Kingdom with the metalbenders loyal to her, and refuses to release power to the unpopular heir to the throne, Prince Wu. At the head of her new, totalitarian [...] "Earth Empire", Kuvira seizes Suyin's city of Zaofu and sets her sights on the United Republic, which she claims for her nation. With Toph Beifong's help, Korra frees herself of the remnants of Zaheer's poison, but after losing a duel to Kuvira at Zaofu, she allows Zaheer to help her overcome her fears and fully reconnect with her Avatar Spirit, Raava. When Kuvira attacks Republic City with a giant mecha carrying a spirit-powered superweapon, <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>all</b> the efforts of Korra and her friends, including the inventor Varrick and his assistant Zhu Li, to stop the colossus. Only after Kuvira's weapon blows open a third portal to the Spirit World, destroying much of the city, does she concede defeat. The series ends {{with the prospect of}} democracy for the former Earth Kingdom, and with Korra and Asami leaving together for a vacation in the Spirit World.|$|E

500|$|As {{production}} continued, Tom Hall {{dubbed the}} game's scripting language [...] "APE" [...] (Anachronox Programming Language). Hall explained, [...] "I call it my new Apple II because it's {{so much fun}} to program in and <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>all</b> the drudgery out of it. It's sort of if you mushed together C, Basic and Java in a wayâ€”for programming people it's sort of Windows based. It began as a defined dialogue window, but provided variables so that you could position and move a picture. So from there it grew like UNIX with little bits and pieces, and you have things that initialize data to the window, things that constantly update the window, and things that happen after the window, in little code chunks and with that you can do any little thing." [...] Hall wrote and coded the mini-game Bugaboo for Anachronox in 15 hours to demonstrate the environment's simplicity. Other tools developed for the game were B.E.D. (a battle editor), ION Radiant (for level design, based on QERadiant), NoxDrop (for item and character placement), and Planet (a spline-based camera system coded by Joey Liaw). Ion Storm worked with QuakeEd developer Robert Duffy to create QERadiant, later adapted to ION Radiant. Hall lauded Planet: [...] "you can control entities on paths, trigger events, manipulate particles, and do just about anything you please. One of the more common team beliefs is that the only true limit to Planet is the person controlling it." [...] Hall aimed to provide several end-user modification tools, such as one to allow gamers to create their own MysTech elements. Other programs would allow implementation of new dialogue, voice-acting, and camera work. Ion Storm developed tutorials and documentation for each tool.|$|E

Following {{publication of the}} magazine's survey in May 2008, Towson High's then-principal Jane Barranger, said: [...] "I'm very proud of our parents and our kids and our teachers. <b>It</b> <b>takes</b> <b>all</b> of their efforts {{to make sure that}} students are prepared to take challenging tests."

2500|$|Despite his reverses on May 10, Grant {{had reason}} for optimism. The one bright {{spot in the}} day had been the partial success of Emory Upton's {{innovative}} assault. He recognized the failure stemming {{from the lack of}} support and reasoned that using the same tactics with an entire corps might be successful. Grant was then visited by General Wright, the new commander of the VI Corps, who suggested that the May 10 assaults had failed due to poor support, particularly from Mott's division. Wright told General Meade, [...] "General, I don't want Mott's troops on my left; they are not a support. I would rather have no troops there." [...] He assigned Hancock's II Corps to the assault on the Mule Shoe, while Burnside's IX Corps attacked the eastern end of the salient and Warren's V Corps and Wright's VI Corps applied pressure to Laurel Hill. On the morning of May 11, Grant sent a famous message to the Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton: [...] "The result to this time is much in our favor. Our losses have been heavy {{as well as those of}} the enemy. ... I propose to fight it out on this line if <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>all</b> summer." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} mainly written and {{recorded}} in the girls' home in Los Angeles with German songwriter Toby Gad. Jessica Origliasso states [...] "It was really great. Toby works on a simplified set-up on his Mac computer. <b>It</b> <b>takes</b> <b>all</b> the pressure out {{of being in a}} recording studio. We were able to take our time and get it right and not stress about time ticking." [...] When working on the album the girls knew exactly which songwriters they wanted to work with including Billy Steinberg (who has worked with Madonna) and John Feldmann (who has worked with Good Charlotte and The Used). The songwriting saw the girls write about personal things in life mainly to do with love. The song [...] "Revenge Is Sweeter (Than You Ever Were)" [...] is about a person who Lisa Origliasso dated overseas, she states [...] "When it comes down to it, that song's about cheating. A {{lot of people have been}} through it, like I've been through it, so it was very easy to relate to that situation. And I saw that whole situation go on, so it wasn't hard to write that song with her." [...] Another personal song includes [...] "In Another Life", is the most emotional song they've ever written. Lisa states that [...] "While recording this song we couldn't sing it properly because we were bawling our eyes out". Jess says, [...] "You actually hear me sniffing in the background".|$|E
2500|$|Although the Wilderness {{battle was}} costly for the Union, Grant {{decided to move}} south and {{continue}} the fight with Lee. [...] As the Army of the Potomac moved southward from the Wilderness, Grant, on May 8, was forced into yet an even more desperate 14-day battle at Spotsylvania. Anticipating Grant's right flank move, Lee was able to position his army at Spotsylvania Court House before Grant and his army could arrive. The battle started on May 10. [...] Although Lee's Army of Northern Virginia was located in an exposed rough arc known as the [...] "Mule Shoe", his army resisted multiple assaults from Grant's Army of the Potomac {{for the first six}} days of the battle. The fiercest fighting in the battle took place on a point known as [...] "Bloody angle". Rifles refused to fire due to the troops gunpowder getting wet from rainy weather and they were forced into a bloody hand-to-hand struggle similar to battles fought in ancient times. Both Confederates and Union soldiers were slaughtered and men were piled {{on top of each other}} in their attempt to control the point. [...] By May 21, the fighting had finally stopped; Grant had lost 18,000 men with 3,000 having been killed in the prolonged battle. [...] Many talented Confederate officers were killed in the battle with Lee's Army significantly damaged having a total of 10â€“13,000 casualties. [...] The popular Union Maj. Gen. John Sedgwick of the VI corps was killed in the battle by a sharpshooter and replaced by Maj. Gen. Horatio G. Wright. [...] During the fighting at Spotsylvania, Grant stated, [...] "I will fight it on this line if <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>all</b> summer." ...|$|E
