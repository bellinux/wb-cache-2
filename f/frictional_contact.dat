2500|$|Contact {{mechanics}} is {{the study}} of the deformation of solids that touch each other at one or more points. A central distinction in contact mechanics is between stresses acting perpendicular to the contacting bodies' surfaces (known as the normal direction) and frictional stresses acting tangentially between the surfaces. This page focuses mainly on the normal direction, i.e. on frictionless contact mechanics. <b>Frictional</b> <b>contact</b> mechanics is discussed separately. [...] Normal stresses are caused by applied forces and by the adhesion present on surfaces in close contact even if they are clean and dry.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the stability of planar mechanisms supported by multiple <b>frictional</b> <b>contacts</b> against gravity. Stability of equilibrium postures is investigated under initial perturbations which may involve sliding or separa-tion at the <b>contacts.</b> The <b>frictional</b> dynamics is formulated using the notion of contact modes, and the related problems of solution ambiguity and inconsistency are reviewed. The paper then uses the condition of strong equilibrium to eliminate ambiguities, and defines a new condition of kinematic-strong equilibrium which additionally eliminates frictional inconsistencies. It is then proven that strong equilibrium is necessary for stability of frictional equilibrium postures, and that kinematic-strong equi-librium guarantees finite-time recovery of an initially perturbed contact. The results are demonstrated on a reduced model of a rigid body having a variable center-of-mass and supported by two <b>frictional</b> <b>contacts.</b> A companion paper completes the analysis of this reduced problem by investigating the overall hybrid dynamics and deriving sufficient conditions for its stability.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a hierarchical approach {{for the analysis}} and design of systems with multiple <b>frictional</b> <b>contacts,</b> {{with a focus on}} applications to the design of part feeding and assembly processes. The simplest model in the hierarchy is the geometric model described by a set of non-penetration constraints that depends only on the geometry of the design. The model with the highest fidelity is one that incorporates rigid body dynamics, joint constraints, and <b>frictional</b> <b>contacts.</b> Our approach is based on a scheme that first uses Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs) to explore and prune the feasible set of design parameters. The next step is to redesign the system iteratively with the pruned parameter set using a model with higher fidelity. This process is repeated with improved models, until an optimal design is obtained with the model of desired fidelity. We illustrate the models, the design process, and the feasibility of this hierarchical approach by applying it to the design of a simple part feeder...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a hybrid mobility system that combines {{the advantages of}} both legged and wheeled locomotion. The legs of the hybrid mobility system permit it to surmount obstacles and navigate difficult terrain, while the wheels allow efficient locomotion on prepared surfaces and a reliable passive mechanism for supporting {{the weight of the}} vehicle. The paper addresses the modeling, analysis and control of such hybrid mobility systems using the specific example of a wheelchair with two powered rear wheels, two passive front casters, and two powered articulated 2 degree-of-freedom legs. Such systems, typically, rely on multiple <b>frictional</b> <b>contacts</b> with the ground for support and for locomotion.

We show that a suitable lumped model of compliance in the normal and tangential directions can be used to establish uniqueness and existence. We also show how this model can be used for rigid body dynamic simulation. The second contribution of the paper is a rigid body impact model {{that can be used for}} simulating impacts with multiple concurrent <b>frictional</b> <b>contacts.</b> We show that the same compliant contact model, when used in small time intervals, yields solutions for the normal and tangential impulses that occur during impacts.

40|$|Surface {{roughness}} affects many {{properties of}} colloids, from depletion [1] and capillary interactions [2], to their dispersibility [3] and use as emulsion stabilizers [4]. It also impacts particle-particle <b>frictional</b> <b>contacts,</b> which have recently emerged as {{being responsible for}} the discontinuous shear thickening (DST) of dense suspensions [5 - 17]. Tribological properties of these contacts have been rarely experimentally accessed [6, 15, 17, 18], especially for non-spherical particles. Here, we systematically tackle the effect of nanoscale surface roughness by producing a library of all-silica, raspberry-like colloids [19] and linking their rheology to their tribology. Rougher surfaces lead to a significant anticipation of DST onset, {{both in terms of}} shear rate and solid loading. Strikingly, they also eliminate continuous thickening. DST is here due to the interlocking of asperities, which we have identified as "stick-slip" <b>frictional</b> <b>contacts</b> by measuring the sliding of the same particles via lateral force microscopy (LFM). Direct measurements of particle-particle friction therefore highlight the value of an engineering-tribology approach to tuning the thickening of suspensions...|$|R
