500|$|Since Hiranyaksha had not {{included}} the boar {{in the list}} of animals that {{would not be able to}} kill him, Vishnu assumes this form with huge tusks and goes down to the primordial ocean. In the Bhagavata Purana, Varaha emerges as a tiny beast (a size of a thumb) from the nostrils of Brahma, but soon starts to grow. Varaha's size increases to that of an elephant and then to that of an enormous mountain. The scriptures emphasize his gigantic size. The Vayu Purana describes Varaha as 10 yojanas (The range of a yojana is disputed and ranges between [...] ) in width and a 1000 yojanas in height. He is large as a mountain and blazing like the sun. Dark like a rain cloud in complexion, his tusks are white, sharp and fearsome. His body is the size of the space between the earth and the sky. His thunderous roar <b>is</b> <b>frightening.</b> In one instance, his mane is so fiery and fearsome that Varuna, the god of the waters, requests Varaha to save him from it. Varaha complies and folds his mane.|$|E

500|$|Religion {{is also a}} {{dominant}} theme of The Historian. Dracula is Christian and, as Bebergal explains, [...] "Much of what <b>is</b> <b>frightening</b> in the novel is the suggestion of heretical Christian practices and conspiratorial monks." [...] Kostova herself notes {{that the world is}} still [...] "wracked by religious conflict", therefore historical fiction about the topic is relevant. The portions of the novel set in Istanbul, for example, highlight {{the extent to which the}} real Vlad detested the Ottomans, waging holy war upon them. More specifically, Amir Taheri in Asharq Alawsat argues that the novel highlights the relationship between the West and Turkey. The West, which is laden with the [...] "dead" [...] weight of this past (represented by the vampires) needs the help of Turkey (and perhaps the entire Muslim world) to recover. As Taheri points out, one of the most appealing characters in the novel is Professor Bora, a Turkish professor who is part of an ancient Ottoman society dedicated to defeating Dracula. Taheri emphasizes that the novel highlights that [...] "Western civilisation and Islam have common enemies represented by 'vampires' such as postmodernism in Europe and obscurantism in the Muslim world".|$|E
500|$|The film's {{stature and}} {{following}} has grown steadily since its original release, and {{it now has}} cult movie status. [...] Director Martin Scorsese placed The Haunting first on his list of the 11 scariest horror films of all time. Richard Johnson says that Steven Spielberg considers The Haunting one of the [...] "seminal films" [...] of his youth, and Robert Wise says that Spielberg told him The Haunting was [...] "the scariest film ever made!" [...] Richard Armstrong in Rough Guide to Film (2007) called it [...] "one of the most frightening films ever made", and said Julie Harris' performance is played [...] "with an intensity that <b>is</b> <b>frightening</b> in itself". In 2010, The Guardian newspaper ranked it as the 13th-best horror film of all time. However, not all critics think so highly of the film; Yoram Allon and Neil LaBute have stated that they believe the film is [...] "frankly overrated", and professional filmmaker Russell Evans has argued that few people truly find the film shocking or disturbing. As of October 2014, review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes scores the film with an 86% rating based on 36 reviews. The film was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Director (Robert Wise).|$|E

2500|$|In an interview, Irwin {{described}} {{a late night}} conversation at a Waffle House that he had with Cyndi Craven (a friend, musician and Irwin's website designer):... and I was talking about what I have to tell myself {{all the time when}} I'm afraid about doing something that hasn't been done before because it really <b>is</b> <b>frightening</b> to step out and do something different. So I will tell myself, [...] "Don’t be afraid to be amazing". Cyndi said, [...] "Where did you get that?" [...] I said, [...] "I made it up". [...] Craven subsequently posted the quotation on the internet and it now appears on hundreds of websites.|$|E
2500|$|... "But," [...] David Clowney writes, [...] "freedom <b>is</b> <b>frightening,</b> and it {{is easier}} to run from it into the safety of roles and realities that are defined by society, or even by your own past. To be free is to be thrown into {{existence}} with no [...] "human nature" [...] as an essence to define you, and no definition of the reality into which you are thrown, either. To accept this freedom is to live [...] "authentically"; but most of us run from authenticity. In the most ordinary affairs of daily life, we face the challenge of authentic choice, and the temptation of comfortable inauthenticity. All of Roquentin's experiences are related to these themes from Sartre's philosophy." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{a highly}} cited 1973 {{article in the}} Yale Law Journal, Professor John Hart Ely criticized Roe as a {{decision}} that [...] "is not constitutional law and gives almost no sense of an obligation to try to be." [...] Ely added: [...] "What <b>is</b> <b>frightening</b> about Roe is that this super-protected right is not inferable from {{the language of the}} Constitution, the framers’ thinking respecting the specific problem in issue, any general value derivable from the provisions they included, or the nation's governmental structure." [...] Professor Laurence Tribe had similar thoughts: [...] "One of the most curious things about Roe is that, behind its own verbal smokescreen, the substantive judgment on which it rests is nowhere to be found." [...] Liberal law professors Alan Dershowitz, Cass Sunstein, and Kermit Roosevelt have also expressed disappointment with Roe.|$|E
