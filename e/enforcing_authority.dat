25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, the {{government}} was required to implement several European directives including one on fire safety. This was {{at the height of}} deregulation and the government, architects, commerce and industry considered that fire brigades were too inflexible and demanded belt and braces solutions. They and the directive called for a new approach to fire safety and demanded a cheaper and more flexible system. They decided the prescriptive method used by the fire service should be replaced by a more flexible fire risk assessment approach and consequently the Fire Precautions (Workplace) Regulations 1997 (SI 1997/1840) was placed on the statute books using section 12 of the 1971 Act. They also wanted the responsibility of implementing the legislation to be removed from the fire service and placed on the employers, but the fire service would be the <b>enforcing</b> <b>authority</b> for the legislation. It was implemented using the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations, 1992 (MHSAW) (replaced in 1999).|$|E
