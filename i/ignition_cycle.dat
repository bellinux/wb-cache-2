Opening the points causes the current through the primary coil to stop. Without the steady current through the primary, the magnetic field generated in the coil immediately collapses. This high rate of change of magnetic flux induces a high voltage in the coil's secondary windings that ultimately causes the spark plug's gap to arc and ignite the fuel.|$|E

Research is being carried out to predict the faults {{that are going to}} occur in near future by the analysis of current values of vehicle variables. The presented work stressed on the application of Markov chains for the early detection of misfire fault in spark ignition engines. To define the states of Markov chains a novel hybrid model is presented to represent SI engine under steady state conditions. A survey of existing mathematical models of SI engine is provided. The hybrid model of SI engine was not widely studied area in the past. The proposed hybrid model with both continuous and discrete states is described in details. The basic assumption of modeling is that the cylinder contributing engine power is the basic active sub-component that provides power for useful work as well as to other cylinders that need power for compression, suction or exhaust. The cylinder providing power is considered as the active cylinder. The active cylinder is switched periodically in a cyclic manner. The continuous states of hybrid model are defined by considering each cylinder of SI engine as the sub-systems of hybrid model. The switching of active cylinder is considered as discrete state of hybrid model. The model is simulated to study the crankshaft speed fluctuations observed in SI engine. The simulation results are then verified experimentally on 1300 cc engine of a production vehicle from Honda by acquiring data using Data Acquisition Cards of National Instrument Inc. The properties of presented model are then studied and some results are established for onward stochastic analysis. The crankshaft speed fluctuation signal is analyzed using the properties of the proposed model and it is established that the peak values of observed speed during an <b>ignition</b> <b>cycle</b> is Gaussian and Markov. The peak value of crankshaft speed observed in each <b>ignition</b> <b>cycle</b> is associated with one of the cylinders or sub-systems. In this way four possible states are identified where ith state correspond to the peak value of crankshaft speed associated with ith sub-system of hybrid model. It is assumed that all states are equally probable when engine is healthy and that the fault would bias one of the states. The proposed novel fault detection algorithm identifies the biasing of a state by the calculation of Limiting State Probability of Markov Chains to indicate the fault. The data for both healthy and faulty engine condition is generated using hybrid model and analyzed using proposed fault detection method. The algorithm is finally verified experimentally by acquiring data from SI engine both under no fault condition and faulty condition and analyzing it for the existence of fault. The correctness of fault predicted by algorithm is mathematically analyzed using analysis similar to ROC analysis. In error analysis the fault is predicted using proposed algorithm and compared with the data observed experimentally to study the false positive events. The plot of analysis demonstrates the affectivity of algorithm...|$|E

Fire frequency and seasonality can be determined from physical fire records, such as fire scars, but fire size, fire <b>cycle,</b> <b>ignition</b> density, and ignition source are more difficult to ascertain. Using FARSITE, a spatially explicit fire model, I predicted past fire spread in the western Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GSMNP). Results showed a mean pre-suppression fire size of over an order of magnitude larger than fires on current landscape conditions (567 ha vs. 45 ha). Large fire sizes would have encouraged fire-associated vegetation and continuous flammable fuelbeds. In addition, the current lightning ignition rate within the study area resulted in a 120 - 135 year pre-suppression lightning fire cycle, which indicates that natural fires were influential on the landscape. This fire cycle is shorter than the lightning fire cycle experienced today (approx. 25 - 30, 000 years). Using the mean fire return interval from previous research, I determined the potential contribution of lightning and anthropogenic ignitions to the fire cycle. This contributes to the debate on the importance of lightning versus anthropogenic ignitions to the pre-suppression fire regime. Most importantly, the estimation of mean fire size, fire <b>cycle,</b> and <b>ignition</b> density for lightning and anthropogenically ignited fires may aid federal resource managers as they use lightning ignitions and prescribed burns to restore fire-associated ecosystems in the GSMNP and other areas of the southern Appalachians...|$|R

The variations of power output, thermal efficiency, specific fuel consumption, ignition delay, temperature of exhaust gases, heat loss and the exhaust emissions (CO 2, CO, NO, O 2) by volume, were calculated for each type of engine and then comparing the results to investigate how to increase engine efficiency and reduce exhaust emissions. The accuracy of the present model is confirmed by comparison with experimental result that have established by previous literatures and the results were agreement with literatures. The main results obtained from the present study shows that, the square engines (S/D= 1) can be considered as most efficient, modern and suitable design for engines running by gasoline and alternative fuels like LPG and CNG, because of higher power output due to the suitable piston area for pressure distribution. The area of flame front which may create higher combustion qualities and higher thermal efficiency through faster burning and lower overall chamber heat loss, also, the potential of the square engines (S/D= 1) for indicate specific fuel consumption was 4 % improved...|$|R
40|$|The current {{technology}} within {{combustion engines}} {{have the possibility}} of handling the more stringent legislative demands on combustion engines. However the required solutions are getting more expensive and technically challenging. One possible way towards a more simple exhaust aftertreatment system {{is the use of}} the Homogeneous Charge Compression <b>Ignition</b> (HCCI) engine <b>cycle.</b> The main advantage of the HCCI engine is its low output of NOx exhaust emissions. Because of its indirect combustion initiation the main disadvantage is that it requires closed loop control of its combustion process. Two methods for engine timing control were used, dual fuels or variable valve actuation(VVA). With dual fuels the timing change was achieved by changing the autoignition properties of the homogeneous charge and with VVA, timing control was achieved by changing the effective compression ratio. This thesis focuses on the control of the HCCI engine. For the purpose of studying control of the HCCI engine, special engine control software was developed. This software aimed towards engine cycle-to-cycle control and actuation. Another aid in the development was the use of Matlab/Simulink for the design of powerful control algorithms. Successful system identification control design has been shown. Different control strategies were tested, amongst the most successful was the use of Model Predictive Control (MPC), which is a control strategy that can take care of the nonlinear behavior of the dynamic engine system and its actuators. It was concluded that low order models were sufficient for capturing the important HCCI engine dynamics. The use of ion current for detection and control of the HCCI combustion was also shown. A method for obtaining combustion timing from the ion current was defined and investigated. Closed-loop control using ion currents on an HCCI engine was demonstrated...|$|R
