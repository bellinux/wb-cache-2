25|$|In October 1987 the Guildford branch {{circulated}} {{an internal}} <b>discussion</b> <b>document</b> {{arguing that the}} growing socialist movement would have a profound economic impact on the operation of capitalism before {{the overthrow of the}} capitalist class and the formal establishment of socialism. They claimed that socialists would use their influence politically (through the legislature and local councils) to adjust patterns of state income and expenditure in ‘socialistic’ directions, including the provision of free services. Drawing inspiration from writers like André Gorz, they also claimed that socialists would be encouraging the growth of the non-monetary, voluntary sector of the economy and should be instrumental in developing support networks for co-operatives and LETS schemes. This critique of the Party's revolutionary strategy was vigorously rebutted in other circulars from branches and members and at Party conference. A small number of proponents of the Guildford perspective resigned. They went on to publish the journal Spanner, so-called because it aimed to ‘span’ opinion across the non-market socialist sector of political thought, and in recent years some have been instrumental in founding the small World In Common group.|$|E

2500|$|Most {{scholars}} {{hold that}} Paul had two passages of the Book of Leviticus, [...] and , {{in mind when}} he used the word ἀρσενοκοῖται, which may be of his coinage. with most commentators and translators interpreting it as a reference to male same-sex intercourse. However, John Boswell states that it [...] "did not connote homosexuality to Paul or his early readers", and that in later Christian literature the word is used, for instance, by Aristides of Athens (c. 138) clearly not for homosexuality and possibly for prostitution, [...] Eusebius (d. c. 340) who evidently used it in reference to women, and in the writings of 6th-century [...] Patriarch John IV of Constantinople, known as John the Faster. In a passage dealing with sexual misconduct, John speaks of arsenokoitia as active or passive and says that [...] "many men even commit the sin of arsenokoitia with their wives". Although the constituent elements of the compound word refer to sleeping with men, he obviously does not use it to mean homosexual intercourse and appears to employ it for anal intercourse, not generic homosexual activity. Particulars of Boswell's arguments are rejected by several scholars in a way qualified as persuasive by David F. Greenberg, who declares usage of the term arsenokoites by writers such as Aristides of Athens and Eusebius, and in the Sibylline Oracles, to be [...] "consistent with a homosexual meaning". A <b>discussion</b> <b>document</b> issued by the House of Bishops of the Church of England states that most scholars still hold that the word arsenokoites relates to homosexuality. Another work attributed to John the Faster, a series of canons that for various sins provided shorter though stricter penances in place of the previous longer penances, applies a penance of eighty days for [...] "intercourse of men with one another" [...] (canon 9), explained in the Pedalion as mutual masturbation – double the penalty for solitary masturbation (canon 8) – and three years with xerophagy or, in accordance with the older canon of Basil the Great, fifteen without (canon 18) for being [...] "so mad as to copulate with another man" [...] – ἀρρενομανήσαντα in the original – explained in the Pedalion as [...] "guilty of arsenocoetia (i.e., sexual intercourse between males)" [...] – ἀρσενοκοίτην in the original. According to the same work, ordination is not to be conferred on someone who as a boy has been the victim of anal intercourse, {{but this is not the}} case if the semen was ejaculated between his thighs (canon 19). These canons are included, with commentary, in the Pedalion, the most widely used collection of canons of the Greek Orthodox Church, an English translation of which was produced by Denver Cummings and published by the Orthodox Christian Educational Society in 1957 under the title, The Rudder.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a guide for}} healthcare professionals and policymakers contributing to and assessing <b>discussion</b> <b>documents</b> and reports relevant to health policy. Our purposes are to: (1) help develop a more systematic approach to making written submissions and participating in deliberations; (2) provide criteria for constructively critiquing published <b>discussion</b> <b>documents</b> and reports and reaching an informed opinion on them; and more generally, (3) suggest an approach for participating in the policy development and review process. With this in mind, we propose a set of fundamental questions to pose in critically assessing a document or set of recommendations and framing submissions to deliberative or consultative bodies seeking responses to prominent reports. To illustrate, we have applied these questions {{to one of the}} structural options around Commonwealth responsibility for healthcare funding, policy and regulation, as discussed in the Final Report of the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission, A Healthier Future for All Australians...|$|R

40|$|Seven <b>discussion</b> <b>documents</b> {{were made}} during the SUSVAR Visions {{workshop}} ‘Sustainable cereal production beyond 2020 : Visions from the SUSVAR 1 network’, Karrebæksminde, Denmark, 14 - 16 April 2008. At the workshop, one <b>discussion</b> <b>documents</b> was written {{for each of the}} topics mentioned below. In total 55 persons from 21 European countries participated in the process. The participants came from different disciplines: genetics, plant breeding, genetic resources, agronomy, plant pathology, soil science, biometry and system analysis, all specialised in the area of cereal production. The approach taken at the workshop was to focus on envisioning the future of sustainable agriculture, especially cereal production. This was done by scientific creative thinking on the basis of possibilities in breeding, management and seed production and {{not on the basis of}} traditional problem solving. We followed a strategy commonly used in industrial management based on the premise “imagining the future is shaping the future”. The method “appreciative inquiry” was applied supported by a professional facilitator. Experience shows that this way of working sparks engagement and creativity and that progress and results can be reached within a short time. Focus was on the following topics of relevance to cereal production: - Competition between food and bioenergy, - Soil fertility management, - Economical and legal conditions for variety improvement, - Participation of stakeholders, - Plant breeding strategies, - Food and feed processing improvements, - Sustainable land use. The initial process was to visualise the most desirable future scenario for the seven essential topics in food and agriculture systems. This process was unhindered by no requirement for a market-driven goal. Each topic was discussed in relation to a broader socio-ecological system with a focus on the means to reach the desired and more sustainable outcomes. The next step at the workshop was to produce the <b>discussion</b> <b>documents.</b> The final stage of the process is to connect the topics in a completed vision of cereal production within a future sustainable socio-ecological system. This is in progress by a group of key persons within the network, e. g. the working group leaders (in preparation for publication in a scientific journal) ...|$|R

These documents are presented here as starting ‘stories’ among educators and others interested in current changes in Queensland education. However, these documents tell their stories without endings.
