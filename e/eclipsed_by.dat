During this time AXAF {{will be subject to}} <b>eclipses</b> <b>by</b> the Earth and the Moon. <b>Eclipses</b> <b>by</b> the Earth will occur during regular 'seasons' six months apart.

The AXAF perigee altitude can be chosen, once the other initial conditions are known, so that objectionable Moon-eclipses can be avoided by targeting the final burn...|$|R

5|$|Charles XI has {{sometimes}} been described in Sweden as {{the greatest of all}} the Swedish kings, except for Gustavus II Adolphus, unduly <b>eclipsed</b> <b>by</b> his father and his son.

In the most recent book, Rystads biography from 2003, the king is again characterized as a strong-willed shaper of Sweden through economic reforms and achievement of financial and military stability and strength.|$|E

Quatermass 2 was, however, the first film for which Hammer pre-sold the distribution rights in the United States, a financial model that would quickly become the norm for subsequent Hammer productions.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} 1300, the port {{exported}} wheat, peas and beans to Ireland, France and Spain, and by 1400 was also exporting cloth from Somerset and the adjoining counties. By 1500 {{it was the}} largest port in Somerset, later becoming the fifth largest in England, until <b>eclipsed</b> <b>by</b> Bristol in the 18th century. In its heyday, imports included wine, grain, fish, hemp, coal and timber. Exports included wheat, wool, cloth, cement, bricks and tiles. Unlike Bristol, Bridgwater was never involved in the slave trade and, in 1797, was the first town in Britain to petition the government to ban it.|$|E
5|$|From about 218 BC onwards, the archers of the Roman {{army of the}} mid-Republic were {{virtually}} all mercenaries from the island of Crete, which boasted a long specialist tradition. During the late Republic (88-30 BC) and the Augustan period, Crete was gradually <b>eclipsed</b> <b>by</b> men from other, much more populous, regions subjugated by the Romans with strong archery traditions. These included Thrace, Anatolia and above all, Syria. Of the 32 sagittarii units attested in the mid-2nd century, 13 have Syrian names, 7 Thracian, 5 from Anatolia, 1 from Crete and the remaining 6 of other or uncertain origin.|$|E

5|$|It was in {{this context}} that Abu Taghlib is first {{mentioned}} in 964, when his father had once again been embroiled in a conflict with the Buyids. The army of the Buyid Mu'izz al-Dawla occupied Mosul and Nasir al-Dawla was once again forced to flee to the hill country of the northern Jazira. Abu Taghlib led the resistance against the Buyids, who, unable to maintain themselves there, evacuated Mosul and reached a new agreement with the Hamdanids. Consequently, Nasir al-Dawla was now increasingly <b>eclipsed</b> <b>by</b> his sons, and was deposed outright and exiled in 967, dying in captivity shortly after.|$|E

50|$|<b>Eclipses</b> <b>by</b> Styx and Kerberos {{are more}} {{difficult}} to estimate, as both moons are very irregular, with angular dimensions of 76.9 x 38.5 to 77.8 x 38.9 arcseconds for Styx, and 67.6 x 32.0 to 68.0 x 32.2 for Kerberos. As such, Styx has no annular eclipses, its widest axis being more than 10 arcseconds larger than the Sun at its largest. However, Kerberos, although slightly larger, cannot make total eclipses as its largest minor axis is a mere 32 arcseconds. <b>Eclipses</b> <b>by</b> Kerberos and Styx will entirely consist of partial and hybrid eclipses, with total eclipses being extremely rare.|$|R
