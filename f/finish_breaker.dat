40|$|Abstract:- This article {{presents}} a new learning methodology {{based on a}} hybrid algorithm for interval type- 2 TSK fuzzy logic systems (FLS). Using input-output data pairs during the forward pass of the training process, the interval type- 2 TSK FLS output is calculated and the consequent parameters are estimated by recursive least-squares (RLS) method. In the backward pass, the error propagates backward, and the antecedent parameters are estimated by back-propagation (BP) method. The proposed hybrid methodology was used to construct an interval type- 2 TSK fuzzy model capable of approximating the behaviour of the steel strip temperature as it is being rolled in an industrial Hot Strip Mill (HSM) and used to predict the transfer bar surface temperature at the <b>finishing</b> Scale <b>Breaker</b> (SB) entry zone. Comparative results show {{the advantage of the}} hybrid learning method RLS-BP over BP.

50|$|Off-season wrist surgery forced Robbins to {{miss the}} first three weeks of the Wildcats' 2012-13 season, but upon {{returning}} to action, he managed just eight games before his long-running battle with various injuries began impeding on his ability to perform. Consequently, on 11 December 2012, he announced his retirement from the NBL effective immediately, citing his ailing body and a fatigued mind were the main reasons in his decision to walk away from basketball. He continued on with the team in an advisory role, but following an Achilles injury to Damian Martin in Game 2 of the Wildcats' semi-final series against the Wollongong Hawks, Robbins came out of retirement in April to fill in the back-up point guard role for the 2013 Grand Final series against the New Zealand Breakers. He played in both games of the Wildcats' 2-0 series loss to the <b>Breakers,</b> <b>finishing</b> his NBL career with 215 games and averages of 4.5 points, 2.1 rebounds and 1.7 assists per game.|$|R
50|$|After {{starting}} the season 1-3, the Breakers won nine of their next 11 games to breeze {{back into the}} championship mix with a 10-5 record after Round 10. However, following Round 16, the Breakers had fallen to 11-12 {{and out of the}} playoff race. To make matters worse, Jackson played most of January with a toe and Achilles heel injuries. He responded to his poor form of late in the team's first game of February, recording a season-high 31 points, 10 rebounds and 6 assists in a 106-84 win over the Adelaide 36ers, keeping the Breakers' playoff chances alive. With seven three-pointers, 10 rebounds and 6 assists, he became the first NBL player to record such stats since John Rille did so in 1998. The <b>Breakers</b> <b>finished</b> the regular season in fourth place with a 16-12 win/loss record and defeated first-seeded Melbourne United 2-0 in the semi-finals to return to the Grand Final. There they faced the Perth Wildcats where they were defeated 2-1, earning runners-up honors {{for the first time in}} club history. Jackson played well throughout the playoffs, but stumbled in Game 3 of the grand final series where he went scoreless and fouled out early in the fourth quarter. He appeared in all 33 games for the Breakers in 2015-16, averaging 12.9 points, 6.0 rebounds, 6.4 assists and 1.3 steals per game.|$|R

40|$|The {{circuit breaker}} helps {{protecting}} vulnerable equipment {{in a power}} network from hazardous short-circuit currents by isolating a fault, when it occurs. They perform this task by extinguishing a plasma arc that appears {{as soon as the}} breaker's contacts separate, and through which the short-circuit current flows. In an AC network, the current's value runs periodically through zero, and each current zero provides the breaker with an opportunity to quench the arc, because here, its energy input is temporarily zero. Due to the inductive nature of most short-circuit networks, the voltage tends to rise immediately to its maximum value after the current interruption. This complicates the current interruption process for breakers, because just after they have been loaded with the arc, they have to cope with this recovery voltage as well. To ensure their reliability, new circuit breakers are subjected to tests with artificially generated short-circuit currents and recovery voltages, with values that are appropriate for the network in which they are intended to use. These tests follow strict rules, recorded in standards such as the IEC 62271 - 100, about {{the size and shape of}} the current and voltage waveforms. Specialised institutes, such as the High Power Laboratory at KEMA, perform such tests and hand out certificates to breakers that pass all tests. The certification process usually provides little more information than that the breaker passed a test, or not, and it would be beneficial for both the certification institute, and the breaker's manufacturer, to obtain more information form the tests. Such analysis on SF 6 breakers has already taken place with success in the past, and this work applies it to vacuum circuit breakers. Vacuum circuit breakers (VCBs) are the most widely used type of breakers to protect distribution level networks, with operating voltages of up to 72. 5 kV. This thesis analyses the electrical signals from short-circuit interruptions in vacuum, to detect trends and indicators on the breaker's performance. For this purpose, it describes the test circuits and the measuring techniques, used to obtain the electrical behaviour of the vacuum circuit breaker just after current zero. This includes the efforts to reduce the distortion from the strong electric and magnetic fields that inevitably involve a short-circuit test. After its extinction, the vacuum arc leaves residual plasma behind, which provides a conducting path through which a post-arc current can flow. Since the post-arc current is the most distinctive electrical signal in a vacuum current interruption, the analysis mainly focusses on this phenomenon. The residual plasma decays within microseconds, thereby <b>finishing</b> the <b>breaker's</b> transition from a near perfect conductor to a near perfect insulator. The thesis pays special attention to the measuring equipment that was used to track these fast changes in the signals (sub-microsecond), and its large dynamic ranges (from kilo amperes to tenths of amperes, and from volts to kilo volts). In addition to the post-arc current research, the thesis analyses the VCBs reignition behaviour. Since VCBs are created to prevent reignition, they had to be subjected to much higher currents and voltages than their rated values, to force them to reignite. These results, and the results from the post-arc current research, provide new insight in the current quenching mechanism in vacuum. Finally, this thesis also pays attention to the interaction between the electrical circuit and the VCB after current zero. To this end, it describes how existing models are extended with theories and insights that emerged from this research. The result has been implemented as a function block in Matlab's SimPowerSystems, which facilitates the incorporation of the model in different electrical circuits.
