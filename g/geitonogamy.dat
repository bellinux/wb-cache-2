50|$|Borago officinalis {{grows to}} {{a height of}} 60 - 100 cm, and is bristly or hairy all over the stems and leaves; the leaves are alternate, simple, and 5 - 15 cm long. The flowers are complete, perfect with five narrow, triangular-pointed petals. Flowers are most often blue, {{although}} pink flowers are sometimes observed. White flowered types are also cultivated. The blue flower is genetically dominant over the white flower. The flowers arise along scorpioid cymes to form large floral displays with multiple flowers blooming simultaneously, suggesting that borage has {{a high degree of}} <b>geitonogamy</b> (intra-plant pollination). It has an indeterminate growth habit which may lead to prolific spreading. In temperate climate such as in the UK, its flowering season is relatively long, from June to September. In milder climates, borage will bloom continuously for most of the year.|$|E
50|$|The {{defining}} {{characteristic of}} this family is the inflorescence, the flowers nearly always aggregated in terminal umbels, that may be simple or more commonly compound, often umbelliform cymes. The flowers are usually perfect (hermaphroditic) and actinomorphic {{but there may be}} zygomorphic petals {{at the edges of the}} umbel, as in carrot (Daucus carota). Some are andromonoecious, polygamomonoecious, or even dioecious (as in Acronema), with a distinct calyx and corolla, but the calyx is often highly reduced, to the point of being undetectable in many species, while the corolla can be white, yellow, pink or purple. The flowers are nearly perfectly pentamerous, with five petals, sepals, and stamens.The androecium consists of five stamens, but there is often variation in the functionality of the stamens even within a single inflorescence. Some flowers are functionally staminate (where a pistil may be present but has no ovules capable of being fertilized) while others are functionally pistillate (where stamens are present but their anthers do not produce viable pollen). Pollination of one flower by the pollen of a different flower of the same plant (<b>geitonogamy)</b> is common. The gynoecium consists of two carpels fused into a single, bicarpellate pistil with an inferior ovary. Stylopodia support two styles and secrete nectar, attracting pollinators like flies, mosquitoes, gnats, beetles, moths, and bees. The fruit is a schizocarp consisting of two fused carpels that separate at maturity into two mericarps, each containing a single seed. The fruits of many species are dispersed by wind but others such as those of Daucus spp., are covered in bristles, which may be hooked in sanicle Sanicula europaea and thus catch in the fur of animals. The seeds have an oily endosperm and often contain essential oils, containing aromatic compounds that are responsible for the flavour of commercially important umbelliferous seed such as anise, cumin and coriander. The shape and details of the ornamentation of the ripe fruits are important for identification to species level.|$|E
40|$|Dactylorhiza maculata is {{a common}} {{terrestrial}} orchid in Finland. It is nectarless and the seed production is relatively high for a deceptive species. The pollinators of D. maculata do not have frequent visits to the flowers, but the species is capable of over 50 % seed capsule production. <b>Geitonogamy</b> is the transfer of self pollen between flowers on the same individual. It is typical that the pollinators of deceptive inflorescences visit only few flowers and have short stays in them, and therefore it is commonly thought that <b>geitonogamy</b> is infrequent among deceptive species. I examined the role of <b>geitonogamy</b> in the seed production of D. maculata. I prevented <b>geitonogamy</b> in male-sterilization experiment by removing the pollinaria in the experiment group, and in hand-pollination experiment I conducted cross-fertilization and self-fertilization (in the form of both <b>geitonogamy</b> and autogamy). When the seeds had matured I calculated the relative seed capsule production in male-sterilization experiment, and estimated the proportions of embryonic seeds in both experiments. From this data I analyzed the differences in fertilization success and seed quality. The seed quality in both experiments was verified with in vitro germination of the seeds. I found that <b>geitonogamy</b> is not a significant reproduction strategy for D. maculata, because self-pollination is a disadvantage that reduces the seed set and the seed quality. One mechanism to prevent <b>geitonogamy</b> is pollinaria bending, a time delay before the freshly withdrawn pollinaria are able to conduct fertilization. In D. maculata this delay is approximately 50 s which is rather long for a deceptive species. The explanation for the high natural seed capsule production of D. maculata might be a fact that probably the species is not deceptive in all means. Longhorn beetles (Cerambycidae) were found to act as beetle pollinators in the study population. The beetles were found to bear large pollinaria loads of up to approximately 30 pollinaria...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2007 Pollination ecology {{may play}} an {{important}} role in the maintenance of selfing in populations of self-compatible hermaphroditic plants where both selfing and outcrossing occur (mixed mating). Behavior and abundance of pollinators can influence the two major modes of selfing; autogamy (selfing within a flower) and <b>geitonogamy</b> (selfing between flowers on the same plant). Autogamy may be selected for as a method of reproductive assurance during times of reduced or inefficient pollinator service. In contrast, <b>geitonogamy</b> is a negative and non-adaptive consequence of pollinators visiting multiple flowers per plant. Pollinator behavior and abundance, which can both influence levels of selfing, varies among pollinator types. Evidence suggests that of the two major pollinators of the blue columbine, Aquilegia coerulea, hawkmoths may decrease levels of selfing compared to bumblebees. The goals of this study are to 1) quantify the contribution of autogamy and <b>geitonogamy</b> to the overall selfing rate, 2) determine whether hawkmoths decrease levels of selfing compared to bumblebees and other floral visitors, and 3) examine how pollinator behavior influences levels of selfing in a Colorado population of A. coerulea. First, we estimated levels of selfing from groups of emasculated and control flowers using allozyme data to measure the genetic contribution of <b>geitonogamy</b> and autogamy to the population selfing rate. Second, contribution of autogamy to seed set was quantified as the difference in seed set between control and emasculated flowers. Third, we compared the realized levels of autogamy measured from allozyme data to the potential for autogamy, measured as seed set in absence of pollinators. Fourth, we compared the realized levels of <b>geitonogamy</b> measured from allozyme data to the potential for <b>geitonogamy,</b> calculated from the flowering phenology. Fifth, we conducted pollinator observations to document the number of different pollinators, their behavior, and their variation in abundance over three years of study. Finally, we determined if there was a relationship between yearly abundance of each pollinator type and yearly selfing rate. The allozyme data showed that <b>geitonogamy</b> was the primary contributor to the intermediate levels of selfing found in this population, suggesting that selfing is due to the negative consequence of pollinators visiting multiple flowers per plant and has no adaptive explanation. The realized level of <b>geitonogamy</b> was greater than the potential for <b>geitonogamy,</b> and resulted from pollinator preferences for a floral gender. In contrast, the realized level of autogamy was negligible, which suggested that reproductive assurance was not being selected for in this population. However, seed set from control flowers were significantly greater than that of emasculated flowers, indicating that autogamy contributed to an increase in seed set. The discrepancy between genetic and seed set data could be explained by bumblebee preference for control relative to emasculated flowers. Although the realized level of autogamy was minimal, plants in the population retained a high potential for autogamy, which may be selected for as a mechanism of reproductive assurance during years of low pollinator abundance. Pollinators in this population of A. coerulea included bumblebees, hawkmoths, solitary bees, wasps and flies. The abundance of all pollinators varied significantly among years except for solitary bees and wasps. In addition, we documented a significant variation in selfing rate (0. 23 - 0. 59) over the three years of study. A relationship was noted between years with increased hawkmoth abundance and a decrease in selfing rate. No relationships were observed between yearly selfing rate and abundance of the other pollinator types. The behavior most likely responsible for the decrease in selfing is that, unlike other pollinators, hawkmoths prefer female-phase flowers, which reduces levels of <b>geitonogamy.</b> Thus, the abundance and behavior of distinct pollinator types can differentially influence levels of selfing...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Clonal growth, {{which allows}} the {{multiplication}} of flowering shoots of the same genet, {{can lead to a}} large floral display and may thus increase the rate of selfing through <b>geitonogamy</b> as a consequence of {{an increase in the number}} of successively visited flowers. The aim of the present research was to analyse the combined effect of the diversity and intermingling of clones on the rate of selfing in Vaccinium myrtillus. Four mother plants were selected within patches characterised by contrasting clonal structure (low versus high number and intermingling of clones). The selfing rate was significantly lower for plants situated within patches characterised by a high number of intermingled clones (3 %) than for plants situated in patches with a low number of clones (50 %). Therefore, for this species suffering from inbreeding depression, an increase in the number or the intermingling of the clones could reduce the rate and the cost of <b>geitonogamy</b> and allow a large floral display to attract pollinators. We also found that the main pollinators, bumblebee queens, presented a foraging behaviour favouring <b>geitonogamy,</b> as their successive visits to flowers were quite short (89 % of flights were 40 cm or less) ...|$|E
40|$|Comparisons of {{the causes}} and {{consequences}} of cross- and self-fertilization have dominated research on plant mating since Darwin's seminal work on plant reproduction. Here, I provide examples of these accomplishments, but also illustrate new approaches that emphasize the role of floral design and display in pollen dispersal and fitness gain through male function. Wide variation in outcrossing rate characterizes animal-pollinated plants. In species with large floral displays, part of the selfing component of mixed mating can arise from <b>geitonogamy</b> and be maladaptive because of strong inbreeding depression and pollen discounting. Floral strategies that separate the benefits of floral display from the mating costs associated with <b>geitonogamy</b> can resolve these conflicts by reducing lost mating opportunities through male function. The results from experiments with marker genes and floral manipulations provide evidence for the function of herkogamy and dichogamy in reducing self-pollination and promoting pollen dispersal. Evidence is also presented indicating that increased selfing resulting from changes to floral design, or <b>geitonogamy</b> in large clones, {{can act as a}} stimulus for the evolution of dioecy. The scope of future research on mating strategies needs to be broadened to include investigations of functional links among flowers, inflorescences and plant architecture within the framework of life-history evolution...|$|E
40|$|Protandry {{and male}} {{sterility}} promote outcrossing, while self-compatibility and <b>geitonogamy</b> contribute to inbreeding. The {{combination of these}} floral mechanisms results in a mixed mating system in all species studied. Outcrossing rates of 15 populations of the 11 species ranged from 0. 43 - 0. 88, averaging 0. 65.

Presence of females increased the level of outcrossing by an average of 9 % in gynodioecious populations. Efficiency of gynodioecy as an outcrossing mechanism largely depends on the current outcrossing rate of hermaphrodites, frequency of females, and extent of genetic substructuring in populations.

40|$|Mating {{with more}} than one pollen donor, or polyandry, is common in land plants. In {{flowering}} plants, polyandry occurs when the pollen from different potential sires is distributed among the fruits of a single individual, or when pollen from more than one donor is deposited on the same stigma. Because polyandry typically leads to multiple paternity among or within fruits, it can be indirectly inferred on the basis of paternity analysis using molecular markers. A review of the literature indicates that polyandry is probably ubiquitous in plants except those that habitually self-fertilize, or that disperse their pollen in pollen packages, such as polyads or pollinia. Multiple mating may increase plants' female component by alleviating pollen limitation or by promoting competition among pollen grains from different potential sires. Accordingly, a number of traits have evolved that should promote polyandry at the flower level from the female's point of view, e. g. the prolongation of stigma receptivity or increases in stigma size. However, many floral traits, such as attractiveness, the physical manipulation of pollinators and pollen-dispensing mechanisms that lead to polyandrous pollination, have probably evolved in response to selection to promote male siring success in general, so that polyandry might often best be seen as a by-product of selection to enhance outcross siring success. In this sense, polyandry in plants is similar to <b>geitonogamy</b> (selfing caused by pollen transfer among flowers of the same plant), because both polyandry and <b>geitonogamy</b> probably result from selection to promote outcross siring success, although <b>geitonogamy</b> is almost always deleterious while polyandry in plants will seldom be so...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the absence of floral rewards in many orchid species causes pollinators to probe fewer flowers on a plant, and thus reduces <b>geitonogamy,</b> i. e. self-pollination between flowers, which may result in inbreeding depression and reduced pollen export. We examined the effects of nectar addition on pollinator visitation and pollen transfer by tracking the fate of colour-labelled pollen in Anacamptis morio, a non-rewarding orchid species pollinated primarily by queen bumble-bees. Addition of nectar to spurs of A. morio significantly increased the number of flowers probed by bumble-bees, the time spent on an inflorescence, pollinarium removal and the proportion of removed pollen involved in self-pollination through <b>geitonogamy,</b> but did not affect pollen carryover (the fraction of a pollinarium carried over from one flower to the next). Only visits that exceeded 18 s resulted in <b>geitonogamy,</b> as this is the time taken for removed pollinaria to bend into a position to strike the stigma. A mutation for nectar production in A. morio would result in an initial 3. 8 -fold increase in pollinarium removal per visit, but also increase geitonogamous self-pollination from less than 10 % of pollen depositions to ca. 40 %. Greater efficiency of pollen export will favour deceptive plants when pollinators are relatively common and most pollinaria are removed from flowers or when inbreeding depression is severe. These findings provide empirical support both for Darwin's contention that pollinarium bending is an anti-selfing mechanism in orchids and for the idea that floral deception serves to maximize the efficiency of pollen export...|$|E
40|$|Although canola, (Brassica napus L.), is {{considered}} a self-pollinating crop, researchers have indicated that crop productivity increases {{as a result of}} honey bee Apis mellifera L. pollination. Given this crop's growing importance in Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil, this work evaluated the increase in pod and seed productivity with respect to interactions with anthophilous insects and manual pollination tests. The visiting frequency of A. mellifera was correlated with the crop's blooming progression, and productivity comparisons were made between plants visited by insects, manually pollinated plants (<b>geitonogamy</b> and xenogamy) and plants without pollination induction.

40|$|Natural {{selection}} {{mediated by}} pollinators has influenced {{the evolution of}} floral diversity of the flowering plants (angiosperms). The scope of this thesis was to study: 1) phenotypic selection, 2) mating systems, and 3) floral shifts involved in plant speciation. Model plant species were Platanthera bifolia and P. chlorantha (Orchidaceae). These orchids are moth-pollinated, strictly co-sexual (bisexual flowers), and produce a spike that displays 10 - 20 white flowers. I explored the influence of characters on plant fitness by using multiple linear regressions. Pollen removal (male fitness) and fruit set (female fitness) increased with more flowers per plant in three P. bifolia populations. There was selection towards longer spurs in a dry year when average spur length was shorter than in normal-wet years. Female function was sensitive to drought, which enabled an application of the male function hypothesis of floral evolution (Bateman's principle). The results show that selection may vary between populations, years, and sex-functions. I examined inbreeding by estimating levels of <b>geitonogamy</b> (self-pollination between flowers of an individual) with an emasculation method in two P. bifolia populations. <b>Geitonogamy</b> did not vary with inflorescence size. Levels of <b>geitonogamy</b> was 20 - 40 % in the smaller, but non-significant in the larger population. This may relate to lower number of possible mates and pollinator activity in the smaller population. Platanthera bifolia exhibits the ancestral character state of tongue-attachment of pollinia on the pollinator. Its close relative P. chlorantha attaches its pollinia onto the pollinator's eyes. To explore the mechanism of a floral shift, pollination efficiency and speed was compared between the two species. The results showed no differences in pollination efficiency, but P. chlorantha had faster pollen export and import. Efficiency of pollination in terms of speed may cause floral shifts, and thus speciation...|$|E

In a controlled environment, naive bees were given experience in a particular habitat (all plants having equal nectar quality or number of rewarding flowers), and we tested whether they learn about and adaptively exploit a new habitat type. Bees' residence on a plant (number of flowers probed per visit) was eventually invariant to a doubling of absolute nectar quality and increased only slightly with a doubling of absolute flower number in the habitat.

Both species possess facultatively xenogamous breeding systems, with 33 %- 36 % fruit formation in artificially crossed experiments and 17 %- 19 % fruit formation following <b>geitonogamy.</b> Reduced fruit set following <b>geitonogamy</b> suggests partial self-incompatibility; this is supported by index of self-incompatibility values of ca. 0. 5 in both species. Analysis of population genetic structure supports the hypothesis of a mixed but largely xenogamous mating system. Genetic diversity within populations {{was estimated to be}} ca. 80 % and 66 % of total genetic diversity for P. coffeoides and P. korinti, respectively. The levels of gene flow between populations were moderate (Nm = 2. 033 for P. coffeoides and 0. 970 for P. korinti), and genetic identity (I) values between populations within species were high. This possibly reflects the fragmentation of a previously more extensive population, correlated with the historical deforestation associated with crop cultivation and irrigation in Sri Lanka. © 2006 by The University of Chicago.

40|$|Background and AimsLarge floral {{displays}} have opposing {{consequences for}} animal-pollinated angiosperms: they attract more pollinators but also enable elevated among-flower self-pollination (<b>geitonogamy).</b> The presence of sterile flowers as pollinator signals may enhance attraction while allowing displays of fewer open fertile flowers, limiting <b>geitonogamy.</b> The simultaneous contributions of fertile and non-fertile display components to pollinator attraction and reproductive output remain undetermined. MethodsThe simultaneous {{effects of the}} presence of sterile flowers and fertile-flower display size in two populations of Leopoldia comosa were experimentally assessed. Pollinator behaviour, pollen removal and deposition, and fruit and seed production were compared between intact plants and plants with sterile flowers removed. Key ResultsThe presence of sterile flowers almost tripled pollinator attraction, supplementing the positive effect of the number of fertile flowers on the number of bees approaching inflorescences. Although attracted bees visited more flowers on larger inflorescences, the number visited did not additionally depend on the presence of sterile flowers. The presence of sterile flowers improved all aspects of plant performance, the magnitude of plant benefit being context dependent. During weather favourable to pollinators, the presence of sterile flowers increased pollen deposition on stigmas of young flowers, but this difference was not evident in older flowers, probably because of autonomous self-pollination in poorly visited flowers. Total pollen receipt per stigma decreased with increasing fertile display size. In the population with more pollinators, the presence of sterile flowers increased fruit number but not seed set or mass, whereas in the other population sterile flowers enhanced seeds per fruit, but not fruit production. These contrasts are consistent with dissimilar cross-pollination and autonomous self-pollination, coupled with the strong predispersal inbreeding depression exhibited by L. comosa populations. ConclusionsSterile flowers enrich pollination quality by promoting pollen export and import, while limiting the mating costs of <b>geitonogamy</b> associated with large fertile displays.

40|$|Abstract. Patterns of isozyme {{variation}} were ex-amined in 17 {{populations of}} P. pusillus and P. berchtoldii, together with one population of P. trichoides taken for comparison. Both P. pusillus and P. berchtoldii displayed {{low levels of}} variation within populations associated {{with high levels of}} interpopulation differentiation. This pattern of partitioning of genetic variation within and be-tween populations is attributed to the founder effect, frequent vegetative propagation by turions, dominant self-fertilization and limited seedling recruitment. The mechanism of pollen transfer was investigated in cultivation. Effective pollina-tion takes place in air above the water surface (autogamy, <b>geitonogamy,</b> anemogamy), on th...|$|E
40|$|Reproductive and phenological {{patterns}} of Bulnesia retama were analysed in the Ñacuñán Biosphere Reserve. Flowering spanned approximately 4 weeks, while mature fruits dispersed in 75 days. Six flower stages were determined, protogyny occurred in early stages, receptive stigmas and nectar production were detected during stages 1 – 4. Pollinator and flower predator behaviors are described. Mating treatments namely autogamy, <b>geitonogamy,</b> cross-pollina-tion, {{and an open}} pollinated control showed statistical differences in seed and fruit production. Seed viability was high in all four treatments. Although B. retama has been considered self-compatible, few seeds were produced by selfing compared with cross-pollination, suggesting inbreeding depression...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDetailed {{studies of}} the {{behavior}} of pollinators allow insights into pollination mechanisms and may indicate which pollinators are more efficient for a particular plant species. Our aim was to evaluate if Melipona fasciculata is an efficient pollinator of eggplant (Solanum melongena L., Solanaceae) in greenhouses. We analyzed (1) the colony foraging pattern of M. fasciculata in greenhouses, (2) the behavior of bees during the visits to flowers, and (3) fruit set and fruit quality after different pollination treatments (hand pollination: autogamy, <b>geitonogamy,</b> xenogamy; bee pollination). Our results show that M. fasciculata is an efficient pollinator of eggplants and, consequently, may be a viable alternative to bumblebees in Brazil...|$|E
40|$|Adhatoda vasica Nees. (Acanthaceae) is an {{important}} and widely used medicinal plant. The flowers last for 3 – 5 days, they are protandrous and pass through three distinct phases: male, bisexual and female. Two species of carpenter bees, Xylocopa verticalis and Xylocopa sp. are the effective pollinators. Pollen grains are deposited on the dorsal surface of the thorax during Xylocopa visit to the flowers in the male phase, and the stigma rubs the pollen-coated thorax and is pollinated when the bees visit the flowers in bisexual and female phases.

40|$|Plant mating {{systems have}} {{received}} considerable attention because {{the proportion of}} selfed vs. outcrossed progeny is an important evolutionary factor. In clonally reproducing plants, geitonogamous selfing between distant ramets belonging to the same genet {{is expected to be}} widespread, yet empirical data are sparse. Nothing is known about between-ramet selfing in aquatic flowering plants with subaqueous pollen transfer, most of which display pronounced clonal reproduction. From two locations in the western Baltic Sea, I present data on the effects of patch isolation and clonal diversity on the outcrossing rate of eelgrass, Zostera marina L., based on the genotypes of maternal plants and recently fertilized ovules scored at eight microsatellite loci. There were no differences in outcrossing rates between vegetation patches and continuous meadow although patches were nearly always composed of single genets. Quantitative effects of clonal diversity were present in the continuous vegetation where a significant positive correlation between genet diversity and the proportion of outcrossed offspring was detected (Kendall's tau = 0. 82, P = 0. 0017). On a population-scale as well, the genotypic diversity was positively correlated with outcrossing. The relative fitness of selfed offspring was low (omega +/- 95 % confidence interval = 0. 56 +/- 0. 032 and 0. 322 +/- 0. 15) indicating that <b>geitonogamy</b> incurred substantial fitness costs. Selfing rates in Z. marina may not be in evolutionary equilibrium because of spatial and temporal heterogeneity of clonal size and diversity. The high prevalence of dioecy in seagrasses may have evolved to avoid the fitness costs associated with <b>geitonogamy...</b>|$|E
