5000|$|Sirius is {{aided by}} Sol, who informs him {{of all he}} knows about the Zoi, and helps him {{get out of the}} house when he is unable to open the gate on his own. He sets out to explore the town, finding people to feed him, {{including}} Miss Smith, who recognizes him as who he is, other dogs (some of which are his siblings), the cold dogs, and fleas, which spreads to the cats. One day while pining for Patchie's attention (while she's in heat), he meets Yeff, the cold dog (and, although he doesn't realize it, his father), who has strange, feathery legs, yellow eyes, and is the only one besides Patchie and Sirius to hear the calls of the Master. He runs off after telling Sirius that [...] "only those who runs with cold dogs and share their duties are allowed to know" [...] about the Master. His visits and slipping out are discovered when one day, when late returning to the house, he finds Kathleen's bullies and chases them off, and the policeman who visits them informs the <b>Duffields</b> of Sirius being out a few months ago. Finally Duffy is distracted and Sirius innocently stumbles upon Mrs. Partridge and Bess (his mother), who remembers when something fell from the sky, but flees when his former Companion tries to kill him. Helped by Earth when Sol distracts his Companion, who Sol had previously prevented him from meeting, he escapes. She and the chief witness, a luminary from Castor, who now inhabits his sphere, try to kill Sirius, who leads them out of the house before they ignorantly harm anyone else. He meets and is helped the beautiful, kind Moon, who informs him that the cold dogs run when she is full.|$|E
