2500|$|Search and Rescue Optimal Planning System (SAROPS) is a {{comprehensive}} search and rescue (SAR) planning system used by the United States Coast Guard in the planning and execution of almost all SAR cases {{in and around the}} United States and the Caribbean. SAROPS has three main components: The Graphical User Interface (GUI), the Environmental <b>Data</b> <b>Server</b> (EDS) and the Simulator (SIM). [...] Using the Commercial Joint Mapping Tool Kit’s (C/JMTK) government licensing of the Geographic Information System (GIS) SAROPS can be used in both a coastal and oceanic environment. Built into the simulator is the ability to access global and regional wind and current data sets making SAROPS the most comprehensive and powerful tool available for maritime SAR planners.|$|E

2500|$|The Environmental <b>Data</b> <b>Server</b> (EDS) {{collects}} {{and stores}} environmental {{information for use}} within SAROPS. [...] Local SAROPS servers around the United States request environmental information from the EDS based upon the area of interest. Different environmental products are cataloged on the server ranging from observational systems to modeling products. [...] Observations include sea surface temperature, air temperature, visibility, wave height, global/region tides and currents to name a few. [...] High-resolution model output from operational forecast models like the hybrid coordinate ocean model (HYCOM) and Global NRL Coastal Ocean (NCOM) provide temporally and spatially varying wind and current information. [...] Lastly, the EDS is capable of providing objective analysis tools and aggregation. [...] The list of available products is always changing as researchers in the Navy, local universities and research centers continually improve the accuracy and reliability of products and make them available on a consistent basis.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A {{cluster of}} <b>data</b> <b>servers</b> and a {{parallel}} file system {{are often used}} to provide high-throughput I/O service to parallel programs running on a compute cluster. To exploit I/O parallelism parallel file systems stripe file data across the <b>data</b> <b>servers.</b> While this practice is effective in serving asynchronous requests, it may break individual program’s spatial locality, which can seriously degrade I/O performance when the <b>data</b> <b>servers</b> concurrently serve synchronous requests from multiple I/O-intensive programs. In this {{paper we propose a}} scheme, IOrchestrator, to improve I/O performance of multi-node storage systems by orchestrating I/O services among programs when such inter-data-server coordination is dynamically determined to be cost effective. We have implemented IOrchestrator in the PVFS 2 parallel file system. Our experiments with representative parallel benchmarks show that IOrchestrator can significantly improve I/O performance— by up to a factor of 2. 5 —delivered by a cluster of <b>data</b> <b>servers</b> servicing concurrently-running parallel programs. Notably, we have not observed any scenarios in which the use of IOrchestrator causes substantial performance degradation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Power {{consumption}} is an increasingly impressing concern for <b>data</b> <b>servers</b> as it directly affects running costs and system reliability. Prior {{studies have shown}} most memory space on <b>data</b> <b>servers</b> are used for buffer caching and thus cache replacement becomes critical. Temporally concentrating memory accesses to a smaller set of memory chips increases the chances of free riding through DMA overlapping and also enlarges the opportunities for other ranks to power down. This paper proposes a power and thermal-aware buffer cache replacement algorithm. It conjectures that the memory rank that holds the most amount of cold blocks are very likely to be accessed in the near future. Choosing the victim block from this rank can help {{reduce the number of}} memory ranks that are active simultaneously. We use three real-world I/O server traces, including TPC-C, LM-TBF and MSN-BEFS to evaluate our algorithm. Experimental results show that our algorithm can save up to 27 % energy than LRU and reduce the temperature of memory up to 5. 45 o C with little or no performance degradation.
