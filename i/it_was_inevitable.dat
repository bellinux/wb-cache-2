5|$|Circumstances changed {{suddenly}} when Henry died on 6 June 1217 {{after receiving}} a head wound from a tile which came loose while he was playing with other children at the palace of the Bishop of Palencia. His guardian, Count Álvaro Núñez de Lara, tried to hide the fact, taking the king's body to the castle of Tariego, although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>inevitable</b> that the news would reach Berengaria.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>inevitable...</b> On {{one hand}} our stubbornness has paid off, {{but on the}} other hand refusing to buy into the way things are {{traditionally}} supposed to be done has made things worse for us... The realistic part is it hasn't proved to be a huge money-making venture for a lot of guys in the band.|$|E
5|$|Barlow {{immediately}} {{turned to}} investigate the strange sail, steering southwards directly at the lumbering vessel. Saulnier was seemingly unwilling to attempt any manoeuvere {{in the face of}} the enemy, as Africaine continued to hold the original course without deviation. By 19:30 <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>inevitable</b> that Phoebe would intercept Africaine and Saulnier shortened sail, slowing his frigate to meet the threat. Barlow was still unsure of the identity of the stranger and fired a shot over Africaine as a warning to its captain to identify his ship. Saulnier responded by turning to port and firing a broadside directly at Phoebe. It was poorly aimed however and mostly scattered into the sea without effect. At this, Barlow pulled Phoebe into a parallel position to Africaine and unleashed a much more devastating broadside from close range. The two frigates then began an exchange of fire at close range.|$|E

5|$|In April, Sakanaction {{had already}} started making songs for Shin-shiro, despite having just {{finished}} their tour in March for the band's second album Night Fishing, which had been released in January of the same year. The album's production took {{a different approach to}} how Go to the Future and Night Fishing were produced. In their previous albums Yamaguchi produced the song demos, then took them to the studio and explained his vision for each song; creating them in sessions with all of the band members. For Shin-shiro, Yamaguchi created the songs, and then assigned each member of the band to create a demo based on their two-person vision. This was a conscious move by Yamaguchi to create a new sound for the album, figuring that if all of members were concurrently working on the songs, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>inevitable</b> that one person would take charge of each song.|$|E
25|$|Soft Machine {{having been}} a much loved band since their {{inception}} in the late 1960s and having always been {{at the cutting edge}} of many music genres (including the early progressive and psychedelic rock scene and then the burgeoning jazz rock and fusion scene), <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>inevitable</b> that former Soft Machine members would reconvene over the years, to continue on their legacy.|$|E
25|$|Headquartered in Calgary, Amoco Canada’s liquids {{marketing}} {{group had}} a great deal of independence in the early years. However, many synergies were possible through cooperation between Chicago and Calgary. As importantly, Amoco and Dome Petroleum formed a number of strategic partnerships in the liquids business during the 1960s. So extensive were those partnerships that, when Dome went on the block in 1986, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>inevitable</b> that Amoco would be an aggressive suitor.|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot help it," [...] Mr. Sabin said doggedly. [...] "The {{thing is}} at an end. To give up all the fruits of my work--the labour of {{the best years of}} my life--is as bitter to me as your dilemma is to you!

30|$|<b>It</b> should <b>be</b> {{pointed out}} that load model {{parameter}} identification is a typical nonlinear mathematical problem, and no optimization algorithm can guarantee {{the uniqueness of the}} results. Therefore, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>inevitable</b> that the identified model parameters have certain dispersion.|$|R
25|$|The {{denial of}} bail for Chung Yik-tin sparked {{controversy}} over the subjective application of the law. Legislator Ronny Tong accused the police of humiliating a suspect by their excessively hasty actions. The police's selectiveness in this case, as compared with previous cases of pornography distribution on the Internet, was also the focus of public attention. The local Chairman of the Internet Society and legislator Regina Ip said that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>inevitable</b> that police would apply the law selectively, for it would be impractical {{to take action against}} every person who had committed an offence in Hong Kong.|$|E
25|$|Although, {{as noted}} above, the women {{staffing}} comfort facilities {{were intended to}} be those already involved in the sex trade, in practice there were nowhere near enough prostitutes available, especially in the Tokyo area. The government had cracked down on prostitution late in the war and many women had fled or been evacuated to the countryside following heavy Allied bombing. Tokyo's most famous red light district, Yoshiwara, had been reduced from a prewar population of 2,000 prostitutes to only a few dozen {{by the end of}} the war. Therefore, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>inevitable</b> that efforts were made to recruit from the general population, a tactic that was authorized by the police.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{increasingly}} seditious content of Sinn Féin (Griffith attacked the British war effort in every issue) <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>inevitable</b> {{that it would be}} banned. This may have been a deliberate strategy on his part to separate himself of the debt-ridden SFPP, blame the British authorities and get a new publishing project off the ground. The fact that Griffith had already started editing a new newspaper, Éire-Ireland, for the IRB before Sinn Féin was banned would support this to a certain extent. At the very least, it suggests that Griffith expected to be banned and was not prepared to tone down his language.|$|E
30|$|Adnexal {{surgery is}} {{frequently}} required in {{women of all}} ages. Since there are no accepted discriminatory tests to identify malignancy preoperatively, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>inevitable</b> that adnexal malignancy will be encountered inadvertently {{which may or may}} not be recognized intra-operatively.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>inevitable</b> {{that medical}} {{conditions}} of varying complexity, severity and emergency will occur during spaceflight missions with human participants. Different levels of care are required {{depending on the}} problem, available resources and time required to return to Earth.|$|R
50|$|Nepenthes alata {{exhibits}} great variability {{across its}} range and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>inevitable</b> that some plants will deviate from the characters outlined by Jebb and Cheek. However, the overall combination of morphological differences appears to <b>be</b> stable and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> this that demarcates these species.|$|R
25|$|With {{a declining}} {{military}} role for railways both in Britain {{and the rest}} of the world, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>inevitable</b> that the significance of the facilities offered by the LMR would be reduced in later years. Even so, the LMR was still important enough for the tracks of the Bentley to Bordon branch to be left in place when passenger services were withdrawn on 16 September 1957. This line remained in place as, although there was a British Railways connection at Liss, the Bordon branch made it easier to accommodate the movements of military traffic at short notice. In 1966, the movement of goods over the Bordon branch was suspended, and the line was taken up in 1967.|$|E
25|$|The Black Death also {{affected}} {{arts and culture}} significantly. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>inevitable</b> that a catastrophe of such proportions would affect some of the greater building projects, {{as the amount of}} available labour fell sharply. The building of the cathedrals of Ely and Exeter was temporarily halted in the years immediately following the first outbreak of the plague. The shortage of labour also helped advance the transition from the Decorated style of building to the less elaborate Perpendicular style. The Black Death may also have promoted the use of vernacular English, as the number of teachers proficient in French dwindled. This, in turn, would have contributed to the late-fourteenth century flowering of English literature, represented by writers such as Geoffrey Chaucer and John Gower.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>inevitable</b> {{that the}} high regard {{in which he was}} held as a lawyer should lead to his being named on various state {{commissions}} of reform. In 1872, less than a decade after he began to practice law, the Connecticut legislature elected him one of a commission of five that made the Revision of 1875, the General Statutes of the State of Connecticut. In the same year {{he was a member of}} a state commission appointed to revise the education laws. Six years later he was named by the governor of Connecticut acting under a resolution of the state legislature one of a commission of five to inquire into the feasibility of simplifying legal procedure. This commission drew up a set of rules and forms which were approved and adopted by the court as the basis of pleading in civil cases.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a review}} of Guns, Germs, and Steel that {{ultimately}} commended the book, historian Tom Tomlinson wrote, [...] "Given {{the magnitude of the}} task he has set himself, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>inevitable</b> that Professor Diamond uses very broad brush-strokes to fill in his argument." ...|$|R
3000|$|Discussion: Considering the {{increasing}} role of endoscopic surgery standarised {{education and training}} {{becomes more and more}} essential.

50|$|Conflicts occur, {{according}} to Jacobs, when the precepts appropriate to one syndrome {{are applied to}} the other. This always generates problems. Furthermore, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>inevitable</b> that problematic intermixing of the syndromes will occur over time, resulting in what she refers to as monstrous moral hybrids.|$|R
25|$|The {{absence of}} any ruling about matches played before 1947 (or before 1895 in Great Britain) has caused {{problems}} for cricket historians and especially statisticians. Important matches that meet the official definitions, assuming they featured teams of the necessary high standard, have been recorded since 1697 having been in vogue since the 1660s. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>inevitable</b> that historians and statisticians would seek to apply unofficial first-class status retrospectively, in contravention of the ICC and MCC directives. The position is that each writer must compile his own list based on his personal opinions. As a result, significant differences may be observed in published statistical records with particular impact on the career records of W. G. Grace, Jack Hobbs and Herbert Sutcliffe. There are differences in the perceived status of certain matches played by Gloucestershire teams before the county club was formed in 1870 and by Somerset in 1879 and 1881.|$|E
25|$|Since Macpherson {{had long}} {{served as the}} coach for the Bryan brothers, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>inevitable</b> that the twins would want to follow him {{just as they did}} when he was hired as the Aviators' head coach in 2014. Consequently, prior to the WTT draft on March 16, 2015, the Aviators traded Bob and Mike Bryan to the Dream for {{financial}} consideration. The Aviators did not protect 2014 WTT Female Most Valuable Player Daniela Hantuchová in the marquee portion of the draft. Madison Keys was assigned to the Aviators as a league-designated player, and they selected her as their only marquee draft pick. In the roster portion of the draft, the Aviators protected Raven Klaasen and Květa Peschke. They did not protect 2014 WTT Male Rookie of the Year Somdev Devvarman. The Aviators selected amateur Taylor Fritz and Chanelle Scheepers in the roster portion of the draft. Fritz was the only amateur player selected in the 2015 WTT Draft.|$|E
25|$|The major {{political}} {{question of the}} time, though, was federation. Forrest was in favour of federation, and felt that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>inevitable,</b> but he also felt that Western Australia should not join until it obtained fair terms. He was heavily involved in the framing of the Australian Constitution, representing Western Australia {{at a number of}} meetings on federation, including the National Australasian Conventions in Sydney in 1891 and in Adelaide in 1897, and the Australasian Federal Conventions in Sydney in 1897 and in Melbourne in 1898. He fought hard {{to protect the rights of}} the less populous states, arguing for a strong upper house organised along state lines. He also argued for a number of concessions to Western Australia, and for the building of a trans-Australian railway. Although he was largely unsuccessful in his endeavours, by 1900 he was convinced that better terms were not to be obtained, so called the referendum in which Western Australians voted to join the federation, and Western Australia became a part of Australia in 1901.|$|E
50|$|The second {{finding is}} that because of {{changing}} consumer preferences over time, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>inevitable</b> that (short term) sectorial imbalances will arise due to the changing structure of the demands for goods. Therefore, this will be a permanent source of disequilibrium in the system.|$|R
50|$|With {{over one}} million {{visitors}} per year, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>inevitable</b> that some will deface the rock faces of the canyon. The Glen Canyon NRA has implemented a voluntourism program wherein volunteers {{sign up for a}} five-day houseboat trip to remove graffiti from the canyon walls.|$|R
30|$|Finally, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>inevitable</b> that an emission-saving {{technological}} progress stimulates not only consumption but also emissions. Such {{technological progress}} cheapens the imputed price of CO 2. Although this possibly {{bodes well for}} the current generation, it accelerates CO 2 accumulation and translates into a negative inheritance for our descendants.|$|R
25|$|Howes {{moved to}} the family's country house in Essendon, Hertfordshire for the {{duration}} of World War II. She was a show-business baby who lived a quiet, orderly childhood where she grew up with a nanny and was surrounded by a variety of pets and her parents' theatrical peers, including actor/writer Jack Hulbert and his wife, actress Cicely Courtneidge, who had an adjoining house. Her first taste of the stage was school productions, but as she came from a theatrical family, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>inevitable</b> that another family friend, an agent who was visiting the Howes family for dinner, became impressed with her and not long after suggested the young Sally Ann for a role in a movie. Two hundred young girls had already been screen tested without success, and the producers were desperate to find a talented little girl to play the lead, and they asked her father to please rush in some pictures on the recommendation of the agent. The movie, Thursday's Child, was written by playwright and screenwriter Rodney Ackland, also a close neighbour to the Howes family, and it would become Ackland's directorial debut. Thursday's Child (1943) launched her career. A second film, The Halfway House (1944), led to her being put under contract by Michael Balcon of Ealing Studios, and this was followed by many other film roles as a child actress, including Dead of Night (1945) with Sir Michael Redgrave, Pink String and Sealing Wax (1946), Nicholas Nickleby (1947), My Sister and I (1948) and Anna Karenina (1948), with Vivien Leigh.|$|E
500|$|In her youth, Thompson was {{intrigued}} by language and literature, a trait which she attributes to her father, who shared her love of words. In 1977, she began studying for an English degree at Newnham College, University of Cambridge. Thompson believes that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>inevitable</b> that she would become an actress, commenting that she was [...] "surrounded by creative people and I don’t think it would ever have gone any other way, really". While there, she had a [...] "seminal moment" [...] that turned her to feminism and inspired her to take up performing. She explained {{in an interview in}} 2007 how she discovered the book The Madwoman in the Attic, [...] "which is about Victorian female writers and the disguises they took on in order to express what they wanted to express. That completely changed my life." [...] She became a self-professed [...] "punk rocker", with short red hair and a motorbike, and aspired to be a comedian like Lily Tomlin.|$|E
500|$|The {{period from}} 1219 to 1295 also shaped future conflicts: the pagan Lithuanians were {{surrounded}} by the aggressive Roman Catholic Orders to its north and southwest, and by adherents of the Orthodox Church in the east. The Catholic Orders' raids intensified after they overcame the [...] "buffer zone" [...] created by Prussians, Nadruvians, Skalvians, Yotvingians, and Semigalians by 1283. The Lithuanian relationships with the Orthodox Church were more peaceful. The people were allowed to practise their religion; Lithuanian dukes {{did not hesitate to}} marry daughters of Orthodox dukes; {{at least some of the}} dukes' scribes must have been Orthodox as well. Struggles with the Teutonic Knights and expansion to the east were characteristic of the years from 1295 to 1377. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>inevitable</b> that Lithuania could not endure religious, political, and cultural isolation forever and would have to choose either Roman Catholicism or Eastern Orthodoxy. In 1386, Grand Duke Jogaila elected baptism in the Catholic rite to marry Jadwiga of Poland and become King of Poland; the last pagan state in Europe was converted to Christianity.|$|E
30|$|The output {{frequency}} and frequency {{stability of the}} frequency standard vary with supplied voltage and the temperature around the frequency standard. Therefore, delay or phase characteristics of all devices of the system also vary slightly with these parameters. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>inevitable</b> to both stabilize and monitor these parameters.|$|R
5000|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>inevitable</b> {{that anyone}} who was so favoured by the King attracts envy.
