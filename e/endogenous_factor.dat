40|$|Selective {{sustained}} attention (SSA) {{is vital}} for higher order cognition. Although <b>endogenous</b> and exogenous <b>factors</b> influence SSA, assessment {{of the degree to}} which these factors influence performance and learning is often challenging. We report findings from the Track-It task, a paradigm that aims to assess the contribution of <b>endogenous</b> and exogenous <b>factors</b> to SSA within the same task. Behavioral accuracy and eye-tracking data on the Track-It task were correlated with performance on a learning task. Behavioral accuracy and fixations to distractors did not predict learning when exogenous factors supported SSA. In contrast, fixations to distractors were negatively correlated with learning when <b>endogenous</b> <b>factors</b> supported SSA. Similarly, higher behavioral accuracy was correlated with greater learning when <b>endogenous</b> <b>factors</b> supported SSA. These findings suggest that although children showed equivalent levels of distractibility when exogenous and <b>endogenous</b> <b>factors</b> supported SSA, different conditions of the Track-It task likely engaged different attentional control mechanisms...|$|R

50|$|In vivo, factor XII is {{activated}} by contact to polyanions. Activated platelets secrete inorganic polymers, polyphosphates. Contact to polyphosphates activates factor XII and initiates fibrin formation by the intrinsic pathway of coagulation with critical importance for thrombus formation. Targeting polyphosphates with phosphatases interfered with procoagulant activity of activated platelets and blocked platelet-induced thrombosis in mice. Addition of polyphosphates restored defective plasma clotting of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome patients, {{indicating that the}} inorganic polymer is the <b>endogenous</b> <b>factor</b> XII activator in vivo. Platelet polyphosphate-driven factor XII activation provides the link from primary hemostasis (formation of a platelet plug) to secondary hemostasis (fibrin meshwork formation).|$|E

40|$|The precise {{timing of}} the {{inhibition}} of stenotele differentiation by an <b>endogenous</b> <b>factor</b> in Hydra was localized in the terminal cell cycle of the precursor cells. Animals were treated with crude extract of Hydra and the inhibition kinetics of stenotele differentiation were determined. Com-parison of these results with the differentiation kinetics of stenoteles determined by using [3 H]thy-midine labelling indicated that an endogenous fac-tor inhibited precursor cells from entering the stenotele pathway near the S/G 2 boundary of the terminal cell cycle. Since stenotele commitment occurs during this time, {{these results suggest that}} an <b>endogenous</b> <b>factor</b> specifically blocks stenotele commitment.

40|$|Increasingly, <b>endogenous</b> <b>factors</b> and {{processes}} are being emphasized as drivers in regional {{economic development and}} growth. This 15 chapter book is unique in that it commences by presenting five disciplinary takes on endogenous development {{from the perspectives of}} economics, geography, sociology, planning and organizational management. Several chapters demonstrate how researchers have developed operational models to investigate the roles played by <b>endogenous</b> <b>factors</b> in regional economic development, including the role of entrepreneurial rents. Further chapters provide empirical investigations of <b>endogenous</b> <b>factors</b> in regional development at various levels of spatial scale - from the supraregion to the nation, city and small town - and in a variety of situational settings, including the European Union, Asia and Australia.

40|$|AbstractTwenty {{patients}} with {{acute myocardial infarction}} treated with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) had <b>endogenous</b> <b>factor</b> XII-dependent fibrinolytic activity levels measured throughout the hospital period and those levels were prospectively correlated with the incidence of recurrent myocardial infarction until 8 weeks after hospital discharge. Within the follow-up period, recurrent myocardial infarction was observed in 8 patients, whereas the remaining 12 patients showed no clinical evidence of recurrence. The patients in the reinfarction group were characterized by a more pronounced depletion of and sustained lower levels of factor XII-dependent fibrinolytic activity than were the {{patients with}} no reinfarction (p < 0. 05). The decrease in fibrinolytic activity during rt-PA therapy {{was significantly associated with}} a depletion of functional alpha 2 -antiplasmin, the primary plasmin inhibitor. These results indicate that, paradoxically, coronary thrombolysis with rt-PA involves depletion of <b>endogenous</b> <b>factor</b> XII-dependent fibrinolytic activity levels, which constitutes a risk for early myocardial reinfarction...|$|E
40|$|Evidence {{has been}} {{previously}} presented that an endogenous pyrogen is demonstrable in the circulation of rabbits with fever caused by the intravenous injection of typhoid vaccine (1, 2). The <b>endogenous</b> <b>factor</b> is readily differentiated from the pyrogenic component of the vaccine and reaches a maximum concentration well after the latter has been cleared from the blood stream. Its presence in the circulation is closely correlated with the fever. These observations have recently been confirmed in analogous studies made with dogs (3). The biological properties of the newly identified pyrogen were originally found to be identical {{with those of the}} heat-labile pyrogenic substance which is extractable from polymorphonuclear leucocytes (1, 2). Further evidence as to the identity of the two factors has subsequently been reported (4, 5). Because the <b>endogenous</b> <b>factor</b> makes its appearance in the blood stream shortly after the leucopenia which follows the injection of vaccine, the hypothesis has been advanced that the febrile response is caused by the action of endogenous pyroge...|$|E

40|$|Intravenous {{administration}} of bacterial endotoxins in dogs is followed within 2 hours {{by the appearance}} of a fever-producing substance in the blood. This endogenous pyrogen differs from the endotoxins originally administered by its ability to produce fever in tolerant recipients and failure to promote tolerance after repeated daily injections. Endogenous serum pyrogen is destroyed by heating at 90 °C. for 30 minutes, and is also inactivated to some degree by incubation at 37 °C. for 24 hours. Suppression of fever by aminopyrine does not affect appearance of the <b>endogenous</b> <b>factor.</b> Animals made febrile with dinitrophenol, kaolin, or lysergic acid do not elaborate a fever-promoting substance in the blood. Sterile abscesses, accompanied by elevations in body temperature of the host, are unassociated with detectable amounts of secondary pyrogen in the serum. The absence of endogenous pyrogen in the blood of febrile dogs made leukopenic with nitrogen mustard favors the idea that polymorphonuclear leukocytes injured by endotoxins release the <b>endogenous</b> <b>factor.</b> On the other hand, the finding that the granulocytopenic animals are febrile when no circulating endogenous pyrogen is present, casts doubt upon the essential role of this substance in endotoxin fever...|$|E
40|$|Within the XXth century, {{especially}} {{in the second half}} thereof, the approach views of the relation between the population and economy (both of them regarded in dynamics) have multiplied themselves, the points of view as regards this subject becoming not only much more diverse but also opposite. All these views are characterised by the population transformation in <b>endogenous</b> <b>factor</b> (in internal, intrinsic side) of the economic development (of the economic growth), factor that, at its turn, is determined by the economic processes. The double position of the population in the demo-economical relations system - as main production factor and as virtual recipient of produced goods - is a strong argument in the favour of the demographic factor as <b>endogenous</b> <b>factor</b> of growth and economic development. The correlations between the two variables are diverse and very difficultly to be quantified. It is known that the effect of the demographic impact upon the economic factor is felt after many years from the date of the demo-economic phenomenon occurring. So, within the last decades, the research intended to identify certain essential, durable relations between the population evolution and the economic growth became more intensive.
