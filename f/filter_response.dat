5|$|Elliptic {{filters are}} filters {{produced}} by the insertion-loss method which use elliptic rational functions in their transfer function as an approximation to the ideal <b>filter</b> <b>response</b> {{and the result is}} called a Chebyshev approximation. This is the same Chebyshev approximation technique used by Cauer on image filters but follows the Darlington insertion-loss design method and uses slightly different elliptic functions. Cauer had some contact with Darlington and Bell Labs before WWII (for a time he worked in the US) but during the war they worked independently, in some cases making the same discoveries. Cauer had disclosed the Chebyshev approximation to Bell Labs but had not left them with the proof. Sergei Schelkunoff provided this and a generalisation to all equal ripple problems. Elliptic filters are a general class of filter which incorporate several other important classes as special cases: Cauer filter (equal ripple in passband and stopband), Chebyshev filter (ripple only in passband), reverse Chebyshev filter (ripple only in stopband) and Butterworth filter (no ripple in either band).|$|E
5|$|The {{essence of}} network {{synthesis}} {{is to start}} with a required <b>filter</b> <b>response</b> and produce a network that delivers that response, or approximates to it within a specified boundary. This is the inverse of network analysis which starts with a given network and by applying the various electric circuit theorems predicts the response of the network. The term was first used with this meaning in the doctoral thesis of Yuk-Wing Lee (1930) and apparently arose out of a conversation with Vannevar Bush. The advantage of network synthesis over previous methods is that it provides a solution which precisely meets the design specification. This is not the case with image filters, a degree of experience is required in their design since the image filter only meets the design specification in the unrealistic case of being terminated in its own image impedance, to produce which would require the exact circuit being sought. Network synthesis on the other hand, takes care of the termination impedances simply by incorporating them into the network being designed.|$|E
5|$|The {{frequency}} response behaviour of all mechanical filters {{can be expressed}} as an equivalent electrical circuit using the impedance analogy described above. An {{example of this is}} shown in figure 8b which is the equivalent circuit of the mechanical filter of figure 8a. Elements on the electrical side, such as the inductance of the magnetostrictive transducer, are omitted but would be taken into account in a complete design. The series resonant circuits on the circuit diagram represent the torsional resonators, and the shunt capacitors represent the coupling wires. The component values of the electrical equivalent circuit can be adjusted, more or less at will, by modifying the dimensions of the mechanical components. In this way, all the theoretical tools of electrical analysis and filter design can be brought to bear on the mechanical design. Any filter realisable in electrical theory can, in principle, also be realised as a mechanical filter. In particular, the popular finite element approximations to an ideal <b>filter</b> <b>response</b> of the Butterworth and Chebyshev filters can both readily be realised. As with the electrical counterpart, the more elements that are used, the closer the approximation approaches the ideal, however, for practical reasons the number of resonators does not normally exceed eight.|$|E

5|$|Another common {{low-pass}} design {{technique is}} {{to implement the}} shunt capacitors as stubs with the resonant frequency set above the operating frequency so that the stub impedance is capacitive in the passband. This implementation has a lumped-element counterpart of a general form similar to the filter of figure 6. Where space allows, the stubs may be set on alternate sides of the main line {{as shown in figure}} 7(a). The purpose of this is to prevent coupling between adjacent stubs which detracts from the filter performance by altering the frequency response. However, a structure with all the stubs on the same side is still a valid design. If the stub is required to be a very low impedance line, the stub may be inconveniently wide. In these cases, a possible solution is to connect two narrower stubs in parallel. That is, each stub position has a stub {{on both sides of the}} line. A drawback of this topology is that additional transverse resonant modes are possible along the λ/2 length of line formed by the two stubs together. For a choke design, the requirement is simply to make the capacitance as large as possible, for which the maximum stub width of λ/4 may be used with stubs in parallel on both sides of the main line. The resulting filter looks rather similar to the stepped impedance filter of figure 5, but has been designed on completely different principles. A difficulty with using stubs this wide is that the point at which they are connected to the main line is ill defined. A stub that is narrow in comparison to λ can be taken as being connected on its centre-line and calculations based on that assumption will accurately predict <b>filter</b> <b>response.</b> For a wide stub, however, calculations that assume the side branch is connected at a definite point on the main line leads to inaccuracies as this is no longer a good model of the transmission pattern. One solution to this difficulty is to use radial stubs instead of linear stubs. A pair of radial stubs in parallel (one on either side of the main line) is called a butterfly stub (see figure 7(b)). A group of three radial stubs in parallel, which can be achieved at the end of a line, is called a clover-leaf stub.|$|E
500|$|In principle, any non-zero {{frequency}} {{point on the}} <b>filter</b> <b>response</b> {{could be used as}} a reference for the prototype design. [...] For example, for filters with ripple in the passband, the corner frequency is usually defined as the highest frequency at maximum ripple rather than 3dB. [...] Another case is in image parameter filters (an older design method than the more modern network synthesis filters) which use the cut-off frequency rather than the 3dB point since cut-off is a well-defined point in this type of filter.|$|E

The SRF model connects random field models with anisotropic regularization and provides a statistical motivation for the latter.

500|$|Constant k filters, also k-type filters, are {{a type of}} {{electronic}} filter designed using the image method. [...] They are the original and simplest filters produced by this methodology and consist of a ladder network of identical sections of passive components. Historically, {{they are the first}} filters that could approach the ideal filter frequency response to within any prescribed limit {{with the addition of a}} sufficient number of sections.

500|$|A {{consequence}} of the image method of filter design is {{that the effect of}} the end terminations has to be calculated separately if its effects on response are to be taken into account. [...] The most severe deviation of the response from that predicted occurs in the passband close to cut-off. [...] The reason for this is twofold. [...] Further into the passband the impedance match progressively improves, thus limiting the error. [...] On the other hand, waves in the stopband are reflected from the end termination due to mismatch but are attenuated twice by the filter stopband rejection as they pass through it. [...] So while stopband impedance mismatch may be severe, it has only limited effect on the <b>filter</b> <b>response.</b>|$|E

[...] The sections of the coupler are treated as being sections of a filter, and by adjusting the coupling factor of each section the coupled port can be made to have any of the classic filter responses such as maximally flat (Butterworth filter), equal-ripple (Cauer filter), or a specified-ripple (Chebychev <b>filter)</b> <b>response.</b> [...] Ripple is the maximum variation in output of the coupled port in its passband, usually quoted as plus or minus a value in dB from the nominal coupling factor.Matthaei et al., pp.775–777 ...|$|E

40|$|In {{an effort}} to {{understand}} the meaning of the intermediate representations captured by deep networks, recent papers have tried to associate specific semantic concepts to individual neural network <b>filter</b> <b>responses,</b> where interesting correlations are often found, largely by focusing on extremal <b>filter</b> <b>responses.</b> In this paper, we show that this approach can favor easy-to-interpret cases that are not necessarily representative of the average behavior of a representation. A more realistic but harder-to-study hypothesis is that semantic representations are distributed, and thus filters must be studied in conjunction. In order to investigate this idea while enabling systematic visualization and quantification of multiple <b>filter</b> <b>responses,</b> we introduce the Net 2 Vec framework, in which semantic concepts are mapped to vectorial embeddings based on corresponding <b>filter</b> <b>responses.</b> By studying such embeddings, we are able to show that 1., in most cases, multiple filters are required to code for a concept, that 2., often filters are not concept specific and help encode multiple concepts, and that 3., compared to single filter activations, filter embeddings are able to better characterize the meaning of a representation and its relationship to other concepts.

40|$|Texture {{segmentation}} is {{a difficult}} problem, as is apparent from camouflage pictures. A Textured region can contain texture elements of various sizes, each of which can itself be textured.

At the same time our process uses the statistics of <b>filter</b> <b>responses</b> to characterize textures. In our process the shape measures and the <b>filter</b> <b>responses</b> crosstalk extensively. In addition, a top-down cleaning process is applied to avoid mixing the statistics of neighboring segments.

500|$|The image {{analysis}} {{starts with a}} calculation of the input and output impedances (the image impedances) and the transfer function of a section in an infinite chain of identical sections. This can {{be shown to be}} equivalent to the performance of a section terminated in its image impedances.Laplante, p.341. The image method, therefore, relies on each filter section being terminated with the correct image impedance. This is easy enough to do with the internal sections of a multiple section filter, because it is only necessary to ensure that the sections facing the one in question have identical image impedances. However, the end sections are a problem. They will usually be terminated with fixed resistances that the filter cannot match perfectly except at one specific frequency. This mismatch leads to multiple reflections at the filter terminations and at the junctions between sections. [...] These reflections result in the <b>filter</b> <b>response</b> deviating quite sharply from the theoretical, especially near the cut-off frequency.|$|E
500|$|Modes are {{numbered}} {{according to the}} number of half-wavelengths in the vibration. [...] Some modes exhibit vibrations in more than one direction (such as drumhead mode which has two) and consequently the mode number consists of more than one number. [...] When the vibration is in one of the higher modes, there will be multiple nodes on the resonator where there is no motion. For some types of resonator, this can provide a convenient place to make a mechanical attachment for structural support. Wires attached at nodes will have no effect on the vibration of the resonator or the overall <b>filter</b> <b>response.</b> In figure 5, some possible anchor points are shown as wires attached at the nodes.

[...] Low-pass waveguide filters do not pass frequencies {{all the way down to}} zero because of the waveguide cutoff effect. [...] A better choice is the Achieser-Zolotarev filter. [...] This filter is based on Zolotarev polynomials (which include the Chebyshev polynomials as a special case) discovered by Yegor Ivanovich Zolotarev. [...] The Zolotarev response has a stopband at low frequency, the cutoff of which can be controlled by the designer so it is not detrimental in a waveguide filter. [...] The advantage of the Zolotarev response is that it results in a filter with a better impedance match to the connecting waveguides compared to the Chebyshev filter or image-parameter filters.|$|E
