5|$|Dubnium {{with its}} atomic number 105 is a superheavy element; like all {{elements}} of such high atomic number, it is highly unstable. The most stable known isotope of dubnium, 268Db, has a half-life of around a day. Thus, even <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> once existed on Earth, it would have decayed completely long ago and can only be obtained by artificial production.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{revenue-sharing}} agreements among Big East schools, Virginia Tech's selection by the Gator Bowl {{resulted in}} a payment of $1.7 million less than <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been selected by a BCS bowl game. Instead of receiving about $3.5 million from the revenue agreement and bowl payout, Tech received about $1.8 million.|$|E
5|$|Free-flights of Progress {{spacecraft}} typically lasted {{two days}} from launch to docking with Mir, however Progress M1-5 took {{three days to}} reach Mir in order to conserve fuel for the deorbit burn. <b>If</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> launched on 18 January it would have spent four days in free flight.|$|E

5|$|From {{the end of}} World War II {{until about}} 1971, the Bretton Woods system of semi-fixed {{exchange}} rates meant that competitive devaluation was not an option, {{which was one of}} the design objectives of the systems' architects. Additionally, global growth was generally very high in this period, so there was little incentive for currency war even <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been possible.|$|E
5|$|If Progress M1-5 had {{launched}} on 16 January, the Soyuz launch {{would have occurred}} on 10 February <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been required. It was stood down around 22 February, after the decaying altitude of Mir made it too dangerous to send a crew to it.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} whether {{the story of the}} Tree That Owns Itself began with the Weekly Banner article, or <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been an element of local {{folklore}} prior to that time. The article's author writes that, in 1890, there were few people still living who knew the story.|$|E
5000|$|A {{factor is}} called {{discrete}} (or occasionally tame) <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> type I, and continuous (or occasionally wild) <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> type II or III.|$|R
2500|$|An {{interval}} {{is said to}} be left-closed <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> {{a minimum}} element, right-closed <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> a maximum, and simply closed <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> both.

5|$|One of the {{advantages}} of linezolid is its high bioavailability (close to 100%) when given by mouth: the entire dose reaches the bloodstream, as <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been given intravenously. This means that people receiving intravenous linezolid may be switched to oral linezolid as soon as their condition allows it, whereas comparable antibiotics (such as vancomycin and quinupristin/dalfopristin) can only be given intravenously.|$|E
5|$|The {{meteoroid}} was {{not dangerous}} {{to life on}} Earth. Even <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> headed towards lower parts of the atmosphere it would have heated {{so much that it}} would have exploded high above the ground and only some small particles (meteorites) eventually might have made it to Earth's surface.|$|E
5|$|The only ships on {{the lake}} {{following}} the American retreat from Quebec were those of a small fleet of lightly armed ships that Benedict Arnold had assembled following the capture of Fort Ticonderoga in May 1775. This fleet, even <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been in British hands, {{was too small to}} transport the large British army to Fort Ticonderoga.|$|E

5|$|Aghartas 1976 North American release had {{different}} artwork designed by John Berg, the art director from Davis' U.S. label, Columbia Records. In its liner notes, an inscription said the record should be listened {{to at the}} highest possible volume, and the trumpeter was credited for the arrangements. After it was released, Macero received a complaint from Columbia's accounting department about Davis being compensated $2,500 per arrangement, arguing {{that none of the}} music sounded as <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been arranged.|$|E
5|$|And so matters stood {{until the}} massive PAVN/NLF Tet Offensive of early 1968. Although a {{tactical}} victory for American and South Vietnamese forces, Tet became a political disaster. The American public (who had been reassured by President Lyndon B. Johnson and the Pentagon that the communists were incapable of launching any such actions) were {{stunned by the}} size and ferocity of the offensive. The {{light at the end}} of the tunnel had been extinguished, <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> ever existed at all. The president, in an attempt to nudge Hanoi to the negotiating table, decreed an end to bombing operations in North Vietnam north of the 20th parallel, effectively ending Rolling Thunder on 11 November 1968.|$|E
5|$|Findings {{from the}} Dawn {{spacecraft}} have {{found evidence that}} the troughs that wrap around Vesta could be graben formed by impact-induced faulting (see Troughs section above), meaning that Vesta has more complex geology than other asteroids. Vesta could have been classified as a dwarf planet <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> retained a spherical shape, and it has other qualities {{that lead to the}} thought it could be a protoplanet. The only thing that knocked it out of the category of a dwarf planet was the formation of two large impact basins at its southern pole. At the time of these impacts Vesta was not warm and plastic enough to return to a shape in hydrostatic equilibrium.|$|E

5|$|<b>If</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> gone by me, it's a two-on-one. So I got {{a little}} lucky there, but Derek gave me a great pass and when I got the pass I was moving across. As I skated across, Glenn had to move across the crease and had to open his pads a little. I was really {{trying to get the}} puck on net, and I did. As I went across, Glenn's legs opened. I looked back, and I saw it go in, so I jumped.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, the primary legal test used in the United States to {{determine}} if speech could be criminalized was the bad tendency test. Rooted in English common law, the test permitted speech to be outlawed <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> a tendency to harm public welfare. One of the earliest {{cases in which the}} Supreme Court addressed punishment after material was published was Patterson v. Colorado (1907) in which the Court used the bad tendency test to uphold contempt charges against a newspaper publisher who accused Colorado judges of acting on behalf of local utility companies.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the dodo may already have been rare or localised before the arrival of humans on Mauritius, since it would have been unlikely to become extinct so rapidly <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> occupied all the remote areas of the island. A 2005 expedition found subfossil remains of dodos and other animals killed by a flash flood. Such mass mortalities would have further jeopardised a species already in danger of becoming extinct. Yet the fact that the dodo survived hundreds of years of volcanic activity and climactic changes shows the bird was resilient within its ecosystem.|$|E

5|$|Laying pipe {{took several}} stages. First, {{the right of}} way had to be cleared with chainsaws, bulldozers, and {{scrapers}} who followed the rough route laid out by the initial surveyors. These crews were followed by another group of surveyors and engineers who determined whether the pipeline could be laid in the planned spot, or <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> to be moved because of permafrost, soft ground, or other considerations. State and federal surveillance officers, working with the engineers, could give the OK to move the path of the pipeline as much as 200 feet to the right or left in order to avoid obstacles.|$|E
5|$|On July 12, 1939, Szilárd and Wigner {{drove in}} Wigner's car to Cutchogue on New York's Long Island, where Einstein was staying. When they {{explained}} {{about the possibility}} of atomic bombs, Einstein replied: Daran habe ich gar nicht gedacht (I did not even think about that). Szilárd dictated a letter in German to the Belgian Ambassador to the United States. Wigner wrote it down, and Einstein signed it. At Wigner's suggestion, they also prepared a letter for the State Department explaining what they were doing and why, giving it two weeks to respond <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> any objections.|$|E
