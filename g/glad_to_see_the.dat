The Malayans were thus {{on the whole}} <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> British back in 1945, but things could not remain as they were before the war, and a stronger desire for independence grew. Britain was bankrupt and the new Labour government was keen to withdraw its forces from the East as soon as possible. Colonial self-rule and eventual independence were now British policy. The tide of colonial nationalism sweeping through Asia soon reached Malaya. But most Malays were more concerned with defending themselves against the MCP which was mostly made up of Chinese, than with demanding independence from the British; indeed, their immediate concern was that the British not leave and abandon the Malays to the armed Communists of the MPAJA, which was the largest armed force in the country.|$|E
500|$|In February 2010, a 180-page {{volume of}} Mengele's diary was sold by Alexander Autographs at auction for an {{undisclosed}} sum to the grandson of a Holocaust survivor. The unidentified previous owner, who acquired the journals in Brazil, {{was reported to be}} close to the Mengele family. A Holocaust survivors' organization described the sale as [...] "a cynical act of exploitation aimed at profiting from the writings {{of one of the most}} heinous Nazi criminals." [...] Rabbi Marvin Hier of the Simon Wiesenthal Center was <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> diary fall into Jewish hands. [...] "At a time when Ahmadinejad's Iran regularly denies the Holocaust and anti-Semitism and hatred of Jews is back in vogue, this acquisition is especially significant," [...] he said. In 2011, a further 31 volumes of Mengele's diaries were sold—again amidst protests—by the same auction house to an undisclosed collector of World War II memorabilia for $245,000.|$|E
500|$|On 23 July {{they set}} off again longing to reach home, but FitzRoy wanted to ensure the {{accuracy}} of his longitude measurements and so took the ship across the Atlantic back to Bahia in Brazil to take check readings. Darwin was <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> beauties of the jungle for a last time, but now compared [...] "the stately Mango trees with the Horse Chesnuts of England." [...] The return trip was delayed for a further 11 days when weather forced the Beagle to shelter further up the coast at Pernambuco, where Darwin examined rocks for signs of elevation, noted [...] "Mangroves like rank grass" [...] and investigated marine invertebrates at various depths on the sandbar. The Beagle departed for home on 17 August. After a stormy passage including a stop for supplies at the Azores, the Beagle finally reached Falmouth, Cornwall, England on 2 October 1836. A plaque now commemorates his arrival point in Falmouth, Cornwall.|$|E

They {{had been told that}} it was a [...] "special mission" [...] to pick fruit. Instead they spent a year in Sumatra, with the Japanese using the men to cut through the jungle to lay railway track. Rations were a handful of maggot-ridden tapioca a day, which Frank continued to share with Judy. She also proved useful in conducting trades with the locals, as she would indicate when someone was hiding near to the track. Her barking deliberately alerted the guards to when there was something too large for her to handle in the jungle, such as tigers or elephants.|$|E
500|$|The first 20th century {{history of}} James I {{was written by}} E.W.M. Balfour-Melville in 1936 and {{continued}} the theme of James as the strong upholder {{of law and order}} and when describing Albany's trial and execution he writes 'the King had proved that high rank was no defence for lawlessness; the crown was enriched by the revenues of Fife, Menteith and Lennox'. Balfour-Melville views James as a lawmaker and a 'reformer' whose legislation was aimed at not only increasing the position of the king but of parliament. Michael Lynch describes how James's positive reputation began immediately after his death when the Bishop of Urbino kissed James's wounds and declared him to be a martyr. He suggests that the praise of the pro-James Scottish chroniclers and also of some modern historians to 'find strong king's to applaud' should not diminish the extent of parliament's ability to restrain the king nor minimise the confrontation that took place between James and a more self-assured parliament. Stephen Boardman takes the view that by {{the time of his death}} James had succeeded in breaking down the constraints on the exercise of royal authority which were rooted in the 'settlement of the kingdom' by Robert II. Christine McGladdery describes how opposing views were the result of 'competing propaganda after the murder'. To those who were <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> king dead, James was a tyrant who without reason aggressively assailed the nobility imposing forfeiture on their estates and who 'failed to deliver justice to his people'. She also provides the opposite viewpoint that the king was seen as giving 'strong leadership against magnate excesses' and that the murder 'was a disaster for the Scottish people, leaving them to endure the instability of years of consequent faction fighting'. McGladdery continues that James was the example for the Stewart kings to follow by putting 'Scotland firmly within a European context'. Michael Brown describes James as an 'able, aggressive and opportunistic politician' whose chief aim was to establish a monarchy that had stature and was free from the confrontations that had beset his father's reign. He characterises James as 'capable of highly effective short-term interventions' yet had failed to achieve a position of unqualified authority. Brown writes that James had come to power after 'fifty years when kings looked like magnates and magnates acted like kings' and succeeded in completely changing the outlook and objectives of the monarchy. [...] His policy of reducing the power and influence of the magnates, continued by his son James II, led to a more subordinate nobility. [...] Alexander Grant repudiates James's reputation as the 'law giver' and explains that nearly all of the king's legislation were reconstructs of laws laid down by previous monarchs and concludes that 'the idea of James's return in 1424 marks a turning-point in the development of Scots law is an exaggeration'. At James's death only the Douglases of the predominant magnatial houses was left and, according to Grant, this reduction was the most far-reaching change to the nobility and was 'by far the most important consequence of James I's reign'.|$|E

2500|$|Legislation {{similar to}} the FQPA was drafted and {{presented}} to Congress in 1995 but was never acted on. In 1996, the political landscape had changed and new pressures to act on pesticide control reform surfaced. In 1991, a coalition of environmental groups sued the EPA for failing to enforce the Delaney clause. The Delaney clause, an amendment of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, banned all food that contained any trace amount of any pesticide that may cause cancer. Although the EPA argued that the legislation was outdated and should {{not apply to the}} current situation, the coalition won in 1995 and the EPA was slated to ban 80 pesticides in late 1996. Under these new, more urgent circumstances, Congress was able to pass a bill that was celebrated by both sides of the debate; farmers, food processors and pesticide manufactures were <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> Delaney Clause go, while environmental groups and consumer advocates were pleased to have a formalized safety standard with an added emphasis on children. John Cady, president of the National Food Processors Association, praised the legislation for being [...] "...based on modern, real-world science".|$|E
2500|$|In 1925, Kirchner became {{close friends}} with fellow artist, Albert Müller and his family.

At the end of 1925, Kirchner {{returned}} to Germany and made his rounds to Frankfurt, Chemnitz (where he mother was living), and Berlin where he met with Karl Schmidt-Rottluff who wanted Kirchner {{to form a new}} artist's group; Kirchner politely refused. He then returned to Frauenkirch and wrote to Dr. Hageman on 26 March 1926: [...] "Now I’m sitting quietly at home again and I’m happy {{to be able to work}} undisturbed. I made a lot of sketches of life in Germany and it was very intriguing to see life there. I was also <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> old pictures of Rembrandt, Dürer, etc. again and to have the confirmation and encouragement they gave me.

In 1927, Kirchner organized a memorial exhibition for Albert Müller at the Kunsthalle Basel. There was a major exhibition of Kirchner's work at the schoolhouse in Davos; the reviews were positive.|$|E
