500|$|It {{was normal}} for Shaftesbury to {{occasionally}} disappear {{for a few}} days from time to time, so no one, other than his girlfriend was initially concerned with his disappearance. [...] "Anthony didn’t answer his telephone anymore. I was worried," [...] she says, [...] "I called again. I called England. This wasn’t like him. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> something bad had happened." ...|$|E
500|$|Christy joined Oppenheimer, Lauritsen [...] and [...] Robert Bacher, {{who joined}} the faculty at Caltech in 1949, in Project Vista, a {{detailed}} 1951 study on how Western Europe could be defended against the Soviet Union. Christy was distraught at {{the outcome of the}} 1954 Oppenheimer security hearing. When he encountered Teller, who had testified against Oppenheimer, at Los Alamos in 1954, Christy publicly refused to shake Teller's hand. [...] "I viewed Oppenheimer as a god", he later recalled, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> he was not a treasonable person." [...] Asked about his relationship with Teller in 2006, Christy said: ...|$|E
500|$|Elena Pignatti, who had {{employed}} Morisi {{after she}} left the Mortaras in 1857—her words about Morisi's misconduct had formed part of the Mortaras' appeal to the Pope—testified that [...] "seven or eight years ago... a son of the Mortaras, whose name I don't know, became sick, and {{it was said that}} he was going to die. Around then, one morning... I ran into Morisi. Among the other things we talked about, she—without mentioning the child's illness—asked me, 'I've heard that if you baptise a Jewish child who's about to die he goes to Heaven and gets indulgence; isn't that right?' I don't remember what I told her, but when the Mortara boy was kidnapped by order of the Dominican Father, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> he must have been the one who was sick". Pignatti said that she had herself seen Edgardo during his illness, and Marianna sitting by the crib—"Since his mother was crying, and despaired for his life, I thought he was dying, also because of his appearance: his eyes were closed, and he was hardly moving." [...] She added that during the three months when Morisi worked for her in late 1857, the servant had been summoned to San Domenico four or five times, and had said that the inquisitor had promised her a dowry.|$|E

6000|$|... "Do you?" [...] {{answered}} Elizabeth; [...] "so do <b>I.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> {{we shall}} meet again, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>be</b> {{glad to see}} you when we do, Mr. Bingham," [...] she added darkly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. De la Borne," [...] she said, [...] "I {{think that}} you have been very unjust and very rude to Major Forrest, who is an old friend of mine. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> you have <b>been</b> misled, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> some day you will ask his pardon." ...|$|R
500|$|Although {{known as}} one of Hollywood's most {{exciting}} on-screen couples, deHavilland and Errol Flynn were never involved in a romantic relationship. Upon first meeting her at Warner Bros. in August 1935, Flynn was drawn to the 19-year-old actress with [...] "warm brown eyes" [...] and [...] "extraordinary charm". In turn, deHavilland fell in love with him, but kept her feelings inside, later recalling, [...] "He never guessed I had a crush on him ... {{it never occurred to me}} that he was smitten with me, too." [...] Flynn later wrote, [...] "By the time we made The Charge of the Light Brigade, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> I was in love with her." [...] Flynn finally professed his love on March 12, 1937, at the Coronation Ball for King George VI at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, where they slow danced together to [...] "Sweet Leilani" [...] at the hotel's Coconut Grove nightclub. [...] "I was deeply affected by him," [...] she later remembered, [...] "It was impossible for me not to be." [...] The evening ended on a sobering note, however, with deHavilland insisting that despite his separation from his wife Lili Damita, he needed to divorce her before their relationship could proceed. Flynn reunited with his wife later that year, and deHavilland never acted on her feelings for Flynn.|$|E
