40|$|Food {{safety and}} {{shelf-life}} are both important microbial concerns {{in relation to}} broiler meat production. Focus is mainly placed on the absence or control of potentially pathogenic microbes such as Salmonella and Campylobacter but, from commercial point of view, other spoilage bacteria also play a role. Regarding food safety, the primary target should be the production of pathogen-free live animals, thereby allowing slaughter plants to keep the processing line free of those micro-organisms. Pathogen-free feed is fundamental in obtaining such conditions, as is the Good Hygienic Practice in farming, including <b>grand</b> <b>parent</b> <b>stock</b> (GPS), <b>parent</b> <b>stock</b> (PS) and hatcheries. Interventions in the slaughter plant cannot always completely remove pathogens. However there are some measures of control available, including separation of flocks, carcass decontamination and implementing a balanced and operational HACCP system. Shelf-life is closely linked to food safety during processing. The developments towards in-line processing, including chilling, portioning and deboning, allows optimal control. It minimizes processing time and product to product contact, and thus increases shelf-life and limits cross contamination. Refrigeration conditions are very important and an interruption of the refrigeration chain can accelerate microbial growth. Modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) may contribute in controlling the undesired growth of spoilage organisms, and {{can play a role}} in food safety as well. The consumer needs to be educated in how to deal with food of animal origin that cannot be produced in an entirely sterile environment, in order to ensure shelf-life and correct preparation and use...|$|R

The HI titre of each bird, yolk and chick was determined and expressed in log 2 and the mean titres for the <b>parent</b> <b>stock,</b> yolk and <b>chicks</b> were calculated. The ages of the <b>parent</b> <b>stock</b> ranged from 30 weeks for hatchery A to 95 weeks for hatchery B, all the hatcheries used to administer ND vaccine Hitchner B 1 (intra ocular) at day old, La Sota at 3 - 5 weeks, Komorov at 6 - 8 weeks and another dose of komorov at 16 - 18 weeks.

AB titre for the <b>parent</b> <b>stock</b> ranged from 5. 8 1. 6 to 7. 6 1. 6 log 2 and the titre for the egg also ranged from 5. 1 0. 9 to 6. 2 1. 7 log 2. The HI titre for the chick ranged from 3. 4 1. 4 to 5. 3 1. 1 log 2 at 1 day (d) old and it declines to a lowest value of 1. 1 1. 2 log 2 at 28 d. The study shows that all the <b>parent</b> <b>stock</b> had protective AB titre (5. 8 1. 6 to 7. 6 1. 6) and there is a correlation between the AB titre in the serum of the <b>parent</b> <b>stock</b> and that of the yolk. The AB titre in the chicks declines to non-protective level (1. 5 1. 1 log 2) at 14 d.

50|$|Goat farming {{also contributed}} to local consumption. By the late 1980s, the poultry {{industry}} was growing rapidly, relying in part on imported baby chicks from Britain and Zambia. Several private companies operated feed mills and incubators.

In 1987 the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, the International Development Bank, and the Ugandan government funded a poultry rehabilitation and development project worth US$17.2 million to establish hatchery units and feed mills and to import <b>parent</b> <b>stock</b> and baby <b>chicks.</b>|$|R
