40|$|The thermal {{degradation}} of iso-alpha-acids wasinvestigated at four pH levels between 4. 5 and 6. 5 at differentboiling temperatures (90 - 130 °C) during the wort boiling time(0 - 360 min). The free energy of activation {{and the reaction}} rateconstant (k) of the degradation of iso-alpha-acids werecalculated. Raising pH value from 4. 5 to 5. 5 and from 5. 5 to 6. 5 decreased the reaction energy about 20 kJ/mol. The relativeproportion of <b>isocohumulone</b> stays almost constant. Wedeveloped a kinetic model for the irreversible consecutivereation; iso-alpha-acids are isomerized form of alpha-acids bythe application of heat in solution {{and at the same}} timeiso-alpha-acids are degraded to humulinic acids and othercompounds. This kinetic model is useful to calculate time toadded hops into boiling kettle...|$|E
40|$|In this study, the {{influence}} of the mashing-off temperature (78 versus 95 degrees C) on alpha-acids behavior and isomerization during wort boiling at the 10 -L scale was investigated. In addition, various kettle-hopping regimes were applied to determine their possible impact on the isomerization of alpha-acids into iso-alpha-acids. As determined by quantitative HPLC as it function of wort-boiling tune, mashing-off at 95 degrees C always resulted in significantly higher hop alpha-acids utilization at the end of wore boiling (approx. 58 %) compared with conventional mashing-off at 78 degrees C (approx. 42 %). Moreover, with mashing-off at 95 degrees C, iso-alpha-acid profiles obtained at the end of wort boiling were potentially favorable in view of a finer, less lingering beer bitterness (relatively less <b>isocohumulone)</b> and prolonged bitterness stability upon aging (proportionally less trans-isomers). In regard to alternative hopping regimes, dosed addition of hop material as a function of wort boiling time resulted in similar alpha-acids utilizations compared with full hopping {{at the onset of the}} boil. Our results point to the potential of alternative ways of kettle hopping, in particular when mashing-off a. 95 degrees C, for more economic hopping combined with enhanced bitterness quality and stability. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Os principais compostos responsáveis pelo amargor de cervejas são os iso- &# 945;-ácidos provenientes do lúpulo, que participam de maneira importante no sabor da bebida. Procurou-se, neste trabalho, diferenciar algumas cervejas brasileiras líderes do mercado nacional em relação a algumas marcas disponíveis no mercado do oeste dos Estados Unidos, compreendendo cervejas tipo lager, ale e de microcervejarias. Discute-se a relação entre unidades de amargor (BU) e os teores de iso- &# 945;-ácidos totais e suas frações isohumulona, isocohumulona e isoadhumulona presentes nestes tipos de cerveja. Os resultados mostraram que a cerveja do tipo Indian Pale Ale apresentou maior nível de BU, apesar da concentração de iso- &# 945;-ácidos totais aproximar-se dos valores de cervejas lager e de microcervejaria. Cervejas tipo lager norte-americanas apresentaram as menores intensidades de amargor, seguidas das marcas brasileiras (de 11 a 15 BU). Com relação às frações dos iso- &# 945;-ácidos, destaca-se que a isoadhumulona foi a fração de concentração mais baixa em todas as amostras e que na maioria das amostras prevalecem concentrações superiores de isohumulona. A faixa de concentração de isohumulonas permaneceu entre 3, 0 e 17, 0 mg. L- 1 Iso-&# 945;-acids is a {{group of}} {{compounds}} which have an important participation in beer flavor. They are responsible for the bitterness which is provided by the hops used during brewing. This study was conducted in order to characterize some Brazilian and North American beers according to bitter characteristics, as Bitterness Units (BU), {{through the use of a}} spectrophotometric method or as total iso-&# 945;-acids and their isohumulone, <b>isocohumulone,</b> and isoadhumulone fractions by HPLC. Most of the beers evaluated were lager pilsener coming from market leader industries, ale and others produced in microbrewing plants. The Indian Pale Ale beer type, produced by late hopped process, showed the highest BU although the iso-&# 945;-acids content in this brand were not as higher as the BU compared to the other samples. North American lager beers presented lower intensities of bitter taste followed by the Brazilian brands (11 - 15 BU). With regards to the fractions of iso-&# 945;-acids, it is distinguished that isoadhumulona was the fraction of lower concentration in all the samples, and the majority of the samples showed higher concentration of isohumulona. The range of isohumulona was between 3, 0 and 17, 0 mg. L- 1...|$|E
