40|$|The acaricides clofentezine, {{hexythiazox}} and <b>etoxazole</b> {{are commonly}} referred to as ‘mite growth inhibitors’, and clofentezine and hexythiazox have been used successfully for the integrated control of plant mite pests for decades. Although they are still important today, their mode of action has remained elusive. Recently, a mutation in chitin synthase 1 (CHS 1) was linked to <b>etoxazole</b> resistance. In this study, we identified and investigated a Tetranychus urticae strain (HexR) harboring recessive, monogenic resistance to each of hexythiazox, clofentezine, and <b>etoxazole.</b> To elucidate if there is a common genetic basis for the observed cross-resistance, we adapted a previously developed bulk segregant analysis method to map with high resolution a single, shared resistance locus for all three compounds. This finding indicates that the underlying molecular basis for resistance to all three compounds is identical. This locus is centered on the CHS 1 gene, and as supported by additional genetic and biochemical studies, a non-synonymous variant (I 1017 F) in CHS 1 associates with resistance to each of the tested acaricides in HexR. Our findings thus demonstrate a shared molecular mode of action for the chemically diverse mite growth inhibitors clofentezine, hexythiazox and <b>etoxazole</b> as inhibitors of an essential, non-catalytic activity of CHS 1. Given the previously documented cross-resistance between clofentezine, hexythiazox and the benzyolphenylurea (BPU) compounds flufenoxuron and cycloxuron, CHS 1 should be also considered as a potential target-site of insecticidal BPUs...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the major}} role of chitin {{biosynthesis}} inhibitors such as benzoylureas (BPUs) {{in the control}} of pests in agricultural and public health for almost four decades, their molecular mode of action (MoA) has in most cases remained elusive. BPUs interfere with chitin biosynthesis and were thought to interact with sulfonylurea receptors that mediate chitin vesicle transport. Here, we uncover a mutation (I 1042 M) in the chitin synthase 1 (CHS 1) gene of BPU-resistant Plutella xylostella at {{the same position as}} the I 1017 F mutation reported in spider mites that confers <b>etoxazole</b> resistance. Using a genome-editing CRISPR/Cas 9 approach coupled with homology-directed repair (HDR) in Drosophila melanogaster, we introduced both substitutions (I 1056 M/F) in the corresponding fly CHS 1 gene (kkv). Homozygous lines bearing either of these mutations were highly resistant to <b>etoxazole</b> and all tested BPUs, as well as buprofezin-an important hemipteran chitin biosynthesis inhibitor. This provides compelling evidence that BPUs, <b>etoxazole,</b> and buprofezin share in fact the same molecular MoA and directly interact with CHS.

40|$|Because of its {{importance}} to the arthropod exoskeleton, chitin biogenesis is an attractive target for pest control. This point is demonstrated by the economically important benzoylurea compounds that are in wide use as highly specific agents to control insect populations. Nevertheless, the target sites of compounds that inhibit chitin biogenesis have remained elusive, likely preventing the full exploitation of the underlying mode of action in pest management. Here, we show that the acaricide <b>etoxazole</b> inhibits chitin biogenesis in Tetranychus urticae (the two-spotted spider mite), an economically important pest. We then developed a population-level bulk segregant mapping method, based on high-throughput genome sequencing, to identify a locus for monogenic, recessive resistance to <b>etoxazole</b> in a field-collected population. As supported by additional genetic studies, including sequencing across multiple resistant strains and genetic complementation tests, we associated a nonsynonymous mutation in the major T. urticae chitin synthase (CHS 1) with resistance. The change is in a C-terminal transmembrane domain of CHS 1 in a highly conserved region that may serve a noncatalytic but essential function. Our finding of a target-site resistance mutation in CHS 1 shows {{that at least one}} highly specific chitin biosynthesis inhibitor acts directly to inhibit chitin synthase. Our work also raises the possibility that other chitin biogenesis inhibitors, such as the benzoylurea compounds, may also act by inhibition of chitin synthases.

40|$|Acaricides {{are one of}} the {{cornerstones}} of {{an efficient}} control program for phytophagous mites. An analysis of the global acaricide market reveals that spider mites such as Tetranychus urticae, Panonychus citri and Panonychus ulmi are by far the most economically important species, representing more than 80 % of the market. Other relevant mite groups are false spider mites (mainly Brevipalpus), rust and gall mites and tarsonemid mites. Acaricides are most frequently used in vegetables and fruits (74 % of the market), including grape vines and citrus. However, their use is increasing in major crops where spider mites are becoming more important, such as soybean, cotton and corn. As revealed by a detailed case study of the Japanese market, major shifts in acaricide use are partially driven by resistance development and the commercial availability of compounds with novel mode of action. The importance of the latter cannot be underestimated, although some compounds are successfully used for more than 30 years. A review of recent developments in mode of action research is presented, as such knowledge is important for devising resistance management programs.

Males were exposed to differently aged residues of eight pesticides. Abamectin, etofenprox, <b>etoxazole,</b> petroleum spray oil, pymetrozine, and pyriproxyfen resulted harmless to Vienna- 8 males. However, fresh residues of chlorpyrifos and spinosad caused high mortalities and had residual effects until 21 and 28 d after treatment, respectively. Following the same method, the lethal effects of chlorpyrifos and spinosad on Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann) wild-type (wt) males were determined. Surprisingly, these pesticides resulted more toxic for wt than for Vienna- 8 males. To determine whether these results could be attributed to intrinsic characteristics of the pesticides or to behavioral differences among Vienna- 8 and wt males, a topical application trial was conducted. Vienna- 8 males were twice as susceptible to chlorpyrifos as wt males, whereas their susceptibility to spinosad was slightly lower. These results in intrinsic toxicity did not directly explain the differences observed in the extended-laboratory tests with these pesticides. We hypothesize that the lower flight activity of Vienna- 8 males relative to wt conspecifics can explain the lower risk observed for Vienna- 8 males in the residual tests.

40|$|The two-spotted {{spider mite}} (Tetranychus urticae) is a global and {{important}} crop pest that is mainly controlled by acaricides. Its rapid development, high fecundity and haplo-diploid reproduction all contribute to the fast development of resistance. Resistance to acaricides can arise due to modification of the target site or by an increased detoxification. Recently, the complete genome of T. urticae was sequenced and used in this work to develop innovative techniques to study resistance in spider mites. First, using high-throughput sequencing, we developed a bulk segregant mapping method which allowed us to map resistance genes in high resolution. We uncovered that the resistance locus for the mite growth inhibitors <b>etoxazole,</b> hexythiazox and clofentezine maps to a small genomic region coinciding with the chitin synthase- 1 (CHS- 1) gene. Based on additional genetic and biochemical investigations, we reveal that a point mutation in CHS- 1 confers strong resistance, hereby also elucidating the mode of action of an important class of acaricides. Second, we used a gene expression microarray to compare gene expression levels of susceptible and resistant mites on a genome-wide basis. We investigated resistance to the tetronic acid derivate spirodiclofen, a recently commercialized acaricide. Gene expression data of genetically distinct resistant strains revealed that {{the expression of a}} number of detoxification genes was greatly increased.

40|$|The two-spotted {{spider mite}} Tetranychus urticae is an {{economically}} important pest in many agricultural crops worldwide. Its high reproductive potential and extremely short life cycle, combined with the frequent acaricide applications usually required to maintain the population below economic threshold, facilitates rapid resistance build-up. This {{has led to the}} development of resistance against almost all commercially used compounds. In this study we tried to unravel the mechanisms behind the resistance against a number of acaricides with different mode of action at the toxicological, biochemical, genetic and molecular level. In a first series of experiments, we investigated pyrethroid resistance in Greek T. urticae strains. Combined data from toxicological bioassays and biochemical and synergistic studies indicated that although enhanced P 450 mono-oxygenase activities were associated with resistance, target site insensitivity proved to be the major resistance component. In order to get a better insight in the latter, a 3. 3 kb cDNA fragment of the T. urticae para sodium channel gene encompassing segment 4 of domain II to segment 6 of domain IV was obtained by a degenerate PCR strategy. The T. urticae sequence showed highest identity (56 %) to the scabies mite, Sarcoptes scabiei, and was phylogenetically classified within the divergent group of Arachnida. Comparison of resistant and susceptible strains identified the point mutation F 1538 I in segment 6 of domain III, which is known to confer strong resistance to pyrethroids, along with a second mutation (A 1215 D) in the intracellular linker connecting domains II and III, which still has an unknown role. Also, three alternative splicing variants were identified, of which two correspond to the mutually exclusive k/l exon pair already identified in insects. The mode of inheritance of resistance was confirmed to be almost completely recessive, which is consistent with studies on the target site mechanism for pyrethroids in other organisms. In T. urticae, organophosphate and carbamate resistance is often caused by acetylcholinesterase insensitivity. By combining toxicological, biochemical and molecular data from three reference laboratory and three organophosphate resistant (OP) strains, the AChE 1 mutations associated with resistance in T. urticae were characterised. The resistance ratios of the OP strains varied from 9 to 43 for pirimiphos-methyl, from 78 to 586 for chlorpyrifos, from 8 to 333 for methomyl and from 137 to 4164 for dimethoate. Compared to the reference strains, the insecticide concentration needed to inhibit 50 % of the AChE 1 activity in the OP strains was at least 2. 7, 55, 58 and 31 times higher for the OP pirimiphos-methyl, chlorpyrifos oxon, paraoxon and omethoate respectively, and 87 times higher for the carbamate carbaryl. By comparing the AChE 1 sequence between laboratory and OP strains, four amino acid substitutions were detected: (1) F 331 W which was present in all three OP strains; (2) T 280 A found in the three OP strains but not in all clones; (3) G 328 A, found in two OP strains; (4) A 201 S found in only one OP strain. F 331 W, G 328 A and A 201 S are possibly involved in resistance to organophosphate and carbamate insecticides. These findings were also confirmed by means of a structural model. F 331 W is probably the most important and the most common in T. urticae. It can be easily detected by a diagnostic PCR-RFLP assay developed in this study. We also evaluated the possible antagonism of organophosphate and carbamate insecticides on the toxicity of bifenazate in T. urticae when applied in mixtures. Bifenazate, a new and frequently used carbazate, is a pro-acaricide which needs to be activated by carboxylesterases. Two OP strains were used and several organophosphate (chlorpyrifos, azinphos methyl and phosmet) and carbamate (carbaryl and methomyl) insecticides were evaluated. Mixing chlorpyrifos with bifenazate strongly decreased bifenazate toxicity in both tested strains. However, in the strain with a higher esterase activity, antagonism decreased after 2 days. Of all other tested chemicals, only methomyl displayed an antagonistic effect 1 day after treatment. These findings indicate that mixing organophosphate and carbamate insecticides with bifenazate may inhibit bifenazate efficacy under field conditions, especially when resistant strains are present. Spirodiclofen, a recently developed and commercialized acaricide, is a selective, non-systemic tetronic acid derivative. In order to develop strategies to minimise resistance in the field to spirodiclofen, we selected a T. urticae population for spirodiclofen resistance in the laboratory. This selection yielded a strain with a resistance ratio of 274, determined on the larval stage. This strain was used to determine genetic, toxicological, biochemical and cross-resistance data. The egg stage of the resistant strain remained far more susceptible than the mobile stages. No cross-resistance was found against other acaricides, except for spiromesifen, another tetronic acid derivative. Based on synergist experiments and enzyme assays, it appeared that especially P 450 mono-oxygenases, but also esterases and glutathione-S-transferases, could be involved in the metabolic detoxification of spirodiclofen. Pre-treatment of the resistant females with the synergists PBO or DEF could increase the inhibitory effect of spirodiclofen on reproduction, again demonstrating the possible involvement of mono-oxygenases and esterases. Among the esterases of T. urticae, probably only a few are more expressed in spirodiclofen resistant strains, and these apparently prefer the purpose-designed substrate 1 -naphthyl 2, 2 -dimethylbutyrate. This was also confirmed by separating esterase isozymes by native isoelectric focusing. Because spirodiclofen interferes with lipid biosynthesis, total lipid content was measured in female adults. No significant differences between treated and non-treated female adults were found, both in the susceptible and resistant strain. However, the total lipid content in the resistant females was significantly higher than in susceptible females. The genetic analysis using crossing experiments showed that the resistance is inherited as an intermediate trait under control of more than one gene. Resistance to spirodiclofen in the laboratory selected strain exceeded by far the recommended field rate, showing the capacity for quick resistance development in the field. A good acaricide resistance management programme is necessary to prevent fast resistance build-up in the field. However, without selection pressure, resistance tends to be unstable and can decrease in the presence of susceptible individuals owing to the intermediate, polygenic inheritance mode. No evidence was found to support the existence of other resistance mechanisms, like mutations in the target site (ACCase) or overproduction of the target enzyme. In order to facilitate designing new ACCase inhibitor insecticides and understanding mechanism of resistance to currently used ACCase inhibitors, we tried to clone and express T. urticae ACCase using different expression systems. The most promising results were achieved by a baculovirus expression system and also by heat-shocking Codon Rare E. coli cells with the pET-ACC vector. More efforts should be done to overcome several problems in expressing this enzyme e. g. by optimizing conditions to get higher levels of expression, protein solubility, activity and stability. We also performed a practical screening in Dutch cut rose glasshouses due the fact that growers complained on failing spider mite control. In order to check whether control failure was caused by resistance, the susceptibility of 15 strains, sampled from infested roses, was tested to 11 acaricides: tebufenpyrad, milbemectin, abamectin, cyflumetofen, bifenthrin, spiromesifen, hexythiazox, <b>etoxazole,</b> bifenazate, acequinocyl and chlorpyrifos. Three doses were used to discern between resistance and susceptibility: the recommended field dose (FD), FD/ 5 and FD x 5. Ten of these strains were screened for known resistance mechanism such as elevated detoxifying enzyme activities and previously reported resistance mutations using biochemical and molecular diagnostics. Potential cross-resistance between acaricides was estimated by correlation analysis. The strains showed different levels of resistance to tested acaricides. Twelve out of 15 strains showed resistance against hexythiazox, and 9 out of 15 against bifenthrin and tebufenpyrad. Two strains were found which showed high levels of resistance to most tested insecticides, even against one which has not been registered in Europe. A high correlation was found between some acaricides, e. g. between abamectin and milbemectin. Without selection pressure, resistance seemed to be unstable in most cases, after one year. All field strains had an increased metabolic activity, compared to the susceptible strains. A number of amino acid substitutions known to be involved in resistance to different groups were present in different strains. The best example was the presence of the F 331 W substitution in the acetylcholine esterase, which was present in all field strains tested. The results obtained in this research may all together lead to a better understanding of acaricide resistance in T. urticae, which, in turn, may lead to more efficient resistance management programs...|$|E
