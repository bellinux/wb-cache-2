500|$|It is {{difficult}} to pinpoint the first use of Rule 184 for traffic flow simulation, {{in part because the}} focus of research in this area has been less on achieving the greatest level of mathematical abstraction and more on verisimilitude: even the earlier papers on cellular automaton based traffic flow simulation typically make the model more complex in order to more accurately simulate real traffic. Nevertheless, Rule 184 is fundamental to traffic simulation by cellular automata. , for instance, state that [...] "the basic cellular automaton model describing a one-dimensional traffic flow problem is rule 184." [...] writes [...] "Much work using CA models for traffic is based on this model." [...] Several authors describe one-dimensional models with vehicles moving at multiple speeds; such models degenerate to Rule 184 in the single-speed case. [...] extend the Rule 184 dynamics to two-lane highway traffic with lane changes; their model shares with Rule 184 the property that it is symmetric under simultaneous left-right and 0-1 reversal. [...] describe a two-dimensional city grid model in which the dynamics of individual lanes of traffic is essentially that of Rule 184.

This includes potential dismissal by police and some social services, a lack of support from peers, fear of attracting negative stigma toward the gay community, the impact of HIV/AIDS status in keeping partners together (due to health care insurance/access, or guilt), threat of outing, and encountering supportive services that are targeted, or structured {{for the needs of}} heterosexual women, and may not meet the needs of gay men or lesbians. This service structure can make LGBTQ victims feel even more isolated and misunderstood than they may already because of their minority status. Lehman, however, stated that [...] "due to the limited number of returned responses and non-random sampling methodology the findings of this work are not generalizable beyond the sample" [...] of 32 initial respondents and final 10 who completed the more <b>in-depth</b> <b>survey.</b> Particularly, sexual stressors and HIV/AIDS status have emerged as significant differences in same-sex partner violence.|$|E
