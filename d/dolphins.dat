5|$|Catches in 2007 {{amounted}} to 384 Striped <b>Dolphins,</b> 300 Bottlenose <b>Dolphins,</b> 312 Risso's <b>Dolphins</b> and 243 Southern Short Finned Pilot Whales, {{for a total}} of 1,239 animals. These numbers do not include <b>dolphins</b> or other small whale species killed using various other methods, such as offshore harpoon hunts, in which mainly porpoises are killed. Another 77 Bottlenose <b>Dolphins,</b> 8 Risso <b>Dolphins,</b> 5 Southern Short Finned Pilot Whales were captured for use in the entertainment industry in Japan, China, Korea, and Taiwan. The quota set by the government for the species that were targeted in drive hunts that year allowed for the capture of 685 Striped <b>Dolphins,</b> 1,018 Bottlenose <b>Dolphins,</b> 541 Risso's <b>Dolphins,</b> and 369 Southern Short Finned Pilot Whales. The quota applies to all hunting methods.|$|E
5|$|In Japan, {{the hunting}} {{is done by}} {{a select group of}} {{fishermen}}. When a pod of <b>dolphins</b> has been spotted, they're driven into a bay by the fishermen while banging on metal rods in the water to scare and confuse the <b>dolphins.</b> When the <b>dolphins</b> are in the bay, it is quickly closed off with nets so the <b>dolphins</b> cannot escape. The <b>dolphins</b> are usually not caught and killed immediately, but instead left to calm down over night. The following day, the <b>dolphins</b> are caught one by one and killed.|$|E
5|$|River <b>dolphins</b> {{are a very}} {{widespread}} {{group of}} fully aquatic mammals that reside exclusively in freshwater or brackish water. They are an informal grouping of <b>dolphins,</b> which is a paraphyletic group within the infraorder Cetacea. The river <b>dolphins</b> comprise the extant families Platanistidae (the Indian <b>dolphins),</b> Iniidae (the Amazonian <b>dolphins),</b> and Pontoporiidae (the brackish <b>dolphins).</b> There are five extant species of river <b>dolphins,</b> and two subspecies. River <b>dolphins,</b> alongside other cetaceans, belong to the clade Cetartiodactyla, with even-toed ungulates, and their closest living relatives the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago.|$|E

5000|$|The Indo-Pacific humpbacked <b>dolphin</b> coexists {{over much}} of its range with the Indo-Pacific {{bottlenose}} <b>dolphin,</b> which also lives in coastal areas. [...] It {{has been known to}} associate with the Indo-Pacific bottlenose <b>dolphin.</b> [...] It sometimes forms mixed schools with the Indo-Pacific bottlenose <b>dolphin,</b> at times the Indo-Pacific bottlenose <b>dolphin</b> is aggressive towards the humpbacked <b>dolphin,</b> and is able to dominate the humpbacked <b>dolphin.</b> [...] The Indo-Pacific humpbacked <b>dolphin</b> has been occasionally observed associating with the snubfin <b>dolphin</b> and in these interactions the humpbacked <b>dolphin</b> tends to be the aggressor. [...] Interactions may also occur with the long-snouted spinner <b>dolphin</b> and the finless porpoise.|$|R
5|$|A dolphinarium is an {{aquarium}} for <b>dolphins.</b> The <b>dolphins</b> are usually {{kept in a}} large pool, though occasionally they may be kept in pens in the open sea, either for research or for public performances. Some dolphinariums consist of one pool where <b>dolphins</b> perform for the public, others are part of larger parks, such as marine mammal parks, zoos or theme parks, with other animals and attractions as well.|$|E
5|$|Beluga {{whales are}} the only {{cetacean}} being common around the peninsula. Other <b>dolphins,</b> including Atlantic white-sided <b>dolphins,</b> white-beaked <b>dolphins,</b> and harbor porpoises, as well as large whales, such as bowhead, humpback, blue, and finback, also visit the area.|$|E
5|$|Bottlenose <b>dolphins</b> and California {{sea lions}} {{were used in}} the United States Navy Marine Mammal Program (NMMP) to detect mines, protect ships from enemy {{soldiers}}, and recover objects. The Navy has never trained attack <b>dolphins,</b> as they {{would not be able to}} discern allied soldiers from enemy soldiers. There were five marine mammal teams, each purposed for one of the three tasks: MK4 (<b>dolphins),</b> MK5 (sea lions), MK6 (<b>dolphins</b> and sea lions), MK7 (<b>dolphins),</b> and MK8 (dolphins); MK is short for mark. The dolphin teams were trained to detect and mark mines either attached to the seafloor or floating in the water column, because <b>dolphins</b> can use their echolocative abilities to detect mines. The sea lion team retrieved test equipment such as fake mines or bombs dropped from planes usually out of reach of divers who would have to make multiple dives. MK6 protects harbors and ships from enemy divers, and was operational in the Gulf War and Vietnam War. The <b>dolphins</b> would swim up behind enemy divers and attach a buoy to their air tank, so that they would float to the surface and alert nearby Navy personnel. Sea lions would hand-cuff the enemy, and try to outmaneuver their counter-attacks.|$|E

5|$|Bottlenose <b>dolphins</b> {{conflict}} with small-scale coastal commercial fisheries in some Mediterranean areas. Common bottlenose <b>dolphins</b> are probably attracted to fishing nets because {{they offer a}} concentrated food source.|$|E
5|$|Commercial 'dolphin encounter' {{enterprises}} and tours operate in many countries. The documentary film The Cove documents how <b>dolphins</b> are captured {{and sold to}} some of these enterprises (particularly in Asia) while the remaining pod is slaughtered. In addition to such endeavors, the individuals swim with and surface near surfers at the beach. Bottlenose <b>dolphins</b> perform in many aquaria, generating controversy. Animal welfare activists and certain scientists have claimed that the <b>dolphins</b> do not have adequate space or receive adequate care or stimulation. However, others, notably SeaWorld (backed by different scientists), counter that the <b>dolphins</b> are properly cared for, have lots of environmental stimulation and enjoy interacting with humans.|$|E
5|$|On the Penghu Islands in Taiwan, drive fishing of Bottlenose <b>Dolphins</b> was {{practice}}d until 1990, {{when the}} practice was outlawed by the government. Mainly Indian Ocean Bottlenose <b>Dolphins</b> but also common Bottlenose <b>Dolphins</b> were captured in these hunts.|$|E

5|$|River <b>dolphins</b> are {{not very}} widely distributed; they are all {{restricted}} to certain rivers or deltas. This makes them extremely vulnerable to habitat destruction. River <b>dolphins</b> feed primarily on fish. Male river <b>dolphins</b> typically mate with multiple females every year, but females only mate {{every two to three}} years. Calves are typically born {{in the spring and summer}} months and females bear all the responsibility for raising them. River <b>dolphins</b> produce a variety of vocalizations, usually in the form of clicks and whistles.|$|E
5|$|River <b>dolphins</b> {{are rarely}} kept in captivity; {{breeding}} {{success has been}} poor and the animals often die {{within a few months}} of capture. , there are only three river <b>dolphins</b> in captivity.|$|E
5|$|River <b>dolphins</b> {{are thought}} to have relictual distributions, that is, their {{ancestors}} originally occupied marine habitats, but were then displaced from these habitats by modern dolphin lineages. Many of the morphological similarities and adaptations to freshwater habitats arose due to convergent evolution; thus, a grouping of all river <b>dolphins</b> is paraphyletic. Amazon river <b>dolphins</b> are actually more closely related to oceanic <b>dolphins</b> than to South Asian river <b>dolphins.</b> Isthminia panamensis is an extinct genus and species of river dolphin, living 5.8 to 6.1 million years ago. Its fossils were discovered near Piña, Panama.|$|E

5|$|The Patriots first {{played the}} Miami <b>Dolphins</b> in 1966 in the AFL, when Miami {{was one of}} two {{expansion}} teams to debut that year in that league. The <b>Dolphins</b> dominated the Patriots in the 1970s and 1990s, but the two teams remained competitive with each other for years before the rise of Tom Brady. Brady, however, struggled occasionally against the <b>Dolphins</b> in the 2000s before reasserting dominance in the 2010s. The Patriots and <b>Dolphins</b> are the only two teams in the Super Bowl era to post undefeated regular season records, with Miami going 14-0 in 1972 and the Patriots going 16-0 in 2007.
