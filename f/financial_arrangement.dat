According to The Hollywood Reporter, Universal had sought Herbert Marshall {{for the role of}} Sandor, before casting Pichel. None of them appeared except, after a fashion, Lugosi, {{in the form of a}} wax bust molded in his image for use in Dracula's coffin. Some sources report that Lugosi was paid as much as $4,000 for his abortive involvement, but the only confirmed record of any <b>financial</b> <b>arrangement</b> is a letter in which Lugosi consents to the use of his likeness at no cost to create the wax bust.|$|E
5|$|De Gray's {{ability to}} raise money made him useful to John. In 1213 de Gray mustered 500knights during a period when Philip II was {{threatening}} to invade England, bringing this force over from Ireland along with mounted men-at-arms to support the king in England. In May 1213, John and Innocent finally resolved the dispute over Langton's election to Canterbury, {{and part of the}} settlement was that John gave Ireland and England to Innocent and received them back from the pope, making John a papal vassal. The settlement was sealed with a treaty, to which de Gray was one of the witnesses. After John settled with the papacy, de Gray {{was not included in the}} general pardon, and had to go to Rome to be pardoned. While in that city the bishop was named as one of the guarantors of a new <b>financial</b> <b>arrangement</b> between the king and the pope dealing with feudal payments from England, which lowered the lump sum that had to be paid before Innocent would lift the interdict. After Innocent pardoned de Gray, the pope recommended his election as Bishop of Durham in 1213; but de Gray died during his journey back to England on 18 October 1214, at Saint-Jean-d'Angély in Poitou. He was buried in Norwich Cathedral, but his tomb has not survived.|$|E

25|$|On {{the evening}} of 21 November 2010, the then Taoiseach Brian Cowen {{confirmed}} that Ireland had formally requested financial support from the European Union's European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), a request which was welcomed by the European Central Bank and EU finance ministers. The request was approved in principle by the finance ministers of the eurozone countries in a telephone conference call. Details of the <b>financial</b> <b>arrangement</b> were not immediately agreed upon, and remained to be determined in the following weeks, though the loan {{was believed to be}} in the region of €100billion, of which approximately €8billion was expected to be provided by the United Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|The Prime Minister, Harold Macmillan, {{met with}} the President, Dwight Eisenhower, at Camp David in March 1960, and secured {{permission}} to buy Skybolt without strings attached. In return, the Americans were given permission to base the US Navy's Polaris-equipped ballistic missile submarines at the Holy Loch in Scotland. The <b>financial</b> <b>arrangement</b> was particularly favourable to Britain, as the US was charging only the unit cost of Skybolt, absorbing all {{the research and development}} costs. Mountbatten was disappointed, as was Burke, who now had to face the possible survival of Skybolt at the Pentagon. Exactly what was agreed with regard to Polaris was not clear; the Americans wanted any later offer of Polaris to be as part of a scheme for deployment of NATO MRBMs known as the Multilateral Force. With the Skybolt agreement in hand, the Secretary of State for Defence, Harold Watkinson, announced the cancellation of Blue Streak to the House of Commons on 13 April 1960.|$|E

500|$|Satyajit Ray, {{working as}} a graphic {{designer}} for Signet Press, created the illustrations for a new abridged edition of the book in 1944. At that time, Ray read the unabridged novel; Signet's owner D. K. Gupta told Ray that the abridged version {{would make a great}} film. The idea appealed to Ray, and around 1946–47, when he considered making a film, he turned to Pather Panchali because of certain qualities that [...] "made it a great book: its humanism, its lyricism, and its ring of truth". The author's widow permitted Ray to make a film based on the novel; the agreement was in principle only, and no <b>financial</b> <b>arrangement</b> was made.|$|E

The New York Post reported that according to sources the split was not about [...] "irresolvable personality conflicts" [...] but about the money; a friend of Cornell said, [...] "Chris was unhappy with the <b>financial</b> <b>arrangement</b> within the group—he wrote all the music, yet the other three bandmates took an equal share in the multimillion-dollar publishing rights." ...|$|E
500|$|When Imogen joined Britten, the <b>financial</b> <b>arrangement</b> was vague; Britten {{paid her}} on a {{piecemeal}} basis rather than a regular salary, unaware {{that she had made}} over her rights to her father's estate to her mother and had little money of her own. As a result, she [...] lived very frugally in Aldeburgh, but her commitment to Britten overrode her own physical comfort. For the next dozen years her life was organised around the joint objectives of assisting Britten and developing the Aldeburgh Festival. Although she temporarily put her own compositional ambitions aside, she did not abandon all other activities. She made many choral and vocal arrangements, promoted her father's music, and wrote books, articles and programme notes.|$|E

2500|$|In 1754, Samuel Richardson freely {{distributed}} An Address to the Public {{to protest}} his treatment by Faulkner and other Irish printers. [...] Faulkner had licensed to print Richardson's Clarissa, and he arranged {{to be the}} Irish publisher of Sir Charles Grandison in July 1753. [...] However, by August, Faulkner had received only a few sheets of the first volume, while several other Irish printers were seemingly ready to print large portions of the novel. [...] When Faulkner reported this to Richardson, he accused Faulkner of collusion with the other printers, who had bribed Richardson's workers to acquire proofs of the novel. [...] Faulkner was caught between competing forces. [...] By attempting to reprint texts legitimately, he had set himself against his less scrupulous countrymen, but by sometimes printing without a <b>financial</b> <b>arrangement,</b> he had already marked himself as a pirate.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the winter}} of 1998–99, Hole went on tour to promote Celebrity Skin, joining Marilyn Manson, who was {{promoting}} his album, Mechanical Animals (1998) on the [...] "Beautiful Monsters Tour". The tour turned into a publicity magnet, and Hole {{dropped out of the}} tour nine dates in, due to both the majority of the fans being Manson's, and the 50/50 <b>financial</b> <b>arrangement</b> between the groups, with Hole's production costs being disproportionately less than Manson's. Manson and Love often mocked one another onstage, and Love attacked Manson's stage antics, which included tearing up a Bible during performances: [...] "You know, whenever somebody rips up the Bible in front of 40,000 people, I think it's a big deal," [...] she said during a 1999 interview. Hole officially announced that they would be dropping out of the tour after a poorly received concert at the Rose Garden Arena in Portland, Oregon, which ended with Manson fans booing the band.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} managed care <b>financial</b> <b>arrangement,</b> capitation, places {{healthcare}} providers {{in the role}} of micro-health insurers, assuming the responsibility for managing the unknown future health care costs of their patients. Small insurers, like individual consumers, tend to have annual costs that fluctuate far more than larger insurers. The term [...] "Professional Caregiver Insurance Risk" [...] explains the inefficiencies in health care finance that result when insurance risks are inefficiently transferred to health care providers who are expected to cover such costs in return for their capitation payments. As Cox (2006) demonstrates, providers cannot be adequately compensated for their insurance risks without forcing managed care organizations to become price uncompetitive vis-a-vis risk retaining insurers. Cox (2010) [...] shows that smaller insurers have lower probabilities of modest profits than large insurers, higher probabilities of high losses than large insurers, provide lower benefits to policyholders, and have far higher surplus requirements. All these effects work against the viability of healthcare provider insurance risk assumption.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the age of}} five, Eric {{was sent}} as a day-boy to a convent school in Henley-on-Thames, which Marjorie also attended. It was a Roman Catholic convent run by French Ursuline nuns, who had been exiled from France after {{religious}} education was banned in 1903. His mother wanted {{him to have a}} public school education, but his family could not afford the fees, and he needed to earn a scholarship. Ida Blair's brother Charles Limouzin recommended St Cyprian's School, Eastbourne, East Sussex. Limouzin, who was a proficient golfer, knew of the school and its headmaster through the Royal Eastbourne Golf Club, where he won several competitions in 1903 and 1904. The headmaster undertook to help Blair to win a scholarship, and made a private <b>financial</b> <b>arrangement</b> that allowed Blair's parents to pay only half the normal fees. In September 1911 Eric arrived at St Cyprian's. He boarded at the school for the next five years, returning home only for school holidays. He knew nothing of the reduced fees, although he [...] "soon recognised that he was from a poorer home". Blair hated the school and many years later wrote an essay [...] "Such, Such Were the Joys", published posthumously, based on his time there. At St. Cyprian's, Blair first met Cyril Connolly, who became a writer. Many years later, as the editor of Horizon, Connolly published several of Orwell's essays.|$|E
40|$|This article scrutinizes the {{relationship}} between the CPP and the provinces under the new CPP <b>financial</b> <b>arrangements.</b> It briefly recalls the genesis of the CPP and that of its close relative, the Quebec Pension Plan.

These are contrasted with the new <b>financial</b> <b>arrangements</b> put into effect in January 1987. The conclusion drawn from comparison of these arrangements is that the CPP is {{and will continue to be}} a program intended to serve two quite distinct purposes: paying pensions and raising revenue for provincial governments. Specifically, the effective transfer from the CPP to the provinces is estimated to be about $ 1. 2 billion per year. ...|$|R
