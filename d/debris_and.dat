40|$|The 921 Chi-Chi {{earthquake}}, a 7. 5 M earthquake with center {{located near}} Chi-Chi of Nan Tou County occurred on September 21, 1999 and caused more than 2400 fatalities and totaling {{billions of dollars}} losses due to destruction and damages to private and public buildings, roads, bridges and hydraulic structures in central Taiwan. This 921 Chi-Chi earthquake also triggered close to 26, 000 landslides with a total area of 15, 977 ha and severely disturbed mountain slopes, thus setting the conditions for occurrence of more landslides and other related disasters. Post-earthquake watershed restoration works progressed without disruptions by major typhoon rainstorms until July 29 - 30, 2001 when typhoon Toraji hit eastern and central Taiwan with heavy rainfall having peak hourly intensity exceeding 70 mm/h. This rainstorm caused several major <b>debris</b> flows <b>and</b> <b>debris</b> floods that destroyed or severely damaged dams, roads, bridges, dikes and houses, in addition to causing 103 casualties, 111 missing (presumed dead), 189 injured. This study (1) explores the characteristics <b>and</b> impacts of <b>debris</b> flows/floods <b>and</b> (2) investigates hydrometeorological and land use attributes of <b>debris</b> flows <b>and</b> <b>debris</b> floods associated with this typhoon Toraji in central Taiwan. Debris floods, different from more familiar debris flows, are extreme peak streamflows containing large quantities of muds, rocks <b>and</b> <b>debris</b> normally occurring in third and fourth order watersheds. Data analysis and field investigations revealed that the disastrous <b>debris</b> flows <b>and</b> <b>debris</b> floods during typhoon Toraji were essentially caused by very heavy rainfalls on inherently unstable mountain slopes that were loosened further earlier by the 921 Chi-Chi earthquake. The extremely intense rainfall of typhoon Toraji provided not only additional materials by creating new and reactivating or enlarging old landslides but also high peak stream flows required for occurrence of <b>debris</b> flows <b>and</b> <b>debris</b> floods. The destruction and damaging power of <b>debris</b> flows <b>and</b> <b>debris</b> floods witnessed during typhoon Toraji suggests that the effectiveness of engineering structures for disaster prevention is limited. For disaster mitigation, it is required to have more comprehensive strategies such as (1) land use zoning that regulates and restricts human encroachment on hazardous areas and (2) implementation of evacuation drills and relocation plan for people currently living in the hazardous zones.

40|$|Around 16 % of the solar-like {{stars in}} our {{neighbourhood}} show IR-excesses due to <b>debris</b> discs <b>and</b> {{a fraction of}} them are known to host planets. We aim to determine in a homogeneous way the metallicity of a sample of stars with known <b>debris</b> discs <b>and</b> planets. Our analysis includes the calculation of the fundamental stellar parameters by applying the iron ionisation equilibrium conditions to several isolated Fe I and Fe II lines. The metallicity distributions of the different stellar samples {{suggest that there is}} a transition toward higher metallicities from stars with neither debris discs nor planets to stars hosting giant planets. Stars with <b>debris</b> discs <b>and</b> stars with neither debris nor planets follow a similar metallicity distribution, although the distribution of the first ones might be shifted towards higher metallicities. Stars with <b>debris</b> discs <b>and</b> planets have the same metallicity behaviour as stars hosting planets, irrespective of whether the planets are low-mass or gas giants. In the case of <b>debris</b> discs <b>and</b> giant planets, the planets are usually cool, -semimajor axis larger than 0. 1 AU. The data also suggest that stars with <b>debris</b> discs <b>and</b> cool giant planets tend to have a low dust luminosity, and are among the less luminous debris discs known. We also find evidence of an anticorrelation between the luminosity of the dust and the planet eccentricity. Our data show that the presence of planets, not the debris disc, correlates with the stellar metallicity. The results confirm that core-accretion models represent suitable scenarios for <b>debris</b> disc <b>and</b> planet formation. Dynamical instabilities produced by eccentric giant planets could explain the suggested dust luminosity trends observed for stars with <b>debris</b> discs <b>and</b> planets.
