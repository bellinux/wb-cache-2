5|$|Aristotle's {{methods of}} {{observation}} included dissection (Aristotle's lost companion work, The Dissections, contained illustrations of these), so <b>he</b> <b>observed</b> animal anatomy directly, though his {{interpretations of the}} functions of the structures <b>he</b> <b>observed</b> were subject to error. Like other classical authors such as Pliny the Elder, Aristotle also gathered evidence from travellers and people with specialised knowledge, such as fishermen and beekeepers, without much attempt to corroborate what they said.|$|E
5|$|Galileo {{observed}} the planet Saturn, {{and at first}} mistook its rings for planets, thinking it was a three-bodied system. When <b>he</b> <b>observed</b> the planet later, Saturn's rings were directly oriented at Earth, causing him to think {{that two of the}} bodies had disappeared. The rings reappeared when <b>he</b> <b>observed</b> the planet in 1616, further confusing him.|$|E
5|$|Again {{working with}} Johnston, Alvarez's last {{task for the}} Manhattan Project {{was to develop a}} set of {{calibrated}} microphone/transmitters to be parachuted from an aircraft to measure the strength of the blast wave from the atomic explosion, so as to allow the scientists to calculate the bomb's energy. <b>He</b> <b>observed</b> the Trinity nuclear test from a B-29 Superfortress that also carried fellow Project Alberta members Harold Agnew and Deak Parsons.|$|E
2500|$|If type 1 plays U {{and type}} 2 plays D, player 2 will play D' [...] {{whatever}} action <b>he</b> <b>observes,</b> but then type 1 prefers D. The only equilibrium hence is with type 1 playing D, type 2 playing U and player 2 playing U' [...] if <b>he</b> <b>observes</b> D and randomising if <b>he</b> <b>observes</b> U. Through his actions, player 1 has signalled his type to player 2.|$|R

5|$|Dean of Student Affairs Jim Dull {{recognized}} {{a need for}} an official Ramblin' Wreck when <b>he</b> <b>observed</b> the student body's fascination with classic cars. Fraternities, in particular, would parade around their House Wrecks as displays of school spirit and enthusiasm. It was considered {{a rite of passage}} to own a broken down vehicle.|$|E
5|$|Directly {{named for}} Kepler's {{contribution}} to science are Kepler's laws of planetary motion, Kepler's Supernova (Supernova 1604, which <b>he</b> <b>observed</b> and described) and the Kepler Solids, {{a set of}} geometrical constructions, two of which were described by him, and the Kepler conjecture on sphere packing.|$|E

5|$|Galileo {{observed}} the Milky Way, previously {{believed to be}} nebulous, and {{found it to be}} a multitude of stars packed so densely that they appeared from Earth to be clouds. He located many other stars too distant to be visible with the naked eye. <b>He</b> <b>observed</b> the double star Mizar in Ursa Major in 1617.|$|E
5|$|He {{showed that}} {{coloured}} light {{does not change}} its properties by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects, and that regardless of whether reflected, scattered, or transmitted, the light remains the same colour. Thus, <b>he</b> <b>observed</b> that colour {{is the result of}} objects interacting with already-coloured light rather than objects generating the colour themselves. This is known as Newton's theory of colour.|$|E

5|$|In Computer Gaming World, L.S. Lichtmann {{wrote that}} {{development}} of {{some aspects of}} the game was left incomplete. <b>He</b> <b>observed</b> that some promotional screenshots do not resemble anything players encounter in the actual game and that a pamphlet included in the game box lists a large number of differences between what is written in the manual and the actual game mechanics.|$|E
5|$|Marcello Malpighi, {{the father}} of microscopical anatomy, {{discovered}} that plants had tubules similar to those he saw in insects like the silk worm. <b>He</b> <b>observed</b> that when a ring-like portion of bark was removed on a trunk a swelling occurred in the tissues above the ring, and he unmistakably interpreted this as growth stimulated by food {{coming down from the}} leaves, and being captured above the ring.|$|E

Goodrich, an American missionary, {{made the}} first {{recorded}} ascent in a single day; however, a small arrangement of stones <b>he</b> <b>observed</b> suggested {{he was not the}} first human on the summit. He recorded four ecosystems as he travelled from base to summit, and also visited Lake Waiau.|$|E

5|$|The rarer form of Cygnet ("young swan") {{occasionally}} occurs.

5|$|As a showman, Butlin {{quickly became}} successful, one stall {{becoming}} several, and several becoming his own travelling fair. Butlin soon had fixed fairground sites {{as well as}} his travelling fair – the first was at Olympia in London outside Bertram Mills' Circus. In 1925 he opened a set of fairground stalls in Barry Island, Wales where <b>he</b> <b>observed</b> the way landladies in seaside resorts would (sometimes literally) push families out of the lodgings between meals, and began to nurture the idea of a holiday camp similar to the one he had attended whilst an employee at Eatons.|$|E
5|$|Beauchamp rode to Frankfort on business, {{reaching}} it on November 6. Unable to find lodging at {{the local}} inns, he rented {{a room in the}} private residence of Joel Scott, warden of the state penitentiary. Sometime after midnight, Scott heard a commotion from Beauchamp's room. When he investigated, he found the door latch open and the room unoccupied. Beauchamp, clad in a disguise, buried a set of his clothes near the Kentucky River, then proceeded to Sharp's house. Sharp was not at home, but Beauchamp soon found him at a local hotel. He returned to Sharp's house, concealed himself nearby, and waited for Sharp's return. <b>He</b> <b>observed</b> Sharp re-enter the house about midnight.|$|E
