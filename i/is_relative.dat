5|$|Adrastea is the {{smallest}} and second-closest member of the inner Jovian satellite family. It orbits Jupiter at a radius of about 129,000km (1.806Jupiter radii) at the exterior edge of the planet's Main Ring. Adrastea {{is one of only}} three moons in the Solar System known to orbit its planet in less than the length of that planet's day—the other two being Jupiter's innermost moon Metis, and Mars' moon Phobos. The orbit has very small eccentricity and inclination—around 0.0015 and 0.03°, respectively. Inclination <b>is</b> <b>relative</b> to the equator of Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|Antibody and antigen {{interact}} by spatial complementarity (lock and key). The molecular forces {{involved in}} the Fab-epitope interaction are weak and non-specific – for example electrostatic forces, hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and van der Waals forces. This means binding between antibody and antigen is reversible, and the antibody's affinity towards an antigen <b>is</b> <b>relative</b> rather than absolute. Relatively weak binding also means {{it is possible for}} an antibody to cross-react with different antigens of different relative affinities.|$|E

25|$|Properly {{handling}} accelerating frames does {{requires some}} care, however. The difference between special and general relativity is that (1) In special relativity, all velocities are relative, but acceleration is absolute. (2) In general relativity, all motion <b>is</b> <b>relative,</b> whether inertial, accelerating, or rotating. To accommodate this difference, general relativity uses curved spacetime.|$|E
25|$|Proteins, unlike nucleic acids, {{can have}} varying charges and complex shapes, {{therefore}} {{they may not}} migrate into the polyacrylamide gel at similar rates, or at all, when placing a negative to positive EMF on the sample. Proteins therefore, are usually denatured {{in the presence of}} a detergent such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) that coats the proteins with a negative charge. Generally, the amount of SDS bound <b>is</b> <b>relative</b> to the size of the protein (usually 1.4g SDS per gram of protein), so that the resulting denatured proteins have an overall negative charge, and all the proteins have a similar charge-to-mass ratio. Since denatured proteins act like long rods instead of having a complex tertiary shape, the rate at which the resulting SDS coated proteins migrate in the gel <b>is</b> <b>relative</b> only to its size and not its charge or shape.|$|E
25|$|Both Plato and Aristotle {{argue against}} some of Protagoras's claims {{regarding}} relativity; however, {{they argue that the}} concept provides Protagoras with too convenient an exemption from his own theory and that relativism is true for him yet false {{for those who do not}} believe it. They claim that by asserting that truth <b>is</b> <b>relative,</b> Protagoras then could say that whatever further theory he proposed must be true.|$|E

The medium size (250 grams) and large size (500 grams) attributes' impact <b>was</b> <b>relative</b> to the small size (125 grams) alternative, which was omitted as well. Respondents were expected to select the lower priced alternative rather than the higher priced one, resulting in a negative price coefficient. STATA 11 econometric software was used to estimate the parameters.|$|R
25|$|In sociology, social {{complexity}} is {{a conceptual}} framework used {{in the analysis of}} society. Contemporary definitions of complexity in the sciences are found in relation to systems theory, in which a phenomenon under study has many parts and many possible arrangements of the relationships between those parts. At the same time, what is complex and what is simple <b>is</b> <b>relative</b> and may change with time.|$|E
25|$|The {{surf zone}} is place of {{convergence}} of multiple waves types creating complex wave patterns. A wave suitable for surfing results from maximum speeds of 5 meters per second. This speed <b>is</b> <b>relative</b> because local onshore winds can cause waves to break. In the surf zone, shallow water waves are carried by global winds {{to the beach}} and interact with local winds to make surfing waves.|$|E
25|$|A {{long bone}} {{is one that}} is {{cylindrical}} in shape, being longer than it is wide. However, the term describes the shape of a bone, not its size which <b>is</b> <b>relative.</b> Long bones are found in the arms (humerus, ulna, radius) and legs (femur, tibia, fibula), {{as well as in the}} fingers (metacarpals, phalanges) and toes (metatarsals, phalanges). Long bones function as levers; they move when muscles contract.They are responsible for the body's height.|$|E

25|$|Relative species {{abundance}} is {{a component}} of biodiversity and refers to how common or rare a species <b>is</b> <b>relative</b> to other species in a defined location or community. Relative abundance is the percent composition of an organism of a particular kind relative to {{the total number of}} organisms in the area. Relative species abundances tend to conform to specific patterns that are among the best-known and most-studied patterns in macroecology.|$|E
25|$|In {{the common}} Mediterranean variant, {{mutations}} decrease {{production of the}} β-chain (β-thalassemia). In α-thalassemia, which is relatively frequent in Africa and several other countries, production of the α-chain of hemoglobin is impaired, and there <b>is</b> <b>relative</b> over-production of the β-chain. Individuals homozygous for β-thalassemia have severe anemia and are unlikely to survive and reproduce, so selection against the gene is strong. Those homozygous for α-thalassemia also suffer from anemia {{and there is some}} degree of selection against the gene.|$|E
25|$|In 1908, Hermann Minkowski {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} a world line of a particle in his model of the cosmos called Minkowski space. The mathematical model of spacetime is an affine geometry equipped with a quadratic form that measures intervals between events. (When the events are connected by light, the interval is zero.) In Minkowski's system, there is a simultaneous hyperplane determined by the quadratic form at each event along a world line. This simultaneous hyperplane depends on the velocity of the particle, and thus <b>is</b> <b>relative</b> to velocity.|$|E

This means that only the relative variations in sea level were compared and not the absolute sea level values.|$|R

25|$|The {{chemical}} isomer {{shift and}} quadrupole splitting are generally evaluated {{with respect to}} a reference material. For example, in iron compounds, the Mössbauer parameters were evaluated using iron foil (thickness less than 40 micrometers). The centroid of the six lines spectrum from metallic iron foil is −0.1mm/s (for Co/Rh source). All shifts in other iron compounds <b>are</b> computed <b>relative</b> to this −0.10mm/s (at room temperature), i.e., in this case isomer shifts <b>are</b> <b>relative</b> to Co/Rh source. In other words, the centre point of the Mössbauer spectrum is zero. The shift values may also <b>be</b> reported <b>relative</b> to 0.0mm/s, here shifts <b>are</b> <b>relative</b> to the iron foil.|$|R
