Nagar, Tambaram, Mudichur, Pallavaram Semmencherry, Alapakkam, Vyasarpadi and Anna Nagar. Sandy areas are found along the river banks and coasts, and include areas such as Tiruvottiyur, George Town, Madhavaram, New Washermanpet, Chepauk, Mylapore, Porur, Adyar, Besant Nagar and Uthandi. In these areas, rainwater runoff percolates quickly through the soil. Areas having hard rock surface include Guindy, Nanganallur, Pallikaranai, Alandur, Jaladampet, Velachery, Adambakkam {{and a part of}} Saidapet and Perungudi. The ground water table in Chennai is at 4-5m below ground in most of the areas, which was considerably improved and maintained through the mandatory rain water <b>harvesting</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

A 700,000 litre rainwater <b>harvesting</b> <b>system</b> has also been installed to reduce the use of mains water. This water will be used for cleaning and washing, as well as toilet flushes. All timber used has been certified by the Forest Stewardship Council as being from a well-managed forest. The roof is made from recycled aluminium instead of virgin materials. The automatic doors at each of the five bus stances open only when a bus arrives, enhancing safety but also retaining heat within the building and avoiding excessive openings of the doors.

25|$|BMRCL, in a {{public-private}} partnership, harvests rainwater {{from the}} viaducts {{on the rail}} system. The private partner, Karnataka Rural Infrastructure Development (KRIDL), collects the water at multiple points, treats it, and sells it in bulk as potable water. Pipes inside each metro viaduct pillar carry the rainwater from the viaduct down to underground tanks located beneath the median. When these tanks overflow, the water is diverted to 5 metre deep rainwater harvesting pits. Two rainwater harvesting pits are installed between each pillar. The average distance between two pillars is 28 meters. As of March 2017, a 33.48km of elevated metro are covered by the rainwater <b>harvesting</b> <b>system.</b> With the completion of Phase 2 of the metro, the BMRCL will cover a total of 58km with rainwater harvesting systems.

25|$|Restoration {{work by the}} Aga Khan Trust for Culture (AKTC), in {{collaboration}} with Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), began around 1999 after research work, which started in 1997, and was completed in March 2003. Around 12 hectares of lawns were replanted, and over 2500 trees and plants, including mango, lemon, neem, hibiscus and jasmine cuttings, were planted in the gardens. Installation of a new water circulation system for the walkway channels was also undertaken. To ensure that water flowed naturally through the channels and pools on the 12-hectare (30 acre) site {{without the aid of}} hydraulic systems, the water channels were re-laid to an exacting grade of one centimetre every 40 metres (1:4000 slope). This eventually enabled water to flow through the watercourses in the gardens, and dormant fountains to start functioning once again. Other tasks in this mammoth restoration project included setting up a rainwater <b>harvesting</b> <b>system</b> using 128 ground water recharge pits, and desilting and revitalising old wells that were discovered during the restoration work. This was first a privately funded collaborative effort {{under the aegis of the}} National Cultural Fund (NCF) by the ASI. Funding included a sum of $650,000 from the Aga Khan Trust for Culture of His Highness the Aga Khan, with help from the Oberoi Hotels Group. In addition, AKTC is conducting a more significant restoration at Babur's tomb, the resting place of Humayun's father in Kabul.|$|E

Water reuse is a critical part of water management, and because there is a set amount of water, deciding how and when water is reused will be a continuing and necessary debate. A 2016 National Academy of Sciences report on graywater, a hotly argued form of reuse, identifies several areas on needed research including assessing regulatory innovations to increase onsite water use, understanding how water <b>harvesting</b> <b>systems</b> affect water use behavior, assessing user knowledge of water <b>harvesting</b> <b>systems,</b> and further understanding the extent that best management practices are practiced.

2500|$|The use of {{piezoelectric}} {{materials to}} harvest power has already become popular. Piezoelectric materials {{have the ability}} to transform mechanical strain energy into electrical charge. Piezo elements are being embedded in walkways to recover the [...] "people energy" [...] of footsteps. They can also be embedded in shoes to recover [...] "walking energy". Researchers at MIT developed the first micro-scale piezoelectric energy harvester using thin film PZT in 2005. Arman Hajati and Sang-Gook Kim invented the Ultra Wide-Bandwidth micro-scale piezoelectric energy harvesting device by exploiting the nonlinear stiffness of a doubly clamped microelectromechanical systems (MEMSs) resonator. The stretching strain in a doubly clamped beam shows a nonlinear stiffness, which provides a passive feedback and results in amplitude-stiffened Duffing mode resonance. [...] Typically, piezoelectric cantilevers are adopted for the above-mentioned energy <b>harvesting</b> <b>system.</b> [...] One drawback is that the piezoelectric cantilever has gradient strain distribution, i.e., the piezoelectric transducer is not fully utilized. [...] To address this issue, triangle shaped and L-shaped cantilever are proposed for uniform strain distribution.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the influence of cutting frequency, harvest season and nitrogen fertilization on yield and floristic composition of the herbage harvested from a mountain meadow. The meadow was divided into 22 plots, each receiving a different N P K fertilization treatment. The study lasted seven years, and during the first three years (1985 - 1987) each plot was harvested twice per year (June and September) according to a traditional <b>harvest</b> <b>system,</b> whereas in the years 1989 - 1991 each plot was harvested three times per year (spring, summer and autumn) following a more intensive <b>harvest</b> <b>system.</b> Nitrogen fertilizer favoured the development of the grasses in spring, thus reducing the proportion of legumes in the two cut <b>harvest</b> <b>system,</b> whereas grasses reached an advanced stage of maturity before the first cut in late June. However, the three cut <b>harvest</b> <b>system</b> entailed an earlier first cut in spring. As a result, the production of legume biomass was significantly increased both in the first cut and in the subsequent regrowths. No significant response in total herbage production to the N fertilizer was observed in the more intensive <b>harvest</b> <b>system.</b> Therefore, the three cut <b>harvest</b> <b>system</b> without nitrogen fertilization seemed to be the most suitable practice for the management of these botanically-complex mountain meadows. These results may contribute to design fertilization and management practices of mountain hay meadows to optimize their productivity and sustainability...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} was to quantify the relationship of logging production and costs with associated residual stand damage during a commercial thinning operation. Investigated in the study were four ground-based <b>harvesting</b> <b>systems</b> and two different harvest unit layout methods. The <b>harvest</b> <b>systems</b> encompassed a variety of equipment and mechanization levels ranging from mechanized felling and bunching with grapple skidders to manual felling, limbing, and bucking using a rubber-tired skidder equipped with a winch line.
