[...] However it does make subtle use of synths and electronic sounds. Musically and lyrically, it is influenced by Contemporary Christian music, and has a gospel feel, while including standard pop and R. The song opens with Bieber singing, [...] "And I pray" [...] over a keyboard, while the song's chorus repeats one simple refrain, [...] "I close my eyes and I can see a better day/ <b>I</b> <b>close</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> and pray." [...] In the lyrics, Bieber [...] "recognizes the pain and suffering in the world" [...] and then offers [...] "a passive solution" [...] through lines such as [...] "Children are crying / soldiers are dying / Some people don't have a home," [...] before compromising, [...] "I know there's sunshine beyond that rain / good times beyond that pain." [...] Vocally, Bieber's vocals are sung in a lower key compared to previous singles.|$|E

They lived next door to Mary Albert's brother Ike and his two sons. After {{dropping out of the}} Fisk School in 1912, Armstrong joined a quartet of boys who sang in the streets for money. He also started to get into trouble. Cornet player Bunk Johnson said he taught Armstrong (then 11) to play by ear at Dago Tony's Tonk in New Orleans, although in his later years Armstrong gave the credit to Oliver. Armstrong hardly looked back at his youth as the worst of times but drew inspiration from it instead: [...] "Every time <b>I</b> <b>close</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> blowing that trumpet of mineâ€”I look right in the heart of good old New Orleans...

60|$|In {{one corner}} of the cabin was a {{platform}} of poles, covered with straw. I threw the sleeping-bag on this, and was soon stretched out. Misgivings as to my strength worried me before <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes.</b> Once on <b>my</b> back, I felt I could not rise; my chest was sore; my cough deep and rasping.

I can see his features in detail--and the result is (though I won't own it to any of them) that I find my idea of him in the days of my blindness--oh, so unlike the reality! The one thing that is not a disappointment to me, is his voice. When he cannot see me, <b>I</b> <b>close</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> and let my ears feel the old charm again--so far.|$|E

And now suddenly my life seems upside down. I feel as though, if Henry stood before me now, I would strike him on the cheek. I feel sore all over, and ashamed, but I don't know whether I have ceased to love him. I can't tell. Nothing seems to help me. <b>I</b> <b>close</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> and I {{try to think of}} that new world and that new life, and I know that there is nothing repulsive in it.

All the time I am in the streets I am looking at the buildings, and, Burton, this is the extraordinary part of it, I know no more about architecture than a babe unborn, and yet I can tell you where they're wrong, every one of them.

60|$|He {{sighed and}} I left {{him to his}} immobility. His hold on life was as slender as his hold on sanity. I was oppressed by my lonely responsibilities.

6000|$|Now {{of all the}} maidens who dwelt {{in those}} parts there was one who was so {{superior}} in beauty and in charm that {{she seemed to be}} very specially marked out for me. Her name was Marie Ravon, and her people, the Ravons, were of yeoman stock who had farmed their own land in those parts since the days when Duke William went to England. If <b>I</b> <b>close</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> now, I see her as she then was, her cheeks, dusky like moss roses; her hazel eyes, so gentle and yet so full of spirit; her hair of that deepest black which goes most fitly with poetry and with passion; her finger as supple as a young birch tree in the wind. Ah! how she swayed away from me when first I laid my arm round it, for she was full of fire and pride, ever evading, ever resisting, fighting to the last that her surrender might be the more sweet. Out of a hundred and forty women--But who can compare where all are so near perfection! ...|$|E
6000|$|There {{was another}} {{result of my}} having unburdened my heart to my mother. She had been startled at the poignancy of the feeling I had displayed, and, greatly blaming herself for having left me too long in that ignorant state, began to give me {{religious}} instruction. It was too early, since at that age {{it was not possible}} for me to rise to the conception of an immaterial world. That power, I imagine, comes later to the normal child at the age of ten or twelve. To tell him when he is five or six or seven that God is in all places at once and sees all things, only produces the idea of a wonderfully active and quick- sighted person, with eyes like a bird's, able to see what is going on all round. A short time ago I read an anecdote of a little girl who, on being put to bed by her mother, was told not to be afraid in the dark, since God would be there to watch and guard her while she slept. Then, taking the candle, the mother went downstairs; but presently her little girl came down too, in her nightdress, and, when questioned, replied, [...] "I'm going to stay down here in the light, mummy, and you can go up to my room and sit with God." [...] My own idea of God at that time was no higher. I would lie awake thinking of him there in the room, puzzling over the question as to how he could attend to all his numerous affairs and spend so much time looking after me. Lying with my eyes open, I could see nothing in the dark; still, I knew he was there, because I had been told so, and this troubled me. But no sooner would <b>I</b> <b>close</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> than his image would appear standing at a distance of three or four feet from the head of the bed, {{in the form of a}} column five feet high or so and about four feet in circumference. The colour was blue, but varied in depth and intensity; on some nights it was sky-blue, but usually of a deeper shade, a pure, soft, beautiful blue like that of the morning-glory or wild geranium.|$|E
6000|$|I come now, {{though not}} quite {{in the order}} of time, to the noblest of all these enthusiasms--namely, my devotion for the {{writings}} of Lyof Tolstoy. I should wish to speak of him with his own incomparable truth, yet I {{do not know how to}} give a notion of his influence without the effect of exaggeration. As much as one merely human being can help another I believe that he has helped me; he has not influenced me in aesthetics only, but in ethics, too, so that I can never again see life in the way I saw it before I knew him. Tolstoy awakens in his reader the will to be a man; not effectively, not spectacularly, but simply, really. He leads you back to the only true ideal, away from that false standard of the gentleman, to the Man who sought not to be distinguished from other men, but identified with them, to that Presence in which the finest gentleman shows his alloy of vanity, and the greatest genius shrinks to the measure of his miserable egotism. I learned from Tolstoy to try character and motive by no other test, and though I am perpetually false to that sublime ideal myself, still the ideal remains with me, to make me ashamed that I am not true to it. Tolstoy gave me heart to hope that the world may yet be made over in the image of Him who died for it, when all Caesars things shall be finally rendered unto Caesar, and men shall come into their own, into the right to labor and the right to enjoy the fruits of their labor, each one master of himself and servant to every other. He taught me to see life not as a chase of a forever impossible personal happiness, but as a field for endeavor towards the happiness of the whole human family; and I can never lose this vision, however <b>I</b> <b>close</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> and strive to see my own interest as the highest good. He gave me new criterions, new principles, which, after all, were those that are taught us in our earliest childhood, before we have come to the evil wisdom of the world. As I read his different ethical books, 'What to Do,' 'My Confession,' and 'My Religion,' I recognized their truth with a rapture such as I have known in no other reading, and I rendered them my allegiance, heart and soul, with whatever sickness of the one and despair of the other. They have it yet, and I believe they will have it while I live. It is with inexpressible astonishment that I bear them attainted of pessimism, as if the teaching of a man whose ideal was simple goodness must mean the prevalence of evil. The way he showed me seemed indeed impossible to my will, but to my conscience it was and is the only possible way. If there, is any point on which he has not convinced my reason it is that of our ability to walk this narrow way alone. Even there he is logical, but as Zola subtly distinguishes in speaking of Tolstoy's essay on [...] "Money," [...] he is not reasonable. Solitude enfeebles and palsies, and it is as comrades and brothers that men must save the world from itself, rather than themselves from the world. It was so the earliest Christians, who had all things common, understood the life of Christ, and I believe that the latest will understand it so.|$|E
