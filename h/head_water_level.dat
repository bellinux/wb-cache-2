The verification of the effectiveness of theoretical equations and its coefficients is vital for adequate prediction of the effect on areas surrounding a culvert structure. There are numerous theoretical culvert equations that reflect culvert hydraulics. This research report will focus on the verification of three theoretical culvert equations used in the industry, as well as a study of application of two hydraulic programs. The culvert system can function under two hydraulic controls. This study is focused on the culvert system under inlet control and covers analysis of rectangular and square portal frame culverts. The study will involve building a physical model and obtaining/gathering data for theoretical, physical, and software model comparison of culvert hydraulics. The results of the study produce a number of discharge rating curves/performance curves for the culvert system; to aid in verification process.

Mike 11 offers the possibility of based upon twenty years observed rainfall data (main <b>head</b> catchments) and <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> data of the Vidaa River mouth dam, setting up a model to auto calibrate and evaluate the Manning Coefficients (M) and the <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> around the Vidaa course. To estimate flood, stochastic weather generator is going to be used. Through observed rainfall time series, RainSim will analyse, fit, and simulate to obtain synthetic rainfalls time series with different time periods.

50|$|A beaver dam has {{a certain}} amount of {{freeboard}} above the <b>water</b> <b>level.</b> When heavy rains occur, the river or lake fills up and the dam gradually releases the extra stored water. Often this is all that is necessary to reduce the height of the flood wave moving down the river, and will reduce or eliminate damage to human structures. Flood control is achieved in other ways as well. The surface of any stream intersects the surrounding water table. By raising the stream level, the gradient of {{the surface of the water}} table above the beaver dam is reduced, and water near the beaver dam flows more slowly into the stream. This further helps in reducing flood waves, and increases water flow when there is no rain. Beaver dams also smooth out water flow by increasing the area wetted by the stream. This allows more water to seep into the ground where its flow is slowed. This water eventually finds its way back to the stream. Rivers with beaver dams in their <b>head</b> <b>waters</b> have lower high water and higher low <b>water</b> <b>levels.</b>|$|R
40|$|An updated {{ground water}} model of Cache Valley has {{recently}} been created using MODFLOW. Steady-state calibration of the model indicated that subsurface recharge to the lower of two confined aquifers may occur along the bases of the Wellsville Mountains and Bear River Range, and that discharge from the unconfined aquifer overlying the two confined aquifers may occur along the eastern and western margins of the valley in both Utah and Idaho. Two predictive simulations were run with increased pumping from the lower confined aquifer, the first using the average annual precipitation and the second using the lowest annual precipitation from 1984 to 1997. The increased pumping was largely offset {{by an increase in}} subsurface recharge along the eastern margin of the valley for both simulations. Discharge to springs, streams, evapotranspiration and from the unconfined aquifer all remained unchanged during the first simulation, suggesting that the two confining layers separating the unconfined and lower confined aquifers may be an effective barrier to flow, but all discharges decreased during the second simulation, suggesting that droughts may have a greater impact than additional pumping. Recharge to the lower confined aquifer along the western margin of the valley did not increase for either simulation, indicating that true steady-state conditions were not achieved. A sensitivity analysis was performed during steady-state calibration of the model. Altering the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the two confining layers produced the greatest head changes. The hydraulic conductivities of the aquifers produced minimal head changes.

40|$|SummaryStream {{restoration}} aims at an {{enhancement of}} ecological habitats, {{an increase of}} water retention within a landscape and sometimes even at an improvement of biogeochemical functions of lotic ecosystems. For the latter, good exchange between groundwater and stream water is often considered to be of major importance. In this study hydraulic connectivity between river and aquifer was investigated for a four years period, covering the restoration of an old oxbow after the second year. The oxbow became reconnected to the stream and the clogging layer in the oxbow was excavated. We expected increasing hydraulic connectivity between oxbow and aquifer after restoration of the stream, and decreasing hydraulic connectivity for the former shortcut due to increased clogging. To test that hypothesis, the spatial and temporal characteristics of the coupled groundwater-stream water system {{before and after the}} restoration were analysed by principal component analyses of time series of groundwater <b>heads</b> and stream <b>water</b> <b>levels.</b> The first component depicted between 53 % and 70 % of the total variance in the dataset for the different years. It captured the propagation of the pressure signal induced by stream <b>water</b> <b>level</b> fluctuations throughout the adjacent aquifer. Thus it {{could be used as a}} measure of hydraulic connectivity between stream and aquifer. During the first year, the impact of stream <b>water</b> <b>level</b> fluctuations decreased with distance from the regulated river (shortcut), whereas the hydraulic connection of the oxbow to the adjacent aquifer was very low. After restoration of the stream we observed a slight but not significant increase of hydraulic connectivity in the oxbow in the second year after restoration, but no change for the former shortcut. There is some evidence that the pattern of hydraulic connectivity at the study site is by far more determined by the natural heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivities of the floodplain sediments and the initial construction of the shortcut rather than by the clogging layer in the oxbow...|$|R

40|$|Proceedings of the 1999 Georgia Water Resources Conference, March 30 and 31, Athens, Georgia. Ground water {{provides}} {{nearly half}} the freshwater supplies in the Savannah, Georgia, area (excluding thermoelectric use). Concern has been expressed over possible encroachment of saltwater into the Upper Floridan aquifer {{as a result of}} proposed expansion and deepening of Savannah Harbor and the entrance channel. In response to this concern, the U. S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, conducted a study during December 1997 -January 1998, to describe the aquifer interconnection at two well-cluster sites at Fort Pulaski and Tybee Island in eastern Chatham County, Georgia (fig. 1). Aquifers evaluated were the surficial aquifer, low permeability sediments that are stratigraphic equivalents· of the upper Brunswick aquifer, and the Upper and Lower Floridan aquifers. Aquifer interconnection was assessed at two well cluster test sites by comparing <b>head</b> (measured as <b>water</b> <b>level)</b> and water-quality data from the various aquifers. <b>Water</b> <b>levels</b> were measured on January 22, 1998, in three wells at the Fort Pulaski site and in five wells at the Tybee Island site to determine the vertical <b>head</b> gradients. <b>Water</b> <b>levels,</b> corrected for altitude differences between wells, indicate that there is a decrease in hydraulic head with depth at each site, indicating potential downward leakage of <b>water.</b> <b>Water</b> <b>levels</b> in the Upper Floridan aquifer at each site have been lowered because of pumpage from the aquifer in the Savannah area. These lowered <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> have resulted in a downward hydraulic gradient at each site. At Fort Pulaski, there is hydraulic separation between the surficial aquifer and upper Brunswick equivalents, and between the upper Brunswick equivalents and the Upper Floridan aquifer. Hydraulic separation between the surficial aquifer and the underlying upper Brunswick equivalents is indicated by a head difference of 3. 7 feet, and by higher concentrations of dissolved constituents in water from the surficial aquifer and greater hardness of water from the upper Brunswick equivalents. The upper Brunswick equivalents are hydraulically separated from the underlying Upper Floridan aquifer, as indicated by a head difference of 22. 6 feet, and by differences in water chemistry. Water from the upper Brunswick equivalents has higher iron concentrations and is a different water type than water from the Upper Floridan aquifer. Water from the upper Brunswick equivalents is of a sodium chloride type; whereas, water from the Upper Floridan aquifer is a sodium magnesium calcium bicarbonate type. Leakage of water from the upper Brunswick equivalents to the Upper Floridan aquifer at Fort Pulaski is suggested by the low head in the upper Brunswick equivalents; the <b>water</b> <b>level</b> in the upper Brunswick equivalents at Fort Pulaski was 2. 1 feet below sea level on January 22, 1998, suggesting a possible leakage in response to pumping from the Upper Floridan aquifer. At Tybee Island, there is hydraulic separation between the surficial aquifer and upper Brunswick equivalents; the upper Brunswick equivalents and the Upper Floridan aquifers; and the Upper and Lower Floridan aquifers. Hydraulic separation between the surficial aquifer and the underlying upper Brunswick equivalents is indicated by a head difference of 3. 0 feet; however, similar water chemistry suggests mixing of water from the two aquifers. Water from both aquifers is a sodium chloride type containing similar constituent concentrations. Hydraulic separation between the upper Brunswick equivalents and Upper Floridan aquifer is indicated by a head difference of 22. 2 feet, and by differences in water chemistry. Water from the upper Brunswick equivalents has higher constituent concentrations and is a different water type than water from the Upper Floridan aquifer. Water from the upper Brunswick equivalents is a sodium chloride type; whereas, water from the Upper Floridan aquifer is a sodium calcium bicarbonate type. Hydraulic separation between the Upper and Lower Floridan aquifers at Tybee Island is indicated by a head difference of 4. 1 feet, and by differences in water chemistry. Water from the upper Floridan aquifer is a sodium calcium bicarbonate type and contains lower constituent concentration; whereas, water from the Lower Floridan aquifer is a mixed type and contains higher constituent concentrations. Results of this study will help to assess the degree of aquifer interconnection and potential for saltwater encroachment in the vicinity of Savannah Harbor and the entrance channel, as part of an ongoing assessment by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers on the possible effects of channel dredging on ground-water resources in the Savannah area. Sponsored and Organized by: U. S.

This theory is utilized to develop a procedure for transforming model-generated <b>water</b> <b>level</b> responses to transducer readings. The magnitude of the difference between the actual <b>water</b> <b>level</b> position and the apparent position based on the transducer measurement is a function of the acceleration and velocity of the water column, test geometry, and depth of the transducer. The dynamic approach explains the entire slug test response, including the often-noted discrepancy between the actual initial <b>water</b> <b>level</b> displacement and that measured by a transducer in the water column. Failure to use this approach can lead to a significant underestimation of K when the transducer is a considerable distance below the static <b>water</b> <b>level.</b> Previous investigators have noted a dependence of test responses on the magnitude of the initial <b>water</b> <b>level</b> displacement and have developed various approximate methods for analyzing such data. These methods are re-examined and their limitations clarified. Practical field guidelines are proposed on the basis of findings of this work. The soundness of the dynamic approach is demonstrated through a comparison of K profiles from a series of multilevel slug tests with those from dipole-flow tests performed in the same wells...|$|R
40|$|Overtopping {{and damage}} to sea {{defenses}} {{tends to be}} associated with times of large waves occurring in combination with high <b>water</b> <b>levels.</b> Methods for predicting extremes of either <b>water</b> <b>level</b> or waves are in common use, but assessment of the joint probability of high waves and high <b>water</b> <b>level</b> is more important. The combination of these phenomena leads to extremely high <b>water</b> <b>levels,</b> increasing the risk of coastal flooding. The objective {{of this paper is to}} study the probability of joint occurrences of high waves and high <b>water</b> <b>levels.</b> The in-situ data during typhoons are analyzed. Marginal distributions for wave and <b>water</b> <b>level</b> data during typhoons are examined. Furthermore, the joint probability diagram of waves and <b>water</b> <b>level</b> is presented. Results of design <b>water</b> <b>level</b> from joint probability method (JPM) are compared with traditional empirical design approach by frequency analysis. It is shown that the commonly used empirical method may lead to overestimation of the design <b>water</b> <b>level.</b> 1...|$|R
