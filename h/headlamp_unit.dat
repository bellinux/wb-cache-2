2500|$|... 2008 saw Land Rover's 60th anniversary, {{for which}} {{a new series of}} special edition Defenders were produced. Branded the [...] "SVX", three models were built. All were painted black with [...] "satin" [...] effect body {{graphics}} on the vehicles sides and bonnet carrying the [...] "60th" [...] logo used throughout 2008 at various special events and on anniversary merchandise. Bespoke five-spoke alloy wheels were used and a new silver-coloured front grille design was used. This also incorporated a new design of headlamp with the sidelight lamp being integral with the main <b>headlamp</b> <b>unit,</b> allowing the space previously used for the separate sidelight to be used to fit a pair of high-intensity driving lamps. Inside the SVX models gained Recaro bucket seats in the front row, alloy gearlever knobs and a Garmin GPS navigation system. The drivetrain was the standard 2.4-litre diesel and six-speed manual permanent four-wheel-drive transmission. The SVX edition was available as a 110 (only available outside the UK), a 90 and a brand-new design of 90 soft top- the first time a soft top model had been available through showrooms in the UK since 1992. SVX soft tops had only the two front seats- the rear load bay being used to accommodate the spare wheel and a lockable storage box. A new design of hood was used, sloping down towards the rear over a jointed folding frame, unlike the standard square-framed hood used on other soft top Land Rovers.|$|E
5000|$|The Modus {{was offered}} with a {{cornering}} lamp function. Concealed {{in the main}} <b>headlamp</b> <b>unit</b> and operating at speeds less than 38 mi/h km/h, the lights gave the driver a wider field of vision when going round bends. On Privilège and Initiale models, Renault offered the Modus with [...] "double-distance" [...] Xenon headlamps.|$|E
50|$|During {{the first}} few months of 2004, MG Rover facelifted the design of the ZT and ZT-T to a less retro look, at the same time as the Rover 75 {{received}} a facelift. While the facelift didn't feature any mechanical differences, the changes were merely aesthetic and the main changes to the facelift, included the replacement of the twin headlamps, with a new, clear single <b>headlamp</b> <b>unit.</b>|$|E
50|$|The F103 {{bodyshell}} was {{a development}} of the earlier DKW F102. The engine compartment had to be extended so that the new four-cylinder engine could be accommodated. The front and tail were also cosmetically revised: Audi F103s sold in Europe all featured quasi-rectangular headlamps which were becoming fashionable at the time, whereas the F102 had used round <b>headlamp</b> <b>units.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Lamborghini {{launched}} a facelifted Diablo in 1999, simplifying the model range {{by eliminating the}} [...] "base" [...] Diablo (since the SV model had become the new entry-level trim anyway) and applying universal revisions across the lineup. The most immediately noticeable exterior change was {{the replacement of the}} previous Diablo's pop-up <b>headlamp</b> <b>units</b> with fixed composite lenses, borrowed under license from their original application in the Nissan 300ZX Z32. All Diablos were also fitted with new 18 inch wheels.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} NSX body design {{received only}} minor modifications from Honda {{in the new}} millennium when in December 2001 the original pop-up headlamps were replaced with fixed xenon HID <b>headlamp</b> <b>units,</b> along with slightly wider rear tires to complement a revised suspension. Front spring rates were increased from 3.2 kg/m to 3.5 kg/m, rear spring rates were increased from 3.8 kg/m to 4.0 kg/m and the diameter of the rear stabilizer bar increased from 17.5 mm to 19.1 mm with a 2.3 mm wall thickness.|$|R
50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{widespread}} use of Fresnel lenses, for a time, occurred in automobile headlamps, where they can shape the roughly parallel beam from the parabolic reflector to meet requirements for dipped and main-beam patterns, often both in the same <b>headlamp</b> <b>unit</b> (such as the European H4 design). For reasons of cost, weight, and impact resistance, newer cars have dispensed with glass Fresnel lenses, using multifaceted reflectors with plain polycarbonate lenses. However, Fresnel lenses continue in wide use in automobile tail, marker, and backup lights.|$|E
5000|$|The 306 {{underwent}} {{the only}} major revamp of its life in May 1997, with {{the launch of the}} [...] "Phase 2" [...] version (N5 in Australia). The basic shape remained the same, but lights, grille and bumpers were redesigned in an effort to bring the styling into line with the new, more rounded, Peugeot family look established with the Peugeot 406. Indicator lamps were now incorporated into the <b>headlamp</b> <b>unit</b> and the new style [...] "block filled" [...] Peugeot lion logo was adopted. The Phase 2 also saw the addition of an estate version.|$|E

50|$|In the United States, Federal {{lighting}} regulations required headlamps of {{sealed beam}} construction and standard {{size and shape}} on all vehicles, so Accords in North America were equipped with four rectangular <b>headlamp</b> <b>units</b> rather than the aerodynamic composite replaceable-bulb units used on Accords sold outside North America (note European specification imagery). Other Automotive lighting variations included amber front and red rear side marker lights and reflectors in North America, and headlamp washers and a red rear fog lamp for European markets. Japanese-market Accords were unique from all other markets in that they included adjustable ride height control and side view mirrors installed on the mid-forward fenders.|$|R
5000|$|For the 2007 {{model year}} Lotus several minor changes were made. The LOTUS decals {{on the rear}} of the vehicle, {{previously}} flat stickers, were replaced by raised lettering. The <b>headlamp</b> <b>units</b> were sealed. Also, in order to comply with US Federally mandated bumper restrictions, the frontal crash structure was slightly changed and rear bumperettes were added next to the licence plate mount. Approximately 100 2007 model year [...] "launch" [...] cars were shipped to the US without these bumper changes. Also in 2007, the Elise S was released and the 111R renamed Elise R. All Lotus Elise cars manufactured after 1 January 2007 include the new headlights and 2.5 mi/h km/h bumpers, although they are hidden in the front.|$|R
5000|$|In 1973, Vauxhall {{acknowledged}} that their rather dull model range needed a makeover, {{and developed a}} radical version of the Firenza, known officially as the High Performance (HP) Firenza, but known colloquially as the [...] "droopsnoot" [...] after its dramatically styled aerodynamic nose. The nose was moulded from GRP, and featured two pairs of Cibié headlamps behind toughened glass covers. The overall look was somewhat reminiscent of the Renault Alpine A310, and used the same <b>headlamp</b> <b>units.</b> Several prototypes of the HP Firenza were considered with different types of front end treatment, requiring different degrees of change from the standard production front end, including cars known as Black Knight and Daytona, the latter for its resemblance to the Ferrari Daytona, a favourite of Wayne Cherry.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} intelligentize the LED {{lighting}} systems,this system adopts the Freescale series MC 9 S 08 AC 16 as the controller, senses the light environment {{induced by the}} photoresistor and uses the SS- 101 pyroelectric infrared sensors to sense the presence of people. In addition, it uses LM 3404 chip to drive LED <b>headlamp</b> <b>unit</b> and by changing the duty cycle of PWM to achieve the switches and automatic adjustment of brightness of LED lights. Experiments show that the light source brightness provided by this system is stable and reliable and the combination of infrared sensing technology and PWM technology achieves the intelligence of LED lights. Moreover, it has high application value...|$|E
40|$|Development of TarVIP 1. 0, a {{computer}} model for predicting the detection distances of normal and UV activated pavement markings was recently completed at the Operator Performance Laboratory (OPL). Two Sherwin-Williams UV activated pavement marking samples, four UV headlamp units (Ultralux, Visteon, Cibio and Labino brands), and the UV filter covering the Labino UV <b>headlamp</b> <b>unit</b> were characterized {{in terms of their}} fluorescence coefficients, spectral emissions, and spectral transmissivity, respectively. The TarVIP model properly accounts for a complete three-dimensional representation of the roadway-headlamp-driver geometry. Veiling luminance due to fog is modeled using the Mie Scattering theory. The model consists of physical and human performance subsystems. Besides the aforementioned physical subsystem items, the human performance subsystem uses an extensive human visibility contrast threshold database to represent the human capabilities and limitations of pavement marking detection. The model was used to obtain the visibility distances under various levels of fog density, UV activated pavement marking and UV headlamp efficiencies. The resulting visibility distances show some potential benefits and some inadequacies of the UV headlamps and UV activated pavement markings. The computer model TarVIP was developed to obtain INTRODUCTION estimates of nighttime detection distances for conventiona...|$|E
5000|$|A more {{powerful}} model, the 8 Major (model R1132), {{was released in}} 1964, featuring an 1108 cc engine developing [...] A still {{more powerful}} version, the 8 model R1134 Gordini, was also released that year, with a tuned engine of the same capacity but developing [...] The extra power was obtained by a cross-flow head and twin dual-choke 40mm side-draft Solex carburetors. A four-speed close ratio manual transmission, dual rear shock absorbers and uprated springs were fitted. The R1134 Gordini was originally available only in blue, with two stick-on white stripes. It was also distinguishable from the 8 Major by the bigger 200mm <b>headlamp</b> <b>units.</b> In 1965, the Renault 10 Major, a more luxurious version of the 8 with different front and rear styling, was released, replacing the 8 Major.|$|R
5000|$|In October 1993 the Honda Street's front {{design was}} changed yet again, {{receiving}} larger, more square <b>headlamp</b> <b>units.</b> A PGM-FI version in [...] "Fox" [...] and [...] "Xi" [...] equipment levels was also {{introduced to the}} Street at this time. This version produces [...] The front end changes were applied to the Acty as well, beginning in January 1994. The Acty and the Street were further modified in January 1996 when the turn signals were changed from amber to clear. At this time, the fuel injected Acty SDX-Hi was also introduced - only with two-wheel drive and a five-speed manual - with the same engine as the Street Xi (the Fox was dropped, replaced by the carburetted Street V). Production of the Acty continued until {{the arrival of the}} third generation in 1999, although the Honda Street continued to be built until 2001 as it was only partially replaced by the pricier Honda Vamos.|$|R
5000|$|The Austin 3-Litre is a British {{saloon car}} that was {{introduced}} by Austin at the London Motor Show in 1967. It became apparent that BMC were not geared up to producing the car: few or none {{seem to have been}} sold that year, but by July 1968 it was reported that the cars had begun to leave the factory. By that time the square headlights seen at the 1967 motor show had been replaced by conventional round twin <b>headlamp</b> <b>units,</b> and {{by the time of the}} October 1968 show the car had also acquired front quarter lights. [...] In July 1968, with cars beginning to emerge from the plant, the manufacturers were asked to detail improvements reportedly implemented since the car's [...] "launch" [...] the previous October. Mention was made of orifice modifications to hydraulic valves in the rear suspension, and it was stated that there was a [...] "new" [...] final drive ratio of 3.9:1, though this was actually the same final drive ratio included in the launch information the previous October.|$|R
50|$|The {{rebodied}} R20/R30 {{was introduced}} in January 1992 and produced until September 1996. For this series, the mechanicals were largely carried over (hence the retention of the R20/R30 chassis codes), but the styling fully refreshed. At this time, the LiteAce van became a derivative of the TownAce line, sharing the latter's body work. Thus, from this time, the entire LiteAce and TownAce range (van and truck) were unified. The rebodied R20/R30 had a much more streamlined design. The LiteAce and TownAce commercial vans were very similar, differing by the TownAce receiving extra headlamps adjacent inside to the main units and a small air intake slit. The LiteAce did not have this intake, but instead had additional grilles where the extra lamps in the TownAce were. Passenger wagons of both models had different styling again. Here, the LiteAce front end featured two separate <b>headlamp</b> <b>units</b> that tapered inwards towards the Toyota logo. TownAce wagons had headlamps that sat flush with a translucent garnish that gave {{the appearance of a}} large, single headlamp. Rear styling also differed between the commercial vans and passenger wagons, although both models used the same rear-end regardless if badged LiteAce or TownAce.|$|R
50|$|The <b>headlamps</b> are bi-xenon <b>units</b> with LED DRLS {{shaped like}} eyebrows. Foils are added {{at the back}} to boost air intake to {{complement}} a single air vent located on top. The vehicle also has a long low bonnet that dips in the middle to emphasize the DC logo.|$|R
2500|$|In May 1956, the Mark C was {{discontinued}} and the Mark D introduced. The changes {{between the}} last Mark Cs and the Mark D are, like those between the final Mark As and the Mark B, almost entirely {{hidden from view}} and the cars are externally identical. Beneath the Mark D bonnet however, Villiers had substantially upgraded the [...] engine, which now became the Mark 9E. The main changes were a 4-plate clutch, a heavier final drive chain with simplified adjustment and a higher top-gear ratio. The 9E was said to produce a 12½ per cent increase in power over the 8E, providing a claimed [...] at 4,000rpm. This increased the cruising speed to around , with {{a top speed of}} [...] Electrics were upgraded from 6 volt to 12 volt, allowing more powerful headlights with separate side-lights within the <b>headlamp</b> <b>units.</b> All Deluxe models include the SIBA Dynastart. Other changes which had been gradually introduced onto Mark Cs over the years, were carried over to the Mark D. This included items such as strengthened rear suspension, chrome side flashes on the front wings of Deluxe models and larger rear lights with integrated rear reflectors.

5000|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1999, Nissan gave the Primera a facelift, giving it a more modern front end with clear style <b>headlamps</b> {{featuring}} projector <b>units,</b> instead of the traditional Fresnel lens type. Nissan also introduced their [...] "corporate identity" [...] front, with the [...] "flying wing" [...] grille. The new code name for this model was [...] "P11-144".|$|R
50|$|The G-Wagen was facelifted in 1990. In 1989, for the 10th {{anniversary of}} the G Model, a new model variant with {{permanent}} 4-wheel drive, a wood-trimmed interior and optional Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) debuted at the Frankfurt International Motor Show. Production began the following April. For 1992, a new sub-series for professional users began production. The civilian model began to offer cruise control, a stainless-steel spare-tire cover, running boards and Burl Walnut wood interior trim. The same year, the 100,000th G Model was built in Graz. In 1994, the model line was officially renamed the G-Class. Ventilated front disc brakes and a driver’s air bag became standard. In 1996 the automatic transmission became an electronically controlled 5-speed <b>unit.</b> <b>Headlamp</b> washers, cruise control and a front passenger’s air bag were added. In 1998, the range-topping G 500 with a 296 hp V 8 was introduced for series production.|$|R
