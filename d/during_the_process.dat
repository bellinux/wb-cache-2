5|$|Die casting is a {{metal casting}} {{process that is}} {{characterized}} by forcing molten metal under high pressure into a mold cavity.

5|$|A {{series of}} reports {{in the summer of}} 1944 {{produced}} by Bomber Command's operational research division attempted to explain these differences, starting with problems in the bombsight itself. However, almost all of the reasons ultimately offered were purely operational in nature.

5|$|All LDL {{receptor}} family proteins {{contain a}} cytoplasmic tail {{with at least}} one NPXY motif. This motif is important for binding intracellular adapter proteins and endocytosis. ApoER2 is distinct from most other members of the LDL family of receptors due to a unique insert on its cytoplasmic tail. In ApoER2, there is a proline-rich 59 amino acid insert encoded by the alternatively spliced exon 19. This insert allows for protein interactions that are unable to occur with other LDL receptors. It binds the PSD-95 adapter protein, cross-linking ApoER2 and the NMDA receptors <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of long-term potentiation, and is also bound specifically by JIP-2, an important interaction in the JNK signalling pathway. It is also speculated that this insert may diminish the function of ApoER2 in lipoprotein endocytosis by somehow disrupting the NPXY motif.|$|E

However, the Hornets also announced that they {{were in the process of}} negotiating with Oklahoma City to play the 2007–08 season at the Ford Center as a contingency plan. The Hornets opened the 200607 season at New Orleans with a win over the Boston Celtics. They improved their final record from the previous season by one game, and again finished tenth in the Western Conference, three games out of the playoffs. Their attendance declined slightly compared to the previous season, and they finished 15th overall in attendance.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the period of the wars of {{independence}} itself was marked by a rapid expansion of representative government, for several of the new nations the nineteenth century was marked by militarism {{because of the lack of}} well-defined political and national institutions. The armies and officers that came into existence <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of independence wanted to ensure that they got their rewards once the struggle was over. Many of these armies did not fully disband once the wars were over and they proved to be one of the stabler institutions in the first decades of national existence. These armies and their leaders effectively influenced the course of political development. Out of this new tradition came the caudillos, strongmen who amassed formal and informal economic, military and political power in themselves.|$|E
5|$|During the eight-month period, Beyoncé {{recorded}} over seventy {{songs and}} decided during the editing process {{that she did}} not want to reconcile the two approaches into one disc.

After a process of elimination, twelve tracks were selected to be placed on the standard edition of the album, while five additional tracks were chosen to make the final cut for the deluxe edition of the album. Beyoncé later revealed that songs from established producers like The Neptunes and Danja were not able to make the final cut.|$|E
5|$|<b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of {{catching}} the commercialized fish, the Amazon river dolphins {{get caught in}} the nets and exhaust themselves until they die, or the local fishermen deliberately kill the dolphins that become entangled in their nets. The carcasses are discarded, consumed, or used as bait to attract a scavenger catfish, the piracatinga (Calophysus macropterus). The use of the Amazon river dolphin carcass as bait for the piracatinga dates back from 2000. The increasing consumption demand by the local inhabitants and Colombia for the piracatinga has created a market for distribution of the Amazon river dolphin carcasses to be used as bait throughout these regions.|$|E

30|$|Figure  2 (a) {{shows the}} {{characteristics}} of damping hysteresis <b>during</b> <b>the</b> contact <b>process.</b> <b>The</b> damping of the material will cause a loss of energy, and the restitution coefficient will be smaller, whereas the loss of energy <b>during</b> <b>the</b> contact <b>process</b> will be larger. The modified contact force model {{presented in this paper}} can better describe the loss of energy <b>during</b> <b>the</b> contact <b>process</b> when <b>the</b> restitution coefficient is small.

The film was a success, being the tenth highest-grossing film of 1961 with rentals of $6.4 million.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present the denotational {{semantics}} for channel mobility in the Unifying Theories of Programming (UTP) semantics framework. The {{basis for the}} model is the UTP theory of reactive <b>processes</b> (precisely, <b>the</b> UTP semantics for Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP)), which is slightly extended to allow the mobility of channels: the set of actions in which a process is authorised to participate, originally static or constant (set <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>process's</b> definition), is now made dynamic or variable: it can change <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>process's</b> execution.

New healthiness conditions are stated to ensure an appropriate use of mobile channels...|$|R
