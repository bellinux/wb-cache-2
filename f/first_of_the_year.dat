5|$|Veteran quarterback Bill Kenney, {{making the}} {{start for the}} Kansas City Chiefs {{in place of the}} {{struggling}} Todd Blackledge, completed 15 of 29 passes for 230 yards and a touchdown. The Chiefs' offensive line protected Kenney well, allowing only one sack and few hurries. Although the Buccaneers led at halftime on a 10-yard pass from Steve Young to Calvin Magee and two Donald Igwebuike field goals, they were unable to hold the lead in the second half. They tied the game at 20 on a fourth-quarter touchdown run, James Wilder's <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year,</b> but immediately allowed the Chiefs to drive the length of the field for the winning touchdown. The sloppily played game included four fumbles, six sacks, two interceptions, and 17 penalties for 146 yards. Art Still contributed three of the Chiefs' five sacks.|$|E
5|$|Intensification {{was more}} gradual {{following}} April9. At 0000UTC on April11, the JMA upgraded {{the system to}} tropical storm intensity, thus identifying it with the name Kujira. At roughly the same time, Kujira began to curve towards a westward track due to a high pressure area to the north. Concurrently the ambient wind shear abated and the storm further consolidated, allowing for more quicker strengthening. Throughout the following day, Kujira developed a banding eye feature that would later consolidate into a distinct circular eye; this was reflected with an upgrade to typhoon status by both the JTWC and JMA at 1800UTC on April12 and 0000UTC on April14, respectively. On April14, a shortwave trough caused Kujira to track slightly more northwestward. Marked intensification continued, and late on April15, the JTWC upgraded the typhoon to super typhoon intensity, the <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year,</b> while Kujira was located 400km (250mi) north-northwest of Yap State. At roughly the same time Kujira reached its peak intensity with winds of 165km/h (105mph). Estimated 1-minute sustained winds at that time were 250km/h (155mph), equivalent {{to that of a}} Category4 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson wind scale. Following peak intensity, Kujira continued to track westward as it entered the area of responsibility of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration(PAGASA) at 1200UTC on April16, and as such the name Amang was assigned to the typhoon by the agency.|$|E

25|$|At Wimbledon, Janković {{defeated}} sixth-seeded {{and defending}} champion Venus Williams {{in the third}} round in three sets. Competing in the fourth round of a Grand Slam event for the first time, she lost to ninth-seeded Anastasia Myskina. In August, Janković reached her fifth career final and <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> at the JPMorgan Chase Open in Los Angeles, defeating Serena Williams (ranked world no. 108 at the time after a lengthy injury lay-off) in the semifinals, before losing to third-seeded Elena Dementieva in the final. The US Open saw Janković defeat world no. 10 Vaidišová {{in the third round}}, world no. 7 and former champion Svetlana Kuznetsova in the fourth round, and world no. 5 Dementieva in her first Grand Slam quarterfinal. In the semifinals, Janković lost to world no. 2 Justine Henin in three sets, after Janković had led 6–4, 4–2. Janković argued with the chair umpire, when the umpire refused to offer an opinion as to whether a service call had been correct, suggesting that Janković use one of her electronic challenges. Janković then lost ten consecutive games.|$|E
25|$|Having {{the ball}} to start the second half, the Patriots moved to the Jets' 34-yard line on four plays, but on a {{subsequent}} 12-yard Watson reception, the tight end fumbled as he was being tackled by linebacker Eric Barton; the loose ball was recovered by safety Kerry Rhodes and returned 11 yards to the Jets' 33-yard line. However, two sacks of Favre by Wilfork and Seymour, both for losses of nine yards, forced the Jets into their second three-and-out series of the night. Cassel was sacked on the next play, but four plays later, the Patriots had a first down from the Jets' 38-yard line. Patriots center Dan Koppen, who had left the game with an injury {{in the second quarter}} but later returned, snapped the ball while Cassel was making adjustments at the line and was not ready to receive the snap. Cassel chased the Koppen fumble and recovered it at the Patriots' 38-yard line for a loss of 24 yards. The Patriots, later facing 4th-and-21, punted to give the Jets the ball at their own 16-yard line. A Jets punt was followed by an exchange of three-and-outs, eventually setting up a Patriots drive to begin from their own 22-yard line. A 29-yard Welker reception put the Patriots in Jets territory; five plays later, Watson caught a 10-yard touchdown pass, his <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year,</b> cutting the Jets' lead to 24–19. On the final snap of the third quarter, the Patriots attempted a two-point conversion and succeeded; the Gaffney catch put the Patriots to within a field goal, trailing 24–21.|$|E

500|$|According to {{one version}} of the story, while {{traversing}} the countryside, Radama and his men came across a wild zebu so exceptionally fat that the king {{decided to make a}} burnt offering of it. As the zebu flesh cooked, the enticing smell led Ralambo to taste the meat. He declared zebu meat to be fit for human consumption. In honor of the discovery, he decided to establish a holiday called fandroana that would be distinguished by the consumption of well-fattened zebu meat. [...] The holiday was to be celebrated on the day of his birth, which coincided with {{the first day of the}} year. To this end, the holiday symbolically represented a community-wide renewal that would take place over a period of several days before and after the <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b>|$|E
2500|$|On September 25, 1971, Michigan {{defeated}} UCLA, 38–0, {{before a}} crowd of 89,177 in the rain at Michigan Stadium. Michigan led 24–0 at halftime on touchdown runs by Fritz Seyferth and Ed Shuttlesworth, a 31-yard field goal by Dana Coin, and a 32-yard touchdown pass from Kevin Casey to Bo Rather. Casey's touchdown pass to Rather was the <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> for Michigan. In the fourth quarter, Michigan added two more touchdowns on a 92-yard interception return by Thom Darden and a short run by Harry Banks. With 91 rushing yards, Billy Taylor passed 2,000 career rushing yards to move into third place among Michigan's career rushing leaders. On defense, Michigan held UCLA to 39 rushing yards and sacked UCLA quarterback nine times. After the game, UCLA coach Pepper Rodgers said, [...] "I've never had a team dominated {{the way we were}} today." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before 1912 the {{delivery}} of parcels was controlled and handled by private companies, most of whom operated in cities and urban areas where there was more business to be had. Consequently, delivery of parcels to rural areas was inadequate and frequently hindered farmers who needed various supplies, parts and equipment delivered to their remote locations. To meet this demand Congress approved a law on August 24, 1912 creating postal rates for fourth class mail and providing for parcel post service. The Congressional law authorized the U.S. Post Office to produce the various special purpose postage stamps to pay the parcel fees, which became effective on January 1, 1913, the first day the U.S. Parcel Post began service. The 12 stamps were printed by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing on the flat plate printing press on soft yellowish wove paper made with a single-line watermark bearing the letters 'U S P S' and were perforated with 12 gauge [...] The stamps were designed by Clair Aubrey Houston {{who at the time}} had worked at the Bureau for ten years, while the dies for the individual stamps were produced by several different engravers, with up to four engravers working on each die. The Post Office initially planned to place all dozen stamps on sale before parcel post service began, but Frank Hitchcock, the Postmaster General, deemed the original designs for the 3-cent, 50-cent and 75-cent denominations unsatisfactory, delaying the issue of those values until after the <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b> The twelve stamps each bore their own distinctive subject in the vignette and were issued in a single color, [...] "carmine-rose". It was Hitchcock {{who came up with the}} idea of printing all the denominations of these stamps in one uniform color. However, because of the common color and similarity in border design Parcel Post stamps during the first six months of use were met with mixed reaction from postal personnel who had difficulty distinguishing the stamps at a glance and often confused the denominations, especially during busy hours. [...] "In an effort to help the stamp clerks an inscription of value in large plain capital letters was added to the [...] margin, next to each plate number. These were first added to plates on January 27, 1913." [...] An example of these large red spelled-out numbers, which appeared on two margins of each pane, can be seen on the illustration of the ten-cent plate block in the section [...] "Other configurations" [...] further down this page. [...] To compound the situation the stamps were larger than ordinary definitive stamps of the period, making it difficult to situate them on smaller parcels with limited space around the address and return address. They were also issued in sheets of 180, with four panes of 45 stamps per sheet, which was an inconvenient number for accounting purposes. By March the Postmaster General was considering using different colors for the individual stamps and a smaller, definitive-sized design [...] (for which plates of the 1 cent, 2 cent and 5 cent denominations were even engraved). Production of the Parcel Post sheets cut into 45 stamps each resulted in a somewhat higher percentage of stamps with straight edges (see image below) than other stamp productions, much to the disappointment of collectors at the time. Some philatelic publishers like Stanley Gibbons were rather unforgiving in their estimation of these new issues, referring to them as [...] "very useless stamps" [...] having an [...] "ugliness" [...] about them.|$|E
