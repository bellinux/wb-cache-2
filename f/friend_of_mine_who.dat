500|$|Petrucci {{has called}} Portnoy's {{departure}} {{one of the}} hardest things Dream Theater have had to face, and speaking of when he first heard the news, Jordan Rudess recounted, [...] "You know, just to give you an idea of how deep this was to lose him, how difficult it was... after we got off the phone with him... I literally sat on the steps of my studio and cried. This is a guy who's a <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine,</b> <b>who</b> we all love and admire. We didn't want to see it come crashing down." ...|$|E
500|$|Pinsky {{stated that}} he felt [...] "really inept" [...] when {{recording}} his dialogue. He said: [...] "Amongst my friends I'm funny. In that context of Dan Castellaneta... I {{would say it was}} like a disaster movie, and I was that character played by Susan Hayward." [...] The poem Pinsky reads in the episode was picked by the Simpsons writing staff, [...] "The poem has two jokes in it," [...] Pinsky said, [...] "and when I say jokes I don't mean witty remarks. It's more like an optician, the pope and a zebra go into the bar and then there's a punch line at the end." [...] He stated that the poem was [...] "an elegy for a <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> <b>who</b> liked jokes". He added that his appearance on the show gave him [...] "a lot more prestige" [...] when visiting high schools and colleges. The episode also features Karl Wiedergott as the professor at the Springfield University.|$|E
500|$|... "Thank you, mister President-elect, for {{inviting}} me to your inauguration gala. I {{would like to take}} a moment from this very public ceremony to speak of something very personal. It concerns a dear <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> <b>who</b> is no longer with us. His name is Ryan White. He was a hemophiliac who was diagnosed with the AIDS virus when he was eleven. He died shortly after turning eighteen, the very time most young people are beginning to explore life's wonderful possibilities. My friend Ryan was a very bright, very brave, and very normal young man who never wanted to be a symbol or a spokesperson for a deadly disease. Over the years, I've shared many silly, happy, and painful moments with Ryan and I was with him {{at the end of his}} brief but eventful journey. Ryan is gone and just as anyone who has lost a loved one to AIDS, I miss him deeply and constantly. He is gone, but I want his life to have meaning beyond his passing. It is my hope, President-elect Clinton, that you and your administration commit the resources needed to eliminate this awful disease that took my friend, and ended so many promising lives before their time. This song is for you Ryan". - Michael Jackson, January 1993.|$|E
6000|$|... "As {{a matter}} of fact," [...] said Brent, [...] "I have promised {{faithfully}} to do a favor for certain <b>friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> <b>who</b> have been clamouring to be presented to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Gerald's at {{the station}} hotel, waiting for the train to Liverpool. He sails for New York to-morrow and takes a letter to some <b>friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> <b>who</b> will give him a good start. He sent a note." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{not exactly}} at present," [...] {{returned}} the captain blandly, [...] "but {{there are two}} obstinate <b>friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> <b>who,</b> I have been told, would oppose me pretty stoutly if I was to tell 'em all the truth about it." ...|$|R
2500|$|The single, {{along with}} its parent album, was put on hold when Adam Ant (who {{has a history of}} bipolar {{disorder}} and was widely suspected around this time to have been undergoing a manic episode) was once again sectioned on 18 May 2010 and it remained to be seen if a medicated and stabilised Adam would wish to continue this project or not. However, interviewed by The Sun on 31 December 2010 Adam Ant – by his own admission once more unmedicated and now including Baillie on backing vocals in his live band – confirmed the song as still on the album. [...] "Georgina is a <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> <b>who</b> has really been through it. Her grandad still won't speak to her because he is so hurt." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cornell {{said that}} [...] "Hands All Over" [...] {{is about how}} humans defile the environment, and that [...] "Full on Kevin's Mom" [...] is about [...] "a <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> <b>who</b> slept with another friend of mine's mom. The guy who did it said to us, 'Yeah, full on Kevin's mom'." [...] The lyrics of [...] "I Awake" [...] were {{originally}} part of a note written by Yamamoto's then girlfriend Kate McDonald. In the late 1990s, an urban legend circulated on internet message boards which stated that Yamamoto, after writing the music, wrote some lyrics {{on the back side}} of McDonald's note. When Yamamoto gave the paper containing these lyrics to Cornell, Cornell looked at {{the wrong side of the}} sheet and believed McDonald's note was the lyrics to Yamamoto's song. There was less material on the album intended as humorous compared with Ultramega OK. However, the song [...] "Big Dumb Sex" [...] was written as a parody of glam metal bands, who often metaphorically addressed sexual intercourse in their lyrics. The song, with its many uses of [...] "fuck", was the reason the album gained a Parental Advisory sticker upon release.|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't say--I didn't connect {{her with}} him. Fine looking old man. A <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> <b>who</b> {{recommended}} him told me he'd seen better days...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, easily enough," [...] said Hall Pycroft, cheerily. [...] "You are two <b>friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> <b>who</b> are in {{want of a}} billet, {{and what}} could be more natural than that I should bring you both round to the {{managing}} director?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't help that," [...] said Alton. [...] "I am a Canadian, but if {{you want}} another reason, it wouldn't suit me to drink with you, anyway. You see, you didn't do the square thing with one or two <b>friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> <b>who</b> worked on the Tyee." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{seen him}} {{once or twice}} before he fell into Broughton's hands; the {{imported}} Red Rover strain is marked in him, and a <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine,</b> <b>who's</b> going in for Herefords, {{told me not to}} stick at a few dollars if I could pick up such a bull." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall {{carry them}} {{to the home of}} a <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> <b>who</b> has three {{children}}. The children will love to have the fishes for pets." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{other day}} a poet <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine,</b> <b>who</b> {{has lived in}} close communion with nature all his life, wrote a poem {{and took it to}} an editor.|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{late father}} had a claim on government," [...] Percy answered, [...] "for money {{expended}} in foreign service. As his heir, I inherit the claim, which has been formally recognized by the present Ministers. My petition for a settlement will be presented by <b>friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> <b>who</b> can advocate my interests in the House of Commons." ...|$|R
50|$|I think it's a total {{nightmare}} and disaster, and I'm {{ashamed that}} I went against my own instincts in supporting it. It's something I'll never do again. Never. I got convinced by a <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> <b>who's</b> smarter than I am, and I shouldn't have done that. No. I want things to work out, but I'm enraged by it, actually.|$|R
40|$|FROM THE POST: "Earlier this week, I {{hooked up}} for a lunch with George Archer and Jonathan Nitzan, two <b>friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> <b>who</b> also had {{previous}} stints working at BCA Research. I enjoyed our lunch and conversation. After we met, Jonathan sent me a paper he published along with Shimshon Bichler, ‘Can Capitalists Afford a Trumped Recovery? Let me begin by stating.... ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Neither," [...] I said, [...] "and {{especially}} not for amusement. The fact is, I've been lured down here by a <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> <b>who</b> {{has started a}} chicken farm--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Forgive me, {{and let me}} do what I may. Rest here quietly. I'll write {{a letter}} to a good <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine,</b> <b>who</b> will find you a home, if you leave us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hear," [...] said Clarence casually, [...] "that he {{has been}} going very well at the Lobelia. A <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> <b>who</b> was there last night told me he took eleven calls." ...|$|E
6000|$|Father Tiebout {{wrinkled}} his brows. [...] "There is, I think, {{only one}} place where she would be safe, and {{that is on the}} coast. There are also <b>friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> <b>who</b> could be trusted to take good care of her in the city, and she could be sent down from the San Thome Mission. It is, however, a long journey." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, I have, every Wednesday fortnight,' Berkeley answered, with a smile. 'I {{go there}} regularly. You see, Lady Hilda, Wednesday's a half-holiday at Pilbury Grammar School; so every second week I run {{down for the}} day to visit an old <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine,</b> <b>who's</b> also an {{acquaintance}} of yours, I believe,--Ernest Le Breton. He's married now, you know, and has got a mastership at the Pilbury Grammar School.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have good}} news for you," [...] Andrew said, when the first {{greetings}} were over. [...] "A vessel sails in the morning, and I have taken passages for you in it; and what is more, have brought your permits. I went to the provost and said to him, 'Provost, I want you to sign these permits for two <b>friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> <b>who</b> are wanting {{to go up to}} London.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{not even}} an acquaintance," [...] said the man, smiling. [...] "But I am {{interested}} in him, through a <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> <b>who</b> met him abroad. Permit me to introduce myself, sir." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Caleb Walton!" [...] he ejaculated joyfully, {{and held}} out his bronzed hand. [...] "I just came in to see you. Here is a young <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> <b>who</b> wants to sign {{articles}} under Uncle Sam. Do you think you can take him in?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are going}} to the house of a worthy couple, who have shown {{themselves}} faithful and trustworthy by nursing a <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine,</b> <b>who</b> has for nearly six months been lying ill there. You will be perfectly safe there till we can arrange matters." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To escape. If I {{give the}} signal {{on your way}} to the gate where I must lead you, you will be rescued by certain <b>friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> <b>who</b> will hide you in a place of safety, while I, the officer, shall seem to be cut down. Afterwards I can join you and under cover of the night, by a way of which I know, we will fly together." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "With Fink we do {{sing about}} {{relationships}} {{and love and}} emotions - but we also sing about other stuff: embracing fear, Berlin dawns, looking forward. Perfect Darkness was written about a <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> <b>who’s</b> just signed a massive record deal and it’s all about to kick off. And I’m saying, ‘just roll with it man. It’s gonna get dark but you’ll survive and you’ll come out the other side.’" [...] - Fin Greenall.|$|R
6000|$|Acton {{leaned forward}} in his chair. [...] "Mrs. Acton seems to fancy it {{concerns}} her, too. In fact, that's one reason why I wrote to you. Well, I'm going to lay before you a business proposition. You have probably heard of the Hecla Mineral Exploitation concern? It's run by two <b>friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine,</b> <b>who</b> have made {{a great deal of}} money out of their claims. They're getting elderly, and are open to take in a younger man--a man of education, who has some acquaintance with the work that's done in the Bush. He must take hold now, and hold stock in the concern. Here's the last letter they wrote me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no, Christian, thou must permit Hilda {{to teach}} me, {{because she is}} an old <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine,</b> <b>who</b> all her life has ever been more willing to learn than to teach. Therefore am I curious to know how she will change her character." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{it is not}} {{policy to}} bind oneself too closely to detail. A wise <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine,</b> <b>who</b> knows his business, {{describes}} his hero invariably in the vaguest terms. He will not even tell you whether the man is tall or short, clean shaven or bearded.|$|E
60|$|My {{opinion of}} our own {{supporters}} went lower every day, and my opinion of the Liberal voters higher, till it so happened that I went one day to an old <b>friend</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> <b>who</b> {{was working on the}} Liberal side. I asked him how he liked it.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, she {{commented on}} the denial of crimes in Prijedor: [...] "Current Serb {{authorities}} in Prijedor are constantly trying to erase the part of history between 1992 and 1995 and ensure that it isn't written about or spoken about. That hurts us the most. That part of history belongs to us, the citizens of Prijedor, and we can never forget nor are we allowed to because of the civilians who were killed here." [...] She said that she carries [...] "emotions, emotions and sadness for all those <b>friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> <b>who</b> are no longer here and were killed just because they had different names. It is incomprehensible that in Prijedor, the town where we lived together, {{that that kind of}} crime could occur." ...|$|R
5000|$|The martial {{appearance}} of these men, when they marched into Perth in May, 1760, with the earl of Sutherland at their head, was never forgotten {{by those who}} saw them, and who never failed to express admiration of their fine military air. Some old <b>friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine,</b> <b>who</b> often saw these men in Perth, spoke of them {{with a kind of}} enthusiasm. Considering the abstemious habits, or rather the poverty of the Highlanders, the size and muscular strength of the people are remarkable. In this corps there was no light infantry company; upwards of 260 men being above five feet eleven inches in height, they were formed into two grenadier companies, one on each flank of the battalion.

6000|$|... "Hoskins, my Lord--and so I told Gus; {{but you see}} he is {{very fond}} of me, and will have it that I am related to Lady D.: and say what I will to the contrary, tells the story everywhere. Though to be sure," [...] added I with a laugh, [...] "it has gained me no small good in my time." [...] So I {{described}} to the party our dinner at Mrs. Roundhand's, which all came from my diamond-pin, and my reputation as a connection of the aristocracy. Then I thanked Lady Jane handsomely for her magnificent present of fruit and venison, {{and told her that}} it had entertained a great number <b>of</b> kind <b>friends</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine,</b> <b>who</b> had drunk her Ladyship's health with the greatest gratitude.|$|R
