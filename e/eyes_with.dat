Theseus, alone with his counsellor, discusses his abandonment of Ariadne, and is advised that this decision is justified, as {{she will not be}} acceptable to the people of Athens as their ruler's consort.|$|E

Omega {{captured}} the championship after a snap dragon suplex, a bicycle knee strike, and the One Winged Angel (electric chair dropped into a one-handed driver), pinning the champion at 13 minutes and 20 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Many {{bivalves}} have no eyes, but a {{few members}} of the Arcoidea, Limopsoidea, Mytiloidea, Anomioidea, Ostreoidea, and Limoidea have simple eyes on the margin of the mantle. These consist of a pit of photosensory cells and a lens. Scallops have more complex <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> a lens, a two-layered retina, and a concave mirror. All bivalves have light-sensitive cells that can detect a shadow falling over the animal.|$|E

5|$|Although it is {{predominantly}} populated by humans, Spira features {{a variety of}} races. The people of Spira mainly reside in small towns and villages and cities like Bevelle and Luca. The Al Bhed is a unique ethnic group which {{plays an important role}} in the storyline and world of the games with distinctive green <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> spiral-shaped pupils. The culture and conflicts of the Al Bhed permeate the games. The main characters Rikku, is Al Bhed, and Yuna is part Al Bhed on her mother's side; and assistance in gained through a cast of supporting Al Bhed character's, prevalent in Final Fantasy X-2. With the collapse of the teachings of Yevon and the wider acceptance of machina at the end of Final Fantasy X, prejudice against the Al Bhed seems to have eased significantly by the time of Final Fantasy X-2, though it is still present.|$|E
5|$|Murtagh becomes Eragon's new {{companion}} and {{they travel to}} the city Gil'ead to find {{information on how to}} find the Varden, a group of rebels who want to see the downfall of Galbatorix. While stopping near Gil'ead, Eragon is captured and imprisoned in the same jail that holds a woman he has been having dreams about. As she is being dragged past she is revealed as an elf when her pointed ears are uncovered. Murtagh and Saphira stage a rescue, and Eragon escapes with the unconscious elf. During the escape, Eragon and Murtagh battle with Durza. Murtagh shoots Durza between the <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> an arrow, and the Shade disappears in a cloud of mist. Having escaped, they run off. Eragon succeeds in communicating with the elf, whose name is revealed as Arya, and learns the location of the Varden. After some arguing, Murtagh decides to still travel with Eragon to the Varden but is still wary of them.|$|E

5|$|The {{books are}} written in first-person narrative, {{primarily}} through Bella's <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> the epilogue of the third book {{and a part of}} the fourth book being from Jacob's point of view. When asked about the structure of the novel, Meyer described her difficulty in pinpointing the premise of the novels to any specific their category: I have a hard time with that. Because if I say to someone, 'You know, it's about vampires,' then immediately they have this mental image of what the book is like. And it's so not like the other vampire books out thereâ€“Anne Rice's and the few that I've read. It isn't that kind of dark and dreary and blood-thirsty world. Then when you say, 'It's set in high school,' a lot of people immediately put it in another pool. It's easy to pigeonhole with different descriptions.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, Roger summons all {{the partners}} {{to his office}} to learn the fate of their Jaguar presentation. Don locks <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> Joan when she joins them, realizing that she has, in fact, slept with Herb. Roger receives the congratulatory confirmation call from Jaguar, and the office erupts in celebration. In Don's office, Peggy informs him she has accepted a job with CGC. He thinks she is asking for a raise and attempts to negotiate salary, but she tells him {{it is not about}} money. She holds back tears as he kisses her hand. She walks out of the office and smiles as she waits for an elevator.|$|E
5|$|The {{milk shark}} has a slender build with a long, pointed snout, large, round <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> nictitating {{membranes}} (protective third eyelids), and no spiracles. On {{each side of}} the head behind the corner of the jaw, there are usually seven to 15 enlarged pores. The nostrils are small, as are the adjacent triangular skin flaps. There are long furrows at the corners of the mouth on both the upper and lower jaws. The tooth rows number 2425 in both jaws. The upper teeth are finely serrated and strongly oblique; the lower teeth have a similar shape, though the serrations are smaller and the tips curve gently upward. The teeth of juveniles are smooth-edged.|$|E

5|$|The prosoma {{is formed}} in the embryo by fusion of the acron, which carries the <b>eyes,</b> <b>with</b> {{segments}} two to seven, which all have paired appendages, while segment one is lost during the embryo's development. Segment two has a pair of chelicerae, small appendages that often form pincers, segment three has a pair of pedipalps that in most sub-groups perform sensory functions, while the remaining four cephalothorax segments have pairs of legs. In primitive forms the acron has a pair of compound eyes on the sides and four pigment-cup ocelli ("little eyes") in the middle. The mouth is between segments two and three.|$|E
5|$|P. sibiricus is {{the largest}} known species of Psittacosaurus. The skull of the type {{specimen}} is 20.7centimetres long (8.25in), and the femur is 22.3cm (8.75in) in length. It is also distinguished by its neck frill, which is longer than any other species, at 15 to 18% of skull length. A very striking feature of P. sibiricus {{is the number of}} 'horns' around the <b>eyes,</b> <b>with</b> three prominences on each postorbital, and one in front of each eye, on the palpebral bones. Similar horns found on the postorbital of P. sinensis are not as pronounced but may be homologous. The jugal has extremely prominent 'horns' and may contact the premaxilla, both features also seen in the possibly related P. sinensis. There is a flange on the dentary of the lower jaw, similar to P. mongoliensis, P. meileyingensis, and P. sattayaraki. It can be told apart from the other species of Psittacosaurus by a combination of 32 anatomical features, including six that are unique to the species. Most of these are skull details, but one unusual feature is the presence of 23 vertebrae between the skull and pelvis, unlike the 21 or 22 in the other species where the vertebrae are known.|$|E
5|$|The NWA World Tag Team Championship was {{defended by}} America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm; AMW) against Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray) next. Gail Kim {{accompanied}} AMW to the ring. Mid-way through the bout, Team 3D performed their signature Whassup? maneuver on Storm. Kim interfered in the bout, distracting the referee. Around this time, Devon retrieved a table {{from under the}} ring which both teams used as a weapon, however the referee did not disqualify anyone for the usage. AMW earned a near-fall after a bearhug and a lariat combination on Ray. Team 3D followed with their own near-fall on Harris, after they performed their signature Deadly Device maneuver on Storm. After this, Kim interfered trying to blow powder into Ray's eyes, only for Ray to stop her and blow it back into her and the referee's <b>eyes.</b> <b>With</b> the referee blinded, Team 3D performed their signature 3D maneuver on Harris and the referee counted the pin. Team Canada then attacked 3D, knocking out Ray in the process with a hockey stick. They placed Harris on top of Ray and left the ring. After the referee regained his vision, he declared AMW the victors at 12 minutes and 41 seconds.|$|E

5|$|This loss led Tiku to {{reinforce}} his men. The Torajan troops were armed with rifles, spears, boulders, swords, and chili pepper extract, sprayed into enemy <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> a device called a tirik lada, or blowgun, to blind them. Tiku himself was {{armed with a}} Portuguese rifle, spear, and labo. He wore protective armour, a sepu (crotch guard), and a songkok with protrusions {{in the shape of}} buffalo horns, and carried a decorated shield. With his soldiers, Tiku dug pits filled with bamboo stakes along Dutch supply routes; those who wandered over the pits would fall in and be impaled. However, these were not enough to stop the advancing Dutch. On 17 October 1906, two more fortresses, Bamba Puang and Kotu, fell, after several unsuccessful Dutch attacks since June. As the campaign against Tiku, which had already lasted longer than most other campaigns in the occupation, was thought to undermine Dutch authority in Sulawesi, Governor-General J. B. van Heutsz dispatched Governor of Sulawesi Swart to personally lead the attack.|$|E
