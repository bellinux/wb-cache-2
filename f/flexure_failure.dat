40|$|In this paper, two {{loosely coupled}} single {{degree of freedom}} (SDOF) systems are used to {{generate}} pressure-impulse diagrams (P-I) with the flexural and direct shear responses of one-way reinforced concrete slabs subjected to blast loading. The effect of span length to height ratio in P-I diagrams is investigated. The numerical calculation results indicate that a slab tends to fail in a direct shear mode if the blast load amplitude is high but of short duration. It tends to fail in flexural failure mode if load amplitude is relatively low and duration is relatively long. And {{the failure of the}} slab might be a combination of shear and flexural damage in the dynamic loading region. Based on numerical results, different failure modes are got with different the span length to height ratio on the P-I diagrams. Results indicate that there is only shear failure mode in the P-I diagrams when L/h 24. 89, there are two damage mode in the P-I diagrams with <b>flexure</b> <b>failure</b> mode and flexure-shear failure mode. When 10. 9 < L/h < 24. 89, there are three damage modes in the P-I diagrams: shear failure mode, <b>flexure</b> <b>failure</b> mode and flexure-shear failure mode...|$|E
40|$|Three {{interior}} and three exterior fiber reinforced slab-column connections {{were subjected to}} gravity loads and then tested under lateral load simulating earthquake forces. Test results were compared to previous tests on non-fiber slab-column connections. Addition of steel fiber to the concrete matrix greatly increased the ductility and the energy dissipation capacity of all specimens. Fiber reinforcement also enhanced the shear capacity of interior connections. The failure mode switched from punching shear in interior connections with small amount or no fiber reinforcement to <b>flexure</b> <b>failure</b> in interior connections with higher fiber reinforcement ratios. Fiber reinforcement apparently did not improve the shear strength of exterior connections. The optimum amount of steel fiber found through the tests was between 50 and 100 pounds of fiber per cubic yard of concrete...|$|E

The behaviour of long fibre composites subjected to tensile loads has been widely studied and theories concerning the failure mechanisms are accepted and included in standard texts. In many applications compressive strength is important and in <b>flexure</b> <b>failure</b> is often initiated on the compressive side of the composite. However, compressive failure has not been studied thoroughly, {{partly because of the}} large number of failure mechanisms which can occur and the difficulties in conducting meaningful compression tests.

40|$|Hollow-core {{flooring}} {{units are}} designed as simply supported members. However, frequently in construction, continuity is established between the units and supporting structure {{by the addition}} of insitu topping concrete and steel reinforcement. This change in structural form can result in negative bending moments and axial forces being induced in the floor by seismic and other structural actions. Significant negative moments are induced by load combinations that include the effects of seismic forces due to vertical ground motion. The focus of this research was two failure mechanisms possible under these loading conditions, a flexural failure and a shear failure. Both failure mechanisms were investigated analytically and experimentally. A brittle flexural failure was observed experimentally in a sub assembly test that contained starter bars and mesh reinforcement in the insitu topping concrete. The failure occurred at loads lower than those predicted using standard flexural theory. It appears that, due to the prestressing and low reinforcement ratio of the topping concrete, the assumption that plane sections remain plane is not appropriate for this situation. It is proposed that a strain concentration factor be introduced to account for the effects of tension stiffening. This factor improves the correlation between observed and predicted flexural strength. The second failure mode investigated was a <b>flexure</b> shear <b>failure</b> in a negative moment zone. Flexural cracks reduce the shear strength of a reinforced concrete member. Analytical predictions suggest that some hollow-core floor details could be prone to this type of brittle <b>failure.</b> A <b>flexure</b> shear <b>failure</b> was not observed experimentally; however, this does not eliminate the possibility of this failure mode. A summary of other failure mechanisms possible in hollow-core flooring is also presented.

30|$|Beams R 5 and R 6 failed near {{a region}} {{adjacent}} to the loading point (i.e., at one third span of the beam) in flexural-shear and <b>flexure</b> <b>failure</b> mode, respectively. As a result, both these beams {{did not have a}} sufficiently long undamaged length for another re-test in flexure-shear mode. Hence each of these two beams could provide only one failure capacity. Beam R 5 failed on the South side without any prior warning. The sudden brittle failure of beams subjected to flexure-shear was explained by Kani (1964). When the strength of concrete “teeth” formed between the flexural cracks is smaller than the remaining arch, the beam fails suddenly as soon as the strength of teeth is compromised. Specimen R 6 apparently failed in flexure mode instead of the targeted flexure-shear mode. Beam R 6 demonstrated much higher web-shear capacity than expected, owing to the use of higher fiber-factor.|$|E

40|$|Concrete is a {{heterogeneous}} material consisting of aggregates {{embedded in a}} cement-sand matrix (mortar). The compression behavior of the aggregate is linear up till failure and the mortar is a brittle-linear material, with a reversible deformation up to its limit, followed by a sudden failure. The resulting concrete demonstrates a quasi-ductile behavior with a progressive decrease in load bearing capacity under incremental monotonic loading. The fracture mechanism of plain concrete on the other hand, is highly influenced by the bond strength in the interface and the tensile strength of the mortar. A Finite Element Model (FEM) was developed for analyzing the fracture characteristic of concrete in <b>flexure.</b> Two <b>failure</b> criteria were evaluated, the Mӧhr-Coulomb envelope and the Kupfer-HilsdorfRusch criteria.

ANSYS 12. 1 was employed to develop nonlinear finite element models of LSRC beams. The beams modelled with ANSYS followed the same trend as the actual beam in the elastic range, however after the first cracking the loss of stiffness in ANSYS model caused greater deflection compared to the actual beam. It is obvious that after the first crack the stiffness of sandwich section decrease because the lower elastic modulus of the combined materials. Another investigation is made to compare the behaviour of an LSRC beam with a hollow beam subjected to <b>flexure</b> <b>failure.</b> It is found that the stiffness decreases along with the decrease of the cross section of concrete.

A parametric study is performed to observe the different degrees of shear and <b>flexure</b> <b>failure</b> in a pier with respect to pier diameter, transverse reinforcement spacing and vehicle impact velocity. The finite element software LS-DYNA was used to conduct the performed work. Material models, contact algorithms and modeling methods were first validated by recreating reinforced concrete beam impact experiments. In addition, an in depth analysis was performed investigating the internal forces generated within the impact beams with respect to differential steel reinforcement layouts. Once the models were calibrated and validated, the reinforced concrete bridge piers were constructed. The Ford F 800 reduced vehicle model obtained from the National Crash Analysis Center and the National Transportation Research Center, Inc. was used in the study. The bridge pier collision models were then validated once more by comparing vehicle damage and impact forces with published experimental and numerical research results. In order to ensure stability within the impact simulations, the conservation of energy of the systems were closely monitored. This study shows that the overall failure mode of the pier was dependent on the pier diameter and the transverse reinforcement ratio governed the extent of localized damage experienced within the pier. The impacting vehicles kinetic energy had the most profound effects on the magnitude of internal forces generated within the pier.

To study such failures, this paper compares experimental results with predictions of models with various levels of complexity. It is shown that complex nonlinear finite element models (FEM) can capture adequately the entire behaviour of short coupling beams, while the classical flexural model produces unconservative strength predictions. It is also shown that strut-and-tie models are reasonably conservative provided that their geometry is selected to maximize the strength predictions.

40|$|Compliant {{mechanisms}} {{continue to}} see increased used {{in many areas of}} modem engineering. Their low cost, ease of production and manufacturing, and precision of motion have made them attractive solutions to many controlled motion systems such as nanopositioners or linear platforms. However, in some applications the stiffness requirements for the devices to function properly and the stiffness requirements for devices to survive outside effects such at vibration or impulse create a conflict which cannot be rectified with traditional engineering approaches. By utilizing boundary controls which acted only when a flexure reached a certain deflection, the original purpose of the device could be preserved while also reducing or eliminating the risk of failure from plastic deformation or brittle failure. By starting with the most basic of compliant mechanisms, the cantilever beam, and utilizing Buckingham Pi theory the dynamic behavior of the vibrating beams could be quantified and the associated variables used to tailor the design of a flexure and boundary control system. This research details the primary correlation between variables in a flexure system during natural frequency excitation and provides the mathematics necessary to implement boundary controls to prevent <b>flexure</b> <b>failure.</b> With this new information, cantilever style flexures can now be designed to operate in environments which previously would have put them at risk of catastrophic failure, and can allow for three to four times the increased range performance of a compliant mechanism in these environments without risk of failure.

Aim: This study evaluated the transverse deflection and transverse strength of four commercial brands of heat cure acrylic resin (Stellon, Acrylin-H, Trevalon and Trevalon-HI). Materials and Methods: An experimental design was adapted. Twenty-four rectangular strip specimens, six for each group, were prepared. Strips were finished on the edges and equally from the both the molded surfaces to make strips of specific dimensions. The tests were conducted mainly in accordance with the American Dental Association Specification no. 12 /ISO: 1567 - 1981 (ISO: 6887 - 1986) for denture base polymer.

In addition, the mode of failure observed in PKSC was ductile compared to the brittle failure of NWC beams. Thus, the PKSC beams showed a ductile failure, giving amble warning before failure happened. PKSC beams also exhibited a lot of cracking thus the crack width and crack spacing was small. The other advantage for PKSC beams was deflection. The PKSC beams exhibited higher deflection under constant load until failure, compared to NWC beams that failed in brittle manner without warning. Higher concrete strains for the reinforcement in the PKSC shows stronger bond between PKSC and the reinforcement...|$|R
40|$|In {{reinforced}} concrete beams subjected to concentrated loads, the shear resisted increases considerably as the loads {{approach to the}} support. There is not a consensus in the current codes of practice about any simple design formulation which adequately considers this phenomenon. A mechanical model has been developed at the Polytechnic University of Barcelona, which predicts the shear strength of beams. The mo del is originally applicable to slender beams (a/d > 2. 0 - 2. 5), and is under consideration for adoption into the Eurocodes. The model deals with shear - <b>flexure</b> <b>failure,</b> in which flexural cracks develop inclined through the web and stabilized near the neutral axis. Failure is assumed to happen when this flexural crack develops inside the compression chord, subjected to normal and shear stresses, which takes place when the stresses reach the biaxial failure envelope of Kupfer. The model has been extended to ca ses where the loads are applied near the supports. In this case, the Bernoulli assumption (Plane sections remain plane) is no longer valid, and the problem must be faced as a typical discontinuity “D” region, because the dimensions (a/d< 2) and because the vertical stresses introduced by the vertical loads {{by means of the}} bearing plates interact with the state of stresses of the compression chord. The extension of the model proposed at UPC consists on incrementing the neutral axis depth as the load approach es the supports and including the vertical stresses due to the applied concentrated loads, as confinement stresses in the concrete, thus changing the state of principal stress in the failure envelope from tension - compression to compression - compression, thu s enhancing the shear capacity In this thesis, a data base of beams with loads near the supports, with and without stirrups, has been collected. A comparison between the predictions of the proposed model and the predictions of the Eurocodes has been made, using the collected data base of 121 short - span beams which failed in shear. 43 of the beams had stirrups, while the last 78 were not transversally reinforced, all the beams have a/d - ratios of less than 2. 5. The results obtained in this thesis are appro ximate to the results achieved in other literature. The proposed model compares favourably to the Eurocode for beams with and without shear reinforcement. In addition, some of the assumptions of the new model have been investigated using a 2 D finite elemen t model. The results obtained with the 2 D FEM confirm the assumptions used in the model...|$|E

H 577 P CEE 2015 Zhengxxiv, 324 pages :illustrationsAs one of {{the most}} {{damaging}} natural disasters, strong earthquakes often cause numerous structures to collapse and many people to die, which were reflected over again in recent Wenchuan Earthquake in 2008, Tohoku Earthquake in 2011, and Nepal Earthquake in 2015. To prevent buildings from collapse when they are subjected to strong earthquakes, the dynamic collapse of reinforced concrete (RC) building structures has been investigated actively and extensively, in which the finite element (FE) -method-based collapse analysis of RC building structures is an effective method. However, all the current FE-method-based seismic collapse analyses are based on the removal of entire element, but the actual seismic collapse of a structure often starts from the failure of an element at some degree-of-freedoms (DOFs). The removal of an element without the failure at all its DOFs may lead to false structural collapse. More importantly, the current FE-method-based collapse analysis methods contain many uncertainties. The time-dependent compressive strength of concrete, the confinement effect of core concrete due to the stirrup, the creeping and shrinking effects of concrete, the strength enhancement effect of the reinforcement embedding in the concrete, and the existing damage in concrete and reinforcement due to previous earthquakes, among others, cannot be fully or partially considered in the current collapse analyses, which again may produce false structural collapse. On the other hand, as a cutting-edge technology, structure health monitoring (SHM) systems have been installed in some important buildings and bridges to monitor their functionality, safety, and integrity with the ultimate goal of preventing the buildings and bridges from collapse. Nevertheless, there are seldom studies on how to utilize the information recorded by a SHM system to eliminate the uncertainties existing in the current collapse analysis method and provide an evolutionary and accurate collapse analysis method including collapse prognosis. In view of the problems outlined above, this thesis aims at developing a SHM-based seismic collapse analysis (prognosis) method for RC structures under earthquake excitation. In consideration that the existing studies on RC bridge structures are much less than RC building structures and the collapse mechanism of RC bridge structures may be very different from that of RC building structures, this thesis focuses on seismic collapse analysis of RC bridge structures. A refined collapse analysis method for RC structures considering the DOF release other than the element removal is first proposed in this thesis. By considering the DOF release, the catenary effect of RC beams and the effect of axial force on RC columns can be considered. Three numerical case studies were performed to examine the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed DOF release method. The numerical results of the collapse analysis of a two-span RC continuous beam with its two ends fixed under a concentrated static load was first compared with the experimental results. The result comparisons show that the refined method gives a better agreement with the experimental results compared with the traditional element removal method. The refined dynamic collapse analysis method was then applied to a two-story RC frame structure to demonstrate the entire progress of dynamic collapse. The numerical results demonstrate again that the refined method gives more reasonable collapse results by taking the catenary effect into account than the traditional element removal method. Finally, a two-span continuous RC bridge with a two-column pier at its middle was taken as an example to demonstrate the applicability of the refined method to RC bridge structures. The results show that the collapse of the RC columns does not occur immediately after the DOFs associated with bending moment and shear force of the two columns are released, and that the final collapse of the two columns is due to excessive axial loads. This failure mode could not be predicted by the traditional element removal method. Therefore, the refined method based on DOF release is preferable for the collapse analysis of RC structures including RC bridge structures. A 1 : 12 scaled RC cable-stayed bridge model was then elaborately designed and constructed to experimentally study the seismic collapse of the RC bridge that was not designed for the seismic resistance and to provide measurement data for implementing the proposed SHM-based collapse analysis method. A comprehensive measurement (SHM) system was designed and installed on the RC bridge to record both the global responses and local responses of the bridge. Before the shaking table tests, each cable force of the as-built RC bridge was measured by the frequency method to ensure that the bridge configuration meets the design requirement. The dynamic characteristic test was then conducted to gain an insight of the properties of the bridge. Finally, a series of earthquake tests, which include small earthquake, moderate earthquake, large earthquake and collapse earthquake in terms of their peak ground accelerations (PGA) and spectra, were conducted. It was observed from the four shake table tests that: (1) the RC bridge performed linearly and elastically under the small earthquake excitation and the RC bridge kept intact conditions after the small earthquake excitation; (2) the RC bridge performed slightly nonlinearly and plastically under the moderate earthquake excitation. The concrete in the failure-vulnerable components cracked slightly; (3) the RC bridge performed severely nonlinearly and plastically under the large earthquake excitation. The concrete in the failure-vulnerable components crushed severely and the reinforcement in the failure-vulnerable components yielded severely; and (4) the RC bridge partially collapsed under the collapse earthquake excitation. The concrete in the failure-vulnerable components crushed severely and the reinforcement in the failure-vulnerable components yielded severely. The measured data acquired from the SHM system together with the dynamic characteristics provide plentiful information for the subsequent linear model updating of the intact bridge, the nonlinear model updating of the damaged bridge, and collapse prognosis for the damaged bridge, respectively. A 3 -D FE model of the physical RC cable-stayed bridge subject to shake table tests is established for conducting seismic collapse analysis. To get an accurate FE model of the bridge for further collapse prognosis, a linear model updating strategy using two types of objective functions, the objective function based on natural frequencies and the objective function based on acceleration and strain responses, is proposed with the purpose of updating key parameters of the intact bridge so as to eliminate the uncertainties related to the linear RC bridge structure. A total of 12 key parameters are identified by virtue of sensitivity-based FE model analyses and updated using natural frequencies as the objective function. Three accelerometers and three strain gauges are selected as the key sensor locations and their responses are used for the further model updating in the time domain. Various seismic response time histories computed using the two different updating methods are compared with the measured responses. The comparison results indicate that the two objective functions both can improve the quality of the FE model. The second objective function not only can be used as an alternate of the first one for nonlinear model updating but also provides better updating results than the first objective function. A nonlinear model updating method by using the measured acceleration responses and reinforcement strains of the RC cable-stayed bridge in the time domain is proposed to update the envelop curves of the materials of the nonlinear bridge without knowing its previous loading history. In the nonlinear model updating, the degradations of both unloading stiffness and reloading stiffness are accomplished in addition to the strength degradation. A total of 58 key parameters divided into the five groups are introduced to be updated. The optimization objective function used in the time domain {{is the same as the}} one presented for the linear model updating. Three accelerometers and three strain gauges are selected as the key sensor locations and their responses are used for the nonlinear model updating. The updated 58 key parameters are used to configure the envelop curves of the materials of the bridge due to the previous earthquakes and these curves are then used to calculate the seismic responses of the bridge subject to current earthquake excitation. Various seismic response time histories computed using the nonlinear updated results are compared with the measured responses. The comparison results indicate that the updated results of the key parameters are correct and the nonlinear model updating method is feasible. To further verify the SHM-based seismic collapse prognosis method, it is applied to the RC bridge subject to the collapse test. Since the seismic collapse prognosis of a structure shall be carried out based on the current damage conditions of the structure, the SHM-based nonlinear model updating is necessary to find out the current damage conditions of the structure. In this regard, the 58 key parameters of the RC bridge were updated by considering the bridge subject to the latest earthquake ground motion and using the nonlinear model updating method proposed. The results show that the values of the most updated parameters of the bridge under the latest large earthquake excitation became much smaller compared with those identified for the bridge subject to a moderate earthquake excitation. The values/thresholds of the failure criteria of the four zero-length failure elements of the RC bridge were also determined based on the current damaged conditions and compared with those from the undamaged conditions. The comparative results show that the values/ thresholds of the failure criteria of the four zero-length failure elements of the RC bridge determined based on the current damaged conditions are very different from those based on the undamaged conditions. The collapse prognosis of the RC bridge subject to two future earthquake ground excitations were finally performed base on the updated FE model of the bridge to find out which earthquake will cause the true bridge collapse. The computed results showed that the RC bridge did not collapse when it was subjected to the first future earthquake excitation of relatively small intensity. The computed results showed that when the bridge was subjected to the second earthquake excitation of relatively large intensity, the RC southwest pier, as {{one of the}} failure-vulnerable component, triggered the <b>flexure</b> <b>failure</b> at 3. 133 second of the earthquake excitation and it was separated from the RC bridge structure. The other three failure-vulnerable components experienced severe damage but not failed. A series of computed seismic responses such as acceleration, strain and reaction force of the RC bridge subject to the second earthquake excitation were compared with the shake table test results recorded by the SHM system installed on the bridge. The comparison results showed that the computed results and collapse process are compatible with the test results recorded by the SHM system. The SHM-based collapse prognosis proposed in this chapter is feasible and effective. An ideal SHM system installed on a bridge is useful in monitoring the loading conditions, updating the FE model, assessing the linear and nonlinear performance, and making collapse prognosis of the bridge. Two sets of SHM systems for the prototype RC bridge are established using two different methods. These systems have demonstrated significantly different results in terms of sensor location and sensor number. The SHM system that uses the multi-sensor placement method includes 16 strain gauges and 12 accelerometers, whereas the proposed SHM system includes 24 strain gauges and 10 accelerometers. The sensors of the strain gauge in the proposed SHM system are all placed in the failure-vulnerable components, such as the tower legs beneath the girder and the two south piers, whereas only several strain gauges in the current SHM system are placed on the girder, transverse beam, and stay cable. These differences can be attributed to the fact that the current SHM system is utilized to assess the linear performance of the bridge under service loadings, whereas the proposed SHM system is used to make a collapse prognosis of the RC bridge under seismic loadings. To demonstrate the difference of the current collapse analysis method and the proposed SHM-based collapse analysis method, an SHM-based collapse prognosis of the earthquake-damaged bridge was conducted. In reality, the damage condition of the bridge can be determined using the nonlinear model updating technique in Chapter 6 and the information that is acquired from the proposed SHM system installed on the bridge. In this way, the uncertainties in the FE model of the bridge can be eliminated and provide a critical support for the collapse prognosis. In this study, the damaged state was specified by conducting a nonlinear seismic analysis for absence of SHM system. For comparison, a collapse analysis of the prototype RC bridge is also conducted using the current collapse analysis method. The entire collapse processes from the two collapse analysis/prognosis methods are significantly different: (1) the seismic intensity used for the current collapse analysis method is larger than that used for the proposed SHM-based collapse prognosis method; and (2) the proposed method has detected a partial collapse in the southwest pier, whereas the current collapse analysis method has detected a partial collapse in the southeast pier. Therefore, the proposed SHM-based collapse prognosis is a promising method to prognosticate the behavior of the existing RC bridges under future earthquakes, whereas the current collapse analysis can be only used for the bridge at design stage.

40|$|One of the {{challenges}} associated with Eurocode 8 and AASHTO-LRFD is predicting the failure of irregular bridges supported by piers of unequal heights. EC 8 currently uses “moment demand-to-moment capacity” ratios to somewhat guarantee simultaneous failure of piers on bridges, while AASHTO-LRFD relies on the relative effective stiffness of the piers. These conditions are not entirely valid, in particular for piers with a relative height of 0. 5 or less, where a possible combination of <b>flexure</b> and shear <b>failure</b> mode may occur. In this case, the shorter piers often result in brittle shear failure, while the longer piers {{are most likely to}} fail due to flexure, creating a combination of different failure modes experienced by the bridge. To evaluate the adequacy of EC 8 design procedures for regular seismic behavior, various irregular bridges are simulated through a non-linear pushover analysis using shear-critical fiber-based beam-column elements. The paper investigates the behavior of irregular monolithic and bearing-type bridges experiencing different failure modes, and proposes different methods for regularizing the bridge performance to balance damage. The ultimate aim is to obtain a simultaneous or near-simultaneous failure of all piers irrespective of the different heights and failure mode experienced...|$|R

RasheedThere {{is a high}} need {{to repair}} or replace many bridges {{in the state of}} Kansas. 23 % of the bridges in Kansas are labeled {{structurally}} deficient or functionally obsolete. A majority of these bridges serve rural areas and are damaged due to overloading during harvest season. A state-of-the-art method of performing structural health monitoring on these bridges followed by an effective method of strengthening and repair was researched and presented in this thesis. The first phase of this research involved researching multiple devices to be used for state-of-the-art health monitoring. After deciding on an appropriate system, multiple tests were performed to determine the systems performance compared against conventional systems. The system was tested on a laboratory scale pre-stressed concrete T-beam. The system was tested on its ability to effectively record and transmit acceleration data. If this system were to be implemented on an actual bridge, KDOT could make a decision to repair or strengthen the bridge based on the results. The next phase of the research was to determine an effective strengthening procedure using carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP). Reinforced concrete beam specimens were cast and tested in the lab. The specimens consisted of rectangular and T-shaped cross-sections to create different failure modes when tested in bending. The primary issue when strengthening with CFRP is the issue of early separation failure when using CFRP in the longitudinal direction only. In an effort to prove this, the specimens were strengthened with five layers of CFRP and tested in four-point bending until failure. In an effort to prevent early separation failure, CFRP “U-wraps” were applied to provide shear resistance and additional anchorage for the flexural CFRP. The beams were then tested in <b>flexure</b> until <b>failure</b> by FRP rupture or concrete crushing followed by FRP rupture. The test results indicate that the U-wraps allowed the FRP to reach full capacity and fail in FRP rupture. The use of CFRP provided a strength increase of about 220 % over the control beam specimens while significantly reducing the ultimate deflection...|$|R

The variables in the study are: the quantity of shear reinforcement. In this investigation the deep beams were tested as simply supported beam having same shear span to effective depth (a / d) ratio. The spacing and area of shear reinforcement of deep beam was changed and the shear behavior of deep beam under loading studied. In this study, load deflection responses, crack pattern, modes of failure and shear strength are studied. The comparison of analytical (ACI 318) and experimental value of shear strength capacity of deep beam is done.

40|$|AbstractThe shear {{behavior}} of reinforced concrete wide beams was investigated. The experimental program consisted of nine beams of 29 MPa concrete strength tested with a shear span-depth ratio equal to 3. 0. One of the tested beams had no web reinforcement {{as a control}} specimen. The <b>flexure</b> mode of <b>failure</b> was secured {{for all of the}} specimens to allow for shear mode of failure. The key parameters covered in this investigation are the effect of the existence, spacing, amount and yield stress of the vertical stirrups on the shear capacity and ductility of the tested wide beams. The study shows that the contribution of web reinforcement to the shear capacity is significant and directly proportional to the amount and spacing of the shear reinforcement. The increase in the shear capacity ranged from 32 % to 132 % for the range of the tested beams compared with the control beam. High grade steel was more effective in the contribution of the shear strength of wide beams. Also, test results demonstrate that the shear reinforcement significantly enhances the ductility of the wide beams. In addition, shear resistances at failure recorded in this study are compared to the analytical strengths calculated according to the current Egyptian Code and the available international codes. The current study highlights the need to include the contribution of shear reinforcement in the Egyptian Code requirements for shear capacity of wide beams...|$|R
