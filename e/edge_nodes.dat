The micro data centers optimally don't require any overhead installations for cooling or no-break systems. The cooling of the servers is facilitated by sourcing cold water from the heat user, thus creating a synergy between different industries.Due to the minimised overhead, these nodes can be deployed in large quantities near or within network hubs for urban or office areas or even as part of a non-data center facility which can directly benefit from the reusable heat. This allows for fast network access and simple energy reuse.The micro <b>edge</b> <b>nodes</b> (10-100 kW) function as forward locations of the core data centers. The <b>edge</b> <b>nodes</b> provide services like data processing for IoT systems, data caching for digital content (YouTube, Netflix, etc.) and fast access to cloud services.

In this paper, for the first time, we investigate the triangle minimiza-tion problem in a network under <b>edge</b> (<b>node)</b> attack, where the attacker aims to minimize the number of triangles in the network by removing k <b>edges</b> (<b>nodes).</b> We show that the triangle minimization problem under <b>edge</b> (<b>node)</b> attack is a submodular function maxi-mization problem, which can be solved efficiently. Specifically, we propose a degree-based <b>edge</b> (<b>node)</b> removal algorithm and a near-optimal greedy <b>edge</b> (<b>node)</b> removal algorithm for approximately solving the triangle minimization problem under <b>edge</b> (<b>node)</b> attack. In addition, we introduce two pruning strategies and an approximate marginal gain evaluation technique to further speed up the greedy <b>edge</b> (<b>node)</b> removal algorithm. We conduct exten-sive experiments over 12 real-world datasets to evaluate the proposed algorithms, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency and scalability of our algorithms...|$|R

Given a weighted connected graph with distances on edges and weights on nodes, the k most vital <b>edges</b> (<b>nodes)</b> p-median (respectively p-center) problem consists of finding a subset of k <b>edges</b> (<b>nodes)</b> whose removal from the graph leads to an optimal solution for the p-median (respectively p-center) problem with the largest total weighted distance (respectively maximum weighted distance). The complementary problem, min <b>edge</b> (<b>node)</b> blocker p-median (respectively p-center), consists of removing a subset of <b>edges</b> (<b>nodes)</b> of minimum cardinality such that an optimal solution for the p-median (respectively p-center) problem has a total weighted distance (respectively a maximum weighted distance) at least {{as large as a}} specified threshold.

40|$|In this paper, the {{performance}} {{model for a}} lossless OBS <b>edge</b> <b>node</b> is built {{with respect to the}} queueing performance of the transmission buer. In contrast to the shaping eect of the burst assembly in the buerless <b>edge</b> <b>node,</b> in a lossless <b>edge</b> <b>node</b> the " eect of the assembly is more dominant and leads to a worse queueing performance in the transmission buer. We analyze the trac characteristic by means of the variance process and identify that there exists a negative correlation structure in the assembled burst trac in the small time scale, which resembles that of a CBR ow. Through the analysis of the relevant time scale, it is found that this small time scale trac behavior dominates the queueing performance in most cases and {{the performance}} of burst transmission buer can be well estimated by a corresponding ND/D/ 1 model. In the case of the self-similar input trac with large peakness and at a high system load, the tail behavior of large queue length becomes much worse and can be estimated by a Fractional Brownian Motion (FBM) model considering the large time scale trac behavior. Our performance model provides a simple but accurate analytical method for the performance evaluation and system design. ...|$|R

40|$|The term "agility" in optical {{networks}} {{describes the}} ability to deploy bandwidth on demand at fine granularity that allows carriers to provision and deploy services rapidly. An overlaid star all-photonic WDM network, called the Agile All-Photonic Network (AAPN), can provide such agility through multiplexing over each wavelength in the time domain. The AAPN consists {{of a number of}} hybrid photonic/electronic <b>edge</b> <b>nodes</b> connected together via a number of optical core nodes. Each of the core nodes consists of a number of buffer-less transparent photonic space switches, one for each wavelength, and links to all <b>edge</b> <b>nodes</b> via optical fibers. Each edge node aggregates traffic in buffers, segments it as slots (i. e. units), and transmits the slots in photonic form across the network. For bandwidth sharing, the core nodes are required to perform reconfiguration periodically according to the traffic demand information sent by the <b>edge</b> <b>nodes.</b> In this thesis, it is studied how the core nodes distribute the bandwidth to adapt to the traffic in the <b>edge</b> <b>nodes</b> and how the <b>edge</b> <b>nodes</b> perform routing in the AAPN so that the traffic is less congested and can reach the destination with short delay. For the former problem, the alternating projections method and the quick Birkhoff-von Neumann decomposition method are proposed which provide a simple and efficient bandwidth allocation scheme for the AAPN core nodes. For the second problem, a routing method is proposed which provides a trade-off between the delay and the blocking probability, i. e. the method improves the delay performance of the network dramatically under the low load while not affecting the blocking performance at high load...|$|E
