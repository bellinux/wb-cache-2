500|$|In one of {{his first}} interviews, Cobain told Sounds {{journalist}} John Robb, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> song the lyrics are the least important thing. I can go through two or three different subjects in a song and the title can mean absolutely nothing at all. Sometimes I try to make things harder for myself, just to try to make myself a bit more angry. I try out a few subconscious things I suppose, like conflicts with other people. Most of the lyrics on the Bleach album are about my life in Aberdeen." ...|$|E
500|$|Books and {{characters}} in the series were inspired by books and films. For example, the character Slappy the Dummy {{was inspired by the}} literary classic The Adventures of Pinocchio. Some of Stine's ideas for the books also came from real life; Stine got the idea for the book The Haunted Mask after his son, Matt, had a Halloween mask that he had trouble getting off. Stine also uses his childhood fears to help him write his books. The author said, [...] "Luckily, I have a great memory. As <b>I</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> story, I can remember {{what it feels like to}} be afraid and panicky". Stine states that he often thinks of a title to a novel first, then lets the title lead him to a story.|$|E

500|$|Fanning {{has stated}} that {{although}} political messages may be common throughout his and Powderfinger's music, {{it is not the}} central focus when writing songs: [...] "A balance has to be struck in a lot of ways, in the sense that primarily I'm a musician. I'm not a political commentator. So if <b>I</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> song that has political content, then hopefully that song is a good enough song to make it onto my record. And if it's not, then that's just a song that I've written. So I don't think it necessarily needs to be that you're definitively trying to make a political statement." [...] He {{has stated that}} he has no interest in [...] "doing a 'Peter Garrett'", who entered politics after a successful Midnight Oil career.|$|E
500|$|The {{speed and}} {{facility}} with which Dylan wrote topical songs {{attracted the attention}} of other musicians in the New York folk scene. In a radio interview on WBAI in June 1962, Pete Seeger described Dylan as [...] "the most prolific songwriter on the scene" [...] and then asked Dylan how many songs he had written recently. Dylan replied, [...] "I might go for two weeks without writing these songs. <b>I</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> lot of stuff. In fact, I wrote five songs last night but I gave all the papers away in some place called the Bitter End." [...] Dylan also expressed the impersonal idea that the songs were not his own creation. In an interview with Sing Out! magazine, Dylan said, [...] "The songs are there. They exist all by themselves just waiting for someone to write them down. I just put them down on paper. If I didn't do it, somebody else would." ...|$|E
500|$|CDs were {{submitted}} to Weiland containing music in completed demo form, including scratch melodies, which Weiland {{had the option}} to use or discard. Dean did not mind when his melodies were not accepted by Weiland. [...] "hen <b>I</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> song, I know what I {{want it to be}} melodically. But Scott always... knocks my melodies out of the water." [...] Weiland worked on the lyrics using these demo arrangements, often making suggestions for musical phrases to be doubled or moved. Weiland was credited for the lyrical melodies, but Robert pointed out, [...] "This record was made in a way that Scott wasn't really there for the creation of these songs, musically." [...] However, both Dean and Robert would be surprised at the direction Weiland would take the songs, which could have been composed with an entirely different vision. Robert found this to be a strength within the band. [...] "People always have this misconception that a band all need to think alike... so many different ways of looking at songs and [...] put together, and that's really the beauty of a great band".|$|E

500|$|Cobain usually wrote lyrics for songs {{minutes before}} {{recording}} them. Cobain said, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> song the lyrics {{are the least}} important subject. I can go through two or three different subjects in a song and the title can mean absolutely nothing at all". Cobain told Spin in 1993 that he [...] "didn't give a flying fuck" [...] what the lyrics on Bleach were about, figuring [...] "Let's just scream some negative lyrics {{and as long as}} they're not sexist and don't get too embarrassing it'll be okay", while the lyrics to Nevermind were taken from two years of poetry he had accumulated, which he cut up and chose lines he preferred from. In comparison, Cobain stated that the lyrics to In Utero were [...] "more focused, they're almost built on themes". Cobain didn't write necessarily in a linear fashion, instead relying on juxtapositions of contradictory images to convey emotions and ideas. Often in his lyrics, Cobain would present an idea then reject it; the songwriter explained, [...] "I'm such a nihilistic jerk half the time and other times I'm so vulnerable and sincere [...] like a mixture of both of them. That's how most people my age are".|$|E

2500|$|Composer Terry Riley {{describes}} how {{he works with}} the Kronos Quartet, an ensemble devoted to contemporary music: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> score for them, it's an unedited score. I put in just a minimal amount of dynamics and phrasing marks...we {{spend a lot of}} time trying out different ideas in order to shape the music, to form it. At the end of the process, it makes the performers actually own the music. [...] That to me is the best way for composers and musicians to interact." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1905, London {{purchased}} a [...] ranch in Glen Ellen, Sonoma County, California, {{on the eastern}} slope of Sonoma Mountain, for $26,450. He wrote: [...] "Next to my wife, the ranch is the dearest {{thing in the world}} to me." [...] He desperately wanted the ranch to become a successful business enterprise.

2500|$|The {{song was}} written for and {{recorded}} with Gainsbourg's girlfriend, Brigitte Bardot, in late 1967. Bardot asked him to write the most beautiful love song he could imagine and that night he wrote [...] "Je t'aime" [...] and [...] "Bonnie and Clyde". They recorded an arrangement of [...] "Je t'aime" [...] by Michel Colombier at a Paris studio in a two-hour session in a small glass booth; the engineer William Flageollet said there was [...] "heavy petting". However, news of the recording reached the press and Bardot's husband, German businessman Gunter Sachs, was angry and called for the single to be withdrawn. Bardot pleaded with Gainsbourg not to release it. [...] He complied but observed [...] "The music is very pure.

2500|$|... "I hear {{everything}} at once – melody, lyrics, {{it just comes}} in. There's a feeling that comes over me and I know that there's a song trying to come through. It's sort of like I'm taken over or someone's trying to contact me; I really believe very much that I'm in some ways channeling this thing. Because when <b>I</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> song it's always done very quickly, completed in 20minutes or maybe half an hour. I never labour anything, or very rarely. The only labouring I've ever done in songwriting might be when I've completed a work, a song, and {{there might be a}} couple of lyrics I don't like, so sometimes I might sit with those and really put some brain power in how to fix up the lines. But for the most part it comes to me, it comes in and I can hear the whole thing finished with harmonies and everything." [...] Graeham Goble (2001) ...|$|E
2500|$|... "For me, {{there will}} be days when <b>I</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> little poem in a little book, or make a little voice memo in my iPhone. For me, I need to be sitting at an {{instrument}} and be overwhelmed. I've tried {{to look back and}} see if a song just came out of a sunny day. [...] "Oh, today I'm going to write a song." [...] That's never been the case for me. It's always whether I'm just overwhelmed with some emotion. Whether it be I'm happy, I'm sad, I've fallen in love, I've fallen out of love. I'm lonely, I'm scared. Whatever it be that day. If I'm like a volcano and I'm about to explode, I better run to an instrument because it's about to come out. For me, I don't really go back. I probably should. I have a bajillion pieces of songs. But I seem to just write in one sitting. There's very few occasions where I've gone back and worked on songs later. Normally, I sit down, the song comes out and I'm done." ...|$|E
2500|$|Murakami's initial {{success with}} Hear the Wind Sing {{encouraged}} him to continue writing. A year later, he published a sequel, Pinball, 1973. In 1982, he published A Wild Sheep Chase, a critical success. Hear the Wind Sing, Pinball, 1973, and A Wild Sheep Chase form the Trilogy of the Rat (a sequel, Dance, Dance, Dance, was written later but is not {{considered part of the}} series), centered on the same unnamed narrator and his friend, [...] "the Rat." [...] The first two novels were not widely available in English translation outside Japan until 2015, although an English edition, translated by Alfred Birnbaum with extensive notes, had been published by Kodansha as part of a series intended for Japanese students of English. Murakami considers his first two novels to be [...] "immature" [...] and [...] "flimsy," [...] and has not been eager to have them translated into English. A Wild Sheep Chase, he says, was [...] "the first book where I could feel a kind of sensation, the joy of telling a story. When you read a good story, you just keep reading.

2500|$|Jack London State Historic Park, near Glen Ellen, California, is {{situated}} on the eastern slope of Sonoma Mountain. The namesake of this California State Park is author Jack London whose home, Wolf House, was located here. [...] The building, a sizable stone structure, was destroyed by fire and its picturesque ruins are protected within the state park. Sonoma Mountain had a significant influence on Jack London and his writings. In 1910 Jack London purchased this 1,000 acre (4km2) property, known as the Beauty Ranch, for $26,000. He wrote that [...] "Next to my wife, the ranch is the dearest {{thing in the world}} to me." [...] He wanted the establishment to become a successful business enterprise. Writing, always a commercial enterprise with London, now became even more a means to an end: [...] "I write for no other purpose than to add to the beauty that now belongs to me. <b>I</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> book {{for no other reason than}} to add three or four hundred acres to my magnificent estate." [...] The sloping terrain of the park has an access trail to reach the summit of Sonoma Mountain, although the final approach to the summit and the peak itself are not within the state park property.|$|E
2500|$|One author criticizes {{this theory}} as being [...] "problematic" [...] because [...] "Moroni {{makes it clear}} that he buried the plates in the {{vicinity}} of the Nephites' destruction, not [...] away in some remote region." [...] To support this assumption, it is postulated that Moroni buried the plates near the scene of the final battle and then returned 20 years later to retrieve them and add information to them before his final farewell, in which he states that his intention to [...] "seal up these records" [...] The assumption that Moroni hid the plates at the time of the final battle is based upon , in which Moroni states [...] "Therefore I will write and hide up the records in the earth; and whither I go it mattereth not." [...] Continued reading of the text reveals that Moroni abridged the Book of Ether and added it to the record after making this statement. Moroni later writes [...] "wherefore, I wander whithersoever I can for the safety of mine own life. Wherefore, <b>I</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> few more things, contrary to that which I had supposed; for I had supposed not to have written any more." [...] (...) There is no explicit mention in the Book of Mormon of Moroni either having hidden the plates at the time of the final battle or having returned to this location to add more to them years later.|$|E
2500|$|Wilson {{works out}} [...] "about a third" [...] of the {{finished}} arrangement of a song as he's writing it, leaving the rest to studio experimentation. As he writes in 1990: [...] "Making an instrumental track is a whole experience. It starts after you have written a song. As <b>I</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> song, I write some of the instrumental piano and pluck some of the different notes for the arrangement. It's impossible to lay the whole arrangement on the piano but you play just {{enough to get the}} overall feelin’ of the record. It is an art in itself. I always get that bigger picture of my records at my piano before I record them. I go in there prepared." [...] From the very beginning, Wilson handled most stages of the group's recording process, despite Nik Venet being credited for producing their early recordings. He preferred mixing live as performances were recorded, as opposed to mixing after the fact. He was open to changes suggested by others while recording, often taking advice and even incorporating apparent mistakes if they provided a useful or interesting alternative. On Surfin' U.S.A. (1963), Brian began doubletracking. As was practiced by other record producers from the 1960s, most of his mixes ended up in single-channel monaural, believing that varied stereo speaker placement took his control over the sound image away to the listener.|$|E
