40|$|An {{analysis}} of the firms funded by the IIF programme indicates that the programme is well focused and has provided material and relevant support to {{a significant number of}} early-stage enterprises from Australia’s science base. IIF supported portfolio firms {{are more likely to be}} early-stage investments, to be in receipt of <b>follow-on</b> <b>finance,</b> and to achieve a successful exit than comparator firms outside the IIF programme. However these supported firms are also more likely to fail than comparator firms in part because the programme focuses on genuinely early-stage and therefore risky firms. The programme has raised substantial finance for young and new knowledge based firms that would not have been available in the absence of this scheme. None the less, the VC funds supported have largely made modest returns which would not by itself attract long term private investment interest in Australia’s high technology entrepreneurs. The IIF Programme while important is unlikely to engender by itself a viable and flourishing VC industry in Australia. Thus, the objectives imposed on the programme are overly ambitious and do not reflect fully the highly challenging environment for early-stage VC investment across the developed world. In 2010 Professor Gordon Murray and his colleagues Professor Marc Cowling and Dr Weixi Liu were contracted by the Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research to undertake an econometric {{analysis of}} the Innovation Investment Fund (IIF) program...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Purpose – Entrepreneurial {{businesses}} often face {{financial and}} experiential gaps, which can constrain their growth. Business angels (BAs) can provide sources of financial, human and social capital {{to overcome these}} gaps. Building on the work by Munck and Saublens, this paper aims to introduce a framework that seeks to provide a detailed understanding of the benefits that BAs can bring to the firms in which they invest. Design/methodology/approach – In order to obtain a detailed understanding of the benefits that BAs bring to their investee companies, semi-structured, in-depth telephone interviews were conducted from an investee perspective. The key managers of nine angel-funded companies were purposefully selected and the transcribed interviews analysed {{with the help of}} common qualitative analysis techniques. Findings – According to investee managers, BAs provide benefits in all four areas of the proposed framework. Specifically, BAs: help overcome funding gaps; fill knowledge/experience gaps through provision of their own expertise and involvement; provide a wide range of contacts and leverage further funding, including their own <b>follow-on</b> <b>finance.</b> Research limitations/implications – The anonymous nature of the BA market requires convenience sampling, which, in addition to the small sample size used, does not allow for generalisability. The use of telephone interviews instead of face-to-face interviews did not allow for observation of non-verbal cues. Nevertheless, the study identified various areas in need of further research. Originality/value – In-depth interview data enabled a detailed exploration of the financial and non-financial benefits of BA funding from an under-utilised investee perspective. The paper's main value, however, lies in establishing the usefulness of a framework showing BAs' benefits in a structured manner...|$|E

40|$|In the bank-borrower setting, a firm 2 ̆ 7 s {{existing}} lender may exploit its positional {{advantage to}} extract rents {{from the firm}} in subsequent financings. Analogously, a startup 2 ̆ 7 s existing venture capital investors (VCs) may dilute the founder through a <b>follow-on</b> <b>financing</b> from these same VCs (an “inside” round) at an artificially low valuation. Using a hand-collected dataset of Silicon Valley startup firms, we find little evidence that VCs use inside rounds to dilute founders. Instead, {{our findings suggest that}} inside rounds are generally used as “backstop financing” for startups that cannot attract new money, and these rounds are conducted at relatively high valuations (perhaps to reduce litigation risk) ...|$|R
40|$|Using {{multiple}} longitudinal {{case studies}} of young biotechnology firms, we study differences in the financing process {{between high and low}} performing firms. Findings suggest that initial differences in the financing process, and more specifically differences in the specialization of the investors with whom entrepreneurs affiliate early on, affect the ease with which firms attract (specialized) <b>follow-on</b> <b>financing</b> and firm performance as a whole. We demonstrate the role of the social context in shaping initial financing decisions, as entrepreneurs limit their search for financing to one or a few investors with whom they have pre-existing ties. Additionally, our research provides a dynamic view of the financing process. We identify isolating mechanisms, including entrepreneurial learning and homophily and network considerations in investor syndication, which limit entrepreneurs when trying to adopt successful financing strategies implemented by competitors. A core contribution is that we theorize on evolutionary processes in the financing process. This new perspective on the financing process opens multiple avenues for future research...|$|R
40|$|The UK Labour Government has {{provided}} {{support for the}} establishment of regional venture capital funds in each of the English regions as part of its drive to create an entrepreneurially led knowledge- based economy. This initiative is a response to persistent gaps in the provision of start-up and early stage venture capital. In this paper we question the likely effectiveness of the initiative on four counts. First, {{there is a lack of}} early stage venture capital skills available to manage the funds. Second, the small size of the funds will make it difficult for them to achieve financial viability. Third, the funds are targeting the wrong problem. The maximum investment that they are allowed to make is £ 250, 000; they may subsequently provide up to an additional £ 250, 000 in <b>follow-on</b> <b>financing.</b> However, the main funding gap in the UK is in the £ 250, 000 to £ 1 million range. Finally, the proposal ignores the role of demand-side constraints in contributing to the equity gap. The paper concludes that a more comprehensive approach is required to address equity capital gaps at the regional level...|$|R
40|$|This {{report on}} World Bank project-financed {{research}} on population, health and nutrition (PHN) {{is based on}} a review of 109 staff appraisal reports for projects financed in fiscal years 1980 - 91 and on selected interviews with task managers. The report looks at only the simplest dimensions of project-financed research and examines research outcomes of only a few projects. Among conclusions tentatively reached: (1) more than 90 percent of PHN projects from fiscal years 1980 - 91 financed research. (2) Bank experience with project-financed research in the PHN sector has been extremely variable: quite successful in some countries and almost a total failure in others. Even so, some striking successes justify continued efforts to incorporate research into projects and to encourage use of that research to improve both national PHN policy and <b>follow-on</b> Bank <b>financed</b> projects. (3) Personalities make a difference, both among borrowers and within the Bank. Often successes are associated with a particular person within the government or the Bank who has taken a continuing personal interest in encouraging research. (4) Supervision is crucial to good results. Supervision must be frequent enough to keep the research component on time and of good quality. For quality research to be completed, it is important that those responsible for supervision attach a high priority to research even if it is not {{a large part of the}} project in terms of budget. (5) Research that leads to a project outcome - such as research needed to justify release of funds or for a follow-on project - is more likely to be undertaken and completed than is research with a more general objective. (6) In countries where the institutional capability exists, using a national institution to review research proposals and to administer research grants can be quite effective. Experience indicates that some sort of peer-group review produces better research. (7) There is probably room for more best-practices workshops where PHN staff can exchange experiences about successful design and supervision of project-financed research components. But usually it will be necessary to retain experienced consultants to help design substantial research components. (8) More systematic collection and dissemination of project-financed research is justified, given the considerable amounts of money and effort devoted to it.
