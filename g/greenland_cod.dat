40|$|Abstract. Two great transitions, from {{seal hunting}} to cod fishing, then from cod fishing to shrimp, {{affected}} population centers of southwest Greenland during the 20 th century. These economic tran-sitions reflected large-scale {{shifts in the}} underlying marine ecosystems, driven by interactions between climate and human resource use. The combination of climatic variation and fishing pres-sure, for example, proved fatal to west <b>Greenland’s</b> <b>cod</b> fishery. We examine the history of these transitions, using data down {{to the level of}} individual municipalities. At this level, the uneven social consequences of environmental change show clearly: some places gained, while others lost. De-velopments in 20 th-century Greenland resemble patterns of human-environment interactions in the medieval Norse settlements, suggesting some general propositions relevant to the human dimensions of climatic change. 1...|$|R

It is a commercially harvested food fish, but landings have been greatly reduced in recent years.|$|E
50|$|Because the {{majority}} of Greenland is covered by permanent glaciers, the sea is the source for most food. Seafood dishes include various fishes (often smoked), mussels, and shrimp. Ammassat or capelin, a fish in the salmon family is commonly eaten and can easily be dried.

40|$|Abstract. —The genetic {{variation}} among 17 spawning groups of Atlantic herring Clupea harengus was assessed at several {{temporal and spatial}} scales using nine tetranucleotide microsatellites. Pan-Atlantic samples were drawn from the Scotian Shelf, the Celtic Sea, the Baltic Sea, and coastal Iceland. Significant differentiation was observed between northeastern and northwestern Atlantic herring (FST; 0. 065) and among northwestern Atlantic spawning groups (max FST 5 0. 014) at the spatial scale of the Scotian Shelf. Geographic distance among Scotian Shelf collections did not explain the pattern of genetic differentiation observed (e. g., lack of isolation by distance). The temporal proximity of collections (as measured by days between collections) explained 30 % of the pairwise population differentiation (P 5 0. 0025). Allele frequencies of replicate samples and year-class analyses demonstrate temporal stability at four locations. Atlantic herring Clupea harengus is found in most shelf regions of the northern Atlantic Ocean and several adjacent inland seas.

40|$|This {{report is}} the {{culmination}} of work supported in the past by the Saltonstall-Kennedy Fund and the NMFS Auke Bay Laboratory (ABL). Support from NPRB allowed us to substantially increase sample sizes (from about 700 to more than 1200) with collections targeted to address specific questions about distribution, catch incidence, and coloration. The project was initiated by our discovery of two genetically distinct forms of rougheye rockfish (Sebastes aleutianus). The rougheye rockfish is a commercially valuable species caught in Alaskan longline and trawl fisheries. They are targeted by fishermen when possible, and often harvested to the maximum level allowed in incidental catch guidelines. Rougheye and shortraker rockfish (S. borealis) have been combined for fisheries management and together contribute to bycatch of fisheries for other species, particularly Pacific ocean perch, Atka mackerel, <b>Greenland</b> turbot, Pacific <b>cod,</b> sablefish, and halibut. Populations of rougheye and shortraker rockfish are quite sensitive to overharvest and slow to rebuild, as are populations of most long-lived species. Consequently, groundfish management pays careful attention to abundance assessments...|$|R

In late autumn and early winter, belugas move to the centre of the Sound, diving to depths of 300 m or more to feed on deep-water species such as Greenland halibut. Local hunters also report that belugas at the floe-edge in spring prey mainly on Arctic cod and turbot under the ice.

The <b>Greenland</b> <b>cod</b> trypsin was shown to be homogeneous by analytical polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and also by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Although certain properties of <b>Greenland</b> <b>cod</b> trypsin were similar to those of bovine trypsin there were also some {{significant differences between the two}} trypsins. [...] <b>Greenland</b> <b>cod</b> trypsin and bovine trypsin were alike with respect to various criteria. The pH activity profile of <b>Greenland</b> <b>cod</b> trypsin was similar to that of bovine trypsin. Likewise the amino acid composition of <b>Greenland,</b> <b>cod</b> trypsin revealed that it was rich in potential acidic amino acid residues as has been reported for trypsin from bovine and other sources. The <b>Greenland</b> <b>cod</b> trypsin was similar to bovine trypsin in being able to hydrolyze ester and amide linkages involving the carboxyl group of arginine. The two trypsins were both inhibited by phenyl methyl sulfonyl fluoride, trasylol and soybean trypsin inhibitor and also by the thiol reagents. 2 -mercaptoethanol and dithioerythritol, and were both effective in preventing milk oxidation induced by copper. The molecular weight of <b>Greenland</b> <b>cod</b> trypsin, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, was similar to values reported for tripsin from bovine and other sources. [...] The <b>Greenland</b> <b>cod</b> trypsin differed from bovine trypsin in the following respects : the <b>Greenland</b> <b>cod</b> trypsin was most stable at alkaline pH, unlike bovine tripsin which was stable at acid pH; the <b>Greenland</b> <b>cod</b> trypsin was heat abile while bovine trypsin was heat stable. The temperature coefficients and activation energies for the hydrolysis of amide, ester and protein subtrates were considerably lower for <b>Greenland</b> <b>cod</b> trypsin than bovine trypsin. The apparent Michaelis-Menten constants (Km') and molecular activities for the hydrolysis of substrates were considerably higher for the cod enzyme than the bovine enzyme. Based on the amino acid compositions, the calculated average hydrophobicity of <b>Greenland</b> <b>cod</b> trypsin was considerably lower than that of bovine trypsin and the cod enzyme contained fewer cysteine residues than bovine trypsin. <b>Greenland</b> <b>cod</b> trypsin activity was depressed to a greaterextent by thiol reagents than that of bovine trypsin.

40|$|It is {{commonly}} acknowledged that body {{weight of fish}} is {{a key factor in}} determining market value of landed catch, thus influencing optimal harvest strategies. However, in management strategy evaluations and bioeconomic modelling body size is often an overlooked economic parameter, and there are no systematic studies on prevalence of size-dependent pricing. Here we assess the presence and magnitude of size-dependent pricing in ex-vessel prices of fish in Norwegian fisheries. The data encompass landings of four pelagic and four demersal stocks in Norway in 2000 - 2010. Linear mixed models and generalized additive models were used to determine the dependence of unit price on weight class as well as on total yield and time (year). The results show a significant positive relationship between weight class and price for seven out of the eight examined fish stocks. The relative effect of body weight on price was the strongest for <b>cod,</b> <b>Greenland</b> halibut, Norwegian spring-spawning herring and mackerel, lesser for North Sea herring and saithe, and negligible for horse mackerel. These findings demonstrate that size-dependent pricing is common in Norwegian fisheries, and is therefore of high relevance for resource economics and fisheries management...|$|R
