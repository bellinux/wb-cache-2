5|$|Phase-contrast X-ray imaging (Fig.26) {{refers to}} a variety of {{techniques}} that use phase information of a coherent x-ray beam to image soft tissues. (For an elementary discussion, see Phase-contrast x-ray imaging (introduction). For a more in-depth review, see Phase-contrast X-ray imaging.) It has become an important method for visualizing cellular and histological structures {{in a wide range of}} biological and medical studies. There are several technologies being used for x-ray phase-contrast imaging, all utilizing different principles to convert phase variations in the x-rays emerging from an object into intensity variations. These include propagation-based phase contrast, talbot interferometry, moiré-based <b>far-field</b> interferometry, refraction-enhanced imaging, and x-ray interferometry. These methods provide higher contrast compared to normal absorption-contrast x-ray imaging, making it possible to see smaller details. A disadvantage is that these methods require more sophisticated equipment, such as synchrotron or microfocus x-ray sources, x-ray optics, or high resolution x-ray detectors.|$|E
25|$|Two {{types of}} {{diffraction}} are distinguished, {{depending upon the}} separation between the source and the screen: Fraunhofer diffraction or <b>far-field</b> diffraction at large separations and Fresnel diffraction or near-field diffraction at close separations.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, E. R. Eliel {{presented}} an experimental and theoretical {{study of the}} optical transmission of a thin metal screen perforated by two subwavelength slits, separated by many optical wavelengths. The total intensity of the <b>far-field</b> double-slit pattern is shown to be reduced or enhanced {{as a function of}} the wavelength of the incident light beam.|$|E
40|$|Scattering {{problems}} by a penny-shaped crack are solved using a time-domain boundary integral equation method, The crack {{is located in}} an infinite homogeneous, isotropic, linearly elastic solid, and is subjected to an oblique incident wave of either P-, SV-, or SH-wave, The hypersingular integral equation is solved to obtain near-field solutions as well as scattered <b>far-fields.</b> The accuracy of the present method is confirmed by comparing the near-field solutions for different arrangement of elements, Scattered <b>far-fields</b> are calculated for various incident waves, and their usefulness in quantitative non-destructive evaluation is discussed...|$|R
30|$|The {{fragility}} curves {{can be used}} {{to evaluate}} potential losses of bridges with the same typology of the analyzed structure. The results showed that <b>far-fields</b> seismic records dominated, while the impact of the near-fields earthquake data bases is reduced.|$|R
40|$|A MUSIC-type imaging {{technique}} is {{proposed for the}} reconstruction of thin, curve-like penetrable inclusions in a homogeneous space. It {{is based on an}} appropriate asymptotic formula of the scattering amplitude, here assuming planar excitations. Operating at a fixed non-zero frequency, it yields the shape of the inclusion from scattered <b>far-fields</b> in addition to estimates of the length of the supporting curve. Numerical experiments exhibit how the proposed technique behaves...|$|R
25|$|Grating-based imaging (GBI) {{includes}} Shearing interferometry or X-ray Talbot interferometry (XTI), and polychromatic <b>far-field</b> interferometry (PFI). Since {{the first}} X-ray grating interferometer—consisting of two phase gratings and an analyzer crystal—was built, various slightly different setups for this method have been developed; {{in the following}} the focus lies on the nowadays standard method consisting of a phase grating and an analyzer grating. (See figure to the right).|$|E
25|$|Far field methods achieve longer ranges, often {{multiple}} kilometer ranges, {{where the}} distance {{is much greater}} than the diameter of the device(s). The main reason for longer ranges with radio wave and optical devices is the fact that electromagnetic radiation in the <b>far-field</b> can be made to match the shape of the receiving area (using high directivity antennas or well-collimated laser beams). The maximum directivity for antennas is physically limited by diffraction.|$|E
25|$|The {{impedance}} {{seen at the}} feedpoint of a dipole {{of various}} lengths has been plotted above, {{in terms of the}} real (resistive) component Rdipole and the imaginary (reactive) component jXdipole of that impedance. For the case of an antenna with perfect conductors (no ohmic loss), Rdipole is identical to the radiation resistance, which can more easily be computed from the total power in the <b>far-field</b> radiation pattern for a given applied current as we showed for the short dipole. The calculation of Xdipole is more difficult.|$|E

Ideally, near-fields and ventricular <b>far-fields</b> ought to be distinguished by beat-to-beat template analysis of the atrial signal.

40|$|We {{consider}} an inverse spectral theory in a domain with the cavity that is bounded by a penetrable inhomogeneous medium. An ODE system is constructed piecewise through the solutions {{inside and outside}} the cavity. The ODE system is connected to the PDE system via the analytic continuation. For each scattered angle, we describe its eigenvalue density in the complex plane, and prove an inverse uniqueness on the inhomogeneity by the measurements in the <b>far-fields...</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{breakthrough}} in nano-FTIR {{came upon the}} development of high-power broadband mid-IR laser sources, which provided large spectral irradiance in a sufficiently large bandwidth (mW-level power in ~1000cm-1 bandwidth) and enabled truly broadband nanoscale-resolved material spectroscopy capable of detecting even the weakest vibrational resonances. Particularly, {{it has been shown}} that nano-FTIR is capable of measuring molecular fingerprints which match well with <b>far-field</b> FTIR spectra, owing to the asymmetry of the nano-FTIR spectrometer that provides phase and thus gives access to the molecular absorption. Recently, the first nanoscale-resolved infrared hyperspectral imaging of a co-polymer blend was demonstrated, which allowed for the application of statistical techniques such as multivariate analysis – a widely used tool for heterogeneous sample analysis.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} the {{collision}} are felt far beyond the immediate site of collision and mountain-building. As convergence between the two continents continues, the region of crustal thickening and elevation will become broader. If there is an oceanic free face, the adjacent crustal blocks may move towards it. As an example of this, the collision of India with Asia forced large regions of crust to move south to form modern Southeast Asia. Another example is the collision of Arabia with Asia, which is squeezing the Anatolian Plate (present day Turkey). As a result, Turkey is moving west and south into the Mediterranean Sea {{and away from the}} collision zone. These <b>far-field</b> effects may result in the formation of rifts, and rift valleys such as that occupied by Lake Baikal, the deepest lake on Earth.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, the {{diffraction}} of C60 fullerenes {{by researchers}} from the University of Vienna was reported. | journal = Nature | volume = 401 | pages = 680–682 | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v401/n6754/abs/401680a0.html | doi = 10.1038/44348 | pmid = 18494170 | issue = 6754 | bibcode=1999Natur.401..680A}} Fullerenes are comparatively large and massive objects, having an atomic mass of about 720 u. The de Broglie wavelength of the incident beam was about 2.5pm, whereas {{the diameter of the}} molecule is about 1nm, about 400 times larger. In 2012, these <b>far-field</b> diffraction experiments could be extended to phthalocyanine molecules and their heavier derivatives, which are composed of 58 and 114 atoms respectively. In these experiments the build-up of such interference patterns could be recorded in real time and with single molecule sensitivity.|$|E

The positive P 14 and negative N 18 scalp <b>far-fields</b> were preserved. The results suggest that P 14 reflects the spike volley in caudal medial lemniscus, and that the N 18 neural generators {{are located in the}} medulla, probably in the dorsal column nuclei and/or the accessory inferior olives.

40|$|In this paper, {{the effect}} of optimum finite element grids around crack tips in {{bilinear}} elastoplastic materials is addressed. The optimum meshes around singularities for elastic materials are proved to give also the best meshes for cases where bilinear elastoplastic laws are {{used to describe the}} overall material behavior.

40|$|We {{report the}} first room {{temperature}} CW operation of two dimensional single-mode edge-emitting photonic crystal Bragg lasers. Single-mode lasing with single-lobed, diffraction limited <b>far-fields</b> is obtained for 100 μm wide and 550 μm long on-chip devices. We also demonstrate the tuning of the lasing wavelength {{by changing the}} transverse lattice constant of the photonic crystal. This enables a fine wavelength tuning sensitivity (change of the lasing wavelength/change of the lattice constant) of 0. 072. This dependence proves that the lasing mode is selected by the photonic crystal lattice...|$|R
25|$|The grating {{fabrication}} {{challenge was}} eased {{by the discovery}} of a phase moiré effect which provides an all-phase-grating interferometer that works with compact sources, called the polychromatic <b>far-field</b> interferometer (see figure on the right). Phase gratings are easier to make when compared with the source and analyzer gratings mentioned above, since the grating depth required to cause phase shift is much less than what is needed to absorb x-rays. Phase gratings of 200 - 400 nanometer periods have been used to improve phase sensitivity in table-top PFI imagers. In PFI a phase grating is used to convert the fine interference fringes into a broad intensity pattern at a distal plane, based on the phase moiré effect. Besides higher sensitivity, another incentive for smaller grating periods is that the lateral coherence of the source needs to be at least one grating period.|$|E
2500|$|For a {{fundamental}} Gaussian beam the integral of the Gouy phase from the <b>far-field</b> through the waist to the <b>far-field</b> is -π. [...] This results in inversion of {{a signal that}} has passed through the waist, that corresponds to the inversion obtained with the ray-tracing approximation (Geometrical Optics).|$|E
2500|$|In the <b>far-field</b> / Fraunhofer region, {{this becomes}} the spatial Fourier {{transform}} of the aperture distribution. [...] Huygens' principle {{when applied to}} an aperture simply says that the <b>far-field</b> diffraction pattern is the spatial Fourier transform of the aperture shape, {{and this is a}} direct by-product of using the parallel-rays approximation, which is identical to doing a plane wave decomposition of the aperture plane fields (see Fourier optics).|$|E
40|$|In this paper, monopoles {{serving as}} models for air traffic control (ATC) antennas {{installed}} on an airframe are analyzed using physical optics (PO) and multi-level fast multipole methods (MLFMM). The results using both techniques are shown and commented in the paper. Characteristics like <b>far-fields</b> and surface current density, excited on the airframe where the antenna is placed on, are shown in order {{to point out the}} differences between both simulations. Good agreement is found between the MLFMM predictions and the experiments. Details regarding the discretization of the airframe are given and commented...|$|R

We expand the solution {{in a series of}} one-dimensional problems in the <b>far-fields.</b> We define an ODE by restricting the PDE along a fixed scattered direction. Accordingly, we obtain a Sturm-Liouville problem for each scattered direction. There exists the correspondence between the ODE spectrum and the PDE spectrum.

40|$|A hybrid {{evaluation}} method using both the spectral- and the spatial-domain techniques is {{proposed for the}} evaluation of the Summer-feld-type integrals resulting from the full-wave analysis of microstrip structures. This method combines the advantages of the spectral-domain {{for the evaluation of}} near fields and the spatial-domain method for the evaluation of <b>far-fields.</b> This method is simple and needs no additional formulations. It also provides an easy alternative method to handle the inefficiency of calculation with the singularity of the Green 2 ̆ 7 s function.

However, the use of <b>far-field</b> communication technologies like that of AM radios can also be used for side-channel attacks, although no key extraction methods for <b>far-field</b> signal analysis have been demonstrated. Therefore, a rough characterization of potential adversaries using this attack range from highly educated individuals to low to medium funded cartels.

40|$|We {{consider}} the inverse scattering {{theory of the}} Schrödinger equation. The inverse problem is to identify the potential scatterer by the scattered waves measured in the <b>far-fields.</b> In some micro/nanostructures, it is impractical to measure the phase information of the scattered wave field emitted from the source. We study the asymptotic behavior of the scattering amplitudes/intensity from the linearization theory of the scattered wave fields. The inverse uniqueness of the scattered waves is reduced to the inverse uniqueness of the analytic function.

The boundary value problem is defined by assigning a complex-valued source coordinate in the spherical-multipole expansion of the field due to a Hertzian dipole {{in the presence of the}} PEC circular cone. Since the incident CSB field can be interpreted as a localized plane wave illuminating the tip, the classical exact tip scattering problem can be analysed by an eigenfunction expansion without having the convergence problems in case of a full plane wave incident field.

40|$|An {{analytical}} approach {{to analyze the}} diffraction of an arbitrarily directed complex-source beam (CSB) by an acoustically soft or hard semi-infinite circular cone is presented. The beam is generated by assigning a complex-valued location to a point source; its waist and direction are defined by the real and imaginary parts of the source coordinate, respectively. The corresponding scalar boundary-value problem is solved by a spherical-multipole analysis. The solution requires the calculation of associated Legendre functions of the first kind for complex-valued arguments {{which turns out to}} be a non-trivial task. Beside a numerical analysis of the corresponding algorithms we present numerical results for the total near- and scattered <b>far-fields...</b>|$|R
