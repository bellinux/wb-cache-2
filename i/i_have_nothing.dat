The remaining questions of demobilization, disarmament, and the negotiations with the soldiers councils can be handled by my chief of staff; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> more to do. I shall remain pro forma in command for a short time, otherwise, I am dead tired.|$|E

25|$|The Bureau’s {{creation}} became controversial on Capitol Hill. In December 1920, a U.S. House appropriations subcommittee questioned Van Winkle and District Commissioner Charles W. Kutz. Subcommittee members Rep. George Tinkham (a Republican from Massachusetts) (and Rep. Thomas U. Sisson, a Democrat from Mississippi) objected that Congress had {{not specifically}} appropriated {{funds for a}} bureau of policewomen. Colonel Kutz responded that Congress had specifically appropriated funds for police officers, and “there {{is nothing in the}} law that requires that policemen shall be of the male sex.” During the hearing, Tinkham, an opponent of women’s suffrage, asked Van Winkle dozens of questions. When asked why she was doing this work, she replied, “because <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> else to do; it is my job in life.” Ultimately, the Subcommittee did not withhold the Bureau’s appropriation.|$|E
25|$|While {{recording}} {{his second}} solo album after collaborating on Le Petit Prince, Sébastien attended an audition for the musical The Sun King. While waiting, he met Geraldine Larrosa, (Innocence) and her then-partner Carlos Marín, {{who spoke to}} him after hearing Sébastien sing in online videos. Carlos said it was worth a try, so Sébastien went to the Bastille in Paris, where the auditions were being held by Sonny Takhar.

25|$|My dad was not {{the monster}} my lying brother said he was; he was strict, but my father never beat us black and blue, and my brother Gary was a vicious, no-good liar for saying so. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> but fond {{memories}} of Dad, going to studios with him, family vacations at our cabin in Idaho, boating and fishing with him. To my dying day, I'll hate Gary for dragging Dad's name through the mud. He wrote Going My Own Way out of greed. He wanted to make money and knew that humiliating our father and blackening his name {{was the only way}} he could do it. He knew it would generate a lot of publicity. That was {{the only way he could}} get his ugly, no-talent face on television and in the newspapers. My dad was my hero. I loved him very much. He loved all of us too, including Gary. He was a great father.|$|E

500|$|Part of Kavner's {{contract}} {{says that}} she will never have to promote The Simpsons on video and she rarely performs Marge's voice in public because she believes it [...] "destroys the illusion.

And <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> {{to do with my}} character's movement." [...] Nancy Cartwright, who voices Bart Simpson, said in her book My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy that Kavner is [...] "a workhorse of an actor" [...] with [...] "extraordinary professionalism and quiet work ethic", and notes that she is rarely late for recording sessions.|$|E

500|$|Rossen {{was already}} ill {{when he started}} on his final film, Lilith (1964), and it was poorly {{received}} in the United States.

In response, Angel released a statement confirming that the dress was designed by Stefani for L.A.M.B. to wear and be auctioned off at the amfAR gala, adding, [...] "I'm disappointed that the focus has shifted away from what Gwen and I originally intended, which was to create a custom outfit for a great cause.

500|$|Not {{long after}} the [...] "Friday" [...] video went viral on YouTube, Black and her mother, Georgina Kelly, got into legal issues with Ark Music over rights to the song. In a March 29, 2011 letter from Kelly's lawyer to Ark Music, it was alleged that Ark Music failed to fulfill the terms of their November 2010 {{agreement}} by not giving her the song and video's master recordings, by claiming Black as exclusively signed to the label, and by exploiting the song without permission – for example, selling a [...] "Friday" [...] ringtone. While Wilson stated that Kelly [...] "will get the masters and the song ... hey can have it all", and agreed that Black was not exclusive to Ark, his attorney claimed that Ark owns the copyright for the song and the November agreement is invalid. In June 2011, Ark Music Factory started charging $2.99 to watch the music video on YouTube.
