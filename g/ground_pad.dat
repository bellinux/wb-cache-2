40|$|Journal {{compilation}} © 2008 Royal Australasian College of SurgeonsBackground: Bimodal electric tissue ablation {{is a novel}} variation {{to standard}} radiofrequency ablation that produces significantly larger ablations {{by the addition of}} a direct electrical current. The negative electrode is attached to the radiofrequency current and the positive electrode is placed nearby. It has been identified that an electrolytic injury can occur at the positive electrode site. It is suggested that by increasing the surface area that is in contact with the positive electrode, the risk of tissue injury is reduced. This hypothesis was tested in a pig model. Methods: Thirty-six ablations were carried out in the livers of six pigs (six ablations per pig). Two were standard radiofrequency ablation controls and two were carried out with positive electrode attached to a scalpel blade. Two were carried out with positive electrode attached to a <b>grounding</b> <b>pad.</b> After 48 h, liver was harvested and the ablation sizes were compared. Skin biopsies were taken from the scalpel site and one from the pad site and examined histopathologically. Results: The scalpel blade ablations were significantly larger than controls and the <b>grounding</b> <b>pad</b> ablations (P < 0. 001). The <b>grounding</b> <b>pad</b> ablation was significantly larger than controls. The scalpel blade skin site showed full-thickness tissue injury. The <b>grounding</b> <b>pad</b> site appeared microscopically normal. Conclusion: By increasing the surface area that connects to the positive electrode, significantly larger ablations can be carried out while minimizing the risk of associated tissue injury.

40|$|The driving {{actions of}} rainfall-runoff {{process can be}} {{attributed}} to two aspects. The first is the influence of precipitation process, and the second is that of the <b>ground</b> <b>pad.</b> The research results of 179 indoor experiments conducted to imitate rainfall-runoff process indicate that both precipitation duration and intensity play important roles in affecting confluence lag time, which is obviously inconsistent with the traditional hypotheses. The nonlinear relationship is of great significance to the confluence curve especially when the precipitation duration is less than the total confluence time or the precipitation intensity is small. Therefore it can be concluded that the unit hydrograph (UH) can be applied to rainfall-runoff process imitation in the humid areas in the south China region. However, the UH application should be strictly modified in accordance with precipitation conditions in the arid and semiarid region of north China where the precipitation duration is short and the intensity is unstable. It will be hard to get ideal imitation results if the UH is applied blindly without considering specific conditions in the north China region. This also explains the unsatisfactory imitation results caused by using various hydrological models in the north China region. When the precipitation duration is short, and the watershed has not reached total watershed concentration, the characteristics of confluence change greatly, which reflects the actual situation in the north China region. Therefore necessary nonlinear corrections should be made when UH is applied. If the duration is longer than the total confluence time and the balance between pondage and discharge is stricken, the imitation research results will be applicable to both rainfall-runoff relation with longer duration in the south China region and the basic theoretical research on runoff generation and concentration. On conditions of adequate rainfall, peak discharge is in linear relationship with intensity, but {{has nothing to do with}} the <b>ground</b> <b>pad.</b> There is a negative linear relationship between intensity and time to peak. The amount of pondage capacity in a catchment is in linear relationship with intensity and peak discharge, with obvious influence by the <b>ground</b> <b>pad</b> status and interception, and it has nothing to do with the position of interceptions.

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} the simulation of the thermal and electrical pro-cesses, {{involved in the}} radio-frequency (RF) ablation procedure. RF ab-lation is a low invasive technique {{for the treatment of}} hepatic tumors, utilizing AC current to destroy the tumor cells by heating. The procedure consists of inserting an RF probe in the patients liver and attaching a <b>ground</b> <b>pad</b> to the skin. After that the AC current is initiated and main-tained for a prescribed duration. We have conducted experiments with a pork liver and an RF ablation apparatus capable of measuring and recording some of the procedure parameters. Those include the applied power, the effective electrical impedance, and the temperature around the tip of the probe. A history of the values at each second of the test is obtained at the end. Our aim is to adjust the material properties and other model param-eters for the simulation to fit the experimentally obtained results. The electrical conductivity of the tissue can be deduced from the measured power and impedance. After that, we need to determine suitable heat conductivity and capacity coefficients. This is achieved via temperature curves comparison. ...|$|E
40|$|Pegasus is a satellite-launching {{space rocket}} {{dropped from a}} B 52 carrier {{aircraft}} instead of launching vertically from a <b>ground</b> <b>pad.</b> Its three-year, privately-funded accelerated development was carried out under a demanding design-to-nonrecurring cost methodology, which imposed unique requirements on its flight test program, such as {{the decision not to}} drop an inert model from the carrier aircraft; the number and type of captive and free-flight tests; the extent of envelope exploration; and the decision to combine test and operational orbital flights. The authors believe that Pegasus may be the first vehicle where constraints in the number and type of flight tests to be carried out actually influenced the design of the vehicle. During the period November 1989 to February of 1990 a total of three captive flight tests were conducted, starting with a flutter clearing flight and culminating in a complete drop rehearsal. Starting on April 5, 1990, two combination test/operational flights were conducted.

50|$|Burns from {{electrocautery}} generally {{arise from}} a faulty <b>grounding</b> <b>pad</b> or from {{an outbreak of}} a fire. Monopolar electrocautery works because radio frequency energy is concentrated by the surgical instrument's small surface area. The electrical circuit is completed by passing current through the patient's body to a conductive pad that is connectd to the radio frequency generator. Because the pad's surface area is large relative to the instrument's tip, energy density across the pad is reliably low enough that no tissue injury occurs at the pad site. Electrical shocks and burns are possible, however, if the circuit is interrupted or energy is concentrated in some way. This can happen if the pad surface in contact is small, e.g. if the pad's electrolytic gel is dry, if the pad becomes disconnected from the radio frequency generator, or via a metal implant. Modern electrocautery systems are equipped with sensors to detect high resistance in the circuit that can prevent some injuries.|$|R

40|$|AbstractBiopotential is an {{electrochemical}} potential {{that has been}} shown to correlate well with the coagulation zone size during cardiac RF catheter ablation. We designed an in vivo experiment to test the hypothesis that a similar correlation exists during hepatic RF ablation. We created coagulation zones, in vivo, in porcine liver, with 17 gauge needle electrodes, using RF ablation (n= 56). The power was set constant at 30 W, controlled by impedance, and applied for 60, 120 or 180  s. We measured the biopotential between the electrode and the <b>ground</b> <b>pad</b> with low-pass filtering. The diameter and volume of the coagulation zone were measured and correlated with the change in biopotential between {{the beginning and end of}} each ablation procedure. Moderate correlation between biopotential change and both coagulation zone volume (R 2 = 0. 43) and diameter (R 2 = 0. 31) was observed. The time constant of the biopotential change was not significantly different from the time constant of the ablation zone diameter (36. 6 s, p= 0. 93); the biopotential may, therefore, predict the time course of the ablation zone diameter. The biopotential can potentially be used for intraprocedural monitoring of the progression of the thermal damage zone. It may also allow termination of the procedure, if it can be confirmed that the biopotential reliably correlates with the cessation of ablation zone expansion...|$|E

The circular electrodes involve a concentric design (Fig.  1 b), consisting of inner disks (150 or 125  μm in radius) surrounding by open-ended rings (inner radius: 200  μm, outer radius: 300  μm). The interdigitated electrodes incorporate 8 (upper digit) or 7 (bottom digit) fingers each with dimensions of 20  ×  50  μm 2 and spacings of 20  μm. The meander electrodes involve {{two sets of}} four semicircular lines (radii: 30, 90, 150, and 210  μm, width: 20  μm) and two 60 ° and 150 ° arc lines (radii: 310 and 270  μm, width: 20  μm) interconnected into spiral shapes. In {{each of these three}} cases, the electrodes connect to corresponding bonding pads (width: 500  μm, spacing: 500  μm) and a common <b>ground</b> <b>pad</b> through serpentine traces (width 50  μm; ~ 225  μm radii of curvature). The floating ground plates consists of 600  ×  600  μm 2 pads situated above the reference electrodes and connected with serpentine traces through vias in the PI (230  ×  230  μm 2 in dimension). The use of different electrode designs in a single device allows us to assess various hydration sensing methods and sensor parameters under the same experimental conditions. The meander electrodes perform as resistors, which can be used for assessment of skin hydration through purely resistivity measurement. The other electrodes measure both resistance and capacitance changes. The circular electrodes offer symmetries that facilitate theoretical analysis; these geometries are also found in macroscale electrodes used in CMM [22, 23], to enable direct comparison.|$|E
