In this paper we study data generated by pseudo-random computer experiments operating according to particular <b>internal</b> <b>protocols.</b> We show that the standard statistical analysis performed on a sample, containing 100000 data points or more, may sometimes be highly misleading and statistical errors largely underestimated. Our results confirm in a dramatic way the dangers of standard asymptotic statistical inference if a sample is not homogenous. We demonstrate that analyzing various subdivisions of samples by multiple chi-square tests and chi-square frequency graphs is very effective in detecting sample inhomogeneity. Therefore to assure correctness of the statistical inference the above mentioned chi-square tests and other non-parametric sample homogeneity tests should be incorporated in any statistical analysis of experimental data. If such tests are not performed the reported conclusions and estimates of the errors cannot be trusted. Comment: Accepted for publication in Computer Physics Communication...|$|R

In our theory, polymorphism accounts for the exchange of abstract communication protocols and dynamic instantiation of heterogeneous interfaces, as opposed to the exchange of data types and dynamic instantiation of individual message types. Our polymorphic session-typed process language satisfies strong forms of type preservation and global progress, is strongly normalizing, and enjoys a relational parametricity principle.

40|$|National {{as well as}} international, the {{occurrence}} of pressure ulcers {{is regarded as a}} serious problem of the health service of patients and residents in health care facilities. The prevalence of pressure ulcers in European hospitals varies from 23 % to 8. 3 % (Vanderwee et al. 2007); in Germany the prevalence of pressure ulcers in hospitals is about 7. 1 % (Dassen et al. 2009). In German nursing homes the prevalence is about 4. 3 % (Dassen et al. 2009). International projects like the European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (EPUAP) or on German national level the German Network of Quality Development in Nursing (DNQP) stand out due to providing evidence based guidelines or standards. In Germany, the DNQP developed the Expert Standard/specialist guideline „Pressure Ulcer Prevention in Nursing“. Aim of this Expert Standard is to improve the health service in nursing of patients and residents at risk and {{to reduce the amount of}} pressure ulcers long-ranging. Guidelines and Expert Standards serve as basis of evidence for developing <b>internal</b> nursing <b>protocols</b> (Duff et al. 1998, Field, Lohr 1992, DNQP 2007). Hospital patient data from 2001 to 2007 of annually nation wide pressure ulcer prevalence surveys in nursing homes and hospitals were analysed regarding progression of pressure ulcer prevalence. Further, data of facility structures and patient outcomes from 2002 were analysed to show the relation between the use of <b>internal</b> <b>protocols</b> and pressure ulcer prevalence. To examine differences between health care institutions, which used the Expert Standard for developing their <b>internal</b> <b>protocols,</b> data from 2004 and 2005 about pressure ulcer preventing interventions were analysed. Additionally, these data were used to calculate the relation between use of the Expert Standard and pressure ulcer prevalence. The progress of risk adjusted pressure ulcer prevalence without grade-one pressure ulcers in hospitals from 2001 to 2007 showed a prevalence reduction from 14. 8 % to 9. 3 %. By comparing the health care institutions with and without <b>internal</b> <b>protocols</b> of pressure ulcer prevention, there was no difference regarding pressure ulcer prevalence. Analysis of the nursing health service showed a high part of patients and residents at risk for pressure ulcer, who received recommended measures. Not recommended nursing measures were provided more often in hospitals than in nursing homes. Pressure ulcer prevalence was lower in nursing homes than in hospitals, however, regardless of protocols development according to the Expert Standard. Quality improvement of pressure ulcers health service, aimed at the DNQP by implementing the Expert Standard, cannot be confirmed by the present data definitely...|$|R

RESULTS: Baseline analysis focused on 29 drugs over one year. Considering their unit price and waste amount, a major impact on expense was found to be attributable to six drugs: cetuximab, docetaxel, gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, pemetrexed and trastuzumab.

40|$|Measuring the {{infrared}} radiofluorescence (IR-RF) signal of K-feldspars, which {{is thought to}} be not affected by any anomalous fading, potentially provides a promising alternative dating approach to the more studied IR and pIRIR signals.

In comparison with the original protocol from Erfurt and Krbetschek (2003 a), the proposed one relies on IR-RF signal measurements and bleaching experiments conducted at elevated temperatures. Stabilising the temperature at 70 °C during the measurements helps keeping the very shallow traps empty during the process. <b>Internal</b> <b>protocol</b> tests and dating applications are presented using known age samples.
