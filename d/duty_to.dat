5|$|There {{are many}} {{religious}} overtones similar to Swift's sermons, {{such as the}} Drapier's combination of a <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> God with <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> one's king and country.

40|$|Combatants in war inflict untold devastation. They lay {{waste the}} environment, destroy {{cultural}} heritage, wound, maim, and kill. Most importantly, they kill. These deeds would be, {{in any other}} context, paradigmatically unjust. This thesis asks whether they can be justi-fied. There are two possible approaches: first, deny that killing in war is in fact unjust; sec-ond, argue that the injustice is overridden by weightier moral reasons. In Part I, I reject the view that principles of self-defence can render killing in war just. I argue that the most plausible theories of self-defence are hardest to apply in the cha-otic context of war, while the most practicable theories are least philosophically defensible. Moreover, none of them encompasses the inevitable noncombatant deaths that all wars bring. If killing in war is almost always unjust, perhaps we should advocate pacifism. In Part II, I propose an alternative, arguing that these injustices might be all things con-sidered justified. Combatants have morally important relationships: they have deep personal relationships with friends and family, and comrades-in-arms; if they are citizens of just communities, then that relationship is valuable too. I argue that they have associative <b>duties</b> <b>to</b> protect these relationships against {{the threat posed by}} war, and that these duties may override the injustices they must commit to avert that threat. After defending a conception of associative duties, I support this conclusion with the following argument. As well as our general <b>duties</b> not <b>to</b> harm, we have general <b>duties</b> <b>to</b> protect. Our general <b>duties</b> <b>to</b> protect sometimes override our general <b>duties</b> not <b>to</b> harm, in particular, in cases of justified humanitarian intervention. Our associative <b>duties</b> <b>to</b> protect, however, are stronger than our general <b>duties</b> <b>to</b> protect. If our associative <b>duties</b> <b>to</b> protect are stronger than our general <b>duties</b> <b>to</b> protect, and our general <b>duties</b> <b>to</b> protect can override our general <b>duties</b> not <b>to</b> harm, then our associative <b>duties</b> <b>to</b> protect should also be able to override our general <b>duties</b> not <b>to</b> harm.
