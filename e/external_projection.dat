2500|$|Practitioners do {{not believe}} that Satan {{literally}} exists and do not worship him. Instead, Satan is viewed as a positive archetype embracing the Hebrew root of the word [...] "Satan" [...] as [...] "adversary", who represents pride, , and enlightenment, and of a cosmos which Satanists perceive to be motivated by a [...] "dark evolutionary force of entropy that permeates all of nature and provides the drive for survival and propagation inherent in all living things". The Devil is embraced as a symbol of defiance against the Abrahamic faiths which LaVey criticized for what he saw as the suppression of humanity's natural instincts. Moreover, Satan also serves as a metaphorical <b>external</b> <b>projection</b> of the individual's godhood. LaVey espoused the view that [...] "god" [...] is a creation of man, rather than man being a creation of [...] "god". In his book, The Satanic Bible, the Satanist's view of god is described as the Satanist's true [...] "self"—a projection {{of his or her own}} personality—not an external deity. Satan is used as a representation of personal liberty and individualism. LaVey explained that the gods worshiped by other religions are also projections of man's true self. He argues that man's unwillingness to accept his own ego has caused him to externalize these gods so as to avoid the feeling of narcissism that would accompany self-worship. The current High Priest of the Church of Satan, Peter H. Gilmore, further expounds that [...] "...Satan is a symbol of Man living as his prideful, carnal nature dictates [...] Satan is not a conscious entity to be worshiped, rather a reservoir of power inside each human to be tapped at will. The Church of Satan has chosen Satan as its primary symbol because in Hebrew it means adversary, opposer, one to accuse or question. We see ourselves as being these Satans; the adversaries, opposers and accusers of all spiritual belief systems that would try to hamper enjoyment of our life as a human being" [...] The term [...] "Theistic Satanism" [...] has been described as [...] "oxymoronic" [...] by the church and its High Priest. The Church of Satan rejects the legitimacy of any other organizations who claim to be Satanists, dubbing them reverse-Christians, pseudo-Satanists or Devil worshipers, atheistic or otherwise, and maintains a purist approach to Satanism as expounded by LaVey.|$|E

However, these projections are absent from upper case letters, which in some cases are only distinguishable by subtle internal cues.

Nevertheless, these Roman characters are available in the ASCII character set most commonly used in textual communications, which reinforces this system's ubiquity.|$|R

This arms acquisition model includes the initial considerations of having a defense establishment and needs for arms, the military requirement process, and the source selection process, the latter including the arms supplier policies as related to Venezuela during the intervening period. Venezuela, an oil producing nation, increased defense expenditures by 52 % in 1974. New weapon systems were ordered by Venezuela in 1975 reflecting the availability of larger resources.

40|$|This article aims {{to discuss}} the {{formation}} of a motivational landscape by looking at paintings; stencils; and religious and nonreligious graffiti in the city of Rio de Janeiro {{in the context of the}} 2016 Olympics. The process of artification at work in various expressions of so-called street arts is key for understanding the use that different social actors (young evangelicals or not, City Council, NGOs) make of this artistic expression. In this sense, the artistic interventions emerge as mediators of a citizen message, and/or an aesthetic one, and/or a religious one. Therefore, the purpose of the article is to present some advances in the analysis of speeches, images, and legislation regarding art and street interventions, in the city’s specific socio-political context. The empirical data that supports these analyzes are currently being undertaken in the survey “Street Art and Religion: A Study on Citizenship Productions and City Projects Through Graffiti in Rio de Janeiro,” and were structured by conducting interviews with graffiti artists and City Council representatives and drawing a map of artistic interventions, mainly in the South Zone of Rio de Janeiro.
