5|$|William faced several {{challenges}} on becoming duke, including his <b>illegitimate</b> <b>birth</b> and his youth: the {{evidence indicates that}} he was either {{seven or eight years}} old at the time. He enjoyed the support of his great-uncle, Archbishop Robert, as well as the king of France, Henry I, enabling him to succeed to his father's duchy. The support given to the exiled English princes in their attempt to return to England in 1036 shows that the new duke's guardians were attempting to continue his father's policies, but Archbishop Robert's death in March 1037 removed one of William's main supporters, and conditions in Normandy quickly descended into chaos.|$|E
5|$|In 1173, {{more than}} two years after the murder of Becket, King Henry II of England decided to fill the vacant archbishopric of Canterbury; there were two candidates: Richard, and Odo, prior of Canterbury. Previously, Roger, the abbot of Bec Abbey, had been elected, but refused the office. On 3 June 1173, Richard was chosen, {{although}} the monks preferred Odo. Both sides appealed to Rome, and Richard journeyed to Rome with Reginald fitz Jocelin, who had recently been elected Bishop of Bath, to rebut the charges of simony, <b>illegitimate</b> <b>birth,</b> and swearing an oath to the king that had been raised. After hearing the charges, they were dismissed and the election was ratified on 2 April 1174 and on 7 April 1174 the new archbishop was consecrated at Anagni by Pope Alexander III. Richard returned to England {{at the close of the}} year bearing his pallium which he had received directly from the pope. He was also granted legatine powers by Alexander III.|$|E

5|$|While {{the church}} in Norway {{initially}} had refused to recognise Haakon as King of Norway, it had largely turned to support his claim to the throne by the 1223 meeting, although later disagreements occurred. Despite additionally having become the undisputed ruler of Norway after 1240, Haakon had still not been approved as king by the Pope due to his <b>illegitimate</b> <b>birth.</b> He nonetheless had a strong personal desire to be approved fully as a European king. Several papal commissions were appointed to investigate the matter, and Haakon declared his legitimate son Haakon the Young his successor instead of an older living illegitimate son. Although Haakon had children with his mistress Kanga the Young prior to his marriage with Margrete, it was his children with Margrete that was designated as his successors in accordance with a papal recognition. The Catholic principle of legitimacy was thus established in the Norwegian order of succession, although Haakon's new law still maintained that illegitimate children could be designated as successor {{in the absence of}} any legitimate children or grandchildren—contrary to Catholic principles. While his strong position allowed him to set boundaries to the church's political influence, he was on the other hand prepared to give the church much autonomy in internal affairs and relations with the rural society.|$|E

Helmut Köster views the narratives of Jesus' virgin birth as having roots in Hellenistic mythology.|$|E

5000|$|Some island women fraternised {{with the}} occupying forces. This was frowned {{upon by the}} {{majority}} of islanders, who gave them the derogatory nickname Jerry-bags. According to the Ministry of Defence, a very high proportion of women [...] "from all classes and families" [...] had sexual relations with the enemy, and 800-900 children were born to German fathers. The Germans estimated their troops had been responsible for fathering 60 to 80 <b>illegitimate</b> <b>births</b> in the Channel Islands. As far as official figures went, 176 <b>illegitimate</b> <b>births</b> in total had been registered in Jersey between July 1940 and May 1945; and in Guernsey 259 <b>illegitimate</b> <b>births</b> between July 1941 and June 1945 (the disparity in the official figures is explained by differing legal definitions of illegitimacy in the two jurisdictions). The German military authorities tried to prohibit sexual fraternisation in an attempt to reduce incidences of sexually transmitted diseases. They opened brothels for soldiers, staffed with French prostitutes under German medical surveillance.|$|R

The dishonest merchant Dhana from Hastināpura swindles the King of Śrāvastī by offering to weave a supernatural garment that cannot be seen or touched by any person of <b>illegitimate</b> <b>birth.</b> When the king is supposedly wearing the garment, his whole court pretends to admire it.

25|$|The {{unification}} of Norway into one kingdom is traditionally held {{to have been}} achieved by King Harald Fairhair at the Battle of Hafrsfjord in 872, but the process of unification {{took a long time}} to complete and consolidate. By the mid-11th century the process seems to have been completed. However, it was still not uncommon for several rulers to share the kingship. This seems to have been the common way of solving disputes in cases where two or more worthy candidates for the throne existed. The relationship between such co-rulers was often tense, but open conflict was generally averted. Clear succession laws did not exist. The main criterion for being considered a worthy candidate for the throne was to be a descendant of Harald Fairhair through the male line—legitimate or <b>illegitimate</b> <b>birth</b> was not an issue.|$|E
25|$|Elizabeth {{was born}} at Kolomenskoye, near Moscow, on 18 December 1709 (O.S.), the {{daughter}} of Peter the Great, Tsar of Russia, by his second wife, Catherine I. Catherine had been a maid in the household of Peter the Great and, although no documentary record exists, {{they are said to}} have married secretly at the Cathedral of the Holy Trinity in St. Petersburg at some point of time between 23 October and 1 December 1707. Peter valued Catherine and married her again (this time officially) at Saint Isaac's Cathedral in St. Petersburg on 9 February 1712. On this day, the two children previously born to them (Anna and Elizabeth) were legitimized by their father. The circumstances of Elizabeth's birth would later be used by her political opponents to challenge her right to the throne on grounds of <b>illegitimate</b> <b>birth.</b>|$|E

25|$|When Percival {{is a young}} teenager, Captain Delmar reappears {{and offers}} him a {{position}} aboard his new navy ship, the H.M. Calliope. While preparing to enter service, Percival overhears gossip of his <b>illegitimate</b> <b>birth,</b> introducing the idea that Captain Delmar may be his father. He confronts his mother about his parentage, which she at first harshly denies but later tearfully explains the truth of her affair. Early in his service in the navy, Percival is captured during a pirate raid along with others. The pirate crew is entirely black, and the captain explains that they are primarily escaped slaves from the Americas. Percival is taken in as a cabin boy, and later dyes his skin tan in {{the appearance of a}} mulatto to please the captain who doesn't approve of white skin. The pirates often seek to take over slave trading vessels, killing every white person on board. During the taking of one such vessel, Percival is able is convince the captain to spare the lives of a wealthy Dutch merchant and his young daughter, Minnie. Eventually the H.M. Calliope takes the pirate ship, and Percival--unrecognizable with his dyed skin--is taken as a prisoner, later to convince his fellow shipman of his true identity.|$|E
25|$|For generations, Xianghua's {{ancestors}} of the Chai family have groomed men and women into seasoned warriors of China. A woman named Xiangfei {{was sent to the}} prestigious Ling-Sheng Su Temple to learn the swordplay and became supremely skilled with the jian. Following her father's passing, Xiangfei forged a forbidden romance with Kong Xiuqiang, a monk at the temple and the most prominent candidate for inheritor of the holy bo staff, the Kali-Yuga. Not until the <b>illegitimate</b> <b>birth</b> of their first daughter, Xianglian, was their love made known to the other monks who remained very strict regarding the temple's edicts and so Xianglian was taken from her parents on her second birthday. Xiangfei became too wrought with grief to remain at the temple. Han Dongxiu, a sworn brother of Xiuqiang and Xiangfei, helped Xiuqiang sneak the holy Krita-Yuga sword to his lover, to serve as a promise the two would one day meet again. Unknown to Xiuqiang was that when Xiangfei, pregnant with a second child, had left the temple, secretly returned to her homeland, was taken in by the Chai home there, and {{became a member of the}} Ming Dynasty secret Imperial Guard, the Jinyiwei. Months later, she gave birth to her second daughter, Xianghua, but never revealed anything about the girl's father or his lineage to her. By this time, the temple had found that Xiuqiang had stolen the Krita-Yuga and he was exiled from the temple, but Xianglian was to remain there to be trained as an orphan. Xiuqiang eventually discovered Xiangfei's whereabouts, but the Chai family asked him to leave her alone, as she would be happier in her ignorance. When monks from the Temple came to Xiangfei, searching for the missing sword, all they found was young Xianghua playing with a battered jian, and they gave up the search years later. Only Xiuqiang knew that Xianghua's sword was actually the Krita-Yuga in disguise. As time passed, Xianghua had learned to use it just as well as her mother when Xiangfei died after her 11th birthday. Five years afterward, Xianghua became a member of the Imperial Guard.|$|E

However it does seem that Staunton was involved in more than his fair share of chess disputes. H. J. R.

500|$|Catherine {{comes into}} focus {{following}} the accession of Stephen Thomas to the Bosnian throne in 1443.

Peace was to be sealed with the marriage of King Thomas and Catherine, a great honour to her father.

500|$|Nothing {{is known}} of his early life before 1259, when he is {{mentioned}} for his participation in the events {{that led up to}} the Battle of Pelagonia, where he led a contingent of Vlachs. By that time, he was already married to a daughter of the Thessalian Vlach chieftain Taronas. She is only known by the monastic name she assumed after his death, Hypomone ("Patience"). This association with Thessaly has led to suggestions by modern scholars that he ruled Thessaly in his father's name, but there is no concrete evidence to back this up. It is equally unclear whether the Vlach troops he commanded were part of the official Epirote army, or a privately raised force. John {{played a crucial role in}} the Battle of Pelagonia, where his desertion from the coalition composed by his father, Prince William II Villehardouin of Achaea, and King Manfred of Sicily, contributed to the defeat of the allies by the forces of the Nicaean Empire under John Palaiologos, Michael VIII's brother. The reason for the defection is unclear, as the various sources offer conflicting accounts. Both George Pachymeres and Marino Sanudo Torcello however report that during the march, John became incensed at some Achaean knights, who openly coveted his beautiful wife. Matters were made worse when William of Villehardouin not only did not punish his men, but also insulted John Doukas for his <b>illegitimate</b> <b>birth,</b> prompting the latter to defect before the battle, after receiving assurances that he would not have to fight his own father; thereupon the Epirotes too left, and the Latin troops were overwhelmed by the Byzantines.|$|E
