40|$|A <b>future</b> <b>plan</b> {{is key to}} {{directing}} {{and continuing}} supports for {{a person with a}} developmental disability. Despite its importance, many aging parents of an adult with a developmental disability do not have a <b>future</b> <b>plan</b> ready for the time when they will be unable to provide supports. This study explores why some parents in British Columbia do not have a <b>future</b> <b>plan</b> and proposes government actions to encourage <b>future</b> <b>planning.</b> Semi-structured interviews with parents, non-profit and government employees reveal barriers that hinder <b>future</b> <b>planning</b> in the areas of financial, housing, and service processes. Case studies of different jurisdictions examine the current supports for people with disabilities and present possible solutions to facilitate <b>future</b> <b>planning.</b> Four policy options mitigating the barriers are evaluated: an information campaign, increasing housing choices, utilizing a navigator role, and increasing respite. All options are superior to the status quo...|$|R
40|$|There has not {{yet been}} any {{research}} done on <b>future</b> <b>planning</b> in international and intercultural couples. The purpose of this case study is to give a first insight into the process of <b>future</b> <b>planning</b> in intercultural couples. A qualitative case study with two participants, one from New Zealand and one from Belgium who are immigrating to New Zealand. One interview with each participant was held before the couple moved to New Zealand for three months and one more interview with each participant after they returned. Results are plentiful. A clear sign that different cultural backgrounds influence <b>future</b> <b>planning</b> seems to exist. Further the couple reported multiple projects and events in which decision making, goal hierarchy and <b>future</b> <b>planning</b> existed. Not all results have been analysed and are available for further use. This case study offers a first insight into <b>future</b> <b>planning</b> of international and intercultural couples. The next step would be to try to support the findings with quantitative data...|$|R

5|$|By {{the next}} day, the revolt was rapidly growing. The villagers spread the news across the region, and John Geoffrey, a local bailiff, rode between Brentwood and Chelmsford, {{rallying}} support. On 4 June, the rebels gathered at Bocking, where their <b>future</b> <b>plans</b> {{seem to have}} been discussed. The Essex rebels, possibly a few thousand strong, advanced towards London, some probably travelling directly and others via Kent. One group, under the leadership of John Wrawe, a former chaplain, marched north towards the neighbouring county of Suffolk, with the intention of raising a revolt there.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{response}} to Billie was mixed; some critics {{felt that she}} was a strong addition to Charmed while others cited Cuoco's acting and the character's story arc with Christy as signs of the show's declining quality. After speculation about Billie's possible appearance in a spin-off series, it was confirmed all <b>future</b> <b>plans</b> for the show were canceled following The WB's closure to launch The CW. Cuoco later said that she prefer working on sitcoms over dramatic television shows due to demanding shooting schedule that she experienced while working on Charmed.|$|E

40|$|The study {{examined}} the social, personality, and cognitive correlates of self-reported <b>future</b> <b>planning</b> {{and the relationship of}} <b>future</b> <b>planning</b> to perceived control and life satisfaction. Using 2 probability samples of adults ages 25 - 74 (n 1 = 2, 971, n 2 = 300) findings suggest, for Study 1, that education, income, social support, predictability, Conscientiousness, and Openness to Experience were positively related to <b>future</b> <b>planning,</b> whereas Neuroticism and Agreeableness were negatively related. Men were more future oriented; as age increased, <b>future</b> <b>planning</b> decreased. Study 2 replicated the findings with the exception of age, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. For both studies, results supported a model in which the effects of <b>future</b> <b>planning</b> on life satisfaction were mediated by sense of control. A Planning X Age interaction for Study 1 indicated that although self-reported <b>future</b> <b>planning</b> decreased with age, the positive effects of future-oriented planning strategies on life satisfaction were most pronounced for the older adults, and this relationship was also mediated by control beliefs. Psychologists have long been interested in the ways in which people control or structure their lives and how those different strategies influence outcomes. Planning, as a life management strategy, is one way people control and structure their lives. Ofte...|$|R

5|$|Along {{its present}} course, MD32 {{bypassed}} Sykesville and was relocated from Clarksville to Glenelg {{in the early}} 1960s. The state highway was also extended east from Savage to Fort Meade in the late 1960s. A disjoint segment of MD32 was constructed on a new alignment from MD175 in Odenton to MD178 in Crownsville in the early 1970s. The Patuxent Freeway was built from Fort Meade to Columbia in the mid-1980s and from Fort Meade to Millersville in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The freeway was completed from Columbia to Clarksville in the mid-1990s and through Fort George G. Meade in 2005. <b>Future</b> <b>plans</b> call for MD32 to be upgraded to a freeway from Clarksville to West Friendship.|$|E

Doug Orr met Toronto lawyer Alan Eagleson at a juvenile fastball tournament dinner in Parry Sound and asked Eagleson to help out with the situation. Eagleson agreed {{to work with the}} family for free and continued to do so for the next two years. Bobby and Eagleson developed a relationship Orr would later describe as being like brothers.

5|$|On {{return to}} his parent club, Mousinho played a lot more {{frequently}} during the 2006–07 season, a total of 39 times, and was subsequently rewarded with an extended contract which was due to run until June 2009.

However, he only played a total of 24 times in all competitions, 15 times less than during the club's previous campaign.

A study of 467 intermediate risk patients enrolled in A3961 from 1997 to 2005 confirmed the hypothesis that therapy could be successfully reduced for this risk group.

5|$|The first {{highways}} {{along the}} route of the modern US31 corridor were the West Michigan Pike, an auto trail from 1913, and later a pair of state trunklines (the original M-11 and M-58) in 1919. These state highways were redesignated US31 on November 11, 1926, when the US Highway System was approved. Since then, the highway has been realigned in places. The highway crossed the Straits of Mackinac by ferry for about a decade in the 1920s and 1930s before the Mackinac Bridge was built, connecting to US2 north of St. Ignace. Later, sections were converted into freeways starting in the 1950s.
