5|$|Icke visited Shine four times. During {{the third}} meeting, on 29 March 1990, Icke felt {{something}} like a spider's web on his face, and Shine told <b>him</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> a message from Wang Ye Lee of the spirit world. Icke {{had been sent to}} heal the Earth, she said, and would become famous but would face opposition. The spirit world was going to pass ideas to him, which he would speak about to others. He would write five books in three years; in 20 years a new flying machine would allow us to go wherever we wanted and time would have no meaning; and there would be earthquakes in unusual places, because the inner earth was being destabilized by having oil taken from the seabed.|$|E
5|$|Despite Sheila's erratic mental state, her {{psychiatrist}} {{told the}} court {{that the kind of}} violence necessary to commit the murders was not consistent with his view of her. In particular, {{he said he did not}} believe she would have killed her father or children, because her difficult relationship was confined to her mother. Her ex-husband said the same: that, despite her tendency to throw things and sometimes hit <b>him,</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> never harmed the children. June Bamber's sister, Pamela Boutflour, testified that Sheila was not a violent person and that she had never known her to use a gun; June's niece, Ann Eaton, {{told the court}} that Sheila did not know how to use one. Bamber disputed this, telling police on the night of the shooting, as they stood outside the house, that he and Sheila had gone target shooting together. He acknowledged later that he had not seen her fire a gun as an adult.|$|E
5|$|Gardstein's {{body was}} removed {{to a local}} {{mortuary}} where his face was cleaned, his hair brushed, his eyes opened and his photograph taken. The picture, and descriptions {{of those who had}} helped Gardstein escape from Exchange Buildings, were distributed on posters in English and Russian, asking locals for information. About 90 detectives vigorously searched the East End, spreading details of those they were looking for. A local landlord, Isaac Gordon, reported one of his lodgers, Nina Vassilleva, after she had told <b>him</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been one of the people living at Exchange Buildings. Wensley questioned the woman, finding anarchist publications in her rooms, along with a photograph of Gardstein. Information began to come in from the public and the group's associates: on 18 December Federoff was arrested at home, and on 22 December Dubof and Peters were both captured.|$|E

25|$|Atia's {{first husband}} was Gaius Octavius, a Senator of obscure provincial origins. By <b>him</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> a daughter, Octavia the Younger (Octavius {{already had a}} daughter, Octavia the Elder, from a {{previous}} marriage), and a son, Gaius Octavius (Octavian). After Octavius died in 59 BC, Atia married another Senator, Lucius Marcius Philippus, who was a devoted stepfather to her children.

25|$|In {{a signed}} affidavit, Siddiqui's {{maternal}} uncle, Shams ul-Hassan Faruqi, stated that on 22 January 2008 she {{visited him in}} Islamabad and told <b>him</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been held by Pakistani agencies. Knowing he had worked in Afghanistan and made contact with the Taliban in 1999, she asked for his help to cross into Taliban-controlled Afghanistan where {{she thought she would}} be safe. He told her he was no longer in touch with them. He notified his sister, Siddiqui's mother, who came the next day to see her daughter. He said that Siddiqui stayed with them for two days. Investigating the disappearance, a US journalist (Deborah Scroggins) reported that Geo TV presenter Hamid Mir informed her that friends of Siddiqui believed she had gone underground avoiding the FBI. Scroggins was also warned by Pakistanis with jihadist connections (including Khalid Khawaja) that she (Scroggins) might end up like Daniel Pearl (beheaded) if she attempted to pursue finding Siddiqui.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the French crown, the Spanish crowns {{could all}} be {{inherited}} by, or through, a female in default of a male line. The next in line after Charles II, therefore, were his two sisters: Maria Theresa, the elder, and Margaret Theresa, the younger. Maria Theresa had married Louis XIV in 1660 and by <b>him</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> a son, Louis, Dauphin of France. If {{it had been a}} matter of hereditary rights the Dauphin would have been heir presumptive to the Spanish Monarchy, but Maria Theresa had renounced her claim of succession in return for the payment of a dowry of half a million gold crowns. The testament of her father, Philip IV, reiterated this waiver and bequeathed the reversion of the whole of the Spanish dominions to his younger daughter, Margaret Theresa. However the French, using in part the excuse that the dowry promised Maria Theresa was never paid, insisted that her renunciation was invalid. Nor was it clear whether a princess could waive the rights of her unborn children.|$|E
25|$|Mary and Cathleen {{return home}} from their {{drive to the}} drugstore, where Mary has sent Cathleen in to {{purchase}} her morphine prescription. Not wanting to be alone, Mary does not allow Cathleen {{to go to the}} kitchen to finish dinner and offers her a drink instead. Mary does most of the talking and discusses her love for fog but her hatred of the foghorn and her husband’s obvious obsession with money. It is obvious that Mary has already taken some of her “prescription.” She talks about her past in a Catholic convent and the promise she once had as a pianist {{and the fact that it}} was once thought that she might become a nun. She also makes it clear that while she fell in love with her husband from the time she met <b>him,</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> never taken to the theatre crowd. She shows her arthritic hands to Cathleen and explains that the pain in her hands is why she needs her prescription – an explanation which is untrue and transparent to Cathleen.|$|E

25|$|Having {{started a}} proper {{relationship}} with Zsa Zsa, Leon returns to Walford {{looking for her}} after she runs away. He performs as a stripper at Bianca Jackson's (Patsy Palmer) hen party. After the party, Zainab Masood (Nina Wadia) catches him in bed with Lucy. Lucy tries to break Leon and Zsa Zsa up when they are kissing in The Queen Victoria public house, managing to drag Leon back to her house until her father Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) interrupts them and asks Leon to leave. Lucy watches Leon and Zsa Zsa around the Square and reveals to her stepmother Jane (Laurie Brett) that she is pregnant. Leon humiliates Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty) by filming her cleaning {{a bench in the}} Square and sending it to people, so when she hears Ian talking about the pregnancy, she decides to tell Leon. He confronts Lucy in The Queen Victoria and asks if the baby is his. They meet the next day and he says he is willing to go with her to get an abortion, but she lies that the baby is not his. When Leon demands the truth, Lucy tells <b>him</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> an abortion.|$|E
25|$|An {{incident}} {{regarding the}} character of Sidney Dillon (or William S. Paley) is then discussed between Jonesy and Mrs. Coolbirth. Sidney Dillon {{is said to have}} told Ina Coolbirth this story because they have a history as former lovers. One evening while Cleo Dillon (Babe Paley) was out of the city, in Boston, Sidney Dillon attended an event by himself at which he was seated next to the wife of a prominent New York Governor. The two began to flirt and eventually went home together. While Ina suggests that Sidney Dillon loves his wife, it is his inexhaustible need for acceptance by haute New York society that motivates him to be unfaithful. Sidney Dillon and the woman sleep together, and afterwards Mr. Dillon discovers a very large blood stain on the sheets, which represents her mockery of him. Mr. Dillon then spends {{the rest of the night}} and early morning manually washing the sheet with scalding water in an attempt to conceal his unfaithfulness from his wife who is due to arrive home the same morning. In the end, Dillon falls asleep on a damp sheet and wakes up to a note from his wife telling <b>him</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> arrived while he was sleeping, did not want to wake him, and that she would see him at home.|$|E
25|$|In October 1321 King Edward and {{his troops}} besieged Leeds Castle, after the governor's wife, Margaret de Clare, Baroness Badlesmere, refused Queen Isabella {{admittance}} and subsequently ordered her archers to fire upon Isabella and her escort after the latter attempted to gain {{entry to the}} castle. Elizabeth, the third Badlesmere daughter, was married to Joan and Mortimer's eldest son, Edmund. King Edward exploited his new popularity {{in the wake of}} his military victory at Leeds to recall to England the Despensers, whom the Lords Ordainers, led by Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster, had forced him to banish in August 1321. The Marcher lords, already in a state of insurrection for some time prior to the Despensers' banishment, immediately rose up against the King in full force, with Mortimer leading the confederation alongside Ordainer Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford. The King quelled the rebellion, which is also known as the Despenser War; Mortimer and his uncle Roger Mortimer de Chirk both surrendered to him at Shrewsbury on 22 January 1322. Mortimer and his uncle were dispatched as prisoners to the Tower of London, where they were kept in damp, unhealthy quarters. This was likely a factor in Roger Mortimer de Chirk's death in 1326. Joan's husband had fared better; by drugging the constable and the Tower guards, he managed to escape to France on 1 August 1323. It was there that he later became the lover of Queen Isabella, who was estranged from the King as a result of the Despensers' absolute control over <b>him.</b> <b>She</b> <b>had</b> been sent to France on a peace mission by Edward but used the occasion to seek help from her brother, Charles IV to oust the Despensers. The scandal of their love affair forced them to leave the French court for Flanders, where they obtained help for an invasion of England.|$|E

500|$|The {{year after}} their marriage, the couple began {{campaign}}ing for George W. Bush's 1978 Congressional candidacy. According to George Bush, {{when he asked}} her to marry <b>him,</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> said, [...] "Yes. But only if you promise me that I'll never have to make a campaign speech." [...] She soon relented, and gave her first stump speech for him in 1978 on the courthouse steps in Muleshoe, Texas. After narrowly winning the primary, he lost the general election.|$|E
500|$|Ellen Nakashima writes that, on May 9, Manning {{contacted}} Jonathan Odell, a gay American novelist in Minneapolis, via Facebook, {{leaving a}} message {{that she wanted to}} speak to him in confidence; she said she had been involved in some [...] "very high-profile events, albeit as a nameless individual thus far". On May 19, according to Army investigators, she emailed Eric Schmiedl, a mathematician she had met in Boston, and told <b>him</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been the source of the Baghdad airstrike video. Two days later, she began the series of chats with Adrian Lamo that led to her arrest.|$|E
500|$|Also {{contemporary}} is Gregory of Tours' account {{presented in}} the Historia Francorum, and echoed by the later Fredegar. Gregory's account diverges in several respects from most other sources. In his tale it is told how Alboin married {{the daughter of a}} man he had slain, and how she waited for a suitable occasion for revenge, eventually poisoning <b>him.</b> <b>She</b> <b>had</b> previously fallen in love with one of her husband's servants, and after the assassination tried to escape with him, but they were captured and killed. However, historians including Walter Goffart place little trust in this narrative. Goffart notes other similar doubtful stories in the Historia and calls its account of Alboin's demise [...] "a suitably ironic tale of the doings of depraved humanity".|$|E

500|$|Gasper later lambasted UKIP {{as being}} [...] "plagued with transsexuals", a {{reference}} to the transwomen Nikki Sinclaire and Kellie Maloney, both of whom have served as candidates for the party. Asserting that she refused to recognise transwomen as women, she declared Maloney to be [...] "absolutely grotesque" [...] and added that her transition was [...] "totally barmy – and how pathetic that he [...] can do nothing better with his life." [...] In May, a former UKIP activist, Colin Cortbus, also publicly revealed to Cherwell that in emails Gasper had sent to <b>him</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> again emphasised a connection between homosexuality and paedophilia, and had described the Quran as a [...] "fascist" [...] book, comparing it to Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf and describing Islam as [...] "a severely oppressive ideology".|$|E
500|$|Bayliss (Kyle Secor) and Pembleton (Andre Braugher) {{prepare to}} {{interview}} Risley Tucker (Moses Gunn), an elderly arabber. Bayliss is convinced Tucker murdered [...] 11-year-old Adena Watson, but Pembleton is less confident. Since {{they have already}} interviewed Tucker multiple times, the court will not allow him to be bothered anymore {{if he does not}} confess after this interview, and the detectives have only 12 hours to elicit a confession before Tucker walks free. Pembleton starts off acting friendly while Bayliss, who has taken the Watson case very personally, is more aggressive. Adena used to work for Tucker, taking care of his horse. Pembleton brings up Tucker's alcoholism, but Tucker said he gave up drinking because he used to black out, insisting he hasn't had a drink in 16 months. Tucker also insists he hadn't seen Adena for three days before she died, but Bayliss shows <b>him</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> soot on her skirt that matched soot from Tucker's barn, indicating she was there the day she was killed.|$|E
500|$|When Powell was 17, {{her father}} died after a long battle with lung cancer. Before he died, he told her {{she would have to}} get a job to support her mother, and {{would not be able to}} go to art school. As her mother wanted her to receive an education, she rented out a room to four {{apprentice}} electricians. In September 1957, Powell gained a place at the Liverpool College of Art. Although studying graphics, she also took lettering classes, as did Lennon. He never had any drawing tools with him, so he constantly borrowed pens and pencils from Powell, who discovered he was only there because other teachers had refused to instruct <b>him.</b> <b>She</b> <b>had</b> an air of respectability and moved in different social circles than her future husband. Lennon and an art school friend, Geoff Mohammed, used to make fun of her by stopping the conversation when she walked in the room, saying: [...] "Quiet please! No dirty jokes; it's Cynthia." ...|$|E
