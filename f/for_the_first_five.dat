5|$|During 1939 and 1940, {{a fourth}} batch of ten {{locomotives}} (Nos. 6235–6244) {{was built in}} streamlined form commencing with No. 6235 City of Birmingham.

These locomotives cost an average of £10,659 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>five</b> and £10,838 each for the second five. The names of the cities in this batch were in strict alphabetical order. This came to an end when No. 6244 City of Leeds was patriotically renamed King George VI in 1941.|$|E

5|$|As a youth, Bell played amateur {{football}} with Burnley Belvedere {{before joining}} Football League Second Division side Burnley in February 1902. He made his debut {{for the club}} on 10 January 1903 in the 1–0 win against Lincoln City at Turf Moor; the winning goal was scored by Cuthbert Storey, who was also playing in his first senior match after transferring from Burnley Belvedere. Bell was selected once more in the 1902–03 campaign, playing at left inside forward in the 1–3 defeat to Leicester Fosse on 24 January 1903. He was unable {{to break into the}} team <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>five</b> months of the following season due to the form of fellow inside forward William Jackson, a new signing from Barrow. He made his first appearance of the campaign in the goalless draw away at Grimsby Town on 30 January 1904. Bell scored his first competitive goal for Burnley in the 2–0 win over Gainsborough Trinity three weeks later, and on 12 March he scored a late goal in the 1–3 loss away to Manchester United. In total, Bell played eleven league matches during the 1903–04 season and scored four goals.|$|E
5|$|English local {{authorities}} {{are required to}} produce Local Transport Plans (LTPs), strategies for developing local integrated transport {{as part of a}} longer-term vision. LTPs are used by central government to allocate funding for transport schemes. The final Local Transport Plan 2006–2011 for York was submitted to central government in March 2006. The plan addresses the fact that traffic in York is predicted to grow considerably over the coming years. The key aims of the plan are to ease congestion and improve accessibility, air quality and safety. Major funding allocations earmarked <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>five</b> years of the plan's life span include outer ring road improvements, improved management of the highway network, improvements to the bus network including park and ride services, provision of off-road walking and cycling routes, air quality improvements and safety measures.|$|E
5|$|Harley's {{leadership}} {{qualities and}} {{influence on the}} club as captain was commended {{early on in the}} season after his handling of teammate Steve Johnson's off-field discretions.

However, he successfully returned to the team and finished the season as a Norm Smith Medallist and All-Australian. Harley's leadership influence on the team was reflected in his finishing fourth in the AFLPA Best Captain award during his first year at the helm. He was also awarded life membership of the Geelong Football Club following his 150th team appearance in the round sixteen win against the Western Bulldogs, and named in the end-of-season South Australian State of Origin team.|$|E

5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1970, partly as a {{response}} to criticism that they were not reaching their intended audience, the CTW conducted a poll of four urban neighborhoods in New York, Chicago, and Washington, D.C. The results of the poll were positive in three out of the four neighborhoods and confirmed the show's high viewership. Sesame Street's high ratings increased during its second season, and Nielsen reported high audience loyalty. Gerald S. Lesser, CTW's first advisory board chair, reported rumors about the show becoming a fad among college students. Its ratings steadily increased <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>five</b> seasons, and Nielsen reported that Sesame Street had the highest ratings of any PBS program.

5|$|TSR {{decided to}} create a franchise, {{including}} modules, board games, lead figures, andfor the first timenovels. Weis had been hired as an editor; with Hickman, she began working with the author hired to write the novels. They weren't satisfied with the author, and decided they should {{be the ones to}} write the books. They collaborated over a weekend, writing the prologue <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>five</b> chapters of the first novel, Dragons of Autumn Twilight, based on the module Dragons of Despair. TSR liked their treatment and gave them the assignment, firing the author. After two years of development, TSR released Dragons of Autumn Twilight as a supplement to the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons game. TSR had doubts about the finished novel's sales potential, and attempted to order thirty thousand copies, ultimately ordering the minimum print run of fifty thousand. The success of the novel prompted TSR to publish more copies to meet demand. Dragonlance eventually received ancillary products such as novels, calendars, computer games, and books of artwork.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 French Open Men's singles {{semifinal}} between world No. 2 Novak Djokovic {{and world}} No. 3 Roger Federer was a historic encounter that {{brought about the}} end of the longest winning streak in almost 30 years. Djokovic entered the match undefeated <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>five</b> months of the year having gone 41–0 with a total winning streak of 43 matches (his last loss had come against Federer at the World Tour Finals). It was the first Grand Slam tournament in which Djokovic had ever been seeded higher than Federer. Djokovic had defeated Federer in their three previous meetings in 2011, however, Federer shocked many by taking the first two sets. Djokovic won the third set and as the fourth set went on the light began to fade and it was clear that if the match went to a fifth set it would have to be continued the next day. Djokovic served for the fourth set at 5–4 but was broken and Federer closed out the match in a tiebreaker.|$|E

5|$|The MS {{changed its}} name to the Great Central Railway (GCR) in 1897 and the Great Central Main Line from London Marylebone to Manchester Central opened for {{passenger}} traffic on 15 March 1899. Negotiations about the line between the GCR and the Met took several years and in 1906 it was agreed that two tracks from Canfield Place to Harrow would be leased to the GCR for £20,000 a year and the Metropolitan and Great Central Joint Railway was created, leasing the line from Harrow to Verney Junction and the Brill branch for £44,000 a year, the GCR guaranteeing to place at least £45,000 of traffic on the line. Aylesbury station, which had been jointly run by the GWR and the Met, was placed with a joint committee of the Great Western & Great Central and Metropolitan & Great Central Joint Committees, and generally known as Aylesbury Joint Station. The Met & GC Joint Committee took over the operation of the stations and line, but had no rolling stock. The Met provided the management and the GCR the accounts <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>five</b> years before the companies switched functions, then alternating every five years until 1926. The Met maintained the line south of milepost 28.5 (south of Great Missenden), the GCR to the north.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the Megami Tensei series is developed by Atlus' R Department 1. Other developers {{have been involved with}} the series: these include Multimedia Intelligence Transfer (Last Bible series), Lancarse (Strange Journey), CAVE (Imagine) and Nex Entertainment (Nine), and Arc System Works (Persona 4 Arena). Most of the games up to 2003 were handled by Okada, but when he departed to form his own company Gaia, Kazuma Kaneko became the series' creative director. There are two main writers in the franchise: Shogo Isogai and Ryutaro Ito. Ito first worked on Megami Tensei II, joining the team after development to write the script, along with working with the script and being part of the debug team. Isogai's first work for the series was the script for Shin Megami Tensei II. The next entry If... was also written by Ito, and designed as a departure from the grand scale of previous games, instead being set within a cloistered school environment. His final work for the series was the first Devil Summoner. Isogai also worked on Shin Megami Tensei II and If..., and later worked on multiple Devil Summoner games, Nocturne and Strange Journey. The music <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>five</b> main Megami Tensei titles was composed by Tsukasa Masuko. For Nocturne, Shoji Meguro, who had done work on earlier spin-off titles, was brought in. He later became well known for his work on the Persona titles.|$|E
5|$|The {{physical}} and chemical properties of the alkali metals can be readily explained by their having an ns1 valence electron configuration, which results in weak metallic bonding. Hence, all the alkali metals are soft and have low densities, melting and boiling points, as well as heats of sublimation, vaporisation, and dissociation. They all crystallise in the body-centered cubic crystal structure, and have distinctive flame colours because their outer s electron is very easily excited. The ns1 configuration also results in the alkali metals having very large atomic and ionic radii, as well as very high thermal and electrical conductivity. Their chemistry is dominated by the loss of their lone valence electron in the outermost s-orbital to form the +1 oxidation state, due to the ease of ionising this electron and the very high second ionisation energy. Most of the chemistry has been observed only <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>five</b> members of the group. The chemistry of francium is not well established due to its extreme radioactivity; thus, the presentation of its properties here is limited. What little is known about francium shows that it is very close in behaviour to caesium, as expected. The physical properties of francium are even sketchier because the bulk element has never been observed; hence any data that may be found in the literature are certainly speculative extrapolations.|$|E

5|$|The tornado {{touched down}} at 6:18p.m. CST (00:18UTC) near Castleberry High School {{northwest}} of downtown Fort Worth. Initially, the tornado lacked a condensation funnel, and {{could only be}} visually identified as dust swirls near the ground beneath the rotating wall cloud aloft; the tornado maintained this appearance <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>five</b> minutes of its lifespan, after which a condensation funnel eventually developed. The first signs of damage occurred in the River Oaks area along Texas State Highway 183 where metal roof panels were stripped off of a vacant fast food restaurant. After crossing the highway, the tornado inflicted sporadic F0damage to an older residential area, breaking tree branches and causing some damage to outbuildings; a few chimneys were toppled off of homes. At the time, the tornado's damage path {{was only a few}} hundred feet wide. A roof of a home near Roberts Cut Off Road was partially removed, signifying the first instance of F1damage. Several large and rotted trees were uprooted by the tornado's strong winds as it moved through the area. The tornado then passed directly over Castleberry High School, causing significant damage to the school's field house. Tornadic debris—including rooftop air conditioning units, gravel, and other detached construction—was thrown by the tornado at the school's western façade, causing minor damage. Throughout River Oak, three homes sustained major damage while 51others experienced minor damage.|$|E
