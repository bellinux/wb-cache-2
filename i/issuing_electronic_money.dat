40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the different}} approaches adopted for the regulation of payment systems {{in a variety of}} legislative instruments by the European Union (EU). It looks in particular at how the institutions that <b>issue</b> new <b>electronic</b> <b>money</b> products are regulated and supervised by the relevant authorities in the EU, in comparison with existing institutions such as banks. It analyses some of the lessons that may be learned by the South African Development Corporation (SADC) from the regulatory approaches for <b>electronic</b> <b>money</b> institutions adopted by the EU. The article asks if the approach adopted by the EU may be useful for the future regulation of <b>electronic</b> <b>money</b> institutions in the SADC. The proliferation of electronic devices that arrived with the invention of the Internet has sparked some regulatory challenges. This development has become global and involves both developed and developing countries, including regions such as the SADC. It is asked if these technological developments should be addressed by means of a concrete regulatory framework while they continue to develop, instead of the regulators waiting to observe and acquaint themselves with the relevant regulatory challenges that underpin the innovations. The EU has attempted to address the anticipated regulatory challenges that came about with the development of <b>electronic</b> <b>money</b> and to align its regulatory approach with other payment systems. This article discusses the regulatory approaches adopted in the EU and provides an overview that the SADC may use in order to adopt an effective regulatory framework for <b>electronic</b> <b>money</b> and the institutions that issue these methods of payment. It analyses both the achievements and the challenges that the EU faced (and continues to face) in developing the regulation of e-money, and recommends some possible approaches derived from the lessons learned. ...|$|R

It begins by introducing its conceptual framework for modern central banking, in terms of which it then rehearses the free banking argument. It then reviews the development of e-money {{in terms of both}} electronic payment methods and <b>electronic</b> <b>issue,</b> with special attention paid to the latter. The discussion includes both mainstream developments, such as Mondex, and 'alternative' schemes such as LETS. From here the paper proceeds by way of a consideration of the synergy between <b>electronic</b> <b>issue</b> of <b>money</b> and free banking precepts, to a consideration of some implications for the future of central banking generally. It offers an 'contestable' model of central banking, which endeavours to show the effects that e-money may be expected to have (and, indeed, may already be having) as regards monetary policy, financial supervision and seignorage. It concludes that even in its current stage of development, the emergence of e-money not only reflects and supports key free banking concepts, but may be nudging modern central banking towards free banking practice. <b>Electronic</b> <b>Money,</b> Free Banking, Central Banking...|$|R

This means that there is not necessarily a “correct” answer to the desirability of regulation. Third, technological advances and financial innovations have made it easier for firms to engage in regulatory arbitrage. Competitive pressures may have encouraged financial centres to engage in competitive deregulation, resulting in a less than socially optimal level of regulation overall. It is therefore important that national authorities coordinate and harmonise their regulatory policies. Copyright Kluwer Academic Publishers 1999...|$|R
