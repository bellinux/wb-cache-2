25|$|By {{the turn}} of the century, Morgan had become one of America's most {{important}} collectors of gems and had assembled the most important gem collection in the U.S. as well as of American gemstones (over 1,000 pieces). Tiffany & Co. assembled his first collection under their Chief <b>Gemologist,</b> George Frederick Kunz. The collection was exhibited at the World's Fair in Paris in 1889. The exhibit won two golden awards and drew the attention of important scholars, lapidaries, and the general public.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of sapphires in Anosy was first written about by Étienne de Flacourt in 1658, {{they were most}} likely also seen by Barthelemy Hugon in 1808; and sapphire crystals were described by a French geologist working in the mica mines near Tranomaro in the 1950s. However, it wasn't until 1991 that very high quality blue sapphires of up to 35 carats (similar in quality to those from Kashmir) were purchased by <b>gemologist</b> John Darbellay near the Antandroy villages of Andranondambo and Marohoto (20km from Tranomaro) in the Manambolo valley, just 80km northwest of Tolagnaro (though it takes a 6-hour drive of almost 210km to get there).|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} be {{considered}} for use as a diamond simulant, a material must possess certain diamond-like properties. The most advanced artificial simulants have properties which closely approach diamond, but all simulants have one or more features that clearly and (for those familiar with diamond) easily differentiate them from diamond. To a <b>gemologist,</b> the most important of differential properties are those that foster non-destructive testing; most of these are visual in nature. Non-destructive testing is preferred because most suspected diamonds are already cut into gemstones and set in jewelry, and if a destructive test (which mostly relies on the relative fragility and softness of non-diamonds) fails, it may damage the simulant—an unacceptable outcome for most jewelry owners, as even if a stone is not a diamond, it may still be of value.|$|E

50|$|Rudimentary {{education}} in gemology for jewelers and <b>gemologists</b> {{began in the}} nineteenth century, but the first qualifications were instigated after the National Association of Goldsmiths of Great Britain (NAG) set up a Gemmological Committee for this purpose in 1908. This committee matured into the Gemmological Association of Great Britain (also known as Gem-A), now an educational charity and accredited awarding body with its courses taught worldwide. The first US graduate of Gem-A's Diploma Course, in 1929, was Robert Shipley, who later established both the Gemological Institute of America and the American Gem Society. There are now several professional schools and associations of <b>gemologists</b> and certification programs around the world.|$|R

500|$|Synthetic {{diamonds}} are diamonds {{manufactured in}} a laboratory, {{as opposed to}} diamonds mined from the Earth. The gemological and industrial uses of diamond have created a large demand for rough stones. This demand has been satisfied {{in large part by}} synthetic diamonds, which have been manufactured by various processes {{for more than half a}} century. However, in recent years it has become possible to produce gem-quality synthetic diamonds of significant size. [...] It is possible to make colorless synthetic gemstones that, on a molecular level, are identical to natural stones and so visually similar that only a <b>gemologist</b> with special equipment can tell the difference.|$|E
500|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} {{debate over the}} years as to the depth of the Yogo dike and how many ounces of rough sapphires per ton it contains. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Delmer L. Brown, a geological engineer and <b>gemologist,</b> conducted the most thorough scientific exploration up to that time, concluding that the dike was at least [...] deep and that the concentration of rough sapphires was not constant throughout the deposit. Brown found that the dike had intruded into a pre-existing fault that had been a conduit for groundwater circulation. The overlying shale, the Kibbey Formation, was deposited on an unconformity, an ancient Mississippian-age karst erosion surface, and was not intruded by the dike. This groundwater action produced collapsed zones which were intruded by the dike to form breccia zones. Recent erosion in the area removed the overlying shales and again exposed the limestone to groundwater action which produced collapse breccias which include fragments of the dike rock. He determined that the erosion of the dike in the current erosion cycle was minimal.|$|E

500|$|In 1894, the [...] "blue pebbles" [...] were {{recognized}} as sapphires. [...] One story credits {{a local school}} teacher for recognizing the blue pebbles as sapphires. A variation is that the teacher lived in Maine, but {{was a friend of}} a local miner, who had mailed her a small box with some gold and a few [...] "blue pebbles" [...] in it. Another story credits a miner named S.S. Hobson for surmising that the blue stones might be sapphires, and his guess was confirmed by a jeweler in Helena. [...] Ultimately, in 1895, Jake Hoover sent a cigar box containing those he had collected while mining gold to an assay office, which in turn sent them via regular, uninsured mail to Tiffany's in New York City for appraisal by Dr. George Frederick Kunz, the leading American <b>gemologist</b> of the time. Impressed by their quality and color, Kunz pronounced them [...] "the finest precious gemstones ever found in the United States". Tiffany's sent Hoover a check for $3,750 (approximately $ as of [...] ), along with a letter that described the blue pebbles as [...] "sapphires of unusual quality".|$|E
500|$|Several Yogo sapphires {{are kept}} at the Smithsonian Institution. The {{earliest}} donations were {{noted in the}} museum's annual report on June 30, 1899, when the institution reported that Dr. L. T. Chamberlain gave them two cut Yogos and 21 other sapphires for their Dr. Isaac Lea gem and mineral collection. The record-setting [...] cut Yogo is also held by the Smithsonian. In 2006, <b>gemologist</b> Robert Kane of Fine Gems International in Helena, which has the world's largest selection of Montana sapphires, donated 333 Montana sapphires, weighing a total of , to the Smithsonian's Gem and Mineral Collection, along with 98.48grams of 18K yellow gold {{for the creation of}} a piece of jewelry. A representative of the Smithsonian asked Paula Crevoshay, a jewelry designer from Albuquerque, New Mexico, to create a piece of finished jewelry from these gems. Crevoshay felt that a butterfly motif would best represent America's natural beauty, honor her mother's love of butterflies, and display the wide range of colors found in Montana sapphires. Crevoshay named the brooch [...] "Conchita" [...] in honor of her mother; it is also referred to as the [...] "Sapphire Butterfly Brooch", [...] "Conchita Sapphire Butterfly", and the [...] "Montana Butterfly Brooch". Two of the sapphires used are cabochon cut and the rest are brilliant cut. The majority are from the Rock Creek deposit. The largest one, however, is a blue Yogo used for the butterfly's head. Other sapphires used included yellow, purple, pink, and orange gems. Crevoshay completed the brooch in 2007; she and Kane presented the finished brooch to Smithsonian curator Jeffrey Post on May 7, 2007, in Washington, DC.|$|E

2500|$|The {{solution}} {{present in}} fracture-filled diamonds {{can usually be}} detected by a trained <b>gemologist</b> under the microscope: while each diamond gets a treatment that fits its unique shape, state and fracture status, there may be traces of surface-reaching bore holes and fractures associated with drilled diamonds, air bubbles and flow lines within the glass, which are features never seen in untreated diamond. More dramatic is the so-called [...] "flash effect", which refers to the bright flashes of color seen when a fracture-filled diamond is rotated; the color of these flashes ranges from an electric blue or purple to an orange or yellow, depending on lighting conditions (light field and dark field, respectively). The flashes are best seen with {{the field of view}} nearly parallel to the filled fracture's plane (although specific fractures in untreated diamonds may cause similar [...] "flash effect"). In strongly colored diamonds the flash effect may be missed if examination is less than thorough, as the stone's body color will conceal {{one or more of the}} flash colors. For example, in brown-tinted [...] "champagne" [...] diamonds, the orange-yellow flashes are concealed, leaving only the blue-purple flashes to be seen. One last but important feature of fracture-filled diamonds is the color of the solution itself: it is sometimes a yellowish to brownish, and along with being visible in transmitted light, it can affect the overall color of the diamond, making the diamond fall an entire color grade after fracture-filling. For this reason fracture-filling is normally only applied to stones whose size is large enough to justify the treatment: however, stones as small as 0.02 carats (4mg) have been fracture-filled.|$|E
