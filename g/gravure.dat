5|$|Kurosaki {{began her}} singing career in Akihabara at the {{performance}} venue and bar Dear Stage, {{where she had}} been singing since at least January 2008. Music producer Akihiro Tomita noticed her singing talent, and he subsequently became her producer when she made her major debut signed to Geneon Universal Entertainment (now NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan). Kurosaki first announced her major debut to her fans in January 2010. Before she had her major debut, Kurosaki posed as a <b>gravure</b> model for the cover of Yūsaku Kitano's novel Maid Road Reload sold on April 26, 2010 by ASCII Media Works under their Media Works Bunko imprint.|$|E
5|$|Some {{aspects of}} the game were changed for its Western release: these changes {{included}} the removal or alteration of several revealing costumes, the removal of visual and dialogue references to <b>Gravure</b> modelling, and changes to the ages of certain characters. Multiple sections of dialogue were re-recorded to match these changes. The game's Hot Springs scenario and associated costumes also went unreleased. The removed outfits were replaced with Western-exclusive outfits. Changes to content were attributed to Nintendo's varying content requirements and regulations for the regions the game was released in. Staff later defended these changes as necessary adjustments based on the regions they would be releasing the game in, while working on keeping the core identity intact. After the game's Western release, staff were divided on the issue: Yamagami was positive about the game's adaption for a Western audience, while Hirata was initially disappointed with the alterations prior to seeing positive responses to the game from Western fans. Following the game's Western release, a fan-developed patch was released that reverted all the localization changes, ranging from cosmetic alteration to script changes.|$|E
