40|$|The 1980 s {{mark the}} {{beginning}} of a new trend in the farmers’ movements in India. A spate of new movements, from Shetkari Sangathana (SS) in Maharashtra to Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha (KRRS) in Karnataka and Bharatiya Kisan Union in Uttar Pradesh, began challenging the wider exploitative relations between the agrarian society/system, on the one hand, and industrial/international/western capital on the other. Over the past decade two issues have been in focus in the discourse of the farmers’ movement in India: globalisation and the Indian state. This paper traces the reasons for the farmers’ movement’s formulation of its own perspectives on globalisation and the state.

60|$|Edmund, forty-seventh Baron Badgery, was a lineal {{descendant}} of that Edmund, surnamed Le Blayreau, who landed on English {{soil in the}} train of William the Conqueror. Ennobled by William Rufus, the Badgerys {{had been one of}} the very few baronial families to survive the Wars of the Roses and all the other changes and chances of English history. They were a sensible and philoprogenitive race. No Badgery had ever fought in any war, no Badgery had ever engaged in any <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>politics.</b> They had been content to live and quietly to propagate their species in a huge machicolated Norman castle, surrounded by a triple moat, only sallying forth to cultivate their property and to collect their rents. In the eighteenth century, when life had become relatively secure, the Badgerys began to venture forth into civilised society. From boorish squires they blossomed into grands seigneurs, patrons of the arts, virtuosi. Their property was large, they were rich; and with the growth of industrialism their riches also grew. Villages on their estate turned into manufacturing towns, unsuspected coal was discovered beneath the surface of their barren moorlands. By the middle of the nineteenth century the Badgerys were among the richest of English noble families. The forty-seventh baron disposed of an income of at least two hundred thousand pounds a year. Following the great Badgery tradition, he had refused to have anything to do with politics or war. He occupied himself by collecting pictures; he took an interest in theatrical productions; he was the friend and patron of men of letters, of painters, and musician. A personage, in a word, of considerable consequence in that particular world in which young Spode had elected to make his success.|$|E
60|$|In {{this play}} {{and in this}} scene of it are also shown the springs of the vulgar in politics,--of that <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>politics</b> which is inwoven with human nature. In his {{treatment}} of this subject, wherever it occurs, Shakspeare is quite peculiar. In other writers we find the particular opinions of the individual; in Massinger it is rank republicanism; in Beaumont and Fletcher even 'jure divino' principles are carried to excess;--but Shakspeare never promulgates any party tenets. He is always the philosopher and the moralist, {{but at the same}} time with a profound veneration for all the established institutions of society, and for those classes which form the permanent elements of the state--especially never introducing a professional character, as such, otherwise than as respectable. If he must have any name, he should be styled a philosophical aristocrat, delighting in those hereditary institutions which have a tendency to bind one age to another, and in that distinction of ranks, of which, although few may be in possession, all enjoy the advantages. Hence, again, you will observe the good nature with which he seems always to make sport with the passions and follies of a mob, as with an irrational animal. He is never angry with it, but hugely content with holding up its absurdities to its face; and sometimes you may trace a tone of almost affectionate superiority, something like that in which a father speaks of the rogueries of a child. See the good-humoured way in which he describes Stephano passing from the most licentious freedom to absolute despotism over Trinculo and Caliban. The truth is, Shakspeare's characters are all 'genera' intensely individualized; the results of meditation, of which observation supplied the drapery and the colors necessary to combine them with each other. He had virtually surveyed all the great component powers and impulses of human nature,--had seen that their different combinations and subordinations were in fact the individualizers of men, and showed how their harmony was produced by reciprocal disproportions of excess or deficiency. The language in which these truths are expressed was not drawn from any set fashion, but from the profoundest depths of his moral being, and is therefore for all ages.|$|E

You haven't fifteen stations in America that are as big, and you probably haven't five that are half as fine. Why, it's perfectly elegant. And the clock! Everybody will show you the clock. There isn't a station in Europe that's got such a clock. It doesn't strike--and that's one mercy. It hasn't any bell; and as you'll have cause to remember, if you keep your reason, all Australia is simply bedamned with bells.

Well, of course, when they build and run eighty stations at a loss and a lot of palace-stations and clocks like Maryborough's at another loss, the government has got to economize somewhere hasn't it? Very well look at the rolling stock. That's where they save the money. Why, that train from Maryborough will consist of eighteen freight-cars and two passenger-kennels; cheap, poor, shabby, slovenly; no drinking water, no sanitary arrangements, every imaginable inconvenience; and slow?--oh, the gait of cold molasses; no air-brake, no springs, and they'll jolt your head off every time they start or stop. That's where they make their little economies, you see. They spend tons of money to house you palatially while you wait fifteen minutes for a train, then degrade you to six hours' convict-transportation to get the foolish outlay back. What a rational man really needs is discomfort while he's waiting, then his journey in a nice train would be a grateful change. But no, that would be common sense--and out of place in a government.

40|$|In modern {{political}} theory {{there are two}} models, or two conceptions, <b>of</b> <b>politics,</b> which are quite different. The one is usually called the spatial model, {{but it may also}} be called the ideological model. The other one does not have a common name, but it may be called the interest model.

These two models deal with very different aspects <b>of</b> <b>politics,</b> or even very different <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>politics.</b> Still the differences are often overlooked and the models are invoked almost simultaneously as if they are applicable in the same contexts, which creates confusion.

Many strands of contemporary scholarship converge {{on the image}} of the international as obsolete, but strongly diverge on the contours <b>of</b> the <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>politics</b> that are superseding it.

A departure in 'process philosophy' facilitate a rethinking of security, territory and authority as activities rather than things, as verbs rather than nouns.

40|$|Early {{engagement}} with geoengineering by social scientists indicates a certain suspicion over the motives {{and modes of}} operation of scientific research in the field. In part, this reflects the prominence of the critique <b>of</b> the <b>politics</b> <b>of</b> emergency in recent social and political thought: a thematisation that links securitisation measures with foreclosures of the political. This paper turns the attention back on the social sciences, arguing that recent styles of ontological and political thought do not prepare us well for engaging with geologic issues in general, and geoengineering in particular. It is suggested that, rather than viewing geoengineering discourses and imaginaries as a retreat from politics, we might view them as playing {{an important role in}} opening up new <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>politics</b> oriented towards earth systems and their dynamics. This new ‘geologic politics’ involves a turn from issues hinging on territorial divisions of the earth’s surface toward the strata that compose the deep temporal earth.

By Javier Cardoza-KonAs Heidegger {{himself has}} done with Nietzsche in {{claiming}} that he will articulate what Nietzsche meant but never said metaphysically, I also do with Heidegger in terms <b>of</b> <b>politics.</b> On my reading there are two <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>politics</b> in Heidegger's middle and late thought that are, for the most part, murky and confused. There is a <b>politics</b> <b>of</b> ontology the deals with the encountering and articulating of what beings are and what Being itself is.

It {{is in terms of}} the second type <b>of</b> <b>politics</b> that Heidegger is most often attacked, and for good reason.

I examine what it was in the confused and unarticulated relation between the two types <b>of</b> <b>politics</b> that not only allowed for his foray into Nazism, but also informed his Machiavellian views on technology.

40|$|There {{are many}} <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>{{politics}},</b> but if politics describes those institutions by which plural societies achieve collective and binding decisions (Crick 1962), then anti-politics describes negative feeling towards those institutions – including politicians, parties, councils, parliaments, and governments.

40|$|Bringing {{together}} ethnographic {{evidence from}} mid-Western Nepal and eastern Sri Lanka, {{this article explores}} how political legitimacy is constructed and contested in post-war environments. We posit that in the post-war context there are important changes in the <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>politics,</b> agenda-setting, players and tactics that are considered acceptable {{and those that are}} rendered transgressive, threats to order and stability, or otherwise placed ‘out of bounds’. The art of crafting political legitimacy is defined {{in sharp contrast to the}} immediate history of armed conflict. The end of the war and the resumption <b>of</b> supposedly democratic <b>politics</b> thus mark a shift in what is seen as legitimate or normal politics. This shift constrains certain <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> actors, tactics, and registers and it amplifies others, while being itself a result of political work. We argue that a reduction of the space for dissent, and an increase of the space for politicking are complementary aspects of the redefinition of what constitutes legitimate politics in the post-war context. These adverse political effects are not simply problems of context – post-war environments being non-conducive to democracy – but rather expose the more fundamental fallibilities and contradictions of demarcating a legitimate sphere <b>of</b> democratic <b>politics</b> in particularly visible and precarious ways...|$|R
40|$|In {{this last}} {{chapter of the}} book, Raia Prokhovnik finds support in Hobbes for an {{argument}} in favour of the inter-constitution of the concept <b>of</b> sovereignty and <b>politics.</b> She presents evidence that Hobbes has a broader and more complex understanding <b>of</b> <b>politics</b> than is usually acknowledged - an understanding embracing a <b>politics</b> <b>of</b> cooperation, the role of natural law in the international realm, and {{the recognition of the}} play of power as political - in the sense of contestation in which to negotiate epistemic indeterminacy and incommensurable difference. Prokhovnik then outlines a theory of the under-acknowledged political dimension of the concept of sovereignty, in terms of how we ask sovereignty to organise politics and the political (for instance in helping to shape the conduct and limits <b>of</b> <b>politics</b> within a specific polity) while being above the fray <b>of</b> <b>politics,</b> and how at the same time sovereignty is deeply political and conditional. On this basis, Prokhovnik develops the case that insight into Hobbes's theory helps advance the idea that the domestic and international realms are both primarily spheres <b>of</b> <b>politics</b> rather than <b>of</b> morality and law. Hobbes had a broader understanding than he is often credited with, <b>of</b> the <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>politics</b> that are appropriate. And while he sought to eliminate the effects of political contestation, his theorisation of a political rather than normative solution to the problem provides important support for rethinking international political space...|$|R
