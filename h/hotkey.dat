5|$|The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword is an action-adventure {{video game}} in which players take {{on the role of}} series protagonist Link through a series of overworlds {{populated}} by monsters and navigating dungeons featuring puzzles and further enemies including dedicated bosses. Link is controlled using the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, and the Wii MotionPlus expansion device is required to play. The greater majority of gameplay mechanics revolve around use of motion controls: these include camera control with the Nunchuck and general <b>hotkey</b> actions and movement linked to the Wii Remote. Jumping across gaps and scaling ledges happen automatically within context. The Nunchuck is also used to make Link perform a forward roll. In addition to his standard pace, Link can sprint for short distances. Sprinting and other actions such as climbing and carrying heavy objects is limited by a stamina meter, which recharges after a few seconds when not performing actions that drain it. When depleted entirely, Link's movement speed is reduced and he is left vulnerable until the meter refills. Standard navigation takes place from a third-person perspective, while the Dowsing search function switches to a first-person view: Dowsing scans an area for a selected object, with new Dowsing objectives appearing depending on game context.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new input technique, bimanual marking menus, and compares its performance with five other techniques: static toolbars, <b>hotkeys,</b> grouped <b>hotkeys,</b> marking menus, and toolglasses.
