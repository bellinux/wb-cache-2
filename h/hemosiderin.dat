5|$|Iron {{plays an}} {{important}} role in biology, forming complexes with molecular oxygen in hemoglobin and myoglobin; these two compounds are common oxygen transport proteins in vertebrates. Iron is also the metal at the active site of many important redox enzymes dealing with cellular respiration and oxidation and reduction in plants and animals. A human male of average height has about 4 grams of iron in his body, a female about 3.5 grams. This iron is distributed throughout the body in hemoglobin, tissues, muscles, bone marrow, blood proteins, enzymes, ferritin, <b>hemosiderin,</b> and transport in plasma.|$|E
25|$|Macrophages of the {{reticuloendothelial system}} store iron {{as part of}} the process of {{breaking}} down and processing hemoglobin from engulfed red blood cells. Iron is also stored as a pigment called <b>hemosiderin</b> which is an ill-defined deposit of protein and iron, created by macrophages where excess iron is present, either locally or systemically for example among people with iron overload due to frequent blood cell destruction and transfusions. If the systemic iron overload is corrected, over time the <b>hemosiderin</b> is slowly resorbed by macrophages.|$|E
25|$|During this time, larger bruises {{may change}} color {{due to the}} {{breakdown}} of hemoglobin from within escaped red blood cells in the extracellular space. The striking colors of a bruise are caused by the phagocytosis and sequential degradation of hemoglobin to biliverdin to bilirubin to <b>hemosiderin,</b> with hemoglobin itself producing a red-blue color, biliverdin producing a green color, bilirubin producing a yellow color, and <b>hemosiderin</b> producing a golden-brown color. As these products are cleared from the area, the bruise disappears. Often the underlying tissue damage has been repaired long before this process is complete.|$|E
25|$|This theory proposes {{how high}} {{pulmonary}} venous pressures {{may lead to}} the capillary rupture and the tissue changes observed in EIPH. Regional veno-occlusive remodeling, especially within the caudodorsal lung fields, contributes to the pathogenesis of EIPH, with the venous remodeling leading to regional vascular congestion and hemorrhage, <b>hemosiderin</b> accumulation, fibrosis, and bronchial angiogenesis.|$|E
25|$|Iron can {{be stored}} in {{ferritin}} as ferric iron due to the ferroxidase activity of the ferritin heavy chain. Dysfunctional ferritin may accumulate as <b>hemosiderin,</b> which can be problematic in cases of iron overload. The ferritin storage iron pool is much larger than the labile iron pool, ranging in concentration from 0.7 mM to 3.6 mM.|$|E
25|$|Iron {{is removed}} from heme and {{salvaged}} for later use, it is stored as <b>hemosiderin</b> or ferritin in tissues and transported in plasma by beta globulins as transferrins. When the porphyrin ring is broken up, the fragments are normally secreted as a yellow pigment called bilirubin, which is secreted into the intestines as bile. Intestines metabolise bilirubin into urobilinogen. Urobilinogen leaves the body in faeces, in a pigment called stercobilin. Globulin is metabolised into amino acids that are then released into circulation.|$|E
25|$|Cytopathology (examination under a microscope) {{of either}} a {{tracheal}} wash or a BAL sample can determine whether EIPH has occurred. The number of {{red blood cells}} present can be quantified using a hemocytometer. A normal lung wash sample contains fewer than 10 red blood cells/μl of fluid. In the case of EIPH, the numbers will be several magnitudes or more higher. The presence of high numbers of hemosiderophages indicate that hemorrhage {{has occurred in the}} lung at some time in the past. Hemosiderophages are alveolar macrophages that have ingested and digested red blood cells from previous episodes of EIPH. The end product of the digestion of the red blood cells is an iron-storage complex known as <b>hemosiderin.</b>|$|E
25|$|If {{keratoconus}} is suspected, the ophthalmologist or optometrist will {{search for}} other characteristic {{findings of the}} disease by means of slit lamp examination of the cornea. An advanced case is usually readily apparent to the examiner, and can provide for an unambiguous diagnosis prior to more specialized testing. Under close examination, a ring of yellow-brown to olive-green pigmentation known as a Fleischer ring {{can be observed in}} around half of keratoconic eyes. The Fleischer ring, caused by deposition of the iron oxide <b>hemosiderin</b> within the corneal epithelium, is subtle and may not be readily detectable in all cases, but becomes more evident when viewed under a cobalt blue filter. Similarly, around 50% of subjects exhibit Vogt's striae, fine stress lines within the cornea caused by stretching and thinning. The striae temporarily disappear while slight pressure is applied to the eyeball. A highly pronounced cone can create a V-shaped indentation in the lower eyelid when the person's gaze is directed downwards, known as Munson's sign. Other clinical signs of keratoconus will normally have presented themselves long before Munson's sign becomes apparent, and so this finding, though a classic sign of the disease, tends not to be of primary diagnostic importance.|$|E
2500|$|EIPH seldom {{causes the}} death of a horse, but if an {{affected}} horse dies and undergoes a post-mortem examination, repeated episodes of EIPH will have caused a characteristic blue-gray-brown staining in the lungs. The staining is due to the presence of <b>hemosiderin.</b> The staining is usually most intense in the dorso-caudal region of the left and right diaphragmatic lobes which often progresses cranioventral with repetitive damage. There are often distinct borders between healthy lung tissue and those parts of the lungs that have been affected by EIPH. [...] Other histopathologic findings include fibrosis, bronchial artery neovascularization, venous remodeling, [...] bronchiolitis, <b>hemosiderin</b> accumulation, increased tissue cellularity (i.e. hemosiderophages), multifocal areas of inflammation, and increased thickness of vascular and airway walls.|$|E
2500|$|The classic sign of PNH is red {{discoloration}} of {{the urine}} {{due to the}} presence of hemoglobin [...] and <b>hemosiderin</b> from the breakdown of red blood cells. As the urine is more concentrated in the morning, this is when the color is most pronounced. This phenomenon mainly occurs in those who have the primary form of PNH, who will notice this {{at some point in their}} disease course. The remainder mainly experience the symptoms of anemia, such as tiredness, shortness of breath, and palpitations.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Hemosiderin</b> or haemosiderin is an iron-storage complex. It is {{only found}} within cells (as opposed to {{circulating}} in blood) {{and appears to}} be a complex of ferritin, denatured ferritin and other material. The iron within deposits of <b>hemosiderin</b> is very poorly available to supply iron when needed. <b>Hemosiderin</b> can be identified histologically with [...] "Perls' Prussian-blue" [...] stain. In normal animals, <b>hemosiderin</b> deposits are small and commonly inapparent without special stains. Excessive accumulation of <b>hemosiderin</b> is usually detected within cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) or occasionally within epithelial cells of liver and kidney.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hemosiderin</b> {{hyperpigmentation}} is pigmentation due to {{deposits of}} <b>hemosiderin,</b> and occurs in purpura, hemochromotosis, hemorrhagic diseases, and stasis dermatitis.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hemosiderin</b> {{deposition}} {{in the lungs}} is often seen after diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, which occurs in diseases such as Goodpasture's syndrome, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis. Mitral stenosis {{can also lead to}} pulmonary hemosiderosis. <b>Hemosiderin</b> collects throughout the body in hemochromatosis. <b>Hemosiderin</b> {{deposition in}} the liver is a common feature of hemochromatosis and is the cause of liver failure in the disease. Selective iron deposition in the beta cells of pancreatic islets leads to diabetes due to distribution of transferrin receptor on the beta cells of islets [...] and in the skin leads to hyperpigmentation. <b>Hemosiderin</b> deposition in the brain is seen after bleeds from any source, including chronic subdural hemorrhage, cerebral arteriovenous malformations, cavernous hemangiomata. <b>Hemosiderin</b> collects in the skin and is slowly removed after bruising; <b>hemosiderin</b> may remain in some conditions such as stasis dermatitis. <b>Hemosiderin</b> in the kidneys has been associated with marked hemolysis and a rare blood disorder called paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hemosiderin</b> is most {{commonly}} found in macrophages and is especially abundant in situations following hemorrhage, suggesting that its formation {{may be related to}} phagocytosis of red blood cells and hemoglobin. <b>Hemosiderin</b> can accumulate in different organs in various diseases.|$|E

50|$|Free iron is {{toxic to}} cells as {{it acts as}} a {{catalyst}} {{in the formation of}} free radicals from reactive oxygen species via the Fenton Reaction. Hence vertebrates evolve an elaborate set of protective mechanisms to bind iron in various tissue compartments. Within cells, iron is stored in a protein complex as ferritin or <b>hemosiderin.</b> Apoferritin binds to free ferrous iron and stores it in the ferric state. As ferritin accumulates within cells of the reticuloendothelial system, protein aggregates are formed as <b>hemosiderin.</b> Iron in ferritin or <b>hemosiderin</b> can be extracted for release by the RE cells although <b>hemosiderin</b> is less readily available. Under steady state conditions, the serum ferritin level correlates with total body iron stores; thus, the serum ferritin FR5Rl is the most convenient laboratory test to estimate iron stores.|$|E

50|$|<b>Hemosiderin</b> often forms after {{bleeding}} (hemorrhage). When blood {{leaves a}} ruptured blood vessel, the {{red blood cell}} dies, and the hemoglobin of the cell is released into the extracellular space. Phagocytic cells (of the mononuclear phagocyte system) called macrophages engulf (phagocytose) the hemoglobin to degrade it, producing <b>hemosiderin</b> and biliverdin. Excessive systemic accumulations of <b>hemosiderin</b> may occur in macrophages in the liver, lungs, spleen, kidneys, lymph nodes, and bone marrow. These accumulations {{may be caused by}} excessive red blood cell destruction (haemolysis), excessive iron uptake/hyperferraemia, or decreased iron utilization (e.g. anemia of copper toxicity) /uptake hypoferraemia (which often leads to iron deficiency anemia).|$|E
50|$|<b>Hemosiderin</b> may deposit in {{diseases}} {{associated with}} iron overload. These diseases are typically diseases in which chronic blood loss requires frequent blood transfusions, such as {{sickle cell anemia}} and thalassemia, though beta thalassemia minor {{has been associated with}} <b>hemosiderin</b> deposits in the liver in those with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease independent of any transfusions.|$|E

50|$|Doucas and Kapetanakis {{pigmented}} purpura is a {{skin condition}} characterized by scaly and eczematous patches, which also have petechiae and <b>hemosiderin</b> staining.|$|E
50|$|Several disease {{processes}} {{result in}} deposition of larger amounts of <b>hemosiderin</b> in tissues; although these deposits often cause no symptoms, they {{can lead to}} organ damage.|$|E
50|$|Brown tumours {{consist of}} fibrous tissue, woven bone and {{supporting}} vasculature, but no matrix. The osteoclasts consume the trabecular bone that osteoblasts {{lay down and}} this front of reparative bone deposition followed by additional resorption can expand beyond the usual shape of the bone, involving the periosteum thus causing bone pain. The characteristic brown coloration results from <b>hemosiderin</b> deposition into the osteolytic cysts. <b>Hemosiderin</b> deposition is not a distinctive feature of brown tumors; {{it may also be}} seen in giant cell tumors of the bone.|$|E

50|$|Hemoglobinuria {{is another}} {{indicator}} of intravascular hemolysis, but disappears {{more quickly than}} <b>hemosiderin,</b> which can remain in the urine for several weeks; therefore, hemosiderinuria is a better marker for intravascular hemolysis.|$|E
50|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of erythema ab igne remains unknown. It {{has been}} proposed that thermal radiation exposure can induce epidermal damage to superficial blood vessels that subsequently leads to vascular dilation. Subsequent <b>hemosiderin</b> deposition can occur in a reticular distribution. The vasodilation of vessels presents morphologically as the initially observed erythema. Red blood cell extravasion and deposition of <b>hemosiderin</b> that follows clinically appears as hyperpigmentation. It has also been proposed that the distribution of affected blood vessels — predominantly in the superficial subcutaneous plexus (found in the papillary dermis)— results in the net-like pattern of erythema ab igne skin lesions.|$|E
50|$|Fleischer {{rings are}} {{pigmented}} rings in the peripheral cornea, resulting from iron deposition in basal epithelial cells, {{in the form}} of <b>hemosiderin.</b> They are usually yellowish to dark-brown, and may be complete or broken.|$|E
50|$|In {{excess of}} 40% of the {{developing}} erythrocytes are ringed sideroblasts. Serum iron, percentage saturation and ferritin are increased. The total iron-binding capacity of the cells is normal to decreased. Stainable marrow <b>hemosiderin</b> is increased.|$|E
50|$|Typical endometriotic lesions show histopathologic {{features}} {{similar to}} endometrium, namely endometrial stroma, endometrial epithelium, and glands that respond to hormonal stimuli.

5000|$|Hemosiderinuria (syn. haemosiderinuria), [...] "brown urine", {{occurs with}} chronic {{intravascular}} hemolysis, in which hemoglobin is released from RBCs {{into the bloodstream}} {{in excess of the}} binding capacity of haptoglobin. (Haptoglobin binds circulating hemoglobin and reduces renal excretion of hemoglobin, preventing tubular injury.) The excess hemoglobin is filtered by the kidney and reabsorbed in the proximal convoluted tubule, where the iron portion is removed and stored in ferritin or <b>hemosiderin.</b> The tubule cells of the proximal tubule slough off with the <b>hemosiderin</b> and are excreted into the urine, producing a [...] "brownish" [...] color. It is usually seen 3-4 days after the onset of hemolytic conditions.|$|E
