Michael Ausiello of TVLine reported that the producers included two extra musical performances to fill the extended time slot. Series creator Ian Brennan stated that he believed the extension was granted as there were two songs which would otherwise have been cut for length. He welcomed the additional 24minutes of screen time, and commented: [...] "We're always desperately cutting down our episodes. Even when we write them, and then in the editing room we're always throwing away stuff that <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>love</b> to get it down to time.

500|$|... "She's Madonna" [...] is a {{collaboration}} between Williams and Pet Shop Boys, and served as the fifth and final single from Williams' seventh studio album, Rudebox (2007). By the time the single {{was supposed to be}} released, he had just come out from rehab following his addiction problems. [...] "She's Madonna" [...] was inspired by a conversation Williams had with his ex-girlfriend Tania Strecker, who told the story of how her boyfriend, British director Guy Ritchie, left her for American singer Madonna. Strecker quoted Ritchie as saying, [...] "Look, you know <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>love</b> you, but she's Madonna." [...] Williams considered the song to be one of Rudeboxs lighter moments, clarifying that the track did not have a tongue in cheek connotation about it. Rather it literally spoke about his fantasies for Madonna and he was happy with the song's outcome. According to Contactmusic.com, Williams had played the song to Madonna shortly after writing it, receiving a positive reaction.|$|E

They would prefer that the last half of Barton Fink just be about a screenwriter's writing-block problems and how they get resolved in the real world...." [...] Talk show host Larry King expressed approval of the movie, despite its uncertain conclusion. He wrote in USA Today: [...] "The ending is something I'm still thinking about and if they accomplished that, I guess it worked." [...] In a 2016 interview, screenwriter Charlie Kaufman said after being asked which film he would want with him on a deserted island, [...] "A movie <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>love</b> is Barton Fink.

500|$|... "Footprints in the Sand" [...] {{was written}} by Simon Cowell, David Kreuger, Per Magnusson and Richard Page, whilst the {{production}} was helmed by Steve Mac. It was recorded in 2007 at Rokstone Studios in London, England. Cowell originally {{came up with the}} idea to base a song around the Christian poem [...] "Footprints", and suggested it to Kreuger and Magnusson. They had a scheduled session in Page's home in Malibu, California and finished the song the next day. Cowell secured a songwriting credit for coming up with the idea. In an interview with HitQuarters, Magnusson said they had thought the song would be a good idea for Irish boy band Westlife, but it was offered to British singer Leona Lewis instead. When Cowell mentioned the song concept to Lewis, she agreed that it could be [...] "really quite interesting". Regarding the song, Lewis commented: [...] "Originally it was a poem; it's very inspirational so we put it into a song. I think it is very moving, with a very emotional lyric and <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>love</b> to sing this song"; and added that the poem [...] " [...] about standing by someone and being there for people who need your help." ...|$|E

[...] The cover photo was taken at a show in 2006 at Sweet's Ballroom in Oakland, in which Saadiq performed Marvin Gaye's 1965 song [...] "Ain't That Peculiar". It showed Saadiq singing into a microphone with his arms raised and wearing a suit, tie, and thick-rimmed glasses: a look similar to that of Temptations singer David Ruffin. According to Saadiq, the photo [...] "set the tone for the whole album ... me singing that song, me wearing that suit, it said everything that this album should be." [...] Music journalist Greg Kot believed the cover [...] "evokes the dramatic portraits and color schemes of old-school jazz and soul albums. Think Ray Charles on Atlantic, Sonny Rollins on Blue Note, Sam and Dave on Stax ... With arms raised, he looks like he's testifying as much as singing." [...] The rest of the album's packaging also adheres to a retro aesthetic with its crimson-tinted cover's font and 1960s Columbia Records logo. The packaging's photography was taken by Norman Seeff.|$|E

But I didn't like that. I thought let's do something unexpected. So our inspirations were very bizarre. We took sort of like 1940s, hard-boiled noir women and mixed it with a sort of Comme des Garçons meets Japanese thing. I was very proud of that look and I thought Franny was very yummy.

2500|$|Events {{elsewhere}} {{were now}} to have major consequences {{for the war in}} Italy. With Villeroi's crushing defeat by Marlborough at the Battle of Ramillies on 23 May, Louis XIV recalled Vendôme north to take command of French forces in Flanders. It was a transfer that Saint-Simon considered something of a deliverance for the French commander who was [...] "now beginning to feel the unlikelihood of success [...] … for Prince Eugene, with the reinforcements that had joined him after the Battle of Calcinato, had entirely changed the outlook in that theatre of the war." [...] The Duke of Orléans, under the direction of Marsin, replaced Vendôme, but indecision and disorder in the French camp led to their undoing. After uniting his forces with Victor Amadeus at Villastellone in early September, Eugene attacked, overwhelmed, and decisively defeated the French forces besieging Turin on 7 September. Eugene's success broke the French hold on northern Italy, and the whole Po valley fell under Allied control. Eugene had gained a victory as signal as his colleague had at Ramillies—"It is impossible for me to express the joy it has given me;" [...] wrote Marlborough, [...] "for I not only esteem but <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>love</b> the prince.

[...] "As soon as the bass got in there…" [...] Matt Wachter continued. [...] "Yeah, so it was either replace Matt or throw the song out." [...] Jared played it acoustically for Josh Abraham; [...] "I was playing it outside of the studio one night on acoustic guitar and Josh walked out and, as a joke, I said 'Hey, you wanna hear a hit song?' I was just talking. I started playing the verse and went into the chorus and he stopped me on the first chorus and said 'It's the best song you have. You have to record it'. So we all got in a circle and something about it changed. Something about us changed. And it became the first song on the record and the first single off our album.
