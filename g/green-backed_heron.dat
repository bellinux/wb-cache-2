5000|$|Butorides is a genus {{of small}} herons. It {{contains}} three similar species, the green heron or <b>green-backed</b> <b>heron,</b> Butorides virescens, the lava heron (Butorides sundevalli), and the striated heron, Butorides striatus. A fossil species, Butorides validipes, is {{known from the}} Early Pleistocene of Florida in the United States. Butorides is from Middle English Butor [...] "bittern" [...] and Ancient Greek -oides, [...] "resembling".|$|E
5000|$|The lava heron (Butorides sundevalli), {{also known}} as the Galápagos heron, is a species of heron endemic to the Galápagos Islands of Ecuador. It is {{considered}} by some authorities — including the American Ornithological Society and BirdLife International — to be a subspecies (or even just a colour morph) of the striated heron (B. striata), and was formerly [...] "lumped" [...] with this species and the green heron (B. virescens) as the <b>green-backed</b> <b>heron.</b>|$|E

50|$|Cowan Lake is {{surrounded}} by a deciduous forest of beech and maple trees. The combination of lake and forest makes the park a destination for birders, who can observe mallards, American wigeons, mergansers, great blue and <b>green-backed</b> <b>herons,</b> killdeer, eastern bluebirds, catbirds, and many other species of birds. The most common mammals at the park are groundhogs, skunks, raccoons, and opossums.|$|R
50|$|The Seychelles bulbul is social, {{living in}} pairs, family groups or small flocks in forest and {{woodland}} {{from the sea}} to the mountains on granitic mountains. The species is omnivorous, taking fruit, flowers, eggs, and insects gleaned from foliage or hawked during short flights. They are very aggressive towards other birds species, chasing away birds as large as <b>green-backed</b> <b>herons</b> from areas {{in which they are}} feeding.|$|R
50|$|Upwards of 170 native {{bird species}} have been recorded, but the {{presence}} or breeding of some have been transient, due to urbanization and other factors. Resident or visiting passerine birds include thick-billed weaver, southern red bishop, African reed-warbler, little rush-warbler and lesser swamp-warbler. Various heron species visit the reserve, including black-crowned night-heron, little bittern, <b>green-backed</b> <b>heron,</b> purple heron, black and little egret. Other regular water birds are red-knobbed coot, fulvous duck, Egyptian goose, white-faced duck, Cape teal and southern pochard. Pinioned crowned cranes and blue cranes have been released into the reserve, and some exotic duck species are present.|$|E
50|$|The {{striated}} heron (Butorides striata) {{also known as}} mangrove heron, little heron or <b>green-backed</b> <b>heron,</b> is a small heron. Striated herons are mostly non-migratory and noted for some interesting behavioral traits. Their breeding habitat is small wetlands in the Old World tropics from west Africa to Japan and Australia, and in South America. Vagrants have been recorded on oceanic islands, such as Chuuk and Yap in the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marianas and Palau; the bird recorded on Yap on February 25, 1991, was from a continental Asian rather than from a Melanesian population, while {{the origin of the}} bird seen on Palau on May 3, 2005 was not clear.|$|E
5000|$|A {{variety of}} bird species inhabit the area, {{including}} great blue heron, <b>green-backed</b> <b>heron,</b> mallard, wood duck, belted kingfisher, marsh wren, common yellowthroat, red-winged blackbird, and swamp sparrow. Eighteen Mile Creek is particularly significant because large concentrations of Coho and Chinook salmon and brown trout migrate from Lake Ontario into the creek each fall. In addition, steelhead migrate into Eighteen Mile Creek {{during the fall}} and between late February and April. Due {{to the importance of}} this area, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation has determined that, [...] "Disturbances of wetland vegetation, including submergent beds, through dredging, filling, or bulkheading Olcott Harbor, would result in a direct loss of valuable habitat area." ...|$|E
50|$|The refuge bird list {{contains}} 243 species {{recorded on}} the refuge and includes wintering lesser scaup, oldsquaws, white-winged scoters, ruddy ducks, canvasbacks, buffleheads, redheads, and pintails. Numerous marsh and shore birds migrate through {{in spring and}} fall. Mallards, black ducks, wood ducks, great blue <b>herons,</b> and <b>green-backed</b> <b>herons</b> nest at the refuge. Birds of prey are also common {{and in some cases}} abundant at the refuge according to visitor guides. Bald eagles have fledged young each year since 1986, osprey establish nests in the spring and head south before the fall, and turkey vultures are abundant throughout the year.|$|R

50|$|In 1833, {{hydraulic}} {{engineer and}} entrepreneur Eliakim Crosby built the Cascade Race, a waterway that powered the mills and businesses along the Ohio & Erie Canal. The Cascade Race helped transform Akron into a boomtown. Years later, Crosby built the failed Chuckery Race; traces {{of it can}} still be seen in this Metro Park. Today, fish here are prey for belted kingfishers and great blue or <b>green-backed</b> <b>herons.</b> Beautiful white trillium grows in the floodplain woods each spring beside wild ginger and several types of violets. Summer and fall wildflowers also flourish, illuminating the landscape. Several rare and unique natural features can be found within the Chuckery Area. South of the entrance drive, near {{the intersection of the}} Chuckery Trail, is a meadow that harbors many unusual plants and several species of showy wildflowers. Just up the hill from the meadow is prairie, where wild lupines bloom about mid-May. Other rare species can be found individually throughout the park, including butternut trees - a species surviving despite the butternut canker disease threatening their range. Less conspicuous, but no less rare, are crinkled hairgrass, satin brome and southern hairy rock cress.|$|R

40|$|Birds were {{surveyed}} in several isolated freshwater wetlands on John F. Kennedy Space Center to determine species composition {{and the importance}} of these wet- lands to birds. The Red-winged Blackbird and <b>Green-backed</b> <b>Heron</b> were the two most abundant breeders in the swale marshes. The Common Yellowthroat was the most common winter resident but was rare in summer. These marshes are important features within landscapes dominated by uplands particularly because of their significance to amphibians and reptiles...|$|E
40|$|The diverse {{breeding}} bird fauna of Israel comprises elements from various zoogeographical regions. This is predominantly {{attributed to the}} zoogeo-graphic position of Israel and its high habitat diversity. In this article I provide information on six bird species new to breeding in Israel since 1995 : <b>green-backed</b> <b>heron</b> (Butorides striatus), purple gallinule (Porphyrio porphyrio), painted snipe (Rostratula benghalensis), thick-billed lark (Rhamphocoris clotbey), wallcreeper (Tichodroma muraria), and common mynah (Acrido-theres tristis). The data provided here on the breeding habits of each species vary in extent. A recently fledged wallcreeper comprises the only indication of the species ’ breeding in the country, or near its borders. In the cases of the purple gallinule and the painted snipe, adults were found rearing their young, while the <b>green-backed</b> <b>heron</b> and, especially, the thick-billed lark were studied throughout their entire breeding period. The common mynah is a recently introduced species whose local breeding features {{have not yet been}} thoroughly studied. The wallcreeper has a Central Palearctic distribution, while the remaining species or subspecies have a desert distribution within the Palearctic or a Paleotropic distribution. It is striking that most of the local breeding events of these species are closely connected to human-induced habitat modifications. With the addition of these six new breeding species, the total number of bird species found to breed in Israel is now 210, although some of these species no longer do so...|$|E
