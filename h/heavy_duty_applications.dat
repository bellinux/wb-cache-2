5000|$|There are {{multiple}} designs of vehicle clutch, {{but most are}} based on one or more friction discs pressed tightly together or against a flywheel using springs. The friction material varies in composition depending on many considerations such as whether the clutch is [...] "dry" [...] or [...] "wet". Friction discs once contained asbestos, but this has been largely discontinued. Clutches found in <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> <b>applications</b> such as trucks and competition cars use ceramic plates that have a greatly increased friction coefficient. However, these have a [...] "grabby" [...] action generally considered unsuitable for passenger cars. The spring pressure is released when the clutch pedal is depressed thus either pushing or pulling the diaphragm of the pressure plate, depending on type. Raising the engine speed too high while engaging the clutch causes excessive clutch plate wear. Engaging the clutch abruptly when the engine is turning at high speed causes a harsh, jerky start. This kind of start is necessary and desirable in drag racing and other competitions, where speed {{is more important than}} comfort.|$|E
50|$|The {{strength}} and stiffness of pavement layers determines {{the performance of}} highway pavements while aggregate use impacts the cost of duration of installation; therefore alternatives are needed to improve pavement quality using new materials with less aggregate usage (Rajagopal et al 2012). Geocells are recognized as a suitable geosynthetic reinforcement of granular soils to support static and moving wheel loads on roadways, railways and similar applications. But stiffness of the geocells {{was identified as a}} key influencing factor for geocell reinforcement, and hence the rigidity of the entire pavement structure. Utilizing recent advances in polymer and nano technology, extensive R&D was carried out to improve geocell wall stiffness, thermal and elastic properties and long term creep resistance by PRS-Med. The result was a cellular confinement system (PRS-Neoweb) manufactured from Neoloy, a novel polymeric alloy (NPA). NPA is a composite alloy of polyamide nano-fibers dispersed in a polyethylene matrix. It provides ductility similar to HDPE with elastic behavior similar to engineering thermoplastics, to create a stiffer CCS more suitable for <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> <b>applications,</b> such as base reinforcement of highways, railways, container yards, etc. that are subject to long-term heavy static and dynamic loading.|$|E
5000|$|The Dana/Spicer Model 80 is an {{automotive}} axle {{manufactured by}} Dana Holding Corporation {{and has been}} used in OEM <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> <b>applications</b> by Chevrolet, Dodge, and Ford.

Dana 80's are made as full floating, rear axles only and are step up in overall strength compared to the Dana 70. 1988 Ford was the first company to use the Dana 80. The Dana 80 has a GAWR up to 11000 lb, however it is common practice among manufacturers to derate Dana 80's. Gross axle weight ratings are lowered by the vehicle manufacturer for safety and tire reasons.

Trac Loks are currently a $350.00 USD option with Ford Super Duty trucks. [...] The Dana 80 Trac Lok is unique being it is a 4 pinion unit, unlike other Dana Trac Lok units with 2 pinions.

40|$|Many of {{the newly}} issued {{corporate}} bonds are finding their way into insurance and pension fund asset portfolios. Modelling these bonds is tricky. Historic return distributions are well behaved and the observed credit spreads exceed all estimates of historic default probabilities. As a result, corporate bonds may appear anomalously attractive. We show {{that some of the}} more widely used models of corporate bonds have some major weaknesses from a theoretical perspective and in particular fail to explain this apparent anomaly convincingly. However, our analysis of the economics of corporate debt early in the paper suggests that credit spreads are option premiums and thus have option-like characteristics. This leads to the Merton Model as a means of capturing these characteristics. The model reveals that the apparent anomaly in credit spreads is another facet of well known apparent anomalies in option prices under the standard Black Scholes Model (such as the existence of skews and smiles in implied volatility). The latter anomalies are not generally regarded as exploitable in asset allocation studies. Armed with the insights from this model, suitable for <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> <b>application</b> in pricing contingent claims based on default, we return to the simpler problem of modelling corporate bond portfolios. We suggest that complexity in these models inevitable, given that a rebalancing investment process must be modelled {{and that there is a}} fundamental arbitrariness in the relevant grade categories on which the process is based. Having considered these issues we suggest that, despite its sledge-hammer appearance the Merton Model provides a solid foundation for alternative approaches to modelling such portfolios that ensures consistency and reduces the risk of anomalies. In particular we reconcile well-known approximations in terms of special cases of this model. ...|$|R
40|$|A system {{analysis}} and preliminary design were conducted for an organic Rankine-cycle system to bottom the high-temperature waste heat of an adiabatic diesel engine.

The secrets of this engine&# 039;s performances are the high compression ratio and the lean bulk combustion mostly diffusion controlled {{in addition to the}} partial recovery of the exhaust energy to boost the charging efficiency. The major downfalls of this engine are the carbon dioxide emissions and the depletion of natural resources using fossil Diesel, the energy security issues of using foreign fuels in general, and finally the difficulty to meet future emission standards, for the intrinsically "dirty" combustion of the fuel made up of a mixture of many hydrocarbon being injected in liquid state and the lack of maturity for the lean burn after treatment system. Renewable hydrogen is a possible replacement {{for the future of the}} Diesel that is free of carbon dioxide and other major emissions with the only exception of nitric dioxides, and it therefore makes sense to discuss the option to convert not only passenger car engines, but also <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> truck engines to run hydrogen. In this paper, a <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> Diesel truck engine is modelled and converted to run hydrogen only with goals retaining the same of Diesel full and part load efficiencies and power and torque outputs.

To increase the total efficiency and reduce CO 2 emissions, recently exhaust heat recovery (EHR) based on thermoelectric (TE) and thermal fluid systems have been explored widely and a number of new technologies have been developed in the past decade. In this paper, relevant researches are reviewed for providing an insight into possible system designs, thermodynamic principles to achieve high efficiency, and selection of working fluids to maintain necessary system performance. From a number of researches, it has been found the Rankine cycle (RC) has been the most favourite basic working cycle for thermodynamic EHR systems.
