50|$|By 1895, Ferris {{had gained}} a {{reputation}} as a historical painter, and he embarked on his dream of creating a series of paintings that told a historical narrative. In 1898 he sold one of these, General Howe's Levee, 1777, but he later regretted it, realizing that such a series could not be complete if the separate paintings could not be kept together. Consequently, he never sold another one of those, but he did sell the reproduction rights to various publishing companies. This later would have the effect of greatly popularizing his work, as these companies made prints, postcards, calendars and blank-backed trade cards to use in advertisements. <b>Laminated</b> <b>cards</b> of these works were still being sold as late as 1984.|$|R
