40|$|Waxflower (Chamelacium Uncinatum) {{originates}} in west Australia and {{includes more than}} 20 species. Waxflower is mainly used as bouquet filler. In Israel there is 200 hectare of Waxflower cultivars grown in open fields with an average annual yield of 350, 000 flowers per hectare. The growing processes of Waxflowers are labor intensive, and {{the large numbers of}} workers involved in the various operations cause bottlenecks that affect costs and working efficiency. The main bottleneck points are in the sorting and packaging stages that take about 60 - 80 % of the total time invested in the production process. Work efficiency improvement is extremely important due to the high dependency and unstable availability of manpower. The objectives of the present study were to improve work methods of Waxflower farms, to increase productivity and quality and to develop an optimal branch cutting methodology in order to maximize the total revenue. The research was performed during the years 2005 – 2006 in two modern farms {{in the southern part of}} Israel. The farms consist of 7 and 13 hectare of various species of Waxflowers in open fields. On each <b>farm,</b> <b>work</b> <b>studies</b> and time measurements were performed in the various stages of sorting and packaging, and an optimal brunch cutting methodology was developed. The results showed that the sorting station yield was 1781 - 2113 flowers per hour depending on the cultivar. As for the binding station, it was found that one-step binding bundles of 25 flowers each is more efficient than binding five bundles of five flowers each (two steps) ...|$|R

Sally Fletcher (Kate Ritchie) enquires about Annie's {{schooling}} and Bruce tells her Annie is being home schooled, but it soon becomes apparent that Bruce is lying. Annie enrols at Summer Bay High and Lucas Holden (Rhys Wakefield) helps her, but Geoff sees Lucas as a bad person and continually argues with him. After falling asleep due to <b>farm</b> <b>work</b> and <b>study</b> one day, Annie crashes out on Lucas' bed and is found by Bruce who assumes the worst and drags her home. Belle Taylor (Jessica Tovey) notices Annie has a crush on Lucas and mentions to her that Lucas lost his virginity to her; which horrifies Annie. Matters are made worse when Belle gives her a teen magazine with a sealed sex and relationships section, which Bruce mistakes for pornography. Annie is then locked in her room after being ordered to pray for forgiveness.|$|R

40|$|This study set out {{to explore}} the effects of gender {{division}} of labour on {{boys and girls in}} the rural area of Medig, Metta in Cameroon. The main activity of parents in this area is farming. Children, besides going to school, have a role in the household work and they also assist their parents on their farms. Combining household chores and <b>farm</b> <b>work</b> with <b>studies</b> affect the education of the children. The study revealed that in addition to the need for labour, poverty and cultural beliefs of rural parents have contributed to the decision to put their children in domestic and farm activities, bringing about gender division of labour. Gender determined roles continue even in school. Feminist and Maslow‟s theories were used to guide the findings of gender division of labour between the children in Medig. The Feminist theories helped to explain the reasons behind gender discrimination in work type, while Maslow‟s theory focused on the psycho-social dilemmas children face when motivation and encouragement is lacking in the home and in their learning process. The data for the study was collected from primary and secondary sources. Qualitative research method was employed {{in the collection of the}} primary data. These sources helped in the assessment of gender division of labour in Medig from the perceptive of parents, teachers and pupils through oral interviews with the aid of semi-structured questions. The results showed that gender division of labour between the children is part of the social relations between parents and children. It is a way of transmitting their culture to the children such that, it remains inevitable for their livelihoods and the upbringing of children. This leads to the relegation of education to a secondary position if not total neglect...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} hybrid Petri nets into modeling for <b>farm</b> <b>work</b> flow {{in agricultural}} production. The main {{emphasis is on}} the construction of an adequate model for designing practical <b>farm</b> <b>work</b> planning for agriculture production corporations. Hybrid Petri nets conventionally comprise a continuous part and a discrete part. The continuous part mainly models the practical work in the farmland, and the discrete part mainly represents the status changes in resources such as machinery and labor. The proposed model also models the present status or undesirable breaks during the farming process. Moreover, in this paper, the approach of formulating the <b>farm</b> <b>work</b> planning problem based on the model is suggested. The simulated results reveal that the hybrid Petri nets model is promising for exactly describing the farming process and reallocating resources in the presence of uncertainties. The proposed model serves as a referential model for <b>farm</b> <b>work</b> planning and it promotes the development of a corresponding optimization algorithm under uncertain environments...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the relations among mental disorders, physical discomfort, household <b>work</b> and <b>farm</b> <b>work</b> among women. We conducted a cross-sectional study based on the administration of a structured questionnaire to 182 female farm workers. The data were analyzed by means of Poisson regression, where the significance level was set to 5 %. Results indicated that 111 (61 %) participants reported work-related mental disorders and physical discomfort was reported by 160 (87. 9 %). The participants with mental disorders and at least moderate levels of physical discomfort reported {{significantly higher levels of}} physical demand, time working (temporal demand), total effort and frustration with regard to <b>farm</b> <b>work,</b> in addition to significantly higher levels of frustration with regard to housework. Women with moderate or greater levels of both physical discomfort and frustration with <b>farm</b> <b>work</b> increased the chances of mental disorders. The results illustrate the complex challenge for health professionals in caring for women with mental disorders and physical discomforts related to their <b>farm</b> <b>work,</b> in the context of both the <b>farm</b> and domestic <b>work</b> demands these workers experience...|$|R

40|$|Farmworkers {{experience}} many work-related hazards, including {{exposure to}} neurotoxicants. We compared neurobehavioral performance of 288 farmworkers in central Florida {{who had done}} <b>farm</b> <b>work</b> for at least 1 month with 51 controls who had not. Most of the farmworkers had worked {{in one or more}} of three types of agriculture: ornamental ferns, nurseries, or citrus fruit. We collected information on <b>farm</b> <b>work</b> history in a structured interview and evaluated neurobehavioral performance using a battery of eight tests. Analyses were adjusted for established confounders including age, sex, education, and acculturation. Ever having done <b>farm</b> <b>work</b> was associated with poor performance on four tests [...] digit span [odds ratio (OR) = 1. 90; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1. 02 - 3. 53], tapping (coefficient = 4. 13; 95 % CI, 0. 00 - 8. 27), Santa Ana test (coefficient = 1. 34; 95 % CI, 0. 29 - 2. 39), and postural sway (coefficient = 4. 74; 95 % CI, - 2. 20 to 11. 7) [...] but had little effect on four others: symbol digit latency, vibrotactile threshold, visual contrast sensitivity, and grip strength. Associations with <b>farm</b> <b>work</b> were similar in magnitude to associations with personal characteristics such as age and sex. Longer duration of <b>farm</b> <b>work</b> was associated with worse performance. Associations with fern work were more consistent than associations with nursery or citrus work. Deficits related to the duration of work experience were seen in former as well as current farmworkers, and decreased performance was related to chronic exposure {{even in the absence of}} a history of pesticide poisoning. We conclude that long-term experience of <b>farm</b> <b>work</b> is associated with measurable deficits in cognitive and psychomotor function...|$|R
