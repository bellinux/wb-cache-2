On April 17, 1879, the original non-elected courts of sessions were abolished in favour of elected councils when The County <b>Incorporation</b> <b>Act</b> came into force.

25|$|In 1840 the Sydney City Council was established.

Australia's first parliamentary elections were conducted for the New South Wales Legislative Council in 1843, again with voting rights (for males only) tied to property ownership or financial capacity.

25|$|This is {{a matter}} of vital {{importance}} because a problem of economic development is identifying the membership of customary landowning groups and the owners. Disputes between mining and forestry companies and landowner groups often devolve on the issue of whether the companies entered into contractual relations for the use of land with the true owners. Customary property — usually land — cannot be devised by will. It can only be inherited according to the custom of the deceased's people. The Lands Act was amended in 2010 along with the Land Group <b>Incorporation</b> <b>Act,</b> intended to improve the management of state land, mechanisms for dispute resolution over land, and to enable customary landowners to be better able to access finance and possible partnerships over portions of their land, if they seek to develop it for urban or rural economic activities. The Land Group <b>Incorporation</b> <b>Act</b> requires more specific identification of the customary landowners than hitherto and their more specific authorisation before any land arrangements are determined; (a major issue {{in recent years has been}} a land grab, using, or rather misusing, the Lease-Leaseback provision under the Land Act, notably using 'Special Agricultural and Business Leases' (SABLs) to acquire vast tracts of customary land, purportedly for agricultural projects, but in an almost all cases as a back-door mechanism for securing tropical forest resources for logging — circumventing the more exacting requirements of the Forest Act, for securing Timber Permits (which must comply with sustainability requirements and be competitively secured, and with the customary landowners approval). Following a national outcry, these SABLs have been subject to a Commission of Inquiry, established in mid-2011, for which the report is still awaited for initial presentation to the Prime Minister and Parliament.|$|E
25|$|Under the {{leadership}} of such men as Carmichael and Nicholson, Mitchell, engineer Norman Selfe, and businessman Thomas Barker (who had been elected to the council of the Australian College in 1831) the school flourished {{and became one of}} the leading providers of adult education in the colony with more than 1500 students attending lectures and classes. Among those who gave classes were suffragist Louisa Lawson, explorer Ludwig Leichhardt and poet Henry Kendall, and subjects included art, mathematics, architecture, anatomy and simple surgery. Officers and teachers of the school, such as Nicholson and Dr John Woolley, also {{played a role in the}} establishment of the University of Sydney. The school was originally incorporated under its own Act of Parliament in 1874 with the Sydney Mechanics' School of Arts <b>Incorporation</b> <b>Act.</b> This was later replaced by an Act of the same name in 1886 that allowed greater financial freedom to the school's governing committee (namely the ability to borrow money and sell school assets) and amended in 1929 and 1940 to allow, respectively, the sale of the land granted by Governor Bourke and a reduction in size of the committee.|$|E
40|$|Progressive legal theorist Daniel Crane {{has argued}} that libertarians who believe that {{monopoly}} results from government intervention should accept antitrust law because the monopoly problem {{is a result of}} state government passage of General <b>Incorporation</b> <b>Acts</b> after the Civil War.

500|$|Among Deady's {{work is the}} General Laws of Oregon, {{which he}} {{compiled}} and annotated in 1866. This work consisted of a Code of Civil Procedure, a Penal Code, and a Code of Criminal Procedure. In this role he not only codified existing laws, but also made new laws. Deady often drafted the legislation that led to state statutes, thus playing {{a crucial role in}} the lawmaking process in the state of Oregon between 1859 and 1872. In 1874, Deady and fellow code commissioner and later U.S. Representative Lafayette Lane updated Deady’s earlier compilation of the state’s laws. His criminal laws remained largely in effect in Oregon until the legislature revised much of those laws in 1971. Deady also was the author of the state's business <b>incorporation</b> <b>act.</b> The act was the first in the country to place all business corporations on the same level by requiring a minimum of three people to incorporate as a business. Regarding Deady's contributions to Oregon, former Oregon Supreme Court justice and United States Attorney General George Henry Williams said: [...] "No hand has been so strongly and deeply impressed upon the legislative and judicial history of Oregon as that of Judge Deady." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Frederick and Pennsylvania Line Railroad Company's <b>incorporation</b> <b>act</b> was {{modified}} {{a second time}} in 1870 by the Maryland General Assembly to authorize it to build a rail line south from Frederick City, its then authorized terminus through Frederick and Montgomery Counties, {{and on to the}} boundary of the District of Columbia, so as to make a direct connection with the city of Washington. The F was authorized to connect with or cross over any railway in Frederick or Montgomery counties as well as construct one or more branches, none of which could exceed [...] in length. The railroad was authorized to build a right of way [...] in width, modified as necessary for cuts and fills. The company was authorized to issue another $3 million ($=) in stock or bonds for this purpose. The extension had to be commenced within five years (1875) and at least one set of tracks completed by 1880. This target schedule for starting construction was revised in 1874 to 1876 and complete one track by 1882, but the railroad was never extended south of its 1872 terminus.|$|E
2500|$|The {{sales of}} stock {{attracted}} Boston investors—including Thomas J. Hill, Lyman Nichols, George L. Ward and Alexander De Witt. De Witt convinced textile and rail tycoon Benjamin Bates, then-President of the Union Pacific Railroad {{to come to}} Lewiston and fund the emerging Lewiston Water Power Company. Soon after Bates arrived the company created the first canal in the city. In the spring of 1850 some 400 men recruited in and around Boston by construction contractor Patrick O'Donnell arrived in Lewiston and began work on the canal system. Impressed with the labor force and [...] "working spirit" [...] of the Lewistonions, Bates founded the Bates Manufacturing Company leading {{to the construction of}} 5 mills starting with Bates Mill No. 1. In August 1850, Maine Governor John Hubbard signed the <b>incorporation</b> <b>act</b> and the mill was completed 1852. Bates positioned the mill in Lewiston due to the location of the Lewiston Falls which provided the mill with power. Under Bates' supervision, during the Civil War, the mill produced textiles to the Union Army. His mills generated employment for thousands of Canadians, and immigrants from Europe. The mill was Maine's largest employer for three decades.This began the transformation from a small farming town into a textile manufacturing center on the model of Lowell, Massachusetts. The creation of the Bates manufuacturing trusts saw rapid economic growth, positioning the city as the weathiest city in Maine, and created budding affluent district such as the Main Street–Frye Street Historic District. Although the odd-majority of the population was working class, a distinctive upper class was emerged at this time. The Bates Mill remained the largest employer in Lewiston from the 1850s to the mid-late 20th century.Railroad construction was key to the development of both Lewiston and its neighbor, Auburn. In 1849 the Androscoggin & Kennebec railroad, running through Lewiston and Auburn, connected these towns to Waterville and the St. Lawrence & Atlantic Railway line between Portland, Maine and Montreal, Quebec. The Androscoggin & Kennebec Railroad was constructed by Irish laborers, many of whom joined the Lewiston canal construction crews in 1850. The Irish laborers and their families lived in shanty town neighborhoods called [...] "patches". By 1854 one quarter of Lewiston's population was Irish, the highest concentration of any settlement in Maine. Subsequently, trains connected Quebec with Lewiston on a daily schedule. During the Civil War, the high demand for textiles helped Lewiston develop a strong industrial base through the Bates Enterprise. However, the concentration of wealth in Benjamin Bates sparked the 1861 Lewiston cotton riots which prompted him to give thousands of dollars back to the city and expand the employment opportunities at his mills. In 1861, a flood of French-Canadian immigration into Maine began, spawned by industrial work opportunities in Maine cities with water power from waterfalls. This brought a significant influx of Québécois millworkers who worked alongside Irish immigrants and Yankee mill girls. Lewiston's population boomed between 1840 and 1890 from 1,801 to 21,701. Canadiens settled in an area downtown that became known as Little Canada, and Lewiston's character has remained largely Franco-American ever since. In 1855, Maine preacher traveled from Parsonsfield to Lewiston to establish is institution of higher learning in the city. In 1855, the Maine State Legislature was petitioned by Lewiston locals to found the Maine State Seminary. The school opened in 1855, was educated the working class of Maine while also providing education for blacks and women at a time when other universities barred the activity. At its founding it became the first coeducational college in New England and one of the earliest proponents of abolitionism.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{explores the}} issues of {{existing}} social enterprise acts and the possibility to have separate <b>incorporation</b> <b>acts</b> and legal framework for the revenue generating not-for-profit green social enterprises (NPRGSEs) and for the transforming green social enterprise microfinance institutions (MFIs) in Ontario. This agenda is very important and urgent in the cutback policy era in Ontario to reduce the dependence of green social enterprises on public resources {{as well as to}} develop alternative strategies for their internal fund mobilization process. The separate <b>Incorporation</b> <b>Acts</b> for these NPRGSEs would allow them to establish partnerships among private and NPRGSEs/NGOs; would license them to collect public deposits, pubic savings, issue bonds and invest that money in social enterprises development in Ontario. This investment process would help NPRGSEs mobilize their internal funds as well as promote green small enterprises and serve as a community outreach in Ontario. The earnings from this internal fund mobilization process would also be used by NPRGSEs for scaling up outreach programs. In order to make these happen, this paper recommends establishing an independent „Green Social Enterprise Commission ‟ where solid green social enterprise polices and Acts would be developed and executed. The Green Social Enterprise Commission would also monitor the activities of the NPRGSEs and allow non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to transform into green social enterprises MFIs...|$|R
