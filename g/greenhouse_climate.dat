50|$|Calcite seas were {{coincident}} with {{times of}} rapid seafloor spreading and global <b>greenhouse</b> <b>climate</b> conditions (Stanley and Hardie, 1999). Seafloor spreading centers cycle seawater through hydrothermal vents, reducing {{the ratio of}} magnesium to calcium in the seawater through metamorphism of calcium-rich minerals in basalt to magnesium-rich clays (Wilkinson and Given, 1986; Lowenstein et al., 2001). This reduction in the Mg/Ca ratio favors the precipitation of calcite over aragonite. Increased seafloor spreading also means increased volcanism and elevated levels of {{carbon dioxide in the}} atmosphere and oceans. This may also have an effect on which polymorph of calcium carbonate is precipitated (Lowenstein et al., 2001). Further, high calcium concentrations of seawater favor the burial of CaCO3, thereby removing alkalinity from the ocean, lowering seawater pH and reducing its acid/base buffering.|$|E

40|$|Optimal {{control systems}} {{are based on}} a {{performance}} measure to be optimised and a model description of the dynamic process to be controlled. When on-line implementation is considered, the performance of optimally controlled processes will depend on the accuracy of the model description used. Sensitivity analysis offers insight into the impact of uncertainty in the model parameters on the performance of the optimally controlled process. Additionally, sensitivity analysis may reveal the mechanisms underlying optimal process operation. This paper describes the methodology and results of a sensitivity analysis of an optimal control problem in <b>greenhouse</b> <b>climate</b> management. The methodology used, is based on variational arguments and requires a single solution of the optimal control problem, resulting in a computationally efficient technique. The example considered deals with economic optimal <b>greenhouse</b> <b>climate</b> management during the cultivation of a lettuce crop. The sensitivity analysis produced valuable insight into the performance sensitivity and operation of the controlled process. Both the model description of crop growth and production as well as the outside climate conditions have a strong impact on the performance. Humidity control plays a dominant role in economic optimal <b>greenhouse</b> <b>climate</b> management, emphasising the need for an accurate description of humidity effects on crop growth and production, either in terms of quantitative models or time-varying constraints on the humidity level in the greenhouse.

40|$|An {{overview}} of the recent scientific and technical advances on issues concerning the greenhouse microclimate, control and management in Mediterranean regions is presented and discussed. Special emphasis is given {{on the effects of}} climate control equipment in: (a) greenhouse microclimate and (b) crop response. The main <b>greenhouse</b> <b>climate</b> control systems presented and discussed are the heating, dehumidification, ventilation, shading and cooling systems. These systems are the most widely used for <b>greenhouse</b> <b>climate</b> control especially in the Mediterranean area. In these areas, natural ventilation and whitewashing are the most common methods/systems used for <b>greenhouse</b> <b>climate</b> control during summer, since they require less energy, less equipment operation and maintenance and are much cheaper to install than other cooling systems. However, generally these systems are not sufficient for extracting the excess energy during sunny summer days and therefore, other cooling methods such as forced ventilation combined with evaporative cooling (mist or fog system, sprinklers, wet pads), are used. On the other hand, during the winter period, heating and dehumidification are necessary for a standard quality production. Optimal <b>greenhouse</b> <b>climate</b> control became more important {{in the latter part of}} the 20 th century, when concerns about food safety, environmental pollution stimulated extensive research in the development of Integrated Production and Protection systems aiming at a significant reduction of pesticides use.

Here we present a compilation of ~ 120, 000 detrital zircon uranium-lead (U-Pb) ages from global sedimentary deposits as a proxy to track the spatial distribution of continental magmatic arc systems from the Cryogenian period to the present.

40|$|The Late Cretaceous is {{considered}} {{to have been a}} time of <b>greenhouse</b> <b>climates,</b> although evidence from Maastrichtian sediments for rapid and significant sea-level changes suggests that ice sheets were growing and decaying on Antarctica at that time. There is no direct geological evidence for glaciation, but we present palynomorph records from Seymour Island, Antarctica, that may suggest Maastrichtian sea ice. The dinoflagellate cyst Impletosphaeridium clavus is dominant. We propose that its profusion may signify the accumulation of resting cysts from dinoflagellate blooms related to winter sea ice decay. Prior to the Cretaceous-Paleogene transition, I. clavus decreased dramatically in abundance; we link this with climate warming. Terrestrial conditions inferred from pollen and spore data are consistent with our climate interpretations based on I. clavus together with δ 18 O values from macrofossils. These data and our interpretation support the presence of ephemeral ice sheets on Antarctica during the latest Cretaceous, highlighting the extreme sensitivity of this region to global climate change. ...|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{changes in}} global and local climate and weather, {{noticeable}} over our lifetimes, have spurred heated public and political {{debate over the}} cause of these climatic changes, {{whether or not we}} can reverse, stop or slow down this process, and how to create adequate models that can predict Earth’s changing climate. To create the most accurate models of future climate, many researchers look to past greenhouse intervals for insight; intervals of time identified by high modeled atmospheric CO 2, a lack of glacial deposits, and geologic evidence of globally high sea-levels—all of which suggest little to no glacial ice and a relatively monotonous climate. However, recent stratigraphic and geochemical evidence from the Cretaceous ‘supergreenhouse’ interval document compelling evidence to support dynamic <b>greenhouse</b> <b>climates.</b> The goals of the studies hereafter described are to document and describe orbital-scale (104 - 105 yr) climate fluctuations recorded by δ 18 O as a proxy for glacio-eustasy and sea surface temperature and εNd as a proxy for continental weathering and wet/warm or dry/cool climate during two global greenhouse intervals: the Late Silurian and Late Devonian. The first study (Chapter 1) explores whether glacio-eustasy was the driver for orbital-scale shallowing-upward cycles developed in Late Silurian and early Late Devonian tropical and subtropical <b>greenhouse</b> <b>climates.</b> Two intra-cycle δ 18 O conodont apatite trends were observed: asymmetric trends demonstrating progressive δ 18 O increases coincident with facies shallowing, or symmetric trends demonstrating initially decreasing, then increasing δ 18 O values. These isotopic trends and intra-cycle magnitudes support the hypothesis that these cycles developed in response to glacio-eustasy during glacial stages, implying that Late Silurian and Late Devonian <b>greenhouse</b> <b>climates</b> were more dynamic than traditionally assumed. Relationships between orbital-scale continental weathering flux and glacial-interglacial marine cycles was first assessed comparing intra-cycle εNd and δ 18 O values from Middle Pennsylvanian icehouse cycles (Chapter 2). Observed conodont δ 18 O trends support previous interpretations that sampled cycles were generated by glacio-eustasy (30 - 50 m magnitudes) combined with < 1 ° sea surface temperature changes. εNd trends typically demonstrate lower εNd values during interglacial intervals and higher εNd during glacial intervals, supporting claims that increases in precipitation and/or air temperatures during interglacial intervals result in increased continental weathering rates and/or increased flux to marine basins. Using this initial continental weathering flux study and Pleistocene Nd-isotope studies as a model, we tested the phase-relationships of continental weathering flux and sea-level change in Upper Silurian and Upper Devonian greenhouse cycles (Chapter 3). Upper Silurian εNd demonstrates relatively uniform intra-cycle values, due to averaging out of far-field source variations in continental weathering flux, relatively uniform Late Silurian sub-tropical climate, and/or subdued continental weathering and flux due to the absence of upland and inland vascular land plants. Upper Devonian εNd demonstrate greater intra-cycle variation in εNd, which may be due to enhanced chemical weathering as a result of upland and inland colonization of land plants with large root systems and an intensified hydrologic cycle due to evapotranspiration. Observed εNd trends support the hypothesis that these greenhouse cycles record increases and decreases in continental weathering due to increases and decreases in precipitation and/or air temperature. εNd and 147 Sm/ 144 Nd values for Upper Silurian and Upper Devonian cycles support previous claims of far-field transport of Caledonian Mountain Belt material via trans-Laurentian fluvial systems.
