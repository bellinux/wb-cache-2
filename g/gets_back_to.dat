Stanlistening to the action from her houseleaves the place by car, following which she and her boyfriend are presented sitting {{at opposite ends of}} a bed. The singer is eventually left by the male alone in the room, with him being shown entering a supermarket while Stan lays on the ground near a piano. Later, he <b>gets</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> her house again, but Stan closes the door in his face. Subsequently, she is portrayed traveling with a red car previously shown in the beginning, arriving at an old vehicle and holding a bird on her arm. Over the rest of the music video, the singer is shown meeting her love interest face to face two more times, including a performance of the song to a bar's crowd in which he is featured, sporting a white dress and head accessory. Her suitor ends struggling with alcohol issues. Scenes interspersed through the main video present the singer laying over the abandoned vehicle, and playing the piano in her room.|$|E
25|$|Cave arrows, Line arrows or Dorff markers (after Lewis Holtzendorff) are plastic {{arrowhead}} markers {{which are}} hooked onto a cave line by wrapping the line around the arrow through the slots. They {{are used to}} indicate the direction to the exit, and can be identified by feel. The message is simple, but of critical importance, as if a diver does not know {{which way to go}} at a line junction there is a risk of serious trouble. Line arrows are also used at a junction on the permanent line, and at a tie-off, so when the diver <b>gets</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the tie-off, he or she can identify which way to turn.|$|E

There is then an account of Jerene's childhood up to her coming out to her parents and being spurned by them. Philip and Eliot then talk about their experiences with men. Philip goes on to remember {{the way he would}} masturbate a lot and how he tried to ask girls out - and they refused. Finally, he recalls going to a gay pornographic cinema when he was seventeen.|$|E

25|$|Upset, Brecken tasks Crane {{with the}} job of making a deal with Rais. Upon meeting Rais, Crane is able to confirm that he is indeed Suleiman. He carries {{out a series of}} {{unethical}} tasks for Rais under the assumption that he will be rewarded with two crates of Antizin. Crane is unable to locate the file, and is later betrayed by Rais, who only gives him five vials of Antizin. He later breaks off business with the GRE when they halt the supply drops and refuse to help the Tower. The situation in the tower worsens, and a whole floor is sealed off when an outbreak occurs. In desperate hopes to find Antizin, Crane and Jade pull a raid on a supply storage facility run by Rais, which was formerly a school. They find no Antizin, but rather plastic explosives, which they choose to confiscate to prevent Rais from using them in the future. While doing an errand, Rahim tells Crane that he and Omar (Emmerson Brooks) were planning to bomb an infected nest with the explosives found at the school. Crane is opposed to this plan. After discovering that Rahim went outside the Tower to plant the explosives, he chases after him. Upon catching up to him, he finds that Omar is dead, while Rahim has been wounded. He then executes Rahim's plans, resulting in the killing of the infected in the compound. When he <b>gets</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Rahim he discovers that he was actually bitten and had turned while Crane was gone, forcing Crane to snap Rahim's neck when he attacks Crane. Crane returns to the tower to inform Brecken of the news; Jade overhears them and, visibly upset, takes off.|$|E

Quagmire and Brian are the final two contestants on The Bachelorette. Brooke's visits to the Griffin house is catastrophic, but not nearly as bad as the dinner she had with Quagmire and his mom. Brian wins her heart and the final rose, but when the cameras are turned off, Brooke tells Brian that it was nice [...] "working with him", and it is {{apparent}} that the show really is scripted, as Brian thought. Brian quickly becomes obsessed with Brooke and leaves several messages on her answering machine, even though she never <b>gets</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> him. Brooke gets angry at Brian for stalking her and throws her telephone at him when he attempts to serenade her outside her apartment.

Hours later he makes it back to the Jeep, but his leg is injured. Wes decides to climb a tall hill on the other side of the clearing to see if he can get a signal on his cell phone.

Rose breaks down in tears and tells the Doctor that she loves him, and he responds, [...] "Quite right, too, and, I suppose, if {{this is my last}} chance to say it: Rose Tyler—"; before the Doctor can finish his reply, the breach seals and the Doctor's image disappears.

500|$|A {{technical}} device much used by Mahler {{is that of}} [...] "progressive tonality," [...] which Deryck Cooke {{describes as}} [...] "the procedure of resolving a symphonic conflict in a different key from that {{in which it was}} stated," [...] and which is often used [...] "to symbolise the gradual ascendancy of a certain value by progress from one key to another over the whole course of a symphony." [...] This technique was also used by Mahler's Danish contemporary Carl Nielsen. Mahler first employed the device in an early song, Erinnerung ("Memory"), and thereafter used it freely in his symphonies. For example, the predominant key of the First Symphony is D major; {{at the beginning of the}} Finale, the [...] "conflict" [...] movement, the key switches to F minor, and only after a lengthy battle <b>gets</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> D, near the end. The Second Symphony begins in C minor and ends in E flat. The movements of the Fifth Symphony progress successively from C-sharp minor to A minor, then D major, F major and finally to D major. The Sixth Symphony, unusually for Mahler, begins and ends in the same key, A minor, signifying that in this case the conflict is unresolved.|$|E
500|$|Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter said, [...] "If this is torture porn, it's {{as if it}} was {{designed}} to be enjoyed by Michael Moore." [...] He closed his review saying, [...] "As usual, what gives the film whatever interest it has -- beyond satisfying the rapacious appetites of gore aficionados -- is the moral element attached to the various Rube Goldberg-style set pieces. Here, it's exemplified by a well-staged sequence in which a man must choose who lives or dies during a particularly lethal variation of musical chairs." [...] Roger Moore of Orlando Sentinel gave the film two out of five stars. He said the script [...] "has a more lyrical bent, and a more satiric bite, {{than any of the other}} Saw sequels" [...] and called the acting [...] "perfunctory on most fronts". [...] Robert Abele of the Los Angeles Times gave the film a negative review, writing [...] "But, really, do reformers and victims of callous health insurers really want a guy with a penchant for elaborately constructed death panels of his own to be their advocate? Elsewhere, the usual critiques apply: terrible acting, zero suspense, laughable logic and the promise of another one next year. How can we get this policy canceled?" [...] Chris Hewitt of the St. Paul Pioneer Press gave the film a negative review. He was displeased that the film offered nothing new saying, [...] "The first three Saw movies had some intriguing ideas and an unusual way of presenting them, but the three most recent films have barely bothered to come up with anything fresh." [...] Kim Newman of Empire gave the film three out of five, stating [...] "Saw VI <b>gets</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Saw basics in gripping, gruesome manner." ...|$|E
