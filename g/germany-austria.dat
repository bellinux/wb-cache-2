50|$|After 1936, Hitler and Mussolini {{forged a}} closer {{relationship}} {{in preparation for}} Germany's expansionist ambitions. Hitler used the Nazi Party of Austria to influence public opinions and staged a coup against the Austrian Fascist government in 1938. When Hitler decided to refrain from reclaiming South Tyrol, Mussolini abandoned his pledge to protect Austria's independence. Subsequently, the Anschluss of the Third German Reich and <b>Germany-Austria</b> occurred in 1938, reuniting both countries since the 1870s. Austria became Ostmark (Eastern Region) under Hitler's regime.|$|E
50|$|The club's {{success was}} {{interrupted}} by the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany in 1938, with Austria taunted as Judenklub. While Jewish players and staff at the club were killed or fled the country, Sindelar died under unresolved circumstances on 23 January 1939 of carbon monoxide poisoning in his apartment. He had refused {{to play for the}} combined <b>Germany-Austria</b> national team, citing injury (bad knees) and retirement from international games. The club was part of the top-flight regional Gauliga Ostmark in German competition from 1938-45, but never finished higher than fourth. They took part in play for the Tschammerpokal, predecessor to the modern-day DFB-Pokal (German Cup) in 1938 and 1941. Nazi sports authorities directed that the team change its name to Sportclub Ostmark Wien in an attempt to Germanize it on 12 April 1938, but the club re-adopted its historical identity almost immediately on 14 July 1938.|$|E

The evaluation {{is based on}} a widely utilized computable general equilibrium model called GTAP (Global Trade Analysis Project). Imperfect competition is modelled via assumption of scale economies on non agricultural sectors. The latest GTAP database version (base year 2001) is aggregated into seven regions: Turkey, <b>Germany-Austria,</b> North EU, South EU, Balkan countries, NAFTA, ASIA and Rest of World. We analyse economic effects of abolishing trade barriers between the EU 25 and Turkey and applying common external tax on Turkey. Major sectoral effects are bound to originate from the agriculture which accounts 11. 4 % of TurkeyÕs GDP. GTAP, Turkey, EU enlargement...|$|E
40|$|The recent paper “The Kalash Genetic Isolate: Ancient Divergence, Drift, and Selection”, by Ayub et al 1 (AJHG 2015, 96 : 1 - 9) {{suggests}} that the Kalash people of present-day Pakistan experienced “no detectable gene flow from their geographic neighbors in Pakistan or from other extant Eurasian populations” since their split from those populations over 8000 years ago. They note that this finding of apparent genetic isolation contradicts the results of Hellenthal et al 2, who inferred DNA introgression dated to 910 - 220 BCE in an overlapping sample of Kalash individuals. Hellenthal et al 2 inferred the (unknown) source of this DNA to have genetic similarities {{to a wide range}} of modern-day groups from West Asia and Europe, including <b>Germany-Austria</b> and Turkey, for example...|$|E
30|$|To {{construct}} regional networks, we associated {{each country}} with its UN region. This resulted in 22 region nodes such as: Australia and New Zealand, Caribbean, Central America, Central Asia, Eastern Africa, Eastern Asia, Eastern Europe, Melanesia, Micronesia, Middle Africa, Northern Africa, Northern America, Northern Europe, Polynesia, South America, South-Eastern Asia, Southern Africa, Southern Asia, Southern Europe, Western Africa, Western Asia, and Western Europe. For each region, we calculated both the bandwidth remaining {{within the region}} (for example, a <b>Germany-Austria</b> edge would result in bandwidth being assigned as internal to the Western Europe region) and the bandwidth going outside the region (the Germany-Sweden edge would connect the Western Europe and Northern Europe regions). In 2002, the regional network had 22 nodes and was interconnected by 91 edges. In 2011, there were the same 22 nodes and now 110 edges. Network density increased slightly from. 36 (2002) to. 43 (2011). The Western Europe region had the highest eigenvector centrality score, weighted by bandwidth, in both 2002 and 2011. Not surprisingly, regions are much more tightly connected than were individual countries.|$|E
40|$|Dairy cattle {{breeding}} {{is an international}} business, with trade of animal material across populations. Interbull performs international genetic evaluations of dairy bulls, enabling fair comparisons across populations. The bull daughter performances differ between populations and international evaluations therefore require estimation of genetic correlations between the populations. Prerequisites for estimating correlations are knowledge about the genetic variances and covariances within and between populations {{and the relationship between}} the bulls. Traditionally, pedigree information has been used to build the relationship matrix connecting included bulls. The recent developments in DNA technology have made it possible to also build genomic relationship matrices using information from the bull genomes. The purpose of this thesis was to evaluate variances and covariances estimated using pedigree or genomic relationship matrices and the effect of factors such as trait heritability, population size, and number of bulls used in more than one population. Moreover, we evaluate the genetic correlations estimated using our different estimates. Genetic variance estimates were compared for a total of 175 population-trait combinations, and genetic covariance and correlation estimates were assessed for four populations and three traits. Phenotypes, genotypes and pedigree were available for 8 864 Brown Swiss bulls originating from <b>Germany-Austria,</b> France, Italy, Slovenia, Switzerland and the United States of America. The results showed that more genetic variance and covariance was explained when the pedigree relationship matrix was used than using the genomic relationship matrix. We found an effect of trait heritability and population size on the genetic variance estimates and an effect of number of common bulls on the genetic covariance estimates. The estimated genetic correlations were similar for both relationship matrices used in the estimation of variances and covariances, indicating that {{it should be possible to}} obtain accurate across-population correlation estimates using genomic relationship matrices...|$|E
40|$|Traits {{with low}} {{heritability}} estimates {{such as health}} and fertility are often assumed to have low genetic variance. However, the heritability is a ratio of additive genetic variance over all variance, and thus, the genetic variation of these traits may only be proportionally small. Health in dairy cattle is important, not only {{in its own right}} but also for human health and animal welfare. The coefficient of variation (CV) can be used to express genetic variance without units, allowing for comparison between traits regardless of their measurement units, in the same way heritability can be used. The CV is the standard deviation of the trait divided by the mean. In addition, the use of within-family variances may allow for more accurate investigation of genetic variance, because when within-family variances are large, between family variance (which is the basis for heritability estimation) is low. However, for international genetic and genomic evaluations, phenotypic measurements are not always available. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the usefulness of using CV for observations based on estimated or relative breeding values (EBV/RBV), and to investigate whether the low heritability seen for health traits, is related to low genetic variance, as defined by CV. Data for Brown Swiss cattle from 6 countries available from the Interbull evaluation of April 2014 were used and CV was calculated for within sire family variances and for the population as a whole based on international estimated breeding values (IEBV) using SAS 9. 3. The breeding values were standardised differently for different countries, and were separated accordingly. However, there are reasons to believe that the interpretation of the results may be complicated because of this, and thus the validity of the CV for this evaluation may not be justified. If this is ignored for the time being, the following results were found. For all traits, population CVs were larger than sire-family CVs. Traits had either means for breeding values of 100 or 0 depending on the country, but there was no correlation between these two types of means for individual traits. Differences were found between countries for overall mean CV. Differences between different categories of traits (e. g. calving, fertility, production) were found, with production and fertility traits having the lowest overall CV across countries. Within countries, ranking of trait categories were somewhat different, but generally workability and udder health traits had high CVs. No significant correlations were found between the CV of traits and their heritability estimates, except when separating traits by country. This was only significant for <b>Germany-Austria.</b> Overall, the CV is useful for comparing the variance of traits with different measurement units. However, because of the nature of the breeding values in this study, it may not be appropriate to use the CV. Therefore, it is concluded that CV, although useful in itself, is not a good approach when evaluating relative breeding values across countries...|$|E
