40|$|Airtightness {{of timber}} frame {{buildings}} {{not having a}} plastic film vapour barrier Good airtightness of a building {{can be achieved by}} the incorporation of an <b>inner</b> <b>sealing</b> layer for the exterior walls and roofs {{in the form of a}} plastic film, which also serves as a vapour barrier. However, if it is not wished to use plastic film as an <b>inner</b> <b>sealing</b> layer, then airtightness must be effected through the use of other materials or in some other way. This project has been concerned with investigation of a number of alternatives. It has been found that the arrangement most commonly used in Sweden today comprises polymer-based fibre sheets (which permit diffusion) and gypsum board, as alternatives to plastic film on the inside of the structure. The work of the project has shown that, provided that the materials are airtight in their own right, it is possible to achieve as good airtightness with alternative materials as can be achieved with plastic film. This has been demonstrated in the laboratory and in three of five houses in the field investigation. However, the airtightness performance of the finished building can be very poor unless care is taken both in the design and in construction, and this was also revealed in the field work...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{experimental results}} from a research facility which experimentally models hot gas ingress into the wheel-space of an axial turbine stage. Measurements of CO 2 gas concentration in the rim-seal region and inside the wheel-space are {{used to assess the}} performance of generic (though engine-representative) single and double seals in terms of the variation of concentration effectiveness with sealing flow rate. The variation of pressure in the turbine annulus, which governs externally-induced ingress, was obtained from steady pressure measurements downstream of the vanes. The benefit of using double seals is demonstrated: The ingested gas is shown to be predominately confined to the outer wheel-space radially outward of the inner seal; in the inner wheel-space, radially inward of the <b>inner</b> <b>seal,</b> the effectiveness is shown to be significantly higher. Criteria for ranking the performance of single and double seals are proposed, and the performance limit for any double seal is shown to be one in which the <b>inner</b> <b>seal</b> is exposed to rotationally-induced ingress. Although the ingress is a consequence of an unsteady, three-dimensional flow field and the cause-effect relationship between pressure and the sealing effectiveness is complex, the experimental data is shown to be successfully calculated by simple effectiveness equations developed from a theoretical model. The data illustrate that, for similar turbine-stage velocity triangles, the effectiveness can be correlated using two empirical parameters. In principle, these correlations could be extrapolated to a geometrically-similar turbine operating at enginerepresentative conditions...|$|E

Pressure-sensitive <b>inner</b> <b>seals</b> adhere to plastic or glass bottles with normal application torque.

40|$|A {{substantial}} part of nuclear containments in US and Europe are designed with an outer bearing concrete structure and an <b>inner</b> <b>sealing</b> consisting of a tight-welded steel liner. The liner constitutes the ultimate leak-barrier, which prevents leakage at high internal pressure loads. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to show which influence a through-wall concrete crack may have on the strain level in the liner. A non-linear bar model is used to evaluate the liner behavior. It is shown that the effect from friction between the concrete and liner could be significant and cause high concentration of plastic strain. The influence of friction on the liner is verified by an experimental program presented in this paper. One of the conclusions is that concentrations of strain due to friction increase with decreasing liner thickness. This is important to consider when results from scale tests are interpreted. Scale models, which have thinner liners, could get significantly higher liner strain than the actual full-scale containment. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation into}} pre-swirl effectiveness and receiver hole discharge coefficient characteristics {{for a high}} radius injection pre-swirl cooling systems was carried out on a physically representative experimental rig with a 450 mm diameter rotor. The receiver holes and pre-swirl nozzle were located at a radius of 181 mm and 180 mm respectively. The experimental work was mainly conducted at 5000 - 12000 rpm, 4 bar absolute pressure and 1. 132 kg/s air supply. The maximum air supply temperature was 190 C.

40|$|Lecturepg. 59 In this paper, an {{innovative}} approach of applying gas-lubricated, noncontacting sealing technology to process pumps is presented, {{in which a}} novel ?twin hybrid? design is incorporated to address the issues of gas seal applications to process pumps. In this design, orifice-injected inert barrier gas between concentric twin seal faces gives rise to hydrostatic action, so that the <b>inner</b> <b>seal</b> face with hydrodynamic lift features upon running can initiate and maintain stable face separation, even at extremely slow speed. The outer plain face seal, by way of higher barrier gas pressure, prevents any process fluid on the outer diameter cavity from leaking or emitting through sealing faces. The twin face design compacting two seals to one seal ring not only reduces greatly the cartridge size so as to fit all pumps without stuffing box modifications, but maintains its dual seal functionality with the single seal simplicity. The hybrid feature combining hydrostatic action for start/stop and slow speed operations, and hydrodynamic action for initiating and maintaining stable face separation not only enhances the sealing performance, but also expands its application ranges. Detailed design features and operating principles including reducing O-ring hysteresis and pressure reversal or loss-of-barrier gas are discussed. Extensive laboratory and field test were conducted to validate the designs. A field test is described to exemplify its applications in process pumps including its performance in abnormal operating conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{non-destructive}} {{evaluation of the}} water permeability of concrete structures is a long standing challenge, principally due {{to the difficulty of}} achieving a uni-direction flow for computing the water permeability coefficient. The use of a guard ring (GR) was originally proposed for the in situ sorptivity test, but little information can be found for the water permeability test. In this study, the effect of a GR was carefully examined through the flow simulation, which was verified by carrying out experiments. It was observed that the GR can confine the flow near the surface, but cannot achieve a uni-directional flow across the whole depth of flow. To achieve a better performance, it is essential to consider the effects {{of the size of the}} <b>inner</b> <b>seal</b> and the GR and the significant interaction between these two. The analysis of the experimental data has indicated that the GR influences the flow for porous concretes, but there is no significant effect for dense concretes. Further investigation, validated using the flow-net theory, has shown a strong correlation between the water permeability coefficients obtained with the GR (K w-GR) and without it (K w-No GR), suggesting that one dimensional flow is not essential for interpreting data for site tests. Another practical issue was that more than 30 % of the tests with GR failed due to the difficulty of achieving a good seal between the inner and the outer chambers. Based on the work reported in this paper, a new water permeability test is proposed...|$|E

The earliest chin strap caps were known as [...] "aviator's style caps" [...] as they resembled the strapped leather helmets of flyers of the day. During the 1940s swim caps became scarce as rubber was needed for war materials. It was a lucky girl who had a swim cap to protect her [...] "wave" [...] (hair style) during that period. The permanent wave hairstyle took time to obtain and was expensive, so many women wanted to protect their hair while swimming. The 1950s saw decorated caps come into vogue, and during the 1960s colorful flower petal swim caps became popular. Men's long hair styles of the late 1960s and early 1970s made swimming pool operators change rules requiring swim caps for swimmers with long hair. Without swim cap requirements wearing swim caps fell out of fashion during the early 1970s.
