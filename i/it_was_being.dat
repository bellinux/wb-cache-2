In 1993, Brodarski Institut (BI) of Zagreb started a modification program to improve the operational capabilities of the submarine captured two years earlier. The hull was lengthend to create space needed for the installation of a single MTU 105kW diesel generator, a feature the original Una-class design lacked. A new steering system developed by BI was also installed.|$|E

5|$|During {{the next}} few weeks, the Navy set up twenty-one large winches on the island to turn the Oklahoma upright {{so it could be}} re-floated and patched before being scrapped.

5|$|In 1952, {{astronomer}} Paul W. Merrill in California {{detected the}} spectral signature of technetium (specifically wavelengths of 403.1nm, 423.8nm, 426.2nm, and 429.7nm) in light from S-type red giants. The stars were {{near the end}} of their lives, yet were rich in this short-lived element, indicating that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>being</b> produced in the stars by nuclear reactions. This evidence bolstered the hypothesis that heavier elements are the product of nucleosynthesis in stars. More recently, such observations provided evidence that elements are formed by neutron capture in the s-process.|$|E
