5|$|<b>Fur-bearing</b> trout are fictional {{creatures that}} are purportedly found in Arkansas, {{northern}} North America, and Iceland. The basic claim (or tall tale) {{is that the}} waters of lakes and rivers {{in the area are}} so cold that they evolved a thick coat of fur to maintain their body heat. Another theory says that it is due to four jugs - or two bottles - of hair tonic being spilled into the Arkansas River.|$|E
5|$|Golden jackals are {{extremely}} harmful to <b>fur-bearing</b> rodents, such as coypu and muskrats. Coypu can be completely extirpated {{in shallow water}} bodies. During 1948–1949 in the Amu Darya, muskrats constituted 12.3% of jackal faecal contents, and 71% of muskrat houses were destroyed by jackals. Jackals also harm the fur industry by eating muskrats caught in traps or taking skins left out to dry.|$|E
5|$|Lumber {{became one}} of the leading {{industries}} in Pennsylvania. Trees were used to furnish fuel to heat homes, tannin for the many tanneries that were spread throughout the state, and wood for construction, furniture, and barrel making. Large areas of forest were harvested by colliers to fire iron furnaces. Rifle stocks and shingles were made from Pennsylvania timber, as were a wide variety of household utensils, and the first Conestoga wagons. The PhiladelphiaErie Pike (present day Pennsylvania Route 504) opened the Black Moshannon area to settlers by 1821. The first settlers opened the Antes Tavern along the Pike, trapped <b>fur-bearing</b> animals, and cleared land for farming.|$|E
5|$|Opposition to {{the project}} was based on three {{separate}} objections to its construction: ecological, human, and financial. Conservation groups opposed the dam's construction because it would flood the Yukon Flats, a large wetland area that provides breeding ground for millions of waterfowl and habitat for game and <b>fur-bearing</b> animals. Alaska Native groups objected {{to the project}}'s human cost—the need to relocate more than 1,500 people and 9 villages—and Native groups outside the reservoir area objected to the potential devastation of the Yukon River salmon population. The third objection to construction of the dam stemmed from its high cost {{and the belief that}} cheap electricity would not be enough to attract industry to Alaska.|$|E
5|$|The HBC {{drastically}} reduced the price paid for furs, by 50% in many cases. By this time, however, the fur trade was in decline, {{both on the}} coast and the continent, due to a general depletion of <b>fur-bearing</b> animals, along with {{a reduction in the}} demand for beaver pelts. A financial panic in 1837 resulted in a general slump in the fur and China trade, bringing an end to a half-century boom. During the 1840s, the HBC closed most of their coastal trading posts, leaving the coast trade to just Fort Simpson and the Beaver, with the new depot at Fort Victoria anchoring the southern coast.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of Catherine's ukase of 1788, just as other nations were {{entering}} the maritime fur trade, the Russians had spent over 40 years establishing and expanding their maritime operations in North America. A number of colonies were being established over a large region stretching from the Aleutian Islands to Cook Inlet and Prince William Sound. Many ships sailed from Kamchatka to Alaska each year. The Russians not only had an early start, but they also controlled the habitats {{of the most valuable}} sea otters. The Kurilian, Kamchatkan, and Aleutian sea otters' fur was thicker, glossier, and blacker than those on the Northwest Coast and California. The four grades of fur were based on color, texture, and thickness. The most prized furs were those of Kurilian and Kamchatkan sea otters, Aleutian furs were second grade, those of the Northwest Coast third, and the poorest grade was those of Californian sea otters. Russia also controlled the sources of sable furs, the most valuable <b>fur-bearing</b> land mammal.|$|E
25|$|With the {{eventual}} depletion of <b>fur-bearing</b> animals, the fur trade and associated settlement diminished.|$|E
25|$|Furbearers or <b>fur-bearing</b> animals (melqulek sg melqulget pl in Yup'ik and Cup'ik, melquleg in Cup'ig) are {{commonly}} trapped for their pelts. Taking advantage of Alaska's rich supply of <b>fur-bearing</b> animals, the Yup'ik {{use a variety}} of materials for their parkas. Beaver, river otter, red fox, Arctic fox, marten, lynx, mink, ground squirrel, marmots, and muskrat are trapped in specific regions during the fall and winter.|$|E
25|$|The field surveys also {{provided}} source material for Game Birds of California (1918) and <b>Fur-bearing</b> Mammals of California (1937).|$|E
25|$|In some animals, the {{presence}} of fur or feathers blocks the UV rays from reaching the skin. In birds and <b>fur-bearing</b> mammals, vitamin D is generated from the oily secretions of the skin deposited onto the feathers or fur and is obtained orally during grooming.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} large game {{animal in the}} Little Nescopeck Creek {{watershed}} is the white-tailed deer. Cottontail rabbits are also common in the watershed, especially in the areas devoted to farming. Beavers, raccoons, and muskrats {{are the most common}} <b>fur-bearing</b> animals in the watershed.|$|E
25|$|Furbearers or <b>fur-bearing</b> animals (melqulek sg melqulget pl in Yup'ik and Cup'ik, melquleg in Cup'ig) are {{commonly}} trapped for their pelts and meats. The meat {{of all types}} of furbearers (beaver, mink, otter, muskrat, marten, lynx), except for fox, wolf, and wolverine, was used for human food and was also used as dog food.|$|E
25|$|The Beothuk {{are also}} {{known to have}} made a pudding out of tree sap and the dried yolk of the eggs of the great auk. They {{preserved}} surplus food for use during winter, trapped various <b>fur-bearing</b> animals, and worked their skins for warm clothing. The fur side was worn next to the skin, to trap air against a person's body.|$|E
25|$|British {{explorer}} David Thompson {{also conducted}} overland exploration. In 1811, {{while working for}} the North West Company, Thompson became the first European to navigate the entire Columbia River. Stopping on the way, at the junction of the Snake River, he posted a claim to the region for Great Britain and the North West Company. Upon returning to Montreal, he publicized the abundance of <b>fur-bearing</b> animals in the area.|$|E
25|$|French fishing fleets {{continued}} to sail to the Atlantic coast {{and into the}} St. Lawrence River, making alliances with First Nations that became important once France began to occupy the land. French merchants soon realized the St. Lawrence region was full of valuable <b>fur-bearing</b> animals, especially the beaver, which were becoming rare in Europe. Eventually, the French crown decided to colonize the territory to secure and expand its influence in America.|$|E
25|$|Alberton {{became the}} centre of the {{worldwide}} silver fox industry when Charles Dalton and Robert Oulton began farming the <b>fur-bearing</b> animals on an island in the harbour at Northport in 1894, bringing tremendous prosperity to area residents and business owners. Despite a fire that devastated part of the town the following year, Alberton quickly reflected its growing economic importance of the village. The railway constructed a new passenger station designed by architect Charles Benjamin Chappell for Alberton in the early 1900s entirely out of stone, one of only two such stations on the island (the other being in Kensington).|$|E
25|$|The 1659–1660 {{voyage of}} French traders Pierre-Esprit Radisson and Médard Chouart des Groseilliers {{into the country}} north and west of Lake Superior symbolically opened this new era of expansion. Their trading voyage proved {{extremely}} lucrative in furs. More importantly, they learned of a frozen sea to the north that provided {{easy access to the}} <b>fur-bearing</b> interior. Upon their return, French officials confiscated the furs of these unlicensed coureurs des bois. Radisson and Groseilliers went to Boston and then to London to secure funding and two ships to explore the Hudson Bay. Their success led to England's chartering of the Hudson's Bay Company in 1670, {{a major player in the}} fur trade for the next two centuries.|$|E
25|$|During {{the last}} quarter of the 18th century, the first Spanish {{settlements}} were established in what later became the Las Californias Province of the Viceroyalty of New Spain. Reacting to interest by the Russian Empire and, later, Great Britain in the <b>fur-bearing</b> animals of the Pacific north coast, Spain further extended the series of Catholic missions, accompanied by troops and establishing ranches, along the southern and central coast of California. These missions were intended to demonstrate the claim of the Spanish Empire to what is now California. By 1823, 21 Spanish missions had been established in Alta California. Operations were based out of the naval base at San Blas and included not only the establishment and supply of missions in California, but a series of exploration expeditions to the Pacific Northwest and Alaska.|$|E
25|$|Wildlife {{conservation}} in Canada was {{sparked by the}} protection of animals for tourism and recreation. Howard Douglas, an appointed superintendent of Rocky Mountains Park in 1897 first began to expand and preserve wildlife to attract more visitors to the park. However, between 1900 and 1920 Canada saw {{a dramatic change in}} national attitudes from focus in tourism {{to the creation of the}} National Parks Branch, world's first governmental organization dedicated to parks, and the development of other governmental organizations like the Commission of Conservation. Canadian Commission of Conservation that established in 1909 was intended to be an independent body dealing with questions of natural resource {{conservation in}} Canada. In the early years of the Commission, wildlife investigations were mostly focused on resource-commodity species such as fish and <b>fur-bearing</b> animals and later developed to include greater variety of species.|$|E
25|$|While {{bringing}} {{wealth to}} a few select French traders and the French regime, the fur trade also brought profound changes to the indigenous groups living along the St. Lawrence. European wares, such as iron axe heads, brass kettles, cloth, and firearms were bought with beaver pelts and other furs. The widespread practice of trading furs for rum and whiskey led to problems associated with inebriation and alcohol abuse. The subsequent destruction of beaver populations along the St. Lawrence heightened the fierce competition between the Iroquois and Huron {{for access to the}} rich <b>fur-bearing</b> lands of the Canadian Shield. The competition for hunting is believed to have contributed to the earlier destruction of the St. Lawrence Iroquoians in the valley by 1600, likely by the Iroquois Mohawk tribe, who were located closest to them, were more powerful than the Huron, and had the most to gain by controlling this part of the valley.|$|E
25|$|The taboos (Tanacross injih, Upper Tanana įhjih) are animistic forbidden. In {{addition}} to adhering to {{a code of}} behavior, people observed a variety of taboos designed to prevent misfortune or bad luck. Many of these taboos were associated with hunting or some other aspect of the food gathering process, thus underscoring {{the importance of these}} activities for survival of the group. Ravens, cranes, wolverines, foxes, otters, and dogs must never be eaten. The heads of caribou, moose, and Dall sheep may not be fed to the dogs; to do so would bring the hunter poor luck. Neither the bones nor the carcasses of <b>fur-bearing</b> animals may be fed to dogs, but must be cached in a safe place. Should the dogs get them tha hunter will take no more fur. Women of child-bearing age did not eat bear (Grizzly or Alaskan brown bear and black bear). Young boys could not eat fat from around an animal's eye until adulthood. No animals except dogs could be brought up as pets.|$|E
25|$|The Oregon Question {{originated}} in the 18th century during the early European or American exploration of the Pacific Northwest. Various Empires began to consider the area suitable for colonial expansion, including the Americans, Russians, Spanish and British. Naval captains such as the Spanish Juan José Pérez Hernández, British George Vancouver and American Robert Gray gave defining regional water formations like the Columbia River and the Puget Sound their modern names and charted in the 1790s. Overland explorations were commenced by the British Alexander Mackenzie in 1792 and later followed by the American Lewis and Clark expedition, which reached {{the mouth of the}} Columbia River in 1805. These explorers often claimed in the name of their respective governments sovereignty over the Northwest Coast. The knowledge of <b>fur-bearing</b> animal populations like the California sea lion, North American beaver and the Northern fur seal were used to create an economic network called the maritime fur trade. The fur trade would remain the main economic interest that drew Euro-Americans to the Pacific Northwest for decades. Merchants exchanged goods for fur pelts along the coast with indigenous nations such as the Chinookan people, the Aleuts and the Nuu-chah-nulth.|$|E
25|$|Taiga - {{the most}} {{extensive}} natural area of Russia - stretches from the western borders of Russia to the Pacific. It occupies {{the territory of the}} Eastern Europe and West Siberian plains to the north of 56 ° -58 ° N and most of the territory east of Yenisei River taiga forests reach the southern borders of Russia in Siberia taiga only accounts for over 60% of Russia. In the north-south direction the eastern taiga is divided (east of the Yenisei River), with a continental climate, and west, with a milder climate, in general, the climate zone is moist, moderately warm (cool in the north) in the summer and harsh winter, there is a steady snow cover in the winter. In the latitudinal direction the taiga is divided into three subzones - northern, middle and southern taiga. In the western taiga dense spruce and fir forests on wetlands alternate with pine forests, shrubs and meadows on the lighter soils. Such vegetation is typical of the eastern taiga, but it plays an important role not fir and larch. Coniferous forest, however, does not form a continuous array and sparse areas of birch, alder, willow (mainly in river valleys), the wetlands - marshes. Within the taiga are widespread <b>fur-bearing</b> animals - sable, marten, ermine, moose, brown bear, wolverine, wolf, and muskrat.|$|E

500|$|Another <b>fur-bearing</b> trout story {{originated}} with Wilbur Foshay, {{secretary of the}} Chamber of Commerce. Foshay promoted the story so convincingly that it {{was picked up by}} the Salida Record newspaper. According to its Foshay, the trout grew fur due to the cold temperatures of the Arkansas River and shed the fur as the water temperatures warmed in the summer. In November 1938, a story in the Puebloan Cheiftan recounted the hairy trout history and stated that [...] "ld-timers living along the Arkansas River near Salida have told tales for many years of the <b>fur-bearing</b> trout indigenous to the waters of the Arkansas near there." [...] In 2014, Mysteries at the Museum visited the Salida Museum and is expected {{to be part of a}} segment in late 2014.|$|E
500|$|There are no real {{examples}} of any <b>fur-bearing</b> trout species, but two {{examples of}} hair-like growths on fish are known.

500|$|The <b>fur-bearing</b> trout (or furry trout) is {{a fictional}} {{creature}} purportedly found in North America and Iceland. [...] According to tales, the trout {{has created a}} thick coat of fur to maintain its body heat. Tales of furry fish date to the 17th-century and later the [...] "shaggy trout" [...] of [...] Iceland. The earliest known American publication dates from a 1929 Montana Wildlife magazine article by J.H. Hicken. A taxidermy furry trout produced by Ross C.

500|$|The Canadian <b>fur-bearing</b> trout {{is another}} example of the furry trout hoax. According to the story, a trout with white fur was caught in Lake Superior off Gros Cap in Sault Ste.

500|$|A May 1965 {{article in}} The Atlantic {{magazine}} by author Paul Brooks illustrated the growing protests of conservationists {{concerned about the}} project. After traveling the Yukon River, Brooks hypothesized that construction of the dam would be catastrophic from an ecological and human standpoint, would cost an exorbitant amount of money, and that the claims of attracting industry and tourism to Alaska were greatly exaggerated. In real terms, he estimated that construction of the dam would eliminate the habitat for 1.5 million ducks, 12,500 geese, 10,000 cranes, 270,000 salmon, 12,000 moose, and seven percent of Alaska's <b>fur-bearing</b> animals. Similar articles appeared in magazines such as Field and Stream, which called the project [...] "a catastrophe of major proportions", and the Audubon Society Magazine, [...] said the dam [...] "would negate 30 years of endeavor in waterfowl preservation. Even sporting magazine Sports Illustrated got into the act, asking if the cost of so many waterfowl would be worth building the dam.|$|E
500|$|The grey jay readily capitalizes on {{novel food}} sources, {{including}} {{taking advantage of}} man-made sources of food. To the frustration of trappers using baits to catch <b>fur-bearing</b> animals or early travelers trying to protect their winter food supplies, and {{to the delight of}} campers, bold grey jays are known to approach humans for treats and to steal from unattended food stores. Grey jays do not change their feeding behavior if watched by people; if they are able to link humans with food, they will not forget. A nesting female that had become accustomed to being fed by humans was reportedly able to be enticed to leave the nest during incubation and brooding. This behaviour has inspired a number of nicknames for the grey jay, including [...] "lumberjack", [...] "meat-bird", [...] "venison-hawk", [...] "moose-bird", and [...] "gorby", the last two popular in Maine in the northeastern United States. The origin of [...] "gorby", also spelt [...] "gorbey", is unclear but possibly derived from gorb, which in Scots or Irish means [...] "glutton" [...] or [...] "greedy (animal)" [...] or in Scots or northern English [...] "fledgling bird".|$|E
500|$|The character, Conan, and {{the world}} of Hyboria were based on the creations of pulp-fiction writer Robert E. Howard from the 1930s. [...] Published in Weird Tales, his series about the barbarian was popular with the readership; the barbarian's adventures in a savage and mystical world, replete with gore and brutal slayings, {{satisfied}} the reader's fantasies of being a [...] "powerful giant who lives by no rules but his own". [...] From the 1960s, Conan gained a wider audience as novels about him, written in imitation of Howard's style by L. Sprague de Camp and Lin Carter, were published. [...] Frank Frazetta's cover art for these novels cemented Conan's image as a [...] "virile, axe-wielding, <b>fur-bearing,</b> cranium-smashing barbarian". [...] John Milius, the film's director, intended the film's Conan to be [...] "a Northern European mythic hero". Danny Peary described Conan as [...] "muscular, majestic, brainy, yet with ambivalent scruples". [...] Don Herron, a scholar on Howard and his stories, disagreed, noting that the personality of Conan in the film differs greatly from that of the literature. [...] The Conan in the books detests restrictions to his freedom and would have resisted slavery in a violent fashion, whereas the film version accepts his fate and has to be freed. [...] Robert Garcia's review of the film in his American Fantasy magazine states, [...] "this Conan is less powerful, less talkative, and less educated than Howard's".|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1820s, fur trappers of the Hudson's Bay Company {{traveling}} south from Fort Vancouver reached the Klamath River basin. The first party {{to see the}} Klamath River was led by Alexander McLeod {{in the winter of}} 1826–27. In 1828, the Jedediah Smith fur trapping expedition was helped across the Trinity River by the Yurok and camped {{on the east side of}} the Trinity River. His clerk, Harrison G. Rogers, wrote, [...] "Mr. Smith purchases all the beaver furs he can from them," [...] suggesting that beaver were then plentiful on the Trinity. Joseph Grinnell, in <b>Fur-bearing</b> Mammals of California, noted that beaver had been present on other Klamath River tributaries such as the Scott River and Shasta River, and further cited a Fish and Game report of beaver from 1915–1917 on High Prairie Creek at the mouth of the Klamath River near Requa, California. Within a matter of years, the plentiful beavers in the Klamath Basin had been mostly wiped out. Beaver dams had previously been an important factor in stream habitat in the Klamath River watershed, helping to moderate the power of floods and creating extensive wetlands. The loss of the beaver dams resulted in detrimental consequences for watercourses in the basin, exacerbating the power of winter floods, and causing severe erosion. Trapping parties eventually moved southwest into the Sacramento Valley and blazed an extension of the Siskiyou Trail, an early path between the Oregon Territory and San Francisco Bay. Despite the environmental implications, extensive and fertile meadows left behind by the draining of beaver ponds attracted many settlers to the region later on.|$|E

2500|$|As {{early as}} 2,000 years ago, Indian Nations {{probably}} used Gichi-onigaming, or “the Great Carrying Place”, {{to travel from}} summer homes on Lake Superior to winter hunting grounds {{in the interior of}} Minnesota and Ontario. In 1729 Cree guide Auchagah drew a map for some of the first French fur traders, to show them how to reach the [...] "western sea" [...] of Lake Winnipeg.

Stewart also created a video on behalf of <b>fur-bearing</b> animals after being approached by PETA while in jail. Stewart stated, [...] "I used to wear real fur, but, like many others, I {{had a change of}} heart when I learned what actually happens to the animals". Stewart filmed a public service announcement on behalf of the farm animal welfare organization Farm Sanctuary.|$|E
