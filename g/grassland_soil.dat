40|$|We {{obtained}} {{soil samples}} from geographically diverse switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) crop sites and from nearby reference grasslands and compared their edaphic properties, microbial gene diversity and abundance, and active microbial biomass content. We hypothesized that soils under switchgrass, a perennial, {{would be more}} similar to reference <b>grassland</b> <b>soils</b> than sorghum, an annual crop. Sorghum crop soils had significantly higher NO 3 −-N, NH 4 +-N, SO 4 2 −-S, and Cu levels than <b>grassland</b> <b>soils.</b> In contrast, few significant differences in soil chemistry were observed between switchgrass crop and <b>grassland</b> <b>soils.</b> Active bacterial biomass was significantly lower in sorghum soils than switchgrass soils. Using GeoChip 4. 0 functional gene arrays, we observed that microbial gene diversity was significantly lower in sorghum <b>soils</b> than <b>grassland</b> <b>soils.</b> Gene diversity at sorghum locations was negatively correlated with NO 3 −-N, NH 4 +-N, and SO 4 2 −-S in C and N cycling microbial gene categories. Microbial gene diversity at switchgrass sites varied among geographic locations, but crop and grassland sites tended to be similar. Microbial gene abundance did not differ between sorghum crop and <b>grassland</b> <b>soils,</b> but was generally lower in switchgrass crop <b>soils</b> compared to <b>grassland</b> <b>soils.</b> Our results suggest that switchgrass has fewer adverse impacts on microbial soil ecosystem services than cultivation of an annual biofuel crop such as sorghum.

50|$|Another {{off-site}} {{effect can}} be seen with regard to groundwater. The infiltration rate of <b>grassland</b> <b>soil</b> without traffic is five times higher than on soil with severe traffic. A consequence might be a reduced recharge of groundwater.

In regions where “the subsoil provides a significant proportion of the water required by crops to meet transpiration demands”, often being dependent on agriculture, this danger of compaction is most present.|$|E
50|$|The {{underlying}} {{principle in}} the use of the term “soil health” is that soil is not just an inert, lifeless growing medium, which modern farming tends to represent, rather it is a living, dynamic and ever-so-subtly changing whole environment. It turns out that soils highly fertile from the point of view of crop productivity are also lively from a biological point of view. It is now commonly recognized that soil microbial biomass is large: in temperate <b>grassland</b> <b>soil</b> the bacterial and fungal biomass have been documented to be 1-2 t/hectare and 2-5 t/ha, respectively. Some microbiologists now believe that 80% of soil nutrient functions are essentially controlled by microbes.If this is consistently true, than the prevailing Liebig nutrient theory model, and Mitscherlich modifications of it, all which exclude biology, are perhaps dangerously incorrect for managing soil fertility sustainably for the future.|$|E

40|$|The {{oxidation}} {{of ammonia}} (NH₃) to nitrate (NO₃⁻) {{is a key}} process in the global nitrogen (N) cycle which has major ecological and environmental implications both in influencing nitrous oxide (N₂O) emissions and NO₃⁻ leaching. We investigated the relationships between nitrification, NO₃⁻ leaching and N₂O emissions with ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) in nitrogen rich <b>grassland</b> <b>soils.</b> Both AOA and AOB were detected in large numbers in these <b>grassland</b> <b>soils.</b> The AOB abundance grew by 3. 2 to 10. 4 fold and activity increased by 177 fold {{in response to the}} addition of a urine-N substrate, and the AOB growth was significantly inhibited by a nitrification inhibitor, dicyandiamide (DCD). However, neither the AOA abundance, nor activity, increased with the application of an ammonia substrate. DCD decreased NO₃⁻ leaching by 59 % and decreased N₂O emissions by 64 % from animal urine-N patches. Significant quantitative relationships were found between the AOB abundance and the nitrification rate, NO₃⁻ -N leaching losses, and N₂O emissions, whereas no such relationships were found with AOA. These findings suggest that nitrification and thus NO₃⁻ leaching and N₂O emissions are driven by bacteria rather than archaea in these nitrogen rich <b>grassland</b> <b>soils...</b>|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{our work}} was to survey and state the {{representative}} values and range of the microbial biomass carbon (Cmic) and microbial respiration activities in arable soils of three types (Chernozem, Luvisol, Planosol) and in pasture <b>grassland</b> <b>soil</b> (Cambisol). In arable soils {{no significant differences between}} the soil types were found concerning the content of Cmic. Way of soil use significantly influenced Cmic with higher values on pasture <b>grassland</b> <b>soil.</b> In Cambisol, a relatively strong relationships between Cmic and Corg (r = 0. 919) as well as between Cmic and Ntot (r = 0. 922) were determined. The basal respiration (BR) was no affected neither by a soil type nor by a way of soil use. On all monitored sites microbes responded positively to the addition of glucose (potential respiration - PR), but the strongest response was observed on the soil types with good mineralisation ability, such as Chernozems and Luvisols. On pasture <b>grassland</b> <b>soil,</b> the substrate availability index (PR/BR) with values of 2. 32 was observed, which is lower compared to 7. 60 of arable soil.

The results showed that during the incubation period, the net nitrogen mineralization rate of the stipa baicalensis meadow steppe, the Aneulolepidum Chinese steppe and the Stipa grandis steppe was 0. 035, 0. 120 and 0. 125 kg/(hm 2 ·d), respectively.

40|$|The {{composition}} of soil communities can strongly affect the growth rate and the {{composition of}} grassland plant communities, as the soil community changes during succession. However, {{more research is needed}} on the most suitable soil (mixture) for soil transplantation as a restoration measure for species-rich grasslands. In this study, the effect of soil communities from different successional stages on the growth of target plants for nature restoration and non-target plants (weeds) was tested by using inoculation. Soil was collected at arable lands, grasslands, and heathlands. Two soil types were mixed (e. g. <b>grassland</b> <b>soil</b> and heathland soil), after which the effect of the mixture on the plant community was determined. Possible synergistic effects between soil communities could then be observed by comparing mixed inocula to pure inocula. This has received little experimental testing. Introducing soil mixtures with a synergistic effect on the plant community could then be a helpful tool for increasing succession from an arable land to grasslands. It was observed that pots inoculated with 25 percent of <b>grassland</b> <b>soil</b> mixed with 75 percent of heathland soil created a surprising synergistic effect, where the target biomass was higher than expected based on the pure inocula. Furthermore, it was found that pots inoculated with 100 percent heathland soil contained a higher percentage of target biomass {{at the end of the}} experiment than pots with other inocula. It can therefore be concluded that soil mixtures containing a high percentage of heathland soils and little <b>grassland</b> <b>soil</b> can enhance the nature restoration of grasslands, where a mixture with 25 percent of <b>grassland</b> <b>soil</b> and 75 percent of heathland soil was most effective due to its synergistic effect on the target biomass...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to compare density of enchytraeids and the activity of dehydrogenases (ADh), urease (AU), and invertase (AI) in the <b>soils</b> of <b>grassland</b> and arable land. Relationships that exist between those biological parameters and the basic soil properties (the content of total organic carbon (TOC) and nitrogen (TN), pH, texture, and total porosity) were defined. In the research, soil material from humus horizon of 12 soils which were located in the Mały Beskid and Silesian Foothills (S Poland) was used. The main density of enchytraeids in <b>grassland</b> <b>soils</b> (12 982 ind⋅m- 2) was twice higher than in arable land soils (6099 ind⋅m- 2), and the differences were statistically significant. <b>Grassland</b> <b>soils</b> were characterised by higher enzymatic activity than arable land soils. However, only ADh, which were almost three times higher in grassland than in arable soils (2024 and 742 μmol TPFkg- 1 h- 1, respectively), showed significant differences.

40|$|Seasonal and {{management}} {{influences on the}} fungal community structure of two upland <b>grassland</b> <b>soils</b> were investigated. An upland site containing both unimproved, floristically-diverse (U 4 a) and mesotrophic, improved (MG 7 b) grassland types was selected, and samples from both grassland types were taken at five times in one year. Soil fungal community structure was assessed using fungal automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA), a DNA-profiling approach. Grassl{{and management}} regime was found to strongly affect fungal community structure, with fungal ARISA profiles from unimproved and improved <b>grassland</b> <b>soils</b> differing significantly. The number of fungal ribotypes found was higher in unimproved than improved <b>grassland</b> <b>soils,</b> providing evidence that improvement may reduce the suitability of upland soil as a habitat for specific groups of fungi. Seasonal influences on fungal community structure were also noted, with samples taken in autumn (October) more correlated with change in ribotype profiles than samples from other seasons. However, seasonal variation did not obscure the measurement of differences in fungal community structure that were due to agricultural improvement, with canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) indicating grassland type had a stronger influence on fungal profiles than season...|$|R
40|$|Macroorganic {{matter of}} arable soils which had {{received}} different inputs of organic residues for 25 y and <b>grassland</b> <b>soils</b> {{that had been}} under grass for at least 8 y was fractionated into light, intermediate and heavy fractions using a stable silica suspension as heavy liquid. For all residue treatments, the C-to-N ratios of organic matter decreased in the order light, intermediate, heavy macroorganic matter (fraction > 150 μm) and non-macroorganic matter (fraction < 150 μm). Residue application had a stronger effect on the amount and C-to-N ratio of macroorganic matter fractions than on the amount and C-to-N ratio non-macroorganic matter. Textural effects were apparent with the proportions of soil N in the light and intermediate fractions being higher in coarse-textured <b>grassland</b> <b>soils</b> than in fine-textured <b>grassland</b> <b>soils.</b> C and N mineralization were positively correlated {{with the amount of}} C and N in the light fraction and the active microbial biomass. The correlation with mineralization decreased with increasing stability of the organic matter fractions. C and N mineralization per unit of total microbial biomass were lower in fine-textured soils than in coarse-textured soils. This is ascribed to a greater physical protection of the organic matter in fine-textured soils than in coarse-textured soils...|$|R
40|$|Grasslands in China cover vast, {{continuous}} {{areas and}} {{account for about}} 40 % of Chinese land area. Most {{are located in the}} eco-geographical fragile region, are sensitive to climate change, and play important roles in regulating the carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere. Our objective was to review recent studies on soil respiration of grassland in China. Most studies were conducted in Northeast Plain, Inner Mongolia and Tibetan Plateau. Diurnal dynamics of soil respiration are controlled by temperature, seasonal patterns are controlled by temperature and/or water depending on the limiting environmental factors, and inter-annual variability is mainly determined by water. In addition, there is great spatial heterogeneity driven by mean annual precipitation and soil total nitrogen content. Responses of soil respiration to global changes were complicated and depended on the interaction of each factor. Most recent soil respiration models failed to incorporate the modulation of soil and biotic factors and their interaction. Key issues and suggested future research topics are 1) soil respiration in temperate desert grassland, 2) soil respiration during non-growing season, 3) comparison study of <b>grassland</b> <b>soil</b> respiration on different spatial and temporal scales, 4) simulation study of <b>grassland</b> <b>soil</b> respiration and 5) remote sensing of <b>grassland</b> <b>soil</b> respiration...|$|E

40|$|Although soil {{biochemical}} {{properties are}} considered to be good indicators of changes in soil quality, few studies have been made of the changes in biochemical properties brought about by anthropogenic disturbance of grassland ecosystems. In the present study, several biochemical properties were analysed in 31 <b>grassland</b> <b>soils</b> subjected to a high level of management, and the values obtained were compared with known values corresponding to native grasslands from the same region (Galicia, NW Spain). The 31 managed grasslands were divided into two groups (re-sown grasslands and improved grasslands) according to their management and past land use. The biochemical properties studied were: labile carbon, microbial biomass carbon, microbial respiration, metabolic quotient, net nitrogen mineralisation and the activities of dehydrogenase, catalase, phosphodiesterase, phosphomonoesterase, casein hydrolysing proteases, benzoyl arginamide (BAA) -hydrolysing proteases, urease, cellulase, ß-glucosidase, invertase and arylsulphatase.

40|$|Methanotrophs are an {{important}} group of methane (CH(4)) -oxidizing bacteria in the soil, which act as a major sink for the greenhouse gas, CH(4). In grazed grassland, one of the ecologically most sensitive areas is the animal urine patch soil, which is {{a major source of}} both nitrate (NO(3) (-)) leaching and nitrous oxide (N(2) O) emissions. Nitrification inhibitors, such as dicyandiamide (DCD), have been used to mitigate NO(3) (-) leaching and N(2) O emissions in grazed pastures. However, it is not clear if the high nitrogen loading rate in the animal urine patch soil and the use of nitrification inhibitors would {{have an impact on the}} abundance of methanotrophs in grazed <b>grassland</b> <b>soils.</b> The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of animal urine and DCD on methanotroph abundance in grazed <b>grassland</b> <b>soils.</b> A laboratory incubation study was conducted to determine the effect of urine and DCD applications on the abundance of methanotrophs in six grazed <b>grassland</b> <b>soils</b> sampled from across New Zealand, using real-time PCR targeting the functional pmoA gene. Results showed that the pmoA gene copy numbers were low in these soils, mostly below 2. 36 x 10 (4) g(- 1) soil except in the West Coast soil where pmoA gene copy number reached 8. 95 x 10 (5) g(- 1) soil. Most of the clones identified were aligned to the type II methanotrophs. There was no significant effect (P < 0. 05) on the abundance of methanotrophs by the applications of urine at 1, 000 kg N ha(- 1) or DCD at 10 kg ha(- 1). These results suggest that the abundance of methanotrophs is not affected by urine deposition or the application of DCD to mitigate NO(3) (-) leaching and N(2) O emissions in grazed <b>grassland</b> <b>soils...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{conversion}} of grassland into cultivated land {{is a common}} agricultural practice, generally leading to the decrease of the soil organic matter (SOM) content. In this study, we analysed quantitative changes in carbon content. Additionally qualitative changes occurring in the soil organic matter composition on a molecular basis were assessed using Curiepoint pyrolysis coupled to gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (pyrolysis GC/MS). The aim {{of the study was}} to follow the development of SOM in <b>grassland</b> <b>soil,</b> after conversion into arable soil.

The relative contributions of single molecules were obtained by the integration of the total ion chromatogram. Pyrolysis products derived from lignins, proteins and polysaccharides were identified in all samples. SOM under grassland, arable land and converted grassland released similar pyrolysis products. Three months after the conversion, lignin-derived pyrolysis products were found at lower concentrations in the converted <b>grassland</b> <b>soil.</b> Principal component analysis showed that arable land, grassland and the converted grassland could be distinguished using the score plot of the 2 nd and 3 rd principal components.
