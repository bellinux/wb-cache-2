50|$|Tramadol, in {{addition}} to its actions as an opioid and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, is an SRA and is used as an analgesic. It is also under investigation as an antidepressant. <b>Indeloxazine</b> is an SRA and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that was formerly used as an antidepressant, nootropic, and neuroprotective.|$|E
50|$|<b>Indeloxazine</b> {{acts as a}} {{serotonin}} releasing agent, norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, and NMDA receptor antagonist. It {{has been}} found to enhance acetylcholine release in the rat forebrain through activation of the 5-HT4 receptor via its action as a serotonin releasing agent. The drug {{has been found to}} possess nootropic, neuroprotective, anticonvulsant, and antidepressant-like effects in animal models.|$|E
50|$|<b>Indeloxazine</b> (INN) (Elen, Noin) is an {{antidepressant}} and cerebral activator {{that was}} marketed in Japan and South Korea by Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd {{for the treatment}} of psychiatric symptoms associated with cerebrovascular diseases, namely depression resulting from stroke, emotional disturbance, and avolition. It was marketed from 1988 to 1998, when it was removed from the market reportedly for lack of effectiveness.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} enzymes {{participating in}} a-glucoside formation, a novel metabolic pathway of xenobiotics in a metabolic study of <b>indeloxazine</b> hydrochloride in rats. When rat tissue homogenates and the <b>indeloxazine</b> metabolite trans- 4 -(2 -morpholinylmethoxy) - 1, 2 -indandiol (M- 2) were incubated, M- 2 -c-glucoside formation was ob-served in liver. This reaction was almost completely inhibited by the a-glucosidase inhibitor acarbose. The liver homogenate was then separated into subcellular fractions and an acid a-glucosldase in lysosomes and two neutral a-glucosidases in microsomes and cy-tosol were partially purified. The chromatographic behavior and optimum pH of the glucosyltransferase activity {{of each of}} the enzyme preparations were almost identical with those of a-glucosidase (hy-drolase) activity of the same specimen, suggesting the former actlv-ity to be also due to a-glucosidase. Agreeing with their hydrolytic substrate specificities, the acid enzyme transferred glucose to M-...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effects of}} {{long-term}} psychological stress on sexual behavior and brain catecholamines were investigated in rats. Stress was applied using the communication box developed by Ogawa and Kuwabara (1996), and a psychological stress group (n = 12), a physical stress group (n = 5), and {{a control group}} (n = 5) were established. Stress was applied for 1 hour every day for 10 consecutive weeks. Sexual behavior was observed {{before the start of}} exposure to stress and 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 weeks thereafter. The results showed that long-term psychological stress impaired the sexual behavior of male rats. Long-term psychological stress decreased the concentrations of catecholamine and its metabolites in the brain, especially in the medial preoptic area (MPOA). Thus, we hypothesized that low catecholamine neurotransmission in the brain results in impairment of male rat sexual behavior. We then tried to restore the impaired sexual behavior by administration of a cerebral-activating drug, <b>indeloxazine</b> hydrochloride. The administration of <b>indeloxazine</b> hydrochloride for a 3 -week period restored the sexual behavior that had been impaired by long-term psychological stress. These present results suggest that impairment of neurotransmission in the central nervous system could be a cause of sexual dysfunction, and activation of neurotransmission may result in restoration of impaired male sexual behavior...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAS 1069562 is the (+) -isomer of <b>indeloxazine,</b> {{which had}} been {{clinically}} used as a cerebral activator {{for the treatment of}} cerebrovascular diseases with serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition (SNRI) and neuroprotection. Here, we compared the analgesic effects of repeated treatment with AS 1069562 and duloxetine, a selective SNRI, on pain-related behavior in a rat model of streptozotocin (STZ) -induced diabetic neuropathy. Further, we also evaluated the effects on the expression of neurotrophic factors and nerve conduction velocity. AS 1069562 and duloxetine by single daily administration for 4 weeks significantly improved mechanical allodynia in STZ-induced diabetic rats and did not affect plasma glucose level or body weight. Interestingly, the analgesic effect of AS 1069562 continued after a consecutive 1 -week treatment discontinuation, although the plasma concentration of AS 1069562 was reduced to undetectable levels. In contrast, the efficacy of duloxetine disappeared after treatment discontinuation. Expression analysis demonstrated that AS 1069562 significantly restored decreased insulin-like growth factor 1 and fibroblast growth factor 2 mRNA levels in dorsal root ganglion and spinal cord, respectively, whereas duloxetine did not affect the expression levels of neurotrophic factors. In addition, AS 1069562 reversed the slowing of nerve conduction velocity. The results {{of this study indicate that}} the analgesic effect of repeated dosing of AS 1069562 but not duloxetine is persistent even after a 1 -week drug discontinuation in STZ-induced diabetic rats. Restoration of neurotrophic factors may be involved in the curative-like pharmacological effect of this agent. Thus, AS 1069562 may potentially offer a better treatment option for patients with painful diabetic neuropathy than duloxetine via different mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe (+) -isomer of <b>indeloxazine</b> AS 1069562 exerts {{multiple}} pharmacological actions {{including the}} inhibition of serotonin (5 -HT) and norepinephrine reuptake and analgesia in experimental animal pain models. Here, we evaluated the antinociceptive effects of AS 1069562 and the antidepressants duloxetine and amitriptyline in mouse models of prostaglandin-induced spinal hypersensitivity. Prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) and F 2 α (PGF 2 α) were intrathecally administered to induce spinal hypersensitivity, causing tactile allodynia in mice. Allodynia induced by PGF 2 α {{but not by}} PGE 2 was suppressed by desensitization of C-fibers with systemic pretreatment with resiniferatoxin. C-fiber hyperexcitability might therefore {{play a role in}} allodynia induced by PGF 2 α but not PGE 2. In the PGE 2 -induced allodynia model, AS 1069562 and duloxetine significantly suppressed allodynia, whereas amitriptyline did not. In the PGF 2 α-induced allodynia model, AS 1069562 and amitriptyline significantly ameliorated allodynia, whereas duloxetine did not. To demonstrate the broad effects of AS 1069562 compared to duloxetine, additional studies were conducted to elucidate other target mechanisms of AS 1069562 beyond 5 -HT and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition. AS 1069562 exhibited affinity for both 5 -HT 1 A and 5 -HT 3 receptors, and the analgesic effect of AS 1069562 on PGF 2 α-induced allodynia was significantly blocked by the 5 -HT 1 A receptor antagonist (S) –WAY 100135 and the 5 -HT 3 receptor agonist SR 57227. Taken together, these results indicate that AS 1069562 inhibits both C-fiber- and non-C-fiber-dependent prostaglandin-induced allodynia, while duloxetine inhibits only non-C-fiber-triggered allodynia, and amitriptyline inhibits only C-fiber-triggered allodynia. These broad antinociceptive effects of AS 1069562 may be due not only to 5 -HT and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition but also to its effects on 5 -HT receptors such as 5 -HT 1 A and 5 -HT 3 receptors...|$|E
