25|$|As a flow in {{a channel}} becomes supersonic, one {{significant}} change takes place. The conservation of {{mass flow rate}} leads one to expect that contracting the flow channel would increase the flow speed (i.e. making the channel narrower results in faster air flow) and at subsonic speeds this holds true. However, once the flow becomes supersonic, the relationship of <b>flow</b> <b>area</b> and speed is reversed: expanding the channel actually increases the speed.|$|E

2500|$|The skatepark has two {{distinct}} main areas, the Trenches and the Skylit Bowl. [...] The Trenches {{is a unique}} <b>flow</b> <b>area</b> {{with a mix of}} banks, ledges, walls, stairs, gaps, and rails in various combinations and arrangements. [...] The majority of the Trenches is poured-in-place concrete with a brick central plaza. The layout arrangement and concrete coloring of this area is inspired by Albuquerque's drainage arroyos and allows users to ride lines or session specific elements. The arrangement also disperses users throughout the park instead of congregating them in the middle. The entire area drains via surface flow which discharges through a replica arroyo section.|$|E
2500|$|One way of quantitatively {{ensuring}} {{the health of}} indoor air is by the frequency of effective turnover of interior air by replacement with outside air. [...] In the UK, for example, classrooms are required to have 2.5 outdoor air changes per hour. [...] In halls, gym, dining, and physiotherapy spaces, the ventilation should be sufficient to limit carbon dioxide to 1,500 ppm. In the USA, and according to ASHRAE Standards, ventilation in classrooms {{is based on the}} amount of outdoor air per occupant plus the amount of outdoor air per unit of floor area, not air changes per hour. Since carbon dioxide indoors comes from occupants and outdoor air, the adequacy of ventilation per occupant is indicated by the concentration indoors minus the concentration outdoors. The value of 615 ppm above the outdoor concentration indicates approximately 15 cubic feet per minute of outdoor air per adult occupant doing sedentary office work where outdoor air contains 385 ppm, the current global average atmospheric CO2 concentration. In classrooms, the requirements in the ASHRAE standard 62.1, Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor Air Quality, would typically result in about 3 air changes per hour, depending on the occupant density. Of course the occupants aren't the only source of pollutants, so outdoor air ventilation may need to be higher when unusual or strong sources of pollution exist indoors. When outdoor air is polluted, then bringing in more outdoor air can actually worsen the overall quality of the indoor air and exacerbate some occupant symptoms related to outdoor air pollution. Generally, outdoor country air is better than indoor city air.

5000|$|For higher flight speeds {{a moving}} cone becomes {{necessary}} {{to allow the}} supersonic compression to occur more efficiently over {{a wider range of}} speeds. With increasing flight speed the cone is moved to the rear, or into the intake.

The compression occurring in this path is called [...] "internal compression" [...] (as opposed to the [...] "external compression" [...] on the cone).
