30|$|Compared to P 2 P NIL, {{the mold}} {{separation}} {{at the end}} of the imprinting process requires less force. However, in the study of Dumond and the team [51], R 2 R NIL demolds with the parts and imprint mold moving in circular motion. This relative movement can cause a collision and damage the parts in the process. More attention should be paid when designing the microstructure for the R 2 R NIL process. In recent development of the R 2 R nanoimprint lithography device, the separation of the cured resin from the mold is generally assisted by a <b>deflection</b> <b>roller</b> and a certain amount of web tension.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Lateral bending of L-shape {{plate is}} a novel forming {{technology}} to manufacture flange-like parts from angle bar or L-shape plate. However, the inevitable <b>rollers</b> <b>deflection</b> induced by rolling force leads to significant decrease in radius prediction accuracy of the flange products. Therefore, the radius compensation is implemented through adjusting forming parameters {{in order to obtain}} a flange product with the designed radius. In the paper, the rolling force and <b>rollers</b> <b>deflection</b> are solved with considering the workpiece-roller interaction; on this basis, a radius compensation scheme is proposed and evaluated. The results show that the predicted radii deviate from the desired ones less than 7. 22 %...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{modern world}} of {{mechanical}} and electrical engineering disposes {{of a very}} high amount of appliances and devices for measuring the values of various parameters. When designing a device for measuring the <b>deflection</b> of a <b>roller</b> in a two cylinder bending machine, the measured parameter of the deflection can deviate by several dozen micrometers either side of zero. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} design a measuring appliance or device with the sensitivity to measure this error of measurement within these limits. Similarly, we have to consider the fact that the device of the bending machine is already produced as an individual machine and the design of the device for measuring the deflection will be part of its superstructure...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{the process}} of the heavy rail roller straightening, the roller {{leveller}} only presses the plastic deformation on the web of heavy rail. Because the stiffness of flanges which are in both sides is stronger than the web, the heavy rail always has the phenomenon of web falling. In that case, we can not achieve the desired effect of straightening by the theoretic bending deflection. In this paper, a finite element model of one straightening unit was built by the ANSYS, the straightening process was simulated and the web falling affect with the bending <b>deflection</b> and the <b>roller</b> spacing was analyzed. Some pictures of curve were drew through the relationships of bending deflection and web falling, the relationships of roller spacing and web falling. In order to gain the better straightening effect, the actual bending deflection can be the sum of the theoretical bending deflection and web falling from the curve once the roller spacing was defined...|$|R
40|$|Spherical roller {{bearings}} have typically {{been used in}} applications with speeds limited to about 5000 rpm and loads limited for operation at less than about 0. 25 million DN. However, spherical {{roller bearings}} are now being designed for high load and high speed applications including aerospace applications. A computer program, SASHBEAN, was developed to provide an analytical tool to design, analyze, and predict the performance of high speed, single row, angular contact (including zero contact angle), spherical roller bearings. The material presented is the mathematical formulation and analytical methods used to develop computer program SASHBEAN. For a given set of operating conditions, the program calculates the bearings ring deflections (axial and radial), <b>roller</b> <b>deflections,</b> contact areas stresses, depth and magnitude of maximum shear stresses, axial thrust, rolling element and cage rotational speeds, lubrication parameters, fatigue lives, and rates of heat generation. Centrifugal forces and gyroscopic moments are fully considered. The program is also capable of performing steady-state and time-transient thermal analyses of the bearing system...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{simulation}} tool {{is presented to}} support the design process of systems of flexible, rubber-covered rollers. A mathematical model is developed to determine the axial pressure variations in the nips of these systems. In the model the indentations of the rubber layers are coupled to the <b>deflections</b> of the <b>rollers</b> due to bending. The model is generic {{in the sense that}} the number of rollers in the system is not fixed, and rollers may have different lengths and be located asymmetrically with respect to each other. The rollers bend due to linear conditions applied at arbitrary positions along the roller axes. The rollers may have a surface profile and the rubber layer thicknesses may vary. In each nip paper can be present, located at any position. By an efficient numerical algorithm that solves the model, the effect of bending on the nip pressure distribution is determined. Crowning, use of an additional support roller, and internal bearings are examples shown as means to achieve a uniform pressure distribution...|$|R
40|$|The {{computer}} program SASHBEAN (Sikorsky Aircraft Spherical Roller High Speed Bearing Analysis) analyzes and predicts the operating {{characteristics of a}} Single Row, Angular Contact, Spherical Roller Bearing (SRACSRB). The program runs on an IBM or IBM compatible personal computer, and for a given set of input data analyzes the bearing design for it's ring deflections (axial and radial), <b>roller</b> <b>deflections,</b> contact areas and stresses, induced axial thrust, rolling element and cage rotation speeds, lubrication parameters, fatigue lives, and amount of heat generated in the bearing. The dynamic loading of rollers due to centrifugal forces and gyroscopic moments, which becomes quite significant at high speeds, is fully considered in this analysis. For a known application and it's parameters, the program is also capable of performing steady-state and time-transient thermal analyses of the bearing system. The steady-state analysis capability allows the user to estimate the expected steady-state temperature map {{in and around the}} bearing under normal operating conditions. On the other hand, the transient analysis feature provides the user a means to simulate the 'lost lubricant' condition and predict a time-temperature history of various critical points in the system. The bearing's 'time-to-failure' estimate may also be made from this (transient) analysis by considering the bearing as failed when a certain temperature limit is reached in the bearing components. The program is fully interactive and allows the user to get started and access most of its features with a minimal of training. For the most part, the program is menu driven, and adequate help messages were provided to guide a new user through various menu options and data input screens. All input data, both for mechanical and thermal analyses, are read through graphical input screens, thereby eliminating any need of a separate text editor/word processor to edit/create data files. Provision is also available to select and view the contents of output files on the monitor screen if no paper printouts are required. A separate volume (Volume- 2) of this documentation describes, in detail, the underlying mathematical formulations, assumptions, and solution algorithms of this program...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop guidelines and criteria for design and construction of overlays on cracked and seated concrete pavements. The main factors which are investigated in this study include number of the seated roller pass, weight of seating roller pass, weight of seating roller, thickness of overlay, fiber content and fiber layer location. Eleven test sections were constructed on I- 65 and twenty two test sections were constructed on US- 31. An extensive investigation was conducted involving both field and laboratory testing. Field investigations included pavement condition survey and non destructive testing (NDT) of the pavements using FWD or Dynaflect. The laboratory investigation focused on physical property testing, complex modulus testing and fatigue testing. Three fiber extraction methods have been developed for this project. Preliminary test Results show good precision of these methods. These fiber extraction methods should be used in future projects. Deflection measurements can be used to determine the appropriate weight and drop height of the breaking head. The Guillotine breaker used in this project is effective in breaking PCC pavement. A 40 ton roller is recommended because the 50 ton roller apprears to “overwork” the crack concrete pavement. Roller passes have no significant effect on the maximum <b>deflections.</b> The optimum <b>roller</b> pass can not be determined exclusively based on the maximum deflections. One to three passes of a 40 ton pneumatic-tired roller is adequate when seating is needed to assure contact of cracked pavement pieces with the subgrade. Use of fiber and the fiber layer location do not have a significant effect on pavement strength in term of the maximum deflection. But use of fiber will delay the crack development. The least cracks were developed in the sections which have fiber in all three layers. It is recommended that fiber be used in all overlay layers. Overlay thickness has an important effect on the maximum deflections and the development of reflective cracks. General trends of crack development showed in the first two years. Cracked and seated sections have less cracks than non cracked and seated sections, with other conditions being the same. The general trends are not obvious after two years. Beams of 3 x 3 in. are recommended to be used for the flexural fatigue tests in the future due to small variability. Addition of fiber increase the fatigue life of overlay mixture. Composite samples with fiber (4. 5 lb) have predicted fatigue life two times greater than those without fiber. Loading frequency and temperature have significant effects on dynamic modulus and phase angle of overlay mixture. The addition of fiber will change the viscoelastic properties of mixture...|$|R
