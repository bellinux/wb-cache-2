The increase in economic activities has also resulted {{to an increase in}} the country air pollution problem. One of the main sources of the pollutants is emissions from motor vehicles, which is originated from incomplete fuel combustion; either diesel or gasoline. Among the emissions that are considered to be harmful to human health and environment are carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC), nitrogen oxide (NOX), sulphur oxide (SOX) and carbon soot. Most emissions are equally contributed both gasoline and diesel fuelled vehicles. However, heavy duty diesel fuelled vehicles are the main contributor for the soot and NOX emissions. At present, in Malaysia, there is no regulation that forces diesel fuelled vehicles to be installed with <b>exhaust</b> <b>after</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>system,</b> which is able to reduce soot emission.

In course of time, soot will be deposited inside the DPFs which tend to clog the filter and hence generate a back pressure in the exhaust system, negatively impacting the fuel efficiency. To remove the soot build-up, regeneration of the DPF must be done as an engine exhaust after treatment process at pre-determined time intervals.

40|$|Diesel engine {{developers}} are facing major challenges when meeting future demands on NOx and particulate emissions. The <b>exhausts</b> <b>after</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>systems</b> are rapidly improving and the technologies {{available in a}} few years will be capable of cutting emission levels close to the demanded levels. However, in order to reach the low emissions required in a long-lasting, cost effective way, the potential of reducing engine-out emissions must be fully utilized. Fortunately, engine management systems and hardware are now available to optimize fuel injection and heat release for low emissions while maintaining the trademarks of the diesel engine, i. e. low fuel consumption and dependable performance. The possibilities offered by the new technologies are so wide-ranging that, in order to use them optimally, models must be developed to guide the engine developer. The model developed by the author is a zero-dimensional multizone model. Input to the model could be either a measured pressure trace or an arbitrary heat release rate. One of the cornerstones of the model is the assumption that NO is formed in zones that are burning close to stoichiometric conditions. The actual lambda value in these zones is found by comparing calculated and measured concentrations in the exhaust. According to the results, some of the effects observed on NO formation when varying the parameters of injection are due to the differences in local lambda. It has been found that the local lambda determined with the model for a given injection system stays constant, even if the settings of the injection system are changed. Thus, there are reasons to expect that predicted trends of limited variations of injection parameters will be close to reality. The results obtained with the model agree with results from more advanced models and with laser based measurements in optically accessible engines...|$|R

While these <b>after</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>systems</b> are incredibly effective at reducing harmful emissions, to operate effectively the system needs to be above a certain temperature level typically between 250 and 300 Â°C. Many methods such as additional fueling or electrical heaters have been explored and used to increase the temperature of the exhaust gases passing through these systems to heat them faster or maintain temperature. ^ The effect of cylinder deactivation, CDA, and late intake valve closing, LIVC, on raising exhaust gas temperatures was studied by performing load sweeps at 1200 RPM. The effect of CDA, CDA and LIVC, and CDA meeting specific NOx targets was analyzed. At low loads, CDA proved to be effective at raising exhaust temperature as well as providing an improvement in brake thermal efficiency, BTE. At higher loads, exhaust gas temperatures were also improved, but with a fuel consumption penalty. The introduction of LIVC in combination with CDA increased exhaust temperatures above 250 Â°C, but did not improve BTE. The last sweeps, which targeted low NOx emissions, required the use of EGR and were able to raise temperatures above 250 Â°C across all loads while meeting the targets. While meeting the targets, BTE was only improved at low loads. ^ The sweeps demonstrated that CDA and CDA combined with LIVC can be an extremely effective technology for raising exhaust gas temperatures even at low loads where exhaust temperatures are usually lowest. In many cases, an improvement in BTE can be accomplished as well. ...|$|R

Fuel tests showed that fuel temperature, substitution ratio and engine speed {{play a key role}} in determining the spray characteristics of the Ultra Biofuel blends. However, under real world operating conditions, the Bioltec fuel blending system was found to overcome these effects by using lower C 2 G Ultra Biofuel:PD substitution ratios during cold start and low speed conditions. Overall the fuel tests suggested it to be convenient to operate the engine on blends with Ultra Biofuel content up to 80 % to avoid higher fuel consumption and higher pollution load on the <b>exhaust</b> <b>after</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>system,</b> particularly at low temperatures and rpm. In the real world tests, average substitution ratios of 85 % were achieved, with close to 100 % Ultra Biofuel achieved for high speed steady state conditions, with no negative impact on particulate emissions. The vast majority (60 - 80 %) of the particulate mass within the exhaust was found within size fractions below 2. 5 Î¼m for both fuels and was thus within the respirablem range. The PD produced around twice the concentration of particulates within these finer fractions compared to the equivalent trips using the blended fuel. Thermo-gravimetric Analysis demonstrated that the PD produced higher concentrations of black carbon (soot) and the Ultra Biofuel blends more organic carbon within the particulates.

A model of a diesel engine and it's electronic control system is developed to capture the engines behaviour in a vehicle simulation environment. The modelled quantities are brake torque, fuel consumption and exhaust gas temperature and are based on engine speed and pedal position. In order to describe these outputs the inlet air flow and boost pressure are also modelled and used as inner variables. The model is intended to be implemented on board a vehicle in a control unit which has limited computational performance. To keep the model as computationally efficient as possible the model basically consists of look-up tables and polynomials.

The most effective of these systems is the DPF, actually providing filtration rates better than 90 %. The geometry of the DPF structure has an important influence on its performance. Simulation offers a valuable tool for the evaluation and optimisation of various DPF designs. The present paper demonstrates the usage of the COMSOL multi physics code for modelling DPF systems. The complete model {{is based on a}} single pair of DPF channels composed of inlet / outlet channel, porous wall and the ash layer. Alternating plugs sealing the inlet- and outlet channels force the soot loaded exhaust gas to flow through the porous walls, where the soot is deposited into porous structure and at a growing soot cake layer. It is advantageous to separate the modelling of a DPF into several stages. In a first stage the pressure drop over the complete DPF channel structure unit cell is analysed in a CFD-analysis, also incorporating nonlinear pressure loss contributions due to flow contraction and expansion at the channel in and outlets. The pressure difference across the porous walls and the soot cake follows from Darcy's Law. In a next stage the soot deposition with its effect on the permeability of the porous walls and initiation of soot cake growth is included into the analysis. Phenomenological approximations on a continuum level are applied to account for the different microscopic and molecular processes of soot deposition within and at the surface of the porous wall structures. There is a strong both way interaction between gas flow field and soot deposition. The model results are compared to experimental measures of the DPF filter segments.

The aim of this project is to develop a general way (method and tool support) to calculate and analyse current consumption of the powertrain system. In this work several models with different levels of accuracy have been designed in order to simulate the current consumption of the urea dosing system, which is one of the main systems of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>after</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>system</b> (EATS). The main reason for selecting such a system was its independent characteristics, having its own controller known as the ACM (After treatment Control Module) and as well it is of primary interest of the Volvo system engineering group due to its new developing technology, designed for future Euro VI heavy duty engines. All the models and simulations have been implemented in MatlabÂ®/SimulinkÂ®. Moreover the models were compared and verified with measurements that were carried out at Volvo Powertrain test labs. A user friendly graphical interface was also designed as an interface between the user and the SimulinkÂ® model. The tool was designed via MatlabÂ®GUI with convenient viewing and post processing capabilities. The results show that the basic model, being a rather simple model with static simulation is sufficient for modeling the air valve, coolant valve and the hose heaters of the Urea dosing system. The accuracy of the implemented basic model structure is found to be 98 % of the real measured values.

40|$|Introduction Emission of {{particulate}} matter (PM) constitutes a big {{threat to the}} climate {{as well as to}} human health. Therefore it is necessary to apply best available practice for all diesel vehicles as one means to reduce premature death [1]. Since the Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) is viable way to reduce PM emissions the detailed understanding of the DPF is important to enable improved performance. This includes oxidation kinetics, PM transformations and the fluid dynamics for PM capture. In order to enable systematic studies of this complex process, an experimental setup (<b>Exhaust</b> <b>After</b> <b>Treatment</b> <b>System,</b> EATS) that can isolate individual phenomena has been developed [2]. The PM is prone to contain volatile hydrocarbons (HC) which will influence both the capture efficiency as well as the performance of the catalyst. In a previous study, we have shown how the HC contribution can be isolated from the solid fraction [3]. In this work we present how an open (inert) monolith placed upstream the filter can be used to remove the volatile part of the PM. By isolating the volatile part from the solid part in-situ, the hydrodynamic process of PM capture is better understood which is vital when dealing with these very complex systems. Materials and Methods The EATS was used to study the PM from a single cylinder Heavy Duty diesel engine and the Capture efficiency (CE) over a novel metal substrate [4]. The temperature and linear velocity was systematically varied in combination with the effect of the inert monolith placed upstream. The particle size distribution (PSD) was measured using a Fast Particle sizer (DMS 500 from Cambustion) at different positions. Results and Discussion By applying the methodology developed earlier [3] the HC fraction of the PM could be determined. The difference between observed CE and theoretical CE is used to derive how much HC is needed to explain the capture efficiency over the inert monolith (for validation, see [5]). The PM exiting the inert monolith has no remaining volatiles [6] and the capture efficiency over the metal substrate in thus possible. From the Capture efficiencies in Figure 1, {{it can be seen that}} the CE over the inert monolith is influenced by HC content. The CE over the metal substrate is similar to previous studies on similar geometries [7]. Conclusions By applying an experimental methodology adapted for the highly transformative PM, the systematic study of CE over a novel metal substrate is enabled. These types of experiments are necessary to gain the understanding of the different processes in a DPF. By a detailed understanding improved performance and lowered emissions are possible...|$|E
40|$|The {{continually}} growing demands {{over the}} quality of the environment, followed by the progressive legislation aimed at controlling pollutants, have created a need for a further development of the engine design and the <b>exhaust</b> gas <b>after</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>systems</b> as well. In order to achieve extensive reduction of the pollutants and appropriate engine performance, an optimization of an ethanol fueled version of the Volvo TD 73 diesel engine was performed based on a computerized analysis of measured engine parameters. A back pressure regulator (ATR) is mounted on the turbocharger outlet; therefore the engine was forced to work against a back pressure, particularly at light loads where the emission levels are expected to be undesirable. Hence, by reducing air intake, an increase of cylinder gas temperature was certainly expected and a continuous decline in emissions with increase of back pressure was obtained. Furthermore, the effect of a by-pass valve, installed between intercooler and intake manifold, on emission levels were investigated and optimized. Oxidation catalysts effects on regulated emissions, especially unburned fuel, carbon monoxide and unregulated emissions such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acetic acid were investigated. In correlation with the back pressure regulator, a promoting faster catalyst Warm-up was achieved, and their conversion efficiencies were improved. In order to gain more extensive information to base specification of the engine emissions and catalyst selection, different test cycles such as European R 49 - 13 mode, steady state adoption of the Braunschweig cycle, 24 specific steps cycle, as well as conditioning, activating and transient cycles were used. As a result it has been found that the performance of ethanol engine version was mentained and the significant emissions, well below the goal, were achieve...|$|R
40|$|Compression ignited (CI) engines, {{commonly}} known as diesel engines, are widely used power sources with complex emissions used in on-road and nonroad applications. To find out the impact of diesel exhaust emissions on health and the environment, both regulated and unregulated exhaust gas properties have to be evaluated. Especially, emissions obtained with new fuels and new exhaust gas aftertreatments have to be examined properly to avoid an increased impact of emissions of harmful substances. This thesis deals with {{the issue in the}} following papers: In Paper I, a mixture of acetal and diesel has been investigated in a 9 - liter Scania diesel engine. A marked decrease in particle number emissions and the estimated particle mass was obtained when acetal was blended into regular Swedish diesel fuel. A small penalty in engine power was observed, but the net effect was, nevertheless, a reduction in the emission of carbon dioxide per ESC cycle. Emissions of HC, CO, NOX, some aldehydes and hydrocarbons were only slightly affected by the new fuel composition. An exception was the emission of acetaldehyde, which was almost quadrupled, probably reflecting the decomposition and oxidation of acetal to acetaldehyde. In Papers II-IV, the potential to obtain low emissions of particles and NOX from a CI engine, running on ethanol and equipped with exhaust gas recirculation, EGR, catalyst and diesel particle filter, DPF, are investigated. Results obtained from a CI engine running on ethanol with the ignition improver Beraid were compared with results from a CI engine running on diesel. Both engines were 9 -liter Scania CI engines from the same engine family. Paper II covers differences originating from the fuel, together with effects from EGR, catalyst and the DPF. It was concluded that the emission control system shows a large potential for reducing particles and NOx and that these features could probably be further improved if the system is optimized for the ethanol fuelled CI engine. In paper III, the fuels influence on various particle properties was investigated, e. g., particle size and distribution, particle shape, composition and morphology. It was shown that the ethanol fuelled CI engine emitted lower particle mass, particles of smaller sizes and approx. the same or greater number emissions than the diesel fuelled engine. It was also revealed that the solid particles emitted from the ethanol engine are composed mainly of carbon and that the carbon has the same crystallite structure as carbon particles emitted from engines running on diesel. Furthermore, it was also confirmed that agglomerated particles were dependent upon speed, fuel and emission control. The purpose of Paper IV was to investigate the fuels as well as the influence of EGR, the catalyst and DPF on four specific aldehydes and 14 individual hydrocarbons. There were both quantitative and qualitative differences between the emitted compounds from the engines running on ethanol and diesel fuel, respectively. The emissions of aldehydes decreased between 56 % and 95 % when the ethanol fuelled CI engine was equipped with exhaust gas aftertreatment. The corresponding decrease for the diesel fuelled CI engine was between 74 % and 94 %. The summarized levels of analyzed emitted hydrocarbons were higher for the diesel fuelled engine compared to the levels emitted from the ethanol fuelled engine. However, the reduction, when connecting the <b>exhaust</b> gas <b>after</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>system</b> to diesel fuelled CI engine was larger, 90 %, than the 47 % reduction obtained when the system was connected to the ethanol fuelled CI engine. The exhaust gas aftertreatment system worked more effectively when coupled to the diesel engine. A general conclusion, therefore, is that {{it should be possible to}} adjust this system better to reach lower emission levels for the ethanol fuelled CI engine. Paper V describes how the ethanol fuelled CI engine in Papers II-IV was optimized with different EGR scenarios and tested, both according to stationary (ESC) and transient conditions (ETC). A second DPF was also tested together with an oxidation catalyst. Particles were clearly affected by the EGR settings and the tested exhaust gas aftertreatment. In fact, when the DPF was used, particulate emissions were lower than stipulated for onâ€“road regulations, Euro V and EEV. An efficient reduction of NOX emission levels was obtained by applying EGR; depending on exhaust gas aftertreatment, setting and test cycle used, the reductions of NOX were between 73 % and 33 %. Unfortunately, the high reduction of NOX was followed by a concomitant increase of CO, HC and particulate matter, PM, together with fuel penalty. The remedy for the higher emission levels of HC, CO and PM was an oxidation catalyst and a DPF. A humid air motor system (HAM) for reduction of NOX was investigated in paper VI. Earlier studies have demonstrated that the system has a capacity to lower NOX emissions from heavy duty diesel fuelled CI engines. The study aimed to investigate the HAM systemÂ´s influence on the emissions of particles, which generally increased, contrary to aldehyde emissions, which decreased and also to monitor essential engine parameters, water consumption, and also to verify the reducing ability. The NOX reduction capability was verified to be 51 % without any optimization. The complex nature of exhaust gas makes it impossible to analyze all properties of the exhaust. The work in this thesis has been focused on particles, particle properties and emissions of unregulated compounds, in order to elucidate aspects exhaust of other than the one obtained when measuring regulated emissions.

40|$|The use of {{hydrogen}} as an engine fuel poses several challenges {{as well as}} opportunities in engine design and control. These challenges are mainly due to hydrogen 2 Ì† 7 s high flame temperatures at near stoichiometric mixtures, {{as well as the}} reactant volume fraction which can reduce the engine power output significantly. However, the wide flammability limits {{of hydrogen}} combustion in air means that {{a large part of the}} engine operation regime can be achieved without the use of the engine throttle or <b>exhaust</b> <b>after</b> <b>treatment.</b> This paper presents results of experiments and computations for a research single cylinder pressure boosted hydrogen fuelled internal combustion engine (H 2 ICE) fitted with the Hydrogen Assisted Jet Ignition system (HAJI) and running extremely lean mixtures...|$|R

Pt/Al 2 O 3 is often used as a model Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (DOC) that plays an important role to facilitate oxidation of NO to NO 2. In the present study, we proposed a detailed kinetic model of NO oxidation as well as low temperature C 3 H 6 inhibition to simulate temperatureprogrammed reaction (TPR) data for NO oxidation over Pt/Al 2 O 3. A steady-state microkinetic model based on Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism for NO oxidation was proposed. In addition, low temperature C 3 H 6 inhibition was proposed as a result of site blocking as well as surface nitrite consumption. The model can explain the experimental data well over the studied temperature range...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the impact of}} two <b>exhaust</b> <b>after</b> <b>treatment</b> devices, an oxidation catalytic converter and a diesel particulate filter, on the particulate emissions of a heavy-duty diesel engine, the emphasis being on diesel particulate composition and size distribution. The analysis showed that the catalytic converter did not alter the size distribution significantly, except for an increased production of nanosized particles below 30 n miles in mean diameter. On the other hand, the ceramic monolith wall flow filter reduced the emitted particle number up to 100 times. The results again indicated that a diesel particulate filter can also {{increase the number of}} nanosized particles. Further investigations, however, revealed that the formation of nanosized particles downstream of the oxidation catalytic converters and diesel particulate filters, respectively, is biased by inadequate sampling conditions. As long as realistic sampling conditions are applied, both catalyst and filter reduce particle emissions over the entire size range...|$|R

Ethanol is an attractive alternative fuel because t is renewable, bio-diesel and is oxygenated thereby providing the potential for the reduction of particulate emission in compression-ignition engines. The effect of ethanol addition on engine performance were evaluated using single cylinder, four stroke, direct injection, Air cooled diesel engine. The experiments were designed to study the effect of their reducing ethanol blended fuel by increasing the fuel temperature and thereby eliminating its effect on combustion and emission characteristics of the engine. The acquired data were analysed for various parameters such as break thermal efficiency, Break specific fuel consumption, break specific energy consumption, exhaust gas temperature. Emission parameters viz. HC, CO, CO 2 and Unburned hydrocarbon are also tabulated. The performance parameters were marginally inferior but the emission is significantly reduced as the blend ratio is increased...|$|R
40|$|Diesel {{vehicles}} emit harmful soot particles. Soot can {{be removed}} effectively by <b>after</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>systems,</b> consisting of a particle filter and an oxidation catalyst. The filter removes soot particles, which are quasi-permanently burned using NO 2, which is produced from motor NO in the oxidation catalyst. Unfortunately, SO 2 is also oxidized to SO 3, which results from the combustion of sulphur consisting fuels. SO 3 reacts with water vapour to sulphuric acid. Due to its small vapour pressure gaseous H 2 SO 4 can form nano particles by homogeneous nucleation with water vapour. Nano particles can intrude the lung and hence could be very harmful. Within the present work H 2 SO 4 was measured by chemical ionisation mass spectrometry in the exhaust of a diesel engine. The formation of sulphuric acid in catalytic <b>after</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>systems</b> was verified and it was figured out, that the actual concentration in the exhaust is strongly influenced by store and release effects. Simultaneously measured aerosol particles show a correlation between the formation and growth of volatile nucleation particles and gaseous H 2 SO 4. In addition a number of organic acids could be detected, {{some of which may}} also involved in nucleation processes...|$|R
40|$|Vehicle {{emission}} {{emissions are}} one of the main contributors to the air pollution in Hong Kong. Back in 1997, the exhaust from diesel vehicles accounted for almost all the particulates and 75 % of the nitrogen oxides emissions. Since then, Hong Kong Environmental Protection Department (HKEPD) has implemented a set of control measures to abate vehicle emissions. This paper presents the progress of implementation one of our control measures, the retrofitting of in-use diesel vehicles to reduce particulate emission. Dating back from the background preparation work in early 1990 s in the testing of diesel oxidation catalyst with the buses to our recent trials for both light and heavy duty in-use diesels, we have worked closely with the motor trade to solve the application issues of <b>exhaust</b> <b>after</b> <b>treatment</b> technology. Since year 2000, we have launched the large scale retrofitting program for both light and heavy duty pre- 1995 diesels. The in-use diesels retrofitting program is one of our significant control measures that help us to meet the target of reducing particulate and nitrogen oxides emissions from vehicles by about 80 % and 30 % respectively by 2005...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the {{application}} of lean homogeneous combustion in SI engines using a passive SCR <b>after</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>system.</b> By implementing this concept a decrease in fuel consumption and engine out NOx is expected. The data and results are obtained through engine experiments. Under lean conditions the ignition system faces harder conditions, in order to reliably ignite a lean fuel/air mixture an advanced ignition system is necessary. A literature study revealed that among, standard ignition, dual coil ignition, laser ignition, corona ignition and pre-chamber ignition the pre-chamber ignition system was capable of igniting the highest diluted mixture. The corona system however was second best and {{does not require a}} modification to the engine. The dual coil ignition system was installed on a multi-cylinder engine. This system uses a standard spark plug but by firing two coils in consecutive order a long duration spark is created. By applying this system and optimizing the timing of the existing adjustable cam shafts for lean conditions, substantial decreases in fuel consumption and NOx were achieved. Another part of this thesis {{is about the}} <b>after</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>system.</b> An ammonia formation catalyst produces ammonia under rich engine conditions and stores it. The ammonia in its turn reacts with NOx when the engine operates lean. The ammonia formation catalyst was tested under lab-scale and real engine conditions. It was shown that taken the differences in set-up into account the lab-scale tested catalysts showed good similarities with the engine-scale tests...|$|R
