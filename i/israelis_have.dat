25|$|Some of al-Qaradawi's views, {{such as his}} condoning of Palestinian {{suicide bombings}} against <b>Israelis,</b> <b>have</b> caused {{reactions}} from governments in the West: he was refused an entry visa to the United Kingdom in 2008, and barred from entering France in 2012.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the latest}} round of peace talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, 13 Palestinian militant {{movements}} led by Hamas initiated a terror campaign designed to derail and disrupt the negotiations. Attacks on <b>Israelis</b> <b>have</b> increased since August 2010, after 4 Israeli civilians were killed by Hamas militants.|$|E
25|$|Many Palestinians {{believe the}} status quo is {{threatened}} since right-wing <b>Israelis</b> <b>have</b> been challenging it with more force and frequency, asserting a religious right to pray there. Until Israel banned them, members of Murabitat, a group of women, cried 'Allah Akbar' at groups of Jewish visitors to remind them the Temple Mount was still in Muslim hands.|$|E

25|$|It {{has also}} been {{described}} variously {{as a form of}} traditional popular protest guerrilla tactic or action, as a form of violent activism, or mode of civil disobedience which came to prominence during the First Intifada. At least 14 <b>Israelis</b> <b>have</b> been killed by Palestinian stone throwing, including 3 Arabs mistaken for Jews.

25|$|Because {{of these}} factors, {{performances}} of Wagner's {{works in the}} modern state of Israel did not occur during the twentieth century, by consensus.

A public performance in Tel Aviv in 2001 of Wagner’s prelude to Tristan und Isolde, conducted as an unprogrammed encore by Daniel Barenboim, left its audience partly delighted, partly enraged.|$|E

25|$|According to {{demographer}} Pini Herman, this {{circular migration}} {{has been an}} economic boon to Israel. Israel {{does not have the}} technological, academic, and other infrastructural resources to absorb its disproportionate number of highly trained and skilled population, second only to the United States. As a result, many <b>Israelis</b> <b>have</b> worked overseas for extended periods of time. Upon their return, they have often attracted or repatriated with them to Israel new infrastructure, such as that provided by companies like as Intel, Google, Microsoft, and IBM.|$|E

25|$|A {{major feature}} of the tours is a 5- to 10-day mifgash (Hebrew for 'encounter') with Israeli peers, usually {{soldiers}} serving in the Israel Defense Forces, who join the tour. The stated purpose for the mifgash is for the participants and the soldiers {{to get to know}} each other and to better understand each other's world view and Jewish identity. Guided discussion sessions explore topics such as the Jewish tradition in the modern world, how Jewish life in Israel differs from Jewish life abroad, and how mandatory military service impacts young Israelis' perceptions of service and commitment to their country. More than 65,000 <b>Israelis</b> <b>have</b> participated in the program since 2000.|$|E
25|$|Active {{immigration}} and asylum politics in West Berlin triggered waves of immigration in the 1960s and 1970s. Currently, Berlin {{is home to}} about 200,000 Turks, making it the largest Turkish community outside of Turkey. In the 1990s the Aussiedlergesetze enabled immigration to Germany of some residents from the former Soviet Union. Today ethnic Germans from countries of the former Soviet Union make up the largest portion of the Russian-speaking community. The last decade experienced an influx from various Western countries and some African regions. A portion of the African immigrants have settled in the Afrikanisches Viertel. Young Germans, EU-Europeans and <b>Israelis</b> <b>have</b> also settled in the city.|$|E
25|$|Sahih Muslim and Sahih Bukhari record various recensions of a hadith where Muhammad had prophesised {{that the}} Day of Judgment {{will not come}} until Muslims and Jews fight each other. The Muslims will kill the Jews with such success that they will then hide behind stones or both trees and stones {{according}} to various recensions, which will then cry out to a Muslim that a Jew is hiding behind them {{and ask them to}} kill him. The only one not to do so will be the Gharqad tree as it is the tree of the Jews. Different interpretations about the Gharqad tree mentioned in the Hadith exists. One of the interpretations is that the Gharqad tree is an actual tree. <b>Israelis</b> <b>have</b> been alleged to plant the tree around various locations for e.g., their settlements in West Bank and Gaza, around Israel Museum and the Knesset. Other claims about the tree are that it grows outside Herod's Gate or that it is actually a bush that grows outside Jaffa Gate which some Muslims believe where Jesus will return to Earth and slay the Dajjal, following the final battle between the Muslims and unbelievers which some believe will take place directly below the Jaffa Gate below the Sultan's Pool. Another interpretation that exists is that the mention of the Gharqad tree is symbolic and is in reference to all the forces of the world believed to conspire with the Jews against Muslims.|$|E
50|$|A {{month after}} 18 <b>Israelis</b> <b>had</b> {{been killed in}} two {{separate}} attacks, {{and a few days}} after a suicide bombing in Netanya killed 30 and injured 140, the Israeli Defense Forces called up 30,000 reserve soldiers and launched Operation Defensive Shield.|$|R
50|$|Israeli Defense Minister Amir Peretz ordered {{commanders to}} prepare civil defense plans. One million <b>Israelis</b> <b>had</b> to stay near or in bomb shelters or {{security}} rooms, with some 250,000 civilians evacuating {{the north and}} relocating {{to other areas of}} the country.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Israeli</b> {{government}} <b>had</b> previously {{dismissed as}} propaganda, Palestinian charges that <b>Israeli</b> forces <b>had</b> used indiscriminate and disproportionate firepower in civilian areas during the ground assault.

500|$|The film {{performed}} poorly with Israeli audiences {{despite the}} positive reaction in other areas. Riklis {{has said that}} <b>Israelis</b> <b>have</b> the [...] "false impression" [...] that the film is pro-Palestinian and polemical. The Palestinian reaction has been very positive, according to Riklis. He expected a far more positive reception in Israel given {{the success of his}} previous film, The Syrian Bride, in 2004. The film did receive praise from Hannah Brown of The Jerusalem Post, who stated that [...] "it's hard to ask for more" [...] and [...] "you will leave the theater craving a glass of the lemonade Salma prepares so lovingly in several scenes". Haaretz also praised the movie before its release.|$|E
2500|$|Goldstone added: [...] "That {{comparatively}} few <b>Israelis</b> <b>have</b> {{been killed}} by the unlawful rocket and mortar attacks from Gaza in no way minimizes the criminality. The U.N. Human Rights Council should condemn these heinous acts in the strongest terms." ...|$|E
2500|$|Other <b>Israelis</b> <b>have</b> {{mentioned}} {{concerns about}} the PASF abusing {{human rights and the}} possibility of the Palestinian Territories becoming a police state.

50|$|By {{the end of}} the war, the <b>Israelis</b> <b>had</b> {{advanced}} to positions some 101 kilometres from Egypt's capital, Cairo, and occupied 1,600 square kilometres west of the Suez Canal. They had also cut the Cairo-Suez road and encircled the bulk of Egypt's Third Army. The <b>Israelis</b> <b>had</b> also taken many prisoners after Egyptian soldiers, including many officers, began surrendering in masses towards {{the end of the}} war. The Egyptians held a narrow strip on the east bank of the canal, occupying some 1,200 square kilometres of the Sinai. One source estimated that the Egyptians had 70,000 men, 720 tanks and 994 artillery pieces on the east bank of the canal. However, 30,000 to 45,000 of them were now encircled by the Israelis.|$|R
