5|$|After {{his success}} at Chancellorsville in Virginia in May 1863, Lee led <b>his</b> <b>army</b> through the Shenandoah Valley {{to begin his}} second {{invasion}} of the North—the Gettysburg Campaign. With <b>his</b> <b>army</b> in high spirits, Lee intended to shift {{the focus of the}} summer campaign from war-ravaged northern Virginia and hoped to influence Northern politicians to give up their prosecution of the war by penetrating as far as Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, or even Philadelphia. Prodded by President Abraham Lincoln, Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker moved <b>his</b> <b>army</b> in pursuit, but was relieved of command just three days before the battle and replaced by Meade.|$|E

While Beneventum was indecisive, Pyrrhus realised <b>his</b> <b>army</b> had been exhausted and reduced by years of foreign campaigns. Seeing little hope for further gains, he withdrew completely from Italy.|$|E
