It is called a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> and is the method currently used for a clinical diagnosis.

25|$|People with {{untreated}} {{celiac disease}} often present sorbitol malabsorption, {{as a result}} of the small bowel damage. Sorbitol malabsorption is an important cause for persisting symptoms in patients already on a gluten-free diet. The sorbitol <b>hydrogen</b> <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> has been suggested as a tool to detect celiac disease because of a strict correlation between cut-off value and intestinal lesions. Nevertheless, although it may be indicated for research purposes, it is not yet recommended as a diagnostic tool in clinical practice.|$|E
25|$|Fructose {{is absorbed}} in the small {{intestine}} without help of digestive enzymes. Even in healthy persons, however, only about 25–50g of fructose per sitting can be properly absorbed. People with fructose malabsorption absorb less than 25g per sitting. Simultaneous ingestion of fructose and sorbitol seems to increase malabsorption of fructose. Fructose {{that has not been}} adequately absorbed is fermented by intestinal bacteria producing hydrogen, carbon dioxide, methane and short-chain fatty acids. This abnormal increase in hydrogen may be detectable with the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>breath</b> <b>test.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract BACKGROUND: Small {{intestinal}} {{bacterial overgrowth}} and sugar malabsorption (lactose, fructose, sorbitol) {{may play a}} role in irritable bowel syndrome. The lactulose <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> is a reliable and non-invasive test for the diagnosis of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. The lactose, fructose and sorbitol <b>hydrogen</b> <b>breath</b> <b>tests</b> are widely used to detect specific sugar malabsorption. AIM: To assess the extent to which small intestinal bacterial overgrowth may influence the results of <b>hydrogen</b> sugar <b>breath</b> <b>tests</b> in irritable bowel syndrome patients. METHODS: We enrolled 98 consecutive irritable bowel syndrome patients. All subjects underwent hydrogen lactulose, lactose, fructose and sorbitol <b>hydrogen</b> <b>breath</b> <b>tests.</b> Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth patients were treated with 1 -week course of antibiotics. All tests were repeated 1 month after the end of therapy. RESULTS: A positive lactulose <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> was found in 64 of 98 (65...|$|R
40|$|About 5 % {{of normal}} {{subjects}} {{fail to produce}} increased <b>hydrogen</b> <b>breath</b> concentration after ingestion of the non-digestible carbohydrate lactulose (low hydrogen producers). The existence of low hydrogen producers limits the diagnostic use of <b>hydrogen</b> (H 2) <b>breath</b> <b>tests.</b> We studied the effects of lactulose and of magnesium sulphate (MgSO 4) pretreatment on stool-pH and on hydrogen exhalation after oral loading with lactulose or lactose in 17 hydrogen producers and 12 low hydrogen producers. In seven hydrogen producers acidification of stool pH by lactulose pretreatment (20 g tid) decreased hydrogen exhalation and three of seven (43 %) became low hydrogen producers. In contrast, after pretreatment of eight low hydrogen producers with magnesium sulphate (5 g twice daily) all eight produced hydrogen after a lactulose load. Similarly four lactose intolerant low hydrogen producers had abnormal lactose <b>hydrogen</b> <b>breath</b> <b>tests</b> after MgSO 4 pretreatment. MgSO 4 pretreatment neither resulted in false positive lactose <b>hydrogen</b> <b>breath</b> <b>tests</b> in five lactose tolerant hydrogen producers, nor increased the hydrogen exhalation in five additional hydrogen producing controls after ingestion of lactulose. The results of these studies confirm that hydrogen production from lactulose decreases when the colonic pH is lower (lactulose pretreatment), and increases when colonic pH is higher (MgSO 4 pretreatment). In low hydrogen producers the lacking increase of H 2 exhalation after ingestion of non-digestible carbohydrates can be overcome by MgSO 4 pretreatment, thus increasing {{the sensitivity of the}} test by avoiding false negative <b>hydrogen</b> <b>breath</b> <b>tests</b> in low <b>hydrogen</b> producers with disaccharide malabsorption or maldigestion. The underlying mechanism of this remarkable effect of MgSO 4 pretreatment warrants further investigation...|$|R
25|$|In a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>breath</b> <b>test,</b> {{the most}} {{accurate}} lactose intolerance test, after an overnight fast, 25 grams of lactose (in a solution with water) are swallowed. If the lactose cannot be digested, enteric bacteria metabolize it and produce hydrogen, which, along with methane, if produced, can be detected on the patient's breath by a clinical gas chromatograph or compact solid-state detector. The test takes about 2.5 hours to complete. If the hydrogen levels in the patient's breath are high, they may have lactose intolerance. This test is not usually done on babies and very young children, because it can cause severe diarrhea.|$|E
25|$|Total {{food intake}} and {{absorbance}} rate of food will rapidly decline after gastric bypass surgery, {{and the number}} of acid-producing cells lining the stomach increases. Doctors often prescribe acid-lowering medications to counteract the high acidity levels. Many patients then experience a condition known as achlorhydria, where there is not enough acid in the stomach. As a result of the low acidity levels, patients can develop an overgrowth of bacteria. A study conducted on 43 post-operative patients revealed that almost all of the patients tested positive for a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>breath</b> <b>test,</b> which indicated an overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine. Bacterial overgrowth causes the gut ecology to change and induces nausea and vomiting. Recurring nausea and vomiting eventually change the absorbance rate of food, contributing to the vitamin and nutrition deficiencies common in post-operative gastric bypass patients.|$|E

[...] Increased bacterial concentrations are also involved in the deconjugation of bile acids. [...] The glycocholic acid breath test involves the administration of the bile acid 14C glychocholic acid, and the detection of 14CO2, which would be elevated in bacterial overgrowth.|$|E

No GLUT 5 variant {{was found that}} correlated with the occurrence of fructose malabsorption. Nevertheless, an involvement of GLUT 5 in the pathophysiology of fructose malabsorption cannot be excluded since this cohort was quite small, the age of patients was very young (ranging from 8  months to 5  years, median 2.75  years) {{and half of the}} patients showed positive sucrose <b>breath</b> <b>test</b> questioning the diagnosis of isolated fructose malabsorption [4].

25|$|Diagnosis of food {{intolerance}} can include <b>hydrogen</b> <b>breath</b> <b>testing</b> for lactose intolerance and fructose malabsorption, professionally supervised elimination diets, and ELISA testing for IgG-mediated immune responses to specific foods. It {{is important to}} be able to distinguish between food allergy, {{food intolerance}}, and autoimmune disease in the management of these disorders. Non-IgE-mediated intolerance is more chronic, less acute, less obvious in its clinical presentation, and often more difficult to diagnose than allergy, as skin tests and standard immunological studies are not helpful. Elimination diets must remove all poorly tolerated foods, or all foods containing offending compounds. Clinical investigation is generally undertaken only for more serious cases, as for minor complaints which do not significantly limit the person's lifestyle the cure may be more inconvenient than the problem.|$|R

50|$|Several {{studies have}} {{measured}} the intestinal absorption of fructose using the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>breath</b> <b>test.</b> These {{studies indicate that}} fructose is not completely absorbed in the small intestine. When fructose is not absorbed in the small intestine, it is transported into the large intestine, where it is fermented by the colonic flora. Hydrogen is produced during the fermentation process and dissolves into {{the blood of the}} portal vein. This hydrogen is transported to the lungs, where it is exchanged across the lungs and is measurable by the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>breath</b> <b>test.</b> The colonic flora also produces carbon dioxide, short-chain fatty acids, organic acids, and trace gases in the presence of unabsorbed fructose. The presence of gases and organic acids in the large intestine causes gastrointestinal symptoms such as bloating, diarrhea, flatulence, and gastrointestial pain Exercise immediately after consumption can exacerbate these symptoms by decreasing transit time in the small intestine, resulting in a greater amount of fructose emptied into the large intestine.|$|E
50|$|Fructose {{is absorbed}} in the small {{intestine}} without help of digestive enzymes. Even in healthy persons, however, only about 25-50 g of fructose per sitting can be properly absorbed.

However, underlying IBS pathological factors {{may play a role}} in lactose malabsorption symptom expression. Yang et al. evaluated lactose malabsorption in adults with IBS-D and healthy adults via a randomized blinded crossover trial; both groups had the lactase non-persistence polymorphism (C/C- 13910). Subjects received doses of 10, 20, and 40  g of lactose [65]. In addition, they underwent <b>hydrogen</b> <b>breath</b> <b>testing</b> to identify lactose malabsorption, rectal barostat testing to measure visceral hypersensitivity, and ileocolonic biopsies to assess neuroimmune activation. Yang et al. found that those with an increase in gastrointestinal symptoms in response to lactose malabsorption had both increased visceral hypersensitivity and increased ileocolonic mast cells compared to both healthy controls and those with IBS who had no increase in GI symptoms following lactose malabsorption [65].|$|R
