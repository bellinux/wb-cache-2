This paper investigated the association involving profitability and corporate green <b>investment</b> <b>practices</b> in 100 South African CDP companies on the JSE.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the <b>investment</b> <b>practices</b> of life assurance firms within the United Kingdom, through {{an analysis of the}} asset holdings of the sector over the period 1900 to 1965. The data are drawn from the detailed annual returns to the Board of Trade. Aggregate, sectional and individual company data are used in the study.

The study highlights the great variation in <b>investment</b> <b>practice</b> across individual life assurance firms, with no strong evidence of convergence over time excepting investments in equity holdings. ...|$|R

40|$|Venture capital (VC) {{investment}} {{has long been}} conceptualized as a local business, in which the VC’s ability to source, syndicate, fund, monitor, and add value to portfolio firms critically depends on their access to knowledge obtained through their ties to the local (i. e., geographically proximate) network. Consistent with the view that local networks matter, existing research confirms that local and geographically distant portfolio firms are sourced, syndicated, funded, and monitored differently. Curiously, emerging research on VC <b>investment</b> <b>practice</b> within the United States finds that distant investments, as measured by “exits” (either initial public offering or merger & acquisition) out-perform local investments. These findings raise important questions about the assumed benefits of local network membership and proximity. To more deeply probe these questions, we contrast the deal structure of cross-border VC investment with domestic VC investment, and contrast the deal structure of cross-border VC investments that include a local partner with those that do not. Evidence from 139, 892 rounds of venture capital financing in the period 1980 - 2009 suggests that cross-border <b>investment</b> <b>practice,</b> in terms of deal sourcing, syndication, and performance indeed change with proximity, but that monitoring practices do not. Further, {{we find that the}} inclusion of a local partner in the investment syndicate yields surprisingly few benefits. This evidence, we argue, raises important questions about VC <b>investment</b> <b>practice</b> as well as the ability of firms to capture and lever the presumed benefits of network membership...|$|R
