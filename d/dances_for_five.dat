5000|$|The July 25, 1908, {{edition of}} Billboard {{magazine}} reported the following story how the Yama song originated. When The Three Twins was rehearsing in Chicago, prior to first opening, Karl Hoschna, the composer, {{was asked to}} furnish a [...] "pajama man song". He wrote one called The Pajama Man only to learn {{that it could not}} be used owing to another pajama number booked at the Whitney Opera House the next day. Gus Sohlke, the stage director, happened to pass a toy store and saw in the window a doll built out of triangles. Realizing that this had never been used in stage work he decided to have a triangular man chorus in place of The Pajama Man. That afternoon as he, Collin Davis and Hoschna sat together wondering what they would call the song, Sohlke kept repeating Pajama jama yama yama. Suddenly he brightened up and cried [...] "Did either of you fellows ever hear of a Yama Yama Man?" [...] Of course neither one had and Sohlke confirmed [...] "Neither have I! Lets call the new song Yama Yama Man".

500|$|In 1955 Robinson {{returned}} to the ring.

Robinson even stated that the training he did in his attempts to establish a career as a dancer were harder than any he undertook during his boxing career. He won five fights in 1955, before losing a decision to Ralph 'Tiger' Jones. He bounced back, however, and defeated Rocky Castellani by a split decision, then challenged Bobo Olson for the world middleweight title. He won the middleweight championship for the third time via a second-round knockout—his third victory over Olson. After his comeback performance in 1955, Robinson expected to be named fighter of the year. However, the title went to welterweight Carmen Basilio. Basilio's handlers had lobbied heavily for it on the basis that he had never won the award, and Robinson later described this as the biggest disappointment of his professional career. [...] "I haven't forgotten it to this day, and I never will", Robinson wrote in his autobiography. They fought for the last time in 1956, and Robinson closed the four fight series with a fourth-round knockout.|$|R
