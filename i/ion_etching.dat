25|$|<b>Ion</b> <b>etching</b> is a {{sputtering}} {{process that}} can remove very fine quantities of material. This is used to perform a finishing polish of specimens polished by other means. <b>Ion</b> <b>etching</b> uses an inert gas passed through an electric field to generate a plasma stream that is directed to the sample surface. Acceleration energies for gases such as argon are typically a few kilovolts. The sample may be rotated to promote even polishing of the sample surface. The sputtering rate of such methods is {{on the order of}} tens of micrometers per hour, limiting the method to only extremely fine polishing.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ion</b> <b>etching</b> by argon gas {{has been}} {{recently}} {{shown to be}} able to file down MTJ stack structures to a specific layer which has then been atomically resolved. The TEM images taken in plan view rather than cross-section reveal that the MgO layer within MTJs contains a large number of grain boundaries that may be diminishing the properties of devices.|$|E
25|$|Mechanical {{polishing}} is {{also used}} to prepare samples for imaging on the TEM. Polishing {{needs to be done to}} a high quality, to ensure constant sample thickness across the region of interest. A diamond, or cubic boron nitride polishing compound may be used in the final stages of polishing to remove any scratches that may cause contrast fluctuations due to varying sample thickness. Even after careful mechanical milling, additional fine methods such as <b>ion</b> <b>etching</b> may be required to perform final stage thinning.|$|E
30|$|Solid-state {{nanopore}} {{first was}} fabricated with <b>ion</b> track <b>etching.</b> <b>Ion</b> track <b>etching</b> used etchant to etch the film, which was irradiated by heavy <b>ion.</b> The <b>etching</b> {{rate of the}} track region is {{greater than that of}} the non-track region (vtrack > vbulk), which result in the form of pore. This method has successfully fabricated solid-state nanopore in relatively inexpensive materials such as polycarbonate, polyimide, and silicon nitride. Zhang et al. [32] has fabricated silicon nitride nanopore by this method with high-energy Br+ (81  MeV). The diameter of this nanopore was relatively large, and the minimum nanopore diameter obtained was 40  nm after the process of shrinkage. At present, Harrell et al. [18] have fabricated the solid-state nanopore with the diameter of 2  nm by <b>ion</b> track <b>etching,</b> after the diameter was shrunk by the deposition of nanogold thin films. However, the solid-state nanopore prepared by the ion-channel etching method has a small porosity and an uneven pore size distribution. Meanwhile, this method requires expensive heavy ion accelerometer and restricts the fabrication and application of the solid-state nanopore severely.|$|R

40|$|Effects of {{the oxygen}} <b>ion</b> beam <b>etching</b> of <b>ion</b> beam {{synthesized}} {{diamond like carbon}} (DLC) films were investigated in present study. The etching rates as well as contact angle with water and surface morphology {{before and after the}} oxygen ion beam treatment were studied. “Conventional ” hydrogenated diamond like carbon (DLC) films were synthesized from acetylene gas, while silicon and SiOx doped DLC films were deposited from hexamethyldisiloxane vapor and acetylene gas mixture, and hexamethyldisiloxane vapor and hydrogen gas mixture respectively. In all cases <b>ion</b> beam <b>etching</b> resulted in flat smooth surfaces. Etching rate of the “conventional ” DLC films synthesized from acetylene and DLC films deposited from hexamethyldisiloxane vapor and acetylene gas mixture was 44 nm/min and 29 nm/min respectively. Thickness of the SiOx doped DLC film synthesized from hexamethyldisiloxane vapor and acetylene gas mixture slightly increased {{as a result of the}} oxygen ion beam treatment. Contact angle with water of the DLC films synthesized from acetylene after the <b>ion</b> beam <b>etching</b> remained the same. While contact angle of the diamond-like carbon films deposited from hexamethyldisiloxane vapor and acetylene gas mixture decreased from 68 ° to 55 °. Contact angle with water of SiOx doped DLC films after the oxygen ion beam treatment was similar to the contact angle with water of the silicon dioxide. Observed results were explained by different etching rates of the different carbon and hydrocarbon fractures as well as by competition between two processes: <b>ion</b> beam <b>etching</b> and oxidation of the Si and SiOx...|$|R
