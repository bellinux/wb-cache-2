40|$|<b>Fensulfothion</b> (O,O-diethyl O-[4 -(methylsulfinyl) phenyl]phosphorothioate), an organophosphorus {{pesticide}} {{used to control}} the golden nematode Heterodera rostochiensis, {{is used as a}} source of carbon by microorganisms isolated from soils treated with the pesticide. Two of the microbial isolates, Pseudomonas alcaligenes C 1 and Alcaligenes sp. strain NC 3, used more than 80 % of the pesticide in 120 h in culture when supplemented as a source of carbon. P. alcaligenes C 1, which showed maximal growth on <b>fensulfothion,</b> degraded the compound to p-methylsulfinyl phenol and diethyl phosphorothioic acid. The phenolic metabolite could be identified by conventional spectral analysis, whereas the spectral patterns of the phosphorus-containing metabolite suggested that the compound was complexed with some cellular molecules. However, utilization of the phosphoric acid ester and ethanol by P. alcaligenes C 1 suggested that the microbe attacks <b>fensulfothion</b> by an initial hydrolysis of the compound and subsequent utilization of the phosphoric acid ester.

40|$|Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) from Pisum sativum {{purified}} 28 fold showed two closely moving protein bands on {{polyacrylamide gel}} electrophoresis, {{both of which}} have AChE activity. AChE activity occurs in roots, stem and leaves, that in roots varying with age. Activity is optimal at pH 9 and at 30 ”. The energy of activation is 9. 82 x lo 3 J per mol and MW is greater than 200000. Although the enzyme can hydrolyze both choline and non-choline esters, it has greater affinity for acetylthiocholine (ATCh) and acetylcholine (ACh). ATCh inhibits the enzyme at higher concentrations and the K, is 0. 2 mM with this as substrate. The enzyme is not as sensitive to Eserine as it is to Neostigmine. It is also inhibited by organophosphorus pesticides such as <b>Fensulfothion,</b> Parathion and Dimethoate. Treatment of the seeds with <b>Fensulfothion</b> [O, O-diethyl (p-methylsulfinylphenyl) phosphorothioate] affects growth and secondary root development.

40|$|The Environmental Protection Agency {{evaluates the}} risk of {{granular}} pesticides to birds using an LD 50 s/ft 2 -risk index. The index does not include avian response to granular characteristics, pesticide load per granule, or weather conditions, and it assumes that avian risk increases as granule availability increases. <b>Fensulfothion</b> was formulated on granular pesticide carriers to evaluate the effects of carrier type (silica, clay, and corncob), pesticide load per granule (1 / 2, 1 / 8, and 1 / 32 of the LD 50), granule color (blue, white, and uncolored), and granule size (large and small) on captive house sparrows (Passer domesticus). In the initial experiments, silica and clay granules posed a greater risk to the birds than did corncob granules, and the risk from the granular pesticide decreased as the pesticide load per granule decreased. Findings regarding granular size and color were inconclusive. Carrier type was further evaluated by offering formulations on the three granular carriers to house sparrows that were given less food than the birds in the first evaluations. In this instance, corncob granules posed a greater risk to the birds than did clay or silica granules. When house sparrows were offered silica, clay, and corncob granules (formulated with <b>fensulfothion)</b> on dry or wet soil, the granular carriers on dry soil posed the greater risk to birds. Wet soil significantly reduced the risk to the birds from corncob and silica granules, whereas the risk from clay granules was not significantly reduced on wet soil. Captive house sparrows were offered silica granules formulated with <b>fensulfothion</b> at 1 / 2 the LD 50 per granule at application rates of 50, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1200, 1600, or 2000 LD 50 s/ft 2. A significant negative correlation between brain ChE activity and the natural logarithm of application rate indicated {{that the relationship between}} avian risk and granule availability was asymptotic rather than linear. The information now available regarding avian response to pesticide granules as a source of grit should be included in risk assessment models to increase the accuracy of predicting avian exposure. This information also could be used to design granular pesticide formulations less hazardous to birds...|$|E

40|$|The {{oxidative}} burst is a rapid, localized plant defense response. It involves {{the production of}} millimolar quantities of O 2 -·/H 2 O 2 that serves both as a microbicidal agent and a second messenger within the plant. The focus {{of this research is}} to elucidate the signal transduction pathways that control this plant defense response. ^ To achieve this goal, we have taken a three pronged approach: (1) to identify chemically pure elicitors of the {{oxidative burst}}, (2) to elucidate the second messengers by which the various elicitors operate, and (3) study desensitization among the various elicitor induced bursts. ^ Previously, oligogalacturonic acid, a cell wall component, and a glycoprotein from the fungus Verticillium dahliae had been shown to be elicitors of the oxidative burst. I have continued this work and shown that harpin, a protein from Erwinia amylovora, <b>fensulfothion,</b> an organophosphorous insecticide and hypo-osmotic stress are also potent inducers of the burst. I have also identified several second messengers involved in these elicitor induced bursts, including activation of phospholipase A, changes in protein phosphorylation and Ca 2 + fluxes. Finally, I have examined both homologous and heterologous desensitization amongst the various elicitor induced bursts. ^ This study has helped to identify signaling events that control this important plant defense response. ...|$|E
40|$|Leaves {{of tomato}} cultivars that contain the Pto {{bacterial}} resistance locus develop small necrotic lesions within 24 hr after exposure to fenthion, an organophosphorous insecticide. Recently, the Pto gene was isolated and {{shown to be}} a putative serine/threonine protein kinase. Pto is one member of a multigene family that is clustered within a 400 -kb region on chromosome 5. Here, we report that another member of this gene family, termed Fen, is responsible for the sensitivity to fenthion. Fen was isolated by map-based cloning using closely linked DNA markers to identify a yeast artificial chromosome clone that spanned the Pto region. After transformation with the Fen gene under control of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35 S promoter, tomato plants that are normally insensitive to fenthion rapidly developed extensive necrotic lesions upon exposure to fenthion. Two related insecticides, <b>fensulfothion</b> and fenitrothion, also elicited necrotic lesions specifically on Fen-transformed plants. Transgenic tomato plants harboring integrated copies of the Pto gene under control of the CaMV 35 S promoter displayed sensitivity to fenthion but to a lesser extent than did wild-type fenthion-sensitive plants. The Fen protein shares 80 % identity (87 % similarity) with Pto but does not confer resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato. These results suggest that Pto and Fen participate in the same signal transduction pathway...|$|E

40|$|The soil {{fumigant}} 1, 3 -dichloropropene gave good to excellent {{control of the}} Columbia root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne chitwoodi, on potato, Solanum tuberosum L. Nonfumigant nematicides (aldicarb, <b>fensulfothion,</b> carbofuran, ethoprop, and phenamiphos) were less effective in controlling M. chitwoodi, since the nematode affects tuber quality more than quantity.

There were positive linear correlations between degree-days and infected and galled tubers (r = 0. 92), degree-days and nematode generations (r = 1. 00), and infected and galled tubers and nematode generations (r = 0. 91). Differences in degree-days and resultant nematode reproduction caused great variability in infection and galling of potato tubers during four growing seasons: 89 % for 1979, 0 % for 1980, 13 % for 1981, and 18 % for 1982, giving positive linear correlation (r = 0. 99) between final nematode soil population (Pf) and percentage of infected and galled tubers.
