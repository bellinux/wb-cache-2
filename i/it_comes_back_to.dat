500|$|Bond is sent by M to {{investigate}} a drug-smuggling operation based in Italy that is sending narcotics to England. M instructs Bond {{to get in touch}} with a CIA informant, Kristatos, who in turn tells Bond that a man named Enrico Colombo is behind the racket. When Bond sets out to find more information on Colombo, he is captured and brought aboard Colombo's ship, the Colombina. Colombo informs Bond that Kristatos is actually the one in charge of the drug smuggling operation, and that Kristatos is backed by the Russians. Colombo agrees to help Bond by providing information about things [...] "as long as none of <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Italy"; Bond agrees to help Colombo eliminate Kristatos. Bond, Colombo, and his men sail the Colombina to Santa Maria where they find Kristatos's ship at dock and his men unloading a cargo of drugs into a warehouse. [...] They attack Kristatos's operation and Bond discovers Kristatos lurking behind the warehouse, preparing to detonate a bomb to kill Colombo. Kristatos tries to escape, but Bond kills him.|$|E
2500|$|According to Yorke, [...] "Creep" [...] {{tells the}} tale of an inebriated man who tries to get the {{attention}} of a woman to whom he is attracted by following her around. In the end, he lacks the self-confidence to face her and feels he subconsciously is her. When asked about [...] "Creep" [...] in 1993, Yorke said: [...] "I have a real problem being a man in the '90s... Any man with any sensitivity or conscience toward the opposite sex would have a problem. To actually assert yourself in a masculine way without looking like you're in a hard-rock band is a very difficult thing to do... <b>It</b> <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the music we write, which is not effeminate, but it's not brutal in its arrogance. It is one of the things I'm always trying: To assert a sexual persona and on the other hand trying desperately to negate it." [...] Jonny Greenwood said the song was in fact a happy song about [...] "recognizing what you are".|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no!" [...] I cried eagerly, {{putting in}} my share now; for I had {{a part in}} the history. [...] "He WASN'T alone, Jack, though you thought him so at the time. I {{remember}} all, at last. <b>It</b> <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> me like a flash. Oh, heavens, how <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> me! Jack, Jack, I remember to-day every word, every syllable of it!" ...|$|E

60|$|But the new thought {{remained}} in his mind. <b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> him at intervals, seeming less new and startling every time.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Of course!' he cried. 'Sink me, if I could {{remember}} where I had seen your face, but now <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> me very clearly.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... [*--On re-reading {{this history}} <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{me that she}} [...] {{was the mother of}} M'tonga, who was much younger than [...] Umbelazi. --A. Q.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, or {{at least}} some people can. It is a curious thing, Miss Clifford, but as it happens I have met your father. You always {{reminded}} me of the man, but I had forgotten his name. Now <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> me; it was Clifford." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I didn't {{know you}} were ever timid. How can you be, in your profession? Doesn't <b>it</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> me, for that matter, that--only the other year--you painted her?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I seem to {{recollect}} that I was mighty sleepy once. <b>It</b> <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> me that I {{wanted to}} say something to the driver and that I couldn't make him heed me. I guess it was the heat, but I felt swimmy for a moment. That's all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was there}} all the time, Jack," [...] I cried, in a fever of exaltation: [...] "and I heard every word of it! <b>It</b> <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> me now with a {{vividness}} like yesterday. I see the room before my eyes. I remember every syllable: I could repeat every sentence of it." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> me {{that on the}} {{following}} day my successor in the governorship of the jail, who he was I know not now, arrived, and that to him in due form I handed over my offices and duties. Before I did so, however, I made it my care to release Barnabas, I think on the previous evening. In his cell I read the Augusta's warrant to the old bishop.|$|E

60|$|It was {{the eve of}} the Spring Feast of Odin. <b>It</b> <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> me that at this feast it was {{the custom}} to {{sacrifice}} some beast to Odin and to lay flowers and other offerings upon the altars of certain other gods that they might be pleased to grant a fruitful season. On this day, however, the sacrifice was to be of no beast, but of a man--Steinar the traitor.|$|E
6000|$|... "I--I don't think so," [...] stammered Shadow, and got {{as red as}} a beet. [...] "But I had a queer dream. I {{forgot about}} it at first, but now <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> me. I somehow dreamed that {{somebody}} came into this room and bent over me while I was in bed, and then picked up something. I started to stop him--and then I went sound asleep again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So far as I am concerned," [...] he said, [...] "that {{is of no}} account. There was a day at Mukden--I do {{not like}} to talk of it, but <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> me--when I rode twelve {{different}} horses in twenty-four hours, but perhaps," [...] he added, turning to Lady Grace, [...] "you would not care to trust your horse with one who is a stranger to your--what is it you call them?--steeplechases." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not yet," [...] {{answered}} Joan. [...] "But I hope to be, one day." [...] She spoke without thinking, {{not quite}} knowing what she meant. But <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> her in after years.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I explain." [...] She {{was really}} fine; <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> her {{essential}} plea for her {{freedom of action}} and his beauty of trust. [...] "I mean," [...] she added, [...] "I will explain." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Paint good pictures? How can I tell {{without seeing}} {{some of your}} work? Doesn't <b>it</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> me that at Oxford you used to sketch very prettily? But that's {{the last thing that}} matters." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Grose's {{large face}} showed me, at this, {{for the first}} time, the faraway faint glimmer of a {{consciousness}} more acute: I somehow made out in it the delayed dawn of an idea I myself had not given her and that was as yet quite obscure to me. <b>It</b> <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> me that I thought instantly of this as something I could get from her; and I felt it to be connected with the desire she presently showed to know more. [...] "When was it--on the tower?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, I will go now! I haf {{no wish to}} stay, for all my life {{is black}} to me. If I had found that other little friend to fill her place, I should not grieve so much, because she is weller there above than I could make her here; but no; I wait for that other one; I save all my heart for her; I send it, but <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> me; then I know my hope is dead, and I am all alone in the strange land." ...|$|E
6000|$|I wish to {{come down}} {{eighteen}} hundred years later and refer to a remark made {{by one of the}} Latin historians. I read it in a translation many years ago, and <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> me now with force. It was alluding to a time when people were still living who could have seen the Saviour in the flesh. Christianity was so new that the people of Rome had hardly heard of it, and had but confused notions of what it was. The substance of the remark was this: Some Christians were persecuted in Rome through error, they being 'mistaken for Jews.' ...|$|E
50|$|San Sebastián Gipuzkoa BC started {{competing}} in LEB 2, third tier. After a first season where the club finished in 11th position out of sixteen teams, it ceased in activity until 2004, when <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> LEB 2.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Her ring,’ he went on. ‘Will <b>it</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> me? My mind hangs {{about her}} ring very uneasily to-night. But that is explainable. I {{have had it}} so long, and I have prized it so much! I wonder—’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I, too, {{was fond}} of dancing; but, as you say, it has gone away. <b>It</b> will <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> you, in half-a-dozen years, perhaps. <b>It</b> can never <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> me. Things do <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> men.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Five {{years ago}} I {{had never heard}} of a bonefish. The first man who ever spoke to me about this species said to me, very quietly with serious intentness: [...] "Have you had any {{experience}} with bonefish?" [...] I said no, and asked him what kind that was. His reply was enigmatical. [...] "Well, don't go after bonefish unless you can give up all other fishing." [...] I remember I laughed. But I never forgot that remark, and now <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> me clear in its significance. That fisherman read me as well as I misunderstood him.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{should like}} to have seen Redclyffe bay again,' said Guy, after a space. 'Now that mamma is coming, {{that is the one}} thing. I suppose I had set my heart on it, for <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> me how I {{reckoned}} on standing on that rock with you, feeling the wind, hearing the surge, looking at the meeting of earth and sky, and the train of sunlight.' He spoke slowly, pausing between each recollection,--'You will see it some day,' he added. 'But I must give it up; it is earth after all, and looking back.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, the salmon's {{really a}} seafish. It's born in fresh water, {{but it goes}} down to the ocean as soon as it's big enough, and it's {{generally}} believed that it stays there three or four years, though it's a fact that we know mighty little about the salmon yet. Then <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the same place and spawns and dies. You see, there's a constant succession coming up." [...] He broke off with a laugh. [...] "Now we'll try to get one. There are three or four big fellows yonder. All {{you have to do}} is to slash at them with the hook." ...|$|E
