40|$|We {{have marked}} a cloned Drosophila transposable element [...] the I element [...] with an {{engineered}} neomycin-containing <b>indicator</b> <b>gene,</b> whose expression is conditioned by {{passage of the}} transposon through an RNA intermediate. Mobility of the marked element introduced into Drosophila as a transgene could be detected in vivo, upon in toto selection of developing embryos on G 418 -containing medium. For resistant individuals, Southern blot analysis and nucleotide sequencing after PCR amplification disclosed transposition of the marked element into new loci, with target site duplications and splicing out of the intron in the <b>indicator</b> <b>gene.</b> It demonstrates that the I element, which {{is closely related to}} the widespread mammalian LINEs, transposes through an RNA intermediate, as up to now only conjectured from sequence singularities of this class of 'non-viral retrotransposons'. The developed <b>indicator</b> <b>gene</b> provides a potent new genetic tool for detection and quantitative analysis of retrotransposon mobility and its regulation as it occurs in vivo...|$|E
40|$|We {{have used}} a {{competition}} assay to identify the targets of trans-acting elements that modulate {{the expression of the}} human c-myc gene (designated MYC in human gene nomenclature). For this purpose, a c-myc hybrid <b>indicator</b> <b>gene</b> was formed by joining the c-myc promoter region, first noncoding exon, and intron to the bacterial gene for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). The test assay consisted of cotransfecting the <b>indicator</b> <b>gene</b> with competing fragments of DNA derived from suspected control regions of the c-myc gene. Such experiments test the hypothesis that control regions are often targets for the binding of trans-acting regulatory factors that can be diverted to competing fragments of DNA. A negatively acting element will be diverted from the <b>indicator</b> <b>gene,</b> allowing the gene's enhanced expression, whereas a positively acting element will behave oppositely. Control indicator genes driven by non-myc promoters assess the specificity of the effect. Using this approach, we find three c-myc regions that are capable of enhancing the expression of the <b>indicator</b> <b>gene</b> in competition assays (i. e., putative sites of negative modulation). In addition, we find sequences near the c-myc promoters that suppress expression in competition assays (i. e., putative binding sites of positively acting factors). These results, with appropriate controls, suggest the existence of target sites near the c-myc gene that specifically modulate its expression both positively and negatively. Their locations fit well with regions damaged or lost in many Burkitt lymphoma and murine plasmacytoma translocations...|$|E
40|$|We {{have marked}} a Drosophila transposable element [...] the LINE-like I element [...] with an intron-containing <b>indicator</b> <b>gene</b> {{inserted}} {{in place of}} a large deletion in the I element second ORF encompassing the reverse transcriptase domain, and this marked element was placed downstream to a potent actin promoter. An expression vector for the I element ORFs was also constructed, under the same heterologous promoter. The <b>indicator</b> <b>gene</b> contains a lacZ reporter gene the expression of which is conditioned by retrotransposition of the marked element, thus allowing detection of transposition events by testing for either beta-galactosidase expression or occurrence of spliced DNA molecules. The marked I element was introduced into Drosophila melanogaster cells in culture by transfection. Spliced DNA copies of the marked element and specifically stained beta-galactosidase-expressing cells were detected only upon co-transfection with the I expression vector, thus indicating that an ORF 2 -deleted element can be complemented in trans for transposition. This simple assay for retrotransposition in Drosophila cells in culture provides a tool for the rapid analysis of the mechanism of I transposition in its cis and trans sequence requirements...|$|E
40|$|Background Classification {{of cancer}} subtypes {{by means of}} {{microarray}} signatures is becoming increasingly difficult to ignore as a potential to transform pathological diagnosis; nonetheless, measurement of <b>Indicator</b> <b>genes</b> in routine practice appears to be arduous. In a preceding published study, we utilized real-time PCR measurement of <b>Indicator</b> <b>genes</b> in acute lymphoid leukaemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) {{as a way of}} application of microarray gene signatures. More to the point, the specificity of such genes for this distinction was investigated by their measurement in cases afflicted with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and with normal bone marrow (BM). Material and Method Mononuclear cells were sorted into unselected (total), CD 34 +ve, and CD 34 -ve fractions, mRNA globally amplified by using PolyA PCR.

40|$|Four <b>indicator</b> <b>genes</b> were {{monitored}} by quantitative PCR in hospital effluent (HE) {{and in the}} raw and treated wastewater of the {{municipal wastewater treatment plant}} receiving the hospital discharge. The <b>indicator</b> <b>genes</b> were the class 1 integrase gene intI 1, to assess the capacity of bacteria to be involved in horizontal gene transfer processes; blaTEM, one of the most widespread antibiotic resistance genes in the environment, associated with Enterobacteriaceae; vanA, an antibiotic resistance gene uncommon in the environment and frequent in clinical isolates; and marA, part of a locus related to the stress response in Enterobacteriaceae. Variation in the abundance of these genes was analysed {{as a function of the}} type of water, and possible correlations with cultivable bacteria, antimicrobial residue concentrations, and bacterial community composition and structure were analysed. HE was confirmed as an important source of blaTEM and vanA genes, and wastewater treatment showed a limited capacity to remove these resistance genes. The genes blaTEM and vanA presented the strongest correlations with culturable bacteria, antimicrobial residues and some bacterial populations, representing interesting candidates as <b>indicator</b> <b>genes</b> to monitor resistance in environmental samples. The intI 1 gene was the most abundant in all samples, demonstrating that wastewater bacterial populations hold a high potential for gene acquisitio...|$|R
40|$|Motivation: We {{present a}} {{probabilistic}} model called a Joint Intervention Network (JIN) for inferring interactions among a chosen set of regulator genes. The input to the method are expression changes of downstream <b>indicator</b> <b>genes</b> observed under the knock-out of the regulators.

Results/Conclusions: We applied JIN to a Vibrio cholerae regulatory network to uncover mechanisms critical to its environmental persistence. V. cholerae is a facultative human pathogen that causes cholera in humans and responsible for seven pandemics. We analyzed the expression response of 17 V. cholerae biofilm <b>indicator</b> <b>genes</b> under various single and multiple knock-outs of three known biofilm regulators.

40|$|Mouse mammary {{tumour virus}} (MMTV) gene {{expression}} {{has been shown}} to be regulated by glucocorticoids. A hormone response element (HRE) located between - 202 and - 59 upstream of the start of transcription in the long terminal repeat (LTR) region of the proviral DNA is required for this induction. We have investigated the role played by the HRE in the induction of MMTV LTR transcription by other classes of steroid hormones. Chimaeric constructs containing the HRE and the authentic LTR promoter linked to an <b>indicator</b> <b>gene</b> or the HRE linked to an otherwise hormone insensitive promoter directing the transcription of an <b>indicator</b> <b>gene,</b> were transfected into the human mammary tumour cell line T 47 D. Transcription at the MMTV LTR promoter or at the previously hormone-insensitive promoter was induced by progestins and androgens but not by oestradiol in transfected cells that contained functional receptors for these hormones. These results identify the HRE as the cis-acting element that mediates the progestin and androgen induction of MMTV LTR transcription. The HRE is therefore a DNA element that is required not just for glucocorticoid but also for progesterone and androgen induction of MMTV LTR transcription...|$|E

40|$|We devised an <b>indicator</b> <b>gene</b> for retrotransposition, nlsLacZRT, which {{contains}} the Escherichia coli lacZ gene fused to a nuclear location signal (nlsLacZ), engineered {{in such a}} way that the gene is expressed only if the structure in which it has been inserted transposes itself through an RNA intermediate. A cloned murine leukemia retrovirus with an ecotropic host range (Moloney murine leukemia virus), rendered defective by a large deletion encompassing the three viral gag, pol, and env open reading frames, was marked with this <b>indicator</b> <b>gene</b> and introduced by transfection into heterologous feline cells. No beta-galactosidase activity could be detected among the clonal cell population, unless the defective provirus was complemented in trans by the gag-pol gene products. Under these conditions, cell variants which disclosed an easily detectable nuclear blue coloration upon in situ 5 -bromo- 4 -chloro- 3 -indolyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside staining were observed. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting of the beta-galactosidase-positive cells, followed by Southern blot analysis, demonstrated an unambiguous correlation between nlsLacZRT activation and retrotransposition of the marked provirus. Transposition occurs at a high frequency (up to 10 (- 4) events per cell per generation), which is dependent on the level of expression of the gag-pol gene and is concomitant with the release of noninfectious retroviruslike particles which are the hallmarks, but not the intermediates, of the intracellular transposition process...|$|E

40|$|To {{determine}} whether the expression of cardiac genes changes in a graded manner or by on/off switching when cardiac myocytes change genetic programs in living animals, we have studied two <b>indicator</b> <b>genes</b> that change their expression oppositely in mouse binucleate ventricular cardiomyocytes during development {{and in response to}} cardiac hypertrophy. One is a single-copy transgene controlled by an α-myosin heavy chain (aMHC) promoter and coding for CFP. The other is the endogenous β-myosin heavy chain (bMHC) gene modified to code for a YFP–bMHC fusion protein. Using high-resolution confocal microscopy, we determined the expression of the two <b>indicator</b> <b>genes</b> in individual cardiomyocytes perinatally and after inducing cardiac hypertrophy by transverse aortic constriction. Our results provide strong evidence that the cardiac genes respond by switching their expression in an on/off rather than graded manner, and that responding genes within a single cell and within the two nuclei of cardiomyocytes do not necessarily switch concordantly...|$|R

40|$|Using a {{transient}} transfection assay, we have defined the sequences {{required for the}} activation of the IL- 2 gene in response to signals from the T cell antigen receptor. To do so we have transfected the human T cell line Jurkat with hybrid DNA constructs in which fragments from the IL- 2 gene are linked to an <b>indicator</b> <b>gene.</b> The <b>indicator</b> <b>gene</b> product, as well as IL- 2 production from the endogenous IL- 2 gene were assayed after activation of the transfected Jurkat cells by various stimuli. We have demonstrated that a 275 bp fragment stretching from 52 to 326 bp upstream of the IL- 2 gene transcription initiation site is required for expression of the linked <b>indicator</b> <b>gene.</b> This IL- 2 gene fragment has several {{of the characteristics of}} a transcriptional enhancer element, in that it functions in both orientations and will enhance the expression from the promoter of an unrelated gene. Such enhancement occurred only after activation of Jurkat cells through the T cell antigen receptor. More specifically, this 275 bp fragment activated the expression of a linked gene after binding of a monoclonal antibody to the Jurkat T cell antigen receptor in the presence of PMA. In addition, calcium ionophore, which circumvents antigen receptor binding in T cell activation, induced the expression of the linked gene through this 275 bp sequence, in the presence of PMA. Finally, in a mutant Jurkat cell line lacking T 3 /antigen receptor complexes at the cell surface, no expression due to the IL- 2 5 ' flanking region was seen after exposure to antibody to the T cell antigen receptor plus PMA or to PHA plus PMA. In contrast, calcium ionophore plus PMA did induce the expression of a linked gene through the IL- 2 5 ' flanking region in the mutant Jurkat cell line. The responsiveness of the transfected hybrid genes containing the IL- 2 regulatory region paralleled the expression of the endogenous IL- 2 gene, as determined by IL- 2 bioassays. We conclude that the 275 bp IL- 2 sequence (- 326 to - 52 bp) is a target for the signal pathway originating at the T cell antigen receptor. Definition of this 275 bp target sequence should now permit the isolation of the molecules that bind to and activate the IL- 2 gene...|$|E

In this paper, we investigated whether or not mismatch repair influences activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) -mediated hypermutation in a non-B lymphocyte line. We did so by regulating expression of MutL homologue MLH 1, which is essential in mismatch repair, in a kidney cell line that had been transduced by an AID-containing vector. Whether or not MLH 1 was expressed, we found {{no difference in the}} mutation rates of an <b>indicator</b> <b>gene.</b> We conclude that in order to contribute to hypermutation, mismatch repair needs additional factors that are present in activated B lymphocytes, but absent in the cell line investigated...|$|E

VZV DNA is 124, 884 base pair long and encodes four regulatory proteins (IE 4, IE 61, IE 62 and IE 63).

Those randomized to prosocial behavior towards specific others demonstrated improvements (i. e., reductions) in leukocyte expression of CTRA <b>indicator</b> <b>genes.</b> No significant changes in CTRA gene expression were observed in the other 3 conditions.

5000|$|Evolutionary {{psychologists have}} {{proposed}} that individuals may adopt conditional mating strategies in which they adjust their mating tactics to relevant environmental or internal conditions. To the extent that ancestral men were capable of pursuing short-term mating strategies with multiple women, the evolutionary benefits are relatively straightforward. Less clear, however, are the evolutionary benefits that women might have received from pursuing short-term mating strategies. One prominent hypothesis is that ancestral women selectively engaged in short-term mating with men capable of transmitting genetic benefits to their offspring such as health, disease resistance, or attractiveness (see good genes theory and sexy son hypothesis). Since women cannot inspect men's genes directly, they may have evolved to infer genetic quality from certain observable characteristics (see indicator traits). One prominent candidate for a [...] "good genes" [...] indicator includes fluctuating asymmetry, or {{the degree to which}} men deviate from perfect bodily symmetry. Other candidates include masculine facial features, behavioral dominance, and low vocal pitch. [...] Evolutionary psychologists have therefore predicted that women pursuing a short-term mating strategy will have higher preferences for these good <b>genes</b> <b>indicators,</b> and men who possess good <b>genes</b> <b>indicators</b> will be more successful in pursuing short-term mating strategies than men who do not. Indeed, research indicates that self-perceived physical attractiveness, fluctuating asymmetry, and low vocal pitch are positively related to short-term mating success in men but not in women. Women prefer purported good <b>genes</b> <b>indicators</b> more for a short-term mate than for a long-term mate, and a related line of research shows that women’s preferences for good <b>genes</b> <b>indicators</b> in short-term mates tends to increase during peak fertility in the menstrual cycle just prior to ovulation.|$|R

A mesocosm experiment was designed to test the effects of light, mixing and grazing on cyanobacteria abundance, with nutrients held constant. We predicted that toxic cyanobacteria would be most abundant under stagnant conditions, with enhanced light, with no bivalve grazers present. Abundances of <b>indicator</b> <b>gene</b> copies and phytoplankton counts supported this hypothesis. However, chlorophyll-a, phycocyanin, and the toxin microcystin were all found to be most abundant under mixed conditions with ambient light.

While nucleotides of the highly conserved core sequence TGCPuCXC are critical, substitutions in the less conserved regions affect the induction response only marginally.

At present, diarrheagenic E. coli bacteria are grouped into seven major pathotypes that differ in their virulence factor profiles, severity of clinical manifestations, and prognosis. In this study, we developed and evaluated a one-step multiplex PCR (MPCR) for the straightforward differential identification of intestinal pathotypes of E. coli. The specificity of this novel MPCR was validated by using a subset of reference strains and further confirmed by PCR-independent pheno- and genotypic characterization. Moreover, we tested 246 clinical E. coli isolates derived from diarrhea patients from several distinct geographic regions. Interestingly, besides strains belonging to the defined and well-described pathotypes, we identified five unconventional strains expressing intermediate virulence factor profiles. These strains have been further characterized and appear to represent intermediate strains carrying genes and expressing factors associated with enteropathogenic E. coli, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, enterotoxigenic E. coli, and enteroaggregative E. coli alike. These strains represent further examples of the extraordinary plasticity of the E. coli genome.

We have previously {{shown that a}} 200 -bp region extending from - 120 to + 67 relative to the transcription start site is sufficient to obtain eye-specific expression from the ninaE promoter. In the present study, 22 different 4 - 13 -bp sequences in the - 120 /+ 67 promoter region were altered by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. Several of these sequences {{were found to be}} required for proper promoter function; two of these are conserved in the promoter of the homologous gene isolated from the related species Drosophila virilis. Alteration of a conserved 9 -bp sequence results in aberrant, low level expression in the body. Alteration of a separate 11 -bp sequence, found in the promoter regions of several photoreceptor-specific genes of Drosophila, results in an approximately 15 -fold reduction in promoter efficiency but without apparent alteration of tissue-specificity. A protein factor capable of interacting with this 11 -bp sequence has been detected by DNaseI footprinting in embryonic nuclear extracts.

The affinity of Tet repressor for mutant tet operators is not affected by the presence of an already occupied neighbouring wild-type operator, indicating little or no cooperativity. The regulation of the divergently oriented tet promoters PA and PR by the tet operators O 1 and O 2 and Tet repressor provided in trans is determined using transcriptional fusions of the promoters to lacZ and galK <b>indicator</b> <b>genes</b> located with different polarity on the same plasmid.

The HFV Bet-expressing cells only partially resisted infection by the distantly related feline FV (FFV). Pseudotyping experiments, using murine retroviral vectors with an HFV envelope, revealed that the resistance was not due to downregulation of the unknown HFV receptor.

In infection experiments, HFV vectors expressing an <b>indicator</b> <b>gene</b> under control of the HFV promoters showed no activity in Bet+cells.

The data provide evidence for an intragenic start site of transcription in the genome of a complex, exogenous human retrovirus and are discussed in terms of a model for regulating spumaretroviral gene expression...|$|E
40|$|Background: Phloem-feeding insects can {{manipulate}} plant-induced resistance {{and are able}} to suppress effective jasmonic acid/ethylene (JA/ET) defenses by the induction of inefficient salicylic acid (SA) based responses. As a result, activation of the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway in transgenic plants is anticipated to cause complex interactions between phloem-feeding insects and their host plants due to predicted contradiction between two defense forces: the toxicity of various phenylpropanoids and the accumulation of SA via a branch of the activated pathway. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we investigated the effect of activating the phenylpropanoids pathway in Nicotiana tabacum, by over-expression of the PAP 1 transcription factor, on the whitefly Bemisia tabaci, a phloem-feeding insect model. Our performance assays indicated that the over-expression made the transgenic plants a more suitable host for B. tabaci than wild-type (WT) plants, although these plants accumulated significantly higher levels of flavonoids. Transcription analyses of <b>indicator</b> <b>genes</b> in the SA (PR 1 a) and JA/ET (ERF 1, COI 1 and AOC) pathways followed by quantification of the SA and JA hormone levels, indicated that B. tabaci infestation periods longer than 8 hours, caused higher levels of activity of SA signaling in transgenic plants and higher levels of JA/ET signaling in WT plants. Conclusions/Significance: Taken together, these results emphasize the important role JA/ET-induced defenses play in protecting plants from successful infestation by B. tabaci and likely other phloem-feeding insects. It also indicates th...|$|R
40|$|To {{learn more}} about the {{physiological}} state of Geobacter species living in subsurface sediments, heat-sterilized sediments from a uranium-contaminated aquifer in Rifle, Colorado, were inoculated with Geobacter uraniireducens, a pure culture representative of the Geobacter species that predominates during in situ uranium bioremediation at this site. Whole-genome microarray analysis comparing sediment-grown G. uraniireducens with cells grown in defined culture medium indicated that there were 1084 genes that had higher transcript levels during growth in sediments. Thirty-four c-type cytochrome genes were upregulated in the sediment-grown cells, including several genes that are homologous to cytochromes that are required for optimal Fe(III) and U(VI) reduction by G. sulfurreducens. Sediment-grown cells also had higher levels of transcripts, indicative of such physiological states as nitrogen limitation, phosphate limitation and heavy metal stress. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR showed that many of the metabolic <b>indicator</b> <b>genes</b> that appeared to be upregulated in sediment-grown G. uraniireducens also showed an increase in expression in the natural community of Geobacter species present during an in situ uranium bioremediation field experiment at the Rifle site. These results demonstrate that it is feasible to monitor gene expression of a microorganism growing in sediments on a genome scale and that analysis of the physiological status of a pure culture growing in subsurface sediments can provide insights into the factors controlling the physiology of natural subsurface communities...|$|R
40|$|AbstractExpression of neuropeptide Y (Npy) heteronuclear (hn) RNA, an <b>indicator</b> of <b>gene</b> transcription, was {{significantly}} {{increased in the}} arcuate nucleus of rats 30 min after insulin injection. Npy hnRNA levels were also increased significantly in response to hypoglycemia in rats in which the hypothalamus was deafferentated, although the absolute levels were significantly lower than in sham-operated rats. Direct effects of lowering glucose levels on Npy gene expression were also confirmed in hypothalamic organotypic cultures. Thus, Npy gene transcription in the arcuate nucleus increases rapidly in response to hypoglycemia, and both direct and indirect inputs {{are involved in the}} rapid upregulation...|$|R
