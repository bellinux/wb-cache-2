50|$|This can {{be shown}} schematically as a {{sequence}} of divergent and convergent lenses. The quadrupoles are often laid out in what are called FODO patterns (where F focusses vertically and defocusses horizontally, and D focusses horizontally and defocusses vertically and O is a space or deflection magnet).

40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} a cheap ultrasonic stage in setups related to optical coherence tomography. The stage was used in several configurations: (1) optical delay line in an optical coherence tomography (OCT) setup; (2) as a delay line measuring coherence function of a low coherence source (e. g. superluminescent diode) and (3) in a dynamic <b>focusing</b> <b>arrangement.</b> The results are as follows: the stage is suitable for coherence function measurement (coherence length up to 70 µm) of the light source and dynamic focusing. We found it unsuitable for OCT due to an unstable velocity profile. Despite this, the velocity profile has a repeatable shape (4 % over 1000 A-scans) and slight modifications to the stage promise wider applications...|$|E

It {{has at least one}} arrangement for coupling radiation into a light conductor associated with a portable processing head and at least one <b>focusing</b> <b>arrangement.</b> DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The source output divergence is dimensioned so the radiation can be coupled into a light conductor whose core diameter is not greater than 400 microns. The device has a processing distance of at least 100 mm., a laser light source (1) with a mean output power of at least 150 Watts and a pulse power of at least 50 kW, at least one arrangement (3) for coupling radiation into a light conductor (2) associated with a portable processing head (6) and at least one <b>focusing</b> <b>arrangement.</b> The divergence of the radiation at the output of the source is dimensioned so that the radiation can be coupled into a light conductor whose core diameter is not greater than 400 microns. AN INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for the following:- a method of laser assisted removal of layers from a surface. USE - For removing layers from surface, for removing coatings from high voltage masts (claimed). ADVANTAGE - Overcomes certain disadvantages of conventional arrangements, and enables laser radiation emanating from a light conductor at medium power of at least 150 Watts and from a pulse line at at least 50 kW to be focused using a portable processing head so that the burn point is more than 100 mm. from the processing head...|$|E

The stage was used in several configurations: 1) optical delay line in optical coherence tomography (OCT) setup; 2) as a delay line measuring coherence function of a low coherence source (e. g. superluminescent diode); 3) as a path length modulator in optical coherence microscopy (OCM) setup and finally 4) in a dynamic <b>focusing</b> <b>arrangement.</b> We evaluate each configuration and point to possible improvements either in setups or ultrasonic stage architecture. The results are as follows: the stage is suitable for coherence function measurement of the light source and, with some limitations, dynamic focusing.

The combination of a narrow depth of focus, unusually thin films, a relatively large film gate and rapidly advancing films can produce imagery with less than optimum resolution across or within individual frames.

Continuous vacuum pulling mechanisms, suction and induction, were evaluated. Each system 2 ̆ 7 s simplicity, portability and statistically analyzed imagery were assessed. Test imagery indicated a ten percent increase of in focus image area for the vacuum platen and a fifty-five percent increase for the styrene pressure plate. Several suitable vacuum pulling mechanisms were found.

50|$|Binoculars have a {{long history}} of {{military}} use. Galilean designs were widely used up to the end of the 19th century when they gave way to porro prism types. Binoculars constructed for general military use tend to be more rugged than their civilian counterparts. They generally avoid fragile center <b>focus</b> <b>arrangements</b> in favor of independent focus, which also makes for easier, more effective weatherproofing. Prism sets in military binoculars may have redundant aluminized coatings on their prism sets to guarantee they don't lose their reflective qualities if they get wet.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a novel solar dish configuration which can attain a high concentration factor and also facilitate substantial on board energy storage while being low in projected manufacturing cost. This {{is due to}} minimizing the requirement for extreme rigidity and accuracy in the design, in turn through reducing the cantilever distance from dish to receiver. This is done by using a novel split / recombined <b>focus</b> <b>arrangement,</b> enabling rim angles up to 900, thus bringing the focal point {{much closer to the}} dish than standard dishes, which typically use approximately 450. This research is potentially significant for dish Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) in general and other emerging CSP systems that require high concentration factors. 1...|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} ensure the {{positioning}} of the pilot and writing beams remained as constant as possible, the apple tube used a unique electron gun arrangement. The beams were produced from a single anode and two closely spaced cathodes, resulting in the beams traveling in slightly different directions. They were then magnetically focused so they crossed at a point {{just in front of}} the electron guns, where a single-slit aperture was used to clear up the signal to produce a sharp-edged elliptical beam pattern. The deflection coils were positioned around the aperture, so by having both beams pass by the deflection coils while superimposed, the deflection of both was equal. The beams then spread out again on the far side of the aperture, where a second <b>focussing</b> <b>arrangement</b> ensured both were traveling parallel to each other.|$|R
