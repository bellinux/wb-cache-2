40|$|Plastic {{industry}} is {{today in a}} constant growth, demanding several products from other segments, which includes the plastic molds, mainly used in the injection molding process. Considering all the requirements of plastic molds, the surface finishing is of special interest, as the injected plastic part is able to reproduce any details (and also defects) from the mold surface. Therefore, several aspects on mold finishing are important, mainly related to manufacturing conditions - machining, grinding, polishing and texturing, and also related to the tool steel quality, in relation to microstructure homogeneity and non-metallic <b>inclusions</b> (<b>cleanliness).</b> The present paper is then focused on this interrelationship between steel quality and manufacturing process, which are both related to the final quality of plastic mold surfaces. Examples are {{discussed in terms of}} surface finishing of plastic molds and the properties or the microstructure of mold steels...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the reasons}} for {{rejection}} of the products manufactured of the thin steel sheets are the steel inclusions. Therefore, the <b>inclusions</b> <b>cleanliness</b> is an important factor of steel quality and trade acceptance. The comprehensive online detection of the defects and inclusions in the thin steel sheets can be realised by magnetic flux leakage technique (MFL technique) using a magnetisation system in combination with several hundreds of magnetic field sensors. In this study, the detectability of the small size (0. 2 mm) inclusions in the steel sheets with a thickness more than 0. 5 mm was tested. The developed measurement arrangement is described. The resolution capability of the used technique was investigated on the test specimen of thickness 0. 8 mm. The drilled holes with a diameter of 0. 2 mm with various depths were used as test defects. In order to model the detection of hidden (internal) inclusions, the magnetic field sensor was placed at {{the opposite side of the}} specimen to the surface with the drilled holes. An important point of the design optimisation was to increase the air gap between the inspected steel sheet and the sensor (sensor lift off). As the present results shown, the drilled hole with a diameter of 0. 2 mm and depth 0. 2 mm at the back surface of the test specimen of thickness 0. 8 mm can be detected with the sensor lift off 1. 5 mm...|$|E
40|$|In modern accelerators {{stringent}} {{requirements are}} placed on materials of vacuum systems. Their physical and mechanical properties, machinability, weldability or brazeability are key parameters. Adequate strength, ductility, magnetic properties at room as well as low temperatures are important factors for vacuum systems of accelerators working at cryogenic temperatures, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) under construction at CERN. In addition, baking or activation of Non-Evaporable Getters (NEG) at high temperatures impose specific choices of material grades of suitable tensile and creep properties in a large temperature range. Today, stainless steels are the dominant materials of vacuum constructions. Their metallurgy is extensively treated. The reasons for specific requirements in terms of metallurgical processes are detailed, in view of obtaining adequate purity, <b>inclusion</b> <b>cleanliness,</b> and fineness of the microstructure. In many cases these requirements are crucial to guarantee the final leak tightness of the vacuum components...|$|R
40|$|Meanwhile the {{considerable}} amount of results acquired since more than sixty years {{in the study of}} this class of materials, the pre-eminence of nickel base superalloys in the gas turbine engineering, which is a domain in constant evolution, drives the significant progresses accomplished along the five last years. The knowledge, each day more precisely known, of the working conditions of the parts, the continuous increase of the computer capacity and the progressive sophistication of the designing methods end up in very high levels of requirements, progressively more complex, which induce the major routes of development. The particular accomplishments in three different domains of application will be described in this paper. Significant increases of performance have been acquired on directionally solidified turbine blades by an in-depth investigation of strain and damage mechanisms. Behaviour and ruin models take more and more into account the physical reality at each scale of observation of the crystalline structure response to coupled prompting of creep, fatigue and oxidation. On such a basis, a judicious choice of analytical compositions and overlays, with adapted conditions of manufacture enhance the use capability of the parts. In an other domain, decisive advantage has been taken of the variability of the forged materials devoted to disc applications. From the same chemistry of alloy, it is possible to optimize the structures according to various combinations of local stressing. This approach is funded on the disposal of efficient methods of microstructure prediction in relationship with the local rheological history. Precise control methods taking into account the complexity of the resulting microstructure allow the production of parts associated with narrow limits of life duration. At last, shall be discussed the significance of an adequate control of <b>inclusion</b> distribution and <b>cleanliness</b> in highly stressed superalloys in relationship with fatigue life duration. The problem more specific to superalloys produced by prealloyed powder metallurgy routes shall be analyzed and the solutions adapted to civil engine applications exposed...|$|R
40|$|Electroslag {{remelted}} (ESR) ingots of INCOLOY alloys 800 and 825 {{are particularly}} prone to macroscale slag <b>inclusions</b> and microscale <b>cleanliness</b> issues. Formation of these structures near the ingot surface can cause significant production yield losses (∼ 10 %) {{due to the}} necessity of extensive surface grinding. Slag inclusions from near the outer radius of the toe end of alloy 800 and 825 ingots {{were found to be}} approximately 1 to 3 mm in size and have a multiphase microstructure consisting of CaF 2, CaTiO 3, MgAl 2 O 4, MgO and some combination of Ca 12 Al 14 O 32 F 2 and/or Ca 12 Al 14 O 33. These inclusions were often surrounded by fields of 1 to 10 μm cuboidal TiN particles. A large number of TiN cuboids were observed in the ESR electrode with similar size and morphology to those observed surrounding slag inclusions in the ESR ingots, suggesting that the TiN particles are relics from ESR electrode production process. Samples taken sequentially throughout the EAF-AOD processes showed that the TiN cuboidals that are found in ESR ingots form between tapping the AOD vessel into the AOD ladle and the casting of ESR electrodes. ^ Analysis of slag skin at various heights of alloy 825 ingots revealed that the phase fraction of CaF 2 decreased, whereas TiCaO 3 and Ca 12 Al 14 O 32 F 2 increased, from toe to head. The observed increase in TiO 2 content suggests that at most a two-fold increase in viscosity of the slag would be expected. Similar analysis of alloy 800 ingots did not reveal significant trends in slag skin composition, possibly due to differences in ingot geometry or the presence of Al toe additions during the remelting of alloy 800. Directional solidification experiments were conducted to determine the solidification sequences of two common ESR slags: Code 316 (33 % CaF 2, 33 % CaO, and 33 % Al 2 O 3) and Code 59 (50 % CaF 2, 20 % CaO, 22 % Al 2 O 3, 5 % MgO, and 3 % TiO 2). In both cases the changes in slag phase fraction as a function of solidification time were not as significant as predicted. This suggests substantial solute concentrations within each phase, significant gas phase reactions or insufficient imposed temperature gradient for directional planer solidification. Optical microscopy and SEM analysis revealed a dendritic structure with Ca 12 Al 14 O 32 F 2 as the primary phase and significant interdendritic porosity. EDS analysis showed that Al segregates to the primary phase while F segregates to the interdendritic regions. Parametric studies using a numerical model of ESR suggests that the ESR process is quite sensitive to changes in slag electrical conductivity and not very sensitive to changes in slag viscosity. ...|$|R
