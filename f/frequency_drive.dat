40|$|Abstract. A {{model of}} ion energy {{distribution}} of dual frequencies capacitively coupled plasma (CCP) has been investigated, {{it is important}} to analyze these phenomenon and mechanism in order to control the microelectronic processes of integrated circuit and develop the base theories of plasma physics. We focused on the function of the ion energy distributions under high and low <b>frequencies</b> (dual <b>frequencies)</b> <b>drive</b> in capacitive discharges, we derived a theory model of the dual <b>frequencies</b> <b>driven</b> IEDs from analyzing theories. The model can analyze and predict the IEDs under different high and low <b>frequencies</b> <b>driven,</b> which results in accurate multi-peaks IEDs and energy width for the given control parameters, particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations are used to verify this model...|$|R

50|$|The {{installation}} {{and integration of}} variable frequency drives can lower the energy consumption of the building's circulation pumps to about 15% {{of what they had}} been using before. A variable <b>frequency</b> <b>drive</b> functions by modulating the frequency of the electricity provided to the motor that it powers. In the USA, the electrical grid uses a frequency of 60 Hertz or 60 cycles per second. Variable frequency drives are able to decrease the output and energy consumption of motors by lowering the frequency of the electricity provided to the motor, however the relationship between motor output and energy consumption is not a linear one. If the variable <b>frequency</b> <b>drive</b> provides electricity to the motor at 30 Hertz, the output of the motor will be 50% because 30 Hertz divided by 60 Hertz is 0.5 or 50%. The energy consumption of a motor running at 50% or 30 Hertz will not be 50%, but will instead be something like 18% because the relationship between motor output and energy consumption are not linear. The exact ratios of motor output or Hertz provided to the motor (which are effectively the same thing), and the actual energy consumption of the variable <b>frequency</b> <b>drive</b> / motor combination depend on the efficiency of the variable <b>frequency</b> <b>drive.</b> For example, because the variable <b>frequency</b> <b>drive</b> needs power itself to communicate with the building automation system, run its cooling fan, etc., if the motor always ran at 100% with the variable <b>frequency</b> <b>drive</b> installed the cost of operation or electricity consumption would actually go up with the new variable <b>frequency</b> <b>drive</b> installed. The amount of energy that variable frequency drives consume is nominal and is hardly worth consideration when calculating savings, however it did need to be noted that VFD's do consume energy themselves. Because the variable frequency drives rarely ever run at 100% and {{spend most of their time}} in the 40% output range, and because now the pumps completely shut down when not needed, the variable frequency drives have reduced the energy consumption of the pumps to around 15% of what they had been using before.|$|E

5000|$|AC {{induction}} {{motors and}} synchronous motors are simple and low maintenance, but are awkward {{to apply for}} traction motors because of their fixed speed characteristic.

Given this, a typical application for a 150 hp motor utilizing soft starting, a gen-set manufacturer's sizing program would select a 250 kW gen-set. For the same application, the program would select a 125 kW gen-set when using a variable <b>frequency</b> <b>drive</b> and a primary reactor bypass with a 30% starting voltage drop, cutting the gen-set in half (Slides 36-39).|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} type of {{electrode}} boiler pumps water from {{the lower part of the}} vessel to an internal header that has nozzles that allow the water to flow to electrodes. Generally the working pressure is maintained at 10 bar. If more pressure is needed (more steam) the controls speed up the pump and flow more water through additional nozzles. As the needed pressure is reached the pump controls the flow of water to obtain the desired steam output (in kg per hour) at the desired pressure. On larger systems the pump can be controlled by a variable <b>frequency</b> <b>drive</b> (VFD) so energy is not wasted. This control system can also control de-aerator pumps and controls.|$|E
5000|$|An early {{advantage}} of AC {{is that the}} power-wasting resistors used in DC locomotives for speed control were not needed in an AC locomotive: multiple taps on the transformer can supply a range of voltages.
