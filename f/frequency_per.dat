40|$|Regional {{transports}} {{are designed}} to operate on air networks having the basic characteristics of short trip distances and low density passengers/cargo, i. e. small numbers of passengers per flight. Regional transports passenger capacity is from 10 to 100 seats and operate on routes from 350 to 1000 nautical miles (nm). An air network operated by regional transports has the following characteristics: (1) connecting regional centers; (2) operating on low density passengers/cargo flow services with minimum two <b>frequencies</b> <b>per</b> day; (3) operating on high density passengers/cargo flow with more than two <b>frequencies</b> <b>per</b> day; and (4) operating supplemental services whenever market demands {{in order to help}} bigger capacity aircraft already operating the same routes. In order to meet passenger requirements providing low fares and high or required number of frequencies, airlines must constantly monitor operational costs and keep them low. It is obvious that costs of operating aircraft must be lower than yield obtained by transporting passengers and cargo. The requirement to achieve favorable yield/cost ratio must provide {{the answer to the question}} of which aircraft will best meet a specific air network.

50|$|In {{addition}} to phase differences, amplitude differences also result in pressure differences across the diaphragm. This amplitude component {{arises from the}} fact that the far side of the diaphragm is farther from the sound source than the front side. Since sound pressure level decreases as the inverse of the distance from the source (it is sound intensity level that drops as the inverse of the distance squared, for those familiar with the inverse square law), the amplitude of the sound will be slightly less at the rear of the diaphragm as compared to the front of the diaphragm. Since the pressure difference due to the amplitude component is dependent only on the amplitude differential with respect to the two sides of the diaphragm, it is independent of <b>frequency,</b> <b>per</b> se.|$|E
50|$|The {{background}} {{field is}} introduced as a Lorentz {{force in the}} (classical) Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac equation (see: Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac force), where the classical statistics of the electric and magnetic fields and quadratic combinations thereof are chosen to match the vacuum expectation values of the equivalent operators in QED. The field is generally represented as a discrete sum of Fourier components each with amplitude and phase that are independent classical random variables, distributed so that the statistics of the fields are isotropic and unchanged under boosts. This prescription is such that each Fourier mode at frequency (f) {{is expected to have}} an energy of hf/2, equaling that of the ground state of the vacuum modes of QED. Unless cut off, the total field has an infinite energy density, with a spectral energy density (per unit <b>frequency</b> <b>per</b> unit volume) 2h/c3f3 where h is Planck's constant. Consequently, the background field is a classical version of the electromagnetic ZPF of QED, though in SED literature the field is commonly referred to simply as 'the ZPF' without making that distinction. It should be noted that any finite cutoff frequency of the field itself would be incompatible with Lorentz invariance. For this reason, some researchers prefer to think of cutoff frequency in terms of the response of particles to the field rather than as a property the field itself.|$|E
5000|$|... when it {{maintains}} a charge q and travels through an electric field E and magnetic field B with a velocity v.The secondary ions that leave {{the surface of}} the sample typically have a kinetic energy of a few electron volts (eV), although a rather small portion have been found to have energy of a few keV. An electrostatic field captures the secondary ions that leave the sample surface; these extracted ions are then transferred to a mass spectrometer. In order to achieve precise isotope measurements, {{there is a need for}} high transmission and high mass resolution. High transmission refers to the low loss of secondary ions between the sample surface and the detector, and high mass resolution refers to the ability to efficiently separate the secondary ions (or molecules of interest) from other ions and/or ions of similar mass. Primary ions will collide with the surface at a specific <b>frequency</b> <b>per</b> unit of surface area. The collision that occurs causes atoms to sputter from the sample surface, and of these atoms only a small amount will undergo ionization. These become secondary ions, which are then detected after transfer through the mass spectrometer. Each primary ion generates a number of secondary ions of an isotope that will reach the detector to be counted. The count rate is determined by ...|$|E

40|$|The UV {{induction}} of diphtheria toxin-resistant (DTr) mutants {{in normal}} and xeroderma pigmentosum human fibroblasts has been quantitatively characterized. A concentration of diphtheria toxin at which DTr cells are cross-resistant to Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A was determined {{and used in}} the selection of resistant mutants. Recovery of mutants was not influenced by the presence of wild-type cell densities of 1 - 8 x 10 (5) per 9 -cm plate, indicating no metabolic cooperation exists, in contrast to what is seen {{in the selection of}} some other variant phenotypes. Expression periods for UV-induced mutations differed with the severity of mutagen treatment and cell strain used. A relatively long (10 - 15 days after UV treatment) expression period was required for the maximum recovery of DTr mutants. Maximum recovery was followed by a decrease in mutation frequency on subsequent days evaluated. An apparent linear dose response within the dose range used was observed for UV-induced mutations in both normal and xeroderma pigmentosum fibroblasts.
