25|$|Cohabitation {{is not a}} {{legal basis}} for inheritance, since {{partners}} {{are not included in}} the legal circle of heirs. Therefore, domestic partners may inherit from one another only when there is a last will and testament. The taxes on such an inheritance are higher than the taxes imposed on inheritances received by a legal spouse. Domestic partners inheriting through a will also <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> a preserve part of the estate.|$|E

25|$|In Northern Rhodesia, the BSAC claimed {{ownership}} {{of all the}} unalienated land in the territory, {{and the right to}} alienate it. Europeans occupied land along the line of the railway and near the towns, but generally there was no land shortage, as the population density was lower than in Southern Rhodesia, and the European population was much lower. In 1913, BSAC drew up plans for Native Reserves along Southern Rhodesian lines, outside which Africans would <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> own or occupy land, but these plans were not implemented until 1928, after company administration ended.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{domestic}} partnership option under Belarussian law, although co-habitation outside of marriage, even by heterosexual couples, is common. Domestic partnership {{is not a}} legal basis for one partner’s changing his or her surname. It {{does not lead to}} spousal material commonwealth between the partners. Among the responsibilities taken on by the partners in their life together, the only ones legally enforced are those listed in the civil law. When they have a common business, their relations are regulated by the rules of commercial law. If they break up, the partners have no access to the legally recognized rights of a spouse in a divorce. Current and former partners in cohabitation <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> alimony or financial support.|$|E

Later the Institute for Criminal Expertise and the Department of Justice of the Russian Federation issued an official conclusion stating that the family photographs of Kosmodemyanskaya belong to the same person as the Pravda photograph of the hanged partisan. The article ended in emotional sentences Let your names be sacred for centuries, Tanya, Zoya, Lila! So many of you gave for us the most precious thing you had; your lives.

25|$|Arbitration {{has also}} {{been used as a}} means of resolving labor {{disputes}} for more than a century. Labor organizations in the United States, such as the National Labor Union, called for arbitration as early as 1866 as an alternative to strikes to resolve disputes over the wages, benefits and other rights that workers would enjoy. Governments have also relied on arbitration to resolve particularly large labor disputes, such as the Coal Strike of 1902. This type of arbitration, wherein a neutral arbitrator decides the terms of the collective bargaining agreement, is commonly known as interest arbitration. The United Steelworkers of America adopted an elaborate form of interest arbitration, known as the Experimental Negotiating Agreement, in the 1970s as a means of avoiding the long and costly strikes that had made the industry vulnerable to foreign competition. Major League Baseball uses a variant of interest arbitration, in which an arbitrator chooses between the two sides' final offers, to set the terms for contracts for players who are not eligible for free agency. Interest arbitration is now most frequently used by public employees who <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> strike (for example, law enforcement and firefighters).|$|E
25|$|The Church of Scotland (or Kirk) is {{the largest}} {{religious}} denomination in Scotland, however, unlike the Church of England it is Presbyterian and (since 1921) not {{a branch of the}} state, with the Sovereign holding no formal role in the Church other than being an ordinary member. However, though the Kirk is disestablished, Scotland is not a secular polity. The Kirk remains a national church to which the state has special obligations; it is conventional that the monarch, who is head of state, must attend the Church when she visits Scotland, and they swear in their accession oath to maintain and preserve the church. The state also gives numerous preferences to the Church of Scotland and Catholic Church, particularly in education. The blasphemy law has not been abolished in Scotland, though it has fallen into disuse. Non-religious couples can have a civil wedding with no religious elements, and humanist weddings have been legally recognised since 2005, and enshrined in Scottish law since 2017. Collective worship makes prayer and worship of a Christian character mandatory in all schools, but parents can remove their children from these lessons, though sixth formers <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> opt out.|$|E

500|$|The {{provisions}} {{relating to}} the right to property were changed a number of times. The Forty-Fourth Amendment of 1978 [...] from the list of fundamental rights A new provision, Article 300-A, was added to the constitution, which provided that [...] "no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law". Thus if a legislature makes a law depriving a person of his property, there would be no obligation {{on the part of the}} State to pay anything as compensation. The aggrieved person shall <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> move the court under Article 32. Thus, the right to property is no longer a fundamental right, though it is still a constitutional right. If the government appears to have acted unfairly, the action can be challenged in a court of law by citizens.|$|E
