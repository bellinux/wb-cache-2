40|$|Abstract. <b>Data</b> <b>interpretation</b> is an {{essential}} element of mature software project management and empirical software engineering. As far as project management is concerned, <b>data</b> <b>interpretation</b> can support the assessment of the current project status and the achievement of project goals and requirements. As far as empirical studies are concerned, <b>data</b> <b>interpretation</b> can help to draw conclusions from collected data, support decision making, and contribute to better process, product, and quality models. With the increasing availability and usage of data from projects and empirical studies, effective <b>data</b> <b>interpretation</b> is gaining more importance. Essential tasks such as the data-based identification of project risks, the drawing of valid and usable conclusions from individual empirical studies, or the combination of evidence from multiple studies require sound and effective <b>data</b> <b>interpretation</b> mechanisms. This article sketches the progress made in the last years with respect to <b>data</b> <b>interpretation</b> and states needs and challenges for advanced <b>data</b> <b>interpretation.</b> In addition, selected examples for innovative <b>data</b> <b>interpretation</b> mechanisms are discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{earthquake}} <b>data</b> <b>interpretation</b> process, <b>data</b> body precision {{would not}} be very high as the workload of <b>interpretation</b> or <b>data</b> memory. Using the interpolate method mentioned in this paper, we can finish the interpolation without increasing the workload of <b>interpretation,</b> increase earthquake <b>data</b> precision, and acquire more information from earthquake data. Significance of Earthquake <b>Data</b> <b>Interpretation</b> and Interpolation Algorithm Earthquake <b>data</b> <b>interpretation</b> mainly comprises of two aspects: (1) stratigraphic calibration, in which a well layer sequence is established using VSP, synthetic data and other data, making geologic stratum and seismic reflection of well drilling corresponding with each other, and the interpreted target explicit [1]; (2) structural interpretation, including stratum tracking and fault interpretation. Stratigraphic and structural interpretations are inseparable: only fault interpretation and fault complex are correct, relative relationship between stratums can be correct and then communication between stratums can be ensured [2]. After earthquake <b>data</b> <b>interpretation</b> work is complete, 3 d data body of a block can be acquired, which comprises of data slices in directions of 3 d dimensional space, and also corresponding stratum curve or fault curve is acquired in each direction according to earthquake <b>data</b> <b>interpretation</b> result [3]. However, in ordinary circumstances, monitoring area for the acquisition of earthquake data is larger, but more detailed information can be provided by more precise data with regard to earthquake <b>data</b> <b>interpretation.</b> However, this also means a greater data volume is necessary. Interpolation results with low precision can be selected {{through the application of}} interpolation algorithm in earthquake <b>data</b> <b>interpretation,</b> and then density of stratum curve is increased using interpolation, and thus stratum curve with high accuracy can be acquired...|$|R

In this paper, we use 3 D SAR tomography for SAR <b>data</b> <b>interpretation</b> of dense urban areas.

40|$|We present our {{design for}} a cell biology course to {{integrate}} content with scientific practices, specifically <b>data</b> <b>interpretation</b> and model-based reasoning. A 2 -yr research project within this course allowed us to understand how students interpret authentic biological data in this setting. Through analysis of written work, we measured {{the extent to which}} students' <b>data</b> <b>interpretations</b> were valid and/or generative. By analyzing small-group audio recordings during in-class activities, we demonstrated how students used instructor-provided models to build and refine <b>data</b> <b>interpretations.</b> Often, students used models to broaden the scope of <b>data</b> <b>interpretations,</b> tying conclusions to a biological significance. Coding analysis revealed several strategies and challenges that were common among students in this collaborative setting. Spontaneous argumentation was present in 82 % of transcripts, suggesting that <b>data</b> <b>interpretation</b> using models may be a way to elicit this important disciplinary practice. Argumentation dialogue included frequent co-construction of claims backed by evidence from data. Other common strategies included collaborative decoding of data representations and noticing data patterns before making interpretive claims. Focusing on irrelevant data patterns was the most common challenge. Our findings provide evidence to support the feasibility of supporting students' data-interpretation skills within a large lecture course...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectiveControversial and {{misleading}} <b>interpretation</b> of <b>data</b> from randomized trials is common. How to avoid misleading interpretation has received little attention. Herein, we describe two applications of {{an approach that}} involves blinded interpretation of the results by study investigators. Study Design and SettingsThe approach involves developing two interpretations of the results {{on the basis of}} a blinded review of the primary outcome data (experimental treatment A compared with control treatment B). One interpretation assumes that A is the experimental intervention and another assumes that A is the control. After agreeing that there will be no further changes, the investigators record their decisions and sign the resulting document. The randomization code is then broken, the correct interpretation chosen, and the manuscript finalized. Review of the document by an external authority before finalization can provide another safeguard against interpretation bias. ResultsWe found the blinded preparation of a summary of <b>data</b> <b>interpretation</b> described in this article practical, efficient, and useful. ConclusionsBlinded <b>data</b> <b>interpretation</b> may decrease the frequency of misleading <b>data</b> <b>interpretation.</b> Widespread adoption of blinded <b>data</b> <b>interpretation</b> would be greatly facilitated were it added to the minimum set of recommendations outlining proper conduct of randomized controlled trials (eg, the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials statement) ...|$|R
40|$|The recently-introduced Orbitrap Fusion mass {{spectrometry}} permits {{various types of}} MS 2 acquisition methods. To date, these different MS 2 strategies and the optimal <b>data</b> <b>interpretation</b> approach for each have not been adequately evaluated. This study comprehensively investigated the four MS 2 strategies: HCD-OT (higher-energy-collisional-dissociation with Orbitrap detection), HCD-IT (HCD with ion trap, IT), CID-IT (collision-induced-dissociation with IT) and CID-OT on Orbitrap Fusion. To achieve extensive comparison and identify the optimal <b>data</b> <b>interpretation</b> method for each technique, several search engines (SEQUEST and Mascot) and post-processing methods (score-based, PeptideProphet, and Percolator) were assessed for all techniques {{for the analysis of}} a human cell proteome. It was found that divergent conclusions could be made from the same dataset when different <b>data</b> <b>interpretation</b> approaches were used and therefore requiring a relatively fair comparison among techniques. Percolator was chosen for comparison of techniques because it performs the best among all search engines and MS 2 strategies. For the analysis of human cell proteome using individual MS 2 strategies, the highest number of identifications was achieved by HCD-OT, followed by HCD-IT and CID-IT. Based on these results, we concluded that a relatively fair platform for <b>data</b> <b>interpretation</b> is necessary to avoid divergent conclusions from the same dataset, and HCD-OT and HCD-IT may be preferable for protein/peptide identification using Orbitrap Fusion...|$|R
