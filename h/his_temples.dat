5|$|Khandoba is also {{a figure}} of respect and worship to Muslims, and this {{affiliation}} is visible {{in the style of}} <b>his</b> <b>temples.</b> He is called Mallu or Ajmat Khan (Rautray) by Muslim devotees, and many times portrayed as being a Muslim himself in this context. The latter is believed to conferred upon by the Mughal invader king Aurangzeb, who was forced to flee from Jejuri by Khandoba's power. Some of these distinguishing Muslim features include his usual appearance as that of a Paṭhān on horseback, one of his wives being a Muslim, and that his horse-keeper is a Muslim in Jejuri. The Mārtaṇḍa Vijaya expressly states that his devotees are mainly Muslims. The worship of Khandoba had received royal patronage by Ibrahim II, which consisted of the reinstatement of the annual jatra and the right of pilgrims to perform rituals at the Naldurg temple. Malhari Mahatmya even records Muslims (mleccha) as the god's bhaktas (devotees), who call him as Malluka Pathan or Mallu Khan. In Jejuri, a Muslim family traditionally looks after the horses of the god.|$|E

25|$|In many places, temples were consecrated in {{conjunction}} with Aphrodite, as in Attica, Arcadia, Crete, Samos and in Magna Graecia. Several ex-votos found in <b>his</b> <b>temples</b> revealed his role as initiator of young adulthood, among them soldiers and hunters, since war and certain forms of hunting were seen as ceremonial initiatory ordeals. This function of Hermes explains why some images in temples and other vessels show him as a teenager.|$|E

The Tomkins called the police and allegedly removed the noose from Boland's neck before they arrived. The police took Boland to Goondiwindi police station and charged him with break and enter.|$|E
25|$|After Kutuzov became Governor-General of Crimea in 1787, the Russo-Turkish War of 1787–1792 began. He {{was again}} {{severely}} wounded in 1788 during the Siege of Ochakov when a bullet was shot through both of <b>his</b> <b>temples.</b> Kutuzov {{came back a}} year later, {{taking part in the}} Battle of Rymnik and Siege of Izmail. Near the end of the war, he led a decisive charge at the Battle of Măcin. Kutuzov was on good terms with Tsar Paul, but had disputes with his successor Tsar Alexander. In 1805, he led Russian forces alongside Austria during the Napoleonic Wars. The allied Russo-Austrian army was defeated by Napoleon at the Battle of Austerlitz. Alexander blamed Kutuzov and demoted him to Moldova for the Russo-Turkish War of 1806–1812. Kutuzov vanquished a four-times larger Turkish army at Rousse and brought an end to the war with a decisive victory at the Battle of the Danube. For his achievements, he was awarded the titles of count and prince.|$|E

The highest voice begins the second sequence, and the other voices enter in closer succession, one or two measures apart. Gardiner interprets the polyphony as [...] "conjuring before us the elegant tracery of those 'temples' which God promises to make of our souls". The first part is repeated as da capo.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the oldest}} places of worship for Hermes was Mount Cyllene in Arcadia, where the myth says that he was born. Tradition says that his first temple was built by Lycaon.

2500|$|One day {{he asked}} me to do his portrait.

His face with clearly demarcated surfaces that made up a passionate interplay of facets, his hair in dark masses projecting lightly in waves over <b>his</b> <b>temples,</b> his solidly constructed body - straightaway suggested to me equivalences, echoes , interpenetrations, rhythmic correspondences with the surrounding elements, fields, trees, houses.

[...] A press account described the scene:He strode angrily toward O'Day, and the grandstand observed a lightning movement of the hands. [...] Mystic symbol followed mystic symbol, and the crowd kept guessing, what it meant. [...] Suddenly O'Day, too, strode forward and majestically waved Mr. Taylor from the field.

2500|$|In general, Janus is at {{the origin}} of time as the {{guardian}} of the gates of Heaven: Jupiter himself can move forth and back because of Janus's working. In one of <b>his</b> <b>temples,</b> probably that of Forum Holitorium, {{the hands of his}} statue were positioned to signify the number 355 (the number of days in a lunar year), later 365, symbolically expressing his mastership over time. [...] He presides over the concrete and abstract beginnings of the world, such as religion and the gods themselves, he too holds the access to Heaven and to other gods: this is the reason why men must invoke him first, regardless of the god they want to pray or placate. He is the initiator of human life, of new historical ages, and financial enterprises: according to myth {{he was the first to}} mint coins and the as, first coin of the liberal series, bears his effigy on one face.|$|E
2500|$|Asherah, {{formerly}} {{the wife of}} El, was worshipped as Yahweh's consort or mother; potsherds discovered at Khirbet el-Kôm and Kuntillet Ajrûd make reference to [...] "Yahweh and his Asherah", and various biblical passages indicate that her statues were kept in <b>his</b> <b>temples</b> in Jerusalem, Bethel, and Samaria. Yahweh may also have appropriated Anat, the wife of Baal, as his consort, as Anat-Yahu ("Anat of Yahu," [...] i.e., Yahweh) is mentioned in 5th century BCE records from the Jewish colony at Elephantine in Egypt. A goddess called the Queen of Heaven was also worshipped, probably a fusion of Astarte and the Mesopotamian goddess Ishtar, possibly a title of Asherah. Worship of Baal and Yahweh coexisted in the early period of Israel's history, but they were considered irreconcilable after the 9th century BCE, following the efforts of King Ahab and his queen Jezebel to elevate Baal {{to the status of}} national god, although the cult of Baal did continue for some time.|$|E
2500|$|The icon of Jagannath in <b>his</b> <b>temples</b> is {{a brightly}} painted, {{rough-hewn}} log of neem wood. The image {{consists of a}} square flat head, a pillar that represents his face merging with the chest. The icon lacks a neck, ears, and limbs, is identified by a large circular face symbolizing someone who is anadi (without beginning) and ananta (without end). Within this face are two big symmetric circular eyes with no eyelids, one eye symbolizing {{the sun and the}} other the moon, features traceable in 17th-century paintings. He is shown with an Urdhva Pundra, the Vaishnava U-shaped mark on his forehead. His dark color and other facial features are an abstraction of the cosmic form of the Hindu god Krishna, states Starza. In some contemporary Jagannath temples, two stumps pointing forward in hug-giving position represent his hands. In some exceptional medieval and modern era paintings in museums outside India, such as in Berlin states Starza, Jagannath is shown [...] "fully anthropomorphised" [...] but with the traditional abstract mask face.|$|E
