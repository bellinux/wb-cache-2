The statute then gives the equity purchaser (or its successor) twenty days to reconvey the property on the condition of repayment of any consideration paid to the equity seller. HEPTA does not affect the rights of a bona-fide purchaser or <b>encumbrancer</b> for value if their conveyance occurred before the recording of the notice of rescission.|$|E
50|$|The Encumbered Estates' Court was {{established}} {{by an act of}} the British Parliament in 1849, to facilitate the sale of Irish estates whose owners, because of the Great Famine, were unable to meet their obligations. It was given authority to sell estates on application from either the owner or an <b>encumbrancer</b> (somebody who had a claim on it) and, after the sale, distribute the proceeds among the creditors, granting clear title to the new owners. In 1858, the court's functions were assumed by the Landed Estates Court, which, in turn, was replaced by the Land Commission that was set up under the 1881 Land Act.|$|E

40|$|Where {{a senior}} {{creditor}} {{has access to}} two funds from the same debtor to satisfy its claims and the junior creditor has access to {{only one of these}} funds, it could be equitable to expect that the senior creditor satisfy itself out of the fund in which the junior creditor does not have an interest. Where a court makes an order based on this principle, it has invoked the doctrine of marshalling, sometimes called the two-fund rule. 2 ̆ 7 Marshalling is an equitable doctrine and therein lies its strengths and weaknesses. Equity gives it its flexibility, adaptibility and utility. Equity also gives it its uncertainty and lack of clear boundaries. Marshalling is used to prevent the arbitrary action of a senior creditor from destroying the rights or expectations of a junior creditor or a creditor with less security. It is used to lessen the chance that a junior creditor may lose its security solely at the whim of the senior creditor 2 ̆ 7 s choice of property to pursue. Marshalling is not based on the law of contracts or liens. It is founded instead in equity, being designed to promote fair dealing and justice. Equity has its limits. Use of the doctrine of marshalling is common in several different areas of the law. It is frequently used in the administration of estates to help determine the distribution of assets.
