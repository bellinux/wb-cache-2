5|$|Selective <b>glucocorticoid</b> {{receptor}} modulators (SEGRMs) {{and selective}} <b>glucocorticoid</b> receptor agonists (SEGRAs) {{formerly known as}} dissociated <b>glucocorticoid</b> receptor agonists (DIGRAs) are a class of experimental drugs designed to share many of the desirable anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, or anticancer properties of classical <b>glucocorticoid</b> drugs but with fewer side effects such as skin atrophy. Although preclinical evidence on SEGRAMs’ anti-inflammatory effects are culminating, currently, the efficacy of these SEGRAMs on cancer are largely unknown.|$|E

5|$|Both non-selective {{glucocorticoids}} {{and selective}} <b>glucocorticoid</b> receptor agonists work by binding to and activating the <b>glucocorticoid</b> receptor (GR).

40|$|Background: Common belief {{holds that}} as topical <b>glucocorticoids</b> are used {{over time the}} less {{effective}} they become, a phenomenon called tolerance or tachyphylaxis. Objective: To determine what evidence supports the concept of tachyphylaxis to <b>glucocorticoids.</b> Methods: We searched Medline and Google Scholar for articles on tachyphylaxis to <b>glucocorticoids</b> published through October 2012. Results: Rapid tolerance, tachyphylaxis, to non-clinical effects of <b>glucocorticoids</b> {{has been reported in}} literature. However, clinically significant tolerance to topical <b>glucocorticoids</b> has not been identified in clinical trials. We did not identify any evidence that clinical efficacy of <b>glucocorticoids</b> in inflammatory skin diseases significantly diminishes during long term continuous use. Limitations: Tachyphylaxis or tolerance to clinical effects of topical <b>glucocorticoids</b> in inflammatory skin diseases is not fully characterized or well studied. Conclusion: Based on available data in literature, there is no clinical trial supporting the concept that topical <b>glucocorticoids</b> lose effectiveness over time, nor that intermittent use of topical <b>glucocorticoids</b> is more effective than continuous use...|$|R
40|$|Hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) {{hyperactivity}} {{is observed}} in many patients suffering from {{depression and the}} mechanism underling the dysfunction of HPA axis is not well understood. Chronic stress has a causal relationship with the hyperactivity of HPA axis. Stress induces the over-synthesis of <b>glucocorticoids,</b> which will arrive at all the body containing the brain. It is still complicated whether <b>glucocorticoids</b> account for chronic stress-induced HPA axis hyperactivity and in which {{part of the brain}} the <b>glucocorticoids</b> account for chronic stress-induced HPA axis hyperactivity. Here, we demonstrated that <b>glucocorticoids</b> were indispensable and sufficient for chronic stress-induced hyperactivity of HPA axis. Although acute <b>glucocorticoids</b> elevation in the hippocampus and hypothalamus exerted a negative regulation of HPA axis, we found that chronic <b>glucocorticoids</b> elevation in the hippocampus but not in the hypothalamus accounted for chronic stress-induced hyperactivity of HPA axis. Chronic <b>glucocorticoids</b> exposure in the hypothalamus still exerted a negative regulation of HPA axis activity. More importantly, we found mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) - neuronal nitric oxide synthesis enzyme (nNOS) - nitric oxide (NO) pathway mediated the different roles of <b>glucocorticoids</b> in the hippocampus and hypothalamus in regulating HPA axis activity. This study suggests that the <b>glucocorticoids</b> in the hippocampus {{play an important role in}} the development of HPA axis hyperactivity and the <b>glucocorticoids</b> in the hypothalamus can’t induc...|$|R

5|$|Congenital adrenal {{hyperplasia}} is a congenital {{disease in}} which mutations of enzymes that produce steroid hormones {{result in a}} <b>glucocorticoid</b> deficiency and malfunction of the negative feedback loop of the HPA axis. In the HPA axis, cortisol (a <b>glucocorticoid)</b> inhibits the release of CRH and ACTH, hormones that in turn stimulate corticosteroid synthesis. As cortisol cannot be synthesized, these hormones are released in high quantities and stimulate production of other adrenal steroids instead. The {{most common form of}} congenital adrenal hyperplasia is due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. 21-hydroxylase is necessary for production of both mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids, but not androgens. Therefore, ACTH stimulation of the adrenal cortex induces the release of excessive amounts of adrenal androgens, which can lead to the development of ambiguous genitalia and secondary sex characteristics.|$|E
5|$|A {{complication}} seen in untreated Addison's {{disease and}} other types of primary adrenal insufficiency is the adrenal crisis, a medical emergency in which low <b>glucocorticoid</b> and mineralocorticoid levels result in hypovolemic shock and symptoms such as vomiting and fever. An adrenal crisis can progressively lead to stupor and coma. The management of adrenal crises includes the application of hydrocortisone injections.|$|E
40|$|<b>Glucocorticoids</b> exert {{profound}} and diverse physiological effects {{on a wide}} range of cell types. Produced and released from the adrenal cortex in response to stress, levels of <b>glucocorticoids</b> are under the control of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. <b>Glucocorticoids</b> participate in numerous physiological processes such as glucose homeostasis; protein, lipid, and carbohydrate metabolism; development; neuorobiology; and programmed cell death. <b>Glucocorticoids</b> exert potent immunosuppressive and antiinflammatory actions in a cell type–specific manner largely through the interruption of cytokine-mediated pathways. These antiinflammatory actions are also complemented by the ability of <b>glucocorticoids</b> to induce apoptosis in many cells including thymocytes, blood monocytes, and peripheral T cells. As a class of drugs, <b>glucocorticoids</b> are among the most widely prescribed in the world for the treatment of immune and inflammator...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the effect of <b>glucocorticoids</b> on gastrin secretion, plasma gastrin levels were measured by radioimmunoassay in patients with Cushing's syndrome and those treated with <b>glucocorticoids.</b> Fasting plasma gastrin levels were significantly higher in these patients than in normal subjects, with exaggerated response to food. Conversely, short-term treatment or intravenous infusion of <b>glucocorticoids</b> had no significant influence on gastrin secretion in normal subjects. The possible mechanism by which <b>glucocorticoids</b> cause hypergastrinaemia are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the risk of}} cardiovascular disease in patients with rheumatoid arthritis exposed to <b>glucocorticoids.</b> Methods: Retrospective analysis of exposure to <b>glucocorticoids</b> in a prospective cohort of 353 patients with rheumatoid arthritis followed from June 2001 up to November 2011 for incident cardiovascular disease in a hospital-based outpatient cohort in the Netherlands. Hazard ratios with 95 %-confidence intervals were calculated for the association between different types of exposure to <b>glucocorticoids</b> and incident cardiovascular disease. Associations were adjusted for demographics, cardiovascular risk factors and disease related parameters. Results: Recent and current exposure to <b>glucocorticoids</b> were associated with incident cardiovascular disease, as was a longer duration of exposure and cumulative exposure to <b>glucocorticoids.</b> Adjustment for disease activity and severity negated the association. Conclusion: In observational studies the finding of incident cardiovascular disease in patients with rheumatoid arthritis exposed to <b>glucocorticoids</b> is strongly confounded by indication due to high disease activity. The adverse cardiovascular effects of <b>glucocorticoids</b> might be balanced by positive effects working through inflammation control...|$|R
5|$|Addison's disease {{refers to}} primary hypoadrenalism, {{which is a}} {{deficiency}} in <b>glucocorticoid</b> and mineralocorticoid production by the adrenal gland. In the Western world, Addison's disease is most commonly an autoimmune condition, in which the body produces antibodies against cells of the adrenal cortex. Worldwide, the disease is more frequently caused by infection, especially from tuberculosis. A distinctive feature of Addison's disease is hyperpigmentation of the skin, which presents with other nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue.|$|E
5|$|In {{secondary}} adrenal insufficiency, a dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis {{leads to}} decreased {{stimulation of the}} adrenal cortex. Apart from suppression of the axis by <b>glucocorticoid</b> therapy, {{the most common cause}} of secondary adrenal insufficiency are tumors that affect the production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) by the pituitary gland. This type of adrenal insufficiency usually does not affect the production of mineralocorticoids, which are under regulation of the renin-angiotensin system instead.|$|E
5|$|In vivo {{studies in}} {{mice and rats}} showed that a topically {{administered}} SEGRAM inhibited peroxidase activity and formation of oedema, both indicators of anti-inflammatory activity, comparably to prednisolone. Systemic administration in mice or rats indicate that SEGRAMs can diminish acute infections, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma and colitis. In vivo evidence on whether particular SEGRAMs can elicit similar effects than classic <b>glucocorticoid</b> in cancer pathologies is currently lacking.|$|E
40|$|<b>Glucocorticoids</b> {{have a major}} {{effect on}} food intake that is underappreciated, {{although}} the effects of <b>glucocorticoids</b> on metabolism and abdominal obesity are quite well understood. Physiologically appropriate concentrations of naturally secreted corticosteroids (cortisol in humans, corticosterone in rats) have major stimulatory effects on caloric intake and, {{in the presence of}} insulin, preference. We first address the close relationship between <b>glucocorticoids</b> and energy balance under both normal and abnormal conditions. Because excess caloric intake is stored in different fat depots, we also address the systemic effects of <b>glucocorticoids</b> on redistribution of stored energy preponderantly into intraabdominal fat depots. We provide strong evidence that <b>glucocorticoids</b> modify feeding and then discuss the role of insulin on the choice of ingested calories, as well as suggesting some central neural pathways that may be involved in these actions of <b>glucocorticoids</b> and insulin. Finally, we discuss the evolutionary utility of these actions of the stress hormones, and how dysregulatory effects of chronically elevated <b>glucocorticoids</b> may occur in our modern, rich societie...|$|R

40|$|<b>Glucocorticoids</b> and {{acidosis}} stimulate {{protein and}} amino acid catabolism in vivo. We {{have shown that}} chronic metabolic acidosis in awake rats accelerates whole body protein turnover using stochastic modeling and a continuous infusion of L-[1 - 13 C] leucine. To delineate the role that <b>glucocorticoids</b> play in mediating these catabolic responses, we measured protein turnover in awake, chronically catheterized, adrenalectomized rats in {{the presence or absence}} of <b>glucocorticoids</b> and/or a NH 4 Cl feeding regimen which induced chronic metabolic acidosis. In adrenalectomized rats receiving no <b>glucocorticoids</b> there was no statistical difference in amino acid oxidation, protein degradation or synthesis whether or not the rats had acidosis. In contrast, chronically acidotic, adrenalectomized rats receiving <b>glucocorticoids</b> demonstrated accelerated whole body protein turnover with a 84 % increase in amino acid oxidation and a 26 % increase in protein degradation, compared to rats not receiving <b>glucocorticoids</b> or those given the same dose of <b>glucocorticoids</b> but without acidosis. We conclude that metabolic acidosis accelerates amino acid oxidation and protein degradation in vivo, and that <b>glucocorticoids</b> are necessary but not sufficient to mediate the catabolic effects of metabolic acidosis...|$|R
5|$|Cushing's {{syndrome}} is {{the manifestation of}} <b>glucocorticoid</b> excess. It can {{be the result of}} a prolonged treatment with glucocorticoids or be caused by an underlying disease which produces alterations in the HPA axis or the production of cortisol. Causes can be further classified into ACTH-dependent or ACTH-independent. The most common cause of endogenous Cushing's {{syndrome is}} a pituitary adenoma which causes an excessive production of ACTH. The disease produces a wide variety of signs and symptoms which include obesity, diabetes, increased blood pressure, excessive body hair (hirsutism), osteoporosis, depression and, most distinctively, stretch marks in the skin, caused by its progressive thinning.|$|E
5|$|Some {{evidence}} supports {{the use of}} intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Immune suppression tends to be less effective than in other autoimmune diseases. Prednisolone (a <b>glucocorticoid</b> or steroid) suppresses the immune response, and the steroid-sparing agent azathioprine may replace it once therapeutic effect has been achieved. IVIG may be used {{with a degree of}} effectiveness. Plasma exchange (or plasmapheresis), the removal of plasma proteins such as antibodies and replacement with normal plasma, may provide improvement in acute severe weakness. Again, plasma exchange is less effective than in other related conditions such as myasthenia gravis, and additional immunosuppressive medication is often needed.|$|E
5|$|The {{hippocampus}} contains {{high levels}} of <b>glucocorticoid</b> receptors, which make it more vulnerable to long-term stress than most other brain areas. There is evidence that humans having experienced severe, long-lasting traumatic stress show atrophy of the hippocampus more than of {{other parts of the}} brain. These effects show up in post-traumatic stress disorder, and they may contribute to the hippocampal atrophy reported in schizophrenia and severe depression. A recent study has also revealed atrophy as a result of depression, but this can be stopped with anti-depressants even if they are not effective in relieving other symptoms.|$|E
40|$|Tenascin, a {{predominantly}} mesenchymal extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoprotein has a rather restricted tissue distribution, but until now factors that inhibit its expression {{have not been}} identified. <b>Glucocorticoids</b> {{are known to be}} beneficial for establishment of myelopoiesis in long-term bone marrow cultures. Tenascin was found to be expressed in the bone marrow, and <b>glucocorticoids</b> were found to affect bone marrow tenascin expression. Both tenascin mRNAs and the mRNA of another ECM protein, laminin B 1 chain, were drastically downregulated by <b>glucocorticoids</b> during initiation of bone marrow cultures. However, in already established long-term cultures <b>glucocorticoids</b> did not affect laminin B 1 chain mRNA levels although tenascin mRNAs continued to be downregulated. Studies with a stromal cell line (MC 3 T 3 -G 2 /PA 6) and fibroblasts (3 T 3) suggested that <b>glucocorticoids</b> act directly on the stromal cells that produce tenascin. In 3 T 3 cells this downregulation occurred within 12 h of glucocorticoid-treatment, suggesting that <b>glucocorticoids</b> acted through cis regulatory elements of the tenascin gene. We suggest that <b>glucocorticoids</b> in part regulate hematopoiesis by modifying the ECM. Furthermore, downregulation of tenascin expression by <b>glucocorticoids</b> may in part explain the restricted tissue distribution of tenascin in other tissues...|$|R
40|$|<b>Glucocorticoids</b> have a bimodal {{effect on}} cognition, hippocampal {{pyramidal}} neurons and long-term potentiation (LTP). Transient increases in <b>glucocorticoids</b> improve performance at spatial memory tasks and facilitate synaptic efficacy, {{depending on the}} context. On the other hand, long-term elevations of <b>glucocorticoids</b> are associated with decreased cognitive performance, attenuated synaptic efficacy and neuronal atrophy. Elevation of <b>glucocorticoids</b> during aging is also associated with mild cognitive impairment and hippocampal atrophy. Caloric restriction (CR), a dietary manipulation which extends life-span in rodents, also increases free plasma corticosterone. Recent data suggests that CR attenuates many brain aging changes and increases resistance of neurons to toxins and injury. Thus, a paradox may be considered: if CR causes chronic elevation of <b>glucocorticoids,</b> and if <b>glucocorticoids</b> can {{increase the risk of}} neurodegeneration, how can CR be neuroprotective. We suggest that the neuroprotective effects of CR outweigh the deleterious effects of <b>glucocorticoids.</b> The neuroprotective effects of CR that are discussed here include decreased plasma glucose, attenuated free radical generation, alterations of the vasculature, increased expression of heat shock proteins and neurotrophic factors, and attenuation of age-related glial activation...|$|R
2500|$|<b>Glucocorticoids</b> {{may be used}} in low doses in adrenal insufficiency. In {{much higher}} doses, oral or inhaled <b>glucocorticoids</b> are used to {{suppress}} various allergic, inflammatory, and autoimmune disorders. Inhaled <b>glucocorticoids</b> are the second-line treatment for asthma. They are also administered as post-transplantory immunosuppressants to prevent the acute transplant rejection and the graft-versus-host disease. Nevertheless, they do not prevent an infection and also inhibit later reparative processes. [...] Newly emerging evidence showed that <b>glucocorticoids</b> could be used in the treatment of heart failure to increase the renal responsiveness to diuretics and natriuretic peptides. <b>Glucocorticoids</b> are historically used for pain relief in inflammatory conditions. However, corticosteroids show limited efficacy in pain relief and potential adverse events for their use in tendinopathies.|$|R
5|$|Cortisol is {{the main}} <b>glucocorticoid</b> in humans. In species that do not create cortisol, this role is played by {{corticosterone}} instead. Glucocorticoids have many effects on metabolism. As their name suggests, they increase the circulating level of glucose. This {{is the result of}} an increase in the mobilization of amino acids from protein and the stimulation of synthesis of glucose from these amino acids in the liver. In addition, they increase the levels of free fatty acids, which cells can use as an alternative to glucose to obtain energy. Glucocorticoids also have effects unrelated to the regulation of blood sugar levels, including the suppression of the immune system and a potent anti-inflammatory effect. Cortisol reduces the capacity of osteoblasts to produce new bone tissue and decreases the absorption of calcium in the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E
5|$|Glucocorticoids {{are under}} the {{regulatory}} influence of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. <b>Glucocorticoid</b> synthesis is stimulated by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), a hormone released into the bloodstream by the anterior pituitary. In turn, production of ACTH is stimulated {{by the presence of}} corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which is released by neurons of the hypothalamus. ACTH acts on the adrenal cells first by increasing the levels of StAR within the cells, and then of all steroidogenic P450 enzymes. The HPA axis {{is an example of a}} negative feedback system, in which cortisol itself acts as a direct inhibitor of both CRH and ACTH synthesis. The HPA axis also interacts with the immune system through increased secretion of ACTH at the presence of certain molecules of the inflammatory response.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{transcriptional}} regulation of EFS, but several transcriptional regulators for EFS have been proposed based on consensus binding sites in its promoter region for ATF (Activating transcription factor), NF-κβ, NF-κβ1, GATA-3, C/EBPα (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha), <b>glucocorticoid</b> receptors α and β, and p53. Expression of isoforms 1 and 2 has been detected in multiple tissues, with maximal expression in the placenta, and the embryonal central nervous system, heart, testes and lungs. Although its expression has been reported as lower in thymus and lymphocytes, functional studies of EFS to date have best defined it as important for immune system function. One screen for implantation-related genes regulated by progesterone found that EFS was downregulated by 17β-estradiol and progesterone in explants of late proliferative phase endometrium.|$|E
40|$|First {{described}} for their metabolic and immunosuppressive effects, <b>glucocorticoids</b> are widely prescribed in clinical settings of inflammation.

Interestingly, several cell types have an anti-apoptotic response to <b>glucocorticoids</b> that is cytoprotective. Lastly, we will discuss the pro- and anti-apoptotic effects of <b>glucocorticoids</b> in cancers and their clinical implications...|$|R

40|$|Giant cell {{arteritis}} {{is usually}} a self-limiting disease with a variable duration of months to years. However, in a subset of patients the disease may follow a protracted course, requiring long-term treatment with <b>glucocorticoids.</b> To date, <b>glucocorticoids</b> are the only agents whose efficacy has been unquestionably proven. More specifically, they can both improve the clinical symptoms of giant cell arteritis and also prevent its complications, including visual loss. <b>Glucocorticoids</b> therapy is notoriously fraught with numerous side effects, therefore it is sensible to taper <b>glucocorticoids</b> as quickly as possible. Flares are not uncommon and tend often to occur upon tapering of <b>glucocorticoids</b> dosage or on withdrawal of <b>glucocorticoids</b> therapy. However, in most cases flares are mild and appear to respond favorably {{to an increase in}} <b>glucocorticoids</b> dosage or reintroduction of <b>glucocorticoids</b> therapy, respectively. Mortality rates of giant cell arteritis patients are comparable to those of the general population, but there is evidence for an increased frequency of potentially life-threatening ischemic events, such as myocardial infarction and cerebro-vascular accidents, especially early on in the disease course. The risk conferred by the disease appears to decrease with time, presumably as a consequence of <b>glucocorticoids</b> treatment, whereas it can remain significantly elevated in patients whose disease activity is not sufficiently controlled by the treatment. By contrast, {{there is no evidence that}} giant cell arteritis is associated with an increased prevalence of malignancies or that it may represent a paraneoplastic syndrome...|$|R
