[...] Hughes interviewed Hedren and members of Hitchcock's crew before preparing a script. She described her discussions with Hedren: [...] "Her wisdom and insights have helped me to put her real life ordeal on to the screen. I know Tippi is absolutely thrilled, as I am, with the casting of Sienna Miller to play her." [...] The film's title was inspired by the name Hitchcock used for Hedren after she stopped working for him.|$|E

Lennon offered instead to perform at the festival, bringing his own band, the Plastic Ono Band." [...] Brower agreed, and Lennon quickly assembled a band. He initially approached Beatles band-mate George Harrison to play lead guitar, but Harrison turned him down, so Eric Clapton (who had played guitar in Lennon's earlier live group, the Dirty Mac) was chosen instead. Lennon hastily assembled the rest of the band, consisting of Klaus Voormann, and drummer Alan White, as well as their assistants, Anthony Fawcett, Terry Doran, and Jill and Dan Richter, to accompany himself and Ono.

[...] Regarding his entrance, Cameron stated that [...] "The guys made me feel real welcome and it wasn't a struggle to get it musically, but my style was a little bit different, I think, than what they were used to. And they've been through so many different drummers, I don't even know if they knew what they wanted. So, I just kind of played the way I played and then eventually we kind of figured out what worked best for the band." ...|$|E

Prior to filming the video, or releasing the single, Carey had toned her body, and lost a reported twenty pounds. Due to her slim-down, she and Ratner wanted to flaunt Carey's new figure {{as much as possible}} throughout the video: [...] "Mariah looks better than she has ever looked. It's ridiculous. Mariah has an incredible body, but she was always kind of very voluptuous. Now she's just like, fit. And we were like, we've got to show this body." [...] As the pair came up with the video's plot, Ratner contacted McBrayer to play a male leading role, alongside Carey. After receiving the call, McBrayer claimed he was so shocked by the proposal, that he didn't believe it at first. He only met with the producers after Ratner personally called him and assured him the authenticity of the offer. In an interview with MTV News, McBrayer joked [...] "I'm always worried now that somebody is pranking me, so at first I was very leery. But when I heard it was legit, and then later on we <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>phone</b> call from Brett Ratner, who directed it. I was like, 'This is either a very elaborate prank, or this is the real deal.'" [...] In the fantasy-themed story, he recalled what he considered the video's most memorable scene, in which he and Carey, dressed in medieval attire, were walking with a unicorn. Additionally, he described the filming process as very simple, as they were given very loose directions and pointers. McBrayer claimed that during one take, they were meant to play Frisbee on the mansion lawn, and he accidentally threw it at Carey's face, jokingly adding [...] "by the time she spins back around — bonk, right in her face. I threw a Frisbee in Mariah Carey's face! I'm like, I'm fired!." [...] When questioned by critics regarding the song and video, Carey responded [...] "Have you seen the 'Touch My Body' video? C'mon.

40|$|Abstract: Purpose: This {{prospective}} {{case series}} evaluates the outcome, {{and the return}} to sports of young overhead athletes with a persistent, symptomatic multidirectional instability (MDI) with hyperlaxity type Gerber B 5 treated with an arthroscopic anteroposteroinferior capsular plication and rotator interval closure. Methods: 9 young overhead athletes (10 shoulders) with the rare diagnosis of MDI (Gerber B 5) and an indication for operative treatment, after a failed physiotherapy program were physically examined 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively by a physical examination, and <b>got</b> <b>a</b> final <b>phone</b> interview after median 39 months. Results: At the final follow-up all patients were satisfied; Rowe Score showed 7 “excellent ” and “good ” results; Constant Score was “excellent ” and “good ” in 6, and “fair ” in 1 patient. 7 / 9 returned to their previous sports, 3 / 9 at a reduced level. Conclusion: Symptomatic MDI requires an individual indication for surgical treatment after a primary conservative treatment. The described arthroscopic technique stabilizes glenohumeral joint. A return to overhead sports is possible but often at a reduced level; returning to high-performance sports cannot be recommended {{because of the high}} risk of reinstability...|$|R
