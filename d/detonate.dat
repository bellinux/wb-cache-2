5|$|Many {{of these}} attacks against Americans were against Darlington personally. His son Christopher {{was hit by}} a grenade in July, though it did not <b>detonate.</b> The {{ambassador}} resigned his post on 26 July. It was not until 14 August 1965 that David M. Bane replaced him.|$|E
50|$|Five {{bombs were}} <b>detonated</b> in Mahabodhi temple {{premises}} on 7 July 2013. 4 bombs were also <b>detonated</b> in town while three were defused.|$|R
5000|$|The {{next step}} in mining {{technology}} was <b>detonating</b> cord. Ensign-Bickford and other companies developed different versions of <b>detonating</b> cord. In 1937, Ensign-Bickford trademarked [...] "Primacord" [...] , which became the functional generic name for <b>detonating</b> cord in North America. In May 2003, Ensign-Bickford sold the trademarks and processes to Dyno Nobel Inc [...] of Australia (formerly of Norway).|$|R

5|$|Almost simultaneously, an {{explosion}} devastated the north {{wing of the}} Bath Consolidated School building, killing 36 schoolchildren and two teachers. Kehoe had used a timed detonator to ignite hundreds of pounds of dynamite and incendiary pyrotol, which he had secretly planted inside the school {{over the course of}} many months. As rescuers began working at the school, Kehoe drove up, stopped, and used a rifle to <b>detonate</b> dynamite inside his shrapnel-filled truck, killing himself, the school superintendent, and several others nearby, as well as injuring more bystanders. During rescue efforts at the school, searchers discovered an additional 500pounds (230kg) of unexploded dynamite and pyrotol connected to a timing device set to <b>detonate</b> {{at the same time as}} the first explosions; the material was hidden throughout the basement of the south wing. Kehoe had apparently intended to blow up and destroy the entire school.|$|E
5|$|Anderson and Dredd {{obtain the}} code to Ma-Ma's {{apartment}} from her computer expert and confront her. Ma-Ma tells Dredd that, {{in the case}} of her death, a device on her wrist will <b>detonate</b> explosives on the top floors, destroying the building. Dredd reasons that the detonator's signal will not reach the explosives from the ground floor, so he forces Ma-Ma to inhale Slo-Mo and throws her down the atrium to her death.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as these events, the Simpsons are {{attending}} an air show held at the base, before the signal on the big screen is interrupted by Bob, who threatens to <b>detonate</b> the nuclear bomb unless Springfield disables all television broadcasts. Upon hearing the announcement, everyone flees the airfield in panic, except for Bart and Lisa. Unable to locate Bob, Mayor Quimby decides to give in to Bob's ultimatum.|$|E
50|$|The {{detonation}} of Ivy Mike by the United States prompted Soviet retaliation, and the Soviets quickly {{attempted to}} catch up. Although the Soviet Union had <b>detonated</b> their RDS-6 around that same time, the RDS-6 was <b>detonated</b> via high powered explosives while Ivy Mike was <b>detonated</b> via radiation method. The Soviets then abandoned their layered cake method {{and focused on}} a two-stage bomb method.|$|R
50|$|Three militants {{were killed}} during the attack. Two <b>detonated</b> suicide belts and the third was shot by police, {{with many of the}} victims being killed when the attackers <b>detonated</b> their belts.|$|R
50|$|After leaving Ofotfjord, U-47 spotted and {{attacked}} HMS Warspite. One torpedo <b>detonated</b> {{ahead of the}} battleship, while another <b>detonated</b> far behind. U-47 spent the next hours submerged under persistent depth charge attack.|$|R
5|$|Because {{potassium}} {{reacts with}} water vapor in the air, {{it is usually}} stored under anhydrous mineral oil or kerosene. Unlike lithium and sodium, however, potassium should not be stored under oil for longer than 6 months, unless in an inert (oxygen free) atmosphere, or under vacuum. After prolonged storage in air dangerous shock-sensitive peroxides can form on the metal and under {{the lid of the}} container, and can <b>detonate</b> upon opening.|$|E
5|$|Before the Agency {{can pursue}} Rhoemer, he assaults Washington, D.C. and threatens to <b>detonate</b> viral bombs {{scattered}} across the city. Gabe battles several terrorists, including Mara Aramov, as he follows the trail of bombs across city streets, subways, Washington Park and finally Freedom Memorial where he must incinerate munitions expert Anton Girdeux to stop the final threat.|$|E
5|$|Bond dives {{after the}} {{submarine}}, boards it, and frees Jones. Following a fight, the submarine hits {{the bottom of}} the Bosphorus, causing its hull to rupture. Bond catches up with Renard and kills him after a lengthy fight in the submarine's reactor. Bond and Jones escape from the submarine, leaving the flooded reactor to <b>detonate</b> safely underwater.|$|E
50|$|The mine can be <b>detonated</b> by any {{mechanism}} that activates the blasting cap. There are field-expedient methods of <b>detonating</b> the mine by tripwire, or by a timer, {{but these are}} rarely used.|$|R
50|$|The Soviets <b>detonated</b> four high-altitude {{tests in}} 1961 and three in 1962. During the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, both the US and the USSR <b>detonated</b> several high-altitude nuclear explosions {{as a form}} of saber-rattling.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to normal fireworks / flares {{which can be}} <b>detonated,</b> white stars periodically appear during play. These can be captured and <b>detonated</b> along with an existing set of three or more flares. For each star captured in this fashion, the player earns a letter of the word [...] "Starmine". After collecting all eight letters, a large glowing Starmine is launched onto the screen. If the player captures it and <b>detonates</b> it with at least three colored flares, a time-limited bonus mode is entered where {{a large number of}} fireworks appear at a rapid pace. The more flares <b>detonated</b> along with the Starmine, the longer the bonus mode lasts.|$|R
5|$|In 2005, {{the station}} was subject of a {{terrorist}} attack. A non-Norwegian man had called the Norwegian police 7.49 in the morning, claiming that he had planted a bomb on the station which would <b>detonate</b> 8.00, eleven minutes later. All traffic on the Ã˜stfold Line was stopped, and the station investigated, but no bombs were found.|$|E
5|$|In 2009 {{a genetically}} {{enhanced}} nine-year-old female supersoldier designated as X5-452 (Geneva Locke) escapes along with eleven others from a secret U.S. government institution codenamed Manticore {{where they were}} born, raised, and trained to be soldiers and assassins. On June 1, 2009, months after X5-452's escape, terrorists <b>detonate</b> an electromagnetic pulse weapon in the atmosphere over the U.S. which destroys {{the vast majority of}} computer and communication systems, throwing the country into chaos.|$|E
5|$|Ismail Azmy's {{decision}} to <b>detonate</b> a {{bridge over the}} Sweetwater Canal on October 20 in order to stall an Israeli attack, in violation of direct orders not to do so, led to him being relieved of his command on October 25, {{three days after the}} ceasefire. Captain Asa Kadmoni, who was awarded Israel's highest military decoration for his actions on October 18, later returned his medal as a protest against his government's defense policy.|$|E
5000|$|Somali {{police arrested}} a {{suspicious}} driver. While {{waiting for a}} bomb disposal unit {{in front of the}} criminal investigations department a bomb in the car <b>detonated</b> injuring two police officers. Al-Shabab claimed the bomb was <b>detonated</b> remotely.|$|R
50|$|Groberg {{tackled the}} suicide bomber, who then <b>detonated</b> his device, sending Groberg flying 15 to 20 feet away. A second suicide bomber, who was {{hidden behind a}} small structure, {{instantly}} <b>detonated</b> his device; according to the Army, he <b>detonated</b> prematurely because of Groberg's actions to stop the first bomber. Three U.S. military personnel and a U.S. Foreign Service Officer from the U.S. Agency for International Development were killed and several others were injured.|$|R
50|$|On 24 June, the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) <b>detonated</b> a {{car bomb}} in Newtownhamilton. On 1 August, {{following}} a telephoned warning, a RIRA car bomb <b>detonated</b> in the centre of Banbridge, injuring two RUC officers and 33 civilians.|$|R
5|$|Privates Vasquez (Jenette Goldstein) and Drake are smartgunners on the Sulaco. One {{of the few}} {{survivors}} of {{the assault on the}} hive, she helps seal off the complex from the Aliens.

When Gorman returns to help her, they are surrounded; she delivers a fond parting quip, and they <b>detonate</b> a grenade.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{opens with}} FBI special agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) {{bleeding}} {{out from a}} gunshot wound while Scully tends to him. They are revealed to be hostages in a bank holdup, and Scully attempts to reason with their captor (Darren E. Burrows), only to have him reveal a bomb strapped to his chest. The police begin to storm the building, prompting the gunman to <b>detonate</b> the bomb, seemingly killing them all.|$|E
5|$|The {{objective}} in a detonation level is to plant and <b>detonate</b> explosive devices {{on a number}} of enemy positions, which can consist of anti-aircraft guns, tanks and armored cars. Some positions must be hit twice for them to be destroyed. Players can protect their positions by defusing the explosives before they <b>detonate.</b> In one variation of this game mode, one side has to defend their positions for a set amount of time, with the destruction of each piece of equipment giving the enemy team more time. The defenders win if they can hold their positions long enough for the time to run out, while the attackers win when all objectives have been destroyed. In the alternate version, both teams must attack the other's objectives while defending their own. The first team to destroy all of the enemy's equipment wins.|$|E

50|$|BUTTERNUT {{predicted}} fallout, surface radiological exclusion areas (radex), ship positions, {{and aircraft}} participation. Butternut was <b>detonated</b> at 0615 on 12 May 1958, 25 minutes after FIR had been <b>detonated</b> at Enewetak. BUTTERNUT was <b>detonated</b> on a barge 4.000 feet (1.22 km) west of Runit, producing a yield range of 81 kt. The cloud rose to 35,000 feet (10.7 km), stabilizing at 30,000 feet (9.1 km). The DOD-sponsored experiments for BUTTERNUT were Projects 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 6.5, 6.6, and 6.9.|$|R
2500|$|... 31 August 1993: the IRA <b>detonated</b> a car-bomb at a {{shopping}} centre in South Belfast, causing over 1million pounds worth of damage. In a separate attack in Ardoyne, two British soldiers were wounded when the IRA <b>detonated</b> a car-bomb near their patrol.|$|R
5|$|About 20 {{minutes before}} the plane landed, on its final descent, he {{secretly}} ignited a small explosive device consisting of a mix of plastic explosive powder and acid. Abdulmutallab apparently had a packet of the plastic explosive sewn to his underwear, and injected liquid acid from a syringe into the packet to cause a chemical reaction. While {{there was a small}} explosion and fire, the device failed to <b>detonate</b> properly. Passengers heard popping noises resembling firecrackers, smelled an odor, and saw the suspect's pants, leg and the wall of the plane on fire.|$|E
5|$|Although one bomb did <b>detonate,</b> Harry Pearce (Peter Firth) {{views the}} {{operation}} a success, {{as the other}} three did not, and no civilians were killed. Ben tells Lucas he was right about Jawad; he chose to become a bomber over seeing his family. Lucas receives a call from Marlin, who asks to meet with him. During the confrontation, Marlin admits {{he was forced to}} become Mr. Big when terrorists kidnapped his family. Now knowing he has failed, he commits suicide.|$|E
5|$|Attacks {{against the}} Han River pontoon bridges at Seoul {{do not seem}} to have been {{successful}} until FEAF ordered the Bomber Command to lay delayed action bombs alongside the bridges on August 27, set to <b>detonate</b> at night. This method of attack seems to have caused such heavy casualties among the North Korean labor force trying to keep the pontoons in repair that they finally abandoned the effort. These bridges remained unfinished when the UN forces recaptured Seoul later in the year.|$|E
