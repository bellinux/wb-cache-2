In April, 1987 Nedza resigned his position as committeeman of the 31st ward in Chicago and named Berrios as his replacement.

5|$|Sixteen people, {{including}} Taylor, {{were eventually}} <b>indicted</b> <b>in</b> {{the assassination of}} Governor Goebel. Three accepted immunity from prosecution in exchange for testimony. Only five ever went to trial, two of those being acquitted. Convictions were handed down against Taylor's Secretary of State Caleb Powers, Henry Youtsey, and Jim Howard. The prosecution charged that Powers was the mastermind, having a political opponent killed so that his boss, Governor Taylor, could stay in office. Youtsey was an alleged intermediary, and Howard, who {{was said to have}} been in Frankfort to seek a pardon from Taylor for the killing of a man in a family feud, was accused of being the actual assassin.|$|E

5|$|Indictment against Blythe {{was brought}} by State Attorney Vladimír Mužík. Mužík had tried {{a number of}} murderers, such as Luboš Mika (life in prison), Roman Fidler (life {{imprisonment}} at 1st instance, 25 years on appeal), Maria Zolotukinová (13 years imprisonment) and Petr Procházka (11 years imprisonment). He also tried a case against Andranik Soghojan, an alleged head of Russian mafia, requesting 25 {{years in prison for}} ordering a murder. The Municipal Court in Prague acquitted Soghojan due to lack of evidence; however, the decision was repealed on appeal by the High Court, and the case will be heard again by a different tribunal of the Municipal Court. Another of Mužík's murder cases which ended in acquittal due to insufficient evidence is that of Miroslav Rus, who was <b>indicted</b> <b>in</b> connection with disappearance of Miroslav Kříž, a vice-chairman of the Czech Football Association.|$|E
5|$|Shakur {{and four}} others (including Fred Hilton, Avon White, and Andrew Jackson) were <b>indicted</b> <b>in</b> the State Supreme Court in Bronx on December 31, 1973, {{on charges of}} {{attempting}} to shoot and kill two policemen—Michael O'Reilly and Roy Polliana, who were wounded but had since returned to duty—in an ambush in St. Albans, Queens on January 28, 1973. On March 5, 1974, two new defendants (Jeannette Jefferson and Robert Hayes) were named in an indictment involving the same charges. On April 26, while Shakur was pregnant, New Jersey Governor Brendan Byrne signed an extradition order to move Shakur to New York to face two counts of attempted murder, attempted assault, and possession of dangerous weapons related to the alleged ambush; however, Shakur declined to waive her right to an extradition hearing, {{and asked for a}} full hearing before Middlesex County Court Judge John E. Bachman.|$|E
5|$|The {{confrontation}} {{resulted in}} a further deterioration of the overall situation in Croatia, leading Croats and Serbs to accuse each other of overt aggression and of being enemies of their nation. For Croatia, the event was provocative because the bodies {{of some of the}} dead Croat policemen killed in the incident were reportedly mutilated. The clash in Borovo Selo eliminated any hopes that the escalating conflict could be defused politically and made the war almost inevitable. The Presidency of Yugoslavia met days after the fighting and authorised the JNA to deploy to the area to prevent further conflict but despite this deployment, skirmishes persisted in the region. After the war, a former Serb irregular was convicted of war crimes for his role in abusing two captured policemen, and ultimately sentenced to three years in prison. Four others were <b>indicted</b> <b>in</b> absentia but remain at large outside Croatia.|$|E

5|$|The long {{investigation}} {{time span}} was causing {{problems for the}} prosecutors as {{an increasing number of}} the counts were meeting their statutes of limitations. The police announced in September 1973 that they were working on indictments towards Tjøntveit and two of the creditors who placed their representatives on the board after the company was insolvent. The police investigation was concluded in May 1975. By then, the statutes of limitations for the accounting issues had passed, and the police focused on the more serious charge of debt manipulation. Tjøntveit and two board members were <b>indicted</b> <b>in</b> 1976. The managing committee for the winding-up released its report in November 1977; the report concluded that although the company's books showed assets of NOK8.6 million, in reality it only had fifty Norwegian krone. The committee further criticized the company for having too low a share capital, lack of qualified management and insufficient competence in operation and management of large aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the rapid ascent of Ford and members of his faction to the state's major {{political}} offices, he and Carroll were investigated in a corruption probe. The four-year investigation began in 1977 and focused on a state insurance kickback scheme alleged to have operated during Ford's tenure. In June 1972, Ford had purchased insurance policies for state workers from some of his political backers without competitive bidding. State law did not require competitive bidding, and earlier governors had engaged in similar practices. Investigators believed there was an arrangement in which insurance companies getting government contracts split commissions with party officials, although Ford was suspected of allowing the practice for political benefit rather than personal financial gain. In 1981, prosecutors asked for indictments against Ford and Carroll on racketeering charges but a grand jury refused. Because grand jury proceedings are secret, what exactly occurred has never been publicly revealed. However, state Republicans maintained that Ford took the Fifth Amendment while on the stand, invoking his right against self-incrimination. Ford refused to confirm or deny this report. A federal grand jury recommended that Ford be <b>indicted</b> <b>in</b> connection with the insurance scheme, but the U.S. Department of Justice did not act on this recommendation.|$|E
