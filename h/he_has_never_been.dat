5|$|Over the centuries, Skarga {{became a}} {{character}} {{in a number of other}} artistic works, including a novel by Józef Ignacy Kraszewski, though <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> the chief character in any literary work longer than a poem.|$|E
5|$|Mitchell {{lives with}} his wife, Joyce, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; the couple have no children. Mitchell had {{expressed}} interest in becoming the head football coach at Alabama when that position had been open in the past. However, despite this interest and his connection with the program <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> pursued for the position.|$|E
5|$|<b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> {{charged with}} any crime due to {{apparent}} mental inculpability. One contentious issue of Weston's incarceration is that of forced medication. Weston has thus far refused to take any medications voluntarily. His lawyers helped enable this, {{in order to protect}} him from the death penalty. In May 2001, a federal judge authorized doctors to treat Weston involuntarily. A panel from a federal appeals court ruled in July 2001 that Weston could be forced to take the drugs which he was forced to do for 120 days. He remains in the Butner facility indefinitely.|$|E

5|$|Flanagan {{observes that}} in Tenebrae, Argento offers two {{characters}} {{who suffer from}} impaired vision. Gianni (Christian Borromeo) is an eyewitness to an axe-murder, but the trauma of seeing the killing causes him to disregard a vital clue. Returning {{to the scene of}} the crime, he suddenly remembers everything, and is murdered before being able to tell anyone. Homicide detective Giermani reveals that he is a big fan of the novels of Agatha Christie, Mickey Spillane, Rex Stout, and Ed McBain, but admits that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> able to guess the identity of the killer in any of the books. He is similarly unable to solve the real mystery until the last corpses are piled at his feet – he cannot see Peter Neal for what he really is.|$|E
25|$|Bout's {{strategy}} of constantly moving location, owning numerous companies, and frequently re-registering aircraft {{made it hard}} for authorities {{to make a case}} against him. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> charged for the alleged African arms deals to which he owes his notoriety.|$|E
25|$|After joining politics, Kejriwal {{claimed in}} 2013 {{that he had}} chosen public service over earning crores as an Income Tax Commissioner.

25|$|Additionally, Saenz is {{a suspect}} in a {{homicide}} that happened in early 1997. Although there are rumors linking Jose Saenz to a kidnapping {{of a woman in}} Los Angeles and to the death of drug trafficker Bogart Bello for a failed drug deal in 2008, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> charged for those crimes.|$|E
25|$|Plato's Problem {{particularly}} {{refers to}} {{a point in the}} dialogue when Socrates is talking with an uneducated servant and shows, through this interaction, that the servant knows the Pythagorean Theorem though <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> explicitly taught any geometry. How does the servant know without having ever been taught? Plato's suggestion is, essentially, that people have innate knowledge.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> {{charged with}} her murder, during police interrogations in 2003, Ridgway did confess to killing Kasee Ann Lee (née Woods). He {{stated that he}} strangled Lee in 1982 and left her body near a {{drive-in}} theatre off the Sea-Tac Strip. Law enforcement officials {{have been unable to}} locate Lee's remains at the dump site that Ridgway indicated.|$|E

25|$|He {{was again}} {{given a chance}} during Pakistan's cricket team tour to New Zealand in 2003, where he was {{selected}} for the test squad, {{but this time he}} didn't perform well and was dropped from then the incoming ODI series. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> a part of National Cricket team since then and eventually announced his formal retirement from both formats of cricket in late 2003.|$|E

25|$|Arlovski faced {{off against}} veteran of over 300 fights Travis Fulton at ProElite 2 in November, {{serving as the}} co-main event. Arlovski won the fight via a head kick KO in the final second of the third round. It was a {{knockout}} which caused Fulton, {{who had never been}} knocked out, to regain consciousness about 5 minutes after the fight was stopped. Fulton later admitted to Arlovski in the locker room that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> hit that hard in all of his 300 bouts.|$|E
25|$|It {{was common}} {{knowledge}} that Arthur Morris, after failing {{in the first two}} Tests, was in grave danger of being dropped, and Meuleman was his obvious successor. In the first innings Arthur made 21 and we all thought Ken's chances were sky high. Arthur scored 155 in the second innings and saved his place. Meuleman, twelfth man in the first two Tests...was instantly dropped. And <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> asked to play since. If ever a man was thrown on the scrap heap it was Ken.|$|E
25|$|The most {{defining}} {{property of}} modernity, according to Giddens, {{is that we}} are disembedded from time and space. In pre-modern societies, space was the area in which one moved, time was the experience one had while moving. In modern societies, however, the social space is no longer confined by the boundaries set by the space in which one moves. One can now imagine what other spaces look like, even if <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> there. In this regard, Giddens talks about virtual space and virtual time. Another distinctive property of modernity lies in the field of knowledge.|$|E

25|$|Rodezno’s {{motives are}} unclear; apart from {{partisan}} {{claims that he}} traded Carlist principles for a few Navarrese alcaldias, there are many conflicting interpretations offered. According to one, he feared that internal divisions within the Nationalist camp might lead to defeat in the war. According to another, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> a genuine Carlist and is better described as a conservative monarchist. Some scholars claim {{that he was a}} possibilist, who realized that Traditionalism was unable to seize power single-handedly and needed coalition partners; one more clue might have been that perceiving Carlism as rooted in family and regional values, he downplayed the issues of organization and structures. Others underline that he considered the emerging system largely in line with the Carlist vision and did not think it worthwhile to be marginalized for the sake of defending second-rate discrepancies. Finally, there are authors who believe that he realized neither gravity of the moment nor totalitarian nature of the new party; Rodezno – the theory goes – imagined the structure either as a new incarnation of Unión Patriotica or as a loose alliance, both permitting Carlism to maintain its proper identity.|$|E
