It is important for clinicians to understand which approaches to <b>healthcare</b> <b>service</b> <b>delivery</b> for this population are supported in the literature and how these should be applied in clinical practice. This narrative review aims to identify and review the evidence for current approaches to <b>healthcare</b> <b>service</b> <b>delivery</b> for children with {{cerebral palsy}}. Databases were searched using key terms to identify relevant research articles and grey literature from December 2011 to September 2013.

The <b>delivery</b> of <b>healthcare</b> <b>services</b> {{should be}} of a high {{standard}} for everyone. For people in the location of Mantunzeleni {{this is not the}} case as there are still challenges that they go through in order to gain access to sufficient <b>healthcare</b> <b>services.</b> The location consists of four villages and the other nine which surround the four, in total this makes thirteen villages that are served by one clinic. These villages are divided by forest, rivers and mountains, people have to cross these and walk long distances to get to the clinic. Gaining access to basic <b>healthcare</b> <b>services</b> in rural areas has never been easy, hence this study seeks to understand the role telehealth could play to help improve the situation. It has been reported in the literature that telehealth has potential to address some of the problems experienced by <b>healthcare</b> <b>service</b> providers located in the rural areas. Research questions were posed to address the problem of limited access to <b>healthcare</b> <b>services</b> of under-served communities in rural areas. The study adopted an interpretive approach to understand how the people using <b>healthcare</b> <b>services</b> in the setting attach meaning to their experiences of the <b>healthcare</b> <b>service.</b> The study therefore seeks to understand how telehealth could improve <b>healthcare</b> <b>service</b> <b>delivery</b> through the participants’ views, perceptions and experiences. The research strategy for this study is a single case study without attempting to generalise the findings. Qualitative data was gathered using unstructured interviews, observations and co-design methods. The current state of telehealth and challenges of <b>healthcare</b> <b>services</b> in rural under-served communities was established through a review of relevant literature. It was important to actively involve the respondents in the research process for them to feel a sense of ownership. Data was analysed using a thematic analysis. The findings revealed the challenges currently hampering the delivery of healthcare in the research setting include poor infrastructure, high cost, the shortage of medical professionals, travelling distance, time management and lack of communication about the services. It was also revealed the role telehealth could play a role to improve access to healthcare and the findings indicate that the nurses feel that extending the <b>healthcare</b> <b>service</b> to include alternative access methods to health information, education and expertise could lead to a sense of appreciation, knowledge gain, dealing with distance problems and improved referrals, cost saving to improve <b>healthcare</b> <b>service</b> <b>delivery...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} of records management to {{the provision of}} <b>healthcare</b> <b>services</b> cannot be overemphasised. If medical records are not managed properly, this might result {{in the provision of}} poor <b>healthcare</b> <b>services.</b> This is because usually if medical records are not properly managed, the healthcare institutions attain inaccurate, untimely, incomplete and unauthentic records or the records fade completely. Records that are not managed properly are easily lost, modified, altered, misfiled and/or damaged, which results in a struggle to locate them and, eventually, much time is lost. Records of this kind may not support <b>healthcare</b> <b>service</b> providers properly in decision-making, problem-solving, monitoring and evaluation of service for continuous service improvement. This study utilised the five elements of trusted records management (records management governance practice, staff capacity and competencies, recordkeeping system and technology, and records archival processes) to investigate the development of a framework to embed medical records management into the <b>healthcare</b> <b>service</b> <b>delivery</b> practice for effective records management practice. The study predominantly utilised a quantitative approach with some support from a limited scope of qualitative data to augment numeric data. The data was collected using the four different techniques, namely questionnaire, interview, observation and system/documents analysis. The study revealed that the mode of medical record management was not effectively enabling the institution to manage medical records properly due to lack of integrated medical records management framework into the healthcare business process. The medical records management technology also lacked file tracking system, records backup, and audit trail which compromise records safety and security. The study recommended supply of the necessary resources, with a framework that the healthcare institutions may adopt to embed medical records management into the <b>healthcare</b> <b>service</b> <b>delivery.</b> ECM may also be implemented to incorporate electronic records management systems, information management, web content and other add-ons to support the records management framework in ensuring effective discharge of all records management functional requirements on the healthcare business process. A further study was recommended about the development of an online outpatient consultation system and medical records access to avoid patient long turnaround time for service. Information ScienceD.

Sexual reproductive health {{is one of these}} health areas in which the public health sector is not meeting the growing demand and it is defined as unmet need for family planning. To address this need, international agencies have been operating in {{the developing}} world with the aim of making sexual reproductive health services accessible to everyone while assuring good quality. Health franchising is a <b>healthcare</b> <b>service</b> <b>delivery</b> model that is operated by international NGOs and private sector in these regions. As a type of social franchising, health franchising uses commercial franchising mechanisms in order to generate social welfare. The business model of health franchising is based on creating a network of franchisees, utilizing the existing private clinics while providing them with subsidized commodities, training, monitoring, promotion of the network and incentives. In return, the franchisees are promising to stay loyal to the franchisor’s standards and periodically report their performance. Although health-franchising programs have been active and constantly expanding their operations, there are limited studies on the business model and its cost effectiveness. This study aims to explore health franchising, the business model, performance and cost effectiveness in comparison to other <b>healthcare</b> <b>service</b> <b>delivery</b> models {{in the developing}} world. For this purpose, a cost effectiveness analysis is conducted on the operations of a health franchising program to calculate the input/output ratio in terms of cost per health impact generated. The value adding mechanisms and impact of health franchising are further discussed through interviews. Findings are interpreted into a set of practical recommendations and an experiment blueprint for a standardized evaluation of health franchising programs. Findings from the case of PSI Myanmar suggest that the cost effectiveness ratio of health franchising is within the limits of similar health <b>service</b> <b>delivery</b> models in the developing world. Apart from its cost-effectiveness, there are other factors such as quality, perception of comfort from the patients and the robust supply chain that make this business model successful in the context it operates.
