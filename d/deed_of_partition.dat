5000|$|A {{protracted}} lawsuit ensued between Wilfred {{against both}} his granddaughter's trustee and his daughter. Eventually the courts ruled against Wilfred. At one point, after Wilfred had shot seven more horses, the Trustee for the granddaughters obtained an injunction {{to prevent the}} sale or destruction of any more animals. In 1921, the court declared that Wilfrid's seizure of horses was illegal, and that even the <b>Deed</b> <b>of</b> <b>Partition</b> was invalid, having been signed by Lady Anne [...] "under duress".

50|$|Gräfenstein Castle {{was built}} by the Saarbrücken counts, who had lost their {{fortress}} and were {{in need of a}} new one. Evidence for the exact date of the castle's building does not exist although the earliest record dates to a 1237 <b>deed</b> <b>of</b> <b>partition</b> by the counts of Leiningen. But from the castle's design and materials it can be deduced that it was built sometime between 1150 and 1200. Another clue is in the date of the restoration of the stone fortress, which took place in 1168, and coincides with first construction work on Gräfenstein Castle. The central element of the site, with its bergfried and palas probably dates to the 12th century and thus goes back to the Hohenstaufen era. The upper part of the castle was built on a rock shelf 12 metres high. The building's highlight is the peculiar seven-sided tower.|$|E
50|$|The lands {{surrounding}} Cool Spring Farm {{were first}} surveyed in 1734. Joshua Haines, a Quaker from New Jersey, bought a 700 acreportion of the lands in 1750 from Benjamin Borden, Jr. of Augusta, Virginia. In 1752 his brother Abraham bought 314 are ha from Joshua. An adjoining 422 acre tract {{was sold in}} 1750 to George Washington. The following year a <b>deed</b> <b>of</b> <b>partition</b> adjusted {{the boundary between the}} Haines and Washington lands.

At that time, Lady Anne signed a <b>Deed</b> <b>of</b> <b>Partition</b> drawn up by Wilfrid.

Always struggling with financial concerns and chemical dependency issues, Wilfrid sold off numerous horses to pay debts and constantly attempted to obtain additional assets.

Her daughter Judith lived full-time at the Crabbet estate with her own husband and children.

5000|$|Wilfrid and Judith disputed Lady Anne's {{estate and}} the {{ownership}} of many horses. The bitter battle went to court, where a verdict in favour of Judith's children was rendered in 1920, invalidating the <b>deed</b> <b>of</b> <b>partition</b> and reunifying most of the stud. Wilfrid died in 1922, having verbally reconciled with Judith but without rewriting his will to grant her any inheritance of his remaining property. Over time Judith had managed to buy out her daughters' shares of Crabbet and Newbuidings from the trustee, buy back many of the horses Wilfrid had sold to third parties, and the Crabbet stud continued under Judith's management. Under Judith, her management and breeding decisions improved upon the [...] "desert conditions" [...] theories of Wilfrid. Her addition of non-desertbred Arabian stock, such as the Polish-bred Arabian stallion Skowronek, created controversy, but the stud survived and prospered for almost fifty years until 1971, when the property itself was bisected by a motorway. [...] Judith sold Crabbet horses all over the world, including to the United States, Australia, Spain and Russia. She sold some horses bred from the Blunt lines back to Egypt, {{where they have a}} legacy today.

5000|$|Rev. James Bernard (1785-1839). Rev. James Bernard (1785-1839) (born [...] "James Camplin") of Crowcombe and Sidmouth, {{was the son}} of Rev. James Camplin, Rector of Coombe Flory, Somerset. He {{was educated}} at Eton and King's College, Cambridge. He entered Lincoln's Inn in 1807 and was called to the bar in 1813. In about 1810 he changed his surname to Bernard. This was {{apparently}} the result of an inheritance: a certain James Bernard (d.1811), of the Middle Temple, who died without progeny, had inherited Crowcombe Court, Somerset, and Carew Castle in Pembrokeshire, from his wife Elizabeth Carew (d.1805) (whose joint mural monument survives in Crowcombe Church), daughter and heiress of Thomas Carew (d.1766) of Crowcombe Carew, Somerset. Elizabeth Carew's heir to Crowcombe Court and Carew Castle was her cousin Mary Carew (d.1852), wife of George Henry Warrington (d.1842) of Pentrepart Hall, who in 1811 assumed the surname Carew. He married Mary Hawker, one of the three daughters and co-heiresses of William II Hawker (d.1806), and was the proprietor of Mohuns Ottery in 1822. Lysons (1822) stated: [...] "Some part of the ancient mansion of the barons Carew is still remaining, and occupied as a farm-house. The park has been long ago converted into tillage". A <b>deed</b> <b>of</b> <b>partition</b> had been signed in 1808 splitting the Hawker patrimony between the three Hawker sisters and co-heiresses.
