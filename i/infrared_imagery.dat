Light scattering by particles in the rings showed the particles were irregularly shaped (rather than spherical) and likely originated as ejecta from micrometeorite impacts on Jupiter's moons, probably on Metis and Adrastea.

5|$|Early on September4, the {{hurricane}} moved beneath a large upper-level anticyclone which provided a reprieve from the strong southwesterly wind shear. Although its convective organization {{had yet to}} become fully symmetrical, an eye became increasingly apparent on <b>infrared</b> <b>imagery.</b> The center moved very near the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's buoy 41044—which registered a maximum sustained wind of 90mph (145km/h) and a maximum wind gust of —around 12:00UTC, indicating that Katia had intensified into a Category2 hurricane. Although an eyewall replacement cycle briefly caused the storm's convective pattern to deteriorate, Katia attained major hurricane status—a Category3 or higher on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale—by 12:00UTC on September5. Twelve hours later, the cyclone further intensified into a Category4 hurricane and attained peak winds of 140mph (220km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 942mbar (hPa; 27.82inHg) as its eye warmed, deep convection became much more symmetric about the center, and upper-level outflow expanded.|$|E

500|$|During {{the next}} six hours, Frank became much better {{organized}} with a large area of very deep convection near the center. Based on this, the NHC upgraded the system into a hurricane. Gradually intensifying, an eye became intermediately visible on <b>infrared</b> <b>imagery</b> and a persistent eye was visible via microwave imagery. On 1800 UTC, Frank reached its peak intensity of 90mph (150km/h) and 978 mbar (hPa; 28.88 inHg) while located [...] south of {{the southern tip of}} the Baja California Peninsula. While at peak intensity, satellite imagery showed a small but distinct eye surrounded by a central dense overcast, or a large area of thunderstorm activity. Moving west-northwest, Frank began a weakening trend overnight as the eye became less defined. Continuing to weaken, Frank became less organized and its eye collapsed. On August 27, the NHC downgraded Frank into a tropical storm, with poorly organized convection located west of the center due to strong wind shear. As such, the agency predicted the storm to weaken into a tropical depression within the next 36 hours. Frank rapidly lost all thunderstorm activity because of cooler water, and the storms intensity was reduced to a swirl of clouds while it turned towards the north due to a mid-level trough. The cyclone weakened back into a tropical depression early on August28. Frank degenerated into a remnant low while located [...] southwest of the southern tip of Baja California. The remnant low dissipated early on August29.|$|E
500|$|At 1330UTC on December16, the Mauritius Meteorological Services {{designated}} {{the system as}} a moderate tropical storm, thus assigning it the name Amara. At the time the storm had a minimum barometric pressure estimated at 995mbar (hPa; 29.39inHg). During the subsequent hours, the storm began to slowly track west-southwest under the periphery of a nearby subtropical ridge. Amara's circulation center consolidated and rainbands became more tightly wrapped around the center, at which time the Joint Typhoon Warning Center(JTWC) began to monitor the system. Late on December17, Amara began to develop an eye, observable via microwave imagery. Based on the antecedent developments, Météo-France upgraded the system to severe tropical storm intensity at 0000UTC the following day. Nine hours later, the JTWC upgraded Amara to tropical cyclone intensity, with Météo-France following suit three hours later. Situated in a location with low vertical wind shear and outspread outflow, Amara was forecast to continue strengthening, though {{at the same time the}} cyclone was expected to move very slowly due to its interaction with weak steering currents in between two subtropical ridges. Rapid intensification ensued throughout the latter hours of December18, coinciding with the development of a ragged eye feature within the tropical cyclone on <b>infrared</b> <b>imagery.</b> Météo-France upgraded Amara to intense tropical cyclone status at 0000UTC on December19. By this time the storm's central pressure had fallen to 944mbar (hPa; 27.88inHg). Shortly after, however, Amara's once well-defined outflow pattern became suppressed, resulting in a slight weakening and a downgrade from intense tropical cyclone status just twelve hours later.|$|E
