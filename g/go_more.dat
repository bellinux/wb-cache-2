5|$|On September29, {{shortly after}} Keith formed, a {{hurricane}} watch was issued for the Yucatán peninsula from Chetumal to Cabo Catoche in Quintana Roo. The next day as Keith was nearing hurricane intensity, the watch was upgraded to a warning, and {{a tropical storm}} warning and hurricane watch was issued for the Belize coastline from Belize City to the Mexican border. At that time, the trajectory was expected to <b>go</b> <b>more</b> to the northwest, and when the storm turned to a slow westward drift, hurricane warnings were issued for the Belize coast with only about 24hours of lead time for the offshore islands. The warnings for the Yucatán peninsula were dropped as Keith weakened.|$|E
25|$|Based {{partly on}} {{contemporary}} British railway practice, {{the experience of}} Sir Charles Fox and Sons on the Queensland Railways, and Carl Abraham Pihl's work in Norway, the early rolling stock was intended to consist of short four-wheel boxcars, and longer six-wheel flat and passenger cars using Clark's radial axle arrangement. The four-wheel boxcars were reliable and suited the traffic at first, but became {{too small for the}} increasing traffic, and were not added to after 1874. Many became wayside grounded tool vans after gauge standardisation. The first longer flatcars were built using imported sets of Clark's radial gear and put into service with the construction contractors. The intention was that they would <b>go</b> <b>more</b> easily around tight curves. Whether through bad design, poor assembly, or abuse and heavy uneven loading by the construction gangs, the six-wheel cars proved disastrously prone to derailment and were soon put aside in favour of cars re-equipped with two standard North American four-wheel trucks (bogies). The passenger cars were never used in six-wheel form due to safety concerns.|$|E
25|$|A {{week after}} Khan joined with new trainer Virgil Hunter it was {{announced}} that he would make his comeback fight against undefeated American Carlos Molina (17–0, 7 KOs). The fight was aired on Showtime, on 15 December 2012, and took place in the LA Sports Arena in California. Khan defeated Molina by TKO in the tenth round and won the WBC Silver light welterweight title. Khan pushed Molina onto the back foot and landed a sharp right hand that cut Molina over the left eye. Khan was stiffened by a right hook in the second before steadying the ship and resuming control of the contest. Molina's cut deteriorating badly and taking plenty of punishment. Referee Jack Reiss suggested his corner pull him {{out at the end of}} the ninth, however Molina was sent out for more, despite it being abundantly clear that he did not have the tools to do Khan much damage. Khan started to let his hands <b>go</b> <b>more</b> in round 10, after which his corner finally decided it had seen enough. Khan landed 312 of 679 punches thrown (46%), an equal amount of jabs and power shots were landed. Molina was less busier, landing 87 of 335 (26%).|$|E

25|$|The Calgary Board of Education (CBE), in Calgary, Alberta, has various elementary, {{middle and}} high schools {{offering}} the GATE Program, standing for Gifted and Talented Education, for Grades 4-12, or Divisions 2-4. The program for students, who, through an IQ test, ranked in the Very Superior Range; falling into Gifted or Genius. For each of the three divisions, there are 2 schools offering GATE, one for the North Side of the city (CBE Areas I, II and III) and one for the South Side (CBE Areas IV and V). For Division 2, or Grades 4-6, it is available at Hillhurst Elementary School for the North and Nellie McClung Elementary School for the South. For Division 3, or Grades 7-9, it is available at Queen Elizabeth High School for the North and John Ware Junior High School for the South. For Division 3, or Grades 10-12, Queen Elizabeth High School, which is a joint Junior High-Senior High offers it for the North and Henry Wise Wood Senior High School offers it for the south. GATE classes <b>go</b> <b>more</b> in depth and learns some curriculum for the following grade level, with tougher assignments and a faster learning pace. They benefit from being around students like them. These students attend the school alongside regular students and those in other programs (e.g. IB, AP.) In the 2014-15 school year, students from Grades 4-7 in the south will be attending Louis Riel Junior High School, already home to a science program, and students in the regular program there will be moved to Nellie McClung and John Ware. Students at John Ware will be phased out: eighth grade GATE will end in June 2015, and ninth grade GATE will end in 2016, while GATE will be expanding to Grade 9 at Louis Riel by September 2016. Prior to John Ware, the GATE program was housed at Elboya. A large number of teachers from Nellie McClung and John Ware will be moving to the new location, which was picked to deal with student population issues and to concentrate resources.|$|E

500|$|Though the Pokémon {{franchise}} {{is primarily}} intended for younger players, each Pokémon has various complex attributes such as natures, characteristic traits, Individual Values (IVs), and Effort Values (EVs).

These individual statistics were also included because the basic concept of the franchise is to train one's Pokémon. Designer Takeshi Kawachimaru stated that IVs and EVs [...] "help to make each Pokemon in the game individual", as it adds unique aspects to them. Each Pokémon game introduces a few [...] "Legendary" [...] and [...] "Mythical" [...] Pokémon that are powerful, rare, and hard to catch. Pokémon Sun and Moon introduced [...] "Ultra Beasts", which are described as [...] "beings from another dimension" [...] {{that appeared in the}} Alola region and are similarly powerful and rare.|$|E

He's not your typical gay stereotype that some TV shows like to play up. He's on the basketball team, he's had a girlfriend for a time, and I think the show does a good job of portraying the way his character is discovering who he really is".|$|E

[...] As the king and his family watched in secret, the charges against the plotters were read aloud. [...] Alone amongst them Digby pleaded [...] "Guilty", and was tried on a separate indictment. [...] Dressed in a black satin suit and [...] "tuff taffetie gown", he gave a short and moving speech, defending his actions by explaining his affection for Catesby, and the cause of his religion. [...] He accused King James of reneging on his promises of toleration for Catholics, and told of his fears of harsher laws against recusancy. [...] He also pleaded on behalf of his family, that they should not pay for his actions, before making a final request to be beheaded. [...] His words fell on mostly deaf ears. [...] The prosecution poured scorn on James's supposed perfidy, and ridiculed Digby for asking for leniency where he would have given none. [...] Along with the other plotters, he was found guilty. [...] As they were led from the hall, Digby exclaimed: [...] "If I may but hear any of your lordships say, you forgive me, I shall <b>go</b> <b>more</b> cheerfully to the gallows."

[...] Then he would be decapitated, and the dismembered parts of his body displayed {{so that they might}} become [...] "prey for the fowls of the air". [...] Confessions and declarations from the prisoners were then read aloud, and finally the prisoners were allowed to speak. [...] Rookwood claimed that he had been drawn into the plot by Catesby, [...] "whom he loved above any worldy man". [...] Thomas Wintour begged to be hanged for himself and his brother, so that his brother might be spared. [...] Fawkes explained his not guilty plea as ignorance of certain aspects of the indictment. [...] Keyes appeared to accept his fate, Bates and Robert Wintour begged for mercy, and Grant explained his involvement as [...] "a conspiracy intended but never effected". [...] Only Digby, tried on a separate indictment, pleaded guilty, insisting that the King had reneged upon promises of toleration for Catholics, and that affection for Catesby and love of the Catholic cause mitigated his actions. [...] He sought death by the axe and begged mercy from the King for his young family. [...] His defence was in vain; his arguments were rebuked by Coke and Northumberland, and along with his seven co-conspirators, he was found guilty by the jury of high treason. [...] Digby shouted [...] "If I may but hear any of your lordships say, you forgive me, I shall <b>go</b> <b>more</b> cheerfully to the gallows."
