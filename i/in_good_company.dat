25|$|Given this climate, the StingRay guitar {{was quietly}} {{dropped from the}} line. The Sabre guitar soldiered on until 1984. A {{graphite}} necked StingRay Bass debuted in 1980. Fender had been opposed to the idea. The neck was made by Modulus. It was called the Cutlass and the two pickup variant, the Cutlass II. Neither it, nor the new translucent finishes, were able to turn the financial tide and by 1984 the company was near bankruptcy. Music Man was <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>company</b> as both Fender and Gibson reached the nadir of mismanagement in the early 1980s. After looking at a few offers Music Man was sold to Ernie Ball on March 7, 1984. Music Man's remaining physical assets were sold on June 1, 1984. The production of amplifiers, which were manufactured at a separate factory, ceased.|$|E

To ensure he could make the trip his local community in Shoalhaven clubbed together to sponsor his journey, something Davis remains grateful for to this day. On tour Davis was chosen to open the batting with another future test player Gary Cosier {{for the first two}} matches against Jamaica Under-19s. He scored 11, 8 and 8. In the third tour match against Barbados he scored one run not out batting at four. In his sixth match of the tour Davis scored a magnificent century against Trindad and Tobago Under-19s and backed up with 50 not out in the second innings. He finished the tour averaging a very good 43.71 from the seven matches he played. Davis was <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>company</b> on the tour, along with Cosier, Trevor Chappell and Gary Gilmour went on the represent Australia, while Andrew Sincock had a long first-class career with South Australia.|$|E

500|$|In {{her fourth}} release in 2004, the live-action {{animated}} comedy The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, Johansson voiced Princess Mindy, {{the daughter of}} King Neptune. She agreed to the film because of her love for cartoons and The Ren & Stimpy Show. The film was her most commercially successful work that year. She followed it with <b>In</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Company,</b> a comedy-drama about a middle-aged man (Dennis Quaid), whose life becomes complicated after he dates the daughter (Johansson) of his much younger new boss (Topher Grace). Reviews of the film were generally positive, describing it as [...] "witty and charming". Roger Ebert was impressed with Johansson's portrayal, writing that she [...] "continues to employ the gravitational pull of quiet fascination".|$|E

500|$|Taft was {{convinced}} {{he would be}} vindicated by history. After he left office, he {{was estimated to be}} about in the middle of U.S. presidents by greatness, and subsequent rankings by historians have by and large sustained that verdict. Coletta noted that this places Taft <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>company,</b> with James Madison, John Quincy Adams and McKinley. Lurie catalogued progressive innovations that took place under Taft, and argued that historians have overlooked them because Taft was not an effective political writer or speaker. According to Gould, [...] "the clichés about Taft's weight, his maladroitness in the White House, and his conservatism of thought and doctrine have an element of truth, but they fail to do justice to a shrewd commentator on the political scene, a man of consummate ambition, and a resourceful practitioner of the internal politics of his party." [...] Anderson deemed Taft's success in becoming both president and chief justice [...] "an astounding feat of inside judicial and Republican party politics, played out over years, the likes of which we are not likely to see again in American history".|$|E

2500|$|After the Japanese {{invasion}} of China in 1937, Cao Yu took {{shelter in the}} central city of Chongqing, along {{with the government of}} Chiang Kai-shek. There he wrote his fourth work, The Metamorphosis, which greatly departed from his previous works, concerning itself with patriotic exaltation. Produced {{for the first time in}} 1939, the play is set in a military hospital that is bombed by the Japanese army. Although a change for Cao Yu, he was <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>company</b> as concentrating on war themes and settings was favored [...] by most of the prominent Chinese writers active during the Second Sino-Japanese war in areas controlled by the government of Chongqing.

In 2004, Blair took {{on the role of}} Liz Sherman, a depressed pyrotechnic superhero, in Guillermo Del Toro's blockbuster fantasy film Hellboy, co-starring Ron Perlman. Based on Mike Mignola's popular comic book series, the film was favorably received by critics; The New York Times remarked: [...] "Blair's heavy-lidded eyes seem to be at half mast from some lovely lewd fantasy. With her sleepy carnality and dry, hesitant timing, she is a superb foil for Mr. Perlman's plain-spoken bravado". Hellboy topped the box office in the U.S. and Canada in its opening weekend, and ultimately grossed US$99.3 million around the globe.|$|E

During this time, Noguchi gained his footing in stone sculpture, a medium with which he was unacquainted, though he would later admit that one of Brâncuși's greatest teachings was to appreciate [...] "the value of the moment." [...] Meanwhile, Noguchi found himself <b>in</b> <b>good</b> <b>company</b> in France, with letters of introduction from Michio Itō helping him to meet such artists as Jules Pascin and Alexander Calder, who lived in the studio of Arno Breker.
