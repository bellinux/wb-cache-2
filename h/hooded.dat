5|$|American crows are the {{new world}} {{counterpart}} to the carrion crow and the <b>hooded</b> crow. Although the American crow and the <b>hooded</b> crow are very similar in size, structure and behavior, their calls are different. The American crow nevertheless occupies the same role the <b>hooded</b> crow does in Eurasia.|$|E
5|$|Common and {{widespread}} throughout New Guinea, the <b>hooded</b> pitohui is evaluated {{as a species}} of least concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. In one study {{of the effects of}} small subsistence gardens, populations of <b>hooded</b> pitohui were lower in disturbed agricultural habitat in the lowlands, compared to undisturbed forest, but actually increased in disturbed habitat higher in the mountains.|$|E
5|$|The <b>hooded</b> pitohui {{is found}} in forests from sea-level up to , but is most common in hills and low mountains. A social bird, it lives in family groups and {{frequently}} joins and even leads mixed-species foraging flocks. The diet {{is made up of}} fruits, seeds and invertebrates. This species is apparently a cooperative breeder, with family groups helping to protect the nest and feed the young. The <b>hooded</b> pitohui is common and not at risk of extinction.|$|E
5|$|The <b>hooded</b> pitohui {{was placed}} in the genus Pitohui with five other species, and the genus was thought to reside within the Australasian {{whistler}} family (Pachycephalidae). A 2008 examination of the genus, however, found it to be polyphyletic (meaning that the genus contained unrelated species), with some purported members of the genus not actually falling within the whistlers. The <b>hooded</b> pitohui and the closely related variable pitohui were both found {{to be related to the}} Old World orioles (Oriolidae). A 2010 study by the same team confirmed that the <b>hooded</b> pitohui and variable pitohui were orioles and indeed were sister species, and that together with the figbirds they formed a well defined basal clade within the family. As the variable pitohui was the type species for the genus Pitohui, the <b>hooded</b> pitohui was retained in that genus and the four remaining species were moved to other genera.|$|E
5|$|Anderson and Ward {{exploit the}} new {{information}} to concoct a plan, luring identified KKK collaborators to a bogus meeting. The Klan members soon realize it is a set-up and leave without discussing the murders. The FBI then concentrate on Lester Cowens, a Klansman of interest, who exhibits a nervous demeanor which the agents believe might yield a confession. The FBI pick him up and interrogate him. Later, Cowens is at home when his window is shattered by a shotgun blast. After seeing a burning cross on his lawn, Cowens tries to flee in his truck, but is caught by several <b>hooded</b> men who intend to hang him. The FBI arrive to rescue him, having staged the whole scenario; the <b>hooded</b> men are revealed to be other agents.|$|E
5|$|Dandasuka (snakes): Filled {{with envy}} and fury, some people harm others like snakes. These {{are destined to}} be devoured by five or seven <b>hooded</b> serpents in this hell.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hooded</b> (Polish: kapturowe) sejmiks {{had special}} powers during an interregnum. These sejmiks were {{organized}} as confederations, and would elect confederation officials. The name {{was derived from}} hoods worn {{in the period of}} royal mourning. These sejmiks began during the interregnum of 1572.|$|E
5|$|In the British Isles, the <b>hooded</b> crow breeds {{regularly}} in Scotland, the Isle of Man, and the Scottish Islands. It also breeds widely in Ireland. In autumn, some migratory birds {{arrive on the}} east coast of Britain. In the past, this was a more common visitor.|$|E
5|$|It is {{so similar}} in {{morphology}} and habits to the carrion crow (Corvus corone), {{for many years}} they were considered by most authorities to be geographical races of one species. Hybridization observed where their ranges overlapped added weight to this view. However, since 2002, the <b>hooded</b> crow has been elevated to full species status after closer observation; the hybridisation was less than expected and hybrids had decreased vigour. Within the <b>hooded</b> crow species, four subspecies are recognized, with one, the Mesopotamian crow, possibly distinct enough to warrant species status itself.|$|E
5|$|Sora, Donald, Goofy, and Jiminy Cricket {{walk down}} a winding path in search of Riku and King Mickey. A man dressed in a black, <b>hooded</b> coat appears and directs Sora towards a massive {{fortress}} called Castle Oblivion. Upon entering, the travelers realize that they have forgotten all of their abilities. The <b>hooded</b> man explains that the deeper {{they go into the}} castle, the more memories they will lose, but they will also uncover new memories in the process. He creates a deck of cards made from Sora's and his friends' memories, and tells them that everything they encounter in this castle will be based on their memories.|$|E
5|$|The IUCN Red List {{does not}} {{distinguish}} the <b>hooded</b> crow from the carrion crow, {{but the two}} species together have an extensive range, estimated at 10millionkm2 (3.8million mi2), and a large population, including an estimated 14 to 34 million individuals in Europe alone. They are not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), so are evaluated as Least Concern. The carrion crow/hooded crow hybrid zone is slowly spreading northwest, but the <b>hooded</b> crow has {{on the order of}} three million territories in just Europe (excluding Russia).|$|E
5|$|The <b>hooded</b> pitohui is monotypic, lacking any subspecies. Birds in {{the south}} east of New Guinea are {{sometimes}} separated into a proposed subspecies, P. d. monticola, but the differences are very slight and the supposed subspecies are generally regarded as inseparable.|$|E
5|$|The plumage of {{both sexes}} in both species are almost identical, with the only {{difference}} being iris colour in the lesser melampitta, the male having a red iris and the female a brown one. The plumage of juvenile lesser melampittas {{is the same as}} adults except they are brown on the lower body. Several researchers have noted that the plumage of juvenile greater melampittas resembles that of the <b>hooded</b> pitohui. <b>Hooded</b> pitohuis are unusual for birds in having a toxin, homobatrachotoxin, in their feathers and skin which can cause convulsions and death if consumed. The resemblance is probably an example of Batesian mimicry as the greater melampitta is not itself poisonous.|$|E
5|$|The typical {{lifespan}} is unknown, {{but that}} of the carrion crow is four years. The maximum recorded age for a <b>hooded</b> crow is 16 years, and 9 months.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} a {{secondary}} {{host of the}} parasitic great spotted cuckoo, the European magpie being the preferred host. However, {{in areas where the}} latter species is absent, such as Israel and Egypt, the <b>hooded</b> crow becomes the normal corvid host.|$|E
5|$|This species, {{like its}} relative, is seen {{regularly}} killed by farmers and on grouse estates. In County Cork, Ireland, the county's gun clubs shot over 23,000 <b>hooded</b> crows {{in two years}} in the early 1980s.|$|E
5|$|A prequel was {{released}} to iTunes on 1 September 2012, and to Zune and Amazon Video on 2 September 2012. In the prequel, a <b>hooded</b> messenger informs the Doctor that a woman, Darla von Karlsen, requests his help for her daughter. The messenger provides space-time coordinates {{to the planet}} Skaro, home planet of the Daleks.|$|E
5|$|Batman and Robin {{was another}} 15-chapter serial film {{released}} in 1949 by Columbia Pictures. Robert Lowery played Batman, while Johnny Duncan played Robin. Supporting players included Jane Adams as Vicki Vale and veteran character actor Lyle Talbot as Commissioner Gordon. The plot {{dealt with the}} Dynamic Duo facing off against the Wizard, a <b>hooded</b> villain whose identity remains a mystery throughout the serial until the end.|$|E
5|$|Black Moshannon Lake and the bogs of the Natural Area are {{especially}} important to the IBA. They serve as a stopover for migratory waterfowl and shorebirds. Waterfowl observed at the park include pied-billed and Slavonian grebes, common loon, American black duck, ruddy duck, blue-winged and green-winged teal, tundra swan, long-tailed duck, <b>hooded</b> and red-breasted merganser, greater and lesser scaup, northern pintail, bufflehead, American wigeon, and northern shoveler.|$|E
5|$|In 1990 {{scientists}} {{preparing the}} skins of the <b>hooded</b> pitohui for museum collections experienced numbness and burning when handling them. It {{was reported in}} 1992 that this species and two other pitohuis contained a neurotoxin called homobatrachotoxin, a derivative of batrachotoxin, in their tissues. This made them the first documented poisonous birds, other than some reports of coturnism caused by consuming quails (although toxicity in quails is unusual), and the first bird discovered with toxins in the skin. The same toxin had previously only been found in Colombian poison dart frogs from the genus Phyllobates (family Dendrobatidae). The batrachotoxin family of compounds are the most toxic compounds by weight in nature, being 250 times more toxic than strychnine. Later research found that the <b>hooded</b> pitohui had other batrachotoxins in its skin, including batrachotoxinin-A cis-crotonate, batrachotoxinin-A and batrachotoxinin-A 3′-hydroxypentanoate.|$|E
5|$|In Celtic folklore, {{the bird}} {{appears on the}} {{shoulder}} of the dying Cú Chulainn, and could also be a manifestation of the Morrígan, the wife of Tethra, or the Cailleach. This idea has persisted, and the <b>hooded</b> crow is associated with fairies in the Scottish highlands and Ireland; in the 18th century, Scottish shepherds would make offerings to them to keep them from attacking sheep. In Faroese folklore, a maiden would go out on Candlemas morn and throw a stone, then a bone, then a clump of turf at a <b>hooded</b> crow – if it flew over the sea, her husband would be a foreigner; if it landed on a farm or house, she would marry a man from there, but if it stayed put, she would remain unmarried.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} expansion, the protagonist travels to Rendashia, the central {{continent}} of Astoltia where Nelgel's seal was created. The protagonist investigates the demonic events there {{and continues to}} work towards stopping Nelgel for good. In the third expansion, the protagonist becomes embroiled in a royal power struggle, {{at the same time}} as a massive monster invasion of Astoltia, controlled by a mysterious <b>hooded</b> man.|$|E
5|$|One {{possible}} source {{has been}} identified in the forests of New Guinea: beetles of the genus Choresine (family Melyridae), which contain the toxin and {{have been found in}} the stomachs of <b>hooded</b> pitohui. An alternative explanation, that the birds and beetles both get the toxin from a third source, is considered unlikely as the blue-capped ifrit is almost exclusively insectivorous.|$|E
5|$|Other seals, {{like the}} walrus and most phocids, breed on ice with {{copulation}} usually {{taking place in}} the water (a few land-breeding species also mate in water). Females of these species tend to aggregate less. In addition, since ice is less stable than solid land, breeding sites change location each year, and males are unable to predict where females will stay during the breeding season. Hence polygyny tends to be weaker in ice-breeding species. An exception to this is the walrus, where females form dense aggregations perhaps due to their patchy food sources. Pinnipeds that breed on fast ice tend to cluster together more than those that breed on pack ice. Some of these species are serially monogamous, including the harp seal, crabeater seal and <b>hooded</b> seal. Seals that breed on ice tend to have little or no sexual dimorphism. In lobodontine seals, females are slightly longer than males. Walruses and <b>hooded</b> seals are unique among ice-breeding species in that they have pronounced sexual dimorphism in favor of males.|$|E
5|$|Prominent {{bird species}} {{seen in the}} park are both migratory and {{resident}} avifauna species. Some of the avifauna are the East Himalayan pied kingfisher, black kite, lesser sky-lark, northern hill myna, Burmese pied myna, North Indian black drongos, lesser eastern jungle crow, yellow headed wagtail, spotbill duck, blue-winged teal, ruddy shell duck, <b>hooded</b> crane, Burmese sarus crane, Indian white-breasted waterhen and crimson-breasted pied woodpecker.|$|E
5|$|The female half has karanda-mukuta (a basket-shaped crown) on {{her head}} or well-combed knotted hair or both. The left ear wears a valika-kundala (a type of earring). A tilaka or bindu (a round red dot) adorns her forehead, {{matching}} Shiva's third eye. The left eye is painted with black eyeliner. While the male neck is sometimes adorned with a jewelled <b>hooded</b> serpent, the female neck has a blue lotus matching it.|$|E
5|$|The {{function}} of the toxins to the <b>hooded</b> pitohui has {{been the source of}} debate and research since its discovery. The initial suggestion was that the toxins acted as a chemical deterrent to predators. Some researchers cautioned this suggestion was premature, and others noted that the levels of batrachotoxins were three orders of magnitude lower than in the poison dart frogs that do use it in this way.|$|E
5|$|The old name of Royston crow {{originates}} {{from the}} days when this bird was a common winter visitor to southern England, the sheep fields around Royston, Hertfordshire, providing carcasses on which the birds could feed. The local newspaper, founded in 1855, is called The Royston Crow, and the <b>hooded</b> crow is also featured on the crest of the North Hertfordshire District Council.|$|E
5|$|Anderton {{goes to a}} {{black market}} doctor for a risky eye {{transplant}} {{so as to avoid}} the citywide optical recognition system. He returns to PreCrime and kidnaps Agatha, shutting down the system, as the Precogs operate as a group mind. Anderton takes Agatha to a hacker to extract the minority report of Leo Crow, but none exists; instead, Agatha shows him an image of the murder of Ann Lively, a woman who was drowned by a <b>hooded</b> figure in 2049.|$|E
5|$|As young {{children}} Laura Porter {{and her brother}} Henry witness their parents' brutal murder by a <b>hooded</b> man, whom {{they believe to be}} the Boogeyman. As an adult, Henry has attended group therapy, improving such that he is instead currently looking for work. Laura joins this group as he leaves, meeting the other members: nyctophobic Mark, germaphobic Paul, masochistic Alison, agoraphobic and commitment-averse Darren, and Nicky, a bulimic girl who fears extreme weight gain.|$|E
5|$|David {{follows the}} janitor to the victims' house, frees the {{children}} and finds their mother raped and killed, but the janitor ambushes him and pushes him off a balcony into a swimming pool. David nearly drowns (since he cannot swim), but the children rescue him. He then attacks the janitor from behind and strangles him to death while once more remaining uninjured. That night, he and Audrey reconcile. The following morning, he secretly shows a newspaper article on the anonymous heroic act, featuring a sketch of David in his <b>hooded</b> rain poncho, to his son, who recognizes the hero as his father.|$|E
5|$|For {{every ten}} ghosts appeased, Dinah and Vincent get a tower guard {{to help with}} their task. Over {{the course of the}} series, they meet two of the guards: Edaniel, a {{grinning}} cat-like creature, and his brother Edrear, who secretly likes Dinah. Vincent dies while in one of the vaults, causing Dinah to become depressed. Later, the <b>hooded</b> angel, which normally guards the entrance to the mausoleum, appears as two stones that talk to Dinah and help her overcome the depression which resulted from Vincent's death.|$|E
5|$|In Traverse City, Michigan, Mary Lefante {{goes to a}} local {{pharmacy}} to get her passport photo taken. Realizing she {{has forgotten}} her wallet, she returns to her car and finds that her boyfriend has been murdered. The killer, clad in a <b>hooded</b> raincoat, renders Lefante unconscious with a hypodermic needle, then kidnaps her. Meanwhile, in the pharmacy, the elderly clerk peels open Lefante's developed photo, which shows her screaming amidst a distorted background.|$|E
5|$|Predators of {{the corn}} crake on its European {{breeding}} grounds include feral and domestic cats, introduced American mink, feral ferrets, otters and red foxes, and birds including the common buzzard and <b>hooded</b> crow. In Lithuania, the introduced raccoon dog has also been recorded taking corn crakes. When chicks are exposed by rapid mowing, they may be taken by large birds including the white stork, harriers and other birds of prey, gulls and corvids. At undisturbed sites, nests and broods are rarely attacked, which {{is reflected in the}} high breeding success.|$|E
