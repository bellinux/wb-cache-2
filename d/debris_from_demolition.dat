40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{an issue}} of growing importance in the construction industry. The construction of a single family home in the United States typically produces between two and four tons of debris, the majority of which is discarded in landfills, {{despite the fact that}} 80 percent of this has recycling potential. <b>Debris</b> <b>from</b> <b>demolition</b> also has significant recycling potential. Construction and demolition (C&D) debris combined comprises 24 percent of municipal solid waste, which is leading to increased costs and regulation. Some municipalities now ban C&D waste from landfills. Some progress is being made in diverting such waste from landfills, but substantial barriers still exist to a widespread adoption of environmentally sound waste management practices at construction sites...|$|E
40|$|Currently the {{problems}} of water quality are increasing; much of the material is rinsed and is dragged into streams, rivers, and groundwater from the contaminated superficial draining, which contains materials that are applied to the soil surface. Therefore is that the provide {{the greatest amount of}} uncontaminated water to the subsurface is of great importance, since it can still potentially solve some important collateral problems, such as the settlement in the soil, which is related largely to levels low capacity of the aquifer. Therefore, use Pervious Concrete (PCo) can help prevent physical barrier between rainwater and underground (especially in urban areas). For the investigation of the feasibility of PCo three types of aggregate were used: Round Natural Aggregate (RNA), Natural Crushed Aggregate (NCA) and Recycled Aggregate from Concrete crushed (RAC),since the shape of the aggregates generally determines the mechanical properties; and yet very little is known about their correlation with permeability. Moreover, concrete recycling is an effective way for the elimination of <b>debris</b> <b>from</b> <b>demolition</b> as well as replace part of the cement by waste material as the Silica Fume (SF); in both cases, these actions production decreases and CO 2 emissions associated with their production. In this work different aggregates with a substitution of SF are evaluated, for know physical and mechanical properties of pervious concrete and in part to contribute to solving the environmental problem of the construction.

50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, {{a new project}} was created in {{addition}} to those that had been developed in the northern city areas which consisted of reclaiming land from the river in front of the old “Costanera Sur” Riverside Resort. The land-filling started in 1978 using the Dutch “polder” system; embankments were built using <b>debris</b> <b>from</b> <b>demolitions</b> carried out to construct urban motorways. As the zone within the embankments filled with silt from the river, the water confined inside was drained, though this work was not fully completed.|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{municipal}} solid waste generation in Hong Kong has been increasing. One {{of the characteristics of}} waste generation is the disproportionally large quantity of construction waste among all types of solid waste. Building <b>debris</b> resulting <b>from</b> <b>demolition</b> works constitutes a substantial proportion of the waste quantity. The paper outlines a method for the estimation of the quantity of demolition waste generation in Hong Kong and evaluates the different options that are available for demolition waste management.

50|$|Former Browns owner Art Modell {{took over}} control of the stadium from the city in the 1970s and while his {{organization}} made improvements to the facility, it continued to decline. The Indians played their final game at the stadium in October 1993 and moved to Jacobs Field the following season. Although plans were announced to renovate the stadium for use by the Browns, in 1995 Modell announced his intentions to move the team to Baltimore citing the state of Cleveland Stadium as a major factor. The Browns played their final game at the stadium in December 1995. As part of an agreement between Modell, the city of Cleveland, and the NFL, the Browns were officially deactivated for three seasons and the city was required to construct a new stadium on the Cleveland Stadium site. Cleveland Stadium was demolished in 1996 to make way for FirstEnergy Stadium, which opened in 1999.

(Funded by Falmouth University and GAFA) Working with the dust and <b>debris</b> <b>from</b> a <b>demolition</b> site near to the gallery the work for this exhibition explored ideas relating to ephemerality and loss. The gallery space was transformed into for a site related work where drawings were made directly onto the wall alongside animation and sound. The space that is yet to completely disappear, it sits in between, neither becoming nor disintegrating, like a lost or forgotten object. Responding to spaces that hover outside the rational, that are forgotten or abandoned evoke a transitional state that seemingly has no end. I am interested in the places that grief resides, the liminal landscape. It is fluid and irrational like grief. Liminal space is described as being a permutable, a trance like state where the rational is suspended, the space in between, an interlude...|$|R
40|$|For many decades, stony <b>debris</b> <b>from</b> {{building}} and <b>demolition</b> sites was reused as road building material. Until recently {{there was no}} need to look for other uses for this mixture of concrete and masonry rubble. However, now that our supplies of marl and gravel (two of the three ingredients of mortar and concrete) are dwindling and prices are beginning to rise, the concrete industry is showing a growing interest in ways to recycle concrete rubble. Since masonry rubble can only be used as a granulate for road construction in combination with concrete rubble, a vision of a masonry rubble heap without any takers looms ahead if no alternative application is found. Anticipating the problem,civil engineer Koen Van Dijk of the Civil Engineering Materials Science department at tu Delft has developed a number of processing techniques for reusing masonry rubble. Van Dijk was recently gained his doctorate for developing a process that can extract 50 % of the bricks <b>from</b> masonry <b>debris</b> <b>from</b> buildings that have been dismantled selectively. He also uses a magnetic technique to extract the brick fraction from the remaining masonry debris. Mixed with fresh clay it becomes the raw material for a new generation of bricks, thus closing the clay brick cycle. Delft University of Technolog...|$|R
50|$|Secaucus was {{originally}} an agricultural community specializing in flowers. It later became {{known for its}} pig farms {{in the first half}} of the 20th century. In the early 1900s the town was home to approximately 55 pig farms, which housed nearly 250,000 pigs, which outnumbered humans 16 to 1. These farms served the meat demands of Newark and New York, and made the farmers wealthy. Many of them were local politicians, most notably pork peddler Henry B. Krajewski, who ran for New Jersey senator, three times for governor and twice for U.S. President. The town's pig farms, rendering plants, and junk yards gave the town a reputation for being one of the most odorous in the New York metropolitan area. In the 1950s the pig farms began to dwindle, partially due to construction on the New Jersey Turnpike, which would carry tourists who would not appreciate the odor. In 1963, <b>debris</b> <b>from</b> the <b>demolition</b> of Pennsylvania Station was dumped in the Secaucus Meadowlands. In later decades Secaucus became more of a commuter town. In a non-binding referendum in 1969, 90% of voters in Secaucus chose to leave Hudson County and join Bergen County, as that county was more similar in character and had lower taxes. However, only the state has the authority to change county lines, so it never came to fruition. Today it remains the most suburban town in Hudson County.|$|R

40|$|Il Guasto” is {{an urban}} context, {{a place in}} the heart of the {{historic}} city of Bologna which is a mound of <b>debris</b> (resulting <b>from</b> the <b>demolition</b> of an important building, the Bentivoglio Family palace during a popular revolt in the 1506) on top of which a “public garden” was created 40 years ago. The garden is well known in Bologna as “Giardino del Guasto”. Underneath, in between the debris, an underground space (bunker) was created to protect the citizen during the bombing of the second world war. The aim of the Design Studio of Azrieli School of Architecture and Urbanism, Carleton University (Ottawa, Canada), DSA Directed Studies Abroad (January 15 th - April 13 th, 2012), is to exercise creativity and design skills in an historical context bearing some negative connotations. A spell was cast on the site and the negative effects of this spell are still perceivable today after more than five hundred years. This makes us ponder upon the notions of permanence and durability (of architecture and ideas) in the urban fabric and in the meanders of human memory. The site, centered on a garden, has been undergoing many changes in use, purpose and meaning and today still requires to be reimagined in the social context of the city and its famous university.  [In the menu on the right, ARTICLE TOOLS, in "Supplementary Files" link you can download the. pdf presentations of Carleton University students, related to the workshop on Giardino del Guasto area, developed in Bologna in 2012]...|$|R
