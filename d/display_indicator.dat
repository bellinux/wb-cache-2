A brief investigation of the effects of noise, input bandwidth and system delay upon the FFT and LSE techniques was undertaken using synthetic data. Data from a piloted simulation conducted at NASA Ames Research Center was then analyzed. The simulation was performed in the NASA Ames Research Center Variable Stability CH- 47 B helicopter operating in fixed-basis simulator mode. The piloting task consisted of maintaining the simulated vehicle over a moving hover pad whose motion was described by a random-appearing sum of sinusoids.

A fixed base simulator test was conducted with twenty test pilot subjects using the Flight Simulator Demonstration Model which incorporated a Helium Neon laser as the light bar medium. Two separate flight {{tests were conducted}} by the Test Pilot School classes 80 A and 80 B in a Twin Otter commuter aircraft using the Stage A Model PVHD. The Xenon lighted A Model was tested in its original configuration by class 80 A. Class 80 B used a modified configuration which incorporated an AFFTC designed and manufactured hood. With the hood, the PVHD projected a thinner, distinct light bar. Only a few general remarks concerning the tests and unrestricted, overall conclusions reached by the author are presented. The conclusions of all three AFFTC evaluations of the PVHD concept were {{that it has not}} yet been adequately evaluated. There seems to be a significant learning curve associated with the PVHD and the project pilots for Test Pilot School Class 80 B only got a good start on the learning curve.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{investigation}} is to determine design limitations and architectural solutions that limit the impact light from <b>displays</b> and <b>indicator</b> lamps have on the operational environment task lighting and lighting countermeasure spectrum constraints. It is concerning that this innovative architectural lighting system, could be compromised by spectrums from display systems, architectural materials, and structures that are not considered as part a full system design implementation. The introduction of many Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) products to the spacecraft volume that contain LEDs, without consideration to the human factors and biological constraints, is another problem. <b>Displays</b> and <b>indicators</b> are {{a necessary part of}} the spacecraft and it is the goal of this research project to determine constraints and solutions that allow these systems to be integrated while minimizing how the lighting environment is modified by them. Due to the potentially broad scope of this endeavor, the project team developed constraints for the evaluation. The evaluation will be on a set of tasks that required significant exposure in the same environment while having a large chance of impacting the light spectrum the crew is expected to receive from the architectural lighting system. The team plans to use recent HRP research on "Net Habitable Volume" [1] to provide the boundary conditions for volume size. A Zemax lighting model was developed of a small enclosure that had high intensity overhead lighting and a standard intensity <b>display</b> with LED <b>indicator</b> arrays. The computer model demonstrated a work surface illuminated at a high level by the overhead light source compared to <b>displays</b> and <b>indicators</b> whose light is parallel to the work plane. The overhead lighting oversaturated spectral contributions from the <b>display</b> and <b>indicator</b> at the task work surface. Interestingly, when the observer looked at the displays and LEDs within the small enclosure, their spectral contribution was significant but could be reduced by reflecting overhead light from the wall(s) to the observer. Direct observation of displays and LEDs are an issue because the user's viewing area is a display, not an illuminated work surface.

40|$|This {{research}} introduced two new {{scales for}} {{the identification and}} measurement of negative sentiment and insider risk in communications {{in order to examine}} the unexplored relationship between these two constructs. The inter-rater reliability and criterion validity of the Scale of Negativity in Texts (SNIT) and the Scale of Insider Risk in Digital Communications (SIRDC) were established with a random sample of email from the Enron archive and criterion measures from established insiders, disgruntled employees, suicidal, depressed, angry, anxious and other sampled groups. In addition, the sensitivity of the scales to changes over time as the risk of digital attack increased and transitioned to a physical attack was also examined in an actual case study. Inter-rater reliability for the SNIT was extremely high across groups while the SIRDC produced lower, but acceptable levels of agreement. Both measures also significantly distinguished the criterion groups from the overall Enron sample. The scales were then used to measure the frequency of negative sentiment and insider risk indicators in the random Enron sample and {{the relationship between the two}} constructs. While low levels of negative sentiment were found in 20 % of the sample, moderate and high levels of negative sentiment were extremely rare, occurring in less than 1 % of communications. Less than 4 % of the sampled emails <b>displayed</b> <b>indicators</b> of insider risk on the SIRDC. Emails containing high levels of insider risk comprised less than one percent or the sample. Of the emails containing negative sentiment in the sample, only 16. 3 %, also <b>displayed</b> <b>indicators</b> of insider risk.

Despite the fact that the average indicators of over-assessment and under-assessment of respondents in Saintes-Maries-de-la-mer were less precise in their calculation than the other study sites, they provided information about the general trend of individuals’ perception of the spatial extent of areas exposed to coastal flooding.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has documented shifts in women’s attractions to their romantic partner and to men {{other than their}} partner across the ovulation cycle, contingent on {{the degree to which}} her partner <b>displays</b> hypothesized <b>indicators</b> of high-fitness genes. The current study set out to replicate and extend this finding. Forty-one couples in which the woman was naturally cycling participated. Female partners reported their feelings of in-pair attraction and extra-pair attraction on two occasions, once on a low-fertility day of the cycle and once on a high-fertility day of the cycle just prior to ovulation. Ovulation was confirmed using luteinizing hormone tests. We collected two measures of male partner sexual attractiveness. First, the women in the study rated their partner’s sexual attractiveness. Second, we photographed the partners and had the photos independently rated for attractiveness. Shifts in women’s in-pair attractions across the cycle were significantly moderated by women’s ratings of partner sexual attractiveness, such that the less sexually attractive women rated their partner, the less in-pair attraction they reported at high fertility compared with low fertility (partial r =. 37, pdir =. 01). Shifts in women’s extra-pair attractions across the cycle were significantly moderated by third-party ratings of partner attractiveness, such that the less attractive the partner was, the more extra-pair attraction women reported at high relative to low fertility (partial r = 2. 33, pdir =. 03). In line with previous findings, we found support for the hypothesis that {{the degree to which a}} woman’s romantic partner <b>displays</b> <b>indicators</b> of high-fitness genes affects women’s attractions to their own partner an...|$|R
