40|$|The {{rating of}} impact sound {{insulation}} {{on the basis of}} tapping machine measurements with the ISO reference values has proved to be unsatisfactory in practice. This is mainly due to the differences in spectrum shape of tapping machine noise and real life <b>impact</b> <b>noises,</b> such as walking. The problem can be solved by changing the reference values in accordance with these differences in spectrum shape. The difference between tapping and walking noise spectra has been established by measurements on 49 different floors. In the most important frequency range (125 - 500 Hz) it was discovered to be sufficiently constant for all the floor constructions considered. Thus a new set of reference values has been derived, {{based on the assumption that}} the NR-curves provide a correct subjective rating system for walking noise. In addition, due account has been taken of the different frequency content at higher frequencies of <b>impact</b> <b>noises</b> other than those made by walking males, such as those made by walking females, jumping children, the moving of furniture, etc. © 1976...|$|R

Durability, which affects aesthetics over time, can determine the longer term usefulness and effectiveness of the space, including possible long term health impacts on students.

5000|$|While some {{consider}} the noise reduction of a suppressor significant enough to permit safe shooting without hearing protection ("hearing safe"), noise-induced hearing loss may occur at 85 time-weighted-average decibels or above if exposed for a prolonged period, and suppressed gunshots regularly meter above 130 dB. However, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration uses 140 dB as the [...] "safety cutoff" [...] for impulsive noise, {{which has led}} most U.S. manufacturers to advertise sub-140 dB suppressors as [...] "hearing safe". Current OSHA standards would allow no more than sub-single-second exposure to <b>impact</b> <b>noise</b> over 130 dB per 24 hours. That would equate to a single [...]308 round fired through a very efficient suppressor. This result effectively requires all users of suppressors to wear additional ear protection.|$|E

5000|$|In the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) {{describes}} {{standards for}} occupational noise exposure in articles 1910.95 and 1926.52. OSHA states that an employer must implement hearing conservation programs for employees if {{the noise level}} of the workplace is equal to or above 85 dB(A) for an averaged eight-hour time period. OSHA also states that [...] "exposure to impulsive or <b>impact</b> <b>noise</b> should not exceed 140 dB peak sound pressure level". [...] The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommends that all worker exposures to noise should be controlled below a level equivalent to 85 dBA for eight hours to minimize occupational noise induced hearing loss. NIOSH also recommends a 3 dBA exchange rate so that every increase by 3 dBA doubles {{the amount of the}} noise and halves the recommended amount of exposure time.The United States Department of Defense (DoD) instruction 605512 has some differences from OSHA 1910.95 standard, for example, OSHA 1910.95 uses a 5 dB exchange rate and DoD instruction 605512 uses a 3 dB exchange rate.|$|E

40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence that individuals in many species avoid areas exposed to chronic anthropogenic <b>noise,</b> but the <b>impact</b> of <b>noise</b> {{on those who}} remain in these habitats is unclear. One potential impact is chronic physiological stress, which can affect disease resistance, survival and reproductive success. Previous studies have found evidence of elevated stress-related hormones (glucocorticoids) in wildlife exposed to human activities, but the <b>impacts</b> of <b>noise</b> alone are difficult to separate from confounding factors. Here we used an experimental playback study to isolate the <b>impacts</b> of <b>noise</b> from industrial activity (natural gas drilling and road noise) on glucocorticoid levels in greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus), a species of conservation concern. We non-invasively measured immunoreactive corticosterone metabolites from fecal samples (FCMs) of males on both noise-treated and control leks (display grounds) in two breeding seasons. We found strong support for an <b>impact</b> of <b>noise</b> playback on stress levels, with 16. 7 % higher mean FCM levels in samples from noise leks compared with samples from paired control leks.

50|$|The {{blocks of}} flats were {{particularly}} problematic. The deck-access design and repetitive use of stairwell towers, {{where there was}} an absence of natural surveillance, encouraged criminal activity, and made the control of these problems very difficult. Occupants complained of anti-social behaviour; high rental and heating costs; <b>impact</b> <b>noise</b> entering their homes resulting from use of the pedestrian access decks; an inability to personalise the exterior of their homes; an absence of private garden spaces for the mid-level family duplexes; remoteness from local shopping and public transport facilities; and pollution from the oil-fired power plant. Moreover, the radical and harsh appearance of the development was not to the tastes of many residents who preferred the more traditional housing built elsewhere in the New Town. The combination of these factors led to {{a significant proportion of}} the estate's families leaving the development to be replaced by younger, single people, which often exacerbated the problems. A large number of homes were left vacant and these became prone to vandalism. The estate's condition deteriorated throughout the 1980s and by 1989, the Development Corporation took the decision to demolish and replace the estate, despite it being barely 15 years old.|$|E
40|$|Buildings {{with wooden}} floor constructions and wooden buildings, like {{prefabricated}} single family houses, {{have a long}} tradition in Germany. From {{the middle of the}} 1990 s, additionally, multi-storey houses of wood construction have been allowed in many European countries. In general, those multi-dwelling houses have to fulfil the same acoustic requirements as concrete buildings. Especially the <b>impact</b> <b>noise</b> requirements can be difficult to meet. Even when they are fulfilled, the main complaints in wooden buildings are due to low frequency impact noises. The weighted <b>impact</b> <b>noise</b> level {{does not take into account}} frequencies below 100 Hz, and the spectrum adaption term CI can only consider frequencies down to 50 Hz. It is not clear, if subjective judgements are influenced by frequencies below 50 Hz. It is obvious, that the weighted <b>impact</b> <b>noise</b> level does not agree to subjective judgements. Additionally, the tapping machine has a different excitation characteristic than real walking people and other sources of <b>impact</b> <b>noise.</b> In the research project "AcuWood", the <b>impact</b> <b>noise</b> of wooden floor constructions are investigated.

The efficiency of these Iterative Learning Control (ILC) algorithms is demonstrated extensively in this paper. The developed ASAC strategy has been verified on a thick steel plate, which is excited by successive impacts. The obtained results show that ASAC can be a very efficient transient noise control technique in certain industrial applications (e. g. presses, punching machines, [...] .). ...|$|E

40|$|A {{hybrid model}} for the {{prediction}} of <b>impact</b> <b>noise</b> at railway crossings is presented. The hybrid model combines the simulation of vertical wheel‒rail contact force in the time domain and the prediction of sound pressure level using a linear frequency-domain model. The time-domain model uses moving Green’s functions for the vehicle and track models (accounting for wheel flexibility and a discretely supported rail with space-variant beam properties) and a non-Hertzian wheel‒rail contact model. The time-domain and frequency-domain models are coupled based {{on the concept of}} an equivalent roughness spectrum. The model is demonstrated by investigating the influence of axle load, vehicle speed and wheel profile on generated <b>impact</b> <b>noise</b> levels. A negligible influence on <b>impact</b> <b>noise</b> is observed for axle loads in the interval 15 – 25 tonnes. On the other hand, increasing vehicle speed from 80 km/h to 150 km/h, or comparing a nominal S 1002 wheel profile with a severely hollow worn profile, result in substantially higher levels of impact noise; for the given wheel and track conditions the differences are in the order of 10 dB(A) ...|$|E
