5|$|Although {{missing person}} cases are {{normally}} handled by {{local and state}} police, the FBI joined the investigation ten <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>she</b> disappeared. The FBI interviewed family from Massachusetts, and the Haverhill police chief disclosed that the search was now nationwide. Ten days after her disappearance, New Hampshire Fish and Game conducted a second ground and air search, using a helicopter with a thermal imaging camera, tracking dogs and cadaver dogs. Murray's older sister discovered a ripped white pair of women's underwear lying in the snow on a secluded trail near French Pond Road on February 26, but DNA tests found that the underwear {{did not belong to}} Murray.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, {{the body}} of a 38-year-old woman, seven months pregnant, was {{discovered}} in an open field four <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>she</b> had disappeared from her residence in Panama. A plastic bag had been left over her head, and she had been gagged; the case was ruled a homicide. The body had suffered from the tropical heat and high humidity, and was bloated and highly discolored. At autopsy, the remains of the fetus were discovered in the woman's undergarments. Although the fetus was in a similar state of decomposition, the umbilical cord was intact and still attached to the placenta inside the uterus.|$|E
5|$|Three vice-presidents succeeded to the {{presidency}} due {{to the death of}} presidents - Sergio Osmeña (1944), Elpidio Quirino (1948) and Carlos P. Garcia (1957). They did not nominate a new vice-president, since the 1935 constitution was silent on the matter; a new vice-president would sit after the results of following elections were known. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo became president after the Supreme Court ruled that President Joseph Estrada resigned. Arroyo appointed Teofisto Guingona <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>she</b> ascended to power. The 1987 constitution mandated the President to nominate a vice-president from a member of the Congress of the Philippines, in which both houses vote separately for confirmation via a majority vote.|$|E

5|$|Many myths {{surrounding}} vampires originated {{during the}} medieval period. The 12th-century English historians and chroniclers Walter Map and William of Newburgh recorded accounts of revenants, though records in English legends of vampiric beings after this date are scant. The Old Norse draugr is another medieval {{example of an}} undead creature with similarities to vampires. Vampire-like beings were rarely written about in Jewish literature; the 16th-century rabbi David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra (Radbaz) wrote of an uncharitable old woman whose body was unguarded and unburied for three <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>she</b> died and rose as a vampiric entity, killing hundreds of people. He linked this event {{to the lack of}} a shmirah (guarding) after death as the corpse could be a vessel for evil spirits.|$|E
5|$|On October 18, 1952, Williams and Billie Jean Jones Eshlimar {{were married}} in Minden, Louisiana by a justice of the peace. It was the second {{marriage}} for both (each being divorced with children). The next day two public ceremonies were also held at the New Orleans Civic Auditorium, where 14,000 seats were sold for each. After Williams' death, a judge ruled that the wedding was not legal because Jones Eshlimar's divorce had not become final until eleven <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>she</b> married Williams. Williams' first wife, Audrey, and his mother, Lillie Williams, were the driving forces behind having the marriage declared invalid and pursued the matter for years. Williams had also married Audrey Sheppard before her divorce was final, on the tenth day of a required 60-day reconciliation period.|$|E

Speck's brother Howard was a carpenter in Monmouth and found a job for him sanding plasterboard for another Monmouth carpenter. Speck became angry when he learned his ex-wife had remarried two <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>she</b> was granted a divorce on March 16, 1966. He moved to the Christy Hotel in downtown Monmouth on March 25 and {{spent most of his time}} in the downtown taverns.

25|$|On 29 January 2003, Nat Fraser {{was convicted}} by a {{majority}} verdict at the High Court at Edinburgh, before Lord Mackay of Drumadoon and a jury, {{of the murder of}} his wife Arlene. He was duly sentenced to life imprisonment with a punishment part of 25 years. His wife had disappeared in 1998 and he insisted that he was innocent of any involvement in her disappearance and presumed death. The cornerstone of the Crown's case against Fraser was that on 7 May he had returned certain rings from the dead body of his wife, 9 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>she</b> vanished, in order to foster the appearance that she had decided to leave of her own volition. The trial judge directed the jury that they were obliged to acquit Fraser if they were unsure that he had returned the rings to the house.|$|E

25|$|In autumn 2011, Chibnall pitched Broadchurch to Laura Mackie, the Head of Drama at ITV, who proved very {{enthusiastic}} about the proposal. Just <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>she</b> finished reading the scripts, she suggested Chibnall work with Kudos Film and Television, a well-known production company. Kudos immediately agreed to produce the series. Mackie then brought the show to ITV Director of Television Peter Fincham, who green-lit the project almost immediately. ITV wanted the series to air in early 2013, which meant that filming had {{to occur in the}} summer of 2012. That gave Broadchurch a much shorter pre-production schedule that usual. ITV wanted a high-quality series despite the time constraint. According to Chibnall, ITV advised him to make the series as bold as possible and to ignore commercial considerations. Fincham and Chibnall discussed stripping Broadchurch over a series of four or five nights, rather than as a weekly program. But both men rejected the idea. Fincham was keen to allow speculation to build over time, and to give viewers a chance to engage in conversation about each episode before the next one aired.|$|E
25|$|Willem van der Zaan {{remained}} at Portsmouth until 23 May 1945. She returned to Shadwell on the 24th, then escorted three LCI to Ostend, arriving there on 29 May, {{four years and}} 16 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>she</b> was forced to leave. The next day she sailed to Rotterdam, remaining there until 6 August, {{when she returned to}} Shadwell, to be prepared for detachment to the Netherlands East Indies. She sailed on 2 September 1945, arriving back at Tanjung Priok on 8 October. There she was deployed on patrols, and transported former POW's, before returning to Rotterdam on 7 June 1946. She served in the Netherlands East Indies again between March 1947 and July 1948, and was then stationed in the Dutch West Indies until January 1950. She was rebuilt and recommissioned as a frigate (renumbered F824) in 1950, serving until early 1961 when she was berthed at Vlissingen to serve as accommodation and repair ship for the Mijnendienst ("Mine Service"). Willem van der Zaan was renumbered A880 in September 1963, and finally decommissioned on 27 February 1970.
