The family <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> <b>through</b> many taxonomic revisions since it was defined by Nopcsa in 1902. It is now recognized as a junior synonym of the family Nodosauridae. The subfamily now includes the genera Anoplosaurus, Europelta, Hungarosaurus, and Struthiosaurus, designated as the type genus. Because of the instability of Acanthopholis, the generic namesake of Acanthopholinae, and its current identification as a nomen dubium, Struthiosaurinae, the next named group, was decidedly used over the older one.|$|E

5|$|The character's {{physical}} appearance <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> <b>through</b> many transformations, with various special makeup effects artists making their {{mark on the}} character's design, including makeup artist Stan Winston. Tom Savini's initial design has been the basis {{for many of the}} later incarnations. The trademark hockey goalie mask did not appear until Friday the 13th PartIII. Since , filmmakers have given Jason superhuman strength, regenerative powers, and near invulnerability. He has been seen as a sympathetic character, whose motivation for killing has been cited as being driven by the immoral actions of his victims and his own rage over having drowned as a child. Jason Voorhees has been featured in various humor magazines, referenced in feature films, parodied in television shows, and was the inspiration for a horror punk band. Several toy lines have been released based on various versions of the character from the Friday the 13th films. Jason Voorhees's hockey mask is a widely recognized image in popular culture.|$|E
5|$|The modern {{format for}} the World Championship {{features}} 16 {{teams in the}} championship group, 12 teams in Division I and 12 teams in Division II. If {{there are more than}} 40 teams, the rest compete in Division III. The teams in the championship play a preliminary round, then the top eight teams play in the playoff medal round and the winning team is crowned World Champion. Over the years, the tournament <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> <b>through</b> several rule changes. In 1969 body-checking in all three zones in a rink was allowed, helmets and goaltender masks became mandatory in the early 1970s and in 1992 the IIHF began using the shootout. The current IIHF rules differ slightly from the rules used in the NHL. The World Championships have been open to all players, both professional and amateur, since 1977. The IIHF requires that players are citizens of the country they represent and allow players to switch national teams provided that they play in their new nation for a certain period of time.|$|E
