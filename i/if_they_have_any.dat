The Radio Times issued its own list of missing episodes. The magazine has also set up an email address specifically for Doctor Who missing episodes that the public can use to contact it <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> information.|$|E
5|$|Agathias' and Zosimus' figures, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> {{validity}} at all, {{may represent}} the official, as opposed to actual, strength of the Constantinian army. In reality, the slim evidence is that late units were often severely under-strength, perhaps only about two-thirds of official. Thus Agathias' 600,000 on paper may have been no more than c. 400,000 in reality. The latter figure accords well with the other global figure from ancient sources, by the 6th-century writer John Lydus, of 389,704 (excluding fleets) for the army of Diocletian. Lydus' figure is accorded greater credibility than Agathias' by scholars because of its precision (implying that it was found in an official document) {{and the fact that}} it is ascribed to a specific time period.|$|E
25|$|A {{player who}} cannot pay what they owe is {{bankrupt}} and {{eliminated from the}} game. If the bankrupt player owes the bank, they must turn all of their assets over to the bank, who then auctions off their properties (<b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>any),</b> except buildings. If the debt is instead to another player, all the assets are instead given to that opponent, but the new owner must still pay the bank to un-mortgage any such properties received. The winner is the remaining player left after all the others have gone bankrupt.|$|E

500|$|Following {{his return}} from the Middle East, Jackson was briefly an {{instructor}} at No.1 Service Flying Training School, based at RAAF Station Point Cook, Victoria. He wrote to his wife, [...] "I just loathe this joint. This training is a tough job and I take my hat off to the boys who {{have been doing it}} since war broke out... every one of these instructors is longing to be sent overseas, but I doubt <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> chance of ever getting there—they are so valuable here." [...] In January 1942, he was posted to No.4 Squadron, which operated Wirraways in Canberra.|$|E
500|$|A female often forms a {{long-lasting}} social {{relationship with}} a male in her troop, known as a [...] "friendship". These nonsexual affiliative friendships benefit both the male and female. Males benefit from these relationships because they are usually formed soon after he immigrates into a new group, and helps the male integrate into the group more easily. He could also potentially end up mating with his female friend in the future. Females gain protection from threats to themselves and their infants (<b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>any).</b> Males occasionally [...] "baby-sit" [...] for their female friends, so she can feed and forage freely without the burden of having to carry or watch the infant. Sexually receptive females and newly immigrated males can form such friendships. These relationships are sometimes enduring and the pair grooms and remains close to each other. They also travel, forage, sleep, and raise infants together, as well as fight together against aggressive conspecifics.|$|E

2500|$|Even with a {{high level}} of {{training}} the hypercapnic urge to breathe is almost impossible to overcome; swimmers typically suffer an uncontrollable, violent, deep inhalation of water even when, intellectually, they know that to do so is fatal. This is a simple case of running out of air and drowning. [...] Victims of ascent blackout, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> water in the lungs at all will have a limited amount in the bronchi consistent with natural ingress after death.|$|E
2500|$|Hypoglycemia, or low blood glucose, {{can happen}} even with care, since insulin {{requirements}} can change without warning. Some common reasons for hypoglycemia include increased or unplanned exercise, illness, or medication interactions, where another medication [...] {{the effects of}} the insulin. Vomiting and diarrhea episodes can bring on a hypoglycemia reaction, due to dehydration or simply a case of too much insulin and not enough properly digested food. Symptoms of hypoglycemia need to be taken seriously and addressed promptly. Since serious hypoglycemia can be fatal, it is better to treat a suspected incident than to fail to respond quickly to the signs of actual hypoglycemia. Dr. Audrey Cook addressed the issue in her 2007 article on diabetes mellitus: [...] "Hypoglycemia is deadly; hyperglycemia is not. Owners must clearly understand that too much insulin can kill, and that they should call a veterinarian or halve the dose <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> concerns about a pet's well-being or appetite. Tell owners to offer food immediately if the pet is weak or is behaving strangely." ...|$|E

25|$|Large {{numbers of}} {{families}} relocated to safer places, usually remote rural areas, bringing along household slaves <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>any.</b> Mary Massey argues these elite exiles introduced {{an element of}} defeatism into the southern outlook.|$|R
