40|$|Across taxa, the {{presence}} of sexual ornaments in one sex is usually correlated with disproportionately great parental effort by the other. Frigatebirds (<b>Fregatidae)</b> are sexually dimorphic, with males exhibiting morphological and behavioral ornaments, but males and females share {{in all aspects of}} parental effort. All other taxa in a clade of 237 species exhibit biparental care, but only frigatebirds exhibit pronounced sexual dimorphism. We tested for {{the presence}} of two factors that could contribute to the evolution of male ornaments in great frigatebirds: a high frequency of extrapair fertilizations and a male-biased opera-tional sex ratio. In 92 families sampled over two breeding seasons, there was only one extrapair fertilization. However, in both seasons, there were more males than females available for mating, and the sex ratio among individuals actively engaged in mate-acquisition behavior was strongly male biased, with typically five or six males available per female. Our results suggest that extrapair fertilizations are not responsible for the exaggeration of sexual ornaments in male frigatebirds, and that operational sex ratio may be related to sexual dimorphism in this species. Further work is needed to determine whether the male-biased operational sex ratio creates the variance in male reproductive success that would be needed to drive the evolution of mal...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the morphology {{of the skull}} of the Peruvian booby Sula variegata (Tschudi, 1845), considering its ontogeny, and compared with other species of the family Sulidae and, similarly, with other families of the traditional order Pelecaniformes: Phalacrocoracidae, Anhingidae, <b>Fregatidae,</b> Phaetonthidae and Pelecanidae. In the comparisons could be found characteristics which the Peruvian booby shares {{with other members of}} Sulidae, and others that, taken together, distinguish it from other species of the genus Sula. Among the former are: (1) during ontogenetic development, they change the proportions between the rostrum and thebraincase, stretching the first and reducing the height of the second. (2) The skulls have a nasal opening in their early stages of development, which is completely closed with the growth of the bird. The respiratory function moves to a space that is below the pre-orbital fenestra and the jugal, which is protected by ranfoteca. (3) Adult individuals present a trabecular space in the inner part of the upper jaw and frontals that confers resistance to the skull. All these features allow the Sulidae to prevent the rupture or buckling of the skull under the force {{of the impact of the}} plunge. In the second case there are: (1) cranial roof slightly vaulted over the orbits; (2) Sagittal crest generally narrow, although wide in some individuals; (3) Short temporal region; (4) Straight proximal rostrum in front of the naso-frontal suture...|$|E
40|$|Haemosporidian parasites {{are widely}} {{distributed}} and common parasites of birds, {{and the application}} of molecular techniques has revealed remarkable diversity among their lineages. Four haemosporidian genera infect avian hosts (Plasmodium, Haemoproteus, Leucocytozoon and Fallisia), and Haemoproteus is split into two sub-genera based on morphological evidence and phylogenetic support for two divergent sister clades. One clade (Haemoproteus (Parahaemoproteus)) contains parasites developing in birds belonging to several different orders, except pigeons and doves (Columbiformes), while the other (Haemoproteus (Haemoproteus)) has previously been shown to only infect dove hosts. Here we provide molecular and morphological identification of Haemoproteus parasites from several seabird species that are closely related to those found in dove hosts. We also document a deeply divergent clade with two haemosporidian lineages recovered primarily from frigatebirds (<b>Fregatidae,</b> Pelecaniformes) that is sister to the hippoboscid-(Hippoboscidae) transmitted dove parasites. One of the lineages in this new clade of parasites belongs to Haemoproteus iwa and is distributed in two species of frigatebird (Fregata) hosts from Hawaii, the Galapagos Islands, the eastern Pacific and throughout the Caribbean Basin. Haemosporidian parasites are often considered rare in seabirds {{due in part to the}} lack or low activity of some dipteran vectors (e. g., mosquitos, biting midges) in marine and coastal environments; however, we show that H. iwa is prevalent and is very likely vectored among frigatebirds by hippoboscid flies which are abundant on frigatebirds and other seabirds. This study supports the existence of two sister clades of avian Haemoproteus in accord with the subgeneric classification of avian hemoproteids. Description of H. iwa from Galapagos Fregata minor is given based on morphology of blood stages and segments of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene, which can be used for identification. This study shows that hippoboscid flies warrant more attention as vectors of avian Haemoproteus spp., particularly in marine and coastal environments...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT In this paper, we {{describe}} the skulls of Magnificent Frigatebird Fregata magnificens (<b>Fregatidae)</b> and Brown Booby (Sulidae) Sula leucogaster, with focus on the structures associated with the Musculi mandibulae. We discuss the results {{in the context of}} the feeding biology of the two species, which feed mainly on flying fish and squids. Frigatebirds capture prey from just above, or just below, the water surface in flight. The hook-shaped Apex maxillae in F. magnificens can be viewed as an adaptation for grasping prey from near the water surface. Boobies catch prey by plunging; thus, the dorsoventrally flattened skull and conical bill of S. leucogaster may reduce water resistance when it dives, or swims underwater. The bill is long in both species, such that it is on average 70 % of the whole skull length in F. magnificens and 60 % in S. leucogaster. Consequently, the Mm. mandibulae in the two species are more posteriorly positioned relative to the Apex rostri. This results in low mechanical advantage for the mandible opening-closing lever, indicating adaptations for a fast, rather than a strong, bite. Fast-moving mandibles would be advantageous for ‘mandibulating’ prey while swallowing. The Fossa musculorum temporalium and the Palatum osseum in both species provide a broad area for origins of the Musculus adductor mandibulae externus (all parts) and the Musculus pterygoideus. The Processus orbitalis quadrati is longer and thicker in F. magnificens than in S. leucogaster, and so is the Musculus pseudotemporalis profundus. We suggest that Mm. adductores mandibulae are relatively well developed in the two species; therefore, their mandibulae are still probably capable of a powerful adduction. In both species there is a mechanisms that contribute to protect the jaws from disarticulation and damage. Such mechanism involves the incorporation of a ‘flange-like’ Crista intercotylare on the Margo medialis cotylae medialis fossae articularis quadratica that grips the Condylus medialis quadrati. In S. leucogaster, the retractor-stop ‘notch’ formed by Ossa lacrimale et nasale also serves to protect the jaws against sudden external forces when birds are diving or swimming underwater for prey. A more detailed hypothesis for the jaw movements and strength in F. magnificens and in S. leucogaster and their relation with feeding habits should necessarily incorporate data on the jaw and anterior neck musculatures...|$|E
