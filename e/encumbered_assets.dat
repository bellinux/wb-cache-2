In estimating the free residue in an estate, the surplus in value of immovable property over the amount of mortgage bonds thereon may be included in such estimate.|$|E
40|$|Debtor-in-possession (DIP) {{financing}} is new financing {{that arises}} through lending to bankrupt firms. Many scholars {{have discussed the}} theoretical implications of DIP financing {{in terms of its}} contribution to the value of the companies. Recently, Dhillon et al. (1996) and Chatterjee et al. (1998) analysed the effect of DIP financing in the stock and bond markets and found a positive impact. In this paper I use a different approach to analyse the role of DIP financing in the bankruptcy process. I examine the plans of reorganisation of a large sample of 135 Chapter 11 s with DIP financing and 191 Chapter 11 s without DIP financing that went bankrupt in the United States over the period 1986 - 1997. I find that successful reorganisations benefited from DIP financing. This positive impact is, however, reduced in two circumstances: when the new loans are secured by a lien on already <b>encumbered</b> <b>assets</b> with equal or senior priority to the existing liens; when the new lenders obtain an increase in the seniority of their pre-petition debt. Also, a fast Court approval of DIP financing decreases the probability of success. The concession of DIP financing does not seem to significantly affect investment incentives, recovery rates and deviations from absolute priority. However, the size of DIP financing impacts on recovery rates. I also find that claimants of firms that were acquired in bankruptcy exhibit lower recovery rates, due to the potentially strong bargaining position of the acquirer.

40|$|The US Bankruptcy Code’s chapter 11 {{procedure}} is both {{in practice and}} conceptually the most important insolvency procedure worldwide. Many countries, including the Netherlands, look at Chapter 11 for inspiration in revising their own insolvency laws. Chapter 11 is, however, itself up for revision. On December 4, 2014, the American Bankruptcy Institute (ABI) issued breaking news for the restructuring and insolvency community in the USA when it presented its Final Report and Recommendations on the Reform of Chapter 11. This article discusses the most principled recommendations that will also be of the most relevance for legislatures and policy makers drawing inspiration from Chapter 11. First of all, the recommendation is discussed for introducing {{the figure of a}} so-called ‘estate neutral’ as a supplement to the debtor in possession model. Secondly, the introduction of significant restrictions on 363 sales; selling all or nearly of the assets. Restrictions deal both with timing and creditor involvement. As a third recommendation, we single out the introduction of a so-called ‘redemption option’. This option seeks to restore in part the balance between secured and unsecured creditors by giving ‘the immediate out of the money creditors’ a claim on <b>encumbered</b> <b>assets</b> equal to a redemption option. Finally, most novel and most interesting from a company law perspective, is the introduction of an Equity Retention Plan for Small and Medium sized Enterprises (SME’s). The plan seeks {{to strike a balance between}} protecting the statutory order of distributions which would normally prevent a distribution to shareholders on the one hand and providing an incentive to shareholders necessary for the successful reorganisation of the company to remain involved on the other. This recommendation thereby provides an exception to the Absolute Priority rule, which usually has as the effect of wiping shareholders out in case of insolvency...|$|E

We offer a model in which a bank issues covered bonds backed by a pool of assets that is bankruptcy remote and replenished following losses. <b>Encumbering</b> <b>assets</b> allows a bank to raise cheap secured debt and expand profitable investment, but it also concentrates risk on unsecured debt and thus exacerbates fragility and raises unsecured funding costs. Deposit insurance or wholesale funding guarantees induce excessive encumbrance and fragility. To mitigate such risk shifting, we study prudential regulatory tools, including limits on encumbrance, minimum capital requirements and surcharges for encumbrance...|$|R

Banks issue covered bonds by <b>encumbering</b> <b>assets</b> on their balance sheet and placing them within a dynamic ring fence. As more <b>assets</b> are <b>encumbered,</b> jittery unsecured creditors may run, {{leading to a}} banking crisis. We provide conditions for such a crisis to occur. We examine how different over-the-counter market network structures influence the liquidity of secured funding markets and crisis dynamics.

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{relationship}} between asset encumbrance and bank funding {{in the context of}} covered bonds a form of collateralized debt. Covered bond issuance influences the incidence of bank runs by unsecured creditors and, in turn, conditions in the unsecured funding market influence the bank s choice of asset encumbrance. The more reliant is the bank on secured finance and the more it <b>encumbers</b> <b>assets</b> on its balance sheet, the more concentrated are losses on unsecured creditors and the more fragile the bank. But as more stable long-term debt is added to the funding mix, the greater is the expected value of bank equity. We solve for the optimal choice of asset encumbrance and wholesale funding. Our model sheds light on how losses of confidence in funding markets, macroeconomic shocks, and improved crisis resolution frameworks affect the extent of balance sheet collateralization...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the extent of {{security}} interests in property. A security interest is a right of a creditor to resort to an asset with priority to at least some other creditors of the grantor of security when debt or defaults on the secured obligation. This works examines to what extent the secured creditor’s right is, or ought to be, affected when the <b>encumbered</b> <b>asset</b> undergoes changes that result in a new derived asset. Three scenarios are looked at: where new assets (“fruits”) are derived from the original collateral; where the original collateral is substituted for another asset or where it is incorporated or mixed with other assets into a new product. The question has attracted little judicial or academic attention. In the key case Buhr v Barclays Bank Plc [2001] EWCA 1223 it was held that that the secured creditor had a right to sale proceeds of collateral by virtue of its property right. This was termed as a “principle of substitutions” encompassing accretions, fruits and proceeds of the original collateral. It is suggested that this “principle” does not exist in current English law. This is so whether the security is fixed or floating. If a security interest is to extend to derived assets, parties ought to bargain for it. If new assets are a result of dispositions unauthorised by the secured creditor the creditor may claim the proceeds by asserting a new right based on unjust enrichment, not by virtue of the original property right. English law contrasts with Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code in the US, where the secured creditor automatically acquires right to proceeds. Law and economics analysis suggests that extending security to proceeds promotes efficiency of secured credit but only if proceeds are understood narrowly and do not include fruits...|$|R
40|$|For years, {{scholars}} {{have questioned the}} efficiency of secured debt, many suggesting that it transfers uncompensated risk to unsecured creditors. However, prior writing {{on the value of}} secured debt ignores the distinction between the use and the availability of secured credit. As a result, previous models of secured debt erroneously assume that a debtor that can borrow on an unsecured basis will nevertheless borrow on a secured basis to reduce interest cost. This Article combines theory, experience, and empirical tests to show that earlier models do not reflect the expected behavior of an economically rational debtor. These models fail to recognize that the most important form of secured debt, money credit secured by collateral, tends to create value for unsecured creditors {{as well as for the}} debtor. A debtor that can borrow unsecured has an economic incentive not to prematurely <b>encumber</b> its <b>assets</b> because doing so gives away value in an amount [...] which the Article calls Theta [...] that exceeds any interest cost saving. Perhaps the most significant component of this value is the increased liquidity that secured credit affords. The Article also shows that this increased liquidity does not generally keep alive debtors that should be allowed to fail, because lenders will be reluctant to extend credit, even on a secured basis, to debtors that are likely to go bankrupt. Furthermore, troubled debtors will themselves be reluctant to incur secured debt unless they can thereby avoid bankruptcy. Secured credit is therefore usually extended in these circumstances only where the liquidity would help the debtor regain viability. Accordingly, unsecured creditors themselves should want debtors to have access secured credit...|$|R
40|$|The {{doctoral}} thesis concerns the debt and liability of the legatee. The theme {{of interest is}} the succesional law. In Italian civil law succession may be legal or testamentary. The testator may establish an heir, which became sole heir or legatee. The general rule is that only the heir is liable for debts of the deceased; the legatee does not. The legate is responsible, if the testator has him imposed the payment of a debt. But the legatee responds {{within the limits of}} what was received (intra vires liability). Equally, if the good received is encumbered by mortgages and the legatee suffers enforcement. In any case, as a general rule, the creditor must apply to the heir, not to legatee (which has not any passive legitimation for the debts of the deceased). However, there are cases where the legatee should return the good received, when the heritage is insufficient to satisfy hereditary creditors (for example, separation of assets, acceptance with the benefit of inventory). Thus hereditary creditors may proceed by way of recourse against the legatee, although he didn’t have a debt. You must then remeditate the general principle that a legatee is not responsible for any hereditary debt, because there are cases of liability without debt. In this regard can be very useful dating german theory of “liability without debt”. Today this theory is, at least in Italy, entirely in the minority. However the distinction of the two elements of the obligation (debt and liability) is useful to describe and justify the fortunes of the obligations and the final allocation of "duty". With regard to the legatee, his position in relation to the debts or weights of the heritage can be varied, because the landscape of possible obligations that the legatee may, exceptionally, suffer is heterogeneous. The hypothesis of "liability" of the legatee is divided into four areas: 1) 	obligations of the legatee (modus, sub-legacy, testamentary autonomy of imposition debts, charges on things uncumbered) : distinguishing between obligations of the legatee and succession of the legatee in debts, these weights are settled by the succession rules. In case of modus and sub-legacy the legatee does not pay any debt of the testator, or a debt (in technical sense) of the heritage. Finally in the case of art. 668 cod. civ. They are not debts or charges of the heritage, but weights of loads imposed on the object of good lefted. 2) 	distinction between be liable and suffer weights (reduction action, lifetime allowance in favour of unrecognizable natural son, separation of assets of the deceased, lying inheritance, acceptance with the benefit of inventory). In the case of separation of assets and b. i., then, the legatee has not any debt, but his position is comparable to that of a purchaser of an <b>asset</b> <b>encumbered</b> by a real mortgage. 3) 	Patrimonial warranty of legatee (mortgage action and discovery of testament). We keep the conceptual autonomy of these cases from mortgage, because the mortgage action is comparable to real constraint that is realized with separation of assets, but it is different, because the mortgage is a specific constraint causally linked to a particular credit. With the mortgage liability in near to an abstraction, but causally tied to that particular credit. The ancillary characteristic of mortgage draws attention to the configurability of a case of responsibility without debt. Even if {{you do not want to}} agree to that theory (today a minority, though not entirely abandoned), the legatee suffer a warranty, different and more specific than that seen in the second macro-area. With the action of recourse in the case of b. i., the legatee does not suffer any debt of the testator, but a weight equal to its legacy. 4) 	debt and liability determinate by other rules (legacy of firma, company, usufruct, succession in the condominium, in the lease and in cooperative societies). In these cases the source of debt and responsibility doesn’t lie in any succession rules, but in the rules of the statement in which the legatee takes over. Therefore, the position of the legatee can be varied and complex. However, with regard to the specific aspect of succession in hereditary debts general principles are effective and good. All thing considered, the summa divisio lies on the distinction between succession and other rules. ...|$|R
