40|$|OBJECTIVE: Fluoride {{was first}} {{added to the}} Australian water supply in 1953, and by 2003, 69 % of Australia's {{population}} was receiving the minimum recommended dose. Extending coverage of fluoridation to all remaining communities of at least 1000 people is a key strategy of Australia's National Oral Health Plan 2004 - 2013. We evaluate the cost-effectiveness of this strategy from an Australian health sector perspective. METHODS: Health gains from the prevention of caries in the Australian population are modelled over the average 15 -year lifespan of a treatment plant. Taking capital and on-going operational costs of fluoridation into account, as well as costs of caries treatment, we <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollars</b> per disability-adjusted life years (DALY) averted from extending coverage of fluoridation to all large (≥ 1000 people) and small (< 1000 people) communities in Australia. RESULTS: Extending coverage of fluoridation to all communities of at least 1000 people will lead to improved population health (3700 DALYs, 95 % uncertainty interval: 2200 - 5700 DALYs), with a dominant cost-effectiveness ratio and 100 % probability of cost-savings. Extending coverage to smaller communities leads to 60 % more health gains, but is not cost-effective, with a median cost-effectiveness ratio of A$ 92 000 /DALY and only 10 % probability of being under a cost-effectiveness threshold of A$ 50 000 /DALY. CONCLUSIONS: Extension of fluoridation coverage under the National Oral Health Plan is highly recommended, but given the substantial dental health disparities and inequalities in access to dental care that currently exist for more regional and remote communities, there may be good justification for extending coverage to include all Australians, regardless of where they live, despite less favourable cost-effectiveness...|$|R

Methods The authors conducted a quantitative and analytical evaluation using informal interviews and financial data research and analysis. A functional analysis of the IHS organization identified administrative and management functions that are traceable to direct health care programs. Cost Center analysis interview data was collected pertaining to the budgeting process, accounting policies and procedures, and the financial reporting system. Cost centers were classified by expenditure type. After the classification process was completed for both functional areas and cost centers, adjustments were made to ensure completeness and to eliminate duplication. The data collected from the interview process was compared with financial data to define the distinction of the IHS' cost between overhead and direct health care. Results The study defined and estimated IHS Administrative and Management costs for fiscal year 1992. The study also proposed a refined Cost Center Design, aligning expenditures between overhead and direct health care operations. Conclusion The recommendations {{of this study are}} as follows: 1) private industry hospitals, health maintenance organizations, and Veterans Administration hospitals should not be used by the IHS as models for determining its administrative and management costs; 2) IHS should standardize its cost accounting procedures and ensure consistent implementation system-wide; 3) timely reviews of cost center expenditures should be performed to ensure accurate classification of costs between overhead and direct; 4) proposed refined cost center design should be implemented to adequately describe cost center functions; 5) Utilizing the refined cost center design, the IHS should perform a comprehensive and accurate study of the IHS overhead and direct care costs; and 6) IHS should develop <b>the</b> criteria to <b>determine</b> Solemn Obligations...|$|R

This research performed a literature review related to the determination of daily I/D dollar amounts. Caltrans I/D project data were then collected and evaluated.
