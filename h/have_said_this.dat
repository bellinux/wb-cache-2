500|$|Colt {{historian}} William Edwards {{wrote that}} Caroline Henshaw married Samuel Colt in Scotland when Colt {{met her in}} Europe and that the son she bore was Samuel Colt's and not John Colt's. In a 1953 biography about Samuel Colt based largely on family letters, Edwards wrote that John's marriage to Caroline {{was a way to}} legitimize her son, Sammy. [...] Samuel Colt had abandoned her because he felt she was not fit to be the wife of an industrialist and divorce was a social stigma at the time. [...] Samuel Colt took care of the child named Samuel Caldwell Colt financially with a large allowance and paid for his tuition in what was described as [...] "the finest private schools". [...] In correspondence with and about his namesake, Samuel Colt referred to him as his [...] "nephew" [...] in quotes. [...] Historians such as Edwards and Harold Schechter <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>this</b> was the elder Colt's way of letting the world know that the boy was his own son without directly saying so. After Samuel Colt's death in 1862, he left the boy $2 million by 2010 standards. [...] Colt's widow, Elizabeth Jarvis Colt, and her brother contested this. [...] In probate Caroline's son Sam produced a valid marriage license showing that Caroline and Samuel Colt were married in Scotland in 1838 and that this document made him a rightful heir to part of Colt's estate, if not to the Colt Manufacturing Company.|$|E

He taunts Rawls by saying that he made his move against him too soon (Rawls did undermine him in front of Carcetti in Corner Boys, although it is not clear how Burrell would know about it; he may have guessed from Carcetti putting Rawls in charge 'de facto' of the department in lieu of Burrell, or may <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>this</b> to test him.).

2500|$|In April 2006, {{civil rights}} activist Al Sharpton was invited on Fox's The O'Reilly Factor to discuss the case. Sharpton began the {{interview}} by commending the [...] "blacks and whites who stood vigil and to come together in that community {{to stand up for}} this girl." [...] In response to Bill O'Reilly's questions concerning the possibility that the woman might have fabricated the allegations, Sharpton said, [...] "First of all, the authorities have charged there was a crime. ... When the prosecutors went forward, they clearly <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>this</b> girl is the victim, so why would we be trying the victim?" [...] When O'Reilly mentioned recent news reports that DNA testing had failed to match any of the defendants, Sharpton said, [...] "I think that all of the facts that you have laid out the DA had — and I know this DA is probably not one that is crazy. He would not have proceeded if he did not feel that he could convict." [...] Sharpton continued that the case parallels [...] "Abner Louima, who was raped and sodomized in a bathroom." [...] At the conclusion of the interview, when O'Reilly said that Sharpton didn't know what happened, Sharpton agreed. [...] "I don't know yet and I think that the proper {{thing to do is to}} support those that want justice." ...|$|E
