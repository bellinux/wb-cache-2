5|$|When the Parliament of Norway {{decided on}} 8 October 1992 {{to build a}} new central airport for Eastern Norway, they also decided that the main mode of ground {{transport}} to the airport should be by railway. While the previous airport, Oslo Airport, Fornebu, was located just outside the city limits; the new Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, would be located some 50 kilometers north of the city, outside the reach of the existing public transport systems. The political agreement to build the airport stated that the costs of construction should not be borne by the tax payers. As a result, the entire airport was financed with money borrowed through Oslo Lufthavn AS, a subsidiary of the Norwegian Airport Administration. The same principle was chosen for the airport rail link. The Norwegian State Railways (NSB) created the subsidiary, NSB Gardermobanen AS, on 24 November 1992 to perform the construction of the line. This company would be able to charge train operators using the railway line; and could use this income to cover its <b>down</b> <b>payments</b> and interest on the debt created to pay for the infrastructure investment. It was planned to give a profit margin of 7.5%.|$|E

In 2005, the median <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> for {{first-time home buyers}} was 2%, with 43% of those buyers making no <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> whatsoever.

25|$|Peru faced a major housing {{deficit in}} 2001, with the {{majority}} of its urban population living in slums. Toledo’s administration sought to improve access to affordable housing through subsidies, loans, <b>down</b> <b>payments,</b> land titling, and encouraging financial institutions to reach further down-market. Most of these efforts were grouped under the Fondo Mivivienda, which was a program started in 1999.|$|E

25|$|Although timber barons orchestrate {{the illicit}} operations, {{including}} export, their operations are financed by international sources. This financing {{comes in the}} form of <b>down</b> <b>payments</b> of up to half the total sale from foreign buyers and loans from international banks that have branches in Antananarivo. The loans are critical, even in such a profitable industry, because without full payment, most of the capital gets tied up in the stockpiles of logs waiting to be exported.|$|E
50|$|A <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> {{refers to}} the cash paid to the lender for the home and {{represents}} the initial homeowners' equity or financial interest in the home. A low <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> means that a home represents a highly leveraged investment for the homeowner, with little equity relative to debt. In such circumstances, only small declines {{in the value of}} the home result in negative equity, a situation in which the value of the home is less than the mortgage amount owed. In 2005, the median <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> for first-time home buyers was 2%, with 43% of those buyers making no <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> whatsoever.

The 3.5% {{requirement}} can be satisfied with the borrower using their own cash or receiving a gift from a family member, their employer, labor union, or government entity. Since 1998, non-profit organizations have been providing <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> gifts to borrowers who purchase homes where the seller has agreed to reimburse the non-profit organization and pay an additional processing fee. In May 2006, the IRS determined that this is not [...] "charitable activity" [...] and has moved to revoke the non-profit status of organizations providing <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> assistance in this manner.

Many San Francisco gays also moved there in the years around 1970 from what was then the most prominent gay neighborhood, Polk Gulch, because large Victorian houses were available at low rents or available for purchase for low <b>down</b> <b>payments</b> when their former middle-class owners had fled to the suburbs.|$|E

As a result, Shaker Heights avoided many of the problems created from practices such as blockbusting and white flight. In 1986, the city began a Fund for the Future of Shaker Heights, offering loans for <b>down</b> <b>payments</b> for residents buying homes in segregated neighborhoods, creating multi-ethnic neighborhoods. Today, the city maintains a housing assistance office that works with home buyers to achieve and maintain neighborhood integration.|$|E
500|$|When {{mortgage}} lenders {{consider whether}} to underwrite a particular loan, {{they look to}} {{factors such as the}} creditworthiness of the borrower and the amount of <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> the borrower will be making. [...] The amount of the <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> required by the mortgage lender can be as high as 20% of the home's purchase price. [...] In the United States, the <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> requirement can be substantially reduced if repayment of the mortgage is guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration ("FHA"), an agency within the Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD"). [...] The required <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> under such FHA insured loans has varied over time; in the 1990s it was 3% of the home's purchase price.|$|R

Bill guaranteed low cost loans for veterans, with very low <b>down</b> <b>payments,</b> and low interest rates. With 16 million eligible veterans, the opportunity to buy a house was suddenly at hand. In 1947 alone, 540,000 veterans bought one; their average price was $7300. The construction industry kept prices low by standardization – for example standardizing sizes for kitchen cabinets, refrigerators and stoves, allowed for mass production of kitchen furnishings. Developers purchased empty land just outside the city, installed tract houses based on a handful of designs, and provided streets and utilities, or local public officials race to build schools. The most famous development was Levittown, in Long Island just east of New York City. It offered a new house for $1000 down, and $70 a month; it featured three bedrooms, fireplace, gas range and gas furnace, and a landscaped lot of 75 by 100 feet, all for a total price of $10,000. Veterans could get one with a much lower down payment.|$|E

500|$|One {{day after}} the Housing and Economic Recovery Act was signed into law, Representative Al Green of Texas {{introduced}} {{a bill that would}} have permitted the FHA to insure mortgage loans that had seller-funded <b>down</b> <b>payments,</b> so long as the home buyers had FICO credit scores that were above a specified minimum (but, in some cases, the buyers would have been assessed higher mortgage-insurance premiums by the FHA). [...] Nehemiah supported this legislation and established a web site—the now-defunct dpagroundswell.org—that sought to generate public support through various means, including a letter-writing campaign to members of Congress. [...] Although the bill succeeded in getting approval from the House Committee on Financial Services, it was never voted on by the entire House and, hence, did not become law. [...] With this legislative failure, the seller-funded down-payment industry, including Nehemiah, ceased operations as of October 1, 2008.

[...] In October 2007, HUD pronounced its proposed change as [...] "final", meaning that it now would be implemented, with an effective date of October 31, 2007. [...] However, Nehemiah sued HUD in a federal district court, citing violations of the Administrative Procedure Act.
