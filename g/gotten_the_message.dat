50|$|In {{regards to}} foreign policy, Hua {{made his first}} trip abroad in May 1978. This was {{a visit to the}} Democratic People's Republic of Korea, where he was given a warm {{reception}} and joined DPRK leader Kim Il-sung in calling for the United States to withdraw its troops from the Republic of Korea. In September, Deng Xiaoping also visited the North Korean capital Pyongyang. He was unimpressed with Kim Il-sung's extensive personality cult, having seen enough of this sort of thing in China with Mao and also took umbrage at being expected to lay a wreath in front of the giant gold-plated statue of Kim in Pyongyang. Deng reportedly expressed his displeasure at how the aid money given to North Korea by China over the years was being spent on statues and monuments honoring Kim. He suggested that they might be better served using that aid to improve their people's living standards. The North Koreans appeared to have <b>gotten</b> <b>the</b> <b>message,</b> for the gold plating was quietly scraped off the Kim statue in Pyongyang afterwards.|$|E

5000|$|Several {{subsequent}} {{music videos}} or albums have drawn influence from the video's intimate party setting.

[...] Scenes in Ciara's [...] "Body Party" [...] video were influenced by the video's [...] "laid-back" [...] setting as well as Jackson's [...] "Go Deep." [...] Ciara's performance at the 2013 BET Awards {{was thought to be}} inspired by Jackson's performance of the song at the MTV Video Music Awards. The opening setting of Ciara's [...] "Never Ever," [...] which featured Young Jeezy, was also observed to be similar.

40|$|Most {{people have}} <b>gotten</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> that lead can harm a child’s health and development, and that younger {{children}} are more at risk than older chil-dren and adults. However, as we watch blood lead levels in U. S. children declining, we begin to see a different picture of lead poisoning emerging in some California communities. Lead was effectively removed from residential paint in 1978, and the phase-out of lead in gasoline began in 1976. Blood lead levels for most children were 15 µ/dl in 1976 - 1980; this figure dropped to 2 µ/dl in 1999 - 2000. Many studies over time have shown that even very low levels of lead can contribute to problems with learning and behavior, {{such as the ability}} to pay attention. So while removing the main sources of childhood lead poisoning has been a public health success, we still have an esti-mated 300, 000 children living in homes with lead-based paint hazards.

40|$|Over 40 {{years ago}} I read a small grey book with metaphysics {{in the title}} which began with the words “Metaphysics is dead. Wittgenstein has killed it. ” I am one of many who agree but sadly {{the rest of the}} world has not <b>gotten</b> <b>the</b> <b>message.</b> Shoemaker’s work is {{nonsense}} on stilts but is unusual only in that it never deviates into sense from the first paragraph to the last. At least with Dennett, Carruthers, Churchland etc one gets a breath of fresh air when they discuss cognitive science (imagining they are still doing philosophy). As W showed so beautifully, the confusions that lead to metaphysics are universal and nearly inescapable aspects of our psychology. They occur not only in all thinking on behavior but throughout science as well. It’s easy to find examples in Hawking, Weinberg, Penrose, Green, who of course have no idea they have left science and entered metaphysics, that the statement they just made is not a matter of fact at all but a matter of conceptual (linguistic) confusion. “Law, event, space, time, force, matter, proof, connection, cause, follows, physical”, etc., all have clear uses in certain technical contexts, but these blend insensibly into quite different uses that have little in common but the spelling. Since it is pointless to waste time deconstructing Shoemaker line by line, showing the same errors over and over, I will describe some facts about how our psychology (language) works and with this outline and the references I give it is quite straightforward to give a meaningful description of the world in place of the metaphysical fantasies. If I were to debate Shoemaker we would never get beyond the title.

40|$|Abstract — Many ad hoc routing {{protocols}} {{are based on}} (some variant of) flooding. Despite various optimizations, many routing messages are propagated unnecessarily. We propose a gossiping-based approach, where each node forwards a message with some probability, to reduce the overhead of the {{routing protocols}}. Gossiping exhibits bimodal behavior in sufficiently large networks: in some executions, the gossip dies out quickly and hardly any node <b>gets</b> <b>the</b> message; in the remaining executions, a substantial fraction of <b>the</b> nodes <b>gets</b> <b>the</b> <b>message.</b> <b>The</b> fraction of executions in which most nodes <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> depends on <b>the</b> gossiping probability and the topology of the network. In the networks we have considered, using gossiping probability between 0. 6 and 0. 8 suffices to ensure that almost every node <b>gets</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> in almost every execution. For large networks, this simple gossiping protocol uses up to 35 % fewer messages than flooding, with improved performance. Gossiping can also be combined with various optimizations of flooding to yield further benefits. Simulations show that adding gossiping to AODV results in significant performance improvement, even in networks as small as 150 nodes. We expect that the improvement should be even more significant in larger networks. I...|$|R
