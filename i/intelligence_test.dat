5|$|At Springfield Elementary School, Bart is busted for {{vandalism}} by Principal Skinner, who {{has been}} informed by class genius Martin Prince. Faced {{with the prospect of}} failing an <b>intelligence</b> <b>test,</b> Bart surreptitiously switches exams with Martin. When the school psychologist, Dr. Pryor, studies the results, he identifies Bart as a genius, to the delight of Homer and Marge, who enroll him in a new school. However, Lisa is not fooled by his supposed genius and still believes Bart to be a moron; Skinner shares her belief, but takes advantage of Bart's departure from the school.|$|E
5|$|Five former Maryland {{players were}} {{selected}} in the 2009 NFL Draft, which tied North Carolina for {{the most of any}} Atlantic Coast Conference team. Wide receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey, who ran the fastest 40-yard dash time at the combine of 4.30seconds, was selected by the Oakland Raiders as the seventh overall pick, far higher than most analysts had anticipated. Cornerback Kevin Barnes, who had scored the highest grade on the <b>intelligence</b> <b>test</b> at the combine, was {{selected in the}} third round by the Washington Redskins. Linebacker Moise Fokou, guard Jaimie Thomas, and tight end Dan Gronkowski were all selected in the seventh round.|$|E

50|$|<b>Intelligence</b> <b>testing</b> plays a very {{important}} role in how school psychologist and special educators evaluate and assess children for placement in special education programs. Many Educational systems in the modern society use the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children to assess the intellectual functioning of children. However, just because <b>intelligence</b> <b>testing</b> is a huge phenomena in the education world, the creation of <b>intelligence</b> <b>testing</b> was not intended for educational use. Rather, the first <b>intelligence</b> <b>tests</b> where created during World War I to screen the thousands of soldiers being recruited by the United States Military.|$|R
5|$|The {{concept for}} the episode {{developed}} from writer Jon Vitti {{coming up with}} a long list of bad things Bart would do for attention imagining the potential consequences. The only idea that developed into an interesting episode concept was Bart cheating on an IQ test. This idea was based on an incident from Vitti's childhood when a number of his classmates did not take an <b>intelligence</b> <b>test</b> seriously and suffered poor academic treatment because of it. Because Bart was already obviously unintelligent, Vitti reversed the problem for his episode. Vitti used all his memories of elementary school behavior to produce a draft script of 71 pages, substantially above the required length of about 45 pages.|$|E
5|$|He {{attended}} Los Angeles City College from 1939 onward. Although Roddenberry {{ranked in}} the ninetieth percentile on an <b>intelligence</b> <b>test,</b> and in the 99th percentile on a reading test administered {{as part of his}} college entrance examination, he elected to major in the police science curriculum; as president of the school's Police Club, he communicated with police liaison Stanley Sheldon. During his second year, he developed an interest in aeronautical engineering and obtained a pilot's license through the United States Army Air Corps-sponsored Civilian Pilot Training Program. He graduated from Los Angeles City College with an Associate of Arts degree in police science on June 26, 1941, becoming the first member of his family to earn a college degree. After graduating, he traveled to March Air Base and signed up for the Army Air Corps; {{due to the lack of}} training spaces his entrance was delayed. For the remainder of the summer, he attended Peace Officer training at the University of California, Los Angeles as an Army cadet.|$|E

25|$|The current {{measure of}} Mayer and Salovey's model of EI, the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Test</b> (MSCEIT) {{is based on}} a series of emotion-based {{problem-solving}} items.

By testing a person's abilities on each of the four branches of emotional intelligence, it generates scores for each of the branches as well as a total score.|$|E
25|$|The Flynn {{effect is}} the {{substantial}} and long-sustained increase in both fluid and crystallized <b>intelligence</b> <b>test</b> scores measured {{in many parts}} of the world from roughly 1930 to the present day. When intelligence quotient (IQ) tests are initially standardized using a sample of test-takers, by convention the average of the test results is set to 100 and their standard deviation is set to 15 or 16 IQ points. When IQ tests are revised, they are again standardized using a new sample of test-takers, usually born more recently than the first. Again, the average result is set to 100. However, when the new test subjects take the older tests, in almost every case their average scores are significantly above 100.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, the scientific, {{cultural}} and political French context of the first <b>intelligence</b> <b>tests</b> has been the object of systematic historical research (Carson, 2007; Foschi & Cicciola, 2006). Sante De Sanctis (1862 - 1935) and Alfred Binet (1857 - 1911), in collaboration with Théodore Simon (1873 - 1960), introduced their <b>intelligence</b> <b>tests</b> to the scientific community of the time at the Fifth International Congress of Psychology held in Rome in 1905. De Sanctis and his collaborators compared the two tests and used them in the training schools and asylums for children. This paper explores how <b>intelligence</b> <b>testing</b> was introduced into the Italian and, more specifically, Roman context...|$|R

25|$|There {{are many}} self-report {{measures}} of EI, including the EQ-i, the Swinburne University Emotional <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Test</b> (SUEIT), and the Schutte EI model. None of these assess intelligence, abilities, or skills (as their authors often claim), but rather, they are limited measures of trait emotional intelligence. The {{most widely used}} and widely researched measure of self-report or self-schema (as it is currently referred to) emotional intelligence is the EQ-i 2.0. Originally known as the BarOn EQ-i, {{it was the first}} self-report measure of emotional intelligence available, the only measure predating Goleman's best-selling book. There are over 200 studies that have used the EQ-i or EQ-i 2.0. It has the best norms, reliability, and validity of any self-report instrument and was the first one reviewed in Buros Mental Measures Book. The EQ-i 2.0 is available in many different languages as it is used worldwide.|$|E
25|$|While the {{possibility}} that certain individuals may be born with musical deficits {{is not a new}} notion, the first documented case of congenital amusia was published relatively recently. The study was conducted with a female volunteer, referred to as Monica, who declared herself to be musically impaired in response to an advertisement in the newspaper. Monica had no psychiatric or neurological history, nor did she have any hearing loss. MRI scans showed no abnormalities. Monica also scored above average on a standard <b>intelligence</b> <b>test,</b> and her working memory was evaluated and found to be normal. However, Monica suffers from a lifelong inability to recognize or perceive music, which has persisted even after involvement with music through church choir and band during her childhood and teenage years. Monica even admits that she does not enjoy listening to music because, to her, it sounds like noise and evokes a stressful response.|$|E
25|$|Following the Army Alpha and Army Beta {{tests for}} {{soldiers}} in World War I, mental testing became {{popular in the}} US, where it was soon applied to school children. The federally created National <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Test</b> was administered to 7 million children in the 1920s, and in 1926 the College Entrance Examination Board created the Scholastic Aptitude Test to standardize college admissions. The results of intelligence tests were used to argue for segregated schools and economic functions—i.e. the preferential training of Black Americans for manual labor. These practices were criticized by black intellectuals such a Horace Mann Bond and Allison Davis. Eugenicists used mental testing to justify and organize compulsory sterilization of individuals classified as mentally retarded. In the United States, {{tens of thousands of}} men and women were sterilized. Setting a precedent which has never been overturned, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the constitutionality of this practice in the 1907 case Buck v. Bell.|$|E
2500|$|His {{first article}} on the topic was {{published}} in 1913 in the Journal of the American Medical Association, in which he demonstrated not only an interest in <b>intelligence</b> <b>testing</b> but also in its cultural sensitivity. In this article, Knox focuses on the differentiation between those with “mental aberration” or active insanity, versus those “mental defectives” classified as “morons and constitutional inferior types.” It was during this time that Alfred Binet was publishing his research on <b>intelligence</b> <b>testing.</b> In this JAMA article, Knox draws reference to Binet’s research {{and the development of}} <b>intelligence</b> <b>tests</b> during the time. He pointed out that although <b>intelligence</b> <b>tests</b> can differentiate the less intelligent, less well developed class of people, if administered to individuals from another culture or country, the individuals might be incorrectly classified as morons. He wrote, “if these peasants are questioned about conditions existing in the land from which they come, most of them will show average intelligence” ...|$|R
40|$|This {{article focuses}} on {{teachers}} in the discourses of early 20 th-century proponents of <b>intelligence</b> <b>testing</b> in America. Teachers were often a targeted enemy in the academic literature on <b>intelligence</b> <b>testing</b> – their methods belittled, their unreliability emphasised. Yet, in part because teachers were essential for <b>intelligence</b> <b>tests</b> to be given in schools, they were also often talked about in more ambiguous ways. In particular, this paper argues that psychologists’ ways of talking to, at, and about teachers presented their relationship as characterised by an originary indebtedness of teachers towards psychology. <b>Intelligence</b> <b>tests,</b> it was implied, were for teachers a gift, and psychologists’ help a favour, which teachers should repay by using the tests and showing rigour, obedience and gratefulness in doing so. Arguably, the debt was framed in such ways as to render impossible its ‘repayment’, and to make illegible the potential contributions and initiatives of teachers in the intelligence-testing movement...|$|R
