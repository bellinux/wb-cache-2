25|$|There {{are several}} {{possible}} explanations for the bat; one is that bats are simply quite common in the area. The second theory is that on 9 October 1238, when James <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> to enter the city, re-conquering it from the Moors, a bat landed {{on the top of}} his flag, and he interpreted it as a good sign. As he conquered the city, the bat was added to the arms.|$|E
25|$|My uncle Claude was my {{favorite}} uncle, he was also my godfather. He and I were really, really close. He used {{to take me to}} see cowboy movies all the time when I was a little boy because I loved cowboy movies. He got a cowboy name for me, which was Smokey Joe. So from the time I was three years old if people asked me what my name was I didn't tell them my name was William, I told them my name was Smokey Joe. That's what everyone called me until <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> 12 and then I dropped the Joe part. I've heard that story about him giving it to me because I'm a light skinned Black man but that's not true.|$|E

He later recalled: [...] "My grandfather decided when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> four [...] I {{was going to be}} a barrister, so I just always assumed I was. It turned out to be a wise decision." [...] Goldstone was educated at King Edward VII School in Johannesburg and subsequently undertook a six-year legal studies course at the University of the Witwatersrand, from which he graduated in 1962 with a BA LLB cum laude.|$|E

500|$|After Lennon became famous, she berated him for {{speaking}} in a Liverpudlian accent, but Lennon replied: [...] "That's showbusiness, {{they want me to}} speak more Liverpool". Despite the talk of Lennon being working class—as were Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr—he later refuted the idea by saying, [...] "I was a nice clean-cut suburban boy, and in the class system <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> a half an inch in a higher class than Paul, George and Ringo, who lived in subsidised government houses. We owned our own house, had our own garden. They didn't have anything like that".|$|E
500|$|Although it is {{not known}} exactly when Chopin first met Liszt after {{arriving}} in Paris, on 12 December 1831 he mentioned {{in a letter to his}} friend Woyciechowski that [...] "I have met Rossini, Cherubini, Baillot, etc.—also Kalkbrenner. You would not believe how curious <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> Herz, Liszt, Hiller, etc." [...] Liszt was in attendance at Chopin's Parisian debut on 26 February 1832 at the Salle Pleyel, which led him to remark: [...] "The most vigorous applause seemed not to suffice to our enthusiasm in the presence of this talented musician, who revealed a new phase of poetic sentiment combined with such happy innovation in the form of his art." ...|$|E

500|$|Synge {{joined the}} Dublin Naturalists' Field Club {{and read the}} works of Charles Darwin. He wrote: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> {{fourteen}} I obtained a book of Darwin's.... My studies showed me the force of what I read, [...] the more I put it from me the more it rushed back with new instances and power... Soon afterwards I turned my attention to works of Christian evidence, reading them at first with pleasure, soon with doubt, and at last in some cases with derision."

It finally arrived from Paris in December. Chopin wrote to Pleyel in January 1839: [...] "I am sending you my Preludes [...] I finished them on your little piano, which arrived {{in the best possible}} condition in spite of the sea, the bad weather and the Palma customs." [...] Chopin was also able to undertake work on his Ballade No. 2, Op. 38; two Polonaises, Op. 40; and the Scherzo No. 3, Op. 39.|$|E

500|$|Tracy {{spent the}} {{majority}} of the next two years at home with Hepburn, living what she described as a quiet life: reading, painting, and listening to music. On June 10, 1967, 17 days after completing what was his last film role in Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, Tracy awakened at 3:00am to make himself a cup of tea in his apartment in Beverly Hills, California. Hepburn described in her autobiography how she followed him to the kitchen: [...] "Just as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> to give [...] a push, there was a sound of a cup smashing to the floor—then clump—a loud clump." [...] She entered the room to find Tracy lying dead from a heart attack. He was 67. Hepburn recalled, [...] "He looked so happy to be done with living, which for all his accomplishments had been a frightful burden for him." [...] MGM publicist Howard Strickling told the media that Tracy had been alone when he died and was found by his housekeeper.|$|E
500|$|In London, Grainger's charm, {{good looks}} and talent (with some {{assistance}} from the local Australian community) ensured that he was quickly taken up as a pianist by wealthy patrons, and was soon performing in concerts in private homes. The Times critic recorded after one such appearance that Grainger's playing [...] "revealed rare intelligence {{and a good deal}} of artistic insight". [...] In 1902 he was presented by the socialite Lillith Lowrey to Queen Alexandra, who thereafter frequently attended [...] his London recitals. Lowrey, 20 years Grainger's senior, traded patronage and contacts for sexual favours – he termed the relationship a [...] "love-serve job". She was the first woman with whom he had sex; he later wrote of this initial encounter that he had experienced [...] "an overpowering landslide" [...] of feeling, and that [...] "I thought <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> to die. If I remember correctly, I only experienced fear of death. I don't think that any joy entered into it".|$|E
500|$|In March 1984, when NYU student Rick Rubin and promoter-manager Russell Simmons {{founded the}} then-independent Def Jam label, 16yearold St. Albans, Queens native James Todd Smith was {{creating}} demo tapes in his grandparents' home. His grandfather, a jazz saxophonist, purchased him $2,000 worth of stereo equipment, including two turntables, an audio mixer and an amplifier. Smith later discussed his childhood background and rapping, stating that [...] "By the time I got that equipment, I {{was already a}} rapper. In this neighborhood, the kids grow up in rap. It's like speaking Spanish if you grow up in an all-Spanish house. I got into it when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> 9, and since then all I wanted {{was to make a}} record and hear it on the radio." [...] By using the mixing table he had received from his grandfather, Smith produced and mixed his own demos and sent them to various record companies throughout New York City, including Simmons' and Rubin's own Def Jam Recordings.|$|E

500|$|Spielberg {{had already}} {{demonstrated}} {{his interest in}} World War II themes with the films 1941, Empire of the Sun, Schindler's List, and the Indiana Jones series. Spielberg later co-produced the World War II themed television miniseries Band of Brothers and its counterpart The Pacific with Tom Hanks. When asked about this by American Cinematographer, Spielberg said, [...] "I think that World War II {{is the most significant}} event of the last 100 years; the fate of the baby boomers and even Generation X was linked to the outcome. Beyond that, I've just always been interested in World War II. My earliest films, which I made when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> 14 years old, were combat pictures that were set both on the ground and in the air. For years now, I've been looking for the right World War II story to shoot, and when Robert Rodat wrote Saving Private Ryan, I found it." ...|$|E
500|$|As the voiture {{rolled through}} the dark streets that wintry night, the sad story of Oscar Wilde was in part {{repeated}} to me... Robert Ross knelt by the bedside, assisting me {{as best he could}} while I administered conditional baptism, and afterwards answering the responses while I gave Extreme Unction to the prostrate man and recited the prayers for the dying. As the man was in a semi-comatose condition, I did not venture to administer the Holy Viaticum; still I must add that he could be roused and was roused from this state in my presence. When roused, he gave signs of being inwardly conscious... Indeed I was fully satisfied that he understood me when told that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> to receive him into the Catholic Church and gave him the Last Sacraments... And when I repeated close to his ear the Holy Names, the Acts of Contrition, Faith, Hope and Charity, with acts of humble resignation to the Will of God, he tried all through to say the words after me.|$|E
500|$|In June 1972, {{the band}} reconvened in Los Angeles {{to begin work}} on their next album at the Record Plant. The {{recording}} process was plagued with problems, many {{as a result of}} substance abuse issues. While struggling to record the song [...] "Cornucopia" [...] after [...] "sitting {{in the middle of the}} room, just doing drugs", Ward was nearly fired from the band. [...] "I hated the song, there were some patterns that were just... horrible" [...] Ward said. [...] "I nailed it in the end, but the reaction I got was the cold shoulder from everybody. It was like 'Well, just go home, you're not being of any use right now.' I felt like I'd blown it, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> to get fired". The album was originally titled Snowblind after the song of the same name, which deals with cocaine abuse. The record company changed the title at the last minute to Black Sabbath Vol. 4, with Ward stating [...] "There was no Volume 1, 2 or 3, so it's a pretty stupid title really".|$|E

[...] The producers promised a tearful ending, and the cast admitted their crying was not faked when they filmed their scenes. LeBlanc revealed it had been too much for him {{and the rest of the}} cast; he said Kudrow started crying first, and when he looked at Aniston and Cox they also appeared emotional. Schwimmer, who LeBlanc thought was the [...] "consummate professional", was also upset, so LeBlanc [...] "just lost it." [...] Maggie Wheeler, who was Chandler's [...] "on and off" [...] girlfriend Janice, told People, [...] "the entire cast had to go back and have their makeup redone before starting," [...] and that Perry broke the tension by saying, [...] "Somebody is gonna get fired."

500|$|Wainwright {{attended}} McGill University in Montreal for a {{short time}} to study Classical music composition. With his mother's support, he began writing pop songs and learned how to play guitar. Wainwright started performing at the night club Sarajevo, and eventually recorded a demo tape with record producer Pierre Marchand, a family friend, who had worked with Kate and Anna and who later produced Wainwright's second studio album Poses. Songs were recorded at Marchand's studio in Morin-Heights, Quebec, and no edits were made to the simple live tunes. The tape impressed Wainwright's father, who passed the songs along to producer Van Dyke Parks, who in turn presented them to DreamWorks executive Lenny Waronker. Waronker had signed McGarrigle to Warner Bros. Records in the 1970s. Describing his initial reaction to Wainwright's music, Waronker stated: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> to listen to his tape, I remember clearly I was thinking, 'Gee, if he has the mom's musicality and smarts, and the dad's smarts and voice, that'd be nice.' Then I put it on and I said, 'Oh, my God, this is stunning. Wainwright acknowledged that having musicians as parents gave him a [...] "foot in the door", but attributed his success to hard work.|$|E
