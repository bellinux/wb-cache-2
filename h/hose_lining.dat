50|$|A {{collapse}} zone {{can easily}} limit the access of <b>hose</b> <b>lines.</b> <b>Hose</b> <b>lines</b> should operate outside the zone, on the sides. A secured (and unattended) deluge nozzle {{can also be}} put into operation, with caution. An aerial fire apparatus may be required. In this case, the collapse zone {{should be considered a}} three-dimensional arc, and aerial ladders may not operate in that arc.|$|R

50|$|Joachim Armerding (1935-2015) {{founded the}} company in 1962 as a one-man {{operation}} in Achim near Bremen. Under the company name Joachim Armerding Industriebedarf, he specialised at first in the bespoke assembly of <b>hose</b> <b>lines</b> and established himself in the growing market for hydraulic hoses.|$|R
5000|$|Engine - The engine {{company is}} the {{backbone}} of the fire suppression operation. Every BCFD engine is manufactured by Pierce, and has a 500-gallon water tank. Engine companies carry a basic assortment of <b>hose</b> <b>lines,</b> appliances and adapters, forced entry tools, basic and advanced life support medical equipment, five-gas air monitoring, and a hand-held thermal imager. Most first line engine companies have a 1250GPM single stage pump. Basic <b>hose</b> <b>line</b> compliment is 1,200' of 4" [...] 'Stortz' supply hose, 250' of 2.5" [...] attack line, 300' of 3" [...] setback/standpipe hose, 500' of 1.75" [...] attack line, and 20' of hard suction hose. Engine companies have a daily minimum staffing of four; one Pump Operator or Acting Pump Operator, one officer (Captain, Lieutenant, or Acting Lieutenant), and two firefighters. Occasionally, when extra staffing exists, certain engine companies may be assigned a third firefighter.|$|R
40|$|Two-part {{coupling}} system for <b>hose</b> <b>lines</b> combines both connection and filter in one fitting. Flared fittings make coupling {{less prone to}} leakage, and reduced number of components speeds operation. These features may make coupler useful with liquid-bulk carriers, where materials (e. g., milk, cooking oil, and liquid sugar) must be transferred quickly from vehicle to storage facility...|$|R
25|$|Despite {{efforts to}} confine and {{extinguish}} the fire, {{it continued to}} spread into the structure and ignited furniture in the showroom, growing more quickly than the few operating <b>hose</b> <b>lines</b> could control. Meanwhile, efforts to stretch and begin operating additional <b>hose</b> <b>lines</b> continued. At 7:41p.m. the showroom area of the store experienced a flashover while at least sixteen firefighters were working inside. The flashover contributed to the rapid deterioration of the structural integrity of the building, leading to a near-complete collapse of the roof minutes later. Many of the firefighters caught in the flashover were unable to escape and were trapped under the collapsed roof and shelving weakened by the fast-spreading fire. Several calls for help were made by trapped firefighters and efforts to rescue them were commenced. These efforts proved unsuccessful. By the time the fire was brought under control, nine Charleston firefighters had been killed.|$|R
5000|$|Fire hoses come in {{a variety}} of {{diameter}}s. Lightweight, single-jacket construction, , 1, and [...] inch diameter <b>hose</b> <b>lines</b> are commonly used in wildfire suppression applications. Heavy duty double, double-jacket, , , 2, , and on occasion 3 inch lines are used for structural applications. Supply lines, used to supply firefighting apparatus with water, are frequently found in , 4, , 5 and 6 inch diameters.|$|R
5000|$|Other tactics {{work within}} the rule to [...] "stage" [...] the next team, ready to relieve the inside team when their air {{supplies}} run low. When the third team arrives {{to serve as the}} RIT, the second team enters, follows the <b>hose</b> <b>line</b> to the first team and relieves them. This is naturally smoother with good radio communications between officers.|$|R

5|$|The {{area around}} the {{building}} was cleared of pedestrians and firefighting personnel because of falling glass and debris. The falling debris was dangerous for firefighters because they often had to cross the perimeter around the building to enter and leave the high-rise. <b>Hose</b> <b>lines</b> stretched into the building were damaged by falling debris and one firefighter was struck by debris and seriously injured while tending to the lines.|$|R

50|$|Prior to the tower's {{construction}} in 1885, firemen {{had to rely}} on the Rock River as a water source which resulted in a climax of fires unable to be put out due to the limited range of their <b>hose</b> <b>lines.</b> This led to the funding for the project of constructing the tower. the businessmen who funded the construction were C.H. Morse, W.H. Wheeler, J.B. Peet, E.C. Allen, C.B. Salmon, and C.H. Parker.|$|R
5000|$|According to the {{publication}} LA Weekly, [...] "Firefighters pull heavy lengths of hose, climb stairs while wielding giant power tools like chain saws, and lift 180-pound ~81.6-kilogram, 35-foot ~10.6-meters wooden ladders... Firefighters' physicians {{say that a}} human expected to pull the heaviest <b>hose</b> <b>lines</b> must weigh at least 143 pounds kilograms," [...] and some women go through extensive training, sometimes {{paid for by the}} hiring municipality, prior to beginning actual training in a firefighting academy.|$|R
5000|$|Passing a line at 1008, within 10 {{minutes of}} the explosions, Auk drew {{alongside}} Pelican. After seeing one <b>hose</b> <b>line</b> part, Auk passed another to aid Pelican in pumping out the rapidly rising water below decks. However, the rough seas repeatedly slammed the ships together, damaging <b>lines</b> and <b>hoses,</b> and forcing their replacement. At 1054, [...] passed a towline and began moving ahead with the crippled Pelican, in turn tethered to Auk, astern.|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} a third fire engine had arrived, and more streams were {{directed}} on the flames. The ladder was used by some of those at the nozzle {{of one of the}} <b>hose</b> <b>lines,</b> and by this means the fire in the wing of the main building was quickly extinguished. Nothing could be done towards saving {{what was left of the}} barn, so the firemen directed all their efforts towards keeping the conflagration from spreading.|$|R
25|$|The initial attack {{focused on}} {{extinguishing}} {{the fire in}} the loading dock area, with a secondary effort to search for and evacuate people inside, and prevent the fire from spreading to the showroom and warehouse. Crews entering the showroom reportedly initially encountered clear visibility with only very light puffs of smoke visible near the ceiling {{at the back of the}} showroom. Shortly thereafter, an exterior door was opened near where the fire was raging. Efforts to close the door failed, allowing the fire to enter the showroom. Firefighters were ordered to stretch two <b>hose</b> <b>lines</b> into the showroom to attack the spreading fire; however, the pre-connected <b>hose</b> <b>line</b> from one of the units was too short. This required some firefighters to again exit the building to add additional sections of hose, and left only one small handline to hold back the growing fire. At about this time, fire dispatchers advised the crews on-scene that they had received a 9-1-1 call from an employee who was trapped in the warehouse, which required some firefighters to direct their attention to the rescue. The trapped employee was eventually rescued by firefighters who breached an exterior wall to reach him.|$|R
40|$|Tools for {{designing}} aeration systems are improving as reservoir applications become more complex. TVA is currently using bubble plume models, CE-QUAL-W 2 reservoir water quality model, and specialized CE-QUAL-W 2 inputs to simulate injection of oxygen into reservoirs with porous <b>hose</b> <b>line</b> diffusers. Two-dimensional reservoir-wide {{effects of the}} oxygen injection are then evaluated to help size, locate, and develop operational plans for oxygen system installation. This paper will describe design tools and applications at reservoirs in the eastern United States...|$|R
40|$|Public Technology Inc. {{asked for}} NASA {{assistance}} to devise the original firefighter's radio. Good short-range radio communications are essential during a fire to coordinate <b>hose</b> <b>lines,</b> rescue victims, and otherwise increase efficiency. Useful firefighting tool is lower cost, more rugged short range two-way radio. Inductorless electronic circuit replaced inductances and coils in radio circuits with combination of transistors and other low-cost components. Substitution promises reduced circuit size and cost. Enhanced electrical performance made radio more durable and improved maintainability by incorporating modular construction...|$|R
50|$|The firefighters {{died after}} the fire, aided by strong winds, trapped {{them in the}} {{basement}} of the brownstone and prevented their colleagues from rescuing them. It has also been suggested that the 45-mile-per-hour winds which helped fuel the fire also triggered an explosion, which also trapped them in the basement. The precise reason the firefighters died after getting trapped remains unknown, but one proposed scenario involves the fire burning through their <b>hose</b> <b>line,</b> cutting off their ability to fight the fire around them.|$|R
50|$|Around 1890, unlined {{fire hoses}} made of {{circular}} woven linen yarns began to replace leather hoses. They were certainly much lighter. As the hose fibers, made of flax, became wet, they swelled up and tightened the weave, causing the hose to become watertight. Unlined hoses, {{because of their}} lack of durability, were rapidly replaced with rubber hoses in municipal fire service use. They continued {{to be used for}} use on interior <b>hose</b> <b>lines</b> and <b>hose</b> racks until the 1960s, and are still used in some areas for forestry applications.|$|R
5000|$|A Mattydale lay, {{also called}} [...] "cross-lay", [...] "speedlay", and [...] "transverse lay", {{is a method}} of storing hose on a fire engine. This method of storing hose is {{designed}} for rapid deployment of a <b>hose</b> <b>line</b> to attack a fire. In this manner, the hose is stored perpendicularly across the fire apparatus, usually above or adjacent to the pump panel, {{instead of the usual}} parallel storage in the rear. This allows the firefighter to pull the hose {{in the direction of the}} fire instead of having to make a turn.|$|R
2500|$|Structure fires may be attacked, generally, {{either by}} [...] "interior" [...] or [...] "exterior" [...] resources, or both. Interior crews, using the [...] "two in, two out" [...] rule, may advance <b>hose</b> <b>lines</b> inside the building, find {{the fire and}} cool it with water. Exterior crews may direct water into windows or other openings, or against other nearby fuels exposed to the initial fire. Hose streams {{directed}} into the interior through exterior wall aperturtes may conflict with and jeopardize interior fire attack crews. A proper command structure will plan and coordinate the various teams and equipment to safely execute each tactic.|$|R
50|$|Eider fell in {{with the}} group as it labored ahead, {{securing}} to Pelican's starboard side, Eider and Auk acting much in the fashion of waterwings, keeping their sister ship afloat between them. Difficulties soon arose, however, as the ships struggled toward the Orkneys. A head sea sprang up, tossing the minecraft about and straining moorings and <b>hose</b> <b>lines.</b> Pump lines were carried away and Pelican began to settle further by the bow. The pressure {{of the water in}} the flooded forward compartments in the damaged ship now buckled and distorted the forward fireroom bulkhead, the only barrier that could save Pelican from sinking.|$|R
50|$|The {{team also}} {{supports}} local fire departments {{and law enforcement}} agencies by providing scene security details, perimeter control, traffic management, operational help (controlling <b>hose</b> <b>lines,</b> changing air bottles, etc.), evidence searching, and other non-hazardous services. Members frequently ride with Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office deputies, Littleton Police Department officers, and Littleton Fire Rescue personnel to assist with their daily operations. The Arapahoe Rescue Patrol is the designated light-duty rescue agency for the City of Littleton. All funding is provided by private donors. The Arapahoe Rescue Patrol is a non-profit 501 (c) (3) corporation and does not charge for its services.|$|R

25|$|Some fire engines have a fixed deluge gun, {{also known}} as a master stream, which directs a heavy stream of water to {{wherever}} the operator points it. An additional feature of engines are their preconnected <b>hose</b> <b>lines,</b> commonly referred to as preconnects. The preconnects are attached to the engine's onboard water supply and allow firefighters to quickly mount an aggressive attack on the fire as soon as they arrive on scene. When the onboard water supply runs out, the engine is connected to more permanent sources such as fire hydrants or water tenders and can also use natural sources such as rivers or reservoirs by drafting water.|$|R
