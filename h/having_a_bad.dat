25|$|Fern was {{extremely}} successful in her lifetime as a columnist. She {{was said to}} fit her material and subject matter to the audience. Many readers of weekly literary papers were women, and Fern addressed them in a conversational style, often using interjections and exclamation points, while tackling topics that concerned the daily life of ordinary women. Her readers were wives and mothers who worried about their children, current fashions, difficult husbands, and aggravating relatives. Sometimes they felt oppressed, depressed, or stressed. Fern expressed their problems in plain language, addressing women's suffrage, the woman's right to her children in a divorce, unfaithful husbands, social customs that restricted women's freedom, and sometimes just <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> day.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} King's {{marriage}} to their cousin, Princess Anne-Marie of Denmark, the uninvited Prince Peter called {{a press conference}} in Athens and openly questioned the legality of the constitutional amendment. Above all, he attacked his cousin Paul's widow, the tremendously unpopular Queen Frederika, and accused her of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> influence on her son. King Constantine II and Queen Anne-Marie's first child, Princess Alexia, was born in 1965 and designated as the new heir presumptive, but Peter refused to recognise that either. Following the rupture between King Constantine and Prime Minister Georgios Papandreou the same year, the Prince openly criticised the King's conduct and suggested himself as an alternative to Constantine II. However, the abolishment of the monarchy and the proclamation of the Third Hellenic Republic in 1973 did not allow Peter to fulfill his dream of ascending the Greek throne.|$|E
25|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, Campbell denounced Nazi Germany and returned to Britain. He did duty as an Air Raid Precautions warden in London. During this period he met and befriended Dylan Thomas, a fellow alcoholic, with whom he once ate a vase of daffodils in celebration of St. David's Day. Although he was over draft age and in bad physical shape, as well as <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> hip, Campbell finally managed to get enlisted in the British Army. He was accepted by the Intelligence Corps because of his knowledge of languages and began training as a private with the Royal Welch Fusiliers on 1 April 1942. Having completed basic training, Campbell was transferred in July to the I.C. Depot near Winchester, where he was trained in motorcycles. In February 1943 he was promoted to sergeant, and in March he was posted to British East Africa. On 5 May, he arrived in Nairobi and was attached to the King's African Rifles, serving in a camp two miles outside the city. After having worked as a military censor he was transferred in June to the 12th Observation Unit of the commando force being trained for jungle warfare against the Japanese. However, any hope of seeing real action in the Far East was thwarted when Campbell during training in late July suffered a new injury to his damaged hip in a fall from a motorcycle. He was sent back to hospital in Nairobi, where the doctors examined an X-ray of his hips and declared him unfit for active duty.|$|E

500|$|Margaret Fuller was {{especially}} known in her {{time for her}} personality and, in particular, for being overly self-confident and <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> temper. This personality was {{the inspiration for the}} character Hester Prynne in Nathaniel Hawthorne's novel The Scarlet Letter, specifically her radical thinking about [...] "the whole race of womanhood". She may also be the basis for the character Zenobia in another of Hawthorne's works, The Blithedale Romance. Hawthorne and his then-fiancée Sophia had first met Fuller in October 1839.|$|E

500|$|Milan {{entered the}} match the fresher {{of the two}} teams, but Simon Barnes commented in his Times match preview that Arsenal's biggest asset was their [...] "sheer bloody mindedness." [...] The club's indiscipline was a major talking point before the game, as two players were sent off in defeat to Sheffield Wednesday the {{previous}} Saturday. Graham's future was also called in question, after claims that he received illegal payments from transfer deals (bungs), which he dismissed. In his pre-match news conference, the Arsenal manager spoke highly of European football and was eager to win another trophy for the club: [...] "We are <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> season by our standards and any win in any cup is worth something." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "Bad Day" [...] {{were said to}} have a {{universal}} appeal by Alan Connor of BBC News Magazine as they have an [...] "everyman breeziness" [...] because the song's subject can be any person going through a bad daytime. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic described it as: [...] "a loping, sunny tune that pretty much has the opposite sentiment of its title". Although About.com's Bill Lamb described its lyrics as having a [...] "reassuring, comforting" [...] tone, Powter said the song [...] "mak fun of self-absorbed and narcissistic people who bitch and gripe". He also affirmed: [...] "It's not literally about <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> day, it's more about not taking yourself too seriously and complaining about trivial things".|$|E

[...] Pulitzer Prize-winning architecture critic Kamin gave the bridge four stars (out of a possible four) in his review and admires [...] how [...] "computers have given Gehry unparalleled formal freedom" [...] to design [...] "the complexity of its geometry" [...] and multidimensional curvatures. The bridge provides views of both the Historic Michigan Boulevard District and Lake Michigan {{in a way that}} Kamin says makes it a belvedere. Kamin also recommends anyone <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> day to stroll across the bridge, adding, [...] "You won't get where you're going quickly, but you'll feel a whole lot better once you're done." ...|$|E

500|$|He next starred as {{the protagonist}} (Roshan Kalra) in the comedy-drama Chef, an {{official}} {{adaptation of the}} 2014 film of the same name, from the director Raja Krishna Menon. Khan was pleased to work with Menon and identified with the film due to its [...] "modern, slightly unorthodox take on relationships". He borrowed several real-life experiences for his character, and in preparation, trained at the JW Marriott Hotels in Mumbai. The film received generally positive reviews with several commentators believing that it was Khan's best performance to that point. Anupama Chopra wrote: [...] "Khan get his groove back... doesn’t play Roshan as a hero <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> day. He gives us a flawed, fumbling man {{who is trying to}} repair the broken chords of his life." [...] As with his last few releases, Rangoon and Chef earned little at the box office leading trade analysts to question his commercial appeal.|$|E

After failing to sign the player, Real Madrid's manager at the time, Bernd Schuster, accused Villa of having [...] "no ambition", whereupon Villa responded by saying, [...] "Footballing ambition is not about your mouth, it is about your feet. You can accuse me of lots of things – of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> day, of missing chances, of many things – but I have always had ambition and always will have. I think I have proved that on the pitch with Zaragoza, Sporting, UD Langreo, and the national team." [...] In October 2008, Kaká praised Villa: speaking to Canal+, he claimed that Villa is [...] "the best Spanish footballer" [...] adding that, [...] "The player with whom I would most like to play is David Villa of Valencia." [...] On 2 December 2008, Villa came seventh in the Ballon d'Or 2008 rankings and on 12 January 2009, he was announced as the joint ninth-best player of 2008 alongside international teammate Andrés Iniesta of Barcelona, according to the 2008 FIFA World Player of the Year awards.|$|E
500|$|The Kazon's {{design was}} {{formulated}} around {{the beginning of}} June 1994. The series' make-up supervisor Michael Westmore was heavily involved {{in the creation of}} the look for the Kazon. While describing the species' facial features, Westmore said he constructed a skin protrusion along the nose and front of the face to simulate [...] "a soft cockscomb, a rooster comb" [...] rather than [...] "the dinosaur bone-type of ridges". He said that there were very small visual differences between Kazon males and females, with the distinguishing characteristic being women having a more delicate physicality than the men. According to Westmore, the prosthetic make-up for the forehead was structured in a shape reminiscent of the Devil, while the ridges on the nose were inspired by a vulture's neck. The nose designs were modified throughout the first two seasons with the addition of a nose tip and spikes protruding from the nostrils. The Kazon's design was the subject of fan criticism following the series premiere, with one fan commenting: [...] "They look like they're all <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> hair day." [...] When Anthony De Longis first saw the headdress worn as a part of Culluh's costume, he joked that: [...] "Culluh must be the leader because he has the biggest head of hair." ...|$|E
