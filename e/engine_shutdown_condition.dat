40|$|The "Dynamic Altitude Simulation Prediction Program," DASSPP, is {{a program}} to predict the {{transient}} response of an engine, test cell, ejector system under <b>engine</b> <b>shutdown</b> <b>conditions.</b> These transients are important to know so that corrective modifications {{can be adapted to}} prevent any damage to the engine or test cell. The "Dynamic Altitude System Simulation Prediction Program," DASSPP, is a major rewrite of the existing program "RL- 1000 " written in BASIC. The RL- 1000 program was written to analyze the transients of the RL- 10 system only. The new program is written to run in Excell 97 and utilizes the Visual BASIC language in Excell. The program has many added features not included in the original "Rl- 1000 " program. The program utilizes the ejector models developed during the summer of 1997. The new program is very user friendly and utilizes a dialog box for data input...|$|R

40|$|The {{notion of}} {{sequential}} <b>engine</b> <b>shutdown</b> is introduced and {{its application to}} lunar descent is motivated. The concept calls for the utilization of multiple fixed thrust engines {{in place of a}} single continuously throttleable engine. Downrange position control is provided by properly timed <b>engine</b> <b>shutdowns.</b> The principle advantage offered is the potential cost savings that would result from the elimination of the development cost of a throttleable rocket engine. Past lunar landing efforts are reviewed and provide the foundation for a baseline vehicle definition. A descent from a lunar parking orbit is assumed. The powered descent is divided into two phases, and a sequential engine shutdown-based guidance scheme is developed for the earlier phase. The guidance scheme consists of a biased ignition point and an algorithm for calculating shutdown times combined with a linear tangent steering law to provide full terminal position control. The performance of the sequential <b>engine</b> <b>shutdown</b> guidance scheme is assessed against two alternative approaches. (cont.) A statistical picture of the performance of each guidance scheme is obtained via Monte Carlo trials of a lunar descent simulation that captures, to first order, the interaction between the descent propulsion system, the navigation filter, and the guidance function, allowing a direct comparison to be {{made on the basis of}} accuracy and fuel consumption. The impact of variations in the number of engines available in the sequential <b>engine</b> <b>shutdown</b> case is analyzed. While the performance observed with sequential <b>engine</b> <b>shutdown</b> does not match that observed with a throttleable engine, the results suggest that it is a viable solution to the lunar descent guidance problem. by Philip N.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the application of}} the Test Automation Framework (TAF) on the Mars Polar Lander (MPL) software. The premature shutdown of the descent engine on the MPL spacecraft {{is believed to be the}} most likely cause for the mission failure. It is believed that the <b>engine</b> <b>shutdown</b> occurred when the three landing legs were extended into their deployed position. This event created an unanticipated transient touchdown indication from the legs, causing the software to inadvertently <b>shutdown</b> the descent <b>engines</b> prior to reaching the surface of Mars. This spurious indication should have been ignored by the Touchdown Monitor (TDM) software, but due to a design flaw, was actually “latched, ” thus causing the premature <b>engine</b> <b>shutdown.</b> The TAF approach was used to model the TDM software requirements. The associated TAF tools generated tests that identified a potential TDM fault. 1...|$|R

40|$|Researchers at the NASA Glenn Research Center have {{enhanced}} a general-purpose {{finite element}} code, NASTRAN, for engine-airframe structural simulations during steady-state and transient operating conditions. For steady-state simulations, the code can predict critical operating speeds, natural modes of vibration, and forced response (e. g., cabin noise and component fatigue). The code {{can be used}} to perform static analysis to predict engine-airframe response and component stresses due to maneuver loads. For transient response, the simulation code {{can be used to}} predict response due to bladeoff events and subsequent <b>engine</b> <b>shutdown</b> and windmilling <b>conditions.</b> In addition, the code {{can be used as a}} pretest analysis tool to predict the results of the bladeout test required for FAA certification of new and derivative aircraft engines. Before the present analysis code was developed, all the major aircraft engine and airframe manufacturers in the United States and overseas were performing similar types of analyses to ensure the structural integrity of engine-airframe systems. Although there were many similarities among the analysis procedures, each manufacturer was developing and maintaining its own structural analysis capabilities independently. This situation led to high software development and maintenance costs, complications with manufacturers exchanging models and results, and limitations in predicting the structural response to the desired degree of accuracy. An industry-NASA team was formed to overcome these problems by developing a common analysis tool that would satisfy all the structural analysis needs of the industry and that would be available and supported by a commercial software vendor so that the team members would be relieved of maintenance and development responsibilities. Input from all the team members was used to ensure that everyone's requirements were satisfied and that the best technology was incorporated into the code. Furthermore, because the code would be distributed by a commercial software vendor, it would be more readily available to engine and airframe manufacturers, as well as to nonaircraft companies that did not previously have access to this capability...|$|R
