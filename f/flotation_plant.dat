25|$|When the Basinghall Mining Syndicate {{took over}} the mine in 1936 all the old {{equipment}} in the mill was removed and a completely new electrically-powered plant was designed for high production rates. The entire output of the mine was crushed in a ball mill {{to the size of}} fine sand before being passed into a bank of froth flotation cells. In these, organic oils and acids caused the galena particles to become attached to rising air bubbles to form a grey foam which overflowed a weir at the top. These gave a good separation: concentrates averaged 75% galena and the waste tailings only 0.2% galena. The concentrate was dried, conveyed to ore-bins and then hand-loaded onto lorries for carriage to smelting mills at Ryton near Newcastle upon Tyne. However the ball mill was unable to cope with the high volumes of ore in the early 1940s. New concentrating tables were introduced. By the 1950s these processed 60% of the ore and produced concentrates of 82% galena. The remaining 40% of ore went to the ball mill and froth <b>flotation</b> <b>plant.</b>|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} addresses {{two important}} issues confronting coal <b>flotation</b> <b>plants</b> in Australia, {{the use of}} saline water and the processing of clayey coal. Two coal samples obtained from BHP Billiton Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA) and Xstrata were tested to represent coarse coal flotation and fine coal flotation, respectively.

It was found that saline water had a more pronounced effect on fine coal flotation than coarse coal flotation despite similar mineral compositions and clay mineral types present.

40|$|Two linear models, {{the second}} being {{a subset of}} the first, are {{proposed}} for the simulation of <b>flotation</b> <b>plants</b> by use of linear programming. The first linear model produces the circuit structure, as well as the optimal flow rates of the valuable element between any number of flotation banks incorporating any number of recycle mills. An optimal grade for the valuable element in the concentrate is given by the second model. Operating conditions in the flotation banks and recycle mills are included as bounds in these models, permitting their possible application in expert systems. The simulated circuit structure, concentrate grade and recoveries closely resemble those of similar industrial <b>flotation</b> <b>plants.</b> The only data required by the simulation models are the feed rates of the species of an element, and their separation factors which are estimated from a multiparameter flotation model. © 1990.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify a practical solution to mitigating over-stable froth problems in fine coal flotation in saline water. The effect of coal particle size, water quality and chemical reagents which can be manipulated in <b>flotation</b> <b>plants,</b> on the froth stability and coal flotation performance was investigated. It was found that froth stability was dependent on the coal particle size, the proportion of process water mixed with de-ionised water and the dosage of the collector or frother. Mixing coarse coal particles with fine coal, diluting process water, and reducing collector or frother dosage all significantly decreased the froth stability. However, only the reduction of reagent usage was recommended as a sound strategy since it did not negatively impact the coal flotation performance while eliminating the over-stable froth problems...|$|R

Furthermore, the effluent was also treated with sodium hypochlorite oxidation to avoid pollution in case effluent happened to be discharged accidently. The results showed that flotation wastewater pollutants could be eliminated effectively and reuse of the effluent did not cause adverse effects, during the six-year application of this procedure. In addition, flotation reagent consumption was greatly reduced, since the effluent containing mostly foaming agents could be reused. Thus, this method proved to be environmentally friendly due to the decreased use of fresh water {{as well as being}} economically beneficial...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect of pulp {{temperature}} on sphalerite flotation with the aim to explain the large variation in flotation performance observed in various <b>flotation</b> <b>plants</b> in summer and winter months.

As sphalerite flotation depends {{on the amount of}} copper activation, the type and concentration of copper species in solution and adsorbed onto the sphalerite surface were measured as a function of pH and temperature. It was found that more copper hydroxide forms in alkaline pH and adsorbs/precipitates on the sphalerite surface with increasing copper concentration and temperature. The adsorption of copper hydroxide facilitates the formation of a hydrophobic species, polysulphide or elemental sulphur at the sphalerite surface, which promotes sphalerite flotation. ...|$|R
