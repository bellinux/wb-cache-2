500|$|The art of {{metallurgy}} {{during the}} Song dynasty built upon {{the efforts of}} earlier Chinese dynasties, while new methods were incorporated. The Chinese of the ancient Han dynasty (202 BCE–220 CE) {{figured out how to}} create steel by smelting together the carbon intermediary of wrought iron and cast iron by the 1st century BCE. However, there were two new Chinese innovations of the Song dynasty to create steel during the 11th century. This was the [...] "berganesque" [...] method that produced inferior, inhomogeneous steel, while the other was a precursor to the modern Bessemer process that utilized partial <b>decarbonization</b> via repeated forging under a cold blast.|$|E

2500|$|In May 2010 the Hartwell Paper was {{published}} by the London School of Economics {{in collaboration with the}} University of Oxford. This paper was written by 14 academics from various disciplines in the sciences and humanities, and also some policies thinkers, and they argued that the Kyoto Protocol crashed in late 2009 and [...] "has failed to produce any discernable real world reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases in fifteen years." [...] They argued that this failure opened an opportunity to set climate policy free from Kyoto and the paper advocates a controversial and piecemeal approach to <b>decarbonization</b> of the global economy. The Hartwell paper proposes, [...] "the organising principle of our effort should be the raising up of human dignity via three overarching objectives: ensuring energy access for all; ensuring that we develop in a manner that does not undermine the essential functioning of the Earth system; ensuring that our societies are adequately equipped to withstand the risks and dangers that come from all the vagaries of climate, whatever their cause may be".|$|E
2500|$|Fuel {{switching}} on the demand side refers to changing {{the type of}} fuel used to satisfy a need for an energy service. [...] To meet deep <b>decarbonization</b> goals, like the 80% reduction by 2050 goal being discussed in California and the European Union, many primary energy changes are needed. Energy efficiency alone may {{not be sufficient to}} meet these goals, switching fuels used on the demand side will help lower carbon emissions. Progressively coal, oil and eventually natural gas for space and water heating in buildings will need to be reduced. For an equivalent amount of heat, burning natural gas produces about 45 per cent less carbon dioxide than burning coal. [...] There are various ways in which this could happen, and different strategies will likely make sense in different locations. While the system efficiency of a gas furnace may be higher than the combination of natural gas power plant and electric heat, the combination of the same natural gas power plant and an electric heat pump has lower emissions per unit of heat delivered in all but the coldest climates. This is possible because of the very efficient coefficient of performance of heat pumps.|$|E
2500|$|The Chinese {{during the}} ancient Han Dynasty {{were also the}} first to apply {{hydraulic}} power (i.e. a waterwheel) in working the inflatable bellows of the blast furnace. This was recorded in the year 31 AD, an innovation of the engineer Du Shi, prefect of Nanyang. Although Du Shi {{was the first to}} apply water power to bellows in metallurgy, the first drawn and printed illustration of its operation with water power came in 1313, in the Yuan Dynasty era text called the Nong Shu. [...] In the 11th century, there is evidence of the production of steel in Song China using two techniques: a [...] "berganesque" [...] method that produced inferior, heterogeneous steel and a precursor to the modern Bessemer process that utilized partial <b>decarbonization</b> via repeated forging under a cold blast. By the 11th century, there was also a large amount of deforestation in China due to the iron industry's demands for charcoal. However, by this time the Chinese had figured out how to use bituminous coke to replace the use of charcoal, and with this switch in resources many acres of prime timberland in China were spared. This switch in resources from charcoal to coal was later used in Europe by the 17th century.|$|E
2500|$|During the Han Dynasty (202 BC–220 AD), the {{government}} established ironworking {{as a state}} monopoly (repealed during {{the latter half of}} the dynasty and returned to private entrepreneurship) and built a series of large blast furnaces in Henan province, each capable of producing several tons of iron per day. By this time, Chinese metallurgists had discovered how to fine molten pig iron, stirring it in the open air until it lost its carbon and could be hammered (wrought). (In modern Mandarin-Chinese, this process is now called chao, literally, stir frying.) By the 1st century BC, Chinese metallurgists had found that wrought iron and cast iron could be melted together to yield an alloy of intermediate carbon content, that is, steel. According to legend, the sword of Liu Bang, the first Han emperor, was made in this fashion. Some texts of the era mention [...] "harmonizing the hard and the soft" [...] in the context of ironworking; the phrase may refer to this process. The ancient city of Wan (Nanyang) from the Han period forward was a major center of the iron and steel industry. Along with their original methods of forging steel, the Chinese had also adopted the production methods of creating Wootz steel, an idea imported from India to China by the 5th century AD. During Han Dynasty, the Chinese [...] were also the first to apply hydraulic power (i.e. a waterwheel) in working the bellows of the blast furnace.

The change of fuel resources from charcoal to coal was pioneered in Roman Britain by the 2nd century AD, although it was also practiced in the Germanic Rhineland at the time.|$|E
