5|$|Near 4:00 PM, with {{fourteen}} batteries {{destroyed and}} an hour left until dark, Ivry <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> off the operation, assuming the optimal result had been achieved and that the Syrians would move more SAMs into place the next day. The operation was stopped shortly after 4:00 PM. Colonel Aviem Sella, {{a member of the}} operation staff, later said that Sharon severely criticized that decision.|$|E
5|$|It is {{revealed}} that after their kiss, Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) confirmed to Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) her {{intention to marry}} Roy Anderson (David Denman). However, {{a few days before}} the wedding, Pam got cold feet and <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> it off. She moved into her own apartment and began taking art classes. Pam's rejection sent Roy into a downward spiral, hitting rock bottom with a drunk driving arrest. When being interviewed by the camera crew, Roy makes a vow to win Pam back.|$|E
5|$|A 15-year-old elephant, Ellie May, had {{acquired}} an undeserved {{reputation for being}} dangerous, which made her extremely difficult to sell. Her food costs became difficult to justify, but Grayson refused to have her put down. Although he left the zoo in January 1978, Grayson returned frequently to care for Ellie May, the last animal left at the zoo. Eventually Rotterdam Zoo agreed to take her, and plans were made to transport the elephant to the Netherlands. Ellie May refused to budge however, and overnight developed pneumonia and heart failure. Grayson and veterinary surgeon, David Taylor, felt {{that she would not}} recover, and <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> in a marksman to euthanise her.|$|E

5|$|Chauvel gained another {{important}} {{success in the}} Battle of Rafa in January 1917. In many ways, the battle was similar to Magdhaba, but the Turkish position was stronger {{and the threat of}} its reinforcement was greater. Once again, the availability of water was a crucial feature of the battle. This time it was Chetwode who <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> off the battle, with Chauvel's concurrence, but once again the troops carried the day. The victories at Magdhaba and Rafah changed Murray's mind about awarding Chauvel a knighthood and in January 1917 Chauvel was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George. In July, he was mentioned in despatches for these operations.|$|E
5|$|Early work on {{this new}} {{category}} of nova was performed during the 1930s by Walter Baade and Fritz Zwicky at Mount Wilson Observatory. They identified SAndromedae, what they considered a typical supernova, as an explosive event that released radiation approximately equal to the Sun's total energy output for 107 years. They <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> this new class of cataclysmic variables super-novae, and postulated that the energy was generated by the gravitational collapse of ordinary stars into neutron stars. The name super-novae was first used in a 1931 lecture at Caltech by Zwicky, then used publicly in 1933 {{at a meeting of}} the American Physical Society. By 1938, the hyphen had been lost and the modern name was in use.|$|E
5|$|General Grant had Commander Henry Walke {{bring the}} Carondelet up the Cumberland River {{to create a}} {{diversion}} by opening fire on the fort. The Confederates responded with shots from their long-range guns and eventually hit the gunboat. Walke retreated several miles below the fort, but soon returned and continued shelling the water batteries. General McClernand, in the meantime, had been attempting to stretch his men toward the river but ran into difficulties with a Confederate battery of guns. McClernand ultimately decided {{that he did not}} have enough men to stretch all the way to the river, so Grant <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> on more troops. He sent orders to General Wallace, who had been left behind at Fort Henry, to bring his men to Fort Donelson.|$|E

5|$|Though the Queen Regent, Mary of Guise, made no {{move against}} Knox, his {{activities}} caused concern among the church authorities. The bishops of Scotland viewed him {{as a threat to}} their authority and summoned him to appear in Edinburgh on 15 May 1556. He was accompanied to the trial by so many influential persons that the bishops <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> the hearing off. Knox was now free to preach openly in Edinburgh. William Keith, the Earl Marischal, was impressed and urged Knox to write to the Queen Regent. Knox's unusually respectful letter urged her to support the Reformation and overthrow the church hierarchy. Queen Mary took the letter as a joke and ignored it.|$|E
5|$|A children's {{edition of}} the memoir was {{published}} in 2014 under the title I Am Malala: How One Girl Stood Up for Education and Changed the World. The audio book edition, narrated by Neela Vaswani, won the 2015 Grammy Award for Best Children's Album. In February 2014, she was nominated for the World Children's Prize in Sweden. Even though she was fighting for women's rights as well as children's rights, she did not describe herself as feminist when asked on Forbes Under 30 Summit in 2014. In 2015, however, Yousafzai told Emma Watson she <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> herself a feminist after hearing Watson's speech at the UN launching the HeForShe campaign. In May 2014, Yousafzai was granted an honorary doctorate by the University of King's College in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Later in 2014, she was announced as the co-recipient of the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize, along with Kailash Satyarthi, for her struggle against the suppression of {{children and young people}} and for the right of all children to education. Aged 17 at the time, she became the youngest-ever Nobel Prize laureate.|$|E
5|$|After Debonnaire's {{death in}} 1833, Hesketh-Fleetwood {{immersed}} himself in his development plans. Southport, a town he owned much of, was becoming a popular sea bathing resort, and Hesketh-Fleetwood organised {{the construction of a}} promenade. He was becoming concerned over delays {{on the part of the}} Railway and Port Company and decided to get on with building Fleetwood. He hired his old friend Decimus Burton, who had become a successful architect, and together they discussed what buildings would be required. Hesketh-Fleetwood wanted a church, docks, housing, a gas office, a school and a hotel. Burton agreed that a hotel would be important for passengers to spend the night before travelling on to Scotland. Because those passengers would be arriving from Euston railway station in London, Hesketh-Fleetwood <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> the hotel the North Euston Hotel. Burton's plans were ready by 1835.|$|E

5|$|In early 1917, the Imperial Mounted Division {{was formed}} from the 3rd and 4th Light Horse Brigades and two British mounted brigades. The {{division}} first saw service during the First Battle of Gaza, which occurred in southern Gaza on 26 March 1917. At around noon two mounted brigades of the Anzac Mounted Division attacked Gaza {{from the north}} and east. At 6.00 pm the Turkish position had become perilous with the ring closing tightly around Gaza. However, in a decision that dismayed most of their soldiers the British commanders <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> off the attack and retreat, delivering victory to the Turks. A second attempt was made to capture Gaza on 19 April by which time the Turkish defences were even more formidable and the task confronting the British even more difficult. This battle became known as the Second Battle of Gaza. The Anzac Mounted Division played only a minor role in this battle suffering only 105 casualties out of the 5,917 suffered. The second battle of Gaza was a disastrous defeat for the Allied forces.|$|E
5|$|In the 2003–04 season, he was {{originally}} Detroit's backup goalie when Dominik Hašek {{came out of}} retirement, and Detroit management tried to trade Joseph, since the team also had a capable backup in Manny Legace. However, Joseph's $8 million USD per year contract made him hard to move. After {{a stint in the}} minors, he returned to the Red Wings lineup while Hašek was nursing a groin injury. The Red Wings plan was to attract him to other teams until Hašek returned to the lineup. But in February, Hašek <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> it quits for the season, which once again solidified Joseph's position as the Red Wings starting goaltender. The Wings finished first overall in the league. After defeating the Nashville Predators in the first round in six games, the Red Wings were defeated {{in the second round of}} the playoffs in six games by the eventual Western Conference champions, the Calgary Flames.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of Sunday 8 May to Monday 9 May 1977, about 100 people were staying in the Hotel Polen, {{including}} {{a large group of}} Swedish tourists. About 6:20am, the hotel staff were preparing for breakfast service, when one of them noticed smoke that seemed to be coming from the freight elevator (which had not been used since the café-restaurant on the ground floor had closed the previous evening). The night porter was alerted. Contrary to instructions, he did not call the fire department immediately; instead, he poured some buckets of water into the shaft, in an attempt to subdue the fire. By the time he <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> the fire department, the hotel was filling with smoke. The night porter was unable to reach the phone at the front desk because the fire had already reached it. The porter then ran outside, where he stopped the driver of a laundry truck serving the hotel, and instructed him to drive to the Hotel Krasnapolsky to warn them and to call the fire department.|$|E

5|$|The {{regiment}} started advancing {{towards the}} village, the 8th Squadron on the left, and the 10th with the 1st Squadron on the right. Covered by their machine-guns, but under heavy Turkish fire, they gradually moved forward on foot. Troops took turns to run forward {{while the rest}} of the squadron covered them. The intensity of the battle was demonstrated by the Inverness Battery Royal Horse Artillery, which was supporting the brigade and ran out of ammunition at 14:00. Two hours later the division's covering force reported Turkish reinforcements approaching, and Lieutenant-General Philip Chetwode, who was commanding the attack, <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> it off. Almost simultaneously Edward Chaytor, commanding the brigade, ordered another attack. Covered by their machine-guns the men carried out a bayonet charge and the Turks to their front surrendered. By this time the other brigades had started to withdraw, but seeing what had happened, they turned back and also charge, capturing the position. The battle cost the regiment six dead and nineteen wounded.|$|E
5|$|Charles met Frederick Kemp, a {{land agent}} newly arrived in Poulton {{from his native}} Essex, and {{introduced}} him to his brother, {{who was on the}} lookout for a steward or agent. Kemp, well-dressed and charming, made a good impression on Hesketh, who employed him immediately. At the meeting of the railway committee Hesketh put forward a persuasive argument. Despite opposition from the Lytham contingent the committee decided that Rossall Point was the best place for the railway terminus to be built, and the Railway and Port Company was formed. In the early 19th century it was thought that steam locomotives would be unable to negotiate hilly terrain, and that Lake District hills like Shap Fell would prevent the railway from reaching Scotland. The Fylde terminus would have even more importance than Hesketh had hoped, providing a sea link for passengers from London to travel on to Scotland. Initially Hesketh had considered naming his new town New Liverpool or Wyreton, but after changing his name to Hesketh-Fleetwood in 1831 he <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> it Fleetwood. With a new career in parliament to prepare for, he readily handed over financial management of the project to his manager, Frederick Kemp.|$|E
