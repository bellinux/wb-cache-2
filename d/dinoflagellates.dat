5|$|A {{number of}} <b>dinoflagellates</b> {{are known to}} have two nuclei. Unlike other multinucleated cells these nuclei contain two {{distinct}} lineages of DNA: one from the dinoflagellate and the other from a symbiotic diatom. The mitochondria and the plastids of the diatom somehow remain functional.|$|E
5|$|The K–Pg {{boundary}} {{represents one}} of the most dramatic turnovers in the fossil record for various calcareous nanoplankton that formed the calcium deposits that gave the Cretaceous its name. The turnover in this group is clearly marked at the species level. Statistical analysis of marine losses at this time suggests that the decrease in diversity was caused more by a sharp increase in extinctions, than by a decrease in speciation. The K–Pg boundary record of <b>dinoflagellates</b> is not so well understood, mainly because only microbial cysts provide a fossil record, and not all dinoflagellate species have cyst-forming stages, thereby, likely causing diversity to be underestimated. Recent studies indicate that there were no major shifts in <b>dinoflagellates</b> through the boundary layer.|$|E
5|$|However, in <b>dinoflagellates,</b> {{the nuclear}} {{envelope}} remains intact, the centrosomes {{are located in}} the cytoplasm, and the microtubules come in contact with chromosomes, whose centromeric regions are incorporated into the nuclear envelope (the so-called closed mitosis with extranuclear spindle). In many other protists (e.g., ciliates, sporozoans) and fungi, the centrosomes are intranuclear, and their nuclear envelope also does not disassemble during cell division.|$|E

5|$|The most {{frequently}} encountered bioluminescent organisms {{may be the}} <b>dinoflagellates</b> present in the surface layers of the sea, which {{are responsible for the}} sparkling phosphorescence sometimes seen at night in disturbed water. At least eighteen genera exhibit luminosity. A different effect is the thousands of square miles of the ocean which shine with the light produced by bioluminescent bacteria, known as mareel or the milky seas effect.|$|E
5|$|Both Aristotle and Pliny the Elder {{mentioned}} that damp wood sometimes gives off a glow and many centuries later Robert Boyle showed that oxygen {{was involved in}} the process, both in wood and in glow-worms. It was not until the late nineteenth century that bioluminescence was properly investigated. The phenomenon is widely distributed among animal groups, especially in marine environments where <b>dinoflagellates</b> cause phosphorescence in the surface layers of water. On land it occurs in fungi, bacteria and some groups of invertebrates, including insects.|$|E
5|$|<b>Dinoflagellates</b> may use {{bioluminescence}} for defence against predators. They shine {{when they}} detect a predator, possibly making the predator itself more vulnerable by attracting {{the attention of}} predators from higher trophic levels. Grazing copepods release any phytoplankton cells that flash, unharmed; if they were eaten they would make the copepods glow, attracting predators, so the phytoplankton's bioluminescence is defensive. The problem of shining stomach contents is solved (and the explanation corroborated) in predatory deep-sea fishes: their stomachs have a black lining {{able to keep the}} light from any bioluminescent fish prey which they have swallowed from attracting larger predators.|$|E

40|$|Small chorate <b>dinoflagellate</b> cysts {{are common}} in Upper Cretaceous to Quaternary {{sedimentary}} successions around the Antarctic margin. Taxonomic confusion surrounding <b>dinoflagellate</b> cysts and acritarchs of similar morphology throughout the southern high palaeolatitudes has hitherto limited investigation of their palaeoecological significance. This study aims to solve the taxonomic problems, and to allow a new assessment of <b>dinoflagellate</b> cyst acmes. A detailed morphological study of new material from the López de Bertodano Formation of Seymour Island, Antarctic Peninsula, is presented. These <b>dinoflagellate</b> cysts are identified as Impletosphaeridium clavusWrenn & Hart 1988 emend. nov. Their gross morphology and their vast abundances in the James Ross Basin are strongly suggestive of <b>dinoflagellate</b> blooms. This scenario implies similarities to modern <b>dinoflagellate</b> cysts from the polar regions. ...|$|R
50|$|Organic-walled <b>dinoflagellate</b> cysts {{have a long}} {{geological}} {{record with}} lowest occurrences during the mid Triassic, whilst geochemical markers suggest a presence to the Early Cambrian. Some of the Paleozoic acritarchs possibly are related to <b>dinoflagellate</b> cysts. Arpylorus, from the Silurian of North Africa, was at one time {{considered to be a}} <b>dinoflagellate</b> cyst, but this palynomorph is now considered probably an arthropod remain. Another enigmatic form with possible early <b>dinoflagellate</b> affinity is Palaeodinophysis altaica, which was found in the Devonian of Kazakhstan.|$|R
5|$|Many corals in {{the order}} Scleractinia are hermatypic, meaning that they are {{involved}} in building reefs. Most such corals obtain some of their energy from zooxanthellae in the genus Symbiodinium. These are symbiotic photosynthetic <b>dinoflagellates</b> which require sunlight; reef-forming corals are therefore found mainly in shallow water. They secrete calcium carbonate to form hard skeletons that become the framework of the reef. However, not all reef-building corals in shallow water contain zooxanthellae, and some deep water species, living at depths to which light cannot penetrate, form reefs but do not harbour the symbionts.|$|E
5|$|Most cnidarians prey on organisms {{ranging in}} size from {{plankton}} to animals several times larger than themselves, but many obtain much of their nutrition from <b>dinoflagellates,</b> and a few are parasites. Many are preyed on by other animals including starfish, sea slugs, fish, turtles, and even other cnidarians. Many scleractinian corals—which form the structural foundation for coral reefs—possess polyps that are filled with symbiotic photo-synthetic zooxanthellae. While reef-forming corals are almost entirely restricted to warm and shallow marine waters, other cnidarians can be found at great depths, in polar regions, and in freshwater.|$|E
5|$|Paralytic {{shellfish}} poisoning (PSP) {{is primarily}} {{caused by the}} consumption of bivalves that have accumulated toxins by feeding on toxic <b>dinoflagellates,</b> single-celled protists found naturally in the sea and inland waters. Saxitoxin is the most virulent of these. In mild cases, PSP causes tingling, numbness, sickness and diarrhoea. In more severe cases, {{the muscles of the}} chest wall may be affected leading to paralysis and even death. In 1937, researchers in California established the connection between blooms of these phytoplankton and PSP. The biotoxin remains potent even when the shellfish are well-cooked. In the United States, there is a regulatory limit of 80µg/g of saxitoxin equivalent in shellfish meat.|$|E

40|$|Calculation of {{evolutionary}} rates reveals the patterns of, and possible processes responsible for, early <b>dinoflagellate</b> evolution. Speciations, extinctions, turnover rates and diversities of <b>dinoflagellate</b> cysts are synchronous {{to the main}} Early Jurassic (Toarcian) palaeoceanographic events, which include eustatic changes, anoxic intervals and isotopic events. The synchronicity is strongly indicative of abiotic control on <b>dinoflagellate</b> evolution. Different distribution patterns, stratigraphical ranges and evolutionary rates for <b>dinoflagellate</b> cysts in the Boreal and Tethyan Realms are related to different reactions of these two provincial communities to the palaeogeographical changes...|$|R
40|$|<b>Dinoflagellate</b> cysts and pollen {{from the}} South China Sea (SCS) are {{investigated}} {{to test their}} applicability as paleoceanographic/paleoclimatic indicators. Modern distribution patterns and species composition of <b>dinoflagellate</b> cysts are determined in 86 surface sediment samples. A total of 45 <b>dinoflagellate</b> cyst species are identified. Multivariate statistical analysis of the <b>dinoflagellate</b> cyst assemblage show that the distribution patterns and the species compositions are strongly related to the distance of a surface sample from the coast. This relationship may be the the result of offshore transport from the high productivty shallow coastal areas and/or of surface water productivity gradients in the SCS. The <b>dinoflagellate</b> cyst taxa can therefore be divided into three groups {{on the basis of}} surface water productivity. To test if these groupings can be used to reconstruct past changes in surface water productivity, the <b>dinoflagellate</b> cyst and pollen content from the high resolution core GIK 18267 - 3 are investigated...|$|R
5|$|A typical {{sea anemone}} {{is a single}} polyp {{attached}} to a hard surface by its base, but some species live in soft sediment and a few float near {{the surface of the}} water. The polyp has a columnar trunk topped by an oral disc with a ring of tentacles and a central mouth. The tentacles can be retracted inside the body cavity or expanded to catch passing prey. They are armed with cnidocytes (stinging cells). In many species, additional nourishment comes from a symbiotic relationship with single-celled <b>dinoflagellates,</b> zooxanthellae or with green algae, zoochlorellae, that live within the cells. Some species of sea anemone live in association with hermit crabs, small fish or other animals to their mutual benefit.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} known {{for more than a century}} that {{consumption}} of raw or insufficiently cooked shellfish can be associated with infectious diseases. These are caused either by bacteria naturally present in the sea such as Vibrio spp. or by viruses and bacteria from sewage effluent that sometimes contaminates coastal waters. As filter feeders, bivalves pass large quantities of water through their gills, filtering out the organic particles, including the microbial pathogens. These are retained in the animals' tissues and become concentrated in their liver-like digestive glands. Another possible source of contamination occurs when bivalves contain marine biotoxins as a result of ingesting numerous <b>dinoflagellates.</b> These microalgae are not associated with sewage but occur unpredictably as algal blooms. Large areas of a sea or lake may change colour as a result of the proliferation of millions of single-cell algae, and this condition is known as a red tide.|$|E
5|$|Caprellamutica are {{omnivorous}} highly adaptable opportunistic feeders. Examinations {{of their}} stomach contents reveal a highly varied diet that {{depended on the}} particular substrate they are found on. They are predominantly detritivores, but have the remarkable ability of adjusting feeding methods from being grazers, scavengers, filter feeders, and even predators depending on the conditions of their environments. C.mutica sieve food particles or small organisms from the water by waving their bodies back and forth, with the comb-like setae on their second pair of antennae extended. They then clean off trapped particles by bending their antennae down to their mouthparts. They also use their antennae to scrape food particles from surfaces of their bodies or the substrate that they are clinging to. The large gnathopods are used for striking at and grasping both mobile and sessile prey. Known prey organisms of C.mutica include algae (both planktonic and macroalgae), <b>dinoflagellates,</b> hydrozoans, bryozoans, diatoms, copepods, brine shrimps, and other amphipods. They are capable of feeding on suspended organic particles, including fish feed and decaying organic matter. C.mutica are also known to engage in cannibalistic behavior on dead and dying individuals of their own species or genus.|$|E

40|$|Several <b>dinoflagellate</b> {{species have}} {{plastids}} that more closely {{resemble those of}} an unrelated algal group, the haptophytes, suggesting these plastids have been obtained by tertiary endosymbiosis. Because both groups are photosynthetic, all of the genes for nuclear-encoded plastid proteins might be supplied by the <b>dinoflagellate</b> host or some of them might {{have been replaced by}} haptophyte genes. Sequences of the conserved nuclear psbO gene were obtained from the haptophyte Isochrysis galbana, the peridinin-containing <b>dinoflagellate</b> Heterocapsa triquetra, and the 19 ′hexanoyloxy-fucoxanthin-containing <b>dinoflagellate</b> Karenia brevis. Phylogenetic analysis of the oxygen-evolving-enhancer (PsbO) proteins confirmed that in K. brevis the original peridinin-type plastid was replaced by that of a haptophyte, an alga which had previously acquired a red algal chloroplast by secondary endosymbiosis. It showed clearly that during this tertiary symbiogenesis the original psbO gene in the <b>dinoflagellate</b> nucleus was replaced by a psbO gene from the haptophyte nucleus. The phylogenetic analysis also confirmed that the origin of the peridinin-type <b>dinoflagellate</b> plastid was indeed a red alga...|$|R

5|$|Large and formidably toothed, the pigeye shark is {{regarded}} as potentially dangerous to humans, though {{it has not been}} implicated in any attacks. This species is caught infrequently on longlines and in gillnets, and is used for meat and fins. As a predator, though, the shark can accumulate ciguatera toxins produced by <b>dinoflagellates</b> within its tissues. In November 1993, some 500 people in Manakara, Madagascar, were poisoned, 98 of them fatally, after eating meat from a pigeye shark. This was the first recorded mass ciguatera outbreak caused by a shark, as well as the first with a significant death toll. The IUCN has listed the pigeye shark overall as Data Deficient, while noting that its rarity may render it susceptible to overfishing. In KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, small numbers of pigeye sharks are caught in shark nets set up to protect beaches. The catch rate and the average size of sharks caught both decreased between 1978 and 1998, leading to concerns that the local population may be depleted. Thus, the IUCN has given this species a regional assessment of Near Threatened in the southwestern Indian Ocean.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific {{angelshark}} {{is primarily}} a visual hunter; experiments in nature show that they strike at fish-shaped targets without any electrical, chemical, vibrational, or behavioral cues. At night, they are guided by the bioluminescence of planktonic <b>dinoflagellates</b> and ostracods disturbed by moving prey. This species' visual system is attuned to the wavelengths of light emitted by these planktonic organisms, showing the importance of night hunting. Pacific angelsharks {{are more likely to}} strike at prey approaching from the front. It usually waits until the prey approaches to , as its attack is less accurate beyond this distance. The strike is a stereotyped behavior in which the shark presses the forward lobes of its pectoral fins against the bottom and thrusts its head upwards at up to a 90° angle. Its mouth forms a tube when opened, creating a suction force, while its jaws protude forward to secure the prey between sharp teeth. During the strike, the eyes roll backward into the head for protection. The strike is often completed in under a tenth of a second.|$|E
25|$|Major {{parts of}} the food of Limacina helicina include tintinnid (Tintinnida), small {{crustaceans}} - copepods (Copepoda) and juvenile specimen of its own species (cannibalism). Danish zoologist Johan Erik Vesti Boas reported diatoms (Bacillariophyceae), <b>dinoflagellates</b> (Dinoflagellata) and tintinnids in the digestive system of Limacina helicina in 1888 already. Diatoms and <b>dinoflagellates</b> appear to pass the digestive system of adults largely intact. Fecal pellets of Limacina helicina contains small cells, <b>dinoflagellates</b> and diatoms as main largely intact food items and also few small fragments of tintinnids, Limacina and copepods. All experiments performed on Limacina helicina in the laboratory were done on starved specimens, {{because they do not}} feed in unnatural conditions.|$|E

40|$|Biostratigraphic {{studies of}} several {{sections}} and a borehole (Belverde) of the Lower Tagus Basin, based on Miocene <b>dinoflagellate</b> cyst assemblages, have allowed a detailed stratigraphic investigation to be conducted.

25|$|The {{first person}} to {{recognize}} fossil <b>dinoflagellates</b> was Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg, who reported his discovery in a paper presented to the Berlin Academy of Sciences in July 1836. He had observed clearly tabulate <b>dinoflagellates</b> in thin flakes of Cretaceous flint and considered those <b>dinoflagellates</b> to have been silicified. Along with them, and of comparable size, were spheroidal to ovoidal bodies bearing an array of spines or tubes of variable character. Ehrenberg interpreted these as being originally siliceous and thought them to be desmids (freshwater conjugating algae), placing them within his own Recent desmid genus Xanthidium. Though summaries of Ehrenberg's work appeared earlier, it was not published in full until 1837 or 1838; the date is uncertain.|$|E
25|$|The one {{distinctive}} feature {{common to all}} cysts is the excystment opening (archaeopyle) through which the emerging new motile stage exits. In many cases this reflects a recognizable part of the tabulation (one or more plates). However {{it should be noted}} that one large group of <b>dinoflagellates</b> (athecate - or naked <b>dinoflagellates)</b> do not have thecal plates and therefore produce cysts lacking all forms of reflected tabulation.|$|E

40|$|The {{activities}} of the enzymes a and b-glucosidase, leucine aminopeptidase and alkaline phosphatase were measured in cultures of the <b>dinoflagellate</b> Prorocentrum minimum (Pav.) J. Schiller, and in field samples collected during <b>dinoflagellate</b> blooms in tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay. Activities were measured using fluorogenic artificial substrates and partitioned among different size fractions. Little to no glucosidase activity was found associated with the <b>dinoflagellate</b> size fraction in either cultures or in field samples. A large {{fraction of the total}} aminopeptidase (LAP) activity in cultures was found in the <b>dinoflagellate</b> size fraction. LAP activity was positively correlated with <b>dinoflagellate</b> abundance and chl a, and negatively correlated with ammonium concentration. Alkaline phosphatase exhibited a strong response to P-deficiency, increasing up to 330 times in P-depleted cells compared to P-replete conditions, and decreasing after addition of phosphate. P. minimum can make a substantial contribution to ectocellular hydrolytic activity in the water column during blooms...|$|R
40|$|The {{lower and}} middle Toarcian (Lower Jurassic) {{successions}} {{of the northern}} Lusitanian Basin in western Portugal were examined for palynomorphs. Two localities, the Maria Pares and the Vale das Fontes sections, were sampled. The sections span the Dactylioceras polymorphum, Hildaites levisoni and Hildoceras bifrons ammonite biozones. The samples produced relatively low diversity <b>dinoflagellate</b> cyst floras which are typical of those from coeval European successions; the most abundant species is Luehndea spinosa. The other forms encountered were Mancodinium semitabulatum, Mendicodinium microscabratum, M. spinosum subsp. spinosum, Mendicodinium sp., Nannoceratopsis ambonis, N. gracilis and N. senex. <b>Dinoflagellate</b> cysts typically dominate throughout the Dactylioceras polymorphum ammonite biozone; their abundance significantly decreased in the overlying Hildaites levisoni and Hildoceras bifrons ammonite biozones. The low diversity Luehndea-Nannoceratopsis <b>dinoflagellate</b> cyst flora of the northern Lusitanian Basin is characteristic of the Sub-Boreal region of Europe. This is a transitional region, intercalated between the Boreal and Tethyan realms. The Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event (T-OAE) in the northern Lusitanian Basin is characterised by a sudden decline in palynomorph abundance and diversity, including the virtual absence of acritarchs and <b>dinoflagellate</b> cysts. Following the T-OAE, Mancodinium semitabulatum and Mendicodinium spp. were the only <b>dinoflagellate</b> cysts recorded. This ‘blackout’ of <b>dinoflagellate</b> cysts during the T-OAE, and their partial recovery following the event, shows that <b>dinoflagellate</b> populations were responding to a major palaeoenvironmental change...|$|R

Then, the susceptibility of 433 microalgal strains to P. sinerae infection was studied. The parasitoid was found to be capable of infecting several <b>dinoflagellate</b> species of the genera Alexandrium, Coolia, Dinophysis, Fragilidium, Gambierdiscus, Gymnodinium, Gyrodinium, Heterocapsa, Kryptoperidinium, Lepidodinium, Ostreopsis, Pentapharsodinium, Protoceratium, Scrippsiella, and Woloszynskia. Intra-strain variability was observed as well, such that within the same <b>dinoflagellate</b> species some strains were infected whereas others were not. Likewise, species of other <b>dinoflagellate</b> genera were not infected, such as Akashiwo, Amphidinium, Barrufeta, Bysmatrum, Karenia, Karlodinium, Prorocentrum, and Takayama. Moreover, P. sinerae was not able to infect any of the tested haptophyte, diatom, and chlorophyte species. In natural samples screened for P. sinerae infectivity, several <b>dinoflagellate</b> species of the genera Alexandrium, Coolia, Gonyaulax, Gymnodinium, Phalacroma, Protoperidinium, and Scrippsiella were identified as susceptible. Sporangia size was found to be proportional {{to the size of the}} host, and variations in the sporangia size were observed to influence their maturation time. (c) 2012 Elsevier GmbH.
