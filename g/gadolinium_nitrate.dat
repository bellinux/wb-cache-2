The result is that the reactor heat output is reduced by 90% within 2 seconds.|$|E
50|$|Liquid neutron {{absorbers}} {{are also}} used in rapid shutdown systems for light water reactors. Following a SCRAM, if the reactor (or section(s) thereof) are not below the shutdown margin (that is, they could return to a critical state due to insertion of positive reactivity from cooling, poison decay, or other uncontrolled conditions), the operators can inject solutions containing neutron poisons directly into the reactor coolant. Neutron poisons are water-based solutions that contain chemicals that absorb neutrons, such as common household borax, sodium polyborate, boric acid, or <b>gadolinium</b> <b>nitrate,</b> causing a decrease in neutron multiplication, and thus shutting down the reactor without use of the control rods. In the PWR, these neutron absorbing solutions are stored in pressurized tanks (called accumulators) that {{are attached to the}} primary coolant system via valves; a varying level of neutron absorbent is kept within the primary coolant at all times, and is increased using the accumulators {{in the event of a}} failure of all of the control rods to insert, which will promptly bring the reactor below the shutdown margin. In the BWR, soluble neutron absorbers are found within the Standby Liquid Control System (SLCS), which uses redundant battery-operated injection pumps, or, in the latest models, high pressure nitrogen gas to inject the neutron absorber solution into the reactor vessel against any pressure within. Because they may delay the restart of a reactor, these systems are only used to shut down the reactor if control rod insertion fails. This concern is especially significant in a BWR, where injection of liquid boron would cause precipitation of solid boron compounds on fuel cladding, which would prevent the reactor from restarting until the boron deposits were removed.|$|E

40|$|In late 1992, the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) was {{planning}} to switch the solution contained in the poison injection tank from cadmium nitrate to <b>gadolinium</b> <b>nitrate.</b> The poison injection system is an emergency system used {{to shut down the}} reactor by adding a neutron poison to the cooling water. This system must be able to supply a minimum of 69 pounds of gadolinium to the reactor coolant system in order to guarantee that the reactor would become subcritical. A graph of the density of <b>gadolinium</b> <b>nitrate</b> solutions over a concentration range of 5 to 30 wt% and a temperature range of 15 to 40 {sup o}C was prepared. Routine density measurements of the solution in the poison injection tank are made by HFIR personnel, and an adaptation of the original graph is used to determine the <b>gadolinium</b> <b>nitrate</b> concentration. In late 2008, HFIR personnel decided that the heat tracing that was present on the piping for the poison injection system could be removed without any danger of freezing the solution; however, the <b>gadolinium</b> <b>nitrate</b> solution might get as cold as 5 {sup o}C. This was outside the range of the current density-concentration correlation, so the range needed to be expanded. This report supplies a new density-concentration correlation that covers the extended temperature range. The correlation is given in new units, which greatly simplifies the calculation that is required to determine the pounds of gadolinium in the tank solution. The procedure for calculating the amount of gadolinium in the HFIR poison injection system is as follows: (1) Calculate the usable volume in the system; (2) Measure the density of the solution; (3) Calculate the gadolinium concentration using the following equation: Gd(lb/ft{sup 3 }) = measured density (g/mL) x 34. 681 - 34. 785; (4) Calculate the amount of gadolinium in the system using the following equation: Amount of Gd(lb) = Gd concentration (lb/ft{sup 3 }) x usable volume (ft{sup 3 }). The equation in step 3 is exact for a temperature of 5 {sup o}C, and overestimates the gadolinium concentration at all higher temperatures. This guarantees that the calculation is conservative, in that the actual concentration will be at least as high as that calculated. If an additional safety factor is desired, it is recommended that an administrative control limit be set that is higher than the required minimum amount of gadolinium...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackground: The {{structure}} of simian virus 40 (SV 40), previously determined at 3. 8 å resolution, shows how its pentameric VP 1 assembly units are tied together by extended C-terminal arms. In order to define more precisely the possible assembly mechanisms, we have refined the structure at 3. 1 å resolution. Results New {{data from a}} high-intensity synchrotron source {{have been used for}} phase extension by electron-density averaging and refinement, exploiting only the strict 5 -fold non-crystallographic symmetry for the real-space averaging steps. The accurate model enables us to study important structural features of the virus particle in detail. The remarkably invariant core of the VP 1 pentamer bears the docking sites for the C-terminal arms from other pentamers. These contacts are the principal way in which pentameric assembly units are linked together in the capsid. Only at the interface between five-coordinated and six-coordinated pentamers do the pentamer cores appear to interact strongly. There are two cation-binding sites per VP 1 monomer, seen in a soaking experiment with <b>gadolinium</b> <b>nitrate.</b> These sites are quite close to each other at the interfaces between pentamers. Conclusion We propose that the contact between five-coordinated and six-coordinated pentamers may help to generate a six-pentamer nucleus, with which further pentamers can assemble to generate the complete particle.

Expected typical concentrations of probable impurities were tested {{and the removal of}} these impurities by a decontamination wash was measured. Impurity concentrations are compared to two specifications - designated as Column A or Column B (most restrictive) - proposed for plutonium oxide (PuO{sub 2 }) product shipped to the Mixed Oxide (MOX) Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF). Use of Gd as a neutron poison requires a larger volume of wash for the proposed Column A specification. Since boron (B) has a higher proposed specification and is more easily removed by washing, it appears to be the better candidate for use in the H-Canyon dissolution process. Some difficulty was observed in achieving the Column A specification due to the limited effectiveness that the wash step has in removing the residual B after {approx} 4 BV's wash. However a combination of the experimental 10 BV's wash results and a calculated DF from the oxalate precipitation process yields an overall DF sufficient to meet the Column A specification. For those impurities (other than B) not removed by 10 BV's of wash, the impurity is either not expected to be present in the feedstock or process, or recommendations have been provided for improvement in the analytical detection/method or validation of calculated results.

In the past, this disposition strategy has been successfully used to discard solutions containing approximately 100 kg of Pu to the SRS high level waste (HLW) system. In the current experiments, gadolinium (as Gd(NO 3) 3) was added to samples of a 3 : 1 U:Pu solution, a surrogate 3 g/L U solution, and a surrogate 3 g/L U with 1 g/L Pu solution. A series of experiments was then performed to observe and characterize the precipitate at selected pH values. Solids formed at pH 4. 5 and were found to contain at least 50 percent of the U and 94 percent of the Pu, but only 6 percent of the Gd. As the pH of the solution increased (e. g., pH greater than 14 with 1. 2 or 3. 6 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) excess), the precipitate contained greater than 99 percent of the Pu, U, and Gd. After the pH greater than 14 systems were undisturbed for one week, no significant changes were found in the composition of the solid or supernate for each sample. The solids were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) which found sodium diuranate (Na 2 U 2 O 7) and gadolinium hydroxide (Gd(OH) 3) at pH 14. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) indicated sufficient water molecules were present in the solids to thermalize the neutrons, a requirement for the use of Gd as a neutron poison. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was also performed and the accompanying back-scattering electron analysis (BSE) found Pu, U, and Gd compounds in all pH greater than 14 precipitate samples. The rheological properties of the slurries at pH greater than 14 were also investigated by performing precipitate settling rate studies and measuring the viscosity and density of the materials.

After the precipitation and filtration processes, the filtrate solution {{will be transferred from}} HB-Line to H-Canyon. The presence of excess oxalate and unfiltered Pu oxalate solids in these solutions create a criticality safety issue if they are sent to H-Canyon without controls in H-Canyon. One approach involves H-Canyon receiving the filtrate solution into a tank that is poisoned with soluble gadolinium (Gd). Decomposition of the oxalate will occur within a subsequent H-Canyon vessel. The receipt of excess oxalate into the H-Canyon receipt tanks has the potential to precipitate a portion of the Gd poison in the receipt tanks. Because the amount of Gd in solution determines the maximum amount of Pu solids that H-Canyon can receive, H-Canyon Engineering requested that SRNL determine the solubility of Gd in aqueous solutions of 4 - 10 M nitric acid (HNO{sub 3 }), 4 - 12 g/L Gd, and 0. 15 - 0. 25 M oxalic acid (H{sub 2 }C{sub 2 }O{sub 4 }) at 25 °C. The target soluble Gd concentration is 6 g/L. The data indicate that the target can be achieved above 6 M HNO{sub 3 } and below 0. 25 M H{sub 2 }C{sub 2 }O{sub 4 }. At 25 °C, for 6 M HNO{sub 3 }, 11 g/L and 7 g/L Gd are soluble in 0. 15 M and 0. 25 M H{sub 2 }C{sub 2 }O{sub 4 }, respectively. In 4 M HNO{sub 3 }, the Gd solubility drops significantly to 2. 5 g/L and 0. 8 g/L in 0. 15 M and 0. 25 M H{sub 2 }C{sub 2 }O{sub 4 }, respectively. The solubility of Gd at 8 - 10 M HNO{sub 3 } exceeds the solubility at 6 M HNO{sub 3 }. The data for 4 M HNO{sub 3 } showed good agreement with data in the literature. To achieve a target of 6 g/L soluble Gd in solution in the presence of 0. 15 - 0. 25 M oxalate, the HNO{sub 3 } concentration must be maintained at or above 6 M HNO{sub 3 }. The solubility of Gd in 4 M HNO{sub 3 } with 0. 15 M oxalate at 10 °C is about 1. 5 g/L. For 6 M HNO{sub 3 } with 0. 15 M oxalate, the solubility of Gd at 10 °C is about 10 g/L. <b>Gadolinium</b> <b>nitrate</b> is very soluble in HNO{sub 3 }. The solubility of Gd is linear as a function of HNO{sub 3 } from 343 g/L Gd in 2. 88 M HNO{sub 3 } to 149 g/L in 8. 16 M HNO{sub 3 }. Below 2. 88 M HNO{sub 3 }, the solubility of Gd approaches a limit of about 360 g/L. However, there are no data available below 1. 40 M HNO{sub 3 }, which has a Gd solubility of 353 g/L...|$|E
40|$|Fuel cell is an emerging, cleanest, {{environmental}} friendly and pollution free technology, which converts chemical energy of fuel into electricity, heat and power without combustion. Fuel cells are categorized {{according to their}} electrolytic materials and working temperature. Solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is the most dominant and prominent among the fuel cell family. In other words, fuel cell {{is one of the}} most competitive candidates that could provide possibly accomplishments. Conventionally, Ni-YSZ cermet anode is used in SOFC, which works in the temperature range of 800 - 1000 oC. Although this anode possesses a high electrochemical activity, high performance as well as electronic conductivity yet it requires a high working temperature to achieve the optimal results. Its high working temperature is the present draw back which becomes a major barrier to its commercialization. if this cell has to be commercialized then there is need to find suitable electrode materials that can operate successfully at low operating temperature. Keeping this in mind, many new electrode materials have been introduced in the present work, which have been classified into two groups; one is containing Ni partially while the other is completely Ni free. New electrode materials were prepared by introducing nano technique using either dry or wet chemical method with an added advantage of low manufacturing temperature. In order to fabricate a complete fuel cell, the compatible electrolyte materials were also prepared by co-precipitation method. These materials exhibited an excellent performance at comparatively low temperature (400 - 600 oC). For SOFC electrode and electrolyte purpose, CuNiZnGdCe (CNZGC), Al 0. 1 NixZn 0. 9 -x (ANZ), Cu 0. 2 Mn 0. 2 Zn 0. 6 (CMZ), Ba 0. 05 Cu 0. 25 FexZn 0. 7 -x (BCFZ),Ba 0. 15 Fe 0. 10 Ti 0. 15 Zn 0. 60 (BFTZ), Ba 0. 4 Sr 0. 6 Co 0. 3 Mn 0. 7 (BSCM), La 0. 1 Sr 0. 9 Co 0. 2 Zn 0. 8 (LSCZ), Na 2 CO 3 -K 2 CO 3 - Ca 0. 2 Ce 0. 8 (NK-CDC) and Gd 0. 1 Ce 0. 9 -Y 2 O 3 (Y-GDC) materials were successfully synthesized by solid state reaction method or wet chemical and co-precipitation method. These electrodes and electrolyte materials were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, electrochemical and electrical techniques. It has been found that the BCFZ- 5 having a composition of Ba 0. 05 Cu 0. 25 Fe 0. 10 Zn 0. 60 shows an electrical conductivity equal to 25. 84 at hydrogen atmosphere. It also exhibited the maximum power density of 741. 87 mW/cm 2 and 933. 41 mW/cm 2 for symmetrical and asymmetrical fuel cell testing schemes. On the basis of these results, BCFZ- 5 material is considered a promising electrode/anode candidate for low temperature solid oxide fuel cell. Different approaches have been implemented to reduce the present cost of electrode and electrolyte materials for solid oxide fuel cell. For example; I. Use of cheap raw material II. Lowering of sintering temperature III. Reduction of sintering time IV. Lowering of operating/working temperature It has been noted that the substitution of zinc compound Zn(NO 3) 2. 6 H 2 O in place of nickel oxide (NiO) has reduced the cost by a factor of. 25 in addition to the lowering of manufacturing and operating temperature, which also reduces the cost indirectly by saving energy and time. Moreover, the cost has been further reduced by a factor of 35 and 18 when samarium nitrate Sm(NO 3) 3. 6 H 2 O and <b>gadolinium</b> <b>nitrate</b> Gd(NO 3) 3. 6 H 2 O are respectively replaced by calcium nitrate Ca(NO 3) 2. 4 H 2 O. The lowering of working temperature from 1000 to 550 oC is a major achievement that would not only reduce the running cost yet it may help in commercialization of solid oxide fuel cell. In a nut shell the electrodes and electrolytes proposed in the present work have successfully lowered the manufacturing as well as working temperature and hence the operational cost along with a significant reduction in the manufacturing cost of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) ...|$|E
