5000|$|Brooks has {{frequently}} expressed admiration for President Barack Obama. In an August 2009, profile of Brooks, The New Republic describes his {{first encounter with}} Obama, {{in the spring of}} 2005: [...] "Usually when I talk to senators, while they may know a policy area better than me, they generally don't know political philosophy better than me. I got the sense he knew both better than me. ... I remember distinctly an image of - we were sitting on his couches, and I was looking at his pant leg and his perfectly creased pant, and I'm thinking, a) he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>president</b> and b) he'll be a very good president." [...] Brooks appreciates that Obama thinks [...] "like a writer," [...] explaining, [...] "He's a very writerly personality, a little aloof, exasperated. He's calm. He's not addicted to people." [...] Two days after Obama's second autobiography, The Audacity of Hope, hit bookstores, Brooks published a column in The New York Times, titled [...] "Run, Barack, Run", urging the Chicago politician to run for president. However, in December 2011, during a C-SPAN interview, Brooks expressed a more tempered opinion of Obama's presidency, giving Obama only a [...] "B-", and saying that Obama's chances of re-election would be less than 50-50 if elections were held at that time. He stated, [...] "I don't think he's integrated himself with people in Washington as much as he should have." [...] However, in a February 2016 New York Times op-ed, Brooks admitted that he missed Obama during the 2016 primary season, admiring the president's [...] "integrity" [...] and [...] "humanity" [...] among other characteristics.|$|E

Dwight D. Eisenhower, 1968. 10. 1 The Economy as a Public Issue Although former President Eisenhower's {{forecast}} turned out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> wrong, numerous empirical studies show that macroeconomic perform-ance has an important impact on mass political support for elected officials. 1 Moreover, during recent years economic issues (principally inflation, the energy crisis, and unemployment) have overshadowed other problem areas as sources of public concern. Indeed, not since the Great Depression of the 1930 s and the immediate post-World War II reconversion scare has {{the state of the}} economy occupied such a salient place on the public agenda. As the Gallup Poll time-series data in figure 10. 1 show, in every year since completion of the American withdrawal from Vietnam more than 70 % of the public identified an economic issue as "the most important problem facing the country today.

5000|$|John Gibson, {{the former}} host of an {{afternoon}} hour of news coverage called The Big Story, was cited {{as an example}} of Fox News blurring the lines between objective reporting and opinion/editorial programming. Gibson caused a general rampage among listeners immediately after the 2000 presidential election controversy when, during the opinion segment of his show, Gibson said: [...] "Is this a case where knowing the facts actually would be worse than not knowing? I mean, should we burn these ballots, preserve them in amber, or shred them?" [...] and [...] "George Bush is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>president.</b> And who needs to know that he's not a legitimate president?" [...] In an opinion piece on the Hutton Inquiry decision, Gibson said the BBC had [...] "a frothing-at-the-mouth anti-Americanism that was obsessive, irrational and dishonest" [...] and that the BBC reporter, Andrew Gilligan, [...] "insisted on air that the Iraqi Army was heroically repulsing an incompetent American Military." [...] In reviewing viewer complaints, Ofcom (the United Kingdom's statutory broadcasting regulator) ruled that Fox News had breached the program code in three areas: [...] "respect for truth", [...] "opportunity to take part", and [...] "personal opinions expressed (in an opinion slot) must not rest upon false evidence." [...] Fox News admitted that Gilligan had not actually said the words that John Gibson appeared to attribute to him; Ofcom rejected the claim that it was intended to be a paraphrase. (See.) Gibson has also called Joe Wilson a [...] "liar", claimed that [...] "the far left" [...] is working for Al Qaeda and stated that he wished that Paris had been host to the 2012 Olympic Games, because it would have subjected the city to the threat of terrorism instead of London.|$|E
5000|$|As Vice <b>President,</b> Humphrey <b>was</b> {{controversial}} for his {{complete and}} vocal loyalty to Johnson and {{the policies of}} the Johnson Administration, even as many of his liberal admirers opposed Johnson's policies with increasing fervor regarding the Vietnam War. Many of Humphrey's liberal friends and allies abandoned him because of his refusal to publicly criticize Johnson's Vietnam War policies. Humphrey's critics later learned that Johnson had threatened Humphrey - Johnson told Humphrey that if he publicly criticized his policy, he would destroy Humphrey's chances to become President by opposing his nomination at the next Democratic Convention. However, Humphrey's critics were vocal and persistent: even his nickname, [...] "the Happy Warrior", was used against him. The nickname referred not to his military hawkishness, but rather to his crusading for social welfare and civil rights programs. After his narrow defeat in the 1968 presidential election, Humphrey wrote that [...] "After four years as Vice-President ... I had lost some of my personal identity and personal forcefulness. ... I ought not to have let a man Johnson who <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a former <b>President</b> dictate my future." ...|$|R
500|$|June {{started off}} {{as all the}} {{previous}} months had, with Dodd campaigning in New Hampshire and Iowa, but at the June 3 debate in Manchester he made a notable statement {{that led to a}} huge applause from the crowd. During the debate he pointed out a woman in the audience whose husband was fighting in the War on Terrorism, he thanked her for the sacrifice and stated the importance of standing up for America's security while on the campaign trail, [...] "No one <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> elected <b>president</b> who <b>is</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have as their primary responsibility to keep us safe and secure." [...] After the debate Dodd went back to the trails, but while campaigning he found a new tool to help spread his message. The campaign encouraged voters to confront politicians with video cameras and ask them to talk about Iraq and to support the [...] "Dodd Amendment" [...] which would have required American troops to start redeployment in 30 days. The final step was for the voters to post the interactions on YouTube. The Dodd campaign has used the internet more frequently than other campaigns, often airing staff meetings via the web. The campaign released a new advertisement on June 16 entitled [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] which focused on Dodd's time in the Peace Corps. As June came to a close Dodd made his final appearance of the month at a forum in Lake Buena Vista, Florida, the first time he visited the state which moved up its primary dates, causing a controversy with the DNC. On June 30 the campaign revealed the fundraising totals for the second quarter, Dodd raised $3,250,730, spent $4,384,580 and had a total of $6,378,271 cash on hand.|$|R
5000|$|Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros, {{along with}} Russian oligarchs such as Boris Berezovsky, Vladimir Gusinsky, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Anatoly Chubais, and others feared a Communist {{resurgence}} in Russia while witnessing Zyuganov present {{himself as a}} kinder, gentler Communist while attending the World Economic Forum at Davos in 1996. Chubais recalled, stating [...] "I saw many of my good friends, presidents of major American companies, European companies, who were simply dancing around Zyuganov, trying to catch his eye, peering at him. These were the world's most powerful businessmen, with world famous names, who with their entire appearance demonstrated that they were seeking support of the future president of Russia, because it <b>was</b> clear <b>to</b> everyone that Zyuganov <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the future <b>president</b> of Russia, and now they needed to build a relationship with him. So, this shook me up!" [...] The oligarchs set aside their differences and held several private meetings in Davos hotel rooms, where they strategized over how to defeat the perceived Zyuganov threat. The result was the [...] "Davos pact", an agreement between Chubais and the oligarchs that he would lead an anti-Communist campaign against Zuyganov, that they agreed to fund. The subsequent months saw a massive media offensive as [...] "money poured into advertising campaigns, into regional tours, into bribing journalists", all supported by the oligarchs whom owned the major media. Yeltsin's subsequent victory in that election can <b>be</b> traced back <b>to</b> the events {{that took place in}} Davos between Chubais and those Russian oligarchs.|$|R

In [...] "Unforeseen circumstANTs", she is still dating Fletcher. She obviously really likes him and looked excited when Chyna told her {{he was in love with}} her. Chyna tried to warn her that Fletcher intended to break up with her, but Kennedy misinterprets it as an attempt for Chyna to claim Fletcher for herself. Rather than break up with her, Fletcher says that she's the sweetest girlfriend ever. Fletcher then tells Chyna that he was so focused on how unlike Chyna and Kennedy were, that he completely overlooked her positive qualities.
