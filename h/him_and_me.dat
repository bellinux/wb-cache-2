5|$|As to Captain Benbow, I {{know of no}} {{difference}} between <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>me,</b> nor have we had any. He has no small obligation to me, but being called {{in some of the}} foolish printed papers ‘the famous Captain Benbow’, I suppose has put him a little out of himself, and has made him play the fool, as I guess, in some of his letters. I will not farther now particularize this business, but time will show I have not been in the wrong, unless being too kind to an ungrateful man.|$|E
2500|$|Ağca {{was caught}} and {{restrained}} by a nun and other bystanders until police arrived. He {{was sentenced to}} life imprisonment. Two days after Christmas in 1983, John Paul II visited Ağca in prison. John Paul II and Ağca spoke privately for about twenty minutes. John Paul II said, [...] "What we talked about will have to remain a secret between <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>me.</b> I spoke to him as a brother whom I have pardoned and who has my complete trust." ...|$|E

2500|$|His {{appointment}} attracted {{controversy in}} some quarters and it was reputed that the other judges of the court were against his appointment. [...] Biographer Percival Serle states that Salomons's response to criticism was that his [...] "appointment appears to be so wholly unjustifiable [...] as to {{have led to the}} utterance by him of such expressions and opinions…as to make any intercourse in the future between <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>me</b> quite impossible". Serle states that each of the judges of the court denied making any such statements. [...] He had general support with most newspapers and from the legal profession. [...] Nevertheless, he decided on 19 November 1886 to resign the position before actually taking the oath of office. [...] He was therefore gazetted as chief justice for only six days, having resigned twelve days after being offered the position.|$|E

In 1988, Wilson said that [...] "Dr. Landy doesn't like {{me to be in}} touch with my family too much. He thinks it's unhealthy." [...] Landy responded to the charges that he exerted too much control on the songwriter: [...] "He's got a car phone in his car. If he wants to call somebody, he calls somebody... He can go anywhere, on his own, anytime he wants." [...] Regarding Wilson's relationship to the Beach Boys at that time, Wilson added: [...] "Although we stay together as a group, as people we're a far cry from friends. One time we were doing an interview together, and the interviewer asked Carl what it was between <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>me.</b> He goes, 'Well, Brian and I don't have to talk to each other. We're just Beach Boys, but we don't need to be friends.' And that's true. Although, whenever I think about him, I feel rotten." ...|$|E

I may give an occasional support to Mr Pitt...; I do and mean to give such support to {{the measure of the}} present war, to its propriety, its necessity, its justice...; but systematically I continue to be, and am, in opposition to him and his Ministry: there exists many a knotty point to be adjusted between <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>me,</b> many difficulties very important in their nature to be smoothed, much obliteration of facts not easy to be affected, and the general face of things strangely to be altered, before I retire from my watch upon his Ministry. ... delivered himself over into the hands of Pitt, formally and professedly, last November. ...
