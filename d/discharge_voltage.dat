[...] Many different solid electrolytes have been proposed to replace these hazardous liquid electrolytes. For most solid-state batteries, high interfacial resistance lowers the reversibility of the intercalation process, shortening the life cycle. [...] These undesirable interfacial effects are less problematic for TiS2. [...] One all-solid-state lithium battery exhibited a power density of 1000 W/kg over 50 cycles with a maximum power density of 1500 W/kg. [...] Additionally, the average capacity of the battery decreased by less than 10% over 50 cycles.

Parametric failures occur at intermediate <b>discharge</b> <b>voltages</b> and occur more often, with latent failures the most common. For each parametric failure, there are 4-10 latent ones. Modern VLSI circuits are more ESD-sensitive, with smaller features, lower capacitance and higher voltage-to-charge ratio. Silicon deposition of the conductive layers makes them more conductive, reducing the ballast resistance that has a protective role.|$|R

50|$|The propellant, such as xenon gas, is {{fed through}} the anode, which has {{numerous}} small {{holes in it}} {{to act as a}} gas distributor. Xenon propellant is used because of its high atomic weight and low ionization potential. As the neutral xenon atoms diffuse into the channel of the thruster, they are ionized by collisions with circulating high-energy electrons (typically 10-40 eV, or about 10% of the <b>discharge</b> <b>voltage).</b> Once ionized, the xenon ions typically have a charge of +1, though a small fraction (~20%) have +2.|$|E

Various values of G 9, 16 and 28 wt% were prepared and studied as cathode materials for an alkaline Zn-CuO Battery. The EIS results demonstrated that increasing the mass ratio of G caused {{significant decrease in}} charge transfer resistance (Rct) and capacitive behavior of the electrode.

At lower currents, the voltage across the tube is almost current-independent; this is used in glow <b>discharge</b> <b>voltage</b> stabilizers. At lower currents, {{the area of the}} electrodes covered by the glow discharge is proportional to the current. At higher currents the normal glow turns into abnormal glow, the voltage across the tube gradually increases, and the glow discharge covers {{more and more of the}} surface of the electrodes. Low-power switching (glow-discharge thyratrons), voltage stabilization, and lighting applications (e.g. Nixie tubes, decatrons, neon lamps) operate in this region.|$|E

50|$|This {{model is}} {{different}} from the other models discovered because it relies only on knowledge of the battery <b>discharge</b> <b>voltage</b> curve and access to battery voltage sensor which is available in all modern Smartphones. The basic idea for this model technique is to use battery state of discharge with running training software programs to control phone component power and activity states. Each individual Smartphone component is held in a specific state for a significant period of time and the change in battery state of discharge is captured using built-in battery voltage sensors. The first challenging idea is to convert battery voltage readings into power consumption. This is determined by state of discharge (which is total consumed energy by battery) variation within a testing interval captured by voltage sensors that will eventually drive the following equation.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. An {{electrical}} conducting copper coating on {{the glass}} substrate is deposited by means of wire exploding spray coating (WESC). The coating system basically consists of a high voltage pulsed power supply and a coating chamber. A pulsed voltage is produced by the power supply upon the metal wire in the coating chamber. The whole process is under taken at atmosphere pressure and room temperature. The coating is more uniform when a higher <b>discharging</b> <b>voltage</b> is applied, which means more energy is deposited into the copper wire in the identical time, so the wire will be destructed more efficiently. A 20 kV <b>discharging</b> <b>voltage</b> is applied in this paper for the balance of coating quality and harmless to the glass substrate. The coating samples are analyzed {{by a series of}} tests. The SEM photograph shows that the copper particles penetrate deeply into the glass substrate, which results in a strong adhesion of the coating, and the thickness of the coating is about 400 to 500 µm after sprayed three times.

5000|$|Cathode {{materials}} are generally constructed {{out of two}} general materials: [...] and [...] The cobalt-based material develops a pseudo tetrahedral structure that allows for two-dimensional lithium ion diffusion. [...] The cobalt-based cathodes are ideal due to their high theoretical specific heat capacity, high volumetric capacity, low self-discharge, high <b>discharge</b> <b>voltage,</b> and good cycling performance. Limitations include {{the high cost of}} the material, and low thermal stability. [...] The manganese-based materials adopt a cubic crystal lattice system, which allows for three-dimensional lithium ion diffusion. Manganese cathodes are attractive because manganese is cheaper and because it could theoretically be used to make a more efficient, longer-lasting battery if its limitations could be overcome. Limitations include the tendency for manganese to dissolve into the electrolyte during cycling leading to poor cycling stability for the cathode.
