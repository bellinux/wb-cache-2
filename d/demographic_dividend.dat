India's improved education system is often cited as one of the main contributors to its economic development. Much of the progress, especially in higher education and scientific research, has been credited to various public institutions. While enrollment in higher education has increased steadily over the past decade, reaching a Gross Enrollment Ratio of 24% in 2013, there still remains a significant distance to catch up with tertiary education enrollment levels of developed nations, a challenge that will be necessary to overcome in order to continue to reap a <b>demographic</b> <b>dividend</b> from India's comparatively young population.|$|E

40|$|Many {{countries}} {{in the developed world}} are ageing in terms of their distribution of population. Conversely, a number of {{countries in}} the south have younger population. India for example, has 60 % of its population in the age group of 15 - 59, with the mean age close to 27 years as of present times. The lower share of population in the higher and lower age brackets make the dependency ratio lower than that of the ageing countries. The economic growth such a large share of working age population can usher in lies {{at the core of the}} <b>demographic</b> <b>dividends.</b> However, low human capital, poor health and inadequate physical infrastructure seems to create significant hurdles in the potential growth path such countries can achieve. We investigate through an endogenous growth model applied to the Indian macroeconomic data, as to whether public expenditures in education, health and physical infrastructure are conducive to rapid economic growth commensurate with the projected <b>demographic</b> <b>dividends</b> for India. We deploy a Structural Vector Autoregressive Model on data for shares of public expenditure on education and health as the main pillars of growth of human capital in the country, on the per capita GDP growth rate, the working age population, etc. Importantly, we find that a rise in expenditure on health imparts a positive impact on the working age population through greater participation. However, higher allocations for education and training draws workers away from the labor market in a country with large share of unskilled workers and employment opportunities in the large informal sector...|$|R

30|$|During {{the period}} of dual economy, China’s {{economic}} growth has been characterized by an unlimited supply of labor, which has helped to contain the rates of diminishing returns on capital. The <b>demographic</b> <b>dividends</b> lead to increased rates of savings, which in turn translated into growth in investment, ensuring ample supply of production factors. Massive flow of labor from agriculture to other industries has improved resource reallocation efficiency, and it now constitutes the main determinant of total factor productivity (TFP). Improvements in microeconomic incentive mechanism have increased technological efficiency. The wide technology gap between China and developed nations has actually benefited China via a learning process {{and the introduction of}} foreign direct investment (FDI).

Combining the overlapping generations model with the three generations and general equilibrium growth accounting models, we simulate the effect of demographic change on agricultural and nonagricultural inputs and outputs. Our simulation analyses show that demographic change greatly influenced agriculture and nonagriculture through capital accumulation although the influences of total population and labour were not negligible. Remarkable <b>demographic</b> <b>dividends</b> like the decline of young dependents and increase of adult longevity greatly influenced capital accumulation in Japan in the 1950 s to the 1990 s, which decreased the importance of agriculture.

40|$|Tempo and quantum of {{population}} ageing in the world: development {{opportunities and challenges}} Abstract This diploma thesis aims to identify and describe the differentiation of the scale and dynamics of the ageing process {{in the world at}} sub-regional level and to develop a typology of those sub-regions and selected countries in terms of mentioned characteristics {{of population}} ageing. Furthermore, relatively homogenous groups of countries have been distinguished based on the cluster analysis of social conditions in the context of ageing in order to access their readiness to face further development of the phenomenon. Major development opportunities and imminent challenges associated with population ageing have been evaluated in the end. The results show that the timing and extent of age structure changes are very closely related. Countries that have undergone longer demographic transitions experienced longer demographic windows of opportunity that allowed them to reap the benefits of <b>demographic</b> <b>dividends</b> and to develop better social conditions as a result. Rapidly ageing societies from developing regions, on the contrary, have less time and resources to counteract the challenges resulting from the demographic changes where timely measures and policies have to be prioritized by policymakers.

40|$|The {{performance}} of the Philippine economy has been hindered by the country’s bourgeoning population due to its rapid population growth. For the last decade, the Philippines had the highest annual population growth rates in the Southeast Asian region. In 2009, {{it has become the}} second most populous country in the region with a population of more than 92 million, next only to Indonesia. Unfortunately, these have resulted to forgone economic growth, losing the chance to improve the poverty situation in the country. Thus, it is imperative to speed up the demographic transition in the country through proactive government population management policies aimed at harvesting the <b>demographic</b> <b>dividends</b> quickly. By performing simulation analyses on total fertility rate (TFR) under two scenarios, it was shown that the Philippines can hardly experience in the near future the Goldilock period, or the generation when fertility rate is neither too high nor too low, especially when the government does nothing to address the problem. Under the business-as-usual scenario, the Goldilock period will be reached by year 2030, or twenty years from now. In the second scenario where the government intervention targets only the households with unwanted fertility, the Goldilock period will be achieved ten years earlier, or in about 2020. ...|$|R
40|$|Population ageing is a {{phenomenon}} affecting the whole world. The countries {{that make up the}} Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) are no exception but transitions in population ageing are still {{in the early stages of}} the process. With current <b>demographic</b> <b>dividends</b> experienced by the GCC and the rest of the Middle-East, the pace of population ageing will be faster than that experienced by many European countries. The purpose of this paper is to explore the population-ageing experience of different GCC countries while situating this within a context of social policies that are still at the very early stages of acknowledging such change. We use data from sources such as the United Nations and the World Bank, complemented by policy analysis of current age-related social security measures in the GCC. Given the importance of the family aged care system in the region, we consider the implications of changes in family structures, living conditions, and care needs for the elderly. The findings confirm the declining trend in fertility combined with increased life expectancy in all the six GCC countries. However, they highlight that social policy measures focused on older generations and their care needs are still relatively at the early stages of each country’s policy agenda. The implications of such changes are serious in terms of both the demand for and supply of care. Policymakers need to adopt cohesive social policy strategies that strengthen the complementing relationships between the state, family and wider community as stakeholders in the provision of aged care. In this study, elderly is defined as the proportion of the population aged 60 years and over...|$|R
50|$|Many Asian {{countries}} - {{mostly in}} East Asia and Southeast Asia - experienced a <b>demographic</b> <b>dividend</b> that boosted their economies {{during the past}} few decades. There is a widespread view that the South Asian countries are poised to benefit from a <b>demographic</b> <b>dividend</b> because their populations are young relative to the developed countries.

30|$|Resources, capital, {{and labor}} {{are the three}} key {{elements}} of economic growth. For the past three decades, China’s economic growth has {{been the result of}} <b>demographic</b> <b>dividends,</b> high saving rates, and large inputs of energy resources. Favorable demographics lasted only through the 1990 s. Thereafter, the demographic structure changed as growth of the working population slowed dramatically. In 2008, the contribution rate of labor to economic growth was more than three times less than in 1988 (Economy Research Project 2012). Nevertheless, China’s economy continued to grow at even a higher rate. In addition to increasing contributions of capital inputs, energy inputs also accounted for a larger share of growth. From 1990 to 2010, Chinese standard coal consumption increased by 2260 million tons. To be more specific, it grew by 469 million tons from 1991 to 2000 and by 1794 million tons between 2001 and 2010. The growth rates for these two decades were almost the same: 10.43  % for the first decade and 10.48  % for the second. But overall energy consumption during the decade from 2001 – 2010 was 3.6 times higher than the decade from 1991 – 2000. It {{is safe to say that}} the high growth rate from 2001 – 2010 is attributable to increased resource inputs. In 2011, China’s energy consumption per GDP unit was twice the world average, 2.4 times higher than in the USA, 3.7 times higher than in the European Union, 4.4 times higher than in Japan, and 1.1 times higher than in India. Those figures become 1.5 times, 2.1 times, 2.2 times, and 1.8 times if calculated based on Purchasing Power Parity (Wang 2012). In 2009, China’s economy accounted for around 8.5  % of the world economy, but for 45  % of coal and 10  % of oil and gas consumption.|$|R
40|$|The Asian {{economy is}} {{expected}} to realise favourable growth {{during the first half}} of this century, but there is no guarantee. There is a discussion about a ‘middle-income trap’, which refers to a country that has realised rapid growth to become a middle-income country but is unable to grow further. A middle-income trap could occur not only if there is a delay in shifting the economy toward a productivity-driven structure, but also if there is a worsening of income distribution. We consider this in line with the theories of development economics and through a quantitative analysis. The relationship between income inequality and the trap can be explained by the Kuznets hypothesis and the basic-needs approach. Our quantitative analysis supports the Kuznets hypothesis, and indicates that, although a low-income country can accelerate its economic growth with the worsening of income distribution as an engine, a middleincome country would experience a decreasing growth rate if it fails to narrow the income gap between the top and bottom income groups. The results also show that the basic-needs approach is also applicable in practice, and imply that the improvement of access to secondary education is important. A sensitivity analysis for three Asian upper-middle-income countries (China, Malaysia and Thailand) also shows that the situation related to a middle-income trap is worse than average in China and Malaysia. These two countries, according to the result of the sensitivity analysis, should urgently improve access to secondary education and should implement income redistribution measures to develop high-tech industries, before their <b>demographic</b> <b>dividends</b> expire. Income redistribution includes the narrowing of ruralurban income disparities, benefits to low-income individuals, direct income transfers, vouchers or free provision of education and health-care, and so on, but none of these are simple to implement...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Demographic</b> <b>dividend,</b> {{as defined}} by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFP) means, “the {{economic}} growth potential that can result from shifts in a population’s age structure, mainly when the share of the working-age population (15 to 64) is larger than the non-working-age share of the population (14 and younger, and 65 and older).” [...] In other words, it is “a boost in economic productivity that occurs when there are growing numbers of people in the workforce relative to the number of dependents.” [...] UNFPA stated that, “A country with both increasing numbers of young people and declining fertility has the potential to reap a <b>demographic</b> <b>dividend.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Africa, on {{the other}} hand has been unique demographically because {{fertility}} rates have remained relatively high, even as significant progress has been made decreasing the mortality rates. This has led to a continuing population explosion rather than a population boom and has contributed to the economic stagnation in much of Sub-Saharan Africa. The magnitude of the <b>demographic</b> <b>dividend</b> appears to be dependent on the ability of the economy to absorb and productively employ the extra workers, rather than be a pure demographic gift. According to the UN Population Fund, “If sub-Saharan African countries are able to repeat the East Asian experience, the region could realize a <b>demographic</b> <b>dividend</b> amounting to as much as $500 billion a year for 30 years.|$|E
50|$|However, this drop in {{fertility}} rates is not immediate. The lag between produces a generational population bulge that surges through society. For {{a period of}} time this “bulge” is a burden on society and increases the dependency ratio. Eventually this group begins to enter the productive labor force. With {{fertility rates}} continuing to fall and older generations having shorter life expectancies, the dependency ratio declines dramatically. This demographic shift initiates the <b>demographic</b> <b>dividend.</b> With fewer younger dependents, due to declining fertility and child mortality rates, and fewer older dependents, due to the older generations having shorter life expectancies, and the largest segment of the population of productive working age, the dependency ratio declines dramatically leading to the <b>demographic</b> <b>dividend.</b> Combined with effective public policies this time period of the <b>demographic</b> <b>dividend</b> can help facilitate more rapid economic growth and puts less strain on families. This is also a time period when many women enter the labor force for the first time. In many countries this time period has led to increasingly smaller families, rising income, and rising life expectancy rates. However, dramatic social changes can also occur during this time, such as increasing divorce rates, postponement of marriage, and single-person households.|$|E
