25|$|The new {{state-owned}} icebreaker generated widespread {{publicity and}} the <b>follow-up</b> <b>orders</b> allowed Wärtsilä {{to establish the}} Finnish shipbuilding industry as the world leader {{in the design and}} construction of icebreaking ships. After Voima, the shipyard delivered three icebreakers of similar design to the Soviet Union (Kapitan Belousov, Kapitan Voronin and Kapitan Melehov) and one for the Swedish Maritime Administration (Oden). By the late 1980s, Wärtsilä had produced about 60 percent of the worldwide icebreaker fleet, including all Finnish icebreakers in service at the time.|$|E
25|$|While the XC-123A {{proved too}} {{uneconomical}} for production, the XC-123 had greatly impressed the Air Force, which issued {{an order for}} five pre-production aircraft, designated C-123B. The prospect of large <b>follow-up</b> <b>orders,</b> however, raised an issue of capacity, as Chase's factory lacked sufficient space to construct large numbers of aircraft. Therefore, in 1951, 49 percent of Chase was purchased by Kaiser-Frazer, who received a contract for 300 C-123B aircraft to be constructed at Kaiser's Willow Run factory in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Chase became an engineering shop for the company, with Stroukoff remaining with the facility as its chief engineer.|$|E

[...] No other airline in North America flew turbo-prop airliners then, and no other British aircraft was bought by American airlines in such quantity." [...] TCA operated the Viscount for two decades until Air Canada (TCA relabelled with a name equally at home in English and French), ended Viscount services in 1974.

2500|$|For his daring role in {{the capture}} of Fort Henry, Phelps {{subsequently}} received much praise in the northern press. The New York Times exclaimed, [...] "Never has a more gallant officer trod a plank". Praise from The Cincinnati Gazette [...] went even further: [...] "The selection of Captain Phelps for this important expedition has proven {{one of the best}} that could have been made. …" [...] After the fall of Fort Henry, Foote, by order of General Grant, in turn ordered Phelps to proceed upriver with his fleet of timberclads and capture the strategically important Memphis & Charleston Railroad bridge. Here Phelps discovered the fleeing Confederates had obstructed the 1,200 foot long trestle. The bridge connected General Polk's army in Columbus and General Johnston's army in Bowling Green. However, the Union needed this bridge intact, so Phelps landed a party and began making repairs, which took no more than an hour. After receiving <b>follow-up</b> <b>orders,</b> however, Phelps had a small section of the bridge burned and destroyed some of the rails to prevent the Confederates from using it after they departed. Before leaving Phelps’ crews had captured supplies that were headed for Fort Henry.|$|E

50|$|The initial {{order was}} quickly {{followed}} by two <b>follow-up</b> <b>orders,</b> for the NR-2 and NR-3 models. The NR-2 was a military version of the Model 270 driver's cab and it differed in small details; this cab was used until {{the introduction of the}} open cabin. The British ordered 330 units of this model. In 1941 61 units of the NR-3 model were ordered; this was meant for long-distance transport in the Middle East by the logistics department of the British Army, the Royal Army Service Corps (RASC). The dimensions were 8.2 meters long, 2.6 meters wide and 2.5 meters high. The empty weight was 9.3 tons, and this version had a slightly different wheel size (11.00-24 front and 14.00-20 rear).|$|E
