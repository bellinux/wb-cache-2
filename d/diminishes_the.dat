5|$|The motor {{symptoms}} of PD {{are the result}} of reduced dopamine production in the brain's basal ganglia. Dopamine does not cross the blood-brain barrier, so it cannot be taken as a medicine to boost the brain's depleted levels of dopamine. However a precursor of dopamine, levodopa, can pass through to the brain where it is readily converted to dopamine, and administration of levodopa temporarily <b>diminishes</b> <b>the</b> motor {{symptoms of}} PD. Levodopa has been the most widely used PD treatment for over 40 years.|$|E
5|$|M. Daphne Kutzer, Professor of English at the State University of New York at Plattsburgh {{and author}} of Beatrix Potter: Writing in Code (2003), detects some {{similarities}} to The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin (1903). Both tales have touches of the pourquoi story in their explanations of why squirrels collect nuts, and both incorporate rhymes and riddles in their narratives. However, there is a crucial difference that <b>diminishes</b> <b>the</b> artistry of Timmy Tiptoes: the rhymes and riddles in Squirrel Nutkin shed light on Nutkin's character and create a guessing game for the reader while those in Timmy Tiptoes are bland devices that simply move the characters to reunions with their wives and the tale to its conclusion.|$|E

5|$|There are {{a number}} of views on the {{potential}} uses of Type I and II fluids. The use of Type I fluid raises concern because its holdover time is shorter than the holdover time for Type II fluid under certain conditions. Both fluids are under scrutiny for their environmental impacts, and it is uncertain if Type II fluid <b>diminishes</b> <b>the</b> runway coefficient of friction since the fluid rolls off the airplane during the takeoff roll. Also, the use of either type fluid may result in a temporary degradation in the airplane's aerodynamic performance, a reduced stall margin, and an increase in drag.|$|E
5|$|Of the {{globular}} clusters within the Milky Way, {{the majority are}} found in a halo around the galactic core, and the large majority {{are located in the}} celestial sky centered on the core. In 1918, this strongly asymmetrical distribution was used by Shapley to make a determination of the overall dimensions of the galaxy. By assuming a roughly spherical distribution of {{globular clusters}} around the galaxy's center, he used the positions of the clusters to estimate the position of the Sun relative to the galactic center. While his distance estimate was in significant error (although within the same order of magnitude as the currently accepted value), it did demonstrate that the dimensions of the galaxy were much greater than had been previously thought. His error was due to interstellar dust in the Milky Way, which absorbs and <b>diminishes</b> <b>the</b> amount of light from distant objects, such as globular clusters, that reaches the Earth, thus making them appear to be more distant than they are.|$|E
5|$|Since {{there is}} no way to reach N = 184 close to the magic proton shell, the main hope of {{reaching}} anywhere near this neutron number in fusion–evaporation reactions is via increasing the proton number past 118, but that also greatly <b>diminishes</b> <b>the</b> cross-sections and may not quite reach N = 184. Using newly available 251Cf targets and intense beams of 48Ca, 50Ti, 54Cr, and 58Fe would allow the production of the more neutron-rich 296Og, 300Ubn, 304Ubb, and 308Ubq, the latter three in the 1n channel that may be indicated by the low neutron binding energy of the compound nucleus 309Ubq* with N = 185 just above the closed shell. 308Ubq would reach the magic neutron number N = 184 and consequently have a higher cross-section for its production. Nevertheless, the growing importance of spontaneous fission as a decay mode over alpha decay in this region of the nuclide chart, as well as the short half-lives, may hamper the production of these nuclides even though they reach the closed neutron shell, and the feasibility of the 1n channel is also questionable. The most plausible way of reaching the centre of the island with current technology is to reach nuclides like 299Uue, 295Ts, and 295Lv whose alpha daughters are near enough to the island to undergo electron capture to add the necessary neutrons; nonetheless, the island is expected to be centred around copernicium, element 112, and thus this would not be of much help synthesising elements beyond 118.|$|E

25|$|Cyproterone is a steroidal {{antiandrogen}} that competitively inhibits {{the binding}} of testosterone or DHT to AR. Cyproterone binds to ARs that are expressed by prostate cancer cells {{as well as}} to the AR that are expressed in the hypothalamus and pituitary. Therefore, cyproterone blocks the negative feedback of androgens at the hypothalamic-pituitary level leading to increased luteinizing hormone (LH) serum levels.

Finally, the names for the Near Eastern domesticates imported into Egypt were not Sumerian or Proto-Semitic loan words, which further <b>diminishes</b> <b>the</b> likelihood of a mass immigrant colonization of lower Egypt during the transition to agriculture.|$|E
25|$|The UREX {{process is}} a PUREX process which has been {{modified}} to prevent the plutonium from being extracted.
