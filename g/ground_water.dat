However, the reported concentrations of dissolved oxygen become theoretically plausible upon consideration of the physical, chemical, and biological processes occurring within the water-soil-aquifer complex of the study area.

Disposal is managed by the Integrated Solid Waste Management project which was started by the GHMC in 2010. Rapid urbanisation and increased economic activity has also led to increased industrial waste, air, noise and water pollution, which is regulated by the Telangana Pollution Control Board (TPCB). The contribution of different sources to air pollution in 2006 was: 20–50% from vehicles, 40–70% {{from a combination of}} vehicle discharge and road dust, 10–30% from industrial discharges and 3–10% from the burning of household rubbish. Deaths resulting from atmospheric particulate matter are estimated at 1,700–3,000 each year. <b>Ground</b> <b>water</b> around Hyderabad, which has a hardness of up to 1000 ppm, around three times higher than is desirable, is the main source of drinking water but the increasing population and consequent increase in demand has led to a decline in not only <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> but also river and lake levels.

5|$|The {{species is}} almost totally {{restricted}} to the swales and lower slopes of dunes. Various reasons for this have been proposed; on the one hand, {{it has been argued}} that its dependence on <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> necessitates that it grow only where <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> is relatively near the surface; on the other hand, it has been suggested that it cannot survive in higher parts of the landscape because fires are too frequent there. The latter hypothesis is supported by the recent expansion of B.prionotes along road verges of the Brand Highway, where fires are relatively rare. Despite B.prionotes occurrence in lower parts of the landscape, it does not occur in areas prone to flooding, because of its intolerance of heavy soils, and because extended periods of flooding kill seedlings. However, recent falls of the water table on the Swan Coastal Plain have seen B.prionotes replace the more water-loving Banksia littoralis in some areas that were previously flood-prone.|$|E
