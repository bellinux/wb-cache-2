The only known sites for her mystery cult were in Italy, Greece, and Anatolia, although she was worshipped <b>in</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>every</b> province of the Roman Empire. In Egypt itself, only a few texts and images from the Roman period refer to the mysteries of Isis, {{and it is not}} certain that they were ever performed there.|$|E
5|$|In September 1919, the 29-year-old Macdonald began {{studying}} at Dalhousie Law School in Halifax. During his two years there, Macdonald formed lifelong friendships {{with students who}} were to become members of the political elite in the region. Once again, he excelled in athletics, {{was elected to the}} Dalhousie students' council, became the associate editor of the student newspaper and led the opposition in the law school's Mock Parliament. He scored firsts <b>in</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>every</b> course and graduated in 1921 with academic distinction.|$|E
5|$|Many {{organochlorine}} compounds {{have been}} isolated from natural sources ranging from bacteria to humans. Chlorinated organic compounds are found <b>in</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>every</b> class of biomolecules including alkaloids, terpenes, amino acids, flavonoids, steroids, and fatty acids. Organochlorides, including dioxins, are {{produced in the}} high temperature environment of forest fires, and dioxins {{have been found in}} the preserved ashes of lightning-ignited fires that predate synthetic dioxins. In addition, a variety of simple chlorinated hydrocarbons including dichloromethane, chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride have been isolated from marine algae. A majority of the chloromethane in the environment is produced naturally by biological decomposition, forest fires, and volcanoes.|$|E

5|$|Polychaetes occur {{throughout}} the Earth's oceans at all depths, from forms that live as plankton near the surface, to the deepest oceanic trenches. The robot ocean probe Nereus observed a 2–3cm specimen (still unclassified) of polychaete {{at the bottom}} of the Challenger Deep on 31 May 2009. There are more than 10,000 described species of polychaetes; they can be found <b>in</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>every</b> marine environment. Some species live in the coldest ocean temperatures of the hadal zone, while others can be found in the extremely hot waters adjacent to hydrothermal vents.|$|E
5|$|Tarbuck {{expected}} to become {{the head of a}} naval section within GHQ, but instead found himself part of Brigadier General Stephen J. Chamberlin G-3 Section, the staff section responsible for planning and operations. He found that more than forty naval officers were working at GHQ, but they were dispersed, working <b>in</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>every</b> corner of the staff. Tarbuck became head of a planning group known as the Red Team. This was one of three teams; there was also a White Team under a US army officer, Colonel Peyton, and a Blue Team under an Australian Army officer, Brigadier Tom White.|$|E
5|$|The direct {{precursor}} of dopamine, L-DOPA, can be synthesized indirectly from the {{essential amino acid}} phenylalanine or directly from the non-essential amino acid tyrosine. These amino acids are found <b>in</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>every</b> protein and so are readily available in food, with tyrosine being the most common. Although dopamine {{is also found in}} many types of food, it is incapable of crossing the blood–brain barrier that surrounds and protects the brain. It must therefore be synthesized inside the brain to perform its neuronal activity.|$|E

5|$|The two neurotransmitters {{that are}} used most widely in the {{vertebrate}} brain are glutamate, which almost always exerts excitatory effects on target neurons, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is almost always inhibitory. Neurons using these transmitters can be found <b>in</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>every</b> part of the brain. Because of their ubiquity, drugs that act on glutamate or GABA tend to have broad and powerful effects. Some general anesthetics act by reducing the effects of glutamate; most tranquilizers exert their sedative effects by enhancing the effects of GABA.|$|E
5|$|While {{serving in}} the Grenz {{infantry}} from the Croatian Military Frontier, Vukassovich received a coveted military award for notable actions in battle against the Ottomans. Still leading his Grenzers, he fought against the French in Italy. While still a colonel, he was entrusted with the command of an infantry brigade in early 1796. Finally appointed a general officer, he participated <b>in</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>every</b> battle in Italy that year, including all four Austrian attempts to raise the Siege of Mantua. In 1799, he led troops in Italy against the French with success. The following year saw him leading troops against Bonaparte again.|$|E
5|$|Geldray {{was born}} in the Netherlands and played jazz in England, Belgium, France and his home country, before {{settling}} in Britain at the outbreak of the Second World War; he was wounded during the Invasion of Normandy. He appeared <b>in</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>every</b> episode of The Goon Show, providing one of the musical interludes and the closing music for each programme. After The Goon Show series finished in 1960, he settled in the US, where he worked as an entertainer in the Reno casinos alongside the likes of Sarah Vaughan and Billy Daniels. Moving to Palm Springs, he eventually became a part-time counsellor at the Betty Ford Center. He was married twice and has one son. Geldray died in 2004 at the age of 88.|$|E

5|$|Neutopia {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as a clone of the popular Nintendo game The Legend of Zelda <b>in</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>every</b> aspect. Many reviewers have praised the game for making noticeable improvements over Zelda, but various shortcomings – which include long passwords, repetitive gameplay, and poor collision detection – prevent the game from being superior over the 1986 Nintendo title. But overall, reviewers have called Neutopia one of the better video games of its type and one of the better titles in the TurboGrafx-16 library. There would eventually be a sequel to the game NeutopiaII, in which Jazeta disappears and his son sets out to find him.|$|E
5|$|Spiders (order Araneae) are {{air-breathing}} arthropods {{that have}} eight legs and chelicerae with fangs that inject venom. They {{are the largest}} order of arachnids and rank seventh in total species diversity among all other orders of organisms. Spiders are found worldwide on every continent except for Antarctica, and have become established <b>in</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>every</b> habitat with the exceptions of air and sea colonization. , at least 45,700 spider species, and 113 families have been recorded by taxonomists. However, there has been dissension within the scientific community as to how all these families should be classified, {{as evidenced by the}} over 20 different classifications that have been proposed since 1900.|$|E
5|$|Tales of the undead {{consuming}} {{the blood}} or flesh of living beings {{have been found}} <b>in</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>every</b> culture {{around the world for}} many centuries. Today we know these entities predominantly as vampires, but in ancient times, the term vampire did not exist; blood drinking and similar activities were attributed to demons or spirits who would eat flesh and drink blood; even the devil was considered synonymous with the vampire. Almost every nation has associated blood drinking with some kind of revenant or demon, from the ghouls of Arabia to the goddess Sekhmet of Egypt. Indeed, some of these legends could have given rise to the European folklore, though they are not strictly considered vampires by historians when using today's definitions.|$|E

5|$|Vallée's movie {{garnered}} various {{awards and}} nominations following its release, with most nominations recognizing its costume design and Blunt's acting performance. The Young Victoria received three Academy Awards nominations; the ceremony saw costume designer Sandy Powell win her third Academy Award for Best Costume Design. At the 63rd British Academy Film Awards, The Young Victoria won both of its award categories, giving Powell and makeup artist Jenny Shircore their second BAFTAs, respectively. Powell won <b>in</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>every</b> category {{she received a}} nomination for.

5|$|Besides the {{theology}} espoused by their religious leaders, {{the people of}} Plymouth Colony had a strong belief in the supernatural. Richard Greenham was a Puritan theologian whose works were known to the Plymouth residents, and he counseled extensively against turning to magic or wizardry to solve problems. The Pilgrims saw Satan's work <b>in</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>every</b> calamity that befell them; the dark magical arts were very real and present for them. They believed {{in the presence of}} malevolent spirits who brought misfortune to people. For example, in 1660, a court inquest into the drowning death of Jeremiah Burroughs determined that a possessed canoe was to blame. Massachusetts Bay Colony experienced an outbreak of witchcraft scares in the 17th century, but {{there is little evidence that}} Plymouth was engulfed in anything similar. Witchcraft was listed as a capital crime in the 1636 codification of the laws by the Plymouth General Court, but there were no actual convictions of witches in Plymouth Colony. The court records only show two formal accusations of witchcraft. The first, of Goodwife Holmes in 1661, never went to trial. The second, of Mary Ingram in 1677, resulted in trial and acquittal.|$|E
5|$|Cabernet Sauvignon {{is grown}} <b>in</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>every</b> South American country {{including}} Chile, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Peru and Uruguay. In Chile, the wines were historically {{limited by the}} excessively high yields that were commonplace throughout the country. As producers begun to concentrate on limiting yields, regional differences began to emerge that distinguished Chilean Cabernets. For vineyard plantings along flat river valleys, the climate of the region {{is the most important}} consideration; as plantings move to higher elevations and along hillsides, soil type is a greater concern. The wines of the Aconcagua region are noted for their ripe fruit but closed, tight structure that needs some time in the bottle to develop. In the Maipo Valley, Cabernet Sauvignon wines are characterized by their pervasive blackcurrant fruit and an earthy, dusty note. In warmer regions, such as the Colchagua Province and around Curicó, the grapes ripen more fully; they produce wines with rich fruit flavors that can be perceived as sweet due to the ripeness of the fruit. The acidity levels of these wines will be lower and the tannins will also be softer, making the wines more approachable at a younger age.|$|E
