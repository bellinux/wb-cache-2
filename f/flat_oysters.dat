The study analyzed the prevalence relative to O. edulis density, biomass {{and a range of}} environmental parameters. Prevalence was greatest in the largest oysters and was higher in spring than in the autumn, perhaps because of the mortality of these shellfish during the summer.

50|$|While {{the oyster}} {{industry}} created wealth, it also suffered many setbacks and upheavals, {{as well as}} creating social inequalities. In 1885, some oyster farmers sought greater opportunities by immigrating to West Sayville, New York on Long Island, where wild oysters were once abundant. During the 20th century, further setbacks {{in the form of}} harsh winters, especially in 1963, and the threatened closing of the Eastern Scheldt by a dam almost led to the collapse of the oyster industry. After moderate recovery, the bacterium Bonamia ostreae infected the prevalent <b>flat</b> <b>oysters,</b> again decimating the industry in 1980. This led to the introduction of the Pacific Oyster, now the most cultivated oyster species, which some consider an invasive species.|$|E

40|$|Production of European <b>flat</b> <b>oysters</b> Ostrea edulis in the Netherlands {{has been}} {{hampered}} {{by the presence of}} the haplosporidian parasite Bonamia ostreae, which is now an enzootic species following its establishment after 1980. We analyzed histopathological data from annual shellfish disease monitoring from 1988 to 2006 to quantify prevalence of B. ostreae in flat oyster stocks of the marine Lake Grevelingen. In addition, we estimated prevalence of B. ostreae on a monthly basis with field surveys in 2003. The parasite was detected with PCR, using specific primers for B. ostreae. Prevalence of B. ostreae was analyzed relative to O. edulis density, biomass and a range of environmental parameters. B. ostreae was detected in <b>flat</b> <b>oysters</b> throughout the year with a higher prevalence in spring than in autumn, possibly due to termination of spawning and the onset of oyster growth in autumn. Although B. ostreae was detected in all oyster weight classes, prevalence was highest in the largest oysters in spring and declined disproportionately in autumn, possibly due to high mortality of large oysters before autumn, suggesting that prevalence depends on oyster age. Parasite prevalence was independent of oyster density and total biomass, but appeared to be higher after a warm autumn. Abundance of the flat oyster (infected or non-infected with B. ostreae) was negatively related to the temperature of the preceding period, suggesting that mortality in <b>flat</b> <b>oysters</b> increased at higher water temperatures. Furthermore, O. edulis appeared to be more susceptible to B. ostreae after years with lower food availability and lower salinities (< 29. 5). B. ostreae may weaken the competitive ability of O. edulis relative to the introduced Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas, particularly in years with high water temperatures. ...|$|E

The oyster farming is located 5 miles offshore in the east of Porto Levante (North-East Italy) in 25 metres of water. The lanterns are suspended 12 - 15 meters up from the bottom. The stocking density is 30 specimens per tray (300 specimens per lantern). The total stock is 100. 000 molluscs for a two year cycle of production. Oysters mortality during 1996 has been relatively low (10 %). In 1997 the mortality reached 60 % due to an algal bloom.

Examination with a binocular microscope revealed the holes of Anellida's penetration on the shell's outer surface.
