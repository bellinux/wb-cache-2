50|$|The {{original}} Fourdrinier <b>forming</b> <b>section</b> used {{a horizontal}} drainage area, {{referred to as}} the drainage table.|$|E
50|$|Many modern {{papermaking}} {{machines are}} based on the principles of the Fourdrinier Machine, which uses a specially woven plastic fabric mesh conveyor belt (known as a wire as it was once woven from bronze) in the <b>forming</b> <b>section,</b> where a slurry of fibre (usually wood or other vegetable fibres) is drained to create a continuous paper web. After the <b>forming</b> <b>section</b> the wet web passes through a press section to squeeze out excess water, then the pressed web passes through a heated drying section.|$|E

50|$|Another type <b>forming</b> <b>section</b> is the {{cylinder}} mould machine using a mesh-covered rotating cylinder partially {{immersed in a}} tank of fibre slurry in the wet end to form a paper web, giving a more random distribution of the cellulose fibres. Cylinder machines can form a sheet at higher consistency, which gives a more three dimensional fibre orientation than lower consistencies, resulting in higher calliper (thickness) and more stiffness in the machine direction (MD). High MD stiffness is useful in food packaging like cereal boxes and other boxes like dry laundry detergent.|$|E

40|$|This master thesis {{provides}} an overview of the paper machine with focus on the <b>forming</b> <b>section.</b> The <b>forming</b> <b>section</b> is the first part in the paper machine where the paper pulp is injected through a head box. The paper pulp contains about 99. 5 % of water and 0. 5 % fiber. The water as content is reduced by vacuum and gravity. The problem to be studied in this project is related to external rewetting. This is water going back to the paper web from the forming fabric after the dewatering zone. The dewatering is based on vacuum slots under the forming fabric. The vacuum slots absorb water from the soaked paper pulp through the forming fabric. External rewetting causes problem, hence the paper will have a higher dry content when leaving the <b>forming</b> <b>section.</b> The paper should have as low dry content as possible in the end of the <b>forming</b> <b>section.</b> Three different forming fabrics from Albany International were chosen for the project. The structures of the forming fabrics were two different double layers and one plain weave. The performance of the fabrics was studied by 4 different methods. The methods used were 2 different wicking tests, a vacuum dewatering trial and one foulard test. Also micro tomography was done to understand the structure of each design. The main test was a foulard test where the aim was to see in what way the rewetting got affected by different pores sizes. The results showed higher water content for the paper that was on top of the forming fabric with the larger pores...|$|E

30|$|Both fiber {{orientation}} and fiber flocculation are characteristic fluid dynamical phenomena of fiber suspension flows at low {{concentrations in the}} headbox and the <b>forming</b> <b>section.</b> The main purpose of a headbox {{is to create a}} thin and even jet which then enters the <b>forming</b> <b>section.</b> In the headbox, the suspension is mixed in the turbulence generator and then accelerated in the contracting slice channel. After the slice opening, the jet enters into free air and hits the moving fabrics called “wires”, where the water removal and the formation of the fiber network are initiated. Subsequent water removal processes by pressing and drying make paper more solid, but the basic fibrous structure of paper does not change noticeably.|$|E

40|$|The {{underlying}} {{motives of}} the research undertaken here are twofold: to obtain {{a deeper understanding of}} the dewatering mechanisms at the <b>forming</b> <b>section</b> of a papermaking machine and to develop numerical models that describe the flow through forming fabrics. More comprehensive knowledge of dewatering in the <b>forming</b> <b>section</b> allows suggestions to be made for improvements that reduce the amount of energy used in the process without affecting the quality of the end product.   The objective of this thesis is to answer the following questions: How and why does rewetting occur at the high vacuum suction boxes? How does the structure of the forming fabric affect dewatering at the <b>forming</b> <b>section?</b> Is it possible to create accurate numerical models for forming fabrics, and can these be used to predict the dewatering behaviour of new types of fabrics?   Laboratory and pilot studies simulating high vacuum suction boxes were performed together with numerical modelling of the flow of air and water through both the forming fabric and the paper sheet.   The conclusion drawn from the pilot study is that rewetting significantly lowers the dryness of the paper sheet exiting the suction boxes. The phenomenon is extremely rapid and is most likely driven by capillary forces. The high speed at which this rewetting occurs makes it difficult to impede by placing the suction boxes closer to the couch pick-up: the solution is more likely to be the use of new and improved designs of the forming fabric. The structure of the forming fabric has been shown to affect the dewatering rate at certain conditions of vacuum dewatering, and can possibly be connected partly to the fact that fibres penetrate the surface of the fabric to varying degrees and partly to the flow resistance of the different fabric structures. Numerical models of high accuracy can be constructed and used to predetermine how new fabric designs would affect dewatering at the <b>forming</b> <b>section.</b>   This thesis quantifies aspects of dewatering such as rewetting and the influence of the forming fabric. Understanding these dewatering aspects further provides for the potential enhancement of energy efficiency in the <b>forming</b> <b>section,</b> and thereby the entire papermaking process. The forming fabric can play an important role in improving energy efficiency: rewetting after the high vacuum suction boxes occurs more rapidly than was previously known, so its design might be the only possible way of impeding it. The forming fabric can also improve the rate of dewatering: it is therefore likely that its design will be important in the next stage of developing energy efficiency and thereby play a part in achieving a more sustainable future.

40|$|Papermaking {{is known}} as an energy-intensive, but not always {{efficient}} industry. This is at least {{partly due to the}} fact that the majority of papermaking technologies and procedures were established at a time when energy was both cheap and plentiful. A considerable fraction of the energy required for papermaking is consumed in removing water by the use of steam in the paper machine’s drying section. It is also known that even a small reduction in steam use can result in a significant reduction in production costs and environmental effects. To date, a great deal of research has been undertaken, aimed at improving the performance of the drying section by making more efficient use of dryer steam. This paper investigates a new approach to reducing thermal energy use in paper making by seeking to enhance the amount of water removed in sections of the machine prior to the drying section. The proposed method is focused on sequential modelling of the effect of vacuums used in the <b>forming</b> <b>section</b> on the thermal energy consumption in the drying section. The primary models explain how different vacuum pressures can affect the flow of water from the sheet in the <b>forming</b> <b>section</b> whilst the secondary models describe the effect of increased drainage on the steam requirements in the dryer. Operational data from a UK paper mill are used to illustrate the proposed method. The models developed can have subsequent application to optimising the use of thermal energy in paper making...|$|E

40|$|We are {{developing}} an intelligent, vision-based apparatus {{for the paper}} industry, {{who has had a}} long-standing need to better understand and to robustly control its papermaking process up-stream, specifically, in the <b>forming</b> <b>section.</b> This unique apparatus is a state-of-the-art vision system that automatically measures and interprets the pertinent paper web parameters at the wet end. Unlike the currently available sensing systems that are intended to operate down-stream, our vision system provides the capability of generating timely measurements of the important web parameters at the crucial stage of paper formation. Having the capability can create both short- term and long-term changes in the paper industry ad can dramatically impact product quality and production yield. In the short term, the ability to characterize the web at the wet end will provide the machine operators with the necessary feedback they need to make definitive adjustments to the headbox design and control as their researchers use this same capability to better understand and quantify the headbox flow dynamics...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{industry}} {{has long had}} a need to better understand and control its papermaking process upstream, specifically at the wet end in the <b>forming</b> <b>section</b> of a paper machine. A vision-based system is under development that addresses this need by automatically measuring and interpreting the pertinent paper web parameters at the wet end in real time. The wet-end characterization of the paper web by a vision system involves a four-dimensional measurement of the slurry in real time. These measurements include the two-dimensional spatial information, the intensity profile, and the depth profile. This paper describes the real-time depth profile measurement system for the high-speed moving slurry. A laser line-based measurement method is used with a high-speed programmable camera to directly measure slurry height. The camera is programmed with a profile algorithm, producing depth data at fast sampling rates. Analysis and experimentation have been conducted to optimize the system for {{the characteristics of the}} slurry and laser line image. On-line experimental results are presented...|$|E
