5|$|A {{number of}} Anglo-Saxon {{charters}} document {{the incorporation of}} areas of moor in estates, suggested that the area continued to be exploited. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> why the area acquired a number of legends, particularly of King Arthur and his followers, who some believe based his court in the hill fort at South Cadbury. According to legend, Alfred the Great burnt cakes when hiding in the marshes of Athelney, after the Danish invasion in 875. After the battle of Edington the Danish king was baptised at Aller and a peace treaty signed at Wedmore.|$|E

25|$|If p is an {{isolated}} {{point in the}} Stone space, i.e. if {p} is an open set, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that every model realizes p (at least if the theory is complete). The omitting types theorem says that conversely if p is not isolated {{then there is a}} countable model omitting p (provided that the language is countable).|$|E

25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{that the}} steps in the tree {{preserve}} the semantic truth value of the formulas implied by them, with conjunction understood between the tree's different branches whenever there is a split. It is also obvious that an axiom is provable {{if and only if}} it is true for every truth values of the atomic symbols. Thus this system is sound and complete in propositional logic.|$|E
25|$|A graph H {{is called}} a topological minor of a graph G if a {{subdivision}} of H is isomorphic to a subgraph of G. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that every topological minor is also a minor. The converse however is not true in general (for instance the complete graph K5 in the Petersen graph is a minor but not a topological one), but holds for graph with maximum degree not greater than three.|$|E
25|$|This {{problem is}} known to be NP-complete. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that the problem is in NP: a yes answer is easy to prove by {{presenting}} a large enough cut. The NP-completeness of the problem can be shown, for example, by a transformation from maximum 2-satisfiability (a restriction of the maximum satisfiability problem). The weighted version of the decision problem was one of Karp's 21 NP-complete problems; Karp showed the NP-completeness by a reduction from the partition problem.|$|E

25|$|These results contain several notable special cases. For example, {{the problem}} of {{computing}} the partition function of the Ising model is #P-hard in general, even though celebrated algorithms of Onsager and Fisher solve it for planar lattices. Also, the Jones polynomial is #P-hard to compute. Finally, computing the number of four-colourings of a planar graph is #P-complete, even though the decision problem is trivial by the four colour theorem. In contrast, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that {{counting the number of}} three-colourings for planar graphs is #P-complete because the decision problem is known to be NP-complete via a parsimonious reduction.|$|E
25|$|A recent {{newspaper}} article by the Toronto Star states that everyone to sing, {{even if they}} are not musically talented, because of the benefits it has for the health of the individual. Singing lowers blood pressure by releasing pent up emotions, boosting relaxation and reminding them of happy times. It also allows singers to breathe more easily. Patients with lung disease and chronic pulmonary disease experience relief from their symptoms from singing just two times a week. In addition to breathing related illness, singing also has numerous benefits for stroke victims when it comes to relearning the ability to speak and communicate by singing their thoughts. Singing activates {{the right side of the}} brain when the left side cannot function (the left side is the area of the brain responsible for speech), so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how singing can be an excellent alternative to speech while the victim heals.|$|E
25|$|Internet {{connectivity}} also varies {{a lot by}} State. In 2011, the US Census Bureau {{conducted a}} survey to determine internet access in each State. New Hampshire reported {{the highest rate of}} Internet access, with only 20.3% reporting no internet access at home or elsewhere. Mississippi reported the lowest rate of access, with 41.0% of people reporting no internet access at home or elsewhere. As a general trend <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that Appalachian and Southern States in general have a much lower rate of Internet usage when compared to other regions. This correlates greatly with the average income of those states. Lower income states reporting lower rates of usage, and higher income states reporting higher rates of connectivity. Also it may be a matter of population density. There are a lot more disconnected individuals in states with many counties of low population density. This could be because Internet Service Providers are less likely to make a profit in these areas.|$|E

25|$|Intuitively, {{imagine that}} {{we wish to}} {{transmit}} sequences comprising the 4 characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'D'. Thus, a message to be transmitted might be 'ABADDCAB'. Information theory gives a way of calculating the smallest possible amount of information that will convey this. If all 4 letters are equally likely (25%), we can do no better (over a binary channel) than to have 2 bits encode (in binary) each letter: 'A' might code as '00', 'B' as '01', 'C' as '10', and 'D' as '11'. Now suppose 'A' occurs with 70% probability, 'B' with 26%, and 'C' and 'D' with 2% each. We could assign variable length codes, so that receiving a '1' tells {{us to look at}} another bit unless we have already received 2 bits of sequential 1s. In this case, 'A' would be coded as '0' (one bit), 'B' as '10', and 'C' and 'D' as '110' and '111'. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that 70% of the time only one bit needs to be sent, 26% of the time two bits, and only 4% of the time 3 bits. On average, then, fewer than 2 bits are required since the entropy is lower (owing to the high prevalence of 'A' followed by 'B' – together 96% of characters). The calculation of the sum of probability-weighted log probabilities measures and captures this effect.|$|E

500|$|Building and {{enlarging}} the islands, {{along with the}} new Concorde Bridge built to connect them with the site-specific mass transit system known as the Montreal Expo Express, plus a boat pier, cost more than the Saint Lawrence Seaway project did only five years earlier: this was even before any buildings or infrastructure were constructed. [...] With the initial phase of construction completed, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> why the budget for the exhibition {{was going to be}} larger than anyone expected. In the fall of 1963, Expo's general manager, Andrew Kniewasser, presented the master plan and the preliminary budget of $167 million for construction: it would balloon to over $439 million by 1967. The plan and budget narrowly passed a vote in Pearson's federal cabinet, passing by one vote, and then it was officially submitted on December 23, 1963.|$|E

In April 2014 she gave concert performances in Australia.

Whatever the case, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> and hear why, for 30 years, Bernadette Peters has probably been musical theatre's finest performer. ... She even breathed new life into 'Send In the Clowns'. ... Rather than make it emotionally swollen (as so many do), Peters contracted it, delicately squeezing out its essence like toothpaste from a near-empty tube."

[...] It insults kids to suggest that simply watching Characters Behaving Badly onscreen means they'll take that as permission to do the same themselves.
