It provides {{estimates of the}} real equilibrium exchange rate based on a sample of 80 countries, and estimates well {{the dynamics of the}} real exchange rate in the early transition phase. The results suggest that the continuing real appreciation corresponds to a combination of a return to equilibrium following an initial overshooting, and of real equilibrium appreciation. ...|$|E
40|$|Airport noise {{nuisance}} {{is a negative}} externality especially when it occurring near urban areas. Like all externalities, {{noise nuisance}} may be a reason for government intervention. When intervening, governments should set quantitative policy targets with care. In practice, this issue is generally neglected. This line of research sets the first step towards determining optimal policy targets {{in the case of}} noise nuisance near airports, more specifically in the case of Amsterdam Airport. We use hedonic pricing to establish the benefits of noise reduction. Furthermore, we develop a bottom-up cost function to analyze the costs of reducing noise for airlines. We then equate marginal costs and benefits to establish the optimal level of noise reduction, which appears to be 3 dB in the case of Amsterdam Airport. Welfare increasing measures include alternative approach procedures, regional substitution of planes within existing fleets and <b>early</b> <b>depreciation</b> of noisy planes increase welfare. Reducing the number of flights has a negative effect on net welfare. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|On {{first of}} January 2009, the Euro’s tenth {{birthday}} can be celebrated. The {{introduction of the}} Euro led to diminishing importance of trade in foreign currency for the Euro-countries. However, {{a significant part of}} foreign trade of Germany and other Euro-members is still nominated in foreign currency. Therefore, the external value of the Euro plays a crucial role for the European economy. Since the <b>early</b> <b>depreciation</b> of the exchange rate just after the introduction until 2000, an almost steady increase in the external value of the Euro could be observed. The contribution elaborates on the exchange rate development and tests whether the Euro was following a path as it would be predicted by both, the interest rate parity theory and the purchasing parity theory. Both theoretical approaches are not able to explain the specific valuation figure of the Euro. For the conduct of economic forecasts, it is to conclude that modelling exchange rate developments as random processes can be legitimate. Regarding exchange rate policy, it remains to ask which alternative policy approaches might be better suitable for the European economy. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{questions}} some widespread {{concerns about}} Australia’s current account deficit, including {{the level of}} absorption and external debt. Influences on the external accounts which lie beyond effective policy control in the short run, viz. the terms of trade and the “valuation” effect of <b>earlier</b> <b>depreciations,</b> are shown {{to have been the}} main factors widening the deficit over recent years. With the terms of trade fluctuating sharply, the exchange rate should be allowed to float more freely to bring about the necessary restructuring of the economy. A macroeconomic policy response directed toward the current account imbalance per se is reminiscent of mercantilism and seems misplaced in the light of Australia’s dependence on capital imports. “… the mechanism of foreign trade is self adjusting and attempts to interfere with it are not only futile, but greatly impoverish those who practise them …” [Keynes (1936) p. 333]. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper characterizes {{monetary}} and exchange-rate policies during successful and unsuccessful fiscal adjustments {{by analyzing the}} OECD economies over the period 1970 to 1998. We find that successful adjustments are almost always preceded by large nominal and real exchange rate depreciations while unsuccessful adjustments are preceded by revaluations and followed by depreciations. The extreme adjustments of Ireland and Denmark in the 1990 s fit this pattern of depreciation for success very closely. <b>Early</b> <b>depreciation</b> is a significant and quantitatively important predictor of the persistence of adjustment: each 1 percent of depreciation {{in the two years}} preceding a fiscal adjustment leads to approximately 2 percent increase in the probability of success. Since the size of the typical pre-adjustment depreciation is 5 %, this is an important effect. When compared to an indicator of the composition of the fiscal adjustment, the reliance on spending cuts, the two variables have similar quantitative impacts on the likelihood of persistence. Our results are robust to alternative definitions of the depreciation period, the persistence of the adjustment, and whether we use effective, DM or US$ exchange rates. Monetary policy does not {{play a significant role in}} fiscal adjustments. Our results suggest that attaining persistent fiscal adjustment within EMU is likely to become a more "costly" endeavor than it was beforehand, as EMU members have adopted a single currency and therefore abandoned the use of exchange rate policies vis [...] vis each other.

40|$|Abstract: Why is {{the price}} of renting an {{automobile}} “flat ” as a function its age or odometer? Specifically, why don’t rental car companies offer customers the option of renting older cars at a discount, instead of offering only relatively new cars at full price? We also consider a related puzzle: why do rental car companies trade their vehicles so quickly? Most U. S. companies purchase brand new rental cars and replace them after 2 years or when their odometer exceeds 34, 000 kilometers (km). This is a very costly strategy due to the well known rapid <b>early</b> <b>depreciation</b> in used car prices. We show that economic theory predicts that in a competitive market cars are rented over their full economic lifespan and rental prices are a declining function of their odometer value. Our solution to these puzzles is that actual rental markets are not fully competitive and firms may be behaving suboptimally. We provide a case study of a large rental car company that provided us access to its operating data. We develop a model of the company’s operations that predicts that the company can significantly increase its profits by keeping its rental cars twice as long as it currently does and discounting the rental prices of older vehicles to induce its customers to rent them. The company undertook an experiment to test our model’s predictions. We report initial findings from this experiment, which involved over 4500 rentals of over 500 cars in 4 locations over a 5 month period. The results are consistent with the predictions of our model, and suggest that a properly chosen declining rental price function can increase overall revenues. Profits also increase significantly, since doubling the holding period of rental cars cuts discounted replacement costs by nearly 40 %...|$|E

I. BRAZIL’S MACROECONOMIC POLICY AT A CROSSROADS Taking office in January 2003, President Lula da Silva inherited a difficult eco-nomic situation marked by great uncertainty following the financial crisis of 2002. Fortunately, {{in the first six}} months of the new president’s term, financial markets have responded positively. The Real has rebounded from its crisis overshoot, and the strength of Brazil’s currency and stock market is being interpreted as a sign that current macroeconomic policy is working. To some, the implication is that Brazil only needs to stay the course with its existing regime of tight money. This paper argues that this position is mistaken, and that the existing policy configuration cannot achieve economic growth. At best, it can ensure financial sta-bility. However, more likely, it will result in stagnation that is ultimately joined by renewed financial crisis. Instead, Brazil must adopt a new monetary policy mix that enables it to escape the debt constraint on growth. Analytically, this constraint can be understood through the highly indebted developing country trilemma which ha...|$|R
40|$|Both {{the size}} and the {{persistence}} of inflation differentials in the euro area {{have been the subject}} of a large number of studies in recent years. These studies have tried to determine the causes of these differentials as well as their implications not only for the implementation of the common monetary policy but also in terms of the macroeconomic policies needed at the country level. Indeed, since the start of Stage Three of the EMU, countries can no longer correct country-specific imbalances or idiosyncratic shocks through changing their national monetary policy stance. As a consequence, it may be deemed fit, in some cases, to take appropriate policy measures aimed at reducing inflation differentials. The article tackles the case of Belgium, in which country the inflation differentials vis-à-vis the euro area appear to be relatively small and do not seem to show any persistence or any systematic upward or downward bias. However, empirical studies based on the “Balassa-Samuelson” theory have concluded that Belgium should be prone to a relatively high inflation rate. This theory holds that, on restrictive assumptions, a real appreciation (or positive inflation differential) is generated in countries showing the most rapid growth of the productivity differential between the traded and non-traded goods sectors. The article goes into those rather surprising results. The authors observed a pronounced increase of relative productivity in Belgium and a strong positive correlation between relative productivity and relative prices, measured by the value added deflator, which proves to be consistent with the theory and the results of previous studies. These studies have typically assumed that the tradable sector showed purchasing power parity. In that case, the pronounced increase in relative prices has strong implications for the real exchange rate (or inflation differentials). However, the authors found empirical evidence against this hypothesis in the Belgian case. Indeed, the real exchange rate in the tradable sector depreciated strongly in the seventies and the <b>early</b> eighties. This <b>depreciation</b> in the tradable sector offset the impact of the positive relative price differential, causing the real exchange rate for the economy as a whole to be relatively stable. Belgium should therefore not be an economy prone to high inflation. As the HICP is the main indicator monitored by the European monetary authorities, it was important to examine whether such conclusions could also be drawn for the consumer price index. The authors found similar results, namely a stable real exchange rate for the Belgian economy as a whole during the period under review and, therefore, the absence of any structural reason for inflation to be systematically higher in Belgium. It may thus be concluded that significant and persistent inflation differentials between Belgium and the euro area or a systematic bias in any particular direction are unlikely and, therefore, that the European monetary policy is appropriate for the Belgian economy in the current environment.

40|$|Highlights Despite some {{lingering}} uncertainties on {{the global}} scene, developments since the May 1999 Monetary Policy Report {{have resulted in a}} firmer tone in the outlook for the world economy and for Canada. The Canadian economy now appears poised to attain growth in 1999 towards {{the upper end of the}} 2 3 / 4 to 3 3 / 4 per cent range set out in the May Report. Trend inflation is still expected to edge up but to remain in the lower half of the Bank's inflation-control target range of 1 to 3 per cent. Information received since early July, when the update to the Monetary Policy Report was completed, continues to point to a generally firmer tone in the outlook for the world economy and for Canada. Nonetheless, lingering uncertainties {{on the global}} scene bear watching. In Japan, there are signs that the protracted economic recession may be coming to an end. In Europe, expectations of a pickup in the pace of expansion as the year progresses are becoming more widely held. Economic and financial conditions remain generally positive in those emerging-market economies in Southeast Asia and Latin America that are vigorously pursuing sound domestic policies. In the United States, real GDP rose by an estimated 2. 3 per cent in the second quarter-below most expectations. A significant part of the slowdown, however, was attributable to a major inventory adjustment. Growth of real final domestic demand also decelerated, but remained strong at just under 4 per cent, following growth of over 6 per cent in the twoprevious quarters. Overall, the U. S. economy continues to operate at high levels, thereby heightening concerns about potential inflationary pressures. While inflation at both the retail and producer-price levels appears to be contained, with tight labour markets (employment was up strongly in July) signs of cost pressures have emerged recently, reflecting rising rates of labour compensation and slowing productivity growth. Here in Canada, indicators of domestic demand such as retail and wholesale trade, motor vehicle sales, housing activity, imports, and business investment plans all support a picture of solid expansion through the spring and summer months. Exports, after several quarters of very strong growth, remain at high levels, and economy-wide production data (e. g., monthly GDP at factor cost) through May also indicate a steady, solid pace of expansion. Moreover, world commodity prices have risen somewhat further recently, providing support to Canadaís resource sector. The prices of some key primary commodities produced in Canada (especially energy and base metals) have been among the fastest rising. And as anticipated, there was renewed employment growth in July, notably in full-time, paid jobs. On balance, recent data suggest that real GDP increased by about 3 1 / 2 per cent (annual rate) in the second quarter-broadly in line with expectations at the time of the July update. The 12 -month rate of increase in the core CPI edged up to 1. 7 per cent in June. As in the previous twomonths, the June increase was slightly higher than expected. This is partly because of the more rapid pass-through of the <b>earlier</b> exchange rate <b>depreciation</b> into retail prices. However, with slack still present in the economy, core inflation is expected to remain close to current levels, below the midpoint of the Bank's 1 to 3 per cent target range, through the balance of 1999. Uncertainty about inflationary pressures in the United States and the possible implications for the stance of U. S. monetary policy, as well as shifts in international investment portfolios (encouraged by improving economic conditions overseas), have resulted in significant movements in financial markets in recent weeks. In July, the U. S. dollar weakened markedly against both the yen and the euro. While the Canadian dollar was softer against its U. S. counterpart for much of the last month, it has strengthened recently, supported by Canadaís low inflation and solid economic expansion and by firmer world commodity prices. Interest rates in Canada remain below those in the United States across all maturities, although the differentials have narrowed since early July. ...|$|R
