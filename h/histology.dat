40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to review {{institutional}} outcomes for advanced thyroid cancers treated with fast neutron radiation therapy (FNRT) and photon radiation therapy (RT). Methods and materials: In all, 62 consecutive patients were analyzed. Fifty-nine had stage IV disease. Twenty-three were treated with FNRT and 39 with photon RT. Median follow-up was 14 months. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Results: There was no significant difference in median OS between FNRT and photon RT (26 vs 16 months; P =. 49). Patients with well-differentiated <b>histologies</b> had superior median OS with photon RT (17 vs 69 months; P =. 04). There was a nonsignificant trend toward improved OS with FNRT for medullary and anaplastic <b>histologies.</b> Conclusions: Outcomes in this study are in line with historical results. There is an apparent detriment in OS with FNRT for well-differentiated <b>histologies</b> and a trend toward improved OS with medullary and anaplastic <b>histologies</b> that warrants further investigation...|$|R

40|$|Background and {{objective}} Different <b>histologies</b> {{of lung cancer}} vary in occurrence and prognosis. This study aims to analyze the incidence and occurrence trend of lung cancer and investigate the survival rate and its influential factors among lung cancer patients with different <b>histologies.</b> Methods Permanent residents were recruited between 2002 and 2009 in Pudong New Area (former Nanhui Area and former Pudong Area), Shanghai, China. Annual percent changes were estimated by a linear regression of the logarithm on the incidence rates for eight years. Survival rates were calculated and compared by using life-table analysis and Log-rank test, respectively. Results The standardized incidence rates of lung cancer were 52. 28 and 18. 86 per 100, 000 in males and females, respectively. The median survival time was 410. 72 days for specific classified lung cancer. The incidence rates of adenocarcinoma ranked the highest and showed an upward tendency (P< 0. 05). Patients with small cell lung cancer showed the worst survival condition. The survival condition in males with squamous cell lung cancer living in former Nanhui Area was better compared with those living in former Pudong Area.

5|$|A 2017 study {{examined}} the <b>histology</b> of thin-sectioned dodo bones, modern Mauritian birds, local ecology, and contemporary accounts, to recover information about the life history of the dodo. The study suggested that dodos bred around August, after having potentially fattened themselves, corresponding with the fat and thin cycles of many vertebrates of Mauritius. The chicks grew rapidly, reaching robust, almost adult, sizes, and sexual maturity before Austral summer or the cyclone season. Adult dodos which had just bred moulted after Austral summer, around March. The feathers of the wings and tail were replaced first, and the moulting would have completed {{at the end of}} July, in time for the next breeding season. Different stages of moulting may also account for inconsistencies in contemporary descriptions of dodo plumage.|$|E

40|$|The {{degree of}} histologic {{cellular}} differentiation of a cancer {{has been associated}} with prognosis but is subjectively assessed. We hypothesized that information about tumor differentiation of individual cancers could be derived objectively from cancer gene expression data, and would allow creation of a cancer phylogenetic framework that would correlate with clinical, histologic and molecular characteristics of the cancers, as well as predict prognosis. Here we utilized mRNA expression data from 4, 413 patient samples with 7 diverse cancer <b>histologies</b> to explore the utility of ordering samples by their distance in gene expression from that of stem cells. A differentiation baseline was obtained by including expression data of human embryonic stem cells (hESC) and human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) for solid tumors, and of hESC and CD 34 + cells for liquid tumors. We found that the correlation distance (the degree of similarity) between the gene expression profile of a tumor sample and that of stem cells orients cancers in a clinically coherent fashion. For all <b>histologies</b> analyzed (including carcinomas, sarcomas, and hematologic malignancies), patients with cancers with gene expression patterns most similar to that of stem cells had poorer overall survival. We also found that the genes in all undifferentiated cancers of diverse <b>histologies</b> that were most differentially expressed were associated with up-regulation of specific oncogenes and down-regulation of specific tumor suppressor genes. Thus, a stem cell-oriented phylogeny of cancers allows for the derivation of a novel cancer gene expression signature found in all undifferentiated forms of diverse cancer <b>histologies,</b> that is competitive in predicting overall survival in cancer patients compared to previously published prediction models, and is coherent in that gene expression was associated with up-regulation of specific oncogenes and down-regulation of specific tumor suppressor genes associated with regulation of the multicellular state...|$|R
40|$|Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), {{the most}} common soft-tissue sarcoma in children, is cured with {{conventional}} therapy in 70 %. However, the 5 -year survival for those who relapse is about 30 %, and drops to about 15 % for those with unfavorable <b>histologies</b> (alveolar/undifferentiated subtypes). We describe outcomes of 62 subjects receiving autologous blood/bone marrow (BM) transplants for RMS between 1989 and 2003, and reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplantation Research (CIBMTR). Histologic subtype was confirmed by reviewing pathology reports. Treatment-related mortality (TRM), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were evaluated. Overall, 73 % of subjects were 5 cm, 63 % had metastasis at diagnosis, 55 % had unfavorable <b>histologies,</b> 92 % had cancer responsive to chemotherapy pretransplant, and 67 % were in first remission. The 1 -year TRM was 5 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 1 %- 12 %) and the 5 -year PFS and OS were 29 % (95 % CI, 18 %- 41 %) and 32 % (95 % CI, 21 %- 44 %), respectively. There was only a 4 % relapse rate after the first year. There were no differences in 5 -year PFS or survival based on histological subtype, transplant in first remission versus relapse (36 % versus 29 %; P =. 5), or transplantation for poor-risk <b>histologies</b> in first remission versus relapse (34 % versus 33 %; P =. 9). Our data indicate that autotransplants for RMS disease are typically done in patients with disease responsive to chemotherapy pretransplant, with approximately one-third long-term survivors. Despite high-risk factors, we also found a low TRM, perhaps reflecting the migration from marrow to blood stem cells as the graft source. Even when performed after relapse for alveolar/undifferentiated <b>histologies,</b> long-term survivals were seen seemingly better than results with conventional therapies...|$|R

5|$|The ribs were {{connected}} to the dorsal (trunk) vertebrae with two joints, acting together as a simple hinge joint, which has allowed researchers to reconstruct the inhaled and exhaled positions of the ribcage. The difference in volume between these two positions defines the air exchange volume (the amount of air moved with each breath), determined to be approximately 20L for a P.engelhardti individual estimated to have weighed690kg, or 29mL/kg bodyweight. This is a typical value for birds, but not for mammals, and indicates that Plateosaurus probably had an avian-style flow-through lung, although indicators for postcranial pneumaticity (air sacs of the lung invading the bones to reduce weight) {{can be found on}} the bones of only a few individuals, and were only recognized in 2010. Combined with evidence from bone <b>histology</b> this indicates that Plateosaurus was endothermic.|$|E

Erickson only examined Daspletosaurus from the Dinosaur Park Formation, but these specimens show the same pattern. Compared to albertosaurines, Daspletosaurus showed a faster growth rate during the rapid growth period due to its higher adult weight. The maximum growth rate in Daspletosaurus was 180kilograms (400lb) per year, based on a mass estimate of 1800kilograms (2tons) in adults.
