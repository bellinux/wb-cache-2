40|$|PURPOSE: To {{verify the}} {{predictors}} of intravasation rate during hysteroscopy. METHODS: Prospective observational study (Canadian Task Force classification II- 1). All cases (n= 200 women; 22 to 86 years old) were treated in an operating room setting. Considering respective bag overfill to calculate water balance, we tested two {{multiple linear regression}} models: one for total intravasation (mL) {{and the other for}} absorption rate (mL. min- 1). The predictors tested (independent variables) were energy (mono/bipolar), tube patency (with/without tubal ligation), <b>hysterometry</b> (cm), age&# 8804; 50 years, body surface area (m 2), surgical complexity (with/without myomectomy) and duration (min). RESULTS: Mean intravasation was significantly higher when myomectomy was performed (442 ± 616 versus 223 ± 332 mL; p< 0. 01). In the proposed multiple linear regression models for total intravasation (adjusted R 2 = 0. 44; p< 0. 01), the only significant predictors were myomectomy and duration (p< 0. 01). In the proposed model for intravasation rate (R 2 = 0. 39; p< 0. 01), only myomectomy and <b>hysterometry</b> were significant predictors (p= 0. 02 and p< 0. 01, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Not only myomectomy but also <b>hysterometry</b> were significant predictors of intravasation rate during operative hysteroscopy...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} the uterus to {{contract}} in response to mechanical distension has been utilized {{in the development of}} a method, <b>hysterometry,</b> for the quantification of hormonal and pharmacological effects on the human myometrium in vivo. The method has been built up with due consideration for laws from mechanics of materials and hydrodynamics. By applying mathematical theorems and accepting certain approximations, the basic results of recordings of intrauterine pressure are transformed inte wall tension, allowing for the size of the uterus. The equivalent of an elasticity modulus in the myometrium has been used as a synthetic discriminator (without any real physiologic correlation) for the evaluation of hormonal and pharmacological effects. <b>Hysterometry</b> har been used for the evaluation of uterine tonicity during the menstrual cycle. It was demonstrated that uterine tonicity is higher in the proliferative than in the secretory phase. The uterine tonicity correlated well with the concentrations in serum of estradiol and progesterone at the time of the examination. <b>Hysterometry</b> has also been used for the evaluation of effects of inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis (Naproxen Sodium and Naproxen acid) and of a selective beta- 2 -receptor stimulator (Salbutamol) upon the uterus in women with primary dysmenorrhea. It was shown that uterine tonicity was high on the first day of menstruation in untreated or placebo-treated dysmenorrheic women. Administration of inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis or beta- 2 -receptor stimulating agents markedly decreased the uterine tonicity and relieved the menstrual pain.   digitalisering@um...|$|E
30|$|Since then, {{some studies}} {{confirmed}} {{the importance of}} peritoneal cytology by showing that patients with early-stage endometrial cancer with positive peritoneal cytology had worse survival rates than patients with early-stage endometrial cancer with negative peritoneal cytology [31 – 33]. As these studies classified patients according to the clinical staging system [34] (AJCC 2002; based on <b>hysterometry</b> and physical examination), other important prognostic factors like myometrial invasion [35] were not taken into account. As a result, positive cytology {{appeared to be an}} independent prognostic factor, while in fact, it is more likely a consequence of aggressive or more advanced cancer.|$|E
