60|$|Whenever {{the crown}} {{had come to}} the commons to desire a supply for the {{discharging}} of debts due on the civil list, it was always asked and granted with one of the three following qualifications; sometimes with all of them. Either it was stated, that the revenue had been diverted from its purposes by Parliament; or that those duties had fallen short of the sum for which they were given by Parliament, and that the intention of the legislature had not been fulfilled; or that the money required to discharge the civil list debt was to be raised chargeable on the civil list duties. In the reign of Queen Anne, the crown was found in debt. The lessening and granting away some part of her revenue by Parliament was alleged as the cause of that debt, and pleaded as an equitable ground, such it certainly was, for discharging it. It does not appear that the duties which were then applied to the ordinary government produced clear above 580,000l. a year; because, when they were afterwards granted to George the First, 120,000l. was added to complete the whole to 700,000l. a year. Indeed it was then asserted, and, I have no doubt, truly, that for many years the net produce did not amount to above 550,000l. The queen's <b>extraordinary</b> <b>charges</b> were besides very considerable; equal, at least, to any we have known in our time. The application to Parliament was not for an absolute grant of money; but to empower the queen to raise it by borrowing upon the civil list funds.|$|E

40|$|While {{there is}} no clear {{evidence}} of Jews having been present in the town of Fraga when the Count of Barcelona Ramon Berenguer IV reconquered it in 1149, the possibility cannot be dismissed out of hand. The first documentary reference to the Jews of Fraga appears in a letter that King James I of Catalonia-Aragon sent to the Jews living in the town in around 1237. Another reference {{can be found in a}} document dated 8 October 1264, in which the king acknowledged that every aljama in Aragon had paid his eldest son, Peter, the annual tax for the Christmas celebrations. It should be noted that Fraga contributed to the coffers of Saragossa at the time in question, as did Lleida [Lérida]. In 1282, King Peter the Great ordered Fragas Jewish aljama to submit its account books corresponding to the last 15 years for inspection in order to clear up a matter related to tax payment. Counting back 15 years from 1282 gives 1267 - 1268 as possibly either the time at which Fragas Jewish aljama was first established or the point at which Fraga became accountable to Lleida rather than to Saragossa. In summary, Fragas Jewish aljama was already established in the 13 th century, under the jurisdiction of that of Lleida. There had been Jews in the town since 1237, and a Jewish community since 1267 - 1268, when the Jews of both Fraga and Lleida ceased to have ties with Saragossas Jewish community. The Jewish aljama in Fraga spanned carrer Barranco and La Collada, encompassing the present-day passageways of San Julián, Santa Irene, Aitona and Santa Margarita. Accessible via a gate on carrer Barranco, the Jewish quarter had a bakery, stores, wells or storage pits, wine cellars, workshops and shops looking out onto the street. However, there are now no traces of any of them, nor of the synagogue. The authorities that represented the Jewish community comprised a secretary, a rabbi or teacher, a treasurer, an almoner, a town crier and a gatekeeper or area guard, one of whom would also have acted as a judge. The rabbi oversaw religious celebrations and feast days. The Jews of Fraga came to enjoy genuine privileges as a result of a series of decrees issued in 1328. The Jews contributed to standard royal expenditure through taxes known as the cena (a hospitality tax paid to the royal court) and the quèstia (an irregular tax usually levied in response to specific needs). Queen Maria de Luna exempted them from the cena tax in 1396, but it was reinstated following restoration work on the aljama in 1436. The Jews contributions to the <b>extraordinary</b> <b>charges</b> imposed by the king were unusual in that they could be made in an individual capacity, i. e. directly to the Crown. The Jews made such contributions when princes and princesses married, when members of the royal family were born, when kings were crowned and when funding was required for military campaigns, as well as through the morabatí tax (paid to the king in exchange for a royal promise to refrain from altering the coinage), such as that of 1397, etc. In 1408, an attempt was made to reduce the size of the Jews debt corresponding to annual fees levied on property, at which point they owed varying amounts to Fragas Augustinian monastery (outstanding since 1397), to Queen Violante de Bar and to the priest of the Corpus Christi Chapel of the Church of Saint John of Lleida. The Jewish quarter was abandoned until 1436, after which time it apparently made a successful recovery. Information on the period in question is very scarce, however. The Jews were granted many specific privileges, notably including measures to help them increase their earnings through sales of products such as wine (1309, 1322, 1324), taxes, called cises, on food products (1389, 1399, 1409) and a 10 -year exemption from the cena tax (1400); exemption from fees, called lluïsme and fadiga, payable to landowners as a result of transfer of landed property (1384, 1389); waived debts (1389); exemption from fines and penalties (1399); the right not to be disturbed (1399); the privilege of not being the subject of accusations (1409); the right to represent themselves in court (1391); exemption from contributions payable upon slaughtering animals (1409); protection for aljama officials involved in crimes (1453); the right to establish an aljama with up to 100 households (1413); the right to receive pledges from Christians (1413); free transport of belongings (1413); the right to have a house in any part of the town (1436); exemption from the morabatí tax (1398, 1451); and the privilege of not being prosecuted by Christian courts. There are no records of any deaths having occurred in Fraga in the disturbances that took place in August 1391. As of that time, the town council included two representatives of the aljama. The conversion of Jews in 1414 - 1415 led to more problems, possibly similar in all the aljamas along the banks of the Cinca River. The problems in question basically consisted of the conversions giving rise to a cultural change, a break with tradition and the abandonment of the aljama, whose inhabitants moved to another part of the town. The neophytes did not see why charges applicable to the Jews should also apply to them, and were forced to contribute thereto against their will. Some neophytes encountered problems in terms of obtaining annual payments levied on property due to them as Jews or the heirs of Jews. After 1436, the Jewish quarter was restored and its synagogue reopened, and as many as 50 families lived there until the expulsion of the Jews in 1492...|$|E

40|$|Hole doped {{transition}} metal oxides are famous {{due to their}} <b>extraordinary</b> <b>charge</b> transport properties, such as high temperature superconductivity (cuprates) and colossal magnetoresistance (manganites). Astonishing, the mother system of these compounds is a Mott insulator, whereas {{important role in the}} establishment of the metallic or superconducting state is played by the way that holes are self-organized with doping. Experiments have shown that by adding holes the insulating phase breaks into antiferromagnetic (AFM) regions, which are separated by hole rich clumps (stripes) with a rapid change of the phase of the background spins and orbitals. However, recent experiments in overdoped manganites of the La(1 -x) Ca(x) MnO(3) (LCMO) family have shown that instead of charge stripes, charge in these systems is organized in a uniform charge density wave (CDW). Besides, recent theoretical works predicted that the ground state is inhomogeneously modulated by orbital and charge solitons, i. e. narrow regions carrying charge (+/-) e/ 2, where the orbital arrangement varies very rapidly. So far, this has been only a theoretical prediction. Here, by using 139 La Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) we provide direct evidence that the ground state of overdoped LCMO is indeed solitonic.

40|$|Abstract Synthesis of Doped Graphene Nanoribbons from Molecular and Polymeric Precursorsby Ryan Randal ClokeDoctor of Philosophy in ChemistryUniversity of California, Berkeley Professor Felix Fischer, Chair As {{electronic}} devices continue to shrink and energy problems continue to grow, nanoscale materials {{are becoming increasingly}} important. Graphene is a material with exceptional promise to complement silicon in next-generation electronics because of its <b>extraordinary</b> <b>charge</b> carrier mobility, while also finding a role in cutting-edge energy solutions due to its high surface area and conductivity. Improving on this material even further by reducing the width of graphene to nanoscale dimensions with atomically-precise dopant patterns {{is the subject of}} this thesis. Nanometer-wide strips of graphene, known as graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), offer the advantages of semiconducting behavior, combined with more accessible surface area compared to bulk graphene (Chapter 1). Additionally, it is demonstrated that GNRs can be doped with atomic precision, allowing for intricate modulation of the electronic properties of this material, which was studied by STM, STS, and nc-AFM (Chapter 2). Controlled growth of GNRs on surfaces is still an outstanding challenge within the field, and to this end, a variety of porphyrin-GNR template materials were synthesized (Chapter 3). The GNRs obtained in this work were also synthesized in solution, and it was shown that these materials possess excellent properties for applications in hydrogen storage, carbon dioxide reduction, and Li-ion batteries (Chapter 4). A prerequisite for solution-synthesized GNRs, conjugated aromatic polymers are an important class of materials in their own right. Therefore, Ring-Opening Alkyne Metathesis Polymerization was developed using conjugated, strained diynes (Chapter 5). The resulting conjugated polymers were explored both for their own materials properties due to a remarkable self-assembly process that was discovered, and also as precursors to GNRs (Chapter 6). This work advances the fundamental understanding of carbon-based nanostructures, as well as the large-scale production of GNRs for next-generation energy and electronics applications...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{results from}} experimental studies, mostly {{at very low}} temperatures, and fabrication of very small electronic components made with GaAs/GaAlAs heterostructures. The components are so small that individual electrons are important to their characteristics. It is {{with this type of}} components possible to measure small fractions of the elementary charge and count each electron passing into an isolated conducting island. The wave-nature of the electrons play a signifi-cant role, because the electron wavelength is comparable to device sizes. An intermediate regime, with device dimensions ranging between atomic sizes up to the smallest things that we almost can see with our own eyes, is called mesoscopic. Electronic components in the mesoscopic regime exhibit a variety of new phenomena that have been extensively studied during the last years. Single electron effects originate from the charging energy associated with transport of electrons to very small conducting islands. Charging effects have been observed as periodic resonance peaks in the conductance through such small islands, referred to as Coulomb blockade oscillations. Each peak corresponds to the addition of one electron to the dot, an <b>extraordinary</b> <b>charge</b> sensitivity. Energy quantization is a manifestation of the wave-nature of the electron. The electron can, when the wavelength is comparable to the extent of the component, be considered as a standing wave. It can be restricted from moving in one, two or all three dimensions. In the latter case the component is referred to as a quantum dot. This system may be seen as an artificial atom, with a discrete number of electrons and a discrete spectrum of energy levels, with the possibility to attach leads and study one single artificial atom. We have shown that the eigenenergy spectrum of the dot is related to the geometric form of the boundary. We have found regularities of measured conductance variations as a function of magnetic field or size of a circular dot, which can be explained with a simplified model where the irregularities of the boundary and the contacts to the dot are neglected. The conductance reflects the density of states in the dot and is related to the zeroes of Bessel functions. Single electron charging effects was observed and we have examined the possibility of using the charge sensitivity of a quantum dot for making a single-electron tunneling electrometer, but found that the discrete energy spectrum results in a very complex behavior and gives the component an unwanted magnetic field dependence. The studied effects are of an intermediate, truly mesoscopic, regime; we cannot resolve the individual eigenenergy levels of the dot, but the conductance depends on the eigenenergy spectrum that reflect the geometry of the dot. A quantum dot in a semiconductor heterostructure is a system that provides us with excellent possibilities for investigations of phenomena that affect nanometer sized electronics...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{asserts that}} {{selected}} {{texts of the}} South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission possess a powerful political potential {{in their ability to}} challenge and refute historical relations of racialised power in South Africa. The prospective political efficacy of these texts is seen as residing in their critical ability to subvert and challenge the predominant understandings, discourses and representations of Apartheid, or the 'old', South Africa. Three overlapping routes of enquiry are explored in this regard. Firstly, the political efficacy of such texts is seen as arising from their role in terms of the recovery of previously repressed histories. This recovery enlarges the archive of South Africa's past and contributes to the constitution of a new body of knowledge, from which credible standpoints of resistance and opposition may be articulated. A second explanation highlights the fact these texts are able to exert a form of discursive critique upon the predominant practices and representations of both former and reigning social orders. This level of critique enables us, in Foucault's (1981) terms to restore to political discourses their nature as contextual and discontinuous practices of construction as opposed to naturally-occurring, seamlessly-unified, purely significatory instances of language. The last account engages more directly with the radical and transgressive nature of these texts, with their affective and ultimately symptomatic qualities. It is here suggested that these texts have earned their <b>extraordinary</b> visceral <b>charge,</b> their special power and horror, for many South Africans, precisely because they have exposed and stretched to the limit the boundaries of the past discursive order, of what had been known, what was understood and what could be represented in the Apartheid State...|$|R
40|$|The {{search for}} an ever-elusive home is a thread that runs {{throughout}} much literature by authors who have immigrated to the United States. Dominican authors are particularly susceptible to this search for a home because “for many Dominicans, home is synonymous with political and/or economic repression and is all too often {{a point of departure}} on a journey of survival” (Bonilla 200). This “journey of survival” is a direct reference to the dictatorship of Rafael Leonidas Trujillo Molina, who controlled the Dominican Republic from 1930 - 1961. The pain and trauma that Trujillo inflicted upon virtually everyone associated with the Dominican Republic during this era is still heartbreakingly apparent, and perhaps nowhere is that trauma more thoroughly illustrated than in the literature of Julia Alvarez. Alvarez {{is a prime example of}} an author who utilizes narrative in a clear attempt to come to grips with lingering traumatic memories. After her father’s role in an attempt to overthrow the dictator is revealed, Alvarez’s family is forced to flee the Dominican Republic as political exiles, and a sense of displacement has haunted her since. Because both the Dominican Republic and the United States are <b>extraordinary</b> racially <b>charged,</b> concepts of home and identity are inextricably bound to race relations in much of Alvarez’s art. Using theoretical concepts drawn from the fields of trauma studies and Black cultural studies, this essay examines Alvarez’s debut novel in order to illustrate the myriad ways in which culture, politics, and race converge and speak through each other, largely in the form of traumas that can irreparably alter one’s sense of home, voice, and identity...|$|R
40|$|Research {{interest}} in graphene, a two-dimensional crystal {{consisting of a}} single atomic plane of carbon atoms, {{has been driven by}} its <b>extraordinary</b> properties, including <b>charge</b> carriers that mimic ultra-relativistic elementary particles. Moreover, graphene exhibits ballistic electron transport on the submicrometre scale, even at room temperature, which has allowed the demonstration of graphene-based field-effect transistors and the observation of a room-temperature quantum Hall effect. Here we confirm the presence of free-standing, single-layer graphene with directly interpretable atomic-resolution imaging combined with the spatially resolved study of both the p! p * transition and the p 1 s plasmon. We also present atomic-scale observations of the morphology of free-standing graphene and explore the role of microstructural peculiarities that affect the stability of the sheets. We also follow the evolution and interaction of point defects and suggest a mechanism by which they form ring defects. Recent measurements of the remarkable electronic properties of graphene have resulted in intense research activity on two-dimensional (2 D) crystals 1 – 5. Unlike most materials in condensed matter physics, where the Schrödinger equation can be used to describe their electronic properties, for graphene the charge carriers mimic relativistic particles and can thus be described using the Dirac equation 3...|$|R
40|$|Poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene), {{abbreviated}} PEDOT, {{is one of}} {{the most}} outstanding electroactive polymers, whose applications cover a wide range of fields from biomedicine to electronic components. In this work the physicochemical properties of nanoconstructs obtained by growing PEDOT chains over steel surfaces are investigated. The structural features of such nanostructures, which had successfully been used to build supercapacitors, are investigated, revealing that the polymeric phase plays a key role in the charge accumulation process. The ultra-structure organization and dynamics of these constructs are explored by molecular simulations and the results are compared with the available experimental data. The outcome of this investigation has offered a detailed vision of the structural features that lead to an extraordinarily efficient charge accumulation. Atomistic models generated using stochastic methods had provided different distributions of polymer chains over a metallic surface. Molecular dynamics simulations performed on such models have demonstrated that the <b>extraordinary</b> capacity for <b>charge</b> accumulation stems from a thin balance between the electrostatic repulsion that polymer chains exercise to each other and the attraction that the counterions present in the electropolymerization exert on those oxidized PEDOT chains. This situation favors the aggregation of the PEDOT chains mediated by the perchlorate ions, which act over them as inter-chain cement and which leads to regular three dimensional organization of chains, regardless of their initial distribution over the metallic surface. At the same time, such inner proximity of the polymer chains when growing upwards forces the capture of perchlorate ions, acting as accumulated charges that could be further released if the PEDOT oxidation state is externally reversed.

60|$|Another {{still more}} <b>extraordinary</b> and unnatural <b>charge</b> was made against Bunyan. He lived at {{a period when}} witchcraft, witches, and wizards were in the height of fashion. Any poor woman who had outlived or had become a burden to her natural protectors, and whose temper was soured by infirmities, {{especially}} if her language was vulgar and her appearance repulsive, ran {{the risk of being}} defamed as a witch. If in her neighbourhood a murrain seized the cattle, or a disease entered a family which baffled the little knowledge of the country practitioners--such as epilepsy, St. Vitus' dance, or St. Anthony's fire--it was ascribed to witchcraft, and vengeance was wreaked upon any reputed witch. In many parts of England she was tried by a kind of Lynch law, in a very summary manner. Her hands and feet being bound together, she was thrown into deep water; if she sank, and was drowned, she was declared innocent; if she swam, it was a proof of guilt, and a little form of law condemned her to the stake or halter. In Scotland, they were treated with greater barbarity; they were awfully tortured--thumb-screws, the boots to crush their knees, pricking them with needles or awls night and day, to prevent a moment's rest, were persevered in--until a confession was extorted, to be followed by a frightful death. The ignorance that prevailed may account for the faith of the vulgar in witchcraft; but that learned divines, and even the enlightened Judge Hale, should fall into the delusion, is most surprising. The charge against Bunyan was, that he had circulated some paper libeling a most respectable widow, a Quakeress, as a witch. This paper cannot now be discovered; but the story is so perfectly ridiculous as to render it quite improbable that Bunyan had any knowledge of it. The account is contained in a rare pamphlet of four leaves, preserved in the very curious library of the Society of Friends at Devonshire House, Bishopsgate. It is entitled, 'A lying wonder discovered, and the strange and terrible news from Cambridge proved false; which false news is published in a libel, concerning a wicked slander cast upon a Quaker; but the author of the said libel was ashamed to subscribe his name to it. Also, this contains an answer to John Bunion's paper, touching the said imagined witchcraft, which he hath given forth to your wonderment, as he saith; but it is also proved a lie and a slander by many credible witnesses hereafter mentioned.'[201] It narrates that Margaret Pryor, of Long Stanton, indicted, on the 28th July, 1659, the widow Morlin, a Quaker lady, for having, on the 29th November, 1657, took her out of bed from her husband in the night, put a bridle in her mouth, and transformed her into a bay mare, and with a Quaker, William Allen, rode upon her to Maddenly House, a distance of four miles; that they made her fast to the latch of the door, while she saw them partake of a feast of mutton, rabbits, and lamb [lamb in November!!]; that they shone like angels, and talked of doctrine, and that she knew some of the guests; that her feet were a little sore, but not her hands, nor was she dirty. In examining her, the judge elicited that she made no mention of the story for a year and three-quarters, and that her deposition then was that some evil spirit changed her into a bay-horse; that her hands and feet were lamentably bruised, and changed as black as a coal; that she had her chemise on, which was all bloody, from her sides being rent and torn with the spurs. All this was unknown to her husband; nor had she accounted for her chemise so strangely fitting a horse or mare. It was proved that the complainant had received money for bringing the charge, and pretended to have burnt some of her hair with elder-bark, as a counter-charm to prevent it happening again. The judge summed up with observing that it was a mere dream or phantasy, and that the complainant was the sorceress, by practicing incantations in burning her hair and bark. The jury found a verdict of--not guilty; and thus two innocent persons were saved by an enlightened judge from an ignominious death. It is almost incredible that, even after the trial, priests and magistrates who had promoted the prosecution professed to believe that the charge was true. This singular narrative, in defence of the poor persecuted Quakeress, is signed James Blackley, an alderman, George Whitehead, and three others. No one can believe that John Bunyan gave credit to such a tale, or mentioned it to the injury of the parties accused. His reply was, that these slanders were devised by the devil and his instruments--'God knows that I am innocent.' The probability is, that the pamphlet called Strange News from Cambridge had been sent to him, and that he gave it to some Quaker to answer.|$|R
