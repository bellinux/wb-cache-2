50|$|Typically, <b>intake</b> (<b>fresh)</b> air travels up {{the main}} gate, across the face, {{and then down}} the tail gate, known as 'U' type ventilation. Once past the face the air is no longer fresh air, but return air {{carrying}} away coal dust and mine gases such as methane, carbon dioxide, depending on the geology of the coal. Return air is extracted by ventilation fans mounted on the surface. Other ventilation methods can be used where intake air also passes the main gate and into a bleeder or back return road reducing gas emissions from the goaf onto the face, or intake air travels up the tail gate and across the face {{in the same direction}} as the face chain in a homotropal system.|$|E
40|$|With an {{increased}} awareness of sustainability issues, natural ventilation has become an elegant method for reducing the costs and environmental effects of the energy {{that is used to}} maintain comfortable indoor air quality rather than using mechanical ventilation. The windows in many industrial buildings are continuously open to exhaust pollutants and <b>intake</b> <b>fresh</b> air. Though windows are functional and efficient for natural ventilation, rainwater is able to penetrate through the windows during wind-driven rain. For industries in which the moisture content affects the quality of the product, the intrusion of a large amount of rainwater through windows must be prevented without compromising the effective ventilation. The aim of this research is to determine an innovative design for windows to accomplish the optimum of high ventilation and low rain penetration. For this purpose, windows are variously innovated and tested in full-scale measurements, reduced-scale wind-tunnel measurements and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). An artificial rain and wind velocity to mimic the average of the maximum values in Korea are created. The maximum reduction in rain penetration of over 98 % compared to basic 90 ° open windows is attained with only a 4 %– 9 % decrement of ventilation efficiency in the two recommended designs...|$|E

40|$|AbstractEvaporative cooling (EC) is {{an energy}} {{efficient}} and environmental friendly technology which uses water evaporation {{to absorb the}} heat from surroundings and produce cooling air. EC has limited application cases in hot and humid regions because of the relatively low cooling capacity. In recent years, the study on hybrid EC and traditional mechanical cooling becomes the trend to break the region limitation of the technology. This paper carries out a case study for applying the Regenerative Indirect Evaporative Cooling System (RIECS) to an all-fresh-air hybrid air-conditioning system of a wet market in Hong Kong. The condense water from an air-handling unit (AHU) is collected and used as cooling medium sprayed onto the heat exchanger of an IEC equipment. At the same time, the contaminative and exhausted air from the wet market returns to the IEC equipment to cool the <b>intake</b> <b>fresh</b> air, so that the fresh air pre-cooling before it enters to the AHUs is realized. The energy saving and economic efficiency were analyzed and compared among RIECS, rotating heat recovery wheel system and the A/C system without heat recovery. The results show that RIEC system has the largest annual energy saving potential with a payback period of 2. 9 years, which shows a great potential of its application in Hong Kong...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} work focused on evaluations {{of improving the}} acceleration, cold start transient performances and emissions in a common rail direct injection (CRDI) turbocharged diesel engine. The temperature impacts on the engine emissions were investigated at ambient temperatures ranging between - 7 and 20 °C. The {{results show that the}} highest specific gaseous and particulate emissions are produced at the earlier stage of the NEDC. The particulates emitted at extremely high AFR conditions are more dominant compared to those that are caused by the turbo-lag problem over the NEDC. Both the fuel and engine oil contribute as main carbon sources to produce the SVOC particulate emissions from the engine combustion. A controlled intake air thermal heating system was implemented to improve the engine performances at cold ambient conditions. By using the thermal heating system, the engine efficiency during the first UDC can be improved by up to 1. 46. By using high blending biodiesel fuels, the transient emission spikes can be significantly eliminated. The cumulative PN and THC emissions of biodiesel can be reduced by up to 75 % and 50 % respectively. An incremental transient EGR strategy was evaluated to improve the instantaneous particulate emission performance during acceleration conditions. With the improvement of the turbocharger performance and boosted <b>intake</b> <b>fresh</b> air mass flow, the novel strategy resulted in a reduced fuel injection quantity and improved combustion...|$|E
40|$|To {{mitigate}} {{the problem of}} dust contamination to the intake air of an underground coal mine, a study was carried out to understand the airflow and respirable dust flow behaviour {{for the development of}} effective dust suppression strategies. Three dimensional (3 D) Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling was used to predict airflow field around the crusher and transfer point above the underground bin and along the belt roadway. The CFD model was validated using average velocity and dust concentration profiles obtained from ventilation surveys in the belt roadway. The stochastic particle tracking model was adopted in the Lagrangian scheme to study the respirable dust dispersion behaviour and predict dust concentration distribution in the belt roadway. To overcome the uncertainty produced by the stochastic tracking, sufficient numbers of particles were employed to obtain a stable concentration field. Modelling results show that areas of airflow turbulence and circulation occur once the fresh ventilation emerges from the bin bottom and intercepts airflow from another intake. Dust particles from the underground bin will be dispersed extensively in the belt roadway once they become airborne, contributing to the high dust contamination in the <b>intake</b> <b>fresh</b> air. To mitigate dust contamination to the mine ventilation system, the dust clouds from the bin have to be intercepted and suppressed before they become airborne over the bin. Results from the CFD modelling will be used for the design and installation of a more effective dust control system...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} whether fish intake was protective against leukemia, multiple myeloma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and if our previous finding of a protective effect of fish-related occupa-tions on the risk of these diseases was due to dietary intake of fish. We used data from a population-based case-control study undertaken in Canada in 1994 – 1998. Dietary information was available for 919 leukemia cases, 287 myeloma cases, 1418 NHL cases, and 4202 controls. The risk {{of each of the}} three cancers was determined using multiple logistic regression analysis according to quartiles of weekly <b>fresh</b> fish <b>intake,</b> percentage of total energy <b>intake</b> from <b>fresh</b> fish, and percentage of total fat <b>intake</b> from <b>fresh</b> fish. After adjusting for age, sex, smoking, BMI, and proxy status, people who consumed greater proportions of their total energy <b>intake</b> from <b>fresh</b> fish had a significantly lower risk of each of the three types of cancer, and there was a significant dose-response for risk of leu-kemia and NHL. Those in the highest quartile for percentage of fat intake from fish were at lowest risk: leukemia odds ratio (OR) 0. 72, 95 % confidence inter-val (CI) 0. 58 – 0. 89; multiple myeloma OR 0. 64, 95 % CI 0. 45 – 0. 90; NHL OR 0. 71, 95 % CI 0. 60 – 0. 85; and all LH cancers combined OR 0. 70, 95 % CI 0. 61 – 0. 81. The protective effect previously observed for working with fish on the risk of leukemia and lymphoma was independent of fish intake. These findings suggest that a diet high in fish may be protective against lym-phohematopoietic cancers and confirm the reduced risk among fish workers.

The {{aim of this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the Helicobacter pylori infection and dietary habits common in Khuzestan province. Methods. This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2011 – 2013 on 374 patients. Participants were interviewed using a food frequency questionnaire and tissue sample of the antrum was sent for pathology lab. The histopathological major variables were graded on a scale of 3 (mild, moderate, and severe) and data analyzed using nonparametric tests. Results. In this study, of 160 patients (43 %) that were determined, 8. 1 percent had severe contamination. Among dietary patterns, relationship between energy intake and carbohydrate with H. pylori was significant.

40|$|In the Himalayas, domesticated yak is fed at an altitudinal {{range of}} 3, 000 to 5, 000 m. Below this zone, the cow is more common. Hybrids are fed at an {{intermediate}} zone. In order {{to analyze the}} genetic basis of milk protein variation, milk samples {{were taken from the}} nak (female yak), cow and their hybrid. By principle component analysis, yak and a highland type of cow (kirmcome) were clearly distinguished from midland (shakzam) and lowland (palang) cows. Local Sherpa people may produce suitable animals for each zone by controlling animal reproduction systems. Generally speaking, a sustainable stocking rate is two adult animals per hectare in the central Himalayas. However, most pastures were overgrazed 3 to 10 times more than this level. The feedstuff stored over winter was half composed of hay and half of agricultural by-products such as rice straw and wheat straw. Grazing by animals provided 53 to 60 % of food <b>intake</b> (<b>fresh</b> plant weight). Ten % of fodder was provided by trees. For the total number of animals in this study region, the fodder shortage was very acute. Overpopulation of animals was estimated to be 31 to 73 %. Tree fodder is a typical feedstuff in this region. Popular fodder trees are Quercus, Symplocos and Castanopsis. Extention programmes are needed to increase tree fodder production and conserve soils. Ten years are needed to establish a system for continuous tree fodder production. One fodder tree can produce 14 kg fresh matter per year. The shortage can overcome by planting an additional 10 to 15 fodder trees per cow. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Improving the {{sustainability}} of poultry production involves limiting its environmental impact and maintaining effectiveness. It has recently been shown that genetic selection {{on the ability of}} chickens to digest wheat at 23 d of age can decrease chicken excretion without decreasing BW at this age. The aim {{of this study was to}} check whether selection on digestibility modifi ed excretion and growth performance over the whole production cycle. The 2 divergent lines selected for high (D+) and low (D-) apparent metabolizable energy corrected for 0 N balance (AMEn) values were compared with a reference line used at the beginning of the selection experiment (RL) to evaluate the potential excretion improvement that could be expected with such selection. These 3 lines were therefore compared for growth and excretion (raw and relative to feed <b>intake,</b> <b>fresh</b> and dry excreta weights, and moisture content of excreta) from 4 to 53 d. Between 4 and 7 d, 17 and 21 d, and 49 and 53 d, AMEn and N and P excretion rates were also compared between the 3 lines. Furthermore, body composition (breast meat and abdominal fat yields), bone breaking strength, and meat quality traits (lightness, redness, yellowness, and ultimate pH) were compared between lines at 53 d. Over the whole rearing period, D+ birds excreted signifi cantly less fresh and dry excreta (? 56 and ? 61 %) than D- and RL birds (? 6 and ? 26 %). Similarly, N and P excretion rates of D+ birds were 13 % to 30 % less than those of D- birds and 12 % to 19 % less than RL birds, depending on age. These excretion differences may be related to the differential development of the gastrointestinal tract. Differences between lines were already present at 7 d for relative gizzard weight and the weight of the upper to the lower part of the gastrointestinal tract ratio. Anatomic differences were maximum at 23 d for all traits except for relative weight of the duodenum. At slaughter age, BW, breast and fat yields, and meat color did not differ between D+ and RL birds, but D- birds were fatter than D+ and RL birds. Finally, ultimate meat pH was 1 % to 2 % greater in RL birds than in the D+ and D- lines. In conclusion, this study showed that selection of chickens for AMEn is a possible way to reduce the environmental impact of production over the whole rearing period without a negative impact on growth, body composition, or meat quality.

40|$|Background. The {{prevalence}} of obesity and overweight children has been an ongoing health epidemic in the US {{for the last several}} decades. The problem has consistently worsened and has disproportionately been the most prevalent among low socioeconomic status (SES) populations. Food availability in the home has been suggested to be a potential factor related to overweight and obesity, as availability is likely associated with intake. Food availability of low SES preschool aged children has not been well examined. The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore the food environment of the Harris County Department of Education (HCDE) Head Start population, and describe reported frequency of intake of particular food groups. The effect of food availability on reported intake was also examined. ^ Methods. This was a cross-sectional study of secondary data analysis. Data obtained from 17 HCDE Head Start Centers was analyzed using PASW 18 Statistical Software. Demographic analyses included population, age, gender, race, parent occupation, type of home, and language spoken in the home. Descriptive statistics included reported availability of foods in the home as well as frequency of intake. ^ Regression analysis examined the relationship of availability of foods on intake. The food categories included were: dark leafy green and orange vegetables, other vegetables, fruits, soda, salty snacks, and sweet snacks. For both vegetable categories reported <b>intake</b> of <b>fresh,</b> frozen, and canned vegetables were included. For the fruit category, <b>intake</b> of <b>fresh,</b> frozen, canned, and dried fruits were reported. ^ Results. Results showed that 90 - 95 % of parents reported having vegetables and fruits available in the home. However, the only significant relationship between availability and <b>intake</b> was for <b>fresh</b> fruit and dried fruit. No associations were seen among the vegetable groups. Other vegetables (bell peppers, eggplant, tomatoes, onions, iceberg lettuce, asparagus) that were frozen, approached significance for availability on intake, however once adjusted for confounders the relationship was no longer present. Among soda, salty snacks, and sweet snacks the only significant relationship was seen for soda availability and intake. Salty snacks and sweet snacks presence in the home was not a predictor of increased frequency of intake. ^ Conclusions. This research supported the hypothesis that availability of foods has an impact on <b>intake</b> for <b>fresh</b> fruits, dried fruits and soda. No associations were seen for vegetables, salty snacks and sweet snacks. Additionally, most of the parents reported having fruits and vegetables in the home, but reported intakes were not meeting the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommendations. Strengths of the study included the large sample size taken from numerous HCDE Head Start Centers. Limitations included questionable reliability of participant’s responses, ability to generalize to other populations, and the use of secondary data rather than prospectively collected data. ...|$|R

Red clover was harvested at 60 % bloom stage. It was ensiled into round bales without an additive (CD) and with an additive supplementation (CDA) in the amount of 2 L t- 1 fresh material. Statistically lower (P< 0. 001) DM content was recorded in CD (405 g kg- 1 fresh sample) in comparison with CDA (665 g ST kg- 1 fresh sample). Statistically higher CP content (P< 0. 001) was recorded in CD (127 g kg- 1 ST) in comparison with CDA (110 g SP kg- 1 ST). CD had lower pH (P< 0. 001) (4. 9) in comparison with CDA (5. 2).

50|$|In a {{cross-flow}} engine, {{the transfer}} and exhaust ports are {{on opposite sides}} of the cylinder, and a deflector on the top of the piston directs the <b>fresh</b> <b>intake</b> charge into the upper part of the cylinder, pushing the residual exhaust gas down the other side of the deflector and out the exhaust port. The deflector increases the piston's weight and exposed surface area, affecting piston cooling and also making it difficult to achieve an efficient combustion chamber shape. This design has been superseded since the 1960s by the loop scavenging method (below), especially for motorbikes, although for smaller or slower engines, such as lawn mowers, the cross-flow-scavenged design can be an acceptable approach.|$|R

Residual pesticides were detected in 79 samples (42. 5 %) with eight different fungicides. Only 20 samples (10. 8 %) exceeded the maximum residue limits (MRLs) for pesticides registered by the Korea Food & Drug Administration. Among them, tolclofos-methyl residues (10. 2 %) exceeded the MRL for fresh ginseng in 18 ginseng seedlings and one of the two-year old fresh ginseng plants, and the residual level in just one ginseng seedling violated the MRL for pyrimethanil. The results showed that residual pesticides levels in marketable fresh ginseng around Seoul were relatively safe. The percent acceptable daily intake (%ADI) was calculated using pesticide residues in fresh ginseng and dietary <b>intakes</b> of <b>fresh</b> ginseng. The risk caused by pesticide residues in fresh ginseng was very low...|$|R
