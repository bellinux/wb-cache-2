25|$|Galileo is {{to provide}} a new global search and rescue (SAR) {{function}} as part of the MEOSAR system. Satellites will be equipped with a transponder which will relay distress signals from emergency beacons to the Rescue coordination centre, which will then initiate a rescue operation.

Tests in February 2014 found that for Galileo's search and rescue function, operating as part of the existing International Cospas-Sarsat Programme, 77% of simulated distress locations can be pinpointed within 2km, and 95% within 5km.|$|E

500|$|Between 1996 and 2000, {{the lead}} monster and child went through radical changes {{as the story}} evolved. As the story {{continued}} to develop, the child varied in age and gender. Ultimately, the story team decided that a girl {{would be the best}} counterpart for a furry, [...] co-star. After a girl was settled upon, the character continued to undergo changes, at one point being from Ireland and at another time being an African-American character. Originally the character of the little girl, known as Mary, became a fearless seven-year-old who has been toughened by years of teasing and pranks from four older brothers. In stark contrast, Johnson is nervous about the possibility of losing his job after the boss at Monsters, Inc. announces a downsizing <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> He feels envious because another scarer, Ned (who later became Randall), is the company's top performer. Through various drafts, Johnson's occupation went back-and-forth from being a scarer and from working in another area of the company such as a janitor or a refinery worker, until his final incarnation as the best scarer at Monsters, Inc. Throughout development Pixar worried that having a main character whose main goal was to scare children would alienate audiences and make them not empathize with him. Docter would later describe that the team [...] "bent over backwards trying to create a story that still had monsters [...] " [...] while still solving the problem, A key moment came when the team decided [...] "Okay, he’s the BEST scarer there. He’s the star quarterback" [...] with Docter noting that before that moment [...] "design after design, we really didn’t know what he was about." [...] Disney noted to Pixar early on that they did not want the character to [...] "look like a guy in a suit." [...] To this end Johnson was originally planned to have tentacles for feet; however, this caused many problems in early animation tests. The idea was later largely rejected, as it was thought that audiences would be distracted by the tentacles. Mary's age also differed from draft to draft until the writers settled on the age of 3. [...] "We found that the younger she was, the more dependent she was on Sulley", Docter said.|$|E
