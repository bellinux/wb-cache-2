40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigate}} {{whether there are differences}} between adolescents who grow up in single-parent families and those who grow up in <b>nucleus</b> <b>families.</b> We have decided that there are no differences in the physical development between the adolescents who are growing up in single parent families and those growing up in <b>nucleus</b> <b>families.</b> There is no difference in the self-concept between these two groups, except in the ethical and moral self-image of adolescents living with one parent. Adolescents living in single-parent families have a weaker moral self-image. It can thus be concluded that physical development and positive self-concept (a favorable image of oneself) in adolescents do not depend on whether an adolescent is growing up in a single-parent or a <b>nucleus</b> <b>family,</b> but on the different characteristics of parents and their relationship with children, whether they are married or not.

40|$|Abstract Background Obesity is {{considered}} to be caused by a combination of heredity and environmental factors with typical onset during childhood. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify family risk factors for the development of obesity in children from Brazil. Methods Cross-sectional study with 699 children, randomly and proportionally selected, ranging from 5 to 9 years of age, from public and private schools in Feira de Santana-BA. Overweight and obesity were defined using IOTF standards. Analyses of the interviews with the children's guardians were used to determine the influence of the <b>family</b> <b>nucleus</b> on obesity. Results The children were classified into four groups based on weight percentiles (underweight, normal, overweight and obese). Significant differences between the groups in relation to ethnicity, social and economical status (ρ = 000. 0 for all) were found. The following variables were associated with the development of childhood obesity: fathers' obesity (ρ = 0. 001), mothers' (ρ = 0. 021) and both parents' (ρ = 0. 000). There was no significant statistical difference between fathers and mothers who did (ρ = 0. 81) or did not work out (ρ = 0. 15). Obesity (ρ = 0. 07) tended to be less prevalent in the child whose parents were separated. Family history of obesity (OR = 3. 3; IC = 2. 0 – 5. 5; ρ = 0. 000) and high social class (OR = 3. 0; IC = 1. 1 – 7. 7; ρ = 0. 020) were predictive and independent associated factors. Conclusion This study confirms the influence of genetic and/or behavioral factors on the origin of childhood obesity. Thus, effective intervention strategies must be focused not only on the children but on the entire <b>family</b> <b>nucleus.</b> </p...|$|E

Out of the 17 IgM positive pregnant women, only one had low avidity IgG {{corresponding to the}} acute phase of the infection. All the other women presented with high avidity IgG and also presented with residual IgM anti-T. gondii. Of this sample, 106 received home visits (this includes 11 <b>family</b> <b>nuclei</b> of pregnant women with residual IgM anti-T. gondii, 68 nuclei of only IgG positive pregnant women and 27 nuclei of pregnant women with no antibodies to anti-T. gondii), resulting in 267 individuals visited.

It is characterized by changes in the way of the production, the processes of proto-industrialisation and industrialisation are incoming. This economic transformation is related to changes in the family structure. The essay is based on the research of the listings of confession which notices the developement of the households in 1833 - 1855. Personal data were completed with parish registers. As a methodical basis was used family reconstitution, the problems were analysed by using microhistorical method.

40|$|The term »atomization of the family« {{is taken}} by the author to mean the {{division}} of large »gentile« families (known in Yugoslavia as »family co-operatives«) into several conjugal families (including two generations only) and a further reduction of these families {{to one of the}} sub-forms of the »family nucleus« or the »conjugal family«. The »gentile« rural family (called zadruga = co-operative) — which formerly may have included up to a hundred members or more — was the most usual type of family in the »traditional Yugoslav village«, while the conjugal family (inokoština), being generally regarded as synomymous with poverty, was much less widespread. However, the advance of individualistic trends (one of the effects of rapid industrialization) started the »atomization« of the co-operatives. This irreversible process was initiated by women, the traditional »underminers of the co-operative« (this female revolution was probably the result of the extremely unfavourable position of the woman within the co-operative). However, when the traditional co-operatives disappeared, the process of the »atomization« of the rural family did not come to an end but only continued in a different form. Since {{the end of the second}} world war the family in Yugoslavia 2 ̆ 7 s rural districts has been narrowing, i. e. becoming free of relatives not belonging to the actual <b>family</b> <b>nucleus,</b> and the number of children has decreased. The causes of this »atomization« can be found in a new attitude as regards the number of children, in the peasant woman’s emancipation from her husband, and in the early psychological and economic emancipation of young people in rural districts from the <b>family</b> <b>nucleus</b> and parental authority. One-,two-, three-, and four-member families, i. e. conjugal families, now account for 49. 7 per cent of the total number of rural families in Yugoslavia. In contrast to the views expressed recently by several foreign writers, the »gentile« family in Yugoslavia’s rural districts is not expected to become rehabilitated. In conclusion the author warns against the danger that in certain rural districts of Yugoslavia families may become over-atomized which may lead to a precarious lowering of the birth rate and even to depopulation which would certainly be a highly undesirable development...|$|E
40|$|The sociological {{continuity}} between {{the traditional and}} modern family should be observed through {{the size of the}} family, the continuation of family relations, and the preservation of such values as collectivism, solidarity, egalitarianism and democracy. The practice of more than one family living together has almost disappeared from our society. Statistical data indicates that during the last fifty years, the average number of members in a household has decreased from 5. 1 to 3. 8. This indirectly suggests the break up of the zadruga structure. Significant regional differences exist in the rate of decrease of large family households. In the regions where there were always smaller households, the rate of size decrease has been slower (Slovenia, Vojvodina), while where there were large households (Serbia,Bosna and Hercegovina, Macedonia), the rate has significantly increased. However, exceptions to this rule are such areas as Montenegro, with the smallest decline of large households, and Kosovo, where the number of household members has even increased. To analyze the change in the traditional family, data on inhabitants who are not married are also significant. During the last decade, the number of singles has increased (mostly men) as well as the number of divorcees, which in this case, has been mostly women. The agricultural population in relation to the total has reduced from 67. 2 % to 38. 2 % between 1948 to 1971. More than one third of the cities’ inhabitants have come directly from the village. The population migration has thus fractured the structure of endogamy and significantly increased national and regional exogamy. Therefore one of the attributes of the family zadruga has disappeared, i. e. the size of households. However if one wants to see elements of a family zadruga in a modern family, it is necessary to examine the organizational structure of living, internal relations, and the ties between the household and the living environment. We can confirm that a very close kinship still exists between the <b>family</b> <b>nucleus</b> and relatives. This has not been weakened by the process of modernization and industrialization, nor urbanization of the villages. However, the {{continuity between}} the traditional family zadruga and the modern family is most clearly obvious in the area of values. Collectivism, which is seen through the strong net-like family-relative ties, is present today through the feeling of solidarity not only within the nucleus of the family and their kinsmen, but on a much wider scale. Consequently today this value does not mean collective living in which individuality is lost, but rather such conditions for living and work which guarantee that the advance and freedom of each individual to be the condition for the freedom and advance of everyone. That, which the family zadruga was once most noted for over all other types of large families, was the principle of egalitarianism. However, egalitarianism and democratic decision making were not characteristic within the <b>family</b> <b>nucleus</b> of the family zadruga, such as they have not been characteristic to the later, more modern form of family organization. The subordination of the woman and childern to the man in the <b>family</b> <b>nucleus</b> {{within the framework of the}} family zadruga was later strengthened by marital laws which were based on Roman patriarchic principles. We feel, therefore, that, although the type of family organization known as the family zadruga, has almost ceased to exist, the continuation of its principles can be seen in the behaviour, mentality, and disposition of a considerable national stratum...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Verify {{the types}} of {{fissures}} that most affect patients under 12 years of age, at the Facial Deformity Rehabilitation Center in São Paulo, and evaluate individual, systemic and social factors. Methods: A sample of 100 children and adolescents with cleft lip and palate were selected {{with the purpose of}} collecting data as regards sex, race, type of fissure and side affected, syndromes, sequences and associated malformations, presence of family history of fissure, and age of parents {{at the time of the}} child’s conception. The patients’ parents answered a previously validated questionnaire with closed questions to provide data as regards the socio-economic factor. All the information was stored in a database and submitted to descriptive statistical analysis. Results: 61 % of population sample was of the male gender and 92 % was of the white race. The incisive trans-foramen fissure was prevalent (62 %) and the unilateral fissures were most frequent (65. 8 %), and the left side was the most affected (44. 3 %). As regards systemic factors, 22 % of the patients had syndromes or sequences; the most frequently associated syndrome was the Pierre Robin. Among the malformation associated with cleft lip and palate fissures, congenital heart diseases were prevalent (37. 9 %). Family recurrence of fissures was shown in only 23 % of cases.

The sisters’ pathways cross with Ruth Wilcox’s one, Henry’s wife, who assists them in time of hardness when their rent expires deciding to give her house (Howards End) to them. Besides them, other important characters as Dolly, Madam Avery, Evie and Jacky Bast are responsible for developing certain activities and representations in the novel.

Objective: To characterize the cases of sexual abuse valued in the emergency services and external consultation of a hospital institution of first level in the department of Cauca between 2007 and 2015. Materials and methods: A descriptive, retrospective study of victims of sexual abuse attended in external consultation/emergencies was made. Temporal and sociodemographic variables of the victim/aggressor and the context where the event occurred were selected. The analysis was done in Epi Info. Measures of central tendency, dispersion, proportions and reasons were calculated. The relationship between variables was assessed by using the Fischer test. Results: 77 % of the victims were women, 23 % men, at ages between 2 to 16 years and 100 % were students. The act was committed by a single aggressor. Besides, in 93. 0 % of the cases, the act was perpetrated by acquaintances, of whom 42. 9 % were family members. Conclusions: Despite the control and regulation measures, the results suggest that sexual abuse takes place at very early ages.

40|$|Paget {{disease of}} bone is {{characterized}} by focal increases of the bone-remodeling process. It {{is the second most}} common metabolic bone disease after osteoporosis. Genetic factors {{play a major role in}} the etiology of Paget disease of bone, and two loci have been mapped for the disorder: PDB 1 and PDB 2. The gene(s) causing the typical form of the disorder remains to be characterized. To decipher the molecular basis of Paget disease of bone, we performed genetic linkage analysis in 24 large French Canadian families (479 individuals) in which the disorder was segregating as an autosomal dominant trait. After exclusion of PDB 2, a genomewide scan was performed on the three most informative <b>family</b> <b>nuclei.</b> LOD scores > 1. 0 were observed at seven locations. The 24 families were then used to detect strong evidence for linkage to chromosome 5 q 35 -qter. Under heterogeneity, a maximum LOD score of 8. 58 was obtained at D 5 S 2073, at θ=. 1. The same characteristic haplotype was carried by all patients in eight families, suggesting a founder effect. A recombination event in a key family confined the disease region within a 6 -cM interval between D 5 S 469 and the telomere. The 16 other families, with very low conditional probability of linkage to 5 q 35 -qter, were further used, to map a second locus at 5 q 31. Under heterogeneity, a maximum LOD score of 3. 70 was detected at D 5 S 500 with θ=. 00. Recombination events refined the 5 q 31 region within 12. 2 cM, between D 5 S 642 and D 5 S 1972. These observations demonstrate the mapping of two novel loci for Paget disease of bone and provide further evidence for genetic heterogeneity of this highly prevalent disorder. It is proposed that the 5 q 35 -qter and 5 q 31 loci be named “PDB 3 ” and “PDB 4,” respectively...|$|R

A particle-number {{reprojection}} {{method is}} {{applied in the}} framework of the shell model Monte Carlo approach to calculate level densities for a <b>family</b> of <b>nuclei</b> using Monte Carlo sampling for a single nucleus. In particular we can also calculate level densities of odd-even and odd-odd nuclei despite a new sign problem introduced by the projection on an odd number of particles. The method is applied to level densities in the iron region using the complete pf + g 9 / 2 -shell. The single-particle level density parameter a and the backshift parameter ∆ are extracted by fitting the microscopically calculated level densities to the backshifted Bethe formula. We find good agreement with experimental level densities with no adjustable parameters in the microscopic calculations. The parameter a is found to vary smoothly with mass and does not show odd-even effects. The calculated backshift parameter ∆ displays an oddeven staggering effect versus mass and is in better agreement with the experimental data than are the empirical values...|$|R

Peace as a necessary ingredient is needed for the survival, pr development of any society. The <b>family</b> being the <b>nucleus</b> and foundation of the society needs peace. The paper discusses ways of ensuring lasting peace in the family which invariably translates to peace in the society. It also takes a critical look at the causes of the bridge of peace within the family. Recommendations of some measures towards solving these problems are also made...|$|R
