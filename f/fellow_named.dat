500|$|The Scottish folk {{rock band}} Runrig {{recorded}} {{a song called}} [...] "Edge of the World" [...] on the album The Big Wheel, which dwells on the islanders' isolated existence.

2500|$|... “It was {{my first}} {{opportunity}} to see what I had only read about for so many years, {{and it was an}} experience so moving and exhilarating that I returned to the council with renewed vigor. I wrote to Robert Cushman, The Observer′s theatre critic, to find out exactly how the event was organized, and asked Ruth Goetz, a council-member who lived in London at the time, to do some detective work at the Court. She came up with the key to it all: a <b>fellow</b> <b>named</b> Gerald Chapman”.|$|E

2500|$|Abu Zayd {{called for}} another {{reading of the}} holy book through a [...] "humanistic hermeneutics", an {{interpretation}} which sees the Qur'an as a living phenomenon, a discourse. Hence, the Qur'an can be [...] "the outcome of dialogue, debate, despite argument, acceptance and rejection".

2500|$|Stacey's wealth {{enabled him}} to become a generous philanthropist and benefactor, and he put up the money and contributed to the design of the stained glass in the great west window of King's College Chapel, Cambridge in 1879, which had been left plain when the chapel's other stained-glass windows were {{constructed}} in the 16th century. In an article in The Spectator in 2003, Stacey's great-great-nephew, the writer and journalist Tom Stacey, wrote that the donation of the window, which depicts Doom, was considered within the family to have been a penance for Francis Stacey's dissolute lifestyle while at Cambridge. The article states that Stacey felt especial remorse over an incident in which, in advance of his own marriage, he bequeathed his town [...] "girl-friend" [...] to another King's <b>Fellow,</b> <b>named</b> Ridler – Fellows of King's College were expected to be celibate – but that Ridler had subsequently died in the girl-friend's bed; Stacey had been involved in a subterfuge which saw the dead Ridler returned to King's, where the body was [...] "discovered" [...] the following morning dead in his own bed.|$|E
2500|$|When he {{was still}} an infant, his parents moved to nearby Royston, where he was raised. By most accounts, he became fascinated with {{baseball}} as a child, and {{decided he wanted to}} play professional ball one day; his father was vehemently opposed to this idea, but by his teen years, he was trying out for area teams. He played his first years in organized baseball for the Royston Rompers, the semi-pro Royston Reds, and the Augusta Tourists of the South Atlantic League who released him after only two days. He then tried out for the Anniston Steelers of the semipro Tennessee–Alabama League, with his father's stern admonition ringing in his ears: [...] "Don't come home a failure!" [...] After joining the Steelers for a monthly salary of $50, Cobb promoted himself by sending several postcards written about his talents under different aliases to Grantland Rice, the sports editor of the Atlanta Journal. Eventually, Rice wrote a small note in the Journal that a [...] "young <b>fellow</b> <b>named</b> Cobb seems to be showing an unusual lot of talent." [...] After about three months, Cobb returned to the Tourists and finished the season hitting [...]237 in 35 games. In August 1905, the management of the Tourists sold Cobb to the American League's Detroit Tigers for US$750 (equivalent to approximately $ in today's funds).|$|E
