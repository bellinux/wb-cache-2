40|$|Iron oxy(hydr) oxides (oxides) are {{important}} mercury sinks in tropical oxisols and the geochemistry {{of these two}} elements are thus closely entwined. We hypothesized that bacterial Fe-oxide reduction in anoxic conditions could be a significant mechanism for mobilizing associated Hg. Iron oxide and mercury solubilisation in presence of two chemical reducers (ascorbate and dithionite, dissolving amorphous and amorphous plus well crystallized Fe-oxides, respectively) was compared to their solubilisation in presence of autochthonous ferri-reducing bacteria. This work was carried out on two soil profiles from a small catchment basin in French Guyana, an oxisol (O) from a well drained slope and a water-saturated <b>hydromorphic</b> <b>soil</b> (H). The chemical reductions showed that in the oxisol 20 and 48 % of total Hg (HgT) was associated to amorphous and well crystallized iron oxides, respectively. However, in the <b>hydromorphic</b> <b>soil,</b> no Hg seemed to be associated to amorphous iron oxides while the well crystallized fraction contained less than 9 % of HgT. Chemical Fe-oxide reduction showed that Hg solubility was correlated to Fe reduction in the oxisol, demonstrating {{a relationship between the}} geochemistry of these two metals. During bacterial growth, while bacterial iron reduction solubilised up to 3. 2 mg Fe g- 1 soil in the oxisol sample, HgT remained unchanged. No mercury was detected in the culture medium either.

40|$|Background and Purpose: The {{study of}} the particle-size {{distribution}} of <b>hydromorphic</b> <b>soil</b> and its relations to water and air qualities contributes to the better understanding {{and use of the}} land. The granulometric distribution has a significant impact on physical properties of the soil, such as: water-holding capacity, available water for plants, air capacity and residual porosity. The aim {{of this study was to}} show the relationship of texture composition and water retention under the pressure of - 0. 33, - 6. 25 and - 15. 00 bar, the capacity for air and available water for plants in different texture classes, and the relationship between the particle-size distribution and the content of a rough, medium, fine and ultra-fine pores in the excavated soil. Material and Methods: In order to analyze the relations of particle size distribution and air-water features of <b>hydromorphic</b> <b>soil,</b> the Middle Danube Region was researched. The following soil types were determined: fluvisol, humofluvisol, humogley and eugley. Soil samples were taken in degraded and natural state of soil profiles. Samples were analyzed in the laboratory of the Institute of Lowland Forestry and Environment, University of Novi Sad, with standard pedological methods. After the performed analysis, the mean air-water soil properties for different textural classes were calculated and presented. Results and Conclusion: According to the presented results of moisture retention at pressures of - 0. 33, - 6. 25 and - 15. 00 bar, it may be concluded that pressure treatments lead to an increase of moisture retention values ​​of the texture classes - sand to clay loam texture class, which is in close connection with the textural composition of the <b>hydromorphic</b> <b>soil</b> samples. The texture class of sand and loamy sand had the largest capacity for air, while the increased content of silt and clay decreased the air capacity and only slightly increased it in sandy clay loam and clay loam. Water available to plants was mostly present in the textural classes of sandy loam and loam. In the sand and loamy sand and sandy clay loams with clay loam the values ​​of this parameter were lower due to the unfavorable ratio of fractions in the textural composition. According to the content of the pores in various soil textural classes, the highest content of rough pores was found in the sand and loamy sand. The content of medium-sized pores increased with the proportion of silt and clay, it was largest in the sandy loam, loam and sandy clay loam.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The Albian Stage of the mid-Cretaceous {{was a time}} of equable climate {{conditions}} with high sea levels and broad shallow epeiric seas that may have had a moderating affect on continental climates. A Late Albian landscape surface that developed during a regression and subsequent sea-level rise in the Western Canada Foreland Basin is reconstructed on the basis of correlation of paleosols penetrated by cores through the Paddy Member of the Peace River Formation. Reconstruction of this landscape refines chronostratigraphic relationships and will benefit future paleoclima-tological studies utilizing continental sphaerosiderite proxy records. The paleosols developed in estuarine sandstones and mudstones, and they exhibit evidence of a polygenetic history. Upon initial exposure and pedogenesis, the Paddy Member developed deeply weathered, well-drained cumulative soil profiles.

In this study, we investigated the variations of the Fe concentrations and isotopic compositions combined with classical soil parameters, such as granulometry, pH, and C and N concentrations. We selected three soils submitted to different hydrodynamic functioning along a toposequence: a well-drained Cambisol and two <b>hydromorphic</b> <b>soils,</b> an Albeluvisol and a Gleysol. In the Cambisol, the isotopic variations were small indicating little redistribution of Fe which we attributed to centimetric-scale exchanges from the Si-bound to the weakly-bound iron pools and insignificant subsurface Fe export. In contrast, the <b>hydromorphic</b> <b>soils</b> showed an overall variation of 0. 37 ‰for δ 56 Fe and an inverse correlation between the Fe isotopic compositions and the oxide-bound Fe concentrations. We suggest that, in the uppermost horizon, the mobilisation of oxide-bound Fe {{was due to the}} reducing conditions and predominantly involved the light Fe isotopes. Similarly, within the Bt horizon of the Albeluvisol, the fluctuations of the water table level induced changes in the redox conditions and thus Fe dissolution and transport of isotopically light Fe. The Fe isotopic composition profile in the B/C horizon of the Gleysol is dominated by the signature of the parental material. Overall, the variations of the underground water table combined with topography-driven water flow were suggested to be the main mechanisms of Fe translocation in these <b>hydromorphic</b> <b>soils.</b> Finally, the comparison between Fe isotope profiles in worldwide soils allows us to show that Fe isotopic variations can help discriminate between various mechanisms and scales of Fe transfer in soils and, accordingly, provide information on the evolution of soils, when used in combination with pedological, geochemical, geographical, and environmental characterisations...|$|R

The Danube is the largest river in the Republic of Serbia. This is the first river which itself created an alluvial plain through the Pannonian plain. Due to the mild decrease of river bed slope and lateral erosion, which is a characteristic of lowland rivers, it formed a large dry alluvial plain. It was formed during the Holocene by alternating action of fluvial, erosion and accumulation processes. Materials and Methods: In this study, the following classes of <b>hydromorphic</b> <b>soils</b> in the protected area of alluvial plain of the river Danube were studied: undeveloped <b>hydromorphic</b> <b>soils</b> (fluvisol), semigley soils (humofluvisol) and gley soils (humogley and eugley). Four soil types were examined within the hydromorphic order of soils: fluvisol, humofluvisol, humogley and eugley. The measurements of groundwater level and of the water level of the Danube river were carried out twice a month {{during the growing season}} in the period of two years. The distance of piezometers from the Danube was also measured. By each piezometer, apedological profile was established. Its external and internalmorphology was described and soil samples were collected for laboratory testing. Laboratory examination of soil included analyses according to standard pedological methods. Results: The most important characteristics of the soils are presented in this study. The hydrological and physical characteristics are particularly described, especially the dynamics of groundwater during the growing period in two years, granulometric composition, differential porosity and Darcy’s coefficient.
