40|$|Abstract — Indonesia {{is one of}} the {{essential}} oil producers in the world. Ocimum Basillicum can be easily found in Indonesia, nevertheless the production of essential oil from this plant has not been explored widely, and therefore the aim of the research is to find the optimum condition for extraction of Ocimum Basillicum with two solvents, i. e. ethanol and n Hexane. In this study, the steam distillation was also applied to Ocimum Basillicum. Two grams of air dried Ocimum Basillicum leaves and stems and 400 mL of solvent were placed in the <b>extraction</b> <b>flask,</b> equipped with stirrer and waterbath to control the temperature. Samples (1 mL) were taken every 5 minutes, until the equilibrium was reached. Concentration of essential oil in the solvent was determined by using UV-visible spectrophotometer. The same procedure was run for thre...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Trace {{concentrations}} of iron oxide minerals in carbonate sediments can preserve fine details about Earth processes, from high-resolution {{recordings of the}} Earth’s ancient magnetic field to microscopic remnants of extraterrestrial impacts. This paper presents a novel <b>flask</b> <b>extraction</b> method which uses a neodymium magnet and an orbital shaker for simple and efficient separation of magnetic minerals from carbonate sediments. A mineral assemblage of magnetic standards (titanomagnetite, magnetite, goethite, and hematite) combined with other mineral standards (kaolinite, quartz, and nanoscale TiO 2) was subjected to the extraction procedure and compared to a natural speleothem sample. Exposure of the magnetic standards to a mildly acidic acetate buffer (pH, 4) did not cause physical or chemical alteration. The strongly magnetic minerals were reproducibly extracted, with greater than 90 % efficiency (by mass), from mixtures of the mineral standards. XRD and low-temperature magnetic characterization demonstrated phase purity of the extracts. Quantitative comparison with two commonly used literature methods showed that the <b>flask</b> <b>extraction</b> method was more reproducible and efficient. The addition of surfactant (Na(PO 3) 6) did not significantly improve extraction efficiency. Sequential dissolution and <b>flask</b> <b>extraction</b> of a simulated speleothem containing magnetic particles resulted in consistent extraction efficiencies for samples containing large (. 1 mm) strongly magnetic grains, but a reduction in efficiency was observed for smaller (, 1 mm) grain sizes. No method successfully extracted the weakly magnetic goethite and hematite. However, unprecedented, representative characterization of these minerals wa...|$|R
30|$|Wood meal (0.180 – 0.355  mm mesh size) was {{obtained}} from the heartwood of the discs. Air-dried wood meal (5 – 10  g) from each tree was put in a 300  ml Erlenmeyer flask, and then 10  ml n-hexane per 1  g of air-dried wood meal was added to the <b>flask.</b> For <b>extraction,</b> the <b>flasks</b> containing wood meal and n-hexane were agitated for 24  h by a shaker (NR- 150, Taitec, Japan). Extraction was repeated three times. The solvent was evaporated using a rotary evaporator (N- 1100, EYELA, Japan), and then the n-hexane extracts were dried in a desiccator in vacuo using a vacuum pump (GCD- 136 X, ULVAC).|$|R
40|$|Extraction {{and product}} {{recovery}} {{are the most}} crucial steps in evaluation of valuable active compounds from various plant parts. In this study,extraction of gallic acid from Jatropha curcas stem bark was investigated. The aims {{of this study were}} to study the extraction parameters using four different extraction techniques,to estimate the kinetic studies of gallic acid,to optimize the ultrasonic-assisted extraction(UAE) parameters and to compare the efficiency of extraction techniques. Two conventional extraction techniques were employed such as shake <b>flask</b> <b>extraction</b> and Soxhlet extraction. Ultrasonic-assisted extraction(UAE) and microwave-assisted extraction(MAE) were the modern extraction techniques utilized. The effect of solvent composition, extraction time,extraction temperature and power for UAE and MAE were the extraction parameters used in the extraction studies. For the shake <b>flask</b> <b>extraction</b> and Soxhlet extraction,two parameters namely as effect of solvent composition and extraction time were evaluated. The extracts were further undergone analysis process. Quantification of gallic acid in the extracts was done using high-performance liquid chromatography(HPLC). In general,all the extraction techniques were capable of isolating gallic acid from the bark,but the recovery obtained using modern techniques was higher than the conventional techniques. It was found that all the parameters studied had given significant effect towards the yield of gallic acid. Kinetic studies were done to estimate the washing coefficient and the slow extraction coefficient. Washing of extractive substances from the surface of plant particles phenomena is happening before it reaches equilibrium and then slow extraction process is happening until it reaches equilibrium. In optimization part, the parameters of UAE(solvent composition,extraction temperature and extraction time) were optimized using Box-Behnken Design(BBD). The optimal conditions were as follows: solvent composition of 49. 97 %, extraction temperature of 35. 7 oC and extraction time of 50. 71 min. Under these conditions,the experimental yield of gallic acid was 21. 6253 ± 0. 0528 % mg gallic acid/ 100 g bark,which was agreed close to the predicted value 21. 6367 mg gallic acid/ 100 g bark. The efficiency of the extraction techniques increased in the following order:shake <b>flask</b> <b>extraction</b> >Soxhlet > UAE > MAE...|$|R
40|$|In this work, a new stirred reactor was {{designed}} and then a comparative study of bioleaching using stirred reactor and shake flask was carried out to investigate the bioleaching performance of the new stirred reactor. Results showed that variations of redox potentials and acid consumptions during were similar in the two systems, and about 15 % more copper extraction {{can be obtained by}} stirred reactor. Bacterial concentration increased more sharply in the initial stage of bioleaching in stirred reactor. Analytical results showed that a worse passivation caused by larger amount of jarosite and elemental sulfur on the minerals surface leaded the lower copper <b>extraction</b> in shake <b>flask.</b> Electrochemical analysis revealed that the conductivity of bioleaching residues of shake flasks is lower than that of bioleaching residues of stirred reactor. Stirred reactor possesses significant advantages over shake flask in bioleaching of chalcopyrite concentrates can be caused mainly by better mass transfer effect, better air inflation effect and stronger shear force. Therefore, the stirred reactor can be used for both enlarge cultivation of bacteria and tank bioleaching of ores. Electrochemical measurements revealed that chalcopyrite dissolution was preferred to be a continuous reduction-oxidation pathway, in which chalcopyrite was initially reduced and then oxidized, and the initial reduction reaction was the rate-limiting step...|$|R
40|$|Conversion of {{cellulose}} into furanic products. 1, 2 -Dichloroethane (500 mL) was {{introduced into the}} extraction chamber of a standard apparatus for continuous extraction with a solvent heavier than water. A homogeneous suspension of microcrystalline cellulose (2. 05 g, 5 % water by mass) was prepared in a solution of lithium chloride (10 g) in concentrated hydrochloric acid (150 mL), and this {{was added to the}} extraction chamber. A boiling flask containing 1, 2 -dichloroethane (150 mL) and anhydrous sodium sulfate was attached to the apparatus and the solvent was heated to reflux. The aqueous slurry was heated at 65 o C with continuous mechanical stirring and subjected to continuous extraction for 18 h. At this point, further LiCl (5 g) in concentrated hydrochloric acid (75 mL) was added to the extraction chamber and extraction was continued for another 12 h. During the <b>extraction</b> the boiling <b>flask</b> was emptied every 6 h and replaced with fresh 1, 2 -dichloroethane (150 mL).
