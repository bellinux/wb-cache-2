The Forest has many mysterious aspects, and is dominated by shape-shifting or carnivorous trees, including Benjamin Heap, wolverines, and secrets. The Forest has a secret way to transport a character to the path leading to the House of Foryx.

25|$|The Americans with Disabilities Act sets certain {{standards}} for building access and other design considerations in all new construction and major renovations in the U.S. An architectural barrier is any feature that makes access {{or use of}} a building difficult, unreasonably dangerous or impossible. This can include aisles that are too narrow for easy access by a wheelchair. Often, {{the only way to}} get from a row of chairs, shelves, workstations, etc., to an exit is by an aisle. Historically, many deaths and serious injuries have occurred due to fire, inhalation of smoke or noxious fumes, etc., because blocked or partially blocked aisles prevented persons from promptly leaving a <b>dangerous</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E

The British inquiry also took far greater expert testimony, making it the longest and most detailed court of inquiry in British history up to that time. The two inquiries reached broadly similar conclusions: the regulations {{on the number of}} lifeboats that ships had to carry were out of date and inadequate, Captain Smith had failed to take proper heed of ice warnings, the lifeboats had not been properly filled or crewed, and the collision was the direct result of steaming into a <b>dangerous</b> <b>area</b> at too high a speed.|$|E

25|$|The second ship, Amelia Thompson, arrived off the Taranaki coast on 3 September and sat {{off shore}} {{for five weeks}} because its captain feared Ngamotu's {{reputation}} as a dangerous shipping area. Its 187 passengers were helped ashore by Barrett and his men {{over the course of}} two weeks, each small boatload taking five hours to row from the vessel to the shore. The ship's precious food cargo, including flour and salted meat, was finally brought ashore for New Plymouth's starving residents on 30 September. The loss of its baggage ship, the Regina, which was blown ashore on to a reef, contributed to New Plymouth's reputation as a <b>dangerous</b> <b>area</b> for shipping, discouraging other vessels from berthing.|$|E
25|$|Secondary flight {{controls}} include the rotor transmission clutch, {{also known as}} a pre-rotator, which when engaged drives the rotor to start it spinning before takeoff, and collective pitch to reduce blade pitch before driving the rotor. Collective pitch controls are not usually fitted to autogyros, but {{can be found on the}} Air & Space 18A and McCulloch J-2 and the Westermayr Tragschrauber and are capable of near VTOL performance. Unlike a helicopter, autogyros without collective pitch or another jump start facility need a runway to take off; however, they are capable of landing with a very short or zero ground roll. Like helicopters, each autogyro has a specific height–velocity diagram for safest operation, although the <b>dangerous</b> <b>area</b> is usually smaller than for helicopters.|$|E

Chris Helgren, then Reuters' chief photographer in the region, launched a plan to employ and train Iraqis, with more local knowledge and access to areas now perilous for Westerners. Helgren said: [...] "There are few 'good news' stories to be had in this war and wars by definition are tales of violence. And to get there, drivers like Saeed Chmagh are indispensable.” [...] "Saeed had a reputation of being fiercely loyal and appeared fearless to me.

2500|$|In March 2003, {{coalition}} forces started {{the invasion of}} Iraq that would become the Iraq War, lasting until 2011. Combat operations were announced by the then-President of the United States, George W. Bush, as being over on 1 May 2003. The south-eastern region of Iraq {{became part of the}} United Kingdom's Multi-National Division (South East) (MND (SE)) under the framework of Operation Telic. As part of their remit, the British forces were keen to remove all heavy weaponry from the region (anti-tank weapons, RPGs etc) and did so purposely. Whilst most of the weapons and ammunition were removed from private houses in the region, smaller weapons, such as AK-47s and handguns, were left with the families for their own protection. The local Iraqis had argued this point and demanded that they be left with some protection in what was a <b>dangerous</b> <b>area</b> post-invasion. One local man was quoted as saying [...] "If Saddam Hussein could not take away our weapons, why should we allow the British to do so?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Bushwick was now {{left without}} a {{commercial}} retail hub. After the blackout, more middle-class residents who could afford to leave did so, in some cases abandoning their homes. New immigrants continued {{to move to the}} area, many of whom were from Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and, more recently, Central America. However, apartment renovation and new construction did not keep pace with the demolition of unsafe buildings, forcing overcrowded conditions at first. As buildings came down, the vacant lots made parts of the neighborhood look and feel desolate, and more residents left. With a lack of job opportunities, Bushwick became an epicenter for the illegal drug trade. Author Jonathan Mahler described the social and economic hardships of Bushwick after the blackout in his book [...] "Ladies and Gentlemen, the Bronx is Burning", explaining how the majority of neighborhood residents were living on less than $4,000 a year, relying on some form of public assistance. The neighborhood was a hotbed of poverty and crime by the 1980s. During this period, the Knickerbocker Avenue shopping district was nicknamed [...] "The Well" [...] for its seemingly unending supply of drugs. In the 1990s, it remained a poor and relatively <b>dangerous</b> <b>area,</b> with 77 murders, 80 rapes, and 2,242 robberies in 1990.|$|E

2500|$|Section 1 {{establishes}} {{the duty of}} care, which is owed to [...] "persons other than [...] visitors", who will predominantly be trespassers but this also applies to anyone exercising rights under various statutes dealing {{with access to the}} countryside and anyone accessing a private right of way, but does not apply to anyone using a public right of way in which case the common law rules apply. Under Section 1(3) of the Act, the duty is owed when the occupier is aware of the danger, or has reasonable grounds to believe it exist, knows or has reasonable grounds to believe that the trespasser is near or may come to be near the danger and the risk is one which an occupier may reasonably be expected to protect visitors from. This clause was first considered by the courts in White v The Council of the City and District of St. Albans , where the claimant had taken a shortcut across the defendant's fenced-off land and fell into a trench. He argued that the defendant taking precautions to stop people getting into the <b>dangerous</b> <b>area</b> meant that he believed somebody was likely to do so, and was therefore liable. The Court of Appeal rejected this argument, saying that just because a defendant had tried to prevent people entering dangerous land did not mean that the [...] "reasonable grounds to believe" [...] have been satisfied. Under Section 1(2), the duty is owed when the occupier is the occupier of any fixed or moveable structure, including ships and aircraft; the same as in the 1957 Act.|$|E
2500|$|A {{conglomeration}} of disused, condemned buildings clustered {{together to}} form a self-contained habitat, Limitless Fortress is subdivided into three specific tiers – Lower Town, the Beltline and Babylon City. Lower Town is the lowest in altitude, with several layers extending below ground level. The Beltline, the most <b>dangerous</b> <b>area</b> of The Limitless Fortress, is ruled by Der Kaiser, Ban's father. Babylon City, the upper most level of the Limitless Fortress, is said to be where the Brain Trust resides, and is the home of Ginji's mother. In actuality, Babylon City is what one might consider the real world, with everything else being a virtual reality creation. Only those who have won the Ogre Battle may enter Babylon City and when that happens, they can change the world as they see fit. Both Ban and Ginji go to the Fortress with Ban wishing to rescue a kidnapped Himiko from Kagami, and Ginji finding a possibility to meet his mother. Going to the Beltline, the GetBackers encounter various warriors taking orders from a being known as Voodoo King from Babylon City. The Voodoo King seeks to obtain three [...] "keys" [...] which will help him unlock the gates from Babylon City sealed by Ban's grandmother several years ago. After finding the three keys: Shido's chimera spirit, Himiko's mirror and the GetBackers, the Voodoo King is faced by Ginji, Thunder Emperor alter-ego attacks him in a clash which destroys the Voodoo King and making Raitei disappear forever as he existed to balance the scales. With Voodoo King gone, Raitei's purpose was fulfilled and he disappeared forever. Following this, both Ban and Ginji face each other in Ogre Battle with Ban giving up, impressed with Ginji's will. Ginji goes to Babylon City where he meets his mother from a parallel universe, who explains how she created the Fortress and its surrounding [...] world. Following a discussion between the two of them, the Fortress' world remains unchanged except that the virtual people living become real beings. Ban and Ginji continue their retrieval job, ending the series when requested to go on a mission that will lead them to meet Ban's mother.|$|E
