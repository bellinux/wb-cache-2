25|$|From monoids {{and groups}} to rings The {{integral}} monoid ring construction gives a <b>functor</b> from monoids to rings. This <b>functor</b> is left adjoint to the <b>functor</b> that associates {{to a given}} ring its underlying multiplicative monoid. Similarly, the integral group ring construction yields a <b>functor</b> from groups to rings, left adjoint to the <b>functor</b> that assigns to a given ring its group of units. One can also start with a field K and consider the category of K-algebras instead of the category of rings, to get the monoid and group rings over K.|$|E
25|$|Formally, complexification is a <b>functor</b> VectR → VectC, {{from the}} {{category}} of real vector spaces to {{the category of}} complex vector spaces.

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, I give several {{characterizations}} of rational biset <b>functors</b> over p-groups, which {{are independent of}} the knowledge of genetic bases for p-groups. I also introduce a construction of new biset <b>functors</b> from known ones, {{which is similar to}} the Yoneda construction for representable <b>functors,</b> and to the Dress construction for Mackey <b>functors,</b> and I show that this construction preserves the class of rational p-biset <b>functors.</b> This leads to a characterization of rational p-biset <b>functors</b> as additive <b>functors</b> fro...|$|R
40|$|We {{prove that}} Ringel duality in the {{category}} of strict polynomial <b>functors</b> can be interpreted as derived <b>functors</b> of non-additive <b>functors</b> (in the sense of Dold and Puppe). We give applications of this fact for both theories. Comment: Fourth version, 48 pages. Minor changes (typos corrected, comments and references added). The article is self-contained (no prior knowledge of Schur algebras, strict polynomial <b>functors</b> or derived <b>functors</b> of non-additive <b>functors</b> is required...|$|R

50|$|Almost all <b>functors</b> studied between {{additive}} {{categories are}} additive. In fact, it is a theorem that all adjoint <b>functors</b> between additive categories must be additive <b>functors</b> (see here), and most interesting <b>functors</b> studied {{in all of}} category theory are adjoints.|$|R

25|$|Direct and inverse {{images of}} sheaves Every {{continuous}} map f : X → Y between topological spaces induces a <b>functor</b> f ∗ from {{the category of}} sheaves (of sets, or abelian groups, or rings...) on X to the corresponding category of sheaves on Y, the direct image <b>functor.</b> It also induces a <b>functor</b> f −1 from the category of sheaves of abelian groups on Y to the category of sheaves of abelian groups on X, the inverse image <b>functor.</b> f −1 is left adjoint to f ∗. Here a more subtle {{point is that the}} left adjoint for coherent sheaves will differ from that for sheaves (of sets).|$|E
25|$|A presheaf on a {{topological space}} X is a {{contravariant}} <b>functor</b> from {{the category of}} open subsets to sets. By analogy we define an étale presheaf on a scheme X to be a contravariant <b>functor</b> from Et(X) to sets.|$|E
25|$|Note that {{fixing the}} first {{argument}} of Hom naturally {{gives rise to}} a covariant <b>functor</b> and fixing the second argument naturally gives a contravariant <b>functor.</b> This is an artifact {{of the way in which}} one must compose the morphisms.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSeparable <b>functors</b> were {{introduced}} by C. Năstăsescu et al. (J. Algebra 123 (1989) 397 – 413). We characterize separability of {{left or right}} adjoint <b>functors</b> defined on a Grothendieck category having a set of projective generators. This general results are particularized to the canonical <b>functors</b> arising from a graded homomorphism of group-graded rings (restriction of scalars, induction and coinduction <b>functors).</b> We relate the separability of these <b>functors</b> with that of their ungraded versions.

50|$|Conversely, the {{following}} characterization of derived <b>functors</b> holds: given {{a family of}} <b>functors</b> Ri: A → B, satisfying the above, i.e. mapping short exact sequences to long exact sequences, such that for every injective object I of A, Ri(I)=0 for every positive i, then these <b>functors</b> are the right derived <b>functors</b> of R0.|$|R
25|$|The <b>functor</b> {{category}} D'C has {{as objects}} the functors from C to D and as morphisms the natural transformations of such functors. The Yoneda lemma {{is one of}} the most famous basic results of category theory; it describes representable functors in <b>functor</b> categories.|$|E
25|$|Doing this constructions pointwise {{gives the}} tangent space, a {{covariant}} <b>functor</b> from {{the category of}} pointed differentiable manifolds to the category of real vector spaces. Likewise, cotangent space is a contravariant <b>functor,</b> essentially {{the composition of the}} tangent space with the dual space above.|$|E
25|$|Yoneda's lemma {{implies that}} every natural {{transformation}} between Hom functors is of this form. In other words, the Hom functors {{give rise to}} a full and faithful embedding of the category C into the <b>functor</b> category SetC'Op (covariant or contravariant depending on which Hom <b>functor</b> is used).|$|E

40|$|The paper studies {{analytic}} <b>functors</b> between presheaf categories. Generalising {{results of}} A. Joyal and of R. Hasegawa for analytic endofunctors on {{the category of}} sets, we give two characterisations of analytic <b>functors</b> between presheaf categories over groupoids: (i) as <b>functors</b> preserving filtered colimits, quasi-pullbacks, and cofiltered limits; and (ii) as <b>functors</b> preserving filtered colimits and wide quasi-pullbacks. The development establishes that small groupoids, analytic <b>functors</b> between their presheaf categories, and quasi-cartesian natural transformations between them form a 2 -category...|$|R

25|$|Adjoint functors: A <b>functor</b> {{can be left}} (or right) adjoint {{to another}} <b>functor</b> that maps in the {{opposite}} direction. Such a pair of adjoint functors typically arises from a construction defined by a universal property; {{this can be seen}} as a more abstract and powerful view on universal properties.|$|E
25|$|Any ring R can {{be viewed}} as a preadditive {{category}} with a single object. With this understanding, a left R-module is nothing but a (covariant) additive <b>functor</b> from R to the category Ab of abelian groups. Right R-modules are contravariant additive functors. This suggests that, if C is any preadditive category, a covariant additive <b>functor</b> from C to Ab should be considered a generalized left module over C; these functors form a <b>functor</b> category C-Mod which is the natural generalization of the module category R-Mod.|$|E
25|$|Homological algebra {{began to}} be studied in its most basic form in the 1800s as a branch of topology, but it wasn't until the 1940s that it became an {{independent}} subject with the study of objects such as the ext <b>functor</b> and the tor <b>functor,</b> among others.|$|E

We show that, if an unstable module M supports an action of an unstable algebra K, then the derived <b>functors</b> of the iterated loop <b>functors</b> applied to M support actions of iterated doubles of K.
