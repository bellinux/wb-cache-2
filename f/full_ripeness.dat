5|$|In California, {{the main}} stylistic {{difference}} in Cabernet Sauvignon is between hillside/mountain vineyards {{and those on}} flatter terrain like valley floors or {{some areas of the}} Central Valley. In Napa, the hillside vineyards of Diamond Mountain District, Howell Mountain, Mt. Veeder, Spring Mountain District have thinner, less fertile soils which produces smaller berries with more intense flavors, reminiscent of Bordeaux wines that require years of aging to mature. The yields are also much lower, typically in the range of 1–2 tons per acre in contrast to the 4–8 tons that can be produced in the more fertile valley floors. Wines produced from mountainside vineyards tend to be characterized by deep inky colors and strong berry aromas. Throughout California there are many wine regions that have the potential to grow Cabernet Sauvignon to <b>full</b> <b>ripeness</b> and produce fruity, full-bodied wines with alcohol levels regularly above the Bordeaux average of 12–13%—often in excess of 14%.|$|E

25|$|Like {{most of the}} Loire, {{the main}} red grape of Saint-Nicolas-de-Bourgueil is Cabernet franc (known locally as Breton) with Cabernet Sauvignon {{accounting}} for an increasing amount of plantings. Vineyards are densely planted with 5000 grapevines per hectare. Both Cabernet varieties are usually trained to the guyot simple system with one long cane pruned to seven or eight buds each winter. Both grapes are late-ripening varieties that require a long growing season ideally ending with an Indian summer {{in order to achieve}} <b>full</b> <b>ripeness.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Verduzzo vine {{tends to}} thrive on {{hillside}} vineyard locations that have good {{exposure to the}} sun which gives this mid to late-ripening variety ample time to achieve <b>full</b> physiological <b>ripeness.</b> The grape tends to be very resistant to botrytis and bunch rot which lends itself well {{to the production of}} late harvest wines.|$|R
50|$|Bariadorgia is a mid-ripening grape {{variety that}} needs to be planted on sunny, well-situated sites in warm climate regions in order to achieve <b>full</b> {{physiological}} <b>ripeness.</b> The vine tends to produce big clusters of large size berries but usually has a relatively low sugar levels. Bariadorgia is highly sensitive to the viticultural hazards of botrytis bunch rot and powdery mildew.|$|R
50|$|These {{wines are}} made from the classic {{sparkling}} wine grape varieties. In England these varieties reach <b>full</b> phenolic <b>ripeness</b> at moderate sugar levels and with high acid levels. Wines from this PDO are made entirely from must containing only natural acid. These wines exhibit stronger aromatic flavours of the underlying grape varieties than wines from the same varieties grown at warmer latitudes.|$|R
25|$|Carignan is a late budding {{and late}} {{ripening}} variety {{that is often}} {{one of the last}} grapes to be harvested during a vintage. The vine is very vigorous and high yielding, able to easily produce 200 hectoliters/hectare (approximately 10.4 tons/acres), if not kept in check by winter pruning or green harvesting during the growing season. The late ripening nature of the grape means that it rarely achieves <b>full</b> <b>ripeness</b> unless planted in vineyard soils in very warm climates such as the Mediterranean climates where the grape originated in or the hot Central Valley of California.|$|E
25|$|The Chenin blanc grapevine buds {{early in}} the growing season and ripens mid to late in the harvest year. However, in warm years, the balance between the Loire's {{marginal}} climate and the warmth needed to attain <b>full</b> <b>ripeness</b> {{has the potential of}} producing wines with some depth of complexity and finesse. The age of the vine can have an influence on wine quality, with older vines producing naturally lower yields. When infected by noble rot, which also lowers yields and adds and intensifies certain flavors, the wines develop less overtly floral aroma notes but more depth and layers.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the success}} of the Concord, Sauer {{branched}} out and began experimenting with Vitis vinifera including Sémillon and Chenin blanc. These early vinifera plantings didn't survive in the rich-soil that they Concords were planted and soon Sauer began looking at the steep hills with poorer soils. In 1973, when a friend had a buyer back out at the last minutes on Cabernet Sauvignon cuttings, Sauer took the cuttings and planted 3 acres even though he didn't know at the time if Cabernet Sauvignon was a white wine grape or a red wine grape. During this same time, Sauer was working with Dr. Walter Clore of the WSU extension and research facility in Prosser to plant an experimental vineyard of grapes like Chardonnay, Gewürztraminer, Riesling and other varieties {{to see what kind of}} grapes could survive the cold Yakima Valley winters and grow to <b>full</b> <b>ripeness.</b>|$|E
500|$|Since {{the end of}} apartheid, the South African wine {{industry}} has been working to reestablish itself in the world's wine markets with many regions actively promoting their Cabernet Sauvignon. Today {{it is the most}} widely planted red wine grape in South Africa. It is produced in both varietal and blended styles; [...] some producers favor a Bordeaux blend, while others follow the Australian example of blending with Syrah. Early examples of South African Cabernet Sauvignon were produced by grapes planted in vineyard locations that were cooler than ideal, creating very herbaceous wines with the distinctive [...] "green bell pepper" [...] notes. In the mid-1990s, there was more emphasis on harvesting at <b>fuller</b> <b>ripeness,</b> and new clones were introduced that produced riper, sweeter fruit. As the vines age, and better vineyards locations are identified, regional styles are starting to emerge among South African Cabernet Sauvignons: the Stellenbosch region is noted for heavy, full bodied wines while Constantia's wines are characterized by their herbal and minty flavors.|$|R
50|$|Arrouya noir is a late-ripening grape {{variety that}} can be very {{vigorous}} and high yielding if not kept in check by winter pruning and late season green harvesting. It's late-ripening nature means that it can be very sensitive to the conditions of a vintage and may not reach <b>full</b> physiological <b>ripeness</b> every year. The vine tends to produce small, compact bunches that are vulnerable to infections by botrytis bunch rot. Other viticultural hazards that Arrouya noir is susceptible to include black rot and downy mildew.|$|R
50|$|Professor Manzoni's {{original}} {{intent was to}} create a white wine grape variety from a crossing of Prosecco and Sauvignon blanc but ended up using pollen from Cabernet Sauvignon which resulted in a black-skinned grape variety. Manzoni 2.15 is a winter-hardy grape variety with good frost resistance that can be very vigorous unless kept in check by winter pruning, vine training and leaf-pulling. Like its parent, Cabernet Sauvignon, it is a late ripening grape that needs a long growing season to achieve <b>full</b> physiological <b>ripeness.</b>|$|R
500|$|Delius's next work, Appalachia, {{introduces}} a further feature that recurred in later pieces—the {{use of the}} voice instrumentally in wordless singing, in this case depicting the distant plantation songs that had inspired Delius at Solano Grove. Although Payne argues that Appalachia shows only a limited advance in technique, Fenby identifies one orchestral passage as the first expression of Delius's idea of [...] "the transitoriness of all mortal things mirrored in nature". Hereafter, whole works rather than brief passages would be informed by this idea. The transitional phase of the composer's career concludes with three further vocal pieces: Sea Drift (1903), A Mass of Life (1904–05), and Songs of Sunset (1906–07). Payne salutes each of these as masterpieces, in which the Delian style struggles to emerge in its <b>full</b> <b>ripeness.</b> Fenby describes A Mass of Life as standing outside the general progression of Delius's work, [...] "a vast parenthesis", unlike anything else he wrote, but nevertheless an essential ingredient in his development.|$|E
2500|$|Cabernet Franc in Hungary {{had gained}} {{attention}} {{by the end}} of the 1990s when in some wine producing regions climate and growing conditions proved to be not optimal for Cabernet Sauvignon to reach its <b>full</b> <b>ripeness.</b> Successful varietal examples from Villány and Szekszárd show great potential, some international experts declared that Cabernet Franc [...] "found its new home in Villány region". Hungarian varietal Cabernet Franc is a typically full-bodied, moderately or highly tannic wine with rich aromas of spices, blue flowers and red/black berry fruits with a reasonably good aging potential of about 10 years. These wines typically undergo 12 to 18 months of aging in new Hungarian oak barrels.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, a local farmer named Clemente Santi {{isolated}} certain plantings of Sangiovese vines {{in order to}} produce a 100% varietal wine that could be aged for a considerable period of time. [...] In 1888, his grandson Ferruccio Biondi-Santi-a veteran soldier who fought under Giuseppe Garibaldi during the Risorgimento-released the first [...] "modern version" [...] of Brunello di Montalcino, which was aged for over a decade in large wood barrels. By the mid-20th century, this 100% varietal Sangiovese was eagerly being sought out by critics and wine drinkers alike. The Montalcino region seems to have ideal conditions for ripening Sangiovese with the potential for <b>full</b> <b>ripeness</b> achievable even on north-facing slopes.

25|$|The {{popularity}} of Carignan was largely tied to {{its ability to}} produce very large yields {{in the range of}} 200 hl/ha (11 tons/acre). The vine does face significant viticultural hazards with significant sensitivity to several viticultural hazards including rot, powdery mildew, downy mildew, and grape worms. Carignan is a late budding and ripening grape which requires a warm climate in order to achieve <b>full</b> physiological <b>ripeness.</b> The vine also develops very thick stalk around the grape clusters which makes mechanical harvesting difficult. It has an upright growth habit and can be grown without a trellis.|$|R

This concerns both acidic and basic proteins. In electrophoretic separation of ribosomal proteins from embryos of fully ripe seeds by the method of two-dimensional electrophoresis the appearance of three new low molecular weight proteins - an acidic one and two basic ones - was observed. These proteins were not found in the embryos of caryopses of milk ripeness. These results indicate that with development and ripening of wheat caryopses new low molecular weight ribosomal proteins are built into the ribosomes in the embryo.

2500|$|Despite {{receiving}} {{the same amount}} of sunshine as the Chablis region, Chardonnay grapes in Champagne rarely attain <b>full</b> <b>ripeness</b> due to the mean temperature of the region being around , barely above the minimum average temperature needed to ripen grapes.

However, it does lessen the premium on needing to keep yields low that other wine regions [...] battle, since not much flavor is going to develop in the grapes, anyway. Rather, the element in Chardonnay that Champagne wine-makers look for is the finesse and balance of acidity that it brings to the blend. Some flavors that can emerge from, particularly with extended time on its lees, include creamy and nuttiness with some floral notes.|$|E

40|$|In {{developing}} instrumentation for {{the measurement}} of fruit quality, there {{is the need for}} fast and non-destructive devices, based on sensors, to be installed on-line. In the case of some fruits, like peaches, post-harvest ripeness, which is closely related to high quality for the consumer, is a priority. During ripening, external appearance (colour) and internal mechanical (firmness) and chemical (sugars and acids) quality are main features that evolve rapidly from and unripe to a ripe (high quality) stage. When considering the evolution of fruit quality in this scheme, external colour and firmness are shown to evolve in a parallel pattern, if monitored from the time of harvest to <b>full</b> consumer <b>ripeness</b> (Rood, 1957; Crisosto et al, 1995; Kader, 1996).

40|$|Delays in {{initiating}} the cooling of freshly harvested `Chandler' strawberries (Fragaria xananassa) {{were compared with}} prompt cooling to determine how such handling affected development of postharvest decays during subsequent storage and marketing. Strawberries at the three-quarter to <b>full</b> red <b>ripeness</b> stages were harvested four times between mid-June and late July, inoculated with Botrytis cinerea or Rhizopus stolonifer and then handled to simulate prompt or delayed precooling prior to storage. This was done by incubating fruit at 35 °C (95. 0 °F) and 70 % to 80 % relative humidity (RH) for 1 or 6 hours. The fruit were then forced-air cooled to 5 °C (41. 0 °F) in 1 hour and stored for 7 days at 2 °C (35. 6 °F) and 85 % to 95 % RH, plus displayed in a simulated market at 20 °C (68. 0 °F) and 85 % RH for 1 day. Decay incidence increased as the season progressed. For non-inoculated fruit, prompt cooling reduced the incidence of decay {{by an average of}} 25 % and the decay severity by ~ 24 %. With inoculated fruit, prompt cooling resulted in 15 % and 29 % decreases in the incidence and severity, respectively, of rhizopus rot compared to delayed cooling, and 5 % and 22 % decreases in the incidence and severity, respectively, of botrytis rot. Overall, the incidence of botrytis and rhizopus fruit rot averaged 60 % and 85 % in the prompt and delayed cooling treatments, respectively. Although prompt cooling is important for minimizing postharvest decay of strawberries, temperature management alone may not sufficiently control postharvest decay when decay pressure is high...|$|R

40|$|The New Zealand flower thrips, Thrips obscuratus (Crawford) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), is an {{important}} seasonal pest of peaches infesting flowers during spring and mature fruit prior to, and during fruit harvest. Thrips numbers were monitored during peach flowering and prior to fruit harvest in a 160 tree experimental orchard, using water traps, sticky traps on tree limbs, and by direct sampling of flowers and fruit. Thrips numbers in water traps in the spring were low compared to summer samples. Adult thrips were found in peach flowers from pink to shuck fall with peak numbers during full bloom. Relatively low numbers of thrips were caught on sticky traps placed on tree stems in the spring which supports the notion that thrips numbers in the spring are low. Very high numbers of thrips (> 1, 000 thrips/ trap/ week) were caught in water traps prior to, and during fruit harvest. Adult thrips were found on peach fruit from three weeks prior to harvest with peak numbers at <b>full</b> fruit <b>ripeness.</b> During rain thrips moved to protected areas {{on the bottom of}} the fruit presumably to avoid being washed off the fruit. The association between thrips and Monilinia fructicola (Winter) Honey inoculum sites was studied using sticky traps placed near twig cankers and fruit mummies, and by counting thrips numbers on brown rot diseased sporulating fruit. Adult thrips were caught on sticky traps placed near brown rot infected twig cankers in the spring and summer, and on sticky traps placed near brown rot infected fruit mummies in the spring. Spring sticky trap catches showed a similar trend to water trap catches with peak thrips numbers caught in traps when the flowers were at or near shuck fall. Summer sticky trap catches were much higher than spring catches. Thrips were found on brown rot infected sporulating peach fruit in comparable numbers to thrips found on healthy peach fruit. Peak numbers of adult thrips were found on diseased fruit with a low sporulation severity. At high sporulation severities few thrips were found on diseased fruit. A thrips-washing method was developed and viable M. fructicola spores were enumerated on thrips removed from twig cankers, fruit mummies, and fruit exhibiting sporulating brown rot lesions. Two methods were developed to follow thrips dispersal of M. fructicola in and between peach trees in the spring and summer. Feeding thrips rubidium and assaying thrips for rubidium content was feasible in the laboratory, but due to the high number of thrips required for field experiments and associated difficulties in feeding large numbers of thrips rubidium, the method was not suitable for following thrips dispersal in the field. Thrips treated with spores of a fungicide-resistant strain of M. fructicola dispersed spores to flowers and fruit in the field with disease resulting. In all experiments most fungicide-resistant strain diseased flowers and fruit were found on the tree the thrips had been released onto, followed by trees in the same row as the release tree, and then across tree rows. Controlled environment studies showed increasing brown rot disease incidence and severity in flowers with increasing numbers of thrips per flower and increasing spore loads on the thrips. Thrips deposited spores onto fungicide-treated fruit which resulted in disease, thereby apparently negating the benefits of fungicide protection. A field experiment was conducted to compare the incidence of brown rot disease in peaches at harvest in the presence and absence of thrips. Brown rot disease incidence on fruit at harvest where thrips were excluded by using an insecticide was significantly (P < 0. 05) lower than on fruit where water was applied and thrips numbers were higher. Laboratory experiments showed that thrips did not predispose flowers to infection and disease as thrips applied as a pre-treatment to flowers prior to M. fructicola spore application did not increase disease incidence. A possible explanation for this was the high susceptibility of flowers to infection. A single spore application method was developed and single spores were found to act independently in the infection process, with only one spore required for flower infection. There were differences found in the susceptibility of flower parts to infection with filaments being the most susceptible to infection followed by anthers, stigmas, and petals. The practical implications of thrips dispersal of M. fructicola were discussed as thrips were shown to be {{an important}} factor in brown rot epidemiology in Canterbury peach orchards...|$|R
