40|$|The {{potential}} of Additive Manufacturing (AM) for microwave and mm-wave applications is increasingly being revealed thanks to recent advancements in research. AM empowers engineers with new capabilities to manufacture complex conformal geometries quicker and at lower costs. It allows, for instance, the embedding of RF front ends into functional structures. In this dissertation, {{two aspects of}} AM are explored: (a) The development and characterization of techniques that improve the performance of AM microwave circuits and antennas, and (b) study of complex geometries, such as meshed structures, {{as an alternative to}} reduce material usage, cost, and weight of the components. Micro-dispensing of silver paste (CB 028) is extensively used in this work as a viable approach for manufacturing microwave planar transmission lines. However, the performance and upper-frequency range of these lines are limited by the cross-sectional shape and electrical conductivity of the printed paste, as well as the achievable minimum feature size which is typically around 100 μm. In this work a picosecond Nd:YAG laser is used to machine slots in a 20 - 25 μm-thick layer of silver paste (Dupont CB 028) that is micro-dispensed on a Rogers RT 5870 substrate, producing coplanar waveguide transmission lines with 16 - 20 μm-wide slots. It is shown that the laser solidifies 2 μm wide region along the edges of the slots, thus significantly increasing the effective conductivity of the film and improving the attenuation constant of the lines. The extracted attenuation constant at 20 GHz for laser machined CB 028 is 0. 74 dB/cm. CPW resonators and filters show that the effective conductivity is in the range from 10 MS/m to 30 MS/m, which represents a 100 x improvement when compared to the values obtained with the exclusive use of micro-dispensing. Another main aspect of this dissertation is the study of meshed structures in coplanar waveguides. For most AM processes the materials utilized for the conductive layer are the most expensive ones; hence, there is value in minimizing the conductor surface area used in a circuit. In this work, the approach of meshed ground coplanar waveguide (MGCPW) is analyzed by simulating, fabricating and measuring a broad set of meshed ground geometry sizes. Furthermore, a physical-mathematical model is presented, which predicts the characteristic impedance and the capacitance per unit length of MGCPW with less than 5. 4 % error compared to simulated data. A set of filters is designed and fabricated in order to demonstrate the approach. The main parameter affected by meshing the ground plane is the attenuation constant of the waveguide. It is shown that 50 % mesh density in the ground plane of a MGCPW line can be used with less than 25 % increase in the loss. In contrast, the loss of finite ground coplanar waveguide (FGCPW) can increase by as much as 108 % when the ground size is reduced by the same factor (50 %). Both 3 D printing (micro-dispensing) and traditional printed circuit board manufacturing are used in this work, and most of the propagation characterization is performed at 4 GHz. A meshing technique is also applied to rectangular waveguides, and its effects are studied. It is presented as an option for high power, low loss, but also reduced weight applications. A set of meshed Ku-band waveguides was fabricated using binder jetting 3 D printing technology showing that the weight can be reduced by 22 % with an increase in loss of only 5 %, from 0. 019 dB/cm for the solid part to 0. 020 dB/cm average across the band with the meshed design. Further weight reduction is possible if higher loss is allowed. To demonstrate the concept, a comparison is made between non-meshed and meshed waveguide 4 pole Chebyshev filters. Finally, the BJ technology is characterized for Ku-Band rectangular waveguide and reflector antenna applications. This technology is characterized using electron beam microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The RF performance of the 3 D printed circuits is benchmarked with Ka-band cavity resonators, waveguide sections, and a filter. An unloaded resonator Q of 616 is achieved, and the average attenuation of the WR- 28 waveguide section is 4. 3 dB/m. The BJ technology is tested with a meshed parabolic reflector antenna, where the <b>illuminating</b> <b>horn,</b> waveguide feed, and a filter are printed in a single piece. The antenna shows a peak gain of 24. 56 dBi at 35 GHz...|$|E

It is based on linearly polarized unit-cells with 180 ° phase-shifting capability. Several sequential rotation schemes have been compared numerically to generate a circularly polarized beam over a broad frequency band, and a random distribution has been selected to mitigate spurious cross-polarized side-lobes when scanning the main beam. The 2 -D electronic beam-steering capabilities of ± 60 ° have been verified experimentally.

40|$|Design and {{performance}} of a shaped beam 12. 2 GHz array-fed reflector antenna for broadcasting satellite is presented in this paper. Initial design, employing a cluster of feed <b>horns</b> <b>illuminating</b> a parabolic reflector is initially proposed for multi beam antenna (MBA) system to produce a contoured beam for Peninsular Malaysia. The precise feed positions are determined through a newly developed ray tracing program.

This paper shows the results of the contoured beam antenna that have been achieved for beam scanned over a coverage size of approximately 0. 9 ° long and 0. 5 ° wide. Small variation of radiation level, which is less than 3 dB within the edge of coverage (EOC), is also demonstrated in the performance analysis...|$|R
5000|$|The first stretched-wheelbase K cars, {{introduced}} in 1983, {{were not given}} their own platform letter, but had stretched wheelbases with New Yorker styling in front: the Chrysler Executive Sedan and Limousine. They were made at the St. Louis assembly plant, and held five and seven passengers, respectively. The pair were powered by a carbureted Mitsubishi 2.6-liter four-cylinder engine coupled to the usual Torqueflite automatic transmission, though {{in the last two}} years of the Limousine, a turbocharged (but not intercooled) Chrysler 2.2-liter four-cylinder engine was added. The stretched platform was not used by Mitsubishi when they upgraded the Mitsubishi Debonair from a rear-drive sedan to front-wheel drive despite engine sharing between Mitsubishi and Chrysler at the time. Standard features included air conditioning, cruise control, power brakes, front and rear cigarette lighters, front/rear divider and rear compartment with cabinet (Limousine), rear defroster, digital instrument panel, electronic voice alert, tinted glass on all windows, hood ornament, lights that went on with the dual <b>horn,</b> <b>illuminated</b> entry, a full lighting package inside, opera lights outside, dual power mirrors, power antenna, locks, windows, and driver's seat, FM stereo, [...] "luxury cloth" [...] seats, tilt steering, leather steering wheel, intermittent wipers, and padded landau roof.

40|$|When I first {{talked about}} axial {{displacement}} error, {{one of the}} first questions that arose was “Where does the power go when the gain is reduced? ” The best way to answer this is by example, by calculating patterns for a dish with various feed displacements, using Physical Optics. For this example, we will use a simple feed horn, 1. 2 λ in diameter; any larger diameter could support additional waveguide modes. The feed radiation pattern and predicted dish efficiency, about 72 % for an f/D = 0. 5, is shown in Figure 6. 1 - 15; experience suggests that efficiency on a real dish would be perhaps 15 % lower than predicted. Figure 6. 1 - 16 shows the calculated radiation pattern for a 0. 5 f/D dish, 20 λ in diameter, when <b>illuminated</b> by this <b>horn</b> with the phase center of the horn at the focus of the dish. Calculated gain, neglecting feed blockage, is about 34. 4 dBi, for an efficiency of about 70 %, very close to our prediction, and the 3 -dB beamwidth is about 5 °. The axial displacement error for this feed is shown in Figure 6. 1 - 17, so that we may choose some other interesting locations for closer examination. With an axial displacement of 0. 5 λ, gain is reduced by less than one dB, but one wavelength displacement produces a huge reduction, so an intermediate point of λ might be interesting. There is an apparent null at about 1. 5 λ displacement, and very poor performance with further displacement...|$|R
40|$|Design and {{analysis}} of a shaped-beam 12. 2 GHz array-fed reflector antenna for broadcasting satellite application and its significant performance improvement are presented in this paper. In the beginning, an elementary design employing a cluster of feed <b>horns</b> <b>illuminating</b> a single reflector has been proposed for multi beam antenna (MBA) system to produce contoured beam for Peninsular Malaysia. In this configuration, the horn positions were determined precisely through a newly developed caustic locus graph, which is the simplified technique for calculating the exact feed locations in both elevation and azimuth plane. The accuracy of the two-dimensional caustic locus graph, which was developed based on a ray tracing approach, has been verified through EM simulations. A universal feed position equation, derived from the technique has been very useful in designing the multiple feed structures employed in this research to ensure optimum radiation to the exact locations on the earth. Based on the initial design (a cluster of feed horns) due to {{the small size of}} the coverage area, an issue with regards to physical constructability of the feed horns is raised. To solve this problem, the MBA is modified by utilizing 18 -element microstrip array as the feed, where each element positions are calculated by using the same caustic model. In this approach, calculations of accurate feed positions and optimum excitation coefficients in widely distributed feed areas are considered as among the most critical aspects in designing the shaped-beam antenna system. By using the proposed solution, the preceding issue is solved and higher gain shaped-beam coverage with optimized radiation pattern is generated. This paper shows the results of the contoured beam antenna that have been achieved for beam scanned over a small coverage size of approximately 0. 9 ° long and 0. 5 °wide. Small variation of radiation level, which is less than 3 dB within the EOC, is also demonstrated in the performance analysis...|$|R
40|$|The passive Video {{camera for}} Imaging in Ka-band, named ViKy project, {{was born in}} 2004 {{as one of the}} {{possible}} spin-off based on the technology transfer of ESA PLANCK satellite thanks to an idea of Professor Nazzareno Mandolesi and Ing. Enrico Pagana. In 2004 the I ASF team - compound also by Ing. Adriano De Rosa, Dr. Carlo Burigana, Ing. Valerio Martorelli, Dr. Luca Stringhetti, Dr. Luca Valenziano, Dr. Fabrizio Villa and myself - ventured to raise the ViKy project. The aim of the ViKy system is to provide a real time optical image, obtained from the radiometric signal by imaging processing, for commercial applications. ViKy is a passive system because it does not need to illuminate the target (or an object in a scene) with an external radiation source as it happens for example in a radar system. The detected signal is given by the sum of the emitted and reflected component by the target object. The PPMMW imaging is a method of forming images through the passive detection of millimeter-wave radiation from a scene. In this way it is possible to form images during the day or night; in clear weather or in low-visibility conditions, such as haze, fog, clouds, smoke, or sandstorms; and even through clothing. This ability permits to see under conditions of low visibility otherwise visible or infrared (IR) sensors can do. In the commercial field such a system could be adopted by the airport companies to improve the capability of the security systems usually used to aid the aircrafts during the take-off or the landing phases. For security concerns, imaging of concealed weapons could be accomplished in a non intrusive manner with PMMW imaging. At system level the prototype can be separate in five units: the antenna ystem able to scan the scene quickly; the antenna electronics control that allows to carry out the scansion of the image; the radiometer that amplifies and detect the electromagnetic signal coming from the antenna; the Data Acquisition Electronics; the software for the image processing and the final interface. A key part of ViKy project is the design of a compact and low cost antenna working at 35 GHz and based on the reflectarray concept. Although this concept has been performed during the last years, only few 35 GHz reflectarrays exist. The reflectarray antenna consists of a flat reflecting surface and an <b>illuminating</b> feed <b>horn</b> placed in an off set or on set geometrical configuration depending on the requirements. On the reflecting surface, there are many isolated elements, named patches, which are designed to scatter the incident field and to form a planar wave front in the far-field. The second ViKy subsystem is the total power radiometer that was born from the millimeter waves technologies involved in the Low Frequency Instrument of PLANCK satellite. The radiometer amplifies and detects the signals coming from the antenna. The prototype that has been realized is based on a mechanical beam scanning necessary to reconstruct the image. In future will be possible to improve the ViKy system replacing the mechanical beam forming with an electronic beam forming using a particular kind of diode's technology. The data acquisition electronic and the software for the image reconstruction are the final subsystems of the imaging camera. All the ViKy components have been designed, assembled and finally tested by myself with the supervision of the IASF team. Mine PhD thesis summarizes the ViKy project starting from its principal and crucial aspects and finally presenting the results achieved. The measurements demonstrates the accordance with the required specifications. A pre-patent investigation highlighted the originality and newness of our project since to date no other passive system, coupled with a reflectarray antenna, has never been proposed. This demonstrates the full potential of the ViKy system in term of feasibility and commercial applications. ...|$|R
