Several {{consequences}} can result as fractures, loss of Independence and hasten death. Objective: To synthesize the effectiveness of nursing interventions <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>falls</b> in older people (≥ 75). Methods: Systematic review of RCT’s. We searched the SCOPUS database without date restriction. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were defined, the search expression used was: older people AND falls prevention AND nurs* AND randomized controlled trials. Full manuscripts were obtained and screened independently by two reviewers using a screening form with clearly defined criteria. Results: From twelve studies met the inclusion criteria. Four were related with exercise programs; four involved <b>devices</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>falls</b> (hip protectors); two included health promotional sessions (multidisciplinary team); and two studies involved a software to evaluate the risk of falling. Conclusions: Twelve interventions found in this study, nine had positive effect on <b>preventing</b> <b>falls.</b> Studies showed that physical exercise promotes strength, balance and can reduce the risk of falling and increase quality of life in older people. <b>Devices</b> designed <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>falls</b> could reduce the potential risk of falling. Also, na individualized intervention, empowering older people at home could reduce/prevent falls. These findings can be used by health professionals {{to play an important role}} in decreasing older adults’ fear of falling and promote their mobility and quality of life.

50|$|During this season, {{the head}} of SD-6, Arvin Sloane, was obsessed with Milo Rambaldi, {{a man from the}} 15th century who was able <b>to</b> create {{brilliant}} <b>devices</b> that were far ahead of their time. Sydney worked on a number of missions to retrieve or modify these Rambaldi <b>devices</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> them from <b>falling</b> into the hands of SD-6. During the season finale, on one such mission to destroy such a device, Sydney is captured and discovers that the organization that SD-6 has been pursuing is being run by Irina Derevko, Sydney's mother and a former KGB spy.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{determine}} if those who use walkers or canes in assisted living facilities have obtained a proper fit. Assisted ambulation <b>devices</b> are used <b>to</b> help one with movement. Walkers and canes that are not fitted appropriately could cause problems and even lead to potentially fatal falls. As the number of older adults continues to rise, more people {{need to be aware of}} the importance of a properly assisted ambulation <b>device.</b> <b>To</b> <b>prevent</b> these <b>falls,</b> it is vital to raise awareness of a proper fit for assisted ambulatory devices. Residents from two assisted living facilities were asked if they used a cane or walker. Those who signed an informed consent document were then asked questions about their ambulation device. The participants then rose to a standing position while the investigator assessed proper fit. No changes were made to their equipment as this should only be done by trained medical professionals. The primary conclusion in this study was found in the comparison between “fitted” and “needs improvement. ” With 23 participants in the study, 52 % of the people were in the “needs improvement” grouping. Other results were recorded including the type of device each participant owned, how long they had the device, the origin of the device, and if they thought the walker or cane fit...|$|R
40|$|Falls {{account for}} almost two million {{emergency}} department visits {{per year in the}} U. S. and are the leading cause of injury deaths among adults 65 years of age and older. Despite efforts to reduce fall risk factors, about one-third of community-dwelling older adults fall each year in the U. S. New methods and <b>devices</b> are needed <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>falls</b> and <b>to</b> reduce morbidity and mortality related to falls. Presently, it is unknown if there is a measurable change in sway before a person falls. In order to find out, a wireless data acquisition system was developed as no existing tools were available. A fall was induced to allow the study of pre-fall motion on a healthy subject. The sensor was positioned {{at the level of the}} hips, upper torso, shoulder, and head. The data collected showed a measureable change in postural motion. The results indicated that there are four distinguishable levels of postural stability, which are baseline, near-fall, pre-fall, and fall. Also, the hip level is the optimal sensor location based on the results of this pilot study. This research serves as a basis for further work in postural sway and interventions <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>falls...</b>|$|R
30|$|Assistive {{technologies}} aim {{at improving}} personal mobility {{of individuals with}} disabilities, increasing their independence and their access to social life. They include mechanical mobility aids that are increasingly employed amongst the older people who rely on them. However, these <b>devices</b> might fail <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>falls</b> due <b>to</b> the under-estimation of approaching hazards. Stairs and curbs are among these potential dangers present in urban environments and living accommodations, which {{increase the risk of}} an accident. We present and evaluate a low-complexity algorithm to detect descending stairs and curbs of any shape, specifically designed for low-power real-time embedded platforms. Based on a passive stereo camera, as opposed to a 3 D active sensor, we assessed the detection accuracy, processing time and power consumption. Our goal being to decide on three possible situations (safe, dangerous and potentially unsafe), we achieve to distinguish more than 94 % dangers from safe scenes within a 91 % overall recognition rate at very low resolution. This is accomplished in real-time with robustness to indoor/outdoor lighting conditions. We show that our method can run for a day on a smartphone battery.|$|R

40|$|Background: Falls {{are common}} events in older people, which cause {{considerable}} morbidity and mortality. Non-pharmacological interventions {{are an important}} approach <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>falls.</b> There are {{a large number of}} systematic reviews of non-pharmacological interventions, whose evidence needs to be synthesized in order to facilitate evidence-based clinical decision making. Objectives: To systematically examine reviews and meta-analyses that evaluated non-pharmacological interventions <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>falls</b> in older adults in the community, care facilities and hospitals. Methods: We searched the electronic databases Pubmed, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PEDRO and TRIP from January 2009 to March 2015, for systematic reviews that included at least one comparative study, evaluating any non-pharmacological intervention, <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>falls</b> amongst older adults. The quality of the reviews was assessed using AMSTAR and ProFaNE taxonomy was used to organize the interventions. Results: Fifty-nine systematic reviews were identified which consisted of single, multiple and multi-factorial non-pharmacological interventions <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>falls</b> in older people. The most frequent ProFaNE defined interventions were exercises either alone or combined with other interventions, followed by environment/assistive technology interventions comprising environmental modifications, assistive and protective aids, staff education and vision assessment/correction.

Exercise and multifactorial interventions were the most effective treatments to reduce falls in older adults, although not all types of exercise were equally effective in all subjects and in all settings. Effective exercise programs combined balance and strength training. Reviews with a higher AMSTAR score were more likely to contain more primary studies, to be updated and to perform meta-analysis.

Methods: The USPSTF reviewed new {{evidence on the}} effectiveness and harms of primary care–relevant interventions <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>falls</b> in community-dwelling older adults. The interventions were grouped into 5 main categories: multifactorial clinical assessment (with or without direct intervention), clinical management (with or without screening), clinical education or behavioral counseling, home hazard modification, and exercise or physical therapy. Recommendations: The USPSTF recommends exercise or physical therapy and vitamin D supplementation <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>falls</b> in community-dwelling adults aged 65 years or older who {{are at increased risk}} for falls. (Grade B recommendation) The USPSTF does not recommend automatically performing an in-depth multifactorial risk assessment in conjunction with comprehensive management of identified risks <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>falls</b> in community-dwelling adults aged 65 years or older because the likelihood of benefit is small. In determining whether this service is appropriate in individual cases, patients and clinicians should consider the balance of benefits and harms {{on the basis of the}} circumstances of prior falls, comorbid medical conditions, and patient values.
