The limit process just described can be performed for any point in the domain of the squaring function. This defines the derivative function of the squaring function, or just the derivative of the squaring function for short. A computation similar to the one above shows that the derivative of the squaring function is the doubling function.|$|E

Lyons Plantation-- [...] "I had {{yesterday}} the pleasure to see Maj. Callis and am happy to find you have established a chain of liaison between this camp and the seat of government." [...] Lafayette mentioned the enemy's retreat from Richmond, and their arrival at Williamsburg. He suggested that he go and fight Cornwallis. His troops {{had managed to get}} clear of the smallpox; but his men were deserting to harvest their crops. He suggested arming two corps of volunteers of 120 men each with spears (for lack of better weapons), forming a corp of 150 negro pioneers and a corp of 150 negro wagonners to collect horses and weapons from the countryside.

2500|$|Giuliani gave much of {{the credit}} for a drop in 2001 crime to Kerik, saying that [...] "Commissioner Kerik took over a police {{department}} that was leading the country in crime declines, and somehow he was able {{to figure out how to}} create even more crime reduction and to do that against a national trend in which crime <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>up</b> in {{much of the}} rest of the country." [...] Known in the department as the [...] "beat-cop commissioner," [...] Kerik frequently cruised the city at night with a security detail composed of cops who had been in shootouts, dangled from rooftops, hit by bullets, raced into burning buildings, and seen their partners die. During his time as police commissioner he made five arrests, including one involving two ex-convicts—one a paroled killer, wanted for a carjacking at gunpoint in Virginia—for allegedly driving a stolen van in Harlem. As police commissioner, Kerik served on the terrorism committee with the International Association of Chiefs of Police and the Criminal Justice Advisory Board for St. John's University.|$|E
2500|$|With Al Jazeera's {{coverage}} of the Egyptian Revolution of 2011, the channel drew acclaim and received renewed attention. The New York Times reported on 1 February 2011 that 1.6 million U.S. viewers had tuned in via Internet stream, and stated that new discussions were underway with carriers. The following month, {{it was announced that}} Al Jazeera entered carriage negotiations with Comcast and Time Warner Cable. Salon.com described the channel's English-language coverage as [...] "mandatory viewing for anyone interested in the world-changing events currently happening in Egypt", while Huffington Post contributor Jeff Jarvis claimed it was [...] "un-American" [...] for operators to not carry the network. When Al Jazeera covered the Libyan Civil War, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton noted an increasing American audience for the network, saying that [...] "viewership of Al Jazeera <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>up</b> in the United States because it’s real news. You may not agree with it, but you feel like you’re getting real news around the clock instead of a million commercials and—you know—arguments between talking heads and the kind of stuff that we do on our news which—you know—is not particularly informative to us, let alone foreigners." ...|$|E

50|$|VPT is {{interpreted}} in similar ways to OBV. Generally, {{the idea is}} that volume is higher on days with a price move in the dominant direction, for example in a strong uptrend more volume on up days than down days. So, when prices <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>up,</b> VPT should <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>up</b> too, and when prices make a new rally high, VPT should too. If VPT fails to go past its previous rally high then this is a negative divergence, suggesting a weak move.|$|R
