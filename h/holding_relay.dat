5000|$|Zahn {{was first}} {{diagnosed}} with cancer in the late 1990s. Prior to his diagnosis, he had been active in planning the Hampton Roads area Relay for Life and {{a supporter of the}} American Cancer Society. He served on the Chesapeake, Portsmouth and Virginia Beach Board of Directors and {{was a member of the}} National Advisory Committee for the Cancer Society’s main fund-raiser, the Relay for Life. Zahn produced a series of television news stories and a documentary program about his battle with cancer. The program, which aired on WVEC-TV, was entitled [...] "My Race Against Cancer." [...] The program chronicled his medical progress and personal ordeal from the time of his diagnosis until his cancer went into remission. At WVEC, Zahn produced two nationally distributed videos for the American Cancer Society encouraging communities to <b>hold</b> <b>Relay</b> for Life events. Zahn toured the United States to promote Relay for Life and continued his involvement with Relay until his death. He was inducted into National Relay Hall of Fame in 1999.|$|R

50|$|In the mid-1980s, Dr. Klatt {{expressed}} interest in helping raise funds for his local American Cancer Society. He decided he would raise money by doing something he enjoyed—running marathons. In May 1985, Dr. Klatt circled the track {{for a total of}} more than 83 miles at Baker Stadium at the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma for 24 hours. Friends and family donated $25 to run or walk certain lengths with him. That year, he raised $27,000. While he ran, nearly 300 friends, family, and patients watched as he ran and walked the track.While he was running, Dr. Klatt began making plans on how the event could be even bigger in future years. Throughout the next year, he, along with an event committee, developed plans for the City of Destiny Classic 24-Hour Run Against Cancer.In 1986, 19 teams took part in the first team relay event and raised $33,000. Since then, Dr. Klatt’s idea has turned into more than 5,200 Relay For Life events across the United States that have raised nearly $5 billion. The American Cancer Society also licenses twenty non-governmental cancer organizations in other countries to <b>hold</b> <b>Relay</b> For Life events.|$|R

50|$|The {{simplest}} type of {{burglar alarm}} control {{consists of a}} single relay. In this type, the sensor circuit (called the loop in industrial terminology) <b>holds</b> the <b>relay</b> energized. Since the path for the loop goes {{through a set of}} contacts which are normally open (when the relay is restored they are open, when the relay is energized they are closed), when the loop opens, even momentarily, the relay will drop out and stay that way. A second set of contacts on the relay, normally closed (when the relay is restored they are closed, when the relay is energized they are open) is used to operate the annunciator, usually a bell. The system is disarmed by a key-operated shunt which forces the relay to energize, and is armed by closing all traps and then by opening the shunt. While burglar alarm controls are now very elaborate, the single-relay control incorporates all the functionality of any control. These controls and a closely related dual-relay design are still widely used in stand-alone applications, powered by lead-acid batteries.|$|R

Lewis-Francis became Britain's top 100 m sprinter after Dwain Chambers was banned for drug use in 2003. He failed to make the final of the 100 m at the 2004 Summer Olympics, but days later ran the final leg of the 4 × 100 m <b>relay,</b> <b>holding</b> off former Olympic champion Maurice Greene, allowing the Great Britain team to narrowly win in a time of 38.07 seconds.

30|$|In the {{conventional}} one-way direct transmission (DT) system, the rate maximization (RM) and margin maximization (MM) problems are of duality {{to each other}} and admit a unique water-filling solution [15]. However, this fact does not <b>hold</b> when a <b>relay</b> node has been introduced. The aim of [12 – 14] is to maximize a given objective function, for example signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), mutual information (MI), or system capacity, subjecting to the power constraints of the whole network or/and at each node. However, the quality-of-service (QoS) constraints are not addressed. Note that in practical indoor PLC applications, such as high definition video streaming, QoS criteria are very important as they greatly affect the user experience.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Achievable rates with amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) {{cooperative}} {{strategies are}} examined for relay networks. Motivated by sensor network applications, power-constrained networks with large bandwidth resources {{and a large}} number of nodes are considered. It is shown that AF strategies do not necessarily benefit from the available bandwidth. Rather, transmitting in the optimum AF bandwidth allows the network to operate in the linear regime where the achieved rate increases linearly with the available network power. The optimum power allocation among the AF relays, shown to be a form of maximal ratio combining, indicates the favorable relay positions. Orthog-onal node transmissions are also examined. While the same op-timum bandwidth result still <b>holds,</b> the <b>relay</b> power allocation in this case {{can be viewed as a}} form of water-filling.

Luzinski doubled off the left field wall in left and Rose rounded third never intending to <b>hold</b> up. Cruz <b>relayed</b> to Landestoy who threw to catcher Bruce Bochy. Rose then bowled over Bochy to score the winning run. The Phillies then got an insurance run to take the lead 5 - 3 and tie the series. It was then Ryan versus Rose.|$|R
5000|$|While {{running for}} Pasadena High School, Sanford won the 400 metres, {{anchored}} {{his team to}} victory in the 4x400 metres relay and was second in the 200 metres (a race brother Michael was to win the next two years) at the 1977 CIF California State Meet.

The optimum power allocation among the AF relays is presented next. The solution, which {{can be viewed as a}} form of maximum ratio combining, indicates the favorable relay positions.

The wideband DF strategy is shown to require a different choice of relays.

40|$|For every Gaussian network, {{there exists}} a {{corresponding}} deterministic network called the discrete superposition network. We show that this discrete superposition network provides a near-optimal digital interface for operating a class consisting of many Gaussian networks {{in the sense that}} any code for the discrete superposition network can be naturally lifted to a corresponding code for the Gaussian network, while achieving a rate that {{is no more than a}} constant number of bits lesser than the rate it achieves for the discrete superposition network. This constant depends only on the number of nodes in the network and not on the channel gains or SNR. Moreover the capacities of the two networks are within a constant of each other, again independent of channel gains and SNR. We show that the class of Gaussian networks for which this interface property <b>holds</b> includes <b>relay</b> networks with a single source-destination pair, interference networks, multicast networks, and the counterparts of these networks with multiple transmit and receive antennas. The code for the Gaussian relay network can be obtained from any code for the discrete superposition network simply by pruning it. This lifting scheme establishes that the superposition model can indeed potentially serve as a strong surrogate for designing codes for Gaussian relay networks. We present similar results for the K x K Gaussian interference network, MIMO Gaussian interference networks, MIMO Gaussian relay networks, and multicast networks, with the constant gap depending additionally on the number of antennas in case of MIMO networks.

40|$|Wireless {{channels}} {{suffer from}} severe inherent impairments and hence reliable and {{high data rate}} wireless transmission is particularly challenging to achieve. Fortunately, using multiple antennae improves performance in wireless transmission by providing space diversity, spatial multiplexing, and power gains. However, in wireless ad-hoc networks multiple antennae may not be acceptable due to limitations in size, cost, and hardware complexity. As a result, cooperative relaying strategies have attracted considerable attention because of their abilities {{to take advantage of}} multi-antenna by using multiple single-antenna relays. This study is to explore cooperative signaling for different relay networks, such as multi-hop relay networks formed by multiple single-antenna relays and multi-stage relay networks formed by multiple relaying stages with each stage <b>holding</b> several single-antenna <b>relays.</b> The main contribution of this study is {{the development of a new}} relaying scheme for networks using symbol-level modulation, such as binary phase shift keying (BPSK) and quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK). We also analyze effects of this newly developed scheme when it is used with space-time coding in a multi-stage relay network. Simulation results demonstrate that the new scheme outperforms previously proposed schemes: amplify-and-forward (AF) scheme and decode-and-forward (DF) scheme...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{cognition}} {{on the energy}} efficiency of a downlink cellular system in which multiple relays assist the transmission of the base station is considered. The problem is motivated by the practical importance of relay-assisted solutions in mobile networks, such as LTE-A, in which cooperation among <b>relays</b> <b>holds</b> the promise of greatly improving the energy efficiency of the system. We study the fundamental tradeoff between the power consumption at the base station {{and the level of}} cooperation and cognition at the relay nodes. By distributing the same message to multiple relays, the base station consumes more power but it enables cooperation among the relays, thus making the transmission between relays to destination a multiuser cognitive channel. Cooperation among the relays allows for a reduction of the power used to transmit from the relays to the end users due to interference management and the coherent combining gains. These gain are present even in the case of partial or unidirectional transmitter cooperation, which is the case in cognitive channels such as the cognitive interference channel and the interference channel with a cognitive relay. We therefore address the problem of determining the optimal level of cooperation at the relays which results in the smallest total power consumption when accounting for the power reduction due to cognition. A practical design examples and numerical simulation are presented in a companion paper (part II) ...|$|R
