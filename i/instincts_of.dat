5|$|The breed can {{tolerate}} other pets well, although the King Charles {{still has the}} hunting <b>instincts</b> <b>of</b> its ancestors and {{may not always be}} friendly towards smaller animals. It is intelligent enough to be used for obedience work and, due to its stable temperament, it can be a successful therapy dog for hospitals and nursing homes.|$|E
5|$|It is a hardy breed, {{and can be}} stubborn, {{leading to}} issues with {{training}}. A Westie may need to have its training refreshed on occasion during its lifetime. Having a typical terrier prey drive, {{it tends to be}} highly interested in toys, especially chasing balls. It does retain the <b>instincts</b> <b>of</b> an earth-dog, including inquisitive and investigative traits, as well as natural instincts to both bark and dig holes. It is ranked 47th in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs.|$|E
25|$|Disgruntled surrealists {{moved to}} the {{periodical}} Documents, edited by Georges Bataille, whose anti-idealist materialism formed a hybrid Surrealism intending to expose the base <b>instincts</b> <b>of</b> humans. To the dismay of many, Documents fizzled out in 1931, just as Surrealism seemed to be gathering more steam.|$|E

25|$|Kirby began {{planning}} his Introduction to Entomology, {{a celebrated}} title, in 1808. This was the practical {{result of a}} friendship formed in 1805 with William Spence, of Hull, and appeared in four volumes between 1815 and 1826. Much of the work fell to Kirby owing to Spence's ill health. The book was illustrated by John Curtis. It reached its seventh edition in 1856. In 1830 {{he was invited to}} write one of the Bridgewater Treatises, his subject being The History, Habits, and <b>Instincts</b> <b>of</b> Animals (2 vols., 1835).|$|E
25|$|With {{the help}} of Herbert Davenport, {{a friend who was}} the head of the {{economics}} department at the University of Missouri, Veblen accepted a position there in 1911. Veblen’s stay at Missouri was not one that he enjoyed. This was in part due to the fact that his position as a lecturer was of lower rank than his previous positions and for lower pay. Veblen also strongly disliked the town of Columbia, where the university was located. Although he may not have enjoyed his stay at Missouri, in 1914 he did publish another of his best-known books, The <b>Instincts</b> <b>of</b> Worksmanship and the State of the Industrial Arts (1914). After the First World War began, Veblen published Imperial Germany and the Industrial Revolution (1915). He considered warfare a threat to economic productivity and contrasted the authoritarian politics of Germany with the democratic tradition of Britain, noting that industrialization in Germany had not produced a progressive political culture.|$|E
25|$|Badger (voiced by Andy Cunningham, {{operated}} by Andy Cunningham + others) - Badger {{is named after}} what he is - a badger. He is anthropomorphic - {{he has the ability}} to talk and wears smaller versions of human clothes (including his trademark red beret and red and white patterned neckerchief) and is obsessed with mashed potato, which he likes to play with as well as eat. Because he has a low, booming voice, he has a laugh that's similar to boxer Frank Bruno. He gets Simon into trouble much of the time by playing around with mashed potato because some of the characters do not know about Badger, so instead Simon gets the blame for Badger's mishaps. It is Badger's child-like inability to continually behave that gets him into trouble with Simon, when Simon has to take the blame for many of Badger's antics to try and keep Badger secret. However Badger is still a very good friend to Simon and tries to help him out every way he can. All this said, however, Badger still exhibits the natural <b>instincts</b> <b>of</b> a badger beyond simply his physical limitations by being a badger. For example he still pinches and eats various items that he isn't supposed to in situations when it isn't exactly helpful. On two occasions he has eaten smashed up cake at completely inappropriate times and on another he ate a biro pen when Bodger got one out to fill out a job application form. He can also run very fast (badgers can run up to 19mph) and can frequently be heard scuttling away from any given situation or location.|$|E

500|$|According to Sarmiento, these {{elements}} {{are crucial to}} an understanding of the Argentine Revolution, in which Argentina gained independence from Spain. Although Argentina’s war of independence was prompted by the influence of European ideas, Buenos Aires was the only city that could achieve civilization. Rural people participated in the war to demonstrate their physical strengths rather than because they wanted to civilize the country. [...] In the end, the revolution was a failure because the barbaric <b>instincts</b> <b>of</b> the rural population led to the loss and dishonor of the civilized cityBuenos Aires.|$|E
500|$|On October 27, 2014, The Boston Globe {{announced}} that it was endorsing Baker marking the first time in twenty years that newspaper has supported a Republican candidate for governor. [...] "One needn't agree with every last one of Baker's views to conclude that, at this time, the Republican nominee would provide the best counterpoint to the <b>instincts</b> <b>of</b> an overwhelmingly Democratic Legislature," [...] the endorsement reads. The newspaper also supported Baker because it claimed Baker would be the better candidate to [...] "consolidate" [...] outgoing Democratic Gov. Deval Patrick's legacy on reforms tied to education, health care and public transportation.|$|E

500|$|Von Neumann's {{principal}} {{contribution to}} the atomic bomb was in the concept and design of the explosive lenses needed to compress the plutonium core of the Fat Man weapon that was later dropped on Nagasaki. While von Neumann did not originate the [...] "implosion" [...] concept, {{he was one of}} its most persistent proponents, encouraging its continued development against the <b>instincts</b> <b>of</b> many of his colleagues, who felt such a design to be unworkable. He also eventually {{came up with the idea}} of using more powerful shaped charges and less fissionable material to greatly increase the speed of [...] "assembly".|$|E
500|$|... {{he had in}} {{many respects}} great natural ability. He knew how to be both dignified and charming; he had an {{excellent}} memory; and his tact in handling people was quite exceptional. He had a store of varied, though unsystematized, knowledge gathered at first-hand through talking {{to all sorts of}} eminent men. His tastes were not particularly elevated, but they were thoroughly English; and he showed much (though not unfailing) comprehension for the common <b>instincts</b> <b>of</b> the people over whom he reigned. This was not the less remarkable because, though a good linguist in French and German, he never learned to speak English without a German accent.|$|E
500|$|As for Lady Grange herself, her vituperative outbursts and indulgence {{in alcohol}} were clearly {{important}} factors in her undoing. Alexander Carlyle described her [...] as [...] "stormy and outrageous", whilst noting {{that it was in}} her husband's interests to exaggerate the nature of her violent emotions. Macaulay (2009) takes the view that the ultimate cause of her troubles was her reaction to her husband's infidelity. In an attempt to end his relationship with Mrs Lindsay, (who owned a coffee house in Haymarket, Edinburgh), Rachel threatened to expose him as a Jacobite sympathiser. Perhaps she did not understand the magnitude of this accusation and the danger it posed to her husband and his friends, or how ruthless their <b>instincts</b> <b>of</b> self-preservation were likely to be.|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't {{know but}} you're right," [...] the first speaker said. [...] "And I couldn't see {{the logic of}} Metchnikoff's {{position}} {{in regard to the}} 'instinct of death' which he expects us to develop after we have lived, say, a hundred and thirty or forty years, so that at a hundred and fifty we shall be glad to go, and shall not want anything but death after we die. The apparent line of his argument is that in youth we have not the <b>instinct</b> <b>of</b> life so strongly but that we willingly risk life. Then, until we live to a hundred and thirty or forty or so, we have the <b>instinct</b> <b>of</b> life so strongly that we are anxious to shun death; lastly the <b>instinct</b> <b>of</b> death grows in us and we are eager to lay down life. I don't see how or why this should be. As a matter of fact, children dread death far more than men who are not yet old enough to have developed the <b>instinct</b> <b>of</b> it. Still, it's a fascinating and suggestive book." ...|$|R
500|$|In August 2011, Olek held a solo {{exhibition}} at Jonathan LeVine Gallery. She collaborated with director Gina Vecchione and producer Michelle Price {{to create a}} short silent film called YARNANA, through Kickstarter-based fundraising. [...] "Inspired by the silent film genre, it relies solely on powerful music, sound design and physical expression. The characters speak through modern dance, physical comedy, capoeira, martial arts, poi, belly dancing, breakdance, acrobatics, gymnastics and the <b>instincts</b> <b>of</b> soul searchers." [...] The project's funding was ultimately canceled on Kickstarter, but the film was still created, and it won a film festival award. Her first {{solo exhibition}} in the United Kingdom, called [...] "I {{do not expect to}} be a mother but I do expect to die alone", was influenced by her experiences while she lived there.|$|E
500|$|At {{an early}} stage in his priesthood Lang decided to lead a celibate life. He had no {{objection}} to the institution of marriage, but felt that his own work would be hindered by domesticity. Years after Lang's death, his sexual orientation was questioned; [...] journalist Michael Gove and historian David Starkey suggested that Lang was a repressed homosexual. He had close friendships with colleagues such as Dick Sheppard, and with Wilfrid Parker, his one-time domestic chaplain to whom he wrote admitting his personal loneliness, and of his need for [...] "someone in daily nearness to love". He enjoyed the company of women and confessed in 1928, after {{a visit to the}} Rowntree's chocolate factory, that the sight of the girls there had [...] "stirred up all the <b>instincts</b> <b>of</b> my youth... very little subdued by the passage of years".|$|E
500|$|Jane was {{in contact}} with Irish Land League leaders, {{including}} John Dillon and William O'Brien, and lobbied {{for the release of}} the latter after his imprisonment under the Coercion Act of 1881. She and her sisters supported the Irish Plan of Campaign, a scheme whereby tenants acted collectively to secure fair rents from their landlords. This plan was eventually denounced by the Roman Catholic Church as contrary to natural justice and Christian charity, although some priests supported it. [...] The attachment of Jane and her sisters to the rebellious factions in Ireland strained relations between the sisters and many of their father's former Liberal Unionist colleagues, but won approval from Thomas Bayley Potter, who had succeeded Richard Cobden as MP for Rochdale. In October 1887 he wrote to Jane: [...] "You are true to the living and just <b>instincts</b> <b>of</b> your father... You know your father's heart better than John Bright does".|$|E

500|$|Many of the ascetic {{practices}} of Cynicism {{may have been}} adopted by early Christians, and Christians often employed the same rhetorical methods as the Cynics. Some Cynics were martyred for speaking out against the authorities. One Cynic, Peregrinus Proteus, lived for a time as a Christian before converting to Cynicism, whereas in the 4th century, Maximus of Alexandria, although a Christian, was also called a Cynic because of his ascetic lifestyle. Christian writers would often praise Cynic poverty, although they scorned Cynic shamelessness: Augustine stating that they had, [...] "in violation of the modest <b>instincts</b> <b>of</b> men, boastfully proclaimed their unclean and shameless opinion, worthy indeed of dogs." [...] The ascetic orders of Christianity also had direct connection with the Cynics, {{as can be seen}} in the wandering mendicant monks of the early church who in outward appearance, and in many of their practices differed little from the Cynics of an earlier age.|$|E
500|$|Anne has {{traditionally}} been regarded with condescension by historians, who have emphasised her triviality and extravagance. Along with James, she tended to be dismissed by a historical tradition, beginning with the anti-Stuart historians of the mid-17th century, which saw in the self-indulgence and vanity of the Jacobean court {{the origins of the}} English civil war. Historian David Harris Willson, in his 1956 biography of James, delivered this damning verdict: [...] "Anne had little influence over her husband. She could not share his intellectual interests, and she confirmed the foolish contempt with which he regarded women. Alas! The king had married a stupid wife." [...] The 19th century biographer Agnes Strickland condemned Anne's actions to regain custody of Prince Henry as irresponsible: [...] "It must lower the character of Anne of Denmark in the eyes of everyone, both as a woman and queen, that she... preferred to indulge the mere <b>instincts</b> <b>of</b> maternity at the risk of involving her husband, her infant, and their kingdom, in the strife and misery of unnatural warfare." ...|$|E
500|$|Bush {{had begun}} to develop [...] an {{interest}} in politics during the war years. In 1924, rejecting his parents' conservatism, [...] he joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP). [...] The following year he joined the London Labour Choral Union (LLCU), a group of largely London-based choirs that had been organised by the socialist composer Rutland Boughton, with Labour Party [...] support, [...] to [...] "develop the musical <b>instincts</b> <b>of</b> the people and to render service to the Labour movement". [...] Bush [...] was soon appointed as Boughton's assistant, and two years later, [...] he succeeded Boughton as the LLCU's chief musical adviser, remaining in this post until the body disbanded in 1940. Through his LLCU work, Bush [...] met Michael Tippett, five years his junior, who shared Bush's left-wing political perspective. In his memoirs [...] Tippett records his first impressions of Bush: [...] "I learned much from him. His music at the time seemed so adventurous and vigorous". [...] Tippett's biographer Ian Kemp writes: [...] "Apart from Sibelius, the contemporary composer who taught Tippett {{as much as anyone}} else was his own contemporary Alan Bush".|$|E
