5|$|Jarrow, {{situated}} on the River Tyne in County Durham, northern England, entered British history in the 8th century, {{as the home of}} Bede, the early Christian monk and scholar. After Bede, little changed in the remote rural community <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>years,</b> although his monastery was dissolved under Henry VIII in the 16th century. The discovery of coal in the 17th century led to major changes. Mining on an industrial scale began in the early 1800s, resulting in the population of Jarrow more than doubling between 1801 and 1821 to around 3,500, largely from the influx of mineworkers.|$|E
5|$|The {{establishment}} of Constantinople served {{as one of}} Constantine's most lasting accomplishments, shifting Roman power eastward as the city became a center of Greek culture and Christianity. Numerous churches were built across the city, including the Hagia Sophia which was built {{during the reign of}} Justinian the Great and remained the world's largest cathedral <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>years.</b> Constantine also undertook a major renovation and expansion of the Hippodrome of Constantinople; accommodating tens of thousands of spectators, the hippodrome became central to civic life and, in the 5th and 6th centuries, the epicenter of episodes of unrest, including the Nika riots. Constantinople's location also ensured its existence would stand the test of time; for many centuries, its walls and seafront protected Europe against invaders from the east and the advance of Islam. During most of the Middle Ages, {{the latter part of the}} Byzantine era, Constantinople was the largest and wealthiest city on the European continent and at times the largest in the world.|$|E

Upon realizing that twins were to be born, Zurvan resolved to grant the first-born sovereignty over creation. Ohrmuzd perceived Zurvan’s decision, which He then communicated to His brother. Ahriman then preempted Ohrmuzd by ripping open the womb to emerge first. Reminded of the resolution to grant Ahriman sovereignty, Zurvan conceded, but limited kingship to a period of 9000years, after which Ohrmuzd would rule for all eternity (Zaehner, 1955:419-428).|$|E
