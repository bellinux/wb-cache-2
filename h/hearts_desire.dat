[...] To whom thus Adam cleerd of doubt, repli'd. [...] How fully hast thou satisfi'd mee, pure [...] 180 [...] Intelligence of Heav'n, Angel serene, [...] And freed from intricacies, taught to live, [...] The easiest way, nor with perplexing thoughts [...] To interrupt the sweet of Life, from which [...] God hath bid dwell farr off all anxious cares, [...] And not molest us, unless we our selves [...] Seek them with wandring thoughts, and notions vaine. [...] But apt the Mind or Fancie is to roave [...] Uncheckt, and of her roaving is no end; [...] Till warn'd, or by experience taught, she learne, [...] 190 [...] That not to know at large of things remote [...] From use, obscure and suttle, but to know [...] That which before us lies in daily life, [...] Is the prime Wisdom, what is more, is fume, [...] Or emptiness, or fond impertinence, [...] And renders us in things that most concerne [...] Unpractis'd, unprepar'd, and still to seek. [...] Therefore from this high pitch let us descend [...] A lower flight, and speak of things at hand [...] Useful, whence haply mention may arise [...] 200 [...] Of somthing not unseasonable to ask [...] By sufferance, and thy wonted favour deign'd. [...] Thee I have heard relating what was don [...] Ere my remembrance: now hear mee relate [...] My Storie, which perhaps thou hast not heard; [...] And Day is yet not spent; till then thou seest [...] How suttly to detaine thee I devise, [...] Inviting thee to hear while I relate, [...] Fond, were it not in hope of thy reply: [...] For while I sit with thee, I seem in Heav'n, [...] 210 [...] And sweeter thy discourse is to my eare [...] Then Fruits of Palm-tree pleasantest to thirst [...] And hunger both, from labour, at the houre [...] Of sweet repast; they satiate, and soon fill, [...] Though pleasant, but thy words with Grace Divine [...] Imbu'd, bring to thir sweetness no satietie. [...] To whom thus Raphael answer'd heav'nly meek. [...] Nor are thy lips ungraceful, Sire of men, [...] Nor tongue ineloquent; for God on thee [...] Abundantly his gifts hath also pour'd, [...] 220 [...] Inward and outward both, his image faire: [...] Speaking or mute all comliness and grace [...] Attends thee, and each word, each motion formes. [...] Nor less think wee in Heav'n of thee on Earth [...] Then of our fellow servant, and inquire [...] Gladly into the wayes of God with Man: [...] For God we see hath honour'd thee, and set [...] On Man his equal Love: say therefore on; [...] For I that Day was absent, as befell, [...] Bound on a voyage uncouth and obscure, [...] 230 [...] Farr on excursion toward the Gates of Hell; [...] Squar'd in full Legion (such command we had) [...] To see that none thence issu'd forth a spie, [...] Or enemie, while God was in his work, [...] Least hee incenst at such eruption bold, [...] Destruction with Creation might have mixt. [...] Not that they durst without his leave attempt, [...] But us he sends upon his high behests [...] For state, as Sovran King, and to enure [...] Our prompt obedience. Fast we found, fast shut [...] 240 [...] The dismal Gates, and barricado'd strong; [...] But long ere our approaching heard within [...] Noise, other then the sound of Dance or Song, [...] Torment, and lowd lament, and furious rage. [...] Glad we return'd up to the coasts of Light [...] Ere Sabbath Eev'ning: so we had in charge. [...] But thy relation now; for I attend, [...] Pleas'd with thy words no less then thou with mine. [...] So spake the Godlike Power, and thus our Sire. [...] For Man to tell how human Life began [...] 250 [...] Is hard; for who himself beginning knew? [...] Desire with thee still longer to converse [...] Induc'd me. As new wak't from soundest sleep [...] Soft on the flourie herb I found me laid [...] In Balmie Sweat, which with his Beames the Sun [...] Soon dri'd, and on the reaking moisture fed. [...] Strait toward Heav'n my wondring Eyes I turnd, [...] And gaz'd a while the ample Skie, till rais'd [...] By quick instinctive motion up I sprung, [...] As thitherward endevoring, and upright [...] 260 [...] Stood on my feet; about me round I saw [...] Hill, Dale, and shadie Woods, and sunnie Plaines, [...] And liquid Lapse of murmuring Streams; by these, [...] Creatures that livd, and movd, and walk'd, or flew, [...] Birds on the branches warbling; all things smil'd, [...] With fragrance and with joy my heart oreflow'd. [...] My self I then perus'd, and Limb by Limb [...] Survey'd, and sometimes went, and sometimes ran [...] With supple joints, as lively vigour led: [...] But who I was, or where, or from what cause, [...] 270 [...] Knew not; to speak I tri'd, and forthwith spake, [...] My Tongue obey'd and readily could name [...] What e're I saw. Thou Sun, said I, faire Light, [...] And thou enlight'nd Earth, so fresh and gay, [...] Ye Hills and Dales, ye Rivers, Woods, and Plaines, [...] And ye that live and move, fair Creatures, tell, [...] Tell, if ye saw, how came I thus, how here? [...] Not of my self; by some great Maker then, [...] In goodness and in power praeeminent; [...] Tell me, how may I know him, how adore, [...] 280 [...] From whom I have that thus I move and live, [...] And feel that I am happier then I know. [...] While thus I call'd, and stray'd I knew not whither, [...] From where I first drew Aire, and first beheld [...] This happie Light, when answer none return'd, [...] On a green shadie Bank profuse of Flours [...] Pensive I sate me down; there gentle sleep [...] First found me, and with soft oppression seis'd [...] My droused sense, untroubl'd, though I thought [...] I then was passing to my former state [...] 290 [...] Insensible, and forthwith to dissolve: [...] When suddenly stood at my Head a dream, [...] Whose inward apparition gently mov'd [...] My Fancy to believe I yet had being, [...] And livd: One came, methought, of shape Divine, [...] And said, thy Mansion wants thee, Adam, rise, [...] First Man, of Men innumerable ordain'd [...] First Father, call'd by thee I come thy Guide [...] To the Garden of bliss, thy seat prepar'd. [...] So saying, by the hand he took me rais'd, [...] 300 [...] And over Fields and Waters, as in Aire [...] Smooth sliding without step, last led me up [...] A woodie Mountain; whose high top was plaine, [...] A Circuit wide, enclos'd, with goodliest Trees [...] Planted, with Walks, and Bowers, that what I saw [...] Of Earth before scarse pleasant seemd. Each Tree [...] Load'n with fairest Fruit, that hung to the Eye [...] Tempting, stirr'd in me sudden appetite [...] To pluck and eate; whereat I wak'd, and found [...] Before mine Eyes all real, as the dream [...] 310 [...] Had lively shadowd: Here had new begun [...] My wandring, had not hee who was my Guide [...] Up hither, from among the Trees appeer'd, [...] Presence Divine. Rejoycing, but with aw [...] In adoration at his feet I fell [...] Submiss: he rear'd me, & Whom thou soughtst I am, [...] Said mildely, Author of all this thou seest [...] Above, or round about thee or beneath. [...] This Paradise I give thee, count it thine [...] To Till and keep, and of the Fruit to eate: [...] 320 [...] Of every Tree that in the Garden growes [...] Eate freely with glad heart; fear here no dearth: [...] But of the Tree whose operation brings [...] Knowledg of good and ill, which I have set [...] The Pledge of thy Obedience and thy Faith, [...] Amid the Garden by the Tree of Life, [...] Remember what I warne thee, shun to taste, [...] And shun the bitter consequence: for know, [...] The day thou eat'st thereof, my sole command [...] Transgrest, inevitably thou shalt dye; [...] 330 [...] From that day mortal, and this happie State [...] Shalt loose, expell'd from hence into a World [...] Of woe and sorrow. Sternly he pronounc'd [...] The rigid interdiction, which resounds [...] Yet dreadful in mine eare, though in my choice [...] Not to incur; but soon his cleer aspect [...] Return'd and gratious purpose thus renew'd. [...] Not onely these fair bounds, but all the Earth [...] To thee and to thy Race I give; as Lords [...] Possess it, and all things that therein live, [...] 340 [...] Or live in Sea, or Aire, Beast, Fish, and Fowle. [...] In signe whereof each Bird and Beast behold [...] After thir kindes; I bring them to receave [...] From thee thir Names, and pay thee fealtie [...] With low subjection; understand the same [...] Of Fish within thir watry residence, [...] Not hither summond, since they cannot change [...] Thir Element to draw the thinner Aire. [...] As thus he spake, each Bird and Beast behold [...] Approaching two and two, These cowring low [...] 350 [...] With blandishment, each Bird stoop'd on his wing. [...] I nam'd them, as they pass'd, and understood [...] Thir Nature, with such knowledg God endu'd [...] My sudden apprehension: but in these [...] I found not what me thought I wanted still; [...] And to the Heav'nly vision thus presum'd. [...] O by what Name, for thou above all these, [...] Above mankinde, or aught then mankinde higher, [...] Surpassest farr my naming, how may I [...] Adore thee, Author of this Universe, [...] 360 [...] And all this good to man, for whose well being [...] So amply, and with hands so liberal [...] Thou hast provided all things: but with mee [...] I see not who partakes. In solitude [...] What happiness, who can enjoy alone, [...] Or all enjoying, what contentment find? [...] Thus I presumptuous; and the vision bright, [...] As with a smile more bright'nd, thus repli'd. [...] What call'st thou solitude, is not the Earth [...] With various living creatures, and the Aire [...] 370 [...] Replenisht, and all these at thy command [...] To come and play before thee, know'st thou not [...] Thir language and thir wayes, they also know, [...] And reason not contemptibly; with these [...] Find pastime, and beare rule; thy Realm is large. [...] So spake the Universal Lord, and seem'd [...] So ordering. I with leave of speech implor'd, [...] And humble deprecation thus repli'd. [...] Let not my words offend thee, Heav'nly Power, [...] My Maker, be propitious while I speak. [...] 380 [...] Hast thou not made me here thy substitute, [...] And these inferiour farr beneath me set? [...] Among unequals what societie [...] Can sort, what harmonie or true delight? [...] Which must be mutual, in proportion due [...] Giv'n and receiv'd; but in disparitie [...] The one intense, the other still remiss [...] Cannot well suite with either, but soon prove [...] Tedious alike: Of fellowship I speak [...] Such as I seek, fit to participate [...] 390 [...] All rational delight, wherein the brute [...] Cannot be human consort; they rejoyce [...] Each with thir kinde, Lion with Lioness; [...] So fitly them in pairs thou hast combin'd; [...] Much less can Bird with Beast, or Fish with Fowle [...] So well converse, nor with the Ox the Ape; [...] Wors then can Man with Beast, and least of all. [...] Whereto th' Almighty answer'd, not displeas'd. [...] A nice and suttle happiness I see [...] Thou to thy self proposest, in the choice [...] 400 [...] Of thy Associates, Adam, and wilt taste [...] No pleasure, though in pleasure, solitarie. [...] What thinkst thou then of mee, and this my State, [...] Seem I to thee sufficiently possest [...] Of happiness, or not? who am alone [...] From all Eternitie, for none I know [...] Second to mee or like, equal much less. [...] How have I then with whom to hold converse [...] Save with the Creatures which I made, and those [...] To me inferiour, infinite descents [...] 410 [...] Beneath what other Creatures are to thee? [...] He ceas'd, I lowly answer'd. To attaine [...] The highth and depth of thy Eternal wayes [...] All human thoughts come short, Supream of things; [...] Thou in thy self art perfet, and in thee [...] Is no deficience found; not so is Man, [...] But in degree, the cause of his desire [...] By conversation with his like to help, [...] Or solace his defects. No need that thou [...] Shouldst propagat, already infinite; [...] 420 [...] And through all numbers absolute, though One; [...] But Man by number is to manifest [...] His single imperfection, and beget [...] Like of his like, his Image multipli'd, [...] In unitie defective, which requires [...] Collateral love, and deerest amitie. [...] Thou in thy secresie although alone, [...] Best with thy self accompanied, seek'st not [...] Social communication, yet so pleas'd, [...] Canst raise thy Creature to what highth thou wilt [...] 430 [...] Of Union or Communion, deifi'd; [...] I by conversing cannot these erect [...] From prone, nor in thir wayes complacence find. [...] Thus I embold'nd spake, and freedom us'd [...] Permissive, and acceptance found, which gain'd [...] This answer from the gratious voice Divine. [...] Thus farr to try thee, Adam, I was pleas'd, [...] And finde thee knowing not of Beasts alone, [...] Which thou hast rightly nam'd, but of thy self, [...] Expressing well the spirit within thee free, [...] 440 [...] My Image, not imparted to the Brute, [...] Whose fellowship therefore unmeet for thee [...] Good reason was thou freely shouldst dislike, [...] And be so minded still; I, ere thou spak'st, [...] Knew it not good for Man to be alone, [...] And no such companie as then thou saw'st [...] Intended thee, for trial onely brought, [...] To see how thou could'st judge of fit and meet: [...] What next I bring shall please thee, be assur'd, [...] Thy likeness, thy fit help, thy other self, [...] 450 [...] Thy wish, exactly to thy <b>hearts</b> <b>desire.</b> [...] Hee ended, or I heard no more, for now [...] My earthly by his Heav'nly overpowerd, [...] Which it had long stood under, streind to the highth [...] In that celestial Colloquie sublime, [...] As with an object that excels the sense, [...] Dazl'd and spent, sunk down, and sought repair [...] Of sleep, which instantly fell on me, call'd [...] By Nature as in aide, and clos'd mine eyes. [...] Mine eyes he clos'd, but op'n left the Cell [...] 460 [...] Of Fancie my internal sight, by which [...] Abstract as in a transe methought I saw, [...] Though sleeping, where I lay, and saw the shape [...] Still glorious before whom awake I stood; [...] Who stooping op'nd my left side, and took [...] From thence a Rib, with cordial spirits warme, [...] And Life-blood streaming fresh; wide was the wound, [...] But suddenly with flesh fill'd up & heal'd: [...] The Rib he formd and fashond with his hands; [...] Under his forming hands a Creature grew, [...] 470 [...] Manlike, but different sex, so lovly faire, [...] That what seemd fair in all the World, seemd now [...] Mean, or in her summd up, in her containd [...] And in her looks, which from that time infus'd [...] Sweetness into my heart, unfelt before, [...] And into all things from her Aire inspir'd [...] The spirit of love and amorous delight. [...] She disappeerd, and left me dark, I wak'd [...] To find her, or for ever to deplore [...] Her loss, and other pleasures all abjure: [...] 480 [...] When out of hope, behold her, not farr off, [...] Such as I saw her in my dream, adornd [...] With what all Earth or Heaven could bestow [...] To make her amiable: On she came, [...] Led by her Heav'nly Maker, though unseen, [...] And guided by his voice, nor uninformd [...] Of nuptial Sanctitie and marriage Rites: [...] Grace was in all her steps, Heav'n in her Eye, [...] In every gesture dignitie and love. [...] I overjoyd could not forbear aloud. [...] 490 [...] This turn hath made amends; thou hast fulfill'd [...] Thy words, Creator bounteous and benigne, [...] Giver of all things faire, but fairest this [...] Of all thy gifts, nor enviest. I now see [...] Bone of my Bone, Flesh of my Flesh, my Self [...] Before me; Woman is her Name, of Man [...] Extracted; for this cause he shall forgoe [...] Father and Mother, and to his Wife adhere; [...] And they shall be one Flesh, one Heart, one Soule. [...] She heard me thus, and though divinely brought, [...] 500 [...] Yet Innocence and Virgin Modestie, [...] Her vertue and the conscience of her worth, [...] That would be woo'd, and not unsought be won, [...] Not obvious, not obtrusive, but retir'd, [...] The more desirable, or to say all, [...] Nature her self, though pure of sinful thought, [...] Wrought in her so, that seeing me, she turn'd; [...] I follow'd her, she what was Honour knew, [...] And with obsequious Majestie approv'd [...] My pleaded reason. To the Nuptial Bowre [...] 510 [...] I led her blushing like the Morn: all Heav'n, [...] And happie Constellations on that houre [...] Shed thir selectest influence; the Earth [...] Gave sign of gratulation, and each Hill; [...] Joyous the Birds; fresh Gales and gentle Aires [...] Whisper'd it to the Woods, and from thir wings [...] Flung Rose, flung Odours from the spicie Shrub, [...] Disporting, till the amorous Bird of Night [...] Sung Spousal, and bid haste the Eevning Starr [...] On his Hill top, to light the bridal Lamp. [...] 520 [...] Thus I have told thee all my State, and brought [...] My Storie to the sum of earthly bliss [...] Which I enjoy, and must confess to find [...] In all things else delight indeed, but such [...] As us'd or not, works in the mind no change, [...] Nor vehement desire, these delicacies [...] I mean of Taste, Sight, Smell, Herbs, Fruits, & Flours, [...] Walks, and the melodie of Birds; but here [...] Farr otherwise, transported I behold, [...] Transported touch; here passion first I felt, [...] 530 [...] Commotion strange, in all enjoyments else [...] Superiour and unmov'd, here onely weake [...] Against the charm of Beauties powerful glance. [...] Or Nature faild in mee, and left some part [...] Not proof enough such Object to sustain, [...] Or from my side subducting, took perhaps [...] More then enough; at least on her bestow'd [...] Too much of Ornament, in outward shew [...] Elaborate, of inward less exact. [...] For well I understand in the prime end [...] 540 [...] Of Nature her th' inferiour, in the mind [...] And inward Faculties, which most excell, [...] In outward also her resembling less [...] His Image who made both, and less expressing [...] The character of that Dominion giv'n [...] O're other Creatures; yet when I approach [...] Her loveliness, so absolute she seems [...] And in her self compleat, so well to know [...] Her own, that what she wills to do or say, [...] Seems wisest, vertuousest, discreetest, best; [...] 550 [...] All higher knowledge in her presence falls [...] Degraded, Wisdom in discourse with her [...] Looses discount'nanc't, and like folly shewes; [...] Authoritie and Reason on her waite, [...] As one intended first, not after made [...] Occasionally; and to consummate all, [...] Greatness of mind and nobleness thir seat [...] Build in her loveliest, and create an awe [...] About her, as a guard Angelic plac't.
