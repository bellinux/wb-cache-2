500|$|Because of its {{previous}} {{contributions to the}} series—Halo 2s Blastacular and Halo: Reachs Defiant map pack—Certain Affinity was approached by 343 Industries to streamline the multiplayer maps to take Halo: Reachs gameplay options into account. The multiplayer is powered by the Halo: Reach engine. 343 Industries director Frank O'Connor said {{that the decision to}} use Reach for the multiplayer was controversial, even within the studio. [...] "In Halos day, there was never a proper networking mode," [...] O'Connor explained. [...] "We couldn't roll back the technology; [...] just wouldn't have worked with things like latency and all other modern Xbox Live-related problems. So we would have had to build it from scratch, and it still wouldn't have been the experience [...] remember." [...] An additional consideration O'Connor mentioned was that producing a full replication of Combat Evolveds multiplayer would have divided the Halo player base and interrupted Reachs lifespan. <b>In</b> <b>choosing</b> <b>which</b> seven Halo maps to remake, 343 Industries set a number of rules—the map could not have been previously remade for a 360-era Halo title, it had to work with Reachs gameplay sandbox, and {{it had to be a}} fan favorite. The company retained the same art director between the campaign and multiplayer elements of Anniversary to make sure the two halves of the game looked visually cohesive.|$|E

2500|$|Tryon {{had four}} months leave before being {{appointed}} Permanent Secretary to the Admiralty. This post, {{in charge of}} a civilian staff, was sometimes given to serving officers and sometimes civilians. Tryon demonstrated great powers of persuasion and an ability to get his way in an argument without offending. His appointment was initially temporary, following the sudden death of the previous appointee, but he proved a great success. [...] One of his most significant contributions was in advancing proposals {{for the creation of a}} naval intelligence committee, whose duties would be to collect together all available intelligence both from naval officers and from the army intelligence department. [...] Those first appointed to the committee were Mr Hoste from the civilian establishment and Commander William Hall. The role of Permanent Secretary included many invitations to social engagements, receptions banquets and dinners. Tryon's guiding rule <b>in</b> <b>choosing</b> <b>which</b> invitations to accept was to seek out people who might have useful information. He stated that he learnt something from everybody.|$|E
2500|$|One {{possibility}} is that bilinguals initially {{make a decision about}} the language of the word and then activate the appropriate language-selected lexicon. In this mechanism, an executive system directs the language switch for the input word. In earlier studies, researchers found that bilinguals can comprehend passages composed of words entirely from only one language more quickly than passages composed of words from both languages. They explain this result as an involuntary switch that happens when bilinguals comprehend passages with two languages. When comprehension procedures in one language fail due to the language contextually changing, then the switch mechanism will automatically direct input to another language system. Therefore, bilinguals are slower at reading mixed language passages than at single language passages because they must spend time on switching languages. However, those studies failed to consider that the two languages might be activated simultaneously and there might be a later lexical competition <b>in</b> <b>choosing</b> <b>which</b> language information to use. The later lexical completion {{can also be used to}} explain why bilinguals spend more time understanding passages in mixed languages. [...] However, other studies have found that there is no significant cost incurred by inter-sentential language switching and mixing. showed that there was no cost to switching between languages when bilinguals read sentences for comprehension. Additionally, Guzzardo Tamargo, R.E. found that when making metalinguistic judgments and performing non-comprehension based tasks, switch costs were evident but there was no evidence to support the hypothesis that there is a cost at the switch site when bilinguals read a mixed sentence. This indicates that under normal circumstances and given sufficient linguistic context, language switching does not incur a cost.|$|E

The game gets very tactical particularly <b>in</b> <b>choosing</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> hand to place the tippit and particularly skillful players play like good poker players, hiding their emotions or even trying to mislead their opponents using facial gestures, body language and verbal banter.

60|$|P. S.--Nov, 4. I wish I {{could learn}} to {{remember}} that it is unjust and dishonorable to put blame upon the human race for any of its acts. For it did not make itself, it did not make its nature, it is merely a machine, it is moved wholly by outside influences, it has no hand in creating the outside influences nor <b>in</b> <b>choosing</b> <b>which</b> of them it will welcome or reject, its performance is wholly automatic, it has no more mastership nor authority over its mind than it has over its stomach, which receives material from the outside and does as it pleases with it, indifferent to it's proprietor's suggestions, even, let alone his commands; wherefore, whatever the machine does--so called crimes and infamies included--is the personal act of its Maker, and He, solely, is responsible. I wish I {{could learn to}} pity the human race instead of censuring it and laughing at it; and I could, if the outside influences of old habit were not so strong upon my machine. It vexes me to catch myself praising the clean private citizen Roosevelt, and blaming the soiled President Roosevelt, when I know that neither praise nor blame is due to him for any thought or word or deed of his, he being merely a helpless and irresponsible coffee-mill ground by the hand of God.|$|E
