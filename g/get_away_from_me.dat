25|$|The {{recording}} {{sessions for}} McKay's debut album <b>Get</b> <b>Away</b> <b>from</b> <b>Me</b> {{took place in}} August 2003 with Geoff Emerick as producer. Emerick was known for working as the Beatles' engineer on such albums as Revolver and Abbey Road. The title is a play on Norah Jones' Come Away with Me. McKay {{is said to be}} the first woman to release a double album as her first release. Originally, her contract with Columbia called for 13 songs, but McKay aggressively lobbied her label for a double album, including bottles of wine, a PowerPoint slideshow, and a mock photo of her threatening Emerick with a gun.|$|E
500|$|Bill Muehlenberg from Australian Family Association {{believed}} Lana's {{introduction and}} storyline {{was just an}} attempt to increase ratings. A Sydney Star Observer reporter praised Lana's cousin, Sindi, for being sympathetic and reacting {{in a positive way}} when Lana came out to her. The reporter also praised Sky's reaction for being [...] "more let's talk about it than <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>me,</b> you lezzo freak", while adding that it seemed Neighbours had wanted Lana to be a [...] "sympathetic gay character", which must have upset the Christian groups. Of Lana's storyline, a writer for AfterEllen stated, [...] "The significance of this depiction was that it occurred in a relatively conservative, family-oriented show with a large child viewership, and all the major sympathetic characters were presented as supportive of Lana's sexuality, with the bullies being depicted as villains." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Get</b> <b>Away</b> <b>from</b> <b>Me</b> was {{released}} in February 2004. Jon Pareles of The New York Times called the album [...] "a tour de force from a sly, articulate musician who sounds comfortable in any era". The album was included on several [...] "Best of 2004" [...] lists.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{thought you}} did," [...] he whispered, smiling. [...] "I hoped so, anyhow. That settles it, Virginia. You haven't {{a chance of}} <b>getting</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>me,</b> dear. You may just as well {{make up your mind}} to be Mrs. Mildmay as soon as I can get that license." ...|$|R
6000|$|Her mother ran to her, {{eager to}} seize the poorest excuse for <b>getting</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>me.</b> I followed; I {{stretched}} out my hands to seize her. She suddenly turned round on me, a woman transformed. A bright flush was on her face, an eager wonder sparkled in her eyes. Snatching Elfie's coveted object out of the child's hand, she held it up before me. I saw it under the lamp-light. It was my little forgotten keepsake--the Green Flag! ...|$|R
2500|$|A {{new life}} started for Ibrahim. His mission now {{was to call}} his people to monotheism. He started with his father, the closest person to him and whom he loved greatly. He said {{to him in the}} softest and kindest voice: [...] "O father! Why do you worship that which doesn't hear, doesn't see, and cannot avail you in anything? O father, I have got {{knowledge}} which you have not, so follow me. I will guide you to a straight path." [...] His father replied angrily: [...] "Do you reject my gods, O Ibrahim? If you don't stop I will stone you to death! <b>Get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> before I punish you!" [...] Ibrahim replied: [...] "Peace be on you! I will ask forgiveness of my Lord for you." ...|$|E
2500|$|Once Dawn Doughnuts became {{profitable}} in late 1936, Smith {{wrote an}} 85-page outline for {{what became the}} four core Lensman novels; in early 1937, Tremaine committed to buying them. Segmenting the story into four novels required considerable effort to avoid dangling loose ends; Smith cites Edgar Rice Burroughs as a negative example. After the outline was complete, he wrote a more detailed outline of Galactic Patrol, plus a detailed graph of its structure, with [...] "peaks of emotional intensity and the valleys of characterization and background material." [...] He notes, however, that he {{was never able to}} follow any of his outlines at all closely, as the [...] "characters <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> and do exactly as they damn please." [...] After completing the rough draft of Galactic Patrol, he wrote the concluding chapter of the last book in the series, Children of the Lens. Galactic Patrol was published in the September 1937 through February 1938 issues of Astounding; unlike the revised book edition, it was not set in the same universe as Triplanetary.|$|E

"Give me a loan of the link, Dick," [...] said he; and then, {{when he had}} a good light, [...] "That'll do, lad," [...] he added; [...] "stick the glim in {{the wood}} heap; and you, gentlemen, bring yourselves to! You needn't stand up for Mr. Hawkins; HE'LL excuse you, you may lay to that. And so, Jim"--stopping the tobacco--"here you were, and quite a {{pleasant}} surprise for poor old John.

60|$|This makes {{a number}} of fish that have <b>gotten</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> in this manner. It is {{exasperating}} and difficult to explain. I {{have to use a}} pretty heavy sinker in order to cast the bait out. I have arranged this sinker, which has a hole through it, so that the line will run freely. This seems to work all right on the bite, but I am afraid it does not work after the fish is hooked. That sinker drags on the bottom. This is the best rigging that I can plan at the present stage of the game. I have an idea now that a bonefish should be hooked hard and then very carefully handled.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm going to, {{and if he}} don't <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> I'll {{ask some}} of the crowd to help me have him arrested," [...] Teddy replied, grimly.|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah, yes," [...] he {{answered}} softly, [...] "I see. Yes, of course, they go by rail. They go by rail, no doubt. How very stupid of me!" [...] And {{he turned on}} his heel as if to <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> as quickly as possible.|$|E
5000|$|... "Phonebill Song" [...] is a punk-style track {{composed}} of three chords, {{and seems to}} be a tongue-in-cheek reference to Love spending too much time talking on the telephone, with lyrics like [...] "Before I go to sleep / <b>Get</b> it <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> / Gotta run the phonebill up." ...|$|R

6000|$|I hope to <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> here--let <b>me</b> {{not speak}} of it ungratefully--from here--by Thursday at latest.

6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me if I were you I'd get {{on the trail of}} your Uncle Lester somehow," [...] was Roger's comment.

60|$|I had got so far, {{and she was}} {{climbing}} the stile with some pretence of <b>getting</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>me,</b> when there came a van along the road, belonging, as I discovered, to a baker in Swinehurst. The horse, which was of a brown colour, was such as is bred in the New Forest, being somewhat under fifteen hands and of a hairy, ill-kempt variety. As I know less than the master about horses, I will say no more of this horse, save to repeat that its colour was brown--nor indeed had the horse nor the horse's colour {{anything to do with}} my narrative. I might add, however, that it could either be taken as a small horse or as a large pony, being somewhat tall for the one, but undersized for the other. I have now said enough about this horse, which {{has nothing to do with}} my story, and I will turn my attention to the driver.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{ought to}} see more of her," [...] he thought. [...] "She <b>gets</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>me.</b> Just as her mother did." [...] A man need not suspect his womenkind but he should know what they are doing. It is duty, his {{protective}} duty to them. These companions, these Seyffert women and so forth, were all very well in their way; there wasn't much they kept from you if you got them cornered and asked them intently. But a father's eye is better. He must go about with the girl for a time, watch her with other men, give her chances to talk business with him and see if she took them. [...] "V.V., I'm going to make a man of you," [...] the phrase ran through his brain. The deep instinctive jealousy of the primordial father was still strong in old Grammont's blood. It would be pleasant to go about with her on his right hand in Paris, HIS girl, straight and lovely, desirable and unapproachable,--above that sort of nonsense, above all other masculine subjugation.|$|R
6000|$|... "As I've said before, they won't {{admit that}} the deeds old Mrs. Martinson had were any good. The {{fact of the matter}} is, Slogwell Brown wants to <b>get</b> those deeds <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>me.</b> He has been at me to let him look at the deeds several times, but I've always refused, for I was afraid that if he got the deeds <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> I would never see them again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] he said gravely, {{though there}} was a faint ring of exultation in his voice, [...] "that is for a sign that you belong to me, and I guess I'm strong enough to keep what is mine. You couldn't <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> if you wanted to." ...|$|E
6000|$|MURRAY (with cold rage before {{which the}} other slinks away). Peters, the more I see of you the better I like a skunk!

6000|$|... "You shan't <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> {{as easily}} as that," [...] the youth muttered to himself, and ran out into the opening. Here the snow was so thick he could see but little, yet he kept on, and soon reached more brushwood. He saw some {{branches}} close to the snow move, and blazed away in the dark.|$|E
2500|$|Injuries put {{holes in}} the Nationals' {{starting}} lineup in the games after they clinched the division. Right fielder Bryce Harper was injured in a September 25 game against the Pirates, jamming his thumb when Pirates third baseman Jung Ho Kang faked a tag that prompted {{him to make a}} late slide into third. Nationals manager Dusty Baker took exception to the play, and when Kang next came up to bat, Cole threw a ball behind his back and was ejected from the game, leading to a benches-clearing altercation on the field. Cole denied the pitch was intentional, saying, [...] "The ball was <b>getting</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>me</b> a little bit, and that one got <b>away</b> <b>from</b> me." [...] He was suspended five games over the incident and fined, a verdict which he appealed. In the following game, a rain-soaked September 26 matchup with the Arizona Diamondbacks, catcher Wilson Ramos tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee for the second time after making a leaping catch on a relay from first baseman Ryan Zimmerman, forcing him to undergo season-ending surgery. Spencer Kieboom was called up from Harrisburg to replace him on the roster. However, the team also received some bullpen reinforcements as Belisle returned from his injury layoff to pitch against the Pirates in the September 25 game while left-handed reliever Sammy Solis was activated off the disabled list on September 26 and pitched a perfect inning in a 4–2 win over the Diamondbacks the following day.|$|R

500|$|Speaking {{about the}} {{conception}} of the album, Aguilera told MTV News that [...] "it is a new beginning, a re-introduction {{of myself as a}} new artist in a way, because for the first time people are really seeing and getting to know who I really am". She also revealed, [...] "Coming off of the height of being a part of such a big pop-craze phenomenon, that imagery of that cookie-cutter sweetheart, without it being me, I just had to take it all down and <b>get</b> it <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>me.</b> And that is why I actually named the album Stripped, because it is about being emotionally stripped down and pretty bare to open my soul and heart".
