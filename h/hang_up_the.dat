25|$|With the {{introduction}} of microcomputers with expansion slots, like the S-100 bus machines and Apple II, it became possible for the modem to communicate instructions and data on separate lines. A number of modems of this sort were available by the late 1970s. This made the BBS possible for the first time, as it allowed software on the computer to pick up an incoming call, communicate with the user, and then <b>hang</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> call when the user logged off.|$|E
25|$|Several {{solutions}} to the problem were studied, and in the end Heatherington decided the only practical one was to have the modem operate in two modes. In one, data mode, all data forwarded from the computer were modulated and sent over the connected telephone line as it was with any other modem. In the other, command mode, data forwarded from the computer were instead interpreted as commands. In this way, the modem could be instructed by the computer to perform various operations, such as <b>hang</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> phone or dial a number. The modem would normally start up in command mode.|$|E

Adams moved into the White House in November 1800, living there for only the last four months of her husband's term. The city was wilderness, the President's House far from completion.

2500|$|Some of Watts’ {{writings}} {{published in}} 1958 (e.g., his book Nature, Man and Woman and his essay [...] "The New Alchemy") mentioned {{some of his}} early views {{on the use of}} psychedelic drugs for mystical insight. Watts had begun to experiment with psychedelics, initially with mescaline given to him by Oscar Janiger. He tried LSD several times in 1958, with various research teams led by Keith S. Ditman, Sterling Bunnell, Jr., and Michael Agron. He also tried marijuana and concluded that it was a useful and interesting psychoactive drug that gave the impression of time slowing down. Watts' books of the '60s reveal the influence of these chemical adventures on his outlook. He later said about psychedelic drug use, [...] "If you get the message, <b>hang</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> phone.

Donna Deitch assured her over the phone that she was right for her movie and told her she refused to <b>hang</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> phone until she got an answer. After five minutes, Shaver accepted the role. Shaver explained her feelings about the film. [...] "I was scared, not about the lesbianism [...] the script said, 'The passion builds' in the love scene, so once I knew how the passion built and where the camera would be, that was fine [...] but because someone wanted me to do what I'd wanted to do all along, and here it was, and all I had to do was say yes.
