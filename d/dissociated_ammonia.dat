The off-gases from the reduction reactors were passed to a hydrogen burner where the excess hydrogen was burned and then passed through a dust collector to remove any entrained uranium dioxide that might have been present. The UO2 in the reduction furnace passed through a seal hopper and a feed screw to the first of the three hydrofluorination furnaces. The bed of UO2 was moved through the hydrofluorination furnace by ribbon flight screws and contacted counter-currently by hydrofluoric acid vapors. The UF4 was removed from the third furnace and conveyed to a packaging station where the product was packaged in 10-gallon pails for use in the Metal Plant, or in 5-ton containers for shipment to the cascades. The off-gases containing water vapor formed in the reaction and excess hydrofluoric acid was removed from the first furnace and were sent to hydrofluoric acid recovery. The gases first passed to a partial condenser that removed all of the water in the form of 70% aqueous hydrofluoric acid. The remainder of the gases was then passed to a total condenser, which condenses the remainder of the acid as anhydrous hydrofluoric acid. The gases at this point contain only the nitrogen from seals and purge gases and small amounts of hydrofluoric acid that did not condense in the total condenser. These were passed through potassium hydroxide scrubbers to remove the last traces of acid and then discharged to the atmosphere.|$|E

Further growth via liquid-phase epitaxy through In droplets leads the growth in one dimension (1 D), resulting in the formation of InN nanowires. The details about the nucleation and growth aspects within these self-catalysis schemes are rationalized further by demonstrating the growth of heteroepitaxially oriented nanowire arrays on single-crystal substrates and “tree-like ” morphologies on a variety of substrates.

40|$|The proven {{feasibility}} of ammonia combustion in compression-ignition engines {{has led to}} it being considered as a carbon-free replacement for diesel fuel. Due to its high auto-ignition temperature, however, a more realistic strategy would be to aim for a step-change reduction in carbon emissions by co-fuelling a diesel engine with ammonia. In assessing this strategy, ammonia gas was introduced into the air-intake manifold of a compression-ignition engine, while diesel fuel was injected directly into the cylinder to ignite the mixture. By substituting only 3 % of the air intake by ammonia, the diesel consumption and the CO 2 emissions decreased by 15 %. The combustion and emission characteristics were then compared when the same percentage of air intake (by mass) was substituted by either <b>dissociated</b> <b>ammonia</b> (a mixture of H 2, N 2 with small percentages of NH 3) or pure hydrogen, to mimic the other possible forms in which the co-fuel can be delivered to the engine.

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} {{is to develop a}} physically-based, semi-empirical model that {{describes}} the concentration of indoor concentration of PM- 2. 5 (particle mass that is less than 2. 5 microns in diameter) and its sulfate, nitrate, organic and black carbon constituents, derived from outdoor sources. We have established the methodology and experimental plan for building the model. Experimental measurements in residential style houses, in Richmond and Fresno, California, are being conducted to provide parameters for and evaluation of this model. The model will be used to improve estimates of human exposures to PM- 2. 5 of outdoor origin. The objectives of this study are to perform measurement and modeling tasks that produce a tested, semi-mechanistic description of chemical species-specific and residential PM- 2. 5 arising from the combination of outdoor PM and gas phase sources (HNO{sub 3 } and NH{sub 3 }), and indoor gas phase (e. g. NH{sub 3 }) sources. We specifically address how indoor PM is affected by differences between indoor and outdoor temperature and relative humidity. In addition, we are interested in losses of particles within the building and as they migrate through the building shell. The resulting model will be general enough to predict probability distributions for species-specific indoor concentrations of PM- 2. 5 based on outdoor PM, and gas phase species concentrations, meteorological conditions, building construction characteristics, and HVAC operating conditions. Controlled intensive experiments were conducted at a suburban research house located in Clovis, California. The experiments utilized a large suite of instruments including conventional aerosol, meteorological and house characterization devices. In addition, two new instruments were developed providing high time resolution for the important particulate species of nitrate, sulfate, and carbon as well as important gaseous species including ammonia and nitric acid. Important initial observations include the result that, with rare exceptions, there is virtually no nitrate found inside the house. This nitrate appears to <b>dissociate</b> into <b>ammonia</b> and nitric acid with the nitric acid quickly depositing out. Initial model development has included work on characterizing penetration and deposition rates, the dynamic behavior of the indoor/outdoor ratio, and predicting infiltration rates. Results from the exploration of the indoor/outdoor ratio show that the traditional assumption of steady state conditions does not hold in general. Many values of the indoor/outdoor ratio exist for any single value of the infiltration rate. Successful prediction of the infiltration rate from measured driving variables is important for extending the results from the Clovis house to the larger housing stock...|$|R

40|$|III-nitrides (InN, GaN, AlN) {{are some}} of the most {{promising}} materials for making blue light emitting diodes (LED), blue laser diodes (LD) and high power, high temperature field effect transistors (FET). Current techniques produce GaN films with defect densities on the order of 107 /cm 2 or higher. The performance and life-time of the devices critically depend upon the defect densities and high power, high frequency devices require the defect densities to be lower than 104 /cm 2. So, the need for new processes to produce large size GaN crystals with defect densities less than 107 /cm 2 is immediate. In addition to large area single crystals (or wafers), the nanowires also present as an alternating platform for making devices. So, the processes for controlled synthesis, modifying and integrating sub 100 nm nanowires into electronic devices are of great interest. This thesis presents a new concept of ‘self-oriented growth 2 ̆ 7 of GaN platelets shaped crystals on molten gallium to produce near single crystal quality GaN films over large areas (3 ̆e 1 cm²). The process involves direct nitridation of Ga films using nitrogen plasma at low pressures (few mTorr). GaN flakes with areas over 25 mm² have been successfully obtained. Raman spectra of the resulting GaN crystals show no stress and low native donor concentration on the order of 1017 /cm³. XRD texture analysis showed an overall c-axis tilt of 2. 2 o between GaN domains within the flake. The cross-sectional TEM micrographs showed that the resulting GaN films are free from dislocation crops inside the grains but showed diffraction contrast due to small mis-orientation between the grains. The twist and tilt angles between adjacent columnar grains were determined using convergent beam electron diffraction technique to be less than 8 o and 1 o, respectively. HRTEM micrographs of the grain boundaries showed sharp interfaces resulting with both twisted and perfect attachments. This thesis also presents direct synthesis approach for GaN nanowires with control on growth directions using modified nitridation conditions. The nitridation in the presence of hydrogen or ammonia resulted in oxide sheath free GaN nanowires as thin as 20 nm and long as 100 Ìm in 3 ̆c 00013 ̆e direction. The nitridation using low Ga flux in a vapor transport set-up resulted in sub 100 nm GaN nanowires with 3 ̆c 10 - 103 ̆e growth direction.
