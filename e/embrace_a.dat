5|$|In response, Tyler, already {{ejected from}} the Whig party, quickly began to {{organize}} a third party in hopes of inducing the Democrats to <b>embrace</b> <b>a</b> pro-expansionist platform. By running as a third-party candidate, Tyler threatened to siphon off pro-annexation Democratic voters; Democratic party disunity would mean the election of Henry Clay, a staunchly anti-Texas Whig. Pro-annexation delegates among southern Democrats, with assistance {{from a number of}} northern delegates, blocked anti-expansion candidate Martin Van Buren at the convention, which instead nominated the pro-expansion champion of Manifest Destiny, James K. Polk of Tennessee. Polk unified his party under the banner of Texas and Oregon acquisition.|$|E
5|$|In Syria, ethnic {{minorities}} were often underprivileged, and a specific ethnicity often {{belonged to a}} specific social class. The Alawites, the Druzes and the Isma'ilis for instance, were ethnic groups with low social class who began to <b>embrace</b> <b>a</b> radical form of Arab nationalism, e.g. Ba'athism. Without the peasantry there {{could not have been}} a Ba'athist revolution in Syria. The new middle class alone could only produce instability, but together with the peasantry, the revolution became possible. The inequality between urban and rural dwellers, together with capitalist penetration of the agrarian sector and the traditional elites' monopolisation of most large revenue sources, led to the establishment of peasant movements who fought for change, or opposed the system. The Syrian branch of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party was able to recruit young peasants from radical peasant movements, and because of it, was able to mobilise large sectors of the population.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, Among the {{religious}} and Orthodox groups in Israel, many individuals chose to part from the religious lifestyle and <b>embrace</b> <b>a</b> secular lifestyle (they {{are referred to as}} Yotz'im bish'ela). A research conducted in 2011 estimated that about 30 percent of the national religious youth from the religious lifestyle and <b>embrace</b> <b>a</b> secular lifestyle, but 75 percent of them go back to religion after a formation process of their self-identity, which usually lasts until age 28. Contrary to Baalei teshuva, the Orthodox Jews whom wish to <b>embrace</b> <b>a</b> secular lifestyle only have very few organizations whom assist them in parting from the Haredi world, and often they end up finding themselves destitute or struggling to complete the educational and social gaps. The most prominent organizations whom assist Yotz'im bish'ela are the NGO organizations Hillel and Dror.|$|E

25|$|In the 1980s, {{the band}} began using {{keyboards}} and synthesizers to complement its guitar-based rock.

25|$|ASEAN's planned {{integration}} of its ten member nations has challenged its citizens to <b>embrace</b> <b>a</b> regional identity.

Accordingly, these assumptions will be the basis for recommendations and strategies in developing a participatory regional identity.|$|E
25|$|DAT was {{available}} {{as early as}} 1987 in Japan and Europe, but device manufacturers delayed introducing the format to the United States {{in the face of}} opposition from the recording industry. The recording industry, fearing that the ability to make perfect, multi-generation copies would spur widespread copyright infringement and lost sales, had two main points of leverage over device makers. First, consumer electronics manufacturers felt they needed the recording industry's cooperation to induce consumersmany of whom {{were in the process of}} replacing their cassettes and records with compact discsto <b>embrace</b> <b>a</b> new music format. Second, device makers feared a lawsuit for contributory copyright infringement.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s, the Guardian {{began to}} outspokenly <b>embrace</b> <b>a</b> Marxist–Leninist {{ideology}} {{aligned with the}} Third-worldist and Maoist New Communist Movement, later orienting itself toward a political tendency known as The Trend. The paper editorially called for a new Marxist–Leninist party in the United States. The paper attempted to carve an independent role for itself, ever formally aligning with any particular group and remaining critical of the plethora of small New Left party organizations which emerged after the demise of SDS in 1970. The traditional news-first approach of the original National Guardian was gradually attenuated in the paper's outspokenly revolutionary 1970s incarnation, with editorial and commentary material supplanting straight news reporting.|$|E
