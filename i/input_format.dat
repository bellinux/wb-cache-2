25|$|Gerber {{is used in}} PCB {{fabrication}} data. PCBs {{are designed}} on a specialized electronic design automation (EDA) or a computer-aided design (CAD) system. The CAD systems output PCB fabrication data to allow fabrication of the board. This data typically contains a Gerber file for each image layer (copper layers, solder mask, legend or silk...). Gerber is also the standard image <b>input</b> <b>format</b> for all bare board fabrication equipment needing image data, such as photoplotters, legend printers, direct imagers or automated optical inspection (AOI) machines and for viewing reference images in different departments. For assembly the fabrication data contains the solder paste layers and the central locations of components to create the stencil and place and bond the components.|$|E
25|$|This codec {{incorporated}} into a broadcasting system using COFDM modulation was demonstrated on air and on the field together with Radio Canada and CRC Canada during the NAB show (Las Vegas) in 1991. The implementation of the audio part of this broadcasting system {{was based on a}} two chips encoder (one for the subband transform, one for the psychoacoustic model designed by the team of G. Stoll (IRT Germany), later known as psychoacoustic model I) and a real time decoder using one Motorola 56001 DSP chip running an integer arithmetics software designed by Y.F. Dehery's team (CCETT, France). The simplicity of the corresponding decoder together with the high audio quality of this codec using {{for the first time a}} 48kHz sampling frequency, a 20 bits/sample <b>input</b> <b>format</b> (the highest available sampling standard in 1991, compatible with the AES/EBU professional digital input studio standard) were the main reasons to later adopt the characteristics of MUSICAM as the basic features for an advanced digital music compression codec.|$|E
2500|$|A {{separate}} subcategory of behavior-driven {{development is}} formed by tools that use specifications as an input language rather than user stories. An {{example of this}} style is the RSpec tool that was also developed by Dan North. Specification tools don't use user stories as an <b>input</b> <b>format</b> for test scenarios but rather use functional specifications for units that are being tested. These specifications often have a more technical nature than user stories and are usually less convenient for communication with business personnel than are user stories. An example of a specification for a stack might look like this: ...|$|E

John C. Reynolds emphasizes that formal specification languages are just as much programming languages as are the languages intended for execution. He also argues that textual and even graphical <b>input</b> <b>formats</b> that affect {{the behavior of a}} computer are programming languages, despite the fact they are commonly not Turing-complete, and remarks that ignorance of programming language concepts is the reason for many flaws in <b>input</b> <b>formats.</b>|$|R
