The heat exchanger is integrated with a 50 kW geothermal ORC power plant having a working fluid of R- 245 fa. Two field tests {{were performed to}} examine the system response of the ORC system subject to change of CMTHE. In case 1 where the flow rate in the shell-side of CMTHE is maintained, the pressure variation in the shell-side of CMTHE casts minor variations on heat <b>extraction,</b> ORC <b>power</b> generation, and ORC efficiency during the transient. Moreover, the effect of pressure has barely any influence of the final states of heat <b>extraction,</b> ORC <b>power</b> generation, and ORC efficiency.

A Box-Behnken design and response surface methodology (RSM) were used to investigate the effect of process variables on the ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) of lutein and β-carotene from spinach. Three independent variables, extraction temperature (°C), <b>extraction</b> <b>power</b> (%) and extraction time (min) were studied. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) followed by UV visualization and densitometry was used as a simple and rapid method for both identification and quantification of lutein and β-carotene during UAE. Methanol extracts of leaves from spinach and authentic standards of lutein and β-carotene were separated by normal-phase TLC with ethyl acetate-acetone (5 : 4 (v/v)) as the mobile phase. In this study, the combination of TLC, densitometry, and Box–Behnken with RSM methods were effective for the quantitative analysis of lutein and β-carotene from spinach extracts. The resulting quadratic polynomial models for optimizing lutein and β-carotene from spinach had high coefficients of determination of 0. 96 and 0. 94, respectively. The optimal UAE settings for output of lutein and β-carotene simultaneously from spinach extracts were an extraction temperature of 40 °C, <b>extraction</b> <b>power</b> of 40 % (28 W/cm 3) and extraction time of 16 min.

40|$|In wind farms, {{velocity}} {{deficits in}} the wakes originating from upstream turbines {{result in a}} significant decrease in <b>power</b> <b>extraction</b> in downstream turbine rows. The current control paradigm in industry optimizes <b>power</b> <b>extraction</b> at the turbine level, and does not account for these interactions, leading to sub-optimal wind-farm efficiencies. The current dissertation investigates the use of a coordinated control approach that maximizes <b>power</b> <b>extraction</b> at the wind-farm level instead. To this end, optimal control techniques are combined with a flow model based on large-eddy simulations in which turbines are modeled using an actuator disk approach. Furthermore, sensitivities of wind-farm <b>power</b> <b>extraction</b> to control parameters are evaluated in a tractable manner using an adjoint approach. In this way, individual wind turbines can be employed as dynamic flow actuators to both influence and harness specific flow features of the turbulent atmospheric boundary layer, with the aim of increasing the overall wind-farm <b>power</b> <b>extraction.</b> Although this approach is computationally infeasible for real-time wind-farm control, it allows to benchmark the potential of coordinated control. The current work contains cases studies involving both dynamic axial induction control and dynamic yaw control. It is found that, for all optimal control cases, wind-farm <b>power</b> <b>extraction</b> can be increased significantly.

In general, the effects of large-scale kinetic <b>power</b> <b>extraction</b> on estuary-scale fluid mechanics are not well understood. In this paper, these effects are quantified for an idealized estuary using a one-dimensional, time-dependent numerical model. The numerical domain consists of a long, wide inlet and basin connected by a constricted channel. Kinetic power densities within this constriction are suitable for in-stream energy conversion. Modelling shows that the <b>extraction</b> of kinetic <b>power</b> has a number of effects, including: (a) reduction of the volume of water exchanged through the estuary over the tidal cycle; (b) reduction of the tidal range landward of the array; and (c) reduction of the kinetic power density in the tidal channel. These impacts are strongly dependent on the magnitude of kinetic <b>power</b> <b>extraction,</b> estuary geometry, tidal regime, and non-linear turbine dynamics. It is shown that it may be misleading to relate these impacts to the fraction of kinetic energy extracted from the system.

By simulation the proposed scheme shows excellent performance, assuming sufficient beam position monitor resolution.
