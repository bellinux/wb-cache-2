When opposition to any Limousin papal relative developed, however, they switched their support to Pierre de Vergne. [...] Cardinal de Luna testified that {{a few days before the}} April Conclave began, Pierre de Verge had a majority of the electors on his side. But the riotous Roman crowds, led by their Bandarenses, changed the whole situation. At a new Conclave, held in safety in Fondi on 20 September 1378, the same cardinals (minus one, who had died, and with the addition of Cardinal Jean de la Grange, who had arrived in Rome in the meantime) elected Cardinal Robert of Geneva, who took the name Pope Clement VII. On 18 December 1378 Clement assigned Cardinal Guy as Apostolic Nuncio to travel to Flanders, Brabant, Scotland, England and the dioceses of Liège, Utrecht, Cambrai and Tournai, to secure adherence to his papacy; [...] Cardinal Guy departed on 31 December, and is known to have been in Paris at Easter. On 10 February 1380 the Cardinal received additional powers with respect to England, Scotland and elsewhere; and on 6 March 1381 these were extended to the diocese of Reims. He never received his safe-conduct for the realms of King Richard II, however, and thus did not travel to the British Isles. England, however, which was at war with France, had chosen not to support a French pope, and Flanders, which was allied with England, followed suit. Scotland, which hated the English and was a traditional ally of the French, supported the Avignon Obedience.|$|E

The measured parameters were the early, late and total support, the reverberation time, the early decay time and the clarity index. A part of the study has been devoted to the measurement uncertainty estimation. The source directivity and the small displacements of the microphone influence the early decay time to a great extent while the on-platform spatial variability affects both the early decay time and the clarity index. Per-section early support shows differences that render the overall spatial mean inappropriate to describe the stage as a whole. For the other parameters an overall mean platform value can instead be suitable, even though, for the case of clarity a more evident group variability is observed.

40|$|Exploratory data {{analysis}} (EDA) is a well-established statistical tradition that provides conceptual and computational tools for discovering patterns to foster hypothesis development and refinement. These tools and attitudes complement {{the use of}} significance and hypothesis tests used in confirmatory {{data analysis}} (CDA). Although EDA complements rather than replaces CDA, use of CDA without EDA is seldom warranted. Even when well-specified theories are held, EDA helps one interpret the results of CDA and may reveal unexpected or misleading patterns in the data. This article introduces the central heuristics and computational tools of EDA and contrasts it with CDA and exploratory statistics in general. EDA techniques are illustrated using previously published psychological data. Changes in statistical training and practice are recommended to incorporate these tools. The widespread availability of software for graphical data analysis and calls for increased use of exploratory data analysis (EDA) on epistemic grounds (e. g. Cohen, 1994) have increased the visibility of EDA. Nevertheless, few psychologists receive explicit training in the beliefs or procedures of this tradition. Huberty (1991) remarked that statistical texts are likely to give cursory references to common EDA techniques such as stem-and-leaf plots, box plots, or residual analysis and yet seldom integrate these techniques throughout a book.

We conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of memantine concerning the efficacy and tolerability of memantine in FTD. Methods: Studies were identified through searches of PubMed, databases of the Cochrane Library, and PsycINFO citations up to April 10, 2015. Outcomes were Clinical Global Impression (primary), Mini-Mental State Examination, Neuropsychiatric Inventory, and Zarit Burden Interview scores as well as all-cause discontinuation. Standardized mean difference and risk ratio with 95 % confidence interval were calculated. Results: Two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (total n= 130) met the inclusion criteria. Memantine was marginally superior to placebo as assessed by the Clinical Global Impression scores (standardized mean difference =- 0. 34, 95 % confidence interval =- 0. 68 – 0. 01, P= 0. 06). However, {{there were no significant}} differences in Mini-Mental State Examination, Neuropsychiatric Inventory, and Zarit Burden Interview scores as well as all-cause discontinuation between memantine and placebo.

Models of “mind reading ” have {{considered}} main effects, including social projection and stereotyping, {{but have not}} specified the conditions that govern when these tools will be used.

Three studies featuring manipulations of similarity support this claim. Moreover, reaction time results {{shed light on the}} mechanisms underlying these effects.

However, in Japan, additional estrogen formulations {{have been used}}, including transdermal patches and transdermal gels. The latter have a unique commonality with cosmetics because both of them are applied to the skin. Beauty care {{is one of the most}} important lifestyle factors for women, and it has been reported that the amount of attention paid to beauty care has an effect in determining whether or not women will choose to undergo HRT during menopause. Therefore, our study focused on estrogen formulations and beauty care practices. Patients and methods: Fifty women who use hormone replacement therapy were recruited from the outpatient clinic of Tohoku University Hospital. They were treated with oral conjugated estrogen (n = 11), transdermal 17 &szlig; -estradiol patch (n = 11), and transdermal 17 &szlig;-estradiol gel (n = 28). They completed a questionnaire to assess their lifestyle (beauty care practices and exercise habits) and their compliance. The transdermal gel users were further interviewed about their subjective impressions regarding &ldquo;smell&rdquo;, &ldquo;sticky feeling&rdquo;, &ldquo;spreadability&rdquo;, and &ldquo;irritation&rdquo; on the skin using a five-grade scale. Results: There were no differences in the usability of medicines and patient compliance among the estrogen formulations. We observed a positive tendency between the level of beauty care and transdermal gel use (P = 0. 0645, ordinary logistic regression analysis). The gel users placed top priority on a lack of &ldquo;sticky feeling&rdquo; but the subjective impression regarding &ldquo;sticky feeling&rdquo; was worst among the four factors (P &lt; 0. 01, Steel&ndash;Dwass test). Correspondence analysis showed that the subjective impressions of transdermal gel corresponding to usability in the range of &ldquo;moderate&rdquo; to &ldquo;very good&rdquo; and &ldquo;sticky feeling&rdquo; greatly affected the usability of the formulation.

40|$|Digital {{manufacturing}} {{constitutes a}} real industrial revolution that is transforming the production processes {{from the early}} stages of research and development to mass production and marketing. The biggest difference in comparison with old fabrication methods is the possibility to perform changes in the pattern design just by using mouse clicks instead of modifying an already fabricated prototype, which results in faster, cheaper and more efficient fabrication processes. For example, new technologies enabling the production of printed electronic devices on flexible substrates and compatible with roll-to-roll processing methods would result in cheaper fabrication costs than the traditional batch processing of silicon wafers. Such fabrication methods comprise a series of processing steps which are applied to the substrates while they are moving on rolls in the fabrication line. Therefore, it is desired that the new technologies can work at high speeds allowing {{at the same time the}} production of miniaturized features. Lasers are a versatile tool that can meet the demands of flexibility, speed, resolution and compatibility with roll-to-roll processing of digital manufacturing. The main advantages of laser radiation rely in its unique properties: high directionality, coherence and monochromaticity. The combination of such properties allows generating high intensities that can be focused into extremely small volumes, which makes lasers an ideal tool for the processing of materials at the micro- and nano-scale, not only as a subtractive but also as an additive technique. Laser ablation is the best known subtractive technique and it consists in the irradiation of a material with a focused laser beam. In the case of working with transparent materials, surface ablation constitutes a serious challenge since it is necessary to develop new strategies that allow controlling the position where the energy is delivered to ensure that ablation really occurs in the surface without modifying the bulk material. On the other hand, lasers can also be used as additive tools. For example, laser-induced forward transfer (LIFT) allows the transfer of materials in both solid and liquid state with high spatial resolution. In spite of the extensive amount of research on LIFT, some challenges still remain. For instance, the understanding of the particular printing dynamics encountered during the high speed printing of liquids, or the problem of printing uniform, continuous and stable lines with high spatial resolution. The objective of this thesis is to propose and implement feasible solutions to some of the challenges that are associated with both the subtractive and additive laser based techniques presented above. On one side, we study the laser ablation of transparent polymers using femtosecond laser pulses with the aim of achieving spatial resolutions that overcome the diffraction limit, and at the same time solving the problem of the required precise focusing of the laser beam on the materials surface. On the other side, we study the LIFT transfer dynamics during the high speed printing of liquids, and we propose alternative printing strategies to solve the inherent quality defects usually encountered during the formation of printed lines. Finally, two different approaches that are a combination of both subtractive and additive techniques are presented; we implement LIFT for the fabrication of liquid microlenses used for the surface nanopatterning of materials, and on the other side, we create fluidic guides by laser ablation for the printing of high quality continuous lines.

40|$|Among many {{literary}} terms {{found in}} the Lexicon Latinum (1742) by Andrija Jambrešić and Franjo Sušnik (auctor and scriptor — book writer; <b>impressio</b> — printing; libellus — booklet; typographeum — print house; typographia — {{to know how to}} set and print letters etc.) we can also find the term libellarium — bookcase, bookshelf, for keeping different letters and papers. This descriptive definition of libellarium sums up all the three areas this journal is dedicated to — the history of the writting, the history of books, and the history of memory institutions, which is the reason why this term was selected as the name of the journal. The main aims of Libellarium are motivating and promoting the research {{of the history of the}} written word, books and heritage institutions. The Croatian written and printed heritage offers infinite possibilities of research using the most current research methodology, which has not been applied in earlier research. The editorial board of Libellarium therefore invites research papers that will throw more light on the Croatian written and printed heritage, as well as papers that will promote research in line with the prevailing and the most current research paradigms. Such a blend of source and methodology is supposed to improve research methods, increase the interest in investigating the history of the written word, books and heritage institutions, and eventually result in their establishment as modern scientific disciplines in Croatian scholarship. This especially refers to the history of books, which has, in the past 50 years (starting with the pioneering book by Lucien Febvre and Henri-Jean Martin L’Apparition du livre published in 1958) evolved as a discrete scientific discipline with a developed research methodology that leans on the achievements of the history of literature, history in the narrow sense, cultural anthropology, sociology, librarianship, and many other sciences. There is only a handful of research papers from Croatia published in the past few years which follow, but also critically examine, the authors such as Robert Darnton, Roger Chartier, Paul Saenger, and other prominent scholars, as the modern research methodology has still not been sufficiently applied in humanities and social sciences research in Croatia. The editorial board of Libellarium wishes, on the one hand, to motivate modern research such as the interaction between the book and the reader, preparation of the manuscript or the printed text for the reader, appropriation methods, etc., and on the other, motivate the examination of the whole corpus of original sources for the history of (especially Croatian) books, as well as the interplay of social, cultural, intelectual, economic, legal and political circumstances that provided the conditions for the production, distribution and appropriation of texts, i. e. work that would establish firm foundations for future research. In line with this orientation, the first issue of Libellarium brings papers devoted to two issues. The papers by Aleksandar Stipčević, Željko Vegh and Slavko Harni present some of the possible sources for the history of books: private library inventories, records of canonical visitations and bibliographies. The papers by Jelena Lakuš, Maja Krtalić, Zorka Renić and Tatjana Kreštan examine the social circumstances of reading, librarianship and periodical publishing: preconditions for reading in Dalmatian reading societies in the early 19 th century, the possibilities of publishers’ advertisements in newspapers from Osijek in the late 19 th century, and the context of publishing local weekly journal (Tjednik bjelovarsko-križevački) in the late 19 th and early 20 th century. The paper by Andy White on the modern digital environment and the return of the age-old idea of a universal library may seem to be different from the two prevailing strands in other papers in this issue, but it also focuses on the examination of the general social and technological framework that accentuates this idea in certain historical periods. In addition to publishing research papers, Libellarium will also publish reprints of sources for the history of books. In this issue, following the paper by Slavko Harni, we bring the bibliography Književnost bosanska by Ivan Franjo Jukić. Finally, following the tradition of research journals, Libellarium will also publish reviews of important works on the history of the written word, books and heritage institutions...|$|E

Hrvatska pisana i tiskana baština nudi iznimne mogućnosti proučavanja u skladu sa suvremenom znanstvenom metodologijom, koja nije sustavno i dostatno primjenjivana u dosadašnjim istraživanjima. Uredništvo „Libellariuma” stoga potiče objavljivanje radova kroz koje će se šira znanstvena zajednica upoznavati s hrvatskom pisanom i tiskanom baštinom te radova koji će promicati istraživanja u skladu s dominantnim i najnovijim znanstvenim paradigmama. Pretpostavka je da će takav susret izvora i metodologije rezultirati unapređenjem istraživačkih metoda, porastom interesa za istraživanje povijesti pisane riječi, knjige i baštinskih ustanova i, u konačnici, njihovim etabliranjem kao modernih znanstvenih disciplina. Among many {{literary}} terms {{found in}} the Lexicon Latinum (1742) by Andrija Jambrešić and Franjo Sušnik (auctor and scriptor — book writer; <b>impressio</b> — printing; libellus — booklet; typographeum — print house; typographia — {{to know how to}} set and print letters etc.) we can also find the term libellarium — bookcase, bookshelf, for keeping different letters and papers. This descriptive definition of libellarium sums up all the three areas this journal is dedicated to — the history of the writting, the history of books, and the history of memory institutions, which is the reason why this term was selected as the name of the journal. The main aims of Libellarium are motivating and promoting the research {{of the history of the}} written word, books and heritage institutions. The Croatian written and printed heritage offers infinite possibilities of research using the most current research methodology, which has not been applied in earlier research. The editorial board of Libellarium therefore invites research papers that will throw more light on the Croatian written and printed heritage, as well as papers that will promote research in line with the prevailing and the most current research paradigms. Such a blend of source and methodology is supposed to improve research methods, increase the interest in investigating the history of the written word, books and heritage institutions, and eventually result in their establishment as modern scientific disciplines in Croatian scholarship. This especially refers to the history of books, which has, in the past 50 years (starting with the pioneering book by Lucien Febvre and Henri-Jean Martin L’Apparition du livre published in 1958) evolved as a discrete scientific discipline with a developed research methodology that leans on the achievements of the history of literature, history in the narrow sense, cultural anthropology, sociology, librarianship, and many other sciences. There is only a handful of research papers from Croatia published in the past few years which follow, but also critically examine, the authors such as Robert Darnton, Roger Chartier, Paul Saenger, and other prominent scholars, as the modern research methodology has still not been sufficiently applied in humanities and social sciences research in Croatia. The editorial board of Libellarium wishes, on the one hand, to motivate modern research such as the interaction between the book and the reader, preparation of the manuscript or the printed text for the reader, appropriation methods, etc., and on the other, motivate the examination of the whole corpus of original sources for the history of (especially Croatian) books, as well as the interplay of social, cultural, intelectual, economic, legal and political circumstances that provided the conditions for the production, distribution and appropriation of texts, i. e. work that would establish firm foundations for future research. In line with this orientation, the first issue of Libellarium brings papers devoted to two issues. The papers by Aleksandar Stipčević, Željko Vegh and Slavko Harni present some of the possible sources for the history of books: private library inventories, records of canonical visitations and bibliographies. The papers by Jelena Lakuš, Maja Krtalić, Zorka Renić and Tatjana Kreštan examine the social circumstances of reading, librarianship and periodical publishing: preconditions for reading in Dalmatian reading societies in the early 19 th century, the possibilities of publishers’ advertisements in newspapers from Osijek in the late 19 th century, and the context of publishing local weekly journal (Tjednik bjelovarsko-križevački) in the late 19 th and early 20 th century. The paper by Andy White on the modern digital environment and the return of the age-old idea of a universal library may seem to be different from the two prevailing strands in other papers in this issue, but it also focuses on the examination of the general social and technological framework that accentuates this idea in certain historical periods. In addition to publishing research papers, Libellarium will also publish reprints of sources for the history of books. In this issue, following the paper by Slavko Harni, we bring the bibliography Književnost bosanska by Ivan Franjo Jukić.
