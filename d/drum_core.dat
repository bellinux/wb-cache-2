40|$|Current-fed {{resonant}} converters {{have been}} widely used in large induction heating systems due to their low power losses and low EMI (Electromagnetic Interference). However, because of the bulky magnetic components and complicated control circuits employed, conventional current-fed inverters can hardly satisfy low power heating applications where the cost and size are of major concerns. This paper proposes a novel low cost push-pull current-fed inverter that is suitable for a portable car heater or other similar applications. The inverter integrates the dc inductor and the splitting transformer used in a conventional push-push inverter into one magnetic component using two <b>drum</b> <b>cores</b> wound with two identical windings. Furthermore, it does not require any additional controllers, thus the cost, weight, and physical size of the inverter are significantly reduced, making it ideal for portable car heater applications. The operation of the proposed inverter has been analysed in detail, and both simulation and practical experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed inverter works very well in generating the high frequency current required for an induction car heater or other low power heating devices...|$|R

40|$|Microwave {{assisted}} solid-state reaction between equimolar {{quantities of}} sterically encumbered 3, 5 -di-tert-butylsalicylic acid (H 2 -DTBSA) and n-butylstannoic acid {{results in the}} formation of hexameric drum shaped stannoxane [nBuSn(O) (H-DTBSA) ] 6 (1). Synthesis of 1 could not be achieved under normal thermal conditions or mechanical grinding. However, the azeotropic removal of water produced in the reaction of nBu 2 SnO with 3, 5 -di-tert-butyl salicylic acid in benzene yielded the tetrameric ladder shaped stannoxane [{nBu 2 Sn(H-DTBSA) } 2 O] 2 (2), which could also be synthesized in better yields by microwave irradiation {{as in the case of}} 1. Compounds 1 and 2 have been characterized by elemental analysis, IR, MALDI-MS and NMR (1 H and 13 C) spectroscopy. The structures of compound 1 and 2 are determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction techniques. Compound 1 is hexameric with a Sn 6 O 6 <b>drum</b> <b>core</b> while compound 2 forms a ladder structure with three Sn 2 O 2 rings, both decorated with –OH functionalities on the exterior of the polyhedral structure. While the formation of 1 from n-butylstannoic acid is straightforward, the formation of 2 from nBu 2 SnO (and not a cyclic structure similar to 3, where the phenolic oxygen also coordinates to tin) can be understood in terms of the increased steric hindrance in DTBSA for the phenolic protons to react with tin. © Elsevie...|$|E

40|$|The Advanced Mixed Treatment Project (AMWTP) privatized {{contract}} {{was awarded to}} BNFL Inc. in December 1996 and construction of the main facility commenced in August 2000. The purpose of the advanced mixed waste treatment facility is to safely treat plutonium contaminated waste, currently stored in drums and boxes, for final disposal at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP). The plant is being built at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory. Construction was completed in 28 months, to satisfy the Settlement Agreement milestone of December 2002. Commissioning of the related retrieval and characterization facilities is currently underway. The first shipment of pre-characterized waste is scheduled for March 2003, with AMWTP characterized and certified waste shipments from June 2003. To accommodate these challenging delivery targets BNFL adopted a systematic and focused construction program that included {{the use of a}} temporary structure to allow winter working, proven design and engineering principles and international procurement policies to help achieve quality and schedule. The technology involved in achieving the AMWTP functional requirements is primarily based upon a BNFL established pedigree of plant and equipment; applied in a manner that suits the process and waste. This technology includes the use of remotely controlled floor mounted and overhead power manipulators, a high power shredder and a 2000 -ton force supercompactor with the attendant glove box suite, interconnections and automated material handling. The characterization equipment includes real-time radiography (RTR) units, drum and box assay measurement systems, drum head space gas sampling / analysis and <b>drum</b> venting, <b>drum</b> <b>coring</b> and sampling capabilities. The project adopted a particularly stringent and intensive pre-installation testing philosophy to ensure that equipment would work safely and reliably at the required throughput. This testing included the complete off site integration of functional components or glove boxes, with the attendant integrated control system and undertaking continuous, non-stop, operational effectiveness proof tests. This paper describes the process, plant and technology used within the AMWTP and provides an outline of the associated design, procurement, fabrication, testing and construction...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study, the 3 -D {{features}} of the thermal-hydraulic system code CATHARE 2 were thoroughly assessed against the OECD/PKL- 2 ROCOM tests T 1. 1, T 2. 1 and T 2. 2 which focus on {{the evaluation of the}} thermal mixing in the reactor pressure vessel (RPV) under asymmetric buoyant cooling loop conditions. Furthermore, the calculation of the recent ROCOM test T 2. 3 (OECD/PKL- 3), which aims at detailed investigation of the thermal-hydraulic behavior inside the RPV during the emergency core cooling injection from accumulator to the cold leg, was performed in the framework of OECD/NEA/CSNI international benchmark activity. A successful application of CFD code to support a set-up of best estimate 3 -D SYS-TH nodalization of RPV was demonstrated. This was achieved by using ANSYS CFX code to evaluate the pressure losses throughout the vessel with further application of additional loss coefficients for the sieve <b>drum</b> and <b>core</b> support plate in CATHARE reference model in order to match the pressure drops predicted by the CFD model. The effect of nodalization refinement (axial, radial and azimuthal) of the ROCOM pressure vessel as well as the influence of the singular pressure losses in the sieve <b>drum</b> and <b>core</b> support plate on the predicted results was studied. It was observed that the number of azimuthal nodes is the most influential parameter on the mixing scalar. It also important to notice that the calculations conducted with refined grids show better general agreement with the experimental data. This {{is due to the fact}} that an increase of the node numbers causes a decrease of the numerical diffusion, which plays a vital role in the simulations. The performed qualitative analysis has shown the ability of CATHARE 3 -D models to capture the main {{features of the}} mixing phenomena in reactor pressure vessel using appropriate modelling, however from the quantitative point of view, the effectiveness of the thermal mixing is generally overpredicted. The obtained results are qualitatively comparable to the ones obtained with CFD codes, like ANSYS CFX, CODE_SATURNE, STAR-CCM+, however require considerably less computational resources. It also important to notice that applicability of the findings of the present studies to NPP scale has to be further investigated both experimentally and analytically, due to scaling distortions which are inevitably present in any scaled test facility...|$|R
50|$|The {{early history}} of cache {{technology}} is {{closely tied to the}} invention and use of virtual memory. Because of scarcity and cost of semi-conductor memories, early mainframe computers in the 1960s used a complex hierarchy of physical memory, mapped onto a flat virtual memory space used by programs. The memory technologies would span semi-conductor, magnetic <b>core,</b> <b>drum</b> and disc. Virtual memory seen and used by programs would be flat and caching would be used to fetch data and instructions into the fastest memory ahead of processor access. Extensive studies were done to optimize the cache sizes. Optimal values were found to depend greatly on the programming language used with Algol needing the smallest and Fortran and Cobol needing the largest cache sizes.|$|R

5000|$|The use {{of talking}} drums {{as a form}} of {{communication}} was noticed by Europeans {{in the first half of}} the eighteenth century. Detailed messages could be sent from one village to the next faster than could be carried by a person riding a horse. In the nineteenth century Roger T. Clarke, a missionary, realised that [...] "the signals represent the tones of the syllables of conventional phrases of a traditional and highly poetic character." [...] Like Chinese, many African languages are tonal; that is, the pitch is important in determining the meaning of a particular word. The Yoruba language of the Yoruba people for instance is mostly defined by the tri-tonic scale, consisting only of the tonic sol-fa notes, do, re, mi, different inflections of which are then used to convey different messages, this same principle also applies to how the drum talks in all of the Yoruba peoples music and culture. The problem was how to communicate complex messages without the use of vowels or consonants, simply using tone. An English emigrant to Africa, John F. Carrington, in his 1949 book The Talking Drums of Africa explained how African drummers were able to communicate complex messages over vast distances. Using low tones referred to as male and higher female tones, the drummer communicates through the phrases and pauses, which can travel upwards of 4-5 miles. This process may take eight times longer than communicating a normal sentence but was effective for telling neighboring villages of possible attacks or ceremonies. He found that to each short word which was beaten on the drums was added an extra phrase, which would be redundant in speech but provided context to the <b>core</b> <b>drum</b> signal.|$|R
