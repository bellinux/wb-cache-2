5|$|During the reception, Grace learns {{many things}} {{she did not}} know about Leo, {{including}} that his first name is Marvin (revealed by his mother, Eleanor (Judith Ivey)). So many unsettling details about Leo come to light that Grace becomes uneasy and leaves the reception; Leo follows her. The two run into Katie in the lobby who tells them that The Today Show has scrapped the wedding segment because the judge who performed the ceremony was not licensed in New York so their marriage is not valid. Upon learning this, Grace tells Leo that she needs time to think about their relationship. Leo returns to the reception and announces to everyone that his marriage to Grace is not legitimate. Grace returns to the reception later, and reveals that she <b>does</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> marry Leo.|$|E
25|$|In true Robin and Patrick fashion, they cannot get on {{the same}} page - just when Robin realizes she <b>does</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> marry him, Patrick has finally {{accepted}} the fact that she does not. Mac arrests Patrick and locks the two of them in the PCPD interrogation Room, forcing them to talk. Patrick proposes again and Robin finally says yes. They decide to marry before their daughter is born, and their wedding is set for October 29, 2008. Patrick, thinking he has {{all the time in the}} world, decides to go into the hospital to do last minute rounds. He cuts it close, but signs out on time. However, just as he is about to leave, Anthony Zacchara (Bruce Weitz) is brought in with a stroke and needs emergency surgery. Matt (Jason Cook), Patrick's newly found half brother who's also a neurosurgeon, offers to perform it, but Patrick is afraid that should something go wrong the Zaccharas would go after his brother. Meanwhile, back at the church, everyone waits for Patrick's arrival impatiently and believing that he has a case of cold feet and has left his fiancee at the altar. Robin is the only one who had no fears and no doubts and is certain beyond a shadow of a doubt that Patrick will be there. Patrick comes running in after a successful surgery and apologizes for his lateness, but Robin is cool-headed; she knew he would be there. Mac walks her down the aisle, as her father Robert is still getting treatment for his cancer overseas.|$|E
500|$|... "Better than Today" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by married couple Nerina Pallot and Andy Chatterley. The song was originally included on Pallot's project Buckminster Fuller EP in February 2009. After hearing Pallot's work, Minogue's A contacted her manager. Pallot stated when Minogue called her later, she [...] "really didn't {{believe it was}} her", continuing, [...] "when [...] came to the studio in a nasty part of London I thought: 'OK, she really <b>does</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do this'". Pallot and Chatterley were the first two writers and producers to work with Minogue when recording sessions for Aphrodite began in April 2009. [...] "Better than Today" [...] {{was one of the}} prominent results of the collaboration. Pallot commented on working with Minogue, calling her [...] "accommodating and lovely and approachable and normal [...] ".|$|E

He breaks up with Rachel, who angrily sings [...] "Gives You Hell" [...] in retaliation, {{and goes on}} a date with both Brittany and Santana, but comes to the {{realization}} that he <b>does</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be with Rachel. In the interim, Rachel meets Jesse St. James (Jonathan Groff), the lead singer of New Directions' rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline, at a local music library. The two perform an impromptu duet of Lionel Richie's [...] "Hello", and Rachel becomes enamoured with him. Eventually, the New Directions members learn about the blossoming relationship and conclude that Jesse is using Rachel, and threaten to expel her from the club unless she breaks up with him. Rachel asks Jesse to keep their relationship a secret and turns Finn down when he asks her to get back together with him.|$|E
500|$|Butters and Fazekas {{stated that}} Underwood [...] "doesn’t quite {{understand}} what it’s {{like to be}} a normal woman" [...] after her upbringing in the program, and is intrigued by Carter. Regan elaborated that [...] "she’s never seen anyone like [...] before and she’s never been beaten before. There’s this competitive but playful obsession with her" [...] which is seen with Underwood's [...] "flirtation" [...] and [...] "feminine prowess". Regan continued, [...] "She knows that to be on top she has to beat Peggy ... So Dottie <b>does</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> get under her skin. She tries to make her feel uncomfortable and that might be with a look or a glance or what she says." [...] Atwell said, [...] "Peggy has male baddies that she fights, but to have someone who is physically her equal—she's a Black Widow, incredibly capable and very smart—I think that shows some balance for Peggy, like a flip side of the same coin." [...] After Carter defeats Underwood and Leviathan in the first season, Underwood becomes [...] "a lone wolf ... she’s a woman without a country right now, but she is more involved in the [...] case" [...] for the second season than it initially appears.|$|E
2500|$|Reading Lolita in Tehran is {{a memoir}} about {{teaching}} government-banned Western literary classics {{to women in}} the world of an Islamic Iran, which author Azar Nafisi describes as dominated in the 1980s by fundamentalist [...] "morality squads". Stories about the lives of her book club members are interspersed with critical commentary on Lolita and three other Western novels. Lolita in particular is dubbed the ultimate [...] "forbidden" [...] novel and becomes a metaphor for life in Iran. Although Nafasi states that the metaphor is not allegorical (p.35), she <b>does</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> draw parallels between [...] "victim and jailer" [...] (p.37). She implies that, like the principal character in Lolita, the regime in Iran imposes their [...] "dream upon our reality, turning us into his figments of imagination." [...] In both cases, the protagonist commits the [...] "crime of solipsizing another person's life." [...] February 2011 saw the premiere of a concert performance of an opera based on Reading Lolita in Tehran at the University of Maryland School of Music with music by doctoral student Elisabeth Mehl Greene and a libretto co-written by Iranian-American poet Mitra Motlagh. Azar Nafasi was closely involved {{in the development of the}} project and participated in an audience Q session after the premiere.|$|E

2500|$|Sometimes {{the reverse}} {{situation}} to a novus actus occurs, i.e. factual causation cannot be proved {{but the court}} nevertheless <b>does</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> hold the defendant liable. [...] In Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories, [...] the plaintiff's mother consumed diethylstilbestrol as a miscarriage preventative. The medicine, later re-called from the market, caused the defendant to develop a malignant bladder tumor due to its negligent manufacture. However, there were many manufacturers of that drug in the market. [...] The manufacturer of the particular medication that caused the injury could not be ascertained for certain. [...] The {{court held that the}} defendant was liable in proportion to its market share. [...] They departed from traditional notions of pure cause and adopted a ‘risk based’ approach to liability. [...] The defendant was held liable because of the amount of risk it contributed to the occasioning of the harm. [...] Note that a risk theory is not strictly a theory built on notions of cause at all, as, by definition, the person who caused the injury could not be ascertained for certain. [...] However, it does show that legal notions of causation are a complex mixture of factual causes and ideas of public policy relating to the availability of legal remedies. In R v Miller , the House of Lords said that a person who puts a person in a dangerous position, in that case a fire, will be criminally liable if he does not adequately rectify the situation.|$|E
2500|$|The group reunites in {{the main}} hall. [...] Emery {{attempts}} to attack Annie with a fireplace poker. Using psychokinesis, Annie animates a suit of armor and attempts to kill Emery with a halberd. Neither attack succeeds, and Joyce calms both individuals. [...] In an attempt to uncover the secret of Rose Red, Steve creates a telepathic link between Cathy and Annie, and Cathy begins to engage in automatic writing. Annie begins to draw pictures of boulders striking the house, smashed doors, and broken glass, and soon doors and windows {{all over the house}} are opening and closing violently and glass in the windows shatters. Rocks begin to fall, destroying Mrs. Waterman's car and causing severe damage to Rose Red. Cathy automatically writes [...] "help us" [...] and [...] "open the doors," [...] prompting Annie to unseal the house. [...] Steve, Emery, Cathy, Rachel, and Annie make their escape from Rose Red, but Joyce, now clearly insane, refuses to leave. The group is attacked by the spectre of Ellen Rimbauer, but Annie prevents Ellen from coming after them. Mrs. Waterman's ghost leaps from a mirror and attempts to draw Emery into the spirit realm, but Emery, with the assistance of Steve and Cathy, resists his mother {{for the first time in}} his life, and Mrs. Waterman vanishes again. [...] The survivors flee to their cars as boulders rain down on Rose Red. Back in the house, Joyce suddenly realizes too late that she <b>does</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> leave, but is surrounded by the ghosts of Rose Red: Nick, Pam, Vic, Mrs. Waterman, Miller, Bollinger, Sukeena, and Deanna Petrie. She screams in terror as the film fades to black.|$|E

60|$|Political liberty, let us repeat, {{consists}} {{in the power}} of criticising those flexible parts of the State which constantly require reconsideration, not the basis, but the machinery. In plainer words, it means the power of saying the sort of things that a decent but discontented citizen wants to say. He does not want to spit on the Bible, or to run about without clothes, or to read the worst page in Zola from the pulpit of St. Paul's. Therefore the forbidding of these things (whether just or not) is only tyranny in a secondary and special sense. It restrains the abnormal, not the normal man. But the normal man, the decent discontented citizen, <b>does</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> protest against unfair law courts. He <b>does</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> expose brutalities of the police. He <b>does</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> make game of a vulgar pawnbroker who is made a Peer. He does want publicly to warn people against unscrupulous capitalists and suspicious finance. If he is run in for doing this (as he will be) he <b>does</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> proclaim the character or known prejudices of the magistrate who tries him. If he is sent to prison (as he will be) he <b>does</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> have a clear and civilised sentence, telling him when he will come out. And these are literally and exactly the things that he now cannot get. That is the almost cloying humour of the present situation. I can say abnormal things in modern magazines. It is the normal things that I am not allowed to say. I can write in some solemn quarterly an elaborate article explaining that God is the devil; I can write in some cultured weekly an aesthetic fancy describing how I should like to eat boiled baby. The thing I must not write is rational criticism of the men and institutions of my country.|$|E
