5|$|As {{a result}} of Rubí's recommendations, Presidio de San Agustín de Ahumada was closed in 1771, leaving the Texas coast unoccupied except for La Bahía. In July 1772, however, the {{governor}} of Texas <b>heard</b> <b>rumors</b> that English traders were building a settlement {{in the area of}} the Texas coast that had been abandoned. The commander of La Bahía was sent to find the settlement, but saw no sign of other Europeans. His expedition did, however, discover that the San Jacinto River emptied into Galveston Bay and not into the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The British {{sent the}} Mahdi's family to al-Shakaba on the Blue Nile in September 1898. The group {{included}} the Khalifa Muhammad Sharif, the Mahdi's cousin {{and one of}} his chosen successors. In 1899 the government <b>heard</b> <b>rumors</b> that the family group was advocating a Mahdist revival and dispatched a military force to al-Shakaba. One account says the force attacked the family and followers, firing on them at random. Abd al-Rahman was badly wounded and his two elder brothers were killed. Another account says Muhammad Sharif and the two elder sons of the Mahdi were arrested. There was a skirmish when an attempt was made to rescue them. Muhammad Sharif and the Mahdi's two sons were found guilty by a court martial trial and were shot.|$|E
5|$|According to Brackman, {{several days}} after the robbery the Okhrana agent Mukhtarov {{questioned}} Stalin in a secret apartment. The agents had <b>heard</b> <b>rumors</b> that Stalin had been seen watching passively during the robbery. Mukhtarov asked Stalin why he had not informed them about it, and Stalin stated that he had provided adequate information to the authorities to prevent the theft. The questioning escalated into a heated argument; Mukhtarov hit Stalin {{in the face and}} had to be restrained by other Okhrana officers. After this incident, Mukhtarov was suspended from the Okhrana, and Stalin was ordered to leave Tiflis and go to Baku to await a decision in the case. Stalin left Baku with 20,000rubles in stolen money in July 1907. While Brackman claims to have found evidence of this incident, whether Stalin cooperated with the Okhrana during his early life has been a subject of debate among historians for many decades and has yet to be resolved.|$|E
5000|$|The Xingu area is of {{interest}} {{because it was a}} destination for early-20th century exploration by Europeans, among whom British Captain Percy Harrison Fawcett was the most notable. He sought a city which Europeans had <b>heard</b> <b>rumor</b> of since their early 16th-century colonial contact, and he disappeared in the jungle in 1925.|$|R

5|$|In 1939, the Nazis invaded Poland {{and forced}} that nation's second-largest {{community}} of Jews, 270,000 strong, into {{one section of}} the city of Łódź, which they later walled off to form a ghetto. Before the invasion, Syvia and her family lived in Łódź. When her father <b>heard</b> <b>rumors</b> of the impending German invasion, the family traveled by buggy to Warsaw. The family was unable to find work or housing in Warsaw, so they returned to Lodz. When the Germans did invade, they forced Syvia's family to relocate, along with other Łódź-area Jews, into a segregated section of the city: a ghetto. The book relates Syvia's explanations of what life in the ghetto is like: her friends, people around the ghetto, jobs, and her schedule. It relates how Syvia's family is forced to sell her doll, leaving her with rags and buttons as her playthings.|$|E
5|$|As {{is often}} the case with huge ancient ruins, {{knowledge}} of the site was never completely lost in the region. It seems that local people never forgot about Tikal and they guided Guatemalan expeditions to the ruins in the 1850s. Some second- or third-hand accounts of Tikal appeared in print starting in the 17th century, continuing through the writings of John Lloyd Stephens in the early 19th century (Stephens and his illustrator Frederick Catherwood <b>heard</b> <b>rumors</b> of a lost city, with white building tops towering above the jungle, during their 1839-40 travels in the region). Because of the site's remoteness from modern towns, however, no explorers visited Tikal until Modesto Méndez and Ambrosio Tut, respectively the commissioner and the governor of Petén, visited it in 1848. Artist Eusebio Lara accompanied them and their account was published in Germany in 1853. Several other expeditions came to further investigate, map, and photograph Tikal in the 19th century (including Alfred P. Maudslay in 1881-82) and the early 20th century. Pioneering archaeologists started to clear, map and record the ruins in the 1880s.|$|E
5|$|In the 1976–77 {{season the}} Flyers' win total slipped from 51 to 48, {{but they still}} managed a 0.700 winning percentage. This marked the fourth {{consecutive}} year of having a 0.700 or better win percentage – once again winning their division and finishing first in the Campbell Conference. In the post season the Flyers again reached the semi-finals, but lost to the Bruins in four straight games. The following season the Flyers' record fell to 45–20–15 finishing second to the Islanders in both the division and the Conference. Shero again led the Flyers to the semi-finals, where they lost to the Bruins once more. At {{the end of the}} season Shero, who had one more year left on his contract, submitted a letter of resignation stating that the Flyers needed a change whether they realized it or not. Flyers management had previously <b>heard</b> <b>rumors</b> about Shero wanting to leave Philadelphia and re-join the Rangers organization, and refused to accept his letter of resignation. Shero then signed a $250,000, five-year contract with the Rangers to be their new Head Coach and General Manager, believing he no longer had a contractual agreement to the Flyers. A few weeks after signing Shero, the Rangers gave the Flyers their first-round pick in the 1978 draft (Ken Linseman) and cash as compensation, allowing the Rangers to avoid tampering charges.|$|E

25|$|Both Koniecpolski and Gustav II Adolf desired a major battle. Koniecpolski {{needed to}} reduce the Swedes' strength, as their current {{numerical}} superiority {{made it difficult for}} his army to contain them; Gustav II Adolf meanwhile <b>heard</b> <b>rumors</b> of possible reinforcements for Koniecpolski arriving, and wanted to defeat him before his numerical superiority withered.|$|E

25|$|By this time, Luis Muñoz Rivera and his Autonomist Party {{had signed}} a pact with Práxedes Mateo Sagasta, {{the leader of the}} Spanish Liberal Party.

25|$|Like other {{officers}} in the Lao high command, Sourith <b>heard</b> <b>rumors</b> that Thao Ma was going to return to Laos to overthrow the government. When Thao Ma actually returned to Laos on 20 August 1973, Sourith hid in his home, prepared if need be to change his allegiance to support the coup. He was found huddled under a table, and refused to emerge {{to deal with the}} coup because of the danger involved. After the coup was suppressed without his help via Thao Ma's execution, Sourith was relieved of command of the RLAF and transferred to the post of chief of logistics for the Royal Lao Armed Forces.|$|E
25|$|The {{first time}} the U.S. Coast Guard found one {{containing}} drugs, authorities dubbed it Bigfoot because they had <b>heard</b> <b>rumors</b> that such things existed, but none had actually been seen. In late 2006 a Bigfoot was seized 145km southwest of Costa Rica carrying several metric tonnes of cocaine. In 2006, US officials say they detected three; in 2008, they were spotting an average of ten per month, but {{only one out of}} ten was intercepted. Few were seized, as their crews scuttle them upon interception and they sink within a minute or so. By 2009, the U.S.A. detected as many as 60 narco submarine related events, and it was calculated that they were moving as much as 330 metric tonnes of cocaine per year.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} infamous crimes in the city took place in March 1953, when elderly widow Mabel Monahan was killed in her Burbank home. When Monahan, 64, {{opened the door to}} her house on West Parkside Avenue, she found herself confronted by a stranger, Barbara Graham (also {{sometimes}} referred to as Barbara Wood). Graham, along with some other accomplices, had <b>heard</b> <b>rumors</b> of a Las Vegas gambling fortune hidden in Monahan's house. The crime scene was discovered by a gardener, who went to Monahan's front door and looked in to find a ransacked home and a grisly trail of blood. The gardener immediately called the Burbank Police, who discovered Monahan's badly beaten body, half in and half out of a closet.|$|E
25|$|On January 24, 2006, {{reports from}} NBA sources {{confirmed}} that the Sacramento Kings had agreed to trade Peja Stojaković to the Pacers for Artest. However, before the trade could be completed, many press outlets reported that Artest had informed team management {{that he did not}} want to go to Sacramento. According to Artest's agent, his original trade request was only made because he was upset when he <b>heard</b> <b>rumors</b> that the Pacers were going to trade him to Sacramento for Stojaković early in the season. While not denying his agent's story, Artest did deny that he had rejected the trade to Sacramento, saying that he would play anywhere; hence, contradicting earlier press accounts stating Artest was holding up the trade. Given conflicting accounts, it is unclear why the trade was delayed, but it was nevertheless completed on January 25 and Artest was officially sent to the Kings for Stojaković.|$|E
25|$|Wilder {{moved with}} her family from Wisconsin in the year 1869, when she was two years old. They stopped in Rothville, Missouri, and settled in Kansas, in Indian country near what is now Independence. Her younger sister Carrie (1870–1946) was born there in August 1870, not long before they moved again. According to Wilder in later years, {{her father had been}} told that the {{location}} would soon be open to white settlers but that was incorrect; their homestead was actually on the Osage Indian reservation and they had no legal right to occupy it. They had just begun to farm when they <b>heard</b> <b>rumors</b> that the settlers would be evicted, and they departed in spring of 1871. Although Laura portrayed the leave and that of other settlers as prompted by rumors of eviction in both her novel and in her Pioneer Girl memoirs, in the memoirs she also noted that her parents needed to recover their Wisconsin land because the buyer had not paid the entire mortgage. Several Kansas neighbors apparently were allowed to buy the land they had settled on so the rumors may have been untrue.|$|E
