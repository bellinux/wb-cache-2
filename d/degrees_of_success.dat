40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an approach to}} identify factors that significantly influence microgravity experiment performance. Investigators developed the 'degrees of success' scale to provide a numerical representation <b>of</b> <b>success.</b> A <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>success</b> was assigned to 293 microgravity experiments. Experiment information including the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>success</b> rankings and factors for analysis was compiled into a database. Through an analysis of variance, nine significant factors in microgravity experiment performance were identified. The frequencies of these factors are presented along with the average <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>success</b> at each level. A preliminary discussion {{of the relationship between}} the significant factors and the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>success</b> is presented...|$|R

5|$|A Peronist, Kirchner handled {{political}} power as Peronist leaders have traditionally done. He nevertheless sought to portray himself as being different from previous Peronist leaders. He made {{frequent use of}} controversies with other political or social forces and the polarization of public opinion, which became characteristic of his political style. This strategy was used against the financial sector, the military and police, foreign countries, international bodies, newspapers, and Duhalde himself with varying <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>success.</b> Kirchner sought to generate an image contrasting with those of former presidents Carlos Menem and Fernando de la Rúa. Menem was seen as frivolous and De la Rúa as doubtful, so Kirchner tried {{to be seen as}} serious and determined.|$|E

Some games {{attempted to}} incorporate elements of first person shooter or survival horror games {{through the use of}} less restricted character movement and exploration, with varying <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>success.</b> Others, however, unashamedly paid homage to 1990s arcade gameplay, even embracing a somewhat parodic style. Light guns are not compatible with modern high-definition televisions, leading developers to experiment with hybrid controllers, particularly with the Wii Remote for the Wii, as well as the PlayStation 3's GunCon 3 peripheral used with Time Crisis 4. Others have used the PlayStation Move motion control system.|$|E

For Australia and New Zealand, coalition warfare became the norm, and the experience in SWPA {{proved to be a}} formative and informative one, with many political and military lessons.

Throughout the 1840s until the 1860s, the Ottomans launched their own modernization reforms, known as the Tanzimat, throughout the empire with varying <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>success.</b> Coinciding with these efforts, the international powers began a tug-of-war of influence in Palestine as they sought to extend their protection over the country's religious minorities, a struggle carried out mainly through their consular representatives in Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|The UN Charter {{was drafted}} {{at a conference}} between April–June 1945 in San Francisco, and was signed on 26 June 1945 at the {{conclusion}} of the conference; this charter took effect 24 October 1945, and the UN began operation. The UN's mission to preserve world peace was complicated in its early decades by the Cold War between the US and Soviet Union and their respective allies. The organization participated in major actions in Korea and the Congo, as well as approving the creation of the state of Israel in 1947. The organization's membership grew significantly following widespread decolonization in the 1960s, and by the 1970s its budget for economic and social development programmes far outstripped its spending on peacekeeping. After the end of the Cold War, the UN took on major military and peacekeeping missions across the world with varying <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>success.</b>|$|E

5|$|There was {{no clear}} {{solution}} to combating Britain from the air. Göring {{had not given}} up hope of winning a victory by airborne assault. He discussed the possibility of invading Ireland (Fall Grün, or Operation Green) with Kurt Student in January 1941, in order to surround Britain by land, sea and air. The operation was shelved. Instead, the Luftwaffe, with varying <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>success,</b> carried out the strategic bombardment of British industrial cities. The lack of RAF night defences in {{this stage of the}} war enabled the German bombers to inflict extensive damage without suffering the heavy losses of the daylight campaign. It is estimated that the Luftwaffe lost around 500 aircrews during the Blitz in comparison to the Battle of Britain in which it lost around 2,800 killed, 340 wounded, 750 captured. Overall losses were cut by one-third of daylight operations.|$|E
