Having <b>fixed</b> <b>his</b> shield to {{the gate of the}} imperial capital, Oleg won a favourable trade treaty, which eventually was of great benefit to both nations. Although Byzantine sources did not record these hostilities, the text of the treaty survives in the Chronicle.|$|E
5|$|Bruce paid two further {{visits to}} Spitsbergen, in 1912 and 1914, but the {{outbreak}} of war prevented further immediate developments. However, early in 1919 the old syndicate {{was replaced by a}} larger and better-financed company. Bruce had now <b>fixed</b> <b>his</b> main hopes on the discovery of oil, but scientific expeditions in 1919 and 1920 failed to provide evidence of its presence, although substantial new deposits of coal and iron ore were discovered. Thereafter Bruce was too ill to continue with his involvement. The new company had expended most of its capital on these prospecting ventures, and although it continued to exist, under various ownerships, until 1952, there is no record of profitable extraction. Its assets and claims were finally acquired by a rival concern.|$|E
25|$|For his {{services}} he received many grants {{of land in}} Gloucestershire and Berkshire, some of which he exchanged for manors in Oxfordshire and Northamptonshire; other grants of land in Cornwall, Essex and London soon followed.

When in London {{he lived in the}} parish of Great St. Bartholomew's.|$|E

He subsequently <b>fixed</b> <b>his</b> retirement for October 2003, giving him time to ensure an orderly and uncontroversial transition to his anointed successor, Abdullah Badawi. Having spent over 22 years in office, Mahathir was the world's longest-serving elected leader when he retired. He remains Malaysia's longest-serving prime minister.|$|E
25|$|This {{time the}} invaders came to stay, and they built for {{themselves}} a capital, called Sarai, {{on the lower}} Volga. Here {{the commander of the}} Golden Horde, as the western section of the Mongol empire was called, <b>fixed</b> <b>his</b> golden headquarters and represented his sovereign the grand khan who lived with the Great Horde in the Orkhon Valley. Here they had their headquarters and held parts of Rus' in subjection for nearly three centuries. All of the Russian states, including Novgorod, Smolensk, Galich and Pskov, submitted to the Tatar-Mongol rule.|$|E
25|$|On May 18 Essex marched {{south to}} Kilkenny with two-thirds of his force. The {{streets of the}} city were strewn in welcome with green herbs and rushes, and Essex endured some lively orations from the local dignitaries. After meeting with Thomas Norris he {{departed}} on May 22 with 2,500 foot and 300 horse and was received with jubilation in the town of Clonmel. Two miles below the town, on the river Suir, the castle of Derrylare was surrendered, and Essex then <b>fixed</b> <b>his</b> sights on Cahir Castle, the strongest fortress in Ireland.|$|E

According to the rules, he should have <b>fixed</b> <b>his</b> bicycle without help, but instead he changed to a {{different}} bicycle. He had gotten permission from a race judge to do this, but later the judges reevaluated the rules, {{and gave him a}} one-hour penalty. This dropped him to the fourth place of the general classification, and allowed Lambot to take over the lead. Lambot stayed in the yellow jersey easily until Paris, so he won the 1922 Tour de France.|$|E
25|$|Möngke {{concentrated}} all {{his attention}} on the conquest of the Song dynasty. Taking personal command late in the decade, he captured many of the fortified cities along the northern front. In October 1257 Möngke set out for South China, leaving his administration to his brother, Ariq Böke, in Karakorum with Alamdar as assistant, and <b>fixed</b> <b>his</b> camps near the Liu-pan mountains in May of the following year. He first attacked Song positions in Sichuan and took Paoning in 1258. Möngke forbade his army to plunder civilians. When his son accidentally destroyed a crop {{in the field of}} the Chinese peasants, Möngke punished him.|$|E
25|$|There {{were many}} herds and flocks. The flocks were {{committed}} to a shepherd, who gave receipt for them and took them out to pasture. The Code <b>fixed</b> <b>his</b> wage. He was responsible for all care, must restore ox for ox, sheep for sheep and must breed them satisfactorily. Any dishonest use of the flock had to be repaid tenfold, but loss due to disease or wild beasts fell upon the owner. The shepherd made good all loss due to his own neglect. If he let the flock feed on a field of crops, he had to pay damages fourfold; if he turned them into standing crops when {{they ought to have}} been folded, he paid twelvefold.|$|E

25|$|It was now Maravarman Sundara Pandya's turn {{to repeat}} the act of Kulothunga Chola III, in {{performing}} a virabhishekam in the coronation hall of the Cholas at Ayirattali in Thanjavur district. The Pandya monarch did not stop at this, he marched up to Chidambaram where he worshipped at the famous shrine of Nataraja. On his way back, Maravarman Sundara Pandyan <b>fixed</b> <b>his</b> camp at Pon Amaravati in Pudukottai. At this time, Kulothunga Chola III appealed for aid to Hoysala Veera Ballala II, with whom the Chola monarch had marital alliance. Veera Ballala II responded quickly, and 'sent an army under his son Vira Narasimha II to Srirangam. Maravarman Sundara Pandya, therefore, had {{to make peace with}} the Cholas and restore the Chola kingdom to Kulothunga Chola III and Rajaraja Chola III, after they made formal submission at Pon Amaravati and acknowledged him as suzerain. This {{was the beginning of the}} second empire of the Pandyas though it was not yet quite the end of that of the Cholas. The wheel of fortune had thus, turned a full circle during the last part of Kulothunga III's reign itself, and from being the powerful suzerains of the once-dominated Pandyas, it was the turn of Cholas to remain dominated and subservient to their arch-enemy, during the best part of their remaining existence between 1217 CE to 1280 CE. The period 12171280 CE was a period was a period of continuous decline of the Cholas which is also characterized by the steady and constant growth of the renewed power of the Pandyas. Kulothunga Chola III and his son Rajaraja Chola III became tribute-paying subordinates of Maravarman Sundara Pandya. The aging Kulothunga Chola III did not live long after sustaining defeat against the Pandyas and died in 1218 CE. He was succeeded by his son and heir-apparent Rajaraja Chola III (12181256 CE).|$|E

500|$|Colt {{knew he had}} to {{make his}} revolvers affordable, as the death of many great inventions was a high retail price. Colt <b>fixed</b> <b>his</b> prices at a level below his {{competition}} to maximize sales volume. From his experience in haggling with government officials, he knew what numbers he would have to generate to make enough profit to invest money in improving his machinery, thereby limiting imitators' ability to produce a comparable weapon at a lower price. Although successful at this, for the most part, his preoccupation with marketing strategies and patent protection caused him to miss a great opportunity in firearms development when he dismissed an idea from one of his gunsmiths, Rollin White. White had an idea of a [...] "bored-through" [...] revolver cylinder to allow the use of metallic cartridges in a handgun. After Colt fired White for suggesting an improvement to his revolver, White took his idea to Colt's competitor, Smith & Wesson, who patented his invention and kept Colt from being able to build cartridge firearms for almost 20 years.|$|E

500|$|With Robey's {{popularity}} came an {{eagerness to}} differentiate {{himself from his}} music hall rivals, and so he devised a signature costume when appearing as himself: an oversized black coat fastened {{from the neck down}} with large, wooden buttons; black, unkempt, baggy trousers and a partially bald wig with black, whispery strands of unbrushed, dirty-looking hair that poked below a large, dishevelled top-hat. He applied thick white face paint and exaggerated the redness on his cheeks and nose with bright red make-up; his eye line and eyebrows were also enhanced with thick, black greasepaint. He held a short, misshaped, wooden walking stick, which was curved at the top. Robey later used the costume for his character, The Prime Minister of Mirth. The outfit helped Robey become instantly recognisable on the London music hall circuit. He next made a start at building his repertoire and bought the rights to comic songs and monologues by several well-established music hall writers, including Sax Rohmer and Bennett Scott. For his routines, Robey developed a characteristic delivery described by Cotes as [...] "a kind of machine-gun staccato rattle through each polysyllabic line, ending abruptly, and holding the pause while he <b>fixed</b> <b>his</b> audience with his basilisk stare." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some see Schopenhauer's {{account of}} the Will as closely {{resembling}} classic examples of Monism. [...] Schopenhauer also developed some ideas {{that can be found}} in the theory of evolution, before Darwin began to publish his work, for example the idea that all life strives to preserve itself and to engender new life, and that our mental faculties are merely tools to that end. However, he saw species as <b>fixed.</b> <b>His</b> respect for the rights of animals – including a vehement opposition to vivisection – has led many modern animal rights activists to find in him a precursor of their positions. He thought of animals and humans as both being objectifications of the same underlying Will.|$|E
