This type of ice is found in permafrost, and can be thousands of years old.|$|R

It is the first major art earthwork to be supported by government funds, including from the National Endowment for the Arts. It is 32% grade at its steepest part, steeper than Filbert Street in San Francisco.|$|R
50|$|The first fossilized {{specimen}} of the species, though not recognized as such at the time, {{was a single}} fragment of humerus (arm bone) found in Pliocene strata in the Kanapoi region of West Lake Turkana by a Harvard University research team in 1965. The specimen was tentatively assigned {{at the time to}} Australopithecus and dated about four million years old. One method used to determine the age of the Kanapoi fossils was based on faunal correlation data, which, established a range between 4.0 and 4.5 mya. Little additional information was uncovered until 1987, when Canadian archaeologist Allan Morton (with Harvard University's Koobi Fora Field School) discovered fragments of a specimen protruding from a partially <b>eroded</b> <b>hillside</b> east of Allia Bay, near Lake Turkana, Kenya.|$|R
60|$|Then {{there was}} a great farming section, {{extending}} north and south for hundreds of miles in some part of the temperate regions, with a climate and flora and fauna largely resembling those of California. Not once, nor twice, but thousands of different times I journeyed through this dream-region. The point I desire to call attention to was that it was always the same region. No essential feature of it ever differed in the different dreams. Thus it was always an eight-hour drive behind mountain horses from the alfalfa meadows (where I kept many Jersey cows) to the straggly village beside the big dry creek, where I caught the little narrow-gauge train. Every land-mark in that eight-hour drive in the mountain buckboard, every tree, every mountain, every ford and bridge, every ridge and <b>eroded</b> <b>hillside</b> was ever the same.|$|R
50|$|The {{immediate}} harm {{from the}} damage {{is limited to the}} area downstream of the breach, <b>eroding</b> the <b>hillside</b> to form a canyon. However, a major danger is that the spillway can erode back up toward the gate because of being undercut by the water falling into the crater. Eventually, this would threaten the spillway gate, in close proximity to the actual abutment of the dam.|$|R
50|$|Hydrosprigging, {{similar to}} hydroseeding, {{is the use}} of sprigs or cut stolons and {{rhizomes}} in a slurry of fertilizer, mulch, and binding agent, sprayed with a hose over a target area. This can be effective in areas sensitive to soil surface disturbance, such as <b>eroding</b> shorelines, <b>hillsides</b> or other slopes of varying steepness, or in diversion channels. The slurry can be sprayed over 1000 ft from a 1.5 inch cm hose.|$|R
50|$|Sauk Trail Woods {{are located}} within the Cook County Forest Preserves in Park Forest and Chicago Heights, Illinois. They {{are part of the}} Thorn Creek Trail System. They contain miles of paved bike trails and off-trail dirt paths. Sauk Trail Woods {{contains}} Sauk Lake and Thorn Creek. The topography is fairly hilly, featuring ravines and steep, <b>eroded</b> <b>hillsides.</b> The elevation is the highest {{on the outskirts of the}} preserve. Then, as one goes into the Thorn Creek River Valley, you descend steep hills and sandy bluffs. There is an abundance of ravines that have been cut by creeks flowing into the valley. Many of the ravines are surprisingly deep near the bottom of the valley. Most of the Sauk Trail Woods Preserve is covered by dense woods, however there are some open prairie areas. In the northwest section of the woods, there is a fairly large marsh, that is surrounded by thick pompus grass and shallow bogs.The woods are located on the Valparaiso Moraine, which accounts for the hilliness of the area. There are many parking lots with pavilions situated throughout the preserve.|$|R
50|$|The {{density of}} streams is very high, {{especially}} on the lower slopes which have never been glaciated. The ice cap which used to cover the mountain during the Pliocene eroded large U-shaped valleys which tend to only have one large stream.Where the original shape of the shield volcano is still preserved, there have been millions of years for streams to <b>erode</b> the <b>hillside.</b> This area is therefore characterised by frequent deep fluvial V-shaped valleys. The gradual transition from glaciated to fluvial valley can be clearly observed.|$|R
40|$|Although the {{pollination}} {{biology of}} many individual plant species {{has been investigated}} in the Oriental region, there have been very few community-level studies. The two most comprehensive of these were in the primary mixed dipterocarp forest of Lambir Hills National Park, Sarawak (4 ° 20 [prime prime or minute]N: Momose et al. 1998, Sakai et al. 1999) and in the warm temperate evergreen broad-leaved forest and cool temperate mixed forest on Yakushima Island (30 °N: Yumoto 1987, 1988). Hong Kong (22 ° 17 [prime prime or minute]N) lies midway between these sites, at the northern margin of the tropics, where winter temperatures fall below 10 °C at sea-level {{for a few days}} every year and there are occasional frosts above 400 m (Dudgeon & Corlett 1994). Latitudinal effects, however, are compounded in comparisons with other well-studied East Asian sites, by centuries of massive human impact, leaving a degraded landscape of steep, <b>eroded</b> <b>hillsides,</b> covered in fire-maintained grassland, secondary shrublands and, locally, secondary forests (Zhuang & Corlett 1997). This history has left a relatively impoverished fauna but a surprisingly diverse flora, including 400 native tree species (Corlett & Turner 1997). In these circumstances, failures of pollination and dispersal mutualisms might be expected to accelerate the loss of plant species from the landscape (Bond 1994, Kearns & Inouye 1997). Previous studies have shown that most woody vegetation in Hong Kong is dominated by species whose seeds can be dispersed by the commonest avian frugivores, the light-vented and red-whiskered bulbuls (Pycnonotus sinensis (Gmelin) and P. jocosus (Linn.)) and the Japanese white-eye (Zosterops japonicus Swinhoe) (Corlett 1996, 1998), but there is no equivalent information available on pollination biology. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
25|$|The Cheyenne {{believe that}} there were many {{different}} kinds of water monsters that lived not only in lakes, rivers, and springs but also high bluffs and hills. The locations given as water monster habitat are similar to the locations where local marine fossils can be found as fossils often <b>erode</b> out of <b>hillsides</b> or stream banks. The Cheyennes feared the water monsters, because they could be dangerous predators or capsize their canoes. Even in modern times, tradition-minded Cheyenne sometimes take pains to avoid sleeping too close to springs due to fears of water monsters.|$|R
50|$|The {{underlying}} {{bedrock of}} the valley is chalk which was laid down in the Cretaceous geological period.

40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2015. Includes bibliographical references. Climate {{change is}} {{a clear and present}} threat in small {{tropical}} islands, requiring solutions at both global and local levels. The goal of this research was to take a community-based approach to building island resilience against climate change. The removal of local environmental stressors helps to restore natural ecosystem functions, promoting resistance to and more rapid recovery from global climate change impacts. The Humåtak Project was developed as a community-based initiative directed at reviving coastal watersheds, downstream coral reefs, and nearshore fisheries in Guam, Micronesia. A sixpart community engagement strategy was created and serves as a model for other communities. The Humåtak Project addresses accelerated erosion, a major local environmental stressor caused by poor land-use practices. Erosion results in terrigenous sedimentation on coral reefs, which smothers and kills corals, interferes with coral reproduction and recruitment, and destroys essential fish habitat. Nearly 2, 000 volunteer hours were contributed to reducing erosion in the La Sa Fu’a Watershed. Tree seedlings and sediment filter socks were tested as watershed restoration tools over a 21 -month period. These tools were effective in trapping 112 tons of sediment on land. Previous studies indicate a 75 % reduction in sedimentation rate is required to bring Fouha Bay below severe-catastrophic sedimentation stress (> 50 mg cm- 2 day- 1). Based on the observed sediment trapping efficiency of restoration tools in this study, an estimated 0. 05 km 2 of severely <b>eroding</b> <b>hillsides</b> must be treated with 19 km of socks and 11, 000 trees to trap 2, 121 tons of sediment to achieve the necessary reduction. To inform future monitoring efforts as restoration of the watershed continues, deposited sediment in Fouha Bay was analyzed to determine grain size fractions and composition. If sediment input into the bay is controlled, existing sediment will clear out with storm-driven swells. As shown in other high islands, coral reefs are resilient and can recover after sedimentation stress is reduced, provided recruitment and survivorship remain viable. The community engagement strategy and data generated on the effectiveness of watershed restoration tools can be used in management plans to build resilience against climate change in other tropical islands...|$|R

40|$|Kenya leads Africa in tree-planting. According to a 1983 survey, {{four out}} of five {{households}} had planted trees in the preceding 12 months, and two out of five had their own tree nurseries. The story of the years leading up to this achievement show that Kenya's success is replicable. In 1971 the Kenya Forestry Department launched the Rural Afforestahon Extension Scheme, which aimed to provide one extension worker in each District to advise community and government nurseries. This was followed in 1975 by the soil conservation programme which recommended the planting of trees along terraces. Woodfuel shortages were counteracted by the creation of a Ministry of Energy in 1979, Presidential directives in the early Eighties stated that all local government offices and schools must have a tree nursery and agroforesty plot, and in 1985 the presidenhal Tree Fund was set up to encourage planting. In a single week in 1983 three million trees were planted. Added to these statutory efforts is the work of as many as 60 voluntary organizations which promote tree-planting. But it is the enterprise of the ordinary Kenyan that has put the country in the forefront of re-afforestation - now a national passion- as two examples of individual initiahve demonstrate. In 1968 Stephen Wanje bought 43 acres of <b>eroded</b> <b>hillsides</b> in western Kenya. To the derision of his neighbours he first built terraces, then planted trees, and is now more then self sufficient in fuel and timber. His farm exemplifies the principles of intensive organic farming and recycling. Bee-hives shelter under the trees; in a hollow there are four fish ponds. On a small area of flatland he grows napier grass as fodder for his ten cross-bred cows. Their dung provides fertilizer and feeds a biogas plant which heats and lights Wanje's house. Another smallholder Boaz Mukah grows eucalyptus on a 60, one-hectare,slope. In the high rainfall of the area the trees grow ten metres a year and can be coppiced every two years. Mukati sells 1500 trees each year - mainly as poles for housebuilding - and these earn him more than most factory workers make. Even reluctant smallholders are forced into tree-planting by circumstance. One man who relied almost totally on charcoal-making for an income had to fell almost all his trees in the drought year of 1983 - 84 to survive. Thus replanting was an economic necessity. Kenya's success is in large measure the result of the fact that smallholders have full ownership and control of their land, and so have the flexibility to respond to shortages, surpluses, and market prices. Also, the state is fully committed to treeplanting, and backs up this commitment with cash, resources, and publicity campaigns.

40|$|The {{greatest}} tasks {{facing the}} developing world today are to increase food production {{and to protect the}} environment. The two are inextricably linked and neither can be achieved without the other. It does not make sense {{to meet the needs of}} people today if this leaves no tomorrow for their children. In effect, development must be sustainable. It is to raise awareness not just of these challenges facing {{the developing world}}, but how to meet them constructively, that CTA has published 'Land and Food'. 'Our main aim in producing this book', writes Director of CTA, Mr Daniel Assoumou Mba in the Foreword, 'is to raise the awareness of those responsible for policies and actions in the rural areas. We also believe that it can play a useful role in a wide variety of educational programmes'. The book is designed for maximum impact on the reader: stunning aerial photographs are linked to a brief but biting commentary on the developmental mistakes of the past. Seen from the unfamiliar perspective of the aerial photographer, clustered circles of thatched huts set in denuded savanna appear vulnerable and lifeless <b>eroded</b> and scarified <b>hillsides</b> suggest the bones of a dead continent; the spreading stain of silt entering the ocean has the menace of a slow-moving poison cloud; a broad river, with virgin forest on one bank and charred stumps on the other, contrasting what is and what is to come. There is also a positive and constructive message with photographs and text showing the inventiveness and productive power of Man - dams, mosaics of rich farmland, water-harvesting, dune stabilisation and elaborately terraced hillsides. These also show the ability of seemingly simple peasants to work out and implement sustainable systems of agriculture. But there is also ample evidence that planning and imple mentation of projects must involve local people if misuse and over-exploitation of the environment are to be avoided. Nowhere in any of the photographs in 'Land and Food' is there a human face or figure but every picture is graphic evidence of human activity. The message is clear: it is people who destroy their environment and suffer for it and it is peopIe who must be mobilized and from whom the solutions must come to solve the agricultural and environmental crisis. Also none of the locations on the photographs is identified because the problems illustrated are shared and they do not stop at frontiers. It is irrelevant whether a picture of a settlement drowned by flooding is in Asia or Africa, scenes of encroaching desert are north or south of the Sahara, whether the deforestation shown is in Africa, Asia or Latin America or whether an eroded mountain is in the Caribbean or the Pacific; the unity is the Tropical world. The book embraces seven themes: People; Land, soil and vegetation; Livestock and wildlife: Water resources Erosion, land degradation and desertification, Sustainable development; Pollution and waste. But no aspect of the environment exists or can be treated alone and there is cross-referral in pictures and text. There have been other books of photographs of life in the Tropics but Lloyd Timberlake, who wrote the introduction, draws a distinction between them and this publication when he warns: 'There is a beauty in the rural tropics which can blind us to the underlying reality, to the problems and challenges. Even poverty and the daily struggle appear quaint, curious and romantic. The photos in this book, taken from the sky, disorient us. They force us to focus anew. We see not human beings but human processes'. 'Land and Food' was designed and produced under the direction of Robert Dellere, Head of CTA's Technical Division, who also contributed to the text. In the epilogue he brings an optimistic view to the challenges outlined: 'Rational solutions based on experience and the accumulated store of scientific and technical knowledge are available. If governments and people are made aware of the stakes and are prepared to respond by mobilising their energies and coordinating their efforts, then it will be possible to say with confidence that there is, indeed, hope'. 'Land and Food' published by CTA in English and French, both languages available in hard or soft covers.
