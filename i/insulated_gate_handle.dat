40|$|Abstract—This paper {{deals with}} an active gate drive (AGD) {{technology}} for high-power <b>insulated</b> <b>gate</b> bipolar transistors (IGBT’s). It {{is based on}} an optimal combination of several requirements necessary for good switching performance under hard-switching conditions. The scheme specifically combines together the slow drive requirements for low noise and switching stress and the fast drive requirements for high-speed switching and low switching energy loss. The gate drive can also effectively dampen oscillations during low-current turn-on transient in the IGBT. This paper looks at the conflicting requirements of the conventional gate drive circuit design and demonstrates using experimental results that the proposed three-stage AGD technique can be an effective solution.
