50|$|The Merit PCPs and SCPs {{eventually}} {{replaced the}} <b>Data</b> <b>Concentrators</b> and Remote <b>Data</b> <b>Concentrators</b> at the University of Michigan. At their peak {{there were more}} than 300 Merit PCPs and SCPs installed, supporting more than 10,000 terminal ports.|$|R
30|$|Smart meters are {{interconnected}} {{by means}} of communication links, usually narrowband power line communication to <b>data</b> <b>concentrators</b> at the transformer stations. From here, backbone networks (e.g., glass fibre) bring the data to control centres. Existing communication infrastructures are an essential precondition of smart metering systems, but in many grids they are still nonexistent.|$|R
30|$|The EDR {{supervision}} {{network is}} primarily intended for ensuring continuous {{operation of the}} EDR capturing devices. Like Phasor <b>Data</b> <b>Concentrators,</b> we gain awareness of the acquisition system status and provide device managing methods. Due to the separate handling of the captured data transfer (see sub-chapter 2.3), this supervision system is mainly responsible for observing the EDR performance.|$|R
50|$|In 2016, Energa-Operator has {{installed}} in its network 6.6k of <b>Data</b> <b>Concentrator</b> Units with balancing meter functionality, basing on Phoenix-RTOS. License agreements {{to use the}} system in mass production of smart meters have been signed.|$|E
50|$|The RDA {{is located}} {{in an area of}} several square miles just South of the city of Lamar, Colorado, in the United States, part of the area {{proposed}} for Auger North. It consists of surface detectors (water tanks instrumented with photomultiplier tubes and readout electronics), communication towers, and a building housing the <b>data</b> <b>concentrator</b> and computing. The ten water tanks are instrumented with one photomultiplier tube each to detect the Cherenkov radiation generated by particles in cosmic ray air showers. (The water tanks currently used in the southern Pierre Auger observatory use three photomultiplier tubes each.) The communication towers will test a new way to transport data from the water tanks to the <b>data</b> <b>concentrator.</b> A higher bandwidth will benefit many possible upgrades to the southern site. A new communication system is also needed to allow the proposed northern detector array to cover a larger area than the existing southern observatory. In the existing system all surface detectors directly transmit to a single point. In a larger array this would not be feasible. Surface detectors would communicate with their nearest neighbors and surface detectors close to the single <b>data</b> <b>concentrator</b> station would relay the data from surface detectors that are further away.|$|E

50|$|These {{front-end}} processors, usually DEC PDP-8, PDP-11, or LSI-11 based with locally developed custom {{hardware and}} software, {{would act as}} IBM control units attached to the IBM input/output channels {{on one side and}} to modems and phone lines on the other. At the University of Michigan the front-end processor was known as the <b>Data</b> <b>Concentrator</b> (DC). The DC was developed as part of the CONCOMP project by Dave Mills and others and was the first non-IBM device developed for attachment to an IBM I/O Channel. Initially a PDP-8 based system, the DC was upgraded to use PDP-11 hardware and a Remote <b>Data</b> <b>Concentrator</b> (RDC) was developed that used LSI-11 hardware that connected back to a DC over a synchronous data circuit. The University of British Columbia (UBC) developed two PDP-11 based systems: the Host Interface Machine (HIM) and the Network Interface Machine (NIM). The University of Alberta used a PDP-11 based Front-end processor.|$|E
50|$|From 1965 to 1970 he was Project Director for the ARPA {{sponsored}} CONCOMP (Research in Conversational Use of Computers) Project. He {{was involved}} {{in the design of the}} architecture and negotiations with IBM over the virtual memory features that would be included in what became the IBM S/360 Model 67 computer. When IBM's TSS/360 time-sharing operating system for the S/360-67 was not available, the CONCOMP project supported the initial development of Michigan Terminal System (MTS) in cooperation with the staff of the University of Michigan Computing Center. This included David L. Mills development of the original PDP-8 <b>Data</b> <b>Concentrator</b> with its interface to an IBM S/360 Input/Output channel, the first such interface to be built outside of IBM. CONCOMP also developed the IBM 7772 based Audio Response Unit (ARU) as an I/O device for use with MTS, the MAD/I compiler, mini-computer based graphics terminals, and the Set-Theoretic Data Structure model that was later used in ILIR:MICRO.|$|E
50|$|Started in 2003, Echelon's Networked Energy Services {{system was}} an open {{metering}} service.Echelon provides the underlying network technology for the world's largest Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) in Italy with over 27 million connected electricity meters.Based on the experiences with this installation, Echelon developed the NES (Networked Energy Services) System (including smart meters, <b>data</b> <b>concentrators</b> and a head-end data collection system) with about 3.5 million devices installed.|$|R
50|$|These meters {{are fully}} {{electronic}} and smart, with integrated bi-directional communications, advanced power measurement and management capabilities, an integrated, software-controllable disconnect switch, and an all solid-state design. They communicate over low {{voltage power line}} using standards-based power line technology from Echelon Corporation to Echelon <b>data</b> <b>concentrators</b> at which point they communicate via IP to Enel's enterprise servers. Demonstrating that with power line communication, smart meters don't require WiFi radios.|$|R
30|$|After {{collecting}} the data, PMUs send {{the data to}} phasor <b>data</b> <b>concentrators</b> (PDCs). PDC is a device that combines data from several measurement devices. They receive phasor measurements from remote PMUs through a communication medium and stores data in a database management system. The function of the PDC is data handling, synchronization, processing, and storage. PDC through its monitoring system also provides information on the system’s performance parameters like latency, data quality, frame rate etc [13].|$|R
50|$|PMUs measure {{voltages}} and currents at principal intersecting locations (critical substations) on a {{power grid}} and can output accurately time-stamped {{voltage and current}} phasors. Because these phasors are truly synchronized, synchronized comparison of two quantities is possible in real time. These comparisons {{can be used to}} assess system conditions-such as; frequency changes, MW, MVARs, kVolts, etc. The monitored points are preselected through various studies to make extremely accurate phase angle measurements to indicate shifts in system (grid) stability. The phasor data is collected either on-site or at centralized locations using Phasor <b>Data</b> <b>Concentrator</b> technologies. The data is then transmitted to a regional monitoring system which is maintained by the local Independent System Operator (ISO). These ISO's will monitor phasor data from individual PMU's or from as many as 150 PMU's — this monitoring provides an accurate means of establishing controls for power flow from multiple energy generation sources (nuclear, coal, wind, etc.).|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we {{address the problem of}} im-plementing wide-area {{oscillation}} monitoring algorithms for large power system networks using distributed processing of Synchrophasor measurements. We consider two computational approaches, namely decentralized least squares (DLS) and its recursive implementation (RLS). Both algorithms are executed using multiple phasor <b>data</b> <b>concentrators</b> (PDC), deployed as virtual computing machines communicating over a fiber-optic communication network. Results are demonstrated using the US-Wide ExoGENI communication network connected to a PMU testbed at NC State University, and analyze the end-to-end computational and communication delays for both algorithms...|$|R
30|$|Inside the UCTE, the WAMS {{measurements}} are exchanged between the transmission system operators (TSOs) for calibration of system dynamic models or postmortem analysis. One major focus currently is the permanent {{monitoring of the}} sporadic appearance of poorly damped inter-area oscillations. Activities of exchanging online measurements between several <b>data</b> <b>concentrators</b> have already started and are in the phase of further extensions. Current partners of these plans are the TSOs from Austria, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Slovenia, and Switzerland. The additional basic functions can be summarized as: voltage phase angle difference monitoring, line thermal monitoring, voltage stability monitoring, and online monitoring of system damping, etc.|$|R
30|$|In China, {{the main}} station of the WAMS {{is located at}} the {{regional}} or provincial dispatching center and composed of an advanced application station, database server, and <b>data</b> <b>concentrator.</b> The advanced application station retrieves data from a <b>data</b> <b>concentrator</b> via local area network (LAN) instead of Ethernet, which reduces the time delay of the data. Currently, some data concentrators have already contained 5000 phasor measurements with the 100 Hz storage rate.|$|E

30|$|State-of-the-art {{monitoring}} systems for dynamic state estimation are currently encouraged by phasor measurement units (PMUs), which measure current, voltage, frequency, and phase at selected locations. PMUs {{are capable of}} synchronous acquisition and provide up to 50 / 60 datasets per second [11]. The calculated electrical characteristics are transferred to a Phasor <b>Data</b> <b>Concentrator</b> (PDC) for selection and further aggregation or even forwarded to grid protection and control units. Proprietary systems like ABB PSGuard PSG 830 /PSG 850, Siemens Siguard Phasor Data Processor (PDP), Schweitzer Engineering Laboratory SEL- 3373 /SEL- 3378, or Alstom Grid S 800 substation Phasor <b>Data</b> <b>Concentrator</b> (sPDC) are used for medium- and high-voltage grid monitoring today [12]. However, network operators {{are not allowed to}} provide full data access for academic research due to privacy protection. Furthermore, deviations between specifications of various PMU types reduce the comparability between different manufacturers, especially at off-nominal frequencies [13]. The Open Source Phasor <b>Data</b> <b>Concentrator</b> (OpenPDC) [14] is an interesting license-free open-source software project for streaming typical PMU data time series in real-time.
