For fillet end-mill, because of its complexity geometry in flank and fillet parts, a free-form geometry model is needed for further analysis and optimization. Many research works have been conducted on building geometric model based on grinding tool path. In this thesis, a parametric and easy controlled method is proposed for design and modeling of the fillet flank and the <b>fillet</b> rake <b>surface.</b> First, the end and side clearance surface need to be established according to geometric parameters and constraints; Secondly, the fillet cutting edge is designed to achieve the machining requirement of the corner radius geometry, which is critical for the modeling of the fillet flank and the <b>fillet</b> rake <b>surface</b> face; Then, the <b>surface</b> of the <b>fillet</b> flank is supported by splines which derived from the customized two-dimensional corner. And a rake angle based method is applied for modeling of the <b>fillet</b> rake <b>surface.</b> A detailed discussion on parametric variables of this method is provided for a more accurate surface. Together with flutes and gashes, the solid model of the fillet end-mill can be modeled using Boolean operations.

The algorithm is engineered to model experimental configurations where irregularities in surface geometry preclude {{the use of}} less rigorous approaches, such as a field expansion about a single entry point. The algorithm formulation represents the transmitted pulse as a surface integral coinciding with a pulse origin aperture, employing the Green function for the water-component system. The model explicitly considers the component surface geometry over the footprint of the incident pulse, thus allowing consideration of smooth yet non-expandable (i. e. in power series about a single point) geometries, such as adjoining flat and <b>fillet</b> <b>surfaces.</b> A computationally efficient algorithm results from use of asymptotic Green function approximations. Approaches are also discussed under conditions where the asymptotic Green function expressions are singular or invalid, due to focusing by surface concavity or transmission near critical angles.

40|$|Fillet {{quality of}} farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) is {{affected}} by {{a broad range of}} preand post-mortem factors. This thesis focuses mainly on the impact of pancreas disease (PD), salt composition and salting method on pigment concentration and colour of raw and coldsmoked salmon fillets, but fillet composition, texture and drip losses are as well considered. The fish material used to study effects of PD on fillet quality was sampled from commercial farming locations to obtain a broad overview and identify potential common properties of PD affected salmon (Paper I). The farming locations participated in a cohort study reported by Jansen et al. (2010), hence the salmon were sampled from populations with a well documented disease history. Salmon from seven farms were diagnosed with PD (diagnosed 0 - 12 months prior to slaughtering); salmon from one farm were infected with salmonid alpha virus (SAV) without an outbreak of PD, whereas salmon from two farms had no records of PD diagnosis and worked as control farms. To obtain knowledge on underlying causes to quality deviations of PD affected salmon, individuals with different PD pathology within a population diagnosed with PD at time of slaughtering was investigated (Paper II). Anecdotal information indicates that PD may cause poor general muscle quality and in particular pale and irregular colouration. Salmon diagnosed with PD at slaughter, or six months prior to slaughter confirmed this. Changes in quality in the order of their appearance were decreased CF, depleted muscle glycogen, increased drip loss of raw muscle, paler colour, depleted protein and finally harder texture in smoked salmon fillets. Salmon infected with salmonid alphavirus (SAV) without a PD outbreak and salmon diagnosed one year before slaughtering, had similar quality as unaffected fish, although paler colour might occur even after one year recovery. Within a population of farmed Atlantic salmon diagnosed with PD at time of slaughtering, a large variation was observed among individuals in pathological profile, gene expression profile in heart tissue, and fillet quality characteristics. Deteriorated quality and dysfunction of the digestive system was most pronounced in fish with severe loss of pancreas. Dry salting significantly reduced the stability of carotenoids in the <b>fillet</b> <b>surface</b> of coldsmoked salmon fillets as compared to injection salting (Paper IV). The salt content in pre rigor injection salted fillets was similar as those salted post rigor (2. 4 % versus 2. 6 %, respectively), whereas the fillet colour was more translucence. However, injection salting of pre rigor fillets can be recommended. Moreover, state of rigor mortis at time of salting had no effect on the carotenoid stability. Low correlations between colorimetric parameters and content of carotenoids in the <b>fillet</b> <b>surface,</b> illustrated that additional factors affects the visual appearance of cold smoked salmon. Nitrite salt curing (Paper III) improved the colour of cold-smoked salmon fillets (more reddish, darker and less yellowish). However, only slight higher carotenoid stability during processing was observed. The improved colour was most probably related to formation of nitrosomyoglobin. Salmon fillets treated with nitrite (fine refined salt added 0. 6 % sodium nitrite) had a relatively high amount of residual nitrite, however higher contents of Nnitrosoamines were not observed. It is concluded that salmon diagnosed with PD at slaughter, or six months prior to slaughter showed deteriorated fillet quality, whereas salmon infected with salmonid alphavirus (SAV) without a PD outbreak and salmon diagnosed one year before slaughtering, had similar quality as unaffected fish. Moreover it is concluded that nitrite salt improved the appearance of cold-smoked salmon fillets and dry salting reduced the stability of carotenoids in the <b>fillet</b> <b>surface</b> as compared to injection salting...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. With the {{development}} of new steels and processing techniques, there have been corresponding advances in the fatigue performance of steels. Methods to increase fatigue performance are typically designed to produce gradients in surface properties and are based on heat treating operations, including enhanced carburizing and induction hardening, as well as surface mechanical deformation. In this paper selected examples based on recent work on deep rolling is used to illustrate the importance of the base steel properties on the final performance of surface modified materials. The degree of fatigue improvement by deep rolling, a process to mechanically deform <b>fillet</b> <b>surfaces</b> to improve fatigue resistance in cylindrical components, depends on the deformation response of the substrate to the rolling process. Recent results on the behavior of three medium carbon steel alloys deformed at temperatures up to 360 °C, are discussed. Deep rolling increased fatigue resistance, and the degree of improvement was higher when deep rolling was applied in the dynamic strain aging (DSA) temperature range rather than at room temperature. Observed variations in fatigue performance are interpreted based on fundamental deformation mechanisms and are used to present an overall perspective on approaches to increase the fatigue resistance of conventional and newly developed steels...|$|R
40|$|With the {{development}} of new steels and processing techniques, there have been corresponding advances in the fatigue performance of automotive components. These advances have led to increased component life and smaller power transfer systems. New processing approaches to enhance the fatigue performance of steels are reviewed with an emphasis on carburizing and deep rolling. Selected examples are presented to illustrate the importance of the base steel properties on the final performance of surface modified materials. Results on carburized gear steels illustrate the dependence of the fatigue behavior on carburizing process control (gas and vacuum carburizing), alloy additions and microstructure. The importance of retained austenite content, case and core grain size as controlled by processing and microalloy additions, extent of intergranular oxidation, and the residual stress profile on fatigue performance is also illustrated. Specific recent results on the use of microalloying elements (e. g. Nb) and process history control to limit austenite grain growth at the higher carburizing temperatures associated with vacuum carburizing are highlighted. For crankshaft applications, deep rolling is highlighted, a process to mechanically work <b>fillet</b> <b>surfaces</b> to improve fatigue resistance. The influence of the deformation behavior of the substrate, as characterized by standard tensile and compression tests, on the ability to create desired surface properties and residual stress profiles will be illustrated with data on several new steels of current and future interest for crankshaft applications...|$|R

Commercially reared fish (5. 65 [*]kg, Kf: 1. 23, pH: 7. 29, muscle temperature: 6. 68 [*]℃) were killed and immediately tempered in three different containers. Muscle temperatures after filleting (< 3 [*]h postmortem) of the three groups were 2. 08 [*]℃ (hereafter named T- 2); 9. 07 [*]℃ (hereafter named T- 9), and 14. 09 [*]℃ (hereafter named T- 14), respectively. The pH after filleting was significantly low for T- 14 (6. 93) followed by T- 9 (7. 06) and T- 2 (7. 22). Raised temperature at point of filleting was found to significantly alter development of rigor mortis, which subsequently affected muscle pH and the reflective properties of the <b>fillet</b> <b>surface</b> during 14 days' ice storage. Of cold-smoked fillets, however, a more distinct effect of raised temperature was observed on visual perception resulting in lighter and more yellowish cold-smoked fillets after 14 days' storage.

40|$|High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) can be {{used for}} the {{localized}} heating of biological tissue through the conversion of sound waves into heat. Although originally developed for human medicine, HIFU may also be used to weaken the attachment of pin bones in fish fillets to enable easier removal of such bones. This was shown in the present study, where a series of experiments were performed on HIFU phantoms and fillets of cod and salmon. In thin objects such as fish fillets, the heat is mainly dissipated at the surfaces. However, bones inside the fillet absorb ultrasound energy more efficiently than the surrounding tissue, resulting in a “self-focusing” heating of the bones. Salmon skin was found to effectively block the ultrasound, resulting in a significantly lower heating effect in fillets with skin. Cod skin partly blocked the ultrasound, but only to a small degree, enabling HIFU treatment through the skin. The treatment of fillets to reduce the pin bone attachment yielded an average reduction in the required pulling force by 50 % in cod fillets with skin, with little muscle denaturation, and 72 % in skinned fillets, with significant muscle denaturation. Salmon fillets were treated from the muscle side of the fillet to circumvent the need for penetration through skin. The treatment resulted in a 30 % reduction in the peak pulling force and 10 % reduction in the total pulling work, with a slight denaturation of the <b>fillet</b> <b>surface...</b>|$|E

40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out to examine the {{behavior}} of Listeria monocytogenes {{in the course of}} fabrication and storage of smoked salmon. In three trials, raw salmon <b>fillets</b> were <b>surface</b> inoculated with L. monocytogenes, marinated, smoked at 26 to 30 degrees C, and stored at 4 or 10 degrees C for up to 30 days. At different times during the fabrication and storage, samples were taken and, by means of the three-tube most probable number (MPN) method, quantitatively analyzed for the concentration of L. monocytogenes. The initial Listeria levels in the raw fillets were 10 (4) MPN/g in trial 1, 10 (1) MPN/g in trial 2, and 10 (2) MPN/g in trial 3. During the fabrication, neither an increase nor a decrease of the inoculated quantities was observed.

In the second trial, the Listeria level remained about the same. The results indicate the importance of preventing pre- and postprocessing contamination of L. monocytogenes in raw and smoked salmon.

30|$|At present, the {{simplified}} method commonly used for three-dimensional models is the {{simplified method}} in CGAL (computational geometry algorithms library). CGAL is a computational geometry algorithms library written in C++. In the simplification of the 3 D mesh, the simplified method of edge collapse is used [7, 8], and the Lindstrom-Turk method {{is used to}} calculate the collapse cost of each side. Although the efficiency is high, the accuracy is not high, and the effective detail features of the model cannot be retained. The simplified method based on the <b>fillet</b> <b>surface</b> reconstruction proposed by Peng et al. [9] realizes the simplification of the <b>fillet</b> <b>surface,</b> which is applicable to the model with fillet characteristics but not universal. Other simplified methods for 3 D models, such as the 3 D model simplification algorithm with texture proposed by Feng and Zhou [10], consider the geometric information of the model and the geometric error of the texture information. Zhou and Chen [11] put forward a mesh model simplification algorithm based on polygon vertex normal vector, which is a simplified method of visual feature optimization. Quan et al. [12] propose the geometric model simplification method based on the region segmentation. This method needs to keep the detail features and introduce the region segmentation principle of the image. A mesh model region segmentation method based on curvature for region growing is proposed, and then it is simplified according to the ratio of the number of triangles in the region. Zhang et al. [13] put forward a new simplification method of terrain model based on divergence function. This method combines the discrete particle swarm theory to simplify the terrain model based on the hierarchical structure of the implicit quadtree. An improved mesh simplification algorithm based on edge collapse was introduced in [14]. In this algorithm, the quadric error metric was utilized to compute the vertex significance and control the sequence of edge collapse. Sanchez et al. [15] use an estimated local density of the point cloud to simplify the point cloud. In this method, the point clouds are clustered by using the expectation maximization algorithm according to the local distribution of the points. Then, a linear programming model is applied to reduce the cloud. Han et al. [16] propose a point cloud simplification method with preserved edge points. In this work, the authors try their best to retain the edge points since these points have more significant properties than non-edge points. First, a least square plane is constructed by using the topology relationship of the points and normal vectors and then each point in the vicinity is projected to the fitted plane. Next, the edge points can be extracted according to the homogeneity of projection. These detected edge points are retained in the decimating process. As For the non-edge points, the authors delete the least important points until the predesigned simplification rate is satisfied. In [17], the incremental segmentation and triangulation of planar segments from dense point clouds are studied to enhance the quality and efficiency. In this paper, the authors proposed a point-based triangulation algorithm to improve the planar segment decimation and triangulation in a gradually expanding point cloud map as well as a polygon-based triangulation algorithm. Both of the two algorithms can produce more accurate and simpler planar triangulations. Although the above method can simplify the model, it cannot keep the effective details of the model, and it is inefficient when dealing with the models with large amount of points.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the effect of dry salting, cold smoking and 14 days refrigerated storage at 4 °C on the stability of carotenoids, color and fatty acids in commercially reared organic Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.). As reference, conventionally reared Atlantic salmon was used. Pigment sources in feeds for the organic and conventional salmon were Panaferd-AX® (PAN) and Carophyll Pink® (CP), respectively. The dry salting process was found to be the main cause for losses of carotenoids throughout salting, smoking and storage, whereas no differences were found in stability of the different flesh carotenoids. The diverse composition of flesh carotenoids in organic salmon seems however to have minor influence on the color of the cold smoked product. Colorimetric characteristics of the <b>fillet</b> <b>surface</b> and liquid loss during storage of cold smoke fillets were found to be mostly affected by the fatty acid composition of the flesh which differed between the organic and conventional raw material. Moreover, dry salting and cold smoking were found to alter colorimetric differences between raw organically and conventionally reared salmon, resulting in an equal colorimetric perception of cold smoked organic and conventional salmon fillets after 14 days refrigerated vacuum storage.

The solder joints were evaluated that were in place on connectors made with the current soldering process as well as an alternative induction soldering process for attaching the EMR adapter ring to the shell. Very similar observations were made, which crossed the different pedigrees of parts and processes. The extent of cracking in the top side fillets varied between the different connector samples and likely the EMR adapter ring to the shell. Very similar observations were made, which crossed the different pedigrees of parts and processes. The extent of cracking in the top side fillets varied between the different connector samples and likely reflected the different extents to which the connector was mated to its counterpart assembly. In all cases, the spring finger solder joints on the SA 1358 - 10 connectors were remelted {{as a result of the}} subsequent EMR adapter ring attachment process. Spalling of the Cd (Cr) overplating layer was also observed for these connectors, which was a consequence of the remelting activity. On the other hand, the SA 2052 - 4 connector did not exhibit evidence of remelting of the spring finger solder joint. The Cd (Cr) layer did not show signs of spalling. These results suggested that, due to the size of the SA 1358 - 10 connector, any of the former or current soldering processes used to attach the EMR adapter ring and/or EMR shell to the connector shell, requires a level of heat energy that will always result in the remelting of the spring finger solder joint attached with either the Sn-Ag or the Sn-Sb alloy. Lastly, it was construed that the induction soldering process, which is used to attach the EMR adapter ring onto the shell, was more likely to have caused the remelting event rather than the more localized heat source of the hand soldering iron used to attach the EMR shell to the adapter ring...|$|E

Direct plating was also carried out. Listeria spp. were isolated from 43 of 258 (16. 7 %) samples, with hot smoked products yielding 25. 4 % (36 / 142) of the isolates, and cold smoked products yielding 6 % (7 / 116). Cod had {{the highest rate of}} Listeria contamination at 46. 7 %. Of the 43 Listeria spp. isolated, 18 (41. 9 %) were L. innocua, 13 (30. 2 %) were L. welshimeri, and 12 (27. 7 %) were L. monocytogenes. Eleven isolates of L. monocytogenes were serotype 1 / 2, and one was 4 b. There was an indication that Listeria spp., particularly L. monocytogenes, occurred more commonly during the cooler months. All Listeria isolates were detected after 48 h primary enrichment. The secondary enrichment step failed to enhance the isolation rate. Direct plating yielded only 26 % of the total isolates. PALCAM, a listeria selective agar, proved more efficient in recovering Listeria spp. from smoked fish products. [...] Multilocus enzyme electrophoresis is an epidemiological tool applied in this study to Listeria strains isolated from smoked seafoods to determine if the strains were from a common contamination source. The 57 strains analyzed resulted in 57 distinct electrophoretic types (ETs) indicating many sources of contamination. Major divisions among the four different Listeria spp. (L. innocua, L. monocytogenes, L. welshimeri, L. ivanovii) occurred at genetic distances of 0. 72 to 0. 85. All 14 enzymes were polymorphic and had a mean genetic diversity of 0. 683. The L. monocytogenes strains were not of a single clone nor were they of the same ETs as the two human isolates. This indicates the great need for better sanitation practices in the food processing environment. [...] Experiments were conducted to study the effects of the cold smoking process and storage on the organism in artificially inoculated cod fillets. In three trials, cod <b>fillets</b> were <b>surface</b> inoculated with L. monocytogenes, cold smoked, vacuum-packaged, stored at 4 °C for 3 weeks or at - 20 °C for 3 months, and quantitatively processed for Listeria using the three-tube most probable number method (MPN). The initial inoculation concentrations were 10 ⁵ MPN/g in trial 1, 10 ² MPN/g in trial 2, and 10 ⁰ MPN/g in trial 3. The organism, relatively stable during the smoking process, increased with storage at 4 °C, but decreased in cell number at - 20 °C. Growth was very slow in trial 3 possibly because of the low inoculum level. Hence, L. monocytogenes contamination in smoked seafoods, not cooked prior to consumption, may pose a health risk to the consumer...|$|R
5000|$|According to the {{original}} description by Barclay Philips, [...] In the earth with which the coffin was filled were numerous small fragments of carious bone, apparently charred, {{some of which were}} picked out; and about the centre, as if, said one of the men, they had rested on the breast of the body interred, were found the following curious relics: —An Amber Cup, hemispherical in shape, rather deep in proportion to its width, with a [...] " [...] lip [...] " [...] or [...] " [...] nick," [...] and ornamented merely with a band of fine lines running round the outside, about half an inch from the top. There is one handle, large enough for the insertion of a finger, ornamented with a fillet {{on each side of the}} surface, which is flat, similar to that on the cup itself. From the fact of the rim not being perfectly round, and the band before mentioned not passing over the space within the handle, and its being marked off with a line at each end, seemingly cut across, we may conjecture it to have been made and carved by hand. There are two small chips in the rim.That on the left of the handle is fresh, and was caused by the man who found the cup accidentally striking it, as he told me, with his spade, when he first came upon it that on the right is not so large, but is ancient, as is shown by its appearance. The cup is perfectly smooth inside and out, excepting where the earth in which it was buried still adheres to the surface but since its exhumation the amber has cracked slightly in every part. On the cup being lifted by the handle, this broke into two pieces, having received a blow from the workman's spade, but fortunately the fragments fit very exactly, and I have therefore easily repaired it.The following are the dimensions of the cup, which I have carefully measured, expressed in inches and decimal parts: — External diameter, 3.5 inches; internal, 3.35. Height, 2.5 depth, 2.4. Internal diameter at and below band, 3'; width of lip, '125. Distance of band from upper rim of lip, [...]5; width of band of six fillets, [...]3. Width of handle at upper and lower end, 1.5 in centre,"6. Thickness of handle, '2; depth of handle from upper surface of insertion between lip and <b>fillet</b> to <b>surface</b> below, 1'4. Projection of handle from surface of cup to outer surface of handle, [...]85; average thickness of cup, [...]2.According to these measurements I find, by calculation, that the capacity of the cup is a little more than half a pint.|$|R
40|$|Multilayer ceramic {{capacitors}} (MLCCs) {{are known}} to be susceptible to cracking when subjected to excessive printed circuit board (PCB) flexure, which is called "flex cracking". The bending of the printed circuit board causes stresses to be transmitted through the solder <b>fillets</b> to the <b>surface</b> mount capacitors. These stresses are the highest {{at the bottom of the}} capacitor, where the termination bands end. In order to reduce the amount of stress that is transmitted to the brittle ceramic body of MLCCs through end terminations, a flexible termination system which incorporates a silver-loaded epoxy in end-terminations was developed by some MLCC manufacturers. With the transition to lead-free materials in the electronics industry there is a concern that MLCCs assembled on PCBs with lead-free solder have different susceptibility to flex cracking than those assembled with eutectic tin-lead solder. In this study, the flex cracking of MLCCs assembled with lead-free solder (Sn 3. 0 Ag 0. 5 Cu) was compared with those assembled with eutectic tin-lead (Sn 37 Pb) solder and differences in the results were explained in terms of solder mechanical properties and solder solidification temperature. Tin-silver-copper lead-free solders and eutectic tin-lead solder have different mechanical properties, which affect the stresses that are transmitted to the ceramic body of the capacitor through the solder fillet. The higher solidification temperature for lead-free solder leads to increased residual compressive stresses after the reflow cool-down process for MLCCs assembled with lead-free solder compared with those assembled with tin-lead solder. In this work, the effects of dielectric material, capacitor size, solder assembly process, solder material, and end-termination type on flex cracking of MLCCs were determined for MLCCs from different manufacturers. Since some flexible- and standard-termination MLCCs are made with precious metal electrodes (silver-palladium), there is a possibility of electrochemical silver migration under bias and humidity. In this study, the effects of temperature-humidity-bias on electrical parameters of flexible-termination MLCCs were characterized and compared with standard-termination MLCCs. In addition, the effect of temperature-humidity-bias on electrical parameters of MLCCs with base metal electrodes was compared to that for precious metal electrode capacitors...|$|R
40|$|Modelling and {{simulation}} in tribology, {{and more}} specifically of friction in lubricated contacts, has gained increasing attention over the past years. In a lubricated contact, the dissipation of energy {{is due to the}} relative motion of the mating surfaces and arise due to direct contact as well as shearing of the lubricant film. The presence of a thin lubricant film is crucial for the operation of various machine elements, e. g., for the concentrated contact between the rolling element and the raceway in a bearing. The contact in this type of applications is typically exhibiting substantial elastic deformation which together with hydrodynamics governs the formation of the lubricant film. Therefore, these type of contacts are said to operate in the Elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) regime. An elastohydrodynamically lubricated contact can be classified as line, circular or elliptical. The line contacts can also represent a truncated ellipse or be of finite length. The line contact that appears between two cylindrically shaped bodies of infinite length does of course not exist in reality. It does, however, constitute an important type of simplification of the contact in real applications where the contact length perpendicular to direction of motion is comparatively large. The {{reason for this is that}} it permits a 2 D-model for the flow and there are analytical solutions, at least in the most elementary cases. The circular and the fully elliptical contacts are more complicated. The case where the surfaces are fully separated by the lubricant film has, however, been addressed by many researchers and there are quite a few papers reporting numerical predictions validated by experimental data. The finite length line and truncated elliptical contact are even more challenging, but these are also the only physically reasonable models for EHL contacts exhibiting edge effects, created by profiled rollers or in cases where the contact ellipse becomes larger than the physical size of the contacting elements. This thesis presents the development of a fully coupled model that can be used to predict the pressure build-up and lubricant film formation in finite length line contacts. More precisely, in EHL contacts where the rolling element have profiled edges (<b>fillets)</b> and the <b>surface</b> of the counteracting element is wider than the roller, e. g., in a typical cam-roller follower contact. Hereafter this type of contact will be referred to as a 'finite EHL line contact'. The numerical analyses, conducted with the present model, were designed so that generic knowledge about friction in cam-roller follower applications would be generated, but also to provide for the development of a semi-analytical for fast and efficient estimation of friction. There are quite a few parameters that affect the friction in EHL contacts and it is already a challenge to include the most basic ones in the model. The most advanced and sophisticated models are very complex with millions of degrees of freedom and are, therefore, not yet feasible to conduct parametric studies with. The extreme conditions associated with EHL, i. e., nm thin films, with phase transition from liquid to solid, GPa pressure, temperature increase with considerable implications on lubricant flow and surface chemistry, etc., makes it even more difficult to model these systems. When modelling a cam-roller follower application, which typically results in a finite length EHL line contact, the size and geometry of the contacting parts further complicates modeling of EHL. The main objective, with this thesis project, was to design a low degree of freedom model that can be employed in a multibody dynamics model, to estimate EHL friction in milliseconds and yet capturing the most important features of a lubricated contact including edge effects. This resulted in a semi-analytical low degree of freedom (LDOF) model taking thermal effects into account and that include lubricant shear thinning and compressibility, in order to estimate the viscosity and volume of the lubricant. In addition, this LDOF model was extended to perform friction prediction covering the mixed lubrication regime where colliding asperities partially influence shearing of the lubricant. The extended, mixed lubrication LDOF, model was utilized to perform friction predictions covering a range of operating conditions, which were also covered in an experimental investigation using a ball-on-disk test device. The results turned out to compare well, suggesting that the model established in this project, is a usable tool that can be employed when designing lubricated devices and that it constitutes a suitable foundation for further developments...|$|R
