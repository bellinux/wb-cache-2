40|$|Former Title : Economic {{development}} & policy seriesFormer No. : EDP 06 - 05 This paper studies {{a dynamic}} model of <b>eco-product</b> planning, where an <b>eco-product</b> supplied {{by a single}} producer is differentiated from a conventional product generating negative externalities, and the production technology of the <b>eco-product</b> is characterized by learning-by-doing. The result states that the learning effect causes the <b>eco-product</b> to be more promoted and brings about more favorable outcomes on social welfare. This study also examines how the environmental regulation on the conventional product, associated with a price distortion, affects {{the promotion of the}} <b>eco-product,</b> consumer surplus, the single producer's profit, and negative externalities. It is shown that the impact of the environmental regulation {{is similar to that of}} a rise in the learning effect. Furthermore, whether or not the environmental regulation should be adopted is highly dependent on the degree of the learning effect. In the presence of a large learning potential, the environmental regulation may not only promote the <b>eco-product</b> effectively but also improve social welfare through intensifying the learning effect...|$|E
40|$|Designing {{environment-friendly}} products, {{known as}} eco-products, {{has become an}} essential practice in many manufacturers mainly due to increasing consumer awareness to the environment, governmental regulations and marketing strategies. Most of the scientific literature on <b>eco-product</b> design deals mainly with {{the improvement of the}} environmental performance. Engineers and <b>eco-product</b> designers need large quantities of information for evaluating environmental performance of eco-products. However, other considerations relate to the creation of eco-products should not be overlooked, such as product form aesthetics and functionality. This research moves beyond technical evaluations of environmental performance of eco-products by developing a new design decision support approach for evaluating the <b>eco-product</b> value (EPV) as perceived by consumers. To do so, this research develops a new approach using Kansei engineering, neural network (NN), and multiattribute decision making (MADM) methods in order for product designers to achieve optimal <b>eco-product</b> form design based on combinations of EPV attributes. An experimental study on office chairs is conducted to illustrate how the EPV evaluation model can be developed and used to evaluate the value of a given <b>eco-product.</b> The Kansei engineering method is used to translate consumers’ feeling of the office chair into product form elements, and help product designers understand consumers’ perception. Product samples are collected from 100 collected office chairs by using multidimensional scale and cluster analysis, by which 27 representative office chairs are chosen for the consumer-oriented experiments. Morphological analysis is used to extract 7 design elements as well as 20 types of form components. In addition, the value of eco-products is measured by three dimensions, characterised by aesthetic, functional, and environmental attributes, which are derived from both the literature and expert product designers. The aesthetic, functional and environmental dimensions consist of 7, 3 and 5 perceivable EPV attributes respectively. Each EPV attribute is assessed through a consumer-oriented experimental process. Results of Quantitative Theory Type I analysis have indicated the relative importance of office chair form elements to EPV attribute images. To enhance the applicability of this approach, NN models are applied for providing a mechanism to support the <b>eco-product</b> design decision making process by establishing a database of design alternatives. Then, MADM models are used to obtain the value of a given <b>eco-product</b> with weighted design attributes in an EPV evaluation model, which integrates both the consumer’s and designer’s viewpoints as a whole. The best design decision for a given design setting has a maximum weighted value among all design alternatives. In addition, the correlation between EPV attributes and <b>eco-product</b> form image is analysed by using Pearson correlation analysis to the product form image word pairs and EPV attributes. The result shows a weak non-linear relationship between EPV attributes and product form images. As such, <b>eco-product</b> designers can consider these two variables separately when designing eco-products. The value evaluation approach developed in this research is novel in that the target <b>eco-product</b> design parameter is the consumer perceived EPV which is measured in aesthetic, functional, and environmental dimensions. This is different from existing techniques for <b>eco-product</b> design and evaluation. The approach is verified through an application to office chair design for emphasising environmental perception. Specifically, office chair design sketches are developed based on the result of MADM analysis. The outcomes of this research have a great potential for solving practical EPV selection and ranking problems by applying the EPV attribute weights given by the product designers. Various experimental results can be used as insightful guidelines for selecting an <b>eco-product</b> from product form design element combination for a given EPV attribute...|$|E
40|$|In practice, {{there are}} various types of eco-{{innovation}}. While each type of innovation has its own attributes, determinants, and contribution to business performance, it is not effective to implement eco-innovation programs without a holistic view. This study draws from the resource-based view theory to investigate inter-relationships among three types of eco-innovation (process, product, organizational) and their relative impact on business performance. Using structural equation modeling with 121 samples collected from Taiwan Environmental Management Association, we find that eco-organizational innovation has the strongest effect on business performance. Additionally, eco-process and <b>eco-product</b> innovations partially mediate the effects of eco-organizational innovation, and <b>eco-product</b> innovation mediates eco-process innovations' effects on business performance. Business performance is directly and indirectly affected by eco-organizational, eco-process, and <b>eco-product</b> innovations. The findings suggest that, {{in order to develop}} effective eco-innovation programs, managers must understand the interdependence and co-evolutionary relationships between different types of eco-innovation.

40|$|Transferring product {{environmental}} information to consumer to promote <b>eco-product</b> {{in the market}} and to promote sustainable consumption is considered as an important challenge especially according to the Integrated Product Policy (IPP) and the eco-design directive for Energy Using Products (EUP). In this paper the three core areas of consumer analysis on eco-products are identified. In order to increase consumers’ attention and cognition on eco-products, the conceptual methods named Eco- Means End Chain (MEC) and Environmental Communication Checklist are proposed. The Eco-MEC helps to show differential and obvious benefits to consumers with environmental aspects of a product. It supports especially ecodesigners and marketers to transfer the {{environmental information}} to consumers so that it contributes to launch eco-products successfully on the market. On the other hand, the Environmental Communication Checklist helps producers and marketers to check and to prognose the environmental information whether it is payable and profitable transmission or not.

40|$|At present, {{in spite}} of its {{increasing}} diffusion in the industrial world, Ecodesign seems to be not successful from a marketing perspective, i. e. development of successful products.

The reuse of CSW as recycled aggregates or a cementitious binder for producing partition wall blocks, and the life cycle environmental impact of the blocks were assessed and compared with the conventional one designed with natural materials. The LCA results showed that the partition wall blocks prepared with fresh CSW and recycled concrete aggregates achieved higher sustainability as it consumed 59 % lower energy, emitted 66 % lower greenhouse gases, and produced lesser amount of other environmental impacts than that of the conventional one. When the mineral carbonation technology was further adopted for blocks curing using CO 2, the global warming potential of the corresponding blocks production process was negligible, and hence the carbonated blocks may be considered as carbon neutral <b>eco-product.</b> Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering 2016 - 2017 > Academic research: refereed > Publication in refereed journalbcr...|$|E

To test the role of nationality and personal values in eco-behaviour, a linear regression model involving 353 Chinese and 333 Italian subjects was performed. A stepwise analysis was then conducted to identify the main significant effects. The explorative and stepwise analyses confirmed that nationality is significant when explaining individual eco-behaviour, for both Italian and Chinese people. Moreover, the linear regression model, as a stepwise analysis, showed that regulatory focus and universalism are the main personal values influencing ecological behaviour.
