40|$|This paper studies how U. S. {{monetary}} policy affects global stock prices. We find that global stock prices respond strongly {{to changes in}} U. S. interest rate policy, with stock prices increasing (decreasing) following unexpected monetary loosening (tightening). This impact is more pronounced for sectors that depend on external financing, and for countries that are more integrated with the global financial market. These findings suggest that financial frictions {{play an important role}} in the transmission of {{monetary policy}}, and that U. S. monetary policy influences global capital allocation.

In this paper, district heating systems that are fed by geothermal energy, the so-called geothermal district heating systems, are studied. It is proposed to apply a {{hot water storage tank}} in these systems to store hot water in times of low-load and release it to the system during peak load periods in order to minimise the use of peak-up boilers. In this paper, two different models are presented and the results are shown for three different cases of heat demand coverage by geothermal energy. First, a model for the sizing of these systems is developed. The main findings highlight the importance of the insulation both for the storage tank and the pipelines of the network. Secondly, a model that studies the daily and the annual operation of the installation is developed followed by an integrated economic and environmental analysis of the proposed solution.

40|$|We {{estimate}} ex post {{returns to}} emerging market debt by combining secondary-market prices with observed flows based on World Bank data. From 1970 - 2000, returns averaged 9 percent per annum, {{about the same}} as returns on a ten-year U. S. treasury bond. This reflects the combined effect of the 1980 s debt crisis and much higher returns during 1989 - 2000. Annual returns since 1986 have been less volatile than emerging market equity returns but more volatile than returns on U. S. corporate or high-yield bonds. However, unlike returns on these bonds, emerging market debt returns do not seem significantly correlated with U. S. or world stock markets.

30|$|It is {{interesting}} to see the impact of financial development on the investment-cash flow sensitivity of group affiliated firms and standalone firms as {{it is expected that}} financial development, may reduce the financial constraint faced by the independent firms. The estimation results of the Q-model and Euler equation show that the regression coefficient in the interaction between financial development <b>index</b> and <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> is more for group affiliated firms than the stand alone firms. However, the effect of development in financial sector on the investment-cash flow sensitivity of the group affiliated firms is not statistically significant, but for standalone firms, it is statistically significant at 5 % level. This implies that standalone firms may have the better access to the external borrowings from the financial market due to the improvements in the financial market condition. Columns (3) and (4) of the TableÂ  12 shows the independent role of financial development on corporate investment in both models. Empirical results postulate that financial development is positively associated with corporate investment across the ownership style of the firms. All other variables have their sign as expected and are statistically significant. These results are consistent with findings of Fazzari et al. (1988), La Cava (2005), Carpenter and Guariglia (2008), Guariglia (2008) and Chen and Chen (2012). In this study, we find strong evidence that financial development affects the financial constraints faced by the firms. We also find that the investment-cash flow sensitivity of the small and independent firms are seem to be significantly influenced more by financial development than the larger and group affiliated firms.|$|R

The current study investigates the ability of accrual and <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> accounting data to predict future <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> of Thai listed companies. Three regression models are constructed namely earnings, <b>cash</b> <b>flows,</b> accrual components and <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> models. In addition, <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> ratios are investigated to predict future <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> by using a stepwise regression. Data used in this study is collected from the financial statements of non-financial companies listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand from 1994 to 2002. <b>Cash</b> <b>flow</b> data are selected directly from the <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> statements. The empirical results show that past earnings, <b>cash</b> <b>flows,</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> and accrual component of earnings can be used to predict future <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> of Thai listed companies and <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> have better predictive power than past earnings.

Analysis tools used in this study is a multiple linear regression analysis where the analysis used to determine the effect of variable X consists of Variable Operating <b>Cash</b> <b>Flow</b> Changes (X 1), change in Investment <b>Cash</b> <b>Flow</b> (X 2), and Financing <b>Cash</b> <b>Flow</b> Changes (X 3), the Stock Return (Y) in the BEI Manufacturing Company. Hypothesis testing using the F test to simultaneously test the dependent variable against independent variables, t tests to demonstrate the influence of partially dependent variables against independent variables Results of analysis showed that simultaneous changes in operating <b>cash</b> <b>flow,</b> investment <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> and financing <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> has a significant impact on stock returns. While In partial, changes in operating <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> have an effect on stock returns, while changes in investment <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> and financing <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> does not have an effect on stock retur...|$|R

40|$|The thesis investigates {{construction}} project <b>cash</b> <b>flows.</b> It {{is divided into}} two main components. The first investigates the cumulative gross <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> profiles (S curves), and the second examines the cumulative net <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> profiles. The gross <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> model can be used by either construction industry clients or contractors, whereas the net <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> model concerns the contractor. Interest in {{construction project}} <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> resulted from changed economic pressures in the 1970 s. A rise in inflation was associated with increased client attention to his gross <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> to the contractor, and similarly higher interest rates had the effect that contractors became concerned with their net <b>cash</b> <b>flows.</b> An examination of the gross <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> literature found that most models were aimed at discovering generally applicable ideal curves. A similar situation existed within the net <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> literature. It was argued that the averaging approach is unsuitable for construction project <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> research, and consequently an approach which concentrates on the individual project was pursued. A gross <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> model was developed using logistic transformation regression procedures. This yielded excellent results for post-hoc analysis of individual project data. Furthermore the gross <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> model was found to be suitable for the generation of a construction project net <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> model, which was similarly oriented towards the post-hoc analysis of single projects. A measure of deviation was used which enabled the identification of projects for which the gross <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> model was a poor fit. This same procedure was used to exclude projects from the net <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> analysis. The results from the gross <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> model analysis indicate that projects do vary considerably from one to another, and this supports the contention made that an individual approach to this research is necessary. The net <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> model yields an excellent trend line for net <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> on a project, and thus provides an excellent means for senior management to judge the quality of management employed on a projectRestricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|R
50|$|Time {{value of}} money {{dictates}} that time affects {{the value of}} <b>cash</b> <b>flows.</b> In other words, a lender may give you 99 cents for the promise of receiving $1.00 a month from now, but the promise to receive that same dollar 20 {{years in the future}} would be worth much less today to that same person (lender), even if the payback in both cases was equally certain. This decrease in the current value of future <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> is based on the market dictated rate of return. More technically, <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> of nominal equal value over a time series result in different effective value <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> that make future <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> less valuable over time. If for example there exists a time series of identical <b>cash</b> <b>flows,</b> the <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> in the present is the most valuable, with each future <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> becoming less valuable than the previous <b>cash</b> <b>flow.</b> A <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> today is more valuable than an identical <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> in the future because a present flow can be invested immediately and begin earning returns, while a future flow cannot.|$|R

Since we include signed operating <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> in our investigation of the correlation between operating <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> and total accruals and TableÂ  6 shows significant differences for signed operating <b>cash</b> <b>flows,</b> we adapt Eq.Â (9) and use signed operating <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> instead of absolute operating <b>cash</b> <b>flow.</b>|$|R
