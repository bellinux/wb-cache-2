[...] "I went to a mate's house to watch the FA Cup Final, everyone {{in the house was}} supporting the other team except the guy <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> to. He was English, and I told him I was with him 100 per cent. Spurs won and I've supported them ever since." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{involvement}} of Arca came in late {{stages of the}} writing process, which Björk described as [...] "such a contrast, the most fun music-making I've ever had, with the most tragic subject matter ... <b>I</b> just <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> to Arca for weeks, and we did the whole album. It's the quickest I've ever worked ... It's one of those crazy things in life where people from opposite ends meet, and you've got so much to teach each other." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Jimmy, [...] "there's a big lump there didn't use {{to be on}} {{the side}} of my head, too, and it was the concernedest hardest kind of rock <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down upon. <b>Next</b> time you try to blow {{yourself}} up, I'm not going after you." ...|$|R
5000|$|While {{appearing}} in a one-man play, {{he met his}} ex-wife. They met in the audience {{before the start of}} the play because Hadlow always started off in the audience. In his wife's words, [...] "this nice man who <b>I</b> didn't recognise <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> to me and we started chatting. Within minutes he knew a lot about me. Suddenly he got up and started acting in the play." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And there's {{the place}} kept vacant next to Miss Mountjoy. Grascour {{wanted to sit}} there, but her ladyship wouldn't let him. And <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> Miss Abbott because I didn't {{want to be in}} your way." ...|$|E
60|$|VALENTINE (with growing impetuosity). Yes: I. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> to her; and I {{never said}} a single thing to her the whole time---couldn't think of a blessed word. And not a word did she say to me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite possible; and I {{am afraid}} the sister is just such another. She seems quite {{to belong to}} Mrs. Duncombe's set. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> her at dinner, and {{tried to talk to}} her, but she would only listen to that young Strangeways." ...|$|E
6000|$|Inside the settle all a-row - [...] All four a-row We <b>sat,</b> <b>I</b> <b>next</b> to John, to show [...] That he had wooed and won. And {{then he took}} me on his knee, And swore it was {{his turn}} to be My favoured mate, and Mother Lee [...] Passed to my former one.|$|R
40|$|For 45 {{minutes the}} woman {{discussed}} her husband 2 ̆ 7 s distress {{and her own}} feelings of inadequacy as she struggled in vain {{to find ways to}} help him. I listened closely and suggested she contact a good counselor in her hometown - one familiar with alcohol use - to work with both of them. The conversation wouldn 2 ̆ 7 t have been particularly remarkable, except that she and I had just {{met for the first time}} on a brief airplane flight. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>next</b> to her, said How 2 ̆ 7 s life? and she told me. In great detail...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What {{with this}} person not being at home, and that person being {{expected}} home in the afternoon, and so forth, the inquiry took me three days. On {{the evening of the}} third day, coming over Waterloo Bridge from the Surrey side of the river, quite beat, and very much vexed and disappointed, I thought I'd have a shilling's worth of entertainment at the Lyceum Theatre to freshen myself up. So I went into the Pit, at half-price, and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> myself down <b>next</b> to a very quiet, modest sort of young man. Seeing I was a stranger (which I thought it just as well to appear to be) he told me the names of the actors on the stage, and we got into conversation. When the play was over, we came out together, and I said, [...] "We've been very companionable and agreeable, and perhaps you wouldn't object to a drain?" [...] "Well, you're very good," [...] says he; [...] "I SHOULDN'T object to a drain." [...] Accordingly, we went to a public- house, near the Theatre, sat ourselves down in a quiet room up- stairs on the first floor, and called for a pint of half-and-half, apiece, and a pipe.|$|R
60|$|Philip {{called on}} us again to-day. He {{brought with him}} tickets for the {{performance}} of an Oratorio. Sacred music is not forbidden music among our people. Mrs. Staveley and Miss Staveley went to the concert with us. Philip and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> to each other.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, you dog, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> to her; sat in {{the middle}} the whole way, and my back's half broke, I can tell you:" [...] and thus, having {{depicted}} his happiness, we soon reached the inn where this back-broken young man was to lodge during his stay in Paris.|$|E
60|$|I {{remember}} the indignation {{of an old}} Bus-conductor, once. Inside we were nine women and two men. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> the door, and his remarks therefore he addressed to me. It was certainly taking him some time to collect the fares, but I {{think he would have}} got on better had he been less bustling; he worried them, and made them nervous.|$|E
40|$|I {{walked into}} a room with its lights glaring and {{television}} blaring, a room where a man I had never met before would take his final breath two hours later. The attending nurse kindly dimmed the lights {{and turned off the}} television. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>next</b> to him. I felt panic. I felt sadness, and I felt peace. This individual would have passed without me knowing, yet I was there with him; he wouldn’t be alone. The No One Dies Alone (NODA) chapter at Jefferson launched in May, 2016. It launched as a vision in which students of Thomas Jefferson University would volunteer their time to offer their compassionate companionship to dying individuals who would otherwise be alone. Our chapter’s mission originated in Eugene, Oregon back in 2001 after a nurse, Sandra Clarke, CCRN, was unable to offer her dying patient the companionship he had requested and she felt he deserved. She fought vigilantly for her vision, and now over 300 programs exist nationwide with Sandra’s vision at their core; Jefferson is proudly home to one more – the only student volunteer chapter about which we are aware. Jefferson’s highly interprofessional and supportive community allowed for students to oversee NODA’s growth, development, and success. As student volunteers, we come together from all professions to offer compassionate care to individuals in need. Our service offers respite to our hard-working nurses who want to see their patients receive the best care possible, and to the families who cannot be present. While our primary goal is offering our supportive presence to those who are dying who would otherwise be alone, our program is truly special, and our service extends far beyond any mission statement ever could...|$|R

60|$|My {{sister was}} in her {{cushioned}} chair in her corner, and Biddy sat at her needle-work before the fire, and Joe sat next Biddy, and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> Joe in the corner opposite my sister. The more I looked into the glowing coals, the more incapable I became of looking at Joe; the longer the silence lasted, the more unable I felt to speak.|$|E
60|$|I don't {{remember}} who was there, except Dora. I have {{not the least}} idea what we had for dinner, besides Dora. My impression is, that I dined off Dora, entirely, and sent away half-a-dozen plates untouched. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> to her. I talked to her. She had the most delightful little voice, the gayest little laugh, the pleasantest and most fascinating little ways, that ever led a lost youth into hopeless slavery. She was rather diminutive altogether. So much the more precious, I thought.|$|E
6000|$|... "You seemed {{different}} from the other women I had known--of my generation, at least," [...] he went on steadily. [...] "None of them could have spoken as you did. I had just landed that morning, and I should have gone direct to Grenoble, but there was some necessary business to be attended to in New York. I didn't want to go to Bessie's dinner, but she insisted. She was short of a man. I went. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> to you, and you interpreted my mind. It seemed too extraordinary not to have had a significance." ...|$|E

60|$|It so {{happened}} that <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> to Mr. Allan Quatermain at dinner, and, of course, {{did my best}} to draw him; but he was not to be drawn. He admitted that he had recently been a long journey into the interior of Africa with Sir Henry Curtis and Captain Good, and that they had found treasure, and then politely turned the subject and began to ask me questions about England, where he had never been before--that is, since he came to years of discretion. Of course, I did not find this very interesting, and so cast about for some means to bring the conversation round again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, father knows--or ought to--that <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> him, in London, a month ago, at dinner, {{and that}} he then {{told me he was}} working, tooth and nail, at what he called the {{wonderful}} modern science of Connoisseurship--which is upsetting, as perhaps you're not aware, all the old-fashioned canons of art-criticism, everything we've stupidly thought right and held dear; that he was to spend Easter in these parts, {{and that he}} should like greatly to be allowed some day to come over and make acquaintance with our things. I told him," [...] Lady Grace wound up, [...] "that nothing would be easier; a note from him arrived before dinner----" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Taylor is {{reckoned}} {{a brilliant}} conversationist; but I suppose he requires somebody to draw {{him out and}} assist him; for I could hear nothing that I thought very remarkable on this occasion. He is not a kind of man whom I can talk with, or greatly help to talk; so, though <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> to him, nothing came of it. He told me some stories {{of his life in}} the Temple,--little funny incidents, that he afterwards wrought into his dramas; in short, a sensible, active-minded, clearly perceptive man, with a humorous way of showing up men and matters. [...] . I wish I could know exactly what the English style good conversation. Probably it is something like plum-pudding,--as heavy, but seldom so rich.|$|E

60|$|He slid {{through the}} bushes and disappeared. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> where <b>I</b> was, musing, my work interrupted, a mood of bitter disillusionment heavy upon me. So <b>I</b> <b>sat,</b> {{it may have been}} for hours.|$|R
6000|$|On {{the journey}} <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> to an {{exceptionally}} large and heavy man, {{who in his}} sleep--and he slept often--imagined {{me to be a}} piece of stuffing out of place. Then, grunting and wriggling, he would endeavour to rub me out, until the continued irritation of my head between the window and his back would cause him to awake, when he would look down upon me reprovingly but not unkindly, observing to the carriage generally: [...] "It's a funny thing, ain't it, nobody's ever made a boy yet that could keep still for ten seconds." [...] After which he would pat me heartily on the head, to show he was not vexed with me, and fall to sleep again upon me. He was a good-tempered man.|$|E
60|$|April 24th.--On Saturday I {{was present}} at a dejeuner on board the Donald McKay; the {{principal}} guest being Mr. Layard, M. P. There were several hundred people, quite filling the between decks of the ship, which was converted into a saloon for the occasion. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> to Mr. Layard, {{at the head of}} the table, and so had a good opportunity of seeing and getting acquainted with him. He is a man in early middle age,--of middle stature, with an open, frank, intelligent, kindly face. His forehead is not expansive, but is prominent in the perceptive regions, and retreats a good deal. His mouth is full,--I liked him from the first. He was very kind and complimentary to me, and made me promise to go and see him in London.|$|E
6000|$|He came {{to dinner}} to-day. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> to him. How {{beautiful}} a dress-coat is, {{and a white}} cravat! We talked. He {{wanted to know what}} my Christian name was. I was so pleased when I found {{he was one of the}} few people who like it. His hair curls naturally. In color, it is something between my hair and Helena's. He wears his beard. How manly! It curls naturally, like his hair; it smells deliciously of some perfume which is new to me. He has white hands; his nails look as if he polished them; I should like to polish my nails if I knew how. Whatever I said, he agreed with me; I felt satisfied with my own conversation, for the first time in my life. Helena won't find me a simpleton when I go home. What exquisite things dinner-parties are! ...|$|E
