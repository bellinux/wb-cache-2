Each of the 350 rooms was furnished and decorated in a distinctive style. A special feature of each was an <b>electric</b> <b>indicator</b> by which a guest, without waiting for a bell-boy, could signal direct to the office for any of 140 various articles. This indicator, known as the Herzog Teleseme, was one of the conveniences of Holland House, serving as a signalling system. It consisted of a dial sunk into the wall, and connected by electricity with the office; upon this dial were printed 140 articles at times needed by travellers, and the guest moved the pointer until it pointed at the desired object, and then pressed an electric button, whereupon the clerk in the office sent up the desired newspaper, or bottle, or food, or any other needed thing. The rooms had brass bedsteads, red-birch woodwork, Wilton carpets, and modern furniture. Holland House was fire-proof, and contained sanitary plumbing. Its walls and floor-arches were of porous terra cotta, a nonconductor of heat, cold or noise. The heating pipes are encased in asbestos.|$|E

The effect of friction on the motion of the pointer while taking motoring and power cards was eliminated by providing a means of putting pressure lines on the record. The modified indicator gives a complete record of the average cyclic variation in pressure per crank degree for any set of engine operating conditions which can be held constant for the period of time required to build up the composite card. The value of the record for accurate quantitative measurement is still questioned, although the maximum indicated pressure recorded on the motoring and power cards checks the readings of the balanced diaphragm type of maximum cylinder pressure indicator...|$|E

These tests were made on a precombustion chamber type of cylinder head designed to have air velocity and tangential air flow in both the chamber and cylinder.

The pressure variations between the pear-shaped precombustion chamber and the cylinder for motoring and full load conditions were determined with a Farnboro <b>electric</b> <b>indicator.</b> The combustion chamber designs tested gave good mixing of a single compact fuel spray with the air, but did not control the ensuing combustion sufficiently.

40|$|The observer-dependent tidal effects {{associated}} with the electric and magnetic parts of the Riemann tensor with respect to an arbitrary family of observers are discussed in a general spacetime in terms of certain "tidal indicators. " The features of such indicators are then explored by specializing our considerations {{to the family of}} stationary circularly rotating observers in the equatorial plane of the Kerr spacetime. There exist a number of observer families which are special for several reasons and for each of them such indicators are evaluated. The transformation laws of tidal indicators when passing from one observer to another are also discussed, clarifying the interplay among them. Our analysis shows that no equatorial plane circularly rotating observer in the Kerr spacetime can ever measure a vanishing tidal <b>electric</b> <b>indicator,</b> whereas the family of Carter's observers measures zero tidal magnetic indicator.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a novel set of electric motor degradation cost functions based on energy usage, energy loss and work output, against their continuous operation rated values {{recommended by the}} manufacturer. Unlike conventional <b>electric</b> motor degradation <b>indicators</b> such as the bearing life and insulation life based service factors, these cost functions account for the quantified time in the degradation process. The cost functions are evaluated throughout the operational life of the motor using real-time measurements. Hence, they give a very accurate indication, which may be adapted for online controller tuning. This solid establishment of a degradation cost function also enables the system designer to give the user a choice between performance and degradation minimization. The proposed cost function scheme has experimentally been verified using a hardware-in-the-loop electric powertrain test-rig where standard drive cycles are used to conduct the experiments. The experimental results reveal that the degradation cost functions Cumulative Input Energy Ratio (CIER), Cumulative Loss Ratio (CLR) and Cumulative Work Ratio (CWR) accurately represent the electric motor degradation both qualitatively and quantitatively...|$|R

The change of the load, i. e. the level of energy consumption, should cause a corresponding change {{in the level of}} generated energy. It means that the power system should be a balance of produced and consumed energy, taking into account technological cost of conversion, transmission and distribution. Otherwise, <b>electric</b> power quality <b>indicators</b> will be violated. For example, at infringement of balance of active power the frequency in the grid will have a value different from 50 Hz. One of the automatic devices on the lowest rung in the hierarchy of automatic dispatcher control system of frequency and power interchange is the system of automatic control of power units (SACPU). It is a comprehensive and complex device, which consists of several connected together simpler systems, governing all thermal power devices of a power unit. SACPU ought to regulate the active power of the unit and participate in primary frequency regulation in the network with a given accuracy and sensitivity; also, it ought to be adequately fast.

40|$|Introduction. The {{moral and}} {{physical}} deterioration of medium voltage power cables with phase and zone paper-impregnated insulation requires implementation of quality systems and reliable nondestructive <b>electric</b> diagnostic. Informative <b>indicator</b> of the insulation {{is the time}} decay curve of the charging current. It reflects the processes of accumulation of space charges (absorption). The measurements are carried out the 15 th since the second direct voltage supply, then – on the 30 th and the second on the 60 th second. The ratio of the parameters measured in these times gives the dimensionless criteria – absorption coefficients. Three measurements are made at different times, provide a more complete picture {{of the state of}} insulation than the measurement of the value of steady leakage (conduction-through), adopted in conventional prevention trials. Purpose. Research and testing methods of diagnostics of power cables with paper-impregnated insulation by absorption and phase characteristics of the belt insulation based on the total measurements. Methodology. A procedure for determining the individual characteristics of phase and zone paper-impregnated insulation based realized {{on the use of the}} equivalent circuit of a three-core cable in the metal shell and solved of an over determined system of linear algebraic equations by least squares. Results. The proposed method allows determining the absorption characteristics of the individual phase and zone insulation medium voltage power cables in the overall metal shell at a direct voltage. Individual characteristics reflect the characteristics of cables and allow a greater degree to assess the degree of aging of each of the components of paper-impregnated insulation. Originality. Regardless of the cable connection diagrams probing electric field grabs as the phase, and zone insulation. The cumulative nature of the measurement leads to the fact that the differences in the properties of insulation components are smoothed: the aggregate results of the measurements do not differ for the different schemes of the same type. The individual characteristics of isolation, defined on the basis of the proposed method are more differences than total, indicating that non-symmetrical modes of operation of the cable. Practical value. The values of individual characteristics power cables 6 kV are 3 times more total, because of what their direct measurement may be a problem. The total resistance of several insulation spaces connected in parallel, behind the individual. Smaller values of insulation resistance are measured more easily, especially on short samples cables...|$|R
