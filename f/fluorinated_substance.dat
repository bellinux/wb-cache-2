40|$|The {{selective}} {{introduction of}} fluorine onto {{the skeleton of}} an aminocyclopentane or cyclohexane carboxylate has been developed through a novel and efficient fluoride opening of an activated aziridine ring with XtalFluor-E. The reaction proceeded through a stereoselective aziridination of the olefinic bond of a bicyclic lactam and regioselective aziridine ring opening with difluorosulfiliminium tetrafluoroborate with the neighboring group assistance of the sulfonamide moiety to yield fluorinated diamino acid derivatives. The method based on the selective aziridine opening by fluoride has been generalized to afford access to mono- or bicyclic <b>fluorinated</b> <b>substance...</b>|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2005 <b>Fluorinated</b> alkyl <b>substances,</b> {{which can}} be persistent, toxic, and bioaccumulative, have been quantitated in many densely {{populated}} and remote regions, including in air, surface waters, groundwater, and biota; however, {{little is known about}} their transport or behavior in the environment. Wastewater effluent is one of the principal routes for introducing environmental contaminants into aquatic environments. The partitioning behavior of <b>fluorinated</b> alkyl <b>substances</b> between aqueous and particulate phases is not well characterized; thus, sorption onto sludge can be a removal mechanism of <b>fluorinated</b> alkyl <b>substances</b> from the wastewater stream. This is another route into the environment if the biosolids are land-applied. In an attempt to analyze for the <b>fluorinated</b> alkyl <b>substances</b> in wastewater, known aqueous-film-forming-foam (AFFF) -laden groundwater sampled from 3 military bases was used to develop an assay using liquid chromatography (LC), electrospray ionization (ESI) tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). While working on the method development, fluorotelomer sulfonates were detected at Wurtsmith AFB, MI, and Tyndall AFB, FL, where total fluoroatkyl sulfonates ranged respectively from below quantitation (≤ 0. 60 μg/L) to 182 μg/L and from 1100 μg/L to 14, 600 μg/L. The LC ESI-MS/MS method was modified to quantitate fluorinated alkyl sulfonates in wastewater by incorporating a htgh volume sample loop (500 μL), which lowered detection and quantitation limits by at least a factor of 50. This method was applied to 24 h composites of influents and effluents collected from treatment plants distributed nationwide. <b>Fluorinated</b> alkyl <b>substances</b> were observed at all 10 plants sampled, and each wastewater treatment plant was found to have a unique distribution of <b>fluorinated</b> alkyl <b>substances,</b> despite similar treatment processes. In 9 out of the 10 plants sampled, at least one class of <b>fluorinated</b> alkyl <b>substance</b> exhibited significant increases in the effluent as compared to the influent levels. The high-volume-injection LC ESI-MS/MS method was also used to monitor the mass flows of perfluoroalkyl sulfonates and carboxylates through a municipal wastewater treatment plant for 10 d. The perfluoroalkyl carboxylates were overall removed by the wastewater treatment process (25 - 40...|$|R
40|$|The {{accuracy}} of thermodynamic {{models in the}} computation of nonclassical gasdynamic phenomena is discussed, to investigate their suitability {{in connection with the}} design of experimental apparatuses aimed at the observation of nonclassical wavefields. The Soave–Redlich–Kwong and the Peng–Robinson are preliminarily suggested as alternative thermodynamic models to the Martin–Hou usually considered in nonclassical gasdynamics of <b>fluorinated</b> <b>substances.</b> The validity of these models is assessed by comparisons to reference experimental data for fluorinated R 13, R 125, C 318, FC- 72, FC- 75, and SF 6 and to the Martin–Hou model itself. The three models are found to exhibit a comparable accuracy for reduced volumes ranging from 1. 4 to 2. 5 and near the critical isotherm, i. e., in the thermodynamic region where heavier <b>fluorinated</b> <b>substances</b> such as PP 10 are expected to exhibit nonclassical gasdynamic phenomena. The Soave–Redlich–Kwong and the Peng–Robinson models are then used to supplement previous numerical results for a three-discontinuity nonclassical shock-tube experiment with fluid PP 10, which was designed under the Martin–Hou model. Under the initial conditions chosen for the experiment, the three models agree in predicting the formation of a supersonic nonclassical rarefaction wave, with wave Mach number in the range 1. 01 – 1. 02, thus providing further confidence on the possibility of experimentally observing nonclassical gasdynamic behavior in fluid PP 10...|$|R

40|$|This article {{reports a}} {{combined}} thermodynamic, spectroscopic, and computational {{study on the}} interactions and structure of binary mixtures of hydrogenated and <b>fluorinated</b> <b>substances</b> that simultaneously interact through strong hydrogen bonding. Four binary mixtures of hydrogenated and fluorinated alcohols have been studied, namely, (ethanol + 2, 2, 2 -trifluoroethanol (TFE)), (ethanol + 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4 -heptafluoro- 1 -butanol), (1 -butanol (BuOH) + TFE), and (BuOH + 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4 -heptafluoro- 1 -butanol). Excess molar volumes and vibrational spectra of all four binary mixtures have been measured {{as a function of}} composition at 298 K, and molecular dynamics simulations have been performed. The systems display a complex behavior when compared with mixtures of hydrogenated alcohols and mixtures of alkanes and perfluoroalkanes. The combined analysis of the results from different approaches indicates that this results from a balance between preferential hydrogen bonding between the hydrogenated and fluorinated alcohols and the unfavorable dispersion forces between the hydrogenated and fluorinated chains. As the chain length increases, the contribution of dispersion increases and overcomes the contribution of H-bonds. In terms of the liquid structure, the simulations suggest the possibility of segregation between the hydrogenated and fluorinated segments, a hypothesis corroborated by the spectroscopic results. Furthermore, a quantitative analysis of the infrared spectra reveals that the presence of fluorinated groups induces conformational changes in the hydrogenated chains from the usually preferred all-trans to more globular arrangements involving gauche conformations. Conformational rearrangements at the CCOH dihedral angle upon mixing are also disclosed by the spectra...|$|R
40|$|The {{rescue service}} in Luleå took an {{initiative}} in 2014 and completed a try-out with CAF-system and A-foam against a liquid fire of kerosene. The {{use of the}} CAF system against liquid fires is in great interest because increased use of A-foam could lower the use of film-forming foams that contain harmful <b>fluorinated</b> <b>substances.</b> This would lead to positive effects on the environment. The try-out in 2014 was successful and indicated that CAF-system with A-foam was a good extinguisher. Luleå rescue service began planning more large-scale try-outs, this time against gasoline fires and this study {{is part of that}} project. The aim of this study has been {{to get an idea of}} the extinguishing capacity of CAF-system and A-Foam. A literature search showed that no tests similar to those envisaged in this project were documented. The empirical study consisted of 12 small- and 2 large-scale experiments. The liquid that were used in the experiment were gasoline. The small-scale experiment followed the SP-Method 2580 and the large-scale experiment where conducted in a 60 m 2 large pit. A summary of the small-scale experiment shows that no control over the fire was obtained when the foam was applied by a direct deposition technique. The foam strikes in to the fuel too hard and the blanket of foam broke down faster than new foam was applied. It required a soft deposition technique to control the fire at the small-scale experiment. The first large-scale experiment failed when no correct foam quality was obtained during the try-out. The second try-out started with the use of a traditionally CAF nozzle, which produces wet heavy foam, and no control of the fire was obtained. The foam equipment had to be changed to a medium expansion nozzle before the fire could be controlled. With the medium expansion nozzle the fire was extinguished in about 5 minutes. More expanded foam, which results in smoother application, was needed to control the fire at the large-scale experiment. The application technique is important when extinguishing fires with CAF-system and A-foam. During both the small-scale experiment as well as the large-scale experiment re-ignition attempts were conducted. These re-ignition attempts indicated that A-foam has poor fire resistance. The foam blanket quickly broke down and the fire developed to full power again shortly after being exposed to an open flame. The conclusion of the study is that a CAF system and A-foam is capable of extinguish a petrol fire of about 60 m 2 with a medium expansion nozzle and an application rate of about 2. 8 l / (m 2 ∙ min).

40|$|Grease proof {{packaging}} and other food contact materials (FCM) {{have been reported}} to contain fluorine-based organic coatings. As proofed by Begley et al. these <b>fluorinated</b> <b>substances</b> or their degradation products may migrate from such materials into food items and may become a source of per- and polyfluorinated compounds (PFAS) in humans. In previous studies we investigated FCM with analytical screening methods for the presence of fluorine coatings. Furthermore, fluorine positive samples were analyzed for FTOH, perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCA) and sulfonates (PFSA). The results showed significantly higher levels of FTOH compared to PFCA. PFSA were not found in any sample at levels above 1 ng/g. In this study we explored the migration of PFCA and FTOH from FCM. The selection of FCM was performed with respect to the use pattern of typically fluorine-containing FCM. Four application profiles were distinguished: a) long-term packaging at fridge temperatures b) long-term packaging at ambient temperatures c) short-term packaging at elevated temperatures (~ 80 °C) d) baking applications (short-term contact at high temperatures). Real food items and food simulants were applied, including polar and non-polar solvents as well as Tenax®. For each group of FCM a set of migration test conditions was investigated, whereat contact time, contact temperature and food items varied in a reasonable range. Before and after the migration contact, FCM, food items and food simulants were extracted and analyzed for PFSA, PFCA and FTOH by LC-ESI-MS/MS or GC-CI-MS. Highmolecular fluorinated compounds originally used for coating were not analyzed due to the absence of certified standards. Results of FCM were expressed in ng/dm² FCM. Levels identified in food (simulants) were reported in terms of ng/dm² of FCM, these food items were exposed to. This approach bases on the assumption that all PFAS found in food origin the investigated FCM. Levels of PFOA in investigated food items increased only slightly after the migration contact. This indicates at rather low migration rates. In contrast, FTOH levels increased significantly after the migration contact. Migration values from butter wraps into butter accounted for 10 to 200 ng/dm². This is significantly lower than the migration potential of the butter wrap (> 1000 ng/dm²) and indicates at rather low migration rates. However, migration of FTOH increased with increasing temperatures and durations of the migration experiments. At baking temperatures, migration values exceeded the migration potential, i. e. the total amount present in the original packaging, by far. This clearly indicates at a release of FTOH from high molecular mother compounds. Such an effect was not detected when the same baking paper was heated to 150 °C for 1 h in absence of any food items, suggesting degradation in the food matrix after a migration of mother compounds from FCM into the food...|$|R
40|$|The {{significance}} of the tricarboxylic acid ycle to the intact mammalian or-ganism {{is not easy to}} assess. In a review of the pharmacologic action of mono-fluoroacetate and related compounds, Chenoweth (1949) concluded from the evidence then available that inhibition of this cycle by fluoroacetate was not a primary cause of the symptoms of poisoning. That fluoroacetate does affect the tricarboxylic acid cycle was suggested by Kalnitsky (1948) and Kalnitsky and Barron (1948) who showed the impairment of citrate utilization by fluoroacetate in several in vitro studies. Li#{ 233 }becq and Peters (1948, 1949) and Martius (1949) added further confirmatory evidence and suggested that fluoroacetate is converted to a <b>fluorinated</b> metabolic inter-mediate <b>substance</b> which impedes the “cycle”, causing the in vitro accumulation of citrate, after absolving fluoride ion per se as an immediate cause of the phe-nornenon of citrate accumulation. Then Elliott and Kalnitsky (1950) offered presumptive evidence for the existence of a “fluorocitrate ” which they con-sidered to be the active metabolic inhibitor.

40|$|The overall {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} the economic value and use of geological information. Earthobservations of a geological nature, may have profound impacts on peoples everyday lives. Geological informationplays {{a key role in}} addressing the challenges of sustainable development, and contributes to improved decisionmakingprocesses related to, for instance, land degradation and water protection. Still, few have researched theeconomic values attached to such information. This thesis contains an introduction and five self-contained papers. Paper (I) provides a review of previous research addressing the economic value of geological information andother earth observations, as well as, related products, services and infrastructure. The paper also identifiesimportant lessons and topics that require increased attention in future research. The review of prior research showsthat significant economic benefits can be attached to the use of geological information. Still, it is often difficult tocompare results across studies since they differ in scope and make alternative assumptions concerning whichsectors to cover. Furthermore, previous research is not uniform in its treatment of potential (rather than onlyexisting) users, and it employs varying conceptions of avoided costs. The paper concludes that future researchshould devote more attention to the public and experience good characteristics of geological information and othertypes of earth observations, thus highlighting the preconditions for information adoption as well as addressing therole of potential users. Papers (II) and (III) investigate the determinants of adopting geological information in the public sector, with anemphasis on Swedish municipalities. Paper (II) contributes to the literature by providing theoretical explanationsand empirical findings on various individual and organizational factors influencing the adoption of geologicalinformation. The paper employs an information adoption model based on literature on diffusion of innovation. Itis estimated using data collected from 677 officials in all Swedish municipalities. The results indicate thatperceived usefulness and educational efforts have the largest influence on the adoption decision followed by agender effect. Furthermore, the results also show that organizational effects exist at the working unit level, butthere appear to be no spatial interactions across municipal boundaries. Paper (III) further investigates the adoption of geological information in the public sector by considering whetheranalyses of user patterns can be improved by considering an interrelated model estimation involving two types ofgeoinformation. The empirical tests focus on whether there are gender differences in how peer advice affects theuse of geoinformation. The information adoption model is estimated using probit and bivariate probits. Overall theresults indicate a more accurate prediction pattern when a secondary geoinformation decision was included, thussuggesting that different types of geoinformation should be analyzed jointly. The officials at Swedishmunicipalities tend to use both types of geoinformation, thus alluding to a demand for combined geoinformationproducts among the target population. Finally, there is evidence of women’s decisions to use geoinformation beingaffected by peer advice. Paper (IV) focuses on the economic value of hydrogeological information, namely water quality. The willingnessto pay (WTP) for reduced health risks following the exposure to emerging contaminants and microbial outbreaksin drinking water is assessed. Emerging contaminants, such as highly <b>fluorinated</b> <b>substances</b> (e [...] g., PFOA andPFOS), have been found in drinking water post treatment on a global level. The drinking water is the main sourceof exposure for humans. The WTP is assessed through a choice experiment approach, which also accounts fordifferences in perceptions between PFASs and microbial outbreaks due to parasites or bacteria. Knowledge aboutpublic preferences across different health threats is key to assessing support for policies aimed at reducing suchhealth risks. A majority of the respondents were found to have a higher WTP for reducing the risk of chemicalexposure to PFASs than reducing the corresponding risk of microbial outbreaks. In Paper (IV) it is evident that risk adverse individuals have a higher WTP for reducing health risks of drinkingwater, compared with individuals with other risk preferences. However, there is no consensus in the literature onhow to accurately capture risk preferences beyond financial decisions. Paper (V) therefore discusses thetheoretical assumptions used when measuring risk preferences and whether it is necessary to address domain riskspecific preferences. In order to test if a general risk preference is enough we present a hypothetical experimenton risk preferences for the health and financial domains, respectively. We also consider the design of theexperiment and compare the format with a reduced form to control for potential framing effects. The riskpreferences were elicited using switch multiple price list lotteries with hypothetical payments, and the questionswere adapted to the health domain by framing the lotteries as improvements in current health status using a visualanalogue scale as the reference point. The results show that individual risk preferences tend to be relativelyinconsistent across the two studied domains, and that the respondents appear to be more risk averse in the healthdomain than in the financial. The majority of the respondents tend to give too much weight to low-probabilityevents, which is consistent with cumulative prospect theory...|$|R

M. Filipea* aCentro de Química Estrutural, Instituto Superior Técnico, 1049 - 001 Lisboa, Portugal bCentro de Química de Évora, Universidade de Évora, 7000 - 671 Évora, Portugal <b>Fluorinated</b> alcohols are <b>substances</b> with unique properties and high technological value in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries. Trifluoroethanol (TFE), in particular, displays a number of unusual properties as a solvent. For example, it dissolves nylon at room temperature and is effectively used as solvent in bioengineering. The presence of the three fluorines atoms gives the alcohol a high ionization constant, strong hydrogen bonding capability and stability at high temperatures. 	In the pharmaceutical industry, TFE finds use as the major raw material {{for the production of}} inhalation anesthetics. Mixtures of TFE and water (known as Fluorinols®) are used as working fluids for Rankine cycle heat engines for terrestrial and space applications, {{as a result of a}} unique combination of physical and thermodynamic properties such as high thermal efficiency and excellent turbine expansion characteristics. 	Environmentally, TFE is a CFC substitute with an acceptable short lifetime and with small ozone depletion potential. Additionally, TFE is known to induce conformational changes in proteins and it is used as a co-solvent to analyze structural features of partially folded states. 	The (ethanol + TFE) system displays an interesting and peculiar behaviour, combining a negative azeotrope with high positive excess volumes. 	In this work, liquid mixtures of (ethanol + TFE) were investigated. The densities of the mixtures were measured as a function of composition between 278 K and 338 K and at pressures up to 700 bar. The corresponding excess volumes as a function of temperature and pressure, the isothermal compressibilities and thermal expansivities were calculated from the experimental results. The mixtures are highly non-ideal with excess volumes ranging from 0. 8 - 1. 0 cm 3 mol- 1. Finally, molecular dynamic simulations were performed to model and interpret the experimental results. The Trappe force field was used to simulate the (TFE + ethanol) mixtures and calculate the corresponding excess volumes. The simulation results are able to reproduce the correct sign and order of magnitude of the experimental VE without fitting to the experimental data. Furthermore, the simulations suggest the presence of a particular type of hydrogen bridge between ethanol and TFE, that can help to rationalize the experimental results...|$|R
