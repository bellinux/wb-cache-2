40|$|Since 1995, online auctions for {{antiques}} and collectibles have gained popularity, allowing collectors and dealers to interact {{directly on the}} Internet, slowly becoming the <b>global</b> <b>village's</b> flea market.

Dealers perform the role of subject experts in identifying and assessing antiques, and of information specialists in titling, describing and classifying them for access by collectors. Collectors need to browse and search large and often chaotic databases effectively. Popular concern has focused mainly on issues of trust- preventing fraud and manipulation and enforcing contracts. Economists have made extensive use of the large amount of data freely available on Internet auction sites for testing economic models. However they typically disregard the inherent information retrieval aspects, assuming tacitly that they do not effect the auction mechanism. To challenge this assumption, some simple methods were used for testing the schemes used for knowledge organization by the German eBay auction site. The high levels o...|$|R
