5|$|Some {{processes}} {{convert a}} meat or <b>dairy</b> <b>product</b> into a pareve (neither meat nor dairy) one. For example, rennet is sometimes made from stomach linings, yet is acceptable for making kosher cheese, but such cheeses {{might not be}} acceptable to some vegetarians, who would eat only cheese made from a vegetarian rennet. The same applies to kosher gelatin, an animal product, derived from kosher animal sources. Other gelatin-like products from non-animal sources such as agar agar and carrageenan are pareve by nature. Fish gelatin is derived from fish and is therefore (like all kosher fish products) pareve. Eggs are also considered pareve despite being an animal product.|$|E
5|$|Cheese was {{far more}} {{important}} as a foodstuff, especially for common people, {{and it has been}} suggested that it was, during many periods, the chief supplier of animal protein among the lower classes. Many varieties of cheese eaten today, like Dutch Edam, Northern French Brie and Italian Parmesan, were available and well known in late medieval times. There were also whey cheeses, like ricotta, made from by-products of the production of harder cheeses. Cheese was used in cooking for pies and soups, the latter being common fare in German-speaking areas. Butter, another important <b>dairy</b> <b>product,</b> was in popular use in the regions of Northern Europe that specialized in cattle production in the latter half of the Middle Ages, the Low Countries and Southern Scandinavia. While most other regions used oil or lard as cooking fats, butter was the dominant cooking medium in these areas. Its production also allowed for a lucrative butter export from the 12th century onward.|$|E

Apart from these, Sabah also {{features}} a number of snacks like amplang, cincin, lidah, roti kahwin, UFOs pinjaram and Sandakan tart and dessert like lamban, punjung and Tuaran coconut pudding. Every ethnic group has its own cuisine with different styles of preparing, cooking, {{and the way they}} serving and eating the food. Example of Sabah-based companies promoting <b>dairy</b> <b>product</b> and state drinks are like the Desa Cattle, Tenom coffee and Sabah Tea. The indigenous people features a number of alcoholic drinks such as bahar, kinomol, lihing, montoku, sagantang, sikat and tuak; with the state itself becoming the third highest in alcohol consumption in the country after Kuala Lumpur and Sarawak. The English Tea House and Restaurant in Sandakan is another attraction promoting the British tea culture. Other international shops and restaurants such as for Western food, Middle Eastern food, Bruneian food, Indonesian food, Filipino food, Japanese food, Korean food, Taiwanese food, Thai food and Vietnamese food have their presence here. With the increasing number of tourists on the purpose of culinary tourism, this have since raise the local awareness on the important of local food to state tourism.|$|E

Taking all <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> together, an average consumption of 18 kg liquid milk equivalent (LME) person per year was estimated. Rich households consumed an average of 22 kg LME/person per year and spent 1. 8 percent of their monthly income on <b>dairy</b> <b>products.</b> Poor housholds consumed an average of 6. 4 kg LME/person per year and spent 3. 4 percent of their monthly income on <b>dairy</b> <b>products.</b> Locally produced fresh milk, factory reconstituted milk and directly imported readily usable milk were among the most frequently consumed <b>dairy</b> <b>products.</b> Financial difficulty was cited as the most important reason for the low level and irregularity of consumption of <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> by the poor households.

40|$|People with {{celiac disease}} {{represent}} susceptible population {{that can be}} cured only by “gluten-free” diet, while <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> have been recognized as exceptionally recommended. Therefore, {{it is very important}} for <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> not to contain gluten in concentrations that could be harmful for them. The aim of this research was to investigate risk exposure to gluten from <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> for the population with celiac disease in the Republic of Croatia by usage of referent analytical methods and scientifically based methods of risk assessment. Total number of 19 subgroups of standard <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> (n= 40) and four subgroups of “gluten-free” <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> (n= 53) labelled with crossed cereal or quotation “glutenfree” and without quantity of gluten labelled were analysed by ELISA-R 5 method.

The results have shown that number of standard <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> that according to their nature should not contain gluten, as well as “gluten-free” <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> contain certain amount of gluten that can be estimated in certain unfavourable scenarios and in susceptible subpopulations as risky to sick individuals. <b>Dairy</b> <b>products</b> represent very low risk to adult population with celiac disease and can be consumed in quantities that do not differ from the recommended quantities for healthy population. On the other side, <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> for infants in the age from 6 to 12 months represent increased risk for infants with celiac disease and require implementation of risk management activities in order to reduce risk. <b>Dairy</b> <b>products</b> for infants and children from 1 to 6 years represent moderate risk depending on eating habits.

25|$|Butter is a <b>dairy</b> <b>product</b> {{containing}} up to 80% butterfat (in commercial products) {{which is}} solid when chilled and {{at room temperature}} in some regions and liquid when warmed.

25|$|Venn {{diagrams}} {{are similar}} to Euler diagrams. However, a Venn diagram for n component sets must contain all 2n hypothetically possible zones that correspond to some combination of inclusion or exclusion {{in each of the}} component sets. Euler diagrams contain only the actually possible zones in a given context. In Venn diagrams, a shaded zone may represent an empty zone, whereas in an Euler diagram the corresponding zone is missing from the diagram. For example, if one set represents dairy products and another cheeses, the Venn diagram contains a zone for cheeses that are not dairy products. Assuming that in the context cheese means some type of <b>dairy</b> <b>product,</b> the Euler diagram has the cheese zone entirely contained within the dairy-product zone—there is no zone for (non-existent) non-dairy cheese. This means that as the number of contours increases, Euler diagrams are typically less visually complex than the equivalent Venn diagram, particularly if the number of non-empty intersections is small.|$|E

25|$|Certain breeds of cattle, {{such as the}} Holstein-Friesian, {{are used}} to produce milk, which can be {{processed}} into dairy products such as milk, cheese or yogurt. Dairy cattle are usually kept on specialized dairy farms designed for milk production. Most cows are milked twice per day, with milk processed at a dairy, which may be onsite at the farm or the milk may be shipped to a dairy plant for eventual sale of a <b>dairy</b> <b>product.</b> For dairy cattle to continue producing milk, they must give birth to one calf per year. If the calf is male, it generally is slaughtered {{at a young age}} to produce veal. They will continue to produce milk until three weeks before birth. Over the last fifty years, dairy farming has become more intensive to increase the yield of milk produced by each cow. The Holstein-Friesian is the breed of dairy cow most common in the UK, Europe and the United States. It has been bred selectively to produce the highest yields of milk of any cow. Around 22 litres per day is average in the UK.|$|E

Moreover, the mean consumption of <b>dairy</b> <b>products,</b> as well as their nutritional contribution in total energy, protein, calcium, phosphorus and magnesium intake was estimated. Results: It was observed that only 43. 0 % of the population reported consuming <b>dairy</b> <b>products,</b> being the milk subgroup the most frequently consumed (21. 1 %). The prevalence of consumption was higher among females, elderly, residents of the South region, and among individuals from higher per capita monthly family income. The nutritional contribution of <b>dairy</b> <b>products</b> was less than 10. 0 % of total energy intake and for most nutrients and the mean daily consumption are justified was 101. 8 g.
