2500|$|Because of {{the huge}} {{interest}} in the Confucius family tree, there was a project in China to test the DNA of known {{family members of the}} collateral branches in mainland China. Among other things, this would allow scientists to identify a common Y chromosome in male descendants of Confucius. If the descent were truly unbroken, father-to-son, since Confucius's lifetime, the males in the family would all have the same Y chromosome as their direct male ancestor, with slight mutations due to the passage of time. The aim of the genetic test was the help members of collateral branches in China who lost their genealogical records to prove their descent. However, in 2009, many of the collateral branches decided not to agree to DNA testing. Bryan Sykes, professor of genetics at Oxford University, understands this decision: [...] "The Confucius family tree has an enormous cultural significance," [...] he said. [...] "It's not just a scientific question." [...] The DNA testing was originally proposed to add new members, many of whose <b>family</b> <b>record</b> <b>books</b> were lost during 20th-century upheavals, to the Confucian family tree. The main branch of the family which fled to Taiwan was never involved in the proposed DNA test at all.|$|R

40|$|Aims: Home glucose {{testing and}} {{reflection}} on patterns are {{important elements of}} type 1 diabetes self-management. We hypothesised that patients who demonstrated evidence of self-testing by bringing a <b>record</b> <b>book</b> (capillary blood glucose monitoring diary) to clinic would have better glycaemic control than patients with a glucometer alone, or neither <b>record</b> <b>book</b> nor glucometer. Methods: This was a prospective observational study of 233 consecutive type 1 diabetes patients using basal-bolus insulin. Exclusion criteria were diagnosis of type 1 diabetes within the previous year, current pregnancy, or prior inclusion in this study. We recorded {{the presence or absence}} of a <b>record</b> <b>book</b> or glucometer at the clinic, glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1 c), and previous structured education attendance. Results: Of 233 patients, 90 brought a <b>record</b> <b>book,</b> 61 brought a glucometer and 82 brought neither. Mean HbA 1 c did not differ between patients with a <b>record</b> <b>book</b> (63 Â± 2 mmol/mol [7. 9 Â± 0. 2 %]) or glucometer (63 Â± 2 mmol/mol [7. 9 Â± 0. 2 %]), but was higher in those with neither (77 Â± 2 mmol/mol [9. 2 Â± 0. 2 %]; p< 0. 001). Patients bringing a <b>record</b> <b>book</b> were older on average than those with a glucometer or neither (49. 6 Â± 1. 7 vs. 41. 2 Â± 1. 7 vs. 40. 6 Â± 1. 4 years; p< 0. 001) and had longer mean duration of diabetes (27. 9 Â± 2. 0 vs. 19. 2 Â± 1. 7 vs. 18. 7 Â± 1. 6 years; p< 0. 001). Prior structured education did not predict the presence of a <b>record</b> <b>book</b> or glucometer in the clinic. Conclusions: Evidence of self-testing at clinic review, either as a <b>record</b> <b>book</b> or glucometer, was associated with improved control compared with those with neither. HbA 1 c did not differ between patients bringing a <b>record</b> <b>book</b> or glucometer. Self-reflection on glucose results is important for type 1 diabetes self-management, irrespective of the recording method used...|$|R
