40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{constructed}} a glassy carbon electrode {{covered with a}} biocompatible chitin-chitosan film that can modify <b>functional</b> <b>substance.</b> A carbon powder and a ferrocene were introduced into the composite film as the substances. The carbon powder improved the conductivity of the film, and the ferrocene had the function of an electron mediator. The ferrocene moieties were bound to the composite film using Schiff base between amino groups of the chitosan and ferrocenecarboxaldehyde. To examine {{the behavior of the}} ferrocene/carbon powder chitin-chitosan film, an electroactive dihydroxybenzene was selected. Dihydroxybenzene has three structural isomers, and the isomers are called pyrocatechol, resorcinol, and hydroquinone. Each electrode response differed, due to the difference of the permeability to the chitin-chitosan film. As a result, the responses of pyrocatechol were particularly improved. Therefore, the electrode constructed could contribute to measure catechol amines such as dopamine and adrenaline that are significant within organisms...|$|E

With these and other vectors a general system for the cloning and expression of mAbs under a series of promoters (of the rat VGF 8 a gene, the neurofilament light-chain gene, and the methallothionein gene) has been created. The activity of these plasmids was confirmed by expressing the recombinant NC 1 / 34 HL mAb in GH 3 pituitary cells, PC 12 pheochromocytoma cells, and COS cells. DNA from the described constructs can be used to target the expression of the NC 1 / 34 HL mAb to the central nervous system of transgenic mice.

Using a <b>functional</b> <b>substance</b> use perspective and via the lens of socialidentity theory, this paper aims to explore the role of AmED consumption amongst the milieuof nightlife and party culture. Methods: Twenty-five regular AmED consumers aged 18 – 33 participated in semi-structured interviews. Qualitative thematic analysis of transcripts wasundertaken, with a focus on the social contexts and perceived functions of AmED consumption,group dynamics and social identity. Findings: Three main themes were identified: (i) AmED usewas restricted to specific social contexts, (ii) AmED use performed a social function and(iii) AmED users identified with a coherent and consistent social identity. AmED use was almostexclusively reported to occur within group drinking scenarios at parties and licensed venues,particularly nightclubs. AmED users identified with a clear and consistent social identity thatwas distinct from other alcohol consumers, typified by gregarious and extroverted behaviour. AmED use was seen to facilitate these ideals and strengthen group cohesion in appropriatecontexts.

Here, we demonstrate that the combination of CARS and THG microscopy can successfully be used, by mapping the spatial distribution and release rates of the fungicide and food preservative IPBC from different designs of PMMA microparticles at single-particle level. By fitting a radial diffusion model to the experimental data, single particle diffusion coefficients can be determined. We show that release rates are highly dependent on the size and morphology of the particles. Hence, CARS and THG microscopy provides adequate sensitivity and spatial resolution for quantitative studies on how single-particle properties affect the diffusion of active agents at microscopic level.

40|$|We {{breathe in}} order to {{maintain}} oxygen, carbon dioxide and pH levels within the physiological range in response to the metabolic demands of the body. To achieve this, the respiratory control system is dependent on input from peripheral and/ central chemosensitive areas and on participation of different neuromodulator systems. This thesis focuses on the role of one of the neurotransmitters, substance P, involved in the complex and finely tuned control of respiration. It also explores how prenatal nicotine exposure affects the substance P-ergic system and the effects of morphine when this system is non-functional. To investigate if endogenously released substance P is necessary for the hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR) in the intact newborn rat pup (postnatal day five, P 5) we used a neurokinin 1 -receptor antagonist (RP 67580) injected intracerebroventricularly. We could demonstrate that RP 67580 -treated animals displayed an altered HVR but normal respiration during normal conditions, indicating that endogenously released substance P is necessary for an adequate response to hypoxic stress. Furthermore, in situ hybridisation demonstrated that c-fos mRNA expression, used as a marker for neuronal activation, was decreased in respiration related areas in the brainstem in RP 67580 -treated animals, indicating structures involved in the perturbed HVR. We also used a transgenic mouse model (Tac 1 -/-), lacking substance P and neurokinin A (NKA), to investigate the respiratory response to intermittent hypoxia and hypercapnic stress at P 2 - 3 and at P 8 - 10 to identify developmental changes. In vivo experiments, using flow-plethysmography, displayed an attenuated increase in tidal volume during intermittent hypoxia in transgenic mice, P 8 - 10, whereas the younger animals did not differ from controls except from an altered breathing pattern with fewer apneas and more augmented inspiratory breaths with a pause during intermittent hypoxia. Brain-stem spinal cord preparations of P 2 -mice revealed that intermittent hypoxia did not induce an increase in burst frequency, reflecting long-term facilitation, in Tac 1 -/- mice as displayed in controls. This was also manifested in vivo as an impaired augmentation of ventilation during posthypoxic periods. Furthermore, transgenic mice displayed a more prominent posthypoxic frequency decline in vivo and posthypoxic neuronal arrests appeared more often in vitro. In line with previous studies the hypercapnic response did not differ between strains, confirming that substance P is not involved. Thus, our results show that a <b>functional</b> <b>substance</b> P/NKA system is essential to generate an adequate respiratory response and that it is also involved in the plasticity of respiratory network during early development. Human sudden infant death victims have elevated levels of substance P-like immunoreactivity (-LI) in the brainstem and nicotine increases the risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) by up to four-fold. We could demonstrate elevated substance P-LI levels in the brainstem and alterations of the substance P-precursor, preprotachykinin A mRNA expression in carotid body and petrosal/jugular ganglia following prenatal nicotine exposure in newborn rat (P 1). This may offer a biochemical link between nicotine exposure and SIDS. We also show an increase in morphine analgesia and reduced main (respiratory depression) and other side-effects in Tac 1 -/- mice. Since morphine is a widely used analgetic drug, also in neonates, with a narrow therapeutic window, our result offers the possibility to decrease the activity of substance P/NK- receptor signalling and thereby improve the pharmacological potential of morphine. In conclusion, this thesis demonstrates the involvement of substance P in the HVR and plasticity of the respiratory network. Prenatal nicotine exposure severely affects the substance Pergic system, a possible underlying mechanism for SIDS. Furthermore, it offers a correlation between the functionality of the substance P-ergic system and the breathing disturbances seen in Rett syndrome...|$|E

40|$|Fluidized bed coating {{has been}} used to coat pellets or tablets with <b>functional</b> <b>substances</b> for a number of purposes. In this coating process, {{particle}} wetting, drying and film formation are coupled to particle motion. It is therefore of interest to study particle motion in such fluidized beds and to use the results to develop a model for predicting the quality of the final product. In this paper, we present results from DEM-CFD simulations, i. e. discrete element method and computational fluid dynamics simulations of particle motion in a laboratory-scale Wurster fluidized bed that was also employed in positron emission particle tracking (PEPT) experiments. As the drag force is the dominant interaction between the gas flow and the particle motion in this type of fluidized bed, the effect of drag models on the particle motion is investigated. More specifically, the particle velocity and residence time distributions of particles in different regions calculated from five different drag models are presented. It is found that the Gidaspow and Tang drag models predict both particle cycle and residence times well. The HKL and Beetstra drag models somewhat overestimate the particle velocity in the Wurster tube and therefore predict a reduced number of recirculations and a significantly shorter cycle time...|$|R

40|$|Plants {{are exposed}} {{to a variety of}} adverse {{conditions}}, such as cold, drought, acidity, and heavy metal, among others, which affect their distribution, growth, development, and productivity. Since these conditions produce stress and result in extensive losses to many agriculturally important crops, they have been the main subject of intense research. It is well documented that, under harsh conditions, plants develop various strategies to cope with stress and its negative effects. As a result, they are able to sustain their normal function before being attacked or subjected to an otherwise lethal environment. In order to respond to stress, plants adapt in a multitude of physiological and biochemical ways in addition to inducing an array of functional or regulatory genes (Bartels and Sunkar 2005). The accumulation of some <b>functional</b> <b>substances,</b> such as compatible solute and protective proteins, is an important element of the physiological and biochemical response to the stressful conditions. Polyamines, mainly diamine putrescine (Put), triamine spermidine (Spd), and tetraamine spermine (Spm), are polycationic compounds of low molecular weight that are present in all living organisms. They have been proposed as a new category of plant growth regulators that are purported to be involved in a large spectrum of physiological processes, such as embryogenesis, cell division, morphogenesis, and development (Bais and Ravishankar 2002; Liu et al. 2006 a). In addition, they {{have been shown to be}} an integral part of plant stress respons...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAloe is an {{important}} source of functional components, including polysaccharides, organic acids, vitamins and minerals, which can be used in dietary foods and pharmaceutical products. Freeze drying, along with spray drying, constitute the basic drying technologies used for the increase of shelf-life of Aloe components. Aloe gel, the inner part of the plant's leaf, is the main source of these components, containing about 98 % water. The {{purpose of this study is}} the investigation of the effect of drying in the preservation of Aloe's <b>functional</b> <b>substances.</b> The differentiations of drying upon the polysaccharides, the essential components of the gel, were studied by means of 1 H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectrometry and Fourier Transformed Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR). The concentrations of inorganic constituents like K, Na, Ca, Mg were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Mb, Cr, Cd were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP/AES) and P content was determined by visible spectrometry, before and after drying. Gel was collected from the inner part of Aloe leaf and freeze dried. Concentration of polysaccharides was affected significantly from the drying process. On the other hand minerals concentration remained practically constant. Aloe gel contains a significant number of organic components, as well as minerals. The preservation and further use of these substances can be achieved by drying of Aloe gel. Nevertheless, drying process causes partial distraction of organic molecules and degradation of the produce Aloe powder...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{fundamental}} {{investigations of}} various carbon-based materials {{have been conducted}} {{in search of the}} application for these materials in different fields. One of these carbon-based materials is graphite felt which is produced from polyacrylonitrile fiber and is light-weight, has a large specific surface area, is permeable to gas and liquids in all directions, chemically and thermally stable, and electrically conductive. Due to these properties, it can be used for the production of electrodes for various electrochemical devices. In order to make the graphite felt electrodes suitable for conduction of electrochemical processes, they are often additionally treated thermally and modified with <b>functional</b> <b>substances</b> by using chemical and electrochemical methods. Aim of the work - to investigate the potential of graphite felt modification with Co, Co-Ni, Ni, and Ag by electroless deposition and to evaluate the electrochemical properties of the modified graphite felt with the aim to use it in the electrochemical polysulfide and bromide/bromobromide flow energy storage devices for the more effective conduction of oxidation-reduction reactions. The modification of graphite felt with Co, Co-Ni, Ni, and Ag coatings by using the electroless (chemical) deposition method with stirring of solutions with a magnetic stirrer, ultrasound stirring (ultrasonication), and continuous circulation in flow-through reactor was investigated. The influence of different hydrodynamic conditions on the distribution of metals in the whole volume of the modified graphite felt was determined.

30|$|The amine transferases GOT and GPT are {{distributed}} in {{blood in the}} liver and spleen of fish bodies. While they maintain low activity when the fish body is healthy, they are released {{in the presence of}} tissue necrosis or diseases, resulting in increased activity (Min et al. 2003). GOT was observed to increase in trout when stress was induced with rapid changes of the salinity in the feeding water (Chang and Hur 1999). Juvenile black sea breams also showed increased GOT with acute salt stress (Min et al. 2003). Significantly increased GOT was found in adult and juvenile Paralichthys olivaceus in response to acute stress from low salt levels in the feeding water (Her et al. 2002). Her et al. (2002) reported that this was due to impaired liver functions owing to physiological burdens on liver and spleen cells and excess energy consumption. However, although we observed a decrease in GOT and an increase in GPT, results that differed from previous studies, we were able to confirm that the stress due to air exposure negatively influenced liver functions. The FSM groups had especially high GPT levels compared to the control group. Even though such a difference is considered to mainly be caused by vitamin C concentrations, it showed higher values in the supplement group with greater than FSM 10 % than the control group. It is therefore expected that FSM <b>functional</b> <b>substances</b> such as collagen have positive effects that promote the quick recover of energy metabolism following impaired liver functions.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{utilization}} {{efficiency of}} solar energy through photosynthesis by crops {{is only a}} few percent at most. Therefore, most solar energy in the field (on-site) remains unused. Plants are, however, able to use certain types of monochromatic light as an environmental signal, and they exhibit various physiological responses to even small amounts of the light. In particular, the significant induction of secondary metabolite production by blue light is well documented. Here, we propose a novel cropping method where unused solar energy is captured on-site by solar cells and converted to monochromatic light by using LEDs. The crops are then irradiated to stimulate enhanced production of secondary metabolites, thus improving crop function without the need for an external energy source. In this study, the effect of blue light on the production of functional secondary metabolites was evaluated in perilla (Perilla frutescens var. crispa f. purpurea), a traditional medicinal crop in Japan. Perilla leaves contain several <b>functional</b> <b>substances</b> such as perillaldehyde, rosmarinic acid, and anthocyanins, which have notable stomachic, antipyretic, detoxification, sedation, and diuretic efficacy. Plants were grown under natural daylight supplemented with blue light irradiation (460 nm, approx. 10 μmol/m 2 /s, 24 h,) for 108 days before harvest. Control plants were grown without supplemental lighting. The content ratio of perillaldehyde in plants grown with blue light was 60 % higher at harvest than in the controls. Moreover, in the vegetative growth stage, the perillaldehyde content increased significantly after only three days of blue light irradiation. These findings suggest that the present approach will benefit agricultural practices in developing countries through more efficient usage of on-site solar energy...|$|R
