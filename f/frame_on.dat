5|$|The {{equivalence}} between gravitational and {{inertial effects}} {{does not constitute}} a complete theory of gravity. When it comes to explaining gravity near our own location on the Earth's surface, noting that our reference frame is not in free fall, so that fictitious forces are to be expected, provides a suitable explanation. But a freely falling reference <b>frame</b> <b>on</b> {{one side of the}} Earth cannot explain why the people {{on the opposite side of}} the Earth experience a gravitational pull in the opposite direction.|$|E
5|$|Work {{was also}} {{carried out on}} the castle grounds, the {{interior}} being flattened further, destroying much of the medieval and Roman archaeological remains. In 1889, Lord Bute's building works uncovered {{the remains of the}} old Roman fort {{for the first time since}} the 11th century, leading to archaeological investigations being carried out in 1890. New walls in a Roman style were built by William <b>Frame</b> <b>on</b> the foundations of the originals, complete with a reconstructed Roman North Gate, and the outer medieval bank was stripped away around the new walls.|$|E
5|$|In the new year, O'Sullivan {{failed to}} reach the quarter-final stages of a ranking event {{for the first time}} this season: losing 4–5 to Joe Swail in the last 16. This began a run of poor form that saw O'Sullivan lose in the opening round of the Masters 2–6 to Jimmy White and then in the second round of the Thailand Masters 4–5 to Shokat Ali (losing the {{deciding}} <b>frame</b> <b>on</b> a re-spotted black). O'Sullivan returned to winning ways, by capturing the Irish Masters title by defeating Stephen Hendry 9–8 in the final, before he experienced another dip in form losing to Mark Davis in opening round of the Scottish Open.|$|E

25|$|If {{one looks}} at this train from the fixed {{non-rotating}} <b>frame</b> <b>on</b> top {{of the center of}} the Earth, at that speed it remains stationary as the Earth spins beneath it. Hence, the only force acting on it is gravity and the reaction from the track. This force is greater (by 0.34%) than the force that the passengers and the train experience when at rest (rotating along with Earth). This difference is what the Coriolis effect accounts for in the rotating frame of reference.|$|E
25|$|Kawazoe, Maki and Kurokawa {{had invited}} a {{selection}} of world architects to design displays for the Mid-Air Exhibition {{that was to be}} incorporated within the roof. The architects included Moshe Safdie, Yona Friedman, Hans Hollein and Giancarlo De Carlo. Although Tange was obsessed with the theory of flexibility that the space framed provide he did concede that in reality it was not so practical for the actual fixing of the displays. The roof itself was designed by Koji Kamaya and Mamoru Kawaguchi who conceived it as a huge space frame. Kawaguchi invented a welding-free ball joint to safely distribute the load and worked out a method of assembling the <b>frame</b> <b>on</b> the ground before raising it using jacks.|$|E
25|$|A GIMP plug-in for {{creating}} animations. GAP can save animations in several formats, including GIF and AVI. The animation function relies on GIMP's layering and image file name numbering capability. Animations are created either by placing each <b>frame</b> <b>on</b> its own layer (in other words, treating each layer as an animation cel), or by manipulating each numbered file {{as if it}} were a frame in the video: moving, rotating, flipping, changing colors, applying filters, etc. to the layers by taking advantage of interpolation within function calls(plug-in usage), within a specified frame range. The resulting project can be saved as an animated GIF or encoded video file. GAP also provides programmed layer transitions, frame rate change, and move paths, allowing the creation of sophisticated animations.|$|E

25|$|Bell is also {{credited}} with developing {{one of the}} early versions of a metal detector in 1881. The device was quickly put together in an attempt to find the bullet in the body of U.S. President James Garfield. According to some accounts, the metal detector worked flawlessly in tests but did not find the assassin's bullet partly because the metal bed <b>frame</b> <b>on</b> which the President was lying disturbed the instrument, resulting in static. The president's surgeons, who were skeptical of the device, ignored Bell's requests to move the president to a bed not fitted with metal springs. Alternatively, although Bell had detected a slight sound on his first test, the bullet may have been lodged too deeply to be detected by the crude apparatus.|$|E
25|$|Its {{fuselage}} was {{a simple}} rectangular cross section wooden structure skinned with plywood. The single seat, open, unscreened cockpit was immediately below the leading edge. The landing skid was mounted {{on the front end}} of a curved, deep, covered <b>frame</b> <b>on</b> the fuselage underside, separating from it aft and rubber sprung well clear towards its end. The fuselage tapered rearwards, where there was a small tail bumper. The tail was {{different from that of the}} BS.16; although the same triangular tailplane and parallel chord, cropped tipped elevators were used, they were mounted on top of a low, straight edged fin. A new, large, balanced, angular rudder, hinged at the extreme tail extended down to the keel, operated in a cut-out between the elevators.|$|E
25|$|Twisting is {{the process}} in which two or more single-spun yarns are united to produce a yarn of greater {{strength}} for use as warp threads in the weaving process and for normal knitting purposes. This is done by rollers delivering the yarns to a revolving spindle which twists or folds the single yarns around one another. The machines used are similar to spinning frames in their method of applying twist, but differ in that they have only one set of delivery rollers {{instead of the usual}} complement of drafting rollers. This machine is an early example of a flyer twisting <b>frame.</b> <b>On</b> the flyer twister, twist imparted to the yarn in a similar manner as on the flyer spinner. A weighted band, running in a groove {{at the base of the}} bobbin, retards the revolving bobbin creating enough tension for the flyer to wind the yarn evenly onto the bobbin. The machine is hand doffed.|$|E

25|$|Davis, who {{had been}} ranked the world number one for two years, and would remain in that {{position}} for another five, was strong favourite going into the event. The pair met in the semi-finals twelve months before with Davis coming through a convincing winner by 16 frames to 9. Taylor started the final strongly with a fifty plus break but Davis proved too strong by whitewashing Taylor in the first session and won the first frame of the second session to lead 8–0, Taylor won the ninth <b>frame</b> <b>on</b> the pink after Davis attempted and missed a fine cut on the green. This frame {{appeared to be the}} turning point of the match. Davis, looking tired and jaded allowed Taylor to win six of the next seven frames, producing quality break building including the highest break of the final of 98 to trail only 7–9 overnight.|$|E
25|$|In the Grand Prix final in 2005, Higgins beat Ronnie O'Sullivan 9–2. In doing so, {{he became}} the first player to record four {{consecutive}} centuries in a ranking tournament, with breaks of 103, 104, 138 and 128 in frames 7 to 10. Higgins scored 494 points without reply, which was then a record (Ding Junhui managed 495 points against Stephen Hendry in the Premier League in 2007). Higgins and O'Sullivan also contested the Masters finals in 2005 and 2006. Higgins was beaten 3–10 in 2005. In 2006, he lost the first three frames, but won the next five to establish a lead after the first session. O'Sullivan levelled in the evening, and the match went to a deciding <b>frame.</b> <b>On</b> a 60 break, O'Sullivan missed a red to a baulk pocket, and Higgins made a clearance of 64 to win 10–9 to claim the title for the second time.|$|E
25|$|Higgins beat Michael Holt, Fergal O'Brien, Ronnie O'Sullivan, and Stephen Maguire {{en route}} to the final. His break of 122 in the 29th frame of his semi-final against Maguire, on {{recovering}} from a deficit of 10–14 in the final session to prevail 17–15, was the 1,000th century to be made at the Crucible Theatre, Sheffield since the World Championship was first staged there in 1977. In the final, Higgins held a 12–4 advantage over Mark Selby overnight, but Selby reduced his arrears to a single <b>frame</b> <b>on</b> day two. However, at 14–13, Higgins rediscovered his form to win four consecutive frames to clinch the match 18–13 to secure his second World title at 12:54am, the latest finish to a World final (equalled when Neil Robertson beat Graeme Dott in 2010); and nine years after his first title– the longest time span between successes since Alex Higgins (1972, 1982), and the longest at The Crucible. He regained World no. 1 status.|$|E
