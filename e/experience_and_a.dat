Napoleon had used conscription {{to fill the}} ranks of the French army throughout his rule, but he did not conscript men for the 1815 campaign. His troops were mainly veterans with considerable <b>experience</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> fierce devotion to their Emperor. The cavalry in particular was both numerous and formidable, and included fourteen regiments of armoured heavy cavalry, and seven of highly versatile lancers who were armed with lances, sabres and firearms.|$|E

25|$|In 2009, Dover Area School District reports {{employing}} 351 {{teachers and}} administrators with a salary range of $39,277 to $135,200. Teachers earn extra pay for duties such as advising the clubs, writing curriculum or coaching athletics teams. That amount ranges from several hundred dollars a year to a few thousand. When a team progresses past the regular season the coaches are paid additional dollars for each week the teams continues to play. All of this is stipulated in the teachers' union contract at each district. Additionally, the district's teacher union contract includes seven levels, from a bachelor's degree to a doctorate. A teacher with five years of <b>experience</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> doctorate would make about $7,500 more than one with the same <b>experience</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> master's degree. A teacher who achieves {{a higher level of}} education receives a raise in step pay and then the annual raise, as well. The school contract year is 190 days. In addition to salary, the teachers receive an extensive benefits package which includes: health insurance, life insurance, vision insurance, dental insurance, a defined benefit pension, 10 paid sick and 2-3 paid personal days, reimbursement for college courses and more.|$|E

25|$|The first Roman {{expedition}} outside mainland Italy {{was against}} the island of Sicily in 265 BC. This led to the outbreak of hostilities with Carthage, which would last until 241 BC. At the time, the Punic city was the unchallenged master of the western Mediterranean, possessing a long maritime and naval <b>experience</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> large fleet. Although Rome had relied on her legions for the conquest of Italy, operations in Sicily had to be supported by a fleet, and the ships available by Rome's allies were insufficient. Thus in 261 BC, the Roman Senate set out to construct a fleet of 100 quinqueremes and 20 triremes. According to Polybius, the Romans seized a shipwrecked Carthaginian quinquereme, and {{used it as a}} blueprint for their own ships. The new fleets were commanded by the annually elected Roman magistrates, but naval expertise was provided by the lower officers, who continued to be provided by the socii, mostly Greeks. This practice was continued until well into the Empire, something also attested by the direct adoption of numerous Greek naval terms.|$|E
