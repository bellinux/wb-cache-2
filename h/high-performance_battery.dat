For electrical vehicles, battery packs and a suitable charger are needed to power the car and are seldom included. A soldering iron and supplies are often necessary to build <b>high-performance</b> <b>battery</b> packs or install upgraded electronics with low-resistance connectors. A Li-Polymer battery with a hard case is most popular for RC cars, with the most common voltages being 7.4 V or 11.1 V. For nitro-powered vehicles, a glow plug heater and fuel are needed to start the engine, as well as 4 AA size batteries, or a rechargeable 6-volt 5-cell battery pack to power the onboard electronics. Nitro vehicles also require a means of cranking the engine over, which can be achieved using a pullstart, starterbox, battery operated rotostart, or by an electric drill. Relatively expensive model fuel, spare glow-plugs, and after-run oil are also needed. Gasoline-powered vehicles require only a receiver battery pack and a means to start the engine, usually the included pullstart. Hobby-grade vehicles almost always require 8 AA size batteries to power the transmitter, though some can use rechargeable transmitter pack or simply rechargeable AAs.|$|E

40|$|The {{deployment}} of electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid {{vehicles on the}} premise of using low-carbon power sources (renewable energy and nuclear power) is expected to not only contribute to a stable energy supply by lowering dependence on oil (dependence on foreign supply sources) as fuel but also help to reduce CO 2 emissions. Moreover, the use of night-time electricity is likely to help spread the use of electric vehicles for commuter use by reducing energy cost. However, {{it is important to}} remember that if conventional electricity, mainly generated by coal-fired power plants, is to be used as a power source, the {{deployment of}} electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid vehicles may not necessarily be effective in reducing CO 2 emissions. It is also true that compared with vehicles powered by an internal-combustion engine, electric vehicles still have some shortcomings, such as their short driving range, some 100 km on a single charge of the battery, and the long battery-recharging time. To significantly increase the use of electric vehicles in the future, the key will be to develop a low-cost, <b>high-performance</b> <b>battery.</b> It will also be necessary to further reduce the cost of wind and photovoltaic power generation.

40|$|Electric {{vehicles}} are emission free due to independence from {{fossil fuels and}} it has great advantage of environmental sustainability. Under the pressure of stringent emissions legislation in the future, electrification of the drive train is an option {{in order to meet}} the emission standards law. Even though the battery technology has advanced greatly during the past decade, it still has some limitations. One limitation is the range, which would make only possible to use an electric vehicle in the urban traffic. An owner of a conventional vehicle is usually not having different vehicles for various applications such as driving to work, shopping, holidays, etc. In the case of the fuel cell range extender concept, as shown in figure 1, is an attractive way, which combine both technologies either permanently or on demand and also promotes the introduction of e-mobility as a sustainable vehicle concept. The on-board fuel cell charging system could also carry the tasks of heat management and the air conditioning, which requires new and innovative concepts, so that the range of the electric vehicle could be increased. In this mentioned range extender vehicle concept, the powertrain is driven mainly by the high performance Li-ion battery. In this project, the variant of lithium iron phosphate Li-FePO 4 battery has been used. The on-board fuel cell range extender in this case serves as an additional source of energy unit, which charge the <b>high-performance</b> <b>battery</b> in a low SOC and therefore extend the range. The design of such a vehicle concept is nowadays trend of technology therefore a simulation tool plays a very important role, which allows the prediction of the design. The role of the battery as opposed to the conventional vehicle acts here as the main energy storage, and therefore a study of the essential behavior of the battery must be done. The modeling of the battery was performed partially map-based, which enables a simpler parameterization. Besides the energetic behavior, the thermal behavior also would be described in the model, which is completed by the measurement of the temperature dependent charge and discharge behavior. A comprehensive survey of the behavior of the battery could be done by the integration to the full vehicle model, which are included an on-board fuel cell range extender, power electronics, electric motor, drive train, chassis, and controller cycles.

For example, spinel lithium manganese oxide (LiMn 2 O 4, LMO) materials, which are widely used in large-scale batteries for applications in EVs and ESSs, are struggling with dissolution of Mn 2 + ions at elevated temperatures. The Mn 2 + dissolutiontriggered disruption/contamination of electrodes are known to provoke serious capacity fading during charge/discharge cycling. As a ceramic-driven material/architecture strategy to develop an ultimate battery separator far beyond traditional polymeric separators, we have demonstrated flexible/functional porous ceramic membranes (referred to as “ 2 F ceramic separators”) with chemical traps for chelating heavy metal ions (here, Mn 2 +). The 2 F ceramic separator, which was comprised of the densely-packed F-silica particles spatially besieged by the PVP/PAN nanofiber skeleton, was fabricated using the simultaneous electrospraying/electrospinning process. The superlattice crystals-mimic structural uniqueness of the close-packed ceramic particles, in combination with the well-designed electrospun nanofiber skeleton, provided remarkable advances in the thermal/dimensional tolerance, mechanical flexibility and other separator properties. Furthermore, both the F-silica particles and PVP/PAN nanofibers possessed the Mn 2 +-chelating ability, which served as chemical traps for Mn 2 + ions during their passage through the liquid electrolyte-filled interstitial voids of the 2 F ceramic separator. As a consequence, the 2 F ceramic separator enabled unprecedented improvements in the <b>high-performance</b> lithium-ion <b>batteries.</b> The 2 F ceramic separator will hold a great deal of promise as a chemically-active separator for <b>high-performance</b> <b>batteries</b> that are eager to adopt high-energy (but, struggling with metal dissolution) electrode materials and also open a new ceramic opportunity for next-generation multifunctional membranes that are in strong pursuit of selectivity removing heavy metal ions. ope...|$|R

In this paper, life-cycle emission reductions and life-cycle costs were estimated for passenger cars fueled with methanol, ethanol, liquified petroleum gas, compressed natural gas, and electricity. Vehicle emission estimates included both exhaust and evaporative emissions for air pollutants of hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and air-toxic pollutants of benzene, formaldehyde, 1, 3 -butadiene, and acetaldehyde. Vehicle life-cycle cost estimates accounted for vehicle purchase prices, vehicle life, fuel costs, and vehicle maintenance costs. Emission control cost-effectiveness presented in dollars per ton of emission reduction was calculated for each alternative-fuel vehicle type from the estimated vehicle life-cycle emission reductions and costs. Among various alternative-fuel vehicle types, compressed natural gas vehicles are the most cost-effective vehicle type in controlling vehicle emissions.

Intercalation proceeded via a distinct phase separation of lithiated and delithiated regions. The process started at the atomic steps of the first layer beneath the selvedge and progressed in a layer-by-layer fashion. The intercalated regions consisted of Li-ion channels into which the newly inserted Li ions were pushed atom-by-atom. Interlayer diffusion of Li ions was not observed. Deintercalation was also clearly imaged and was found to transpire in a layer-by-layer mode. The intercalation and deintercalation processes were chemically reversible and can be repeated many times within a few atomic layers. Extensive intercalation of Li ions disrupted the atomically flat surface of MoS_ 2 because of the formation of small lithiated domains that peeled off from the surface of the crystal.
