5000|$|The Bullet gliders were {{designed}} as competition gliders. There are versions with <b>kingposts</b> and [...] "topless" [...] versions, each in two sizes. All four designs were certified to DHV Class 2-3.|$|R
50|$|After the Civil War, {{the mill}} resumed {{operations}} and its production increased. In 1886, it suffered {{damage from the}} 1886 Charleston earthquake. Brickwork was damaged and the gables were brought down. At some point before the 1920s, the entire roof was replaced except for the <b>kingposts</b> and trusses.|$|R
25|$|The Atlas was a {{development}} of the Quicksilver and as such incorporated many of the Quicksilver's features, such as a 6061-T6 aluminum-framed, single-surface Dacron-covered, wire-braced high wing, with the ground wires suspended from a <b>kingpost.</b> The fuselage structure was also built from 6061-T6 aluminum tube.|$|E
25|$|The design {{inherited}} some features {{from the}} earlier Mercury: it too had thin wings of constant chord with square tips of about the same span as the later Mercuries and used wing warping rather than ailerons. The wing was wire braced from above via a <b>kingpost</b> and below via the undercarriage, and was built up around machined I-section ash spars. The Type D also had the triangular cross-section fuselage seen on several of Blackburn's aircraft from the Second Monoplane onward.|$|E
25|$|The Burr Arch Truss, Burr Truss, or the Burr Arch, is a {{combination}} of an arch and a multiple <b>kingpost</b> truss design typically implemented in the construction of covered bridges. The design principle behind the Burr arch truss was that the arch should be capable of holding the entire load on the bridge while the truss was used to keep the bridge rigid. In 1804, American architect Theodore Burr, a cousin of then Vice President of the United States, Aaron Burr, designed and built the first Burr Truss on a bridge over the Hudson River in Watertown, New York.|$|E
2500|$|The 57-foot-high {{ceiling is}} {{topped by a}} timber roof that has [...] "arched braces, hammerbeams, <b>kingposts,</b> tie beams, purlins and rafters, all carved and ornamented, and, {{like the rest of}} the woodwork, in a natural finish," [...] as {{described}} in the building's nomination to the National Register of Historic Places.|$|R
50|$|The TPWD used careful {{consideration}} during {{the conversion of}} the ship into an artificial reef to preserve the ship's appearance. All masts and <b>kingposts</b> that were cut to meet Coast Guard clearance requirements being secured to the deck of the ship to add interest for divers and increase complexity for wildlife.|$|R

25|$|The {{change of}} use of the holds meant that Andes four cranes (two forward, two aft) could be removed. The two cranes on her after deck were {{replaced}} with a single <b>kingpost</b> and derrick abaft the E Deck superstructure for loading stores. The superstructure of D Deck was extended both fore and aft to add new cabins, which {{became known as the}} Dutch Cabins. Existing cabins were upgraded so that all now had either a shower or a bathroom en suite. A new children's playroom was added. The after extension allowed the lido area above to be enlarged and given greater facilities, including a cocktail lounge. Air conditioning was extended to all cabins and almost all public accommodation.|$|E
2500|$|The high-wing design uses a <b>kingpost</b> {{and cable}} bracing. The primary {{structure}} of the glider is of wood, with the wings, tail surfaces and inverted [...] "V" [...] <b>kingpost</b> all finished in doped aircraft fabric covering. The pilot sits on a simple seat in the open air, without a windshield.|$|E
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{made from}} aluminum tubing, with the single-surface wing covered in Dacron sailcloth and [...] cable braced from a single <b>kingpost.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Early monoplanes relied {{entirely on}} {{external}} wire bracing, either {{directly to the}} fuselage or to <b>kingposts</b> above it and undercarriage struts below to resist the same forces of lift and gravity. Many later monoplanes, beginning in 1915, have used cantilever wings with their lift bracing within the wing to avoid the drag penalties of external wires and struts, ...|$|R
50|$|Green Hill Cemetery Gatekeeper's House is a {{historic}} gatekeeper's house located at Green Hill Cemetery, Greensboro, Guilford County, North Carolina. It was built in 1888-1889, and is a 1 1/2-story, cross-shaped, frame structure in the Gothic Revival style. It features a steeply pitched cross-gable roof with wide overhanging eaves. It also has sawnwork bargeboards with <b>kingposts</b> and a full-width one-story porch.|$|R
50|$|Alcyone left Philippine waters on 11 February, {{bound for}} the United States. She made port calls at Manus and at Pearl Harbor before {{reaching}} San Francisco on 12 March. The ship then entered the Moore Dry Dock Company, Oakland, California, for overhaul. During this yard period, her <b>kingposts</b> were replaced by quadruped masts, her troop berths were removed, and temporary cargo storage cages were installed.|$|R
2500|$|Lighter weight version, with a <b>kingpost</b> {{and steel}} cable-bracing {{in place of}} struts and {{push-pull}} tubes eliminated in favor of cables. Landing gear is a [...] monowheel. Drawings no longer available {{as it has been}} replaced by the Goat 4.|$|E

5000|$|The Friend-Hack House is {{probably}} the best example of Stick / Eastlake style architecture in Milan. [...] It is a sprawling two-story structure with a gable roof, with single-story rear and side additions. It is clad in clapboard, including diagonal boarding in the gables, and features decorative <b>kingposts</b> under the gables. Large verandahs line the house. Outbuildings around the house include a wash house, outhouse, carriage house/stable, and a chicken coop.|$|R
50|$|The {{success of}} the S.41 was such that two similar {{aircraft}}, constructor's numbers S.51 and S.52, also powered by the two-row Gnome, were ordered by the RNAS, with serial numbers 20 and 21: These were first flown in April 1913. These aircraft differed in detail from the first aircraft: the wing section was improved, double-acting ailerons were fitted and the overhanging section of the upper wing was braced by <b>kingposts</b> rather than struts.|$|R
60|$|In the morning, {{obeying the}} devil devil doctor's commands, Lenerengo tied Jerry's feet together, {{not without a}} {{struggle}} in which his head was banged about and her hands were scratched. Then she carried him down through the village {{on the way to}} deliver him at Agno's house. On the way, in the open centre of the village where stood the <b>kingposts,</b> she left him lying on the ground in order to join in the hilarity of the population.|$|R

2500|$|Landis Mill Covered Bridge {{was built}} in 1873 by Elias McMellen {{at a cost of}} $969. [...] McMellen, who built many of Lancaster's covered bridges using the Burr arch truss, chose to build this short bridge using a simpler design with {{multiple}} <b>kingpost</b> trusses and, instead of Burr arches, pyramidal-shaped trusses to add additional support. [...] The bridge has remained despite the development of the surrounding countryside.|$|E
25|$|At the forecastle, {{behind the}} whaleback, the two cargo <b>kingposts</b> were removed and giant davits were {{installed}} to hoist two two-story, 11-knot tenders, built by Holen Mekaniske Verksted in Norway, {{and used to}} transfer passengers between the Norway and island docks where the harbour would not allow for the ship's 9-meter (35ft) draft. These tenders were named Little Norway I and Little Norway II, and were each themselves registered as ships, making the Norway the only passenger ship {{in the world to}} carry ships.|$|R
5000|$|The Martin-Handasyde No.3 bore {{a strong}} {{resemblance}} to the Antoinette monoplanes, with a slender wood-covered triangular section fuselage, and tapered wings which were braced by mid-span <b>kingposts.</b> Lateral control was by wing-warping and the angle of incidence of the wings varied from 5° at the wing root to zero at the tip. The undercarriage consisted {{of a pair of}} wheels on a cross-axle supplemented by a forward-projecting curved skid. It was initially powered by a [...] Antoinette V-8 engine. This was later changed for a [...] J.A.P..|$|R
5000|$|R101 used pre-doped linen panels {{for much}} of its covering, rather than lacing undoped fabric into place and then {{applying}} dope to shrink it. In {{order to reduce the}} area of unsupported fabric in the covering R101 alternated the main longitudinals with non-structural [...] "reefing booms" [...] mounted on <b>kingposts</b> which were adjustable using screw-jacks in order to tension the covering. The pre-doped fabric proved unsatisfactory from the start, with panels splitting because of humidity changes before the airship had even left its shed.|$|R

2500|$|Grasp {{has three}} {{manually}} operated fire monitors, {{one on the}} forward signal bridge, one on [...] the aft signal bridge, {{and one on the}} forecastle, that can deliver up to [...] per minute of seawater or [...] aqueous film forming foam (AFFF) When originally built, Grasp had a fourth remotely controlled fire monitor mounted on her forward <b>kingpost,</b> but this was later removed. Grasp has a [...] foam tank.|$|E
50|$|The basic {{specifications}} {{called for}} a five-hold steel cargo ship with raked stem and cruiser stern, complete shelter and second decks, and a third deck in Nos. 1-4 holds. Dimensions of the hatches were 20 ft × 30 ft, except for No. 2, which was 20 ft × 50 ft, allowing such cargo as locomotives, naval guns, long bars, etc. Ventilation to the holds was provided by hollow <b>kingposts,</b> which also served as cargo masts. Cargo handling gear consisted of fourteen 5-ton cargo booms, plus two 30-ton booms at Nos. 3 and 4 hatches.|$|R
50|$|The wings were mounted {{below the}} upper {{longerons}} and were slightly tapered. Lateral control was by wing warping. In earlier aircraft the warping and bracing wires {{were attached to}} a pair of vertical <b>kingposts</b> just aft of {{the leading edge of the}} wing: in later aircraft these were braced by diagonal struts leading back to the fuselage longerons. The empennage of early examples consisted of an elongated triangular vertical fin with a cutout to allow elevator travel with a rectangular rudder hinged to the trailing edge, and a similarly elongated triangular tailplane with an elevator.|$|R
2500|$|Construction of the {{aircraft}} was largely of wire-braced wood with fabric covering. The wings, of RAF34 section, were built in four sections, all with dihedral but the outer sections markedly so. The outer section upper mainplane extended past the lower mainplane and was supported by cables via <b>kingposts,</b> above the upper surface, over the outermost interplane struts. To facilitate storage the outer wing sections folded to the rear for a folded span of [...] At {{the rear of the}} fuselage a biplane tail-unit with twin fins and rudders provided control and stability in pitch and yaw.|$|R
