50|$|Stellers sea cow was {{a member}} of the genus Hydrodamalis, a group of large sirenians, whose sister taxon was Dusisiren. Like those of Stellers sea cow, the {{ancestors}} of Dusisiren lived in tropical mangroves before adapting to the cold climates of the North Pacific. Hydrodamalis and Dusisiren are classified together in the subfamily Hydrodamalinae, which diverged from other sirenians around 4 to 8 mya. Stellers sea cow is a member of the family Dugongidae, whose sole surviving member, and thus Stellers sea cows closest living relative, is the <b>dugong</b> (<b>Dugong</b> <b>dugon).</b>|$|R
40|$|In August 1997, the Commonwealth and Queensland Governments {{established}} 16 coastal Dugong Protection Areas (DPAs) {{to reduce}} the threat of mesh nets to <b>dugongs</b> (<b>Dugong</b> <b>dugon).</b> The DPAs are situated in the Central and Mackay/Capricorn Sections of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP) and the Hervey Bay–Great Sandy Strait region (Figure 1), and were enacted by Regulation No. 11 (1997) under the Queensland Fisheries Act 1994 and the Nature Conservation (Dugong) Conservation Plan 1999 under the Nature Conservation Act 1992. The establishment of DPAs was considered the key strategy to address the rapid decline of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) dugong population south of Cooktown...|$|R
40|$|The {{retention}} times of particulate digesta were measured in two captive <b>dugongs,</b> <b>Dugong</b> <b>dugon</b> (Muller 1776) using inert plastic markers. The mouth-to-anus {{retention times}} (146 - 166 h) {{were similar to}} those of the West Indian manatee, and much longer than those of most other herbivorous mammals. This slow gut passage rate may be explained by the dugong 2 ̆ 7 s long digestive tract, the low fibre level of the diet and the low food intake. Like the manatee, the dugong appears to have a digestive strategy that is atypical of hindgut fermenters: low-fibre material is retained for extended periods within the long hindgut and almost completely digested...|$|R
40|$|Programme, {{identified}} {{the reduction of}} incidental deaths of marine species {{due in part to}} gillnet fishing operations as a priority. In Queensland <b>dugong</b> (<b>Dugong</b> <b>dugon),</b> Irrawaddy River dolphin (Orcaecella brevirostris), and the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis), were perceived to be at risk. Bycatch reduction of large whales by 3 - 4 kHz fundamental frequency acoustic devices [1] has remained unchallenged in the literature. The Queensland Shark Control Program has successfully utilized an acoustic strategy to reduce bycatch of humpback whales. Bycatch has remained lower than pre-acoustic alarm times [2], while humpback numbers have increased 8 - 11 % annually over this period [3]. High and low frequency acoustic alarms reduce...|$|R
40|$|Fat {{tissue samples}} from <b>dugong</b> (<b>Dugong</b> <b>dugon)</b> {{carcasses}} stranded at three sites along the Great Barrier Reef were analysed for polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and dibenzofurans (PCDFs). Relatively {{high levels of}} PCDDs were determined in all three dugongs. In particular OCDD, the PCDD/F congener that is usually considered the least bioavailable of all 2, 3, 7, 8 substituted congeners, was found at levels higher than reported for other marine mammals. Tissue accumulation of PCDDs by dugongs may be a consequence of sediment and/or seagrass ingestion during feeding, microbial biotransformation of PCDD precursors in the animal 2 ̆ 7 s hindgut or, alternatively, the possession of a selective degradation capability for PCDFs.

5000|$|Steller's sea cow (Hydrodamalis gigas) is an {{extinct species}} of sirenian first {{discovered}} by Europeans in 1741. At {{the time of}} its discovery, the sea cow was found only around the Commander Islands, located in the Bering Sea between Alaska and Russia, however their range was more extensive during the Pleistocene epoch. It is possible that Steller's sea cow and humans interacted before their discovery on the Commander Islands. Steller's sea cow would reach weights of 8 - 10 MT and lengths of up to 9 m. The sea cow {{was a part of the}} order Sirenia, and member of the family Dugongidae, of which its closest living relative, the 3 m long <b>dugong</b> (<b>Dugong</b> <b>dugon),</b> is the sole surviving member.|$|R
40|$|A {{quantitative}} {{analysis of the}} stomach contents of an individual female <b>dugong</b> (<b>Dugong</b> <b>dugon)</b> caught by fishermen in February 1991 in the coastal waters of South Sulawesi, Indonesia, is presented. Of the total dry weight of digesta (about 3. 4 kg), 98. 9 % consisted of seagrass material. Rhizome and root material of smaller pioneering genera (i. e. Halophila, Halodule, Cymodocea) accounted for 71. 5 % of the total dry weight. Enhalus acoroides dominated among leaf material (about 50 %), but its contribution to the total biomass of the stomach contents was only 13. 5 %. Rhizome material of Enhalus and Thalassia was absent. The amount of sediment in the stomach was negligible. The results are compared with those from similar studies, and the implications for possible feeding selectivity are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} grazing by two megaherbivores, the <b>Dugong</b> <b>Dugong</b> <b>dugon</b> and the Green Turtle Chelonia mydas on the {{community}} structure of intertidal seagrasses was investigated experimentally over two time frames (shorterterm: 1 - 4 months; longer-term: 10 and 13 months), at three levels of grazing intensity (leaf cropping, light grazing, intensive grazing), at two seagrass meadows in tropical Queensland, Australia: (1) a mixed species bed of Zostera capricorni, Halophila ovalis, Halodule uninervis, Cymodocea rotundata and Cymodocea serrulata, and (2) a monospecific bed of Halodule uninervis. From {{the perspective of the}} megaherbivores, grazing improved the structure and dynamics of the tropical seagrass communities by altering their biomass, volume of detritus, net aboveground biomass productivity and the species composition of the mixed-species bed, Recovery from grazing disturbance occurred after several months to a year...|$|R
40|$|A {{significant}} proportion of the world’s remaining <b>dugongs</b> (<b>Dugong</b> <b>dugon)</b> occur off northern Australia where they face various anthropogenic impacts. Here, we investigate the viability of two dugong meta-populations under varying regimes of indigenous hunting. We construct population viability analyses (PVAs) using the computer package VORTEX and published estimates of population sizes and hunting rates. In Torres Strait between Cape York and New Guinea, our models predict severe and imminent reductions in dugong numbers. Our ‘optimistic’ and ‘pessimistic’ models suggest median times for quasi-extinction of 123 and 42 years, respectively. Extinction probabilities are also high for eastern Cape York Peninsula. We demonstrate the inadequacy of reserves when harvest rates in neighbouring areas are high, identify the maximum harvest rates for meta-population stability and emphasise the urgent need for indigenous community involvement in management to establish sustainable rates of dugong harvest in these regions...|$|R
