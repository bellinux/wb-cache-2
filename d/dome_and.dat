5|$|Examples of Ottoman Turkish {{architecture}} {{are located}} in the Old Bazaar. Mosques in Skopje are usually simple in design, with a square base and a single <b>dome</b> <b>and</b> minaret. There entrance is usually emphasised by a portico, as on Mustafa Pasha Mosque, dating from the 15th century. Some mosques show some originality in their appearance: Sultan Murad and Yahya Pasha mosques have lost their <b>dome</b> <b>and</b> have a pyramidal roof, while Isa Bey mosque has a rectangular base, two domes and two side wings. The Aladža Mosque was originally covered with blue faience, but it disappeared in the 1689 Great Fire. However, some tiles are still visible on the adjoining türbe. Other Turkish public monuments include the 16th-century clock tower, a bedesten, three caravanserais, two Turkish baths and the Stone Bridge, first mentioned in 1469.|$|E
5000|$|Block flows, lava flows, lava <b>domes</b> <b>and</b> some ignimbrites of {{pumiceous}} composition form this composite volcano. More {{than six}} lava <b>domes</b> <b>and</b> two major cones {{are part of}} this system and surrounded by a pyroclastic apron, which covers a surface area of 300 km2 and is formed from many pyroclastic flows with a total volume of [...] The pyroclastic flows contain pumice and large blocks, some of which show signs of deformation when they were still hot. The lava <b>domes</b> <b>and</b> lavas are grouped in three units. Presumably, the activity of Tumisa started with explosive eruptions that generated the ignimbrite apron, later degassed magma formed the lava <b>domes</b> <b>and</b> lava flows.|$|R
50|$|The volcanoes get {{larger and}} younger from {{northeast}} to southwest. They consist of stratovolcanoes, lava <b>domes,</b> <b>and</b> pyroclastic cones. These types of volcanoes form several rock types, some major ones are: andesite, basaltic andesite, and dacite rocks. Dacitic lava <b>domes</b> <b>and</b> flows are composed inside El Viejo and El Azufre.|$|R

5|$|Pillars and columns, such as Washington Column and Lost Arrow, {{are created}} by cross joints. Erosion acting on master joints is {{responsible}} for creating valleys and later canyons. The single most erosive force {{over the last few}} million years has been large alpine glaciers, which have turned the previously V-shaped river-cut valleys into U-shaped glacial-cut canyons (such as Yosemite Valley and Hetch Hetchy Valley). Exfoliation (caused by the tendency of crystals in plutonic rocks to expand at the surface) acting on granitic rock with widely spaced joints is responsible for creating domes such as Half <b>Dome</b> <b>and</b> North <b>Dome</b> <b>and</b> inset arches like Royal Arches.|$|E
5|$|A great {{portion of}} the mosque is covered with whitewash, but the drum of the <b>dome</b> <b>and</b> the walls {{immediately}} beneath it are decorated with mosaics and marble. Some paintings by an Italian artist were introduced when repairs were undertaken at the mosque after an earthquake ravaged the mosque in 1927. The ceiling of the mosque was painted with funding by King Farouk of Egypt.|$|E

5|$|A new remastered and {{expanded}} version of Live And Dangerous {{was released in}} 2011. As well as the full album, remastered by Andy Pearce and Matt Wortham, it featured two additional tracks that were not used, and a DVD with the Rainbow Theatre footage.

5|$|After the Nika Revolt {{destroyed}} much of {{the city}} of Constantinople in 532, including the churches of Hagia Sophia ("Holy Wisdom") and Hagia Irene ("Holy Peace"), Justinian had the opportunity to rebuild. Both had been basilica plan churches and both were rebuilt as domed basilicas, although the Hagia Sophia was rebuilt on a much grander scale. Built by Anthemius of Tralles and Isidore of Miletus in Constantinople between 532 and 537, the Hagia Sophia has been called the greatest building in the world. It is an original and innovative design with no known precedents in the way it covers a basilica plan with <b>dome</b> <b>and</b> semi-domes. Periodic earthquakes in the region have caused three partial collapses of the <b>dome</b> <b>and</b> necessitated repairs. The precise shape of the original central dome completed in 537 was significantly different from the current one and, according to contemporary accounts, much bolder.|$|E
5|$|As one of {{only two}} players left from the {{championship}} team, McNamara and Syracuse struggled through the 2005–2006 regular season. Two highlights were the 38 points McNamara scored against Davidson College, the second-most points ever scored by a Syracuse player at the team's home arena, the Carrier <b>Dome,</b> <b>and</b> a 30-point performance against the visiting Louisville Cardinals. Syracuse finished with a losing record in the Big East; the team was in danger of missing the NCAA Tournament unless it secured the conference's automatic bid by winning the Big East's postseason tournament.|$|E

5|$|Assisted by {{the school}} janitor Mister One, and pursued by a {{grotesque}} scarecrow-like being named Labor 9 who suddenly appears on the school grounds, Ryouta and Sakuya begin investigating the <b>dome</b> <b>and</b> the murder. They visit the lab and compare alibis; Shuu, who Ryouta distrusts, asks if Ryouta has forgotten anything important, to which he replies that he hasn't. Upon investigating the headmaster's office, they discover the headmaster had likewise been poisoned to death, what they saw earlier being merely pre-recorded footage; they also find a computer {{and a pair of}} documents, one titled The Human Representative and a torn, unreadable one titled Operation Hatoful. The Human Representative reveals that if the protagonist, a symbol of humanity, were to die, the campus would be sealed off and the birds inside handed over to humans as sacrifices—something confirmed when the computer is used to open a small hatch in the <b>dome</b> <b>and</b> students are shot dead as they attempt to flee—when the dome is lifted twelve hours after her death is reported.|$|E
5|$|By the 1960s the LPO had regained {{its earlier}} standards, and in 1964 it secured a {{valuable}} engagement {{to play in}} the Glyndebourne Festival opera house during the summer months. In 1993 it was appointed resident orchestra of the Royal Festival Hall on the south bank of the Thames, one of London's major concert venues. Since 1995 the residency has been jointly held with the Philharmonia. In addition to its work at the Festival Hall and Glyndebourne, the LPO performs regularly at the Congress Theatre, Eastbourne and the Brighton <b>Dome,</b> <b>and</b> tours nationally and internationally.|$|E

5|$|The cathedral is {{considered}} {{the largest and most}} impressive structure of Ani.

5|$|The planned mosque {{will not}} be in the Ottoman {{architecture}} style. It will have a concrete and glass <b>dome,</b> <b>and</b> two 55 meter high minarets. The mosque will have the bazaar and entrance on the ground floor, lecture halls in the basement, the prayer area on the upper floor and include a Muslim library. A well is intended to be placed in the center to connect the two levels and to create a pleasant atmosphere. The mosque consists of flat-like wall screens which form a dome in the center.|$|E
5|$|The {{projection}} dome was {{separate from}} the outer <b>dome,</b> <b>and</b> was 23 meters (75.4ft) in diameter. Made of curved aluminum sheets, it was lap jointed to create a continuous spherical surface.

5|$|A silver cross {{originally}} {{stood on}} its conical <b>dome</b> <b>and</b> a crystal chandelier, bought by King Smbat II from India, {{hang in the}} cathedral. In the 1010s, {{during the reign of}} Catholicos Sarkis I, a mausoleum dedicated to the Hripsimean virgins was erected next to the cathedral. The mausoleum was built on some of the remnants of the virgins brought from Vagharshapat (Etchmiadzin). In the 1040s–1050s inscriptions were left on the cathedral's eastern and western walls about urban projects, such as restoration of defensive walls, installation of water pipes and easing of the tax burden on the residents of Ani.|$|E
5|$|Funds were {{provided}} {{for the purchase of}} a 6-inch (150mm) refracting telescope from T. Cooke & Sons. The dome was originally designed to mount a small transit, and the lengthy telescope, over 2 metres long, had a limited field of view though the dome's opening. A large stone pillar was constructed inside the tower, raising the telescope to bring it closer to the <b>dome</b> <b>and</b> improve its field of view. Unfortunately, the new telescope was unable {{to take part in the}} transit measurements due to bad weather, and missed the 1895 Transit of Mercury for the same reason.|$|E
