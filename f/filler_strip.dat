50|$|In the post-World War II {{years he}} did his Sunday strip Specs for the New York Tribune Syndicate. Published for one full year (May 12, 1946 to May 25, 1947), it was a <b>filler</b> <b>strip</b> which did not always appear every week.|$|E
5000|$|Piper {{also created}} Steel Barr for OPCs Hurricane in 1946 and Lemmy Loo as a <b>filler</b> <b>strip</b> for K.G Murrays Captain Triumph Comics (October 1949 - February 1950). Steel Barr was resurrected by Youngs Merchandising in 1950, {{under the title}} Steel Barr and The Phantom Man. Australian comic book researcher, Kevin Patrick, {{describes}} Steel Barr as being [...] "a granite-jawed District Commissioner who patrolled the African jungles, battling myriad threats while searching for his elusive opponent, The Phantom Man." ...|$|E
50|$|The Bannisters - All the bannisters in {{the house}} must be replaced, but working with the contestants will be someone {{other than their own}} nominators. Tex, with Jennie, is done after 17 minutes, and Dez, with Marnie, {{following}} soon after. Both pass, and the other three (Casey paired with Tara, Joe with Tiina, and Charmaine with Rita) fail due to not having removed a <b>filler</b> <b>strip</b> prior to mounting the bannister to a wall that both Tex and Dez had done.|$|E
50|$|Henry Boltinoff (February 19, 1914 - April 26, 2001) was an American {{cartoonist}} {{who worked}} for both comic strips and comic books. He drew many of the humor and <b>filler</b> <b>strips</b> that appeared in National Periodical comics from the 1940s through the 1960s.|$|R
50|$|Johnny the Homicidal Maniac spawned two spin-offs: a four-issue series titled Squee!, and a double-shot titled I Feel Sick. The trade {{paperback}} {{release of}} Squee!, titled Squee's Wonderful Big Giant Book of Unspeakable Horrors, includes the <b>filler</b> <b>strips</b> {{left out of}} Director's Cut. Johnny makes cameo appearances {{at the end of}} Squee! and in the second issue of I Feel Sick.|$|R
5000|$|Johnny the Homicidal Maniac {{features}} several <b>filler</b> <b>strips,</b> which, for {{the most}} part, {{have nothing to do}} with the main storyline. Johnny the Homicidal Maniac: Director's Cut collects [...] "Happy Noodle Boy", [...] "Public Service Announcement", and [...] "Anne Gwish" [...] while Squee's Wonderful Big Giant Book of Unspeakable Horrors includes [...] "Wobbly-Headed Bob", [...] "Meanwhile...", and [...] "True Tales of Human Drama".|$|R
5000|$|A {{photograph}} {{of one of}} Vasquez's friends, Leah England, serves as {{the middle of a}} portrait collection {{on the cover of the}} second issue of Johnny the Homicidal Maniac. England also gave Vasquez the inspiration for a <b>filler</b> <b>strip</b> about a child who was dangerously afraid of losing sight of his mother, as well as the [...] "Meanwhile..." [...] strip in the second issue. The two were discussing an event that had happened to a cheerleader, and thinking up the worst excuse possible.|$|E
5000|$|Another type uses a glass {{reinforced}} plastic rod with a notch in one side, which carries one or two ribbons of glass fibers. The notch is filled with water-resistant gel and covered with an extruded plastic <b>filler</b> <b>strip.</b> The whole assembly is enclosed in a sunlight and tracking resistant sheath. This design is not as flexible as the symmetrical cylindrical design above, but provides good access to the fibers at joints and is resistant to crushing. At full working load the optical fibers may experience up to 0.25% strain, which is undesirable for long fiber life.|$|E
50|$|Dots {{are usually}} inlaid {{into the upper}} edge of the {{fretboard}} in the same positions, small enough to be visible only to the player. These usually appear on the odd numbered frets, {{but also on the}} 12th fret (the one octave mark) instead of the 11th and 13th frets. Some older or high-end instruments have inlays made of mother of pearl, abalone, ivory, colored wood or other exotic materials and designs. Simpler inlays are often made of plastic or painted. High-end classical guitars seldom have fretboard inlays as a well-trained player is expected to know his or her way around the instrument. In addition to fretboard inlay, the headstock and soundhole surround are also frequently inlaid. The manufacturer's logo or a small design is often inlaid into the headstock. Rosette designs vary from simple concentric circles to delicate fretwork mimicking the historic rosette of lutes. Bindings that edge the finger and sound boards are sometimes inlaid. Some instruments have a <b>filler</b> <b>strip</b> running down the length and behind the neck, used for strength or to fill the cavity through which the truss rod was installed in the neck.|$|E
50|$|La Prensa, a Mexican publisher, {{released}} the Spanish language {{editions of the}} Sad Sack comics under the title Tristán Tristón. In addition to Sad Sack strips, other strips within each Tristán Tristón issue included Tristána Tristóna (Sad Sack's cousin, Sadie Sack) and Capulín which was about a boy who had overly large feet. The latter two strips were often only one page and used as <b>filler.</b> Other <b>filler</b> <b>strips</b> included Firulais and Chiquilladas.|$|R
5000|$|Paul Wheelahan {{was born}} in Bombala, New South Wales in 1930, {{the son of a}} mounted policeman. He grew up in Dalton, New South Wales, during the great depression, and was educated in Goulburn and Muswellbrook. In 1947 Wheelahan moved to Sydney to find work and contact his idol, Stan Pitt, whose work, Silver Starr he had long admired. ...when the Sunday Sun and Guardian's Sunbeams comic {{supplement}} published episode one of Stanley Pitt's Silver Starr, I freaked. In the hour I first held that comic in my hands, I knew I would be a comic artist and assured everyone of this fact on that same day - including my parents, who were massively unimpressed. Paul Wheelahan [...] Wheelahan became friends with Pitt and from 1949 to 1950 Pitt employed him inking sections of Yarmak - Jungle King and Captain Power. Wheelahan also did artwork for H. John Edwards, including covers for the Fiction House line of reprints and fillers. H. John Edwards started giving me <b>filler</b> <b>strips</b> of two to four-page comics in reprints ofAmerican books, such as Sheena, Queen of the Jungle. Paul Wheelahan [...] One of these <b>filler</b> <b>strips</b> was 'Space Hawk', a science-fiction superhero, which appeared as a back-up feature in Edwards' reprints of Wings and Rangers comics.|$|R
5000|$|Johnny the Homicidal Maniac: Director's Cut, a trade {{paperback}} {{released by}} Slave Labor Graphics in July 1997, collected the series. Slave Labor also released a hardcover {{version of the}} collection. Rob Schrab provides a foreword. The trade paperback includes a [...] "Gallery of Ancient Horrors" [...] that features a few strips previously published in the Mount Pleasant High School newspaper and Carpe Noctem, {{as well as some}} strips previously unpublished, all with commentary by Vasquez. The paperback also introduces some new supplementary materials such as sketches, an issue-by-issue synopsis, character profiles, and a fictional interview with Vasquez, but leaves out many of the <b>filler</b> <b>strips</b> from the original series.|$|R
5000|$|Vasquez's first comic, Johnny the Homicidal Maniac, ran {{for seven}} issues and was {{collected}} as a hardcover and a trade paperback book, Johnny the Homicidal Maniac: Director's Cut. The cover features the logo [...] "Z?", meaning [...] "question sleep", which appears frequently throughout Vasquez's work and relates to his characters' insomnia {{and his own}} hypnophobia. The series follows Johnny as he searches for meaning in his life, a quest that frequently leads to the violent deaths of those around him as well as, briefly, his own. A photograph of one of Vasquez's friends, Leah England, serves as {{the middle of a}} portrait collection on the cover for the second issue of Johnny the Homicidal Maniac. England also gave Vasquez the inspiration for a <b>filler</b> <b>strip</b> about a child who was dangerously afraid of losing sight of his mother, as well as the notorious [...] "Meanwhile" [...] filler piece in the second issue of Johnny the Homicidal Maniac. Vasquez's next project was The Bad Art Collection, a 16-page one-shot comic.

50|$|Due to the character's {{popularity}} in Marvel UK's first title, The Mighty World of Marvel, Spider-Man was made {{the star of}} his own weekly comic in early 1973. A full story from the monthly The Amazing Spider-Man was published each week. The backup strip featured Thor reprints, from Journey into Mystery, {{including some of the}} Tales of Asgard. From #50, Spider-Man stories would be split, usually running over two consecutive weekly issues. Stories from The Spectacular Spider-Man (#72-74) and the Amazing Spider-Man annuals were also included (#9-10, 23, 75-76). Iron Man stories from Tales of Suspense were added from issue #50, with occasional <b>filler</b> <b>strips</b> from Amazing Adult Fantasy, World of Suspense, Mystic and Not Brand Echh. The first issue also promoted the UK branch of Marvel's new in-house fan club, FOOM.|$|R

5000|$|A Kirby science fiction/monster story, usually inked by Christopher Rule initially, then by Dick Ayers {{following}} Rule's retirement, would generally open each book. This {{was followed}} by one or two twist-ending thrillers or sci-fi tales drawn by Don Heck, Paul Reinman, or Joe Sinnott, all capped by an often-surreal, sometimes self-reflexive Lee-Ditko short. Lee in 2009 described these [...] "short, five-page <b>filler</b> <b>strips</b> that Steve and I did together", originally [...] "placed in any of our comics that had a few extra pages to fill", as [...] "odd fantasy tales that I'd dream up with O.

40|$|A flexible, {{adjustable}} refractory filler is disclosed {{for filling}} gaps between ceramic tiles forming the heat shield {{of a space}} shuttle vehicle, to protect its aluminum skin during atmospheric reentry. The easily installed and replaced filler consists essentially of a strip of ceramic cloth coated, at least along both its longitudinal edges with a room temperature vulcanizable silicone rubber compound with a high emittance colored pigment. The filler may have one or more layers as the gap width requires. Preferred materials are basket weave aluminoborosilicate cloth, and a rubber compounded with silicon tetraboride as the emittance agent and finely divided borosilicate glass containing about 7. 5 % B 2 O 3 as high temperature binder. The <b>filler</b> cloth <b>strip</b> or tape is cut to proper width and length, inserted into the gap, and fastened with previously applied drops of silicone rubber adhesive...|$|R

The basic method of the research is decrypting method and implementation by case study method. This research is done in PT Air Mancur. This location research is selected on purpose because PT Air Mancur is a factory that processing plant medicine becomes an herb product more than 40 years, this company doesn’t pay attention for feasibility analysis if economic age of machines finished, and data that needed for this research is available. Based on infestations criteria Pay Back Period (PBP), Net Present Value (NPV), Profitability Index (PI), and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) are know that all of investation alternatives and feasible to do. But then, the infestation alternative for buy for new Filling and Packaging Sachet Machine, Honey Liquid <b>Filler</b> Machine, Auto <b>strip</b> Packaging Machine, Coding Machine Daichi DH- 7, Ribbon Mixer Material Sus 304 Machine, Filling Sachet Machine, Honey Stick Machine, Coding Machine, Tank and Mixer Machine, Conveyor Machine, and Gear and Pump Brand Machine is the best alternative. This decision is taken based on value of infestation criteria NPV and PI for buying new machine alternative is more than value infestation criteria NPV and PI for repairing machine alternative. In expectation, this alternative give more benefit than repairing the old machine. The result of this research show that the reasonable alternative is buy for new machine of Filling and Packaging Sachet Machine, Honey Liquid <b>Filler</b> Machine, Auto <b>strip</b> Packaging Machine, Coding Machine Daichi DH- 7, Ribbon Mixer Material Sus 304 Machine, Filling Sachet Machine, Honey Stick Machine, Coding Machine, Tank and Mixer Machine, Conveyor Machine, and Gear and Pump Brand Machine.

PT Air Mancur should give attention for the economic age of machines. All this time this company operated machines although the economic age of machine is finished. This research showed that repairing old machine as an effort for elongate machine’s economic age is an unprofitable alternative than buy new machine...|$|R
40|$|Detectors {{based on}} {{polystyrene}} scintillator strips with WLS fiber readout {{are widely used}} to register charged particles in many high-energy physics experiments.

40|$|Work of {{adhesion}} (Wa) {{measurements are}} being studied for {{several types of}} polymer/metal combinations {{in order to obtain}} {{a better understanding of the}} adhesive failure mechanisms for systems containing encapsulated and bonded components. A primary concern is whether studies of model systems can be extended to systems of technological interest. One study performed in our laboratory involved the determination of Wa between silicone (PDMS) and Al surfaces in order to establish potential adhesive failure mechanisms. Our initial work with PDMS was based on Dow Corning 170 Sylgard. PDMS hemispheres were synthesized following the procedure outlined by Chaudhury and Whitesides where the <b>filler</b> was <b>stripped</b> from the commercial silicone by centrifuging. Wa between PDMS surfaces was determined using the JKR method. Our results for the Wa of PDMS were in agreement with those reported by Chaudhury and Whitesides. However, further JKR studies using these PDMS hemispheres on flat Al surfaces were fraught with difficulty. We could not discriminate hydrogen-bonding effects between Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } and hydroxyl groups in the PDMS and other possible bonding mechanisms. It was suggested that commercial systems contain inhibitors and additives that interfere with understanding the PMDS/Al interface. Therefore, the current study uses pure PDMS networks synthesized in our lab. Also, two contact mechanics methods were deployed to measure the Wa [...] JKR method using two hemispheres and a LEFM method using a cylinder containing a circumferential crack. This paper contains a description of the synthesis of the PDMS used for these studies and the determination of Wa between PDMS surfaces using the JKR method, contact angle measurements, and a LEFM method that consists of a cylinder containing a circumferential crack...|$|R
