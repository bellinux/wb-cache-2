5|$|In 2013, the MTA filed {{to change}} the {{location}} of Entrance 1, moving it onto <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk,</b> away from its original proposed location inside 301 East 69th Street. This was because designs for entrances inside the building failed to both satisfy the building's residents as well as meet the MTA's engineering requirements. With the New York City Department of Transportation planning a bike lane along {{the east side of}} Second Avenue after construction is finished, the MTA could widen the sidewalk {{to make room for the}} entrances without ultimately disrupting traffic flow.|$|E

Thirty minutes before the show began, Viacom security guards and New York City police officers were dispatched to remove all the fans <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk.</b> When some fans, including Robert Bruce, refused to move because it was a public street and no other individuals were asked to move, they were assaulted. All telephone requests for the video to be played were ignored, and Insane Clown Posse was never mentioned during the show. MTV later informed Island Records that the heads of the network must choose the band first before it can become eligible to be featured on TRL.|$|E
5|$|The {{details of}} the {{legislation}} were largely the work of architect George Ford. Ford had sympathies with the City Beautiful movement, disliked the unimaginative form of many New York skyscrapers, and had concerns over urban public health, but he also found tall buildings exciting and believed that horizontal visual unity produced boring architecture. As a consequence of Ford's influence, New York's laws were relatively complex and divided up the city into different zones; in each zone, a particular zoning envelope applied, controlling the height to which buildings could be built. Typically a building could only rise up <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> vertically by around , after which the building had to be set back at a set angle to allow sunlight to reach the street below. On {{a quarter of the}} site, however, the owner could build as high as they wished, without any further restrictions.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the fire, Bakersfield {{could best}} be {{described}} as a frontier town. Most of the buildings were constructed out of wood in a low density configuration. Buildings were also set back <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks.</b> <b>The</b> town did have a network of fire hydrants. Water was delivered by Scribner's Water Tower.|$|R

25|$|Following {{the bomb}} explosion, the entire South Oval was marked as off-limits with crime scene tape. Fans exited the stadium at the {{conclusion}} of the game without incident. The South Oval was open the next afternoon except for the immediate area of the explosion, so a broken glass door could be replaced and firefighters could finish spraying down the area with water to wash debris, chemicals and bodily fluids away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> and a bus parked there before the preceding day's game.

25|$|The numbers {{involved}} in this cottage industry were considerable: a rooftop bleacher could hold up to 80 people, with 18 more in the bay window of the front bedroom and more even on the porch roof. Viewers on the block could number up to several thousand for important games. Housewives served up refreshments for sale and children scurried to the hot dog vendors on the street, bought dogs for a nickel, and brought them back to sell for a dime. With so much money on the line, the business got organized and formalized very quickly; homeowners were soon squeezed for bribes by city amusement tax collectors, and city police collected commissions for collaring and herding fans <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> into particular homes. By 1929, the extra income from the rooftop bleachers actually caused real estate values to climb on the 2700 block of N. 20th Street.|$|E
500|$|... "Because of You" [...] is a piano ballad with {{a length}} of three minutes and 39 seconds. It is set in common time and has a {{moderate}} tempo of 69 beats per minute. The song is composed in the key of F minor, and then modulated to the key of G minor, with Clarkson's vocal range spanning over two octaves from Ab3 to Eb5. Tony Heywood of MusicOMH noted that the song's piano arrangement is reminiscent of Tori Amos. Lyrically, [...] "Because of You" [...] is a fiery ode to Clarkson's father, and begins with Clarkson singing [...] "oohs" [...] over a somber piano which creates a [...] "wintry tone."

500|$|Others {{argued that}} legal reform of {{skyscraper}} construction {{was needed for}} {{public health and safety}} reasons, an area in which U.S. law was normally more supportive of state intervention. The risk of fire was one concern; while skyscrapers might be relatively fireproof, their height made conventional fire-fighting difficult. Architect Charles Bragdon considered a large scale, devastating high-rise fire to be inevitable if regulation was not forthcoming. The Baltimore fire of 1904 was widely cited as an example of this risk and, although Baltimore had few high rise buildings, city lawyers argued that the taller buildings had caused the flames to spread through the city during the blaze. Baltimore subsequently passed a law in 1904, banning buildings higher than [...] Other campaigners argued that skyscrapers were compromising access to light and air, noting that when tall buildings rose straight up <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk,</b> they cast long shadows across the street, preventing healthy sunlight from reaching smaller buildings below.|$|E
500|$|The {{height of}} {{buildings}} in Washington {{is limited by}} the Height of Buildings Act. The original Act was passed by Congress in 1899 in response to the 1894 construction of the Cairo Hotel, which is much taller than the majority of buildings in the city. The original act restricted the heights of any type of building in the United States capital city of Washington, D.C., to be no higher than , [...] for residential buildings. In 1910, the 61st United States Congress enacted a new law which raised the overall building height limit to , but restricted building heights to the width of the adjacent street or avenue plus thus, a building facing a -wide street could be only [...] tall. However, building heights are measured <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> or curb {{to the edge of the}} roof. Architectural embellishments, mechanical rooms, and common rooftop structures may be exempted from the overall height limit, provided they are set back from the roof line. The heights of buildings listed here may therefore exceed the general height limit as measured for the purpose of the city's zoning laws.|$|E

The cost of the two buildings, exclusive of the furnishings but including the land, was about $15 million. The assessed value in 1897 was $12,125,000, making it the next most valuable parcel on Fifth Avenue, after the B. Altman and Company site.

500|$|The Chrysler Building did {{not have}} the {{standard}} 1920s-skyscraper design of columns with a decorative base, plain shaft and decorative capitals; instead, the entire skyscraper contains ornate ornamental features. The building's height and the legally mandated setbacks influenced Van Alen toward this design. The walls of the lowermost sixteen floors rise directly <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> property lines, except for a hole on one side that gives the building a [...] "U"-shaped floor plan above the fourth floor. There are setbacks on floors 16, 18, 23, 28, and 31, making the building compliant with the Zoning Law of 1916. This gives the building the appearance of a ziggurat {{on one side and a}} U-shaped palazzo on the other. Above the 31st floor, there are no more setbacks until the 60th floor, upon which the structure funnels into a Maltese cross shape that [...] "blends the square shaft to the finial", according to author and photographer Cervin Robinson.

The New York World Building on Park Row, was the first to take the title in 1890, standing [...] until 1955, when it was demolished to construct a new ramp to the Brooklyn Bridge.
