5|$|In {{addition}} to criticism, his ideas were often oversimplified, misrepresented, distorted or exaggerated for various purposes. This heightened the controversy.

5|$|There were {{initially}} no other major controversies for Dunstan, although the economy remained {{poor and the}} Redcliff complex was still in limbo as an agreement with Dow was still to be finalised. The financial difficulties forced a freeze on public sector expansion and hospital <b>developments,</b> <b>and</b> there were claims of theft and mismanagement in the health system, but the Liberals were in a disorganised state and unpopular, so {{they were not able}} to pressure Dunstan effectively.|$|E
5|$|Airline {{customers}} were uninterested in the 767-X proposals, and instead wanted an even wider fuselage cross-section, fully flexible interior configurations, short- to intercontinental-range capability, and a operating cost lower than any 767 stretch. Airline planners' requirements for larger aircraft had become increasingly specific, {{adding to the}} heightened competition among aircraft manufacturers. By 1988, Boeing realized that the only answer was a new clean–sheet design, which became the 777 twinjet. The company opted for the twin-engine configuration given past design successes, projected engine <b>developments,</b> <b>and</b> reduced-cost benefits. On December 8, 1989, Boeing began issuing offers to airlines for the 777.|$|E

5|$|By the 18th century local {{residents}} had built summer houses {{on top of}} the walls, which were still largely intact. During the next hundred years city and town walls across England began to be demolished to make way for new <b>developments,</b> <b>and</b> Worcester proved no exception. By {{the end of the century}} the walls and gates were being sold off and destroyed; Friar's Gate was probably the last to be demolished, early in the 19th century.

5|$|Conventional {{real estate}} {{development}} and urban planning activities are subject to conflicting interests and positional bargaining. The integrative negotiation approach emphasises mutual gains. The approach has been applied in land use planning and environmental management, but has not {{been used as a}} coordinated approach to {{real estate development}}, city design, and urban planning. Urban design management involves reordering the chain of events in the production of the built environment according to the principles of integrative negotiation. Such negotiation can be used in urban development and planning activities to reach more efficient agreements.

5|$|Differing {{theories}} {{have been proposed}} regarding {{the origins of the}} Vijayanagara empire. Many historians propose that Harihara I and Bukka I, the founders of the empire, were Kannadigas and commanders in the army of the Hoysala Empire stationed in the Tungabhadra region to ward off Muslim invasions from the Northern India. Others claim that they were Telugu people, first associated with the Kakatiya Kingdom, who took control of the northern parts of the Hoysala Empire during its decline. Irrespective of their origin, historians agree the founders were supported and inspired by Vidyaranya, a saint at the Sringeri monastery to fight the Muslim invasion of South India. Writings by foreign travelers during the late medieval era combined with recent excavations in the Vijayanagara principality have uncovered much-needed information about the empire's history, fortifications, scientific <b>developments</b> <b>and</b> architectural innovations.|$|E
5|$|In early 1859, at {{the close}} of a {{turbulent}} period, Wallachia and Moldavia entered a personal union, later formalized as the Romanian United Principalities, under Moldavian-born Domnitor Alexandru Ioan Cuza (himself a former revolutionary). Having been allowed to return from exile after the Treaty of Paris, most of the surviving revolutionaries played a major part in the political <b>developments,</b> <b>and</b> organized themselves as Partida Națională, which promoted Cuza during simultaneous elections for the ad hoc Divans. The role of Paris-based Wallachian émigrés in promoting sympathy for common Romanian goals was decisive. Partida succeeded in becoming the major factor in Romanian political life, before forming the basis of the liberal current. With Cuza's rule, the pace of Westernization increased, and, during the 1860s, a moderate land reform was carried out, monastery estates were secularized, while corvées and boyar ranks were outlawed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1930s Highland Airways {{looked into the}} {{possibility}} of including Stroma in the hospital ambulance plane service that was then in operation. On 19 August 1937, Captain Fresson of Highland Airways landed a small aircraft in farmland adjoining the Mains of Stroma, and the following spring the islanders cleared an area of moorland {{on the west side}} of the island to create an airstrip. The first official flight landed in June 1938. However, the Second World War prevented any further <b>developments</b> <b>and</b> a regular service was not established. After the war, Highland Airways was taken over by British European Airways, which abandoned any interest in serving the island.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{relationship}} between financial <b>development,</b> technological <b>development</b> <b>and</b> economic growth in Romania.

Financial <b>development</b> <b>and</b> technological <b>development</b> contribute to economic growth. Moreover, financial development leads technological development which Granger causes economic growth. Our empirical evidence suggest that economic growth is driven by financial development via technological <b>development</b> <b>and</b> that, in Romania,a stable financial system and capital market can facilitate technological innovations. ...|$|R

5|$|On 11 September 1966, Cambodia {{held its}} first open election. Through {{manipulation}} and harassment (and to Sihanouk's surprise) the conservatives won 75 percent of {{the seats in the}} National Assembly. Lon Nol was chosen by the right as prime minister and, as his deputy, they named Prince Sirik Matak; an ultraconservative member of the Sisowath branch of the royal clan and long-time enemy of Sihanouk. In addition to these <b>developments</b> <b>and</b> the clash of interests among Phnom Penh's politicized elite, social tensions created a favorable environment for the growth of a domestic communist insurgency in the rural areas.|$|E
5|$|The Livonian Order {{used their}} {{alliance}} with Mindaugas {{to gain control}} over Samogitian lands. In 1252 he approved the Order's construction of Klaipeda Castle. Their governance, however, was seen as oppressive. Local merchants could only conduct transactions via Order-approved intermediaries; inheritance laws were changed; and the choices among marriage partners and residencies were restricted. Several pitched battles ensued. In 1259 the Order lost the Battle of Skuodas, and in 1260 it lost the Battle of Durbe. The first defeat encouraged a rebellion by the Semigalians, and the defeat at Durbe spurred the Prussians into the Great Prussian Rebellion, which lasted for 14 years. Encouraged by these <b>developments</b> <b>and</b> by his nephew Treniota, Mindaugas broke peace with the Order. The gains he had expected from Christianization had proven to be minor.|$|E
5|$|The {{invention}} of the transistor in the 1950s, a key active component in practically all modern electronics, led to many technological <b>developments</b> <b>and</b> a significant expansion of the U.S. technology industry.

Advancements by American microprocessor companies such as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Intel along with both computer software and hardware companies that include Adobe Systems, Apple Inc., IBM, Microsoft, and Sun Microsystems created and popularized the personal computer. The ARPANET was developed in the 1960s to meet Defense Department requirements, and became {{the first of a series}} of networks which evolved into the Internet.|$|E

5|$|World War II {{prompted}} {{major changes}} in Southern Rhodesia's financial and military policy, and accelerated the process of industrialisation. The territory's participation in the EATS brought about major economic and infrastructural <b>developments</b> <b>and</b> led to the post-war immigration of many former airmen, contributing {{to the growth of}} the white population to over double its pre-war size by 1951. The war remained prominent in the national consciousness for decades afterwards. Since the country's reconstitution as Zimbabwe in 1980, the modern government has removed many references to the World Wars, such as memorial monuments and plaques, from public view, regarding them as unwelcome vestiges of white minority rule and colonialism. Southern Rhodesia's dead of the war today have no official commemoration, either in Zimbabwe or overseas.|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} months, international efforts mainly concerned the largely unsuccessful United Nations Safe Areas {{set up in}} Bosnia and Herzegovina and {{trying to set up}} a more lasting ceasefire in Croatia. The two issues virtually merged by July 1995 when a number of the safe areas in eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina were overrun and one in Bihać was threatened. In 1994, Croatia had already signaled that it would not allow Bihać to be captured, and a new confidence in the Croatian military's ability to recapture occupied areas brought about a demand from Croatian authorities that no further ceasefires were to be negotiated; the occupied territories would be re-integrated into Croatia. These <b>developments</b> <b>and</b> the Washington Agreement, a ceasefire signed in the Bosnian theater, led to another meeting of presidents of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina on 22 July, when the Split Agreement was adopted. In it, Bosnia and Herzegovina invited Croatia to provide military and other assistance, particularly in the Bihać area. Croatia accepted, committing itself to an armed intervention.|$|E

40|$|Background: Although {{enterprise}} <b>development</b> <b>and</b> supplier <b>development</b> are {{two distinct}} concepts in the organisational and management literature, the Broad-based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) legislation {{refers to the}} enterprise <b>development</b> <b>and</b> supplier <b>development</b> as a single concept. As a result, many companies have a single policy, strategy and structural arrangements to manage enterprise <b>development</b> <b>and</b> supplier <b>development</b> programs <b>and</b> activities, thereby conflating the two concepts. Objectives: The aim of this conceptual article was to propose an implementation framework for enterprise <b>and</b> supplier <b>development</b> <b>and</b> to show the rationale of keeping enterprise <b>development</b> <b>and</b> supplier <b>development</b> as two distinct but related activities. Method: The conceptual article provided {{an overview of the}} policy context regarding enterprise development, followed by a discussion on enterprise <b>development</b> <b>and</b> its complexities. The article drew from the literature on supplier <b>development</b> <b>and</b> from the supplier adaptation, relational view, and learning and knowledge perspective theories in the development of its argument. Results: The article presented an implementation framework for enterprise <b>and</b> supplier <b>development</b> <b>and</b> then concluded with some recommendations and direction for future research. Conclusion: The implications of this research have great value for organisations as they prepare to implement Enterprise <b>and</b> supplier <b>development</b> (ESD) programmes. The proposed framework will also contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the ESD process and the link between enterprise <b>development</b> <b>and</b> supplier <b>development</b> processes. </p...|$|R
