40|$|In this study, we {{analyze the}} {{association}} between <b>industrial</b> <b>activity</b> and the occurrence of 34 congenital anomalies. We selected 21 counties in Argentina during 1982 - 1994 and examined a total of 614, 796 births in these counties in consecutive series. We used the International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (United Nations, 1968) {{as an indicator of}} exposure to 80 specific <b>industrial</b> <b>activities.</b> Incidence <b>rate</b> ratios for each congenital anomaly were adjusted by the socioeconomic level of the county according to a census index of social deprivation. For a given exposure/anomaly association to be considered as significant and relevant, the exposure had to be a statistically significant risk for the occurrence of the anomaly and an increase in the birth prevalence rate of the congenital anomaly type involved had to be observed in those counties where the putative causal activity was being performed. Significant associations (p < 0. 01) were identified between textile industry and anencephaly, and between the manufacture of engines and turbines and microcephaly. These observations are consistent with previous reports on occupational exposure, and their further investigation by means of case-control studies is recommended...|$|R
40|$|The Austrian {{economy grew}} at a {{seasonally}} and working day adjusted rate of 0. 7 percent in real terms quarter-on-quarter {{in the fourth quarter}} of 2007. The growth rate for the year 2007 as a whole was 3. 4 percent in real terms. Export-oriented production, without exception a mainstay of economic activity, still expanded at a vigorous pace also at year-end. The developments of order volumes in the first quarter of 2008 suggest a slowdown in <b>industrial</b> <b>activity,</b> however. Exchange <b>rate</b> fluctuations in international financial markets increase the uncertainties surrounding the outlook for the economy, and, coupled with accelerated consumer price inflation dampen consumer confidence.

40|$|Long-term {{ecological}} sustainability {{is incompatible with}} an open materials cycle. The toxic heavy metals (arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, mercury, silver, uranium/plutonium, zinc) exemplify the problem. These metals are being mobilized and dispersed into the environment by <b>industrial</b> <b>activity</b> at a <b>rate</b> far higher than by natural processes. Apart from losses to the environment resulting from mine wastes and primary processing, many of these metals are utilized in products that are inherently dissipative. Examples of such uses include fuels, lubricants, solvents, fire retardants, stabilizers, flocculants, pigments, biocides, and preservatives. To close the materials cycle, {{it will be necessary}} to accomplish two things. The first is to ban or otherwise discourage (e. g., by means of high severance taxes on virgin materials) dissipative uses of the above type. The second is to increase the efficiency of recycling of those materials that are not replaceable in principle. Here, also, economic instruments (such as returnable deposits) can be effective in some cases. A systems view of the problem is essential to assess the cost and effectiveness of alternative strategies...|$|R
40|$|Abstract We {{investigate}} the ongoing seismicity in the Raton Basin {{and find that}} the deep injection of wastewater from the coal-bed methane field is responsible for inducing {{the majority of the}} seismicity since 2001. Many lines of evidence indicate that this earthquake sequence was induced by wastewater injection. First, there was a marked increase in seismicity shortly after major fluid injection began in the Raton Basin in 1999. From 1972 through July 2001, there was one M ≥ 4 earthquake in the Raton Basin, whereas 12 occurred between August 2001 and 2013. The statistical likelihood that such a rate change would occur if earthquakes behaved randomly in time is 3. 0 %. Moreover, this rate change is limited to the area of <b>industrial</b> <b>activity.</b> Earthquake <b>rates</b> remain low in the surrounding area. Second, {{the vast majority of the}} seismicity is within 5 km of active disposal wells and is shallow, ranging between 2 and 8 km depth. The two most carefully studied earthquake sequences in 2001 and 2011 have earthquakes within 2 km of high-volume, high-injection-rate wells. Third, injection wells in the area are commonly very high volume and high rate. Two wells adjacent to the August 2011 M 5. 3 earthquake injected about 4. 9 million cubic meters of wastewater before the earthquake, more than seven times the amount injected at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal well that caused damaging earthquakes near Denver, Colorado, in the 1960 s. The August 2011 M 5. 3 event is the second-largest earthquake to date for which there is clear evidence that the earthquake sequence was induced by fluid injection.

40|$|Hedonic pricing methods {{typically}} {{employ a}} distance-to-site variable to measure variation in exposure to environmental disamenities. Some environmental disamenities, like hazardous waste sites, may be spatially correlated with another prominent {{feature of the}} urban plain zones of <b>industrial</b> <b>activity.</b> In these cases, failure to account for <b>industrial</b> <b>activity</b> is hypothesized to bias coefficient estimates of the distance-to-site measure. The data set includes a distance-to-site measure {{as well as a}} distance-to-industrial measure. These measures allow for empirical estimations of the hedonic price function that distinguish the property value effect associated with exposure to hazard from the property value effect associated with <b>industrial</b> <b>activity.</b> The results suggest that failure to account for <b>industrial</b> <b>activity</b> will overstate the effect of hazardous waste sites on property values and inflate benefit estimates associated with hazardous waste clean-up.
