50|$|The Tapiche River basin in {{the area}} of the reserve {{exhibits}} a landscape containing alluvial plains and associated floodplains. The floodplains of the alluvial landscape encompass swamps or aguajales; while the non-flooded plains appear as undulating terraces. There are hilly landscapes within the reserve which appear as gently sloping lowland terrain. Swamps have developed on flat land and in depressions formed by fibric <b>histosol</b> soils with pH values varying between 3.5 and 5. In these swamps, there are four representative botanical families, including: Moraceae, Fabaceae, Annonaceae and Arecaceae. Also found are catahua (Hura crepitans), strangler fig (Ficus sp.), machimango (Eschweilera sp.), and caupuri (Virola pavonis), aguaje (Mauritia flexuosa), shapaja (Attalea phalerata), cashapona (Socratea exorrhiza), renaco (Ficus trigona), espintana (Oxandra espintana) and huimba (Pachira aquatica).|$|E

50|$|<b>Histosols</b> form {{whenever}} {{organic matter}} forms {{at a more}} rapid rate than it is destroyed. This occurs because of restricted drainage precluding aerobic decomposition, {{and the remains of}} plants and animals remain within the soil. Thus, <b>histosols</b> are very important ecologically because they, and gelisols, store large quantities of organic carbon. If accumulation continues for a long enough period, coal forms.|$|R
50|$|In {{both the}} FAO soil {{classification}} and the USDA soil taxonomy, a <b>histosol</b> is a soil consisting primarily of organic materials. They {{are defined as}} having 40 cm or more of organic soil material in the upper 80 cm. Organic soil material has an organic carbon content (by weight) of 12 to 18 percent, or more, depending on the clay content of the soil. These materials include muck (sapric soil material), mucky peat (hemic soil material), or peat (fibric soil material). Aquic conditions or artificial drainage are required. Typically, histosols have very low bulk density and are poorly drained because the organic matter holds water very well. Most are acidic and many are very deficient in major plant nutrients which are washed away in the consistently moist soil.|$|E
5000|$|As Saint Columb's Rill moves northeast, {{it flows}} across acidic Sphagnum peatlands towards {{the village of}} Bushmills. In {{addition}} to acidity, <b>histosol</b> soils like peat give the water its brown colour and distinctive flavour and this has made Saint Columb's Rill highly prized for brewing and distilling. It is essential {{that the quality of}} this Rill is monitored to ensure that it remains unpolluted and this role is carried out by the Northern Ireland Environment Agency. [...] In 2012 a polluting discharge was stopped after being discovered by a Water Quality Inspector and the person responsible faced court action. After harvesting, peat is known as turf and by the late eighteenth century it was the main fuel in Ireland. The lure of special Saint Columb's Rill water combined with an abundant supply of local peat for fuel, resulted in five licensed distilleries [...] being situated in the vicinity of Bushmills.

50|$|Metrosideros polymorpha {{may occur}} as a tall tree or a {{prostrate}} shrub, and everything in between. Preferred soils are acidic to neutral (pH 3.6-7.4) and either a <b>Histosol,</b> Mollisol, Podsol, Oxisol, Ultisol, or Alfisol. Rainfall of 1000 - 3000 mm per year is favored, but ōhia can grow in dry forests that receive as little as 400 mm or bogs that get more than 10000 mm of rain. On moist, deep soils, ōhia grows to 20 - 25 m high. Specimens reaching 30 m high are on record. The trunk varies in form. In some trees, it is straight and smooth; in others, it is twisted and prominently fluted. Trees growing in forests often have stilt roots, having germinated on logs or the stems of fallen hāpuu (Cibotium tree ferns), which have long decayed away when the tree has reached maturity. Some trees have fibrous aerial roots to gather moisture. At high elevations, and in areas with poor soils or little rainfall, shrub forms are the norm. Flowers are usually bright to medium red but orange-red, salmon, pink, yellow, or orange forms are also found. The flowers appear in clusters on the terminal ends of the branches. Masses of stamens extend from the flower and give the blossoms their characteristic pom-pom shape.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{creation}} and restoration of new wetlands to mitigate wetland losses is a newly developing science whose success {{still needs to}} be assessed. This study focuses on the ecological restoration of a gravel-pit in the low valley of the Seine estuary (France). Restoration consisted in filling the gravel-pit using a hydraulic technique with dredged sediments from the Seine river and covering it with alkaline peat from adjacent wet meadows. Our objectives were to survey the functions of recreated soil 3 years after the gravel-pit was filled and assess whether it regained typical wetland functionality and to determine which soil functioning parameters are the most efficient for assessing restoration success. To address these questions, an approach combining analyses of in situ and ex situ soil functioning was used. The survey was conducted on recreated soil as compared to a control soil (i. e. soil before gravel extraction). Four topographic zones were sampled corresponding to 4 types of recreated soil functioning in terms of waterlogging conditions: Hemic <b>Histosol</b> without waterlogged periods, Hemic <b>Histosol</b> with temporary waterlogged periods, Hemic <b>Histosol</b> with the longest waterlogged periods and Interstratified <b>Histosol</b> without waterlogged periods. Soil respiration and SIR results showed that large stocks of organic matter are maintained after 3 years of restoration and proved able to sequester C in recreated soils. 3 years after restoration, nitrogen removal function measured through denitrification technique was restored in the Hemic <b>Histosol</b> with the longest waterlogged periods. These results demonstrate that waterlogging regime maintain the C stock and accelerate the restoration of denitrification process...|$|E
40|$|Large {{peatland}} {{areas have}} been identified in French Guiana, an equatorial province (département) of France, but the exact distribution and ecological condition of mires is not well known. Maps of pedological and agronomic units that were prepared between the early 1950 s and 1975 enable us to improve on previously published estimates of <b>Histosol</b> areas in French Guiana. Only the non-forested parts of the province have been studied because there are hardly any pedological maps for the portion that lies within the Amazon rainforest. The extent of Histosols recorded in French Guiana is around 975 km², which is 57 – 60 % of the estimates of peatland area (1620 km² and 1720 km²) reported in the scientific literature. The largest <b>Histosol</b> areas are located near the coast in the north-east of the province, between Cayenne and the border with Brazil. This region receives the highest annual rainfall recorded in French Guiana and provides a particularly favourable hydro-geomorphological setting for peat formation. It will be necessary to explore these large <b>Histosol</b> areas in order to characterise them and to study the associated mire vegetation. Difficult access, combined with the adverse hydro-climatic conditions, will make this a long-term endeavour...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the chemical properties of peat soil depending on changes in land-use. The Terric <b>Histosol</b> (HSs) was investigated in this research, and the treatments of former different land-use in Radviliškis site. Chemical analyses were carried out at the Chemical Research Laboratory of LRCAF. After 12 years since the end of field experiment the differences in soil chemical composition remained still between treatments of differently used peat soil. Due to mineralization, the content of soil organic matter (SOM) and SOC respectively decreased, the largest amounts of SOC are stored in the upper soil layer of perennial grasses fertilized with NPK (NPK), there was the highest yield of biomass; and accordingly, the lowest content of SOC – in soil of un-used peat (UU). The distribution of total N and P in profile of Terric <b>Histosol</b> is directly related to the vertical gradient of mineralization intensity; higher amounts of N and P have been accumulated where mineralization was more intense. The distribution of total K is related to land-use of Terric <b>Histosol,</b> whereas the biggest quantity of total K was established in arable land which has been fertilized with mineral fertilisers...|$|E

40|$|Nitrous oxide is a {{greenhouse}} gas contributing to stratospheric ozone depletion with major sources {{that derive from}} soils. Most measurements were performed at well-aerated or anaerobic sites, excluding common hydromorphic soils (e. g., Gleysols). The main thesis {{of this study was}} that the intermediate aeration of such soils promotes N 2 O emissions. The investigated catena "Wildmooswald,'' which is little more than 200 m long, includes common temperate forest soils (n= 7) of three aeration categories (Cambisols, Gleysols, and <b>Histosol).</b> The influence of fluctuating water tables of the Gleysols led to distinctively higher N 2 O release compared to the Cambisol within the same mature Norway spruce ecosystem. Even a stable "hot spot'' of N 2 O emissions was detected at a <b>Histosol,</b> where artificial drainage created a redox environment comparable to the Gleysols. Ranking the soils according to emission rate results in fairly regular doubling steps; for example, mean annual flux rates in kg N ha(- 1) yr(- 1) for the 2. 5 years of measurements were - 0. 1, 0. 4, 1. 0, 1. 9 / 1. 9, 3. 2, and 6. 4 for Fibric <b>Histosol,</b> Chromic Cambisol, Endoskeletic Cambisol, Histic Gleysol 1 / 2, Humic Gleysol, and Sapric <b>Histosol,</b> respectively. The annual emission rates (0. 93 kg N ha(- 1) yr(- 1)) of the predominant Cambisols (63. 4 % of the area) are comparable to other studies, but only 34. 3 % of intermediately aerated soils led to a redoubling of the average to 1. 86 kg N ha(- 1) yr(- 1), which is clearly higher than previously presented from temperate forests. Therefore N 2 O releases of soils are underestimated if soils having intermediate aeration conditions are left unconsidered. [References: 42...|$|E
40|$|Soil can {{be either}} source or sink of methane (CH 4), {{depending}} on the balance between methanogenesis and methanotrophy, which are determined by pedological, climatic and management factors. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the impact of drainage of a highland Haplic <b>Histosol</b> on CH 4 fluxes. Field research was carried out in Ponta Grossa (Paraná, Brazil) based on the measurement of CH 4 fluxes by the static chamber method in natural and drained <b>Histosol,</b> over one year (17 sampling events). The natural <b>Histosol</b> showed net CH 4 eflux, with rates varying from 238 ?g m- 2 h- 1 CH 4, in cool/cold periods, to 2, 850 ?g m- 2 h- 1 CH 4, in warm/hot periods, resulting a cumulative emission of 116 kg ha- 1 yr- 1 CH 4. In the opposite, the drained <b>Histosol</b> showed net influx of CH 4 (- 39 to - 146 ?g m- 2 h- 1), which resulted in a net consumption of 9 kg ha- 1 yr- 1 CH 4. The main driving factors of CH 4 consumption in the drained soil were the lowering of the water-table (on average - 57 cm, vs - 7 cm in natural soil) and the lower water content in the 0 - 10 cm layer (average of 5. 5 kg kg- 1, vs 9. 9 kg kg- 1 in natural soil). Although waterlogged Histosols of highland areas are regarded as CH 4 sources, they fulfill fundamental functions in the ecosystem, such as the accumulation of organic carbon (581 Mg ha- 1 C to a depth of 1 m) and water (8. 6 million L ha- 1 = 860 mm to a depth of 1 m). For this reason, these soils must not be drained as an alternative to mitigate CH 4 emission, but effectively preserved. 201...|$|E

40|$|A typical upland soil catena {{afforested}} with Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.) {{was chosen}} to examine the localised effect of trees on soil permeability. A borehole permeameter {{was used to measure}} soil permeability at 0. 2 m and approximately 2 m distance from the stem of 20 trees at a fixed measurement depth of 0. 25 to 0. 45 m. In the case of the near-tree measurements, this corresponded to soil beneath the main root plate of each conifer. Two principal elements of the soil catena: the ferric podzol of the mid-slope and <b>histosol</b> soil of the foot-slope were investigated. The preliminary data set shows that within the ferric podzol element, the permeability of the soil beneath individual conifers was a factor of 5. 4 less than that of the adjacent soil. In contrast, within the <b>histosol</b> sub-tree permeabilities could not be distinguished from those of soil 2 m away from each tree. The decrease in sub-tree permeability within the podzol may be caused by sensitivity of the Bsl horizon to consolidation by tree weight or by enhanced illuviation resulting from changes in local soil chemistry. The <b>histosol</b> may be less sensitive to such processes. The results of a consolidation test applied to the Rawls and Brakensiek model of soil permeability supported the possible role of consolidation in the reduction of soil permeability beneath conifers in podzolic soil. Additional data on soil bulk density, porosity and texture are required to corroborate either the consolidation or illuviation hypotheses. As the Bsl horizon of ferric podzol soil is typically slowly permeable, a further decline may (i) restrict root development and thus, increase windthrow hazard, and (ii) increase the lateral flow of water within podzolic Eag horizons and thus affect stream acidification. Deep ploughing of a site prior to afforestation may mitigate such impacts...|$|E
