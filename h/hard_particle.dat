We applied the method to study the phase transition behavior of monodispersed infinitely thin square platelets. First, we equilibrated the square platelet system for different reduced pressures with a usual isobaric Monte Carlo (MC) simulation and obtained a reduced pressure-chemical potential plot. Then we introduce the parametrized potential to interpolate the system between the ideal gas and the hard particles. After selecting the potential, we performed isochoric MC runs, ranging from the ideal gas to the <b>hard</b> <b>particle</b> limit. Through an iterative procedure, we compute the free energy and the chemical potential of the square platelet system by evaluating the volume of the phase space attributed to the hard particles, and then we find the coexistence pressure of the system.

40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{understanding of}} physical phenomena {{has always been}} of importance to the utilization and discovery of new technologies. While the desired properties may change, the need to continually characterize the behavior of various systems does not diminish. Here, we discuss initial investigations of the thermophysical properties of various model colloidal dispersions. ^ In several colloidal systems, the interactions that develop between colloidal particles are due mainly to entropic forces. Hence, these systems are conveniently modeled as fluids of non-interacting hard particles to which non-idealities can be later added. Despite their apparent simplicity, <b>hard</b> <b>particle</b> systems exhibit {{a wide variety of}} complex behaviors, many of which are seen in real systems. By continuing to refine the theoretical approaches to the study of <b>hard</b> <b>particle</b> fluids, we will better understand entropic forces in colloidal dispersions. ^ We begin by examining a general binary <b>hard</b> <b>particle</b> system with various non-idealities. In one dimension, we exactly determine all the thermophysical properties of this system. We also investigate the effect that non-idealities, like van der Waals attractions, have on the phase behavior of this model system. This study emphasizes the need for accurate description of <b>hard</b> <b>particle</b> fluids in higher-dimensional systems. ^ We next focus on improving the theoretical description of the <b>hard</b> <b>particle</b> fluid. The well-established statistical geometric approach of scaled particle theory (SPT) is chosen as the starting point due to its reliance on exact equations and intuitively physical arguments. We derive new additional exact equations for SPT, one of which contains a three-body correlation function that must be approximated. We generate a simple but accurate closure to this function. The resulting SPT predictions are now the order of accuracy of current equations of state. ^ Finally, we extend the SPT approach to a hard sphere mixture. All of the exact equations for the pure component fluid are valid for the mixture. The resultant predictions are an improvement over the previous SPT formulations, though the range over which a solution of the equations can be obtained is limited by the particles 2 ̆ 7 diameter ratio. For certain properties, SPT is now comparable to other current equations of state. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{morphology}} and viscoelastic {{properties of}} films prepared from bimodal latex blends containing equal weight fractions of soft and <b>hard</b> latex <b>particles</b> were investigated {{as a function}} of the particle sizes and the particle size ratio (soft particle diameter/hard particle diameter). Minimum film formation temperature (MFT) measurements were associated with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to emphasize the particle size ratio dependence of the film formation properties. A significant increase of the MFT values with the soft/hard particle size ratio was observed. As long as the particle size ratio was low, TEM micrographs showed that the film forming soft particles, undergoing complete coalescence, clearly act as the continuous phase where the non film forming <b>hard</b> <b>particles</b> are found evenly dispersed while keeping their initial spherical shape. At higher values of the particle size ratio, TEM micrographs pointed out that the soft particles are prevented from coming into contact with each other by the surrounding <b>hard</b> <b>particles,</b> therefore dramatically increasing the MFT of the sample and resulting in a non film forming latex blend. The existence of a critical volume fraction of <b>hard</b> <b>particles</b> that is directly related to the soft/hard particle size ratio was then established on the basis of geometrical arguments involving the percolation theory. The higher the particle size ratio, the lower the critical volume fraction of <b>hard</b> <b>particles</b> that leads to a macroscopic phase inversion resulting in a non film forming bimodal latex blend. Subsequently, the mechanical film properties were investigated by solid-state dynamic mechanical analysis. The size of the dispersed hard phase was found to affect the final viscoelastic film properties.

Throughout the thermal annealing, the latex blend morphologies were also followed with atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). A particulate morphology, consisting of <b>hard</b> <b>particles</b> evenly dispersed in a continuous soft phase, was observed in the TEM micrographs of the as-dried latex blends and resulted in an enhancement of the mechanical film properties at temperatures between the a relaxations of the soft and hard phases in the DMA thermograms.
