5|$|In December 2013, Burger King {{returned}} to Finland after {{three decades of}} absence. The first restaurant, located on Mannerheimintie in central Helsinki, instantly proved so popular that for every day since its opening, people have had to queue {{in front of the}} restaurant to get in, sometimes for over half an hour. The only exception so far has been Christmas time, when the restaurant was closed. According to Mikko Molberg, the leader of the Finnish Burger King franchise, the restaurant has attracted over 2000 customers on <b>every</b> <b>single</b> <b>day,</b> which has surprised the restaurant employees and the franchise owners. The long queues have been extensively covered and ridiculed in social media, comparing them to people queuing in front of a McDonald's restaurant in Moscow, Russia in the early 1990s, and contrasting them with the nearly nonexistent queues to Burger King restaurants in Stockholm, Sweden.|$|E

25|$|At times, Don Eleuterio {{has been}} accused of mistreating his son, {{particularly}} because he never changes the family diet; since the only decent cooking recipe Eleuterio knows was the one he learned as attendant of a mess hall while in the Army (and since cooking anything more extravagant would be, in his view, effeminate), he feeds his son steamed white rice, mashed potatoes and canned corn <b>every</b> <b>single</b> <b>day</b> (and sometimes for both lunch and dinner).|$|E

This study investigates the potential of three major biomass energy resources available in Pakistan: Livestock, Bagasse and Municipal Solid Waste for either power generation or sustainable transportation. These origins may yield up to 29. 7 million cubic meter of biogas daily. The results of this study also suggests that biomass energy can contribute a fraction of approximately 24 % in the total electric power generation in the current situation while the potential contribution is very low i. e. 0. 2 % for transportation when compared at the same node. Detailed feasibility studies and technological advancements are needed to introduce biogas into transportation as an alternate fuel. The outcomes of this comparitive analysis might also be applicable to other developing countries having similar resources...|$|R

500|$|The title California is {{representative}} of the band's home state, and was picked after the band members realized that they had written multiple songs relating to its cities and culture.

[...] Though he refrained from dubbing it a concept album, Skiba considered the songs linked thematically: [...] "big and bright and huge and dark and twisted, everything that California is." [...] "The title of this album {{was one of the most}} difficult things I've done in my entire life," [...] said Hoppus. Alternate titles for the album included No Future, which was dropped because it seemed too negative, and the joke titles OB-GYN Kenobi, Nude Erection, and No Hard Feelings.

500|$|The {{exhaust gases}} {{produced}} by rocket propulsion systems, both in Earth's atmosphere and in space, can adversely effect the Earth's environment. Some hypergolic rocket propellants, such as hydrazine, are highly toxic prior to combustion, but decompose into less toxic compounds after burning. Rockets using hydrocarbon fuels, such as kerosene, release {{carbon dioxide and}} soot in their exhaust. However, carbon dioxide emissions are insignificant compared to those from other sources; on average, the United States consumed [...] gallons of liquid fuels per day in 2014, while a single Falcon 9 rocket first stage burns around [...] of kerosene fuel per launch. Even if a Falcon 9 were launched <b>every</b> <b>single</b> <b>day,</b> it would only represent 0.006% of liquid fuel consumption (and carbon dioxide emissions) for that day. Additionally, the exhaust from LOx- and LH2- fueled engines, like the SSME, is almost entirely water vapor. NASA addressed environmental concerns with its canceled Constellation program {{in accordance with the}} National Environmental Policy Act in 2011. In contrast, ion engines use harmless noble gases like xenon for propulsion.|$|E

40|$|On {{occasion}} of the project YOGAM (year of gas phase and aerosol measurements), the spatial and temporal variation of selected aerosol and gas phase parameters was assessed for the Zürich (Switzerland) area with a new mobile pollutant measurement laboratory. This assessment based on on-road measurements along a specified route on selected days during different seasons in 2001 / 2002, covering urban, suburban and rural regions. Special focus {{was put on the}} investigation and characterization of particles in the fine (&lt; 2. 5 mm) and ultrafine (&lt; 100 nm) size ranges. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) showed that the variance of all considered fine and ultrafine aerosol parameters (i. e. particle background and total number concentration for particles larger than 3 nm, number concentrations in the size ranges 7 &ndash; 30 nm and 80 &ndash; 140 nm, as well as the active surface area concentration) was considerably larger for day-to-day than for spatial variation. However, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) found a similar regional pollution pattern within <b>every</b> <b>single</b> measuring <b>day.</b> Lowest particle background levels were found in rural areas at higher elevation 15 000 cm&minus; 3 ), while corresponding mean background values for urban and freeway-influenced areas were typically 35 000 cm&minus; 3 and &gt; 80 000 cm&minus; 3 , respectively. Meteorology, i. e. prevailing weather conditions not only governed the day-to-day concentration variations in the selected area, but also influenced the formation of both primary (directly traffic-related) and secondary (biogenic or indirectly traffic-related) ultrafine particles. Overall, low temperatures regularly enhanced primary ultrafine particle formation in urban areas. There was however indication for relatively low number concentrations of secondary ultrafine particles during only a few warm and sunny spring days. Mobile measurements as described in this study {{have been shown to be}} suitable for long-term pollutant assessments, to obtain good information on spatial variability and reasonable information on the temporal variability. For aspects concerning spatial resolution, an experimental design using a mobile measurement may even be more appropriate than a network of stationary measuring sites...|$|R

During each turn (which is a <b>single</b> <b>day,</b> or half-day at weekends) the player chooses {{from a range of}} solo and social activities, and responds to phone calls from his friends regarding social invitations.
