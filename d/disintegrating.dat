5|$|While the Ottomans thus {{temporarily}} therefore {{gained the}} Christian {{regions of the}} <b>disintegrating</b> Safavids, Yesai was blamed for this failure {{by some of the}} leaders of the Armenian army as they were forced to fend for themselves against the Turkish invasions.|$|E
5|$|Amylostereum is {{the single}} genus in the fungal family Amylostereaceae. The genus {{currently}} comprises four saprotrophic and parasitic species, which live off living or dead wood. The Amylostereaceae cause white rot in the wood by <b>disintegrating</b> the tissue component lignin. They produce crust-like, partially wavy fruit bodies {{on the surface of}} infested trees, which are similar to those produced by Stereum species.|$|E
5|$|Baculoviruses are {{specific}} to individual insect host species and {{have been shown to}} be useful in biological pest control. For example, the Lymantria dispar multicapsid nuclear polyhedrosis virus has been used to spray large areas of forest in North America where larvae of the gypsy moth are causing serious defoliation. The moth larvae are killed by the virus they have eaten and die, the <b>disintegrating</b> cadavers leaving virus particles on the foliage to infect other larvae.|$|E

5|$|Plutonium–uranium, {{with about}} 15–30mol.% plutonium, {{can be used}} as a nuclear fuel for fast breeder reactors. Its {{pyrophoric}} nature and high susceptibility to corrosion to the point of self-igniting or <b>disintegrating</b> after exposure to air require alloying with other components. Addition of aluminium, carbon or copper does not improve disintegration rates markedly, zirconium and iron alloys have better corrosion resistance but they disintegrate in several months in air as well. Addition of titanium and/or zirconium significantly increases the melting point of the alloy.|$|E
5|$|The XLVI Motorised Corps {{encountered}} little {{resistance from}} the 4th Army, particularly from the 27th Infantry Division Savska and 40th Infantry Division Slavonska, and by the evening of 10 April the whole 4th Army was <b>disintegrating,</b> and all aircraft of the 4th Air Reconnaissance Group had been destroyed.

5|$|The metal-rich {{white dwarf}} WD 1145+017 {{is the first}} white dwarf {{observed}} with a <b>disintegrating</b> minor planet which transits the star. The disintegration of the planetesimal generates a debris cloud which passes {{in front of the}} star every 4.5 hours, causing a 5-minute-long fade in the star's optical brightness. The depth of the transit is highly variable.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{surveys the}} state of {{international}} scholarly debate on inter-firm relations in global manufacturing. It focuses on the evolving strategies of customers and suppliers within the value chains of core manufacturing industries, such as motor vehicles and complex mechanical engineering products. The analysis {{is divided into three}} parts. The first part discusses the historical emergence of clustered, flexible and/or vertically <b>disintegrated</b> production (hereafter: <b>disintegrated</b> production) since the 1980 s. It contrasts <b>disintegrated</b> production with production within hierarchical, vertically integrated Fordist/Chandlerian firms, arguing that the former ha...|$|R
5|$|While {{awaiting}} his execution, Bonnet {{wrote to}} Governor Johnson, begging abjectly for clemency and promising {{to have his}} own arms and legs cut off as assurance {{that he would never}} again commit piracy. Charles Johnson wrote that Bonnet's visibly <b>disintegrating</b> mind moved many Carolinians to pity, particularly the female population, and London papers later reported that the governor delayed his execution seven times. Bonnet was eventually hanged at White Point Garden, in Charles Town, on 10December 1718.|$|E
5|$|With his {{division}} <b>disintegrating</b> and the Germans advancing—German troops captured Kilkis by 23:00 {{and entered}} Thessaloniki at 8:00 in the morning—Maj. Gen. Lioumbas transferred his command post from Kilkis northeast {{to the village}} of Kentriko, where he arrived on 2:00 in the morning, shortly before 192nd Regiment. After contacting his subordinate commanders, and with no contact with TSAM, he ordered the withdrawal of the division southeast along the sole free road towards the villages of Elliniko and Kleisto.|$|E
5|$|AD is also {{considered}} a tauopathy due to abnormal aggregation of the tau protein. Every neuron has a cytoskeleton, an internal support structure partly {{made up of}} structures called microtubules. These microtubules act like tracks, guiding nutrients and molecules {{from the body of}} the cell {{to the ends of the}} axon and back. A protein called tau stabilises the microtubules when phosphorylated, and is therefore called a microtubule-associated protein. In AD, tau undergoes chemical changes, becoming hyperphosphorylated; it then begins to pair with other threads, creating neurofibrillary tangles and <b>disintegrating</b> the neuron's transport system.|$|E

5|$|Although both Susanna and Beale {{think they}} deserve full custody, {{their desire to}} keep Maisie is {{primarily}} to spite each other, and they are quick to pawn her off onto the other parent when looking after her becomes inconvenient. Maisie's time is split between staying with each of her parents, though her primary caregivers become Lincoln and Margo as Susanna leaves on a tour and Beale disappears on business trips. With his relationship with Margo <b>disintegrating,</b> Beale eventually decides {{to move to the}} UK.|$|E
5|$|By early 1945, Germany's {{military}} {{situation was}} on the verge of total collapse. Hitler, presiding over a rapidly <b>disintegrating</b> Third Reich, retreated to his Führerbunker in Berlin on 16 January 1945. To the Nazi leadership, it was clear that the battle for Berlin would be the final battle of the war. Berlin was bombarded by Soviet artillery for the first time on 20 April 1945 (Hitler's birthday). By the evening of 21 April, Red Army tanks reached the outskirts of the city. By 27 April, Berlin was cut off from the rest of Germany.|$|E

5|$|In 1962, the {{military}} {{committee of the}} Syrian Regional Branch of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party spent most of its time plannining to take power through a conventional military coup. The military committee decided it had to capture al-Kiswah and Qatana, two military camps, seize control of the 70th Armoured Brigade at al-Kiswah, the Military Academy {{in the city of}} Homs and the Damascus radio station. While the conspirators of {{the military}} committee were all young, the sitting regime had been slowly <b>disintegrating</b> and the traditional elite had lost effective political power.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, a {{study on}} {{improving}} the Allegheny Mountain Tunnel by either building another tube or by constructing a bypass was carried out. Based on the study, the turnpike commission planned to replace the deteriorating tunnel with a cut through the mountain. The plans were put on hold in 2001 because it would cost $93.7 million. It resurrected the project in 2009. The nearby Mountain Field and Stream Club prefers that the tunnels are improved or a new tube is built rather than building the bypass. These improvements are needed because the Allegheny Mountain Tunnel is narrow and deteriorating, with <b>disintegrating</b> ceiling slabs and outdated lighting and ventilation.|$|E
5|$|Launched in January 2001 after a {{short delay}} due to a problem with Mir, on 27 January Progress M1-5 became the last {{spacecraft}} to dock with the station. It spent two months attached to the Kvant-1 module before deorbiting the station on 23 March 2001. Mir re-entered the atmosphere with Progress M1-5 still docked, <b>disintegrating</b> over the Pacific Ocean, with debris falling into the ocean at around 06:00 GMT. During {{the early stages of}} the unmanned Progress M1-5 mission, a manned Soyuz was placed on standby to launch in order to complete the mission if a problem occurred. The decision to deorbit Mir attracted both praise and criticism for Rosaviakosmos, while several campaigns to save the station were conducted.|$|E

5|$|Much {{floating}} plastic trash {{does not}} biodegrade, instead <b>disintegrating</b> {{over time and}} eventually breaking down to the molecular level. Rigid plastics may float for years. In {{the center of the}} Pacific gyre, there is a permanent floating accumulation of mostly plastic waste and there is a similar garbage patch in the Atlantic. Foraging sea birds such as the albatross and petrel may mistake debris for food and accumulate indigestible plastic in their digestive systems. Turtles and whales have been found with plastic bags and fishing line in their stomachs. Microplastics may sink, threatening filter feeders on the seabed.|$|E
5|$|Another theory {{presented}} by an expert {{shortly after the}} crash theorized that an engine fire {{could have been the}} catalyst of the accident. Under this theory, one of the two engines on the right wing may have caught fire. Shrapnel from the engine may have punctured the fuselage, causing explosive decompression. Alternatively, Julian Frank, who was known to be desperately afraid of flying, may have panicked and hit the window, weakening it such that it subsequently blew out. Under this theory, the pilots and passengers would have been aware of an emergency aboard, which would have allowed them to begin making preparations for an emergency landing. This theory was supported by the wide right turn that the aircraft appeared to make prior to <b>disintegrating</b> and crashing, as well as {{the fact that some of}} the passengers were found wearing life jackets.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Tang {{slipped out of}} the city, however, the entire Nanking Garrison Force was rapidly <b>disintegrating</b> with some units in open flight. Furthermore, contact had already been lost with many units who thus never {{received}} Tang's message and continued to hold their positions as ordered, though even those that did receive it had little luck at slipping through the Japanese lines. China's 66th and 83rd Corps made a bid to evade the Japanese as planned through a gap to the east but immediately ran into their own minefield. After that they were attacked in flight by Japanese units and lost two divisional chiefs of staff in combat. Though the two corps had started the battle at least 11,000 men strong, only 600 of them escaped Nanking. Near dawn on December 13 a portion of China's 74th Corps was also annihilated in a bid to break through Japanese lines along the Yangtze River south of Nanking.|$|E
