50|$|Populous {{honey bee}} colonies are usually reduced to single hive bodies at the {{beginning}} of the honey flow when one or more <b>comb</b> <b>honey</b> supers are added. <b>Comb</b> <b>honey</b> can either be produced in wooden sections, shallow frames, or Ross Rounds.

Young prolific queens help rapid colony population expansion with less likelihood of swarming. Caucasian honey bees are often preferred for their tendency to keep a constricted brood nest and for their production of white wax cappings, making more attractive <b>honey</b> <b>combs.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Before the {{invention}} of the honey extractor almost all honey produced was in the form of <b>comb</b> <b>honey.</b> Today, most honey is produced for extraction but <b>comb</b> <b>honey</b> remains popular among consumers both for eating 'as is' and for combining with extracted honey to make chunk honey. Hobbyists and sideliners can develop their beekeeping skills by producing <b>comb</b> <b>honey,</b> which takes more rigorous attention to beekeeping than the production of extracted honey. Because of the more demanding labor involved, <b>comb</b> <b>honey</b> has greater retail value than extracted honey. ($17/pound compared to $6.50/pound US). [...] <b>Comb</b> <b>honey</b> production is more suitable for areas with an intense prolonged honeyflow from eucalyptus, alfalfa, alsike, and yellow clover. Wooded areas are not as suitable for <b>comb</b> <b>honey</b> production, as bees tend to collect more propolis, making the harvesting of <b>comb</b> <b>honey</b> more difficult. This problem has been largely circumvented with the adoption of specialized frames, such as the Ross Round frame, which prevent accumulation of propolis on saleable units.|$|R

Used extensively in many industries like aerospace, transportation rails, etc. In this study a stainless steel chosen a face sheet and copper is a core material. Honeycombs are most often an array of hollow hexagonal cells with thin vertical walls Copper Honeycomb is low density permeable material with numerous applications. The defining characteristic of these Honeycombs is a very high porosity; typically 75 - 95 % of the volume consists of void spaces. Static three-point bending tests were carried out in order to investigate load and deflection variations. The theoretical load and defections in copper <b>honey</b> <b>comb</b> sandwich panel values is adapted and compared with experimental and simulation results. Metallic Honeycombs have found a wide variety of applications in heat exchangers, energy absorption, flow diffusion and lightweight optics.

To assess the impact of nematodes on brood, we used smaller-size <b>honey</b> <b>combs</b> placed in the second story (super) of a hive and large brood combs placed in the main section of the hive. Our results were inconsistent between these two experimental designs. The smaller <b>honey</b> <b>combs</b> sprayed with Steinernema carpocapsae contained the largest number of uncapped ceils, those sprayed with Heterorhabditis baeteriophora or S. riobravis contained an intermediate number of uncapped cells, and control combs and those sprayed with S. glaseri contained the fewest nmnber of uncapped cells. Large combs sprayed with S. riobravis contained more uncapped ceils than controls or those sprayed with S. carpocapsae, although the differences were not significant. Our results do not support the hypothesis that high-temperature-tolerant species of nematodes are necessarily more infective to honey bees...|$|R
