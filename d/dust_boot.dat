5000|$|Sealed {{ball joints}} {{do not require}} {{lubrication}} as they are [...] "lubed for life". Formerly most ball joints had grease fitting (sometimes called a grease zerk) and were designed for periodic addition of a lubricant, however almost all modern cars use sealed ball joints to minimise maintenance requirements. The lubricant was usually a very high-viscosity lubricant. It is commonly believed that standard ball joints will outlive sealed ones because eventually the seal will break, causing the joint to dry out and rust. [...] Additionally, the act of adding new lubricant pushes out old and dry lubricant, extending {{the life of the}} joint. This was supposed to be done at intervals of 1000 to 2000 miles on many vehicles, which is incompatible with the service interval on modern cars, often 12000 miles or more, and in any case was rarely attended to by owners, resulting in severe wear and possible ball joint failure, which can result in serious accidents. For this reason, almost all ball joints on modern European or Far Eastern cars are the sealed for life type. New technology especially applied to the internal bearing design has allowed ball joints to meet these longer service intervals. The special design's incorporate sintered metal bearings which replace OEM sealed polymer/plastic version and improved <b>dust</b> <b>boot</b> seal's that work much better at retaining the grease.|$|E
40|$|<b>Dust</b> <b>boot</b> is {{the part}} which {{prevents}} entering the foreign bodies (such as water, dust etc.) in to the tie rod ends. <b>Dust</b> <b>boot</b> can lose its elasticity according to working condition. The boot fails and contaminants, resulting in corrosion and wear and causing excessive deflection in the socket assembly, loose steering and alignment to angle changes. Increasing trends in the problems of difficulty in control on the road curve, and skid due to the looseness in the connecting points to the steering system can be seen. In this study physical tests are applied to the <b>dust</b> <b>boot.</b> These are; hardness, tensile strength, elongation at break, recovery, compression set at 70 0 C/ 24 h, density, volume, weight, adhesion resistance, internal diameter,external diameter and outer diameter. In the period of aging tests, following tests are applied; change of hardness, change of tensile strength, volume change, change of weight, change of friction, internal diameter, external diameter and outer diameter at 100 0 C/ 70 h in the lithium grease and circulating air test. Soft PVC and neoprene materials are used in <b>dust</b> <b>boot</b> and it is applied according to the criteria of ASTM and DIN {{in order to preserve}} tie rod ends from outer factors in a long time. Physical properties and aging values are compared...|$|E

40|$|Tie {{rod ends}} {{generally}} deteriorate earlier {{due to the}} lack of <b>dust</b> <b>boot.</b> Polyurethane materials, which show excellent properties as abrasion resistance, flexibility and needle pressure stability, can be used as dust boots in tie rod ends. So in this study flexibility, abrasion resistance and needle pressure stability are investigated by changing the hardness of polyurethane materials. In the experiment materials, named as Elastollan-C 60 A and Elastollan-C 70 A, are used as dust boots. During physical tests to be applied to the <b>dust</b> <b>boot</b> are as followed; hardness, tensile strength, elongation at break, recovery, compression set at 70 0 C/ 24 h, density, volume, weight, adhesive resistance, internal diameter, external diameter and outer diameter. During the aging tests, following steps are applied; change of hardness, change of tensile strength, volume change, change of weight, change of friction, internal diameter, external diameter and outer diameter at 100 0 C/ 70 h in the lithium grease and circulating air test. Finally those polyurethane materials, used as dust boots, are applied according to the criteria of ASTM, and DIN in order to preserve tie rod ends from outer factors for a long time. As a result, physical and aging values of these to polyurethane materials are assessed...|$|E

He was dressed in a particularly gorgeous manner, with plenty of articles of jewellery about him--all about three sizes larger than those which are usually worn by gentlemen--and a rough greatcoat to crown the whole. Into one pocket of this greatcoat, he thrust his left hand the moment he dismounted, while from the other he drew forth, with his right, a very bright and glaring silk handkerchief, with which he whisked a speck or two of <b>dust</b> from his <b>boots,</b> and then, crumpling it in his hand, swaggered up the court.|$|R

40|$|Human {{activity}} {{was found to}} be an effective vector for the dispersal of microalgae to the Ross Sea regions of Antarctica. A total of 50 taxa, mostly typical soil algae, were identified as potential colonizers. Sample material included dust on equipment and boots of expeditioners taken prior to boarding aircraft bound for Antarctica, and soil adherrent to fresh vegetables imported into Scott Base, Ross Island. 10 taxa were from genera unrecorded in the Ross Sea regions. Cylindrospermum (Cyanophyta) and Eustigmatos (Eustigmatophyta) are relatively easily recognised and their spread could be monitored if they became established in Antarctic habitats. However, {{there was no evidence of}} the establishment of any exogenous algae even in highly perturbed habitats close to Scott Base. Airborne dispersal within Antarctica was found to disperse algal propagules in the vicinity of Scott Base, although numbers were very low, being two orders of magnitude lower than those found in New Zealand. The ability of indigenous Antarctic algae and exogenous potential colonizers to survive freeze-thaw cycles, high salinity and desiccation was investigated in laboratory experiments. In general, strains isolated from <b>dust</b> on <b>boots</b> and equipment and from New Zealand air showed high survivability, as did the indigenous Antarctic strains. In contrast, strains isolated from soil on fresh vegetables imported into Antarctica had low survival similar to those isolated from a typical moist New Zealand garden soil.

There was dust, too, on his {{dripping}} face and bare arms, which were scarred here and there. Still, the thin attire lent a certain grace to his wiry figure, and he appeared the personification of strength and activity.

40|$|Coccidiosis in {{chickens}} {{is one of}} {{the major}} problems of poultry industry that is caused by protozoan parasites of genus Eimeria. It is responsible for significant economic losses to the worldwide poultry industry. Eimeria spp. oocysts can be spread to poultry houses by mechanical routes such as <b>boots,</b> <b>dust,</b> cloths, wheels, contaminated equipments and personnel. The objective of present study was to determine which of the above-mentioned parameters is more important. For this purpose a total of 480 samples were collected from litters, workers` hands and <b>boots,</b> wheelbarrows, <b>dust</b> around the houses, feed ingredients and stacked limes situated in front of houses in 5 th week of rearing period. The samples were taken from 60 houses related to 30 broiler farms, which were not vaccinated against Coccidiosis. Based on the presence of Eimeria oocysts, the results indicated that dust around the houses, boots, wheelbarrows, litter, feed ingredients and workers` hands identified to be contaminated with Eimeria oocyts were in 39 (65 %), 31 (51. 7 %), 27 (45 %), 23 (38. 3 %), 10 (17 %) and 5 (8. 3 %) cases respectively.

The scene set the tone for his personality from that point onwards, suggesting that there [...] "may be a screw or two missing from this character's head". He has been described as [...] "powerful" [...] and [...] "manipulative", though he is retiring on occasion when confronted by opposition and even called a coward for delegating his authority. He is also known for his sarcastic tone and one-liners. As Kefka's power grows, his nihilism and madness grow in tandem and as he attains godlike powers he thirsts for the destruction of all life, expresses his loathing of everything in existence by chanting the word [...] "hate" [...] to his enemies. He is also very sadistic, taking amusement at the very idea of people dying and screaming. This is especially evident when he poisons Doma, as well as his admission prior to confronting the Returners for the final time that he enjoys destroying things precisely because precious lives are lost in the process. In his Dissidia appearance, Kefka's insanity is further explored, suggesting that his actions stem from a desire to fill his heart with destruction when love failed to provide his life with meaning. Final Fantasy VI features a song called [...] "Kefka", which exemplifies the [...] "sadistic joy" [...] of the character. His laughter has been called the greatest video game laughter of all time.|$|R
