Hermansson also said that she was shocked at how [...] "Swedish" [...] the whole event was. Journalist Mustafa Can criticised Hermansson's comments {{in an article in the}} Aftonbladet newspaper.|$|E

2500|$|Francis Jeffrey, a Whig {{lawyer and}} editor of the Edinburgh Review, {{originally}} favoured Wordsworth's poetry following the publication of Lyrical Ballads in 1798 but turned against the poet from 1802 onward. In response to Wordsworth's 1807 collection of poetry, Jeffrey contributed an anonymous review to the October 1807 Edinburgh Review that condemned Wordsworth's poetry again. In particular, he declared the ode [...] "beyond all doubt, the most illegible and unintelligible part of the publication. We can pretend to give no analysis or explanation of it;-- our readers must make what they can of the following extracts." [...] After quoting the passage, he argues that he has provided enough information for people to judge if Wordsworth's new school of poetry should be replace the previous system of poetry: [...] "If we were to stop <b>here,</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not think that Mr Wordsworth, or his admirers, would have any reason to complain; for what we have now quoted is undeniably the most peculiar and characteristic part of his publication, and must be defended and applauded if the merit or originality of his system is to be seriously maintained. In putting forth his own opinion, Jeffrey explains, [...] "In our own opinion, however, the demerit of that system cannot be fairly appretiated, until it be shown, that the author of the bad verses which we have already extracted, can write good verses when he pleases". Jeffrey later wrote a semi-positive review of the ode, for the 12 April 1808 Edinburgh Review, that praised Wordsworth when he was least Romantic in his poetry. He believed that Wordsworth's greatest weakness was portraying the low aspects of life in a lofty tone.|$|E

30|$|Under the {{projected}} future climate change, both high productivity and high quality will be needed. In our previous study, we suggested {{the potential for}} improving productivity under E-[CO 2] by showing cultivar differences of 3 % to 36 % in grain yield responses to E-[CO 2] (Hasegawa et al.
