5|$|Once it was {{recognized}} that the symptoms were caused by gas bubbles, and that re-compression could relieve the symptoms, Paul Bert showed in 1878 that <b>decompression</b> <b>sickness</b> is caused by nitrogen bubbles released from tissues and blood during or after decompression, and showed the advantages of breathing oxygen after developing <b>decompression</b> <b>sickness.</b>|$|E
5|$|From 1976, <b>decompression</b> <b>sickness</b> testing {{sensitivity}} was {{improved by}} ultrasonic methods that can detect mobile venous bubbles before symptoms of DCS become apparent.|$|E
5|$|In 1941, {{altitude}} <b>decompression</b> <b>sickness</b> {{was first}} treated with hyperbaric oxygen. and the revised US Navy Decompression Tables {{were published in}} 1956.|$|E
5|$|Paul K Weathersby, Louis D Homer and Edward T Flynn {{introduced}} {{survival analysis}} {{into the study}} of <b>decompression</b> <b>sickness</b> in 1982.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recorded}} experimental work related to decompression {{was conducted by}} Robert Boyle, who subjected experimental animals to reduced ambient pressure by use of a primitive vacuum pump. In the earliest experiments the subjects died from asphyxiation, but in later experiments, signs of what was later to become known as <b>decompression</b> <b>sickness</b> were observed. Later, when technological advances allowed the use of pressurisation of mines and caissons to exclude water ingress, miners were observed to present symptoms of what would become known as caisson disease, the bends, and <b>decompression</b> <b>sickness.</b> Once it was recognized that the symptoms were caused by gas bubbles, and that recompression could relieve the symptoms, further work showed {{that it was possible}} to avoid symptoms by slow decompression, and subsequently various theoretical models have been derived to predict low-risk decompression profiles and treatment of <b>decompression</b> <b>sickness.</b>|$|E
5|$|The ribs {{are bound}} to the spine by {{flexible}} cartilage, which allows the ribcage to collapse rather than snap under high pressure. While sperm whales are well adapted to diving, repeated dives to great depths have long-term effects. Bones show the same pitting that signals <b>decompression</b> <b>sickness</b> in humans. Older skeletons showed the most extensive pitting, whereas calves showed no damage. This damage may indicate that sperm whales are susceptible to <b>decompression</b> <b>sickness,</b> and sudden surfacing could be lethal to them.|$|E
5|$|Therapeutic {{recompression}} is {{a medical}} procedure for treatment of <b>decompression</b> <b>sickness,</b> and is followed by decompression, usually to a relatively conservative schedule.|$|E
5|$|A {{procedure}} {{for dealing with}} omitted decompression stops is described in the US Navy Diving Manual. In principle the procedure allows a diver who is not yet presenting symptoms of <b>decompression</b> <b>sickness,</b> to go back down and complete the omitted decompression, with some extra added {{to deal with the}} bubbles which are assumed to have formed during the period where the decompression ceiling was violated. Divers who become symptomatic before they can be returned to depth are treated for <b>decompression</b> <b>sickness,</b> and do not attempt the omitted decompression procedure as the risk is considered unacceptable under normal operational circumstances.|$|E
5|$|<b>Decompression</b> <b>sickness</b> and {{arterial}} gas embolism in recreational diving {{are associated}} with certain demographic, environmental, and dive style factors. A statistical study published in 2005 tested potential risk factors: age, gender, body mass index, smoking, asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, previous decompression illness, years since certification, dives in the last year, number of diving days, number of dives in a repetitive series, last dive depth, nitrox use, and drysuit use. No significant associations with risk of <b>decompression</b> <b>sickness</b> or arterial gas embolism were found for asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, smoking, or body mass index. Increased depth, previous DCI, larger number of consecutive days diving, and being male were associated with higher risk for <b>decompression</b> <b>sickness</b> and arterial gas embolism. Nitrox and drysuit use, greater frequency of diving in the past year, increasing age, and years since certification were associated with lower risk, possibly as indicators of more extensive training and experience.|$|E
5|$|Further work {{showed that}} it was {{possible}} to avoid symptoms by slow decompression, and subsequently various theoretical models have been derived to predict safe decompression profiles and treatment of <b>decompression</b> <b>sickness.</b>|$|E
5|$|A diver {{missing a}} {{required}} decompression stop {{increases the risk}} of developing <b>decompression</b> <b>sickness.</b> The risk is related to the depth and duration of the missed stops. The usual causes for missing stops are: not having enough breathing gas to complete the stops, or accidentally losing control of buoyancy. An aim of most basic diver training is to prevent these two faults. There are also less predictable causes of missing decompression stops. Diving suit failure in cold water may force the diver to choose between hypothermia and <b>decompression</b> <b>sickness.</b> Diver injury or marine animal attack may also limit the duration of stops the diver is willing to carry out.|$|E
5|$|A diver {{who only}} {{breathes}} gas at atmospheric pressure when free-diving or snorkelling will not usually need to decompress {{but it is}} possible to get <b>decompression</b> <b>sickness,</b> or taravana, from repetitive deep free-diving with short surface intervals.|$|E
5|$|Later, when {{technological}} advances allowed {{the use of}} pressurization of mines and caissons to exclude water ingress, miners were observed to present symptoms of what would become known as caisson disease, compressed air illness, the bends, and <b>decompression</b> <b>sickness.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} conditions are: decompression illness (which covers <b>decompression</b> <b>sickness</b> and arterial gas embolism); nitrogen narcosis; {{high pressure}} nervous syndrome; oxygen toxicity; and pulmonary barotrauma (burst lung). Although {{some of these}} may occur in other settings, they are of particular concern during diving activities.|$|E
5|$|The {{symptoms}} of <b>decompression</b> <b>sickness</b> {{are caused by}} damage from the formation and growth of bubbles of inert gas within the tissues and by blockage of arterial blood supply to tissues by gas bubbles and other emboli consequential to bubble formation and tissue damage.|$|E
5|$|Therapeutic {{decompression}} is {{a procedure}} for treating <b>decompression</b> <b>sickness</b> by recompressing the diver, thus reducing bubble size, {{and allowing the}} gas bubbles to re-dissolve, then decompressing slowly enough to avoid further formation or growth of bubbles, or eliminating the inert gases by breathing oxygen under pressure.|$|E
5|$|A {{decompression}} {{algorithm is}} used to calculate the decompression stops needed for a particular dive profile {{to reduce the risk of}} <b>decompression</b> <b>sickness</b> occurring after surfacing at the end of a dive. The algorithm can be used to generate decompression schedules for a particular dive profile, decompression tables for more general use, or be implemented in dive computer software.|$|E
5|$|A {{decompression}} stop is {{a period}} a diver must spend at a relatively shallow constant depth during ascent after a dive to safely eliminate absorbed inert gases from the body tissues to avoid <b>decompression</b> <b>sickness.</b> The practice of making decompression stops is called staged decompression, as opposed to continuous decompression.|$|E
5|$|Decompression may be {{continuous}} or staged, {{where the}} ascent {{is interrupted by}} stops at regular depth intervals, but the entire ascent {{is part of the}} decompression, and ascent rate can be critical to harmless elimination of inert gas. What is commonly known as no-decompression diving, or more accurately no-stop decompression, relies on limiting ascent rate for avoidance of excessive bubble formation. Staged decompression may include deep stops depending on the theoretical model used for calculating the ascent schedule. Omission of decompression theoretically required for a dive profile exposes the diver to significantly higher risk of symptomatic <b>decompression</b> <b>sickness,</b> and in severe cases, serious injury or death. The risk is related to the severity of exposure and the level of supersaturation of tissues in the diver. Procedures for emergency management of omitted decompression and symptomatic <b>decompression</b> <b>sickness</b> have been published. These procedures are generally effective, but vary in effectiveness from case to case.|$|E
5|$|In-water {{recompression}} (IWR) is {{the emergency}} treatment of <b>decompression</b> <b>sickness</b> (DCS) by sending the diver back underwater {{to allow the}} gas bubbles in the tissues, which are causing the symptoms, to resolve. It is a risky procedure that should only be used {{when it is not}} practicable to travel to the nearest recompression chamber in time to save the victim's life.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recorded}} experimental work related to decompression {{was conducted by}} Robert Boyle, who subjected experimental animals to reduced ambient pressure by use of a primitive vacuum pump. In the earliest experiments the subjects died from asphyxiation, but in later experiments signs of what was later to become known as <b>decompression</b> <b>sickness</b> were observed.|$|E
5|$|The no {{decompression}} limit (NDL) or no stop time, is {{the interval}} that a diver may theoretically spend {{at a given}} depth without having to perform decompression stops. The NDL helps divers plan dives {{so that they can}} stay at a given depth and ascend without stopping while avoiding unacceptable risk of <b>decompression</b> <b>sickness.</b>|$|E
5|$|US Navy {{decompression}} tables {{have gone}} {{through a lot of}} development over the years. They have mostly been based on parallel multi-compartment exponential models. The number of compartments has varied, and the allowable supersaturation in the various compartments during ascent has undergone major development based on experimental work and records of <b>decompression</b> <b>sickness</b> incidents.|$|E
5|$|A {{decompression}} {{schedule is}} a specified ascent rate and series of increasingly shallower decompression stops—often for {{increasing amounts of}} time—that a diver performs to outgas inert gases from their body during ascent to the surface {{to reduce the risk}} of <b>decompression</b> <b>sickness.</b> In a decompression dive, the decompression phase may make up a large part of the time spent underwater (in many cases it is longer than the actual time spent at depth).|$|E
5|$|A {{study by}} Divers Alert Network in 2004 {{suggests}} that {{addition of a}} deep (c. 15m) {{as well as a}} shallow (c. 6m) safety stop to a theoretically no-stop ascent will significantly reduce decompression stress indicated by precordial doppler detected bubble (PDDB) levels. The authors associate this with gas exchange in fast tissues such as the spinal cord and consider that an additional deep safety stop may reduce the risk of spinal cord <b>decompression</b> <b>sickness</b> in recreational diving.|$|E
5|$|Decompression {{obligation}} {{for a given}} dive profile must {{be calculated}} and monitored {{to ensure that the}} risk of <b>decompression</b> <b>sickness</b> is controlled. Some equipment is specifically for these functions, both during planning before the dive and during the dive. Other equipment is used to mark the underwater position of the diver, as a position reference in low visibility or currents, or to assist the diver's ascent and control the depth.|$|E
5|$|Historically, in-water {{recompression}} was {{the usual}} method of treating <b>decompression</b> <b>sickness</b> in remote areas. Procedures were often informal and based on operator experience, and used air as the breathing gas as it {{was all that was}} available. The divers generally used standard diving gear, which was relatively safe for this procedure, as the diver was at low risk of drowning if he lost consciousness.|$|E
5|$|If the {{dissolved}} {{inert gases}} {{come out of}} solution within the tissues {{of the body and}} form bubbles, they may cause the condition known as <b>decompression</b> <b>sickness,</b> or DCS, also known as divers' disease, the bends or caisson disease. However, not all bubbles result in symptoms, and doppler bubble detection shows that venous bubbles are present in a significant number of asymptomatic divers after relatively mild hyperbaric exposures.|$|E
5|$|The {{intended}} dive {{profile is}} {{useful as a}} planning tool {{as an indication of}} the risks of <b>decompression</b> <b>sickness</b> and oxygen toxicity for the exposure, and also for estimating the volume of open-circuit breathing gas needed for a planned dive, as these depend in part upon the depth and duration of the dive. A dive profile diagram is conventionally drawn with elapsed time running from left to right and depth increasing down the page.|$|E
5|$|The main {{inert gas}} in air is {{nitrogen}}, but nitrogen {{is not the}} only gas that can cause DCS. Breathing gas mixtures such as trimix and heliox include helium, which can also cause <b>decompression</b> <b>sickness.</b> Helium both enters and leaves the body faster than nitrogen, so different decompression schedules are required, but, since helium does not cause narcosis, it is preferred over nitrogen in gas mixtures for deep diving.|$|E
5|$|To a {{large extent}} {{commercial}} offshore diving uses heliox tables {{that have been developed}} by the major commercial diving enterprises such as Comex, Oceaneering International (OI) Alpha tables, American Oilfield Diving (AOD) Company gas tables, though modifications of the US Navy Partial pressure tables are also used. In 2006 the unmodified US Navy tables (Revision 5) were considered to result in an unacceptably high rate of <b>decompression</b> <b>sickness</b> for commercial applications.|$|E
5|$|<b>Decompression</b> <b>sickness</b> (DCS; {{also known}} as divers' disease, the bends or caisson disease) {{describes}} a condition arising from dissolved gases coming out of solution into bubbles inside the body on depressurisation. DCS most commonly refers to problems arising from underwater diving decompression (i.e., during ascent), but may be experienced in other depressurisation events such as emerging from a caisson, flying in an unpressurised aircraft at altitude, and extravehicular activity from spacecraft. DCS and arterial gas embolism are collectively referred to as decompression illness.|$|E
5|$|In ambient {{pressure}} diving, the diver is directly {{exposed to the}} pressure of the surrounding water. The {{ambient pressure}} diver may dive on breath-hold, or use breathing apparatus for scuba diving or surface-supplied diving, and the saturation diving technique reduces the risk of <b>decompression</b> <b>sickness</b> (DCS) after long-duration deep dives. Atmospheric diving suits (ADS) may be used to isolate the diver from high ambient pressure. Crewed submersibles can extend depth range, and remotely controlled or robotic machines can reduce risk to humans.|$|E
5|$|Repetitive diving {{occurs when}} two dives are {{separated}} by a short surface interval, during which the diver has not completely outgassed from the first dive. The gas loading from the first dive must then {{be taken into account}} when determining no stop times and decompression requirements for the second dive. Multiple decompressions per day over multiple days can increase the risk of <b>decompression</b> <b>sickness</b> because of the buildup of asymptomatic bubbles, which reduce the rate of off-gassing and are not accounted for in most decompression algorithms.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} and geologists employ strong sonar and produce an increases in {{noise in the}} oceans. Marine mammals that make use of biosonar for orientation and communication are not only hindered by the extra noise, but may race to the surface in panic. This {{may lead to a}} bubbling out of blood gases, and the animal then dies because the blood vessels become blocked, so-called <b>decompression</b> <b>sickness.</b> This effect, of course, only occurs in porpoises that dive to great depths, such as Dall's porpoise.|$|E
