5|$|Although Robert {{condemned}} Gilbert Porrée {{in conjunction}} with Peter Lombard, he {{did not agree with}} Lombard's Christology, or views on the nature of Jesus Christ. Likewise, although he disagreed with some of Abelard's teachings, he defended Abelard against charges of heresy. Robert did, however, agree with some of Abelard's teachings and methods. The introduction to the Sententiae proclaims Robert's desire to <b>harmonise</b> the writings of two unnamed scholars, who have been identified by modern writers as Hugh of St Victor and Abelard.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, he was {{commissioned}} {{to design the}} Catholic-based Nanzan University in Nagoya. It {{was one of the}} largest projects that he would undertake. The campus was orientated on a north–south axis across rolling hills and the eight buildings were arranged to suit the typography and <b>harmonise</b> with the landscape. In-situ concrete is used throughout the scheme and each building has its own concrete form, some with pilotis, others with shells.|$|E
5|$|Monotype {{licensed}} {{and released}} the font Centaur {{around the same}} time as Bembo. It was drawn by the American book designer Bruce Rogers. Its roman is based on a slightly earlier period of Italian renaissance printing than Bembo, the work of Nicolas Jenson in Venice around 1470 (the so-called Venetian style). Like Bembo, its italic (by Frederic Warde) comes from the 1520s, being again loosely {{based on the work of}} Arrighi from around 1520. Compared to Bembo it is somewhat lighter in structure, something particularly true in its digital facsimile. Penguin often used it for headings and titles of 'classic' editions, particularly its capitals and italic; its lower-case does not so effectively <b>harmonise</b> with Bembo due to the different letter shapes such as the tilted 'e'.|$|E

5|$|The modern Regent Street is {{the result}} of this redevelopment. No {{original}} structures survive except south of Oxford Circus for some Nash-designed sewers. The current design {{is an example of the}} Beaux Arts approach to urban design: an assembly of separate buildings on a grand scale, designed to <b>harmonise</b> and produce an impressive overall effect. Strict rules governed the reconstruction. Each block had to be designed with a continuous unifying street façade and finished in Portland stone. The first redevelopment was Regent House, just south of Oxford Circus. The stylistic tone for the rebuilding was set by Sir Reginald Blomfield's Quadrant.|$|E
5|$|Echmarcach {{may well}} have {{controlled}} Mann throughout his second reign in Dublin. Silver hoards uncovered on Mann, dated by their coins to the years 1030s1050s, {{may well be the}} by-product of the intense conflict over control of the island. There is evidence indicating that, {{at some point in the}} early eleventh centuryperhaps in the 1020s1030sa mint may have developed and functioned on Mann. Coins that appear to have been minted on the island roughly coincide with Echmarcach's rule. These coins are very similar to those produced in Dublin, and may be evidence that Echmarcach attempted to <b>harmonise</b> the coinage utilised within his realm. The production of coins on Mann appears to be evidence of a sophisticated economy in the Isles. In fact, the wealth and sophistication of commerce in Echmarcach's realm could in part explain why the constant struggle for control of Dublin and the Isles was so bitter, and could account for Þórfinnr's apparent presence in the region.|$|E
5|$|The Breves causae and Argumenta {{belong to}} a pre-Vulgate {{tradition}} of manuscripts. The Breves causae are summaries of the Old Latin translations of the Gospels and are divided into numbered chapters. These chapter numbers, like the numbers for the canon tables, are not used on the text pages of the Gospels. It is unlikely that these numbers would have been used, even if the manuscript had been completed, because the chapter numbers corresponded to old Latin translations {{and would have been}} difficult to <b>harmonise</b> with the Vulgate text. The Argumenta are collections of legends about the Evangelists. The Breves causae and Argumenta are arranged in a strange order: first come the Breves causae and Argumenta for Matthew, followed by the Breves and Argumenta for Mark, then, quite oddly, come the Argumenta of both Luke and John, followed by their Breves causae. This anomalous order mirrors that found in the Book of Durrow, although in the latter instance, the misplaced sections appear {{at the very end of}} the manuscript rather than as part of a continuous preliminary. In other insular manuscripts, such as the Lindisfarne Gospels, the Book of Armagh, and the Echternach Gospels, each Gospel is treated as a separate work and has its preliminaries immediately preceding it. The slavish repetition in Kells of the order of the Breves causae and Argumenta found in Durrow led scholar T. K. Abbott to the conclusion that the scribe of Kells had either the Book of Durrow or a common model in hand.|$|E
40|$|Regulation 1272 / 2008 {{includes}} {{provisions for}} {{two types of}} classification: <b>harmonised</b> classification and self-classification. The <b>harmonised</b> classification of substances is decided at Community level {{and a list of}} <b>harmonised</b> classifications is included in the Annex VI of the classification, labelling and packaging Regulation (CLP). If a chemical substance is not included in the <b>harmonised</b> classification list it must be self-classified, based on available information, according to the requirements of Annex I of the CLP Regulation. CLP appoints that the <b>harmonised</b> classification will be performed for carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction substances (CMR substances) and for respiratory sensitisers category 1 and for other hazard classes on a case-by-case basis. The first step of classification is the gathering of available and relevant information. This paper presents the procedure for gathering information and to obtain data.

25|$|In {{order to}} protect the {{population}} living around base stations and users of mobile handsets, governments and regulatory bodies adopt safety standards, which translate to limits on exposure levels below a certain value. There are many proposed national and international standards, but that of the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) is the most respected one, and has been adopted so far by more than 80 countries. For radio stations, ICNIRP proposes two safety levels: one for occupational exposure, another one for the general population. Currently there are efforts underway to <b>harmonise</b> the different standards in existence.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} many {{attempts}} to <b>harmonise</b> the data, but verses 1-2 of Daniel {{appear to have a}} primarily theological significance: Daniel is taken into exile {{in the first year of}} Nebuchadnezzar and remains in the service of the Babylonian court until the first year of Cyrus, the Persian king who conquered Babylon in October 539 BCE; Daniel's exile therefore lasted 67 years from 606 BCE to 539 BCE, when he and all the Jews were released from their Babylonian captivity). But this was not the end of their tribulations, for Chapter 7, the first of Daniel's visions, is set in the third year of Cyrus, making 70 years after his exile. Daniel 1 thus sets the scene for the apocalyptic 70-year timetable of Daniel.|$|E
