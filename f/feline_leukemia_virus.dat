Diversity of enFeLVs was limited for the sand cat and jungle cat suggesting that proliferation of enFeLVs occurred within these species after they diverged. Relationships among enFeLVs were congruent with host species relationships except for the jungle cat, which carried only enFeLVs from a lineage that recently invaded the germline (enFeLV-AGTT).

40|$|AbstractThe U 3 {{region of}} the LTR of oncogenic Moloney murine <b>leukemia</b> <b>virus</b> (Mo-MuLV) and <b>feline</b> <b>leukemia</b> <b>viruses</b> (FeLV) have been {{previously}} reported to activate expression of specific cellular genes in trans, such as MHC class I, collagenase IV, and MCP- 1, in an integration-independent manner. It {{has been suggested that}} transactivation of these specific cellular genes by <b>leukemia</b> <b>virus</b> U 3 -LTR may contribute to the multistage process of leukemogenesis. The U 3 -LTR region, necessary for gene transactivational activity, also contains multiple transcription factor-binding sites that are essential for normal virus replication. To dissect the promoter activity and the gene transactivational activity of the U 3 -LTR, we conducted mutational analysis of the U 3 -LTR region of FeLV-A molecular clone 61 E. We identified minimal nucleotide substitution mutants on the U 3 LTR that did not disturb transcription factor-binding sites but abrogated its ability to transactivate the collagenase gene promoter. To determine if these mutations actually have altered any uncharacterized important transcription factor-binding site, we introduced these U 3 -LTR mutations into the full-length infectious molecular clone 61 E. We demonstrate that the mutant virus was replication competent but could not transactivate cellular gene expression. These results thus suggest that the gene transactivational activity is a distinct property of the LTR and possibly not related to its promoter activity. The cellular gene transactivational activity-deficient mutant FeLV generated in this study may also serve as a valuable reagent for testing the biological significance of LTR-mediated cellular gene activation in the tumorigenesis caused by <b>leukemia</b> <b>viruses...</b>|$|R

40|$|The number, {{chromosomal}} distribution, and insertional polymorphisms of endogenous <b>feline</b> <b>leukemia</b> <b>viruses</b> (enFeLVs) {{were determined}} in four domestic cats (Burmese, Egyptian Mau, Persian, and nonbreed) using fluorescent {{in situ hybridization}} and radiation hybrid mapping. Twenty-nine distinct enFeLV loci were detected across 12 of the 18 autosomes. Each cat carried enFeLV at only 9 to 16 of the loci, and many loci were heterozygous for presence of the provirus. Thus, an average of 19 autosomal copies of enFeLV were present per cat diploid genome. Only five of the autosomal enFeLV sites were present in all four cats, and at only one autosomal locus, B 4 q 15, was enFeLV present in both homologues of all four cats. A single enFeLV occurred in the X chromosome of the Burmese cat, while three to five enFeLV proviruses occurred in each Y chromosome. The X chromosome and nine autosomal enFeLV loci were telomeric, suggesting that ectopic recombination between nonhomologous subtelomeres may contribute to enFeLV distribution. Since endogenous FeLVs may affect the infectiousness or pathogenicity of exogenous FeLVs, genomic variation in enFeLVs represents a candidate for genetic influences on FeLV leukemogenesis in cats...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe long {{terminal}} repeat (LTR) {{region of}} <b>leukemia</b> <b>viruses</b> plays {{a critical role in}} tissue tropism and pathogenic potential of the viruses. We have previously reported that U 3 -LTR from Moloney murine and <b>feline</b> <b>leukemia</b> <b>viruses</b> (Mo-MuLV and FeLV) upregulates specific cellular genes in trans in an integration-independent way. The U 3 -LTR region necessary for this action does not encode a protein but instead makes a specific RNA transcript. Because several cellular genes transactivated by the U 3 -LTR can also be activated by NFκB, and because the antiapoptotic and growth promoting activities of NFκB have been implicated in leukemogenesis, we investigated whether FeLV U 3 -LTR can activate NFκB signaling. Here, we demonstrate that FeLV U 3 -LTR indeed upregulates the NFκB signaling pathway via activation of Ras-Raf-IκB kinase (IKK) and degradation of IκB. LTR-mediated transcriptional activation of genes did not require new protein synthesis suggesting an active role of the LTR transcript in the process. Using Toll-like receptor (TLR) deficient HEK 293 cells and PKR−/− mouse embryo fibroblasts, we further demonstrate that although dsRNA-activated protein kinase R (PKR) is not necessary, TLR 3 is required for the activation of NFκB by the LTR. Our study thus demonstrates involvement of a TLR 3 -dependent but PKR-independent dsRNA-mediated signaling pathway for NFκB activation and thus provides a new mechanistic explanation of LTR-mediated cellular gene transactivation...|$|R
40|$|Gammaretrovirus receptors {{have been}} {{suggested}} to contain the necessary determinants to mediate virus binding and entry. Here, we show that murine NIH 3 T 3 and baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells overexpressing receptors for subgroup A, B, and C <b>feline</b> <b>leukemia</b> <b>viruses</b> (FeLVs) are weakly susceptible (101 to 102 CFU/ml) to FeLV pseudotype <b>viruses</b> containing murine <b>leukemia</b> <b>virus</b> (MLV) core (Gag-Pol) proteins, whereas FeLV receptor-expressing murine Mus dunni tail fibroblast (MDTF) cells are highly susceptible (104 to 106 CFU/ml). However, NIH 3 T 3 cells expressing the FeLV subgroup B receptor PiT 1 are highly susceptible to gibbon ape <b>leukemia</b> <b>virus</b> pseudotype virus, which differs from the FeLV pseudotype viruses only in the envelope protein. FeLV resistance is not caused by a defect in envelope binding, low receptor expression levels, or N-linked glycosylation. Resistance is not alleviated by substitution of the MLV core in the FeLV pseudotype virus with FeLV core proteins. Interestingly, FeLV resistance is alleviated by fusion of receptor-expressing NIH 3 T 3 and BHK cells with MDTF or human TE 671 cells, suggesting {{the absence of an}} additional cellular component in NIH 3 T 3 and BHK cells that is required for FeLV infection. The putative FeLV-specific cellular component is not a secreted factor, as MDTF conditioned medium does not alleviate the block to FeLV infection. Together, our findings suggest that FeLV infection requires an additional envelope-dependent cellular component that is absent in NIH 3 T 3 and BHK cells but that is present in MDTF and TE 671 cells...|$|R

Both viruses contain RNA genomes partially homologous to those of endogenous mouse and rat type C viruses and the Kirsten sarcoma virus. In addition, the RNA of PP- 1 R contains a portion of the nucleic acid sequences found in a type C virus isolated from the baboon species P. papio. We propose that both new isolates are genetic recombinants formed between endogenous primate type C viral genomes and sequences found in Kirsten sarcoma-transformed mink cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{human genome}} {{displays}} a rich fossil record of past gamma-retrovirus infections, yet no current epidemic is evident, despite environmental exposure to viruses that infect human cells in vitro. <b>Feline</b> <b>leukemia</b> <b>viruses</b> (FeLVs) rank high on this list, but domestic or workplace exposure {{has not been}} associated with detectable serological responses. Non-specific inactivation of gamma-retroviruses by serum factors appears insufficient to explain these observations. To investigate further we explored the susceptibility of primary and established human cell lines to FeLV-B, the most likely zoonotic variant. Fully permissive infection was common in cancer-derived cell lines, but was also a feature of non-transformed keratinocytes and lung fibroblasts. Cells of haematopoietic origin were less generally permissive and formed discrete groups {{on the basis of}} high or low intracellular protein expression and virion release. Potent repression was observed in primary human blood mononuclear cells and a subset of leukemia cell lines. However, the early steps of reverse transcription and integration appear to be unimpaired in non-permissive cells. FeLV-B was subject to G->A hypermutation with a predominant APOBEC 3 G signature in partially permissive cells but was not mutated in permissive cells or in non-permissive cells that block secondary viral spread. Distinct cellular barriers that protect primary human blood cells are likely to be important in protection against zoonotic infection with FeLV...|$|R
40|$|Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) {{cells are}} {{resistant}} to infections by gibbon ape <b>leukemia</b> <b>virus</b> (GALV) and amphotropic murine <b>leukemia</b> <b>virus</b> (A-MLV) unless they are pretreated with tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation. These viruses use the related sodium-phosphate symporters Pit 1 and Pit 2, respectively, as receptors in nonhamster cells, and evidence {{has suggested that the}} corresponding transporters of CHO cells may be masked by tunicamycin-sensitive secreted inhibitors. Although the E 36 line of Chinese hamster cells was reported to secrete the putative Pit 2 inhibitor and {{to be sensitive to the}} inhibitory CHO factors, E 36 cells are highly susceptible to both GALV and A-MLV in the absence of tunicamycin. Moreover, expression of E 36 Pit 2 in CHO cells conferred tunicamycin-independent susceptibilities to both viruses. Based on the latter results, it was suggested that E 36 Pit 2 must functionally differ from the endogenous Pit 2 of CHO cells. To test these ideas, we analyzed the receptor properties of CHO Pit 1 and Pit 2 in CHO cells. Surprisingly, and counterintuitively, transfection of a CHO Pit 2 expression vector into CHO cells conferred strong susceptibility to both GALV and A-MLV, and similar overexpression of CHO Pit 1 conferred susceptibility to GALV. Thus, CHO Pit 2 is a promiscuous functional receptor for both viruses, and CHO Pit 1 is a functional receptor for GALV. Similarly, we found that the natural resistance of Mus dunni tail fibroblasts to subgroup C <b>feline</b> <b>leukemia</b> <b>viruses</b> (FeLV-C) was eliminated simply by overexpression of the endogenous FeLV-C receptor homologue. These results demonstrate a novel and simple method to unmask latent retroviral receptor activities that occur in some cells. Specifically, resistances to retroviruses that are caused by subthreshold levels of receptor expression or by stoichiometrically limited masking or interference mechanisms can be efficiently overcome simply by overexpressing the endogenous receptors in the same cells...|$|R

The role of glyco-Gag in MuLV replication has been unclear, since gPr 80 gag -negative Moloney MuLV (M-MuLV) mutants are replication competent in vitro and pathogenic in vivo. However, reversion to the wild type is frequently observed in vivo. In these experiments, in vivo inoculation of a gPr 80 gag mutant, Ab-X-M-MuLV, showed substantially lower (2 log) initial infectivity in newborn NIH Swiss mice than that of wild-type virus, and revertants to the wild type could be detected by PCR cloning and DNA sequencing as early as 15 days postinfection. Atomic force microscopy of Ab-X-M-MuLV-infected producer cells or of the PA 317 amphotropic MuLV-based vector packaging line (also gPr 80 gag negative) revealed the presence of tube-like viral structures on the cell surface. In contrast, wild-type virus-infected cells showed the typical spherical, 145 -nm particles observed previously. Expression of gPr 80 gag in PA 317 cells converted the tube-like structures to typical spherical particles. PA 317 cells expressing gPr 80 gag produced 5 - to 10 -fold more infectious vector or viral particles as well. Metabolic labeling studies indicated that this reflected enhanced virus particle release rather than increased viral protein synthesis. These results indicate that gPr 80 gag is important for M-MuLV replication in vivo and in vitro and that the protein may be involved in a late step in viral budding or release.

40|$|The {{retroviral}} vector {{systems that are}} in common use for gene therapy are designed to infect cells expressing either of two widely expressed phosphate transporter proteins, Pit 1 or Pit 2. Subgroup B <b>feline</b> <b>leukemia</b> <b>viruses</b> (FeLV-Bs) use the gibbon ape <b>leukemia</b> <b>virus</b> receptor, Pit 1, as a receptor for entry. Our previous studies showed that some chimeric envelope proteins encoding portions of FeLV-B could also enter cells by using a related receptor protein, Pit 2, which serves as the amphotropic murine <b>leukemia</b> <b>virus</b> receptor (S. Boomer, M. Eiden, C. C. Burns, and J. Overbaugh, J. Virol. 71 : 8116 – 8123, 1997). Here we show that an arginine at position 73 within variable region A (VRA) of the FeLV-B envelope surface unit (SU) is necessary for viral entry into cells via the human Pit 2 receptor. However, C-terminal SU sequences have a dominant effect in determining human Pit 2 entry, even though {{this portion of the}} protein is outside known receptor binding domains. This suggests that a combination of specific VRA sequences and C-terminal sequences may influence interactions between FeLV-B SU and the human Pit 2 receptor. Binding studies suggest that the C-terminal sequences may affect a postbinding step in viral entry via the Pit 2 receptor, although in all cases, binding of FeLV-B SU to human Pit 2 was weak. In contrast, neither the arginine 73 nor specific C-terminal sequences are required for efficient binding or infection with Pit 1. Taken together, these data suggest that different residues in SU may interact with these two receptors. The specific FeLV-Bs described here, which can enter cells using either human Pit receptor, may be useful as envelope pseudotypes for viruses used in gene therapy...|$|R

To determine infectivity of rFeLVs, neonatal cats were inoculated with rFeLVs alone or in combination with FeLV-A. The recombinant viruses were able to replicate efficientlyin vivoonly when administered along with FeLV-A. Of six co-infected cats, three developed thymic lymphosarcomas, one severe aplastic anemia, and two cachexia and depression; all were viremic and seroconverted shortly after inoculation. While both virus types were detected in virtually all tissues examined from these tumor-bearing cats, there was a particularly noteworthy sequence reversion in the rFeLVs. It is known that exogenous FeLV isolates carry a conserved neutralizing MGPNL epitope {{in the middle of the}} surface glycoprotein domain of theenvgene. In contrast, the parental recombinant viruses used to inoculate these cats harbored the enFeLV-derived MGPNP sequence at this position. However, allin vivo-propagated recombinants displayed the MGPNL sequence, while theenv-encoded backbone flanking the MGPNL sequence was that of the parental recombinant virus. These results suggest that viruses with the MGPNL epitope have anin vivoproliferative advantage. The data also provide an explanation for the conservation of this epitope in exogenous FeLVs despite the existence of variant forms in enFeLV proviral elements with which they can recombine...|$|R
