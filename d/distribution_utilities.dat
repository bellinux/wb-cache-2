25|$|The {{electricity}} {{industry was}} restructured by the , which unbundled the vertically integrated electricity supply utilities {{in each state}} of India into a transmission utility, {{and a number of}} generating and <b>distribution</b> <b>utilities.</b> Electricity Regulatory Commissions in each state set tariffs for electricity sales. The Act also enables open access on the transmission system, allowing any consumer (with a load of greater than 1 MW) to buy electricity from any generator. Significantly, it also requires each Regulatory Commission to specify the minimum percentage of electricity that each distribution utility must source from renewable energy sources.|$|E

In 2006, there were 6 purely transmission companies {{that participated in}} electricity transmission in Perú: Red de Energía del Perú S.A.

40|$|MIng (Mechanical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 Electrical {{energy has}} become a very {{important}} and integrated part of the current era. Electricity cost saving interventions, such as load shifting, form part of demand side management (DSM) interventions. DSM interventions have been successfully implemented {{in the past to}} ensure reliable supply of electricity during the Eskom peak periods. It has been established {{that there is a need}} to implement an electricity cost saving intervention on a large water <b>distribution</b> <b>utility.</b> This dissertation focuses on the integration of electricity cost saving interventions on a water <b>distribution</b> <b>utility.</b> An investigation methodology, as well as an integration strategy for implementing an electricity cost saving intervention were developed. This study expands on the importance of an integrated approach. It further discusses the shortcomings of the current control philosophies of a large water <b>distribution</b> <b>utility</b> in South Africa. A load shifting project was implemented as an electricity cost saving intervention on a large water <b>distribution</b> <b>utility</b> in South Africa. The proposed integrated strategy was simulated and an optimised approach developed. It was found that the implementation of the strategy was limited due to process constraints and increasing water demand. Utilising the large combined installed capacity of the pumps in the water <b>distribution</b> <b>utility</b> and the storage capacity, the strategy was implemented and cost savings obtained. It was concluded that load shifting was possible on individual pumping stations in the water <b>distribution</b> <b>utility</b> subsystems, and could, therefore, be quantified to an integrated approach.

25|$|In Argentina, retail tariffs for the <b>distribution</b> <b>utilities</b> in the Metropolitan Area of Buenos Aires and La Plata city (i.e. Edenor, Edesur and Edelap) are {{regulated}} by the national regulatory agency (ENRE) while provincial utilities {{are regulated}} by local regulators. While the utilities under ENRE's jurisdiction had not been allowed to raise residential tariffs since they were frozen in 2002 {{as a result of}} the Emergency and Exchange Regime Law, some provincial regulators had recently approved additional charges to residential tariffs. In particular, the Public Service Regulatory Agency in the Province of Córdoba (ERSeP) agreed in February 2008 to a 17.4% additional charge to residential customers. Likewise, Santa Fé approved increases between 10% and 20%; Mendoza between 0 and 5% below 300 kWh and between 10% and 27% above 300 kWh; Jujuy between 22% and 29% and Tucumán between 10% and 24%. Other provinces (i.e. San Juan, Chaco, Formosa, Corrientes, La Pampa, Neuqen, Río Negro and Entre Ríos) are expected to raise tariffs in the near future.|$|E
