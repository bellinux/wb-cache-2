40|$|Idiopathic renal <b>hypouricaemia</b> is an {{inherited}} form of <b>hypouricaemia,</b> associated with abnormal renal handling of uric acid. There is excessive urinary wasting of uric acid resulting in <b>hypouricaemia.</b> Patients may be asymptomatic, but the persistent urinary abnormalities may manifest as renal stone disease, and <b>hypouricaemia</b> may manifest as exercise induced acute kidney injury. Here {{we have identified}} Macedonian and British patients with <b>hypouricaemia,</b> who presented {{with a variety of}} renal symptoms and signs including renal stone disease, hematuria, pyelonephritis and nephrocalcinosis. We have identified heterozygous missense mutations in SLC 22 A 12 encoding the urate transporter protein URAT 1 and correlate these genetic findings with functional characterization. Urate handling was determined using uptake experiments in HEK 293 cells. This data highlights the importance of the URAT 1 renal urate transporter in determining serum urate concentrations and the clinical phenotypes, including nephrolithiasis, that should prompt the clinician to suspect {{an inherited}} form of renal <b>hypouricaemia...</b>|$|E

40|$|Two {{patients}} with acute myeloid leukaemia developed <b>hypouricaemia</b> {{during the period}} of their illness. Renal clearance studies showed that the <b>hypouricaemia</b> was associated with an increased urate clearance, renal aminoaciduria, and an episodic increase in phosphate clearance. These findings together with an inadequate suppression of urinary urate exceretion after the administration of pyrazinamide suggest proximal tubular dysfunction affecting reabsorption {{of a wide variety of}} substances. Ten more {{patients with}} acute leukaemia were studied and the results indicate that this lesion develops in a large proportion of patients with acute myeloid leukaemia...|$|E
40|$|A 64 -year-old female {{was found}} to have <b>hypouricaemia,</b> with serum uric acid ranging from 0. 06 - 0. 12 mmol/l (1. 1 - 2. 0 mg/ 100 ml), {{associated}} with an increased urate clearance of 48. 9 ml/min and hyperparathyroidism. Known causes of increased uric acid clearance were excluded. Pyrazinamide reduced urate clearance dramatically to 2. 1 ml/min, suggesting that the tubular defect was either one of increased secretion or a failure of postsecretory reabsorption. No other tubular abnormality was apparent except diminished urine concentrating ability. <b>Hypouricaemia</b> has not been previously reported in association with hyperparathyroidism and a mechanism relating the two disorders could not be readily postulated. The tubular defect shown in this instance resembled that reported in association with Wilson's disease and Hodgkin's disease.

40|$|The Dalmatian coach hound, when {{compared}} to other dog breeds, exhibits three characteristic abnormalities of uric acid metabolism, namely hyperuricaemia, hyperuricosuria and increased renal uric acid clearance. These properties are associated with hypoallantoinaemia and hypoallantoinuria. A result of these abnormalities is a high incidence of urate urolithiasis in this breed. Other diseases such as recurrent dermatitis, chronic cystitis and deafness are also found in the Dalmatian and whether there is any causal relationship with the uric acid disorder is unknown. In terms of the quantity of uric acid excreted, the Dalmatian dog resembles man more closely than the non-Dalmatian. On the other hand, in its high renal urate clearance, this breed of dogs differs from man, whose renal clearance values are lower and therefore closer to those of the non-Dalmatian. In this respect the Dalmatian resembles man affected with the inborn renal urate transport defect of renal <b>hypouricaemia.</b> The significance of uric acid metabolism in the Dalmatian has attracted many investigators in search of the underlying metabolic defect(s).

40|$|Abstract. Although {{some cases}} of tubular {{dysfunction}} (TD) associated with nephrotic syndrome have been described, the incidence and {{the characteristics of}} this complication remain unknown. We investigated the presence of TD (renal glycosuria, aminoaciduria, meta-bolic acidosis with normal anion gap, <b>hypouricaemia,</b> and throughout hypophosphataemia) in 36 patients with nephrotic syndrome. Ten patients (group 1) showed glycosuria at some time {{during the course of}} their illness, ranging from 2. 5 to 11. 2 g/ 24 h. In addition, seven of them had metabolic acidosis with normal anion gap, five aminoaciduria, and two <b>hypouricaemia.</b> Mem-branous glomerulonephritis was the most frequent aetiology in group 1 patients (7 of 10). Proteinuria and serum creatinine (SCr) were significantly higher in group 1 patients than in the 26 remaining patients without TD (group 2) : 10. 2 ± 3. 7 versus 6. 7 ± 2. 9 g/ 24 h (P< 0. 01) and 3. 2 ± 1. 9 versus 1. 6 ± 0. 9 mg/dl (P< 0. 05) respectively. The appearance of TD coincided with a clear worsening of renal function in most of group 1 patients. In addition, at the end of follow-up, SCr had increased from 3. 2 ± 1. 9 to 5. 6 ± 3. 3 mg/dl (P< 0. 05) in this group. In contrast, SCr did not show significant changes in group 2 (1. 6 ± 0. 9 versus 2. 1 ± 2. 2 mg/dl).

40|$|Familial renal glucosuria (FRG) {{is a rare}} co -dominantly {{inherited}} benign phenotype {{characterized by}} the presence of glucose in the urine. It is caused by mutations in the SLC 5 A 2 gene that encodes SGLT 2, a Na+ -glucose co -transporter. The purpose of our current work was twofold: to characterize the molecular and phenotype findings of an FRG cohort and, in addition, to detail the SGLT 2 expression in the adult human kidney. The phenotype of FRG pedigrees was evaluated using direct sequencing for the identification of sequence variations in the SLC 5 A 2 gene. The expression of SGLT 2 in the adult human kidney was studied by immunofluorescence on kidney biopsy specimens. In the absence of renal biopsies from FRG individuals, and in order to evaluate the potential disruption of SGLT 2 expression in a glucosuric nephropathy, we have selected cases of nucleoside analogues induced proximal tubular toxicity. We identified six novel SLC 5 A 2 mutations in six FRG pedigrees and described the occurrence of hyperuricosuria associated with <b>hypouricaemia</b> in the two probands with the most severe phenotypes. Histopathological studies proved that SGLT 2 is localized to the brush -border of the proximal tubular epithelia cell and that this normal pattern was found to be disrupted in cases of nucleoside analogues induced tubulopathy. We present six novel SLC 5 A 2 mutations, further contributing to the allelic heterogeneity in FRG, and identified hyperuricosuria and <b>hypouricaemia</b> as part of the FRG phenotype. SGLT 2 is localized to the brush -border of the proximal tubule in the adult human normal kidney, and aberrant expression of the co -transporter may underlie the glucosuria seen with the use of nucleoside analogues...|$|E
40|$|During routine {{biochemical}} {{screening of}} over 4, 000 patients {{admitted to the}} Veterans Administration Wadsworth Hospital Center, a small number {{were found to have}} serum urate concentrations below 2 - 2 mg/ 100 ml. Most of these patients had profound illness, including severe hepatic involvement with jaundice. It is known that circulating bilirubin is highly bound to proteins (Odell, 1959). Previous studies if this laboratory have shown that many protein-bound anions may displace protein-bound urate in vitro and may have a uricosuric effect when given to patients with hyperuricaemia or to normal volun-teers (Bluestone, Kippen, and Klinenberg, 1969; Klinenberg, Bluestone, Schlosstein, Waisman, and Whitehouse, 1973). Therefore, a study of urate excretion and plasma binding of urate in transiently jaundiced patients was undertaken to investigate any direct relationship between hyperbilirubinaemia and <b>hypouricaemia.</b> Additional experiments were per-formed with rats that were madejaundiced by ligation of the common bile duct.

40|$|Developmental {{retardation}} was {{a prominent}} clinical feature in six infants from three kindreds deficient in the enzyme purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) and was present before development of T cell immunodeficiency. Guanosine triphosphate (GTP) depletion was noted in the erythrocytes of all surviving homozygotes and was of equivalent magnitude to that found in the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (complete hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) deficiency). The similarity between the neurological complications in both disorders indicates that the two major clinical consequences of complete PNP deficiency have differing aetiologies: neurological effects resulting from deficiency of the PNP enzyme products, which are the substrates for HGPRT, leading to functional deficiency of this enzyme. immunodeficiency caused by accumulation of the PNP enzyme substrates, one of which, deoxyguanosine, is toxic to T cells. These studies show the need to consider PNP deficiency (suggested by the finding of <b>hypouricaemia)</b> in patients with neurological dysfunction, {{as well as in}} T cell immunodeficiency.

40|$|The {{biochemical}} {{features of}} severe hyponatraemia due to thiazide administration in 7 non-oedematous patients {{were compared with}} those in hyponatraemia due to frusemide. <b>Hypouricaemia</b> {{has been shown to}} occur in hyponatraemia due to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone activity and this was measured along with fractional uric acid clearances in all the patients. Five of the patients had been on thiazides (or hydrochlorothiazide with amiloride) for only a few days to a few weeks. Fractional uric acid clearance was elevated and serum uric acid levels were low in five of them and returned to the normal range on restoration of serum sodium to normal. By contrast, the patients on frusemide did not show any abnormality in fractional uric acid clearance at any stage. These results are consistent with excess ADH activity as having caused hyponatraemia induced by thiazides in 5 of the 7 cases, whereas frusemide caused a sodium depletion syndrome. Treatment in the former cases is by water restriction, and in frusemide-induced salt depletion by saline supplementation...|$|E
40|$|Background: Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) {{presents}} a major health problem {{in several states}} in Sudan. VL/HIV co-infection is an emerging health problem which {{has been reported to}} be associated with renal and liver dysfunction. Design: A descriptive study and cross sectional studies also were performed. Setting: The study was conducted at Tabarak-Allah Rural Hospital Gedarif state and Al- Azaza Centre, Sinnar State. Objectives: General objective: To study the prevalence of VL/HIV co-infection in the Sudan Specific objective: To determine the liver and renal profiles in VL, HIV and VL/HIV co-infected patients. Material and methods: A total of 99 VL parasitologicaly confirmed cases in Tabarak-Allah Rural Hospital (Gedarif state, Eastern Sudan) and Al- Azaza Centre (Sinnar State) and. There were 57 (57. 6 %) males and 42 (42. 4 %) females, their ages ranged from 2 - 75 years (mean of ages was 16 years), 30 HIV seropositive individuals from Al Gadarif Teaching Hospital were studied, 23 (76. 7 %) of them were males, and 7 (23. 3 %) were females. Their age ranged between 30 and 54 years (mean of age was 40 years). All serum samples from VL samples were analyzed for renal and liver profiles using chemistry analyzer and were also screened for HIV by third generation ELISA kits. The 30 HIV seropositive samples were analyzed for liver and renal profiles and for CD 4 cell count by flowcytometry. Results: Of the 99 VL confirmed cases jaundice was detected in Nine (9. 1 %), elevated AST activity in 85 (85. 9 %), elevated ALT in 19 (19. 2 %), VII elevated ALP in 55 (556 %), low albumin level in 78 (78. 8 %), hyperprotienamia in 40 (40. 4 %), azotamia in 7 (7. 3 %), hypocalcaemia in 48 (48. 5 %), hyponatraemia in 89 (899 %), hypokalamia in 29 (29. 3 %) and hyperkalaemia in 11 (11. 1 %). Two (2. 4 %) patients had renal failure. Seven (7. 1 %) of the 99 confirmed VL patients were HIV co-infected. One (14. 3 %) of those 7 HIV/ VL co-infected cases had elevated ALT, 7 (100 %) had elevated AST, 6 (85. 7 %) had elevated ALP activity, 2 (28. 6 %) had hyperprotienamia, 5 (71. 4 %) had hypoalbuminaemia, 3 (42. 9 %) had hypocalcaemia, 7 (100 %) had hyponatraemia, 2 (28. 6 %) had hypokalamia and 1 (14. 3 %) had hyperkalaemia. Of the 30 HIV seropositive individuals, 3 (10 %) were jaundiced, 12 (40 %) had elevated ALT, 11 (36. 7 %) had elevated AST, 11 (36. 7 %) had elevated ALP, 6 (20 %) had hyperprotiemaemia, 3 (10 %) had hyperprotienamia, 19 (63. 3 %) had hypoalbuminaemia, 3 (10 %) had Azotamia, 16 (60 %) had hyponatraemia, 2 (6. 7 %) had hyperkalaemia, 10 (33. 3 %) had hypokalamia, 13 (43. 3 %) had hyperuricaemia, 1 (3. 3 %) had <b>hypouricaemia,</b> 16 (53. 3 %) had hypocalcaemia and one (3. 3 %) had renal failure. The comparison of liver profile between confirmed VL and VL/coinfected cases showed significant differences in in ALT, ALP,AST, T. Protien and Albumin Levels (P. Value 0. 05). In the renal profile creatinine and sodium levels, were also significantly different between the two groups (P. Value 0. 05). VIII Conclusion and Recommendation: In view {{of the results of the}} present study it is concluded that VL and VL/HIV co-infection can be associated with impairment in renal and liver functions;. The prevalence of VL /HIV co-infection is increasing in Sudan. Accordingly, it can be recommended that renal and liver profiles should be determined before treatment in all VL cases that show clinical features of renal or liver dysfunction. Urine analysis is recommended to be a routine test in VL as an indicator for any abnormality in renal function. Due to the limited number of VL/HIV coinfected cases in the present study further studies involving larger sample size are required...|$|E
