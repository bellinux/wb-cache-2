5|$|Segundus's article generates {{considerable}} {{interest in}} Mr Norrell, who moves to London to revive practical English magic. He enters society {{with the help}} of two gentlemen about town and meets a Cabinet Minister, Sir Walter Pole. To ingratiate himself, Mr Norrell attempts to recall Sir Walter's fiancée, Emma Wintertowne, from the dead. He summons a fairy—"the gentleman with thistle-down hair"—who strikes a bargain with Mr Norrell to restore Emma: half of her life will be spent with the fairy. After news spreads of Emma's resurrection and <b>happy</b> <b>marriage</b> to Sir Walter, magic becomes seen as respectable; and Mr Norrell uses his magic to aid the government in their ongoing war against Napoleon.|$|E

Baba is diagnosed with terminal cancer but is still capable of granting Amir one last favor: he asks Soraya's father's permission for Amir to marry her. He agrees and the two marry. Shortly thereafter Baba dies. Amir and Soraya settle down in a <b>happy</b> <b>marriage,</b> but to their sorrow they learn that they cannot have children.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{marriage}} in Germany on 29 May 1815, Queen Charlotte refused to receive her new daughter-in-law, nor would the Queen attend the resolemnisation of the Cumberlands' marriage at Kew, which Ernest's four older brothers attended. The Prince of Wales (now Prince Regent) found the Cumberlands' presence in Britain embarrassing, and offered him {{money and the}} Governorship of Hanover if they would leave for the Continent. Ernest refused, and the Cumberlands divided their time between Kew and St. James's Palace {{for the next three}} years. The Queen remained obstinate in her refusal to receive Frederica. Despite these family troubles, the Cumberlands had a <b>happy</b> <b>marriage.</b> The Government of Lord Liverpool asked Parliament to increase the Duke's allowance by £6,000 per year in 1815 (equal to about £ today), so he could meet increased expenses due to his marriage. The Duke's involvement in the Weymouth election became an issue, and the bill failed by one vote. Liverpool tried again in 1817; this time the bill failed by seven votes.|$|E

The search for a suitable wife intensified. On 8 September 1761 in the Chapel Royal, St James's Palace, the King married Princess Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, whom he met on their wedding day. A fortnight later on 22 September both were crowned at Westminster Abbey. George remarkably never took a mistress (in contrast with his grandfather and his sons), and the couple enjoyed a genuinely <b>happy</b> <b>marriage</b> until his mental illness struck. They had 15 children—nine sons and six daughters. In 1762, George purchased Buckingham House (on the site now occupied by Buckingham Palace) for use as a family retreat. His other residences were Kew and Windsor Castle. St James's Palace was retained for official use. He did not travel extensively, and spent his entire life in southern England. In the 1790s, the King and his family took holidays at Weymouth, Dorset, which he thus popularised {{as one of the first}} seaside resorts in England.|$|E

25|$|According to {{the social}} mores {{represented}} in the show, a <b>happy</b> <b>marriage</b> {{is the cornerstone of}} successful middle-class family life, and June and Ward represent the warm, happily married, successful middle class couple.

Singles like prim Aunt Martha and globe-trotting, yarn-spinning Uncle Billy are shown as either out-of-touch and irksome or untrustworthy. The one episode dealing with divorce shows it as having negative effects on children and family life.|$|E
