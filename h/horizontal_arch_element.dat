40|$|The <b>horizontal</b> <b>arching</b> {{mechanism}} transfers <b>horizontal</b> earth pressures {{acting on}} a retaining wall panel to neighbouring elements via soil shear stresses. In this research, the <b>horizontal</b> <b>arching</b> mechanism and lateral deformations of fixed cantilever walls are investigated using centrifuge tests. A 300 mm high, L-shaped model basement comprising separate but contiguous wall panels of different widths and stiffnesses was built to accommodate this purpose. A re-entrant corner was included {{as part of the}} basement geometry, in order that an idealization of the stress distribution at such corners might be made. The model basement retained dry sand poured within an external confining steel tub of 850 mm in diameter. Heavy fluid was contained within to generate stress conditions similar to those found in-situ after casting a wall. The fluid was then drained in-flight to simulate an excavation sequence. A series of six tests were carried out at 45 g where the panel widths and thicknesses around the model basement were varied, so that the effects of panel geometry and stiffness on <b>horizontal</b> <b>arching</b> could be studied. Displacement distributions at the re-entrant corner were investigated with the help of Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), a programme that tracks object movements in patches through a series of still digital images. Photogrammetric calibration was then applied to establish the soil and panel movement vectors in object space. Results indicate that the magnitude of <b>horizontal</b> <b>arching</b> reduces with increasing panel width and stiffness. The equivalent earth pressure coefficient, K, was established through the superimposition of predicted and measured panel displacements and bending moments. Data obtained showed that the earth pressure dropped to below active values, represented by a new coefficient K min, as the wall rotation exceeded 10 - 3 radians.

Our work is centered {{on the study of}} how varia-tions of the geometry might improve structural stability. We define a new measure of structural soundness for masonry buildings as well as cables, and derive its closed-form derivative with respect to the displacement of all the vertices describing the geometry. We start with a gradient descent tool which displaces each vertex along the gradient. We then introduce displacement operators, imposing constraints such as the preservation of orientation or thickness; or setting additional objectives such as volume minimization...|$|R

A limit case is that the ring girder of the curved deck and the funicular arch merge dividing the shell into two parts, so that, if shell thickness tends to zero, no shell connects them. This is the case of curved bridges supported only at mid-span by an inclined arch. The efficiency of different arches is compared. Moreover, the deck can be supported not only at mid-span but also by web members connecting deck girder and inclined arch.

40|$|The {{construction}} of double-curvature arch dams {{is an attractive}} solution from an economic viewpoint due to the reduced volume of concrete necessary for their construction as compared to conventional gravity dams.

In this paper, an innovative software tool to design FEM models of double-curvature arch dams is presented.

In this paper, the construction sequence of a typical diaphragm wall panel in stiff clay is fully simulated using a three-dimensional finite difference program. Computed results are compared with some reported results of centrifuge model tests and relevant case histories. It has been found that the influence zone due to the diaphragm wall panel installation falls within a normal distance of approximately one panel depth, D, from the face of the panel, 1 / 3 D below from the toe and 1 / 3 L from the edge and along the length of the panel (L). Significant horizontal stress reduction behind the center of the panel is attributed to both the downward load transfer and the <b>horizontal</b> <b>arching</b> mechanisms.
