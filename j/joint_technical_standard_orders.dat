50|$|Registration may be {{conditional}} on the vehicle being approved {{for use on}} public highways, {{as in the case}} of the UK and Ontario. Many US states also have requirements for vehicles operating on public highways. Aircraft have more stringent requirements, as they pose a high risk of damage to people and property in event of an accident. In the US, the FAA requires aircraft to have an airworthiness certificate. Because US aircraft must be flown for some time before they are certified, there is a provision for an experimental airworthiness certificate. FAA experimental aircraft are restricted in operation, including no overflights of populated areas, in busy airspace or with unessential passengers. Materials and parts used in FAA certified aircraft must meet the criteria set forth by the <b>technical</b> <b>standard</b> <b>orders.</b>|$|R
50|$|The type {{certificate}} (TC) implies that aircraft manufactured {{according to the}} approved design can be issued an Airworthiness Certificate. Examples of regulatory authorities are the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). To meet those requirements the aircraft and each sub-assembly must also be approved. For example, in the U.S. these sub-assemblies must meet requirements in the applicable <b>Technical</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>Order</b> (TSO). To meet those requirements the design documents are examined for compliance with the applicable Minimum Operating Performance Standards (MOPS) applicable to that sub-assembly. MOPS are published by RTCA, Inc. When aircraft are produced to meet a given TC, each one need not be tested as rigorously but the confidence demonstrated by the TC is conferred, when the aircraft has been assigned an Airworthiness Certificate.|$|R
5000|$|As of 1973, the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) {{standard}} for transponder minimal operational performance, <b>Technical</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>Order</b> (TSO) C74c, contained errors which caused compatibility problems with {{air traffic control}} radar beacon system (ATCRBS) radar and Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) abilities to detect aircraft transponders. First called [...] "The Terra Problem", there have since been individual FAA Airworthiness Directives issued against various transponder manufacturers {{in an attempt to}} repair the operational deficiencies, to enable newer radars and TCAS systems to operate. Unfortunately, the defect is in the TSO, and the individual corrective actions to transponders have led to significant differences in the logical behavior of transponders by make and mark, as proven by an FAA study of in-situ transponders. In 2009, a new version, TSO C74d was defined with tighter technical requirements.|$|R

40|$|Ceramic matrix {{composites}} (CMCs) {{are being}} designed and developed for engine and exhaust components in commercial aviation, because they offer higher temperature capabilities, weight savings, and improved durability compared to metals. The United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issues and enforces regulations and minimum standards covering the safe manufacture, operation, {{and maintenance of}} civil aircraft. As new materials, these ceramic composite components will have to meet the certification regulations of the FAA for “airworthiness”. The FAA certification process is defined in the Federal Aviation Regulations (Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations), FAA policy statements, <b>orders,</b> advisory circulars, <b>technical</b> <b>standard</b> <b>orders,</b> and FAA airworthiness directives. These regulations and documents provide the fundamental requirements and guidelines for design, testing, manufacture, quality assurance, registration, operation, inspection, maintenance, and repair of aircraft systems and parts. For metallic parts in aircraft, the FAA certification and compliance process is well-established for type and airworthiness certification, using ASTM and SAE standards, the MMPDS data handbook, and FAA advisory circulars. In a similar manner for polymer matrix composites (PMC), the PMC industry and the FAA have jointly developed and are refining parallel guidelines for polymer matrix composites (PMCs), using guidance in FAA circulars and the CMH- 17 PMC handbook. These documents discuss design methods and codes, material testing, property data development, life/durability assessment, production processes, QA procedures, inspection methods, operational limits, and repairs for PMCs. For ceramic composites, the FAA and the CMC and aerospace community are working together (primarily through the CMH- 17 CMC handbook) to define and codify key design, production, and regulatory issues {{that have to be}} addressed in the certification of CMC components in civil aircraft...|$|R

30|$|Supply chain {{transactions}} {{have become}} more complex and international than ever, making it increasingly difficult for buyers to observe and ensure quality sellers (Terlaak and King 2006). The International Organization for Standardization’s main objective {{is to provide a}} set of harmonized worldwide <b>technical</b> <b>standards</b> in <b>order</b> to facilitate international exchanges and promote global trade (Clougherty and Grajek 2014). In the early years, international standards like ISO 9000 had proven significant in acting as the determinants of international trade, indeed, more than that of national standards (Clougherty and Grajek 2014; Potoski and Prakash 2009). Specifically, the ISO 9000 Quality Assurance Standards were published by the Technical Committee (TC 176) of the International Organization for Standardization in 1979 to provide universal quality management standards and to rectify information asymmetry issues in international trade. It has been proven that ISO 9000 can act as an effective driver to increase trade (Potoski and Prakash 2009; Terlaak and King 2006). However, in recent years many experts find that the effectiveness of quality management standards are deteriorating due to a process of institutionalization.|$|R

40|$|Standardization is a {{very complex}} process in which many {{different}} factors need to be mediated and harmonized in order to create tools based on the consensus of the parties involved: standards are the result of a negotiation process where different perspectives and approaches compete, in a domain populated by different stakeholders. As such, they may well be qualified as social constructions. However, the widespread technocratic attitude tends to hide their very human nature, overstressing the technical aspects and presenting them as neutral instruments to get to some objectives. Archival standards are based on consensus, but the level and quality of such consensus is rarely investigated: as a matter of fact, the creation of international archival standards has been committed to groups of people representing a well-identifiable geographical and cultural portion of the whole world; nonetheless, they are assumed to serve archival communities all over the world. Moreover, standardization may be seen as a process of codification of professional knowledge – as such, it is a biased and historically determined process. The language, the interpretation of objects and actions, the nature of professional functions, the definitions of terms and concepts: all standards rely on these ever-changing factors. Last but not least, digital memory relies on the use of <b>technical</b> <b>standards</b> in <b>order</b> to be managed, accessed and preserved; therefore, it is fundamental to investigate the nature of <b>technical</b> <b>standards</b> along with their biases, in order to understand how they affect digital memory and its representation, since memory is malleable, continuously reinterpreted and represented {{on the basis of the}} cultural milieu and available tools. We cannot escape unneutrality but we can raise awareness of the discretional factors affecting digital memory if we really want to serve our role of professional mediators between objects and users...|$|R

This paper describes {{the outline of the}} joint study and voluntary action plan enacted by the concerned parties, as well as the prospects for SF 6 gas emission for the future. 1. BACKGROUND OF SF 6 GAS USAGE IN JAPAN In recent years, since there has been a significant increase in electricity demand, substation equipment has had to be more reliable and compact, coping with higher voltage and larger capacity ratings. By applying sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6) gas to substation equipment like circuit breakers and switchgear, downsizing and lower maintenance costs can be achieved to greater degrees than in a conventional air-insulated substation because of the excellent performance of SF 6 gas. Therefore, gas-insulated equipment like gas circuit breakers (GCB), gas-insulated switchgears (GIS) and gas-insulated transformers (GIT) are being widely and commonly used. Particularly in Japan, where land acquisition is extremely difficult, there is a large demand for GIS. On the other hand, because SF 6 gas was identified as a greenhouse gas in recent years, electri...|$|R
