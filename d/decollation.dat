25|$|The {{left wing}} depicts the {{beheading}} of St John the Baptist. His headless body {{lies in the}} left foreground and seems to reach out of the picture, as blood spurts from his severed neck, spraying his hands and the nearby plants. The foreground in the flora are reduced {{to the extent that}} they could not have been painted without a magnifying glass. The executioner stands with his back to the viewer, placing the freshly severed head on Salome's platter. The executioner, Salome, and three gesticulating bystanders form a circle around John's headless and lifeless body. According to Ridderbos, the five figures mirror and create a sense of unity with the five holy figures in the central panel. The scene is set in a courtyard in front of Herod's palace; the banquet that preceded the Baptist's decapitation can be seen in the left-midground of the palace, where minstrels play for Salome's dance. The banquet is well-lit and with good architectural perspective. Albert Michiels described Salome as ravishing but emotionless; she receives the head, with her eyes held aloof. Other versions of St John's beheading (<b>decollation)</b> more typically showed Salome holding an empty plate for the executioner; with an early version typified in a miniature in the Petites Heures of Jean de France, Duc de Berry.|$|E
60|$|But Crowland minster {{had been}} rebuilt in greater glory than ever, by {{the help of}} the Norman gentry round. Abbot Ingulf, finding that St. Guthlac's plain {{inability}} to take care of himself had discredited him much in the fen-men's eyes, fell back, Norman as he was, on the virtues of the holy martyr, St. Waltheof, whose tomb he opened with due reverence, and found the body as whole and uncorrupted as on the day on which it was buried: and the head united to the body, while a fine crimson line around the neck was the only sign remaining of his <b>decollation.</b>|$|E

5000|$|While at Oxford {{he painted}} portraits, and also copied William Dobson's <b>Decollation</b> of St. John, {{altering}} the heads to portraits {{of his own}} friends. As a portrait painter Fuller had some real power, and self-portrait, in the Bodleian Library at Oxford, shows him in a curious head-dress. John Elsum wrote an epigram on it.

50|$|The five Sundays after Easter, Ascension, Pentecost, Trinity Sunday, and Corpus Christi follow, {{as in the}} Roman Rite, but the Triduum Litaniarum (Rogation Days) {{comes on}} the Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday after, instead of before, Ascension Day. The Sundays after Pentecost are {{designated}} as such (e.g. 3rd Sunday after Pentecost) until the <b>Decollation</b> of St. John (29 August). There may {{be as many as}} fifteen of them. Then follow either four or five Sundays called post Decollationem S. Joannis Baptistæ, then three Sundays of October, the third of which is the feast of the Dedication of Milan Cathedral. The rest of the Sundays until Advent are called post Dedicationem.|$|E
50|$|Vicenzo Caccianemici (active 1530) was an Italian {{painter of}} the Renaissance period. He {{was born in}} Bologna, and trained under Parmigianino. Vasari {{mentions}} a picture by this artist in the chapel {{of the family of}} Elefantuzzi in San Petronio at Bologna, representing The <b>Decollation</b> of St. John and another picture of the same subject, differently treated, in the Cappella Macchiavelli in San Stefano. There are a few etchings including Diana returning from the Chase and a Landscape, with a Nymph and Dogs, The Death of Abel, The Adoration of the Shepherds probably after a design by Parmigianino, and finally a St. Jerome in a Grotto.|$|E
5000|$|This {{tide was}} called by the older liturgists [...] "Quinquagesima paschalis" [...] or [...] "Quin. laetitiae". The octave of Easter which closes after Saturday has its own {{peculiar}} Office. Since this octave is part and complement of the Easter Solemnity, Paschal Tide in the liturgical books commences with the First Vespers of Low Sunday and ends before the First Vespers of Trinity Sunday. On Easter Sunday the Armenian Church keeps the Commemoration of All the Faithful Departed and on Saturday of Easter Week the <b>Decollation</b> of St. John. The Orthodox (Greek) Church celebrates on Friday of Easter Week the feast of Our Lady, the Living Fountain (shrine at Constantinople).|$|E

50|$|Other {{works were}} for Cardinal Giovanni Poggi in Bologna, and he carried out {{numerous}} commissions for him. Tibaldi painted frescoes of the Story of Ulysses in the Palazzo Poggi, {{scenes from the}} life of the Baptist in the Poggi chapel, and scenes from the Life of Moses in the Palazzo Sacchetti in Rome. He constructed a chapel for his patron, in the church of S. Giacomo Maggiore, and painted for it a St. John preaching in the Wilderness, and the Division of the Elect from the Damned. The Cardinal Poggi next employed him in the erection of a chapel in the Basilica della Santa Casa, Loreto, where he painted the Nativity, the Presentation in the Temple, the Transfiguration and <b>Decollation</b> of St. John.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to these fasting seasons, Orthodox Christians fast on Wednesdays and Fridays throughout the year (and some Orthodox monasteries also observe Monday as a fast day). Certain fixed days are always fast days, even if they fall on a Saturday or Sunday (in which case the fast is lessened somewhat, but not abrogated altogether); these are: The <b>Decollation</b> of St. John the Baptist, the Exaltation of the Cross and {{the day before the}} Epiphany (January 5). There are several fast-free periods, when it is forbidden to fast, even on Wednesday and Friday. These are: the week following Pascha, the week following Pentecost, the period from the Nativity of Christ until January the 5th and {{the first week of the}} Triodion (the week following the 17th Sunday before Pentecost).|$|E
5000|$|Guerrini was a pupil of Francesco Boccacino. He {{painted a}} <b>Decollation</b> of St John the Baptist for the Oratory of San Girolamo in Cremona. In 1746, he painted a History of a Franciscan Saint for the convent of San Pietro in Cremona. In 1747, he painted five saints for the parish church of Paderno Ponchielli, and a sipario (theater curtain), now lost, for the Teatro Concordia (now Ponchielli). In 1752, he painted La sposa dei cantici and Moses restores {{the waters of}} the Red sea, now in the church of San Leonardo of Casalmaggiore. In 1755-1765, he painted for the church of San Martino del Lago, {{including}} a Glory of St Agatha [...] In the 1780s he painted for the Cavalcabo chapel in Sant'Agostino in Cremona. he also painted for the Palazzo Affaitati in Cremona.|$|E
50|$|In the 17th century great {{quantities}} of cloth were {{sold at the}} Friday market and four fairs were held at the feasts of Saint Michael, Epiphany, Saint Mark, and the <b>Decollation</b> of John the Baptist. The charter of Charles II instituted a Tuesday market, fairs on the Thursday after Whitsunday and at the feast of Saint Swithin. The town continued to prosper in the charge of the abbots, acquiring one of England's first printing presses in 1525. Tavistock remained an important centre of both trade and religion until the Dissolution of the Monasteries—the abbey was demolished in 1539, leaving the ruins still to be seen around {{the centre of the}} town. From this time on, the dominant force in the town became the Russell family, Earls and later Dukes of Bedford, who took over much of the land following the Dissolution.|$|E
50|$|Born in Savona, {{and active}} in Genoa, he {{constructed}} scenography for the theatre, and cabinets with lively caricatures, which he also engraved. He was clever in church paintings, {{as may be}} seen in the church of San Giovanni at Savona, where, besides other subjects of St John the Baptist, there is a much praised <b>Decollation.</b> He painted also in the church of Santa Teresa in Genoa; and was a follower of Benedetto Luti, whose school he had frequented when in Rome. He was also a good fresco-painter; his works are in the choir of the Conventual church in Casale Monferrato, where he added figures to the quadratura of Giuseppe Natali. But subjects of humor were his forte. In these, he had an exhaustless fancy, fertile and ever creative. Nothing can be more amusing than his masks, representing quarrels, dances, and such scenes as form the subjects of comedy. Giovanni's son, Carlo Giuseppe Ratti, was an artist and art biographer.|$|E

5000|$|The manor of Cressing {{was granted}} to the Knights Templar in 1136 by Matilda of Boulogne, [...] the wife of King Stephen close to the main road between London and Colchester, and the road between Witham and Braintree. The Templar estate {{received}} further grants soon after its founding {{in the form of}} the manor and half-hundred of Witham sometime between 1138 and 1148, although the church of Witham, which had previously been {{granted to the}} church of St Martin's Le Grand in London, was not included. The Preceptory of Cressing was therefore one of the very earliest Templar estates in England, and was placed first in a detailed list of Templar holdings in 1185. It was the largest of their estates in Essex. Later, King John confirmed to the Templars at Cressing the land of Berecholt on 14 July 1199, and the land of Newland on 8 June 1214, as well as a market on Thursdays and a three-day-long fair at the feast of the <b>Decollation</b> of St. John the Baptist at the new town of Wulnesforde in the parish of Witham. Later, sometime before his death in 1255, the Templar Peter de Rossa granted over 100 acres of the manor of Rivenhall to Cressing, a parish in which he was parson and lord.|$|E

50|$|Feasts {{are also}} grouped into four classes: First class of Solemnitates Domini and Solemnia; second {{class of the}} same; greater and {{ordinary}} Solemnia; non-Solemnia, divided into privilegiata and simplicia. Solemnia have two vespers, non-Solemnia only one, the first. The privilegiata have certain propria and the simplicia only the communia. The general principle of occurrences is that common to the whole Western Church. If two festivals fall on the same day, the lesser is either transferred, merely commemorated, or omitted. But the Ambrosian Rite differs materially from the Roman in the rank given to Sunday, which is only superseded by a Solemnitas Domini, and not always then, for if the Name of Jesus or the Purification falls on Septuagesima, Sexagesima, or Quinquagesima Sunday, it is transferred, though the distribution and procession of candles takes place on the Sunday on which the Purification actually falls. If a Solemne Sanctorum or a privileged non-Solemne falls on a Sunday, a Solemnitas Domini, the Friday or Saturday of {{the fourth or fifth}} week of Advent, a Feria de Exceptato, within an Octave of a great Feast, a Feria Litaniarum, or a Feria of Lent, the whole office is of the Sunday, Solemnitas Domini, etc., and the Solemne or non-Solemne privilegiatum is transferred, in most cases to the next clear day, {{but in the case of}} Solemnia of the first or second class to the next Feria, quocumque festo etiam solemni impedita. A simple non-Solemne is never transferred, but it is omitted altogether if a Solemne of the first class falls on the same day, and in other cases of occurrences it is commemorated, though of course it supersedes an ordinary Feria. The concurrences of the first Vespers of one feast with the second of another are arranged on much the same principle, the chief peculiarity being that if a Solemne Sanctorum falls on a Monday its first Vespers is kept not on the Sunday, but on the preceding Saturday, except in Advent, when this rule applies only to Solemnia of the first and second class, and other Solemnia are only commemorated at Sunday Vespers. The liturgical colours of the Ambrosian Rite are very similar to those of the Roman, the most important differences being that (except when some greater day occurs) red is used on the Sundays and Feriæ after Pentecost and the <b>Decollation</b> of St. John until the Eve of the Dedication (third Sunday in October), on Corpus Christi and its Octave, and during Holy Week, except on Good Friday, as well as on the days on which it is used in the Roman Rite, and that (with similar exceptions) green is only used from the Octave of the Epiphany to the eve of Septuagesima, from Low Sunday to the Friday before Pentecost, after the Dedication to Advent, and on feasts of abbots.|$|E
