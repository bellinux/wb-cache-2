40|$|In a {{successive}} Cournot oligopoly, we {{show the}} welfare effects of <b>entry</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final goods market with no scale economies but with cost {{difference between the}} firms. If the input market is very concentrated, <b>entry</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final goods market always increases welfare. If the input market is moderately concentrated, <b>entry</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final goods market reduces welfare if the entrant is moderately cost inefficient than the incumbents. If the input market is highly competitive, <b>entry</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final goods market reduces welfare if the entrant is very much cost inefficient than <b>the</b> incumbents. Hence, <b>entry</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final goods market is more desirable under a concentrated input market.
