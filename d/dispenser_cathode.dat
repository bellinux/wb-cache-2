40|$|The {{electron}} gun for the SPEAR 3 injector operates {{with a warm}} thermionic <b>dispenser</b> <b>cathode</b> immersed in a 1. 5 -cell RF structure. At each injection cycle the gun accelerates several thousand electron bunches up to ~ 3 MeV during a 2. 5 us rf pulse.

Although state-of-the-art hollow cathodes have demonstrated up to 30, 352 hours of operation in ground tests with careful handling, future missions are likely to require longer life, more margin and greater resistance to reactive contaminant gases. Three alternate hollow cathode technologies that exploit different emitter materials or geometries to address some of the limitations of state-of-the-art cathodes are being investigated. Performance measurements of impregnated tungsten-iridium <b>dispenser</b> <b>cathodes</b> at discharge currents of 4 to 15 A demonstrated that they have the same operating range and ion production efficiency as conventional tungsten <b>dispenser</b> <b>cathodes.</b> Temperature measurements indicated that tungsten-iridium cathodes also operate at the same emitter temperatures.

Hollow cathodes with lanthanum hexaboride emitters operated over a wide current range, but suffered from lower ion production efficiency at currents below about 12. 4 A because of higher insert heating requirements.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{tungsten}} erosion, transport and redeposition on {{the operation of}} <b>dispenser</b> hollow <b>cathodes</b> was investigated in detailed examinations of the discharge cathode inserts from an 8200 hour and a 30, 352 hour ion engine wear test. Erosion and subsequent re-deposition of tungsten in the electron emission zone at the downstream end of the insert reduces the porosity of the tungsten matrix, preventing the flow of barium from the interior. This inhibits the interfacial reactions of the barium-calcium-aluminate impregnant with the tungsten in the pores. A numerical model of barium transport in the internal xenon discharge plasma shows that the barium required to reduce the work function in the emission zone can be supplied from upstream through the gas phase. Barium that flows out of the pores of the tungsten insert is rapidly ionized in the xenon discharge and pushedback to the emitter surface by the electric field and drag from the xenon ion flow. Thisbarium ion flux is sufficient to maintain a barium surface coverage at the downstream endgreater than 0. 6, even if local barium production at that point is inhibited by tungsten deposits. The model also shows that the neutral barium pressure exceeds the equilibrium vapor pressure of the impregnant decomposition reaction {{over much of the}} insert length,so the reactions are suppressed. Only a small region upstream of the zone blocked by tungsten deposits is active and supplies the required barium. These results indicate that hollowcathode failure models based on barium depletion rates in vacuum <b>dispenser</b> <b>cathodes</b> are very conservative...|$|R

Therefore, the Ba/O ratio is approximately equal to unity during the ion bombardment.
