5|$|Four {{hundred million}} years ago, California lay {{at the bottom of}} a large sea; {{underwater}} volcanoes deposited lava and minerals (including gold) onto the sea floor. By tectonic forces these minerals and rocks came to the surface of the Sierra Nevada, and eroded. Water carried the exposed gold downstream and deposited it <b>in</b> <b>quiet</b> gravel beds along the sides of old rivers and streams. The forty-niners first focused their efforts on these deposits of gold.|$|E
5|$|Fraternisation—peaceful and {{sometimes}} friendly interactions between opposing forces—was a regular feature <b>in</b> <b>quiet</b> front-line {{sectors of the}} Western Front. In some areas, it manifested as a passive inactivity, where both sides would refrain from overtly aggressive or threatening behavior, while in other cases it extended to regular conversation or even visits from one trench to another.|$|E
5|$|Sponges are {{worldwide}} in their distribution, {{living in a}} wide range of ocean habitats, from the polar regions to the tropics. Most live <b>in</b> <b>quiet,</b> clear waters, because sediment stirred up by waves or currents would block their pores, making it difficult for them to feed and breathe. The greatest numbers of sponges are usually found on firm surfaces such as rocks, but some sponges can attach themselves to soft sediment by means of a root-like base.|$|E

5|$|Britain and Australia {{had both}} sent forces to {{participate}} in the Second Boer War of 1899 to 1902, which spurred an increased focus on war memorials. The Boer War had involved 200,000 British volunteers alone, and attracted considerable press coverage. Numerous war memorials were erected on their return, either by local community leaders or by the local Lord Lieutenant, acting on behalf of the county regiments; these were often situated <b>in</b> <b>quiet</b> locations to allow for peaceful reflection by visitors. Australia had honoured its volunteers by placing individual plaques inside buildings, creating outdoor memorial tablets and erecting obelisks in public places. Although the Boer War encouraged a shift away from memorials portraying heroic commanding officers, as had been popular earlier in the 19th century, towards depicting ordinary soldiers, annual ceremonies surrounding the memorials were not common and no official memorial day emerged. Boer War memorials in both countries were widely felt to lack a suitable quality of design and execution, echoing contemporary concerns in the US about the statues erected to commemorate the American Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Cuvier's dwarf caiman is a {{freshwater}} {{species and}} {{is found in}} forested riverine habitats and areas of flooded forest around lakes. It seems to prefer rivers and streams with fast-flowing water, {{but it is also}} found <b>in</b> <b>quiet,</b> nutrient-poor waters in Venezuela and southeastern Brazil. It is able to travel quite large distances overland at night and sub-adult individuals have sometimes been found in isolated, temporary pools. In the northern and southern parts of its range, it is also found in gallery forests in savannah country, but it is absent from such habitats in Los Llanos and the Pantanal. Cuvier's dwarf caiman seems relatively tolerant of cool water compared to other species of alligator. During the day, individuals sometimes lie up in burrows but at other times rest on piles of rocks or sun themselves while lying, facing the sun, in shallow water with their backs exposed.|$|E

25|$|Surface trails on {{sediment}} {{in shallow}} marine environments stand less chance of fossilization {{because they are}} subjected to wave and current action. Conditions <b>in</b> <b>quiet,</b> deep-water environments {{tend to be more}} favorable for preserving fine trace structures.|$|E
25|$|In August 1931, police began {{investigating}} disappearances of Asta Eicher and her children, {{beginning with}} Pierson.

25|$|The D.XII began {{reaching}} the Jagdstaffeln, primarily Bavarian units, in July 1918. Most units operated the D.XII {{in conjunction with}} other fighter types, but units <b>in</b> <b>quieter</b> sectors of the front were completely equipped with the D.XII.|$|R
25|$|Greyhounds live most happily as pets <b>in</b> <b>quiet</b> environments.

25|$|After this campaign, prematurely {{worn out}} by the toils and excesses of his life, and {{tortured}} by gout, Condé returned to Château de Chantilly, where he spent the eleven years that remained to him <b>in</b> <b>quiet</b> retirement. At {{the end of his}} life, Condé specially sought the companionship of Bourdaloue, Pierre Nicole and Bossuet, and devoted himself to religious exercises. He died on 11 November 1686 at the age of sixty-five. Bourdaloue attended him at his death-bed, and Bossuet pronounced his elegy.|$|E
25|$|Many {{hearing aids}} now have both an {{omnidirectional}} and a directional microphone mode. This {{is because the}} wearer may not need or desire the noise-reducing properties of the directional microphone in a given situation. Typically, the omnidirectional microphone mode is used <b>in</b> <b>quiet</b> listening situations (e.g. living room) whereas the directional microphone is used in noisy listening situations (e.g. restaurant). The microphone mode is typically selected manually by the wearer. Some hearing aids automatically switch the microphone mode.|$|E

25|$|Marshall {{loved his}} home, built in 1790, in Richmond, Virginia, and {{spent as much}} time there as {{possible}} <b>in</b> <b>quiet</b> contentment. For approximately three months each year, Marshall lived in Washington during the Court's annual term, boarding with Justice Story during his final years at the Ringgold-Carroll House. Marshall also left Richmond for several weeks each year {{to serve on the}} circuit court in Raleigh, North Carolina. He also maintained the D. S. Tavern property in Albemarle County, Virginia, from 1810–1813.|$|E
25|$|A 2011 AHRQ {{review of}} the {{evidence}} of the effectiveness of CI in people with bilateral hearing loss - the device's primary use - found low to moderate quality data that showed: speech perception in noisy conditions was much better for people who had implants in both ears done at the same time, compared to people who had only one; that no conclusions could be drawn about changes in speech perception <b>in</b> <b>quiet</b> conditions and health-related quality-of-life. There was only one good study comparing implanting implants in both ears at the same time, to implanting them sequentially; this study found that in the sequential approach, the 2nd implantation made no change, or made things worse.|$|E
25|$|As {{with the}} copper–nickel alloys, {{corrosion}} resistance of copper–silicon {{is due to}} protective films that form on the surface {{over a period of}} time. General corrosion rates of 0.025–0.050mm have been observed <b>in</b> <b>quiet</b> waters. This rate decreases towards {{the lower end of the}} range over long-term exposures (e.g., 400–600 days). There is generally no pitting with the silicon-bronzes. Also there is good resistance to erosion corrosion up to moderate flow rates. Because copper–silicon is weldable, rigid pens can be constructed with this material. Also, because welded copper–silicon mesh is lighter than copper-zinc chain link, aquaculture enclosures made with copper–silicon may be lighter in weight and therefore a potentially less expensive alternative.|$|E
60|$|This {{argument}} {{had some}} share <b>in</b> <b>quieting</b> my mother, though her increasing indisposition had a larger one. There was an interval of silence, only broken by Miss Betsey's occasionally ejaculating 'Ha!' {{as she sat}} with her feet upon the fender.|$|R
5000|$|Sediments usually become {{increasingly}} fine with {{distance from the}} coast; sand is limited to shallow, wave-agitated waters, while silt and clays are deposited <b>in</b> <b>quieter,</b> deep water far offshore.

25|$|The PC-24 {{is powered}} by a pair of Williams FJ44-4A {{turbofan}} engines. A unique feature of the FJ44-4A powerplant is the Quiet Power Mode; in addition to providing thrust and main power, standby power is also drawn from the main engines <b>in</b> <b>Quiet</b> Power Mode, in place of a separate auxiliary power unit (APU). An additional 5 per cent is available via an Automatic Thrust Reserve feature. The engines are mounted on the upper portion of the rear fuselage to prevent foreign object damage (FOD) during operations at rough airstrips. Other FOD-reduction measures include the enlarged flaps and chines on the nose wheel of the landing gear. The exhaust ducts of the engines feature an aerodynamic modification, having been shaped so the outflow contributes to the thrust vector during takeoff, reducing the takeoff roll distance.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} Uqair is multi-faceted. The {{irrigation}} channels north of Uqair {{could be the}} abandoned city of Gerrha. And it is alternatively possible the lost city lay beneath the subkha near the ruined Islamic city of Uqair. But Bibby's efforts to dig the channels and beneath the walls of Uqair proved fruitless {{in the search for}} Gerrha. (Looking for Dilmun, Geoffrey Bibby, p. 372). It is the belief of the author of this article that the fort at Uqair is of Islamic origin and constructed by Arabs in defense and in anticipation of foreign attack, that eventually arrived in form of the Portuguese. Despite the lack of conclusively identifying its original builders, Uqair stands <b>in</b> <b>quiet</b> aura as a testimony to a mysterious and diverse cultural landscape that flourished in its proximity.|$|E
25|$|Many {{of these}} African Americans live <b>in</b> <b>quiet,</b> middle class {{suburban}} neighborhoods near the Nassau County border, such as Laurelton and Cambria Heights which have large black populations whose family income {{is higher than}} average. The migration of European Americans from parts of Queens has been long ongoing with departures from Ozone Park, Woodhaven, Bellerose, Floral Park, and Flushing, etc. (most of the outgoing population has been replaced with Asian Americans). Neighborhoods such as Whitestone, College Point, North Flushing, Auburndale, Bayside, Middle Village, Little Neck, and Douglaston {{have not had a}} substantial exodus of white residents, but have seen an increase of Asian population, mostly Chinese and Korean. Queens has experienced a real estate boom making most of its neighborhoods very desirable {{for people who want to}} reside near Manhattan in a less urban setting.|$|E
