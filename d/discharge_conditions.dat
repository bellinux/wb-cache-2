Despite the critical importance of discharge summaries in care transitions and patient safety, no studies have examined how well discharge summaries adhere to Joint Commission standards. Methods: Joint Commission-mandated discharge summary components were specifically defined and abstracted from discharge summaries for all hip fracture, stroke, and cancer patients discharged directly to subacute care facilities from a large Midwestern academic hospital between 2003 and 2005 (N = 599). Results: Preliminary results show that most (88 - 100 percent) discharge summaries included {{five of the six}} Joint Commission components. The remaining component, “patient’s <b>discharge</b> <b>condition,</b> ” was included the least often (79 - 90 percent).

The initial value o B 1 or recharging conditions was 16. 8 sec/ft^ 2, increasing to a maximum of 18. 3 sec/ft^ 2 after 90 minutes of recharge. After 90 minutes 13 began to decrease, reaching a value of 16. 4 sec/ft^ 2 after 200 minutes of recharge. The decline in the rate of growth of B during pumping and the decrease in the value of B during recharge probably reflected a decrease in the convergence and the divergence losses, respectively, as the cone of influence and the groundwater mound increased to a size such that the aquifer began to act more homogeneously. The well loss coefficient, C, had an average value of 6. 9 for <b>discharging</b> <b>conditions.</b> The initial value of C during recharge was 1. 4 which increased to a value of 4. 8 after 200 minutes. It is speculated that the increase was caused by plugging of the aquifer by entrained air and fine suspended particles in the recharge water. The results indicate that step drawdown pumping tests on a particular well with conditions similar to those at R# 1 can be used to estimate the magnitude of B and C in that well tor recharging condition...|$|R

40|$|As a {{consequence}} of climate change, increased precipitation in winter and longer periods of decreased precipitation in summer are expected to cause more frequent episodes of very high or very low river discharge in the Netherlands. To study the impact of such extreme river <b>discharge</b> <b>conditions</b> on water quality, toxicity profiles and pollutant profiles were determined of suspended particulate matter (SPM) collected from Rivers Meuse and Rhine. Archived (1993 - 2003) and fresh (2009 - 2011) SPM samples were selected from the Dutch annual monitoring program of the national water bodies (MWTL), representing episodes with river <b>discharge</b> <b>conditions</b> ranging from very low to regular to very high. SPM extracts were tested in a battery of in vitro bioassays for their potency {{to interact with the}} androgen receptor (AR), the estrogen receptor (ER), the arylhydrocarbon receptor (AhR), and the thyroid hormone transporter protein transthyretin (TTR). SPM extracts were further tested for their mutagenic potency (Ames assay) and their potency to inhibit bacterial respiration (Vibrio fischeri bioluminescence assay). Target-analyzed pollutant concentrations of the SPM samples and additional sample information were retrieved from a public database of MWTL results. In vitro toxicity profiles and pollutant profiles were analyzed in relation to <b>discharge</b> <b>conditions</b> and in relation to each other using correlation analysis and multivariate statistics. Compared to regular <b>discharge</b> <b>conditions,</b> composition of SPM during very high River Meuse and Rhine discharges shifted to more coarse, sandy, organic carbon (OC) poor particles. On the contrary, very low discharge led to a shift to more fine, OC rich material, probably dominated by algae. This shift was most evident in River Meuse, which is characterized by almost stagnant water conditions during episodes of drought. During such episodes, SPM extracts from River Meuse demonstrated increased potencies to inhibit bacterial respiration and to compete with thyroid hormone to bind to TTR, possibly due to the presence of fycotoxins. Meanwhile concentrations of polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs) in SPM were also increased. Very high River Meuse discharges on the other hand corresponded to increased androgenic and AhR agoniztic responses, which coincided with increased PAH levels and PAH-related in vivo risk estimates (i. e. multi-substance potentially affected fraction of species; msPAF). In River Rhine, very high discharges also corresponded to increasing androgenic potencies in SPM. Concentrations and corresponding msPAF values of PAHs (and metals), however, decreased with very high discharges in River Rhine in contrast to River Meuse. Mutagenicity was observed for SPM extracts from River Rhine collected during all <b>discharge</b> <b>conditions,</b> except during regular discharge. Aggregated toxicity index values, which were useful to identify toxicity profiles deviating from the generally observed pattern, did not correlate with river discharges, probably due to opposite effects of <b>discharge</b> <b>conditions</b> on different bioassay responses. In conclusion, SPM quality and related in vivo risk estimates changed during very low or very high <b>discharge</b> <b>conditions</b> but the changes were specific for the different toxic endpoints and pollutants in the different rivers. Moreover, bioassay responses to a series of consecutively collected samples from River Rhine during the Christmas flood of 1993 indicated that SPM quality is variable within a single episode of extreme discharge...|$|E
