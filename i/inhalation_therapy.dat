40|$|Bacterial biofilm-associated chronic {{sinusitis}} in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections {{and the lack}} of available treatments for such infections constitute a critical aspect of CF disease management. Currently, <b>inhalation</b> <b>therapies</b> to combat P. aeruginosa infections in CF patients are focused mainly on the delivery of antimicrobials to the lower respiratory tract, disregarding the sinuses. However, the sinuses constitute a reservoir for P. aeruginosa growth, leading to re-infection of the lungs, even after clearing an initial lung infection. Eradication of P. aeruginosa from the respiratory tract after a first infection has been shown to delay chronic pulmonary infection with the bacteria for up to two years. The challenges with providing a suitable treatment for bacterial sinusitis include: (i) identifying a suitable antimicrobial compound; (ii) selecting a suitable device to deliver the drug to the sinuses and nasal cavities; and (iii) applying a formulation design, which will mediate delivery of a high dose of the antimicrobial directly to the site of infection.

40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been an {{increased}} focus on <b>inhalation</b> <b>therapies</b> in drug delivery research. It has been proven that many medications and vaccines can be inhaled in particle form, which has certain advantages. Respiratory diseases such as asthma and emphysema can be more directly treated by administering medications to the lungs. Even for non-respiratory conditions, the large internal surface area of the lungs provides a very effective means for entering the bloodstream. Particle processing of pharmaceuticals is commonly done in batches with toxic organic solvents; a large portion of drug processing costs come from multiple solvent separation steps. Another problem with batch processes is {{that it is difficult to}} achieve consistent particle size and distribution. To overcome these issues, many innovative particle engineering methods have been developed using supercritical fluids as the solvents or anti-solvents. One such process, ASES (Aerosol Solvent Extraction System), has proven to yield particles of the ideal size to administer by inhalation (1 - 5 microns) and uniform distribution necessary for reliable dosage. Also, a supercritical fluid such as CO 2, which is gaseous at room temperature, completely separates upo...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The human {{respiratory}} system {{is an important}} route for the entry of inhaled therapeutics into the body to treat diseases. Inhaled materials may consist of gases, vapours, aerosols and particulates. In all cases, assessing the toxicological effect of inhaled therapeutics has many challenges. Areas covered: This article {{provides an overview of}} in vivo and in vitro models for testing the toxicity of inhaled therapeutics and nanoparticles implemented in drug delivery. Traditionally, inhalation toxicity has been performed on test animals to identify the median lethal concentration of airborne materials. Later maximum tolerable concentration denoted by LC 0 has been introduced as a more ethically acceptable end point. More recently, in vitro methods have been developed, allowing the direct exposure of airborne material to cultured human target cells on permeable porous membranes at the air–liquid interface. Expert opinion: Modifications of current <b>inhalation</b> <b>therapies,</b> new pulmonary medications for respiratory diseases and implementation of the respiratory tract for systemic drug delivery are providing new challenges when conducting well-designed inhalation toxicology studies. In particular, the area of nanoparticles and nanocarriers is of critical toxicological concern.

40|$|The <b>inhalation</b> <b>therapies</b> were in use since ancient {{time and}} had their origin in India 4000 years ago. The inhalationtherapies include smoking of datura {{preparations}} for asthma and other lung complaints, which have come from thetraditional Ayurvedic therapies practised in India. The datura roots containing potent alkaloids with anticholinergicbronchodilating properties along with ginger and pepper were powdered and made into a paste for smearing on areed which is then dried and then smoked through a pipe. In late 18 th and 19 th century earthenware inhalers werepopular for inhalation of plants infusion and other ingredients. The atomizers and nebulizers were later developed inmid 1800 century {{as a response to}} the outgrowth of perfume industry. The spray technology was developed for theeffervescent waters at the thermal spas. In 20 th century combustible powders and cigarettes containing drugs for thetreatment of long complaints became popular. Subsequently hand-bulb nebulizers were developed and weresuccessful in the treatment of asthma using epinephrine. The drug was delivered by hand squeeze bulb nebulizer, butfailed to continue due to its fragile nature and the dose varied with the hand pressure [1]. The development of thefirst pressurized metered dose inhaler was the milestone in the development of inhaled drugs.

40|$|Background: Helium-oxygen {{has been}} used for decades as a {{respiratory}} therapy conjointly with aerosols. It has also been shown under some conditions to be a means to provide more peripheral, deeper, particle deposition for <b>inhalation</b> <b>therapies.</b> Furthermore, we can also consider deposition along parallel paths that are quite different, especially in a heterogeneous pathological lung. It is in this context that it is hypothesized that helium-oxygen can improve regional deposition, leading to more homogeneous deposition by increasing deposition in ventilation-deficient lung regions. Methods: Analytical models of inertial impaction, sedimentation, and diffusion are examined to illustrate the importance of gas property values on deposition distribution through both fluid mechanics– and particle mechanics–based mechanisms. Also considered are in vitro results from a bench model for a heterogeneously obstructed lung. In vivo results from three-dimensional (3 D) imaging techniques provide visual examples of changes in particle deposition patterns in asthmatics that are further analyzed using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Results and Conclusions: Based on analytical modeling, it is shown that deeper particle deposition is expected when breathing helium-oxygen, as compared with breathing air. A bench model has shown that more homogeneous ventilation distribution is possible breathing helium-oxygen in the presence of heterogeneous obstructions representative of central airway obstructions. 3 D imaging of asthmatics has confirmed that aerosol delivery with a helium-oxygen carrier gas results in deeper and more homogeneous deposition distributions. CFD results are consistent with the in vivo imaging and suggest that the mechanics of gas particle interaction are the source of the differences seen in deposition patterns. However, intersubject variability in response to breathing helium-oxygen is expected, and an example of a nonresponder is shown where regional deposition is not significantly changed. <br/...|$|R

40|$|Spas {{used for}} either {{therapeutic}} or recreational aims are considered {{at risk for}} legionellosis occurrence. Thermal water is normally used at temperature between 30 and 40 °C, ideal for Legionella growth, with a potential risk for users. Inhalation of colonized aerosol {{has been associated with}} sporadic cases or clusters of both Legionnaires’ disease and Pontiac fever, particularly involving immune depressed subjects. Italian and European guidelines have been issued to prevent and control this risk. At the spring, thermal water can contain small concentrations of legionellae, but within the distribution lines the amplification of these bacteria is promoted by stagnancy and incrustation, a frequent phenomenon also associated with the high mineral content of these waters. In addition, the detachment of dead cells, body lotions/creams residuals and skin debris in swimming pools favorites the bacteria multiplication. The devices/treatments more involved in transmission risk are <b>inhalation</b> <b>therapies,</b> frequently utilized by persons with chronic disease, showers and whirlpools, largely used also in the wellness centers. We revised the studies on Legionella spp presence in hot springs and related structures. The majority of published reports documented the germ contamination both at the source and along the distribution lines up to the point of use with increasing concentrations. Particular water characteristics such as high levels of sulfur and/or carbonate seem to be unfavorable to legionellae colonization but further studies are needed to deep this aspect. Contamination risk is less relevant for swimming pools due to high chlorine content, unless an insufficient disinfection plan is applied. From eighty years, about 50 studies have been published documenting cases of Legionnaires’ disease associated with spas. The majority of them occurred in Japan, where also a large outbreak is described with more than 300 persons involved.

To study the infection risk, the antibodies against Legionella have been evaluated in workers and patients attending the spa; the antibodies presence was found in a decreasing proportion from therapists to administration personnel.
