This paper presents a full-bridge architecture where the traditional single-phase transformer is replaced by a three-phase transformer.

In this paper, the aforementioned issues were tackled relying on an open-loop topology. Open-loop converters are feasible if the output resistance of the converter is as low as possible, and a possible solution is the minimization of power losses.
