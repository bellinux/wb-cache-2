5|$|Cẩn's men {{helped to}} cowl the populace into voting <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>brother.</b> Those who disobeyed were often chased down and beaten, with pepper sauce and water often forced down their nostrils. The {{violations}} were particularly flagrant in Cẩn's area, {{which was the}} home of the Nguyễn Dynasty and a source of sympathy towards Bảo Đại. Cẩn ordered the police to arrest 1,200 people for political reasons in the week leading up to the vote. In Hội An, some people were killed in election day violence.|$|E

5|$|In 629, B'alaj Chan K'awiil, {{a son of}} the Tikal king K'inich Muwaan Jol II, {{was sent}} to found a new city at Dos Pilas, in the Petexbatún region, {{apparently}} as an outpost to extend Tikal's power {{beyond the reach of}} Calakmul. For the next two decades he fought loyally <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>brother</b> and overlord at Tikal. In 648, king Yuknoom Ch'eenII of Calakmul captured Balaj Chan K'awiil. Yuknoom Ch'eenII then reinstated Balaj Chan K'awiil upon the throne of DosPilas as his vassal. He thereafter served as a loyal ally of Calakmul.|$|E

Joining forces with Edward, Alphonse defeats Eckhart and decides to stay with his brother to live in the parallel world.|$|E
5|$|King Richard III's {{interest}} in heraldry was indicated by his possession of two important rolls of arms. While still Duke of Gloucester and Constable of England <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>brother</b> (Edward IV) from 1469, {{he in the}} latter capacity supervised the heralds and made plans for the reform of their organisation. Soon after his accession to the throne he created Sir John Howard as Duke of Norfolk and Earl Marshal of England, who became the first Howard appointed to both positions.|$|E

5|$|On October 24, 2006, the Associated Press {{reported}} that Donald and Robert Hughes {{filed a lawsuit}} against Fox Broadcasting Company and the show's executive producer and creator, Paul Scheuring, for copyright infringement, seeking unspecified damages and other costs. They claimed that in 2001, they had sent Fox their manuscript which was based on their own experiences of a prison break at a juvenile facility. In the 1960s, Donald Hughes planned and successfully executed a prison escape <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>brother,</b> Robert Hughes, who was wrongfully incarcerated.|$|E
5|$|Pain {{was born}} {{some time before}} 1100. His father {{may have been in}} the service of King Henry in Normandy before Henry became king. The family lands in England, which were not extensive, were mainly in East Anglia, and Pain appears to have {{inherited}} most of them; his payment for danegeld, a tax, in 1130 for his East Anglian properties was 40shillings, compared to only 9 shillings <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>brother</b> Eustace.|$|E
5|$|With two {{competing}} archbishops, both claiming the see and the Electorate, the contenders {{and their supporters}} gathered the troops. In numbers, Ernst had the advantage. The Pope hired 5,000 mercenaries from the Farnese family to support the new Elector. Ernst's brother, the Duke of Bavaria, provided an army and Ernst arranged <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>brother</b> Ferdinand's army to take possession of the so-called Oberstift, the southern territory of the Electorate; his troops plundered many of its villages and towns.|$|E

5|$|Eddie Costa {{was born}} in Atlas, Pennsylvania, near Mount Carmel, in Northumberland County. He was taught and {{influenced}} on piano by his older, musically trained brother, Bill, and a local piano teacher. Eddie took paid jobs as a pianist {{from the age of}} 15. In contrast to his piano training, he was self-taught on vibes. In 1949 Costa played and toured for a few months with violinist Joe Venuti. He then worked <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>brother</b> in New York until, in 1951, Eddie was drafted into the army. During his time in the armed forces, Costa performed in Japan and Korea. Upon release after two years, Costa again worked around the New York area, including for bands led by Kai Winding, Johnny Smith, and Don Elliott.|$|E
5|$|Hal Rogers {{was also}} {{considered}} a suspect {{because he had}} posted bail <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>brother,</b> knowing he had abused Michelle. He later {{said that he had}} promised the family he would post bail and would not renege on his promise. Investigators from Florida and Ohio also discovered that Hal Rogers had withdrawn US$7,000 from his bank {{at the time of the}} disappearance, which he was able to account for. He had planned on using it to look for his wife and daughters before he was notified of their deaths. Investigations proved conclusively that he had never left Ohio during that period. The rape of Michelle Rogers, and gossip by local people, was one of the reasons for the Florida trip, so she and her sister and mother could distance themselves from the incident.|$|E
5|$|His {{introduction}} to films was unusual. When visiting an aunt {{who lived in}} Brooklyn opposite Vitagraph Studios, Cagney would climb over the fence to watch the filming of John Bunny movies. He became involved in amateur dramatics, starting as a scenery boy for a Chinese pantomime at Lenox Hill Neighborhood House, {{one of the first}} settlement houses in the nation, where his brother Harry performed and his soon-to-be friend, Florence James, directed. He was initially content working behind the scenes and had no interest in performing. One night, however, Harry became ill, and although Cagney was not an understudy, his photographic memory of rehearsals enabled him to stand in <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>brother</b> without making a single mistake. Therefore, Florence James has the unique distinction of being the first director to put him on a stage. Afterward, he joined a number of companies as a performer in a variety of roles.|$|E

5|$|Martin Filler {{acknowledged}} that the film legitimately used artistic licence to make valid dramatic points, {{such as in the}} probably imagined scene when George V lectures his son on the importance of broadcasting. Filler cautions that George VI would never have tolerated Logue addressing him casually, nor swearing, and the King almost certainly would have understood a newsreel of Hitler speaking in German. Filler makes the larger point that both the King and his wife were, in reality, lukewarm towards Churchill because of the latter's support <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>brother</b> during the abdication crisis. They only warmed to Churchill later in the war, because of his performance as a wartime leader.|$|E
5|$|Much {{the most}} {{prominent}} decoration on the cup is the cycle of scenes {{from the life of}} Saint Agnes, which is rarely depicted in such detail in art. However, there was one outstanding devotee of the saint in the period: King CharlesV of France, Berry's older brother and Charles VI's father. CharlesV was born in 1338 on Saint Agnes' feast day, January 21, and is recorded as owning at least 13 works of art featuring her, including a different gold cup enamelled with scenes from her life (both are recorded in the 1391 inventory). Until recent decades the generally accepted hypothesis was that Berry ordered the cup as a present <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>brother</b> in 1380, to be ready for his birthday in January 1381. When the king died in September 1380, Berry had retained it for a decade before presenting it to CharlesVI.|$|E
5|$|Nina McNary {{became the}} head of the household, while other {{siblings}} took jobs in order to provide for the family. As a boy, Charles worked as a paperboy, in an orchard, and at other farming tasks. He met Herbert Hoover, a future U.S. president, who moved to Salem in 1888. He later worked in the county recorder's office <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>brother</b> John Hugh McNary, who had been elected as county recorder in 1890, and for a short time attended the Capital Business College. After leaving that school, he enrolled in college preparatory classes at Willamette University, with an eye towards attending Stanford University or the University of California. During this time he met Jessie Breyman, whom he began dating, at a social club he helped start. Another member of the club was Oswald West, a future governor of Oregon.|$|E

5|$|Not {{having been}} {{involved}} in the coup d'état, Rainilaiarivony provided direction <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>brother</b> {{and the rest of the}} court as they grappled with the gravity of their acts. He proposed that future monarchs would no longer have absolute power but would instead rule by the consent of the nobles. A series of terms were proposed by Rainilaiarivony that the nobles agreed to impose on Radama's widow, Rasoherina. Under Rainilaiarivony's new monarchy, a sovereign required the consent of the nobles to issue a death sentence or promulgate a new law, and was forbidden to disband the army. The new power sharing agreement was concluded by a political marriage between the queen and the Prime Minister.|$|E
5|$|Scar sets a trap <b>for</b> <b>his</b> <b>brother</b> and nephew, luring Simba into a gorge {{and having}} the hyenas drive a large herd of {{wildebeest}} into a stampede that will trample him. He informs Mufasa of Simba's peril, knowing the king will rush to save his son. Mufasa saves Simba but ends up hanging perilously from the gorge's edge and is betrayed by Scar, who sends him falling to his death. Scar convinces Simba that the tragedy was Simba's own fault and advises him to flee the kingdom. He orders the hyenas to kill the cub, but Simba escapes. Scar tells the pride that both Mufasa and Simba {{were killed in the}} stampede and steps forward as the new king, allowing a large pack of hyenas to live in the Pride Lands.|$|E
