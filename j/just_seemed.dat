5|$|To {{tell the}} truth, I wasn't all that {{fond of the}} damned thing by then, but {{it had become a}} symbol for the men of the 8th Wing. I knew McConnell understood. During his visits to Ubon over the past year he had never {{referred}} to my breach of military standards, <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> rather amused at the variety of 'staches sported by many of the troops. (It) was the most direct order I had received in twenty-four years of service.|$|E
25|$|Because Siegel and Shuster {{were both}} Jewish, some {{religious}} commentators and pop-culture {{scholars such as}} Rabbi Simcha Weinstein and British novelist Howard Jacobson suggest that Superman's creation was partly influenced by Moses and other Jewish elements. However, Siegel and Shuster claim that having Superman {{drop out of the}} sky <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> like a good idea.|$|E
25|$|It {{seemed that}} no one in the Channel Nine box could make a comment about him that wasn't negative. His feet, hands, {{technique}} and temperament were questioned. His second-innings 46 was not enough. And they weren't always wrong. It <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> kind of mean. Especially when at the back of the press box some seemed happy when he was out. But it went deeper than McNamara's comments. Bailey had made mistakes in his career. He hadn't made enough first-class runs. He hadn't come into the team as a young man. He came into the captaincy without playing a game. He came into the Test team because of one-day runs. He was everything old-school cricket didn't like. A thinking cricketer who had never demanded inclusion, but who had been included regardless. For old-school types like Ian Chappell, he was pretty much everything he didn't like. And Chappell wasn't just turning on Bailey because of his stoush with Channel Nine. He had not liked Bailey for a long time.|$|E

500|$|The {{band was}} {{nominated}} for several MTV Video Music Awards during the 1990s. In 1996, the group won seven VMAs total for the [...] "1979" [...] and [...] "Tonight, Tonight" [...] videos, including the top award, Video of the Year, for [...] "Tonight, Tonight". The video was also nominated for a Grammy at the 1997 ceremony.

500|$|Gary Files as Matthew Harding (aged 28), a BISHOP agent {{paired with}} Unwin, {{who serves as}} his {{accomplice}} on assignment and as gardener of the vicarage in public life. Files retained fond memories {{of his time on}} The Secret Service, stating that he enjoyed voicing the character of Harding more than the character of Captain Magenta on Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons. He made significant contributions to Harding's characterisation, conceiving the rural accent of Unwin's assistant himself: [...] "It <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> so right for the character. Then once I had the voice, the rest of Matthew followed." ...|$|E
500|$|Wilson {{stated the}} name [...] "Mr. Lady" [...] {{came from a}} trip to Italy while on tour with Team Dresch: [...] "I saw a store called Mr. Baby, and it freaked me out. Then {{everyone}} started calling me Mr. Baby. Then I became Mr. Baby onstage. I had my own theme song and everything. I wore a little eyeliner mustache. From there it changed into Mr. Lady, which <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> like a good name for a queer label." [...] It also related to Ladyman, Wilson's first solo LP, produced with the aid of Melissa York after they both left lesbian [...] "supergroup" [...] Team Dresch.|$|E
500|$|Margaret Lyons of Entertainment Weekly {{was more}} critical, {{referring}} {{to it as}} [...] "forced, off pitch, and strenuously unfunny". She was also critical of Michael's interaction with the youth group, writing that it [...] "didn't add any development to his character or to the show's broader arcs; it <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> weird, and not that humorous." [...] Despite this, she praised the cold opening, featuring Pam lecturing the office on proper hygiene. HitFix reviewer Alan Sepinwall called the episode [...] "spectacularly unfunny" [...] and criticized the writers for using Michael's loneliness as a joke instead of taking it seriously like {{they had in the}} fourth season episode [...] "Money". Despite this, he complimented Lieberstein's performance as Toby while he was questioning God.|$|E

The 45-minute film audible visions of (sic)nesses features Slipknot during and in-between gigs on the All Hope Is Gone World Tour. Shawn Crahan stated that, [...] "Going in and filming this, it <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> like {{there was no way}} it could fail. It {{was going to be in}} the top five best shows of our careers, and that's basically what it was: we got off the stage and all nine of us [...] felt the same thing, we knew that we destroyed 80,000 people. Watching it back just brings tears to my eyes".|$|E
500|$|... "Elegy" [...] {{was written}} by John Shiban and {{directed}} by James Charleston. The episode was inspired by an event that happened when Shiban and his future wife were visiting her father in the hospital. According to Shiban, he was very near death and kept looking around the room, {{even though there were}} only two visitors with him. Eventually, he asked his daughter how many people were in the room. When his daughter revealed that there were only two people with him, he kept looking around the room. Shiban was inspired by the idea that [...] "a dying person might be able to look through the cracks [...] into the next world". He developed a premise revolving around a [...] "haunted bowling alley" [...] because [...] "it <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> right".|$|E
500|$|Tweedy {{felt the}} new members {{gave him a}} new {{opportunity}} {{to contribute to the}} band, but Farrar felt disdain for Tweedy's new carefree attitude. Years later, Farrar would claim that he had been tempted to quit the band after seeing Tweedy stroking the hair of Farrar's girlfriend, an act which he believed to have been a proposition. In January 1994, Farrar called manager Tony Margherita to inform him of his decision to leave the band. Farrar told Margherita that he was no longer having fun, and didn't want to work with Tweedy anymore. Soon after the breakup, Farrar explained his departure: [...] "It <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> like it reached a point where Jeff and I really weren't compatible. It had ceased to be a symbiotic songwriting relationship, probably after the first record." ...|$|E

5000|$|Pitchfork was critical, writing, [...] "Beyond the melodies that dont {{stick in}} my head and the beats that dont make me want to dance, the only real problem with Souljacker ... is that it <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> like an underachievement." ...|$|R
500|$|Not all reviews were positive. Matt Mitovich from TV Guide {{wrote that}} [...] "Larry King" [...] was [...] "pretty blah. Something about it <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> drab and lifeless, {{as if the}} writers and cast were in a mad dash to break for Christmas." [...] The A.V. Clubs Scott Tobias {{believed}} that the episode was not up to [...] "30 Rocks high standards" [...] and commented that a [...] "big problem" [...] was Jack and Elisa's storyline. [...] "The concept of rich, superficial, commitment-phobic workaholic Jack falling for his exact opposite isn't a bad one, but Hayek's run has been {{more or less a}} wash." [...] Tobias further added that Alec Baldwin and Salma Hayek [...] "are an odd couple" [...] citing {{that they do not have}} much chemistry together.|$|E
500|$|Other {{critics are}} more demanding. M. Keith Booker writes: For their part, the Coens deny any {{intention}} of presenting an allegorical message. They chose the detectives' names deliberately, but [...] "we just {{wanted them to be}} representative of the Axis world powers at the time. It <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> kind of amusing. It's a tease. All that stuff with Charlie– [...] the [...] "Heil Hitler!" [...] business– [...] sure, it's all there, but it's kind of a tease." [...] In 2001, Joel responded to a question about critics who provide extended comprehensive analysis: [...] "That's how they've been trained to watch movies. In Barton Fink, we may have encouraged it– [...] like teasing animals at the zoo. The movie is intentionally ambiguous in ways they may not be used to seeing".|$|E
500|$|During the July 23, 2007, CNN-YouTube presidential debate, Gravel {{responded to}} {{audience}} applause {{when he had}} complained {{of a lack of}} airtime and said: [...] "Thank you. Has it been fair thus far?" [...] Detractors began to liken him to [...] "the cranky uncle who lives in the attic," [...] or [...] "the angry old guy that <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> to want to become angrier." [...] Berkeley political scientist David Terr found that moderator George Stephanopoulos directed roughly five percent of his questions to Gravel; in a poll asking who did the best in the debate, Gravel placed seventh among the eight candidates. National opinion polls of contenders for the Democratic nomination continued to show Gravel with one percent or zero percent numbers. By the end of the third-quarter 2007, Gravel had about $17,500 in cash on hand, had collected a total of about $380,000 so far during the 2008 election cycle, and was continuing to run a threadbare campaign with minimal staff.|$|E
5000|$|In a 2004 interview, Trump told CNN's Wolf Blitzer: [...] "In many cases, I {{probably}} identify more as Democrat," [...] explaining: [...] "It <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> {{that the}} economy does better under the Democrats than the Republicans. Now, it shouldn't be that way. But if you go back, I mean it <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> {{that the economy}} does better under the Democrats ... But certainly we had some very good economies under Democrats, as well as Republicans. But we've had some pretty bad disaster under the Republicans." [...] In a July 2015 interview, Trump {{said that he has}} a broad range of political positions and that [...] "I identify with some things as a Democrat." ...|$|R
5000|$|Kevin Downey of TV NewsCheck {{also gave}} the show a {{positive}} review {{during an interview}} with Lake after having attended a taping, noting that [...] "This time, they (referring to the audience) <b>just</b> <b>seem</b> to want Lake to know they're happy she's back." ...|$|R
5000|$|Theroux remains {{optimistic about}} Africa: [...] "I'm not pessimistic about Africa. The cities <b>just</b> <b>seem</b> big and hopeless. But there's {{still a great}} green heart where there's possibility. There's hope in the {{wilderness}} ... What Africa needs is a little organization and better government." ...|$|R
500|$|In 2004 Beckinsale {{starred in}} the action horror film Van Helsing. She was [...] "so surprised" [...] to be {{appearing}} in her second action film in two years. [...] "It <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> like a very good role." [...] Beckinsale had just separated from her long-term boyfriend Michael Sheen {{at the time of}} filming and appreciated the warm atmosphere created on set by director Stephen Sommers and co‑star Hugh Jackman: [...] "I really did find that working with people like Stephen and Hugh made it possible to get through what I was going through." [...] The film grossed over $120 million at the U.S. box office and over $300 million worldwide, but it was not well-reviewed. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle described her as [...] "a pretty actress doing her best to maintain dignity, vainly trying to craft a feminist statement from a filmmaker's whimsy" [...] while Rex Reed of The New York Observer felt she was [...] "desperately in need of a new agent." ...|$|E
500|$|Clem Hill said, [...] "As {{a captain}} Harry Trott {{was in a}} class by himself—the best I ever played under. [...] Harry was quick to grasp a situation. He saw an opponent's {{weakness}} in a second. [...] Time and time again, he got a champion batsman's wicket by putting on a bowler he knew the batsman did not like." [...] The English batsman K. S. Ranjitsinhji considered Trott as a captain [...] "without a superior anywhere today". Wisden thought him, [...] "with the exception of ... incomparably the best captain the Australians had ever had in this country." [...] The sporting newspaper The Referee wrote, [...] " [...] bowlers felt he understood the gruelling nature of their work and that they had his sympathy in the grimmest of battles." [...] Some English professional cricketers thought less of Trott's captaincy; wicket-keeper William Storer said, [...] "I like a captain to have a settled plan, [...] <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> to do whatever he thought of at the moment." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{received}} heavy airplay on MTV and won several awards. Corgan remarked that [...] "I don't think we've ever had people react ...it <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> {{to touch a}} nerve." [...] It won six awards at the MTV Video Music Awards in 1996: Video of the Year, Breakthrough Video, Best Direction in a Video (Directors: Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris), Best Special Effects in a Video (Special Effects: Chris Staves), Best Art Direction in a Video (Art Director: K. K. Barrett and Wayne White) and Best Cinematography in a Video (Director of Photography: Declan Quinn). [...] "Tonight, Tonight" [...] was nominated for Best Editing in a Video (Editor: Eric Zumbrunnen) and Viewer's Choice, and was also nominated for Best Music Video, Short Form at the 39th Annual Grammy Awards.

5000|$|The name {{is derived}} {{primarily}} {{from the fact that}} things <b>just</b> <b>seem</b> to come out of nowhere for the scientists, although there are other plot points that the name is based on as well. It was also influenced by the Beatles song [...] "Nowhere Man".|$|R
5000|$|Deborah Evans Price, of Billboard {{magazine}} {{reviewed the}} song favorably, {{saying that the}} strongest thing about the single is Strait's [...] "heartfelt delivery."

5000|$|Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club graded {{the episode}} a B-, writing, [...] "Valerie's mental illness <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> {{a little too}} controlled, a little too cool, somehow.
