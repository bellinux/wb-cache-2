The Motoranlage was the original form of the interchangeable Kraftei, or [...] "power-egg", unitized powerplant installation concept used in many German wartime aircraft. It was most often used with twin and multi-engined designs, with some need for external add-ons. The more comprehensive Triebwerksanlage format for unitization consolidated more of the engine's required accessory systems beyond what the earlier Motoranlage concept could, plus some external mountings, such as an integrally complete exhaust system (including a turbocharger, if fitted as part of the design), as a completely <b>interchangeable</b> <b>unit.</b> Both M and T formats were also used with various inline engines, like the Daimler-Benz DB 603 used for both the inline-engined versions of the Do 217 and the enormous Bv 238 flying boat, and the Junkers Jumo 213 powerplants used for later marks of the Ju 88 multirole aircraft.|$|E

40|$|To {{examine the}} {{evolutionary}} relationships {{between members of}} the myosin family, we have used two different phylogenetic methods, distance matrix and maximum parsimony, to analyze all available myosin head sequences. We find that {{there are at least}} three equally divergent classes of myosin, demonstrating that the current classification of myosin into only two classes needs to be reexamined. In the myosin II class, smooth muscle myosin is more closely related to nonmuscle myosin than to striated muscle myosin, implying that smooth muscle and skeletal muscle myosins were independently derived from nonmuscle myosin and suggesting that similarities between these types of muscle are the result of convergent evolution. The grouping of head sequences produced by phylogenetic analysis is consistent with classifications based on enzymology and structural localization and is generally consistent with grouping based on common tail structure elements. This result demonstrates that specific head sequences are tightly coupled to specific tail sequences throughout evolution and challenges the idea that myosin heads are freely <b>interchangeable</b> <b>units</b> whose unique function is determined only by the tail structure to which it is attached...|$|R
40|$|Two {{types of}} {{sustainability}} definitions are contrasted. 'Social scientific' definitions, {{such as that}} of the Brundtland Commission, treat sustainability as a relationship between present and future welfare of persons. These definitions differ from 'ecological' ones which explicitly require protection of ecological processes as a condition on sustainability. 'Scientific contextualism' does not follow mainstream economists in their efforts to express all effects as <b>interchangeable</b> <b>units</b> of individual welfare; it rather strives to express sensitivity to different types and scales of impacts that present activities can exert on the future. We can therefore express the moral obligation to act sustainably as an obligation to protect the natural processes that form the context of human life and culture, emphasizing those large biotic and abiotic systems essential to human life, health, and flourishing culture. Ecosystems, which are understood as dynamic, self-organizing systems humans have evolved within, must remain 'healthy' if humans are to thrive. The ecological approach to sustainability therefore sets the protection of dynamic, creative systems in nature as its primary goal. sustainability,ecological management,obligations to future generations,intergenerational equity,irreversibility...|$|R

We show that the AND-version of the multicriteria global minimum cut problem is polynomial for any fixed number k of criteria. The OR-version of the problem, on the other hand, is NP-hard even for k = 2, but can be solved in pseudo-polynomial time for any fixed number k of criteria. It also admits an FPTAS. Further extensions, some applications, and multicriteria versions of two other optimization problems are also discussed. ...|$|R

In the present study, the relationships between three different units of cough were examined and their ability to predict subjective ratings of cough and cough-related quality of life were evaluated. In total, 70 subjects (mean¡SD age 55 ¡ 11. 7 yrs, 51 (73 %) females) with chronic unexplained cough (median duration 4. 8 yrs, interquartile range 2. 5 – 10. 1 yrs) performed fully ambulatory 24 -h sound recordings, which were manually counted by trained observers and quantified by 1) explosive phases, 2) cough seconds and 3) cough epochs. Subjects also completed cough visual analogue scales (VAS) and the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ). All units of cough were strongly correlated; explosive phases and cough seconds correlated slightly more strongly than cough seconds with cough epochs or explosive phases with cough epochs.

40|$|The {{enormous}} {{complexity of}} biological networks {{has led to}} the suggestion that networks are built of modules that perform particular functions and are “reused” in evolution {{in a manner similar to}} reusable domains in protein structures or modules of electronic circuits. Analysis of known biological networks has revealed several modules, many of which have transparent biological functions. However, it remains to be shown that identified structural modules constitute evolutionary building blocks, independent and easily <b>interchangeable</b> <b>units.</b> An alternative possibility is that evolutionary modules do not match structural modules. To investigate the structure of evolutionary modules and their relationship to functional ones, we integrated a metabolic network with evolutionary associations between genes inferred from comparative genomics. The resulting metabolic–genomic network places metabolic pathways into evolutionary and genomic context, thereby revealing previously unknown components and modules. We analyzed the integrated metabolic–genomic network on three levels: macro-, meso-, and microscale. The macroscale level demonstrates strong associations between neighboring enzymes and between enzymes that are distant on the network but belong to the same linear pathway. At the mesoscale level, we identified evolutionary metabolic modules and compared them with traditional metabolic pathways. Although, in some cases, there is almost exact correspondence, some pathways are split into independent modules. On the microscale level, we observed high association of enzyme subunits and weak association of isoenzymes independently catalyzing the same reaction. This study shows that evolutionary modules, rather than pathways, may be thought of as regulatory and functional units in bacterial genomes...|$|R

The surface components, made of individual β‐cyclodextrin molecules, are the “hosts” for functional units, which may be used as imaging agents, for anti‐cancer drug delivery, and as tumor‐specific ligands. Specifically, individual β‐cyclodextrin (β‐CD), with a known capability to host various molecules, is considered a module unit that is assembled onto graphene nanosheet (GNS). The cyclodextrin‐functionalized graphene nanosheet (GNS/β‐CD) enables “host–guest” chemistry between the nanohybrid and functional “payloads”. The structure, composition, and morphology of the graphene nanosheet hybrid have been investigated. The nanohybrid, GNS/β‐CD, is highly dispersive in various physiological solutions, reflecting the high biostability of cyclodextrin. Regarding the host capability, the nanohybrid is fully capable of selectively accommodating various biological and functional agents in a controlled fashion, including the antivirus drug amantadine, fluorescent dye [5 (6) ‐carboxyfluorescein], and Arg‐Gly‐Asp (RGD) peptide‐targeting ligands assisted by an adamantine linker.

40|$|Biparental care of {{offspring}} is {{a widespread}} social behavior, and various ecological, life-history, and demographic factors have been proposed to explain its evolution and maintenance. Raising offspring generally requires several types of care (e. g., feeding, brooding, and defense), and males and females often specialize in providing different types of care. However, theoretical models of care often assume that care is a single variable and hence that a unit of care by the mother is <b>interchangeable</b> with a <b>unit</b> of care by the father. We hypothesize that the ability of one parent to provide all types of care may be limited by nonadditive costs or by sex-based asymmetries in the costs of particular care types. Using an individual-based simulation, we show that synergistic costs of investing in two tasks or negligible sex-based cost asymmetries select for task specialization and biparental care. Biparental care persists despite intense sexual selection and sex-biased mortality, suggesting that previous models make overly restrictive predictions of {{the conditions under which}} cooperation can be maintained. Our model provides a mechanistic underpinning for published models that show that the synergistic benefits of individuals cooperating can stabilize cooperation, both in the context of parental care and in other social scenarios. ...|$|R
40|$|In Drosophila melanogaster, 240 -base-pair (bp) repeats, {{clustered}} in tandem arrays within the ribosomal DNA nontranscribed spacer region, include sites of RNA polymerase I-dependent transcription initiation and elements that stimulate {{the rate of}} transcription from the downstream precursor rRNA (pre-rRNA) promoter. We have analyzed the in vivo transcriptional activity of a large set of recombinant constructs in which tandem arrays of distinct segments derived from a 240 -bp repeat were inserted upstream of the pre-rRNA promoter. The results indicate that activating spacer elements are confined to a region of 70 bp. Enhancing units overlap with spacer promoters, since DNA segments that stimulate transcription at the gene promoter also efficiently drive transcription initiation. The finding that artificial spacer arrays invariably stimulate pre-rRNA transcription initiation in an orientation-dependent fashion suggest that spacer-initiated transcription {{is involved in the}} enhancement process. The minimal spacer activating segment includes a perfect copy of a core domain of the gene promoter extending from - 24 to + 10 flanked by poorly homologous upstream DNA sequences.
