We develop the unique, non-linear elastic properties of twisted filament bundles that derive from generic properties of two-dimensional line-ordered materials. Continuum elasticity reveals a formal equivalence between the elastic stresses induced by bundle twist and those induced by the positive curvature in thin, elastic sheets. These geometrically-induced stresses can be screened by 5 -fold disclination <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> lattice <b>packing,</b> and we predict a discrete spectrum elastic energy groundstates associated with integer numbers of disclinations in cylindrical bundles. Finally, we show that elastic-energy groundstates are extremely sensitive to <b>defect</b> position <b>in</b> the cross-section, with off-center disclinations driving the entire bundle to buckle, adopting globally writhing configurations.

40|$|AbstractSensing {{membrane}} curvature allows fine-tuning {{of complex}} reactions that {{occur at the}} surface of membrane-bound organelles. One of the most sensitive membrane curvature sensors, the Amphipathic Lipid Packing Sensor (ALPS) motif, {{does not seem to}} recognize the curved surface geometry of membranes per se; rather, it recognizes <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> lipid <b>packing</b> that arise from membrane bending. In a companion paper, we show that these defects can be mimicked by introducing conical lipids in a flat lipid bilayer, in agreement with experimental observations. Here, we use molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations to characterize ALPS binding to such lipid bilayers. The ALPS motif recognizes lipid-packing defects by a conserved mechanism: peptide partitioning is driven by the insertion of hydrophobic residues into large packing defects that are preformed in the bilayer. This insertion induces only minor modifications in the statistical distribution of the free packing defects. ALPS insertion is severely hampered when monounsaturated lipids are replaced by saturated lipids, leading to a decrease <b>in</b> <b>packing</b> <b>defects.</b> We propose that the hypersensitivity of ALPS motifs to lipid packing defects results from the repetitive use of hydrophobic insertions along the monotonous ALPS sequence...|$|R

In {{order to understand}} the microstructure of these surface packings, the ordering of hard spheres on ellipsoidal surfaces is determined through large scale computer simulations. <b>Defects</b> <b>in</b> the <b>packing</b> are shown generically to occur most often in regions of strong curvature; however, the relationship between defects and curvature is nontrivial, and the distribution of defects shows secondary maxima for ellipsoids of sufficiently high aspect ratio. As with packings on spherical surfaces, additional defects beyond those required by topology are observed as chains or 'scars'. The transition point, however, is found to be softened by the anisotropic curvature which also partially orients the scars. A rich library of symmetric commensurate packings are identified for low particle number. We verify experimentally that ellipsoidal droplets of varying aspect ratio can be arrested by surface-adsorbed colloids. Comment: 11 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to apicobasal polarization, some epithelia also display polarity within {{the plane of}} the epithelium. To what extent polarized endocytosis plays a role in the establishment and maintenance of planar cell polarity (PCP) is at present unclear. Here, we investigated the role of Rabenosyn- 5 (Rbsn- 5), an evolutionarily conserved effector of the small GTPase Rab 5, in the development of Drosophila wing epithelium. We found that Rbsn- 5 regulates endocytosis at the apical side of the wing epithelium and, surprisingly, further uncovered a novel function of this protein in PCP. At early stages of pupal wing development, the PCP protein Fmi redistributes between the cortex and Rab 5 - and Rbsn- 5 -positive early endosomes. During planar polarization, Rbsn- 5 is recruited at the apical cell boundaries and redistributes along the proximodistal axis in an Fmidependent manner. At pre-hair formation, Rbsn- 5 accumulates at the bottom of emerging hairs. Loss of Rbsn- 5 causes intracellular accumulation of Fmi and typical PCP alterations such as <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> cell <b>packing,</b> <b>in</b> the polarized distribution of PCP proteins, and in hair orientation and formation. Our results suggest that establishment of planar polarity requires the activity of Rbsn- 5 in regulating both the endocytic trafficking of Fmi at the apical cell boundaries and hair morphology...|$|R
40|$|Phosphatidic acid (PA) is {{emerging}} as a key phospholipid {{in a wide range}} of biological processes such as signal transduction, secretion, or membrane fusion. In most cases, the biological functionality of PA is associated with the presence of micromolar to millimolar calcium concentrations. It has been argued that PA can create <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> the <b>packing</b> of lipids <b>in</b> membranes due to lateral phase separation by divalent ions, which in turn aggregate proteins with high affinity for PA. In this article, we present a detailed investigation of the properties of PA domains in the presence of divalent ions by a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and theoretical methods. Our results show that PA is extremely effective in binding divalent ions through its oxygen atoms, with a broad distribution of binding constants and exhibiting the phenomenon of charge inversion (a total number of bound counterion charges that exceeds the negative PA charge). We predict that a PA-rich domain undergoes a drastic reorganization when divalent cations reach micromolar concentrations (i. e., typical physiological conditions), as PA lipids become doubly charged by releasing their protons. We also present a detailed investigation of the properties of interfacial water, which determine the binding of proteins or other molecules. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of our results in the context of recent experimental studies in model systems and in real cells...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAggregation of α-synuclein is {{involved}} in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Studies of in vitro aggregation of α-synuclein are rendered complex because of the formation of a heterogeneous population of oligomers. With the use of confocal single-molecule fluorescence techniques, we demonstrate that small aggregates (oligomers) of α-synuclein formed from unbound monomeric species in the presence of organic solvent (DMSO) and iron (Fe 3 +) ions have a high affinity to bind to model membranes, regardless of the lipid-composition or membrane curvature. This binding mode contrasts with the well-established membrane binding of α-synuclein monomers, which is accompanied with α-helix formation and requires membranes with high curvature, <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> the lipid <b>packing,</b> and/or negatively charged lipids. Additionally, we demonstrate that membrane-bound α-synuclein monomers are protected from aggregation. Finally, we identified compounds that potently dissolved vesicle-bound α-synuclein oligomers into monomers, leaving the lipid vesicles intact. As it is commonly believed that formation of oligomers is related PD progression, such compounds may provide a promising strategy for the design of novel therapeutic drugs in Parkinson's disease...|$|R
40|$|A {{previous}} {{study of the}} retinitis pigmentosa mutation L 125 R and two designed mutations at this site, L 125 A and L 125 F, showed that these mutations cause partial or total misfolding of the opsins expressed in COS cells from the corresponding mutant opsin genes. We now report on expression and characterization of the opsins from the following retinitis pigmentosa mutants in the transmembrane domain of rhodopsin that correspond to six of the seven helices: G 51 A and G 51 V (helix A), G 89 D (helix B), A 164 V (helix D), H 211 P (helix E), P 267 L and P 267 R (helix F), and T 297 R (helix G). All the mutations caused partial misfolding of the opsins as observed by the UV/visible absorption characteristics and by separation of the expressed opsins into fractions that bound 11 -cis-retinal to form the corresponding mutant rhodopsins and those that did not bind 11 -cis-retinal. Further, all the mutant rhodopsins prepared from the above mutants, except for G 51 A, showed strikingly abnormal bleaching behavior with abnormal metarhodopsin II photointermediates. The results show that retinitis pigmentosa mutations {{in every one of}} the transmembrane helices can cause misfolding of the opsin. Therefore, {{on the basis of these}} and previous results, we conclude that <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> the <b>packing</b> of the transmembrane helices resulting from these mutations are relayed to the intradiscal domain, where they cause misfolding of the opsin by inducing the formation of a disulfide bond other than the native Cys- 110 —Cys- 187 disulfide bond. Thus, there is coupling between packing of the helices in the transmembrane domain and folding to a tertiary structure in the intradiscal domain...|$|R

Methods and Materials: Eighteen New Zealand rabbits were used in the experiment. A 1 -cm wide region of mucoperiosteum, nasal mucosa, and bone between the incisor and premolar teeth was excised from {{the left side of the}} palate to create a defect. These gaps were left open and unfilled in 6 animals as a control (group 1). <b>Defects</b> <b>in</b> a second group of 6 animals were packed with calcium sulfate (group 2). The osseous <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> a third group of 6 animals were filled with bovine demineralized xenographic bone particles, and the soft tissue gaps were covered with calcium sulfate (group 3). The various sites were evaluated clinically at 1, 3, and 4 weeks, and then at 3 months after surgery. All animals were killed at the 3 months period, and the sites were evaluated histologically. Results: The calcium sulfate had resorbed and the mucoperiosteal margins of the <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> both experimental groups had regenerated and the soft tissue gaps were closed at 4 weeks.

40|$|Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) {{are widely}} used in surface modifications, {{specifically}} in tuning the surface chemistry of materials. The structure and properties of SAMs have been extensively studied often with sophisticated tools, even for the simplest n-alkanethiolate SAMs. In SAMs, especially in linear n-alkanethiolates, the properties are dependent on the chain length, which is best manifested in the so-called odd–even effect, a simple yet not fully understood phenomenon. One main challenge is fully delineating the origin of length-dependent properties, which can {{be due to the}} structure (ideal SAMs), defect evolution, or substrate-molecule effects. This study demonstrates that utilizing the wetting behavior of polar (water) and nonpolar (hexadecane (HD)) solvents on n-alkanethiolate SAMs formed on ultraflat gold and silver surfaces, the evolution of chain-length-dependent gauche defects can be revealed and parameterized through a newly defined dimensionless number (χ). The observation of the odd–even effect in hydrophobicity, however, depends on the thiol chain length, and it was only observed on longer-chain (3 ̆eC 8) molecules. The trend in this odd–even effect demonstrates that there are three main transitions in the nature of wetting, hence structure, across n-alkanethiols. From wetting with HD, the role of dispersive components in wetting reveal that the SAMs are dynamic, which we attribute to rotations associated with previously reported evolution <b>in</b> gauche <b>defects</b> and changes <b>in</b> <b>packing</b> density. Therefore, from re-expression of the Young–Dupre equation, we define a new dimensionless number associated with molecular conformations, whose periodicity mirrors the energetics of Goodman’s conformations of n-alkanes in unbound states and associated four- or two-twist turns. Therefore, we infer that the evolution in surface energy is largely due to molecular conformations and associated relaxations of the bound thiolates...|$|R
