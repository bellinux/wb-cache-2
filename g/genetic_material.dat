5|$|In the 1980s, the Conservancy began a {{gene bank}} {{designed}} {{to preserve the}} <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> of rare breeds. After collecting <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> from over a dozen rare breeds, the bank {{was transferred to the}} USDA National Animal Germplasm Program (NAGP). It maintains a close relationship with the NAGP, including assisting in the collection of <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> from additional rare breeds. The conservation list published by the Conservancy is also used by the SVF Foundation, an organization that uses cryopreservation to preserve germplasm from rare breeds. In the early 1990s, the organization mounted displays of historic rare breed livestock illustrations at the National Agricultural Library and the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, designed to raise public awareness of the declining populations of rare livestock breeds.|$|E

5|$|Domestication is {{also studied}} {{by using the}} <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> of present-day horses and {{comparing}} it with the <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> present in the bones and teeth of horse remains found in archaeological and palaeological excavations. The variation in the <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> shows that very few wild stallions contributed to the domestic horse, while many mares were part of early domesticated herds. This {{is reflected in the}} difference in genetic variation between the DNA that is passed on along the paternal, or sire line (Y-chromosome) versus that passed on along the maternal, or dam line (mitochondrial DNA). There are very low levels of Y-chromosome variability, but a great deal of genetic variation in mitochondrial DNA. There is also regional variation in mitochondrial DNA due to the inclusion of wild mares in domestic herds. Another characteristic of domestication is an increase in coat color variation. In horses, this increased dramatically between 5000 and 3000 BC.|$|E

40|$|Mass {{selection}} {{during early}} stages of genotype evaluation is essential for maize breeding programs. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the proper conditions for mass selecting useful genotypes in segregating maize <b>genetic</b> <b>materials.</b> F 1 /F 2 comparisons were made to evaluate the <b>genetic</b> <b>materials</b> and F 1 /F 2 and F 2 mixtures of genotypes were formed to ensure allocompetition conditions. Moreover, two severe stresses were applied: plant density and low inputs, in addition to full-inputs conditions. Prisma F 1 and F 2 were better yielding materials than Funo F 1 and F 2, respectively. Until 13. 33 plants m - 2 there was an increase in F 1 field yields, followed by lower yields in increased plant density, since modern hybrids tolerate greater plant populations. Significant interaction between <b>genetic</b> <b>materials</b> and plant density found in full-inputs experiments, was eliminated under the strong low-inputs stress. The indications from Half-sib progeny evaluation showed strong relationship between progeny yield and both selected plants' yield and selection differential. High selection differential was realized under low-inputs condition due to low performance of original <b>genetic</b> <b>materials.</b> Strong allocompetition conditions may have a negative effect on HS progeny yielding performance, since mixtures of different <b>genetic</b> <b>materials</b> lead to lower yields. As a final conclusion, present findings indicated that selection of genotypes must be practiced under conditions of high selection differential. The original population mean is not as important as the selection differential. Extended experimentation must include S 1 and Full-sib progenies and selection of progeny plants must include not only the highest yielding plants, but plants from the upper, mean and lower yielding areas of yield distribution, as well. © 2007 Asian Network for Scientific Information...|$|R

5|$|Archaea {{reproduce}} asexually by binary {{or multiple}} fission, fragmentation, or budding; meiosis does not occur, so if {{a species of}} archaea exists {{in more than one}} form, all have the same <b>genetic</b> <b>material.</b> Cell division is controlled in a cell cycle; after the cell's chromosome is replicated and the two daughter chromosomes separate, the cell divides. In the genus Sulfolobus, the cycle has characteristics that are similar to both bacterial and eukaryotic systems. The chromosomes replicate from multiple starting-points (origins of replication) using DNA polymerases that resemble the equivalent eukaryotic enzymes.|$|E
5|$|Besides regular sexual {{reproduction}} with meiosis, certain fungi, {{such as those}} in the genera Penicillium and Aspergillus, may exchange <b>genetic</b> <b>material</b> via parasexual processes, initiated by anastomosis between hyphae and plasmogamy of fungal cells.
