After completing serialisation of Prisoners of the Sun in April 1949, he ordered his staff to re-serialise one of his old stories, Popol and Virginia, while he took a three-month break. At this point, Hergé was depressed and suffering from a range of physical ailments, including boils and eczema on his hands. Although fed up with The Adventures of Tintin, he <b>felt</b> <b>great</b> pressure on him to continue producing the series for Tintin magazine.|$|E

Not only no bodies; there were also no {{suitcases}} or large bags. I did not miss a single dive. I have quite a clear impression: The aircraft was filled with garbage, but there were really no people there. Why? Usually when an aircraft crashes, even a small one... As a rule there are suitcases and bags, or at least the handles of the suitcases." ...|$|E
500|$|On July 16, 1945, Lawrence {{observed}} the Trinity nuclear {{test of the}} first atomic bomb with Chadwick and Charles A. Thomas. Few were more excited at its success than Lawrence. The {{question of how to}} use the now functional weapon on Japan became an issue for the scientists. [...] While Oppenheimer favored no demonstration {{of the power of the}} new weapon to Japanese leaders, Lawrence felt strongly that a demonstration would be wise. When a uranium bomb was used without warning in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, Lawrence <b>felt</b> <b>great</b> pride in his accomplishment.|$|E
500|$|In 1986, John Mortimer, {{a writer}} whom Hordern {{respected}} greatly, engaged the actor in Paradise Postponed, an eleven-part drama which {{took a year}} to make and cost in excess of £6 million. Set in rural England, the saga depicts the struggles within British middle-class society during the post-war years. In his biography, Hordern described himself as [...] "a man of prejudice rather than principle" [...] and as such, had very {{little in common with}} his character, the left-wing, Marxist-loving vicar, Simeon Simcox. [...] Despite the political differences, Hordern <b>felt</b> <b>great</b> empathy towards his character, and admired his [...] "plain, straightforward attitude to life, his dottiness, and the way he hung to his faith in a wicked world with a saintliness verging on the simple".|$|E

500|$|Lehto {{recalled}} that making a character-driven story {{was a great}} challenge—players would come {{to know more about}} them as they progressed through the campaign, but the Spartan characters also had to behave intelligently. [...] "The Halo games consistently featured protagonists that were silent during gameplay sequences. Community manager Brian Jarrard pushed for allowing players to choose a female Noble Six and have the cinematics and dialogue change accordingly. The post-credit game sequence was the subject of intense discussion; some at Bungie wanted to remove it. Executive producer Joe Tung noted, [...] "the 'survive' component ... <b>felt</b> <b>great</b> to us. We definitely talked about different versions of how that was happening and different versions of ending [...] cinematically, but I think the way that it ultimately ended up is just a really well-paced, significant and emotionally impactful ending." ...|$|E
500|$|The game {{received}} [...] "generally favorable" [...] reviews, {{according to}} video game review aggregator Metacritic. Gamezebo named the title {{among the best}} mobile games released in June 2015. Reviewers praised the cleverness and minimalism of its puzzle design, but wanted more variety from its activity-dense scenarios. They noted how they came to know the characters intimately after memorizing each character's routes and remembering how they respond to different kinds of coaxing. This predictability <b>felt</b> <b>great,</b> the TouchArcade reviewer wrote, when he could instinctively respond to new combinations of targets, but as a trade-off, the game mechanics quickly became repetitive. The Gamezebo reviewer felt otherwise, and commended how the game's setting, despite its consistency, remained fresh and exciting as new targets and complications were added. Pocket Gamer reviewer found the game's alternative methods for killing targets through [...] "traps and tricks" [...] to be the game's most interesting element.|$|E
500|$|Rob Bowman used {{a couple}} of {{specific}} camera techniques for the scenes on board the Stargazer during Picard's hallucinations. A steadicam attached to a cameraman was used to show a slight unsteadiness, {{and each of the}} Stargazer crew members were filmed individually on the bridge against a smoke background before being superimposed together. He explained, [...] "we went dark in a lot of scenes and we did different angles and things the show hadn't done yet. For me, it was a real creative stretch and it <b>felt</b> <b>great</b> for the show." [...] The bridge itself was a re-dress of the film-era Klingon Bird of Prey bridge. The term [...] "Picard Maneuver" [...] was later used offscreen to refer informally to Patrick Stewart's habit of tugging his uniform shirt down, and the Battle of Maxia itself was described in the first chapter of the pre-TNG era novel The Buried Age.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Jean-Baptiste Mondino, who worked with Madonna in her videos for [...] "Open Your Heart", [...] "Justify My Love" [...] and [...] "Human Nature", and shot on March 4, 1996, at the Confitería El Molino in Buenos Aires, Argentina, during her day off from filming Evita. Maria Gallagher was the producer, with Jean-Yves Escoffier serving as director of photography. It was a Bandits Production. In her Evita diaries, published by Vanity Fair magazine in 1996, Madonna made reference to the video shoot. In her writings, she specifically mentioned forgetting the lyrics of the song, suggesting she was having an identity crisis of sorts, trying to juggle her own identity with that of her role of Eva Perón in Evita. Madonna {{was also in the}} early stages of her pregnancy with daughter Lourdes while making the video. Hence, she <b>felt</b> <b>great</b> stress while shooting it, which led her to forget the lyrics. She said, ...|$|E
500|$|HAL Laboratory {{developed}} Super Smash Bros. Melee, with Masahiro Sakurai as {{the head}} of production. The game {{was one of the first}} games released on the GameCube and highlighted the advancement in graphics from the Nintendo 64. The developers wanted to pay homage to the debut of the GameCube by making an opening FMV sequence that would attract people's attention to the graphics. HAL worked with three separate graphic houses in Tokyo to make the opening sequence. On their official website, the developers posted screen shots and information highlighting and explaining the attention to physics and detail in the game, with references to changes from its predecessor. The game was in development for 13 months, and Sakurai called his lifestyle during this period [...] "destructive" [...] with no holidays and short weekends. Unlike the experimental first Super Smash Bros., he <b>felt</b> <b>great</b> pressure to deliver a quality sequel, claiming it was the [...] "biggest project I had ever led up to that point". Despite the painful development cycle, Sakurai proudly called it [...] "the sharpest game in the series... it just felt really good to play", even compared to its successor, Super Smash Bros. Brawl.|$|E
500|$|In the {{preliminary}} {{round of the}} 200-meter butterfly, Tarwater turned in the fastest time, acknowledging that nerves {{played a role in}} his fast swim. In the semi-finals, he achieved a new personal best of 1:54.72 and finished with the second-fastest time, just seven-tenths of a second slower than Phelps. [...] "It <b>felt</b> <b>great,</b> but there's still no celebrating for me," [...] he said about the swim. In the finals, Tarwater was exactly tied with Phelps and on world-record pace through the first 50 meters. He stayed near Phelps for 150 meters before fading on the last 50. In the last 25 meters, he was passed by Gil Stovall, who beat his personal best by a second and a half, to finish third. Tarwater also swam a new personal best – 1:54.46 – but it was not good enough to make the Olympic team, missing out by six-tenths of a second. After the race, he briefly considered retiring before deciding to finish the meet. [...] "I don't know what the future is going to bring, but I didn't want to go out knowing I didn't get back up," [...] he said. He finished eighth in the 100-meter butterfly; earlier, he failed to make the finals in the freestyle events.|$|E

500|$|Ernest's {{support of}} the Prussians in the Austro-Prussian War and later Franco Prussian War meant {{he was no longer}} the {{potential}} leader of a political movement; although it was true that {{he had been able to}} retain his duchies, it had come at a price. According to historian Charlotte Zeepvat, Ernest [...] "was increasingly lost in a whirl of private amusements which earned only contempt from outside". Ernest funneled his political thoughts into the private sphere, preferring to write covertly sponsored articles in the Coburg press that became increasingly embittered against England. In 1886, Ernest published Co-Regents and Foreign Influence in Germany, a pamphlet that greatly angered his family; though produced anonymously, no one doubted that it was written by Ernest. It attacked Vicky as a disloyal German that was too dependent on her mother, and declared that she had been too indiscreet in passing along confidential information during both war and peacetime. Queen Victoria was furious, writing to Vicky, [...] "What you told me of Uncle E and that pamphlet is simply monstrous. I assure you that I <b>felt</b> <b>great</b> difficulty in writing to him for his birthday, but I wrote it as short and cool as I could consistently with civility". [...] "Dear Uncle Ernest does us all a great deal of harm by his odd ways and uncontrollable tongue with his very lively imagination".|$|E
500|$|Lamb {{visited his}} {{aunt and uncle}} in Windsor on leave in May 1975, [...] "proudly wearing his uniform", {{journalist}} Tony Wanless writes. Turned out in the RLI's tartan green ceremonial dress and green beret, he was conspicuous walking along Ouellette Avenue, one of the city's main thoroughfares. Coincidentally, a funeral procession was being held for Edith Chaykoski's grandmother along that very street at the same time, leading Edith's younger brother Richard to spot Lamb on the pavement. The soldier remained oblivious, but his presence horrified the Chaykoski family. [...] "He had the uniform and looked a little different," [...] Richard told the Windsor Star a year later, [...] "but I never forgot his face." [...] Chaykoski's mother was so upset by the incident that for some time afterwards she refused {{to leave the house}} alone. While staying with the Hesketh family, Lamb went to see Barker and told him that serving in the Rhodesian security forces had enriched him personally and made him respect himself for the first time. Because of this he wished to forget about his previous life in Canada; in particular he said he [...] "didn't want it associated with his adopted country". He expressed his concern that if he were killed or captured, the Canadian press might reveal his prior history and embarrass the Rhodesian Army, the Canadian government and the Penetanguishene mental hospital. However, he said, he <b>felt</b> <b>great</b> loyalty towards Rhodesia and would still go back to continue his service.|$|E
500|$|Now {{wanting a}} [...] "bigger and stronger-looking" [...] Jason, {{one that was}} also [...] "more {{athletic}} and powerful", Steve Miner hired former British trapeze artist Richard Brooker. After a simple conversation, Miner decided he was the right person for the job. Being new to the country, Brooker believed that [...] "playing a psychopathic killer" [...] {{was the best way}} into the movie business. Brooker became the first actor to wear Jason's now-signature hockey mask. According to Brooker, [...] "It <b>felt</b> <b>great</b> with the mask on. It just felt like I really was Jason because I didn't have anything to wear before that." [...] For The Final Chapter, Joseph Zito brought his own spin to the character, one that required a [...] "real hardcore stuntman"; Ted White was hired to perform the role. White, who only took the job for the money, did [...] "get into the Jason psychology" [...] when he arrived on the set. White {{went so far as to}} not speak to any of the other actors for long stretches. As filming continued, White's experience was not pleasant, and in one instance, he went to battle for co-star Judie Aronson, who played Samantha, when the director kept her naked in the lake for extended periods of time. Displeased with his experience from filming, White had his name removed from the credits. As with Friday the 13th Part 2, there was confusion over who performed the role in A New Beginning, partly because Jason is not the literal antagonist in the film. When Ted White turned down the opportunity to return, Dick Wieand was cast. Wieand is credited as Roy Burns, the film's actual murderer, but it was stuntman Tom Morga who performed in the few flashes of Jason, as well as portraying Roy in almost all of the masked scenes. Wieand has been outspoken about his lack of enthusiasm over his role in the film. Feeling alienated during the shoot, Wieand spent most of his time in his trailer. By comparison, Morga enjoyed his time as Jason and made sure he [...] "really got into the character".|$|E

The buses featured a single front entrance and exit door and room for four standing passengers. They eased initial recruitment concerns because drivers {{did not have to}} hold a full PSV licence to drive them.
