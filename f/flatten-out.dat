50|$|The vehicle started encountering more {{significant}} air density {{in the lower}} thermosphere at about 400000 ft, at around Mach 25, 8200 m/s. The vehicle was controlled {{by a combination of}} RCS thrusters and control surfaces, to fly at a 40-degree nose-up attitude, producing high drag, not only to slow it down to landing speed, but also to reduce reentry heating. As the vehicle encountered progressively denser air, it began a gradual transition from spacecraft to aircraft. In a straight line, its 40-degree nose-up attitude would cause the descent angle to <b>flatten-out,</b> or even rise. The vehicle therefore performed a series of four steep S-shaped banking turns, each lasting several minutes, at up to 70 degrees of bank, while still maintaining the 40-degree angle of attack. In this way it dissipated speed sideways rather than upwards. This occurred during the 'hottest' phase of re-entry, when the heat-shield glowed red and the G-forces were at their highest. By {{the end of the last}} turn, the transition to aircraft was almost complete. The vehicle leveled its wings, lowered its nose into a shallow dive and began its approach to the landing site.|$|E
30|$|The two {{hydraulic}} actuators were precisely controlled in force or displacement modes by a servo-controlled system. Actuators B and C were initially used to apply shear {{force on the}} beam in force control mode {{at a rate of}} 22 kN/min (5 kips/min). During a test, the shear load–displacement curve for a beam was continuously monitored visually on a display screen. When the slope of this load–displacement curve started to decreasing (<b>flatten-out),</b> the control mode of the actuators was switched to displacement control with a rate of 5  mm/h (0.2 in./h). This displacement control mode was maintained until the failure occurred {{at either end of the}} beam. The displacement control feature was essential in capturing the ductility/brittleness behavior of the beam as it failed in shear.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} one of the {{branches}} of soft matter: biological systems. More specifically, we study the morphological transformation of lipid bilayer membranes induced by interacting with macromolecules. Recent progress of the topic is reviewed, and {{there are two types of}} systems studied in the thesis; macromolecules can either passively or actively interact with membranes. In the first part, the Monte Carlo simulation is used to study the structural properties of the system consisting of a self-avoiding polymer chain confined between a fluid membrane and a flat hard surface. There are no attraction or repulsion between the polymer and the membrane, and the membrane is adhesive to the flat surface or is pressed against the surface due to a pressure difference. As the adhesion between the soft membrane and the surface increases, the polymer is subject to a strong confinement; the state containing a pancake-shaped polymer conformation eventually yields to a bud state through an abrupt, discontinuous structural transition. We explore the scaling behavior of the physical properties of the system as functions of the polymer's size, the membrane's surface tension, and the adhesion energy. As for the pressure difference case, we show that it has a discontinuous structural phase transition. Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the system undergoes a transition from a confined (bump) state to a strongly confined (<b>flatten-out)</b> state as the pressure increases. A scaling argument is also made to understand the physical mechanism behind the phase transition and the properties of each state. In the second part, to understand how the nanoparticle adhesion strength and the deformation capability induce different protruding membrane structures, a model based on grand canonical ensemble and its solution are presented. With free energy minimization, we demonstrate that multiple nanoparticles with certain range of the adhesion strength and the deformation capability are able to induce stably not only tubes and buds but also pearls, and the structure diagrams of these shapes were computed. The results suggest that the pearling structure results from a balance between the adhesion strength, the deformation capability and the reduced volume of the vesicle. We also find a structural transformation that a tubular structure changes abruptly into a pearling structure...|$|E
40|$|Photograph of {{a view of}} Mariposa Street and the {{business}} district in Fresno, shown from Court House Park, ca. 1915. The image, shot from the court house dome, shows two small palms arranged on a thoroughfare through the park, lined by a mass of trees to either side. Farther back, across the street, pedestrians, horse-drawn carriages and a street car can be seen along Mariposa Street, which is flanked by two- to four-story commercial buildings to either side. In the distance, the city <b>flattens-out</b> into a clearing peppered with the occasional tree.; Legible signs {{from left to right}} include: "[ [...] . ]er Furniture Co. ", "Ioward Furniture Co.
