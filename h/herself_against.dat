5|$|After {{graduating from}} college in Detroit, Mansour entered {{religious}} orders then earned {{a doctorate in}} biochemistry. She served {{as the president of}} Mercy College of Detroit from 1971 to 1983. She ran unsuccessfully for public office in 1982, in the process provoking comment from the Archbishop of Detroit. The Governor of Michigan appointed her to lead the state's social services department, and she was confirmed in early 1983. During this time, the Archbishop of Detroit and Vatican officials asked Mansour declare <b>herself</b> <b>against</b> abortion—her department was responsible for abortion services funded through Medicaid. Mansour refused to make such a statement, and two months after her confirmation as director she was required by the Vatican to decide whether she was to continue as director or as a nun. She chose to give up her vows as a nun. After serving out her appointment she was inducted into the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame in 1988.|$|E
5|$|The earth may be personified as {{the goddess}} Bhudevi in Indian sculpture. Bhudevi is often shown {{as a small}} figure in the icon. She may be seated on or {{dangling}} from one of Varaha's tusks, or is seated {{on the corner of}} his folded elbow or his shoulder and supports <b>herself</b> <b>against</b> the tusk or the snout, as being lifted from the waters. In later Indian paintings, the whole earth or a part of it is depicted lifted up by Varaha's tusks. In Mahabalipuram, a rare portrayal shows an affectionate Varaha looking down to Bhudevi, who he carries in his arms. The earth may be portrayed as a globe, a flat stretch of mountainous land or an elaborate forest landscape with buildings, temples, humans, birds and animals. The defeated demon may be depicted trampled under Varaha's feet or being killed in combat by Varaha's gada. Nagas (snake gods) and their consorts Naginis (snake goddesses), residents of the underworld, may be depicted as swimming in the ocean with hands folded as a mark of devotion. Varaha may be also depicted standing on a snake or other minor creatures, denoting the cosmic waters.|$|E
5|$|Sawicka's {{time at the}} Lucan {{household}} ended late in March 1973. While {{with two}} of the children near Grosvenor Place, she was confronted by Lucan and two private detectives. They told her that the children had been made wards of court and that she must release them into his custody, which she did. Frances was collected from school later in the day. Lady Lucan applied to the court to have the children returned, but concerned about the case's complexity, the judge set a date for the hearing three months ahead, for June 1973. To defend <b>herself</b> <b>against</b> Lucan's claims about her mental state, Veronica booked herself a four-day stay at the Priory Clinic in Roehampton. While it was acknowledged that she still required some psychiatric support, the doctors reported that there was no indication that she was mentally ill. Lucan's case depended upon Veronica being unable to care for the children, but at the hearing, he was instead forced to defend his own behaviour toward her. After several weeks of witnesses and protracted arguments in camera, on the advice of his lawyers he conceded the case. Unimpressed by Lucan's character, Mr Justice Rees awarded custody to Veronica. The earl was allowed access every other weekend.|$|E

5|$|The {{leader of}} the Fireflies, Marlene (Merle Dandridge), {{promises}} to double their cache in return for smuggling a teenage girl, Ellie (Ashley Johnson), to Fireflies hiding in the Massachusetts State House outside the quarantine zone. Joel, Tess, and Ellie sneak out in the night, but after an encounter with a patrol, they discover Ellie is infected. Full infection normally occurs in under two days, but Ellie claims she was infected three weeks ago and that her immunity {{may lead to a}} cure. The trio make their way to their destination through hordes of the infected, but find that the Fireflies there have been killed. Tess reveals she has been bitten by an infected; believing in Ellie's importance, Tess sacrifices <b>herself</b> <b>against</b> pursuing soldiers so Joel and Ellie can escape. Joel decides to find Tommy, a former Firefly, in the hope that he can locate the remaining Fireflies. With the help of Bill (W. Earl Brown), a smuggler who owes Joel a favor, they acquire a working vehicle. Driving into Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Joel and Ellie are ambushed by bandits and their car is wrecked. They ally with two brothers, Henry (Brandon Scott) and Sam (Nadji Jeter); after they escape the city, Sam is bitten by an infected, but hides it from the group. As his infection takes hold, Sam attacks Ellie, but Henry shoots him dead and commits suicide out of grief.|$|E
5|$|The {{views of}} Whitehall were not echoed by the naval commanders, {{especially}} Sir Varyl Begg, Commander-in-Chief of British {{forces in the}} region, who believed that the carrier {{was too weak to}} defend <b>herself</b> <b>against</b> Indonesian attack or strike in turn against them. Begg adjudged that the narrowness of the Strait combined with local geographical features restricted the ships' movement and negated their radar, while custom prevented the carrier from flying its aircraft or even carrying them on deck, rendering it and the escorts extremely vulnerable in case of attack. He offered instead to send the destroyers, which were far more expendable pieces than a fleet carrier. His views were supported by the High Commissioner to Malaysia, Lord Antony Head, who argued that there would be very little gain for Indonesia and loss for Britain if the carrier was not risked. Luce, however, remained adamant that the Victorious must sail through herself, but in order to assuage Begg's fears assured him that the more modern carrier HMS Centaur would be on hand to provide air cover for the task force. Reinforcements were also rushed to Singapore to meet any Indonesian provocation. Thorneycroft ordered Begg to begin planning for the forced passage of the Strait, as officials determined on 3–4 September that the carrier must not be diverted.|$|E
25|$|As Chief of the Imperial General Staff, Gort {{advocated}} {{the primacy of}} building a land army and defending France and the Low Countries over Imperial defence after France had said {{she would not be}} able on her own to defend <b>herself</b> <b>against</b> a German attack.|$|E

25|$|Another legend also {{states that}} Rashi's parents moved to Worms, Germany while Rashi's mother was pregnant. As {{she walked down}} one of the narrow streets in the Jewish quarter, she was imperiled by two {{oncoming}} carriages.

25|$|Indenture, {{otherwise}} known as bonded labour or debt bondage, {{is a form of}} unfree labour under which a person pledges himself or <b>herself</b> <b>against</b> a loan. The services required to repay the debt, and their duration, may be undefined. Debt bondage can be passed on from generation to generation, with children required to pay off their progenitors' debt. It is the most widespread form of slavery today. Debt bondage is most prevalent in South Asia.|$|E
25|$|Workplace {{bullying}} overlaps to {{some degree}} with workplace incivility but tends to encompass more intense and typically repeated acts of disregard and rudeness. Negative spirals of increasing incivility between organizational members can result in bullying, but isolated acts of incivility are not conceptually bullying despite the apparent similarity in their form and content. In case of bullying, the intent of harm is less ambiguous, an unequal balance of power (both formal and informal) is more salient, and the target of bullying feels threatened, vulnerable and unable to defend himself or <b>herself</b> <b>against</b> negative recurring actions.|$|E

25|$|HMS Weymouth was a 44-gun fifth {{rate of the}} Royal Navy. She was {{previously}} the country ship, i.e., India-built, merchantman Wellesley, built in Calcutta in 1796. She successfully defended <b>herself</b> <b>against</b> a French frigate, and made two voyages to Britain as an East Indiaman for the East India Company. The Admiralty purchased her in May 1804; she then became a storeship in 1806. On her last voyage for the Royal Navy, in 1820, she carried settlers to South Africa. She was then laid up in ordinary. In 1828 she was converted to a prison ship and sailed to Bermuda where she served as a prison hulk until 1865 when she was sold for breaking up.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Noten participated among 40 (21 in final) Dutch {{artists and}} {{designers}} in a tiara design competition honouring the marriage between Maxima Zorreguieta and the Dutch crown prince Willem-Alexander. Noten's {{design of a}} shiny chromed polo helmet with a clip-on tiara won first prize. The jury {{referred to it as}} a 'cheeky' design. Noten intended the tiara, with small portraits of all Dutch queens positioned as guardian angels on top, to be used in church during the wedding ceremony. Afterwards the princess could combine the tiara with the helmet to protect <b>herself</b> <b>against</b> paparazzi when she ventured into the city of Amsterdam (or if she felt confident enough her husband might want to wear the helmet).|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Socialist Revolutionary {{leaders in}} exile, {{many of them}} living in Switzerland, had been the glum spectators of the {{collapse}} of international socialist solidarity. French and German Social Democrats had voted in favour of their respective governments' war efforts. Georgi Plekhanov in Paris had adopted a violently anti-German stand, while Parvus supported the German war effort as the best means of ensuring a revolution in Russia. The Mensheviks largely maintained that Russia had the right to defend <b>herself</b> <b>against</b> Germany, although Martov (a prominent Menshevik), now on the left of his group, demanded an end to the war and a settlement on the basis of national self-determination, with no annexations or indemnities.|$|E

25|$|Years later, in {{the process}} of finding a bride for his half-brother, the young king Vichitravirya, Bhishma {{abducted}} princesses Amba, Ambika and Ambalika of Kashi (Varanasi) from the assemblage of suitors at their swayamvara. Salwa, the ruler of Saubala, and Amba (the eldest princess) were in love; Salwa attempted to stop the abduction but was soundly beaten. Upon reaching Hastinapura, Amba confided in Bhishma that she wished to wed Salwa. Bhishma then sent her back to Salwa, who, bitter from his humiliating defeat at Bhishma's hands, turned her down. Disgraced, Amba approached Bhishma for marriage. He refused her, citing his oath. Enraged beyond measure, Amba vowed to avenge <b>herself</b> <b>against</b> Bhishma even if it meant being reborn over and over again.|$|E
25|$|Born on 31 March 1360, Philippa was {{the oldest}} child of John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster and Blanche of Lancaster. Philippa spent her infancy moving around the various {{properties}} owned by her family {{with her mother and}} her wet-nurse, Maud. Here, she was raised and educated alongside her two younger siblings, Elizabeth, who was three years younger, and Henry, six years younger, who would later become King Henry IV. Philippa's mother died of plague in 1369. Her father remarried in 1371 to Infanta Constance of Castile, daughter of King Peter of Castile and on Constance's death in 1394, he married his former mistress, Katherine Swynford, who had been Philippa's governess. The affair and eventual marriage was considered scandalous, and in the future Philippa would protect <b>herself</b> <b>against</b> such embarrassment.|$|E
25|$|After {{an urgency}} {{motion of the}} Bavarian SPD party in the Bavarian Parliament, the Minister of Justice Beate Merk (CSU party) defended herself {{in a speech in}} front of the Parliament on 15 December 2011 against the {{impression}} Mollath had been hospitalized due to his criminal complaint. The following day she was explaining through a spokesman, that the accommodation Mollaths in psychiatry was a consequence of his crimes and {{had nothing to do with}} his wife or his lawsuit against the bank. She said, Mollath harmed his wife with strangulation marks on the neck, large hematoma and a bleeding bite wound. He also stabbed dozens of car tires, including those on vehicles of the wife's lawyers. His accommodation was confirmed by the Federal court and is observed regularly. She defended <b>herself</b> <b>against</b> the allegations that the state prosecution had failed to act because of instructions from leading politicians. Thereupon, the state prosecutor himself directed some questions towards the HypoVereinsbank.|$|E
