Main body This paper, while reporting a brief review of <b>deflazacort</b> pharmacological properties, its efficacy and tolerability in different clinical areas, has been designed with the specific aim of providing a new dose-conversion table of corticosteroids, including for the first time also <b>deflazacort.</b> Short conclusion We suggest that this new conversion table could be a useful tool for physicians who need to select the appropriate dose of <b>deflazacort</b> in their clinical practice...|$|E
40|$|Conventional oral steroids like {{prednisolone}} have various {{adverse effects}} both during short-term and long-term use. Hence {{a search for}} an alternative oral steroid with fewer side-effects is underway throughout the world. <b>Deflazacort,</b> an oxazoline derivative, {{is a step in}} this direction. The number of large randomized trials using <b>deflazacort</b> for steroid-responsive disorders in children is limited. Use of <b>deflazacort</b> has been explored largely in patients with Duchenne&#x 2032;s muscular dystrophy. Preliminary data suggest reduced osteoporosis, lesser growth retardation and weight gain with use of <b>deflazacort,</b> as compared to other steriods.

40|$|The {{extent to}} which {{treatment}} with low doses of the nonfluorinated steroid methylprednisolone affects diaphragm contractility and morphology is unknown. In the present study, we compared the effects of equipotent doses of methylprednisolone and <b>deflazacort,</b> an oxazoline derivate of prednisolone with less systemic side-effects on bone structure and carbohydrate metabolism. Twenty six male adult rats were randomized to receive daily saline (control), methylprednisolone 0. 4 mg. kg- 1 or <b>deflazacort</b> 0. 5 mg. kg- 1 i. m. Contractile properties and histopathology were measured after a 6 week treatment period. During treatment, body weight increased in control and methylprednisolone-treated animals, but decreased by 4. 2 +/- 1. 1 % (mean +/- SD) in the <b>deflazacort</b> group. Similarly, diaphragm mass in the <b>deflazacort</b> group was decreased compared to control and methylprednisolone groups. Twitch tension and twitch characteristics of isolated diaphragm bundles were similar in the three groups. Maximal tetanic tension was decreased in the <b>deflazacort</b> group. The force-frequency curve of the <b>deflazacort</b> bundles shifted downwards compared to control. Fatigue occurring during this protocol was greatest in the methylprednisolone- and deflazacort-treated animals. Microscopic examination revealed no gross abnormalities in the three groups. Histochemical analysis after staining for myosin adenosine triphosphatase (ATP-ase) showed that in the <b>deflazacort</b> group cross-sectional area of type I, IIa and IIb fibres were decreased.

40|$|Duchenne muscular {{dystrophy}} (DMD) is a progressive and ultimately fatal skeletal muscle disease. Currently, {{the most effective}} therapy is the administration of a subclass of glucocorticoids, most notably <b>deflazacort.</b> Although <b>deflazacort</b> treatment can attenuate DMD progression, extend ambulation, and maintain muscle strength, the mechanism of its action remains unknown. Prior observations have shown that activation of a JNK 1 -mediated signal transduction cascade contributes to the progression of the DMD phenotype, in part by phosphorylation and inhibition of a calcineurin sensitive NF-ATc 1 transcription factor. Here, we observed that <b>deflazacort</b> treatment restored myocyte viability in muscle cells with constitutive activation of JNK 1 and in dystrophic mdx mice. However, <b>deflazacort</b> treatment did not alter JNK 1 activity itself, but rather led {{to an increase in}} the activity of the calcineurin phosphatase and an up-regulation of NF-ATc 1 -dependent gene expression. The prophylactic effect of <b>deflazacort</b> treatment was associated with increased expression of NF-ATc 1 target genes such as the dystrophin homologue utrophin. Moreover, the muscle sparing effects of <b>deflazacort</b> were completely abolished when used in conjunction with the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine. Collectively, these results show that <b>deflazacort</b> attenuates loss of dystrophic myofiber integrity by up-regulating the activity of the phosphatase calcineurin, which in turn negates JNK 1 inhibition of NF-ATc 1 -mediated phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion of NF-ATc 1.

40|$|Information on precise {{effects of}} <b>deflazacort</b> on bone cell function, {{especially}} osteoclasts, is quite limited. Therefore, {{the present study}} was undertaken to test effects of <b>deflazacort</b> on osteoclast-like cell formation in mouse bone marrow cultures and on the regulation of osteoprotegerin (OPG) and its ligand (RANKL) mRNA expressions by RT-PCR in the ST 2 marrow stromal cells. TRAP-positive mononuclear cells increased after the treatment of <b>deflazacort</b> at 10 - 9 to 10 - 7 M alone for 6 days in a dose-dependent manner. Number of TRAP-positive multinucleated cells (MNCs) increased significantly with combined treatment of <b>deflazacort</b> at 10 - 7 M and 1, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3 at 10 - 9 M compared to that of cultures treated with 1, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3 alone (p< 0. 05). Exposure to <b>deflazacort</b> at 10 - 7 M in the presence of 1, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3 at 10 - 9 M in the last 3 -day culture had greater stimulatory effect on osteoclast-like cell formation than that of the first 3 -day culture did. <b>Deflazacort</b> at 10 - 10 - 10 - 6 M downregulated OPG and upregulated RANKL in mRNA levels in a dose-dependent manner. These observations suggest that <b>deflazacort</b> stimulate osteoclast precursor in the absence of 1, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3 and enhance differentiation of osteoclasts in the presence of 1, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3.

This was an open, non-blinded, randomized clinical study of 35 children affected by drug-resistant epilepsies. The study lasted 12 months. Group 1 (16 patients) received hydrocortisone for 6 months; group 2 (19 patients) was treated with <b>deflazacort</b> for the entire study period.

40|$|Background: Duchenne muscular {{dystrophy}} (DMD) is a genetic disorder in males resulting in muscle weakness leading to loss of ambulation and progression {{to death by}} pulmonary and cardiac dysfunction. It has been documented both steroids <b>deflazacort</b> and prednisone delay muscle degeneration but not many studies outline {{the differences between the}} two including side effect profiles. <b>Deflazacort</b> is not yet available in the US. This systematic review compiles recent data to compare <b>deflazacort</b> to prednisone in the treatment of DMD boys. Method: A full search of medical literature using multiple databases, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Evidence Based Reviews Multifile and Web of Science, and reference lists was conducted with the key words {{muscular dystrophy}}, <b>deflazacort</b> and prednisone. Articles that consisted of the outcomes of muscle function, cardiac and pulmonary changes, side effect incidence and type, and gene expression in whole blood were included. The literature was assessed using the GRADE system to rate its quality and importance. Results: Four articles were selected for review. There were no significant differences between the two steroids in treating muscle functionality, prevention of cardiomyopathy or difference in pulmonary function. In Bonifati et al and Balaban et al, weight gain in prednisone-treated patients was greater than with <b>deflazacort.</b> With regards to gene expression, Lit et al discovered gene probes in the prednisone-treated patients which promote weight gain. On the other hand, <b>deflazacort</b> probes are suspected to prevent obesity. Conclusion: It is clear both steroids are efficacious in treating DMD but side effects will determine patient and providers’ choice of prescription.
