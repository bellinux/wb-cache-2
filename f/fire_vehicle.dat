At the Moscow International Motor Show, an experimental version (GAZ-43483) was shown containing a reinforced chassis (GVW 8.5 tons and double) and a cabin designed for long-distance transport, together with a chassis for prospective models of small buses.

50|$|All major nations {{developed}} {{self-propelled artillery}} {{that would be}} able to provide indirect support while keeping pace with advancing armoured formations. These were usually lightly armoured vehicles with an open-topped hull; the US M7 Priest, British Sexton (25 pdr) and German Wespe and Hummel being typical examples. A different route was chosen by the Soviets, who didn't develop a specialized indirect <b>fire</b> <b>vehicle,</b> but following a tradition of dual-purpose towed artillery, built a series of versatile assault guns with indirect fire capabilities (example ISU-152). A related and novel program was the development of the famous Soviet Katyusha self-propelled multiple rocket launchers, which were unarmored trucks with a simple rocket rack on the back, a cheap and crushingly effective weapon, provided area saturation was called for rather than accurate fire.|$|E
