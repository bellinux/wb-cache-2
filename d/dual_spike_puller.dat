The timeline of the fight seemingly flows out of order.

Xander, though disgusted by {{the purpose of the}} Buffybot, expresses a sort of sympathy for Spike, having seen the extent of his injuries when he (Xander) and Giles brought him back to his crypt, during which they were unable to discover whether or not Spike sold Dawn out. While Spike, beaten and bloody, rests, Buffy enters the crypt pretending to be the Buffybot. When Spike explains Glory wanted to know who the Key was, Buffy, mimicking the Buffybot's directness, offers to tell her, but Spike, upset, warns her that no one must know. Spike says if anything happened to Dawn, it would destroy the real Buffy, and he would rather die than let that happen.

25|$|Hitman: Absolution is a stealth {{video game}} in which the player assumes {{the role of a}} hitman named Agent 47. Presented from a third-person perspective, the {{gameplay}} centers around completing set objectives within a series of levels. Objectives can range from simply reaching the end of the level, to killing specific individuals. Players choose how to complete each level, taking branching paths to get to a target or location. Players may use pistols, bottles or bricks, assault rifles, shotguns, fiber-wire, or steel pipe against enemies if opting for the action-oriented approach, or avoid enemies altogether, not being seen, using disguises, blending into the environment, and only attacking the set target(s), if using the stealth-oriented approach. Agent 47 also has the 'Instinct' ability that lets the player monitor enemies more easily. There are also environmental ways to kill or distract individuals; players can use poison to <b>spike</b> coffee, <b>pull</b> switches to make a disco ball fall and break, cause a massive explosion at a gas station, pull a switch to cause scaffolding to fall down, cause fires, or set off fireworks. Players complete chapters in order to progress through the story.

Ronan states that due to his seeming immunity to pain, he is not Kree, he is something else, like a wraith. This amuses the son of Sim-Del, and he decides that Wraith is a suitable new name for himself. He then divulges his origins and indicates that he pities Ronan because he is a slave.

40|$|Forced {{detachment}} {{of a single}} polymer chain, strongly-adsorbed on a solid substrate, is investigated by two complementary methods: a coarse-grained analytical dynamical model, based on the Onsager stochastic equation, and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations with Langevin thermostat. The suggested approach {{makes it possible to}} go beyond the limitations of the conventional Bell-Evans model. We observe a series of characteristic force <b>spikes</b> when the <b>pulling</b> force is measured against the cantilever displacement during detachment at constant velocity v_c (displacement control mode) and find that the average magnitude of this force increases as v_c grows. The probability distributions of the pulling force and the end-monomer distance from the surface at the moment of final detachment are investigated for different adsorption energy ϵ and pulling velocity v_c. Our extensive MD-simulations validate and support the main theoretical findings. Moreover, the simulation reveals a novel behavior: for a strong-friction and massive cantilever the force spikes pattern is smeared out at large v_c. As a challenging task for experimental bio-polymers sequencing in future we suggest the fabrication of stiff, super-light, nanometer-sized AFM probe. Comment: 20 pages, 14 figures, Late...|$|R
40|$|A {{prominent}} {{feature of}} signaling in cortical neurons {{is that of}} randomness in the action potential. The output of a typical pyramidal cell can be well fit with a Poisson model, and variations in the Poisson rate repeatedly {{have been shown to}} be correlated with stimuli. However while the rate provides a very useful characterization of neural spike data, it may not be the most fundamental description of the signaling code. Recent data showing g frequency range multi-cell action potential correlations, together with spike timing dependent plasticity, are spurring a re-examination of the classical model, since precise timing codes imply that the generation of spikes is essentially deterministic. Could the observed Poisson randomness and timing determinism reflect two separate modes of communication, or do they somehow derive from a single process? We investigate in a timing-based model whether the apparent incompatibility between these probabilistic and deterministic observations may be resolved by examining how spikes could be used in the underlying neural circuits. The crucial component of this model draws on <b>dual</b> roles for <b>spike</b> signaling. In learning receptive fields from ensembles of inputs, spikes need to behave probabilistically, whereas for fast signaling of individual stimuli, the spikes need to behave deterministically.

40|$|The Chemcatcher passive sampler, {{which uses}} Empore (TM) disks as {{sampling}} phase, is frequently {{used to monitor}} polar organic chemicals in river water and effluents. Uptake kinetics need to be quantified to calculate time-weighted average concentrations from Chemcatcher field deployments. Information on release kinetics is needed if performance reference compounds (PRCs) are used to quantify the influence of environmental conditions on the uptake. In a series of uptake and elimination experiments, we used Empore (TM) SDB disks (poly(styrenedivinylbenzene) copolymer modified with sulfonic acid groups) as a sampling phase and 22 compounds with a logK (ow) (octanol-water partitioning coefficient) range from - 2. 6 to 3. 8. Uptake experiments were conducted in river water or tap water and lasted up to 25 days. Only 1 of 22 compounds (sulfamethoxazole) approached equilibrium in the uptake trials. Other compounds showed continuing non-linear uptake, even after 25 days. All compounds could be released from SDB disks, and desorption was proportionally higher in disks loaded for shorter periods. Desorption showed two-phase characteristics, and desorption was proportionally higher for passively sorbed compounds compared to actively loaded compounds (active loading was performed by <b>pulling</b> <b>spiked</b> river water over SDB disks using vacuum). We hypothesise that the two-phase kinetics and better retention of actively loaded compounds-and compounds loaded for a longer period-may be caused by slow diffusion of chemicals within the polymer. As sorption and desorption did not show isotropic kinetics, {{it is not possible}} to develop robust PRCs for adsorbent material like SDB disks...|$|R
