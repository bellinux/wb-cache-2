5|$|As noted above, {{variants}} that {{deviate from}} this template are known; what designates a Nazarov cyclization {{in particular is}} the generation of the pentadienyl cation followed by electrocyclic ring closure to an oxyallyl cation. In order to achieve this transformation, the molecule {{must be in the}} s-trans/s-trans conformation, placing the vinyl groups in an appropriate orientation. The propensity of the system to <b>enter</b> <b>this</b> conformation dramatically influences reaction rate, with α-substituted substrates having an increased population of the requisite conformer due to allylic strain. Coordination of an electron donating α-substituent by the catalyst can likewise increase the reaction rate by enforcing this conformation.|$|E
5|$|In 1751, Caroline's {{daughter}} Princess Amelia became ranger of Richmond Park {{after the}} death of Robert Walpole. Immediately afterwards, the Princess caused major public uproar by closing the park to the public, only allowing few close friends and those with special permits to <b>enter.</b> <b>This</b> continued until 1758, when a local brewer, John Lewis, took the gatekeeper, who stopped him from entering the park, to court. The court ruled in favour of Lewis, citing the fact that, when Charles I enclosed the park in the 17th century, he allowed the public right of way in the park. Princess Amelia was forced to lift the restrictions.|$|E

25|$|Although {{ubiquitous}} in typeset material, the typographic apostrophe (’) is rather difficult to enter on a computer, since {{it does not}} have its own key on a standard keyboard. Outside the world of professional typesetting and graphic design, many people {{do not know how to}} <b>enter</b> <b>this</b> character and instead use the typewriter apostrophe ('). The typewriter apostrophe has always been considered tolerable on Web pages because of the egalitarian nature of Web publishing, the low resolution of computer monitors in comparison to print, and legacy limitations provided by ASCII.|$|E

25|$|Chronic aortic {{insufficiency}} If the individual survives the initial hemodynamic derailment that acute AI presents as, the left ventricle adapts by eccentric hypertrophy and dilatation {{of the left}} ventricle, and the volume overload is compensated for. The left ventricular filling pressures will revert to normal and the individual will no longer have overt heart failure. In this compensated phase, the individual may be totally asymptomatic and may have normal exercise tolerance. Eventually (typically after a latency period) the left ventricle will become decompensated, and filling pressures will increase.Some individuals <b>enter</b> <b>this</b> decompensated phase asymptomatically, treatment for AI involves aortic valve replacement prior to this decompensation phase.|$|E
25|$|The {{space within}} a Sumbanese house {{is divided into}} three: the upper space, the middle space, and the lower space. The upper space (roughly the high-pitched peak roof area) is where sacred {{heirlooms}} are stored. This upper space is where the marapu resides. Food offerings and other rituals addressed to the ancestors are held in the upper space. Only older men are permitted to <b>enter</b> <b>this</b> otherwise empty part of the building, and even this is a rare occasion. The middle space of a Sumbanese house is where mundane activity is held, while the lower space (the space below the house) is where livestock, such as chicken and pig, are kept.|$|E
25|$|Negative-sense vRNAs {{that form}} the genomes of future viruses, RNA-dependent RNA transcriptase, and other viral {{proteins}} are assembled into a virion. Hemagglutinin and neuraminidase molecules cluster into a bulge in the cell membrane. The vRNA and viral core proteins leave the nucleus and <b>enter</b> <b>this</b> membrane protrusion (step 6). The mature virus buds off from the cell in a sphere of host phospholipid membrane, acquiring hemagglutinin and neuraminidase with this membrane coat (step 7). As before, the viruses adhere to the cell through hemagglutinin; the mature viruses detach once their neuraminidase has cleaved sialic acid residues from the host cell. After the release of new influenza virus, the host cell dies.|$|E

25|$|The {{top floor}} of the monastery houses the Lamokhang temple, which is a {{repository}} of numerous volumes of scriptures including Kangyur and Stangyur. Only men are allowed to <b>enter</b> <b>this</b> floor. There are big stupas and mani walls at the entry to the monastery. A small room above the temple is exclusively used as a school room to teach local boys of the villages and some of these boys are chosen as Lamas. The top floor is also the official residence of the incarnate lama of the monastery. A large pillar engraved with the Buddha's teachings is also located here. The monastery complex has a number of white washed huts, which house the Lamas.|$|E
25|$|The central {{portion of}} the pitch (5 feet from each popping crease, and 1 foot {{either side of the}} line joining the centres of the two middle stumps) is {{designated}} a protected area (this is the area the ball will most often bounce in). The bowlers from the fielding side should not <b>enter</b> <b>this</b> area during the follow-through of their bowling action, nor should the batsman take guard within it or so close that they would frequently move into it. A bowler will get two warnings should they run into the protected area; should they encroach again, they will be suspended from bowling {{for the remainder of the}} innings. A batsman gets one warning and on subsequent transgressions incurs a 5 run penalty.|$|E
25|$|Hell realm: {{beings in}} hell (naraka) <b>enter</b> <b>this</b> realm for evil karma such as theft, lying, {{adultery}} and others. The texts {{vary in their}} details, but typically describe numerous hellish regions each with different forms of intense suffering, such as eight extremely hot hellish realms, eight extremely cold, being partially eaten alive, beating {{and other forms of}} torture in proportion to the evil karma accumulated. These beings are reborn in another realm after their evil karma has run its course, they die, and they get another chance. This realm is not similar to afterlife hell in Christianity, states Damien Keown, because in Buddhism there is no realm of final damnation and existence in this realm is also a temporary state.|$|E
