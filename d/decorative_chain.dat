Above the storefront level sits a panel of soldier course bricks, with decorative terra cotta floral blocks on the corners. The same blocks are used on the top corners of the surrounds for five windows above. The frieze is terra cotta, with a series of narrow flutes above a <b>decorative</b> bed-mould <b>chain.</b> The cornice features a geometric X-pattern with small dentils on each block.

50|$|They {{were the}} most common type of watch from their {{development}} in the 16th century until wristwatches became popular after World War I during which a transitional design, trench watches, were used by the military. Pocket watches generally have an attached chain to allow them to be secured to a waistcoat, lapel, or belt loop, and to prevent them from being dropped. Watches were also mounted on a short leather strap or fob, when a long chain would have been cumbersome or likely to catch on things. This fob could also provide a protective flap over their face and crystal. Women's watches were normally of this form, with a watch fob that was more <b>decorative</b> than protective. <b>Chains</b> were frequently decorated with a silver or enamel pendant, often carrying the arms of some club or society, which by association also became known as a fob. Ostensibly practical gadgets such as a watch winding key, vesta case, or a cigar cutter also appeared on watch chains, although usually in an overly decorated style. Also common are fasteners designed to be put through a buttonhole and worn in a jacket or waistcoat, this sort being frequently associated with and named after train conductors.|$|R
40|$|PT PDMA suffers sales decline {{which is}} caused by the {{increase}} in competition and decorative plantation import. The objective of this research are to describe the sales of PT PDMA, analyze <b>decorative</b> plantation value <b>chain</b> in PT PDMA and identify the strategic factors which define PT PDMA’s competitiveness. Analysis tools that being used are Value Chain Analysis, Porter Diamond, Internal Factor Matrix, External Factor Matrix, IE Matrix and Quantitative Strategic Planning Matrix (QSPM). Value Chain Matrix and Diamond Porter are used to define external and internal factors of PT PDMA which in turn will be analyzed by using Internal Factor Evaluation (IFE) and External Factor Evaluation (EFE) to score it. Scores later will be used to achieve strategies by using Internal External Matrix (IE Matrix). Priority strategies will be defined from QSPM Analysis. Fluctuation in sales of PT PDMA is caused by several factors. Highest sales number on October to December is affected by increase in wedding and religious parties. Internal factors which caused decline in sales are production and marketing. Value Chain Analysis and Porter Diamond reveal that PT PDMA strengths in flowers and leaves have better qualities and lower price than competitors. The weakness is in the possibility of crop failures. External factor which becomes an opportunity is in the increase of hotels and the global markets, but the main threat remains the climate change. The strategies that are selected by using IE Matrix and QSPM Analysis are first to increase market segmentation by using online media and personal selling. Second, is to market the products abroad by studying export procedures. Third, is to build green house to minimize the threat of crop failures...|$|R
