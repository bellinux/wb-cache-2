The European Land Registry Association (ELRA) will work closely with other associations and networks working in this area. It will use the resources of ELRA’s European Land Registry Network(ELRN) and build on the experience gained from EULIS’s Project LINE (a project which aims to facilitate compliance {{with the requirements of}} the <b>e-Justice</b> programme in the area of land registration).The objective is to increase the accessibility and transparency of land registry information and to facilitate the registration of cross-border documents. Varied legislation and practices of Land Registries hamper the exchange of information between them and the registration of cross border documents. Any standard model has to take into account fundamental differences in national organisation. However, common points offer the possibility of defining a structure of key information shared by the majority of Land Registry systems.|$|E

[...] The European Union also offers two other cyberjustice services, namely e-CODEX, which simplifies cross-border litigations by providing access to electronic delivery services, electronic signatures, electronic payments, electronic authentication and electronic documents, and e-CURIA, which is essentially just an e-filing system. Additionally, other countries within the European Union have incorporated certain technologies into their adjudication of justice, such as the United Kingdom, Italy and Spain. For its part, the United Kingdom is most renowned for its Money Claim Online (MCOL), which is a service that allows a claim to be instituted online against two people at most who owe up {{to a maximum of}} £100,000 that they refuse to pay. [...] Italy, on the other hand, offers Trial Online, which is essentially an electronic filing and case management system simultaneously. Finally, Spain has passed particular laws whose aim is to regulate technology used in conjunction with the legal system and has ultimately resulted in the incorporation of technology in the legal system for the purposes of treating data and managing legal files, {{not the least of which}} is LexNET which enables the secure transfer of judicial data.|$|E

The use of {{information}} and communications technologies {{has been identified as}} one of the means suitable for supplementing the var-ious reforms in convalescing the performance of the justice sector. The Government of Uganda has made strides in the implementation of e-Government to effectively utilize information and communications tech-nologies in governance. The justice players are manifested in a justice, law and order sector which is based on the the Sector Wide Approach whose basic principle is that communication, cooperation and coordina-tion between institutions can greatly add value to service delivery within a sector. Although a subset of e-Government, <b>e-Justice</b> aims at improv-ing service delivery and collaboration between all justice players through the use of ICTs and needs to be spear-headed at a sector level. This work proposes ways of harnessing the existing opportunities and methods to implement <b>e-Justice</b> in Uganda that will culminate into a generic frame-work that can be applied in similar countries...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Information systems {{development}} methodologies are still mainly {{concerned with the}} research of better ways to provide technical solutions for given organisational problems. The paper challenges the appropriateness of this scope of development methodologies when system development deals with the deployment of information infrastructures. The attempt of the Italian Ministry of Justice to deploy <b>e-justice,</b> a new information infrastructure for the judiciary, is taken as an explanatory case. The research data suggests that development methodologies supporting information system development {{that focus on the}} solution of technical problems result that are appropriate to match design and adoption processes in simple organisational contexts, such {{as in the case of}} the automation of bureaucratic procedures supporting judicial activities. When the involved context and adoption process is more complex and challenging, as in the <b>e-justice</b> case, it seems necessary to change the aim and scope of the chosen system development methodologies. The conceptual shift from information systems to information infrastructures allows one to grasp this growing complexity and to propose development methodologies, such as cultivation, that eases the deployment of such initiatives...|$|E
40|$|Integration in Europe has {{resulted}} in a steadily increasing number of legal procedures containing cross-border effects which require better cooperation between different national judicial systems and simpler and more efficient procedures for the users. Information and Communication technologies can help make cross-border judicial procedures more transparent, efficient and economic both in civil and criminal matters. e-CODEX is an important project of the EU in the domain of <b>e-Justice</b> that aims to provide to citizens, enterprises and legal professionals an easier access to justice in cross border procedures, as well as make cross-border collaboration of courts and authorities easier and more efficient. It develops the required infrastructure and the organizational, procedural and legal environment necessary and also conducts a number of real life cross-border pilots. One of the first such pilots to become operational is that of the European Payment Order (EPO), in which Greece also participates.

40|$|Increasingly, {{public sector}} organisations are {{adopting}} Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) {{in order to}} improve their operations, a tendency that is commonly referred to as “e-government”. However, e-government also comes with some major challenges for public administrators in introducing and managing those e-services, because they are usually located at the nexus of technological innovation and organisational and institutional change. In order to achieve the expected benefits from ICT in public organisations, work processes need to be re-engineered, whilst responsibilities and authority locations are shifting. A particular challenge in this respect is the trend towards e-services that cut across traditional organisational boundaries and integrate information flows between a number of different organisational actors with complex settings of strongly divergent backgrounds, practices and interests. Good examples of this, and the focus of this paper, are e-services in the judiciary (“e-justice”). In this paper, we address the issue of mediation required to motivate actors for collaboration in joint <b>e-justice</b> services. Our main research question therefore is: What is the role of legal frameworks for mediation and legitimization of collaborative implementation in inter-organisational <b>e-justice</b> projects? We will address this question by means of a case study analysis on judicial videoconferencing in the Netherlands, a project called “Telehoren en Telepleiten” (THTP) ...|$|E
40|$|At the EU level, an {{increasing}} number of resources are being invested in an attempt to provide better public services through the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). While new tools are being designed and implemented, a shift from ‘traditional’ technologies that must be used to provide services to more interactive ‘smart’ technologies is beginning to take place. At the same time, an adequate understanding of the implications of this shift is still missing. This paper focuses on the EU <b>e-Justice</b> experience with the ‘API-for-Justice’ project, which investigates the challenges of opening up the European <b>e-Justice</b> Digital Service Infrastructure to external service providers by means of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). In particular, the exploration of potential services that can be provided by third parties through APIs for Justice shows the potential for a radical redesign of the justice service provision, where, for example, justice services are not requested by the party but are proposed or initiated by smart components of the infrastructure on the basis of inputs from the environment. In this perspective, smart technology research and, in particular, Brenner (2007) ’s discussion on law and smart technology help to uncover the still unclear dynamics of change that characterize one of the key pillars of modern society: justice...|$|E

40|$|Information {{technology}} has now pervaded the legal sector, {{and the very}} modern concepts of e-law and <b>e-justice</b> show that automation processes are ubiquitous. European policies on transparency and information society, in particular, {{require the use of}} technology and its steady improvement. Some of the revised papers presented in this book originate from a workshop held at the European University Institute of Florence, Italy, in December 2006. The workshop was devoted to the discussion of the different ways of understanding and explaining contemporary law, for the purpose of building computable models of it [...] especially models enabling the development of computer applications for the legal domain. During the course of the following year, several new contributions, provided by a number of ongoing (or recently finished) European projects on computation and law, were received, discussed and reviewed to complete the survey.

40|$|Access {{to justice}} {{has become an}} {{important}} issue in many justice systems around the world. Increasingly, technology {{is seen as a}} potential facilitator of access to justice, particularly in terms of improving justice sector efficiency. The international diffusion of information systems (IS) within the justice sector raises the important question of how to insure quality performance. The IS literature has stressed a set of general design principles for the implementation of complex information technology systems that have also been applied to these systems in the justice sector. However, an emerging <b>e-justice</b> literature emphasizes the significance of unique law and technology concerns that are especially relevant to implementing and evaluating information technology systems in the justice sector specifically. Moreover, there is growing recognition that both principles relating to the design of information technology systems themselves (“system design principles”), as well as to designing and managing the processes by which systems are created and implemented (“design management principles”) can be critical to positive outcomes. This paper uses six <b>e-justice</b> system examples to illustrate and elaborate upon the system design and design management principles in a manner intended to assist an interdisciplinary legal audience to better understand how these principles might impact upon a system’s ability to improve access to justice: three European examples (Italian Trial Online; English and Welsh Money Claim Online; the trans-border European Union e-CODEX) and three Canadian examples (Ontario’s Integrated Justice Project (IJP), Ontario’s Court Information Management System (CIMS), and British Columbia’s eCourt project) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{growing number}} of studies on ICT {{innovation}} experiences in the justice sector report a few easy successes and, far more frequently, difficult (and long) struggles to overcome multiple and often unexpected problems. Empirical analysis shows that these problems {{are the result of}} the complex interplay between technological, institutional, organizational and normative components of <b>e-justice.</b> What has been discovered is that the techno-institutional systems that are developed in the making of <b>e-justice</b> need not to be just technically functional, but also institutionally, organizationally and normatively compatible with the justice system. As the implementation of such systems breaks established practices and shared visions of what should be done, how and by whom, innovation requires the re-establishment of such agreements in the new situation. Cognitive, social and institutional features of the domain in which the innovation takes place thus play a paramount role in the innovation effort. This paper shows the interesting case of the development of an e-filing system, TéléRecours, in the French administrative justice sector. The system has been developed following a functional simplification strategy to cope with the technological, organizational and normative complexity of the endeavour. Such a strategy had been successfully adopted by several Northern European countries, but generally it had not been followed in Continental Europe, where much less successful attempts to create functional equivalents of paper-based procedures had been made. As the paper will attempt to explain, the functional simplification approach allowed the French justice administration to develop a functioning technology which is appreciated by the limited number of those who use it but that, due to its incapability of attaining institutional compatibility, is failing to exit the experimental phase...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} one of {{the most}} debated and controversial issues regarding the changes which are taking place in the Justice domain: the complexity of developing and implementing ITC systems that ‘actually work’, and doing so with a reasonable budget and in a reasonable time. While the number of studies on National experiences is slowly growing (see for example Fabri & Contini 2001, Fabri 2007, Contini & Lanzara 2009, Reiling 2012), filling an often-mentioned gap in justice sector literature, building on the European project e-CODEX case study, the authors point the attention to a somewhat new and unexplored phenomenon, the concrete attempt to build cross-border electronic data exchange within the European justice field. e-CODEX (<b>e-Justice</b> Communication via Online Data Exchange) is the first European Large Scale Pilot in the domain of <b>e-Justice.</b> The project is carried out by 19 partners either being or representing their national ministries of justice of 15 European countries, plus the Council of Bars and Law Societies of Europe (CCBE), the Conseil des Notariats de l'Union Européenne (CNUE) and the National Research Council of Italy (through two of its institutes - IRSIG-CNR and ITTIG-CNR). To provide a better grasp of the project scale, its overall budget is over 14 M euro and about 14 hundred person-months are committed to it. The project aims at improving cross-border access of citizens and businesses to legal means in Europe, as well as to improve the interoperability between legal authorities of different Member States. With a case based approach, e-CODEX is developing and will be soon implementing an interoperability layer to connect existing National Systems in order to provide cross border <b>e-justice</b> services. The project commitment includes running a live pilot in a ‘production environment’ for a duration of twelve months. The electronic services that have been so far selected are: European Payment Order (EPO), European Small Claim procedure, European Arrest Warrant (EAW), and the Secure cross-border exchange of sensitive data. The paper provides a description of the on-going project, showing the additional layers of complexity which affect the design and innovation of ICT when the scope of the system being created crosses not only organizational and institutional boundaries, but also national borders. When implementing their National Systems, many European countries have experienced difficulties ranging from delays to never ending design or piloting stages to more or less openly declared failures. According to the authors’ main hypothesis, and in line with a growing number of empirical studies, this complexity is caused by several factors such as technological, organisational, normative, and their intertwining. Furthermore, it provides the opportunity to begin investigating the changes deriving from such a project in terms of governance and public value of the services delivered.   </p...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{shows how}} in the EU the {{institutionalisation}} of the norms, practices and procedures of accountability and transparency reflects politico-legal values and commitments to sustaining them, {{in ways that are}} visible, open, embedded, just, legitimate and not arbitrary.

First, the paper outlines the norms; then it argues that institutions are not sufficient in themselves to sustain liberty and freedom because new communication technologies (ICTs) impact on e-government and <b>e-justice</b> in ways that are not simply procedural. They may expedite administration and result in ‘efficiency gains’, but they also impact on the practices of transparency and accountability, something underscored by their appropriation by the champions of ‘security’...|$|E

Intensification of illegal immigration, trafficking of drugs, weapons and human beings and the advent of terrorism have made necessary a stronger judicial collaboration between European countries. This cooperation includes mutual recognition of judicial decisions, collaboration in investigation phases and approximation of national penal legislations. During investigations, an exchange of information on criminal offences and administrative infringements takes place between judges and investigators belonging to different countries. This exchange is still mainly based on paper support.

It concerned looking for acceptable compromises as to what could be done and how. The challenge was also to find ways to motivate users to actively participate in the creation of the new service which could not work without them.

40|$|The chapter {{analyses}} {{the ways}} in which technology and law disperse, channel and reassemble agency in ICT enabled legal proceedings. It works from five of the case studies of <b>e-justice</b> discussed in the book, assessing how different approaches magnify or reduce complexity and affect systems development and use. The law can legitimate ensembles of technological and performative procedures, but it cannot construct them by regulation through a legal blueprint. Attempts at excessive legal regulation quickly raise complexity to unmanageable levels. Technology is assessed as a distinct regulative regime that opens new channels of communication, potentially duplicating existing legal and traditional channels. The regulation of technology could take advantage of this state of affairs. Machines and software codes identify and admit participants and direct human activity. Some of the difficulties in reproducing legal processes in technologically enabled environments are explained by the demands of the performative, where meanings exceed the demands of simple information flow. The chapter explores the requirements of meaning making, by which participants recognise the context and the legal consequences of ICT enabled procedures. The interfaces of law and technology rely on the interpretive context in which messages are understood as well as the legal forms in which they are transmitted. Each of these elements is essential to assure the circulation of agency in ICT enabled legal proceedings, while ensuring the legality of the entire ensemble...|$|E
40|$|The need {{to improve}} the {{effectiveness}} and efficiency of the judicial system in Nigeria has necessitated the use of modern information and communication technology (ICT). The conventional method of justice delivery in Nigeria is marred with avoidable delays in the dispensation of justice and lack of transparency. However, the constraints of conventional methods of judicial system in Nigeria can only be solved by embracing the electronic justice system. Hence, ICT should be employed in conducting most of the activities in Nigerian Courts, considering its successful adoption and use in some other jurisdictions. This article therefore, aims at examining in extensio a way out from the conventional methods of justice delivery {{in the area of}} e-filing of court processes e. g. originating processes, Motions, addresses, briefs and other processes; e-recording of court proceedings; e-archives (to facilitate retrieval of judgments, rulings, etc); and e-probate etc. In doing so, the paper will focus on towing the path of electronic ways in enhancing effective justice delivery in the Nigerian Courts as an antidote to the delays being experienced in the service delivery associated with the conventional method. To achieve this, reliance has been placed on secondary source, emanating from books, case laws, articles in learned journals, conference papers and other relevant materials.

Despite the many research projects in the field, a collective reflection on the theoretical foundations of legal ontology engineering was still missing. This book bridges the gap, by exploring current methodologies and theoretical approaches to legal ontologies. It gathers 16 papers, each of them presenting issues and solutions for ontology engineering related to a particular approach to, or aspect of, the law: comparative law, case-based reasoning, multilingualism, complex- systems, sociolegal analysis, legal theory, social ontology, ontology learning, computational ontology, service ontology, cognitive science, document modelling, large legal databases, scientific, linguistic and legal-technology perspectives. The book will thus interest researchers in legal informatics, artificial intelligence and law, legal theory, legal philosophy, legal sociology, comparative law, as well as developers of applications based on the intelligent management of legal information, in both e-commerce and e-government (e-administration, <b>e-justice,</b> e-democracy).

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{reports on}} a successful co-operation between academic researchers and non-academic institutions to investigate the quality and viability of videoconference-based interpreting in legal proceedings. The collaborative approach outlined here will {{be of interest to}} a number of public services, especially to legal, healthcare and local government institutions, which encounter problems with access to qualified interpreters. The collaboration started in 2008 in response to the observation that videoconference links were widely used by police forces, courts, probation and prison services in Europe and that the use of interpreters in such video links was rapidly increasing. Furthermore, in 2008, the Metropolitan Police Service in London began to consider the use of ‘remote interpreting’ via video link to reduce interpreter travel costs. At European level, the adoption of Directive 2010 / 64 /EU on the right to interpretation and translation in criminal proceedings created a legal basis for using videoconference links to gain access to qualified legal interpreters. However, until 2008, very little was known about the viability and quality of videoconference-based interpreting in legal proceedings. There was a high risk of potential miscarriages of justice through the combined effects of videoconferencing and interpreting. Relevant training for legal practitioners and interpreters was non-existent. There was thus an urgent need for practice-oriented research and research-led practical guidance. To address these issues, we formed a European partner consortium that included research institutions with combined experience in legal interpreting and videoconference communication (University of Surrey, KU Leuven, Institut Télécom Paris); relevant governmental bodies (Ministry of Security and Justice of the Netherlands, Dutch Legal Aid Board, Local Police Antwerp); a lawyer from the Antwerp-based law firm Van der Mussele-Vanden Bosch; a lawyer-linguist with 30 years’ experience as a Magistrate in the UK; and the Polish Society of Sworn and Specialised Translators. The aim was to conduct a comparative study of traditional and video interpreting, and to use the findings to develop guidelines of good practice and to design and pilot training modules for interpreters and legal practitioners. This collaboration was funded by the European Commission, Directorate-General for Justice from 2008 - 11 (AVIDICUS 1; JLS/ 2008 /JPEN/ 03) and 2011 - 13 (AVIDICUS 2; JUST/ 2010 /JPEN/AG/ 1558). The presentation first explains how this collaboration was implemented and outlines its major achievements, which include a collaborative book publication by the consortium partners (Braun & Taylor, eds, 2012. Videoconference and remote interpreting in legal proceedings. Cambridge/Antwerp: Intersentia); incorporation of our guidelines into the Guide on Videoconferencing produced by the European Council Working Party on e-Law (eJustice) and into the European <b>e-Justice</b> Portal [URL] delivery of our training modules to over 350 police-certified interpreters at the Metropolitan Police Service in London; advising offender management institutions in Europe on the use of videoconferencing and interpreting. The subsequent discussion and assessment of these achievements focuses on highlighting the benefits of the collaborative approach, especially outlining the reasons why this approach is likely to have generated greater impact on relevant stakeholders than an ‘ivory-tower’ approach. The discussion then turns to potential challenges, especially the question of how different interests in this type of collaboration can be balanced and how researcher independence can be maintained. The presentation will end by explaining how this collaboration is currently being continued and extended in AVIDICUS 3 (2013 - 16, JUST/ 2013 /JPEN/AG/ 4553). status: publishe...|$|E
