2500|$|EFS {{works by}} {{encrypting}} a file with a bulk symmetric key, {{also known as}} the File Encryption Key, or FEK. It uses a symmetric encryption algorithm because it takes less time to encrypt and decrypt large amounts of data than if an asymmetric key cipher is used. [...] The symmetric encryption algorithm used will vary depending on the version and configuration of the operating system; see Algorithms used by Windows version below. [...] The FEK (the symmetric key that is used to encrypt the file) is then encrypted with a public key that is associated with the user who encrypted the file, and this encrypted FEK is stored in the $EFS alternate data stream of the encrypted file. To decrypt the file, the EFS component driver uses the private key that matches the EFS <b>digital</b> <b>certificate</b> (used to encrypt the file) to decrypt the symmetric key that is stored in the $EFS stream. The EFS component driver then uses the symmetric key to decrypt the file. Because the encryption & decryption operations are performed at a layer below NTFS, it is transparent to the user and all their applications.|$|E
