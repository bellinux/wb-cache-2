5000|$|It {{is often}} useful to {{consider}} implicit price deflators for certain subcategories of GDP, such as computer hardware. In this case, {{it is useful}} to think <b>of</b> the price <b>deflator</b> as the ratio of the current-year price of a good to its price in some base year. The price in the base year is normalized to 100. For example, for computer hardware, we could define a [...] "unit" [...] to be a computer with a specific level of processing power, memory, hard drive space and so on. A price <b>deflator</b> <b>of</b> 200 means that the current-year price of this computing power is twice its base-year price - price inflation. A price <b>deflator</b> <b>of</b> 50 means that the current-year price is half the base year price - price deflation. This can lead to a situation where official statistics reflect a drop in prices, even though they have stayed the same.|$|R
40|$|We {{model and}} {{estimate}} the effects to downstream productivity from information technology (IT) investments made upstream. Specifically, we examine how an industry's productivity {{is affected by}} the IT capital stock of its suppliers. These supplier-driven IT spillovers occur because, due to competition in the supplying industry, quality benefits from suppliers' IT investments can pass downstream. If the output <b>deflators</b> <b>of</b> supplying industries (consequently the intermediate input <b>deflator</b> <b>of</b> the using industries) do not capture the quality improvement from IT, then the output productivity of the supplying industries is mismeasured or misassigned. We develop and empirically test a model capturing these supplier-driven effects using data on 85 manufacturing industries at the three-digit SIC code level. We find that for a 10. 5 % increase in suppliers' IT capital, the suppliers' output increases by 0. 63 %- 0. 70 %, which is more than covering the cost of the increase in suppliers' IT capital. In addition, this increase in suppliers' IT capital increases the average downstream industry's output by $ 66 -$ 72 million, thereby confirming substantial supplier-driven IT spillovers downstream. We also infer the magnitude of the measurement error <b>of</b> the price <b>deflator</b> <b>of</b> the intermediate input resulting from the failure to account for IT-related quality improvement, finding that the measured price deflator overestimates the true deflator by approximately 30 % at the mean level of IT capital.

By contrast, we have a negative correlation between height and the mortality rate and height and the ratio between the <b>deflator</b> <b>of</b> private consumption and the GDP deflator.
