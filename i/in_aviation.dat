5|$|Swiss {{military}} aviation {{began in}} 1900with {{the creation of}} an observation balloon force. Swiss balloonists were first engaged in combat on 7October 1918, near the end of World War I, when a German airplane accidentally attacked a Swiss observation balloon stationed close to the German border and killed the observer, Lieutenant Werner Flury. The balloon force was eventually disestablished in 1938when developments <b>in</b> <b>aviation</b> made it obsolete.|$|E

5|$|The {{next day}} {{tempered}} this achievement. Despite shooting down two more aircraft, {{it was the}} first time he had lost his wingman. Unteroffizier Johann Kalb had to bail out over the Volga River and was captured by Soviet troops. On 17 September he claimed three more victories but a 20mm Soviet cannon-shell went through his canopy, narrowly missing his head. On 23 September, he scored a remarkable ten victories in three missions, taking him to 197. On 26 September, he became the first pilot <b>in</b> <b>aviation</b> history to claim 200 enemy aircraft shot down. The 62 victories he claimed in that single month (of September) remain a record unbeaten <b>in</b> <b>aviation</b> history. Elevated to hero status by the Luftwaffe, he was promoted to Major on 29 September and forbidden from flying further combat missions. The whole of JG52 gathered at Soldatskaja to congratulate him before he flew back to Berlin a few days later.|$|E

5|$|Born in Hamburg, Ostermann {{joined the}} {{military}} service of the Luftwaffe in 1937 and was trained as a pilot. After a brief period with Zerstörergeschwader 1 (ZG1), a heavy fighter unit, he was transferred to Jagdgeschwader 54 (JG54). He participated in the Battle of France and Britain before transferring east. He became the sixth fighter pilot <b>in</b> <b>aviation</b> history to achieve 100 aerial victories on the Eastern Front {{for which he was}} awarded Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords.

40|$|The {{traditional}} and current approach to business models <b>in</b> business <b>aviation</b> is {{based only on}} aircraft ownership and does not describe the business aviation segment of civil <b>aviation</b> sufficiently. <b>In</b> this paper, we apply a two-dimensional approach analysing the product of companies competing <b>in</b> the business <b>aviation</b> segment of civil aviation.

5|$|Hermann Graf (24 October 1912 – 4 November 1988) was a German Luftwaffe World War II fighter ace. He {{served on}} both the Eastern and Western Fronts. He became the first pilot <b>in</b> <b>aviation</b> history to claim 200 aerial victories—that is, 200 aerial combat {{encounters}} resulting {{in the destruction of}} the enemy aircraft. In about 830 combat missions, he claimed a total of 212 aerial victories, almost all of which were achieved on the Eastern Front.|$|E
5|$|In late 1933, he was {{employed}} at the Sheba Gold Mine at Baberton. He enjoyed the work {{so much he}} contemplated studying for a mining degree.

Consequently, Pattle changed his mind about engineering and opted to find a career as a pilot.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{grew up and}} {{was educated}} in the East Midlands, where he {{qualified}} as an engineer. A sportsman, Johnson broke his collarbone while playing rugby, an injury that later complicated his ambitions of becoming a fighter pilot. Johnson had been interested <b>in</b> <b>aviation</b> since his youth and applied to join the RAF. He was initially rejected, first on social, and then on medical grounds; he was eventually accepted in August 1939. The injury problems, however, returned during his early training and flying career, resulting in him missing the Battle of France and the Battle of Britain between May and October 1940.|$|E

5|$|The Supermarine Spitfire is a British single-seat fighter {{aircraft}} {{that was used}} by the Royal Air Force and many other Allied countries before, during and after World War II.
