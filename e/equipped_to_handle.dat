5|$|American {{alligators}} {{are less}} vulnerable to cold than American crocodiles. Unlike an American crocodile, which would immediately succumb to the cold and drown in water at , an American alligator can survive in such temperatures for some time without displaying any signs of discomfort. This adaptiveness {{is thought to be}} the reason why American alligators are widespread further north than the American crocodile. In fact, the American alligator is found farther from the equator and is more <b>equipped</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> cooler conditions than any other crocodilian. When the water begins to freeze, American alligators stick their snouts through the surface which allows them to breathe above the ice.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{facilities}} are <b>equipped</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> TBI better than others; initial measures include transporting patients to an appropriate treatment center. Both during transport and in hospital the primary concerns are ensuring proper oxygen supply, maintaining adequate {{blood flow to}} the brain, and controlling raised intracranial pressure (ICP), since high ICP deprives the brain of badly needed blood flow and can cause deadly brain herniation. Other methods to prevent damage include management of other injuries and prevention of seizures. Some data supports the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy to improve outcomes.|$|E
5|$|In {{a series}} of {{meetings}} beginning on 25 April, Eichmann met with Joel Brand, a Hungarian Jew and member of the Relief and Rescue Committee (RRC). Eichmann later testified that Berlin had authorised him to allow emigration of a million Jews in exchange for 10,000 trucks <b>equipped</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> the wintry conditions on the Eastern Front. Nothing came of the proposal, as the Western Allies refused to consider the offer. In June 1944 Eichmann was involved in negotiations with Rudolf Kasztner that resulted in the rescue of 1,684 people, who were sent by train to safety in Switzerland in exchange for three suitcases full of diamonds, gold, cash, and securities.|$|E

In addition two license-built 2-pounder AA guns were mounted on the forecastle deck. In 1925–26 the foremast was replaced by a four-legged mast, which was moved forward of the funnels, the rangefinders were upgraded, and the ship was <b>equipped</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> a Macchi M.18 seaplane mounted on the center turret.

5|$|With {{the end of}} the war in August 1945, the Manhattan Project's {{priority}} {{shifted from}} speed to economy and efficiency. By early 1946, with K-27 in operation, the K-25 plant was producing 3.6kg per day, enriched to 30 percent. The next step was to increase the enrichment further to 60 percent. This was achieved on 20 July 1946. This presented a problem, because Y-12 was not <b>equipped</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> feed that was so highly enriched, but the Los Alamos Laboratory required 95 percent. For a time, product was mixed with feed to reduce the enrichment to 30 percent. Taking the concentration up to 95 percent raised a number of safety concerns, as there was the risk of a criticality accident.|$|E
5|$|In Louisiana, Governor Edwin Edwards {{declared}} a state of emergency. About 1.25million people evacuated from the central and southeast Louisiana, while approximately 60,000others fled parishes in southwest Louisiana. A mandatory evacuation from Grand Isle was ordered by Mayor Andy Valence and the city council. In New Orleans, Mayor Sidney Barthelemy ordered the evacuation of about 200,000residents in the low-lying areas of the city. Nine shelters were opened in the city, which were occupied by thousands of people. In response to computer simulations showing that storm surge from a tropical cyclone like Hurricane Andrew could over-top the levees, workers closed 111floodgates. The Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport closed, with jumbo jets being flown to other airports. A total of 250members of the Louisiana National Guard patrolled the streets during the storm.

40|$|A lack of work {{engagement}} among employees {{is costing}} US businesses a reported $ 300 {{billion a year}} in lost productivity, while absenteeism, turnover, workplace stress, and health care costs are also accounting for the same degree of financial loss. To investigate the effect of physical activity (PA) on work engagement (WE) and resilience among corporate employees, 200 employees from a range of corporate New Zealand businesses took part in a 16 -week workplace-based health initiative known as the Global Corporate Challenge (GCC), which was aimed at increasing levels of PA among employees. Participants recorded their amount of PA {{through the use of a}} pedometer that uploaded daily levels into an online personal database provided by the GCC. Self-reported measures of WE and resilience were assessed both prior to, and following the challenge. The study provided support for the hypotheses that both WE and resilience would increase after participation in the GCC, however, contrary to further hypotheses, increasing levels of PA did not improve WE and resilience among participants. The results of this study may assist organisations in achieving not only a workforce better <b>equipped</b> <b>to</b> <b>handling</b> the challenges and stressors of today‟s workplace, but organisational success, and financial performance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Protocols for {{opportunistic}} {{networks have}} until this point {{focused primarily on}} overcoming the partitioning of those networks. However, emerging studies show that opportunistic networks also exhibit considerable clustering. Neither current storecarry-forward protocols nor path-based protocols are <b>equipped</b> <b>to</b> effectively <b>handle</b> both of these network characteristics. In response, we present the design of light-weight clustering techniques that allow our protocol, Mercury, to perform well in both partitioned and clustered environments by integrating store-carry-forward techniques with path-based techniques when appropriate. Our evaluations show that Mercury can significantly increase delivery ratio (from 13 % to 80 % over existing protocols with real life traces) while lowering average latency considerably. I...|$|R
