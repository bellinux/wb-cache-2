40|$|Abstract. The Specification and Description Language (SDL) is a {{worldwide}} accepted standard {{for development of}} new protocols, e. g. {{an increasing number of}} IEEE protocol standards uses SDL. Especially for mobile devices {{it is important that the}} protocol implementation is as energy efficient as possible. This cannot be achieved with a straight forward code generation from SDL to a target language as for example C. Thus, the normal way is that after the specification is done, parts of the protocol are implemented by hand using C or even VHDL. In this paper we are presenting our profiling tool, profSDL, which is designed to support engineers in determining the partitioning of the SDL specification. profSDL allows to determine static effort and <b>dynamic</b> <b>effort</b> of the protocol under development. The <b>dynamic</b> <b>effort</b> can be assigned to the protocol itself as well as to the SDL runtime environment. We applied profSDL to a fully functional SDL model of IEEE 802. 11 a. The design decisions indicated by profSDL matched exactly what the designers decided manually. The major benefit of profSDL is that it works on SDL level, so that the profiling results are independent of any potential implementation decision e. g. programming language features. 1...|$|E

40|$|Presented at the 2012 American Control Conference, June 27 - 29, Montréal, Canada. In this paper, {{we present}} an {{approach}} to motion sequencing and generation in which “style of motion” is {{taken into account in}} a systematic manner. In particular, we present a method for injecting so-called <b>dynamic</b> <b>efforts</b> into a discrete motion sequencing framework that utilizes existing theory of stylistic human movement to inform a principled approach to generating trajectories. Namely, choosing weights in a linearquadratic cost function leads to trajectories corresponding to the eight basic effort qualities found in dance theory; each weight scales a different motion factor that describes an element of style perceived by an audience. Combined with a stylesensitive motion sequencing scheme, we can fully describe stylistic system behavior. Thus, this paper also reports on the application of this general framework to the problem of generating motion sequences for a humanoid robot that exhibit distinctly different stylistic behaviors though they are composed from the same underlying building blocks...|$|R
40|$|This paper computes {{the change}} in welfare {{associated}} {{with the introduction of}} incentives. Specifically, we calculate by how much the welfare gains of increased output due to incentives outweigh workers' disutility from increased effort. We accomplish this by studying the use of incentives by a firm in the check-clearing industry. Using this firm's production records, we model and estimate the worker's <b>dynamic</b> <b>effort</b> decision problem. We find that the firm's incentive scheme has a large effect on productivity, raising it by 14 % over the sample period. Using our parameter estimates, we show that the cost of increased effort due to incentives is equal to the dollar value of a 9 % rise in productivity. Welfare is measured as the output produced minus the cost of effort, hence the net increase in welfare due to the introduction of the firm's bonus plan is 5 %. Under a first-best scheme, we find that the net increase in welfare is 6 %. Welfare...|$|E

In this paper, we present an agent-based model of the relations between a <b>dynamic</b> <b>effort</b> allocation system, an evolving trust framework and a reputation module to study how changes in micro-level rent-seeking traits and decisions can shape the emergence of trust across the simulated environment. According to our results, variations in trust are correlated more with the returns to being productive, rather than rent-seeking. In line with previous studies, our model shows that higher than average levels of risk-taking by agents lead to further trust and gains during an interaction, though taken to an extreme, both trust and gain can decline as a result of reckless decisions. We also report on the formation of trust clusters in our model as an emergent phenomenon. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBy {{knowing the}} correct {{values of the}} {{parameters}} of maximal effort corresponding to the stages in the energy consumption of an individual's body, we can externalize the coordinates of the <b>dynamic</b> <b>effort,</b> i. e. {{the nature of the}} instructional objectives, the role of the exercises, the volume of work involved and the intensity and complexity of the effort. The major energy systems have also been connected with physiological parameters such as: heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, etc. The evaluation of the students’ maximal aerobic capacity (VO 2 max) is thus a prior reference point in the optimal management of effort parameters in institutional sports activities. During a set of systematic programs of physical exercises, the heart “learns” to work economically both at rest and during physical activities of various intensities. As a result, the heart rate decreases gradually and the heart gets better at adapting to effort. This more or less guarantees heart disease prevention, optimizes cardiac input which involves the proper functioning of the cardiovascular system and of all the other organs of the human body. Besides inducing functional improvements, aerobic effort also develops muscle flexibility, joint mobility, coordination, it increases force, speed and resistance, thus improving the students’ overall physical condition through its aerobic functional components...|$|E
