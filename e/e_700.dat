Six FHM families underwent extensive clinical and genetic investigation. The authors identified a novel ATP 1 A 2 mutation (<b>E</b> <b>700</b> K) in three patients from one family.

The purpose of these FEM simulations was to study the dependence of target plate steel alloy on the ballistic limit velocity of the projectile resulting from the modified Gurson model. It {{was found that the}} modified Gurson model is able to reproduce the dependence seen in experiments, but that it is strongly dependent on a certain model parameter related to the shear stress dependence on material damage.

40|$|The {{performance}} of nickel-samaria-doped ceria (Ni-SDC) anode-supported cell with COCO 2 feed was evaluated. The {{aim of this}} work is to examine carbon formation on the NiSDC anode when feeding with CO under conditions when carbon deposition is thermodynamically favoured. Electrochemical tests were conducted at intermediate temperatures (550 <b>e</b> <b>700</b> �C) using 20 and 40 % CO concentrations. Cell operating with 40 % CO at 600 <b>e</b> <b>700</b> �C provided maximum power densities of 239 e 270 mW cm 2, 1. 5 times smaller than that achieved with humidified H 2. Much lower maximum power densities were attained with 20 % CO (50 e 88 mW cm 2). Some degradation was observed during the 6 h galvanostatic operation at 0. 1 A cm 2 with 40 % CO fuel at 550 �C which is believed due to the accumulation of carbon at the anode. The degradation in cell potential occurred {{at a rate of}} 4. 5 mV h 1, but it did not lead to cell collapse. EDX mapping at the cross-section of the anode revealed that carbon formed in the Ni-SDC cell was primarily deposited in the anode section close to the fuel entry point. Carbon was not detected at the electrolyte-anode interface and the middle of the anode, allowing the cell to continue operation with CO fuel without a catastrophic failure...|$|E

40|$|Sulfur in the {{air stream}} {{is one of the}} major {{contaminants}} affecting the performance stability of cathodes of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) such as La 0. 6 Sr 0. 4 Co 0. 2 Fe 0. 8 O 3 -δ (LSCF) perovskite. Here sulfur deposition and poisoning was investigated on LSCF bar samples in the presence of 20 ppm SO 2 and temperature range of 400 – 900 °C, using scanning electron microscopy, confocal laser Raman spectroscopy and electrical conductivity relaxation (ECR) methods. Sulfur (SO 2) reacts with LSCF, primarily forming SrSO 4 at high temperatures (i. <b>e.,</b> ≥ <b>700</b> °C) and SrS at low temperatures (i. <b>e.</b> < <b>700</b> °C). Surface segregated SrO plays an important role in the sulfur deposition. The most important observation of this study is that sulfur deposition shows a distinct volcano-type dependency on the heat-treatment temperature and is most pronounced at temperatures around 700 °C, indicating that the reaction rate between the segregated SrO and SO 2 is highest at ∼ 700 °C. The ECR results indicate that the surface exchange coefficient of LSCF after the exposure to 20 ppm SO 2 at 700, 800 and 900 °C for 48 h is two orders of magnitude lower than that of the sample tested in the absence of SO 2, indicating that sulfur poisoning deteriorates significantly the surface exchange and diffusion processes for the O 2 reduction reaction on LSCF electrodes...|$|R
