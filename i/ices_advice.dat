40|$|The Rockall Trough or Channel is {{a clearly}} delimited {{deepwater}} area {{lying to the}} west of the British Isles. The eastern and western boundaries are formed by the continental margin and the Rockall Plateau, respectively. To the north it is separated from the colder Norwegian Sea by a ridge at about 500 m depth. To the south the depth steadily increases to abyssal depths. Some of the earliest descriptions of deep-water fishes are from this area in the 1860 s and 1870 s. The UK and Germany carried out deep-water exploratory fishing surveys in the 1970 s and 1980 s and detailed biological studies by the Scottish Association for Marine Science began in 1975. Although some deep-water fishing began in the 1970 s the rapid increase in commercial exploitation did not begin until 1989. As a result there is information on the fish populations and their biology that pre-date the fishery. Since then several countries have carried out research surveys in the area and there has been some monitoring of landings and discards. There are documented concerns about the vulnerability of the fish stocks since 1993 and ICES considers them to be outside safe biological limits. The most recent <b>ICES</b> <b>advice</b> is for a 50 % reduction in fishing effort for the main species. Despite <b>ICES</b> <b>advice</b> the fishery remains unregulated.

40|$|North Sea herring {{is managed}} by the EU and Norway through a harvest control rule where target fishing mortalities are changed if the {{estimated}} SSB falls below a trigger biomass million tonnes). This management agreement was adopted in December 1997, amended in November 2004. The management agreement includes target fishing mortalities both adult and juvenile fish. Initial studies to test the robustness of the rule assumed stable state of productivity, with stochastic variability in recruitment. Recruitment in North Sea herring has been relatively poor for the last 4 year classes 2003, 2004 and 2005). This sustained sequence of reduced recruitment has not observed before at current levels of stock biomass. According to a recent ICES study SGRECVAP) this serial poor recruitment has been caused {{by an increase in}} the mortality larvae over the first winter, and was not due to overexploitation of the stock. Thus, the short term, the productivity of North Sea herring has changed, whilst the management agreement currently has not. As the agreement is primarily based on target fishing mortalities, changes in productivity should not undermine the management agreements ability to stock, because the trigger points are based on biomass, nevertheless the agreement longer be optimum for sustainable exploitation. 2006, the <b>ICES</b> <b>advice</b> changed to account for the changes in the productivity of North herring. Projected catches and SSBs were estimated assuming a shift in recruitment average of the last 25 years (since the stock recovered from collapse) to the average four years to reflect the more recent low levels.

40|$|In this article, we analyze how to {{evaluate}} fishery resource management under â€œecological uncertaintyâ€. In this context, an efficient policy consists of applying a different exploitation rule {{depending on the}} state of the resource and we could say that the stock is always in transition, jumping from one steady state to another.

Second, we apply the calibration procedure proposed in two different fishing grounds: the European Anchovy (Division VIII) and the Southern Stock of Hake. Our results show that the role played by uncertainty is essential for the conclusions. For European Anchovy fishery (Division VIII) we find, in contrast with Del Valle et al.

40|$|From 1993 to 2003 special {{surveys were}} {{conducted}} to analyse temporal and spatial aspects of the spawning activities of cod in the Baltic Sea. The <b>ICES</b> <b>advice</b> for cod in the Baltic Sea is based on yearly stock assessments of two separate stocks the western (SD 22 – 24) and the eastern stock (SD 25 – 32). Both stocks are characterized by different spawning seasons. The general progression of the maturity suggests that two types of development can be distinguished. In the western Baltic Sea (SD 22) the maturity development is temporal stable, with a relative short, main spawning period from March to April - spring spawner. In the Arkona Sea and Bornholm Basin the main spawning season starts in June and probably finishes in September - summer spawner. The proportion of spawners in summer is significantly higher than in spring in the Arkona Sea and Bornholm Basin. This again underlines {{the importance of the}} Arkona Sea for the reproduction success of the eastern Baltic cod stock. The analysis furthermore show, that the proportion of male spawners was significantly higher than the proportion of female spawners in all areas and the investigated months.

40|$|Striped {{red mullet}} (Mullus surmuletus) {{belongs to the}} species for which individualization of stocks is {{advanced}} by ICES in western Europe for areas including the Bay of Biscay and the areas bordering the Iberian peninsula. Since 2012, ICES has provided recommendations with regards to this stock. These recommendations are given for two years and are based on an approach adopted by ICES in 2012 in the case of insufficient data for an analytical evaluation (Data Limited Stocks, DLS). For 2013 and 2014, <b>ICES</b> <b>advice</b> consisted in a 20 % reduction in catches (average of the last 3 years:- 2009 - 2011) as a precautionary measure. Since that, no new advice has been formulated, the advice remains the same. Considering the impacts of such measurements on the French fishing fleet, improvement of the data available for stocks in the DLS category is therefore a priority. The project ROMELIGO aims to change this situation by contributing to the improvement of the knowledge on three stocks (striped red mullet, whiting and pollack) {{on the basis of the}} available data (declaring landing data or sampling data for French fishermen, data from scientific campaigns, etc.) or data to be collected (biological parameters). The first phase of the project analyzes the catches and the activity of the French professional fishery with regards to the species (composition and evolution of catches, seasonality, spatial distribution, gear used and discards).

40|$|What is the {{relationship}} between science and politics? What should it be? How are their respective roles conceived and acted out in practice? Should science and politics be clearly separated? How? Are there cases in which they can be usefully mixed? What cases are those, and are there some ways of mixing that are better than others? This project explores such questions by examining relationships between ICES fisheries advice and decision-making in fisheries management. While traditional conceptions portray science as a rather autonomous entity, this case examines a context in which such conceptions are particularly prone to be challenged. First, scientific advice that forms direct inputs into policy-making is better characterized as ‘research’ or ‘mode- 2 science’ than as autonomous science. Second, advisory science on fisheries management is ‘post-normal’ insofar as its knowledge claims are uncertain, values disputed and decisions urgent. Here, fact and values easily become entangled, which in turn challenges conceptions of autonomous science. How is the science-politics boundary constructed here? Since <b>ICES</b> <b>advice</b> constitutes the formal and highly important link between science and politics in fisheries, it offers a concrete location for studying boundary dynamics. Although this project mainly mobilizes Science and Technology Studies theory (in particular Actor Network Theory) it not only seeks to contribute to this literature, but considers how insights generated from such perspectives may contribute to the ongoing discourses on fisheries science and management. The thesis demonstrates that a comprehensive understanding of the construction, maintenance and transgression of the boundary between fisheries advisory science and management cannot be limited to studies of ‘boundary work’ as discursive practices; it also requires examinations of practices in scientific knowledge production, the material embodiment of this knowledge, its use in policy-making, and conditions on which its stability depends. Forms of uncertainty in ICES fisheries advice are explored and are demonstrated to challenge conceptions of a clear-cut science-politics boundary. The thesis proposes ways in which the science and politics of fisheries can be reconsidered by the development of a framework for enabling evaluations of fisheries management systems. This is expected to enhance communication across disciplines concerned with fisheries management, and to promote systemic learning...|$|E
40|$|The plans {{objectives}} are {{defined in terms}} of fishing mortality reductions. In the case that there is an accepted assessment (North Sea cod), it is evaluated if the fishing mortality has reduced as intended since the implementation of the plan. Exploitation rates were inspected using the latest assessment, and compared to the fishing mortal-ity in 2004 (2005 start of the implementation of the old cod recovery plan; EU 2004)) and 2008 (2009 start of the implementation of the new cod management plan; EU 2008)) respectively. In cases where no reliable fishing mortality estimate is available from analytical assessments (Kattegat Cod, Cod West of Scotland, Irish Sea cod), only proxies such as biomass trends were used to judge whether biomass is above biomass trigger levels as specified in the regulation. In addition to the biomass proxies, changes in the productivity and recruitment success were evaluated for all four stocks. In a second step, the focus was on the implementation details causing the deviations from the plan. In order to elucidate the source of the deviations from the plan, several analyses were carried out for the four stocks: Estimation of the difference between the TAC advice according to the plan based on the historic assessments and forecasts and the actual TAC decided by the council. It was elucidated what the TAC decided by the council implies in terms of predicted F and SSB developments according to the short term forecasts used as basis for advice and final decisions. For this purpose we analysed <b>ICES</b> <b>advice</b> option tables. If the TAC was in between two options presented, a linear interpolation was used. Analysis on whether the catches were limited by the TAC (which in effect only limits landings) as expected. To this end it was analysed how the proportionality between the different sources in the catch (discards, landings, unaccounted removals) changed over time.

There were 18 participants (of whom 2 participated by videocon-ference). The group was tasked with carrying out stock assessments and catch forecasts {{and providing a}} first draft of the <b>ICES</b> <b>advice</b> for 2014 for 16 stocks. 4 stocks were listed as “multiyear”. For those stocks, catch information was updated. For the remaining stocks, WGBIE had to finalise a draft advice prepared by WGNEW. Analytical assessments using age-structured models were conducted for {{the northern and southern}} stocks of megrim, the Bay of Biscay sole and nephrops stocks, whereas the two hake stocks and one southern stock of anglerfish were assessed using models that allow the use of only length-structured data (no age data). A surplus-production model, without age or length structure, was used to assess the second southern stocks of anglerfish. No analytical assessments have been provided for the northern stocks of anglerfish after 2006. This is mostly due to ageing problems and to an increase in dis-cards in recent years, {{for which there is no}} reliable data at the stock level. The state of stocks for which no analytical assessment could be performed was inferred from ex-amination of commercial LPUE or CPUE data and from survey information. Four stocks within the remit of the WG went through the benchmarking process in 2014. For the two southern megrim stocks, the inclusion of discards and some modifi-cations in the assessment model settings were carried out. For northern hake, the ret-rospective pattern issue which arose in last year’s assessment was partly addressed and for southern hake, convergence issues of the assessment model were investigated. Three nephrops stocks from the Bay of Biscay and the Iberian waters are scheduled for benchmark assessments at the start of 2015. The WGBIE meeting spent some time plan-ning this benchmark (see Annex N) together with longer term benchmarks (2016 and after, see section 1.). A recurrent issue significantly constrained the group’s ability to address the terms of reference this year. Despite an ICES datacall with a deadline of 4 weeks before the meeting, data for several stocks were only available at the start of the meeting which lead to increase in workload during the working group, as in that case, the assessments could not be carried out in National Laboratories prior to the meeting as mentioned in the ToRs.

Analytical assessments using age-structured models were conducted for the northern and southern stocks of megrim and the Bay of Biscay sole. The two hake stocks and one southern stock of anglerfish were assessed using models that allow the use of only length-structured data (no age data). A surplus-production model, without age or length structure, was used to assess the second southern stocks of anglerfish. No ana-lytical assessments have been provided for the northern stocks of anglerfish after 2006. This is mostly due to ageing problems and to an increase in discards in recent years, {{for which there is no}} reliable data at the stock level. The state of stocks for which no analytical assessment could be performed was inferred from examination of commer-cial LPUE or CPUE data and from survey information. Three nephrops stocks from the Bay of Biscay and the Iberian waters are scheduled for benchmark assessments in October 2016. The WGBIE meeting spent some time review-ing the progress towards the benchmark (see Annex 6) together with longer term benchmarks (2017 and after, see section 1.) for sea bass in the Bay of Biscay, all an-glerfish and hake stocks assessed by the WG. For the northern megrim stock, the sched-ule an inter-benchmark meeting was completed successfully and the group reviewed the outcome and accepted the category 1 update assessment. A recurrent issue significantly constrained the group’s ability to address the terms of reference this year. Despite an ICES data call with a deadline of six weeks before the meeting, data for several stocks were resubmitted during the meeting which lead to increased workloads during the working group, as in that case, the assessments could not be carried out in National Laboratories prior to the meeting as mentioned in the ToRs.

40|$|WKFRAME met for 4 days in late March {{to provide}} some {{technical}} guidelines to as-sist ICES expert groups {{in the implementation of}} the ICES MSY concept in advice for 2011. The workshop was attended by scientists from the ICES community, stake-holders from the fishing Industry and environmental interest groups, as well as rep-resentatives from one of ICES clients (EC). The primary area addressed by the group was to provide technical guidelines for the estimation of an exploitation rate based MSY target or if necessary a proxy, which should include; criteria for selection of proxies for Fmsy and criteria for advice when catch forecasts are not available. While the workshop focused on the technical issues related to defining Fmsy proxies, the dis-cussions touched on other issues related to the implementation of an MSY based ad-vice. These issues which include: the role of management plans in relation to MSY based advice, the function and definition of the Btrigger in the ICES implementation of an MSY advice, the definition of Fmsy as a target or limit reference point, and the in-clusion of estimation or implementation errors in the MSY target. The effects of multi species/predator prey interactions on Fmsy targets, requires further consideration. In relation to these issues, for the purposes of generating <b>ICES</b> <b>advice</b> for 2011, practical approaches are proposed by ACOM. With regard to the estimation of Fmsy proxies, the general approach advocated by WKFRAME is to explore the data through a range of methods with different assumptions, to identify the range of plausible candidates. The workshop suggested that EG¿s explore the sensitivity of the estimates of these candidates to uncertainty and assumptions in the model parameters, and finally, where possible, to check the response of the stock to fishing at any proposed target in the long term (through simulation). Technical guidelines in terms of methods, sensi-tivity analyses and things to look out for are detailed in chapter 2 of the report. With regard to the criteria for advice when there is no forecast; the workshop suggests that F advice in relation to putative Fmsy targets should be framed in terms of moving ex-ploitation rates towards the target, rather than specifying a harvest in relation to the current stock status and/or expected short term development of the stock. Thus ad-vice arising from circumstances where there is no short term forecast, has to be seen {{in the context of a}} ¿soft¿ evaluation of stock status relative to crudely estimated prox-ies. There are no new methods or techniques proposed in this report, and indeed the most basic equilibrium based methods are those used in the early years of fisheries science. The implementation of guidelines suggested in this report, require some de-gree of ¿expert judgement¿ and (in the cases of simulation) a caution against over interpretation of the results. This leads ultimately to a conclusion that the move to MSY based advice has to be seen as a stepwise process, which will require data ex-ploration and sensitivity analysis by the EG¿s, and a willingness from both ICES and its clients to work with recursively updated targets.

Several stocks, nine functional units for Nephrops {{and some of the}} new stocks from last year’s WG were listed as “biennial 2 nd year”. For those stocks, catch and abundance indices information was updated. In addition, three new stocks were also added to the terms of reference in 2013 (two stocks of sea bass and one stock of striped red mullet). Analytical assessments using age-structured models were conducted for the southern stocks of megrim and the Bay of Biscay sole, whereas the two hake stocks and one southern stock of anglerfish were assessed using models that allow the use of only length-structured data (no age data). A surplus-production model, without age or length structure, was used to assess the second southern stocks of anglerfish.

Both hake stocks and both southern megrim stocks are scheduled for benchmark assessments at the start of 2014. The WGHMM meeting spent some time planning this benchmark (see Annex N) together with longer term benchmarks (2015 and after, see section 1.). A recurrent issue significantly constrained the group’s ability to address the terms of reference this year.

40|$|Meta-analyses, {{applying}} generic methods {{within a}} species group, have benefits {{in terms of}} providing more stable estimates of FMSY reference points and estimates for individual stocks which by themselves may otherwise have insufficient data. Current <b>ICES</b> <b>advice</b> for seven sole stocks {{for which there is}} sufficient data gives Fmsy estimates which vary from 0. 16 to 0. 38, but these are specified for differing age ranges so are not directly comparable. Bpa is estimated for six of these seven stocks but Blim is available for only two. Slope at the origin estimates for HS models for the seven stocks vary from 1. 32, to 4. 45 largely due to observed exploitation rates. Here an evaluation using a consistent framework to compare Fmsy targets and the sensitivity of long term yield to the choice of this value across these stocks. Recruitment is modelled though stochastic multiple model based simulation for 1000 constructed ¿populations¿ for each stock by randomly sampling with replacement selection at age in the fishery, weights at age in the catch and weights at age in the stock for the period 2001 - 2009. S-R models were fitted in a Bayesian framework under the assumption is that sole has generic exploitation form which can be scaled to the carrying capacity for each stock, but the resilience, or slope (R/SSB) to the origin, is consistent across stocks assuming each stock retains its own estimated or assumed growth and maturation. Three models S-R models were applied, Hockey-stick, Ricker and Beverton- Holt with each model formulated so that the A parameter defined the slope to the origin which was assumed to be common for all stocks, whereas the B parameter related to density dependence was assumed to be independent. The probability of each model type is selected for the set using the method described in Simmonds et al (2011). Results show that changing from only HS to multiple models has a minor impact on the estimate of Fmsy or the F that maximizes mean catch, though the range of estimates is reduced. There is a small reduction in range through standardization of F bar over the same ages (3 - 8). A slightly larger reduction using mean selection at age in the fishery. The largest contribution comes from the different growth of the sole in different areas. In most cases if exploitation is at Fmsy there is less than 5 % probability of SSB being less than Blim, except for NS sole. For NS sole measurement error will have some impact on the results whereas for other stocks the influence is limited. The combined analysis (Table x 1) shows that the range of F within which catch is within 5 % of maximum catch is substantial. Only for Skagerrak-Kattegat sole is the target near the lower bound. For most stocks an F target (ages 3 - 8) of 0. 25 is a good choice. The new Blim and Bpa values are an important change, they are coherent with the simulations contribute to the impression of safe exploitation. However they need to be considered carefully before acceptance, this further analysis would be most appropriately conducted by individuals familiar with the stocks. The higher exploitation rates for Irish Sea and Skagerrak are conditional on the growth and this need to be verified, particularly for Skagerrak-Kattegat. JRC. DG. G. 4 -Maritime affair...|$|E

However the distribution of commercial catches should {{be interpreted with caution}} due to environmental factors, stock size, and quota/area limitations for the participating nations (some countries cannot fish in the different national EEZs). The WGMHSA assessment of the North-East Atlantic mackerel is currently dependent on a single fishery independent estimate of biomass, derived from the ICES Triennial Mackerel and Horse Mackerel Egg Surveys. This is only available once every three years and makes the assessment increasingly insecure with elapsed time since the last survey. However, the various annual research surveys by different countries have verified that there is an even wider distribution of mackerel than that indicated by the commercial fisheries. All surveys have the potential to deliver information on the distribution and abundance of mackerel. However, the surveys cover only part of the known distribution area and consequently {{have not been able to}} deliver a valid stock estimate or complete distribution map. The Planning Group on Aerial and Acoustic Surveys for Mackerel (PGAAM) was established during the WGMHSA meeting in September 2001 with the main purpose of coordinating a number of surveys on pelagic species that can provide the information on the distribution and abundance of mackerel (Section 1, 5, 6, 7, 8). The main objectives of PGAAM are to provide the distribution of mackerel and biomass/ number indices that may be used by WGMHSA in future assessments. Furthermore, it aims to collate information on the hydrographic and plankton conditions of the Norwegian Sea and adjacent waters to describe how feeding and migration of mackerel are influenced by this. The PGAAM met to coordinate vessels from appropriate countries which can collaborate with the Russian aerial surveys in the Norwegian Sea (Section 5), to coordinate Scottish and Norwegian acoustic surveys in the Viking Bank area (Section 6), to coordinate Spanish, Portuguese and French acoustic surveys (Section 7). Mackerel do not possess a swim bladder. As a result, they are poor reflectors of sound and have a low target strength (TS), so it’s very difficult to use the acoustic assessment. The PGAAM has tried to utilize the findings of the EU SIMFAMI project to provide tools to identify mackerel echo-traces (Section 2, 3) as well as to develop protocols and criteria to ensure standardisation of all sampling tools and survey gears (Section 4). The PGAAM made a list of the surveys in the North-East Atlantic not targeted at mackerel, but with the potential of collecting mackerel data to provide indices of mackerel abundance. Some surveys followed the PGAAM recommendations and collected data, and passed them to PGAAM (Section 8).

Check availability What {{is the relationship between}} science and politics? What should it be? How are their respective roles conceived and acted out in practice? Should science and politics be clearly separated? How? Are there cases in which they can be usefully mixed? What cases are those, and are there some ways of mixing that are better than others? This project explores such questions by examining relationships between ICES fisheries advice and decision-making in fisheries management. While traditional conceptions portray science as a rather autonomous entity, this case examines a context in which such conceptions are particularly prone to be challenged. First, scientific advice that forms direct inputs into policy-making is better characterized as ‘research’ or ‘mode- 2 science’ than as autonomous science. Second, advisory science on fisheries management is ‘post-normal’ insofar as its knowledge claims are uncertain, values disputed and decisions urgent. Here, fact and values easily become entangled, which in turn challenges conceptions of autonomous science. How is the science-politics boundary constructed here? Since <b>ICES</b> <b>advice</b> constitutes the formal and highly important link between science and politics in fisheries, it offers a concrete location for studying boundary dynamics. Although this project mainly mobilizes Science and Technology Studies theory (in particular Actor Network Theory) it not only seeks to contribute to this literature, but considers how insights generated from such perspectives may contribute to the ongoing discourses on fisheries science and management. The thesis demonstrates that a comprehensive understanding of the construction, maintenance and transgression of the boundary between fisheries advisory science and management cannot be limited to studies of ‘boundary work’ as discursive practices; it also requires examinations of practices in scientific knowledge production, the material embodiment of this knowledge, its use in policy-making, and conditions on which its stability depends. Forms of uncertainty in ICES fisheries advice are explored and are demonstrated to challenge conceptions of a clear-cut science-politics boundary. The thesis proposes ways in which the science and politics of fisheries can be reconsidered by the development of a framework for enabling evaluations of fisheries management systems. This is expected to enhance communication across disciplines concerned with fisheries management, and to promote systemic learning. Hva er forholdet mellom politikk og vitenskap? Med et utgangspunkt i Science and Technology Studies teori (primært ANT), undersøker jeg dette forhold i en case, nemlig forholdet mellom det Internasjonale Havforskningsråds (ICES) fiskerirådgivning og fiskeriforvaltning, der forestillingen om en uavhengig vitenskap er særlig utfordret. ICES vitenskap er ‘post normal’ for så vidt at kunnskapsgrunnlaget er usikkert, verdiene diskutable og beslutningene haster – en situasjon der verdier og fakta fort sammenfiltres. Jeg viser at en grundig forståelse av grenselinjene mellom rådgivende fiskeriforskning og politisk forvaltning krever en undersøkelse av vitenskapens metoder, hvordan de former politiske beslutningsprosesser, og hvilke antagelser de bygger på. Forskjellige former for usikkerhet i ICES rådgivning undersøkes og vises at utfordre forestillingen om en klar grense mellom politikk og vitenskap. Avhandlingen inviterer til refleksjon over politikk og vitenskap gjennom utviklingen av et rammeverk, som kan muliggjøre en systematisk evaluering av fiskeriforvaltningssystemer, og stimulere systematisk læring...|$|E
40|$|Quality {{control of}} data {{collections}} {{is an issue}} of primary importance in conducting science and this is no different for surveys intended to monitor changes in fish abundance. Essentially, quality control {{is the responsibility of the}} national institutes conducting the surveys. However, if the national data are combined in a common international data base, as is the case with DATRAS, the consistency of the data submitted engages an international dimension, because the reliability of any comprehensive analysis of changes in the fish community at large that could serve as the basis for <b>ICES</b> <b>advice</b> depends on the reliability of the species identifications in all national subsets. Many of the surveys that are routinely carried out jointly under the auspices of ICES have a long history during which the primary objectives have changed. Thus, the IBTS started as a Young Herring Survey, was then transformed in a Young Fish Survey to obtain recruitment estimates of commercial species, and became only a general monitoring survey of the entire fish community at a later stage. Despite these changes in general objectives, the emphasis in data use is still largely focused on the commercial species that are relatively easy to identify. Although measurement errors and punching errors for this group may have entered the data base, as evident from unrealistically small or large individuals reported in some cases, it seems generally safe to conclude that, in view of the large amount of detailed data collected for these species, these could lead only to minor and negligible distortions in the analyses. However, when it comes to the less common species, studies of the IBTS component in the past have proven major inconsistencies in species identification in the data set that has been entered in DATRAS. This problem is not restricted to a single or a few countries, but affects all countries, although the species involved may differ. This suggests that it is a direct consequence of the large number of people involved in data collection on board and of a generic lack of good taxonomic knowledge among the scientific staff at large that inhibits the maintenance of enough quality control. The problems identified in the past have been the direct reason for holding this one-off workshop to discuss the various aspects of identifying inconsistencies and correcting species identifications in historic data sets and of ensuring correct species identification in future data collections. Taxonomic quality control is a complex issue, because the problems vary by region depending on the species that may be encountered and therefore may require specific approaches regionally. Moreover, the ultimate responsibility for introducing specific protocols for quality control rests with the survey working groups responsible for data collection rather than that the appropriate procedures can be prescribed by others. Therefore, the aim of the workshop has been to provide generic guidelines for development of suitable protocols by the survey working groups rather than to come up with a final answer. It must be emphasized that so far progress in identifying inconsistencies in reporting of various taxa has been restricted to the IBTS component of DATRAS, which covers the North Sea, Skagerak and Kattegat. For all other surveys, similar analyses have not yet been conducted, but there is no reason to assume that the situation would be any different. Following the Terms of Reference, the report is split in four sections that deal with each of these respectively. Section 3 deals with ToR a) : “Identify and correct taxonomic mis-identifications and input errors in DATRAS”. Obviously, this ultimate goal was beyond reach during a three-day workshop, and a lot more work needs to be done. This section lists dubious species, inconsistent information provided regarding taxonomic level reported, maximum attainable size and area of distribution, and examples of inconsistent information reported for some problematic taxa. The information given is restricted to the IBTS component of DATRAS, but should not be interpreted as a comprehensive analysis of all inconsistencies that may be 2 | ICES WKTQD Report 2007 present in this data set. Rather, it highlights methodical aspects as to how inconsistencies may be elucidated. Section 4 deals with ToR b) : ”Development of protocols for ensuring the appropriate treatment of data reported at higher taxonomic levels”. Historically, different countries have reported variously species at different taxonomic levels (genus or families). Also, uncertain species records may have to be adjusted by using a higher taxonomic level. As a consequence, subsequent community analyses may require that these higher taxa are split into its constituting species based on identifications considered reliable. Because there are various ways to do such computations depending on the assumptions made, different analyses could give different answers. From an ICES perspective, some consistency in the approaches used by different working groups would seem appropriate. This section provides the essentials of an appropriate algorithm based on using length frequencies, area of distribution and year of catch, that could serve as a first guideline for comprehensive community analyses as well as for trend analysis of individual species. Section 5 deals with ToR c) : “Develop improved protocols to ensure that species identification in trawl surveys is appropriate for fish community studies, including the development of photo-ID keys for nations participating in surveys”. Various initiatives have been taken by individual countries to develop appropriate tools for species identification, including training courses. This section lists a number of ways by which future data collections may be improved or by which species identification can be ascertained at a later stage in the process. Finally, section 6 deals with ToR d). “Develop protocols for (i) improving quality control during the submission of data to DATRAS and (ii) the future checking and quality assurance of DATRAS data. This ToR relates to the important aspect of the responsibility of ICES for ensuring that all taxonomic data in DATRAS are correct or, if they are dubious but cannot be corrected, that the information provided to external users is properly identified as being of a dubious nature. The section describes a warning system that should be developed at the submission stage of new data so as to inform each country that the data submitted contain information that is inconsistent with what is known about the biology of the species and therefore should be carefully checked. It is also stressed that historic data that cannot be corrected but remain dubious are properly flagged internally and potentially adjusted when made available to external users. Proper taxonomic quality control will remain an issue of all monitoring programmes that needs continuous attention and adjustments. We can only hope that this comprehensive description of its many aspects helps the survey working groups to make real progress in achieving an urgently required revision of the historic information provided as well as in improving future data submission...|$|E
