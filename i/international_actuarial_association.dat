40|$|Although the {{financial}} professions {{have always been}} subject to public criticism, recent times have seen increasing challenges to the actuarial profession worldwide. To assist national <b>actuarial</b> <b>associations</b> {{to deal with these}} challenges, the authors present the concept of professionalization, which is that all occupations have an evolving number and quality of professional aspects. It is submitted that by sorting these aspects into cognitive, normative and organisational strands, national <b>actuarial</b> <b>associations</b> may decide rigorously, explicitly and consensually on the positioning of their professional mission. The authors argue further that, in order to achieve that mission, actuaries who are members of a national <b>actuarial</b> <b>association</b> must know, implement and review all the aspects of that mission. To this end, lifelong professional learning (as opposed to a single stand-alone professionalism course at the time of qualifying) must be a formal, planned aspect of an actuary’s education...|$|R

40|$|The {{quantification}} of {{longevity risk}} {{in a systematic}} way requires statistically sound forecasts of mortality rates and their corresponding uncertainty. <b>Actuarial</b> <b>associations</b> {{have a long history}} and continue {{to play an important role}} in the development, application and dispersion of mortality projections for the countries they represent. This paper gives an in depth presentation and discussion of the mortality projections as published by the Dutch (in 2014) and Belgian (in 2015) <b>actuarial</b> <b>associations.</b> The goal of these institutions was to publish a stochastic mortality projection model in line with both rigorous standards of state-of-the art academic work as well as the requirements of practical work such as robustness and transparency. Constructed by a team of authors from both academia and practice, the developed mortality projection standard is a Li & Lee type multi-population model. To project mortality, a global Western European trend and a country-specific deviation from this trend are jointly modelled with a bivariate time series model. We motivate and document all choices made in the model specification, calibration and forecasting process as well as the model selection strategy. We show the model fit and mortality projections and illustrate the use of the model in several pension-related applications. status: publishe...|$|R
