500|$|In {{her last}} race of 2015, {{she won the}} Zenyatta Stakes for the third time, {{stalking}} the pace until taking {{the lead in the}} homestretch, winning in a field of eight by [...] lengths. [...] As she prepared for her next race, the 2015 Breeders' Cup Classic, the biggest challenge was anticipated to be her reaction to travel; she had only raced twice outside of California, losing both times, and was known to be a poor shipper. [...] With the 2015 Breeders' Cup races held at Keeneland, and weather causing difficulties for shipping horses by air, Mandella nonetheless declared, [...] "We plan to run in the big one." [...] She shipped to Keeneland on October 19 and developed a slight fever shortly after arrival, thought due to shipping stress, but the fever dropped following treatment and she continued to prep for the race. [...] But on the morning of 29 October, Beholder was sent out for a gallop at the Keeneland training track, and examination after the race revealed that she had bled. [...] She was scratched from the Classic. Mandella explained, [...] "there's obviously some irritated lung tissue there. She will be fine, but <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> her under the pressure of a race situation, it could cause some real damage. This was obviously due to the fever she had when she arrived".|$|E
2500|$|Further {{evidence}} of John's political development {{is found in}} a letter of October 1842, to his friend John Martin, responding to Martin's sending him a copy of The Nation: [...] "I think The Nation will do very well"; and again in October, on the arrival of 20,000 additional troops in Ireland: [...] "How {{do you think the}} country will take all this?" [...] he asks, [...] "I think I know how it ought to take it; but <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> it on paper, you might inform the Attorney-General, and get me arrested." ...|$|E
2500|$|Beck {{acknowledged}} {{the impact of}} folk on the song, saying [...] "I'd realized {{that a lot of}} what folk music is about taking a tradition and reflecting your own time. I knew my folk music would take off, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> hip-hop beats behind it." [...] He had also perceived similarities between Delta blues and hip hop, which helped to inspire the song. The A.V. Club's Annie Zaleski opines that the song imitates abstract hip hop, while James Reed from The Boston Globe called it an alternative rock anthem, and Veronica Chambers for Vibe magazine described the song as a [...] "folk-based hip hop song." [...] "Loser" [...] revolves around several recurring musical elements: a slide guitar riff, Stephenson's sitar, the bassline, and a tremolo guitar part. The song's drum track is sampled from a Johnny Jenkins cover of Dr. John's [...] "I Walk on Gilded Splinters" [...] from the 1970 album Ton-Ton Macoute!. During the song's break, there is a sample of a line of dialogue from the 1994 Steve Hanft-directed film Kill the Moonlight, which goes [...] "I’m a driver/I’m a winner/Things are gonna change, I can feel it". Hanft and Beck were friends, and Hanft would go on to direct several music videos for Beck, including the video for [...] "Loser".|$|E

2500|$|From 1953 to 1955 {{he went to}} sea as Commander Cruisers-Destroyers, Pacific, {{where his}} career was stalled {{temporarily}} by Secretary of the Navy Charles S. Thomas. Chief of Naval Operations Robert B. Carney was selecting members of an upcoming promotion board and picked Curts for his skill and contacts {{in the fields of}} electronics and communications. However, [...] "Mr. Thomas vetoed [...] when I brought the slate in, and said that he didn't want him around Washington. I couldn't get from him any expression of reason as to this prejudice, but it was perfectly obvious that I couldn't bring [...] back. It was also perfectly obvious that I'd better not nominate him for three stars, which I had planned to do...But about a year later, I was looking for a replacement in the Second Fleet, and I brought in a nomination. Thomas said that he wasn't particularly impressed with the person I was suggesting and said {{it seemed to him that}} I'd do better <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> someone like [...] in." [...] Queried as to his change of heart, Thomas initially denied ever having vetoed Curts, then, when pressed by an incredulous Carney, [...] "finally said he couldn't understand why he had done it, except that somebody must have told him something." [...] Carney immediately nominated Curts for his third star.|$|E

6000|$|She answered, 'No mortal is able {{entirely to}} {{understand}} {{the power of this}} ring, because no one thoroughly understands the secret signs engraved upon it. But even with my half-knowledge I can work great wonders. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> the ring upon the little finger of my left hand, then I can fly like a bird through the air wherever I wish to go. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> it on the third finger of my left hand I am invisible, and I can see everything that passes around me, though no one can see me. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> the ring upon the middle finger of my left hand, then neither fire nor water nor any sharp weapon can hurt me. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> it on the forefinger of my left hand, then I can with its help produce whatever I wish. I can in a single moment build houses or anything I desire. Finally, as long as I wear the ring on the thumb of my left hand, that hand is so strong that it can break down rocks and walls. Besides these, the ring has other secret signs which, as I said, no one can understand. No doubt it contains secrets of great importance. The ring formerly belonged to King Solomon, the wisest of kings, during whose reign the wisest men lived. But it is not known whether this ring was ever made by mortal hands: it is supposed that an angel gave it to the wise King.' ...|$|E
