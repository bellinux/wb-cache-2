Thus, an adverse shock to a firm’s net worth (say an initial decline in the asset prices) deteriorates its balance sheet through limiting its borrowing and triggers a series of falling asset prices, <b>falling</b> <b>net</b> worth, deteriorating balance sheets, falling borrowing (thus investment) and falling output.

40|$|Abstract. In late 1999 Artisanal Fisherman Association in Thailand {{requested}} {{the government to}} take actions in curbing destructive anchovy fishing gears. They believed that anchovy fishing was {{the main cause of}} fishery resource depletion in their fishing grounds. Main anchovy fishing gears were light luring <b>falling</b> <b>net,</b> purse seine, and scoop net. All of them are Juvenile bycatch varied from 1. 72 – 30. 37 % of total catches depending on gear type, vessel size, fishing ground, fishing month, and fishing year. Economic losses of juvenile bycatch were $ 1 – 331 /boat/trip. In Songkhla, the crisis problem area, economic losses from light luring <b>falling</b> <b>net</b> were as high as 0. 42 – 7. 64 times of the return from anchovy. The losses from light luring anchovy purse seine were 23 – 35 % of the return from anchovy. The losses from light luring scoop net varied around 2 – 7 %. Anchovy catch values in Thailand was $ 26 million in 1997. Value added from processing was $ 65 million, mainly from fish sauce. In spite of low value added, 59 % of the catches were processed as boiled-dried/dried anchovy mainly for export. 44 % of the anchovy value in the importing country were the trade margins, including tax, in importing country. Fishing cost was 20 %. This cost estimation did not include the economic loss from juvenile bycatch. Processing and marketing costs in Thailand amounted to 19 %. Profit margins for domestic fishermen, processors and traders added up to 17 %. Thailand might have been exporting anchovy at an underpaid resource value. The relatively better return from anchovy had led to rapid increase in anchovy fishing effort. If fishing effort exceeded carrying capacity especially in habitats of juvenile economic species, it could lead to decrease in fishing income due to resource depletion not only for artisanal fishermen but anchovy fishermen as well.

40|$|The {{influence}} of planting date on <b>fall</b> and spring <b>net</b> blotch epidemics (caused by Pyrenophora teres) was evaluated with the winter barley cultivar Pennrad.

The three planting dates evaluated corresponded to the recommended date as well as dates I wk earlier and later than recommended for each specific location. Planting date had a significant influence on <b>fall</b> <b>net</b> blotch epidemics, with the greatest and least disease severities observed in the earliest and latest plantings, respectively. When spring environmental conditions were warm and humid, previous differences in disease severities attributable to date were eliminated. With less favorable spring weather, planting date had a significant influence on spring net blotch severities. Planting date also affected yield components, specifically the number of seeds per head and the thousand-kernel weight and the calculated yield. The greatest values for these factors generally were observed for the latest planting. Applications of fungicides during the spring epidemics generally resulted in {{a significant decrease in}} disease severity and an increase in one or more yield components. Planting in mid- to late September at either location resulted in the lowest net blotch severities and greatest yields...|$|R

We develop an explicitly spatial model of how transport costs and corruption can affect natural resource exploitation. We then test its implications using a unique dataset on trucker bribe payments on the major trucking routes of West Africa. These data allow us to estimate the effects of transport and corruption costs across three export market sectors: onions, shea nuts, and cashews. Results suggest that when net returns are suppressed by transport and corruption costs, investment in natural resource products is postponed or forsaken entirely, yields <b>fall,</b> <b>net</b> returns suffer, and farmers are caught in a cycle of falling productivity, reduced critical mass of tradable production, and perhaps even higher costs to arrange shipments. 1 This work has benefited from discussions with Macki Cissoko, Vieux Coulibaly, Daou Ali Hamadoun...|$|R

The Mekong Basin covers six countries, the River rises in China, but there are substantial downstream tributaries from Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam, and from a small area in Myanmar. A unique feature is the reverse flow from the Mekong to the Tonle Sap via the Tonle Sap River {{at the height of the}} wet season flow and its ebb as the river levels <b>fall.</b> <b>Net</b> runoff is about 37 % of total precipitation. Forest and woodland cover 43 % of the basin and use about 33 % of the precipitation. Grassland covers much of the upper part of the Basin, consuming about 6 % of the precipitation. Irrigated agriculture covers just 6 % of the Basin and uses about 6 % of the water (excluding runoff). Climate change, using an assumed change in rainfall distribution, shows that with the expected shorter and more intense rainy season, and longer and more intense dry season, both floods and seasonal water shortages may be exacerbated.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Due to {{changing}} macro and micro factors, expiring patents and <b>falling</b> <b>net</b> income, pharmaceutical companies {{need to rethink}} their vertical business model. The trend shows cross-sectorial partnerships and consolidation to remain and compete on the market. Areas covered: Quantitative research interviewing a target group of 25 key executives from small, mid and large global pharmaceutical companies rounded with qualitative literature research completing the analysis. Expert commentary: Uncertainty in the industry due {{to changing}} external factors i. e. pricing pressures, regulations or an economic slowdown, slowing down innovations and new drug outcomes. Pharmaceutical companies understand the existing hurdles, and are critically optimistic implementing new business models. Also, various stakeholders {{are included in the}} value chain due to their growing importance. CONCLUSION: During the next years, the industry will be restructured from volume towards value, and only pharmaceutical companies' clairaudient and reciprocate to the changes with an out-off the box thinking will be able to resist on the market. Small biotech companies should focus on research, and big pharmaceutical companies entering at development focusing on the process until the distribution. This execution business recommendation would enable the best know-how at the right point, mitigating the risk and enhancing the patient outcomes. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The authors analyze how foreign entry {{affected}} domestic {{banks in}} Argentina during an especially intense period of {{entry in the}} mid- 1990 s. Their {{results are consistent with}} the hypothesis that foreign banks enter areas where they have a competitive advantage, putting pressure on the domestic banks already focused on that type of lending. They find that domestic banks with loan portfolios concentrated in manufacturing - an area to which foreign banks have traditionally devoted much of their lending - tended to have lower net margins and lower before-tax profits than other domestic banks. The informational advantages local banks enjoyed probably helped ensure that foreign banks would not drive them from the market. Domestic banks with greater consumer lending - an area in which foreign banks have not been heavily involved - had higher net margins and greater before-tax profits. Domestic banks that focused on mortgage lending - an area foreign banks entered aggressively in the mid- 1990 s - experienced <b>falling</b> <b>net</b> margins and increasing overhead. There were many domestic bank failures in the mid- 1990 s, but the banks that failed were not heavily concentrated in the types of lending favored by foreign banks.

The results suggest that the economic crisis has had a negative direct impact on tourism in the UK of around � 42 million, although this was the relatively small difference between a large increase in domestic holiday tourism and falls in business and visiting family, friends and relatives spending. In turn, this led to a negative indirect impact of � 45 million, representing a � 21 million <b>net</b> <b>fall</b> across the production chain and a � 24 million <b>net</b> <b>fall</b> in the compensation of employees.
