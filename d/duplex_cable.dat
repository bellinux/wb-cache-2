As {{part of the}} venture, NEC provided cable manufacturing equipment to Sumitomo Densen. Rights to Western Electrics <b>duplex</b> <b>cable</b> patents were also transferred to Sumitomo Densen.|$|E
5000|$|The Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962 {{showed the}} need for direct, timely, and private {{communications}} between {{the leaders of the}} world’s two superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union. A <b>duplex</b> <b>cable</b> circuit (later augmented by a satellite hookup) between the two capitals known as the Moscow-Washington hotline or [...] "Red Telephone", became operational August 30, 1963. Program management and engineering for the “Hotline” was assigned to DCA. The system continues intact today with direct links to more than 40 foreign leaders. Another direct result of the Cuban Missile Crisis was the creation of the Worldwide Military Command and Control System (WWMCCS) to enable national command authorities to exercise effective command and control of their widely dispersed forces.|$|E

50|$|The Fibre Channel {{physical}} layer {{is based on}} serial connections that use corresponding modules. The small form-factor pluggable transceiver (SFP) module and its enhanced version SFP+ are common form factors for ports, supporting a variety of distances via multi-mode and single-mode fiber {{as shown in the}} table below. The SFP module uses <b>duplex</b> fiber <b>cabling</b> that has LC connectors.|$|R
5000|$|Hannes Marker felt {{he could}} improve on the concept, and in 1953 he {{introduced}} the [...] "Duplex" [...] toe. The Duplex used two small wedge-shaped metal clips that fit over the toe of the boot's sole, holding it down, and used a spring {{in order to keep}} the boot centred. During a fall, the clips could be forced outward against their centring springs, allowing it to release the toe. Like the Nevada, the <b>Duplex</b> used a <b>cable</b> binding for the heel.|$|R
