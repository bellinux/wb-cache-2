25|$|Unlike ferromagnets, paramagnets do not retain any {{magnetization}} in {{the absence}} of an externally applied magnetic field because thermal motion randomizes the spin orientations. (Some paramagnetic materials retain spin disorder even at absolute zero, meaning they are paramagnetic in the ground state, i.e. {{in the absence}} of thermal motion.) Thus the total magnetization drops to zero when the applied field is removed. Even in the presence of the field there is only a small <b>induced</b> <b>magnetization</b> because only a small fraction of the spins will be oriented by the field. This fraction is proportional to the field strength and this explains the linear dependency. The attraction experienced by ferromagnetic materials is non-linear and much stronger, so that it is easily observed, for instance, in the attraction between a refrigerator magnet and the iron of the refrigerator itself.|$|E

The complexity of the method presented is comparable to that of solving the linear heat equation with the Backward Euler method. To illustrate the procedure, we carry out three dimensional simulations of the magnetization reversal process in a magnetic multilayer when a current flows perpendicular to the layers.

50|$|The {{source of}} {{deviation}} could {{not always be}} identified. To reduce this source of error, which was due to <b>induced</b> <b>magnetization</b> in the ship, the surveyor John Churchman proposed a solution known as swinging the ship in 1794.

40|$|Recently it {{has been}} {{predicted}} that a spin-polarized electrical current perpendicular-to-plane (CPP) directly flowing through a magnetic element can <b>induce</b> <b>magnetization</b> switching through spin-momentum transfer. In this letter, the first observation of current-induced magnetization switching (CIMS) in exchange-biased spin-valves (ESPVs) at room temperature is reported. The ESPVs show the CIMS behavior under a sweeping dc current with a very high critical current density. It is demonstrated that a thin Ruthenium (Ru) layer inserted between a free layer and a top electrode effectively reduces the critical current densities for the CIMS.

Paramagnetic materials are attracted to magnetic fields, hence have a relative magnetic permeability greater than one (or, equivalently, a positive magnetic susceptibility).The magnetic moment induced by the applied field is linear in the field strength and rather weak. It typically requires a sensitive analytical balance to detect the effect. Unlike ferromagnets, paramagnets do not retain any magnetization {{in the absence of an}} externally applied magnetic field, because thermal motion causes the spins to become randomly oriented without it. Thus the total magnetization will drop to zero when the applied field is removed.

5000|$|The Vine-Matthews {{hypothesis}} correlates the symmetric magnetic patterns seen on {{the seafloor}} with geomagnetic field reversals. At mid-ocean ridges, new crust is created by the injection, extrusion, and solidification of magma. After the magma has cooled through the Curie point, ferromagnetism becomes possible and the magnetic minerals in the newly formed crust orient themselves with the current background geomagnetic field. Lithospheric creation at the ridge is considered continuous and symmetrical as the new crust pushes the old crust laterally and equally {{on either side of}} the ridge. Therefore, as geomagnetic reversal occur, the crust {{on either side of the}} ridge will contain a record of remnant magnetizations of normal or reversed magnetizations in comparison to the current geomagnetic field. The ridge crest is analogous to “twin-headed tape recorder”, recording the Earth’s magnetic history.The intensity of the remnant magnetization is greater than the <b>induced</b> <b>magnetization.</b> The shape of the magnetic anomaly is controlled by the combination of the orientation of its total magnetization, the summation of the <b>induced</b> <b>magnetization</b> and remnant magnetization. Consequently, the shape of the magnetic anomaly is controlled predominately by the primary remnant vector. Blocks of crust at high latitudes have magnetic vectors that dip steeply downward in a normal magnetic field. However, close to the magnetic south pole, the magnetic vectors dip steeply downward in a reversed magnetic field and inclined steeply upwards in a normal magnetic field. There are positive magnetic anomalies over normally magnetized blocks and negative anomalies over reversed blocks. Local anomalies with a short period also exist, but are considered to be correlated with bathymetry. [...] In low latitudes, the vectors are shallowly dipping and dipolar. This confuses the positive and negative anomalies. At the magnetic equator, the magnetic field is horizontal; negative anomalies are related to normally magnetized blocks and positive anomalies with reversed. The amplitude of the anomaly, magnetic field strength, and the magnitude of the remanence all decrease from the poles to the equator.The orientation of the ridge affects the anomaly shape and amplitude. The component of the vector that effects the anomaly is at a maximum when the ridge is east-west and the magnetic profile is north-south. The anomalies are most apparent at high magnetic latitudes, north-south trending ridges at all latitudes, and east-west trending ridges at the magnetic equator.|$|E

A well-resolved doublet of sharp dichroic lines was observed when the magnetic field induced ferromagnetic alignment of the spins in the crystal lattice. In contrast, at zero magnetic field only a broad and featureless absorption onset is seen. These results are fully explained in terms of a model of electronic transitions between localized states at the Eu lattice site and a tight-binding conduction band, which incorporates the formation of spin domains.

In Pt|Co|AlO_x, we demonstrate that the domain walls move {{in response to a}} novel relativistic dissipative torque that is dependent on the domain wall structure and that can be controlled via the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Unlike the non-relativistic spin-transfer torque, the new torque can, together with the spin-Hall effect in the Pt-layer, move domain walls by means of electric currents parallel to the walls.

30|$|Graded {{anisotropy}} {{magnetic materials}} possess a coercive field changing laterally with position. A simple fabrication procedure to produce such an anisotropy gradient in a polycrystalline Au/Co layer system without lateral thickness variation and with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, prototypical {{for a large}} variety of thin film systems, is shown. The procedure uses light-ion bombardment {{without the use of}} a mask. Magnetization reversal in this polycrystalline layer system takes place by unidirectional movement of a single domain wall only in regions with larger anisotropies and anisotropy gradients. In this anisotropy/anisotropy gradient regime, the domain wall is oriented perpendicular to the coercive field gradient, and it can be positioned along the gradient by an appropriate magnetic field pulse. For smaller anisotropies/anisotropy gradients, the natural anisotropy fluctuations of the polycrystalline layer system <b>induce</b> <b>magnetization</b> reversal dominated by domain nucleation.|$|R

We show that the critical AC spin current is significantly smaller than the corresponding DC one. The effect is understood {{as a consequence of}} the underdamped nature of the spin-torque oscillators. It allows to use the kinetic inertia to overcome the residual energy barrier, rather than suppressing the latter by a large spin current. The effect is similar to a swing which may be set into high amplitude motion by a weak near-resonant push. The optimal AC frequency is identified as the upper bifurcation frequency of the corresponding driven nonlinear oscillator. Together with fast switching times it makes the perpendicular AC method to be the most efficient way to realize spin-torque memory valve. Comment: 8 pages, 11 figure...|$|R

Inversions using spherical harmonic coefficients are considered along with the inversion of residual fields. In order to perform the correct operation, it is necessary to add on to the source function produced by the inversion process a magnetization function which has no external field. Such a function is known as an annihilator. The use of the annihilator for Pacific Ocean anomalies is discussed.
