'She is his, by our laws; and what the laws of the red-man say, the red-man must do. When the warrior is about to be tormented, and he asks for time to go home and see his friends, does he not come back at the day and hour agreed on? Shall I, Susquesus, the first chief of the Onondagoes, be {{stronger}} than the law? No--my face would be forever hid in the bushes, <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>come</b> to pass. It should not be--it shall not be. Take her, Waterfowl; she is yours. Deal kindly by her, for she is as tender as the wren when it first quits the nest. I must go into the woods for awhile.

6000|$|This young lady, being motherless and poor, was apprenticed at the school--taught for nothing--teaching others {{what she}} learnt, for nothing--boarded for nothing--lodged for nothing--and set down and rated as {{something}} immeasurably less than nothing, {{by all the}} dwellers in the house. The servant-maids felt her inferiority, for they were better treated; free to come and go, and regarded in their stations with much more respect. The teachers were infinitely superior, for they had paid {{to go to school}} in their time, and were paid now. The pupils cared little for a companion who had no grand stories to tell about home; no friends to come with post-horses, and be received in all humility, with cake and wine, by the governess; no deferential servant to attend and bear her home for the holidays; nothing genteel to talk about, and nothing to display. But why was Miss Monflathers always vexed and irritated with the poor apprentice--how <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>come</b> to pass? ...|$|E
6000|$|It was {{the first}} time he had been in the room, and on the chimney-piece stood open a miniature-case {{containing}} a portrait, by Thorburn, of my little brother Percy, in loose brown holland. Harold started as he came in, and exclaimed, [...] "Where <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>come</b> from?" [...] I told him, and he exclaimed, [...] "Shut it up, please," [...] and sat down with his back to it, resigning his hand to me, and thanking me warmly when the fomentation brought some relief, and when I asked if I could do any more for him he seemed undecided, extracted some letters from his pocket with his two-fifths of a hand, and sent Dora to his room for his writing-case. I offered to write anything for him, but he said, [...] "Let me try," [...] and then endeavoured; but he found that not only did the effort hurt him unbearably, but that he could not guide the pen for more than a word or two; so he consented to make use of me, saying, however, [...] "Dora, it is no use your staying in; you had better go out." ...|$|E
6000|$|We {{have been}} reading the history of Adam's fall. With that fall we have all to do; for we all feel the fruits {{of it in the}} sinful corruptions which we bring into the world with us. And more, every fall which we have is like Adam's fall: every time we fall into wilful sin, we do what Adam did, and act over again, each of us many times in our lives, that which he first acted in the garden of Paradise. At least, all mankind suffer for something. Look at the sickness, death, bloodshed, oppression, spite, and cruelty, with which the world is so full now, of which it has been full, as we know but too well from history, ever since Adam's time. The world is full of misery, there is no denying that. How <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>come?</b> It must have come somehow. There must be some reason for all this sorrow. The Bible tells us a reason for it. If anyone does not like the Bible reason, he is bound to find a better reason. But what if the Bible reason, the story of Adam's fall, be the only {{rational}} and sensible explanation which ever has been, or ever will be given, {{of the way in which}} death and misery came among men? ...|$|E

6000|$|They {{went into}} the parlour my mother had come from, {{the fire in the}} best room {{on the other side of}} the passage not being lighted--not having been lighted, indeed, since my father's funeral; and when they were both seated, and Miss Betsey said nothing, my mother, after vainly trying to {{restrain}} herself, began to cry. 'Oh tut, tut, tut!' said Miss Betsey, in a hurry. 'Don't <b>do</b> <b>that!</b> <b>Come,</b> come!' ...|$|R

5000|$|In an {{interview}} in 2011, Hart said, [...] "Well, when I wrote that book I {{was looking for the}} origins of percussion. So by writing that book I kept going back, you know? To the Mongols of the 11th century. Then I went back to the caves, and then the Neolithic, then the Paleolithic, and then when I reached the point where drums first started to appear, I thought, well, okay, where <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>come</b> from?

5000|$|... "Bridge over Troubled Water" [...] was {{composed}} by Paul Simon very quickly, {{so much so}} that he asked himself, [...] "Where <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>come</b> from? It doesn't seem like me." [...] The chorus lyrics were partly inspired by Claude Jeter's line [...] "I'll be your bridge over deep water if you trust in me," [...] which Jeter sang with his group, the Swan Silvertones, in the 1958 song [...] "Mary Don't You Weep." [...] According to gospel producer and historian Anthony Heilbut, Simon later acknowledged his musical debt to Jeter in person, and additionally handed Jeter a check as compensation. [...] Simon wrote the song initially on guitar but decided to transpose it to the piano, to both better reflect the gospel influence and to suit Garfunkel's voice.|$|E

5000|$|In late 2014, Harley {{received}} a speeding fine of £1,000, and six points on his licence, after being caught by a speed camera doing 70 {{miles per hour}} on the M25 in Kent, {{in an area where}} the limit had been temporarily reduced to 40 mph. In January 2015, this incident was discussed on the BBC television series Top Gear. The show's presenters Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May urged viewers to download the song in a bid to help him pay the fine. Clarkson had commented, [...] "He's making a meagre living out of, let's be honest, one hit single. Everybody loves that song - you can't trust someone who doesn't like that song." [...] Hammond added, [...] "Imagine if everybody did it - he would wake up tomorrow and think 'I'm number one, where <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>come</b> from?' It would cheer him up." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Learning {{those songs}} {{did a lot}} of {{positive}} things", Mellencamp explained to Creem writer Bill Holdship. [...] "We realized more than ever what a big melting pot of all different types of music the '60s were. Take an old Rascals song for example - there's everything from marching band beats to soul music to country sounds in one song. Learning those opened the band's vision to try new things on my songs. It wasn't let's go back and try to make this part fit into my song, but I wanted to capture the same feeling - the way those songs used to make you feel. After a while, we didn't even have to talk about it anymore. If you listen to the lead Larry Crane plays on 'Face of the Nation,' he never would have played that 'cause he didn't really know who the Animals were. He's young, and he grew up on Grand Funk Railroad. You hear it, and it's like 'where <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>come</b> from?' It had to be from hearing those old records." ...|$|E
5000|$|... Bob Cianci: Lonnie Mack played bass on that track, didn’t he? How <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>come</b> together?- Robby Krieger: Lonnie {{had quit}} the music {{business}} and was actually working for Elektra Records doing something. I know he sold Bibles for a while too. He was around the studio when we {{were getting ready to}} record “Roadhouse Blues,” so we asked him to play bass. He did a great job, and got back into music after that.- Bob Cianci: The Doors always used bass players in the studio, didn’t they? - Robby Krieger: Yes. Ray and I used to write the bass parts. On the first album, we used Larry Knechtel, the session guy. He passed away recently. On the second and third albums, we used Doug Lubahn from the band Clear Light. On the fourth, Harvey Brooks played bass, and we used Ray Neapolitan (on Morrison Hotel) and Jerry Scheff (on L.A. Woman) on the fifth and sixth albums. Jerry is probably best known for having played in Elvis’s band for years. Robbie Krieger ...|$|E

60|$|How <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>come</b> to pass? <b>Does</b> {{a volcano}} make {{earthquakes}}? No; we may rather say that earthquakes {{are trying to}} make volcanos. For volcanos are the holes which the steam underground has burst open that it may escape into the air above. They are the chimneys of the great blast-furnaces underground, in which Madam How pounds and melts up the old rocks, to make them into new ones, and spread them out over the land above.|$|R
