5|$|In match race mode, {{the player}} competes {{in a series}} of races against AI-controlled snowboarders. The game times the player {{throughout}} the level and players receive a damage meter which fills if the snowboarder falls down or is knocked over. The difficulty level in match races can be set to easy, medium, or hard, adjusting the complexity and number of races. If the player <b>fails</b> <b>at</b> defeating an AI competitor, they must retire. The player is given three chances to beat the computer before the game is over.|$|E
5|$|When Devon Banks, the Vice President of West Coast News, Web Content, and Theme Park Talent Relations {{visits from}} Los Angeles, Jack fears {{that he is}} trying to take his job. After having his {{assistant}} Jonathan spy on Banks, he learns that Banks is gay and that he is interested in Kenneth. Jack sends Kenneth to try to gather information on what Banks is planning to do, but Kenneth is inept and <b>fails</b> <b>at</b> the task. Jack then enlists Liz to help him come up with some ideas so that he can impress the network and win the power coup over Banks. Jack sends Kenneth to seduce Banks again so that he will be late for the important meeting, but Banks sees through the plan and arrives at the meeting anyway.|$|E
5|$|Beta: Arc Light of the Point of Infinity follows Mayuri, and {{is set in}} {{the beta}} attractor field, after Daru's future daughter, Suzuha Amane, brought Okabe back in time to save Kurisu; this is {{necessary}} to avoid a world line where Kurisu's time travel theories are stolen, resulting in an arms race leading up to World War III. Okabe <b>fails</b> <b>at</b> first, as world line convergence appears to make Kurisu's death inevitable; Suzuha is about to make him try one more time, but Mayuri stops her, as she thinks Okabe has suffered enough. Suzuha does not go back to the time she came from, still intending to get Okabe to try once more, but notes that {{due to a lack of}} fuel, the time machine will no longer be able to go back far enough after less than a year has passed. After that time is nearly up, Suzuha gets ready to travel back in time and try saving Kurisu herself, but Mayuri follows along. They arrive just after the past Suzuha and Okabe left to save Kurisu for the first time, and Mayuri tells her past self that she needs to get Okabe to try again. The scene from the beginning plays out again, but Mayuri slaps Okabe and tells him that he is not the type to give up. The future Mayuri and Suzuha leave before the past Okabe and Suzuha return, with too little fuel to be able to tell where they will end up.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the main}} {{strategies}} for avoiding problems (1) and (2) has been to use minute compounds that can mimic the effects of transcription factors.

They also avoid the problem of genomic integration, which in some cases contributes to tumor genesis.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Tensile, Torsion, and Hardness {{behavior}} of welded and un-welded Aluminium Alloy 6061 T 6 were investigated. Tests {{were conducted to}} evaluate the impact of tungsten Gas Arc welding (TIG) {{on some of the}} mechanical properties of the alloy. Different zones with different mechanical properties were created {{as a result of the}} welding process. Welding was found to have enormous impact on the tensile, torsion, and hardness properties of the alloy. Welded tensile specimens were <b>failed</b> <b>at</b> the welded area whereas not welded ones were <b>failed</b> <b>at</b> the centre. Welded torsion specimens were <b>failed</b> <b>at</b> the HAZ but not welded ones <b>failed</b> <b>at</b> the centre. The hardness of HAZ was decreased as a result of the heat generated during the welding process. Hardness values were increased as we moved away from the welded region...|$|R
50|$|Mean {{time between}} {{failures}} (MTBF) describes the expected time between two failures for a repairable system, while {{mean time to failure}} (MTTF) denotes the expected time to failure for a non-repairable system. For example, three identical systems starting to function properly at time 0 are working until all of them fail. The first system <b>failed</b> <b>at</b> 100 hours, the second <b>failed</b> <b>at</b> 120 hours and the third <b>failed</b> <b>at</b> 130 hours. The MTBF of the system is the average of the three failure times, which is 116.667 hours. If the systems are non-repairable, then their MTTF would be 116.667 hours.|$|R

25|$|This {{equation}} is correct {{to a much}} wider temperature range, but still depends on the approximation of heat capacity ratio being independent of temperature, {{and for this reason}} will fail, particularly at higher temperatures. It gives good predictions in relatively dry, cold, low pressure conditions, such as the Earth's stratosphere. The equation <b>fails</b> <b>at</b> extremely low pressures and short wavelengths, due to dependence {{on the assumption that the}} wavelength of the sound in the gas is much longer than the average mean free path between gas molecule collisions. A derivation of these equations will be given in the following section.|$|E
25|$|In {{the decades}} after the {{discovery}} of general relativity, it was realized that general relativity is incompatible with quantum mechanics. It is possible to describe gravity {{in the framework of}} quantum field theory like the other fundamental forces, such that the attractive force of gravity arises due to exchange of virtual gravitons, {{in the same way as}} the electromagnetic force arises from exchange of virtual photons. This reproduces general relativity in the classical limit. However, this approach <b>fails</b> <b>at</b> short distances of the order of the Planck length, where a more complete theory of quantum gravity (or a new approach to quantum mechanics) is required.|$|E

25|$|Several {{decades after}} the {{discovery}} of general relativity it was realized that it cannot be the complete theory of gravity because it is incompatible with quantum mechanics. Later it was understood {{that it is possible}} to describe gravity in the framework of quantum field theory like the other fundamental forces. In this framework the attractive force of gravity arises due to exchange of virtual gravitons, in the same way as the electromagnetic force arises from exchange of virtual photons. This reproduces general relativity in the classical limit, but only at the linearized level and postulating that the conditions for the applicability of Ehrenfest theorem holds, which is not always the case. Besides, this approach <b>fails</b> <b>at</b> short distances of the order of the Planck length.|$|E
25|$|In a {{language}} with lazy evaluation, like Haskell, a list is evaluated {{only to the}} degree that its elements are requested: for example, if one asks for the first element of a list, only the first element will be computed. With respect to usage of the list monad for non-deterministic computation that means that we can non-deterministically generate a lazy list of all results of the computation and ask for the first of them, and only as much work will be performed as is needed to get that first result. The process roughly corresponds to backtracking: a path of computation is chosen, and then if it <b>fails</b> <b>at</b> some point (if it evaluates mzero), then it backtracks to the last branching point, and follows the next path, and so on. If the second element is then requested, it again does just enough work to get the second solution, and so on. So the list monad is a simple way to implement a backtracking algorithm in a lazy language.|$|E
500|$|Some critics, like Mark Kinkead-Weekes and Margaret Doody, {{like the}} novel and emphasise the {{importance}} of the moral themes that Richardson takes up. In a 1987 article, Kinkead-Weekes admits that the [...] "novel <b>fails</b> <b>at</b> the [...] crisis" [...] and [...] "it must be doubtful whether it could hope for much life in the concluding volumes".

500|$|... "Weight Gain 4000" [...] {{served as}} a {{commentary}} on American consumerism, the equation of personal happiness with consumption and the purchase of material possessions. This satire is particularly demonstrated by Cartman's blind faith in the Weight Gain 4000 bodybuilding supplement product despite strong evidence that the product <b>fails</b> <b>at</b> its primary function. Specifically, the product promises to build muscle, and Cartman believes it has fulfilled this function even after he only becomes extremely overweight. This blind faith is also illustrated by the complete disregard Cartman demonstrates for warnings that Weight Gain 4000 carries a risk of permanent damage to the liver and kidneys. The tremendous amount of product Cartman buys is further indicative of American purchasing habits.|$|E
