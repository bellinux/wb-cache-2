40|$|Background: The normal inspiratory to expiratory {{ratio is}} 1 : 2. However, the {{duration}} of inspiration can be increased voluntarily till the ratio becomes 2 : 1. This is called as inverse ratio breathing. The effects of inverse ratio ventilation have been studied on patients with respiratory failure and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.

Hence this study was carried out to find the immediate effects of inverse ratio breathing versus diaphragmatic breathing on <b>inspiratory</b> vital <b>capacity</b> and thoracic expansion. Methods: 30 healthy adult females in the age group 20 - 25 years were included in the study. <b>Inspiratory</b> vital <b>capacity</b> and thoracic expansion at 2 nd, 4 th and 6 th intercostal space was measured using a digital spirometer and an inelastic inch tape respectively. Diaphragmatic breathing was administered for one minute and the same parameters were measured again.

There was extremely significant difference between the mean increase in the <b>inspiratory</b> vital <b>capacity</b> and thoracic expansion at the 2 nd, 4 th and 6 th intercostals space after inverse ratio breathing as compared to diaphragmatic breathing (p < 0. 0001).

40|$|Children are an {{important}} target group for inhalation therapy, but {{little is known about}} their intellectual and <b>inspiratory</b> <b>capacities</b> to operate dry powder inhalers (DPIs). Most studies so far have focused either on a specific DPI, or on (single) inhala- tion parameters and how these are affected by airflow resistance, which leaves many questions for the development of new devices for the pediatric population unanswered. In this study, we investigated the applicability of DPIs in children by a more systematic approach by using a test inhaler with variable airflow resistance and exchangeable mouthpiece design. The test inhaler was instrumented to record inhalation curves and equipped with fiberglass optics (sinuscope) to study the passageway for the aerosol through the mouth cavity. We examined for 103 school children (aged 4 - 12 years) whether they were able to use the test inhaler according to the instructions given. Nearly all (91) were able to perform one or more correct inhalations. We computed PIFs, inhaled volumes, and inhalation times from in total 256 recordings, and tested relationships with height and airflow resistance upon significance. We also noted preferences for airflow resistance and mouthpiece design, and investigated how these variables affect the inhalation maneuver. Ultimately, we aim to use the data from this study not only for prescribing the most appropriate type of currently marketed DPI to children, but particularly to design a new DPI that performs well within the range of <b>inspiratory</b> <b>capacities</b> (PIF and inhaled volume) to be expected for children...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Few {{studies have}} shown that the {{endurance}} shuttle walking test (ESWT) is responsive to treatment in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This exercise test needs to be further investigated because of its relevance for activity of daily living. The aim of the present study was to evaluate, in patients with COPD, the responsiveness of the ESWT in detecting improvement in walking performance after a single dose of salmeterol. In a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial, 20 patients with COPD performed two ESWT at 80 % of peak capacity 2. 5 h after inhaling either a placebo or 50 mg of salmeterol. Cardiorespiratory parameters were monitored during each walking test. <b>Inspiratory</b> <b>capacities</b> and Borg ratings for dyspnoea were obtained every other minute throughout the tests. Compared with placebo, salmeterol produced a significant change in lung function and a significant improvement in walking performance (mean¡SD difference in time: 117 ¡ 20 s; difference in distance: 160 ¡ 277 m). At isotime (the latest exercise time that was reached on both ESWT), a significant reduction in dyspnoea was observed after bronchodilation. Bronchodilation with salmeterol reduced dyspnoea during walking and improved walking capacity in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. These findings provide further support for the use of the endurance shuttle walking test as an evaluative tool in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease...|$|R
40|$|Slow <b>inspiratory</b> vital <b>capacity</b> (IVC) {{and forced}} expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) before and after an inhaled {{beta-agonist}} are widely used to detect reversible airflow limitation in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease. The measurement of airways resistance (Raw) during quiet breathing with the body plethysmograph is less frequently used. It may well be of importance in clinical emphysema where measurement of FEV, is confounded {{by the collapse of}} the bronchi, which does not occur when measuring Raw during quiet breathing. We assessed whether Rrs, in addition to IVC and FEV 1, can be used to gain a better insight into the reversibility with 400 mug of fenoterol in patients with clinical emphysema. We studied a group of 51 patients (9 women and 42 men; mean [+/- SD] age, 64. 7 [7. 7] years) who had a clinical diagnosis of emphysema. Significant reversibility was identified by spirometry (IVC, FEV 1) and body plethysmography (Raw) in 20 patients (39 percent). <b>Inspiratory</b> vital <b>capacity</b> alone identified reversibility of airflow limitation in 11 patients (22 percent). In 5 patients (10 percent), the postbronchodilator improvement was seen exclusively in the Raw measurement. In the remaining patients, absence of improvement in spirometric and plethysmographic parameters was found. Subjective improvement occurred to the same extent in patients whose Raw and IVC improved. We concluded that Raw gives important information about the reversibility of airways obstruction in patients with clinical emphysema.

These findings are particularly important since PRoVENT found differences between the ventilatory management of patients at risk and not at risk of ARDS [11]. While within the <b>inspiratory</b> <b>capacity,</b> the only independent variable for VILI is dynamic strain, i.e., VT, above the <b>inspiratory</b> <b>capacity,</b> the combination of all ventilation parameters can lead to VILI and worse outcome [43, 44].|$|E

30|$|We {{found that}} the {{threshold}} of VILI in the healthy lung is the region defining the <b>inspiratory</b> lung <b>capacity,</b> i.e., the anatomical limits of lung expansion. When the inflated volume is below the threshold, VILI does not occur, {{and if it is}} within the limits, it appears as a main function of its dynamic component. If it exceeds the total lung capacity, stress at rupture occurs. A unifying explanation is that the trigger for VILI is an excessive energy/power load, which encompasses pressures, volume and—though not tested in the present study—respiratory rate and flow. PEEP, not associated with energy input, appears to prevent VILI if the tidal volume is lower. Otherwise, PEEP may be harmful as it just boosts inflation closer to the total lung capacity.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of inhaled bronchodilators on pulmonary function and dyspnea in patients with chronic heart failure (HF). BACKGROUND: Conflicting data exist on whether bronchodilators may improve pulmonary function and dyspnea in patients with chronic HF. METHODS: In this retrospective observational study we analyzed data of 116 chronic HF outpatients with systolic dysfunction who underwent spirometry and Borg dyspnea measurements before and after inhalation of 400 mug salbutamol and 80 mug ipratropium. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma were excluded. RESULTS: Bronchodilators fully reversed airway obstruction (AO) in 25 of 64 (39. 1 %) patients with pre-bronchodilator AO. All spirometric measurements, except for forced vital and <b>inspiratory</b> <b>capacities,</b> improved significantly post-bronchodilation. Absolute and percent improvements in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) were more pronounced in patients with persistent AO post-bronchodilation compared to those without AO (0. 19 +/- 0. 18 L and 8. 4 +/- 7. 3 % versus 0. 11 +/- 0. 12 L and 4. 3 +/- 4. 0 %, p 200 mL and > 12 %) was noted in 12. 1 % and was more frequent in patients with persistent AO and fully reversible AO than in those without AO (23. 1 % and 16. 0 % versus 1. 9 %, p < 0. 05). We measured a small, albeit significant improvement in dyspnea (0. 7 +/- 1. 2 versus 0. 9 +/- 1. 3, p = 0. 002). CONCLUSIONS: Inhaled bronchodilators may have an additional role in the management of patients with chronic HF because of their potential to improve pulmonary function, especially in those with AO.

30|$|Taken {{with the}} {{appropriate}} caution, our findings may be of some interest when approaching mechanical ventilation in human ARDS. This syndrome involves reduced FRC—the baby lung [18, 19]. As the specific elastance of the baby lung is usually normal [20], we may expect the volumetric threshold, if similar to pigs, to be ≈ 2.6 [*]±[*] 0.6 times higher. As an example, in a 70 -kg man with severe ARDS, if the baby lung is around 300  mL, ignoring for simplicity’s sake 10 – 15  % of recruitability, the <b>inspiratory</b> <b>capacity</b> would be 780  mL. At 12  mL/kg body weight, the tidal volume would be 840  mL, {{within the range of}} <b>inspiratory</b> <b>capacity.</b> If we refer to the lower limits of <b>inspiratory</b> <b>capacity</b> ((2.6 – 2 × 0.6 × 300 [*]=[*] 420  mL), even the 6  mL/kg ventilation would be close to the volumetric threshold. To translate the pressometric threshold of pigs to humans, the pressure observed in pigs at <b>inspiratory</b> <b>capacity</b> should be approximately multiplied by 2, to take account of the difference in specific elastance.|$|E

40|$|Correct {{inhalation}} {{technique is}} essential for effective use of dry powder inhalers (DPIs), as their effectiveness largely depends on the patient's inhalation manoeuvre. Children are an especially challenging target population for DPI development due to the large variability in understanding and <b>inspiratory</b> <b>capacities.</b> We previously performed a study in which we determined the prerequisites for a paediatric DPI in a mostly healthy paediatric population, for which we used an empty test inhaler with variable internal airflow resistance and mouthpiece. In the current study we investigated what specifications are required for a DPI for children with cystic fibrosis (CF), for which we expanded on our previous findings. We recorded flow profiles of 35 children with CF (aged 4. 7 - 14. 7 years) at three airflow resistances (0. 031 - 0. 045 kPa 0. 5. min. L- 1) from which various inspiratory parameters were computed. Obstructions in the mouth during inhalation were recorded with a sinuscope. All children were able to perform a correct inhalation manoeuvre, although video analysis showed that children did not place the inhaler correctly in the mouth in 17 % of the cases. No effect was found of medium to high airflow resistance on total inhaled volume, which implies that the whole resistance range tested is suitable for children with CF aged 4 - 14 years. No effect could be established of either mouthpiece design or airflow resistance on the occurrence of obstructions in the mouth cavity. This study confirms our previous conclusion {{that the development of}} DPIs specifically for children is highly desired. Such a paediatric DPI should function well at 0. 5 L inhaled volume and a peak inspiratory flow rate of 20 to 30 L/min, depending on the internal airflow resistance. This resistance can be increased up to 0. 045 kPa 0. 5. min. L- 1 (medium-high) to reduce oropharyngeal deposition. A higher resistance may be less favourable due to its compromising effect on PIF and thereby on the energy available for powder dispersion...|$|R

The children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, however, had a lower forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) before bronchodilator (73 % predicted) than the other groups (88 - 95 % predicted). Children who had required ventilation had lower values for specific airways conductance (sGaw) and a greater increase in FEV 1 (delta FEV 1) after salbutamol (13 %) than non-ventilated children (6 %); delta FEV 1 was associated with the peak pressure of intermittent positive pressure ventilation, a family history of asthma and a history of wheezing, recurrent respiratory illnesses, and a doctor's diagnosis of asthma during the three years before the study.

METHODS: We measured <b>inspiratory</b> <b>capacity,</b> sensation of dyspnea, peripheral oxygen saturation, heart rate and respiratory rate in 19 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients. These measurements were taken at rest and after performing activities of daily living (e. g., going up and down a set of stairs, going up and down a ramp and sweeping and mopping a room). RESULT: The <b>inspiratory</b> <b>capacity</b> of patients at rest was significantly decreased compared to the capacity of patients after performing activities. The change in <b>inspiratory</b> <b>capacity</b> was - 0. 67 L after going up and down a ramp, - 0. 46 L after sweeping and mopping a room, and - 0. 55 L after climbing up and down a set of stairs.
