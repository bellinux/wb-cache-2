At the show's end, Williams was swimming in a pool specially constructed on the set for her appearance. Como simply said, [...] "Goodnight, folks," [...] and leaped, fully clothed, into the swimming pool.|$|E
500|$|Douglass {{was one of}} {{the final}} five players cut during {{training}} camp by the Bears at the beginning of September, but they re-signed him in late November when they put Jim McMahon on injured reserve. [...] He did not play much in 1986, but was described as a favorite of coach Mike Ditka by the Chicago Sun-Times. [...] Chicago Tribune writers noted that Ditka <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>kick</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his big earring and fashion sense. [...] In the 1987–88 NFL playoffs, although had only one previous start in his two-year career, he started for the Bears in place of five-year veteran Mike Richardson at left cornerback against the Redskins in their January 10, 1988 Divisional playoff game. [...] The following season, when Shaun Gayle suffered a season-ending injury for the 1988 Bears, he took over the starting free safety assignment.|$|E
2500|$|In early 1957, Presley {{gave his}} parents, Vernon and Gladys Presley, a $100,000 budget, {{and asked them}} to find a [...] "farmhouse" [...] type {{property}} to purchase. At the time, Graceland was located several miles beyond Memphis' main urban area. In later years, Memphis would expand with housing, resulting in Graceland being surrounded by other properties. Presley purchased Graceland on March 19, 1957 for the amount of $102,500. Later that year, Presley invited Richard Williams and Buzz Cason [...] "to get a close look at this mansion Elvis had told us about. ... We proceeded to clown around on the front porch, striking our best rock 'n' roll poses and snapping pictures with the little camera. We peeked in the not-yet-curtained windows and <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>kick</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the pastel colored walls in the front rooms with shades of bright reds and purples that Elvis most certainly had picked out." [...] Elvis was fond of claiming that the US government had mooted a visit to Graceland by Nikita Khrushchev, 'to see how in America a fellow can start out with nothing and, you know, make good'.|$|E

40|$|The {{basis for}} this {{successful}} collaboration was face-to-face communication. Though it was sometimes stressful being on the road so much, I really learned {{the importance of being}} present to work together and ask questions in person. Another measure of success was that {{in the midst of this}} project and traveling, my wife and I managed to start a family. My oldest boy <b>got</b> <b>a</b> real <b>kick</b> <b>out</b> of visiting Space Center Houston when he was two to learn all about the "face futtle" which goes way up in the sky. When practical, collocation and face-to-face communication on a project eliminate misunderstandings, establish relationships, make information more easily accessible, and promote a team atmosphere. Compromise is key to balancing both family and career goals. Knowing when to prioritize each is important to success in both aspects...|$|R
5000|$|Many of the {{locations}} in Rocko's Modern Life have the letter [...] "O" [...] in them; for example, O-Town and Conglom-O Corporation. When {{asked about the}} use of [...] "O" [...] in his show, Murray said: I always <b>got</b> <b>a</b> big <b>kick</b> <b>out</b> of the businesses that were 'House-O-Paint', or 'Ton-O-Noodles', because their names seemed to homogenize what they sold, and strip the products of true individuality and stress volume ... and we all know, the American dream is volume! So what better company to create volume than 'Conglom-O', and since a majority of the town worked at Conglom-O, it should be called 'O' Town. I also wanted the town to be 'anytown' USA, and I used to love sports players with a big ZERO on their back. It was funny to me.|$|R

500|$|In {{addition}} to Borland's visual appearance, the band has also used elaborate stage setups in their performances. Their Ladies Night in Cambodia club tour visually {{paid tribute to}} the film Apocalypse Now, with an elaborate stage setup which featured an empty Jeep, camouflage mesh and palm trees.

5000|$|Formed in 1978, the Laclede String Quartet (better {{known as}} the Laclede Quartet) is an all-female string quartet that plays popular as well as {{classical}} music. The Laclede Quartet was founded by violinist Sallie Coffman (now also concertmaster for the St. Louis Muny orchestra), and is from the Metropolitan St. Louis, Missouri, and Illinois area. Especially their popular music performances and CDs have resonated with audiences: their second album featured music by Andrew Lloyd Webber and was their biggest success to that date, 1992. Through the help of Hillary Clinton their fame has spread to the Middle East. In a 2000 interview, Sallie Coffman recollected, [...] "We met her Clinton {{when she was in}} St. Louis and she took our recordings back to the White House [...] [...] [...] Somehow they made it to an embassy in Abudabi.

5000|$|In 1949, the New Zealand 'All Blacks' toured South Africa, {{the first}} team to do so since the Second World War.

The All Blacks then {{travelled}} north to Rhodesia to play the Rhodesian team in two matches. Two South African selectors, Danie Craven and Bert Kipling, watched the games which ended in a 10--8 win for Rhodesia in the first game and a 3-3 draw in the second. Van Schoor's tackling so impressed the selectors that he, and fellow Rhodesia team-mate Salty du Rand, was chosen for the second Test at Johannesburg. The game ended in a 12-6 win for South Africa. This was the first of twelve consecutive international matches the van Schoor played in. He faced New Zealand twice more in the tour, both wins, 9-3 at Durban and 11-8 at Port Elizabeth. ...Ryk, who was played purely for his amazing defensive qualities and who, in association with Hennie Muller, tore our midfield attack to shreds.

He was not really fast but he <b>got</b> such <b>a</b> <b>kick</b> <b>out</b> of making the perfect tackle that he used to clap on all speed just before going into his dive - and boy, was it a powerful dive. - New Zealand rugby player Bob Scott describing van Schoor in his 1956 autobiography The Bob Scott Story ...|$|R

Burnett's soundtrack topped the Billboard charts for many weeks and went on to win a Grammy for Album of the Year. Alan Lomax's daughter Anna Lomax Chairetakis (now Anna Lomax Wood), director of the The Alan Lomax Archive, and Don Fleming, director of Licensing for the Archive, hoped that Carter was still alive and determined to track him down:Searching through the archives of the Mississippi penal system, Social Security files, property records and other public records and various databases, the record's producer, T-Bone Burnett; the Lomax archives; and an investigative journalist for a Florida newspaper found Mr. Carter in Chicago with his wife, Rosie Lee Carter, a longtime minister of the Holy Temple Church of God. Chairetakis and Fleming flew to Chicago to personally present Carter with a royalty check. Carter who had spent much of his adult life working as a shipping clerk, told them he did not remember having sung the song 40 years previously. Fleming then informed him that the soundtrack album was outselling the latest CDs of Michael Jackson and Mariah Carey. [...] "I told him, you beat both of them out," [...] Mr. Fleming said.

I decided to send something for entertainment, so I stuck some pistol caps on the back of old photos from an Italian magazine of WWI vintage. I remember there was a photo of a priest blessing a propeller of an Italian Air Force fighter plane. The idea was to put the photo on an anvil and hit the front with a hammer until all the caps exploded.

He also set up Implosions Inc. with Maciunas to mass-produce novelty items, and helped run the Flux Housing Co-Operative, an artist-run scheme that is held responsible for the rehabilitation and gentrification of SoHo, offering cheap loft spaces to artists throughout the sixties and seventies. Watts himself was the first resident of the first working Flux Co-Op at 80 Wooster Street. Jonas Mekas' cinematheque and Maciunas' apartment were housed in the same building which soon became the 'central Fluxus loft'.

Either he's feeling inadequate or old or I don't know, but I have no reason to talk shit about him." [...] Later in 2001, Patton also theorized that [...] "I think Anthony, deep down, feels like I'm a better dancer than he is. I think I shake my booty just a little bit fresher than he does.
