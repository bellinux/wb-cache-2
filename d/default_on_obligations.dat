40|$|Corporate {{failures}} and consequent <b>default</b> <b>on</b> <b>obligations</b> have, in some circumstances, led to significant losses for employees with accumulated unpaid leave entitlements. The Australian government responded initially {{to this problem}} by implementing a government funded compensation scheme. Subsequently it announced a proposal involving legislating for seniority (maximum priority) of entitlements in corporate liquidation {{which has not been}} implemented. This paper analyses and provides quantitative estimates of the consequences of changing creditor priority in this manner. Contrary to conventional wisdom and arguments mounted in opposition to such a change, the effect on corporate funding costs would be extremely small. The paper argues that legislation to effect such a change warrants further consideration as a complement to the existing compensation scheme...|$|E
40|$|The article {{studies the}} ways and level of the {{protection}} of the rights of shared construction participants in Russia, and the utilization of builders liability insurance for the purpose to identify the problem regions and the prospects of the development of mechanisms ensuring the liability of developers. The basis for the article was the study of real estate developers in 15 cities with the population over 1 million people. The article presents the data of the types of fund raising for building housing in the cities with the population over 1 million people, the regional differentiation in this parameter is highlighted. The article has explored the implementation of mechanisms ensuring the liability of developers for transfering premises to the shareholders. The main factors considered in the article are the form of registration of the relationship between a developer and an individual — an investor, as well as the mechanisms ensuring the liability of developers. It is shown that in some regions, the level of protection of the participants of shared construction is low. The mechanisms ensuring the liability of developers including the legal requirements for liability insurance and guarantee of credit institution are systematized. In the article, the key term of the liability insurance of builders for <b>default</b> <b>on</b> <b>obligations</b> or improperly performing the obligations on the delivery of residential properties, and also the condition of the guarantee of credit institution on the delivery of residential properties are considered. The regional features of how people participate in the construction of housing are described in the context of mechanisms ensuring the liability of developers. The use of various ensuring mechanisms, the differences in insurance by the commercial organizations and by joining the mutual society are shown. The results of the study can be used at the correction of the state and regional policy in the field of housing construction. In the article, it is shown that in the future, the strengthening of the value of financial mechanisms providing the liability insurance of developers should be expected in the connection of the growth of a number of incomplete housing for which the law provides a compulsory liability insurance of developers or security of credit organizatio...|$|E

30|$|Although {{reclamation}} bonding {{may have}} some disadvantages (Shogren et al. 1993), international experience has proven that the bonding procedure is an effective and reasonable practice to ensure reclamation if a company <b>defaults</b> <b>on</b> permit <b>obligations</b> (McLeod 2000; Cheng 2009).

50|$|Many economists {{believe that}} the Asian crisis was created not by market {{psychology}} or technology, but by policies that distorted incentives within the lender-borrower relationship.

50|$|In nominal terms, {{government}} must pay off its existing liabilities (government debt) either by refinancing (rolling over the debt, issuing new debt {{to pay the}} old) or amortizing (paying it off from surpluses in tax revenue).

Alternatively, it could <b>default</b> <b>on</b> its <b>obligations.</b>|$|R
