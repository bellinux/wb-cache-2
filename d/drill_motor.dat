3000|$|The {{schematic}} {{diagram of the}} laboratory scale (scaled-down) drilling simulator is shown in Fig.  1 a. The rig is powered by an electric <b>drill</b> <b>motor</b> with two rotational speed configurations (300 and 600  rpm) to provide adequate rotary speed and torque to the bit via the drillstring. The loading system consists of a rack-pinion arrangement through which a suspended weight, {{in addition to a}} constant weight, {{can be applied to the}} bit. The rotary head accounts for the constant weight on bit (WOB) and consists of the <b>drill</b> <b>motor</b> and the drillstring. The drillstring components include a cradle, a swivel, a compliant tool, and a drill pipe. The swivel allows the injection of fluid into the drill pipe down to the drill bit nozzles and the complaint tool, which is configured rigidly for the current experiment, provides a relative motion between the top system and the drill pipe using a set of coned-disc springs and rubber-damping elements. The drill pipe connects the drill bit with the top system (i.e. swivel, motor, etc.) [...]...|$|E

40|$|New {{developments}} in vibration analysis better explain machinery resonance, through {{an example of}} drill bit chattering during machining of rusted steel. The vibration of an operating <b>drill</b> <b>motor</b> was measured, the natural frequency of an attached spring was measured, and the two frequencies were compared {{to show that the}} system was resonant. For resonance to occur, one of the natural frequencies of a structural component must be excited by a cyclic force of the same frequency. In this case, the frequency of drill bit chattering due to motor rotation equaled the spring frequency (cycles per second), and the system was unstable. A soft rust coating on the steel to be drilled permitted chattering to start at the drill bit tip, and the bit oscillated on and off of the surface, which increased the wear rate of the drill bit. This resonant condition is typically referred to as a motor critical speed. The analysis presented here quantifies the vibration associated with this particular critical speed problem, using novel techniques to describe resonance...|$|E

40|$|A self contained, mobile {{drilling}} and coring system {{was designed to}} operate on the Lunar surface and be controlled remotely from earth. The system uses SKITTER (Spatial Kinematic Inertial Translatory Tripod Extremity Robot) as its foundation and produces Lunar core samples two meters long and fifty millimeters in diameter. The drill bit used for this is composed of 30 per carat diamonds in a sintered tungsten carbide matrix. To drill up to 50 m depths, the bit assembly will be attached to a drill string made from 2 m rods which will be carried in racks on SKITTER. Rotary power for drilling will be supplied by a Curvo-Synchronous motor. SKITTER is to support this system through a hexagonal shaped structure which will contain the <b>drill</b> <b>motor</b> and the power supply. A micro-coring drill {{will be used to}} remove a preliminary sample 5 mm in diameter and 20 mm long {{from the side of the}} core. This whole system is to be controlled from earth.

40|$|A tool makes a cut {{perpendicular}} to the cylindrical axis of a core hole at a predetermined depth to free the core at that depth. The tool does not damage the surrounding material from which the core was cut, and it operates within the core-hole kerf. Coring usually begins with use of a hole saw or a hollow cylindrical abrasive cutting tool to make an annular hole that leaves the core (sometimes called the plug) in place. In this approach to coring as practiced heretofore, the core is removed forcibly in a manner chosen to shear the core, preferably {{at or near the}} greatest depth of the core hole. Unfortunately, such forcible removal often damages both the core and the surrounding material (see Figure 1). In an alternative prior approach, especially applicable to toxic or fragile material, a core is formed and freed by means of milling operations that generate much material waste. In contrast, the present tool eliminates the damage associated with the hole-saw approach and reduces the extent of milling operations (and, hence, reduces the waste) associated with the milling approach. The present tool (see Figure 2) includes an inner sleeve and an outer sleeve and resembles the hollow cylindrical tool used to cut the core hole. The sleeves are thin enough that this tool fits within the kerf of the core hole. The inner sleeve is attached to a shaft that, in turn, can be attached to a <b>drill</b> <b>motor</b> or handle for turning the tool. This tool also includes a cutting wire attached to the distal ends of both sleeves. The cutting wire is long enough that with sufficient relative rotation of the inner and outer sleeves, the wire can cut {{all the way to the}} center of the core. The tool is inserted in the kerf until its distal end is seated at the full depth. The inner sleeve is then turned. During turning, frictional drag on the outer core pulls the cutting wire into contact with the core. The cutting force of the wire against the core increases with the tension in the wire and, hence, with the frictional drag acting on the outer sleeve. As the wire cuts toward the center of the core, the inner sleeve rotates farther with respect to the outer sleeve. Once the wire has cut to the center of the core, the tool and the core can be removed from the hole. The proper choice of cutting wire depends on the properties of the core material. For a sufficiently soft core material, a nonmetallic monofilament can be used. For a rubber-like core material, a metal wire can be used. For a harder core material, it is necessary to use an abrasive wire, and the efficiency of the tool can be increased greatly by vacuuming away the particles generated during cutting. For a core material that can readily be melted or otherwise cut by use of heat, it could be preferable to use an electrically heated cutting wire. In such a case, electric current can be supplied to the cutting wire, from an electrically isolated source, via rotating contact rings mounted on the sleeves...|$|E

30|$|Downhole {{sources of}} random noise are the {{pressure}} fluctuations caused by bit vibration, <b>drilling</b> <b>motor</b> stalling and the drill bit interaction with formation being drilled. Mechanical rig vibration and electrical noise coupling into the electrical wiring {{that carries the}} electrical signals from the drilling sensors to the signal receiver may degrade telemetry signal detection and extraction (Shi et al. 2004). These noises present the band-limited white Gaussian noise due to the lower noise frequency spectrum (Hutin et al. 2001). Although the random noise frequencies are small but they can affect certain signal frequency bands, causing relatively larger random pressure amplitude fluctuations and may lower downhole signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).|$|R

50|$|A mud <b>motor</b> (or <b>drilling</b> <b>motor)</b> is a {{progressive}} cavity {{positive displacement pump}} (PCPD) placed in the drill string to provide additional power to the bit while drilling. The PCPD pump uses drilling fluid (commonly referred to as drilling mud, or just mud) to create eccentric motion in the power section of the motor which is transferred as concentric power to the drill bit (well). The mud motor uses different rotor and stator configurations to provide optimum performance for the desired drilling operation, typically {{increasing the number of}} lobes and length of power assembly for greater horsepower. In certain applications, compressed air, or other gas, can be used for mud motor input power. Normal rotation of the bit while using a mud motor can be from 60 rpm, to over 100 rpm.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} assure the {{continued}} development of geothermal resources, many advances in materials technology are required so that high costs resulting from the severe environments encountered during drilling, well completion and energy extraction can be reduced. These needs will become more acute as higher temperature and chemically aggressive fluids are encountered. High priority needs are for lost circulation control and lightweight well completion materials, and tools such as drill pipe protectors, rotating head seals, blow-out preventers, and downhole <b>drill</b> <b>motors.</b> The lack of suitable hydrolytically stable chemical systems that can bond previously developed elastomers to metal reinforcement is a critical but as yet unaddressed impediment {{to the development of}} these tools. In addition, the availability of low cost corrosion and scale-resistant tubular lining materials would greatly enhance transport and energy extraction processes utilizing hypersaline brines. Work to address these materials needs is underway at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), and recent accomplishments are summarized in the paper...|$|R
5000|$|Combined, these survey {{tools and}} BHA designs made {{directional}} drilling possible, {{but it was}} perceived as arcane. The next major advance was in the 1970s, when downhole <b>drilling</b> <b>motors</b> (aka mud motors, driven by the hydraulic power of drilling mud circulated down the drill string) became common. These allowed the drill bit to continue rotating at the cutting face {{at the bottom of}} the hole, while most of the drill pipe was held stationary. A piece of bent pipe (a [...] "bent sub") between the stationary drill pipe and the top of the motor allowed the direction of the wellbore to be changed without needing to pull all the drill pipe out and place another whipstock. Coupled with the development of measurement while drilling tools (using mud pulse telemetry, networked or wired pipe or EM telemetry, which allows tools down hole to send directional data back to the surface without disturbing drilling operations), directional drilling became easier.|$|R

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of ice core drilling is {{to obtain the}} highest quality core while minimizing the effort needed. This requires a control system with precision control and convenient operation. An intermediate-depth portable ice core drilling system designed and constructed at the Byrd Polar Research Center (BPRC) has been tested during four expeditions under different working conditions. Several design options were tested to both control and monitor performance of the winch, thermal and electro-mechanic drills. An attempt {{has been made to}} develop a universal controller that can be used with either thermal or electro-mechanical drills and with various power sources, ranging from a conventional alternating current (AC) portable generator, custom high voltage direct current (DC) generator or an array of solar panels. Currently, controller system built in two configurations : (1) to operate a 500 m winch, dry hole electro-mechanical (EM) drill and fluid electro-thermal (ET) drill at low (1 kW) power, and (2) to operate a 500 m winch, EM and ET drills at high power (400 Vdc and 6. 0 kW). To allow the use of different power sources and different drills a modular design was chosen. The control system includes three modules : (1) for measuring and indicating drill depth, drill rate, and cable tension, (2) for driving reversible winch and <b>drill</b> <b>motors</b> at the same time (225 Vdc, 2. 25 kW), and (3) for driving a high power (400 Vdc, 20 kW) <b>drill</b> or winch <b>motor.</b> The controllers are built around industrial servo-amplifiers (SA) for DC brush motors and have over-voltage and over-current protection.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of operational capabilities of inclined drilling equipment and technology is presented. Two options of rotary drilling are reviewed as technical and technological solutions, facilitating construction of wells with difficult profiles. The first option {{implies that the}} driver unit of the drill bit is represented by downhole <b>drilling</b> <b>motor,</b> the second one utilizes sophisticated rotary steerable systems. Practical results of drilling wells with difficult profiles are presented. A quality assessment of drilling is provided through the example of comparing designed and actual trajectories, using different driver units for the drill bit, as well as properties of surrounding rocks, rheology of the drill fluid and other characteristics of dynamically active systems. A range of rotation speed has been determined that allows rotary steerable systems to have minimal oscillation amplitude of the bottom-hole assembly.   Analysis of investigation {{results showed that the}} main source of oscillations is linked to bending and compressing stresses, caused by well deviations as well as rigidity of the drilling tool. In effect, in the bottom-hole assembly occur auto-oscillations, making it impossible to correct azimuth and zenith angles. Alteration of rigidity in the bottom part of the tool and drilling parameters, implying reduced rotation speed of the drill string and regulation of drill bit pressure, can partially solve this problem, though increase in rotation speed is limited by technical characteristics of existing top drive systems...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this effort is to develop, build and test a high-speed <b>drilling</b> <b>motor</b> that can meet the performance guidelines of the announcement, namely: 'The motors are expected to rotate at a minimum of 10, 000 rpm, have an OD no larger than 7 inches and work downhole continuously for at least 100 hours. The motor must have common oilfield thread connections capable of making up to a drill bit and bottomhole assembly. The motor must be capable of transmitting drilling fluid through the motor'. To these goals, APS would add that the motor must be economically viable, {{in terms of both}} its manufacturing and maintenance costs, and be applicable to as broad a range of markets as possible. APS has taken the approach of using a system using planetary gears to increase the speed of a conventional mud motor to 10, 000 rpm. The mud flow is directed around the outside of the gear train, and a unique flow diversion system has been employed. A prototype of the motor was built and tested in APS's high-pressure flow loop. The motor operated per the model up to {approx} 4200 rpm. At that point a bearing seized and the performance was severely degraded. The motor is being rebuilt and will be retested outside of this program...|$|R
