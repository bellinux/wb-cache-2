The rural district around Pisa and part of Providence County are also included. Summaries imbedded in the file permit analysis at the individual, household, or nuclear unit level. The package also contains a coursebook with explanation of each variable, a dictionary with occupational titles that appear in the censuses, course syllabus, and other instructions for use.
