Then we whirled in with the pick and shovel, and in about two hours and a half the job was done. We crept in under Jim's bed and into the cabin, and pawed around and found the candle and lit it, and stood over Jim awhile, and found him looking hearty and healthy, and then we woke him up gentle and gradual. He was so glad to see us he most cried; and called us honey, and all the pet names he could think of; and was <b>for</b> <b>having</b> <b>us</b> hunt up a cold-chisel to cut the chain off of his leg with right away, and {{clearing}} out without losing any time. But Tom he showed him how unregular it would be, and set down and told him all about our plans, and how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm; and not to be the least afraid, because we would see he got away, SURE. So Jim he said it was all right, and we set there and talked over old times awhile, and then Tom asked a lot of questions, and when Jim told him Uncle Silas come in every day or two to pray with him, and Aunt Sally come in {{to see if he was}} comfortable and had plenty to eat, and both of them was kind as they could be, Tom says: ...|$|E

5000|$|Carrington's {{radio show}} on BBC Radio 2 {{entitled}} All Time Greats began on 4 October 1981. It was broadcast {{for two hours}} every Sunday from 1pm. Although initially pre-recorded and broadcast from a BBC studio, his first live broadcast {{from his home in}} Perthshire was on 31 August 1997, this was the day that Diana, Princess of Wales, died and Carrington agreed that it would be inappropriate to use the pre-recorded show on that day. In 2004 it was moved to an hourly slot on a Tuesday evening, and a few years later to a Friday night. The show was called 'The Music Goes Round' with a usual weekly theme of music, an occasional special 50s night and musical nights. He introduced every show with the greeting [...] "Evening all, from home in Perthshire" [...] and then always ended his show with [...] "Bye just now!" [...] and [...] "...of course, thank you <b>for</b> <b>having</b> <b>us</b> [...] "us" [...] emphasised at your place" [...] not forgetting a reference to his cat, [...] "Golden Paws" [...] Sam. Carrington used his personal collection of some 80,000 CDs, LPs and 78s. When he retired in 2016 the show was still attracting more than 800,000 listeners.|$|E

40|$|Mr. Enda Egan: I {{thank the}} {{committee}} <b>for</b> <b>having</b> <b>us</b> today during national carers’ week. This {{is a great}} opportunity for us to come here on behalf of family carers to voice the main issues that affect carers regarding health issues. The members have the document and I shall go very quickly through the first section or introduction. Most members will be very much aware of the role of family carers and the kinds of statistics that sit behind it so I shall run though this briefly. There are about 160, 000 family carers in Ireland, according to the last census. As everybody will know, family carers provide very valuable work looking after loved ones in their own homes. By and large, a carer does not make a choice to provide care. An actual incident happens to a loved one, to a husband, wife, child with special needs or a person who gets a terminal illness. Somebody in the family has to make a decision to stay at home and provide that care. Obviously, this saves the State huge sums of money. There are about 40, 000 full-time carers in Ireland, people who are doing this job around the clock, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. They are {{not in a position to}} leave unless somebody else comes in to fill in for them because of the level of care required by the person who is being cared for. According to the 2006 census there are more than 90, 000 people who provide care and work in paid employment. Some 14, 000 of those work full-time as well as providing more than 43 hours of care per week. That is an horrendous load to have on one person. Statistics wise, there are just over 5, 000 young carers in Ireland but I would not know whether these are aged between 15 and 19 years. The statistics from the 2006 census did not allow us to pick up how many carers there are below the age of 15. The new census to take place in 2011 will be able to pick that up, which is a strong development...|$|E

I wanted to be alone with you for a while today but it’s {{probably}} a good thing I wasn’t. {{there were a couple of}} things I was going to say—nothing important but it’s undoubtedly for the best that we weren’t alone today. What a bunch of moods we went through last night. Just about every one in the books—or don’t they have a book of moods? Gee, honey, you’re so wonderful and patient—I love you so. The more I think about March, the further it seems away. Gee, honey, will it ever get here. Everyone else says it will be here before I know it. I wish I could believe that. Time sure flies when I’m with you but golly, darling, when you’re not around, every minute drags. I love you so, honey. Judson, I know that I’ve never been in love with anyone before. There could never be anyone else for me either, darling. You’ve spoiled me for every other male. There isn’t a man living who could compare to you. I love you so, darling. I only wish that I could show you how much I love you. That’s one thing I’ll never be able to do. I love you so, my darling. Honestly, you’re so sweet and thoughtful. How can anyone be as wonderful as you. Judson, I do hate to be away from you even for a few minutes. These next two months will be murder, darling, I don’t know what I’ll ever do without you for two whole months. Darling, I’m in a rut. I can’t think of anything but you 2 ̆ 6 being near you. That’s the only thing I care to think about, too. Hon, this can’t go on much longer. Golly, I love you so. Weekends go so fast now. This one just flew so awfully fast. Darling, I meant to thank you <b>for</b> <b>having</b> <b>us</b> up to the Air Show. It was wonderful. Gee, those planes were beautiful. I can understand how you love them so much 2 ̆ 6 I wish I could fly with you. It was a wonderful show 2 ̆ 6 you’re wonderful, too. What a one track mind I have, darling. How do you like this short little letter, my darling? I just go on 2 ̆ 6 on writing to you. You’re so marvelous 2 ̆ 6 I love you. Honey, it just doesn’t seem possible. Really, I was so sure that I never could love you any more than I did before but—well, it’s the same old story. I love you so much more, my darling. It just doesn’t seem possible, honey, that I could love anyone this much. Well, my darling, please write often. I love you so. Oh, tell Steve I’ll try to write him tomorrow. I don’t have anything to tell him, though because I’m in such a fog that I wouldn’t hear anything anyone said to me. What did you do after you left us tonight. Golly, I hated to leave you today, honey. Well, hon, I’ve got to get to sleep. It’s about 7 : 30 and I’ll probably get there about none. I love you. All my love,Dottie[Transcription ends...|$|E
