In order to improve our knowledge on the ecology and natural history of this bird, a large radio telemetry was conducted by a team of researchers between 1994 and 2006. The main objectives of this study were to determine the home range of A. ambiguus, characterize the habitats that it frequents and learn more about its natural history in general (feeding habits, <b>ecological</b> associations, <b>abundance,</b> and reproduction and nesting habits). The results of this study were published in 2007. It was found that, in Costa Rica and adjacent Panama, the habitats where great green macaws occur were dominated by the wood almond (Dipteryx panamensis (or D. oleifera)), oilbean trees (Pentaclethra macroloba) and raffia palms (Raphia spp.). This is not surprising considering that great green macaws depend on D. panamensis for both feeding and nesting.|$|R

40|$|A phylogenetic {{approach}} {{was taken to}} investigate the evolutionary history of seed appendages in the plant family Polygalaceae (Fabales) and determine which factors might be associated with evolution of elaiosomes through comparisons to abiotic (climate) and biotic (ant species number and abundance) timelines. Molecular datasets from three plastid regions representing 160 species were used to reconstruct a phylogenetic tree of the order Fabales, focusing on Polygalaceae. Bayesian dating methods were used to estimate {{the age of the}} appearance of ant-dispersed elaiosomes in Polygalaceae, shown by likelihood optimizations to have a single origin in the family. Topology-based tests indicated a diversification rate shift associated with appearance of caruncular elaiosomes. We show that evolution of the caruncular elaiosome type currently associated with ant dispersal occurred 54. 0 - 50. 5 million year ago. This is long after an estimated increase in ant lineages in the Late Cretaceous based on molecular studies, but broadly concomitant with increasing global temperatures culminating in the Late Paleocene-Early Eocene thermal maxima. These results suggest that although most major ant clades were present when elaiosomes appeared, the environmental significance of elaiosomes may have been an important factor in success of elaiosome-bearing lineages. <b>Ecological</b> <b>abundance</b> of ants is perhaps more important than lineage numbers in determining significance of ant dispersal.

These characteristics can then be used to identify critial habitats that are necessary for preservation and conservation of the longnose dace. By comparing ecological data among streams where longnose dace are located, the environmental and landscape characteristics that influence distribution of the species can be determined.

40|$|One of the tantalising {{remaining}} {{problems in}} compositional data analysis lies {{in how to}} deal with data sets in which there are components which are essential zeros. By an essential zero we mean a component which is truly zero, not something recorded as zero simply because the experimental design or the measuring instrument has not been sufficiently sensitive to detect a trace of the part. Such essential zeros occur in many compositional situations, such as household budget patterns, time budgets, palaeontological zonation studies, <b>ecological</b> <b>abundance</b> studies. Devices such as non-zero replacement and amalgamation are almost invariably ad hoc and unsuccessful in such situations. From consideration of such examples it seems sensible to build up a model in two stages, the first determining where the zeros will occur and the second how the unit available is distributed among the non-zero parts. In this paper we suggest two such models, an independent binomial conditional logistic normal model and a hierarchical dependent binomial conditional logistic normal model. The compositional data in such modelling consist of an incidence matrix and a conditional compositional matrix. Interesting statistical problems arise, such as the question of estimability of parameters, the nature of the computational process for the estimation of both the incidence and compositional parameters caused by the complexity of the subcompositional structure, the formation of meaningful hypotheses, and the devising of suitable testing methodology within a lattice of such essential zero-compositional hypotheses. The methodology is illustrated by application to both simulated and real compositional data...|$|E

40|$|AbstractWhatever {{criteria}} {{are used to}} measure evolutionary success – species numbers, geographic range, <b>ecological</b> <b>abundance,</b> ecological and life history diversity, background diversification rates, or the presence of rapidly evolving clades – the legume family {{is one of the}} most successful lineages of flowering plants. Despite this, we still know rather little about the dynamics of lineage and species diversification across the family through the Cenozoic, or about the underlying drivers of diversification. There have been few attempts to estimate net species diversification rates or underlying speciation and extinction rates for legume clades, to test whether among-lineage variation in diversification rates deviates from null expectations, or to locate species diversification rate shifts on specific branches of the legume phylogenetic tree. In this study, time-calibrated phylogenetic trees for a set of species-rich legume clades – Calliandra, Indigofereae, Lupinus, Mimosa and Robinieae – and for the legume family as a whole, are used to explore how we might approach these questions. These clades are analysed using recently developed maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods to detect species diversification rate shifts and test for among-lineage variation in speciation, extinction and net diversification rates. Possible explanations for rate shifts in terms of extrinsic factors and/or intrinsic trait evolution are discussed. In addition, several methodological issues and limitations associated with these analyses are highlighted emphasizing the potential to improve our understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of legume diversification by using much more densely sampled phylogenetic trees that integrate information across broad taxonomic, geographical and temporal levels...|$|E
40|$|It is {{predicted}} that ocean acidification (OA) threatens coral reefs worldwide, by lowering seawater pH {{which in turn}} compromises essential metabolic processes such as carbonate genesis of corals. Inshore waters however, experience different spatial and temporal carbonate chemistry variability, raising questions over the future impact of OA within these habitats. It also remains unclear whether local biogeochemical conditions of some marine habitats can buffer, or provide a refuge against OA. The thesis systematically examines the response (<b>ecological</b> <b>abundance,</b> distribution, recruitment, and metabolic expenditure) of corals that have expanded their niche into variable pH habitats, to assess both {{the potential impact of}} OA and whether any habitats may act as a refuge against its effects by: (i) establishing robust methods to measure the local carbonate chemistry and the metabolic activity of corals in situ, (ii) characterising the natural carbonate chemistry variability over different temporal and spatial scales, and evaluating the biological versus abiotic control of non-reef habitats, (iii) quantifying the metabolic expenditure of corals living within non-reef habitats and assessing whether there are similarities in the physiological responses of corals existing in different regions to ascertain commonalities, and finally (iv) testing the impact of future predicted changes in temperature and pH on the physiological responses of corals from different variability habitats. The thesis demonstrates that across bioregion sites non-reef habitats exist that have highly variable carbonate chemistry but still house corals. These non-reef habitats have very different carbonate chemistry, influencing both their own susceptibility to future OA and their potential services (buffering versus pre-conditioning) for local coral populations. Future studies can expand on this work by assessing the molecular differences of corals found within these highly-variable habitats to explore further the potential of adaptation and/or acclimatisation of coral species to low pH...|$|E
40|$|Ceratopsians were herbivorous dinosaurs that {{dominated}} {{many of the}} terrestrial ecosystems in Asia and North America during the Cretaceous. The bizarre variety of skulls and lower jaw morphologies {{as well as the}} inferred <b>ecological</b> <b>abundance</b> of many species in this clade indicate that Ceratopsia was a successful group. Here we analyzed 126 lower jaws from 50 ceratopsian species, using two-dimensional geometric morphometrics and finite element analysis to investigate differences in shape and structural performance of this part of the feeding apparatus across Ceratopsia. Morphological differences in lower jaws across ceratopsian clades are said to originate from feeding adaptation. Our results show that the stress (physical loadings modeled in response to biting) in lower jaws was quite similar between “basal” and “derived” taxa, whereas major differences among clades occur for stress values associated with the coronoid process. The basal ceratopsians Hualianceratops and Yinlong had a highly stressed and primitive lower jaw, indicating that those animals may have fed on relatively soft foliage and fruits. A similar condition was found for basal neoceratopsians and protoceratopsids. Psittacosaurids possessed a well-integrated and compact lower jaw able to withstand high stress, at the cost of having a highly stressed coronoid process. Leptoceratopsids were characterized by the opposite condition. Taxa such as Leptoceratops, Prenoceratops, Zhuchengceratops and Cerasinops appear to have had a comparatively efficient feeding apparatus. Ceratopsidae represents the clade with the most efficient masticatory apparatus within Ceratopsia, even if the horizontal ramus of the lower jaw appears less able to withstand high levels of stress as compared with other ceratopsians. Additionally, we found the dentary and surangular–angular complex co-evolved to generate a masticatory apparatus able to withstand high stress, particularly in Protoceratopsidae and Triceratopsini. The major phenotypic evolutionary rate and morphological changes occurred during the mid- to Late Cretaceous, when intense climate change and angiosperm diversification could have affected the evolution of ecological diversity and feeding biomechanics in Ceratopsia. © 2017 Elsevier Lt...|$|E

METHODS First, we compared the <b>ecological</b> characteristics, <b>abundance</b> of phlebotomies and potential reservoir hosts in the peridomestic environment (100 m radius) of randomly selected houses, between two townships with high and low cutaneous leishmaniasis incidence. Second, we examined peridomestic correlates of phlebotomine abundance in all 43 houses in the higher risk township. RESULTS The high transmission township had higher coverage of forest (23 %vs. 8. 4 %) and shade coffee (30. 7 %vs. 11 %), and less coffee monoculture (16. 8 %vs. 26. 2 %) and pasture (6. 3 %vs. 12. 3 %), compared to the low transmission township. Lutzomyia were more abundant in the high transmission township 2. 5 vs. 0. 2 /trap/night. Lutzomyia longiflocosa {{was the most common}} species in both townships: 1021 / 1450 (70 %) and 39 / 80 (49 %).

40|$|The rate {{of genetic}} {{evolution}} is often too variable among lineages {{to be explained}} by a strict molecular clock, prompting alternative ecological and evolutionary hypotheses to explain this rate heterogeneity. One controversial hypothesis is that speciation provokes a burst of rapid genetic change, giving molecular evolution a punctuational component. The amount of root-to-tip genetic change therefore tends to increase {{with the number of}} identified speciation events (nodes) along the root-to-tip path in molecular phylogenies. The controversy arises because nodes on molecular phylogenies can typically only be counted if both descendants are extant. Here, using stratigraphic, phylogenetic and ecological data from the exceptional fossil record of Cenozoic macroperforate planktonic foraminifera, we test whether among-lineage rate heterogeneity is explained by <b>ecological</b> factors (<b>abundance,</b> life history and environment) and by the numbers of speciation events according to fossil lineage, fossil morphospecies and molecular species concepts. The number of nodes between root and tips on the fossil lineage phylogeny was a statistically significant correlate of the rate of molecular evolution over the same root-to-tip path. The speciation counts from other species concepts and hypothesized ecological drivers had considerably less support. Our results showcase how the fossil record contains signals of biological processes that drive genetic evolution, justifying calls to further marry fossil and molecular data when studying macroevolution over geological time-scales...|$|R
40|$|Abstract only. A {{resource}} {{assessment of}} sea cucumber {{was conducted in}} six out of eight coastal towns in northern Iloilo, a fisheries rich area facing the Visayan Sea in the central Philippines. A yearlong assessment was conducted in 2012. Fishery dependent survey {{was done with the}} use of survey questionnaire translated into dialect. Six trained enumerators administered the questionnaires to 114 gatherers and 18 local traders. Fishery independent survey involving Belt Transect Method (BTM) for intertidal areas and Timed-Search Method (TSM) for subtidal areas were conducted in 21 GPS (Global Positioning System) -referenced sampling stations. Sample specimens were also collected and prepared for taxonomic identification. External morphology, internal structures (dissected samples) and spicule analysis were used in the identification. Fishery dependent survey showed that gleaning (40 %) is the most dominant extraction method used. Various methods were also employed including the dangerous compressor diving and the destructive karas, a method using a rake-like device to scrape the sea bed. In terms of volume, the most heavily exploited sea cucumber belongs to the Stichopus groups. The trade of sea cucumber is dominated by island-based traders. Almost half of the traders are women, signifying that trading is a woman's domain as well. Derived monthly income from sea cucumber trade ranges from PhP 2, 000 - 3, 000 for gatherers and PhP 2, 000 - 5, 000 for the traders. Fishery independent survey resulted in the identification of six sea cucumber genera (Bohadschia, Holothuria, Paracaudina, Pseudocholochirus and Stichopus). Of the 32 species found belonging to the six genera, only 16 were identified up to the species level. Samples of unidentified specimen were sent to the University of the Philippines - Marine Science Institute (UP MSI) laboratory for molecular taxonomic identification. In terms of species count, the most dominant genera is the Holothuria with nine identified and seven unidentified species. H. impatiens is also the most dominant sea cucumber found in the area. Further, the recorded catch per unit effort (CPUE) for fishery-independent survey is 3 - 4 pcs/diver/hr. The resource assessment showed that the trade of sea cucumber is dictated by economic value rather than by <b>ecological</b> <b>abundance.</b> While the scale and extent of sea cucumber fishery in northern Iloilo is small-scale and island based, the study highlights the need for trade regulation and stock enhancement of heavily exploited species as extraction affects the ecological distribution of sea cucumber stocks in the area...|$|E

The {{published}} {{article is}} copyrighted by Ecological Society of America {{and can be}} found at: [URL] intermittent upwelling hypothesis (IUH) predicts that the strength of ecological subsidies, organismal growth responses, and species interactions will vary unimodally along a gradient of upwelling from persistent downwelling to persistent upwelling, with maximal levels at an intermediate or ‘‘intermittent’’ state of upwelling. To test this model, we employed the comparative-experimental method to investigate these processes at 16 – 44 wave-exposed rocky intertidal sites in Oregon, California, and New Zealand, varying in average upwelling and/or downwelling during spring–summer. As predicted by the IUH, <b>ecological</b> subsidies (phytoplankton <b>abundance,</b> prey recruitment rates), prey responses (barnacle colonization, mussel growth), and species interactions (competition rate, predation rate and effects) were unimodally related to upwelling. On average, unimodal relationships with upwelling magnitude explained 50...|$|R
40|$|Host {{specificity}} in the {{parasitic plant}} Cytinus hypocistis was quantified at four {{sites in the}} Algarve region of Portugal from 2002 to 2007. The parasite {{was found to be}} locally host specific, and only two hosts were consistently infected: Halimium halimifolium and Cistus monspeliensis. C. hypocistis did not infect hosts in proportion to their abundance; at three sites, 100 % of parasites occurred on H. halimifolium which represented just 42. 4 %, 3 % and 19. 7 % of potential hosts available, respectively. At the remaining site, where H. halimifolium was absent, 100 % of parasites occurred on C. monspeliensis which represented 81. 1 % of potential hosts available. Other species of potential host were consistently uninfected irrespective of their <b>abundance.</b> <b>Ecological</b> niche divergence of host plants H. halimifolium and C. monspeliensis may isolate host-specific races of C. hypocistis, thereby potentially driving allopatric divergence in this parasitic plant...|$|R
40|$|I {{investigated}} the <b>ecological</b> correlates of <b>abundance</b> in the Tana mangabey (Cercocebus galeritus), {{one of the}} world’s most endangered primates, {{with the goal of}} recommending management strategies. I systematically selected 31 forest fragments throughout the mangabey’s 60 -km distribution along the lower Tana River in southeastern Kenya. Within the 31 fragments, I measured vegetation structure, food abundance, and human forest product use in 107 belt transects, and conducted 370 mangabey surveys. I used a weighted multiple regression analysis to determine whether there was a dependence between the selected forest attributes and the mean number of mangabey groups per fragment. Fragment area and density of treesZ 10 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) were the only variables that significantly correlated with the variation in mangabey abundance. No additional variables were significant when the analysis was limited to forest fragments inside the Tana River Primate National Reserve (TRPNR) or to fragments outsid...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} sampling and methodological artefacts on the correlation between abundance and occupancy. Location:Global scope. Methods: A fixed effects weighted regression model was fitted to standardized effect size for 175 examples of correlations between abundance and occupancy. A regression tree model with standard effect size {{as the dependent variable}} was also fitted to the data. Results: Standard effect size, and therefore the correlation between abundance and occupancy, was found to be strongly influenced by the type of abundance measure used to characterize the abundance-occupancy relationship. Local mean abundance (also referred to as <b>ecological</b> mean <b>abundance)</b> was primarily responsible for negative correlations. Negative correlations also resulted from a mismatch in the sampling extents of abundance and occupancy measures. Main conclusions: The combination of abundance and occupancy measures selected to characterize the abundance-occupancy relationship for a given set of data has a profound impact on the sign of the correlation between the selected measures. Previous attempts to understand the processes giving rise to the pattern represented by the abundance-occupancy relationship have confounded sampling artefacts (e. g. spatial extent of abundance and occupancy information) and methodological artefacts (e. g. combining a truncated abundance measure such as local mean abundance with an untruncated occupancy measure such as proportion of occupied samples). Thus, a revision of the approach currently used to define and evaluate competing explanatory models of the abundance-occupancy relationship appears to be necessary. 8 page(s...|$|R
