5|$|Today some of {{the sharpest}} opening {{variations}} have been analyzed so <b>deeply</b> <b>that</b> they are often used as drawing weapons. For example, at the highest levels, Black often uses the Marshall Attack in the Ruy Lopez, a line where Black sacrifices a pawn for strong attacking chances, to obtain an endgame where Black is still a pawn down but is able to draw with correct play.|$|E
5|$|Seeking to {{circumvent}} this obstacle, Pyrrhus sent {{a force of}} 2,000 Gauls and some picked Chaonians under the commander of his son Ptolemy {{to go around the}} trench. These troops found their path blocked by the wagons which the Lacedaimonians had sunken into the soil. The wagons were planted so <b>deeply</b> <b>that</b> they hindered not only the Epiriote assault but also Spartan efforts to repel the foray. Eventually the Gauls managed to remove some of the wagons, giving them the opportunity to burst into the city. Acrotatus, seeing the danger, exploited a series of depressions in the terrain to lead a force of 300 men undetected against the Epiriote rear. This manoeuvre evoked panic amongst the Gauls who were compelled to abandon their attempt to enter the city and had to turn around to confront the attack to their rear. After a hard fought battle, the Epiriote flanking group was pushed back into the trench with heavy casualties inflicted upon them. The Spartans, elated by Arcotatus' leadership, told him to withdraw from the battle and return to Chilonis so as to beget more children like him for Sparta.|$|E

25|$|Although {{mathematics}} {{became more}} and more abstract and general throughout the 20th century, it was Alexander Grothendieck who was the greatest master of this trend.

25|$|Some {{classical}} rabbinical sources {{argue that}} Joseph identified himself for other reasons. In these sources, Benjamin swore an oath, on {{the memory of}} Joseph, that he was innocent of theft, and, when challenged about how believable the oath would be, explained that remembering Joseph {{was so important to}} him that he had named his sons in Joseph's honour. These sources go on to state that Benjamin's oath touched Joseph so <b>deeply</b> <b>that</b> Joseph was no longer able to pretend to be a stranger.|$|E
25|$|Four {{years after}} Henry Ball's death, DeDe Ball married Edward Peterson. While {{her mother and}} {{stepfather}} looked for work in another city, Lucy's stepfather’s parents cared for her brother and her. Ball's new guardians were a puritanical Swedish couple who banished all mirrors from the house except for one over the bathroom sink. When the young Ball was caught admiring herself in it, she was severely chastised for being vain. This period of time affected Ball so <b>deeply</b> <b>that,</b> in later life, she claimed that it lasted seven or eight years. Peterson was a Shriner.|$|E
25|$|Several {{hours later}} at 9.30 a.m., the {{mutilated}} bodies of Robb and McIlwaine were discovered lying in pools {{of blood on}} the roadside 100 metres apart from one another by a woman taking her children to dancing lessons. Because of the devastating stab wounds inflicted upon the teenagers, the RUC had assumed that McIlwaine had received a shotgun blast to his face. Both of their throats were slashed so <b>deeply</b> <b>that</b> the teenagers were nearly decapitated. The RUC immediately set up an inquiry into the killings. Post mortems revealed that Robb had sustained a severe cut throat injury to the neck and a penetrating wound to the abdomen with three penetrating wounds. There were no defence injuries. McIlwaine received a severe cut throat injury, seven penetrating wounds to the chest and penetrating wounds to the face and to the left eye. Both teenagers were intoxicated {{at the time of their}} deaths.|$|E

At the same time, they may attempt {{to back away from}} the threat towards cover. They may strike suddenly and fast, to the side as easily as forwards, before returning quickly to the defensive position, ready to strike again. During a strike, the force of the impact is so strong, and the long fangs penetrate so <b>deeply,</b> <b>that</b> prey items are often killed by the physical trauma alone. The fangs apparently can penetrate soft leather.|$|E
500|$|The metaphysical {{conflicts}} {{born from}} man's isolation {{are also important}} themes throughout the story, as the characters cannot rely on a higher cause or being for protection. The correspondent laments the lack of religious support, {{as well as his}} inability to blame God for his misfortunes, musing: [...] "When it occurs to a man that nature does not regard him as important, and that she feels she would not maim the universe by disposing of him, he at first wishes to throw bricks at the temple, and he hates <b>deeply</b> <b>that</b> there are no bricks and no temples." [...] Man's perception of himself and the world around him are also constantly questioned; the correspondent regularly refers to the way things [...] "seemed" [...] or [...] "appeared", leaving how a thing actually [...] "was" [...] entirely ambiguous. Wolford similarly pointed to the importance of the story's strong yet problematic opening line—"None of them knew the color of the sky"—as one that sets the scene for the story's sense of unease and uncertainty.|$|E

500|$|Lody's courageous {{demeanour}} {{in court}} produced widespread sympathy and admiration, {{a development that}} neither side had anticipated. Even his captors were captivated; although [...] had recommended his execution as early as 3 October, {{by the time the}} trial was over, Kell was said by his wife to have considered Lody a [...] "really fine man" [...] of whom Kell [...] "felt it <b>deeply</b> <b>that</b> so brave a man should have to pay the death penalty for carrying out what he considered to be his duty to his country." [...] Sir Basil Thomson of Scotland Yard commented that [...] "there was some difference of opinion as to whether it was sound policy to execute spies and to begin with a patriotic spy like Lody." [...] According to Robert Jackson, the biographer of Lody's prosecutor Sir Archibald Bodkin, Lody's [...] "bearing and frankness when caught so impressed Britain's spy-catchers and prosecutors that they talked about trying to get the Government to waive the internationally recognised rule that spies caught in wartime automatically are put to death. Only the certainty that Germany would not be as merciful to our own spies made them refrain." [...] Thomson also paid tribute to Lody in his 1937 book The Scene Changes: ...|$|E
500|$|Gray, {{considered}} by Darwin {{to be his}} friend and [...] "best advocate", also attempted to convince Darwin in his letters that design was inherent in all forms of life, and {{to return to his}} faith. Gray saw nature as filled with [...] "unmistakable and irresistible indications of design" [...] and argued that [...] "God himself is the very last, irreducible causal factor and, hence, the source of all evolutionary change." [...] Darwin agreed that his theories were [...] "not at all necessarily atheistical" [...] but was unable to share Gray's belief. [...] "I feel most <b>deeply</b> <b>that</b> the whole subject is too profound for the human intellect. A dog might as well speculate on the mind of Newton," [...] he wrote. Gray was a Christian, but he was a staunch supporter of Darwin in America. He collected together a number of his own writings to produce an influential book, Darwiniana (1876); these essays argued for a conciliation between Darwinian evolution and the tenets of theism, {{at a time when many}} on both sides perceived the two as mutually exclusive. Gray denied that investigation of physical causes stood opposed to the theological view and the study of the harmonies between mind and Nature, and thought it [...] "most presumable that an intellectual conception realized in Nature would be realized through natural agencies". The result of all this is that Gray distanced himself from Social Darwinism. Gray is a critical link in the history of American intellectualism, and his writings that explain how religion and science were not necessarily mutually exclusive have been considered his supreme accomplishment; thereby providing a way for believers in Creationism to consider Darwin's ideas.|$|E
500|$|Taare Zameen Par {{received}} several positive reviews. Subhash K. Jha {{suggests that the}} film is [...] "a work of art, a water painting where the colors drip into our hearts, which could easily have fallen into the motions of over-sentimentality. Aamir Khan holds back where he could easily resort to an extravagant display of drama and emotions." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN argued that the true power of the film lies in its [...] "remarkable, rooted, rock-solid script which provides the landscape for such an emotionally engaging, heart-warming experience." [...] Manish Gajjar from the BBC stated that the film [...] "touches your heart and moves you deeply with its sterling performances. [...] a film full of substance!" [...] Jaspreet Pandohar, also of BBC, posited that Taare Zameen Par is a [...] "far cry from the formulaic masala flicks churned out by the Bollywood machine," [...] and is [...] "an inspirational story that is as emotive as it is entertaining; {{this is a little}} twinkling star of a movie." [...] Furthermore, Aprajita Anil of Screen gave the film four stars and stated, [...] "Taare Zameen Par cannot be missed. Because it is different. Because it is delightful. Because it would make everyone think. Because it would help everyone grow. Because very rarely do performances get so gripping. And of course because the 'perfectionist' actor has shaped into a 'perfectionist' director." [...] In addition, filmmaker Anurag Kashyap stated that, [...] "Taare Zameen Par took me back to my hostel days. If you take away the dyslexia, it seems like my story. The film affected me so <b>deeply</b> <b>that</b> I was almost left speechless. After watching the film, I was asked how I liked Taare Zameen Par. I could not talk as I was deeply overwhelmed." ...|$|E
