The paper {{presents}} a method enabling {{calculation of the}} radial and serial capacitance, inductance and voltage between adjacent coils of the power transformer continuous <b>disc</b> <b>winding.</b> Definition of the equivalent electric circuit {{is based on the}} assumption of a short circuit and grounded winding next to the iron core.

The inductance is obtained from the stray magnetic field in the transformer window calculated in the FEMM 4. 2 computer code. The equivalent circuit with respect to the 1 st and 2 nd Kirchhoff’s law gives two systems of ordinary differential equations for the voltage and current that are solved using MATLAB calculation.

40|$|Conjugate heat {{transfer}} {{problem of a}} <b>disc</b> <b>winding</b> in a power transformer is studied using commercial CFD software. The study is done for oil flow, temperature distribution, hot spot location and temperature of the winding, for three different cases: first, no oil leakage past the top washer; second, partial leakage due to a 2 mm gap between the top oil guiding washer and cylindrical pressboard; third, full leakage, i. e., no oil guiding washer. The effect of leakage is studied for both uniform and non-uniform heat loss distributions in the winding. The leakage is found to lead to an onset of a reversal in flow direction: in the horizontal channels of the last pass of the winding. Under the effect of leakage, the variation in thermal performance of the winding is substantial for uniform and negligible for more practically encountered non-uniform heat loss distribution. However, for non-uniform heat loss distribution, the leakage leads to two local hotpots as compared to one for the non-leakage case. The partial as compared to complete leakage is found to give almost same thermal performance. This study will be useful - for transformer manufacturers - to {{realize the importance of}} leakage free washer design of a disc-type transformer winding. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The resulting code is designed to be used primarily in the context of non-spherical wind models, where its fully three-dimensional nature and elimination of assumptions made by codes based on approximate analytical solutions are of particular importance. A detailed description of the method is given as an Appendix. Applying our method to the UV resonance lines formed in the winds of cataclysmic variable stars, we have constructed a new kinematic <b>disc</b> <b>wind</b> model, in which the outflow emanates {{from the surface of the}} rotating accretion disc and has a biconical geometry. In this, it is assumed that specific angular momentum is conserved along streamlines. Within the parameter space of the model, a wide range of outflow geometries can be explored. An exploration is begun here in considering the extent to which a <b>disc</b> <b>wind</b> model can better explain phenomena that are difficult to accommodate within simpler, more approximate central wind models (with or without rotation). Our main findings are as follows. (i) Line profiles calculated from <b>disc</b> <b>wind</b> models are qualitatively consistent with observed UV line shapes. In particular, <b>disc</b> <b>winds</b> can give rise to low-inclination profiles which show maximum absorption near line centre even in the limit of constant outflow velocity. This behaviour can be reproduced by central wind models only on resorting to very slow wind acceleration. (ii) At high inclinations, <b>disc</b> <b>winds</b> can naturally give rise to the pure emission-line profiles that are seen in observations. Instead of the broadened, blueshifted absorption that tends to persist in profiles synthesized from central wind models, many high-inclination <b>disc</b> <b>wind</b> profiles show sharp reversals (`dips') cutting into a broader underlying wind emission line. If observed, these dips may be used as indicators for a biconical wind geometry, and their offset from line centre may allow the degree of wind collimation to be estimated. (iii) We confirm a result of earlier work that the introduction of a rotational velocity component into the outflow can broaden the line emission component, and reduce its core intensity at high inclination. The rotational component of motion only becomes important in shaping the line profile in highly collimated <b>disc</b> <b>winds</b> viewed at high inclination, in which it determines the apparent linewidth. (iv) <b>Disc</b> <b>wind</b> line profiles are sensitive to the overall wind geometry and the bias of mass loss towards the peak of the disc's radial energy distribution. There is also considerable sensitivity to the introduction of an outflow velocity gradient. In more collimated <b>disc</b> <b>winds,</b> gradual acceleration can cause high-inclination profiles to approach the double-peaked shape characteristic of rotating line-emitting media...|$|R
30|$|Different {{theoretical}} {{models have been}} proposed to explain the outflows from protostars and CTTSs (see review by Ferreira et al. [2006]). The commonly favored model for the origin of protostellar jets and outflows are the radially distributed magneto-centrifugal <b>disc</b> <b>winds</b> which originate from discs threaded by a poloidal magnetic field (Blandford and Payne [1982]; Königl and Pudritz [2000]).

However, the exact physical processes involved are not yet fully understood. We present high angular and spectral resolution observations of the Br Gamma emitting region in the Herbig Ae star HD 163296 (MWC 275) in order to probe {{the origin of this}} line and constrain the physical processes taking place at sub-AU scales in the circumstellar region. By means of VLTI-AMBER observations at high spectral resolution (R~ 12000), we studied interferometric visibilities, wavelength-differential phases, and closure phases across the Br Gamma line of HD 163296. To constrain the physical origin of the Br Gamma line in Herbig Ae stars, all the interferometric observables were compared with the predictions of a line radiative transfer <b>disc</b> <b>wind</b> model. The measured visibilities clearly increase within the Br Gamma line, indicating that the Br Gamma emitting region is more compact than the continuum. By fitting a geometric Gaussian model to the continuum-corrected Br Gamma visibilities, we derived a compact radius of the Br Gamma emitting region of ~ 0. 07 +/- 0. 02 AU (Gaussian half width at half maximum; or a ring-fit radius of ~ 0. 08 +/- 0. 02 AU). To interpret the observations, we developed a magneto-centrifugally driven <b>disc</b> <b>wind</b> model. Our best <b>disc</b> <b>wind</b> model is able to reproduce, within the errors, all the interferometric observables and it predicts a launching region with an outer radius of ~ 0. 04 AU.

Our observations, along with a detailed modelling of the Br Gamma emitting region, suggest that most of the Br Gamma emission in HD 163296 originates from a <b>disc</b> <b>wind</b> with a launching region that is over five times more compact than previous estimates of the continuum dust rim radius.

40|$|Recent {{ultraviolet}} (UV) observations {{suggest that}} there is a hot (T(e) similar or equal to 80 000 K) and dense (Ne similar or equal to 10 (10) cm(- 3)) wind associated with the large-scale jets observed in classical T Tauri stars (cTTSs). The observations of these rather evolved sources cannot be fitted with the classical cold <b>disc</b> <b>wind</b> solutions. This is not unexpected since the accretion rates are moderate (<= 10 (- 8) M-circle dot yr(- 1)) and the wind lighter than at earlier phases. Henceforth, X-ray radiation from the star and the star-disc interaction region is expected to modify the thermal structure of the inner disc, e. g. the base of the <b>disc</b> <b>wind.</b> Thus, thermal pressure is relevant to load gas on the field lines. In this work, we analyse whether warm <b>disc</b> <b>winds</b> can account for these UV observations. To get a good hint on the physics, we have preferred to focus on analytical work. We have made use of the warm <b>disc</b> <b>wind</b> solution with pressure calculated by Vlahakis et al. The rich complexity of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) <b>disc</b> <b>wind</b> kinematics is analysed in detail. We show the following. (i) Warm disc flows departing from the inner disc radius (similar to 0. 1 au) reach terminal velocities close to the observed (300 km s(- 1)) and that the temperature {{at the base of the}} wind is similar to 40 000 K. Thus, the spectral signature of warm <b>disc</b> <b>winds</b> is an enhancement of the chromospheric and transition region spectral indicators by several orders of magnitude, as observed in cTTSs. (ii) Warm <b>disc</b> <b>winds</b> rotate, but their rotation velocity is small since the wind dynamics is based in a transference of angular momentum from the star to the magnetic field. Henceforth, slow rotation plus high temperature (e. g. rotational broadening) show in very broad profiles at the base of the wind. (iii) The kinematics at the base of the wind is dominated by axial expansion; however, above z similar or equal to 5 au, the dominant kinematical component is acceleration along the disc axis. (iv) The most often observed profile is a single-peaked line, slightly blueshifted and asymmetric with a tail to short wavelengths. The full width at half-maximum is clearly suprathermal and depends on the spectral tracer used. Line profiles, fluxes and line ratios are calculated for the C IV[uv 1], C II 1908, C II](2326), Si III](1892) and [O II](2471) UV lines. In edge-on systems, the profiles range from symmetric lines with suprathermal broadenings for the spectral tracers of the base of the wind (C IV[uv 1] and Si II](1892)) to double-peaked profiles for spectral tracers more weighted to higher values of z ([O II] and C II]). In pole-on systems, the profiles are blueshifted (from few to 200 km s(- 1)) and asymmetric exhibiting long tails towards the terminal velocity of the wind (V-rad= 300 km s(- 1)). To reproduce the observed line fluxes and ratios, winds must be clumpy and extinction by the flaring <b>disc</b> and the <b>wind</b> itself ought to be taken into account...|$|R
40|$|We perform multidimensional {{radiative}} transfer simulations to compute spectra for a hydrodynamical simulation of a line-driven accretion <b>disc</b> <b>wind</b> from an active galactic nucleus. The synthetic spectra confirm expectations from parametrized models that a <b>disc</b> <b>wind</b> can imprint {{a wide variety}} of spectroscopic signatures including narrow absorption lines, broad emission lines and a Compton hump. The formation of these features is complex with contributions originating from many of the different structures present in the hydrodynamical simulation. In particular, spectral features are shaped both by gas in a successfully launched outflow and in complex flows where material is lifted out of the disc plane but ultimately falls back. We also confirm that the strong Fe Kα line can develop a weak, red-skewed line wing as a result of Compton scattering in the outflow. In addition, we demonstrate that X-ray radiation scattered and reprocessed in the flow has a pivotal part in both the spectrum formation and determining the ionization conditions in the wind. We find that scattered radiation is rather effective in ionizing gas which is shielded from direct irradiation from the central source.

40|$|A simple 1 D {{dynamical}} {{model of}} thermally driven <b>disc</b> <b>winds</b> is proposed, {{based on the}} results of recent, 2. 5 D axi-symmetric simulations. Our formulation of the <b>disc</b> <b>wind</b> problem is in the spirit of the original Parker (1958) and Bondi (1952) problems, namely we assume an elementary flow configuration consisting of an outflow following pre-defined trajectories in the presence of a central gravitating point mass. Viscosity and heat conduction are neglected. We consider two different streamline geometries, both comprised of straight lines in the (x,z) -plane: (i) streamlines that converge to a geometric point located at (x,z) =(0,-d) and (ii) streamlines that emerge at a constant inclination angle from the disc midplane (the x-axis, as we consider geometrically thin accretion discs). The former geometry is commonly used in kinematic models to compute synthetic spectra, while the latter, which exhibits self-similarity, is likely unused for this purpose, although it easily can be with existing kinematic models. We make the case that it should be, i. e. that geometry (ii) leads to transonic wind solutions with substantially different properties owing to its lack of streamline divergence. Both geometries can be used to complement recent efforts to estimate photoevaporative mass loss rates from protoplanetary discs. Pertinent to understanding our <b>disc</b> <b>wind</b> results, which are also applicable to X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei, is a focused discussion on lesser known properties of classic Parker wind solutions. We find that the parameter space corresponding to decelerating Parker wind solutions is made larger due to rotation and leads instead to <b>disc</b> <b>wind</b> solutions that always accelerate after the bulk velocity is slowed to a minimum value. Surprisingly, Keplerian rotation may allow for two different transonic wind solutions for the same physical conditions. Comment: 30 pages, 13 figures, accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|R
40|$|Observations of jets {{from young}} stellar objects reveal the {{asymmetric}} outflows from some sources. A large set of 2. 5 D MHD simulations {{has been carried}} out for axisymmetric viscous/diffusive disc accretion to rotating magnetized stars for the purpose of assessing the conditions where the outflows or jets are asymmetric relative to the equatorial plane. We consider initial magnetic fields that are symmetric about the equatorial plane and consist of a radially distributed field threading the disc (disc-field) and a stellar dipole field. (1). For pure disc-fields the symmetry or asymmetry of the outflows is affected by the midplane plasma β of the disc (where β is the ratio of the plasma pressure to the magnetic pressure). For the low density discs with small plasma β values, outflows are observed to be symmetric to within 10 % over timescales of hundreds of inner disc orbits. For the denser higher β discs, the coupling of the upper and lower coronal plasmas is broken, and quasi-periodic field motion in the two hemispheres becomes different. This asymmetry leads to asymmetric episodic outflows. (2.) Accreting stars with a stellar dipole field and no disc-field exhibit episodic, two component outflows - a magnetospheric wind and an inner <b>disc</b> <b>wind</b> from somewhat larger radial distances. Both are characterized by similar velocity profiles but the magnetospheric wind has densities ≳ 10 times that of the <b>disc</b> <b>wind.</b> (3.)

40|$|Aims: We {{investigate}} {{the evolution of}} protoplanetary discs (PPDs hereafter) with magnetically driven <b>disc</b> <b>winds</b> and viscous heating. Methods: We consider an initially massive disc with ~ 0. 1 Msun to track the evolution from the early stage of PPDs. We solve the time evolution of surface density and temperature by taking into account viscous heating {{and the loss of}} the mass and the angular momentum by the <b>disc</b> <b>winds</b> within the framework of a standard alpha model for accretion discs. Our model parameters, turbulent viscosity, <b>disc</b> <b>wind</b> mass loss, and <b>disc</b> <b>wind</b> torque, which are adopted from local magnetohydrodynamical simulations and constrained by the global energetics of the gravitational accretion, largely depends on the physical condition of PPDs, particularly on the evolution of the vertical magnetic flux in weakly ionized PPDs. Results: Although there are still uncertainties concerning the evolution of the vertical magnetic flux remaining, surface densities show a large variety, depending on the combination of these three parameters, some of which are very different from the surface density expected from the standard accretion. When a PPD is in a "wind-driven accretion" state with the preserved vertical magnetic field, the radial dependence of the surface density can be positive in the inner region < 1 - 10 au. The mass accretion rates are consistent with observations, even in the very low level of magnetohydrodynamical turbulence. Such a positive radial slope of the surface density gives a great impact on planet formation because (i) it inhibits the inward drift or even results in the outward drift of pebble/boulder-sized solid bodies, and (ii) it also makes the inward type-I migration of proto-planets slower or even reversed. Conclusions: The variety of our calculated PPDs should yield a wide variety of exoplanet systems. Comment: 16 pages, 11 figures embedded, accepted by A&A (comments are welcome...|$|R

40|$|Outflows are {{ubiquitous}} in accreting systems across 10 {{orders of magnitude}} in mass, and there is good evidence that mass-loaded winds are launched from the accretion discs of quasars and cataclysmic variables (CVs). Perhaps the most spectacular evidence for accretion <b>disc</b> <b>winds</b> is the blue-shifted, broad absorption lines (BALs) in UV resonance lines, seen in CVs and the BAL quasars. As well as imprinting absorption features, <b>disc</b> <b>winds</b> may affect the line and continuum emission from accreting objects. They thus offer a natural way to unify much of the phenomenology of CVs and active galactic nuclei (AGN). In this thesis, I use a state-of-the-art Monte Carlo radiative transfer (MCRT) code, Python, to conduct a series of simulations designed to test simple biconical <b>disc</b> <b>wind</b> models. I outline the MCRT techniques used, before describing a series of code validation exercises. Having tested my methods thoroughly, I explore whether the winds {{that are responsible for}} the UV BALs in high-state CVs could also {{have an effect on the}} optical spectrum. I find that the wind produces strong emission in the Balmer series, He ii 4686 A and a series of He i lines. The model shows the observed trends with inclination and in some cases produces sufficient recombination continuum emission to fill in the Balmer photoabsorption edge intrinsic to disc atmospheres. The results suggest that <b>disc</b> <b>winds</b> could have a significant impact on the optical spectra of high-state CVs. The next step was to apply the techniques to quasar winds in a test of <b>disc</b> <b>wind</b> unification models. In previous efforts, the ouflow tended to become 'over-ionized', and BAL features were only present if the X-ray luminosity was limited to around 1043 erg s- 1. The outflow also failed to produce significant line emission. Motivated by these problems, I introduce a simple treatment of clumping and find that it allows BAL features to form in the rest-frame UV at more realistic X-ray luminosities. The fiducial model shows good agreement with AGN X-ray properties and the wind produces strong line emission. Despite these successes, the model cannot reproduce all emission lines seen in quasar spectra with the correct equivalent width (EW) ratios, and I find the emission line EWs have a strong dependence on inclination. Informed by the quasar wind modelling, I examine the emission line EW distributions of quasars in the context of geometric unification. I find that the observed distributions are not consistent with a model in which an equatorial BAL outflow rises from a foreshortened accretion disc. I discuss this finding in the context of other observational orientation indicators. Finally, I summarise my findings and suggest avenues for future work. Overall, the work presented here suggests that <b>disc</b> <b>winds</b> matter. They not only act as a spectral 'filter' for the underlying accretion continuum, but may actually dominate the emergent spectrum from accreting objects. As a result, unveiling their driving mechanisms, mass-loss rates and ionization structure is an important goal for the astronomical community...|$|R
40|$|Cool {{magnetohydrodynamics}} (MHD) <b>disc</b> <b>wind</b> {{physics is}} reviewed {{by means of}} a self-similar analytical model, putting special emphasis on the mathematical aspects of the solution. It is found that the key parameter of the theory (mu) measures the relation between magnetic and tidal forces. The generation of MHD <b>winds</b> from accretion <b>discs</b> requires a subtle tuning between both stresses because only a narrow range of mu values is allowed; this range is, indeed, close to the cut-off of the magnetic turbulence induced by the development of the Balbus-Hawley instability. The space of solutions can be separated into two quite distinct classes: low -musolutions generate magnetically dominated outflows and display a characteristic density change from horizontal to vertical stratification, while in high -musolutions the density decreases without any intermediate enhancement as the rotation axis is approached. These theoretical (dynamical) results have been used to study the properties of the base of the wind. Density and velocity laws have been derived directly from the dynamics. The effect of the propagation of the stellar X-ray radiation through the wind has been analysed to determine the temperature law {{at the base of the}} wind (polar angles theta > 45 degrees). It is shown that a cocoon of photoionized gas is generated around the star. The extent of the photoionized region is small (tenths of au) in dense outflows and close to the disc plane; however, it may cover the whole wind extent in diffuse <b>winds,</b> e. g. <b>disc</b> <b>winds</b> generated by small accretion rates (less than or equal to 10 (- 9) M-circle dot yr(- 1)). Photoionization also modifies the electron density in the plasma. As a consequence, the ambipolar diffusion heating decreases in the inner part of the wind by roughly one order of magnitude with respect to that derived by other authors. In fact, radiative heating controls the thermal properties of the inner 0. 3 and 1 au of the <b>disc</b> <b>wind</b> for accretion rates of 10 (- 7) and 10 (- 8) M-circle dot yr(- 1), respectively. The temperature of the densest region (base) of the wind is, at most, similar or equal to 10 000 K. Therefore, although densities as high as similar to 10 (9) cm(- 3) can be achieved by <b>disc</b> <b>winds,</b> the temperature is significantly smaller than the similar to 5 x 10 (5) - 8 x 10 (5) K derived from the ultraviolet (UV) observations of the base of the optical jets. Also, it is shown that densities as high as similar to 10 (9) cm(- 3) cannot be achieved at the jet recollimation point for the accretion rates observed in the T Tauri stars.

We combine a series of 1. 5 D semi-analytic, steady-state, vertical disc-wind solutions into a radially extended 1 + 1. 5 D model, incorporating all three diffusion mechanisms (Ohm, Hall and ambipolar). We observe that the majority of mass outflow via <b>disc</b> <b>winds</b> occurs over a radial width of a fraction of an astronomical unit, with outflow rates attenuating rapidly on either side. We also find that the mass accretion rate, magnetic field strength and surface density profile each have significant effects on both the location of the wind-launching region and the ejection/accretion ratio Ṁ_ out/Ṁ_ in. Increasing either the accretion rate or the magnetic field strength corresponds to a shift of the wind-launching region to smaller radii and a decrease in Ṁ_ out/Ṁ_ in, while increasing the surface density corresponds to launching regions at larger radii with increased Ṁ_ out/Ṁ_ in. Finally, we discover a class of <b>disc</b> <b>winds</b> containing an ineffective launching configuration at intermediate radii, leading to two radially separated regions of wind launching and diminished Ṁ_ out/Ṁ_ in.

40|$|Recent {{interferometric}} {{observations of}} the young stellar object(YSO) HH 30 have revealed a low velocity outflow in the ^ 12 CO J= 1 - 2 molecule line (Pety et al. 2006). We present here two models of the low velocity <b>disc</b> <b>winds</b> {{with the aim of}} investigating an origin of this molecular outflow. Following Andlada et al. (2006) we treated HH 30 as a binary system. Two cases have been considered: i) the orbital period P = 53 yrs and ii) P < 1 yr. Calculations showed that in the first case the outflow cone had a spiral-like structure due to summing the velocities of the orbital motion and the <b>disc</b> <b>wind.</b> Such a structure contradicts the observations. In the second case, the outflow cone demonstrates a symmetry relatively to the system axis and agrees well with the observations. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figures. accepted by Mon. Not. R. Astron.

We present analytical kinematic predictions valid soon after the Alfvén surface {{for all types of}} steady magnetically self-confined jets. Results. We show that extended <b>disc</b> <b>winds,</b> X-winds, and stellar winds occupy distinct regions in the poloidal speed vs. specific angular momentum plane. Comparisons with current observations of T Tauri jets yield quantitative constraints on the range of launching radii, magnetic lever arms, and specific energy input in <b>disc</b> and stellar <b>winds.</b> Implications on the origin of jet asymmetries and disc magnetic fields are outlined. Conclusions. We argue that ejection phenomena from accreting T Tauri stars most likely include three dynamical components: (1) an outer self-collimated steady <b>disc</b> <b>wind</b> carrying most of the mass-flux in the optical jet (when present), confining (2) a pressure-driven coronal stellar wind and (3) a hot inner flow made of blobs sporadically ejected from the magnetopause. If the stellar magnetic moment is parallel to the disc magnetic field, then the highly variable inner flow resembles a ”Reconnection X-wind”, that has been proven to efficiently brake down an accreting and contracting young star. If the magnetic moment is anti-parallel, then larger versions of the solar coronal mass ejections are likely to occur. The relative importance of these three components in the observed outflows and the range of radii involved in the <b>disc</b> <b>wind</b> are expected to vary with time, from the stage of embedded source to the optically revealed T Tauri star phase.

40|$|Photoevaporation of protoplanetary discs by {{high energy}} {{radiation}} from the central young stellar object is currently the favourite model to explain the sudden dispersal of discs from the inside out. While several theoretical works have provided a detailed pictured of this process, the direct observational validation is still lacking. Emission lines produced in these slow moving protoplanetary <b>disc</b> <b>winds</b> may bear the imprint of the wind structure and thus provide a potential diagnostic of the underlying dispersal process. In this paper we primarily focus on the collisionally excited neutral oxygen line at 6300 A. We compare our models predictions to observational data and demonstrate a thermal origin for the observed blueshifted low-velocity component of this line from protoplanetary discs. Furthermore our models show that while this line is a clear tell-tale-sign of a warm, quasi-neutral <b>disc</b> <b>wind,</b> typical of X-ray photoevaporation, its strong temperature dependence makes it unsuitable to measure detailed wind quantities like mass-loss-rate.

40|$|A {{succession}} of near-IR spectroscopic observations, taken nightly throughout an entire cycle of SS 433 's orbit, reveal (i) the persistent signature of SS 433 's accretion disc, having a rotation speed of ~ 500 km/s, (ii) {{the presence of}} the circumbinary disc recently discovered at optical wavelengths by Blundell, Bowler and Schmidtobreick (2008) and (iii) a much faster outflow than has previously been measured for the <b>disc</b> <b>wind.</b> From these, we find a much faster accretion <b>disc</b> <b>wind</b> than has noted before, with a terminal velocity of ~ 1500 km/s. The increased wind terminal velocity results in a mass-loss rate of ~ 10 e- 4 M_sun/yr. These, together with the newly (upwardly) determined masses for the components of the SS 433 system, result in an accurate diagnosis {{of the extent to which}} SS 433 has super-Eddington flows. Our observations imply that the size of the companion star is comparable with the semi-minor axis of the orbit which is given by (1 -e^ 2) ^(1 / 2) 40 R_sun, where e is the eccentricity. Our relatively high spectral resolution at these near-IR wavelengths has enabled us to deconstruct the different components that comprise the Brackett-gamma line in this binary system, and their physical origins. With this line dominated throughout our series of observations by the <b>disc</b> <b>wind,</b> and the accretion disc itself being only a minority (~ 15 per cent) contribution, we caution against use of the unresolved Brackett-gamma line intensity as an "accretion signature" in X-ray binaries or microquasars in any quantitative way.

40|$|We present multidimensional non-LTE {{radiative}} transfer models of {{hydrogen and helium}} line profiles formed in the accretion flows and the outflows near the star-disk interaction regions of classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs). The statistical equilibrium calculations, performed under the assumption of the Sobolev approximation using the {{radiative transfer}} code TORUS, has been improved to include He I and He II energy levels. This allows us to probe the physical conditions of the inner wind of CTTSs by simultaneously modelling the robust wind diagnostic line He I (10830) and the accretion diagnostic lines such as Pa-beta, Br-gamma and He I (5876). The code has been tested in 1 and 2 -D problems, and we {{have shown that the}} results are in agreement with established codes. We apply the model to the complex flow geometries of CTTSs. Example model profiles are computed using the combinations of (1) magnetospheric accretion and <b>disc</b> <b>wind,</b> and (2) magnetospheric accretion and the stellar wind. In both cases, the model produces line profiles which are qualitatively similar to those found in observations. Our models are consistent with the scenario in which the narrow blueshifted absorption component of He I (10830) seen in observations is caused by a <b>disc</b> <b>wind,</b> and the wider blueshifted absorption component (the P-Cygni profile) is caused by a bipolar stellar wind. However, {{we do not have a}} strong constraint on the relative importance of the wind and the magnetosphere for the `emission' component. Our preliminary calculations suggest that the temperatures of the <b>disc</b> <b>wind,</b> stellar wind and the magnetosphere cannot be much higher than ~ 10, 000 K, on the basis of the strengths of hydrogen lines. With these low temperatures, we find that the photoionzation by high energy photons (e. g. X-rays) is necessary to produce He I (10830) in emission and to produce the blueshifted absorption components. Comment: 18 pages, 12 figures, accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|R

40|$|We present optical {{spectroscopy}} of the microquasar SS 433 {{covering a}} significant {{fraction of a}} precessional cycle of its jet axis. The components of the prominent stationary H-alpha and H-beta lines are mainly identified as arising from three emitting regions: (i) a super-Eddington accretion <b>disc</b> <b>wind,</b> {{in the form of}} a broad component accounting for most of the mass loss from the system, (ii) a circumbinary disc of material that we presume is being excreted through the binary's L 2 point, and (iii) the accretion disc itself as two remarkably persistent components. The accretion disc components move with a Keplerian velocity of ~ 600 km/s in the outer region of the disc. A direct result of this decomposition is the determination of the accretion disc size, whose outer radius attains ~ 8 R_sun in the case of Keplerian orbits around a black hole mass of 10 M_sun. We determine an upper limit for the accretion disc inner to outer radius ratio in SS 433, R_in/R_out ~ 0. 2, independent of the mass of the compact object. The Balmer decrements, H-alpha/H-beta, are extracted from the appropriate stationary emission lines for each component of the system. The physical parameters of the gaseous components are derived. The circumbinary ring decrement seems to be quite constant throughout precessional phase, implying a constant electron density of log N_e(cm^- 3) ~ 11. 5 for the circumbinary disc. The accretion <b>disc</b> <b>wind</b> shows a larger change in its decrements exhibiting a clear dependence on precessional phase, implying a sinusoid variation in its electron density log N_e(cm^- 3) along our line-of-sight between 10 and 13. This dependence of density on direction suggests that the accretion <b>disc</b> <b>wind</b> is polloidal in nature. Comment: 7 pages, 5 figures. Accepted for publication in MNRAS Main Journal...|$|R

40|$|Two XMM-Newton {{observations}} of the black-hole binary GRS 1915 + 105 were triggered in 2004 (April 17 and 21), during a long "plateau" state of the source. We analyzed the data collected with EPIC-pn in Timing and Burst modes, respectively. No thermal disc emission is required by the data; the spectrum is well fitted by four components: a primary component (either a simple power law or thermal Comptonization) absorbed by cold matter with abundances different than those of standard ISM; reprocessing from an ionized disc; emission and absorption lines; and a soft X-ray excess around 1 keV.

40|$|The {{interaction}} between a protostellar magnetosphere and a surrounding dynamo-active accretion disc is investigated using an axisymmetric mean-field model. In all models investigated, the dynamo-generated magnetic {{field in the}} disc arranges itself such that in the corona, the field threading the disc is anti-aligned with the central dipole so that no X-point forms. When the magnetospheric field is strong enough (stellar surface field strength around 2 kG or larger), accretion happens in a recurrent fashion with periods of around 15 to 30 days, which is somewhat longer than the stellar rotation period of around 10 days. In {{the case of a}} stellar surface field strength of at least a few 100 G, the star is being spun up by the magnetic torque exerted on the star. The stellar accretion rates are always reduced by the presence of a magnetosphere which tends to divert a much larger fraction of the disc material into the wind. Both, a pressure-driven stellar <b>wind</b> and a <b>disc</b> <b>wind</b> form. In all our models with disc dynamo, the <b>disc</b> <b>wind</b> is structured and driven by magneto-centrifugal as well as pressure forces.
