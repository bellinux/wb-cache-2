25|$|Most {{currently}} available genes used to engineer insect resistance {{come from the}} Bacillus thuringiensis bacterium. Most are {{in the form of}} <b>delta</b> <b>endotoxin</b> genes known as cry proteins, while a few use the genes that encode for vegetative insecticidal proteins. Insect resistant crops target various species of coleopteran (beetles) and lepidopteran (moths). The only gene commercially used to provide insect protection that does not originate from B. thuringiensis is the Cowpea trypsin inhibitor (CpTI). CpTI was first approved for use cotton in 1999 and is currently undergoing trials in rice.|$|E
50|$|<b>Delta</b> <b>endotoxin</b> Cry3Bb1 is {{utilized}} as an insecticide that confers {{resistance to}} coleopteran insects - particularly the corn rootworm - by selectively damaging their midgut lining.|$|E
50|$|Today, {{the term}} 'endotoxin' is mostly used synonymously with LPS, {{although}} {{there are a few}} endotoxins that are not related to LPS, such as the so-called <b>delta</b> <b>endotoxin</b> proteins secreted by Bacillus thuringiensis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Delta</b> <b>endotoxins</b> (δ-endotoxins, {{also called}} Cry and Cyt toxins) are pore-forming toxins {{produced}} by Bacillus thuringiensis species of bacteria. They {{are useful for}} their insecticidal action.|$|R
50|$|Transgenic Bt cotton {{initially}} {{expressed a}} single Bt gene, which codes for Cry1Ac. Subsequently, Bt cotton has added other <b>delta</b> <b>endotoxins.</b> Products such as Bt cotton, Bt brinjal and {{genetically modified maize}} have received attention due {{to a number of}} issues, including genetically modified food controversies, and the Séralini affair.|$|R
50|$|Cry1Ac {{protoxin}} is {{a crystal}} protein {{produced by the}} bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) during sporulation. Cry1Ac {{is one of the}} <b>delta</b> <b>endotoxins</b> produced by this bacterium which act as insecticides. Because of this, the genes for these have been introduced into commercially important crops by genetic engineering (e.g. cotton and tomato by Monsanto) in order to confer pest resistance on those plants.|$|R
50|$|MON 863 is {{a genetically}} {{engineered}} variety of maize produced by Monsanto. It is genetically altered {{to express a}} modified version of Cry3Bb1, a <b>delta</b> <b>endotoxin</b> which originates from Bacillus thuringiensis. This protects the plant from corn rootworm. Unlike MON 810, Bt 11, and Bt 176 which each produce a modified Cry1Ab, MON 863 instead produces a modified Cry3Bb1 toxin and contains nptII, a marker gene for antibiotic resistance.|$|E
50|$|The Belgian company Plant Genetic Systems (now part of Bayer CropScience) was {{the first}} company (in 1985) to develop genetically {{modified}} crops (tobacco) with insect tolerance by expressing cry genes from B. thuringiensis; the resulting crops contain <b>delta</b> <b>endotoxin.</b> The Bt tobacco was never commercialized; tobacco plants are used to test genetic modifications since {{they are easy to}} manipulate genetically and {{are not part of the}} food supply.|$|E
30|$|The crystal, {{referred}} to as Cry toxin (cry from crystal), insecticidal crystal protein, parasporal body, crystalline inclusion, or <b>delta</b> <b>endotoxin,</b> is a protein formed during sporulation in Bt strains and aggregate to form crystals. Such Cry toxins are toxic to specific species of insects belonging to Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Diptera, and Nematoda. They are harmless to human, vertebrates, and natural enemies of insects (Hofte and Whitely 1989).|$|E
50|$|These genetically {{modified}} plants with Bt toxin are grown {{on a large}} scale around the world. Monsanto’s corn line MON810 is produced by ballistically transforming another corn line with a plasmid, PV-ZMCT01. This plasmid has a cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter and hsp70 maize intron sequences which drive the expression of the Cry1Ab gene. The gene then codes for <b>delta</b> <b>endotoxins</b> (Cry proteins) which are toxins that are very potent and provoke lesions in the cell membrane causing cell death These produced Bt toxins bind to certain localized sites on the epithelium of the midgut of insects. Proteins need specific receptors on cells in order to form the Cry proteins and become toxic, which is why the toxins are specific for the order Lepidoptera. The receptors are important for binding the toxic protein and starting the signal cascade, but the exact mechanism of these toxins is not well understood.|$|R
40|$|In {{the same}} way that cry genes, coding for larvicidal <b>delta</b> <b>endotoxins,</b> {{constitute}} a large and diverse gene family, the cyt genes for hemolytic toxins seem to compose another set of highly related genes in Bacillus thuringiensis. Although the occurrence of Cyt hemolytic factors in B. thuringiensis has been typically associated with mosquitocidal strains, we have recently shown that cyt genes are also present in strains with different pathotypes; this is the case for the morrisoni subspecies, which includes strains biologically active against dipteran, lepidopteran, and coleopteran larvae. In addition, while one Cyt type of protein has been described in all of the mosquitocidal strains studied so far, the present study confirms that at least two Cyt toxins coexist in the more toxic antidipteran strains, such as B. thuringiensis subsp. israelensis and subsp. morrisoni PG 14, and that this could also be the case for many others. In fact, PCR screening and Western blot analysis of 50 B. thuringiensis strains revealed that cyt 2 -related genes are present in all strains with known antidipteran activity, as well as in some others with different or unknown host ranges. Partial DNA sequences for several of these genes were determined, and protein sequence alignments revealed a high degree of conservation of the structural domains. These findings point to an important biological role for Cyt toxins in the final in vivo toxic activity of many B. thuringiensis strains. Fil:Rubinstein, C. P. Universidad de Buenos Aires.

40|$|Graduation date: 1992 To {{develop an}} assay to detect {{antibodies}} to Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis in mallard ducks, a growth curve was first {{established for the}} bacterium. The growth curve indicated that the crystal <b>delta</b> <b>endotoxin</b> would be best harvested {{from the rest of}} the cell material after 12 hours of growth. The <b>delta</b> <b>endotoxin</b> was solubilized in alkaline conditions followed by treatment with proteases or no treatment. The two differently treated delta endotoxins were purified by column chromatography. Fractions were assayed for duck erythrocyte lysis and cytotoxicity to a mosquito cell line. The proteolyzed sample gave four protein peaks with gel filtration, and the fourth peak containing biological activity was further separated into three protein fractions by anion exchange chromatography; two of the three showed biological activity. These two fractions contained 22 and 23 kD proteins species. The nonproteolyzed sample was separated into two protein fractions by gel filtration; only the first peak contained the biological activity. This fraction was further separated into two fractions by anion exchange chromatography; only the second fraction, containing a 28 kD protein, exhibited the activity. This fraction contained a 28 kD protein. However, the fractions containing 22 or 23 kD proteins originating from the proteolyzed sample showed the highest biological activity. Mallard ducks were repeatedly exposed to an aerosolized commercial preparation of the organism. Sera were collected periodically and tested for the antibody by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Those toxic antigens containing 22 or 23 kD proteins were unsuitable for the assay. The exposed ducks were found to produce antibodies against the first fraction from anion exchange chromatography of the proteolyzed sample. The antibody titres increased as the number of exposures increased. The results suggest that ELISA is applicable for detecting antibodies against B. t. i. in wild ducks using the fraction containing a 50 kD protein...|$|E

Methods : Larvicides were applied at the recommended dose in selected breeding habitats of Anopheles(An. stephensi), Aedes (Ae. aegypti) and Culex (Cx. quinquefasciatus) and reductions in thedensities of III and IV instars {{were compared with}} that of untreated matched controls. Results : At the construction sites in cemented tanks/chambers VectoBac produced reduction in thedensity of III and IV instar larvae of An. stephensi (98 – 100 %) and Ae. aegypti (100 %) in the first weekof application whereas Bacticide produced 71 – 100 % reduction in An. stephensi and 100 % in Ae. aegypti. Re-application of VectoBac on Day 10 caused better control up to Day 20 when comparedwith Bacticide. In stagnant water pools, VectoBac produced 27. 6 – 85. 3 % reduction in the larvae of An. subpictus and 18. 5 – 83. 8 % in those of Cx. quinquefasciatus whereas Bacticide produced 23. 3 – 30. 3 %and 39 – 97. 2 % reduction in An. subpictus and Cx. quinquefasciatus larval densities in the first weekpost application, respectively. Bacticide application gave better impact on Cx. quinquefasciatuslarvae in the second week after re-application as compared to VectoBac. In storm water drains, Vecto-Bac caused respectively 6. 2 – 100 % and 6. 4 – 97. 6 % reduction in An. subpictus and Cx. quinquefasciatuslarvae {{in the first week of}} application whereas Bacticide produced 100 % and 13. 3 – 98. 8 % reductionin An. subpictus and Cx. quinquefasciatus larval densities, respectively. Interpretation & conclusion : Both the formulations were equally effective on An. subpictus and Cx. quinquefasciatus larvae after a second application. The results showed that application of thesebiolarvicides would be required at 7 – 10 day intervals.

The main {{aim of the research}} is to identify, purify and characterize Bt <b>delta</b> <b>endotoxin</b> receptor in agronomically important pest, American bollworm (Helicoverpa) armigera). The study presented in this thesis is endeavored to: discovery of a receptor protein(2) purification of the receptor. (3) cloning of the newly discovered protein gene in E. coli. (4) expression studies on recombinant protein, (5) Complete sequencing of the cloned gene. Biological activities of different Bt crystal protein, namely Cry Aa, Cry 1 Ab and Cry 1 Ac and Cry 2 A were determined by in vitro mortality assays on neonatal and 2 nd instar larvae of Helicoverpa armigera in the order of Cry 1 Ac> Cry 1 Ab> Cry 1 Aa> Cry 2 A. presence of a 65 kDa protein is reported here, in the extract of the larval midgut membrane of Helicoverpa armigera as putative receptor fro Bt Cry 1 A delta-endotoxins, on the basis of binding affinity to Cry 1 Aa, Cry 1 Ab and Cry 1 Ac but not to Cry 2 A. It was observed that the sugar N-acety 1 galactosamine (Gal NAc) showed no effect on binding of Cry Ac toxin to receptor protein or in other words, toxin binding to receptor was not inhibited by GalNAc. This finding suggests that Gal NAc might not be a component of Cry 1 Ac toxin receptor. The protein has been highly purified by a combination of gel-filtration, protoxin affinity and anion exchange chromatography. When the purified proteins were assayed for amino-peptidase activity, it showed 2. 5 fold enrichment when compared to the activity in crude extract f Helicoverpa armigera brush border membrane vesicles. The stability of receptor protein was analyzed by proteolysis with trypsin and gut juice of Helicoverpa armigera. The results showed that 65 kDa protein was resistant to trypsin and gut juice and has binding affinity to CrylAc in ligand blots, whereas pronase and proteinase-K showed digestion of the receptor protein. Binding assays were performed with 125 I-labeled toxin (CrylAc) and brush border membrane vesicles (BBMVs) prepared from H. armigera. CrylAc toxins produced saturable, high-affinity binding to H. armigera. BBMVs. Homologous and Heterologous competition binding assays were performed to investigate the binding site cross reactivity. The results suggest that CrylAa, CrylAb, and CrylAc recognize the same binding site, which is different from Cry 2 A. N-terminal sequence of the purified protein does not show any homology toe protein sequences in the Gen bank (NCBI) protein database. Degenerate primers were designed based on N-terminal sequence of the purified protein and hybridization of Probe with mRNAs of Helicoverpa armigera indicated sequence complimentarily. The structural gene of this purified protein was cloned in pGEMT-easy vector and pGEX- 4 T- 3 expression vector. The cloned gene was characterized through sequencing and studying expression in E. Coli. The expressed GST fusion protein was purified through Glu 5 tathione sepharose 4 -Fast Flow column. The cloned, expressed and purified receptor protein was found to have 3 -fold increase in APN activity than crude lysate, exhibited binding properties, in Western & ligand bolts and other characteristics of native protein of Helicoverpa armigera. Larval mortality of Helicoverpa armigera to Cry 1 A toxin was considerably presumably due to blocking of the receptor sites in BBMVs. A new method for quick and easy detection of Bt-receptor in crude BBMVs extract, was established, which was based on sandwich ELISA technique. By applying that method, the types of Cry protein in Bt isolates and Bt Cry 1 A receptor varieties in crude BBMVs extracts of target pests can be detected within one hour, before going into the tedious work of receptor purification. The predicted amino acid sequence of cloned gene possess APN conserved motif (zinc biding site) and N-glycosylation site. The sequence has novelty because in has no significant homology to already existing sequences, The N-terminal sequence of the purified protein (65 kDa) has been entered in the Gen Bank (NCBI) protein database(Accession # A 59445).
