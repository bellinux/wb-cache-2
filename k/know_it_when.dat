500|$|Distinguishing {{between science}} and non-science is {{referred}} to as the demarcation problem. For example, should psychoanalysis be considered science? How about so-called creation science, the inflationary multiverse hypothesis, or macroeconomics? Karl Popper called this the central question in the philosophy of science. [...] However, no unified account of the problem has won acceptance among philosophers, and some regard the problem as unsolvable or uninteresting. Martin Gardner has argued for the use of a Potter Stewart standard ("I <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> I see it") for recognizing pseudoscience.|$|E
500|$|The Supreme Court {{ruled in}} Roth v. United States (1957) that the First Amendment did not protect {{obscenity}}. It also {{ruled that the}} Hicklin test was inappropriate; instead, the Roth test for obscenity was [...] "whether to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest". This definition proved hard to apply, however, and in the following decade, members of the Court often reviewed films individually in a court building screening room {{to determine if they}} should be considered obscene. Justice Potter Stewart, in Jacobellis v. Ohio (1964), famously stated that, although he could not precisely define pornography, [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> I see it".|$|E
500|$|... was {{in trouble}} at that time {{because she had a}} couple of engagements that she didn't keep up. But what people didn't realise at that time, that she really knew, and in fact I didn't even <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> we were making the record, and now looking at the whole thing; she knew that she was in a lot of trouble; that she wasn't going to live. And it wasn't drugs. It was alcohol toward the end... It was such a sad thing because... she was the only singer that really sang what I call the 'right way' because she was a great jazz-pop singer... She was really a great jazz singer. A true jazz singer. And I regret that because that's the 'right way' to sing.|$|E

500|$|As a retailer, Marcus {{believed}} {{strongly in}} making his store {{into a place}} where everything a customer needed could be found and, if necessary, brought to the customer's front door. He {{was said to have}} helped one customer discover the shoe size of Queen Elizabeth II so as to give the gift of stockings and a pair of shoes, and he ordered that the store stock such items as a set of Steuben plates with the Mexican national crest, [...] "because sooner or later somebody will be going to call on the President of Mexico and need a proper gift." [...] He personally delivered a fur coat to a St. Louis, Missouri, customer who could not make the trip to Dallas. Another story often recounted is that of a shopper who, in searching for a present for his wife, said that he was not sure what to buy, but that he would <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> he saw it. In response, Marcus inquired about the woman's clothing sizes and asked the customer to wait briefly. Taking an oversized brandy snifter from a display, Marcus gathered cashmere sweaters of various colors, arranged them in imitation of a pousse-café, topped with a white angora sweater to simulate whipped cream, and in place of a cherry, garnished the concoction with a 10-karat ruby ring, at a total cost of $25,350, which the customer gladly paid. When one customer decided his Christmas purchases were not sufficiently impressive, Marcus helped to arrange a full duplication of the store's display window, complete with mannequins and lighting, inside the man's home.|$|E
2500|$|The {{transcendental}} perspective {{deals with}} the metaphysical aspect of quality. In this view of quality, it is [...] "something toward which we strive as an ideal, but may never implement completely". It can hardly be defined, but is similar to what a federal judge once commented about obscenity: [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> I see it".|$|E
2500|$|Science {{fiction is}} {{difficult}} to define, and includes {{a wide range of}} subgenres and themes. Author and editor Damon Knight summed up the difficulty, saying [...] "science fiction is what we point to when we say it", a definition echoed by author Mark C. Glassy, who argues that the definition of science fiction is like the definition of pornography: you do not know what it is, but you <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> you see it.|$|E

2500|$|This, Regnier continued, makes Hoffman Estates part of {{a general}} pattern of cases where {{constitutional}} concerns the Court has used proactively in other situations are often dismissed by it when the case involves drug-law enforcement, a criticism made as well by Justice John Paul Stevens, who called the Court [...] "a loyal foot soldier in the Executive's fight against [...] " [...] in a 1991 dissent. He contrasts the Court's willingness to let the village clarify its ordinance with Papachristou v. Jacksonville, where it struck down an anti-vagrancy ordinance that used a number of terms for those targeted that were necvertheless insufficiently defined. [...] "In short, the Supreme Court in Flipside would have none of this hairsplitting about whether one could adequately define drug paraphernalia—not if it would prevent American communities from combating the scourge of drugs," [...] he wrote. [...] "We <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> we see it, the Court seemed to say," [...] alluding to Justice Potter Stewart's famous definition of hard-core pornography in Jacobellis v. Ohio.|$|E
