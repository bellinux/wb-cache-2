40|$|Objective: The {{major benefit}} of {{tracheal}} gas insufflation (TGI) {{is an increase}} in CO 2 <b>elimination</b> <b>efficiency</b> by removal of CO 2 from the anatomical deadspace. In conjunction with mechanical ventilation, TGI may also alter variables that affect CO 2 elimination, such as minute ventilation and peak airway pressure (peak Paw) and cause the development of auto-positive end-expiratory pressure (auto-PEEP). We tested the hypothesis that TGI-induced auto-PEEP alters ventilatory variables. We predicted that TGI-induced auto-PEEP offsets the beneficial effects of TGI on CO 2 elimination and that keeping total PEEP (ventilator PEEP + auto-PEEP) constant enhances the CO 2 <b>elimination</b> <b>efficiency</b> afforded by TGI. Design: Prospective study of two series of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome receiving mechanical ventilation. Setting: Intensive care units at a university medical center. Patients: Each series consisted of eight sequential hypercapnic patients. Interventions: In series 1, we examined the effect of continuous TGI at 0 and 10 L/min on Paco 2, without compensating for the development of auto-PEEP. In series 2, we examined this same effect of continuous TGI while reducing ventilator PEEP to keep total PEEP constant. TGI-induced auto-PEEP was calculated based on dynamic compliance measurements during zero TGI flow conditions (ΔV/ΔP) after averaging the two baseline values for peak Paw and tidal volume and assuming compliance did not change between the zero TGI and TGI flow conditions (ΔV(TGI) /ΔP(TGI)). Measurements and Main Results: In series 1, total PEEP increased from 13. 2 ± 3. 2 cm H 2 O to 17. 8 ± 3. 5 cm H 2 O without compensation for auto-PEEP (p =. 01). Paco 2 decreased (p =. 03) from 56. 2 ± 10. 6 mm Hg (zero TGI) to 52. 9 ± 9. 3 mm Hg (TGI at 10 L/min), a 6 % decrement. In series 2, total PEEP was unchanged (p = NS). Paco 2 decreased (p =. 03) from 59. 5 ± 10. 4 mm Hg (zero TGI) to 52. 2 ± 8. 3 mm Hg (TGI at 10 L/min), a 12 % decrement. There was no significant change in Pao 2; there were no untoward hemodynamic effects in either series. Conclusions: These data are consistent with the hypothesis that mechanical ventilation + TGI causes an increase in auto-PEEP that can blunt CO 2 elimination. In addition to the ventilator modifications necessary to keep ventilatory variables constant when TGI is used, it is also necessary to reduce ventilator PEEP to keep total PEEP constant and further enhance CO 2 <b>elimination</b> <b>efficiency...</b>|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Barotrauma and {{cardiovascular}} insufficiency are frequently encountered problems {{in patients with}} acute bronchospastic disease who require mechanical ventilation. Permissive hypercapnia is a recognized strategy for minimizing these adverse effects; however, it has potential risks. Tracheal gas insufflation (TGI) {{has been shown to}} increase carbon dioxide <b>elimination</b> <b>efficiency</b> and thus could permit mechanical ventilation at lower peak airway pressures without inducing hypercapnia. However, caution exists as to the impact of TGI on lung volumes, given that expiratory flow limitation is a hallmark of bronchospastic disease. Purpose: To examine these issues, we studied ventilatory and hemodynamic effects of continuous TGI as an adjunct to mechanical ventilation before and after methacholine-induced bronchospasm. Materials and Methods: Ten anesthetized, paralyzed dogs were ventilated on volume-controlled mechanical ventilation during administration of continuous TGI (0, 2, 6, and 10 L/min) while total inspired minute ventilation (ventilator-derived minute ventilation plus TGI) was kept constant. In an additional step, with TGI flow of 10 L/min, total inspired minute ventilation was decreased by 30 %. Results: Paco 2 decreased (44 ± 7 mm Hg at zero flow to 34 ± 7 mm Hg at 6 L/min and 31 ± 6 mm Hg at 10 L/min, respectively, P <. 05), as did the dead space to tidal volume ratio at TGI of 6 and 10 L/min compared with zero flow. There were no significant changes in end-expiratory transpulmonary pressure, mean arterial pressure, or cardiac output. During the highest TGI flow (10 L/min), with a 30 % reduction of total inspired minute ventilation, both Paco 2 and peak airway pressure remained less than during zero flow conditions. Conclusion: We conclude that TGI increases carbon dioxide <b>elimination</b> <b>efficiency</b> during constant and decreased minute ventilation conditions without any evidence of hyperinflation or hemodynamic instability during methacholine-induced bronchospasm...|$|R

40|$|Municipal {{wastewater}} contains, {{along with}} suspended solids, oxygen consuming compounds and nutrients, {{a great number}} of organic trace pollutants. These are industrial chemicals, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, natural and synthetic hormones, as well as ingredients of personal care products. Even in very low concentrations (ng/L to µg/L) some of these compounds can already {{have a negative impact on}} the environment. The impact can manifest itself for example in toxic, carcinogenic and/or endocrine effects of wastewater treatment plant effluents in aquatic organisms. Nevertheless, the elimination of organic trace pollutants has not been taken into consideration yet, neither in design nor during the operation of municipal wastewater treatment plants. On the basis of the European Water Framework Directive requirements on the quality of surface waters, some changes in this attitude are to expect in the future. This study examines around 500 organic trace pollutants which are continuously monitored by the federal environmental agencies. It shows that 52 compounds are relevant for the environment, because their concentrations in wastewater treatment plant effluents and surface waters in Germany have exceeded the target values. Due to the impossibility of studying the behaviour of all 52 relevant trace pollutants during the wastewater treatment, the industrial chemicals nonylphenol and bisphenol A, natural hormone 17 b-estradiol and synthetic steroid 17 a-ethinylestradiol were appointed as model compounds. The criteria of choice were different biological degradation and volatilisation rates, as well as different affinity to sewage sludge. The behaviour of the model trace pollutants during the mechanic-biological treatment of wastewater and sewage sludge was studied in pilot wastewater treatment plants and in laboratory sorption and degradation experiments with radiolabelled compounds. In these experiments biodegradation was identified as the main elimination pathway. By the biodegradation of the model compounds carbon dioxide and some unidentified metabolites were generated. Further research is required to perform a risk assessment of the biodegradation products. The evaluation of <b>elimination</b> <b>efficiency</b> of various wastewater treatment plant configurations was performed using the experiment results and the mathematical model developed in this study. A conventional activated sludge plant with simultaneous aerobic sludge digestion showed the best <b>elimination</b> <b>efficiency</b> for the model compounds. It was followed by membrane activated sludge plants with simultaneous aerobic and separate anaerobic sludge digestion. The lowest <b>elimination</b> <b>efficiency</b> was observed in a conventional activated sludge plant with separate anaerobic sludge digestion. Sand filtration of the effluents of conventional treatment plants did not contribute significantly to the elimination of the model trace pollutants. Since, according to the mathematical model the studied wastewater treatment plant configurations do not retain some organic trace pollutants like 17 a-ethinylestradiol and the pharmaceutical carbamazepine sufficiently, 16 various measures of enhancing the elimination of trace pollutants were assessed with respect to their technical and economical efficiency. For the smaller wastewater treatment plants (up to 5, 000 PE) the addition of pulverised activated carbon into the aeration tank was especially suitable.

40|$|Two {{laboratory}} {{wastewater treatment}} plants (WWTPs) were run for 8 weeks in order to study the extent and the kinetics of the elimination of Bisphenol A (BPA) from synthetic wastewater. Both WWTPs showed a strong reduction of dissolved BPA from 10 µg/l (nominal) up to the final efflu-ent concentration of 0. 22 and 0. 28 µg/l in week 8, respectively. In both systems sludge BPA con-centrations decreased by time from ~ 1, 200 to ~ 400 µg/kg DM in the denitrification tanks and from ~ 800 to ~ 200 µg/kg DM in the aeration tanks. The overall elimination rate increased by time from 56 and 73 % in week 3 to 98 % in week 8, respectively. Since the aeration tank water phase BPA concentrations decreased below the limit of detection desorption of BPA from sludge during clarifying must be stated. This release possibly was caused by anaerobization of the clari-fier sludge deposits. Thus, the BPA <b>elimination</b> <b>efficiency</b> of WWTPs probably can be improved by aerating the water during clarification and by minimizing the hydraulic retention time in the clarifier tank...|$|R
40|$|Microcystins (MCs), cyclic heptapeptides {{produced}} by cyanobacteria constitute a significant risk to humans. Several bacteria with MCs degradation capability are known, however their practical usage is questionable due to low MC <b>elimination</b> <b>efficiency.</b> As an alternative bacteria with significantly enhanced activity toward these hepatotoxins may be constructed. We have recently presented successful {{expression of the}} MlrA enzyme involved in MC biodegradation in E. coli BL 21 strain. In this paper preliminary experiments indicating the usefulness of such modified bacteria have been showed. The MC degradation efficiency was monitored by the HPLC detection of linear MC-LR. Immobilization procedure involved the formation of alginate beads with entrapped bacterial cells. The long-term activity of BL 21 _MlrA in comparison with wild Sphingomonas strain confirmed much higher potential of the modified bacteria. Immobilization in alginate allowed to form beads with high activity toward MC. A column packed with alginate entrapped cells eliminated MC efficiently from contaminated freshwater. These promising results will broaden the perspective of practical application of microorganisms in bioremediation of freshwater...|$|R

40|$|Aims: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the optimization of the treatment process of Bushigan water treatment plant (South of Iran) in respect of turbidity and total organic carbon (TOC) removal. Materials and Methods: The water samples were collected from Shapoor river the influent water to Bushigan treatment plant. A conventional jar test apparatus was used to evaluate the coagulation process. Different dosages of poly aluminum chloride (PACl), powdered activated carbon (PAC) and chlorine (Cl 2) alone and with each other was used to determine their effects on removal of the turbidity and TOC. Results: The average of TOC and turbidity in raw water were 5. 81 mg/L and 29 NTU respectively in all seasons. The study result showed that the removal <b>efficiency</b> of <b>TOC</b> and turbidity were improved with increasing the PACl and PAC dose. With the application of 12 mg/L PACl alone, the maximum TOC and turbidity removal efficiencies were 41 % and 31 %, respectively. At constant PACl dose, application of PAC as coagulant aid and adsorbent improved the removal <b>efficiency</b> of <b>TOC</b> and turbidity. Conclusion: The results were showed that by common water treatment method (coagulation and precipitation) using PACl as a coagulant and also PAC and Cl 2 as an adsorbent and coagulant aid, the TOC and turbidity of water reduced to below 1 mg/L. So PAC and Cl 2 can improve the coagulation process. This method can be used for water treatment plant with drinking water contain the average TOC less than 6 mg/L...|$|R
30|$|Considering {{that the}} {{exposure}} to short-chain PFAAs {{is unlikely to be}} stopped shortly, there will be increasing continuous and poorly reversible environmental background concentrations of short-chain PFAAs. Consequently, organisms and humans will be permanently exposed to short-chain PFAAs, resulting in continuous and poorly reversible internal concentrations. The poorly reversible internal concentrations in organisms are caused by the persistence of short-chain PFAAs and their continuous presence in the environment. Therefore, the organismal <b>elimination</b> <b>efficiencies</b> are of secondary relevance. This becomes more evident when considering that the half-lives of short-chain PFAAs in the environment exceed their half-lives in the organisms by far. Cousins et al. [41] addresses this approach in more detail, showing exemplary that the contamination of drinking water resources with short-chain PFAAs leads to a poorly reversible exposure in humans, comparably to a contamination with long-chain PFAAs. Due to the high mobility of short-chain PFAAs and the missing suitable water treatment technologies for drinking water, short-chain PFAAs will remain in the water resources over time (this scenario proves true, see “Case example Rastatt”). This results in a permanent exposure via drinking water, independently of the elimination half-lives of short-chain PFAAs.|$|R
