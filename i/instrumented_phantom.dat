40|$|International audienceOur studies {{focus on}} {{dedicated}} dosimetry systems {{based on the}} Gallium Nitride (GaN) probe for Quality Assurance and patient safety in radiotherapy, brachytherapy and interventional radiology. The small size GaN transducer in the probe has high radioluminescence (RL) yield and rapid RL signal response for real time measurements. Preliminary prototypes of dedicated systems were tested in clinical conditions for external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy and interventional radiology. The obtained pre-clinical results appear favorable and encouraging: in radiotherapy, GaN RL response has not significant dependence on the main influence parameters, excepted for the field size. In brachytherapy, using an <b>instrumented</b> <b>phantom</b> with integration of GaN probes allows real time verification of planned treatments. In interventional radiology, skin dose measurements using GaN probe based dosimeters show consistent results with those from a reference dosimeter...|$|E

40|$|A UHF radiometer, {{operating}} at a frequency of 800 MHz, was modified {{to provide an}} integral, three frequency voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) circuit in the radio frequency (RF) head. The VSWR circuit provides readings of power transmission at the antenna-material interface with an accuracy of plus or minus 5 percent. The power transmission readings are numerically equal to the emissivity of the material under observation. Knowledge of material emissivity is useful {{in the interpretation of}} subsurface apparent temperatures obtained on phantom models of biological tissue. The emissivities of phantom models consisting of lean beefsteak were found to lie in the range 0. 623 to 0. 779, depending on moisture content. Radiometric measurements performed on <b>instrumented</b> <b>phantoms</b> showed that the radiometer was capable of sensing small temperature changes occurring at depths of at least 19 to 30 mm. This is consistent with previously generated data which showed that the radiometer could sense temperatures at a depth of 38 mm...|$|R

40|$|Haptic and robotic {{technologies}} {{have the potential}} to provide assessment during interaction with humans. This manuscript presents our earlier research during the I-Match project where a haptic peg-in-hole test was used in order to compare between healthy volunteers' performance and those with neurological impairment. Subjects all performed a series of haptic virtual peg-in-hole tasks with varying degrees of difficulty determined by the hole diameter. Haptic <b>instrument,</b> <b>Phantom</b> Desktop 1. 5, allowed for recording of biomechanical data which is used to present some variant features between the two subject groups. This paper analyses the placement time, maximum peg transfer velocity, collision forces recorded during peg placement and also insertion accuracy. The first three parameters showed statistically {{significant differences between the two}} groups while the last, insertion accuracy, showed insignificant differences (p = 0. 152). This is thought to be due to the large clearance value between the smallest hole diameter and the peg. To identify differences between the haptic peg-in-hole and the established NHPT, we are currently in process of conducting a further experiment with a haptic replica of the NHPT test, in order to investigate effects resulting from addition of haptic force feedback compared to the original NHPT test, as well as allowing to explore influences caused by the 1 mm clearance value as originally proposed by Wade. Furthermore, in order to investigate if this method can identify differences between subjects with different neurological conditions, a larger group of subjects with neurological conditions such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, and traumatic brain injury is required to explore potency of this approach for identifying differences between these different conditions...|$|R
5|$|The name of Zobel is, perhaps, most {{well known}} {{with regard to}} {{impedance}} compensation networks for loudspeakers. Clearly, his designs have applications in this field. However, none of Zobel's patents or articles appear to discuss this topic. It is unclear whether he actually designed anything specifically for loudspeakers. The closest we get to {{this is where he}} speaks of impedance matching into a transducer, but here he is discussing a circuit to equalize a submarine cable, or in another instance where clearly he has in mind the hybrid transformer which terminates a line going into a telephone <b>instrument</b> on a <b>phantom</b> circuit.|$|R
40|$|Cryogen Spray Cooling (CSC) is an {{auxiliary}} procedure that pre-cools the epidermis during Laser Derma-tologic Surgery (LDS) to avoid non-specific epidermal thermal damage. During CSC, explosive atomization, in-flight evaporation and droplet-substrate interaction affect heat extraction from the substrate. In {{order to understand}} the heat transfer mechanism of this complex process, we first study the heat transfer between a single cryogen (R 134 a) droplet and an epoxy skin phantom. In a high pressure chamber, cryogen droplets are gently deposited on a skin <b>phantom</b> <b>instrumented</b> with a fast-response thin-film thermocouple. The surface temperature variations were recorded and used to calculate surface heat fluxes. Using this setup, we performed experiments to study the effect of initial surface temperature on the cooling efficiency of a cryogen droplet. The results show that the cooling effi-ciency increases with increasing initial substrate temperature...|$|R
40|$|In North America {{more than}} 40 million doses of iodinated X-Ray {{contrast}} medium are delivered to patients undergoing CT imaging every year. This particular pharmaceutical {{is necessary to}} enable Computed Tomography of soft tissue, tumors, and vasculature. Very few of the contrast enhanced procedures are performed with the dose of the drug tailored to the individual patient or procedure and nearly every patient receives the same dose of contrast material. This dissertation presents a methodology to allow the routine administration of a personalized dose of contrast material to generate contrast enhancement sufficient for diagnosis during cardiothoracic CT Angiography imaging. Parameter estimation of a patient specific model is performed using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) with data generated from the scanner during a pre-diagnostic "test" injection of contrast agent. A non-parametric system identification technique, using the truncated Singular Value Decomposition, is also developed for deriving a patient specific prediction of contrast enhancement. The MLE technique produces contrast enhancement predictions with less error than the tSVD method. It is also shown that the MLE method is less sensitive to data length and has greater noise immunity. A novel, patient-specific contrast protocol generation algorithm is also presented. It is based upon a constrained minimization (Sequential Quadratic Programming) that enforces constraints on the input parameters while minimizing the volume of contrast sufficient to achieve a prospectively chosen enhancement target. A physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) numeric model is developed and used to validate the contrast prediction and protocol generation techniques. Finally, a novel, <b>instrumented,</b> flow <b>phantom</b> is developed and used to validate the identification and protocol generation techniques...|$|R
40|$|Performing complex {{tasks such}} as {{vascular}} anastomosis in minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is demanding due to a disturbed hand-eye co-ordination, the application of non-ergonomic instruments with limited number of degrees of freedom (DOFs) {{and a lack of}} three-dimensional perception. Robotic tele-manipulatory systems enhance surgical dexterity by providing up to seven DOFs. They allow the surgeon to operate in an ergonomically favourable position with more intuitive manipulation of the instruments. Robotic systems, however, are very bulky, expensive and do not provide any force feedback from the tissue. The aim of our study is to develop a simple mechanical manipulator for MIS. The Minimally Invasive Manipulator (MIM) is a purely mechanical device. When manipulating the handle of the MIM, the surgeon's wrist and grasping movements, which are essential for suturing, are directly transmitted to the deflectable instrument tip in seven DOFs. It gives the surgeon direct control of the <b>instrument</b> tip. First <b>phantom</b> experience indicates that the system functions properly. The MIM provides force feedback to improve safety. A set of MIMs seems to be an economical and compact alternative to robotic systems and will offer more surgeons the capability to perform complex MIS and to shorten their learning curv...|$|R
40|$|Aim. The aim of {{this paper}} is to report a study to {{determine}} the effects of absorbent pads on the pressure-relieving properties of 'standard' and pressure management mattresses. Background. Pressure ulcers and incontinence often co-exist. There is a strong association between poor mobility and continence problems and patients using pressure management products are therefore also likely to be using absorbent pads. Methods. An <b>instrumented</b> articulated anthropometric <b>phantom</b> with simulated soft body 'tissues' in the gluteal and sacral areas was used as the 'subject'. The phantom was raised and lowered on to three mattresses (standard foam, visco-elastic foam and surface-cut foam) in three states: naked, wearing a dry pad (Tena Super, SCA Hygiene AB) and wearing a wet pad. The pressure mapping device Xsensor was used to record the distribution of pressure over the sacral and ischial areas of the phantom. Peak pressure was used as the primary outcome variable and 10 repeats were made on each mattress under each condition. Results. There were substantial and significant differences for all three mattresses in recorded peak pressures between the naked buttocks and the buttocks wearing a dry pad. There were no significant differences between measurements made using the dry vs. wet pad. Peak pressures frequently occurred over areas of pad folds. Additional testing showed that pads that were 'smoothed' by hand had significantly lower peak pressures than 'unsmoothed' pads. Conclusions. Absorbent pads have a substantial adverse effect on the pressure redistribution properties of mattresses. Pad folds appear to contribute to this effect, which can be ameliorated slightly by smoothing. Absorbent pad manufacturers should consider engineering pads that minimize disruption to pressure management. Further examination of continence and pressure management products is necessary to establish optimum combinations for nursing care...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} the modification and assessment of a standard multidistance frequency-domain near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) instrument to perform multifrequency frequency-domain NIRS measurements. The first aim of these modifications was to develop an instrument that enables measurement of small volumes of tissue such as the cervix, which {{is too small to}} be measured using a multidistance approach. The second aim was to enhance the spectral resolution to be able to determine the absolute concentrations of oxy-, deoxy- and total hemoglobin, water, and lipids. The third aim was to determine the accuracy and error of measurement of this novel instrument in both in vitro and in vivo environments. The modifications include two frequency synthesizers with variable, freely adjustable frequency, broadband high-frequency amplifiers, the development of a novel avalanche photodiode (APD) detector and demodulation circuit, additional laser diodes with additional wavelengths, and a respective graphic user interface to analyze the measurements. To test the <b>instrument</b> and algorithm, <b>phantoms</b> with optical properties similar to those of biological tissue were measured and analyzed. The results show that the absorption coefficient can be determined with an error of < 10 %. The error of the scattering coefficient was < 31 %. Since the accuracy of the chromophore concentrations depends on the absorption coefficient and not on the scattering coefficient, the < 10 % error is the clinically relevant parameter. In addition, the new APD had similar accuracy as the standard photomultiplier tubes. To determine the accuracy of chromophore concentration measurements we employed liquid Intralipid® phantoms that contained 99 % water, 1 % lipid, and an increasing concentration of hemoglobin in steps of 0. 010 mM. Water concentration was measured with an accuracy of 6. 5 % and hemoglobin concentration with an error of 0. 0024 mM independent of the concentration. The measured lipid concentration was negative, which shows that the current setup is not suitable for measuring lipids. Measurements on the forearm confirmed reasonable values for water and hemoglobin concentrations, but again not for lipids. As an example of a future application, chromophore concentrations in the cervix were measured and comparable values to the forearm were found. In conclusion the modified instrument enables measurement of water concentration in addition to oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin concentrations with a single source-detector distance in small tissue samples. Future work will focus on resolving the lipid component...|$|R
40|$|The {{radiation}} risk to astronauts {{has always}} been based on measurements using passive thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs). The skin dose is converted to dose equivalent using an average radiation quality factor based on model calculations. The radiological risk estimates, however, are based on organ and tissue doses. This paper describes results from the first space flight (STS- 91, 51. 65 degrees inclination and approximately 380 km altitude) of a fully <b>instrumented</b> Alderson Rando <b>phantom</b> torso (with head) to relate the skin dose to organ doses. Spatial distributions of absorbed dose in 34 1 -inch-thick sections measured using TLDs are described. There is about a 30 % change in dose as one moves from the front {{to the back of}} the phantom body. Small active dosimeters were developed specifically to provide time-resolved measurements of absorbed dose rates and quality factors at five organ locations (brain, thyroid, heart/lung, stomach and colon) inside the phantom. Using these dosimeters, it was possible to separate the trapped-proton and the galactic cosmic radiation components of the doses. A tissue-equivalent proportional counter (TEPC) and a charged-particle directional spectrometer (CPDS) were flown next to the phantom torso to provide data on the incident internal radiation environment. Accurate models of the shielding distributions at the site of the TEPC, the CPDS and a scalable Computerized Anatomical Male (CAM) model of the phantom torso were developed. These measurements provided a comprehensive data set to map the dose distribution inside a human phantom, and to assess the accuracy and validity of radiation transport models throughout the human body. The results show that for the conditions in the International Space Station (ISS) orbit during periods near the solar minimum, the ratio of the blood-forming organ dose rate to the skin absorbed dose rate is about 80 %, and the ratio of the dose equivalents is almost one. The results show that the GCR model dose-rate predictions are 20 % lower than the observations. Assuming that the trapped-belt models lead to a correct orbit-averaged energy spectrum, the measurements of dose rates inside the phantom cannot be fully understood. Passive measurements using 6 Li- and 7 Li-based detectors on the astronauts and inside the brain and thyroid of the phantom show the presence of a significant contribution due to thermal neutrons, an area requiring additional study...|$|R
