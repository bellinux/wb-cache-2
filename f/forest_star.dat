40|$|Abstract. A star graph is a tree of {{diameter}} at most two. A <b>star</b> <b>forest</b> is a graph {{that consists}} of node-disjoint star graphs. In the spanning <b>star</b> <b>forest</b> problem, given an unweighted graph G, {{the objective is to}} find a <b>star</b> <b>forest</b> that contains all the vertices of G and has the maximum number of edges. This problem is the complement of the dominating set problem in the following sense: On a graph with n vertices, the size of the maximum spanning <b>star</b> <b>forest</b> is equal to n minus the size of the minimum dominating set. We present a 0. 71 -approximation algorithm for this problem, improving upon the approximation factor of 0. 6 of Nguyen et al. [9].

Finally, we present improved hardness of approximation results for the weighted versions of the problem. ...|$|R
