5|$|As a {{condition}} of being allowed to disinter the skeleton, the archaeologists agreed that, if Richard were <b>found,</b> <b>his</b> remains would be reburied in Leicester Cathedral. A controversy arose as to whether an alternative reburial site, York Minster or Westminster Abbey, would be more suitable. A legal challenge confirmed there were no public law grounds for the courts {{to be involved in}} that decision.

5|$|Compared to his two fellow protagonists, C.T. Smith was {{considered}} more novel. Anime News Network {{said he was}} one of the few fresh points of the series and had the most distinctive design among the cast, though even his role as an unassuming businessman who is actually an expert gunman felt as if it must be borrowed from somewhere else. MangaCast's reviewer, on the other hand, <b>found</b> <b>his</b> role mostly extraneous, due to being overshadowed by Gamma. Animemaniacs Magazine Online noted that Smith's physical appearance was later echoed by Bleachs central antagonist, Sōsuke Aizen.|$|E

5|$|Despite early victories, Pyrrhus <b>found</b> <b>his</b> {{position}} in Italy untenable. Rome steadfastly refused {{to negotiate with}} Pyrrhus {{as long as his}} army remained in Italy.

While Beneventum was indecisive, Pyrrhus realised his army had been exhausted and reduced by years of foreign campaigns. Seeing little hope for further gains, he withdrew completely from Italy.|$|E
5|$|Flynn {{has divided}} film critics. While some reviewers enjoyed the character's {{refreshing}} humor, rebelliousness and sarcasm {{in comparison to}} traditional Disney princes, others <b>found</b> <b>his</b> personality to be annoying and obnoxious, while panning his narration. Additionally, Flynn has also been strongly {{accused of being a}} marketing tool exploited by Disney to attract a larger male audience to Tangled. However, both the character's romantic comedy-esque relationship with Rapunzel and Levi's vocal performance have received widespread acclaim. Flynn is also considered to be among the most appealing Disney heroes by Vanity Fair, E! and Cosmopolitan.|$|E
5|$|Hamm {{acknowledged}} {{science fiction}} was a niche genre {{when the original}} film was made, and that it used science fiction to make topical issues more approachable.

He continued helping the Survey until 1989, also serving as an assistant researcher at the University of California at Santa Barbara.|$|E

5|$|Joseph {{moved to}} the Detroit Red Wings, who had just won the Stanley Cup. Joseph {{initially}} was not popular with Red Wings fans but eventually <b>found</b> <b>his</b> form {{in the latter half}} of the 2002–03 season to backstop his team to the division title.

He was prevented from doing so by English authorities, who then proceeded to expel him from England. Infuriated, Marie sent an official apology to George V on behalf of her son, who had already begun plotting a coup d'état. Carol succeeded in divorcing Princess Helen on 21 June 1928, on grounds of incompatibility.|$|E
5|$|On {{his return}} from France, Edward <b>found</b> <b>his</b> {{political}} position greatly strengthened. After intense negotiation, the earls, including Lancaster and Warwick, came to a compromise in October 1313, fundamentally {{very similar to the}} draft agreement of the previous December. Edward's finances improved, thanks to parliament agreeing to the raising of taxes, a loan of 160,000 florins (£25,000) from the Pope, £33,000 that he borrowed from Philip, and further loans organised by Edward's new Italian banker, Antonio Pessagno.
