Such border areas between São Caetano and adjacent cities São Bernardo do Campo and Santo André are prone to flooding which happens often, especially in the more impoverished areas bordering the city of São Paulo, where the Meninos creek (a tributary of the heavily polluted Tamanduateí river) is often littered with construction debris and garbage, exacerbating the <b>flooding</b> <b>effect</b> in the rainy season (Oct-Feb).|$|E
50|$|The canal's {{use of the}} Concord River had {{significant}} long-term environmental consequences. The raising of the dam height at North Billerica was believed to cause flooding of seasonal hay meadows upstream, and prompted numerous lawsuits against the canal proprietors. These were all ultimately unsuccessful, {{due in part to}} the uncertainty of the science, and also in part to the political power of the proprietors. As the canal was in decline in its later years, the state legislature finally ordered the dam height to be lowered, but then repealed the order before it was executed. Analysis done in the 20th century suggests that the dam, which still stands (although no longer at its greatest height), probably had a <b>flooding</b> <b>effect</b> on hay meadows as far as 25 miles up the watershed. Many of these meadows had to be abandoned, and some now form portions of the Great Meadows National Wildlife Refuge; they are classified as wetlands.|$|E

30|$|Fuzzy {{comprehensive}} evaluation (FCE) is {{a synthetic}} appraisement method based on fuzzy mathematics, and evaluation result is practical and reliable, therefore, which {{is widely used}} in petroleum, construction and many other fields. This paper applies it to the evaluation of water <b>flooding</b> <b>effect</b> of oilfield. This paper introduces the principle of FCE method and the evaluation steps. The method {{is applied to the}} evaluation of water flooding development effect, which is helpful to improve the analysis level of oil and gas field development. Compared with the traditional method, this proposed method can reflect the difference of the evaluation units. Meanwhile, the weight vector is gotten by entropy method and analytic hierarchy process (AHP), which making the evaluation results more convincing. Taking W oilfield as an example, the ten factors (e.g., reserves controlled degree of water flooding, reserves producing degree of water flooding, recovery percent of recoverable reserves, water cut, water storage rate, oil recovery rate of residual recoverable reserves, cumulative water injection, maintenance of formation pressure, comprehensive decline rate, water flooding recovery) were evaluated by proposed FCE method. Then the membership matrix is established, and the weight vector is calculated by the entropy method and the AHP. Finally, the evaluation results of the two methods are obtained by fuzzy transformation and are consistent with the actual water <b>flooding</b> <b>effect.</b> Thus, the FEC method can be used as method to accurately evaluate the effect of oil field water flooding.|$|E

Assimilation rates under ambient conditions fell by 27 %, and the inhibition could not be overcome by elevated CO 2 partial pressures. Stomatal conductance limited the assimilation rate to approximately the same degree both before and after flooding.

40|$|This study explores novel {{methods for}} {{resource}} discovery in unstructured peerto-peer (P 2 P) networks. The {{objective of this}} study is to develop a lightweight resource discovery mechanism suitable to be used in unstructured P 2 P networks. Resource discovery techniques are examined and implemented in a simulator with high scalability in order to imitate real-life P 2 P environments. Simulated topology generator models are reviewed and compared, the most suitable topology generator model is then chosen to test the novel resource discovery techniques. Resource discovery techniques in unstructured P 2 P networks usually rely on forwarding as many query messages as possible onto the network. Even though this approach was able to return many resources, the flooding of the network with query messages have an adverse effect on the network. Flooding the network has undesirable consequences such as degenerative performance of the network, waste of network resources, and network downtime. This study has developed alpha multipliers, a method of controlling query message forwarding to deal with the <b>flooding</b> <b>effect</b> of most resource discovery techniques in unstructured P 2 P networks. The combination of alpha multipliers and breadth-first search (BFS), ↵-BFS, was able to avoid the <b>flooding</b> <b>effect</b> that usually occurs with BFS. The ↵-BFS technique also increases the combined query efficiency compared to the original BFS. Aside from improving a uninformed search technique such as the BFS, this study also examines the network communication cost of several informed resource discovery techniques. Several issues that arise in informed resource discovery techniques, such as false positive errors, and high network communication costs for queries to update search results are discussed. This detailed analysis forms the basis of a lightweight resource discovery mechanism (LBRDM) that reduces the network communication cost by reducing the number of backward updates inside the network when utilising the blackboard resource discovery mechanism (BRDM). Simulations of BRDM and LBRDM show that the lightweight version can also return an almost identical combined query efficiency than the BRDM. The solution to control query message forwarding in ↵-BFS, and the removal of unnecessary exchange of information in LBRDM open a new perspective on simplifying resource discovery techniques. These approaches can be implemented on other techniques to improve the performance of resource discovery...|$|E

Other studies found a negative relation between diameter growth and the height and duration of annual inundations, e.g. in the igapó forests along Rio Negro (Schöngart et al. 2010), Amazonian várzea forests (Nebel et al. 2001 a, 2001 b; Schöngart et al. 2010) and riparian forests in the Brazilian Pantanal (Wittmann et al. 2008; Schöngart et al. 2011). Worbes (1997) confirmed with dendrochronological methods that the floodplain trees typically reduce wood growth during the aquatic phase and then remain {{in a state of}} cambial dormancy. Flooding height and duration perhaps were in the Araguaia system not as extreme as in other floodplain studies, where closed forest occurs up to inundation depths of 9 m (black water rivers) or 7.5 m (white water rivers) (Junk et al. 2011).

40|$|Oscillatory {{fluctuations}} of {{a single}} proton exchange membrane fuel cell appear upon operation with a dry cathode air supply and a fully humidified anode stream. Periodic transitions between a low and a high current operation point of the oscillating state were observed. The transition time for the change from the low to the high operation is fast and {{does not depend on}} the operating parameters, while the downward transition depends strongly on the operating conditions. An insight into the transitions is obtained by current density distributions at distinct times indicating a propagating active area with defined boundaries. The high current operation possesses a high electro-osmotic drag and a high permeation rate (corresponding to liquid-vapor permeation) leading to a large water flux to the cathode. Subsequently, the liquid reservoir at the anode is consumed leading to an anode drying. The system establishes a new quasi-stable operation point associated with a low current, low electro-osmotic drag coefficient, and a low water permeation (corresponding to vapor-vapor permeation). When liquid water is formed at the anode interface after some time the fast transition to the high current operation occurs due also to a <b>flooding</b> <b>effect</b> leading to blockage of channels...|$|E

Therefore, in laboratory ultra-low interfacial tension ASP system is preferred for sand packs flow experiment to research {{on the effect of}} chromatographic separation on ASP system interface tension. The two parameters of "breakthrough time" and "output difference" are used to describe the degree of chromatographic separation, and the produced fluid interfacial tensions at the outlet end at 120 min is measured. The research shows that there exists chromatographic separation between three chemicals of ASP system, with first polymer breakthrough and finally surfactant breakthrough; there is most serious chromatographic separation between surfactant and polymer, while minimum chromatographic separation between alkali and polymer; chromatographic separation makes ASP interfacial tension increase from 10 - 3 magnitude to 10 - 2 magnitude, affecting <b>flooding</b> <b>effect</b> of ASP system.

Flooding reduced specific leaf area and biomass allocation to roots in all species and enhanced leaf senescence in B. brizantha and B. decumbens.

Net photosynthesis and leaf chlorophyll content were reduced by flooding in B. brizantha; however, no <b>flooding</b> <b>effect</b> could be detected in the other two species.

These results show that the studied species have distinct degrees of tolerance to flood, B. brizantha is intolerant, B. decumbens is moderately tolerant and B. humidicola is tolerant. Because leaf elongation rate was immediately depressed by flooding only in B. brizantha, this measurement could be appropriate as an early detection mechanism for relative flood tolerance in Brachiaria spp...|$|E
40|$|Flooding {{frequency}} {{is predicted}} to increase during the next decades, calling for {{a better understanding of}} impacts on terrestrial ecosystems and for developing strategies to mitigate potential damage. Plant diversity is expected to buffer <b>flooding</b> <b>effects</b> by providing a broad range of species' responses. Here we report on the response of soil processes to a severe summer flood in 2013, which affected major parts of central Europe. We compared soil microbial respiration, biomass, nutrient limitation and enzyme activity in a grassland biodiversity experiment in Germany before flooding, one week and three months after the flood. Microbial biomass was reduced in the severely flooded plots at high, but not at low plant functional group richness. Flooding alleviated microbial nitrogen limitation, presumably due the input of nutrient-rich sediments. Further, the activity of soil enzymes including 1, 4 -β-Nacetylglucosaminidase, phenol oxidase and peroxidase increased with flooding severity, suggesting increased chitin and lignin degradation {{as a consequence of the}} input of detritus in sediments. <b>Flooding</b> <b>effects</b> were enhanced at higher plant diversity, indicating that plant diversity temporarily reduces stability of soil processes during flooding.

Building on preferences as strict partial orders we provide a variety of intuitive base preference constructors for numerical and categorical data, including so-called d-parameters. As a novel semantic concept for complex preferences we introduce the notion of ‘substitutable values’ (SV-semantics), characterizing equally good values amongst indifferent values. Pareto and prioritized preference construction preserves strict partial orders, which instantly solves crucial wellknown problems for preference queries. We can point out a new semantic-guided way {{to cope with the}} infamous <b>flooding</b> <b>effect</b> of query engines. Contrary to a wide-spread belief we can give evidence that the result sizes of Pareto or skyline queries not necessarily explode for multiple attributes. Moreover, we can show that known laws from preference relational algebra remain valid under SV-semantics. Since most of these laws rely on transitivity, preservation of strict partial order is essential to algebraically optimize complex preference queries. Similarly, well-known efficient evaluation algorithms for the preference selection operator rely on transitivity. In a nutshell, preference constructors with SVsemantics enable an intuitive and powerful personalization of database queries {{and at the same time}} are the key to efficient preference query evaluation. 1...|$|E

30|$|In our study, a {{significant}} <b>flooding</b> <b>effect</b> was however detected on wood density, which increased significantly with increasing flood height and duration, and for maximum tree {{height of the}} stands, which decreased significantly in direction of the river. We interpret these relationships as a hint that the flooding regime and associated soil anoxia acted as an environmental filter selecting for more flood-tolerant tree species with higher wood density close to the river. The production of wood with higher density compensated for the smaller maximum tree height in the AF stands with the consequence that standing biomass and also biomass production were not lower than in the NAF plots. Thus, the productivity data suggest that higher wood density {{was not related to}} lower diameter growth in our species sample. With respect to the causes of these patterns, our dbh and tree height data suggest that the average AF tree must either be shorter-lived or grow slower in height than the average NAF tree. As trees with dbh > 50 cm were more abundant in the NAF plots, we assume that the greater maximum tree height in these stands is a consequence of greater age and not intrinsically higher height growth rates. In two of the three highly flooded plots, the mortality rate in the five study years was indeed high with > 2 %∙yr– 1, which may suggest that trees in the AF plots do no reach larger sizes and ages due to reduced survival under high floods.|$|E
