25|$|The {{additional}} gain over a <b>half-wave</b> <b>dipole</b> {{is about}} 2nbsp&dB, but the impedance {{is much higher}} than a <b>half-wave</b> <b>dipole</b> making it more complicated to match with ordinary, low impedance RF equipment and cabling.|$|E
25|$|This {{radiation}} pattern {{is similar to}} and only slightly less directional {{than that of the}} <b>half-wave</b> <b>dipole.</b>|$|E

50|$|An {{array of}} 1056 <b>half-wave</b> <b>dipoles</b> {{in front of}} a 90 degrees corner {{reflector}} forms the primary feed of the telescope. It has an angular resolution of 2.3deg x 5.5sec(dec)'.|$|R
50|$|Reflective array - a {{planar array}} of antennas, often <b>half-wave</b> <b>dipoles</b> fed in phase, {{in front of}} a flat {{reflector}} such as a metal plate or wire screen. This radiates a single beam of radio waves perpendicular (broadside) to the array. Used as UHF television antennas and radar antennas.|$|R
25|$|Ideally, a <b>half-wave</b> <b>dipole</b> {{should be}} fed using a {{balanced}} transmission line matching its typical 65-70Ω input impedance. Twin lead {{with a similar}} impedance is available but seldom used.|$|E
25|$|Again, these {{relationships}} are accurate for L<< λ/2. Setting L=λ/2 regardless, this formula would predict a radiation resistance of 49Ω, {{rather than the}} actual 73Ω value applying to the <b>half-wave</b> <b>dipole.</b>|$|E
25|$|Neglecting {{electrical}} inefficiency, {{the antenna}} gain {{is equal to}} the directive gain, which is 1.5 (1.76 dBi) for a short dipole, increasing to 1.64 (2.15 dBi) for a <b>half-wave</b> <b>dipole.</b> For a 5/4 wave dipole the gain further increases to about 5.2 dBi, making this length desirable for that reason even though the antenna is then off-resonance. Longer dipoles than that have radiation patterns that are multi-lobed, with poorer gain (unless they are much longer) even along the strongest lobe. Other enhancements to the dipole (such as including a corner reflector or an array of dipoles) can be considered when more substantial directivity is desired. Such antenna designs, although based on the <b>half-wave</b> <b>dipole,</b> generally acquire their own names.|$|E
50|$|Driven arrays - These are arrays {{in which}} the {{individual}} component antennas are all driven - connected to the transmitter or receiver. The individual antennas, which are usually identical, often consist of single driven elements, such as <b>half-wave</b> <b>dipoles,</b> but may also be composite antennas such as Yagi antennas or turnstile antennas.|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{electromagnetic}} {{simulation of}} electrically-large chemical plants {{is used to}} investigate RF ignition hazards. The proposed analysis is aimed at refining results and procedures detailed in the European Standard CLC/TR 50427, which foresees the use of elemental antennas (loops and <b>half-wave</b> <b>dipoles)</b> for the estimation, via closed-form approximated formulas, of the RF power induced by an impinging electromagnetic field...|$|R
50|$|The term {{antenna array}} most {{commonly}} means a driven array consisting of multiple identical driven elements all {{connected to the}} receiver or transmitter, often <b>half-wave</b> <b>dipoles</b> fed in phase. A parasitic array consists of a single driven element connected to the feedline, and other elements which are not, called parasitic elements. It is usually another name for a Yagi-Uda antenna.|$|R
25|$|Another solution, {{especially}} for receiving antennas, {{is to use}} common 300Ω twin lead {{in conjunction with a}} folded dipole. The folded dipole is similar to the simple <b>half-wave</b> <b>dipole</b> but with the feedpoint impedance multiplied by 4, thus closely matching that 300Ω impedance. This is the most common household antenna for fixed FM broadcast band tuners, which usually include balanced 300Ω antenna input terminals.|$|E
25|$|The earth {{can be used}} as ground plane, but it is a poor conductor. The {{reflected}} antenna {{image is}} only clear at glancing angles (far from the antenna). At these glancing angles, electromagnetic fields and radiation patterns are the same as for a <b>half-wave</b> <b>dipole.</b> Naturally, the impedance of the earth is far inferior to that of a good conductor ground plane. This can be improved (at cost) by laying a copper mesh.|$|E
25|$|Dipoles whose {{length is}} {{approximately}} half the wavelength {{of the signal}} are called half-wave dipoles and are widely used as such or {{as the basis for}} derivative antenna designs. These have a radiation resistance which is much greater, closer to the characteristic impedances of available transmission lines, and normally much larger than the resistance of the conductors, so that their efficiency approaches 100%. In general radio engineering, the term dipole, if not further qualified, is taken to mean a center-fed <b>half-wave</b> <b>dipole.</b>|$|E

We study the input impedance, pattern and gain of such radiating structures. We show that {{the radiation}} resistance of a microstrip dipole increases noticeably at certain frequencies near the resonant frequency of the Hilbert surface. Moreover, antenna gain enhancement at certain frequencies is observed for all dipole sizes we have analyzed...|$|R
50|$|The {{prototype}} had a peak-power of 1 kW, {{and used}} a pulse length of 2 to 3 μs with a 10- to 20 kHz PRF. The receiver was a super-heterodyne type using Acorn tubes and a 6 MHz IF stage. The antenna consisted of 4 rows of 16 <b>half-wave</b> <b>dipoles</b> backed by a 3- by 3-meter mesh screen. The operator used a bicycle-type drive to rotate the antenna, and the elevation could be changed using a hand crank.|$|R
25|$|Antennae are {{generally}} sensitive to signals {{only when they}} have a length that is {{a significant portion of the}} wavelength, or larger. A common example is the <b>half-wave</b> <b>dipole.</b> For longwave use, this resulted in loop antennae tens of feet on a side, often with more than one loop connected together to improve the signal. This presented a significant problem in arranging for the antenna to be rotated. The US Navy overcame this problem, to a point, by mounting long antennae on ships and sailing in circles.|$|E
25|$|The range {{signal was}} {{received}} {{on a single}} <b>half-wave</b> <b>dipole</b> mounted at {{the middle of the}} horizontal antenna array, fed into a four-tube RF receiver, and then into a four-tube intermediate frequency (IF) system. The output was fed directly into the lower Y-axis plate of one of the two CRTs. The upper plate on the Y-axis was fed the output of a calibrator, allowing it to be adjusted so the beam was centred vertically. Signals being received from the antenna would thus cause the beam to deflect downward to produce a blip, {{as in the case of}} Chain Home.|$|E
500|$|Mounting the {{receiver}} in the Heyford {{was not a}} trivial task; the standard <b>half-wave</b> <b>dipole</b> antenna needed to be about [...] long to detect wavelengths of 6.7m. The solution was eventually found by stringing a cable between the Heyford's fixed landing gear struts. A series of dry cell batteries lining the aircraft floor powered {{the receiver}}, providing high voltage for the CRT through an ignition coil taken from a Ford.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{types of}} array antennas are {{constructed}} using multiple <b>dipoles,</b> usually <b>half-wave</b> <b>dipoles.</b> [...] The purpose of using multiple dipoles {{is to increase the}} directional gain of the antenna over the gain of a single dipole; the radiation of the separate dipoles interferes to enhance power radiated in desired directions. [...] In arrays with multiple dipole driven elements, the feedline is split using an electrical network in order to provide power to the elements, with careful attention paid to the relative phase delays due to transmission between the common point and each element.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- A finite-by-infinite {{array of}} thin <b>half-wave</b> <b>dipoles</b> with H-plane scan {{is used to}} show the {{existence}} of a Gibbs’ phenomenon-type standing wave in scan impedance (normalized by the infinite array value) over the elements of the array. The period of this wave is. SA at broadside for X/ 2 array spacing and increases as the scan angle increases by a grating lobe-type expression. A simple empirical model based on Gibbs oscillations is fitted to the scan-impedance wave; the model predicts the 1 /(1 - sin&) period variation, and should be useful for systems trades and for preliminary design purposes...|$|R
50|$|It is also {{possible}} to use multiple active elements and combine them together with transmission lines to produce a similar system where the phases add up to reinforce the output. The antenna array and very similar reflective array antenna consist of multiple elements, often <b>half-wave</b> <b>dipoles,</b> spaced out {{on a plane and}} wired together with transmission lines with specific phase lengths to produce a single in-phase signal at the output. The log-periodic antenna is a more complex design that uses multiple in-line elements similar in appearance to the Yagi-Uda but using transmission lines between the elements to produce the output.|$|R
2500|$|In this {{upper side}} of space, the emitted field has the same {{amplitude}} of the field radiated by a <b>half-wave</b> <b>dipole</b> fed with the same current. Therefore, the total emitted power is half the emitted power of a <b>half-wave</b> <b>dipole</b> fed with the same current. As the current is the same, the radiation resistance (real part of series impedance) will be half of the series impedance of a <b>half-wave</b> <b>dipole.</b> As the reactive part is also divided by 2, the impedance of a quarter-wave antenna is [...] ohms. Since the fields above ground {{are the same as}} for the dipole, but only half the power is applied, the gain is twice (3nbsp&dB over) that of a <b>half-wave</b> <b>dipole</b> (...) , that is, 5.14 dBi.|$|E

Such a dipole has a feedpoint impedance consisting of 73Ω resistance and +43Ω reactance, thus presenting a slightly inductive reactance. In order to cancel that reactance, and present a pure resistance to the feedline, the element is shortened by the factor k for a net length l of: ...|$|E
5000|$|A Yagi - Uda antenna, {{commonly}} known as a Yagi antenna, is a directional antenna consisting of multiple parallel elements in a line, usually <b>half-wave</b> <b>dipoles</b> made of metal rods. [...] Yagi - Uda antennas consist of a single driven element connected to the transmitter or receiver with a transmission line, and additional [...] "parasitic elements" [...] which are not connected to the transmitter or receiver: a so-called reflector and one or more directors. [...] It was invented in 1926 by Shintaro Uda of Tohoku Imperial University, Japan, and (with a lesser role played by his colleague) Hidetsugu Yagi.|$|R
5000|$|Higher-gain {{omnidirectional}} antennas {{can also}} be built. [...] "Higher gain" [...] in this case means that the antenna radiates less energy at higher and lower elevation angles and more in the horizontal directions. High-gain omnidirectional antennas are generally realized using collinear dipole arrays. These consist of multiple <b>half-wave</b> <b>dipoles</b> mounted collinearly (in a line), fed in phase. The coaxial collinear (COCO) antenna uses transposed coaxial sections to produce in-phase half-wavelength radiators. A Franklin Array uses short U-shaped half-wavelength sections whose radiation cancels in the far-field to bring each half-wavelength dipole section into equal phase. Another type is the Omnidirectional Microstrip Antenna (OMA).|$|R
5000|$|Small antennas {{around one}} {{wavelength}} in size, such as quarter-wave monopoles and <b>half-wave</b> <b>dipoles,</b> don't have much directivity (gain); they are omnidirectional antennas which radiate radio waves {{over a wide}} angle. To create a high gain antenna, which radiates radio waves in a narrow beam, two general techniques can be used. One technique is to use large metal surfaces such as parabolic reflectors, horns or dielectric lenses which change {{the direction of the}} radio waves by reflection or refraction, to focus the radio waves from a single low gain antenna into a beam. This type is called an aperture antenna.|$|R
2500|$|The {{most common}} form of dipole is two {{straight}} rods or wires oriented end to end on the same axis, with the feedline connected to the two adjacent ends, but dipoles may be fed anywhere along their length. [...] This is the simplest type of antenna from a theoretical point of view. [...] Dipoles are resonant antennas, meaning that the elements serve as resonators, with standing waves of radio current flowing back and forth between their ends. [...] So the length of the dipole elements is determined by the wavelength of the radio waves used. [...] The {{most common form}} is the <b>half-wave</b> <b>dipole,</b> in which each of the two rod elements is approximately 1/4 wavelength long, so the whole antenna is a half-wavelength long. [...] The radiation pattern of a vertical dipole is omnidirectional; it radiates equal power in all azimuthal directions perpendicular to the axis of the antenna. [...] For a <b>half-wave</b> <b>dipole</b> the radiation is maximum, 2.15 dBi perpendicular to the antenna axis, falling monotonically with elevation angle to zero on the axis, off the ends of the antenna.|$|E
2500|$|A short dipole is a dipole {{formed by}} two {{conductors}} {{with a total}} length L substantially less than a half wavelength (λ/2), the minimum length at which the antenna is resonant at the operating frequency. [...] In {{order to make the}} antenna resonant to feed it efficiently a loading coil is required to cancel the antenna's capacitive reactance. [...] Short dipoles are used in applications where a full <b>half-wave</b> <b>dipole</b> would be too long and cumbersome. [...] As the length is reduced, the quantitative statements below become exact.|$|E
2500|$|The feed antenna at the reflector's {{focus is}} {{typically}} a low-gain type {{such as a}} <b>half-wave</b> <b>dipole</b> or more often a small horn antenna called a feed horn. [...] In more complex designs, such as the Cassegrain and Gregorian, a secondary reflector is used to direct the energy into the parabolic reflector from a feed antenna located away from the primary focal point. [...] The feed antenna {{is connected to the}} associated radio-frequency (RF) transmitting or receiving equipment by means of a coaxial cable transmission line or waveguide.|$|E
50|$|A {{prototype}} {{system was}} built 35 km west of Berlin, {{known as the}} Tremmen Radar Tower. It mounted a large antenna consisting of two rows of four <b>half-wave</b> <b>dipoles</b> aligned horizontally, rotating on a shaft located {{at the top of}} the tower. It was found that at least five pulses needed to be returned in order for the target to become visible on the scope, so the rotation rate of the antenna was adjusted to synchronize with the pulse repetition frequency of the radar. The radio equipment was taken from the Wassermann and Freya units, and operated on a basic wavelength of 2.4 m (~125 MHz).|$|R

Three large platforms were stationed on the tower, at 50, 200 and 350 feet off the ground. A 600 ohm transmission cable was suspended from the top platform to the ground {{on either side of}} the platform (only on the inside of the end towers). Between these vertical feed cables were the antennas proper, eight <b>half-wave</b> <b>dipoles</b> strung between the vertical cables and spaced ½ of a wavelength apart. They were fed from alternating sides so the entire array of cables was in-phase, given their ½ wavelength spacing. Located behind each dipole was a passive reflector wire, spaced 0.18 wavelength back.|$|R
