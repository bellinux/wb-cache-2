25|$|It is very {{uncommon}} for patients not {{to respond to}} TB treatment at all (even transiently), because this implies resistance at base-line {{to all of the}} drugs in the regimen. Patients who fail to get any response at all while on treatment should first of all be questioned very closely about whether or not they have been taking their medicines, and perhaps even be admitted to hospital to be observed taking their treatment. Blood or urine samples may be taken to check for malabsorption of TB drugs. If it can be shown that they are fully compliant with their medication, then the probability that they have another diagnosis (perhaps in addition to the diagnosis of TB) is very high. These patients should have their diagnosis carefully reviewed and specimens obtained for TB culture and sensitivity testing. Patients who <b>get</b> <b>better</b> <b>and</b> then get worse again should likewise be question very closely about adherence to treatment. If adherence is confirmed then they should be investigated for resistant TB (including MDR-TB), even if a specimen has already been obtained for microbiology before commencing treatment.|$|E

500|$|Devil's Due {{released}} three-issue mini-series Halloween: The First Death of Laurie Strode in late 2008. Written by Hutchinson with artwork from Jeff Zornow, {{the story}} bridges {{the gap between}} Halloween II and Halloween H20 by focusing on Laurie Strode {{in the aftermath of}} the 1978 murders. Hutchinson explains that Laurie is [...] "trying to <b>get</b> <b>better</b> <b>and</b> trying to repair, but where do you even start after going through such horror? How do you even try to resume normality when you don't know what that is anymore?" [...] Although Michael appears in the series, it is not clear whether he is real or if the traumatised Laurie is seeing things. Hutchinson is not a fan of the revelation that Laurie and Michael are siblings and took steps to address that problem in the story. He wanted to avoid the [...] "bloodline plot of the middle sequels", which he felt demystified the character of the Shape, and approach the story so that [...] "it becomes almost incidental that she's his sister". Hutchinson believed that Laurie Strode's evolution into Keri Tate was fertile ground for a storyline; he says, [...] "it's not the faking of the death that's interesting at all, but it’s the fall that leads to that happening. The faked death is just simple mechanics and can be covered in a sentence, but the state of mind and events leading to that are full of rich character and dramatic potential." ...|$|E
