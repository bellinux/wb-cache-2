5|$|The manner {{by which}} Hopkins {{distributed}} the spoils was criticized, and <b>his</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> follow his orders {{to patrol the}} Virginia shore resulted in censure by the Continental Congress. After a series of further missteps and accusations, Hopkins was {{forced out of the}} navy in 1778.|$|E
5|$|Bitterest {{of all was}} the {{whispering}} campaign {{directed at}} Anthony Molloy, captain of HMS Caesar. Molloy was accused of cowardice by fellow officers for <b>his</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> follow Howe's orders on both 29 May and 1 June. Molloy's request for an official court-martial to clear his name failed, and although his personal courage was not called into question, his professional ability was. Molloy was dismissed from his ship.|$|E

60|$|The entire {{household}} {{became interested}} in Herr Heinrich's attacks upon Bill's affection. They watched his fingers with particular interest because it was upon those that Bill vented <b>his</b> <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> respond to the stroking advances.|$|R
25|$|Pyrrhus {{was also}} {{known to be}} very benevolent. As a general, Pyrrhus's {{greatest}} political weaknesses were <b>his</b> <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> maintain focus and to maintain a strong treasury at home (many of his soldiers were costly mercenaries).|$|R
5|$|Cook County Commissioner Forrest Claypool filed nominating {{petitions}} {{to run as}} {{an independent}} candidate for assessor. Berrios dropped a challenge to Claypool's nominating petitions after Berrios' lawyers examined Claypool's 90,000 signatures, 65,000 more than required. Berrios prevailed in the November 2010 general election with 46 {{percent of the vote}} in a field that also included Republican Sharon Strobeck-Eckersall. Claypool attributed his defeat to <b>his</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> get enough suburban support to offset Berrios' organization in Chicago.|$|E
5|$|During {{the same}} year, however, he allowed his pro-American {{minister}} of defense, General Lon Nol, {{to crack down}} on leftist activities, crushing the Pracheachon by accusing its members of subversion and subservience to Hanoi. Simultaneously, Sihanouk lost the support of Cambodia's conservatives as a result of <b>his</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> {{come to grips with the}} deteriorating economic situation (exacerbated by the loss of rice exports, most of which went to the PAVN/Viet Cong) and with the growing communist military presence.|$|E
5|$|Finally, the 1681 Scottish Test Act {{required}} {{all public}} officials and MPs to swear unconditional {{loyalty to the}} King but with the crucial qualifier they 'promise to uphold the true Protestant religion.' Tolerance for James' personal Catholicism did not extend to Catholicism in general and <b>his</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> understand this resulted in his deposition and exile by the Glorious Revolution.|$|E

5|$|<b>His</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> {{produce an}} heir caused a {{succession}} crisis. Anjou, Brittany, Maine and Touraine chose Richard's nephew Arthur as heir, while John succeeded in England and Normandy. Philip II of France again destabilised the Plantagenet territories on the European mainland, supporting his vassal Arthur's {{claim to the}} English crown. Eleanor supported her son John, who was victorious at the Battle of Mirebeau and captured the rebel leadership.|$|E
5|$|Hogg {{was well}} {{connected}} with Whig politicians. He received {{an appointment to}} a government commission on municipal corporations and became a revising barrister. His legal career was moderately successful, but he was often frustrated by <b>his</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> attain his goal of becoming a professor or judge. Nevertheless, {{he was able to}} provide for his family thanks to an inheritance and the income from his legal career.|$|E
5|$|In that year, he {{took the}} civil service exam, likely in Chang'an. He failed, to his {{surprise}} and that of centuries of later critics. Hung concludes that he probably failed because his prose style {{at the time was}} too dense and obscure, while Chou suggests <b>his</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> cultivate connections in the capital may have been to blame. After this failure, he went back to traveling, this time around Shandong and Hebei.|$|E
25|$|Pepé {{describes}} Penelope {{as lucky}} to be {{the object of his}} affections, and uses a romantic paradigm <b>to</b> explain <b>his</b> <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> seduce her. For example, he describes a hammer blow to his head as a form of flirtation rather than rejection. Accordingly, he shows no sign of narcissistic injury or loss of confidence {{no matter how many times}} he is rebuffed.|$|R
5000|$|Marshall {{held the}} command of the District of Boise to November 26, 1866. Under attack by the local press for <b>his</b> <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> quell the Snakes, and in disfavor with his superiors, he was {{relieved}} by Captain David Perry, Co. F, 1st Cavalry Regiment, who took temporary command of the district, until Lt. Colonel George R. Crook assumed command on December 11, 1866.|$|R
5000|$|With the {{incumbent}} Republican president greatly weakened by <b>his</b> <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> adequately address the Great Depression, the New York Governor easily carried {{his home state}} {{in the midst of}} a nationwide Democratic landslide. Franklin Roosevelt took 54.07% of the vote in New York State versus Herbert Hoover's 41.33%, a margin of 12.73%. Socialist candidate Norman Thomas finished a distant third with 3.78%.|$|R
5|$|Kristoff, meanwhile, {{expressed}} {{disappointment with}} his second-place finish and <b>his</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> defend his 2014 title. He suggested that another rider {{in the final}} part of the race could have given a better result, as Paolini's tiredness after a long spell {{at the front of}} the race meant that Kristoff had to start his sprint too early. Michael Matthews's third-place finish was the most significant result of his career, but he too was disappointed at having fallen short, after feeling strong on the climb of the Poggio.|$|E
5|$|May 13, 1972: Near Bean Station, Tennessee, between Knoxville and Bristol, a Greyhound Scenicruiser on a {{scheduled}} trip from Memphis to New York City collided head-on with a tractor-trailer truck. The {{driver of the}} bus had begun to pass a car. Fourteen people, including both the bus and truck drivers, died. The National Transportation Safety Board determined {{that the cause of}} the crash was the Greyhound driver's overtaking maneuver and <b>his</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> avoid the truck.|$|E
5|$|The 1841 Alitao {{massacre}} {{became a}} controversial issue in Manila, where flyers criticizing the government's actions were circulated. The Real Audiencia blamed de Oraá for <b>his</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> consult them prior to sending troops, and his {{order to give}} no quarter to the cofradía fighters. Meanwhile, Governor-General de Oraá blamed Colonel Huet for allegedly exceeding his orders.|$|E

50|$|In August 2015, King {{was named}} the least {{effective}} member of Congress by InsideGov due <b>to</b> <b>his</b> persistent <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> get legislation out of committee.|$|R
50|$|The {{owner of}} the Green Drugstore, Kakei {{is the one who}} sends the two boys out on missions, usually without telling them {{everything}} first. He seems to know exactly how things will turn out due to his power of precognition, however it has been noted that this power cannot be used on someone more powerful than himself, {{as in the case of}} <b>his</b> <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> find Tsukiko for Rikuo.|$|R
5|$|The film {{focuses on}} Devadasu and Parvati, {{who have been}} in love since childhood. Parvati's father objects to the {{relationship}} and forces her to marry a middle-aged zamindar. Unable to cope with <b>his</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> win Parvati, Devadas turns into a drunkard, {{and the rest of the}} film is about whether or not Devadas meets Parvati again.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players who would {{represent}} England in the Tests, and were basically a full strength Test team, while Australia fielded their first-choice team. It {{was a chance to}} gain a psychological advantage, and given Harvey's early struggles in English conditions and <b>his</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> pass 25 in his first six innings, he was overlooked as Australia amassed 552 and won by an innings.|$|E
5|$|Waltman was {{not used}} again by TNA until their Final Resolution PPV event on January 15, 2006. There, Waltman {{defeated}} Raven in a Raven's Rules match, forcing Raven to leave TNA in the storyline. Waltman {{was not used}} by the company due to management being angered by <b>his</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> participate at Unbreakable. Despite him not showing up to the event, Waltman was in Orlando and dressed to compete, but did not arrive at the arena in time.|$|E
25|$|It was at {{this time}} that the last Kōdō-ha officer in a {{prominent}} position, Gen. Mazaki, was forced from office. The young officers were enraged by his removal because, having become disillusioned with Araki for <b>his</b> <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> overcome resistance in the cabinet during his time as War Minister, Mazaki had become the focus of their hopes. Muranaka and Isobe released a new pamphlet attacking Nagata for the dismissal, as did Nishida.|$|R
50|$|A rather bumbling character, {{he always}} concocts {{elaborate}} plans and creates fanciful traps {{to catch the}} goats, with limited success. He usually ends up being outwitted by the goats, and is often unable to find loopholes in his overly complex plans. <b>His</b> <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> obtain food are met by angry scoldings from his wife and slapstick violence, such as being hit {{over the head with}} a frying pan. Even so, his love for Red Wolf never wavered.|$|R
5000|$|Philanthropist and {{investor}} Alberto Vilar counted Figaro Systems {{among the}} companies {{in which he was}} a majority shareholder. [...] He donated the company's electronic libretto system to European venues including the Royal Opera House in London, La Scala's Teatro degli Arcimboldi opera houses in Milan, Italy, Gran Teatre del Liceu in Barcelona, Spain, and the Wiener Staatsoper in Wien, Austria. As a consequence of <b>his</b> <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> pay promised donations, most of these companies lost money.|$|R
5|$|After {{becoming}} {{frustrated at}} <b>his</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> {{make an impact}} at Newcastle, Chopra signed for Cardiff City in June 2006 for £500,000. On his decision to leave Newcastle, Chopra stated that he had shown loyalty to the club and expressed his desire to receive the same loyalty from the club. He also added that he would love to return to Newcastle in the future. During the season, Chopra scored 22 goals in 44 matches. He helped the club remain top of the Championship throughout September, earning the Championship Player of the month for September. He was also featured in the PFA Team of the season (an annual award given {{to a set of}} 44 footballers in the top four tiers of English football).|$|E
5|$|After being {{handed the}} number 10 shirt and Italy's playmaking duties, much was {{expected}} of Totti in his debut World Cup under manager Giovanni Trapattoni. Despite a promising start at the 2002 World Cup held in Japan and Korea, as he set-up Christian Vieri's first goal in Italy's 2–0 opening win over Ecuador, disappointment followed, with Totti failing to score or make a significant impact throughout the tournament. Despite helping to set up Vieri's goal in a disappointing and controversial 2–1 defeat to Croatia in Italy's second group match, his lacklustre performances throughout the tournament were later criticised by the Italian media, in particular <b>his</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> capitalise on several scoring chances in Italy's 1–1 draw against Mexico in their final group match, as Italy only narrowly qualified for the knockout stage.|$|E
5|$|After the 2008 TNA World X Cup Tournament concluded, Kaz {{challenged}} Petey Williams for the TNA X Division Championship on the July17 {{episode of}} Impact!. Kaz failed to defeat Williams for the championship. Kaz then {{entered into a}} storyline in which he quit TNA due to <b>his</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> win the World X Cup Tournament, the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, and the X Division Championship on several occasions, with the narrative beginning on the July31 episode of Impact!. Kaz later returned as the Suicide character on December7 at TNA's Final Resolution PPV event.|$|E
5000|$|Since September 2012, {{there has}} been an {{increasing}} outcry against Raisani, following <b>his</b> government's <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> maintain law and order in Baluchistan, resulting in the mass murder of the Shiah Hazaras community there ...|$|R
50|$|Being the {{favourite}} {{in every}} competition he enters, {{it is natural}} that <b>his</b> <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> win have received some attention. Most notable among these is his performance in the Sydney Olympics in 2000, when {{at the prospect of}} winning his third Olympic gold medal (something no RFP shooter before has managed) he only finished fifth. However, his results since then have proved that this was not the beginning of a long-term decline, and in the Athens Olympics in 2004, he finally won his third Olympic gold.|$|R
25|$|Acremant {{left his}} job at Roadway Trucking {{to start his own}} {{software}} business. He became frustrated by the <b>failure</b> of <b>his</b> software company, and <b>his</b> own <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> find a job and achieve financial security.|$|R
