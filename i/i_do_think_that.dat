Brown said “I am extremely disappointed that four of our student-athletes have had issues with the law this summer. That is not reflective of the high standard of class, character and integrity we have established at Texas for many years. It’s a shame that these recent events have generated {{a great deal of}} negative attention, because <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> overall, this is as good of a group of kids that I’ve ever coached. I think that will show over time.” The negative publicity was more extensive than in past instances but Mack Brown publicly supported the players while denouncing their actions.|$|E

Describing the fan following of the books, the Phoenix New Times wrote, [...] "Meyer's fandom {{is reminiscent of}} Harry Potter mania." [...] The Daily Telegraph described Twilight as the [...] "spiritual successor to Harry Potter". Rebekah Bradford of The Post and Courier stated that the series has a [...] "huge crossover appeal much like the Harry Potter books before them." [...] According to the Daily Telegraph, [...] "Stephenie Meyer, in particular, has achieved incredible success across all the English-speaking nations and Europe and many will say that her Twilight series has filled the hole left by Harry Potter." [...] Meyer has responded to such comparisons, saying, [...] "It's terribly flattering to be compared to her, but there's {{never going to be}} another J. K. Rowling; that's a phenomenon that's not gonna happen again", however noting that [...] "you can compare my fans to her fans more easily [...] <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> we both have people who are just really really enthusiastic, and will come miles to see you and be involved, and everybody really cares about our characters." ...|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé {{has worked}} with {{numerous}} directors for her music videos throughout her career, including Melina Matsoukas, Jonas Åkerlund, and Jake Nava. India Hill of Teen Vogue wrote, [...] "When Beyoncé does something, you listen. Not just because her lyrics are infectious and her beats are always catchy, but because if she has something to say, you know it’s going to be important." [...] Megan Carpentier of The Guardian commented [...] "It is not an {{exaggeration to say that}} there is no other living musical artist who could ignite such a broad and unavoidable conversation just by releasing a new album – even a visual one, and it’s her second visual album – or who could turn an hour-long, visually narrative film for that album into a Saturday night watch-with-your-friends event on subscription cable channel." [...] Bill Condon, director of Beauty and the Beast, stated that the LEMONADE visuals in particular served as inspiration for the Beauty and the Beast film, commenting [...] "You look at Beyonce’s brilliant movie Lemonade, this genre is taking on so many different forms… <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> this very old-school break-out-into-song traditional musical is something that people understand again and really want." [...] Beyoncé's music videos explore many different topics and themes such as women empowerment, depression, affairs, and racial injustice, including [...] "Formation" [...] and [...] "Pretty Hurts". Her self-titled visual album explores darker music videos such as [...] "Haunted", which drew comparisons to Madonna's Justify My Love". In 2017, she released the controversial music video for [...] "Formation", which includes representations of racial injustice against African Americans in the United States during the Black Lives Matter movement.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} half of the 1880s, Stanford collaborated with the author Gilbert à Beckett on two operas, Savonarola, and The Canterbury Pilgrims. The former was well {{received}} at its premiere in Hamburg in April 1884, but received a critical savaging when staged at Covent Garden in July of the same year. Parry commented privately, [...] "It seems very badly constructed for the stage, poorly conceived and the music, though clean and well-managed, is not striking or dramatic." [...] The most severe public criticism was in The Theatre, whose reviewer wrote, [...] "The book of Savonarola is dull, stilted, and, from a dramatic point of view, weak. It is not, however, so crushingly tiresome as the music fitted to it. Savonarola has gone far to convince me that opera is quite out of [...] line and that the sooner he abandons the stage for the cathedral, the better for his musical reputation." [...] The Canterbury Pilgrims had been premiered in London in April 1884, three months before Savonarola was presented at Covent Garden. It had a better reception than the latter, though reviews pointed out Stanford's debt to Die Meistersinger, and complained of a lack of emotion in the love music. George Grove agreed with the critics, writing to Parry, [...] "Charlie's music contains everything but sentiment. Love not at all – that I heard not a grain of. ... And <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> there might be more tune. Melody is not a thing to be avoided surely." [...] In 1896 a critic wrote that the opera had [...] "just such a 'book' as would have suited the late Alfred Cellier. He would probably have made of it a charming light English opera. But Dr. Stanford has chosen to use it for the exemplification of those advanced theories which we know him to hold, and he has given us music which would incline us to think that Die Meistersinger had been his model. The effect of the combination is not happy." ...|$|E

But <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> a fighter like the Ray Leonards or anyone like that would beat a guy [...] if they come with their game.

2500|$|Reflecting on {{his first}} six novels and his rapid writing {{turnover}} later in his career, DeLillo remarked, [...] "I wasn't learning {{to slow down and}} examine what I was doing more closely. I don't have regrets about that work, but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> if I had been a bit less hasty in starting each new book, I might have produced somewhat better work in the 1970s. My first novel took so long and was such an effort that once I was free of it I almost became carefree in a sense and moved right through the decade, stopping, in a way, only at Ratner's Star (1976), which was an enormous challenge for me, and probably a bigger challenge for the reader. But I slowed down in the 1980s and '90s." [...] DeLillo has also acknowledged some of the weaknesses of his 1970s works, reflecting in 2007: [...] "I knew I wasn’t doing utterly serious work, let me put it that way." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chomsky {{was always}} {{critical}} of the Soviet Union and he does now accept that Mao's regime in China was responsible for 'a huge death toll, {{in the tens of}} millions'. However, back in 1960s, Chomsky was considerably less {{critical of the}} communist movements in Asia, noting what he considered to be grassroots elements within both Chinese and Vietnamese communism. In December 1967, during a forum in New York, Chomsky responded to criticisms of the Chinese revolution as follows, [...] "I don't feel that they deserve a blanket condemnation at all. There are many things to object to in any society. But take China, modern China; one also finds many things that are really quite admirable." [...] Chomsky continued: [...] "There are even better examples than China. But <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> China is an important example of a new society in which very interesting positive things happened at the local level, in which {{a good deal of the}} collectivization and communization was really based on mass participation and took place after a level of understanding had been reached in the peasantry that led to this next step." [...] He said of Vietnam: [...] "Although there appears to be a high degree of democratic participation at the village and regional levels, still major planning is highly centralized in the hands of the state authorities." ...|$|E
2500|$|Carlo Santos of Anime News Network {{felt that}} the dead baby trope and pushover protagonists were {{overused}} by Tatsumi to elicit emotion. He also criticized the choice to flip the art. Santos concludes that [...] "although the stories hammer the same point over and over again, and seemingly with the same character each time, their brutal honesty and stark settings will be a refreshing change for readers who wonder {{whatever happened to the}} diversity of the [...] artform." [...] Tim O'Neil of PopMatters noted the dark and misanthropic themes in the stories, but said that Tatsumi distinguishes himself with the longer stories, especially [...] "Who Are You", because of their [...] "narrative lyricism" [...] and [...] "subjectivity". Grant Goodman of Comics Village felt that Tatsumi's characters were portrayed through his art rather than dialogue, saying of his stories: [...] "I cannot call any of them particularly excellent, but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Tatsumi's style is refreshing and a welcome alternative to the style of current manga best-sellers." [...] Ng Suat Tong of the Hooded Utilitarian criticized the art, describing it as [...] "crude, inexperienced and laid down with the kind of haste which begets mistakes" [...] as well as the predictable misogyny in the stories and their linear structure, especially disliking [...] "Telescope". Daryl Surat of the Anime World Order podcast {{felt that the}} stories in the manga were a product of postwar Japan and difficult to identify with in a modern context, adding that the although the stories are similar, they are more concentrated due to their short length. In a starred review, Publishers Weekly compared the tone of the stories as [...] "between contemporary short fiction and EC Comics' old 'shock' comics", noting the theme of social maladjustment and complimenting Tatsumi's [...] "evocative settings" [...] and the flow of his stories. Andrew D. Arnold of Time complimented the naturalism of the stories and art, but disliked the misogyny present in the men's relationships, concluding that the collection [...] "feels as fresh and revelatory as when the works of Japanese cinema first began arriving in the U.S." [...] R.C. Baker of The Village Voice said that the manga's expressive art helped speak for its silent characters and that the subject matter distinguished itself from modern Japanese popular culture: [...] "A fearless spelunker of the id, Tatsumi delves beneath the button-down uniformity of Japan's legions of office drones." [...] Tom Rosin of Manga Life was reminded of kitchen sink films by the stories and called Tatsumi a [...] "master of the short story", saying that the manga [...] "is so unlike the Japanese comics we're accustomed to now, and such a strong example of his early work I find it slightly terrifying that this book only contains selections of his best comics from 1969!" [...] David Cozy of the Asahi Herald Tribune felt that manga was distinguished from literature with the eight-page limit—which forced Tatsumi to distill his stories and was appropriate for representing his [...] "characters' constricted lives"—as well as with the identifiable [...] "everyman" [...] in his art.|$|E
