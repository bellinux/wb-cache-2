These digits identify a specific delivery route, such as {{one side of a}} building, a group of apartments, or several floors of a large office building. Although using the ZIP+4 offers higher accuracy, addressing redundancy, and sorting efficiency within the USPS, it is optional and not widely used by the general public. It is primarily only used by business mailers.|$|E

The standard notes that [...] "The basic format should be avoided in plain text." [...] The separator used between date values (year, month, week, and day) is the hyphen, while the colon is used as the separator between time values (hours, minutes, and seconds). For example, the 6th day of the 1st month of the year 2009 may be written as [...] in the <b>extended</b> <b>format</b> or simply as [...] "20090106" [...] in the basic format without ambiguity.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the design}} {{rationale}} of the x87 [...] 80-bit format, Kahan notes: [...] "This <b>Extended</b> <b>format</b> {{is designed to}} be used, with negligible loss of speed, for all but the simplest arithmetic with float and double operands. For example, it should be used for scratch variables in loops that implement recurrences like polynomial evaluation, scalar products, partial and continued fractions. It often averts premature Over/Underflow or severe local cancellation that can spoil simple algorithms". Computing intermediate results in an <b>extended</b> <b>format</b> with high precision and extended exponent has precedents in the historical practice of scientific calculation and in the design of scientific calculators e.g. Hewlett-Packard's financial calculators performed arithmetic and financial functions to three more significant decimals than they stored or displayed. The implementation of extended precision enabled standard elementary function libraries to be readily developed that normally gave double precision results within one unit in the last place (ULP) at high speed.|$|E

2500|$|The floating-point unit (FPU) on all {{subsequent}} x86 processors have supported this format. [...] As a result software {{can be developed}} which {{takes advantage of the}} higher precision provided by this format. William Kahan, a primary designer of the x87 arithmetic and initial IEEE 754 standard proposal notes {{on the development of the}} x87 floating point: [...] "An <b>Extended</b> <b>format</b> as wide as we dared (80 bits) was included to serve the same support role as the 13-decimal internal format serves in Hewlett-Packard’s 10-decimal calculators." [...] Moreover, Kahan notes that 64 bits was the widest significand across which carry propagation could be done without increasing the cycle time on the 8087, and that the x87 extended precision was designed to be extensible to higher precision in future processors: [...] "For now the 10-byte <b>Extended</b> <b>format</b> is a tolerable compromise between the value of extra-precise arithmetic and the price of implementing it to run fast; very soon two more bytes of precision will become tolerable, and ultimately a 16-byte format... That kind of gradual evolution towards wider precision was already in view when IEEE Standard 754 for Floating-Point Arithmetic was framed." ...|$|E
2500|$|A Microsoft IntelliMouse {{relies on}} an {{extension}} of the PS/2 protocol: the ImPS/2 or IMPS/2 protocol (the abbreviation combines the concepts of [...] "IntelliMouse" [...] and [...] "PS/2"). It initially operates in standard PS/2 format, for backwards compatibility. After the host sends a special command sequence, it switches to an <b>extended</b> <b>format</b> in which a fourth byte carries information about wheel movements. The IntelliMouse Explorer works analogously, with the difference that its 4-byte packets also allow for two additional buttons (for a total of five).|$|E
2500|$|The {{number of}} bits needed for the {{exponent}} of the extended precision format follows from the requirement that the product of two double precision numbers should not overflow when computed using the <b>extended</b> <b>format.</b> [...] The largest possible exponent of a double precision value is 1023 so the exponent of the largest possible product of two double precision numbers is 2047 (an 11-bit value). [...] Adding in a bias to account for negative exponents means that the exponent field {{must be at least}} 12 bits wide.|$|E

2500|$|Combining these requirements: [...] 1 bit for the sign, 12 bits for the biased exponent, and 64 bits for the significand {{means that}} the <b>extended</b> {{precision}} <b>format</b> would need at least 77 bits. [...] Engineering considerations resulted in the final definition of the 80-bit format (in particular the IEEE 754 standard requires the exponent range of an <b>extended</b> precision <b>format</b> to match that of the next largest, quad, precision format which is 15 bits).|$|R

2500|$|The IBM 1130 offered two {{floating}} point formats: [...] a 32-bit [...] "standard precision" [...] format and a 40-bit [...] "extended precision" [...] format. [...] Standard precision format contained a 24-bit two's complement significand while extended precision utilized a 32-bit two's complement significand. The latter format could make {{full use of}} the cpu's 32-bit integer operations. [...] The characteristic in both formats was an 8-bit field containing the power of two biased by 128. [...] Floating-point arithmetic operations were performed by software, and double precision was not supported at all. The <b>extended</b> <b>format</b> occupied three 16-bit words, with the extra space simply ignored.|$|E
2500|$|The IA32, x86-64, and Itanium {{processors}} {{support an}} 80-bit [...] "double extended" [...] extended precision format with a 64-bit significand. [...] The Intel 8087 math coprocessor {{was the first}} x86 device which supported floating point arithmetic in hardware. [...] It was designed to support a 32-bit [...] "single precision" [...] format and a 64-bit [...] "double precision" [...] format for encoding and interchanging floating point numbers. [...] The temporary real (<b>extended)</b> <b>format</b> was designed not to store data at higher precision as such, but rather primarily {{to allow for the}} computation of double results more reliably and accurately by minimising overflow and roundoff-errors in intermediate calculations: for example, many floating point algorithms (e.g. exponentiation) suffer from significant precision loss when computed using the most direct implementations. [...] To mitigate such issues the internal registers in the 8087 were designed to hold intermediate results in an 80-bit [...] "extended precision" [...] format. [...] The 8087 automatically converts numbers to this format when loading floating point registers from memory and also converts results back to the more conventional formats when storing the registers back into memory. To enable intermediate subexpressions results to be saved in extended precision scratch variables and continued across programming language statements, and otherwise interrupted calculations to resume where they were interrupted, it provides instructions which transfer values between these internal registers and memory without performing any conversion, which therefore enables access to the <b>extended</b> <b>format</b> for calculations- also reviving the issue of the accuracy of functions of such numbers, but at a higher precision.|$|E

50|$|The {{standard}} specifies {{extended and}} extendable precision formats, which are recommended for allowing a greater precision than that {{provided by the}} basic <b>formats.</b> An <b>extended</b> precision <b>format</b> <b>extends</b> a basic <b>format</b> by using more precision and more exponent range. An extendable precision format allows the user to specify the precision and exponent range. An implementation may use whatever internal representation it chooses for such formats; all {{that needs to be}} defined are its parameters (b, p, and emax). These parameters uniquely describe the set of finite numbers (combinations of sign, significand, and exponent for the given radix) that it can represent.|$|R

2500|$|Double extended, {{also called}} [...] "extended precision" [...] format. This is a binary format that {{occupies}} at least 79 bits (80 if the hidden/implicit bit rule is not used) and its significand has a precision {{of at least}} 64 bits (about 19 decimal digits). A format satisfying the minimal requirements (64-bit precision, 15-bit exponent, thus fitting on 80 bits) {{is provided by the}} x86 architecture. [...] In general on such processors, this format can be used with [...] "long double" [...] in the C language family (the C99 and C11 standards [...] "IEC 60559 floating-point arithmetic extension- Annex F" [...] recommend the 80-bit <b>extended</b> <b>format</b> to be provided as [...] "long double" [...] when available). [...] On other processors, [...] "long double" [...] may be a synonym for [...] "double" [...] if any form of extended precision is not available, or may stand for a larger format, such as quadruple precision.|$|E
2500|$|Caruso's {{earliest}} American {{records of}} operatic arias and songs, like their thirty or so Milan-made predecessors, {{were accompanied by}} piano. From February 1906, however, orchestral accompaniments became the norm, utilizing an ensemble of between eleven and twenty musicians. The regular conductors of these recording sessions with orchestra were Walter B. Rogers and, from 1916, Josef Pasternack. Beginning in 1932, RCA Victor in the US and EMI (HMV) in the UK, reissued several of the old discs with the existing accompaniment over-dubbed by a larger electrically recorded orchestra. (Earlier experiments using this re-dubbing technique, carried out by Victor in 1927, had been considered unsatisfactory.) In 1950, RCA Victor reissued a number of [...] Caruso recordings on 78-rpm discs pressed on red vinylite {{instead of the usual}} shellac. As long-playing discs (LPs) became popular, many of his recordings were electronically enhanced with reverb and similar effects to make them sound [...] "fuller" [...] for release on the <b>extended</b> <b>format.</b> Several Caruso recordings were also released by RCA Victor on their 45-rpm format during the 1950s.|$|E
50|$|For an <b>extended</b> <b>format</b> with a {{precision}} between two basic formats the exponent range {{must be as}} great {{as that of the}} next wider basic format.
