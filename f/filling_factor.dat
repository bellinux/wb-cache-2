Despite such infinitesimal thickness, it consists of several layers of particles. The ε ring is a rather crowded place with a <b>filling</b> <b>factor</b> near the apoapsis estimated by different sources at from 0.008 to 0.06. The mean size of the ring particles is 0.2–20.0m, and the mean separation is around 4.5 times their radius. The ring is almost devoid of dust, possibly due to the aerodynamic drag from Uranus's extended atmospheric corona. Due to its razor-thin nature the ε ring is invisible when viewed edge-on. This happened in 2007 when a ring plane-crossing was observed.|$|E

Conventional focal plane arrays (FPAs) utilize square detector elements with a nearly 100 % <b>fill</b> <b>factor,</b> where <b>fill</b> <b>factor</b> {{is defined as the}} fraction of the detector element area that is active in light detection. A large <b>fill</b> <b>factor</b> is generally considered to be desirable because more photons are collected for a given pitch, and this leads to a higher signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). However, the large active area works against super-resolution (SR) image restoration by acting as an additional low pass filter in the overall PSF when modeled on the SR sampling grid.
