40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Sociology, Washington State UniversityA {{growing body}} of {{literature}} identifies social network contacts as playing an integral part in linking <b>job</b> <b>seekers</b> with <b>jobs.</b> Most {{research in this area}} focuses on people after they have found work with the help of their contacts. Scholars are increasingly recognizing this approach is problematic because it cannot reveal anything about <b>job</b> <b>seekers</b> who are unable to find work with the help of their contacts or the reasons they are unsuccessful. To address these problems, I study social network contact use, but from the perspective of contacts rather than <b>job</b> <b>seekers.</b> I use survey data I collected from a random sample of 577 Washington state adults, most of whom were recently asked to provide help with someone's job search. In the first analysis, I examine the factors that affect whether contacts help <b>job</b> <b>seekers</b> with their search and whether <b>job</b> <b>seekers</b> receive employment offers as a result of social networking. I find that contacts' resources, the strength of the relationship between contacts and <b>job</b> <b>seekers,</b> and <b>job</b> seekers' characteristics affect both outcomes. In the second analysis, I concentrate on homophily between contacts and <b>job</b> <b>seekers.</b> I find {{that the vast majority of}} <b>job</b> <b>seekers</b> turn to same sex or race contacts for help with their job search, but not similarly aged or educated contacts. Analyses show that the effect of homophily on contacts' provision of help and job seekers' receipt of an offer are complex and inconsistent. The third part of my dissertation examines how contacts' residence in either an urban or rural community affects their likelihood of providing help with a job search. I find that geographic context matters; <b>job</b> <b>seekers</b> who ask rural contacts for help with their job search are less successful than <b>job</b> <b>seekers</b> who rely on urban contacts. By differentiating between <b>job</b> <b>seekers</b> who successfully and unsuccessfully use social network contacts for their job searches, my dissertation offers new empirical evidence that can help scholars identify the mechanisms whereby social network use in the job attainment process works and labor market inequality is perpetuated.

They also examine the effect of a <b>job</b> <b>seeker’s</b> network on important job search out-comes, including occupational status and salary following reemployment. Results reveal the subsequent emergence of distinct networking strategies and outcomes dependent on industry growth. <b>Job</b> <b>seekers</b> displaced from growing industries tend to focus their search on the inclusion of weak ties. Their counterparts, displaced from declining industries, indicate the tendency to connect with strong ties. However, <b>job</b> <b>seekers</b> in declining industries who made the more diffi-cult connections with weakly tied contacts reaped important benefits in terms of salary following reemployment. The theoretical and practical implications for conducting a job search in a con-temporary environment are discussed, along with suggestions for future research.
