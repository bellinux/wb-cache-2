You will see therefore that while it is not a pleasant thing to work in competition with others it seems almost a necessity. You can sympathize.|$|E

In the first professional indoor football game, Syracuse defeated the heavily favored New York team. During the series, Warner was seriously cut {{on the side of}} his head. Although <b>he</b> <b>laughed</b> it off at first, the injury turned out to be more serious and he was replaced with Blondy Wallace for the rest of the series. For the tournament, Warner and the other team members earned $23 (approximately $816 in 2016), although the expected share was $300 (approximately $8,000 in 2016) per player; it was a financial failure.|$|E

25|$|The main {{script and}} {{branching}} storylines {{were written by}} author and screenwriter Satoru Akahori. Hiroi revealed that the setting of Sakura Wars was based on his family history, so felt that it would lose its entertainment value if he wrote the game's script himself. Hiroi had previously worked with Akahori on other projects, so Akahori was brought on board. When Akahori first heard the concept before talking with Hiroi, <b>he</b> <b>laughed</b> {{and said it would}} be better to try blending the stories of Haikara-san ga Tōru and Teito Monogatari. He was later convinced to join the project after talking with Hiroi. When first pitched the project, all that had been finalized was that the story would involve young girls and mecha. Akahori was unsure how to approach the project as he had never written for a video game, but Hiroi told him to write the story like an anime television. When Akahori first joined the team, the story was still in an unfinished state: the only points finalized were its setting, overall theme of steampunk mecha combat, and a cast of five or six characters. Akahori's early work was focused on expanding the narrative and characters based on Hiroi's draft. Due to the deep connection to Hiroi's family history, Akahori could not work on the script by himself, needing frequent consultation with Hiroi. Hiroi also insisted on making frequent changes if Akahori's work did not fall in line with his vision. Akahori wrote a thirteen-episode storyline for the game, with the final battle taking place across three episodes. After talks with staff, the final battle was condensed into a single chapter, bringing the game to its current ten-episode length. Kaneko and Morita created the additional dialogue around Akahori's main scenario, along with other duties such as script editing and debugging.|$|E

Once, <b>he</b> <b>laughed</b> at the sage Ashtavakra ("one who was eight deformities"), who cursed {{him to become a}} Rakshasa, though the sage assured him that Rama would free him of the curse.

500|$|The anglicized name Isaac is a {{transliteration}} of the Hebrew term Yiṣḥāq which literally means [...] "He laughs/will laugh." [...] Ugaritic texts {{dating from}} the 13th century BCE refer to the benevolent smile of the Canaanite deity El. Genesis, however, ascribes the laughter to Isaac's parents, Abraham and Sarah, rather than El. According to the biblical narrative, Abraham fell {{on his face and}} laughed when God (Hebrew, Elohim) imparted the news of their son's eventual birth. <b>He</b> <b>laughed</b> because Sarah was past the age of childbearing; both she and Abraham were advanced in age. Later, when Sarah overheard three messengers of the Lord renew the promise, she laughed inwardly for the same reason. Sarah denied laughing when God questioned Abraham about it.|$|E
500|$|In January 1970, Rolling Stone asked Hendrix {{about having}} {{testified that he}} stopped using cannabis; <b>he</b> <b>laughed</b> and replied: [...] "At least, stop it from growing". When pressed he answered: [...] "I'm too... wrecked right now." [...] His {{management}} was concerned that the incident might provoke cancellations during the concurrent tour, but the story stayed largely unknown until after the tour had ended. His public relations manager, Michael Goldstein, later revealed that he had bribed {{a member of the}} Associated Press with a case of liquor to prevent the story from going out on the wire. Goldstein commented: [...] "I knew that a million dollars was riding on that story not getting on UPI and the AP wire...

Delgado said the script was intelligent and praised the theme of over-analyzing art. He also praised the vomiting jokes, and said he could not remember the last time <b>he</b> <b>laughed</b> so hard during a South Park episode. Entertainment Weekly television columnist Ken Tucker said it was better than the season premiere, which he also praised.

500|$|The pilot {{episode of}} Community {{received}} generally favorable reviews from critics.

Entertainment Weeklys Ken Tucker called it [...] "One of the new season's best sitcoms", {{and gave it a}} grade B+. Heather Havrilesky, writing for Salon.com, agreed with this assessment, and commended the [...] "alarmingly smart writing". Alan Sepinwall at The Star-Ledger similarly called it [...] "the best, and funniest, new show of the season", and said <b>he</b> <b>laughed</b> just as much after seeing the pilot four times. Others were less impressed; Varietys Brian Lowry found the satire wanting, and did not much appreciate McHale's performance. The Miami Heralds Glenn Garvin found that, though particularly McHale was capable of generating [...] "sporadic laughter", the show was just not very amusing.|$|E

Through his years of financial hardship, he was able to continue publishing papers—his most productive years were 1884 and 1885, with 79 and 62 papers published, respectively. The 1880s marked the publication of two of the best-known fossil taxa described by Cope: the pelycosaur Edaphosaurus in 1882 and the early dinosaur Coelophysis in 1889. In 1889, he succeeded Leidy, who had died the previous year, as professor of zoology at the University of Pennsylvania. The small yearly stipend was enough for Cope's family to move back into one of the townhouses he had been forced to relinquish earlier.|$|E

500|$|Daniel Craig as James Bond. Craig's {{physical}} training for his reprise {{of the role}} placed extra effort into running and boxing, to spare him the injuries he sustained on his stunts in the first film. Craig felt he was fitter, being less bulky than in the first film. He also practised speedboating and stunt driving. Craig felt Casino Royale was [...] "a walk in the park" [...] compared to Quantum of Solace, which required a different performance from him because Quantum of Solace is a revenge film, not a love story like Casino Royale. While filming in Pinewood, he suffered a gash when kicked in his face, which required eight stitches, and a fingertip was sliced off. <b>He</b> <b>laughed</b> these off, noting they did not delay filming, and joked his finger wound would enable {{him to have a}} criminal career (though it had grown back when he made this comment). He also had minor plastic surgery on his face. The actor advised Paul Haggis on the script and helped choose Marc Forster as the director.|$|E
500|$|Berkowitz (real name Scott Putesky) later {{claimed to}} have been [...] "shut out" [...] of {{recording}} sessions, and alleged that other band members destroyed much of his equipment—the four-track recorder, which had been used to produce many of the band's early demos, had been microwaved, and his drum machine had been discarded. The latter was subsequently revealed to have been thrown from a second-story window. He was also highly critical of Reznor, whom he alleged destroyed a Fender Jaguar which had been given to him by his father as a child, saying: [...] "I was in the studio, and they were all in the control room, and I'm playing guitar. At the end, Trent says, 'Do it again, but do it more like this.' We went through this three times, and he says, 'Hold on. I'll come in there. Let me show you what I'm talking about.'

Cox, who had been suffering from severe exhaustion and was exhibiting symptoms of paranoia, mutually agreed with Hendrix that they should suspend their plans to collaborate musically. When Altham asked Hendrix: [...] "Do you feel any kind of compulsion to prove yourself as King Guitar", Hendrix replied: [...] "No, I don't even let that bother me. Because they {{say a lot of}} things about people that, if they let it bother them, they wouldn't even be around today... King Guitar now? Wow, that's a bit heavy."
