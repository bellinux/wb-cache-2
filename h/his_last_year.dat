5|$|On May 18, 2017 sources {{confirmed}} that Cotto had parted ways with promoter Roc Nation Sports. One {{of the main}} reasons for the split was due to not having an opponent lined up even though he mentioned 2017 would be <b>his</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> in the sport and he would like to have had two fights. A fight with Japanese boxer Yoshihiro Kamegai (27-3-2, 24 KOs) was penciled in for June 24, but fell through. HBO also did not back the fight.|$|E

5|$|Beginning to play {{organized}} hockey {{at the age}} of four, Hamhuis was {{competing against}} other players as old as eight years, as his hometown was not big enough to fill teams for younger age groups. He went to provincials four seasons in a row and won the title with his club, the Smithers Storm, in overtime during <b>his</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> of minor hockey. Future Predators teammate Cody Franson was a stick boy for Hamhuis' team, while another Nashville blueliner, Shea Weber, did the same for a competing team at provincial tournaments.

5|$|During {{the period}} the Greens were separated, Debora met Michael Farrar, {{a student in}} his twenties {{completing}} <b>his</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> of medical school. Farrar was struck by Green's intelligence and vitality, though he was embarrassed by her habit of explosively losing her temper at minor slights. In contrast, Green felt that Farrar was a stable, dependable presence. The couple were married on May 26, 1979. When Farrar was accepted for an internal medicine residency at the University of Cincinnati, the couple moved to Ohio. Green went into practice at Jewish Hospital as an emergency physician, but grew dissatisfied and eventually switched specialties.
