40|$|As China {{enters the}} twenty-first century {{the health of the}} {{agricultural}} economy will increasingly rely, not on the growth of inputs, but on the growth of total factor productivity (TFP). However, the tremendous changes in the sector-sometimes back and sometimes forwards-as well as evolving institutions make it difficult to gauge from casual observation if the sector is healthy or not. Research spending has waxed and waned. Policies to encourage the import of foreign technologies have been applied unevenly. Structural adjustment policies also triggered wrenching changes in the sector. Horticulture and livestock production has boomed; while the output of other crops, such as rice, wheat and soybeans, has stagnated or fallen. At a time when China's millions of producers are faced with complex decisions, the extension system is crumbling and <b>farmer</b> <b>professional</b> <b>associations</b> remain in their infancy. In short, there are just as many reasons to be optimistic about the productivity trends in agriculture as to be pessimistic. In this paper, we pursue one overall goal: to better understand the productivity trends in China's agricultural sector during the reform era-with an emphasis on the 1990 - 2004 period. To do so, we pursue three specific objectives. First, relying on the National Cost of Production Data Set-China's most complete set of farm input and output data-we chart the input and output trends for 23 of China's main farm commodities. Second, using a stochastic production frontier function approach we estimate the rate of change in TFP for each commodity. Finally, we decompose the changes in TFP into two components: changes in efficiency and changes in technical change. Our findings-especially after the early 1990 s are remarkably consistent. China's agricultural TFP has grown at a healthy rate for all 23 commodities. TFP growth for the staple commodities generally rose around 2 % annually; TFP growth for most horticulture and livestock commodities was even higher (between 3 and 5 %). Equally consistent, we find that most of the change is accounted for by technical change. The analysis is consistent with the conclusion that new technologies have pushed out the production functions, since technical change accounts for most of the rise in TFP. In the case of many of the commodities, however, the efficiency of producers-that is, the average distance of producers from the production frontier-has fallen. In other words, China's TFP growth would have been even higher had the efficiency of production not eroded the gains of technical change. Although we do not pinpoint the source of rising inefficiency, the results are consistent with a story that there is considerable disequilibrium in the farm economy during this period of rapid structural change and farmers are getting little help in making these adjustments from the extension system...|$|R

40|$|Engaging Queensland primary {{teachers}} in <b>professional</b> <b>associations</b> {{can be a}} challenge, particularly for subject-specific <b>associations.</b> <b>Professional</b> <b>associations</b> are recognised providers of professional learning. By not being involved in <b>professional</b> <b>associations</b> primary teachers are missing potential quality professional learning opportunities that can impact {{the results of their}} students. The purpose of the research is twofold: Firstly, to provide a thorough understanding of the current context in order to assist <b>professional</b> <b>associations</b> who wish to change from their current level of primary teacher engagement; and secondly, to contribute to the literature in the area of professional learning for primary teachers within <b>professional</b> <b>associations.</b> Using a three part research design, interviews of primary teachers and focus groups of <b>professional</b> <b>association</b> participants and executives were conducted and themed to examine the current context of engagement. Force field analysis was used to provide the framework to identify the driving and restraining forces for primary teacher engagement in professional learning through <b>professional</b> <b>associations.</b> Communities of practice and professional learning communities were specifically examined as potential models for <b>professional</b> <b>associations</b> to consider. The outcome is a diagrammatic framework outlining the current context of primary teacher engagement, specifically the driving and restraining forces of primary teacher engagement with <b>professional</b> <b>associations.</b> This research also identifies considerations for <b>professional</b> <b>associations</b> wishing to change their level of primary teacher engagement.
