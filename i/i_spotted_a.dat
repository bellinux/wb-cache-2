Santer stated: [...] "I just think everyone did brilliantly tonight—the cast, the crew, everyone. It's everything I wished for and more. I'm thrilled with how it went. It was quite remarkable.

[...] Santer explained that he had always intended for Stacey to be revealed as Archie's killer, and was never tempted to air a different conclusion, despite at least ten characters having strong motives. Turner {{was surprised to learn}} that Stacey was the killer, and hoped that viewers would sympathise with her character, observing: [...] "She not only has to deal with the guilt of what she did but she also knows that she's inadvertently responsible for Bradley's death.

5000|$|I was {{fortunate}} {{in many ways}} not least of which I was never wounded and only shot down once when, on 7 September, my Spitfire was hit in combat with 109s. Having escaped the melée I managed to nurse my damaged aircraft back over the Channel, applying throttle intermittently {{so as not to}} overheat the engine, gradually losing height in the process as I neared the coast. I eventually managed to force-land in a ploughed field adjacent to a hop-garden. On climbing out of my aircraft I slid the canopy shut and turned to look for the nearest road. <b>I</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>a</b> couple having a picnic in the gateway to the field, their Austin Ruby saloon parked close-by. As I approached I was joined by a sergeant-pilot who had landed by parachute in a nearby orchard. The couple offered us a cup of tea and then a lift, not back to my aerodrome but to the nearest pub. What a contrast to the aerial combat in which we had been fighting for our lives just a short time before! ...|$|E

One of my rockets must have entered the firebox as there was a terrific explosion and my radiator was punctured as I flew through the debris. I tried to nurse my aircraft back at low level but simply ran out of height. I force-landed about 2 miles inside the German lines and was taken prisoner. I was initially taken to a rear echelon platoon HQ and from there, ironically by train, to the interrogation centre at Oberursel, near Frankfurt. I was then taken to Stalag Luft I, Barth, on the Baltic Coast where I remained until May 1945 when I was repatriated as part of Operation Exodus.|$|E

40|$|On 8 May 1998 I {{observed}} a Red-throated Loon at Lake McConaughy in Keith County, Nebraska. I was scanning Arthur Bay when <b>I</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>a</b> small loon swimming with several Western Grebes. I immediately recognized the bird as a Red-throated Loon in basic plumage. I studied and photographed the bird from 2 : 25 to 3 : 13 p. m. The bird was slightly larger and shorter-necked than a Western Grebe. The plumage was quite plain. The throat, cheek, foreneck, and underparts were white. The forehead, crown, nape, mantle, and wings were dark gray {{with a few}} pale spots on the mantle. The bill was very short and thin and the lower mandible was angled upward, giving the bill an upturned appearance. The area surrounding the eye was white. The bird also held its head tilted slightly upward. The distinction between dark gray and white {{on the head and}} neck was less clearcut than on a Pacific Loon. I concluded that the bird was probably an adult in basic plumage because of the dark-backed appearance, although it is possible the bird was molting from first-basic to first-alternate plumage...|$|E

Inquiries revealed that his name was Ernesto, and that he lived alone with his grandmother. No one knew why he was in such poor condition, or why {{he had failed to}} thrive since about age six. I had Ernesto evaluated by local doctors, who believed he might be suffering from muscular dystrophy. There was nothing they could do for him, and they sent him home. I brought Ernesto’s case to the attention of some fellow Peace Corps volunteers and local Filipinos. One volunteer suggested I try to find materials to build Ernesto a wheelchair and make some adjustments to his nipa hut to improve his maneuverability. Another recommended that I interview everyone who knew Ernesto (to get a more complete bio-psychosocial history), and then research treatments for muscular dystrophy.

I was struck by the senselessness of a tiny bird falling victim to our built environment. After a few minutes, the bird opened its eyes. Ten minutes later it was able to perch on my index finger. After half an hour it was actively looking around. It gave me a final look, then zoomed up to perch in the top of the tree. The bird was gone, but it seemed to have left me with a message, and perhaps a calling. At once fragile and resilient, this little being had stirred within me a desire to help birds thrive in a world increasingly dominated by buildings, pavement, billboards, and the material trappings of our everyday life.
