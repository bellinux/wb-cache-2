40|$|Objective The {{importance}} of implementation strategy in systems improvement is increasingly recognized and both ‘bottom-up’ and ‘top-down’ approaches have significant barriers. A {{trial of a}} combined approach involving frontline and managerial staff therefore seems merited. We attempted to improve handover using a Human Factors-based approach integrated with a combined ‘top and bottom’ implementation strategy. Design A before–after study was conducted across 9 months. Setting The study was set in a 236 bed district general hospital. Participants Participants included any member of staff involved in Out of Hours handover. Intervention Existing processes were analysed using Human Factors methods. Changes made were based on this analysis and developed via facilitation between management and frontline staff. These included creating a single multidisciplinary handover, changing the venue, standardizing the meeting structure, developing an standard operating procedure for identifying unwell patients for handover and creating a clinical coordinator role. Main outcome measures Meeting attendance, duration, start time efficiency, the type of patients handed over and the transfer of important information were measured pre- and post-intervention. Results We found improvement in <b>handover</b> <b>start</b> time (P = 0. 002, r = 0) and multidisciplinary participation (P = 0. 002, r = − 0. 534). Handover of unwell patients improved, but not significantly. Communication of plan (P Conclusions The changes produced greater multidisciplinary participation, a broader focus and improved communication of plans and tasks outstanding. The ‘top and bottom’ implementation approach appeared valuable. Management involvement was essential for significant changes, while frontline staff involvement facilitated the design of context-specific practical solutions with staff buy-in. </p...|$|E

40|$|IEEE 802. 11 based mobile {{communication}} towers is used {{very much in}} many personal and industrial purposes as it provides a continuous connectivity to Mobile Nodes (MNs) and allows them to change their attachment point from old Access Point (A) P to new AP while needed. But one main problem of continuous connectivity is handover latency which consists of scanning, authentication and re-association phases. Scanning is the most time consuming part of handover process. In this paper, we introduce a prescanning mechanism using Global Positioning System (GPS) to reduce handover delay. In our method, scanning is completed almost before actual <b>handover</b> <b>starts.</b> From the simulation results, {{it can be seen}} that our proposed mechanism reduces handover delay by a great deal...|$|R

Moreover, due to the disruptive effect this scanning latency represents in the global performance indicator. Another reason to assess this value is that the RMPA handover policy makes use of these two values for properly scheduling the handover process and the triggers involved.|$|R

30|$|This {{handover}} {{occurs when}} the SS node leaves a cluster situation and starts direct communication with the BS. Similar to a CHR–CHR handover, this will likely be abrupt, giving the node no {{time to prepare for}} the handover. Much like a CHR–CHR <b>handover,</b> the node <b>starts</b> by establishing a connection with the BS node across the WiMAX interface using the network entry process described in Section 6.3. 9 of the IEEE 802.16 specification. Similar to the CHR–CHR handover, the SS node supplies a “serving BSID” value in its RNG REQ. This allows the BS node to carry over the session and continue any established sessions uninterrupted.|$|R

When he returned to Europe in 1883, Robert Stubbs Archer was considered competent to manage Gracemere alone. He married Alice Manon (Daisy) Marwedel in 1889 and they began a family at the homestead.|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{we present}} {{a study of the}} {{existing}} Layer 3 mobility approaches towards suitability for low blackout times during <b>handovers.</b> Our <b>starting</b> point is the well-known Mobile IP protocol specified by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). Although the protocol supports mobility of mobile computers and hand-held devices in the Internet, it performs poorly when handovers happen while a communication session is active. Enhancements, such as Fast Mobile IP (FMIP) and Hierarchical Mobile IP (HMIP) have been proposed to handle the drawbacks of Mobile IP. We describe these protocols and discuss other extensions to Mobile IP devised by IETF, as well as non-standardized schemes proposed by other research groups. The selection of extensions is focussed on approaches aiming small Layer 3 blackout times applicable for inter-domain and vertical handovers during ongoing communication sessions. The discussed Layer 3 approaches have been considered in previous work extensively before by means of simulations, analysis, and measurements. Since the scenarios of previous work vary greatly, a comparison of the Layer 3 protocols is hardly possible. Therefore, we compare the blackout times of different schemes analytically for one definition of the blackout time and by four specific scenarios...|$|R
40|$|Current {{mobility}} {{models for}} simultaneous mobility have their convolution in designing simultaneous movement where mobile nodes (MNs) travel randomly {{from the two}} adjacent cells {{at the same time}} and also have their complexity in the measurement of the occurrences of simultaneous handover. Simultaneous mobility problem incurs when two of the MNs <b>start</b> <b>handover</b> approximately at the same time. As Simultaneous mobility is different for the other mobility pattern, generally occurs less number of times in real time; we analyze that a simplified simultaneous mobility model can be considered by taking only symmetric positions of MNs with random steps. In addition to that, we simulated the model using mSCTP and compare the simulation results in different scenarios with customized cell ranges. The analytical results shows that with the bigger the cell sizes, simultaneous handover with random steps occurrences become lees and for the sequential mobility (where initial positions of MNs is predetermined) with random steps, simultaneous handover is more frequent...|$|R
30|$|At this point, the MMT {{has enough}} {{information}} about the surrounding networks {{to decide on the}} network to which it will hand over. Once the MMT has decided the target network to hand over, it delivers a handover commit command to the MIHF (message 7 – 10), which will be used for resource reservation in the target network before switching from the serving network to the target network (L 2 and L 3 handover). After completion of resource reservation in the target network, the MMT starts to establish the connection in the target network. Once the connection is established, a higher-layer <b>handover</b> procedure can <b>start.</b> In this case Mobile IP has been selected, although any other mobility management protocol would be equally suited. When the handover is completed at the higher layers, the MMT sends an MIH_HO_Complete message to the MIHF, which will inform the target PoS that it is now the new serving PoS. At this point the target PoS informs all the involved network elements of the handover finalization (message 11 – 14). Specifically, the target PoS has to inform the serving PoS of the handover completion so that it can release any resources.|$|R
40|$|Urban social {{movements}} {{become one of}} the major forms of participation of urban governance of the public in recent years. Social values changed dramatically after the <b>handover</b> that people <b>started</b> to concern their right to the city. They demand for more power and influence in the formulation of urban policies and development strategy. However, urban governance in Hong Kong did not change with the time and resisted changes. This thus widened the gap of urban meaning between the formal government and the public. The conflict of their urban meanings thus led to urban social movement which aim to transform the urban governance. This also reinforce by the presence of new media in the mobilization of the movement. This dissertation aims to investigate how the changes of social values affect the conflict of urban meaning between urban actors and the impact on the urban governance in Hong Kong through analysing the framing of activists and urban managers. Choi Yuen Village Incident is chosen as case study to examine how different urban actors frame the issue and the implied urban meaning in the framing.

40|$|Shift {{handover}} among nurses {{takes place}} {{in order to keep}} continuity of nursing care. Nurses work in shifts to provide continuous nursing care for patients. The working shifts should overlap so that the nurses could get enough time to do the <b>handover.</b> Every shift <b>starts</b> with providing information concerning the patients. The target of this handover is to provide the most detailed information about each patient so that the nursing procedure is not interrupted. During this handover a nurse transmits information concerning the state of each patient at the department to the following shift. It is carried out in the oral as well as written form. Three goals were set in the practical part of this bachelor thesis. Goal 1 : To trace the most frequent form of the shift handover among nurses. Goal 2 : To learn how much the nurses are satisfied during the handover with the obtained information concerning patients. Goal 3 : To detect how the obtained pieces of information were applied in the nursing procedure. All three goals were met. The quantitative research method of questioning was applied to meet the goals of this bachelor thesis. It was carried out by questionnaires and observation. The questionnaire was given to the nurses in standard departments of the University Hospital Hradec Králové and the Hospital České Budějovice, a. s. Graphs and tables were used to evaluate the research part. Three hypotheses were set. Hypothesis 1 : Most frequently the nurses use the form of a dialogue during the shift handover.

Hypothesis 3 : The nurses apply the obtained information during the shift handover in the nursing procedure. All three hypotheses were proved according to this investigation...|$|R
40|$|The {{resumption}} of sovereignty over Hong Kong by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) was {{unique in the}} decolonization history of the United Kingdom. For {{the first time a}} piece of British colony was returned to another sovereign power without becoming an independent country. For the PRC, the {{resumption of}} sovereignty was a natural course of event because China had never admitted that Hong Kong was a colony of the United Kingdom. After initial contacts between Britain and China in the late 1970 s, Chinese government decided to take back Hong Kong in 1981. In 1982, the fourth constitution since the founding of the PRC promulgated the notion of Special Administrative Region. The principle of “one country, two systems” was devised to solve the issue of sovereignty of Hong Kong in 1997. In recovering Hong Kong, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) encountered a dilemma: on the one hand, it would like to resume sovereignty over Hong Kong; on the other hand, it would like {{to maintain the status quo}} as to preserve prosperity and stability of Hong Kong. Hopefully, the “one country, two systems” could solve the problem. Now fours years after the handover, people would ask the question whether the notion of “one country, two systems” has been successfully implemented. In fact, one could even ask; what is actually the principle of “one country，two systems”? Where is the line between “one country” and “two systems”? The paper attempts to answer these questions by exploring six cases that occurred after the <b>handover.</b> The paper <b>starts</b> with a general discussion on the concept, followed by a delineation of six cases and the implications of these cases for “one country, two systems” would be drawn. In fact, some scholars argued that under “one country, two systems” Hong Kong enjoys a higher degree of autonomy than the local/regional governments under Western federal systems. The paper tries to answer the question by referring to Australian and American federal systems...|$|R
40|$|Many {{public sector}} {{construction}} {{projects in the}} Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) are marred by communication and coordination problems, with owners having to pay {{a high price for}} schedule delays and cost overruns. The process by which building information is conveyed to owners lacks standardisation, a holistic approach, and consistency. This often results in KSA public sector owners receiving building information in a variety of formats, resulting in buildings operating at sub-optimal levels and relevant building data being unavailable at required times to support decision-making and optimal operations and maintenance. Existing systems of data management within KSA public sector projects cannot match the demand of operations and maintenance, as buildings are becoming more complex, in terms of space management, energy demand management, and addressing environmental concerns, due to the functional requirements of modern infrastructure. This research focuses on investigating key technology and processrelated challenges in order to ensure smoother transition of information from project design and construction to maintenance and operation phases of a building’s lifecycle. This research aims to develop a framework to enhance data management in building handover practices of public sector construction projects in the KSA. This framework helps improve the operation and maintenance of buildings by establishing a relationship between the project design and construction team, and the operations and project maintenance team. The research identifies key data requirements for effective building handover from a Saudi client perspective. In order to achieve the research aim, an empirically based systems analysis of a singledetailed case study organization of Al Madinah Al Munawwarah, Regional Municipality in KSA was carried out. Substantial fieldwork was undertaken using both qualitative and quantitative methods to match specific research questions. The questionnaire survey provides a wider view of building handover practices in the KSA, while the qualitative study provided an in-depth understanding of the state-of-the-art in practice. Many tools were used to collect the data, including semi-structured interviews supplemented by survey questionnaires together with documentation review. The implementation of more than one method to collect the data was used in order to achieve data triangulation, to explore implementation of data management in building handover practices, and to provide a more an in-depth understanding. The finding of this research concludes some unique factors that affect the implementation of actual building handover practices within the public sector construction industry in KSA. These factors include: high manager turnover; lack of knowledge and experience; lack of use of technology; lack of training; lack of communication during project data at the Handover Stage; unclear responsibilities. However, the finding indicates that it is important for all managers in public sector construction to understand that the <b>handover</b> is <b>started</b> already {{at the beginning of the}} project. Furthermore, early handovers must be reviewed and strengthened during the final project handover. Also, the research findings confirmed that the lack of communication was possibly because of the fact that the project team is big and multi-cultural. Thus, the individuals were afraid to ask any questions as they assumed others would think that they were too inexperienced to understand some technical specifications. Hence, it is highly critical to define and use a clear communication procedure. Every manager is responsible for communicating internally and externally about status and issues. These findings will strengthen the existing literature on effective data handover at project completion stage and will narrow the gap in knowledge in KSA studies in particular and to Arab studies in general. Therefore, significant recommendations to the policy, practitioners, and researchers, within both the public and private sector projects, are made to aid and improve construction industry practices. This research provides specific original findings, which include an in depth understanding of factors that affect the facilitation of data management in building handover practices of construction projects in the KSA via a case study conducted within the KSA public sector construction context. This research is the first study in KSA regarding issues that affect data management in building handover practices of construction projects in the KSA. It is also the first academic study of the Al Madinah Al Munawwarah, Regional Municipality in KSA...|$|R
40|$|Handling {{mobility}} in {{wireless sensor networks}} {{can pose}} formidable challenges in protocol design, especially, at the link layer. Since most of the proposed Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols do not accommodate mobility, a node has two options {{to deal with a}} deteriorating link: (a) to continue data transmission until the link breaks and then establishes a new link with a new relay node; or (b) to seamlessly transfer the communication to a better link parallel to the data transmission over the existing link. Different from option (a) where a node can only search for a new link after the original link disrupts, option (b) enables a node to perceive the change in the quality of a link in advance. The link quality prediction is implemented by an adaptive handover mechanism. Both approaches will inevitably introduce latency. This thesis aims to quantify and compare such latency. Specifically, it investigates the latency of packet transmission in a mobile wireless sensor network with and without the support of a <b>handover</b> mechanism. To <b>start</b> with, the thesis elaborates the effect of mobility on the performance of the existing MAC protocols, and the need to maintain an unbroken link during data transmission. To implement the handover, a target MAC protocol is required to be selected first. Since the Receiver-Initiated MAC protocol (RI-MAC) uses only short beacon and data packets during communication that substantially reduce overhearing, collision probability and data recovery cost, it is chosen as the carrier for the latency evaluation. Even though RI-MAC performs well in many aspects, it has several demerits. To address the monotonous increment in the backoff window size and to reduce the occurrence frequency of the dwell time, a burst data transmission pattern is adopted to optimize RI-MAC. With the optimization, the protocol reduces the long idle listening time that a node has to wait before data transmission, and thus, works well in a static scenario. However, due to the high probability of link disconnection, the burst data transmission does not perform well in case of mobility. For the sake of accommodating mobility, an adaptive handover mechanism is developed on top of the optimized RI-MAC. Once a node evaluates that the data packets cannot be completely transmitted before the link terminates, it will search for a new relay node while keeping communicating with the original collaborator. It is implemented by embedding a neighbor discovery request in a data packet that will be transmitted in a broadcast channel. Neighbors of the node will participate in the handover process {{as long as they are}} in an active state and their distance to the transmitter does not exceed a pre-defined threshold. As a proof-of-concept for the handover mechanism, a mathematical model is established. The transmission rate, the moving speed of human beings, the duty cycle and the network density are all taken into consideration. The analytical result shows that the communication latency decreases with an increment in the network density and the duty cycle when the handover mechanism is used, whereas the latency exhibits a reverse trend when the handover mechanism is not used. To validate the mathematics-based evaluation, the NS 2 network simulator is employed. The simulation result is found to perform in accordance with the analytical result. It is asserted that the latency of packet transmission with the handover support is much less than that without the handover support. The communication latency can be saved by at least 0. 28 s when the handover mechanism is applied. This figure can even grow as the duty cycle and the network density increase. From this perspective, the handover mechanism is verified to improve the latency of packet transmission as far as mobility is concerned...|$|R
