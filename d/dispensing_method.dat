40|$|In {{this paper}} a moldless stack <b>{{dispensing}}</b> <b>method</b> {{to form an}} LED lens at the wafer level is presented. This method uses a dispensing process to form a lens with high H/L ratio, where H and L stand for the height and the base length of the lens. Silicon wafer is used as the substrate. V-groove trenches are made {{on the surface of}} the wafer to define the size of the substrates. In the dispensing process a droplet of encapsulant is dispensed on the substrate to form a base heap. After the base heap is cured, a second droplet of encapsulant is dispensed on top of the base heap and cured. The stacked encapsulant forms a lens with high H/L ratio. Dispensing on substrates sized from 3 mm × 3 mm to 5 mm × 5 mm is investigated. For each size of substrate, experiments are performed to obtain the maximum volume of the encapsulant without overflowing (the critical volume) for both the base heap and the stacked layer. The results show that despite size differences, substrates of different sizes have a similar critical volume for both the base heap and the stacked layer. The ratio of critical volume of base heap to stacked layer remains at around 1 / 1. Consequently, the highest H/L values of substrates with different sizes stay at around 0. 33. Both critical k and H/L show no obvious correlation to the size of substrate. © 2014 JIEP...|$|E
40|$|Selected {{pairs of}} chemically-dissimilar {{polymers}} exhibit LCST behaviour. Thus they are miscible {{at room temperature}} and undergo phase separation upon raising the temperature. It is obvious that films composed of these mixtures {{can be used to}} tailor surface properties with change of temperature. One very well known example we concentrated in is a blend composed of polystyrene (PS) and poly(vinyl methyl ether) (PVME) [1]. To investigate changes in surface properties with temperature, the polymer blend was chemically immobilized on a MCS substrate using a surface active, silanated benzophenone linker, which is sensitive to UV-radiation. Polymer solutions in toluene were drop-cast on the MCS by an inkjet <b>dispensing</b> <b>method.</b> After UV radiation at 365 nm polymer residuals not bound to the surface were rinsed off with soxhlet extraction technique. For the investigation of the polymer film morphologies grazing incidence small angle x-ray scattering (µGISAXS) is performed at the beamline BW 4 [2]. For the experiments a micro-focussed beamsize of (HxV) 32 x 17 µm 2 is used. The footprint of this beam is able to match the size of one single MCS in the array. The sample was placed in a self made heating stage and measurements were performed at room temperature and 150 °C under a constant N 2 purge. Synchrotron radiation with a wavelength of 1. 38 Å and an incident angle on the sample surface of 0. 74 ° are used for the measurements. The sample-detector distance for µGISAXS is adjusted to 2 m.

40|$|Today's piezo-based {{micromanipulator}} technology {{allows for}} highly precise manipulation of optical components. A crucial {{question for the}} quality of optical assemblies is the misalignment after curing. The challenge of statistical deviations in the curing process requires a sophisticated knowledge on the relevant process parameters. An approach to meet these requirements is the empirical analysis such as characterization of shrinkage. Gaining sophisticated knowledge about the statistical process of adhesive bonding advances the quality of related production steps like beam-shaping optics, mounting of turning mirrors for fiber coupling or building resonators evaluating power, mode characteristics and beam shape. Maximizing the precision of these single assembly steps fosters the scope of improving the overall efficiency of the entire laser system. At Fraunhofer IPT research activities on the identification of relevant parameters for improved adhesive bonding precision have been undertaken and are ongoing. The influence of the volumetric repeatability of different automatic and manual <b>dispensing</b> <b>methods</b> play an important role. Also, the evaluation of UV-light sources and the relating illumination properties have a significant influence on the bonding result. Furthermore, common UV-curing adhesives are being examined on their performance and reliability for both highest precision prototyping, as well as their application as robust bonding medium in automated optics assembly cells. This paper sums up the parameters of most influence.

40|$|Looking {{inside the}} lungs without {{the danger of}} {{ionizing}} radiation side effects became available with magnetic resonance imaging using hyperpolarised noble gases. This technique {{has the potential to}} become a real tool for assessing in vivo ventilation, perfusion and even lung microstructure. The work covered in this research was aimed to improve the existing method for 3 He polarisation and open the possibility to develop new modalities to probe the lung microstructure that could then be used in clinical trials. For this purpose, the polarisation facility was remodeled and new components were added. The rest of the work was focused on developing diffusion techniques that are more appropriate for the assessment of lung diseases. The improvement of the 3 He polarisation facility consisted in the optimization of the gas flow path, implementation of a new <b>dispensing</b> <b>method</b> and new controlling protocol. The capacity of the polarisation system was increased by using a more powerful laser. The outcome of this was an increase in polarisation rate and a significant reduction of the dispensing time. Altogether this allow for clinical studies to be performed without too much delay. A clinical study aimed to distinguish differences between children born at term and premature was started on 70 volunteers. Three methods for measuring diffusion were used : spin echo diffusion weighted method, SPAMM tagging and MR diffusion spectroscopy. The first was previously used in the group and the last two were developed during this research. The results were correlated with basic pulmonary functional tests(spirometry and plethysmography) and also with the multiple breaths nitrogen wash-out results. No differences were found in the two groups. The results don’t agree with the current theories on lung growth and suggest that alveolarisation occurs even after the age of 8, possibly up to adult age. This is very important to be investigated further due to its clinical importance. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Narcotic drug {{dependency}} {{rehabilitation programs}} aim {{to break with}} the routines and habits relating to the acquisition and use of illicit drugs. Most narcotic dependency rehabilitation patients have to visit a pharmacy daily to obtain supervised doses of narcotic rehabilitation medication. The aim of rehabilitation programs is often to progress patients to take away doses (TADs). However, there are inherent risks associated with TADs {{due to lack of}} security of the medication and monitoring of its use. This thesis documents the design, development, and testing of a "Remote Medication Dispenser" device which can provide a secure home-based method of medication delivery for these patients, in particular, for those using TADs. Both clinical and functional requirements for the dispenser were considered in the consultation with an expert health professional in this field. To meet the requirements, a secure and hands-free medication intake method was developed in which the device dispenses medication directly to the patient's mouth - under the tongue. The device has a microcontroller to internally control its operation, with external control achieved through a computer-based user interface. The device has an enclosed housing, thus if there is forced access to medication, evidence will be prominent. Medication is loaded into the dispenser only by pharmacists. A "dosing supervisor" controls the dispensing operation through an internet connection; the medication is dispensed one by one and managed by the patient. Two prototypes of the dispenser were proposed and implemented. The first prototype is a multi-dose device which can contain and dispense up to four doses. It was developed to study and investigate the proposed storing and dispensing approach. The second prototype is a single-dose device that contains only one dose of medication. The design was developed based on the first prototype with simplification to make it more mobile and reliable. Moreover, the second prototype has a remote control feature, which allows control via an internet connection. Both devices dispense the same type of medication and apply the same storing and <b>dispensing</b> <b>method.</b> The operation of the dispensers was assessed with lab-based trials. They both operated as expected and met the design's specifications except for unreliability of the multi-dose dispenser, which was related to its complexity. A patient trial was proposed using the second (single-dose) prototype with the remote control function. An Ethics Approval was granted in order to carry out the experiment. A questionnaire, which concentrates on the design and its operation, was developed to obtain feedback from patients when they use the device. The trials will be conducted subsequent to the submission of this thesis. In conclusion, the concept of a remote medication dispenser was successful in terms of design and lab based assessment of the developed prototypes. The design has potential to be applied in research and development, and in clinical settings, particularly in narcotic rehabilitation programs...|$|E

30|$|The {{prior use}} of {{electronic}} prescribing at Hospital A for 8  years {{meant that the}} integrated medicines management processes were well established. The delivery of products to the wards links in with these processes. Typically, most wards (30 out of 36) receive a medicines management service. Each ward can expect 0.75 WTE pharmacists, and 0.5 WTE technician time per week. Changes in skill-mix in out-patient department equates to an additional saving on top of staff reduction of 16 %. Data from the control chart suggest de-skilling the dispensary workforce using robots has no impact on dispensing errors. Towards the end of 2009, {{there was an increase}} in dispensing errors, which was in part due to the consequences of the installation programme. This is where control charts proved useful to monitor the processes, especially when dealing with small numbers. A previous paper (Beard and Candlish, 2004) listed the different types of <b>dispensing</b> <b>methods</b> at Hospital A, and the error rates associated with them. Figure  2 shows a spike in errors just after installation. Error analysis showed them to be non-robot errors, i.e. they were picking errors from those shelves of the pharmacy where items cannot go into robots (part packs, round tubs of medicines, or items too small to be labelled by robot). Significantly, we have found zero errors for the robot plus electronic prescribing system combined, based on around 800, 000 items per annum. This represents a huge benefit in safety. However, dispensing is not risk-free, since not all items are supplied and labelled from the robot. However, the opportunity for errors is significantly reduced.|$|R

Analyses compared all individuals attending pre and post citrate and matched analyses only those individuals attending in both periods (defined as 'longitudinal attenders'). Non-parametric tests were used throughout. Results Neither new (first seen in either six months period) nor established clients visited SEPs more frequently post citrate. New clients collected significantly less syringes per visit post citrate, than pre citrate (14. 5, 10. 0; z = 1. 992, P Conclusion The introduction of citrate did not negatively affect SEP attendance. 'Longitudinal attenders' visited SEPs more frequently post citrate, providing staff with greater opportunity for intervention and referral. As the number of syringes they collected each visit remained unchanged the total number of clean syringes made available to this group of injectors increased very slightly between the pre and post citrate periods. However, new clients collected significantly less syringes post citrate than pre citrate, possibly due to staff concerns regarding the amount of citrate (and thus syringes) to dispense safely to new clients. These concerns {{should not be allowed to}} negatively impact on the number of syringes dispensed. </p...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} 25 years, {{microsystem}} technology has developed {{to become a}} key technology of {{the first part of}} the 21 st century. With a world market share of approximately 25 billion US dollars forecast for the year 2009 and an anticipated annual rate of increase of 16 %, microsystem technology is one of the world's largest growth markets. The main growth drivers of this development are the industries of IT periphery, bio-medical technology, automotive technology, household and telecommunications. The strong growth and mounting competition in the field of microsystem technology are gradually stepping up the pressure on companies to manufacture cheaper products under constantly rising quality requirements. The decisive factor in this instance is microsystem assembly: according to surveys, up to 80 % of microsystem manufacturing costs are incurred by assembly. At the same time, assembly processes significantly influence the achievable levels of product quality and reliability. A core process in the fabrication of substance-to-substance connections in microassembly is bonding. It is often not possible to join microcomponents using other techniques such as welding or soldering. However, the use of adhesives to create substance-to-substance bonds is becoming more and more difficult due to ever-smaller component dimensions. The associated over-proportional reduction in size frequently results in the inability to ensure adequate levels of reproducibility and accuracy when applying continuous or discontinuous lines or dots of adhesive. Based on the current state of the art of adhesive application processes, by analyzing market data it was possible to identify the dispensing process as the most significant process for applying adhesives. On considering the varying dispensing processes that exist, the time-pressure method showed to be the most important dispensing technique. However, the dosing process of the time-pressure <b>dispensing</b> <b>method</b> does not enable the amounts of adhesive fed to be applied with a high degree of reproducibility and accuracy. This results in process scattering levels of approx. 10 %. The aim of this thesis was therefore to specify control laws to improve reproducibility and accuracy of time-pressure dispensing processes. An additional aim was to design and realize a tool and the necessary control software for process-controlled time-pressure dispensing. Firstly, using representative examples of hybrid microassembly application, it was possible to define the requirements of continuous and discontinuous time-pressure dosing. This resulted in maximum permitted process scattering levels of 2. 8 % for the continuous dispensing of lines of adhesives and 8. 3 % for the discontinuous dispensing of dots of adhesive. Based on this information, it was possible to identify problems associated with the process which could be solved within the scope of this thesis. This involved defining a complete mathematical model of the time-pressure dosing process which took into account not only the changes in temperature occurring in the dosing system but also the non-linear flow behavior of the adhesive. This also included the development of a working point control unit to regulate the continuous dosing of adhesive and a output control unit to regulate the discontinuous dosing of adhesive. The problems associated with forming the mathematical model were solved in two ways; first of all, a differential equation system was derived to calculate the transient temperature of the air in the syringe. Secondly, a differential equation was derived to characterize the transient, non-linear flow behavior of the adhesive in the dispensing capillary. Using the complete process model, a working point control unit was subsequently developed to regulate the continuous dosing of adhesive. To regulate the discontinuous dosing of adhesive, a reproducible output control unit was developed to resolve deficits regarding reproducibility and accuracy. In order to implement the control units realized, alternative solution approaches were developed to enable the targeted, continuous influence on the time-pressure dosing process and to record the required values of pressure and volume flow. The most suitable solutions were then determined. The newly-realized process control units as well as the solutions developed for monitoring and steering the processes were verified by carrying out experimental tests using the highly-viscous oil type “SHC 639 ” as a replacement medium. The tests demonstrated that the control units developed were capable of fulfilling requirements and showed that the reproducibility of dispensing results could be significantly increased both for continuous and discontinuous dosing processes. The developments made enabled variations in reproducibility to be reduced to less than 0. 5 % with an improved degree of accuracy of over 5 %, thus fulfilling the requirements placed on the continuous and discontinuous application of adhesive using time-pressure dispensing processes. Furthermore, these developments also enabled the reproducible dosing spectrum attainable with controlled time-pressure processes to be extended by 23 ml/h for continuous dispensing and 160 nl for discontinuous dispensing. When the techniques were finally implemented in a controlled time-pressure dispensing tool, it was possible to prove the technical feasibility of the process-controlled dosing of highly-viscous adhesives in an example using the type of adhesive "PD 955 ". If the control, dispensing tool and the volumetric flow sensor are further developed, it is conceivable that the technique developed could be implemented in industrial applications requiring the reproducible dispensing of tiny volumes of highly-viscous adhesive. The main focus of interest should be on increasing the load capacity of the flow sensor membrane in order to enable higher working pressures and thus reduce dispensing times. Another interesting aspect would be to carry out further investigations using the above-mentioned process control units with the aim of reducing minimum dispensing flow rates and volumes achievable with time-pressure dispensing systems. In addition to this, it would also make sense to transfer these results to other dispensing or dosing techniques, as well as to extend controlled dosing processes to controlled dispensing processes which also possess a feedback control of the adhesive application technique...|$|E
40|$|Infectious {{diseases}} {{are the leading}} causes of death around the world. Point-of-care devices using nucleic acid amplification are sensitive enough to diagnose these diseases, however, often require complex and time-intensive sample preparation steps that are not integrated with the detection process. A rapid, sensitive, and integrated sample-to-result diagnostic device will permit disease treatment planning at the point-of-care. Paper-based detection assays are a promising platform to integrate the sample preparation and detection, with minimal infrastructure, equipment, and user involvement. To integrate sample preparation with detection on paper-based assays, timing and delivery of sample fluid flow needs to be controlled. Here we use thermally responsive materials (e. g. wax) to create a micro valve on a nitrocellulose membrane in order to automate fluid flow and minimize user involvement. The ease-of-fabrication, lot-to-lot variability and consistency of the <b>dispensing</b> <b>methods</b> are compared. After multiple trials, dispensing the wax material, PureTemp 68 X, using a stamp made of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is able to direct the sample flow with the highest consistency. Thermally responsive valves fabricated by stamping PureTemp 68 X are found to block the sample fluid to flow for a sustained time when cool. When heated above the melting temperature (68 °C), the valve opens and allows fluid flow without interfering with downstream assay binding reactions. These valves can be actuated multiple times simply by heating and cooling again. As a proof of concept, we use the valve to control sample delivery time of nucleic acid amplicons in a lateral flow immunoassay. Amplicons dispensed onto {{one side of the}} assay are incubated and bind to gold nanoparticles. They are then released through the valve by applying heat to open the valve. Nanoparticle nucleic acid amplicons will bind to recognition antibodies at {{the far side of the}} valve and become visible bands for detection...|$|R

With the forthcoming development of more advanced microfluidic systems, the integration of actuating elements becomes essential, giving the ability to control and manipulate fluid flow as well as sample or other components. This thesis addresses miniaturisation of piezoceramic actuators, in particular important technological issues when actuators are integrated in microfluidic systems. Thick film multilayer fabrication technology for piezo­ceramics has been further developed, e. g. by introducing techniques for integration of microfabricated channel structures and via interconnects in multilayer components. New building techniques have been incorporated to allow miniaturisation of devices. A rapid prototyping technique for advanced multilayer actuators based on mechanical machining has also been developed and used in subsequent work. When interfacing the macro and the micro world in miniaturised chemical analysis systems, non-contact sample <b>dispensing</b> <b>methods</b> such as ink-jet technology are needed. Thus a piezoactuated flow-through microdispenser, suitable for high-speed on-line chemical sample handling has been investigated. A new miniaturised actuator has been developed and integrated in the microdispenser, simplifying assembly and demonstrating an improved performance of the device. With the prospect of performing automated and highly parallel analysis in reusable microarray devices, a new concept for dynamic arraying is presented. Non-contact trapping of particle or bead clusters in a microfluidic system is demonstrated utilising acoustic radiation forces in standing ultrasonic waves. The integration of piezoceramic micro­transducers has been shown to render possible localised and spatially controlled trapping of individually addressable particle clusters in micro­fluidics. The importance of the acoustic near field in miniaturised devices has been identified and utilised to give strong trapping forces. By making use of disposable chemically activated microbead arrays within a flow-through device, a flexible system is emerging with e. g. applications in proteomics...|$|R
40|$|Dispensed {{organic polymer}} optical waveguides {{suitable}} for single-mode operation were recently fabricated. Different dispensing pressures, polymers, and dispensing tips {{were used in}} the drawing method. The waveguides were measured to be approximately 16 [mu] wide and 0. 8 [mu] tall. This is significantly smaller than previously reported dimensions of 300 [mu] x 3. 5 [mu] waveguides fabricated with a similar <b>dispensed</b> polymer <b>method.</b> The waveguides were also found to be suitable for single-mode operation through a series of approximate calculations. This is also something previously not achieved with the larger waveguides. This novel approach to waveguide fabrication could reduce the expense and time of creating single mode waveguides for rapid development applications. It will also allow the waveguides to be fabricated to be flexible as well as doped to be active devices...|$|R

50|$|Cask beer is the {{traditional}} method of service, via a hand pump or by gravity straight from the cask on stillage. Cask conditioned beer is unfiltered, unpasteurized and lacking artificial carbonation (the bubbles are produced by the ongoing fermentation), giving it a limited shelf-life. This <b>dispense</b> <b>method</b> is strongly associated with ale, {{although there is no}} technical barrier to serving lager or stout this way. Most pubs use hand pumps ("beer engines") to draw the beer, whereas stillages are commonly employed at beer festivals. Cask ale and bottle conditioned beer are championed by the Campaign for Real Ale under the name real ale. Prior to stainless steel casks, beer was delivered in large wooden barrels, which were delivered to the cellar via a trap-door on the footpath using two ropes wound about the barrels midriff (a parbuckle) to lower the barrel gently down the cellar's ramp. They then had to stand on their sides for a few days so the sediment would settle {{to the bottom of the}} belly of the barrel, after which they would be 'tapped' by punching the pre-cut centre of the (traditionally cork) bung (at the lower edge of the barrel end) into the barrel by hitting the tapered brass 'tap' with a mallet. One could then attach the pipe connector onto the tap, so that the cellarman could turn the tap on when ready. In a similar manner, one would punch through the centre of a bung on the upper side of the barrel's belly with a hardwood spile (tapered peg). The hardwood spile prevents air access. Once the barrel is in use, the spile is replaced with a 'soft' spile, traditionally made from softwood, but nowadays from bonded-together (woody) fibres. The soft spile prevents a vacuum forming at the upper surface of the beer: it allows sufficient air in for the beer engine to work, but keeps dust, flies and other mischief-makers out.|$|R
