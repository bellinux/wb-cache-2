5|$|After a brief {{postponement}} {{because of}} the death of her maternal uncle, Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, Victoria married Prince Louis on 30 April 1884 at Darmstadt. Her <b>father</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> approve of the match; in his view Prince Louis had little money and would deprive him of his daughter's company, as the couple would naturally live abroad in Britain. However, Victoria was of an independent mind and took little notice of her father's displeasure. Remarkably, that same evening, Victoria's father secretly married his mistress, Countess Alexandrine Hutten-Czapska, the former wife of Alexander von Kolemine, the Russian chargé d'affaires in Darmstadt. His marriage to a divorcee who was not of equal rank shocked the assembled royalty of Europe and through diplomatic and family pressure Victoria's father was forced to seek an annulment of his own marriage.|$|E
5|$|Andrew II betrothed Béla to {{an unnamed}} {{daughter}} of Tzar Boril of Bulgaria in 1213 or 1214, but their engagement was broken.

Logan tells Parker this news, and she is disappointed.|$|E

5|$|Champollion married Rosine Blanc (17941871) in 1818 {{after four}} years of engagement, they had one {{daughter}}, Zoraïde Chéronnet-Champollion (182489). Rosine was the daughter of a well-to-do family of Grenoblean glovemakers. At first her <b>father</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> approve of the match, since Champollion was a mere assistant professor when they first met, but with his increasing reputation he eventually agreed. Originally Jacques-Joseph did not approve of his brother's marriage either, finding Rosine too dull-witted, and he did not attend the wedding, but later he grew fond of his sister in-law. Although a happy family man, especially adoring his daughter, Champollion was frequently away from his family for months or even years at a time, while traveling to Paris, to Italy, and to Egypt. While in Livorno, Champollion developed an infatuation with an Italian poet, Angelica Palli. She presented an ode to Champollion's work at a celebration in his honor, and the two exchanged letters for a while, but an affair never developed.|$|E

Both Moreno and María were expected by their families to follow religious studies, and Moreno's <b>father</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> authorize a change.

5|$|Eberhardt {{was well}} educated; {{along with the}} other {{children}} in the family, she was home-schooled by Trophimowsky. She was fluent in French, spoke Russian, German and Italian, and was taught Latin, Greek, and classical Arabic. She studied philosophy, metaphysics, chemistry, history, and geography, though she was most passionate about literature, reading the works of authors including Pierre Loti, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Leo Tolstoy, Voltaire and Émile Zola while she was a teenager, and was also an admirer of the poets Semyon Nadson and Charles Baudelaire. At an early age she began wearing male clothing, enjoying its freedom, and her nonconformist <b>father</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> discourage her. The children of deMoerder resented their stepfather, who forbade them from obtaining professions or leaving the home, and effectively used them as slaves to tend to his extensive gardens. Eberhardt's sister Nathalie married against Trophimowsky's wishes in 1888, and was subsequently cut {{off from the rest of}} the household. Nathalie's departure had a profound effect on Eberhart's childhood, as she had been responsible for most of the home duties; the household subsequently suffered from a lack of hygiene and regular meals.|$|E
