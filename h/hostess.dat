40|$|<b>Hostesses</b> and {{restaurant}} {{employees in the}} Philippines were studied to determine whether an increased use of antibiotics {{was associated with a}} higher point prevalence of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli. Of 1, 030 <b>hostesses</b> and 628 restaurant employees, 28 and 4 %, respectively, said that they had taken antibiotics within a week of being cultured (P less than 0. 001). Of <b>hostesses</b> {{and restaurant}} employees, 10 % (103 of 1, 030) and 2 % (14 of 628), respectively, had antibiotics detectable in their urine (P less than 0. 001). Enterotoxigenic E. coli strains were isolated from 1. 2 % (12 of 1, 030) of <b>hostesses</b> and 1. 7 % (11 of 628) of restaurant employees. In both populations, enterotoxigenic E. coli strains were never found in subjects who had antibacterial activity in their urine. Although resistance to two or more antibiotics was found more frequently in E. coli isolated from <b>hostesses</b> than in that isolated from restaurant workers (48 versus 33 %; P less than 0. 01), antibiotic selective pressure did not increase the prevalence of enterotoxigenic E. coli in these two populations...|$|R
40|$|In 1967, {{the world}} came to Montreal with the International World Exhibition of 1967. The event served as host to over 50 million {{visitors}} and 62 participating nations. Expo 67 was a multimedia event, encompassing architecture, art, design, fashion and {{new technology to}} create a visually interesting world’s fair. Working at Expo were 250 young women who served as <b>hostesses</b> – welcoming, guiding, assisting, and informing guests. It is {{the aim of this}} thesis to examine the role that the <b>hostesses</b> performed within the larger cultural landscape at Expo 67. This thesis will conduct a critical comparative analysis of the hiring and training of the 1967 Expo <b>hostesses</b> with that of airline stewardesses in the 1960 ’s. This thesis will also examine the role that the hostesses’ uniforms played in their transition from pre-war women to modern, single women. To do so, a critical analysis of fashion trends and the designer uniforms worn by both <b>hostesses</b> and airline stewardesses will be used as a marker of their transition. The questions this thesis seeks to answer are: What role did the uniform play in the position that the Expo 67 <b>hostesses</b> performed? What were the similarities or differences in hiring and training procedures between airline stewardesses and Expo <b>hostesses?</b> In what ways did these hiring and training procedures influence the performance of the Expo <b>hostesses?</b> How did the uniforms both confine and free these women during a time of great change? How did the uniform and guidelines of Expo influence their behaviour...|$|R
