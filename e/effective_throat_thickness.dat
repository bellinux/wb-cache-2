40|$|An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) {{model has}} been applied to the {{prediction}} of key weld geometries produced using Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) with alternating shielding gases. This is a recently developed method of supplying shielding gases to the weld area in which the gases are discretely supplied at a given frequency. The model can be used to predict the penetration, leg length and <b>effective</b> <b>throat</b> <b>thickness</b> for a given set of weld parameters and alternating shielding gas frequency. A comparison between the experimental and predicted geometries matched closely and demonstrates the effectiveness of this software approach in predicting weld outputs. The model has shown that the application of alternating shielding gases increases the penetration and <b>effective</b> <b>throat</b> <b>thickness</b> of a fillet weld whilst the leg length is reduced. A sensitivity analysis was performed which showed that the travel speed is the most influential input parameter when predicting weld geometries, this is to be expected for any given welding set-up due to the influence of the travel speed on the heat input. The sensitivity analysis also showed that the shielding gas configuration had the lowest influence on the output of the model. The output from the model has demonstrated that the use of alternating shielding gases during GMAW results in a step change in the weld metal geometry. This suggests that, in the case of alternating shielding gases, an increased travel speed is required to produce a similar weld geometry to that of the conventional Ar/ 20 %CO 2 technique...|$|E
30|$|As can be {{seen from}} Fig.  6, the {{correlation}} between the movable fluid saturation and the effective pore radius is small, and the correlation coefficient is 0.4627, suggesting unevenly developed, poor pores (Fig.  6 a). Comparably, the movable fluid saturation is more correlated with the weighted average <b>effective</b> <b>throat</b> radius with the correlation coefficient of 0.7835 (Fig.  6 b). In the throats with radius less than 0.7  µm, movable fluid saturations are all below 50 %, while in the throats coarser than 0.7  µm, the movable fluid saturation obviously increases with the weighted average <b>effective</b> <b>throat</b> radius (except for samples 10 and 11). Therefore, it is safe to conclude that throat is the key factor that affects the occurrence characteristics of movable fluids.

30|$|The mercury {{intrusion}} experiments of 13 samples {{in the study}} area show that the effective pore distribution is uneven and the data points are scattered. The weighted average effective pore radius is mainly distributed between 110 and 192  μm. Generally, smaller pore radius corresponds to poorer reservoir capacity and less occurrence of movable fluids. As for the <b>effective</b> <b>throats,</b> they are fine and tiny, with the weighted average <b>effective</b> <b>throat</b> radius ranging from 0.159 to 0.975  μm. Thus, the weighted average <b>effective</b> pore and <b>throat</b> radius ratio is calculated to range between 174 and 628, with the large values indicating uneven pore–throat distribution and large pore and throat radius difference, which further suggest less effectively connected pores and throats. The sorting coefficient is in the range of 0.06 – 0.99, indicating good sorting and thus concentrated throat distribution (Table  3).|$|R
30|$|Based on {{the above}} results, {{it is found}} that the {{microscopic}} pore structure is an important factor affecting the occurrence characteristics of movable fluid saturation.

According {{to the constant}} pressure mercury intrusion experiments of 13 samples, {{it is found that}} there is a good positive correlation between movable fluid saturation and effective pore volume per unit of rocks, with the correlation coefficient of 0.6279 (Fig.  7 a), while there is a less positive correlation between movable fluid saturation and <b>effective</b> <b>throat</b> volume per unit of rocks, with the correlation coefficient of 0.3955 (Fig.  7 b). Fluids in Chang 81 reservoir in the Maling Oilfield mainly occur in the <b>effective</b> pores and <b>throats.</b> Those in the effective pores have stronger seepage capacity, and the movable fluid saturation is more correlated with pore space, while those in the throats suffer poor connectivity and strong bound resistance, making it difficult for fluid to flow.|$|R

Specifically, permeability is the main controlling factor with a correlation coefficient of 0.7467, and porosity also plays a role in determining the movable fluid saturation with a correlation coefficient of 0.2424. As for the influence of microscopic pore structure, <b>effective</b> pore and <b>throat</b> radii and pore–throat radius ratio are the primary controlling factors with respective correlation coefficients of 0.7835 and 0.6988, while effective pore radius, <b>effective</b> <b>throat</b> radius, and sorting coefficient also have obvious influence on the movable fluid saturation with respective correlation coefficients of 0.6279, 0.3955, and 0.6349. Meanwhile, clay mineral fillings, pore types and physical properties have relatively small impact. Different clay minerals have different influences on the movable fluid saturation due to their different occurrences, and more interstitials generally lead to poorer connectivity.|$|R

40|$|A {{microchannel}} separator, with 2. 7 millimeters as {{the smallest}} dimension, was tested, and a pore throat structure captured and removed liquid from a gas-liquid stream. The microchannel device was tested over a {{of gas and}} liquid flow rates ranging from 0. 0005 up to 0. 14 volume fraction of liquid. Four liquids were tested with air. The biggest factor affecting the throughput is the capacity of liquid flow through the pore throat, which is dictated by permeability, liquid viscosity, flow area, pore <b>throat</b> <b>thickness,</b> and pressure difference across the pore throat. Typically, complete separation of gas and liquid fractions was lost when the liquid flow rate reached about 40 to 60 % of the pore throat capacity. However, this could occur over a range of 10 to 90 % utilization of pore throat capacity. Breakthrough occurs in the microchannel phase separator at conditions similar to the annular to plug flow transition of two-phase microgravity pipe flow implying that operating in the proper flow regime is crucial.

The relative strong relationship between the permeability and oil displacement efficiency {{as well as the}} higher correlation coefficient between it and ultimate stage oil displacement efficiency indicates the stronger permeability of <b>effective</b> <b>throat</b> network, which contributes to the more seepage paths with wider range and larger sweeping area and finally larger ultimate stage oil displacement efficiency. The reservoir quality index, which is a function of permeability and porosity, is more strongly correlated with water-free and ultimate stage oil displacement efficiencies, with respective correlation coefficients of 0.6879 and 0.8829 (Fig.  9), which suggests that single physical parameter cannot faithfully reflect the seepage properties.

Although T-stubs {{have been used for}} many years to model the tension zone of bolted joints, the research was mainly concentrated on rolled profiles as T-stub elements. To extend this model to the case of welded plates as T-stub elements, a test programme was undertaken at the Delft University of Technology and is reported in this paper. It provides insight into the behaviour of this different type of assembly, in terms of resistance, stiffness, deformation capacity and failure modes, in particular. The key variables tested include the weld <b>throat</b> <b>thickness,</b> the size of the T-stub, the type and diameter of the bolts, the steel grade, the presence of transverse stiffeners and the T-stub orientation. The results show that the welding procedure is particularly important to ensure a ductile behaviour of the connection. Most of the T-stubs failed by tension fracture of the bolts after significant yielding of the flanges.

A particular value of the general expression of the local stress field parameter is taken into account, which the fatigue strength depends on. Then a simple model is proposed by the authors in order to estimate such a parameter, based on the calculation of a geometric (or structural) contribution to the local stress field, depending on the overall joint geometry, and a local contribution evaluated by considering a specimen with lateral V-notches characterised by the same weld toe profile and a depth proportional to the weld <b>throat</b> <b>thickness.</b> Doing so, the estimation of the fatigue strength of a welded joint {{can be reduced to}} the estimation of the fatigue strength of the equivalent V-notch subjected to a remote stress equal to the structural stress (that can be regarded as a ‘hot spot’ stress).

40|$|Purpose: ISO 5817 “Arc-welded joints in steel-Guidence {{on quality}} levels for imperfections” {{is a widely}} used {{international}} standard for evaluating of the weld imperfections in arc welded joints. In this study, {{in order to see}} the differences between the quality levels given in ISO 5817, the welded joints of B, C and D levels are subjected to the same load and the differences of maximum stresses at the joints are analysed by FEM. Design/methodology/approach: The welded joints with the quality levels of the weld imperfections given in ISO 5817 are modeled by a Solidworks FEM program, and they are subjected to static loading {{in order to determine the}} maximum stresses at the cross-sections of the joints. Findings: The stress values at the welded joints generally increases from the quality level of “B” to “D”. Exceptions of this behavior are the imperfections defined as “fillet welds having the <b>throat</b> <b>thickness</b> greater than nominal value”, “excessive penetration” and “excessive asymmetry fillet weld”. In these imperfections, the cross-sections carrying the force increases from “B” to “D”. Because of static force, a greater cross-section forms a smaller stress value. Thus, it must be given in the ISO 5817 whether the welded joint is subjected to a static or dynamic load. Research limitations/implications: Three dimensional models can be investigated and the effect of 3 D weld imperfections on the behavior of a more realistic model can be calculated. Practical implications: The results show that some imperfections like “excessive penetration” and “excessive asymmetry filet weld” have less importance compared to the others. Originality/value: ISO 5817 is a worldwide used Standard for evaluating the weld imperfections. The quality levels of weld imperfections are compared with each other with FEM. The Standard includes 57 different quality levels and this paper compared all these levels with each other...|$|R

The {{capacity of}} a high-strength steel I-beam made of S 960 QC was investigated in this study. The investigation included assessment of the service limits and ultimate limits of the steel beam. The thesis was done according to European standards for steel structures, Eurocode 3. An analytical method was used to determine the <b>throat</b> <b>thickness,</b> deformation, elastic and plastic moment capacities as well as the fatigue life of the beam. The results of the analytical method were compared with those obtained by Finite Element Analysis (FEA). Elastic moment capacity obtained by the analytical method was 172 kNm. FEA and the analytical method predicted the maximum lateral-torsional buckling (LTB) capacity in the range of 90 - 93 kNm and the probability of failure as a result of LTB is estimated to be 50 %. The lateral buckling capacity meant that the I-beam can carry a safe load of 300 kN instead of the initial load of 600 kN. The beam is liable to fail shortly after exceeding the elastic moment capacity. Based on results in of the different approaches, it was noted that FEA predicted higher deformation values on the load-deformation curve than the analytical results. However, both FEA and the analytical methods predicted identical results for nominal stress range and moment capacities. Fatigue life was estimated to be in the range of 53000 - 64000 cycles for bending stress range using crack propagation equation and strength-life approach. As Eurocode 3 is limited to steel grades up to S 690, results for S 960 must be verified with experimental data and appropriate design rules...|$|R

40|$|This project {{investigates the}} {{possibility}} to find measurable values based on the current and voltage characteristics of the GMAW, Gas Metal Arc Welding, process that may be correlated to process parameters and/or geometrical measurements of weld beads. Such quantites may {{have the potential to}} replace or complement existing subjective and qualitative charcterisation and validation methods of the welding process. Existing characterisation methods of the performance of welding consumables consist, at least partly, of an experienced welder/engineer that uses his/her experience to evaluate the welding process. Finding other more objective and quantitative measures that correlates to aspects of the welding process may enable more systematic and efficient methods of development and validation of welding consumbles. Also, a replacement of manual welding with automated welding may further contribute to the efficiency of the methods. This work will focus on two aspects during two experiments. The first experiment performed aimed on deriving possible quantitative measurables from the I/U characteristics from welds acquired with varying voltage and wire feed speed. An automated GMAW process were used. The I/U data was then analysed in a computer software to find possible characteristic measurables, which have the potential of correlating to the welding process. Examples of calculated characteristic quantities are; amount of short-circuiting, quantities from Fourier transformation analysis and deviation in current, voltage and power. A discussion are made about how these aspects of the I/U characteristic are linked to the process and different transfer modes. The I/U characteristics analysis revealed that some of the calculated characteristic quantities showed possible trends or indications of correlations to the weld process. The Fourier transformation showed a unexpected peak in the frequency span of 300 - 900 Hz, which could be of future interest but it needs further analysis to draw any conclusions. In the second experiment, a number fillet welds were made in order to demonstrate the effectiveness and stabillity of the automated setup. These welds are also made with varying wire feed speed and voltage with an automated GMAW process. Geometry measurements were performed on the weld bead profile, in terms of <b>throat</b> <b>thickness,</b> leg length, penetration, etc. The result from the geometrical measurements and their correlation with the input parameters are shown to be in good agreement with theory and the automated setup being promising as a standard method for consumable characterisation...|$|R

40|$|Nozzle {{guide vane}} (NGV) flow {{capacity}} {{is perhaps the}} most important parameter for engine optimization. Inaccurate evaluation of capacity would lead to incorrect performance evaluation, and unmatched stages. A new semi-transient technique has been developed and demonstrated that will allow turbine designers to measure experimentally the <b>effective</b> <b>throat</b> area of an annular cascade of nozzle guide vanes at engine-representative Mach number, Reynolds number, and mainstream-to-cooling-flow pressure ratio. The technique allows NGV capacity to be measured to bias and precision uncertainties to 95 % confidence of ± 0. 546 % and ± 0. 028 %, which compares well to large scale industrial facilities. Order-of-magnitude cost savings are offered over typical continuously running industrial facilities by running in blowdown mode from a receiver tank, thus removing the need for large scale compressor plant. To demonstrate the technique, a high mass flow rate blowdown tunnel was developed and commissioned at the University of Oxford, and the capacity of a high-pressure NGV from a large civil aircraft engine was experimentally determined. Experimental results are presented, which allow the precision error to be accurately calculated. A detailed uncertainty analysis is given from which the bias error is computed. It is shown that the low precision error the new technique offers means that it is ideally suited to investigations in which secondary influences on capacity are the subject of the investigation. The technique is of industrial significance because methods to compute engine capacity analytically or computationally do not yet provide sufficient accuracy for engine optimization, and the new technique offers equivalent accuracy at a much reduced cost over conventional experimental techniques. By performing an uncertainty analysis using experimental data it is shown that the increase in uncertainty due to the semi-transient (as opposed to steady state) nature of the technique is approximately 0. 004 % (to 95 % confidence), and is entirely negligible. The experimentally measured trend of capacity against pressure ratio is compared with simple 1 D, 2 D, and 3 D inviscid models, and an analytical correction for total pressure loss is performed. It is shown that while a simple 3 D model is better than a 1 D model (up to 1. 5 % improvement) for crude estimates of engine capacity, experimental trends are poorly predicted by such simple techniques. An analytical correction for total pressure loss increases the difference between 3 D prediction and experiment. The experimental data demonstrate the complex nature of the process by which nozzle capacity is determined and the need for accurate, low-cost experimental techniques for capacity measurement.

40|$|Due to {{functional}} requirement of a structural detail brackets {{with and without}} scallop are frequently used in bridges, decks, ships and offshore structure. Scallops are designed to serve as passage way for fluids, to reduce weld length and plate distortions. Moreover, scallops are used to avoid intersection {{of two or more}} welds for {{the fact that there is}} the presence of inventible inherent initial crack except for full penetrated weld and the formation of multi-axial stress state at the weld intersection. Welding all around the scallop corner increase the possibility of brittle fracture even for the case the bracket is not loaded by primary load. Avoiding of scallop will establish an initial crack in the corner if bracket is welded by fillet welds. If the two weld run pass had crossed, this would have given a 3 D residual stress situation. Therefore the presences and absence of scallop necessitates the 3 D FEA fatigue resistance of both types of brackets using effective notch stress approach (). FEMAP 10. 1 with NX NASTRAN was used for the 3 D FEA. The first and main objective of this research was to investigate and compare the fatigue resistance of brackets with and without scallop. The secondary goal was the fatigue design of scallops in case they cannot be avoided for some reason. The fatigue resistance for both types of brackets was determined based on approach using 1 mm fictitiously rounded radius based on IIW recommendation. Identical geometrical, boundary and loading conditions were used for the determination and comparison of fatigue resistance of both types of brackets using linear 3 D FEA. Moreover the size effect of bracket length was also studied using 2 D SHELL element FEA. In the case of brackets with scallop the flange plate weld toe at the corner of the scallop was found to exhibit the highest and made the flange plate weld toe critical for fatigue failure. Whereas weld root and weld toe at the weld intersections were the highly stressed location for brackets without scallop. Thus weld toe for brackets with scallop, and weld root and weld toe for brackets without scallop were found to be the critical area for fatigue failure. Employing identical parameters on both types of brackets, brackets without scallop had the highest except for full penetrated weld. Furthermore the fatigue resistance of brackets without scallop was highly affected by the lack of weld penetration length and it was found out that decreased as the weld penetration was increased. Despite the fact that the very presence of scallop reduces the stiffness and also same time induce stress concentration, based on the 3 D FEA it is worth concluding that using scallop provided better fatigue resistance when both types of brackets were fillet welded. However brackets without scallop had the highest fatigue resistance when full penetration weld was used. This thesis also showed that weld toe for brackets with scallop was the only highly stressed area unlike brackets without scallop in which both weld toe and weld root were the critical locations for fatigue failure when different types of boundary conditions were used. Weld <b>throat</b> <b>thickness,</b> plate thickness, scallop radius, lack of weld penetration length, boundary condition and weld quality affected the fatigue resistance of both types of brackets. And as a result, bracket design procedure, especially welding quality and post weld treatment techniques significantly affect the fatigue resistance of both type of brackets...|$|R

Generally, compared to type I pore structure, type II pore structure is featured by better physical properties, more <b>effective</b> pores and <b>throats,</b> but poorer pore throat radius distribution. Observation under microscope indicates dominant reticular-homogeneous displacement with a few finger-like-reticular displacement (Fig.  8 b–d). Oil remaining in the reservoir is mainly the oil film residual oil and the flowing-around residual oil (Fig.  8 f, i). After the breakthrough of reticular water flooding front, the sweeping area gradually increases, and the dominant displacement is reticular-homogeneous. The ultimate-stage displacement efficiency varies from 33.9 to 35 % {{with an average of}} 34.47 %, which is the secondary high among four types of pore structures.|$|R
40|$|Pharyngitis is {{primarily}} a viral infection of the respiratory tract, followed by secondary bacterial invasion due to weakening of local defenses. Influenza A and rhinoviruses are principally involved, the influenza virus having much higher pathogenicity, however, than rhinoviruses which usually cause the common cough and cold without severe damage to the respiratory mucosa. Following initial infection, the virus enters the cells only for multiplication and almost all virulent virus particles subsequently produced are shed onto the throat surface. From the throat surface, the virions infect new healthy cells, damaging the throat mucosa, and creating a favorable ground for secondary bacterial colonization which {{is the cause of}} almost all symptoms of throat infection (sore throat, strep throat). The virus’ complex structure, its constant mutation, the variety of its surface glycoproteins, as well as the role of topical proteases helping virus entry and virus – bacteria symbiosis must all be taken into account in designing an effective treatment, acting on multiple parameters. As most viruses and all bacteria are present on the throat’s outer lining, treatment should be designed to act topically {{on the surface of the}} pharynx, which also minimizes side effects. Until 2012, no topical antiviral drugs were available and almost all treatment strategies were directed to relieve only the symptomatic manifestations of throat infections. Anti-influenza vaccination is still considered the best preventive measure, while the use of intracellular virus inhibitors is strictly limited to severe cases as they were not found to be very <b>effective</b> once <b>throat</b> infection is established. The recent development of non-specific topical virus glycoprotein inhibitors, incorporated in a filmogen glycerol solution for an increased duration of action, represents a breakthrough yet relatively simple scientific approach for the treatment of viral throat infections accompanied by secondary bacterial infection. In this review, we analyze the whole process of viral throat infection, virus – bacteria interactions on the throat surface, currently available treatments and their drawbacks, and this innovative therapeutic approach consisting in virus glycoprotein inhibitors in an osmotic solution, destined to totally change the future treatment of throat infections...|$|R
