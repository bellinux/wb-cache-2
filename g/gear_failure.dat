5|$|On November 1, 2011, LOT Polish Airlines Flight 16, a 767-300ER, safely {{landed at}} Warsaw Frederic Chopin Airport in Warsaw, Poland after a {{mechanical}} {{failure of the}} landing gear forced an emergency landing with the landing gear up. There were no injuries, but the aircraft involved was damaged and subsequently written off. At {{the time of the}} incident, aviation analysts speculated that {{it may have been the}} first instance of a complete landing <b>gear</b> <b>failure</b> in the 767's service history. Subsequent investigation determined that while a damaged hose had disabled the aircraft's primary landing gear extension system, an otherwise functional backup system was inoperative due to an accidentally deactivated circuit breaker.|$|E
25|$|On 4 January 2015, a Fokker 50 {{carrying}} 6 people crashed landed after {{a landing}} <b>gear</b> <b>failure.</b> Of the 6 on board, no injuries are reported. Jomo Kenyatta Airport was temporarily shut and all flights were diverted to Moi International Airport, Mombasa.|$|E
25|$|On 11 September 1998, China Eastern Flight 586, a McDonnell-Douglas MD-11, {{flying from}} Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport to Beijing Capital International Airport, {{suffered}} a nose <b>gear</b> <b>failure</b> after take-off. The aircraft landed back in Shanghai with the nose gear up on a foamed runway.|$|E
50|$|In September 2007, two {{separate}} incidents of similar landing <b>gear</b> <b>failures</b> occurred within {{four days of}} each other on SAS Dash 8-Q400 aircraft. A third incident occurred in October 2007. On 28 October 2007, {{in a move that}} was described as unique by the Swedish press, the board of directors announced that all 27 Dash 8 Q400 aircraft were to be removed from service due to three landing <b>gear</b> <b>failures.</b>|$|R
50|$|Welsh {{finished}} fourth in Travelodge International but {{could have been}} a challenger for overall victory with one race win and two second placings. Unfortunately, the skiff had <b>gear</b> <b>failures</b> in two races which led to retirements.|$|R
50|$|In September 2007, two {{separate}} incidents of similar landing <b>gear</b> <b>failures</b> occurred within {{four days of}} each other on SAS Dash 8-Q400 aircraft. A third incident occurred in October 2007, leading to {{the withdrawal of the}} type from the airline's fleet.|$|R
25|$|On 27 November 1984, a Beechcraft Baron 58, {{registration}} VH-ETV, {{operating a}} charter {{flight to the}} airport, suffered a left landing <b>gear</b> <b>failure</b> and was substantially damaged. The aircraft departed the runway surface and {{came to rest on}} the grass. None of the occupants were seriously injured.|$|E
25|$|March 25, 2016: Flight 29 {{en route}} from Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport to Nassau, Bahamas {{performed}} an emergency landing at Lynden Pindling International Airport after reporting a main landing <b>gear</b> <b>failure</b> prior to arrival. The pilots landed the Embraer 190 on its main landing gear with the nose gear only partially extended.|$|E
25|$|In the 1977 Indy 500, Janet Guthrie {{made history}} {{when she became}} the first female driver to qualify for the race. Guthrie started the race from 18th {{position}} but retired with timing <b>gear</b> <b>failure</b> after 27 laps. She was eventually classified 29th. Nineteen-seventy seven also saw A.J. Foyt make history when he became the first driver to win the race four times.|$|E
50|$|Problems {{have been}} seen with the 2nd {{generation}} CL models equipped with automatic transmissions (manual transmission models are unaffected). Reports say that after an average of around 40,000 miles, the transmission experiences <b>gear</b> <b>failures,</b> such as downshifts, slipping, flaring and not shifting, and leaking.|$|R
50|$|Bruce Farr skippered Guinness Lady into {{third place}} behind Holmes and Zemanek but was {{certainly}} unlucky {{not to be}} an even stronger challenger. <b>Gear</b> <b>failures</b> {{in each of the}} first two races robbed the young skipper who recorded two wins and a second placing in the final three races.|$|R
50|$|Racing for the America's Cup began On February 15, 2003. In a stiff breeze, Alinghi won {{the first}} race easily after New Zealand, skippered {{throughout}} the series by Dean Barker, withdrew due to multiple <b>gear</b> <b>failures</b> in the rigging and the low cockpit unexpectedly taking onboard large quantities of water.|$|R
25|$|June 18, 1998: Propair Flight 420, a Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner {{flying from}} Dorval International Airport (now Montréal-Trudeau International Airport) to Peterborough Airport in Peterborough, Ontario, {{experienced}} a wing/engine fire {{during the initial}} climb. It attempted an emergency landing at Mirabel, but crashed {{near the beginning of}} the runway, in part due to a landing <b>gear</b> <b>failure.</b> The two pilots and the nine passengers on board were killed.|$|E
25|$|After {{making the}} NASCAR Chase for the Championship, Johnson secured three {{straight}} top five finishes in the GEICO 400, Sylvania 300 and AAA 400. Following a seventeenth-place finish in Good Sam Roadside Assistance 500, Johnson recorded four top-ten finishes, including two consecutive wins from the pole position at Martinsville and Texas, which was his sixtieth {{win in the}} series, to take a seven-point lead over Brad Keselowski. At Phoenix, Johnson blew a right front tire, which caused him to collide into the wall and finish in the 32nd position. He was racing for the win and the championship the following week at Homestead, but his chances of winning the championship was over after he had a pit road penalty and had a <b>gear</b> <b>failure</b> and he finished 36th in that race, and {{finished third in the}} Drivers Championship behind Keselowski and Bowyer.|$|E
2500|$|On 10 September 1998, a U.S. Air Force C-17 (AF Serial No.96-0006) {{delivered}} Keiko {{the whale}} to Vestmannaeyjar, Iceland, a [...] runway, and suffered a landing <b>gear</b> <b>failure</b> during landing. There were no injuries, but the aircraft received major {{damage to the}} landing gear. After receiving temporary repairs, the C-17 was flown to another city in Iceland for further repairs.|$|E
50|$|In September 2007, two {{separate}} incidents of similar landing <b>gear</b> <b>failures</b> occurred within {{four days of}} each other on Bombardier Dash 8-Q400 aircraft, both operated by Scandinavian Airlines (SAS). A third incident, again with an SAS aircraft, occurred in October 2007, leading to {{the withdrawal of the}} type from the airline's fleet.|$|R
5000|$|... 2013 TMR, Indy Lights Homestead {{practice}} {{stopped with}} <b>gear</b> box <b>failure.</b> St Pete Race gear box issues persisted stopping race before start.|$|R
50|$|The {{first race}} was sailed in a stiff breeze and choppy seas. NZL 82 retired due to {{multiple}} <b>gear</b> <b>failures</b> in the rigging {{and the low}} cockpit unexpectedly taking onboard large quantities of water. The end of the boom snapped off due to increased stress caused {{by the weight of}} water in the boat. In addition the headsail pulled out of the groove in the forestay foil, damaging it and preventing a new sail from being hoisted.|$|R
2500|$|However {{the final}} result of the {{development}} was Fokker's pushrod control mechanism, Gestängesteuerung, which allowed the aircraft's forward-firing machine gun to fire only when the propeller {{was out of the}} line of fire. As incorporated into the famous Fokker Eindecker, its use directly led to a phase of German air superiority known as the Fokker Scourge. [...] Despite its shock effect on the enemy, the first Fokker interrupters remained unreliable and were prone to failures. Both Oswald Boelcke and Max Immelmann survived failures which resulted in propellers being shot off and even engines pulled out of their mountings due to the engine becoming unbalanced by the loss of the propeller. Immelmann's eventual death in combat has also been attributed to interrupter <b>gear</b> <b>failure</b> as the aircraft was seen to break up in mid-air while engaged against a Royal Flying Corps F.E.2b.|$|E

50|$|Windward {{speed was}} {{critical}} and Scott Ramsdens vBank of New Zealand was the fastest boat upwind. It enabled the young BNZ skipper to win {{four of the}} seven races and become Giltinan champion in his first season. For defending champion Michael Walsh, however, it was a most forgettable regatta {{as he and his}} team suffered <b>gear</b> <b>failures,</b> capsizes, 720-degree penalty turns and a collision with a ferry, all topped off when Walsh broke his leg in three places in the last race.|$|R
50|$|Another {{problem that}} was never cured during the {{prototype}} stage was a rash of landing gear problems. Although the wide-set gear should have eliminated the collapse of landing gears that plagued the Bf 109, especially in the difficult take-offs and landings, the He 100's landing gear was not built to withstand heavy use, {{and as a result}} they were no improvement over the Bf 109. V2, 3, 4 and 6 were all damaged to various degrees due to various <b>gear</b> <b>failures,</b> a full half of the prototypes.|$|R

40|$|The major {{purpose of}} a gear {{lubricant}} is to provide adequate oil film thickness to reduce and prevent <b>gear</b> tooth surface <b>failures.</b> Real time monitoring for <b>gear</b> <b>failures</b> is important in order to predict and prevent unexpected failures which would {{have a negative impact}} on the efficiency, performance and safety of the gearbox. This paper presents experimental results on the influence of specific oil film thickness on Acoustic Emission (AE) activity for operational helical gears. Variation in film thickness during operations was achieved by spraying liquid nitrogen onto the rotating gear wheel. The experimental results demonstrated a clear relationship between the root mean square (r. m. s) value of the AE signal and the specific film thickness. The findings demonstrate the potential of Acoustic Emission technology to quantify lubrication regimes on operational gears...|$|R
50|$|Conventional rotary-wing {{aircraft}} use {{a set of}} complex mechanical gearboxes to convert the high rotation speed of gas turbines into the low speed required to drive main and tail rotors. Unlike powerplants, mechanical gearboxes cannot be duplicated (for redundancy) and {{have always been a}} major weak point in helicopter reliability. In-flight catastrophic <b>gear</b> <b>failures</b> often result in gearbox jamming and subsequent fatalities, whereas loss of lubrication can trigger onboard fire. Another weakness of mechanical gearboxes is their transient power limitation, due to structural fatigue limits. Recent EASA studies point to engines and transmissions as prime cause of crashes just after pilot errors.|$|R
50|$|In all, eight Q400s had landing <b>gear</b> <b>failures</b> while landing during 2007: four in Denmark, one in Germany, one in Japan, one in Lithuania {{and one in}} South Korea. In November 2007, it was {{revealed}} that the Swedish Civil Aviation Administration had begun an investigation and found Scandinavian Airlines System culpable of cutting corners in its maintenance department. The airline reportedly made 2,300 flights in which safety equipment was not up to standard. On March 10, 2008, SAS ordered 27 more aircraft from Bombardier in a compensation deal: 14 Q400 NextGen turboprops and 13 CRJ900 jets.|$|R
50|$|Though {{the voyage}} was {{planned to be}} a nonstop solo circumnavigation (which, {{with the use of}} one arm, might have {{qualified}} as an around the world sailing record), White's shore team announced on 29 October 2015 that catastrophic <b>gear</b> <b>failure</b> meant it was essential to head for port in northern Spain to undertake repairs. The voyage resumed on 8 November 2015 after a week of repairs in A Coruña. A further serious <b>gear</b> <b>failure</b> necessitated a stop for repairs at Las Palmas on Gran Canaria on 22 November 2015, leaving to resume the journey on 30 November 2015.|$|E
50|$|On 4 April 2012, a twin Cessna made a gear-up landing, after {{a landing}} <b>gear</b> <b>failure.</b> The {{aircraft}} {{came to rest}} on runway 32 and was lifted off by a crane later the same day.|$|E
5000|$|On 9 June 1995, Ansett New Zealand Flight 703 from Auckland Airport to Palmerston North crashed {{west of the}} Tararua Ranges and 16 km east of Palmerston North airport {{during an}} {{instrument}} approach in inclement weather. A landing <b>gear</b> <b>failure</b> distracted the pilot and co-pilot, failing to notice the aircraft had descended into danger. This was complicated by a ground proximity warning not sounding until immediately before the crash. Four {{people were killed and}} most other passengers injured. The official investigation by Air Transport regulators found that the pilot and co-pilot should have abandoned the approach and dealt with the <b>gear</b> <b>failure</b> before attempting a new approach.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a rocket motor turbine-pump {{reduction}} gear system is analyzed {{in regard to}} Hertzian gear tooth contact stresses and times of contact. It is found that the Hertzian contact stresses vary from approximately 100, 000 psi to 200, 000 psi. The times of contact vary from three to eight viicrosec. Some observations regarding the correlation between contact times and <b>gear</b> <b>failures</b> are made. It is indicated {{that it may be}} possible to establish design limitations on the contact times to insure satisfactory gear operation. Sample calculations for evaluating each of the typical quantities found in the tables are included. Sponsored in part by ON...|$|R
40|$|Lateral and {{torsional}} vibration data obtained on a centrifugal compressor train which had shaft instabilities and <b>gear</b> <b>failures</b> is examined. The field data verifies that {{the stability of}} centrifugal compressors can be adversely affected by coincidence of torsional natural frequencies with lateral instability frequencies. The data also indicates that excitation energy from gear boxes can reduce stability margins if energy is transmitted either laterally or torsionally to the compressors. The lateral and torsional coupling mechanisms of shaft systems is discussed. The coupling mechanisms in a large industrial compressor train are documented and the potential effect on rotor stability is demonstrated. Guidelines are set forth to eliminate these potential problems by minimizing the interaction of torsional and lateral responses and their effect on rotor stability...|$|R
40|$|A gearbox with gears of {{different}} sizes {{is a part of}} the vehicle transmission system that plays an important role in transmitting the engine power. In service, gears fail in many ways but mostly due to surface contact fatigue. <b>Gear</b> <b>failures</b> can cost thousands of dollars. Failure due to contact surface fatigue represents an important fraction on all <b>gear</b> <b>failures</b> (about 20 % according to ASM, 1975) and other failure types can have origin from surface contact fatigue. Micropitting is a kind of surface contact fatigue failure which causes pits on the surface of the gear. It looks like dark gray patches to the naked eye. It can be observed in all types of hardened gears and it can occur at a relatively low number of cycles say less than 106 cycles. Surface roughness has the greatest influence on micro pitting. Compressive residual stresses on the surface of the gears can be beneficial in improving the fatigue life of the gears. The aim of this project is to closely study the evolution of residual stresses and surface topography of ground gears that are contact fatigue tested in FZG test rig. To understand the residual stress state and surface roughness change pattern closely test cycles with relatively small intervals are performed. Residual stress and surface roughness were measured on all the tested gears. This report discusses the evolution of residual stresses and the change of the surface roughness on contact fatigue tested carburized ground spur gears. It is found that micropitting starts to initiate at 200 cycles. Compressive residual stresses on the surface tend to increase after 200 cycles and follow a pattern in decreasing over further testing. But, these stress changes are confined only to 10 microns in depth from the gear surface. It is also found from this study that magnitude of residual stress in the axial direction is only one-third of that in the profile direction. The surface roughness keeps reducing gradually until 63 k Cycles...|$|R
