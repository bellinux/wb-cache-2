5|$|Above each stall, the occupant's heraldic {{devices are}} displayed. Perched on the {{pinnacle}} of a knight's stall is his helm, decorated with a mantling and topped by his crest. Under English heraldic law, women other than monarchs do not bear helms or crests; instead, the coronet appropriate to the dame's rank (<b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> a peer or member of the Royal family) is used.|$|E
5|$|During the {{two years}} after their breakup, Ching-teng has no contact with Chia-yi. He qualifies for a {{graduate}} research course at Tunghai University, where he begins writing stories online. Ching-teng only regains contact with Chia-yi after the 921 earthquake, when he calls to see <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> okay. During their long conversation with each other, they both lament {{the fact that they}} were not fated to become a couple.|$|E

Jordis {{went through a}} phase where she kept second guessing herself and wondered <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> right for INXS. After performing the song, Dave Navarro asked <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> losing a little edge and <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> losing a little fire. Jordis said <b>she</b> <b>was</b> stumbling {{and that is why}} wrote the song.|$|R

5|$|Escaping {{the castle}} is made {{difficult}} by shadow creatures {{sent by the}} Queen. These creatures attempt to drag Yorda into black vortexes if Ico leaves her {{for any length of}} time, or <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> in certain areas of the castle. Ico can dispel these shadows using a stick or sword and pull Yorda free <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> drawn into a vortex. While the shadow creatures cannot harm Ico, the game is over if Yorda becomes fully engulfed in a vortex; the player restarts from a save point. The player will also restart from a save point if Ico falls from a large height. Save points in the game are represented by stone benches that Ico and Yorda rest on as the player saves the game. In European and Japanese releases of the game, upon completion of the game, the player has the opportunity to restart the game in a local co-operative two-player mode, where the second player plays as Yorda, still under the same limitations as the computer-controlled version of the character.|$|E

Her co-worker Dave (Nick Offerman) reveals that he knows she has been drinking and she makes him swear not to tell anyone.|$|E
5|$|Ragnarök is briefly {{referenced}} in stanza 40 of {{the poem}} Helgakviða Hundingsbana II.

The maid asks <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> witnessing a delusion since she sees dead men riding, or if Ragnarök has occurred. In stanza 41, Helgi responds that it is neither.|$|E

In between cuts, they are shown in bed caressing each other. Johansson jumps into a pool outside the house, and floats below the surface as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> drowning. Timberlake runs out and pulls her up; she laughs at Timberlake and kisses him.|$|E
5|$|When meeting {{another of}} the same species, P. fimbriata does not use cryptic {{stalking}} but displays by moving quickly and smoothly. In P. fimbriata from Queensland, contests between males usually are very brief and do no damage. Contests between Portia females are usually long and violent, and the victor may evict a loser and then eat the loser's eggs – but victorious females of P. fimbriata from Queensland do not kill and eat the losing female. If a P. fimbriata male from Queensland displays to a female, she may run away or she may charge at him. If the pair reach agreement after this, they will copulate <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> mature, and <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> sub-adult he will cohabit in her nest until she finishes moulting, and then they copulate. P. fimbriata typically copulates much quicker than other jumping spiders. Unlike in other Portia species, females of P. fimbriata do not eat their mates during courting, nor during or after copulation.|$|E
5|$|A female P. labiata {{that sees}} a male may {{approach}} slowly or wait. The male then walks with erect and displaying by waving {{his legs and}} palps. If the female does not run away, she gives a propulsive display first. If the male stands his ground and she does not ran away or repeat the propulsive display, he approaches and, <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> mature, they copulate. If the female is sub-adult (one moult from maturity), a male may cohabit in the female's capture web. Portias usually mate on a web or on a dragline made by the female. P. labiata typically copulates for about 100seconds, while other genera can take several minutes or even several hours.|$|E

5|$|Although Chell is {{equipped}} with mechanized heel springs to prevent damage from falling, she can be killed by various other hazards in the test chambers, such as turret guns, bouncing balls of energy, and toxic liquid. She can also be killed by objects falling through portals, and {{by a series of}} crushers that appear in certain levels. Unlike most action games at the time, there is no health indicator; Chell dies <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> dealt a certain amount of damage in a short time period, but returns to full health fairly quickly. Some obstacles, such as the energy balls and crushing pistons, deal fatal damage with a single blow.|$|E

Once alone Andy drinks the entire bottle of the supplement, which makes him intoxicated, prompting him to admit his jealousy to Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith). Phyllis volunteers to talk to Erin and find out <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> having sex with Gabe, but as Phyllis is fairly intoxicated herself, her inquiries segue into an explicit account of her sexual experiences with her husband Bob, which mortifies Erin. Andy's intoxication turns into sickness, and he ultimately retreats to Gabe's room and vomits on the bed.|$|E

With Amar's help and constant studying, Apu manages to complete the challenge. Her mother is overjoyed, but is heartbroken when Apu informs her that she performed well in school with the sole purpose of ensuring her mother's absence at school. In her anger, Chanda breaks her promise and returns to school, performing even better than before, much to Apu's chagrin. After allotting more time to school, Chanda loses one of her four jobs and begins to work at a restaurant because Amar recommends the job.|$|E

During Olivia's final test in the tank, she is again able to cross over to the gift shop in the prime universe. She is able to recall Ella's phone number and calls her, but is brought back to the parallel universe shortly after Ella answers. As she is removed from the tank, she lies, telling Walternate the test did not work.|$|E
5|$|In 1649, {{the town}} is witness to many witch burnings. In the church, the townspeople {{try to figure out}} whom to condemn next. People begin accusing others and soon they erupt into chaos, until Marge intervenes. She tries to talk sense into the townspeople, but Moe accuses her of being a witch. Quimby assures her that she is {{entitled}} to due process which means she will be thrown off a cliff with a broomstick; <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> a witch she will be able to fly to safety, in which case the authorities expect her to report back for punishment. <b>If</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> not a witch, then she will fall to an honorable Christian death. After being shoved off the cliff, Marge flies up on the broomstick revealing that she really is a witch and vows to conquer the whole entire town. She returns to her sisters Patty and Selma. The sisters watch Ned and Maude Flanders talking about how the witches eat children, which gives them the notion to do just that. They knock on the Flanders' door and demand their sons, but before they leave, Maude offers the witches gingerbread men instead. The witches like these better than the children so they go to each house, getting goodies in exchange for not eating the children. As they fly off, the Sea Captain says that is how the tradition of Halloween and trick-or-treating started.|$|E

5|$|It {{is clear}} that John has an ulterior motive; first, he paralyses Gwen and locks her in a crate telling her that <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> not found in two hours, her main organs will stop working and she would die. He then finds Owen and Tosh, {{shooting}} the former in the hip. After letting Ianto go, he finally confronts Jack, who realises that the bombs are an elementary 51st century confidence trick. Jack throws the device over the building, and John pushes him off the roof in retaliation.|$|E

Towards the end of the series it is revealed that she is one of many clones, whose use is to replace the currently existing Rei <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> killed.|$|E
