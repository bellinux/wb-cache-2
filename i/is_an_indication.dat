5|$|Ivan Sratsimir {{began to}} mint his own coinage {{to show his}} {{legitimacy}} {{as early as the}} 1360s. The abundance of coin treasure troves found in the territory of the Tsardom of Vidin <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> of the wealth and the well developed trade in the region {{during the second half of}} the 14th century. The Brașov Charter, the only surviving document made by Ivan Sratsimir, grants the merchants of the Transylvanian town of Brașov free access and the right to trade in his realm.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{are silent}} {{regarding}} the events following the first Persian campaign but the silence in itself <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> {{of the peace}} that prevailed and that the Persians stopped being {{a threat to the}} Roman East. The evidence for the second campaign is meager; Zosimus is the only one to mention it specifically. A passage in the Sibylline Oracles is interpreted by Hartmann as an indication of the second invasion. The campaign took place in 266 or 267 and was aimed directly at Ctesiphon; Odaenathus reached the walls of the Persian capital but had to cancel the siege and march north to face the influx of Germanic riders attacking Anatolia.|$|E

5|$|Most {{information}} on the social life in Vijayanagara empire comes from the writings of foreign visitors and evidence that research teams in the Vijayanagara area have uncovered. The Hindu caste system was prevalent and rigidly followed, with each caste represented by a local body of elders who represented the community. These elders set {{the rules and regulations}} that were implemented with the help of royal decrees. Untouchability was part of the caste system and these communities were represented by leaders (Kaivadadavaru). The Muslim communities were represented by their own group in coastal Karnataka. The caste system did not, however, prevent distinguished persons from all castes from being promoted to high-ranking cadre in the army and administration. In civil life, by virtue of the caste system, Brahmins enjoyed a high level of respect. With {{the exception of a few}} who took to military careers, most Brahmins concentrated on religious and literary matters. Their separation from material wealth and power made them ideal arbiters in local judicial matters, and their presence in every town and village was a calculated investment made by the nobility and aristocracy to maintain order. However, the popularity of low-caste scholars (such as Molla and Kanakadasa) and their works (including those of Vemana and Sarvajna) <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> of the degree of social fluidity in the society.|$|E

5000|$|Bioactive {{compounds}} induce phenotypic {{changes in}} target cells, {{changes that are}} observable by microscopy, and which can give insight into the mechanism of action of the compound. [...] With antibacterial agents, for example, the conversion of target cells to spheroplasts can <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> that peptidoglycan synthesis is being targeted, and filamentation of target cells can <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> that FtsZ or DNA is being targeted. [...] In the case of anticancer agents, bleb formation can <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> that the compound is disrupting the plasma membrane. [...] A current limitation {{of this approach is}} the time required to manually generate and interpret data, but advances in automated microscopy and image analysis software may help resolve this.|$|R

25|$|The {{rejection}} of the reference topology <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>indication</b> that the evolutionary history for that gene family is inconsistent with the reference tree.
