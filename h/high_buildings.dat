5|$|Wind {{causes the}} {{generation}} of sound. The movement of air causes movements of parts of natural objects, such as leaves or grass. These objects will produce sound if they touch each other. Even a soft wind will cause {{a low level of}} environmental noise. If the wind is blowing harder, it may produce howling sounds of varying frequencies. This may be caused by the wind blowing over cavities, or by vortices created in the air downstream of an object. Especially on <b>high</b> <b>buildings,</b> many structural parts may be a cause of annoying noise at certain wind conditions. Examples of these parts are balconies, ventilation openings, roof openings or cables.|$|E
25|$|Warring States-era {{architecture}} {{had several}} definitive aspects. City walls, used for defense, were made longer, and indeed several secondary walls were also sometimes built {{to separate the}} different districts. Versatility in federal structures was emphasized, {{to create a sense}} of authority and absolute power. Architectural elements such as high towers, pillar gates, terraces, and <b>high</b> <b>buildings</b> amply conveyed this.|$|E
25|$|Concerns {{have been}} raised by law {{enforcement}} and fire and rescue teams of the risk in jumping off <b>high</b> <b>buildings.</b> They argue that practitioners are needlessly risking damage to both themselves and rooftops by practicing at height, with police forces calling for practitioners {{to stay off the}} rooftops. Some practitioners of Parkour agree that such behaviour should be discouraged.|$|E

25|$|During the {{transition}} from the late Middle Ages to modern times when, {{as a result of the}} development of firearms, a revolution in military technology took place, the bergfried gradually lost its military function, as any <b>high</b> <b>buildings</b> were particularly vulnerable to cannon fire and explosives. In response to these developments, castles were converted into fortresses of a new type, the bergfried being often thereby demolished or dismantled, as for example at Coburg Fortress or Wildenstein.|$|E
25|$|Horses play {{a larger}} role in Brotherhood, not only used as a means of {{transport}} (inside the city for the first time) but as a component of acrobatic sequences and advanced combat as well, allowing ranged weapons to be used while riding them. Brotherhood also introduces various types of horse-related assassinations, featuring horse-to-horse assassinations. There are environmental objects like the flower pot in Assassin's Creed II to move faster inside the city (a system of tunnels around the city allow fast travel), as well as new objects such as merchandise lifts to quickly climb up <b>high</b> <b>buildings</b> or structures.|$|E
25|$|For {{the poor}} of Paris, life was very different. They were crowded into tall, narrow, five- or six-story <b>high</b> <b>buildings</b> {{that lined the}} winding streets on the Île de la Cité and other medieval {{quarters}} of the city. Crime in the dark streets was a serious problem. Metal lanterns were hung in the streets, and Colbert increased to four hundred the number of archers who acted as night watchmen. Gabriel Nicolas de la Reynie was appointed the first lieutenant-general of police of Paris in 1667, a position he held for thirty years; his successors reported directly to the king.|$|E

Koubek limited his [...] "cosmetics" [...] to the needs and budgets of his clients, often falling back on the design aesthetics of Marcel Breuer, I. M. Pei, and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe.

500|$|As {{early as}} 1991 the school {{district}} began to plan for an additional high school. Initial projections were to add 2 new high schools to the then 6 operating by 2000. However a lack of funds allowed the construction of only one high school. The increasing {{number of children who}} attend public rather than non-public schools was attributed to part of the need. In 1974, 53% of children born in St. Paul later entered kindergarten in the city public schools. In 1990, 67% of the city's children attended public schools. Overcrowding was so severe that in 1992 a citizen's group recommended moving 9th grade back into junior <b>high</b> <b>buildings.</b> The overcrowding was blamed on a surge in the birthrate in Saint Paul and a sudden influx of students from the suburbs, an unusual occurrence in an inner city school district. Plans for a [...] "high tech" [...] high school were put in place in as early as 1992.|$|E

Groundwater extraction in Jakarta by far exceeds groundwater recharge, {{leading to a}} falling groundwater table and land subsidence. Land subsidence was first identified when cracks were discovered in [...] the Sarinah bridge in 1978. Land subsidence is also caused {{by the weight of}} increasingly <b>high</b> <b>buildings.</b> It varies by neighbourhoods. Between 1993 and 2005 the largest rate of land subsidence occurred in Central Jakarta at 2.40m, from 3.42m to 1.02m above sea level. In North Jakarta the decline was 57cm, from 2.03m to 1.46m. In West Jakarta, East Jakarta and South Jakarta the decline was 2, 11 and 28cm only respectively. However, the private companies do not extract groundwater, but purchase bulk surface water from far outside the city limits.|$|E

2500|$|The {{educational}} system in Zimbabwe {{which was once}} regarded as {{among the best in}} Africa, has gone into crisis because of the country's economic meltdown. Almost a quarter of the teachers have quit the country, absenteeism is <b>high,</b> <b>buildings</b> are crumbling and standards plummeting. One foreign reporter witnessed hundreds of children at Hatcliffe Extension Primary School in Epworth, 12 miles west of Harare, writing in the dust on the floor because they had no exercise books or pencils. The high school exam system unravelled in 2007. Examiners refused to mark examination papers when they were offered just Z$79 a paper, enough to buy three small candies. Corruption has crept into the system and may explain why in January 2007 thousands of pupils received no marks for subjects they had entered, while others were deemed [...] "excellent" [...] in subjects they had not sat. Various disused offices and storerooms have been turned into makeshift brothels at the University of Zimbabwe in Harare by students and staff who have turned to prostitution to make ends meet. Students are destitute following the institution's refusal in July to re-open their halls of residence, effectively banning students from staying on campus. Student leaders believe this was part of the administration's plan to take revenge on them for their demonstrations over deteriorating standards.|$|E

Stairways lead from the plaza floor to the temples above. [...] Unlike the rest of the city, these four buildings are uniform in height and nearly symmetrical. [...] The pyramids here are primitive in comparison to the rest of the site, with niches that are not as finely formed. The east and west pyramids of the arroyo group each held three temples at the top. Another unusual feature is that this plaza has no smaller structures such as buildings or altars to break up the space. It has been determined that this was the city marketplace because of the large plaza space for stalls and for a deity found here that is related to commerce. [...] The merchant deity found here has features more in common with this kind of deity in the central highlands of Mexico than of Tajín. The market that filled this plaza consisted of stalls made with sticks and cloth offering regional products such as vanilla as well as products from other parts of Mesoamerica such as jaguar skins, exotic birds such as the parrot [...] and the macaw and quetzal feathers. Slaves for service and sacrifice were also sold here. [...] West of the building on the south side is a large ball court with sloped sides and sculpted friezes depicting the god Quetzalcoatl. [...] When the city fell, most of the sculptures in this area were smashed or defaced with some being reused as building stone.|$|E
