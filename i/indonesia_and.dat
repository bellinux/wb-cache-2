40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the effectiveness of}} Bank <b>Indonesia's</b> <b>and</b> Bank of Thailand's monetary policy communication. We focus on two channels of communication: monetary policy statements, and inter-meeting statements. Although the structure of Bank <b>Indonesia's</b> <b>and</b> Bank of Thailand's monetary policy statements have some differences, most of the statements contain policy inclination. In addition, during inter-meeting periods, members of their board of governors often convey statements that contain policy inclination. Our empirical results show that to some extent Bank <b>Indonesia's</b> <b>and</b> Bank of Thailand's monetary policy statements and inter-meeting statements move short-term interest rates effectively. We find that there is asymmetry in {{the effects of the}} statements, that is, the statements with loose policy inclination tend to be more effective relative to the statements with tight policy inclination. communication, effectiveness, monetary policy, Bank Indonesia, Bank of Thailand...|$|R
