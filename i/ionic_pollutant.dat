40|$|The {{development}} of simple and recyclable adsorbents with high adsorption capacity is a technical imperative for water treatment. In this work, we have successfully developed new adsorbents {{for the removal}} of <b>ionic</b> <b>pollutants</b> from water via encapsulation of polyelectrolyte complexes (PECs) made from positively charged poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) and negatively charged poly(l- 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylalanine) (PDopa), obtained via the self-polymerization of l- 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-Dopa). Given the outstanding mass transport through the hydrogel host matrixes, the PDopa-PAH PEC guests loaded inside can effectively and efficiently remove various <b>ionic</b> <b>pollutants,</b> including heavy metal ions and ionic organic dyes, from water. The adsorption efficiency of the PDopa-PAH PECs can be quantitatively correlated to and tailored by the PDopa-to-PAH molar ratio. Because PDopa embodies one catechol group, one carboxyl group, and one amino group in each repeating unit, the resulting PDopa-PAH PECs exhibit the largest capacity of adsorption of heavy metal ions compared to available adsorbents. Because both PDopa and PAH are pH-sensitive, the PDopa-PAH PEC-loaded agarose hydrogel beads can be easily and completely recovered after the adsorption of <b>ionic</b> <b>pollutants</b> by adjusting the pH of the surrounding media. The present strategy is similar to the conventional process of using PECs to flocculate <b>ionic</b> <b>pollutants</b> from water, while in our system flocculation is confined to the agarose hydrogel beads, thus allowing easy separation of the resulting adsorbents from water...|$|R
40|$|Hydrotalcite (HT) -based {{materials}} are usually applied to capture anionic pollutants in aqueous solutions. Generally considered anion exchangers, {{their ability to}} capture radioactive cations is rarely exploited. In the present work, we explored the ability of pristine and calcined HT getters to effectively capture radioactive cations (Sr 2 + and Ba 2 +) which can be securely stabilized at the getter surface. It is found that calcined HT outperforms its pristine counterpart in cation removal ability. Meanwhile, a novel anion removal mechanism targeting radioactive I – is demonstrated. This approach involves HT surface modification with silver species, namely, Ag 2 CO 3 nanoparticles, which can attach firmly on HT surface by forming coherent interface. This HT-based anion getter can be further used to capture I – in aqueous solution. The observed I – uptake mechanism is distinctly different from the widely reported ion exchange mechanism of HT and much more efficient. As {{a result of the}} high local concentrations of precipitants on the getters, radioactive ions in water can be readily immobilized onto the getter surface by forming precipitates. The secured <b>ionic</b> <b>pollutants</b> can be subsequently removed from water by filtration or sedimentation for safe disposal. Overall, these stable, inexpensive getters are the materials of choice for removal of trace <b>ionic</b> <b>pollutants</b> from bulk radioactive liquids, especially during episodic environmental crisis...|$|R
40|$|The {{goals of}} this program have been to develop a series of new {{compounds}} that act as redox recyclable heavy metal ion selective materials. This has been a preliminary exploration into the viability of creating materials that act as selective exchange media. We have historically {{been involved in the}} separation of <b>ionic</b> <b>pollutants</b> such as radionuclides or toxic heavy metal ions from water by designing extractants with high selectivities and large capacities. We have also recognized that there is a more urgent need to develop processes that allow the target pollutants to be recovered in a minimal volume of secondary waste and that allow the extractants to be reused or recycled. We have been studying redox active transition-metal-containing extractants that undergo reversible electron transfer activation and deactivation as the target ions are extracted and recovered or that undergo efficient, selective ion exchange...|$|R
40|$|The {{removal of}} dye and toxic <b>ionic</b> <b>pollutants</b> from water is an {{extremely}} important issue that requires systematic and efficient adsorbent preparation strategies. To address this challenge, we developed composite chitosan (CS) -based hydrogels containing hyper-crosslinked polymer (HCP) particles {{to be used as}} broad-spectrum adsorbents. The goal is to efficiently combine the dye adsorption ability of chitosan and the capacity of the porous particles of trapping pollutant molecules. The HCP particles are well distributed and firmly embedded into the chitosan matrix and the composite hydrogels exhibit improved mechanical properties. Adsorption experiments reveal a synergistic effect between CS and HCP particles, and the samples are able to remove both anionic and cationic dyes (indigo carmine, rhodamine 6 G and sunset yellow) from water. The maximum dye uptake is higher than that of comparable biosorbents. Moreover, the mechanical properties of the composite hydrogels are enhanced respect to pure CS, and the samples can be regenerated and reused keeping their adsorption ability unaltered over successive cycles of adsorption, desorption, and washing...|$|R
40|$|Decontamination of {{fine-grained}} soils from <b>ionic</b> <b>pollutants</b> {{by conventional}} methods {{is not only}} costly but also mostly ineffective because of their low hydraulic conductivity, low biodiversity, and strong adsorption on their surface. To decontaminate soils of low hydraulic conductivity, the application electrical potential along with passing of water under hydraulic gradient has come into vogue. This method is called electro-kinetic remediation. The efficiency of removal of cations near cathode is well established, the removal of anions at anode is not that effective. In this case, the electrical potential causes the migration of anions towards the anode is inhibited by opposing osmotic flow. Hence, the removal of anions by electro-kinetic extraction method is less effective compare to cations, how it will affect the sulphate ion migration has been studied in this paper. From the study, {{it has been observed}} that the breakthrough curve of sulphate ion under electrical potential is significantly lower than under advection and diffusion only. It is also concluded that inspite of electro osmotic flow occurring in the opposite direction, the breakthrough of sulphate occurs earlier because of migration of sulphate ion towards anode under electrical gradient...|$|R
40|$|Porous alumosilicate aggregate, namely perlite, {{was used}} as an {{alternative}} material in wastewater treatments for the selective removal of <b>ionic</b> <b>pollutants</b> such as lead which is present in industrial wastewaters and toxic at relatively low concentrations. Metal retention was investigated by single metals and multispecies equilibrium isotherms (batch system) and by carrying out dynamic (column) experiments. Lead ions were supposedly preferentially retained by ion exchange at the negatively charged silicate functional groups present on the perlite material, and to a minor extent by weak electrostatic (Van der Waals) interactions at non-specific functionalities. In the case of the batch system, the Freundlich isotherm gave a good correlation of the experimental data and lead maximum retention (qmax) in single ion solution was 4. 28 mg/gperlite, and in multimetal solution was 1. 50 mg/gperlite. In the case of the column system, overall capacity was 3. 7 mg/gperlite in single ion solution, and in multimetal solution was 3. 0 mg/gperlite. In multimetal solutions, lead ions showed the best interaction at the perlite functional groups because of the lowest free energies of hydration and hydrated radius. After sorption, perlite beads were used as lightweight aggregates for cement mortars after evaluation of the potential release of lead ions from the conglomerates...|$|R
30|$|The {{main focus}} {{in this review}} is showing {{how to use the}} {{developed}} buffer theory for assessing and predicting the long-term phenomena of attenuation and natural remediation of <b>ionic</b> <b>pollutants</b> in contaminated aquatic ecosystems, as well as for analyzing the way by which metals move and transform within the environment, the distribution of metals in ecosystems, their deposition and cycling in the terrestrial environment. The buffer theory is based on the rigorous thermodynamic analysis of complex chemical equilibria under environmental conditions in aquatic ecosystems, as natural waters and soils. It has been established that both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems manifest a buffer action towards all their components. The buffer properties in relation to the solid phase components are amplified with an increase of solubility due to protolytic or complex formation equilibria in saturated solutions. It has been established that the buffer capacities of components are mutually proportional, whereas for heterogeneous systems these relationships depend on the stoichiometric composition of solid phases. The use of the developed buffer approach may yield extended knowledge and {{a deeper understanding of the}} processes that control the concentrations of components. A number of the important conclusions concerning the investigated buffer systems have been made. The obtained results are indented to provide researchers with a tool needed to help them to set reliable limits of ion (metal) levels in the environment.|$|R
30|$|Lead {{is known}} as the heavy metals, which is {{strongly}} toxic to humans, animals, and plants. Inter of lead to the human body even at low concentrations causes serious problems to the nervous and reproductive system, kidney, liver, brain and bony tissues (Grant 2008; Renner 2010; Andrade et al. 2015). Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approved the maximum threshold limit of 0.015  ppm for lead in drinking water. The removal of lead from wastewaters, before discharging to aquatic environment, in high concentration is accomplished by common processes, including precipitation with hydroxide ion or lime and in low concentration by advanced processes such as ion exchange, coagulation, electrochemical process, reverse osmosis, and ion flotation (Ehrampoush et al. 2015). These methods are costly and produce the secondary wastes. One of the high-performance and low-cost methods for removing of <b>ionic</b> <b>pollutants</b> from aqueous solutions is adsorption. However, the cost of used adsorbents and their separation from suspension after adsorption are the important restricting factors in perspective on the applicability of adsorption process. Recently, considerable notation has been given to the development of substitutes from readily available and cheaper materials such as agricultural wastes for preparation of activated carbon to remove pollutants to approach the standard levels (Babel and Kurniawan 2003). Until now, using of low-cost agricultural sorbents, including Ponkan peel (Pavan et al. 2008), waste tea leaves (Cheraghi et al. 2015), potato peel (Taha et al. 2011), modified onion skins (Saka et al. 2011), the activate carbon of peanut shell (Wilson et al. 2006), pistachio shell, and apricot stone (Kazemipour et al. 2008), have been examined for removing of Pb 2 + ions from aqueous solutions.|$|R
40|$|Solid/liquid {{interfaces}} are exploited {{in various}} industrial applications because confinement strongly modifies the physico-chemical properties of bulk fluids. In that context, investigating the dynamical properties of confined fluids {{is crucial to}} identify and better understand the key factors responsible for their behavior and to optimize their structural and dynamical properties. For that purpose, we have developed multi-quanta spin-locking nuclear magnetic resonance relaxometry of quadrupolar nuclei in order {{to fill the gap}} between the time-scales accessible by classical procedures (like dielectric relaxation, inelastic and quasi-elastic neutron scattering) and obtain otherwise unattainable dynamical information. This work focuses on the use of quadrupolar nuclei (like 2 H, 7 Li and 133 Cs), because quadrupolar isotopes are the most abundant NMR probes in the periodic table. Clay sediments are the confining media selected for this study because they are ubiquitous materials implied in numerous industrial applications (<b>ionic</b> exchange, <b>pollutant</b> absorption, drilling, waste storing, cracking and heterogeneous catalysis) ...|$|R
30|$|The {{electrical}} conductivity (EC) {{which is a}} measure of water capacity to convey electric current, varied from 61.7 to 82.2 and 62.5 to 83   6  μS/cm with mean values of 69.76 and 71.01  μS/cm in the wet and dry seasons, respectively (Tables  1, 2; Fig.  2). This is below the range (99 – 207  μS/cm) reported by Amoah and Koranteng (2006). The lower EC in the study area indicates the low enrichment of salts in the surface water. The value of {{electrical conductivity}} may be an approximate index of the total content of dissolved substance in water and depends upon temperature, concentration and types of ions present (Hem 1985). <b>Ionic</b> <b>pollutants</b> from anthropogenic sources and soluble minerals from bedrock (Kney and Brandes 2007) contributed to the EC in the study area. The EC can be classified as type I, if the enrichments of salts are low (EC <  1, 500  μS/cm); type II, if the enrichment of salts are medium (EC 1, 500 and 3, 000  μS/cm); and type III, if the enrichments of salts are high (EC >  3, 000  μS/cm). According to the above classification of EC, all the surface water samples came under the type I (low enrichment of salts). The EC values were below the 1, 400  μS/cm set by WHO (2004) standard for drinking water. Total dissolved solute TDS, {{is a measure of}} the total ions in solution and values were found ranging from 29.7 to 39.1  mg/L with a mean value of 33.8  mg/L in the wet season (Table  1; Fig.  2). The dry season varied from 29.7 to 39.4 with a mean value of 33.83 (Table  2; Fig.  2). Davis and De Wiest (1966) classified TDS in water as follows: desirable for drinking (< 500  mg/L) and permissible for drinking (500 – 1, 000  mg/L). According to the above criteria, all the water samples were found desirable for drinking. Also, the water will be safe for drinking according to the WHO (2004) standard. TDS concentrations in natural waters are the result of weathering and dissolution of minerals from local soil and bedrock (Freeze and Cherry 1979; Peters 1984; Kney and Brandes 2007). Primary sources for TDS in receiving waters are agricultural runoff, leaching of soil contaminant and point source water pollution discharged from industrial or sewage treatment plants.|$|R
40|$|The North Atlantic Landscape Conservation Cooperative LCC (NA LCC) is a public–private {{partnership}} that provides information to support conservation decisions {{that may be}} affected by global climate change (GCC) and other threats. The NA LCC region extends from southeast Virginia to the Canadian Maritime Provinces. Within this region, the US National Climate Assessment documented increases in air temperature, total precipitation, frequency of heavy precipitation events, and rising sea level, and predicted more drastic changes. Here, we synthesize literature {{on the effects of}} GCC interacting with selected contaminant, nutrient, and environmental processes to adversely affect natural resources within this region. Using a case study approach, we focused on 3 stressors with sufficient NA LCC regionspecific information for an informed discussion. We describe GCC interactions with a contaminant (Hg) and 2 complex environmental phenomena—freshwater acidification and eutrophication. We also prepared taxa case studies on GCCand GCC-contaminant/nutrient/process effects on amphibians and freshwater mussels. Several avian species of high conservation concern have blood Hg concentrations that have been associated with reduced nesting success. Freshwater acidification has adversely affected terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in the Adirondacks and other areas of the region that are slowly recovering due to decreased emissions of N and sulfur oxides. Eutrophication in many estuaries within the region is projected to increase from greater storm runoff and less denitrification in riparian wetlands. Estuarine hypoxia may be exacerbated by increased stratification. Elevated water temperature favors algal species that produce harmful algal blooms (HABs). In several of the region 2 ̆ 7 s estuaries, HABs have been associated with bird die-offs. In the NA LCC region, amphibian populations appear to be declining. Some species may be adversely affected by GCC through higher temperatures and more frequent droughts. GCC may affect freshwater mussel populations via altered stream temperatures and increased sediment loading during heavy storms. Freshwater mussels are sensitive to un-ionized ammonia that more toxic at higher temperatures. We recommend studying the interactive effects of GCC on generation and bioavailability of methylmercury and how GCC-driven shifts in bird species distributions will affect avian exposure to methylmercury. Research is needed on how decreases in acid deposition concurrent with GCC will alter the structure and function of sensitive watersheds and surface waters. Studies are needed to determine how GCC will affect HABs and avian disease, and how more severe and extensive hypoxia will affect fish and shellfish populations. Regarding amphibians, we suggest research on 1) thermal tolerance and moisture requirements of species of concern, 2) effects of multiple stressors (temperature, desiccation, contaminants, nutrients), and 3) approaches to mitigate impacts of increased temperature and seasonal drought. We recommend studies to assess which mussel species and populations are vulnerable and which are resilient to rising stream temperatures, hydrological shifts, and <b>ionic</b> <b>pollutants,</b> all of which are influenced by GCC...|$|R
40|$|Adsorption of Enrofloxacin (ENR) on {{minerals}} {{dominates the}} fate and transport of ENR in the environment. In this study, the sorption process of ENR on montmorillonite {{and the impact}} of dissolved organic matters (DOMs) on ENR-montmorillonite interactions were investigated using in situ ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and two-dimensional correlation analysis (2 D-COS). Negative peaks were observed in the 3400 - 2900 cm(- 1) region due to the loss of hydrated protons at montmorillonite surfaces. The primary characteristic peaks of adsorbed ENR molecules were resolved in the 1800 - 1100 cm(- 1) range. The results of 2 D-COS suggested the sorption process was initiated by the interaction of hydrated protons on montmorillonite surfaces with diverse moieties of ENR molecules depending on pH. The sorption mechanism of ENR was mainly cation exchange at acidic condition, charge neutralization at neutral condition, and proton transfer at alkaline condition. DOM could interact with piperazinyl amine groups of dissolved ENR, which changed the interaction sequence of ENR molecule with montmorillonite surfaces. Electrostatic interaction was the predominant driving force for the interaction between DOM and dissolved ENR. H-donor-acceptor interaction and pi-pi interaction may also be responsible to this interaction. Insights gained from this study improve our understandings on sorption mechanism of ENR and similar <b>ionic</b> organic <b>pollutants</b> in soil systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Rotating RO takes advantage of high shear and the Taylor vortex instability to reduce the flux decline related to concentration polarization and membrane fouling.

A model developed for rotating RO allowed the prediction of flux and pollutant rejection over a wide range of design and operational parameters.

40|$|Many {{microorganisms}} {{exist in}} a biogel-mediated micro-environment such as a cell wall or a biofilm, in which local concentrations of <b>ionic</b> nutrients and <b>pollutants</b> differ {{from those in the}} surrounding bulk medium. The local concentration is the relevant parameter for considerations of bioavailability. These modified concentrations arise {{as a consequence of the}} negative charges within biogels which may induce a Donnan potential inside the biogel phase. For metals, the net effect on the speciation within the biogel, relative to the bulk medium, is an enhancement of the concentration of free cations. Since the structural charge in the biogel arises from protolytic functional groups, the Donnan potential is pH dependent. Here we apply in situ voltammetry to measure the free metal ion concentration inside alginate gel as a function of pH. In the pH range 3 to 7, the speciation of CdII within this model biogel can be explained by specific binding to carboxylic functional groups and electrostatic binding resulting from the Donnan potentia...|$|R

Seven candidate RO membranes were compared using a batch stirred cell to determine the membrane flux and the solute rejection for synthetic space mission wastewaters. Even though the urea molecule is larger than ions such as Na+, Cl-, and NH 4 +, the rejection of urea is lower. This indicates that the chemical interaction between solutes and the membrane {{is more important than the}} size exclusion effect. Low pressure reverse osmosis (LPRO) membranes appear to be most desirable because of their high permeate flux and rejection. Solute rejection is dependent on the shear rate, indicating the importance of concentration polarization.

40|$|Surfactant {{micelles}} {{combined with}} ultrafiltration can partially, or sometimes nearly completely, separate various <b>ionic</b> and nonionic <b>pollutants</b> from water. To this end, the selectivity of aqueous micelles composed of either cetyltrimethylammonium (CTA+) bromide or cetylpyridinium (CP+) chloride towards many environmentally relevant anions (IO 3 -, F-, Cl-, HCO 3 -, NO 2 -, Br-, NO 3 -, H 2 PO 4 -, HPO 42 -, SO 42 -, and CrO 42 -) was investigated. Selectivity coefficients of CTA+ micelles (with respect to Br-) and CP+ micelle (with respect to Cl-) for these anions were evaluated using a simple thermodynamic ion exchange model. The sequence of anion {{affinity for the}} CTA+ micelles and for the CP+ micelles were the same, with decreasing affinity occurring in the order: CrO 42 - 3 ̆e SO 42 - 3 ̆e HPO 42 - 3 ̆e NO 3 - 3 ̆e Br- 3 ̆e NO 2 - 3 ̆e Cl - 3 ̆e HCO 3 - 3 ̆e F- 2 ̆ 6 ap; H 2 PO 4 -. From the associated component mass balance and ion exchange (i. e., mass action) equations, an overall speciation model was developed to predict the distribution of all anions between the aqueous phase and micellar pseudo-phase for complex ionic mixtures. Experimental results of both artificial and typical surface waters were in good agreement to model predictions. ^ A significant issue with surfactant micellar enhanced ultrafiltration is the significant and constant loss of surfactant monomers across the membranes {{due to the fact}} that surfactant monomers within the micelles are in rapid equilibrium with the aqueous phase surfactant monomers. To overcome this issue, a new quaternary ammonium hydroxypropyl conjugated linoleic acid ester (QACLE) cationic surfactant was synthesized through the reaction of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and (2, 3 -epoxypropyl) trimethylammonium chloride (ETAC). When QACLE was present in aqueous micellar form, it was easily cross-linked, forming stable cross-linked quaternary ammonium stearic acid ester (QASE) nanoparticles with high anion exchange capacity. ^ The selectivity coefficients of the QACLE micelles towards the common anions in natural water were evaluated using the ion exchange thermodynamic model, and was compared to those measured for micelles composed of two commercially available cationic surfactants, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC). The sequence in anion affinity for all the three micellar phases was the same. Using the necessary mass balance and ion exchange reactions, a model was developed to predict the distribution of all anions between the aqueous and nanoparticle phases. The model was applied to predict anion association to QASE nanoparticles, contained in dialysis and ultrafiltration membranes, and the results indicate that the cross-linking of QACLE monomers did not alter the values of the selectivity coefficients for any of the anions. The relatively large affinities of the divalent anions and NO 3 -, and the experiment results (using artificial and real surface waters), indicate that the new QASE nanoparticles have the potential to recover anionic nutrients from natural and polluted waters. ...|$|R
