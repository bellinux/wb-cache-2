5000|$|When some {{external}} shock reduces employment, {{so that some}} <b>insiders</b> become outsiders, the number of <b>insiders</b> decreases. This incentivizes the <b>insiders</b> to set even higher wages when the economy again gets better, as there are not as many <b>insiders</b> remaining as before, instead of letting the outsiders to again get jobs at earlier wages. This causes hysteresis, i.e., the unemployment becomes permanently higher after negative shocks.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{formulate}} {{the optimal}} hedging problem when the underlying stock price has jumps, especially for <b>insiders</b> {{who have more}} information than the general public. The jumps in the underlying price process depend on another diffusion process, which models a sequence of firm-specific information. This diffusion process is observed only by <b>insiders.</b> Nevertheless, the market is incomplete to <b>insiders</b> {{as well as to}} the general public. We use the local risk minimization method to find an optimal hedging strategy for <b>insiders.</b> We also numerically compare the value of the <b>insider's</b> hedging portfolio with the value of an honest trader's hedging portfolio for a simulated sample path of a stock price.

40|$|Purpose: The {{main purpose}} of this thesis is to {{classify}} <b>insiders</b> of firms listed on the OMX Stockholm stock exchange into two groups, one group whose trading contain strong predictive power of the future returns of the firms stock and one group whose trading contain as little predictive power as possible.

Methodology: An event study based on the market model is {{used to determine the}} abnormal returns of the <b>insiders.</b> The abnormal returns of the two groups of <b>insiders</b> are compared using an independent samples t-test and a Mann-Whitney test. Theoretical framework: The theoretical framework is based on previous research in addition to the efficient market and the signaling hypotheses. Conclusions: It is found that buy transactions by <b>insiders</b> defined as opportunistic are associated with higher abnormal return than buy transactions by <b>insiders</b> classified as routine during the longer term event windows. It is also found that buy transactions by <b>insiders</b> defined as opportunistic are associate...|$|R

40|$|In this study, we {{investigate}} the trading patterns of corporate <b>insiders</b> around the announcement dates of shareholder class action lawsuits and related settlements. In particular, we explore whether these trading patterns {{are indicative of}} information asymmetries between managing and non-managing <b>insiders.</b> We provide evidence that litigation and settlement announcements {{have a significant impact}} on the stock prices of sued firms, and that foreknowledge of these events may be used by <b>insiders</b> to earn abnormal profits. We assess both actual and proposed trades by <b>insiders</b> in sued firms to detect abnormal trading activity prior to these events. Our results provide strong evidence of abnormal trading activity by <b>insiders</b> of sued firms prior to these announcements. The direction of their trades suggests the presence of informed trading prior to both litigation and settlement announcements. Moreover, we observe that managers exhibit higher abnormal trading activity than non-managing <b>insiders</b> prior to litigation and settlement announcements...|$|R
40|$|This thesis explores whether {{corporate}} <b>insiders</b> exhibit trading {{patterns that}} would suggest that they exploit any potential information advantages they may have over other market participants. Furthermore, we consider information asymmetries between different types of <b>insiders</b> by comparing abnormal net sales between managers and non-managing <b>insiders,</b> between top-level managers and low-level managers, and between financial managers and non-financial managers. We show that managers have higher abnormal net sales than non-managing <b>insiders,</b> and that top-level managers have higher abnormal net sales than low-level managers prior to lawsuit announcements. We find a significant negative correlation between abnormal stock returns and abnormal net sales by managers and by top-level managers. Our evidence suggests that managers may engage in net selling {{in anticipation of the}} negative stock returns that are typically associated with securities class action announcements. In particular, high-rank <b>insiders</b> appear to place more profitable trades than low-rank <b>insiders</b> prior to lawsuit announcements...|$|R

The 53-count, 65-page {{indictment}} covers {{a broad range of}} financial crimes, including bank fraud, making false statements to banks and auditors, securities fraud, wire fraud, money laundering, conspiracy, and <b>insider</b> trading. United States District Judge Sim Lake had previously denied motions by the defendants to have separate trials and to relocate the case out of Houston, where the defendants argued the negative publicity concerning Enron's demise would make it impossible to get a fair trial. On May 25, 2006, the jury in the Lay and Skilling trial returned its verdicts. Skilling was convicted of 19 of 28 counts of securities fraud and wire fraud and acquitted on the remaining nine, including charges of <b>insider</b> trading. He was sentenced to 24 years and 4 months in prison. In 2013 the United States Department of Justice reached a deal with Skilling, which resulted in ten years being cut from his sentence.|$|E
40|$|We posit that placing <b>insiders</b> on {{the board}} {{facilitates}} information flows to outside directors, mitigates the CEO's role as information gatekeeper, and allows managers to be more independent of the CEO.

Further tests indicate {{that the percentage of}} <b>insiders</b> is associated with lower CEO pay, lower CEO influence, and higher use of accounting-based performance measures. However, these counterbalancing effects are diminishing in the number of <b>insiders</b> {{on the board}}.
