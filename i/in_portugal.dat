5|$|According to the UK Government review, the Burns Inquiry (published in 2000), hare {{coursing}} {{was taking place}} in Pakistan, Portugal and Spain. Pakistan has officially prohibited the use of dogs or hawks for coursing unless a special licence is issued for carrying out such activity although, according to some reports, {{hare coursing}} is still practised and popular. Hare coursing <b>in</b> <b>Portugal</b> is run in both forms: open (Prova de Galgos a Campo), and closed (park) coursing where it is known as lebre a corricão. Hare coursing <b>in</b> <b>Portugal</b> may only be legally undertaken with two dogs and operates under the same ethos as coursing in the United States. In Spain, the hare coursing is open coursing, and the areas where the activity takes place includes the Medinrua area. Coursing has long been undertaken in Spain, where Spanish galgos rather than greyhounds are used. These dogs have a precarious life after their coursing careers, with World Animal Protection suggesting that many tens of thousands die cruelly each year. Hare coursing also takes place in Russia but is illegal in most European countries and in Australia, where it {{had a long history}} from 1867 until it was banned in 1985 following a long decline in popularity.|$|E
