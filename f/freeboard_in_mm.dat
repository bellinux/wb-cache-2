50|$|After {{developing}} the <b>freeboard</b> <b>in</b> 1996, Strand released two models under the Freebord brand in 1998; the FB-112 and the FB-110. The company patented designs {{relating to the}} Freebord brand freeboards. Though other companies have since developed their own freeboards and marketed them under alternate brand names, Freebord {{remains one of the}} largest producers of <b>freeboards</b> <b>in</b> the world. By 2000, the company had sold 4000 boards. In 2005, the company signed deals to have their product distributed to snowboarding enthusiasts in Europe The company continues to produce and market freeboards under the Freebord trademark.|$|R

5000|$|Specific {{activities}} that FEMA cited were:"...acquisition {{of nearly a}} thousand flood-prone properties and the preservation {{of more than a}} quarter of its floodplain as open space; strong building codes, including the requirement of a two-foot safety factor (<b>freeboard)</b> <b>in</b> floodplain construction; and community outreach to advise residents of flood hazards and offer mitigation solutions and technical assistance." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{contrast}} to the DUKW, the GPA did not perform well in the field. At some 1,600 kg (3,520 lbs) the production truck had become much heavier than the original 1,200 kg (2,640 lbs) specified in the design brief, but its volume had not been increased accordingly. As a consequence, a low <b>freeboard</b> <b>in</b> the water meant that the GPA could not handle more than a light chop or carry much cargo. The GPA's intended use of ferrying troops and cargo from ships off-shore, over a beach and continuing inland, was therefore very limited.|$|R

50|$|A {{few other}} boats that Ricus van de Stadt {{designed}} are the Efsix, Stern (One Design dinghy class), Spanker (the name {{was used for}} both '19' and '42' -feet loa- designs), Randmeer and Wibo. From the open-decked Randmeer was to follow the Trotter the next year (in 1963; with a small cabin), and the Trotter-Pandora in 1967 (with more <b>freeboard).</b> <b>In</b> turn, this was to evolve to the Pandora (Mk1) in 1968, the Pandora International in 1973 and the Pandora 700 in 1976. The Prospect 900 was designed circa 1975, and many other yacht designs began on his drawing board. Key to the designs of Van de Stadt are their daring design, simplicity and good sailing.|$|R

50|$|The {{pressure}} hull of a submarine is usually cylindrical and possesses a low <b>freeboard</b> when <b>in</b> the water, which makes {{walking on the}} hull when on the surface dangerous in high seas or rough weather. The casing provides a flat and therefore safer platform for personnel to walk on.|$|R
25|$|Watertight {{subdivision}} limits loss of buoyancy and <b>freeboard</b> <b>in</b> {{the event}} of damage, and may protect vital machinery from flooding. Most ships have some pumping capacity to remove accumulated water from the bilges, but a steel ship with no watertight subdivision will sink if water accumulates faster than pumps can remove it. Standards of watertight subdivision assume no dewatering capability, although pumps kept in working order may provide an additional measure of safety in {{the event of}} minor leaks. The most common watertight subdivision is accomplished with transverse bulkheads dividing the elongated hull into a number of watertight floodable lengths. Early watertight subdivision tested with hoses sometimes failed to withstand the hydrostatic pressure of an adjoining flooded compartment. Effective watertight subdivision requires these transverse bulkheads to be both watertight and structurally sound.|$|R
30|$|This {{paper is}} {{structured}} as follows. In Section  2 we motivate {{the development of}} a computational fluid dynamics model for the kiln. In Section  3 we give details of this model’s operational setup and geometry, the polyhedral mesh discretizing the spatial coordinates and the partial differential equations governing the gas flow in the oven, the combustion of hydrocarbon fuel in the burner, the reactions of the chemical species and the radiative heat transfer <b>in</b> the <b>freeboard.</b> <b>In</b> Section  4 we present numerical results that convincingly show that our model allows to localize and counteract the ring formation by increasing the amount of air through the secondary air inlet. In Section  5 finally we report on an experimental validation at the plant that confirms the effectiveness of the change in operating conditions that we propose.|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{radiation}} heat transfer {{in a system}} of large numbers of surface elements was considered. A numerical-mathematical model detailing the radiative exchange between surfaces in a generalised multiple-surface shape model was constructed, developed, and tested to a satisfactory degree of complexity, at which point it was incorporated into a general-purpose computer program. Predictions by the model were compared to selected results from pilot-scale DC arc furnace tests run at Mintek, to evaluate the significance of radiation heat transfer to the overall energy loss from the freeboard regions of such furnaces. Finally, the model was used to examine a range of process and design variables, and scale-up issues. Several interesting aspects and phenomena come out of the exhaustive modelling work, to hopefully aid the designer of DC arc furnace <b>freeboards</b> <b>in</b> the future on both the pilot and full industrial scale...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, the {{temperature}} profile while firing rice husk in a fluidized bed combustor was investigated. The experiment {{was carried out}} <b>in</b> a 210 <b>mm</b> I. D. non insulated fluidized bed combustor with a height of 2000 mm. The experiments were carried out in two sets; firstly without any secondary burner and secondly with one and two secondary burners <b>in</b> the <b>freeboard</b> region {{and its effect on}} temperature was studied. The results without any secondary burner showed that {{the temperature}} reduces sharply along the height of the combustor with fluctuation <b>in</b> <b>freeboard</b> temperature. The reason was heat loss to surrounding due to non insulation of the fluidized bed combustor and run off flue gas. However, improvement or almost steady freeboard temperature profile was observed with addition of one and two secondary burners <b>in</b> the <b>freeboard</b> region. <b>In</b> addition to this, the high temperature (around 700 Â°C) could help in burning off the carbon in the rice husk ash during elutriation from fluidized bed. Hence, freeboard region could be made as secondary combustion zone in obtaining high quality white siliceous ash...|$|R

50|$|A heavily {{armoured}} citadel 75 ft {{wide and}} 110 ft long was located amidships, which {{would keep the}} ship afloat and stable regardless {{of what happened to}} the ends. This citadel contained the main guns, the boilers and the engines.The ends were unarmoured, but with a 3 in armoured deck 6-8 ft below the waterline to limit damage to the underwater section to keep them buoyant. Coal bunkers were located over the armoured deck and surrounded by 4 ft compartments filled with cork. The ship had bunker capacity for 400 tons of coal below the deck for use during combat, when the above-deck bunkers would be inaccessible and possibly flooded. The structure above the armoured deck also contained a large number of watertight compartments to further preserve buoyancy. There was also light superstructure to provide crew accommodation, and <b>freeboard</b> <b>in</b> rough weather, although anticipated to be seriously damaged in any major engagement.|$|R
50|$|In the Pacific Islands, dugout canoes {{are very}} large, made from whole mature trees and fitted with {{outriggers}} for increased {{stability in the}} ocean, and were once used for long-distance travel. Such are the very large waka used by Māori who came to New Zealand probably from East Polynesia, about 1280. Such vessels carried 40 to 80 warriors in calm sheltered coastal waters or rivers. It is believed that trans-ocean voyages were made in Polynesian catamarans and one hull, carbon-dated to about 1400, was found in New Zealand in 2011. In New Zealand smaller waka were made from a single log, often Totara, because of its lightness, strength and resistance to rotting. Larger waka were made of about seven parts lashed together with flax rope. All waka are characterized by very low <b>freeboard.</b> <b>In</b> Hawaii, waa (canoes) are traditionally manufactured from {{the trunk of the}} koa tree. They typically carry a crew of six: one steersman and five paddlers.|$|R
50|$|Modifications to the Sherman {{included}} the sealing {{of the lower}} hull, {{the addition of the}} propeller drive and the addition of Straussler's flotation screen around the hull, together with its inflation system. The base of the canvas flotation screen was attached to a horizontal mild steel boat-shaped platform welded to the tank's hull. The screen was supported by horizontal metal hoops and by 36 vertical rubber tubes. A system of compressed air bottles and pipes inflated the rubber tubes to give the curtain rigidity. The screen could be erected in 15 minutes and quickly collapsed once the tank reached the shore. In practice there was about 3 ft of <b>freeboard.</b> <b>In</b> combat, the flotation system was considered expendable and it was assumed the tank crew would remove and discard it as soon as conditions allowed. In practice, some units kept the flotation equipment and their tanks were used in several amphibious operations.|$|R
50|$|The Stevens {{brothers}} {{succeeded in}} getting Congress to overrule Bancroft and Skinner, and set about radically redesigning the Stevens Battery. The new design was ready by January 1854. It called for a great increase in the ship's size and capabilities. She was now to be 420 feet (128 m) long, 53 feet (16 m) in beam, and displace 4,683 tons. She was to be proof against 125-pound (56.7-kilogram) shells, with armor made up of 6.75-inch (171-millimeter) iron plates sloping upwards from 1 foot (0.3 m) below the waterline to the main deck and running along the entire {{side of the ship}} from stem to stern. She was to have bulwarks to make her more seaworthy when steaming which could be lowered to reduce her <b>freeboard</b> <b>in</b> combat, making her a smaller target. Again, the ship was to be semisubmersible, able to submerge herself down to the gunwales, also to make her a smaller target.|$|R
5000|$|Since the {{accident}} several {{improvements to the}} design of this type of vessel have been made. These include indicators that display the state of the bow doors on the bridge, watertight ramps being fitted to the bow sections of the front of the ship, and [...] "freeing flaps" [...] to allow water to escape from a vehicle deck in the event of flooding. The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea regulations were changed in 1990 to require 125 cm of <b>freeboard</b> (<b>in</b> the case of RORO vessels, defined as the height between the vehicle deck and the water line) for all new ROROs, instead of the previous 76 cm. Some vessels omit the bow door configuration altogether and vehicles enter and exit from rear doors only. New International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulations are in place that prohibit an open (undivided) deck of this length on a passenger RORO vessel.|$|R
