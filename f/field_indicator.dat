In order to protect wetlands from degradation, the determination of wetland hydrology, hydrophytic vegetation, and hydric soils is necessary. Soils formed from serpentine parent material on hillside slump blocks do not meet any of the current morphological Field Indicators of Hydric Soils. Although these areas seem to be wetlands based on wetland hydrology and hydrophytic vegetation, there is no approved hydric soil indicator that includes the properties exhibited by serpentinitic soils on these landscapes. The objectives of this research were: (1) to examine soil chemical, physical, and morphological properties {{to determine if they}} meet the criteria for hydric soils; and (2) to develop a new test <b>Field</b> <b>Indicator</b> of Hydric Soil for use in soils formed in serpentinitic parent materials along the Central Coast of California. Two research sites in Poly Canyon, north of California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo, were instrumented with Indicator of Reduction in Soil (IRIS) tubes over a three month period to measure the amount of Fe reduction in the soil profiles to a depth of 50 cm. The results of the IRIS tube analyses displayed anaerobic conditions persisting for longer than 14 days during the growing season; therefore, these soils are in fact hydric. The development of a new test <b>Field</b> <b>Indicator</b> of Hydric Soil is necessary. Preliminarily, the following is proposed as a new test indicator: soils formed in serpentine parent material occurring on a slump block landforms with a layer at least 10 cm (4 in) thick, no chroma color with a value of 2 or less, and few or less concentrations.

It has long been recognized that online accessible and low-cost raster data sets (e. g. Landsat imagery, SRTM-DEM’s) provide a readily available basis for land resource assessments for developing countries. However, choice of spatial, tempo-ral and spectral resolution of such data is often limited. Furthermore, while local expert knowl-edge on land degradation processes is abundant, difficulties are often encountered when linking existing knowledge with modern approaches including GIS and RS. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop an easily applicable, standardized workflow for preliminary spatial assessments of land degradation and conservation, which also allows the integration of existing expert knowledge. The core of the developed method consists of a workflow for rule-based land resource assess-ment. In a systematic way, this workflow leads from predefined land degradation and conserva-tion classes to <b>field</b> <b>indicators,</b> to suitable spatial proxy data, and finally to a set of rules for clas-sification of spatial datasets.

However, its use as a flow <b>field</b> <b>indicator</b> using a light coil shaped body is a recent application developed by the author of this paper. The paper contributes to bring ahead this concept by a parametrical experimental analysis aimed at assessing the relationship among three of the parameters that mainly influence the whole process: the angular velocity of the coil as a dependent variable; the number of turns in the coil as the first independent variable and the weight of the coil as the second independent variable. A suitable apparatus was realized. The tests performed showed that, apart from a very few cases, an increase in the number of turns produces an increase in the angular velocity of the coil. A particular behaviour is observed for the weight of the coil: an increase in weight augments the angular velocity for small values, while for larger values the trend is opposite. Some considerations about the rotational stability can explain the entire concept, although further research will help deepen our knowledge of the process for wider parametrical ranges...|$|E

In 2007, GSLA and the Utah Reclamation, Mitigation and Conservation Commission (URMCC) re-aligned Little Willow Creek through {{a portion of}} the reserve. Little Willow Creek primarily receives streamflow from the Wasatch Mountains and urban stormwater runoff. Restoration activities conducted since 1998 include salt cedar and Russian olive eradication, willow and cottonwood plantings, and upland shrub plantings. In 2011, Allison Jones, Chris Cline, and the GSLA restoration team conducted a baseline stream/riparian function survey with the Rapid StreamRiparian Assessment Protocol (RSRA) along Little Willow Creek to assess channel and riparian conditions four years post construction. During mid- 2013 through 2015, beaver were welcomed on the reserve by GSLA and the new Reserve Manger Karri Smith. Additionally, beginning in December 2013, large-scale restoration planting, seeding, and weed control activities were implemented to bring restoration of the entire 130 -acre reserve to completion. In 2015 Little Willow Creek was resurveyed using RSRA. This reassessment of the 2011 baseline stream reach detected significant in-stream channel conditioFlan and riparian and wetland habitat improvement. Overall improvements include: decreased non-native tree cover, increased channel shading, increased floodplain connectivity (at bank full), improved vertical bank stability, increased hydraulic habitat diversity, increased under bank cover, and increased shrub cover, mid-canopy cover/patch density, riparian tree demography/recruitment, and fluvial habitat diversity.

40|$|International audienceSulphur (S) {{is one of}} the six main macroelements {{required}} to sustain the growth of plants. Sources include soil, fertilizer and atmospheric deposition, which has been reduced by 85 % over the last three decades. Risks of S deficiencies are now recognized in high S-demanding species such as Brassica napus L. With the aims of evaluating the risk of excessive or insufficient fertilization and identifying robust relationships that may be used as plant S status indicators, 57 commercial crops of oilseed rape were selected among contrasting soils and along a rainfall gradient that may affect soil S availability. Cultivation practices were investigated and the S and nitrogen (N) concentrations of soil, senescing leaves, stems and seeds were analysed. Despite an excessive organic N supply and large variation in S supply (from 0 to 112 kg S/ha), principal component analysis using 43 parameters indicated that seed yield was poorly related to N and S fertilization rates. While the N and protein-N concentrations in seeds were inversely related to oil and glucosinolate concentrations, they were linked to S and sulphate (SO 42 -) accumulation in the seeds. Sulphate concentrations in senescing leaves, stems or seeds could be deduced from total S concentrations, as they were positively and highly correlated. Sulphate accounted for on average 0 69 of total S in senescing leaves with minimum and maximumvalues of 0 007 and 0 94, which revealed conditions of limited and excess supply of S, respectively. This high variation of SO 42 - concentration in leaves can be interpreted as the result of its mobilization triggered by S deficiency, but cannot be used alone as an indicator of plant S status. A comparison with plants grown in controlled conditions under different S supplies suggests that the intensity of S starvation affects N metabolism, leading to NO 3 -(nitrate) accumulation. It is further suggested that dual evaluation of SO 42 - and NO 3 - concentrations in senescing leaves could be used at the vegetative stage as a <b>field</b> <b>indicator</b> to adjust S fertilization...|$|E
40|$|Because many natural {{wetlands}} {{function as}} ground water filters in the landscape, wetlands are now protected. Wetlands must have hydric soils, hydrophytic vegetation, and high water tables. We characterized the hydrology and morphology of a soil toposequence that developed on dune and sand plain landscapes in Northwest Indiana {{as part of}} the Wet Soil Monitoring Project of Indiana. Soils on low parts of the landscape have hydric morphology, periodically high water tables, redox depletions (gray colors), and supported hydrophytic vegetation. Soils on dunes have deep water tables, lack redox depletions and concentrations, and have upland vegetation. The depth at which soil colors with chroma ≤ 2 occurred was related to the depth at which the soil was saturated for 5 % of the time during the duration of the study, except for the somewhat poorly drained Morocco soil on dune footslope positions, probably because it lacked sufficient free Fe. Water tables are not flat. They are higher under low-lying sand plain than under dunes in winter and early spring, and higher under dunes in the fall. Field studies of soil hydrology prompted a search for a <b>field</b> <b>indicator</b> that, in a simple and straightforward manner, could indicate the level of reduction and anaerobesis a soil had undergone after a period of saturation. We coated polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tubes with the reddish iron oxide ferrihydrite and called it Indicator of Reduction in Soils (IRIS). When an IRIS device is placed in a saturated soil, and the soil becomes anaerobic, the Fe in the reddish oxide is reduced and dissolved, and the white PVC tube is exposed. IRIS tubes installed in various soils in Indiana, North Dakota, and Minnesota visually changed when the soil was saturated and reduced for a time. These changes correlated with other measurements such as depth and duration of water table, Eh measured with platinum electrodes, soil temperature, soil pH, and soil morphology. ...|$|E

The authors linked soil–landscape features to the main soil and water processes oper-ating within the landscape. In Australia, they used this information to develop a set of <b>field</b> <b>indicators</b> (e. g. soil colour) within a user-friendly soil classification key that was linked to land-use options to form the basis of a manual. Information written in this format helped farmers and regional advisers to identify options for remedia-tion of waterlogged and saline areas and to improve planning at property and catchment scales. The authors identified a series of steps to be taken in producing the manual. Steps 1 to 5 describe the soil layers and construct them in toposequences, which are then used to map soil types in key surrounding areas.

40|$|Graduation date: 2001 Two {{types of}} {{temporary}} poois, known as playas, occur in semiarid southeast Oregon. Vegetated upland playas {{are found in}} the High Lava Plain province; barren alkaline-saline playas {{are found in the}} Basin and Range province. Both types become ponded in most years, but they often lack redoximorphic features indicative of hydric soils. We studied the morphology, hydrology, temperature, chemistry, redox potentials, and vegetation in one pool of each type to elucidate processes of soil genesis, to determine if the soils are hydric soils, and to evaluate relevant field indicators of hydric soils. We collected data for 3 years from piezometers, Pt electrodes, and thermocouples installed at several depths at monitoring sites within and around the pools. Chemical and physical parameters of soil and water samples were analyzed. Plant species were identified and their cover estimated. The upland playa was ponded annually but never exhibited subsurface saturation. Its soils were hydric, meeting the hydric criteria for hydrology, redox potential, and temperature. Redox potentials indicated an anaerobic soil environment, but they were never low enough to significantly reduce iron. Depleted matrices and soft Fe-Mn concentrations were present; soft concentrations were too small and inconspicuous to meet the criteria of any current hydric indicators. We propose new indicators based on observed morphological features. Vegetation, soils, and hydrology at this site indicate great similarity with vernal pools in northern California. The pool meets all criteria for classification as a jurisdictional wetland. Effects of current management on the ecology of these pools is not known. The alkaline-saline playa was ponded annually and also saturated at depth. Its soils were hydric, but low soil organic carbon content, low soil Fe-Mn content, high pH, and redox potentials above the thresholds for Fe and Mn reduction suppress formation of hydric soil morphological indicators. Fe-Mn nodules, found throughout the profile, are probably not formed by redox processes.

If stress observations near the bottom of the pilot hole are representative of stresses acting at greater depth, then they are consistent with regional stress <b>field</b> <b>indicators</b> and an anomalously weak San Andreas Fault in an otherwise strong crust...|$|R
30|$|Urban {{flooding}} problems {{fall under}} both {{climate change and}} disaster risk science, and involve various professionals, such as urban planners, engineers, architects, economists, and ecologists. The vast and intricate dynamics of flooding need comprehensive vulnerability assessment, which should incorporate the multifarious factors that affect the complexities in urban areas. The index-based approach {{of this study was}} developed for assessing five dimensions of vulnerability—social, economic, physical/infrastructural, institutional, and attitudinal vulnerability. Indicators were chosen through extensive literature review for each dimension of vulnerability. These indicators were chosen from empirical studies from the disaster risk science and climate change <b>fields.</b> <b>Indicators</b> were scrutinized with a view to local conditions and adjusted accordingly. Seven indicators each were used for social, institutional, and attitudinal vulnerability; 10 indicators for economic vulnerability; and 13 indicators for physical/infrastructural vulnerability. The five dimensions are given equal importance, as all three cities experience flood hazards primarily because of nullahs and rivers. Therefore, an average was calculated for all dimensions, which helped in devising the multidimensional vulnerability index.|$|R
40|$|Improvements in {{agricultural}} productivity usually are counterproductive to maintaining or enhancing indigenous biodiversity. Habitat loss, the main factor associated with biodiversity decline, increases with intensive, perma-nent, large-area cropping systems. Biodiversity {{continues to be}} reduced glob-ally, partly because it is consistently undervalued {{and partly because of}} the lack of sufficient incentives for its retention and maintenance (unep/cbd 2002). Major contributing factors are the extraordinarily high biotic complexity in tropical forested lands and difficulties in devising and implementing cost-efficient methods for biodiversity survey and evaluation. Few published data demonstrate significant links between biodiversity and ecosystem dynamics in a way that can be used to attach a meaningful value to biodiversity or to provide related landscape-based indicators of profitability.
