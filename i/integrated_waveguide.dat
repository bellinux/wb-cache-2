50|$|Transitions between {{conductive}} {{lines and}} dielectric lines or waveguides are more complex. In these cases {{a change of}} mode is required. Transitions of this sort consist of forming some kind of antenna in one format {{that acts as a}} launcher into the new format.

For wireless devices, transitions to the external antennae are also required.|$|E
50|$|A post-wall {{waveguide}} (also {{known as}} substrate <b>integrated</b> <b>waveguide</b> (SIW) or a laminated waveguide) is a synthetic rectangular electromagnetic waveguide formed in a dielectric substrate by densely arraying metallized posts or via-holes which connect {{the upper and}} lower metal plates of the substrate.

50|$|While {{optical fibers}} {{have been the}} {{workhorse}} of supercontinuum generation since its inception, <b>integrated</b> <b>waveguide</b> based sources of supercontinuum have become an active area {{of research in the}} twenty first century. These chip-scale platforms promise to miniaturize supercontinuum sources into devices that are compact, robust, scalable, mass producible and more economical. Such platforms also allow dispersion engineering by varying the cross-sectional geometry of the waveguide. Silicon bases materials such as silica, silicon nitride, crystalline and amorphous silicon have demonstrated supercontinuum generation spanning the visible, near-infrared and mid-infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. As of 2015, the widest supercontinuum generated on chip extends from 470 nm in the visible to 2130 nm for the infrared wavelength region.|$|E
50|$|Substrate <b>integrated</b> <b>waveguide</b> (SIW), {{also called}} {{laminated}} waveguide or post-wall waveguide, is a waveguide {{formed in the}} substrate dielectric by constraining the wave between two rows of posts or plated through holes and ground planes {{above and below the}} substrate. The dominant mode is a quasi-TE mode. SIW is intended as a cheaper alternative to hollow metal waveguide while retaining many of its benefits. The greatest benefit is that, as an effectively enclosed waveguide, it has considerably less radiation losses than microstrip. There is no unwanted coupling of stray fields to other circuit components. SIW also has high Q and high power handling. Additionally, as a planar technology, SIW is easier to integrate with other components.|$|E

50|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} forms of planar transmission line. The main ones are stripline, microstrip, suspended stripline, and coplanar waveguide*. Stripline was the earliest form, conceived during World War II by Robert M. Barrett. All four of these forms consist {{of a pair of}} conductors (although in three of them, the return conductor is through the ground plane). Consequently, they have a dominant mode of transmission (the field pattern of the electromagnetic wave) that is identical, or near-identical, to the mode found in a pair of wires. Other planar formats, such as slotline, finline, and imageline transmit along a strip of dielectric and substrate <b>integrated</b> <b>waveguide</b> forms a dielectric waveguide within the substrate with rows of posts. These formats cannot support the same mode as a pair of wires, and consequently they have different transmission properties. Many forms have a narrower bandwidth and in general they produce more signal distortion. However, advantages include (depending on exact formats being compared) low loss and a better range of characteristic impedance.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Microcantilever sensors {{have been}} {{recognized}} as a promising sensor platform for various chemical and biological applications. One of their major limitations is that the measurement of cantilever displacement typically involves elaborate off-chip setups with free-space optics. An improved device, known as the optical cantilever, has been proposed recently to eliminate the external optics. The response of the optical cantilever is measured on-chip through <b>integrated</b> <b>waveguides.</b> However, this method has been previously demonstrated only for devices operating in air, whereas most chemical and biological samples are in solution state. We present the first optical cantilever capable of operation in liquid. We test it with the detection of homocysteine with a minimal concentration of 10 M. The minimal measurable cantilever displacement and surface stress are 5 nm and 1 mN/m, respectively. The presented device {{will be used in}} studies of a homocysteine-producing bacterial pathway for the purpose of drug discovery.
