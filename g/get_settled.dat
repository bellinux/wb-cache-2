25|$|Iqbal's first ODI {{was against}} Sri Lanka, {{a game in}} which the whole Pakistani batting line-up capitulated. He showed that he {{preferred}} to take his time to <b>get</b> <b>settled</b> {{in the middle of the}} pitch. Because of that, the selectors chose to give him his first Test match start soon after. He started his International test career during Pakistan's tour of New Zealand where he played multiple strong innings in which he displayed his range of strokes and the ability to play off some hostile bowling. Iqbal was a prolific junior-level scorer. He played two Tests in South Africa in 2003–04 but was dropped after not performing well. Upon returning to Test cricket after a two-year hiatus, he scored his maiden Test century against India to help Pakistan win the 2005–06 Test series in the final Test in Karachi. He proved his doubters wrong by playing some solid innings especially an impressive innings against Australia which turned out to be in vain as it did not prevent a loss. He continued on for a few more tours but was ultimately dropped due to a lean period where he did not contribute significantly with the bat. He continued to play domestic cricket though and was recalled to the side after injuries hit some of the other players.|$|E
500|$|Carson {{returned}} to Liverpool {{at the end}} of the 2007–08 season but in July 2008 joined West Bromwich Albion on a four-year contract for a £3.25million fee, possibly rising to £3.75million, with an option for the club to extend the contract by another year. Carson, who had played for five different clubs since making his debut for Leeds in 2004, explained that he wanted to <b>get</b> <b>settled</b> at one club, saying [...] "I've been like a nomad for three or four years. It'll be good to get some roots and hopefully settle. I can see myself here for four or five years, even longer." [...] He made his debut in a 1–0 defeat to Arsenal in the opening match of the 2008–09 Premier League season. Despite relegation to the Championship Carson kept his first team place and after the departure of captain Jonathan Greening he was given the captaincy. West Bromwich Albion won promotion back to the Premier League, finishing second, 12 points clear of third place Nottingham Forest with Carson keeping 15 clean sheets out of 43 matches. He had been playing regular football for the Midlands club, but in the 2010–11 season, his form seemed to dip and in January 2011, Carson was briefly dropped to the bench for Welsh goalkeeper Boaz Myhill. After the appointment of Roy Hodgson as West Bromwich Albion head coach, he swiftly found himself back in favour at The Hawthorns.|$|E
2500|$|Formed in 1998, 40 Below Summer {{had made}} a name for {{themselves}} by performing heavily across their native New Jersey and New York. In late 2000, the band's self-released CD Side Show Freaks found its way to No Name Management (known for acts such as Slipknot and Mudvayne). After partnering with No Name, numerous record label showcases on both coasts followed, with up to fifteen prominent labels showing interest in the band. They eventually signed with Warner Music Group's London-Sire. In March 2001, 40 Below Summer travelled to Los Angeles to commence recording their major label debut with famed heavy metal producer GGGarth (Rage Against the Machine, Mudvayne, Kittie). Lead guitarist Jordan Plingos recalled [...] "I think the first thing that we clicked with Garth about was that he was relaxed. He wasn't like, 'let's go, guys, let's go!' He was more like, 'get comfortable, <b>get</b> <b>settled</b> in.' His whole thing is bringing out the best in you, so pressuring you to do something doesn't help. He was all about us, which was amazing", while vocalist Max Illidge said [...] "He’s a lot of fun. He’s crazy too. Definitely a crazy little fucker, but he’s a lot of fun and a very talented guy. He definitely helped unlock some doors inside of me." ...|$|E

2500|$|After she {{had arrived}} in the United States in 1989 with Panait, Comăneci stated, [...] "Constantin told me that I was going to live with his wife and {{children}} for a bit. I never questioned him." [...] Her arrival initially generated some negative press, however, {{as a result of the}} media's misrepresentation of her relationship with Panait. Comăneci later stated in her memoir that her response of [...] "so what?" [...] to a reporter's comment that Panait was married was due to her poor command of the English language at the time:Constantin had offered to help me defect, and I'd accepted. I assumed that his wife knew that he was going to help a handful of Romanians get out of the country and that I was one of them. But what people took from my answer was that I was a home-wrecker. Nothing could have been further from the truth. In hindsight, I understand that I'd made a very poor choice of words. Constantin had plans to become my personal manager upon our arrival in the United States. I didn't know that, but he promised to help me <b>get</b> <b>settled,</b> and I guess I just accepted his involvement in my future career as fair payment for the risks he'd taken. People died every day trying to defect.|$|E

50|$|The mass {{migration}} to Canada from Europe in the 1860s and 1870s increased {{the importance of}} the Society’s charitable mission of helping needy immigrants. Many immigrants arriving in Montreal had no material means to support themselves, as they presumed the Canadian government would support them in <b>getting</b> <b>settled</b> in the country. As this was not the case, the Society {{played an important role in}} helping German immigrants with their immediate needs upon arrival in the Port of Montreal. The Society assisted immigrants in <b>getting</b> <b>settled</b> in Montreal, by supporting them with aid, and the finding of employment and housing. Good relationships with different shipping and railway companies allows the Society to negotiate fare discounts for Germans wishing to travel further west. During and after the Franco-Prussian War (which also contributed to the large flow of migrants to North America) the German Society's relief efforts were also directed to Germany to support widows and orphans.|$|R
