In a photomultiplier tube, every photon striking the photocathode initiates an avalanche of electrons that produces a detectable current pulse.

5|$|Oxidative {{phosphorylation}} {{works by}} using energy-releasing chemical reactions to drive energy-requiring reactions: The {{two sets of}} reactions {{are said to be}} coupled. This means one cannot occur without the other. The <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> through the electron transport chain, from electron donors such as NADH to electron acceptors such as oxygen, is an exergonic process– it releases energy, whereas the synthesis of ATP is an endergonic process, which requires an input of energy. Both the electron transport chain and the ATP synthase are embedded in a membrane, and energy is transferred from electron transport chain to the ATP synthase by movements of protons across this membrane, in a process called chemiosmosis. In practice, this is like a simple electric circuit, with a current of protons being driven from the negative N-side of the membrane to the positive P-side by the proton-pumping enzymes of the electron transport chain. These enzymes are like a battery, as they perform work to drive current through the circuit. The movement of protons creates an electrochemical gradient across the membrane, which is often called the proton-motive force. It has two components: a difference in proton concentration (a H+ gradient, ΔpH) and a difference in electric potential, with the N-side having a negative charge.|$|E

2500|$|At the {{opposite}} extreme, {{if one looks}} at the microscopic situation, one sees there are many ways of carrying an electric current, including: a <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> electrons; a <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>electron</b> [...] "holes" [...] that act like positive particles; and both negative and positive particles (ions or other charged particles) flowing in opposite directions in an electrolytic solution or a plasma.|$|R
25|$|The {{galvanic}} cell uses two different metal electrodes, each in an electrolyte where the positively charged ions are the oxidized {{form of the}} electrode metal. One electrode will undergo oxidation (the anode) and the other will undergo reduction (the cathode). The metal of the anode will oxidize, going from an oxidation state of 0 (in the solid form) to a positive oxidation state and become an ion. At the cathode, the metal ion in solution will accept one or more electrons from the cathode and the ion's oxidation state is reduced to 0. This forms a solid metal that electrodeposits on the cathode. The two electrodes must be electrically connected to each other, allowing for a <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> that leave the metal of the anode and flow through this connection to the ions at {{the surface of the}} cathode. This <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> is an electric current {{that can be used to}} do work, such as turn a motor or power a light.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Shockley {{worked on}} his magnum opus, Electrons and Holes in Semiconductors which was {{published}} as a 558-page treatise in 1950. The tome included Shockley's critical ideas of drift and diffusion and the differential equations that govern the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> in solid state crystals. Shockley's diode equation is also described. This seminal work became the reference text for other scientists working to develop and improve new variants of the transistor and other devices based on semiconductors.|$|E
25|$|A p–n {{junction}} diode {{is made of}} a crystal of semiconductor, usually silicon, but germanium and gallium arsenide are also used. Impurities are added to it to create a region on one side that contains negative charge carriers (electrons), called an n-type semiconductor, and a region {{on the other side}} that contains positive charge carriers (holes), called a p-type semiconductor. When the n-type and p-type materials are attached together, a momentary <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> occur from the n to the p side resulting in a third region between the two where no charge carriers are present. This region is called the depletion region because there are no charge carriers (neither electrons nor holes) in it. The diode's terminals are attached to the n-type and p-type regions. The boundary between these two regions, called a p–n junction, is where the action of the diode takes place. When a sufficiently higher electrical potential is applied to the P side (the anode) than to the N side (the cathode), it allows electrons to flow through the depletion region from the N-type side to the P-type side. The junction does not allow the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> in the opposite direction when the potential is applied in reverse, creating, in a sense, an electrical check valve.|$|E

25|$|Technology {{is often}} a {{consequence}} of science and engineering, although technology as a human activity precedes the two fields.

It has since permeated many disciplines including quantum chemistry, quantum electronics, quantum optics, and quantum information science. Its speculative modern developments include string theory and quantum gravity theories. It also provides a useful framework for many features of the modern periodic table of elements, and describes the behaviors of atoms during chemical bonding and the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> in computer semiconductors, and therefore plays a crucial role in many modern technologies.|$|E

2500|$|The FET {{controls}} the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> (or electron holes) {{from the source}} to drain by affecting {{the size and shape}} of a 'conductive channel' created and influenced by voltage (or lack of voltage) applied across the gate and source terminals.

2500|$|If a third {{electrode}} {{is inserted}} between the cathode and the anode (called a control grid), the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> between the cathode and anode can be regulated by varying the electric charge on this third electrode.

50|$|The flux of neutrinos at Earth {{is several}} ten billion per square {{centimetre}} per second, {{mostly from the}} Sun's core.

30|$|Subsequently, the {{optimization}} {{of reading}} operation is also investigated. The reading operation strongly {{relies on the}} BTBT between the P+ source and channel. During the reading “ 1 ”, Gate 1 mainly promotes the BTBT at the source side, whereas Gate 2 with the high voltage lowers the energy barrier which resists the <b>flowing</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> from the channel to drain. But during the reading “ 0 ”, {{it is necessary that}} Gate 2 with the small voltage be able to prevent electrons flowing from the channel to drain.

50|$|For {{electrical}} systems {{which use}} alternating current, the electrodes are the connections from the circuitry {{to the object}} to be acted upon by the electric current but are not designated anode or cathode because the direction <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> the <b>electrons</b> changes periodically, usually many times per second.|$|R
40|$|Ratchet is {{a device}} that {{produces}} direct current of particles when driven by an unbiased force.

We consider the tunneling <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> across a square potential barrier sandwiched by interface scattering potentials of unequal strengths on its either sides. It is found that while the intra-spin tunneling probabilities remain unchanged, the inter-spin-subband tunneling probabilities <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> crossing the barrier in one direction is unequal {{to that of the}} opposite direction. Hence, when the system is driven by an unbiased periodic force, a directional <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>electron</b> current is generated.

2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{vacuum tubes}} evolved from incandescent light bulbs, containing a filament sealed in an evacuated [...] glass envelope. When hot, the filament releases electrons into the vacuum, {{a process called}} thermionic emission, originally known as the [...] "Edison Effect". A second electrode, the anode or plate, will attract those electrons if it is at a more positive voltage. The result is a net <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> from the filament to plate. However, electrons cannot flow in the reverse direction because the plate is not heated and does not emit electrons. The filament (cathode) has a dual function: it emits electrons when heated; and, together with the plate, it creates an electric field due to the potential difference between them. Such a tube with only two electrodes is termed a diode, and is used for rectification. Since current can only pass in one direction, such a diode (or rectifier) will convert alternating current (AC) to pulsating DC. Diodes can therefore {{be used in a}} DC power supply, as a demodulator of amplitude modulated (AM) radio signals and for similar functions.|$|E
2500|$|A {{quiescent}} {{solar wind}} flowing past the Earth's magnetosphere steadily interacts {{with it and}} can both inject solar wind particles directly onto the geomagnetic field lines that are 'open', {{as opposed to being}} 'closed' in the opposite hemisphere, and provide diffusion through the bow shock. It can also cause particles already trapped in the radiation belts to precipitate into the atmosphere. Once particles are lost to the atmosphere from the radiation belts, under quiet conditions new ones replace them only slowly, and the loss-cone becomes depleted. In the magnetotail, however, particle trajectories seem constantly to reshuffle, probably when the particles cross the very weak magnetic field near the equator. As a result, the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> in that region is nearly the same in all directions ("isotropic"), and assures a steady supply of leaking electrons. The leakage of electrons does not leave the tail positively charged, because each leaked electron lost to the atmosphere is replaced by a low energy electron drawn upward from the ionosphere. Such replacement of [...] "hot" [...] electrons by [...] "cold" [...] ones is in complete accord with the 2nd law of thermodynamics. The complete process, which also generates an electric ring current around the Earth, is uncertain.|$|E

[...] To make the transistor conduct appreciable current (on {{the order of}} 1mA) from C to E, VBE must be above a minimum value {{sometimes referred to as}} the cut-in voltage. The cut-in voltage is usually about 650mV for silicon BJTs at room temperature but can be different {{depending on the type of}} transistor and its biasing. This applied voltage causes the lower P-N junction to 'turn on', allowing a <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> from the emitter into the base. In active mode, the electric field existing between base and collector (caused by VCE) will cause the majority of these electrons to cross the upper P-N junction into the collector to form the collector current IC. The remainder of the electrons recombine with holes, the majority carriers in the base, making a current through the base connection to form the base current, IB. As shown in the diagram, the emitter current, IE, is the total transistor current, which is the sum of the other terminal currents, (i.e., IE=IB+IC).|$|E

The increase of frequency results from the contribution of FEGC to the radial flow. The reason for the reduction of damping rate is that when the effect of FEGC counts, the new resonant velocity becomes much larger than ions thermal velocity with equilibrium distribution obeying Maxwellian distribution, compared with unmodified Landau resonant velocity. Especially, FEGC changes the characters of the frequency and damping rate of low-frequency GAM as functions of safety factor $q$...|$|R
