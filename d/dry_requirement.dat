40|$|Torrefaction is {{a thermal}} {{pre-treatment}} process for upgrading raw biomass {{into a more}} energy dense fuel. Torrefied biomass is combined with a densification process to increase its bulk density similar to conventional wood-pelleting production. This paper identifies the significant environmental impacts associated with production and delivery of these two fuels, using cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment. A feedstock of Scots Pine is modelled for a localised torrefaction/wood pellet plant located in Norway, with the products from each facility delivered to a power station in the UK. Results show that the relative benefits of torrefaction over wood-pellets are higher on per MJ delivered basis due to the higher calorific value of the fuel. The climate change and fossil depletion impacts for torrefied pellets modelled were lower than wood pellets, using an assumption that the <b>drying</b> <b>requirement</b> of the reactor was 3. 0. MJ/kg water removed for both cases. Sensitivity analysis of the model indicated that the relative impact improvement of the torrefied pellet case compared to wood pellets {{is strongly dependent on}} the biomass <b>drying</b> <b>requirement</b> and the proportion of total process heat supplied by the re-circulated torrefaction gas.

This paper designs and develops a resistive grain moisture on-line detector, which uses the least squares method for data calibration and stores the calibrated data in the STC 15 F 2 K 08 S 2 microcontroller. The grain moisture content is obtained by processing the collected grain resistance and grain temperature. When the grain moisture content exceeds the set value of grain moisture detector, the microcontroller will automatically control the opening of grain drying equipment so as to prevent the grain moisture content from being too high and causing mildew.

The effects were studied using a shear cell device and an extruder {{with emphasis on}} the added moisture content. Six diets were formulated: an SPC-based diet with 300 g SPC kg- 1, diets containing 100 and 200 g LPC kg- 1 or 100 and 200 g RPC kg- 1 and an FM-based diet with 450 g FM kg- 1. Each diet was extruded with an added moisture content of 29 %, 25 % and 22 % of the mash feed rate. It {{was found that the}} technological {{properties of}} LPC closely resemble FM, being high solubility, low water-holding capacity (WHC) and low paste viscosity. The LPC 100 and 200 g kg- 1 diets could be extruded at 22 % moisture, which gives an extrudate with reduced <b>drying</b> <b>requirements.</b> In addition, less specific mechanical energy was needed for extrusion. In contrast, both SPC and RPC have high WHC and paste viscosity. This explains the higher feed moisture required during extrusion. The properties of the feeds containing RPC could be well within the ranges acceptable for commercial fish feed use at even higher moisture content compared with SPC. The results of the extrusion trials confirmed the observations made from the shear cell device. Thus, the shear cell device can be used to study processing conditions that are close to extrusion conditions...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Corn stover {{equilibrium}} moisture isotherms {{were developed to}} aide biomass engineering of consistent, uniform-quality feedstock supplies for renewable bioenergy and bioproducts. Equilibrium moisture content (EMC) and equilibrium relative humidity (ERH) sorption data of corn leaf, stalk skin, and stalk pith were experimentally determined using the static gravimetric method at six temperatures ranging from 10 °C to 40 °C and at ten ERH values ranging from 0. 11 to 0. 98. The greatest EMC values for corn leaf and stalk pith generally corresponded with ERH below and above 0. 90, respectively, at all temperatures. Only at some intermediate ERH range at 20 °C to 40 °C was stalk skin EMC greater than stalk pith EMC. Corn stover components followed a type II isotherm typically observed among food materials. EMC of all components was proportional to ERH and inversely proportional to temperature. Observed EMC ranges were 3. 9 % to 56. 4 %, 3. 1 % to 41. 1 %, and 2. 7 % to 71. 5 % dry basis (d. b.) for corn leaf, stalk skin, and stalk pith, respectively. Calculated whole-stalk EMC values ranged from 3. 1 % to 49. 2 % d. b. Isotherm data were fitted with the EMC model of Henderson, and modified versions of Henderson, Chung-Pfost, Halsey, Oswin, and Guggenheim-Anderson-deBoer. The modified Oswin model (R 2 > 0. 98; F> 2085) followed by the modified Halsey model (R 2 > 0. 97; F> 1758) produced the best fit for corn stover components studied. The Henderson, modified Henderson, and modified Chung-Pfost models were not suitable since these models did not produce randomized residuals.

This research focusses on the energetic and environmental impact of processing microalgae into a renewable diesel. Two thermochemical bio-oil recovery processes are analyzed, pyrolysis and hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). System boundaries include microalgae growth, dewatering, thermochemical bio-oil recovery, bio-oil stabilization, conversion to renewable diesel, and transportation to the pump. Two system models were developed, a small-scale experimental and an industrial-scale. The small-scale system model is based on experimental data and literature. The industrial-scale system model leverages the small scale system model with scaling and optimization to represent an industrial-scaled process. The HTL and pyrolysis pathways were evaluated based on net energy ratio (NER), defined here as energy consumed over energy produced, and global warming potential (GWP). NER results for biofuel production through the industrial-scaled HTL pathway were determined to be 1. 23 with corresponding greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of - 11. 4 g CO 2 eq (MJ renewable diesel) - 1. Biofuel production through the industrial-scaled pyrolysis pathway gives a NER of 2. 27 and GHG emissions of 210 g CO 2 eq (MJ renewable diesel) - 1. For reference, conventional diesel has an NER of 0. 2 and GHG emissions of 18. 9 g CO 2 eq MJ- 1 with a similar system boundary. The large NER and GHG emissions associated with the pyrolysis pathway are attributed to feedstock <b>drying</b> <b>requirements</b> and combustion of co-products to improve system energetics.

Different grains have different <b>drying</b> <b>requirements,</b> and the grain drier team chose to design the drier for rice because of the worldwide economic importance of this staple food and {{also because of the}} challenges that drying rice presents. Rice loses much of its market value if it is exposed to large temperature changes while drying; therefore, a solar rice drier must be designed so as to try to level the temperature variations which naturally arise from the intermittency of the solar source. The design team committed itself early in the project to a hybrid concept, where solar energy is utilized in two ways: it is captured {open_quote}thermally{close_quote} in a rock-bed which acts {{at the same time as}} thermal storage and buffer, and it is converted {open_quote}directly{close_quote} in a small photovoltaic panel which generates electricity to power a small fan to circulate air through the rock-bed and the grain during daylight hours. At night, natural convection drives the air flow. The design of most of the system is flexible, in that the drier can be built with materials available at the intended site, with non-specialized labor. The team has purposely avoided any {open_quote}high tech{close_quote} solution which would increase the drier cost for third-world users. Therefore, the drier design does not incorporate selective surfaces or a vacuum, two common methods of enhancing solar thermal performance.

A challenge faced in the sunny region of Melanesia is the means to adequately preserve indigenous food sources such as C. indicum nuts. In this thesis the design and use of a solar dryer to provide a sustainable, low cost approach for drying C. indicum nuts in Port Vila, Vanuatu is demonstrated. A mixed mode, low-profile solar tunnel dryer typology, utilizing natural building materials where available, was selected to best fulfill the <b>drying</b> <b>requirements</b> for C. indicum nuts in the climatic and economic conditions of Vanuatu. This design incorporates a pre-heating area prior to the drying area, enabling higher internal temperatures to be achieved. DC powered fans, directly coupled to a small photovoltaic module, are used to generate forced convective airflow within the solar dryers. An equivalent electric circuit has been designed and validated for modelling the thermal performance of the solar tunnel dryer and predicting output temperatures of the pre-heater. Solar dryer prototypes were built in Port Vila, Vanuatu and Sydney, Australia for monitoring and performance testing under load and no-load conditions. Comparison of the simulation model and the prototype dryer showed good agreement in the temperature rise obtained between the ambient air temperature and the pre-heater outlet air temperature, which {{was found to be}} 9 &# 730;C {{during the middle of the}} day.

Adult worker honey bees consume 3.4-4.3mg of pollen per day to meet a <b>dry</b> matter <b>requirement</b> of 66-74% protein. The rearing of one larva requires 125-187.5mg pollen or 25-37.5mg protein for proper development.

Of these amino acids, honey bees require highest concentrations of leucine, isoleucine, and valine, however elevated concentrations of arginine and lysine are required for brood rearing. In addition to these amino acids, some B vitamins including biotin, folic acid, nicotinamide, riboflavin, thiamine, pantothenate, and most importantly, pyridoxine are required to rear larvae.

The jet fuel currently used by the United States Air Force requires an anti-icing additive because of the long range, high altitude aircraft now in use. When transporting this jet fuel by tanker, all water must be removed from the vessel's tanks since the additive is highly soluble in water. In his three years experience as a petroleum inspector, the author has observed that tankers lifting JP 4 are delayed approximately 12 hours per cargo at a cost of approximately $ 2, 000 per cargo because of this tank <b>drying</b> <b>requirement.</b> Upon assignment to the University of Kansas in the Navy sponsored Petroleum Management Post Graduate Program, the author undertook, as his thesis project, the development of a less costly method of loading JP 4, basing his study primarily upon laboratory tests but realizing that actual field tests would be required for conclusive results. Laboratory tests conducted indicate that the icing inhibitor concentration in the fuel may be maintained within the military specification limits of 0. 10 - 0. 15 per cent as long as a sufficient quantity of inhibitor is injected to satisfy the equilibrium concentration requirement of the water remaining aboard the vessel after normal deb al lasting., In most cases, no more icing inhibitor is required than is called for by the maximum military specification limit. Tests conducted at the University of Kansas and the author's own experience in loading tankers indicate that extensive savings in tine and money may be realized by using the proposed method. Using the new method could result in a savings of approximately 12 hours turn-a-round time per cargo lifted, a savings which is of immediate significance to the military. By using the new method, a savings of approximately $ 2, 000 per cargo in drying time could also be realized, a savings of immediate significance to tanker operators. On a yearly basis, the author estimates that more than 4, 000 hours in tanker turn-a-round could be saved as well as $ 700, 000 in drying costs. Th-j author recommends, therefore, that field tests be conducted using actual vessels and that if these tests are successful the new method be adopted as soon as possible. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|Based on the {{principle}} of similarity, the wood drying process can be investigated on a scale model, which is the laboratory drier, instead of the full-size industrial drier. Thus, the investigation is simplified and the drying time reduced. The laboratory drying kiln, developed by the research team, is a controlled climate air duct with closed circuit, fitted with a rectangular test section. The air flow is circulated by a centrifugal fan and the air heating is carried out by a set of electric resistances. The selection of the fan and of the heating resistances was performed according to the aerodynamic and thermal calculations, presented in the paper. For the air humidification, in accordance to the <b>drying</b> schedule <b>requirements,</b> the <b>drier</b> has a steam generator that prepares steam which is injected in the air. The wood sample is placed within the drier on a device conceived for both sample support and vertical motion and also, for continuous weighing. By applying {{the principle}} of similarity for both, the industrial kiln and the laboratory drier, the required air velocity for the laboratory drier is determined, for constant values of the temperature and relative humidity of air. Different invariants,characteristic to the drying schedule that was applied, have been also calculated...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} repair and recoat the outer {{surface of a}} ship below the water line, its bottom and bilge must be {{accessible}} and <b>dry.</b> These <b>requirements</b> were initially fulfilled by the so-called dry docks or graving docks which developed from the dock harbours in England. Because {{of the fact that}} the construction of such dry docks is expensive and often technically impractical, the now widely used floating docks were developed from the Dutch camels. The first floating docks were built of wood; later iron came into use for this purpose. English firms, especially Clark, Standfield & Co., are leaders in the construction of floating docks. A large number of patents have been applied for and granted in the course of the years, many of them in Germany, concerned particularly with the issue of self-docking (automatic docking) and the minimisation of the pumping effort. The German navies have played a major role in the construction of pressure testing docks for submarines and large docks for battle cruisers and liners. The development of the floating dock has for the most part reached completion; the improvements still being made are of minor significance and are concerned with the conservation of labour.
