25|$|The Master's {{past with}} the Doctor is {{explored}} somewhat in The Dark Path, which reveals {{that his name}} prior to taking the alias of the Master is Koschei, when he encounters the Second Doctor during their travels. Although initially a somewhat anti-heroic version of the Doctor, willing to commit murder as a first option to save the day but generally still {{trying to do the}} right, Koschei turns to evil and becomes the Master after he discovers that his companion and lover, Ailla, is an undercover agent of the Celestial <b>Intervention</b> <b>Agency</b> sent to spy on him. During the course of the novel, Ailla is shot and killed, with Koschei, not knowing that she is a Time Lord and will simply regenerate, completing a time-based weapon to benefit the anti-alien efforts of soldiers from Earth's Empire, in an attempt to bring her back. The weapon is used to destroy the planet Teriliptus and its inhabitants, but when Ailla turns up alive, the knowledge that he has destroyed a planet for nothing, coupled with the revelation of Ailla's betrayal, proves too much. Koschei resolves to bring his own order to the universe at the expense of free will and becoming its Master. Thanks to the Doctor reprogramming his weapon, Koschei is trapped in a black hole {{at the end of the}} novel, with it being left uncertain how he will escape. Although it is generally implied that it takes him most of his remaining lives to do so (hence why the Master is on his last life while the Doctor, intended to be his contemporary, is only on his third), the cover art of The Dark Path depicts Koschei as being already the same regeneration as the Delgado-era Master.|$|E

30|$|In the National Policy on Disaster Management {{formulated}} in 2009, women, especially destitute women, are considered an important vulnerable group. The guideline also suggested inclusion of women within the State Disaster Response Force (GOI 2009) as women survivors {{could be better}} attended. In community-based disaster preparedness, the participation {{of women in the}} decision-making process is being encouraged in the guideline as government departments and other disaster <b>intervention</b> <b>agencies</b> should facilitate recovery for women from the grassroots level. The National Policy on Disaster Management focuses on linking recovery with safe development, and on women as a target group to encourage social, economic, and infrastructural development. Women are also being prioritized for livelihood restoration efforts. Internationally, The Sphere Handbook (The Sphere Project 2011) considered gender a cross-cutting issue in any disaster intervention, with women {{considered one of the most}} vulnerable groups to be focused on in every disaster intervention program. Equal rights and entitlements are an essential consideration in disaster programing for empowering women survivors.|$|R

30|$|Because my {{intention}} was to discover, understand, and gain insight from a particular group of individuals, the study selected a sample from which the most can be learned (Merriam, 1998). After contacting early <b>intervention</b> <b>agencies</b> and service providers, hospitals, and a parent group site in the New York City metropolitan area that consists of diverse populations with distinctive social characteristics, such as ethnicity, race, class, language, and disability, several families who would fit into ‘the case’ were selected. Within ‘the case’ that the study delineated, the sample of the families was parents of children who have recently entered the early intervention system. The families had a child from birth to age 3 who was referred to early intervention evaluation and service by the parent or the hospital personnel. Because the study aimed {{to look at how}} parents engage in early intervention from the very beginning, my aim was to find families who were at the very earliest stage of establishing early intervention services at the time of recruitment. In that way, the entry process of early intervention as early on as possibly could be examined.|$|R

40|$|One of the many-sided {{effects of}} {{environmental}} injustice in the Niger Delta is “Youth Restiveness” which metamorphosed into proliferation {{of arms and}} the emergence of militias that is arguably a threat to the macro-Nigerian environment. This article, which relied on secondary sources of data, critically examines youth restiveness in the Niger Delta and contends that the root cause is the legal environmental laws that provided the basis for the operational hazards of the oil conglomerates that have collaborated with the Nigerian state whose <b>intervention</b> <b>agencies</b> have largely failed to close the developmental gaps in the region. The article posits that in the face of sundry efforts by the Nigerian state, particularly the infinitesimal 13 % derivation element of the current revenue sharing formula, the failed land use reform attempt, the partially successful short-run post-amnesty program, and the controversial petroleum industry bill, the central developmental concerns of the Niger Delta region have not been addressed. The article concludes with some useful recommendations including the exigency of the modification of the obnoxious and eco-environmentally disadvantageous laws and a holistic developmental approach and action-based programs by the Nigerian government and oil conglomerates that will provide sustainable windows of opportunity and safety nets for the socio-economically dislocated youths...|$|R

5000|$|While {{interference}} {{is apparently}} against Time Lord policy, there are occasions {{when they do}} intervene, albeit indirectly through their CIA or Celestial <b>Intervention</b> <b>Agency.</b> The CIA has occasionally sent the Doctor on missions that required plausible deniability, as in The Two Doctors, and sometimes against his will, Colony in Space and The Monster of Peladon. He is also sent on a mission in The Mutants [...] which was intended to help preserve {{the existence of a}} unique race, which was being destroyed by the excesses of the Earth empire. The Doctor's mission in Genesis of the Daleks even involves changing history to avert the creation of the Daleks, or at least temper their aggressiveness.|$|E

40|$|Government {{and other}} HIV/AIDS <b>intervention</b> <b>agencies</b> have made sexual {{behaviour}} modification {{a major component}} of their preventive strategy as new cases of the epidemic continue to be reported in Kenya. As the impact of the epidemic becomes increasingly evident, there has been a worrying revelation that married couples are affected, yet there has been little attempt to understand marital HIV/AIDS preventive sexual behaviour. Whereas some studies have shown that women are disadvantaged as far as sexual decision-making is concerned, married women’s HIV/AIDS preventive behaviour has not received due research attention. Based on data from a field study conducted among the Maragoli community of western Kenya, this article examines how married women perceive the risk of HIV infection, the preventive strategies they have adopted, and husband perception of wife’s right to protection. A major finding of this study is that, even with high knowledge of the risk of HIV infection, a majority of married women have either low or no capacity to influence marital sexual behaviour related to HIV/AIDS prevention. The conclusion drawn is that HIV/AIDS prevention, especially among married women can only be realised by a change in norms which control sexual relationships and deny women the right to determine their own sexual lives.

40|$|This paper takes a {{governance}} (Leftwich, 1993, pp. 605 - 624) {{perspective in}} examining agenda setting in ad-ministrations in Nigeria since {{the return of}} civilian rule in 1999. Governance as a concept is uniquely applied to developing countries, apparently buoyed by the concern of donors to the marked disparity between economic de-velopment and social policy. Leftwich argues that govern-ance, as a concept, is not new. Western governments, and donor agencies in particular, influenced four factors in the present obsession with governance and good governance. They are the structural adjustment programme, resurgence of neo liberalism in the west, collapse of official commu-nist regimes {{and the rise of}} pro-democracy movements in the developing countries and elsewhere (Leftwich, 1993). This fitted into the preoccupation of the west with dream-ing up schemes meant to salvage the increasingly hopeless and desperate condition of the developing world. This is in sync with the definition of good governance given by one of its leading <b>intervention</b> <b>agencies,</b> the World Bank. Underscoring this concern for Africa, where the bulk of the crisis prevailed, the Bank argued that “underlying the litany of Africa’s development problems is a crisis of govern-ance ” (World Bank, 1989). It defines governance as the ex-ercise of political power to manage a nation’s affairs. Good governance which the Bank argues is synonymous wit...|$|R
50|$|They {{have also}} {{appeared}} in several spin-off novels, including Lords of the Storm by David A. McIntee and The Infinity Doctors by Lance Parkin. In The Infinity Doctors, the Doctor negotiated a peace between the Sontarans and the Rutan Host when {{two of them were}} left trapped in a TARDIS for several hours and got to talking due to their inability to kill each other. General Sontar also made an appearance in that novel. In The Crystal Bucephalus by Craig Hinton, the name of their planet was given as Sontara. The Sontarans also briefly appear in The Eight Doctors, sent to the Eye of Orion by an agent of the Celestial <b>Intervention</b> <b>Agency</b> to kill the Fifth and Eighth Doctors.|$|E

Meanwhile, Chris Cwej is having strange dreams of the past, when the family cast the Doctor out. The Doctor is accused of the murder of the head of the House, but finds many allies in the form of former companions Ace, Romana, K-9 Mark I, K-9 Mark II and Leela, who have become embroiled in a Celestial <b>Intervention</b> <b>Agency</b> plot to overthrow Romana's presidency.

50|$|After {{several more}} adventures with the Doctor, {{the events of}} Human Resources reveal much of the mystery {{surrounding}} Lucie: the Time Lords learned that the Celestial <b>Intervention</b> <b>Agency</b> have been tracking Lucie because they believe she would become a terrible future dictator within Europe, and attempt to alter her present to prevent this. But when she applies {{for a job in}} an office building, which is part of another CIA plot, the Time Lords place her with the Doctor to protect her from the effects of exposure to too much CIA technology. But in reality, a woman named Karen, who had been interviewed on the same day as Lucie, is the actual future dictator, and the Time Lords have either been tricked or simply made a mistake. At {{the end of the story}} Lucie and the Doctor continue to travel together in the TARDIS.|$|E

40|$|When should courts be {{responsible}} for designing federal administrative agencies? In Free Enterprise Fund v.
