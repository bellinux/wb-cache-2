5|$|As non-fusing helium ash accumulates in {{the core}} of a main-sequence star, the {{reduction}} in the abundance of hydrogen per unit mass results in a gradual lowering of the fusion rate within that mass. Since it is the outflow of fusion-supplied energy that supports the higher layers of the star, the core is compressed, producing higher temperatures and pressures. Both factors increase the rate of fusion thus moving the equilibrium towards a smaller, denser, hotter core producing more energy whose increased outflow pushes the higher layers further out. Thus there is a steady increase in the luminosity and radius of the star over time. For example, the luminosity of the early Sun was only about 70% of its current value. As a star ages this luminosity increase changes its position on the HR diagram. This effect results in a broadening of the main sequence band because stars are observed at random stages in their lifetime. That is, the main sequence band develops a thickness on the HR diagram; it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> narrow line.|$|E
25|$|Evolutionary psychologists {{suggest that}} it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> subdiscipline of {{psychology}} but that evolutionary theory can provide a foundational, metatheoretical framework that integrates the entire field of psychology {{in the same way}} evolution has for biology.|$|E
25|$|The {{major problem}} in visual {{perception}} is that what people see <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> translation of retinal stimuli (i.e., {{the image on the}} retina). Thus people interested in perception have long struggled to explain what visual processing does to create what is actually seen.|$|E

25|$|Roger Bacon's {{investigations}} of map projections {{and the appearance}} of portolano and then portolan charts for plying the European trade routes were rare innovations of the period. The Majorcan school is contrasted with the contemporary Italian cartography school. The Carta Pisana portolan chart, made {{at the end of the}} 13th century (1275–1300), is the oldest surviving nautical chart (that <b>is,</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> map but a document showing accurate navigational directions).|$|E
25|$|Some scholarship, {{linked to}} wider debates in Anthropology, has {{increasingly}} emphasized {{the state as}} a primarily cultural artifact, and focuses on how symbolism plays a primary role in state formation. Most explicitly, some studies emphasize how the creation of national identification and citizenship were crucial to state formation. The state then <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> military or economic authority, but also includes cultural components creating consent by people by giving them rights and shared belonging.|$|E
25|$|Overall, Rivers {{attributed}} the neuroses to both (i) the escape of painful instincts and their associated emotions from the unconscious and (ii) the mind's unsuccessful efforts to force such instincts and their emotions {{back into the}} conscious. While Rivers' theory contains some Freudian elements, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> restatement of psychoanalytic theory; Rivers' theory of the neuroses draws heavily on the neurological observations and conclusions Rivers and Henry Head drew from their work on nerve regeneration.|$|E
25|$|Sikhism was {{influenced}} by Bhakti movement, but it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>an</b> extension of the Bhakti movement. Sikhism, for instance, disagreed with some views of Bhakti saints Kabir and Ravidas.|$|R

25|$|Microsoft Office 2007 Service Pack 1 was {{released}} on December 11, 2007. Official documentation claims that SP1 <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> rollup of publicly released patches, but that it also contains fixes {{for a total of}} 481 issues throughout the entire Office suite. Microsoft Office 2007 Service Pack 2 {{was released}} on April 28, 2009. It added improved support for ODF, XPS and PDF standards, and included several bug fixes. Microsoft Office 2007 Service Pack 3 {{was released on}} October 25, 2011.|$|E
25|$|Fourth, {{it differs}} from many wargames in that each unit <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> set of {{offensive}} and defensive numerical ratings; rather, each ship {{has a variety of}} individual weapons and resources, each employing their own tactics and counter-tactics. Thus players are able to utilize, e.g., boarding parties, shuttles, tractor beams, electronic countermeasures, etc., permitting many more tactics than in the average wargame, requiring much more documentation. It is this which allows the game to become a science-fiction experience, and puts it in concert with many literary elements of Star Trek.|$|E
25|$|The American Dream is {{the belief}} that through hard work and determination, any United States {{immigrant}} can achieve a better life, usually in terms of financial prosperity and enhanced personal freedom of choice. According to historians, the rapid economic and industrial expansion of the U.S. <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> function of being a resource rich, hard working, and inventive country, but the belief that anybody could get a share of the country's wealth if he or she was willing to work hard. This dream has been a major factor in attracting immigrants to the United States.|$|E

25|$|Parrots have {{fluorescent}} plumage {{that may}} be used in mate signaling. A study using mate-choice experiments on budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulates) found compelling support for fluorescent sexual signaling, with both males and females significantly preferring birds with the fluorescent experimental stimulus. This study suggests that the fluorescent plumage of parrots <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> by-product of pigmentation, but instead an adapted sexual signal. Considering the intricacies of the pathways that produce fluorescent pigments, there may be significant costs involved. Therefore, individuals exhibiting strong fluorescence may be honest indicators of high individual quality, since they can deal with the associated costs.|$|E
25|$|Mystical {{experience}} <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> matter {{between the}} mystic and God, but is often shaped by cultural issues. For instance, Caroline Bynum has shown how, {{in the late}} Middle Ages, miracles attending the taking of the Eucharist were not simply symbolic of the Passion story, but served as vindication of the mystic's theological orthodoxy by proving that the mystic had not fallen prey to heretical ideas, such as the Cathar rejection of the material world as evil, contrary to orthodox teaching that God took on human flesh and remained sinless. Thus, the nature of mystical experience could be tailored to the particular cultural and theological issues of the time.|$|E
25|$|A {{sophisticated}} {{academic language}} for {{talking about the}} sociology of roles {{did not exist in}} the mid-19th century. Marx therefore borrowed from theatre and literature to express his idea. Although György Lukács pioneered a sociology of drama in 1909, a sociology of roles began only in the 1930s, and a specific sociology of theatre (e.g. by Jean Duvignaud) first emerged in the 1960s. Marx's concept is both that an identity appears differently from its true identity (it is masked or disguised), and that this difference has very real practical consequences (the mask <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> decoration, but performs a real function and has real effects, even independently of the mask bearer).|$|E

25|$|Since Everett's {{original}} work, {{there have}} appeared {{a number of}} similar formalisms in the literature. One such is the relative state formulation. It makes two assumptions: first, the wavefunction <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> description of the object's state, but that it actually is entirely equivalent to the object, a claim it has in common with some other interpretations. Secondly, observation or measurement has no special laws or mechanics, unlike in the Copenhagen interpretation which considers the wavefunction collapse as {{a special kind of}} event which occurs as a result of observation. Instead, measurement in the relative state formulation is the consequence of a configuration change in the memory of an observer described by the same basic wave physics as the object being modeled.|$|E
25|$|Star Fleet Battles is a ship-to-ship warfare {{simulation}} game, {{which uses}} cardboard counters {{to represent the}} ships, shuttles, seeking weapons, terrain, and information on a hexagonal map. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> game, but rather a detailed game system for two or more players (there are some solitaire scenarios). Typically, a player will have one ship in a game, though they can control an entire fleet, if they can {{keep track of the}} paperwork and options involved; multiple players can play as teams, with each team splitting up the work of running a squadron or fleet, or a 'free-for-all' fight can be run. Ships represented in the game are typically starships from such classic Star Trek powers as the Federation, Romulan Star Empire, Klingon Empire, or purely Star Fleet Universe creations such as the Hydran Kingdom or Interstellar Concordium.|$|E
25|$|If {{someone were}} {{to behave as}} if they {{understood}} a language which no-one else can make sense of, we might call this {{an example of a}} private language. It is not sufficient here, however, for the language to simply be one that has not yet been translated. In order to count as a private language in Wittgenstein's sense, it must be in principle incapable of translation into an ordinary language - if for example it were to describe those inner experiences supposed to be inaccessible to others. The private language being considered <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> language in fact understood by one person, but a language that in principle can only be understood by one person. So the last speaker of a dying language would not be speaking a private language, since the language remains in principle learnable. A private language must be unlearnable and untranslatable, and yet it must appear that the speaker is able to make sense of it.|$|E

500|$|This rule <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> {{method of}} {{breaking}} ties; it reflects an altogether proper reluctance by the judiciary {{to assume that}} Congress has chosen further to disadvantage a people whom our Nation long ago reduced {{to a state of}} dependency. The rule is particularly appropriate when the statute in question was passed primarily {{for the benefit of the}} Indians, as was the 1959 Division of Assets Act. [...] Absent “clear and plain” language to the contrary, it must be assumed that Congress did not intend to belie its “avowed solicitude” for the Indians with a “backhanded” abrogation or limitation of their rights.|$|E
