[...] Despite this, they have produced a song for Adele's third studio album 25, entitled [...] "All I Ask". This marked their last production as a team.|$|E
500|$|In 1968 film {{producer}} Marvin Worth hired novelist James Baldwin {{to write a}} screenplay based on The Autobiography of MalcolmX; Baldwin was joined by screenwriter Arnold Perl, who died in 1971 before the screenplay could be finished.

Other authors who attempted to draft screenplays include playwright David Mamet, novelist David Bradley, author Charles Fuller, and screenwriter Calder Willingham. Director Spike Lee revised the Baldwin-Perl script for his 1992 film MalcolmX.|$|E

500|$|Bax {{was born}} in the London suburb of Streatham, Surrey, to a prosperous Victorian family. He was the eldest son of Alfred Ridley Bax (1844–1918) and his wife, Charlotte Ellen, née Lea (1860–1940). The couple's {{youngest}} son, Clifford Lea Bax, became a playwright and essayist. Alfred Bax was a barrister of the Middle Temple, but having a private income he did not practise. In 1896 the family moved to a mansion in Hampstead. Bax later wrote that although it would have been good to be raised in the country, the large gardens of the family house were the next best thing. He was a musical child: [...] "I cannot remember the long-lost <b>day</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> unable to play the piano – inaccurately".|$|E
500|$|Lawrence Morton, in a {{study of}} the origins of The Rite, records that in 1907–08 Stravinsky set to music two poems from Sergey Gorodetsky's {{collection}} Yar. Another poem in the anthology, which Stravinsky did not set but is likely to have read, is [...] "Yarila" [...] which, Morton observes, contains many of the basic elements from which The Rite of Spring developed, including pagan rites, sage elders, and the propitiatory sacrifice of a young maiden: [...] "The likeness is too close to be coincidental". Stravinsky himself gave contradictory accounts of the genesis of The Rite. In a 1920 article he stressed that the musical ideas had come first, that the pagan setting had been suggested by the music {{rather than the other way}} round. However, in his 1936 autobiography he described the origin of the work thus: [...] "One <b>day</b> , <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> finishing the last pages of L'Oiseau de Feu in St Petersburg, I had a fleeting vision... I saw in my imagination a solemn pagan rite: sage elders, seated in a circle, watching a young girl dance herself to death. They were sacrificing her to propitiate the god of Spring. Such was the theme of the Sacre du Printemps".|$|E
500|$|In 1997, she {{starred in}} the Australian {{ensemble}} romantic drama Under the Lighthouse Dancing and also played the lead role in the short-lived television series Sleepwalkers. In 1998, she starred alongside Neil Patrick Harris and Debbie Reynolds in the TV film The Christmas Wish, played the supporting role of Giulia De Lezze in Dangerous Beauty, and provided some voice work for [...] She {{said in an interview}} in 2012, [...] "That really should not be on my résumé! I think that was early on in the <b>day,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> trying to beef up my résumé. I came in and did a couple days' work of voiceovers and we had to suck on [...] and then do a little mouse voice. But I was one in a hundred, so I'm sure you would never be able to identify my voice. I probably couldn't either!" [...] In 1999, she played Alice in the romantic comedy Strange Planet and the Texan student Holly Maddux in The Hunt for the Unicorn Killer, which was based on the real life effort to capture Ira Einhorn, who was charged with Maddux's murder. In 2000, while David Lynch was expanding the rejected pilot of Mulholland Drive into a feature film, Watts starred alongside Derek Jacobi, Jack Davenport and Iain Glen in the BBC TV film The Wyvern Mystery, an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Sheridan Le Fanu that was broadcast in March of that year.|$|E

2500|$|Gresham {{was born}} in Spartanburg County, South Carolina, to Claude Gresham Sr. and the former Belle Hill. He {{inherited}} his nickname from his father, a semi-professional baseball player known as [...] "Grit". Gresham grew up in rural South Carolina. As a small boy, he was so interested in hunting that he slept with his air rifle beside his bed. He took his first shot of the day out of his bedroom window. [...] "Two {{things were going to}} happen every <b>day</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> growing up.

2500|$|Baldwin {{developed}} {{his work on}} the screenplay into the 1972 book One <b>Day,</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>Was</b> Lost: A Scenario Based on Alex Haley's The Autobiography of Malcolm X. In 1976, Baldwin wrote of his experience, [...] "I think that I would rather be horsewhipped, or incarcerated in the forthright bedlam of Bellevue, than repeat the adventure". Baldwin died in 1987. Several authors attempted drafts, including David Mamet, David Bradley, Charles Fuller and Calder Willingham. Once Spike Lee took over as director, he rewrote the Baldwin-Perl script. Due to the revisions, the Baldwin family asked the producer to take his name off the credits. Thus Malcolm X only credits Perl and Lee as the writers and Malcolm X and Alex Haley as the authors of The Autobiography of Malcolm X.|$|E
2500|$|Felix, being bisexual, was {{not certain}} {{if he was}} [...] "fit for marriage." [...] Still, {{he was drawn to}} Irina and her icon-like beauty when he first {{encountered}} her. [...] "One <b>day</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> out riding I met a very beautiful girl accompanied by an elderly lady. Our eyes met and she made such an impression on me that I reined in my horse to gaze at her as she walked on," [...] he wrote in his memoirs. One day in 1910, he was paid a visit by Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich and Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna and was happy to discover the girl he had seen on the riding trail was their only daughter, Irina. [...] "This time I {{had plenty of time to}} admire the wondrous beauty of the girl who was eventually to become my wife and lifelong companion. She had beautiful features, clear-cut as a cameo, and looked very like her father." [...] He renewed his acquaintance with Irina in 1913 and was even more drawn to her. [...] "She was very shy and reserved, which added a certain mystery to her charm.... Little by little, Irina became less timid. At first her eyes were more eloquent than her conversation but, as she became more expansive, I learned to admire the keenness of her intelligence and her sound judgment. I concealed nothing in my past life from her, and, far from being perturbed by what I told her, she showed great tolerance and comprehension." [...] Yusupov wrote that Irina, perhaps because she had grown up with so many brothers, showed none of the artifice or lack of honesty that had put him off relations with other women.|$|E
