5|$|Ultra-{{stripped}} supernovae {{occur when}} the <b>exploding</b> <b>star</b> has been stripped (almost) {{all the way to}} the metal core, via mass transfer in a close binary. As a result, very little material is ejected from the <b>exploding</b> <b>star</b> (~0.1 MSun). In the most extreme cases, ultra-stripped supernovae can occur in naked metal cores, barely above the Chandrasekhar mass limit. SN 2005ek might be an observational example of an ultra-stripped supernova, giving rise to a relatively dim and fast decaying light curve. The nature of ultra-stripped supernovae can be both iron core-collapse and electron capture supernovae, depending on the mass of the collapsing core.|$|E
25|$|Colgate and White's {{theory of}} {{supernova}} neutrino production was confirmed in 1987, when neutrinos from supernova 1987A were detected. The water-based detectors Kamiokande II and IMB detected 11 and 8 antineutrinos of thermal origin, respectively, while the scintillator-based Baksan detector found 5 neutrinos (lepton number = 1) of either thermal or electron-capture origin, {{in a burst}} lasting less than 13 seconds. The neutrino signal from the supernova arrived at earth several hours {{before the arrival of}} the first electromagnetic radiation, as expected from the evident fact that the latter emerges along with the shock wave. The exceptionally feeble interaction with normal matter allowed the neutrinos to pass through the churning mass of the <b>exploding</b> <b>star,</b> while the electromagnetic photons were slowed.|$|E

500|$|The modern {{standard}} model for Type Ia supernovae explosions {{is founded on}} a proposal by Whelan and Iben in 1973, and is based upon a mass-transfer scenario to a degenerate companion star. In particular, the light curve of SN1972e in NGC 5253, which was observed {{for more than a}} year, was followed long enough to discover that after its broad [...] "hump" [...] in brightness, the supernova faded at a nearly constant rate of about 0.01 magnitudes per day. [...] Translated to another system of units, this is nearly the same as the decay rate of cobalt-56 (56Co), whose half-life is 77 days. [...] The degenerate explosion model predicts the production of about a solar mass of nickel-56 (56Ni) by the <b>exploding</b> <b>star.</b> The 56Ni decays with a half-life of 6.8 days to 56Co, and the decay of the nickel and cobalt provides the energy radiated away by the supernova late in its history. [...] The agreement in both total energy production and the fade rate between the theoretical models and the observations of 1972e led to rapid acceptance of the degenerate-explosion model.|$|E

Between 10:00 and 16:00 [...] "the heat produced what the men called a 'mirage,' and rifle fire under such conditions was apt to be erratic ... By a sort of natural agreement, both sides shut down the war until the hours of dusk and darkness." [...] Then trenches were raided and fighting under <b>exploding</b> <b>star</b> shells and flares in no man's land occurred, while repairs and improvements to trenches were made, barbed wire strung, communication trenches widened, cables buried, and gun emplacements constructed.|$|E
40|$|We {{conduct a}} series of magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) {{simulations}} of magnetized interstellar medium (ISM) disturbed by <b>exploding</b> <b>stars.</b> Each star deposits a randomly oriented, dipolar magnetic field into ISM. The simulations are performed in a Cartesian box, in a reference frame that is corotating with the galactic disk. The medium is stratified by vertical galactic gravity. The resulting turbulent state of ISM magnetized by the stellar explosions is processed {{with the aid of}} Fourier analysis. The results leads {{to the conclusion that the}} input of magnetic energy from <b>exploding</b> <b>stars</b> is additionally multiplied by differential rotation. The resulting magnetic field appears to grow up in small-scale component, while the total magnetic flux remains limited. Our results indicate that magnetic field originating from <b>exploding</b> <b>stars</b> can be a source of initial magnetic fields for a subsequent dynamo process.
