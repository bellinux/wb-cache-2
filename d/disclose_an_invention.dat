50|$|The {{aggregation}} of select {{strains of}} the several species into one product is an application of that newly discovered natural principle. But however ingenious the discovery of that natural principle may have been, the application of it is hardly more than an advance in the packaging of the inoculants. Each of the species of root nodule bacteria contained in the package infects {{the same group of}} leguminous plants which it always infected. No species acquires a different use. The combination of species produces no new bacteria, no change in the six species of bacteria, and no enlargement of the range of their utility. Each species has the same effect it always had. The bacteria perform in their natural way. Their use in combination does not improve in any way their natural functioning. They serve the ends nature originally provided, and act quite independently of any effort of the patentee.… The application of this newly discovered natural principle to the problem of packaging of inoculants may well have been an important commercial advance. But once nature's secret of the noninhibitive quality of certain {{strains of the}} species of Rhizobium was discovered, {{the state of the art}} made the production of a mixed inoculant a simple step. Even though it may have been the product of skill, it certainly was not the product of invention. There is no way in which we could call it such unless we borrowed invention from the discovery of the natural principle itself. That is to say, there is no invention here unless the discovery that certain strains of the several species of these bacteria are noninhibitive, and may thus be safely mixed, is invention. But we cannot so hold without allowing a patent to issue on one of the ancient secrets of nature now disclosed.… Since we conclude that the product claims do not <b>disclose</b> <b>an</b> <b>invention</b> or discovery within the meaning of the patent statutes, we do not consider whether the other statutory requirements…are satisfied.|$|E

50|$|Sufficiency of {{disclosure}} or enablement is a patent law requirement {{according to which}} a patent application must <b>disclose</b> <b>a</b> claimed <b>invention</b> in sufficient detail for the notional person {{skilled in the art}} to carry out that claimed invention. The requirement is fundamental to patent law: a monopoly is granted for a given period of time in exchange for a disclosure to the public how to make or practice the invention.|$|R
5000|$|With about 50 {{stations}} {{using the}} technology and perhaps another 50 committed, a controversy emerged in 1989 when MIT professor and Bose Corporation CEO Amar Bose and Bose engineer William Short released a critical study, finding the system to {{have the potential to}} [...] "seriously degrade the quality of stereo reception whether received by FMX equipment or not." [...] According to the study, the heavy compression of the L&minus;R audio caused interference in receivers under multipath conditions. A BTP spokesman rebutted the finding, saying that the Bose analysis exaggerated a [...] "worst-case scenario", and actually employed [...] "flawed mathematics" [...] to attempt to prove their point. Perhaps not coincidentally, a patent application filed earlier by Bose <b>disclosed</b> <b>an</b> <b>invention</b> whose implementation was incompatible with the adoption of FMX, while another - filed by Bose and Short {{around the time of the}} release of the critical study - sought to improve the performance of FMX under multipath conditions.|$|R
40|$|A {{firm that}} owns a patent has a {{legal right to}} exclude. Applying for the patent, however, <b>discloses</b> {{discovery}} of <b>an</b> <b>invention</b> by the firm. Both the ownership of {{the right and the}} disclosure of the discovery expose the firm to an acquisition, because other firms may be interested in buying the right or the <b>invention</b> for <b>a</b> number of reasons. This idea of patent-driven mergers and acquisitions (M&As) is tested using a large sample of Finnish firms that are mostly private and small. It is found that patenting by a Finnish firm is positively correlated with the probability that the firm is acquired by a foreign firm. ...|$|R
40|$|Once {{termed the}} “metaphysics” of patent law, the {{doctrine}} of inherent anticipation has befuddled courts and practitioners alike for decades. Inherent anticipation refers {{to the notion that}} a previously published reference can disclose each and every limitation of <b>a</b> later–patented <b>invention</b> without expressly delineating those limitations. These (un) disclosed limitations are necessarily present, or inherent, within the previously published reference. When a previously published reference <b>discloses</b> <b>a</b> later–claimed <b>invention</b> expressly or inherently, the patent covering the later–claimed invention is invalid because the invention lacks novelty. Thus, {{the doctrine of}} inherent anticipation allows invalidation of a patent {{in whole or in part}} upon a showing that a prior reference contained <b>a</b> patentee’s later–disclosed <b>invention,</b> even if the earlier reference did not expressly disclose what the patentee claimed as his invention. Courts, including the Federal Circuit, have grappled with whether a person having ordinary skill in the relevant art must recognize inherent features in the prior art reference for the doctrine of inherent anticipation to apply. The resulting intracircuit split in Federal Circuit case law fostered two competing schools of thought on this issue. The Federal Circuit eventually held that recognition of inherent features is not required. Commentators, however, have called upon the court to revisit the doctrine due to its potential chilling effects on innovation. This Note suggests that the Federal Circuit should reexamine the doctrine, paying particular attention to considerations of whether or not a person having ordinary skill in the art was capable of identifying inherent features in the asserted prior art reference. Clarification, or even outright reformation, of the inherent anticipation doctrine grows more imperative as our technological capabilities quickly outpace our legal rules...|$|R
40|$|Patent {{applications}} are evaluated {{in light of}} the prior art. What this means is that patent examiners evaluate <b>a</b> claimed <b>invention</b> by comparing it with what in a rough sense corresponds to the set of ideas and inventions already known to the public. This is done for three reasons. First, the comparison helps to ensure that patents issue only in cases where an inventor has made a non-trivial contribution to the public’s store of knowledge. Second, it protects a possible reliance interest {{on the part of the}} public since, once <b>an</b> <b>invention</b> is widely known, members of the public might reasonably assume that the invention is free for all to use. And third, it pressures inventors to file their patent applications promptly lest some other inventor <b>disclose</b> <b>a</b> related <b>invention</b> or the applicant himself inadvertently let slip some fraction of his own research result. The prior art inquiry has a fourth policy implication, however, and while this one might not have been one of the motivating factors for establishing the inquiry in the first place, it is just as important when it comes to designing and interpreting sensible prior art rules. That additional wrinkle is simply this: the fact that patent {{applications are}} evaluated {{in light of the}} prior art gives firms a strategic incentive to create prior art. A firm can publish a journal article or engage in a public demonstration and in that way affect both a rival’s ability to patent <b>a</b> related <b>invention</b> and the rival 2 ̆ 7 s incentive to do so. Perhaps surprisingly, this can make the disclosing firm better off even though, by revealing information, the firm is likely helping its rival and, worse, narrowing or even fully preempting the very patent it seeks. In this Article, then, we explain the incentive for strategic disclosure. We show that a firm trailing in a given patent race has <b>an</b> incentive to <b>disclose</b> information in the hopes of preempting a rival 2 ̆ 7 s patent, but only if the laggard itself has little chance of leapfrogging the leader and winning the race. We show that a firm leading a patent race similarly has <b>an</b> incentive to <b>disclose,</b> this time in an effort to reduce its rival 2 ̆ 7 s expected payoff and in that way encourage the rival to quit the race. We consider the possibility that private negotiations will displace public disclosures, for example with the laggard agreeing not to disclose and in exchange receiving from the ultimate patentee some form of favorable licensing agreement. Lastly, we consider the implications all this might have for the patent system overall...|$|R

50|$|Most laws {{dealing with}} the {{protection}} of inventions do not actually define what <b>an</b> <b>invention</b> is. <b>A</b> number of countries, however, define inventions as new solutions to technical problems. The problem may be old or new, but the solution, {{in order to be}} considered <b>an</b> <b>invention,</b> must be <b>a</b> new one. Merely discovering something that already exists in nature will not generally qualify as an invention; an adequate amount of human ingenuity, creativity and inventiveness must be involved.

5000|$|Since <b>an</b> <b>invention</b> is {{considered}} to be new if it does not form part {{of the state of the}} art, the legal concept of [...] "state of the art" [...] is critical for assessing whether <b>an</b> <b>invention</b> is new.|$|R
5000|$|Inventors who are {{employees}} {{of a company}} generally sell or assign their patent rights to the company they work for.

Germany has a law on employees' inventions providing strict rules concerning the transfer of rights to <b>an</b> <b>invention</b> to the employer.

40|$|Research firms <b>disclose</b> <b>a</b> {{surprisingly}} {{large amount}} of information to the patent office through “targeted ” disclosures; that is, disclosures intended to make the patent office aware that potentially patentable information {{is already in the}} public domain. Conventional wisdom holds that these disclosures are made for defensive purposes; the disclosing firm does not itself plan to pursue patents related to the disclosed information, so the firm <b>discloses</b> as <b>a</b> way of creating prior art that might stop rivals from patenting. But firms have <b>an</b> incentive to <b>disclose</b> even if they themselves intend to pursue patent protection. The reason is that, by making it more difficult to patent, disclosure in essence extends the patent race. If <b>an</b> <b>invention</b> of <b>a</b> certain quality would have been sufficient to qualify for patent protection before the disclosure, after the disclosure any invention must be that much better before it will represent a sufficient advance over the now-expanded prior art. Extending the patent race can be an attractive strategy for a firm trailing in a given race since a longer race might offer that firm a better opportunity to catch up. Extending the race can similarly be attractive to a leading firm, since making the rac...|$|R
