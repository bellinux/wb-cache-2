40|$|International {{efforts to}} define fair {{information}} practices for global networks derive from two distinct paradigms. Traditionally, regulatory standards have been cast in trade terms. The trade perspective seeks to promote <b>free</b> <b>flows</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> and define standards that balance <b>free</b> <b>flows</b> against human rights values. Fair information practices also draw on another rarely emphasized technical paradigm. This approach seeks to eliminate any technological obstacles to <b>free</b> <b>flows</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> by defining standards for system integrity and interoperability. Nevertheless, these technical standards {{are set in}} ways that also define fair information practices. While each paradigm provides a basis to establish rules for global electronic highways, the two are surprisingly self-contained and tend not to fit within the broader trends in global information networks and practices. Instead of facilitating the definition <b>of</b> fair <b>information</b> practice standards, the distinct trade and technical perspectives obscure the tendency of global networks to shift norms for the regulation of private sector actors into a combined arena of both national and network jurisdiction. Global information networks challenge regulatory and political assumptions and defy simple regulation <b>of</b> fair <b>information</b> practice. These independent approaches to the establishment <b>of</b> fair <b>information</b> practice rules suggest that international data flows require complex standards, including overlapping regulation, rather than isolated one-dimensional rules...|$|R

Though expectations to outcomes are high, not much is known about how reforms affect local governance of land. This working paper {{provides an overview of}} implementation projects carried out in Mainland Tanzania and describes experiences gathered so far. It focuses on establishment of formal institutions for land administration and dispute settlement in rural areas. The implementation process is described as slow and uneven. With a few exceptions, implementation has been project-driven, largely controlled by donors and implementing agencies. At the same time the responsible ministry retains some control through its know-how, which is shared with other stakeholders in bits and pieces only. The paper concludes that more resources, more commitment and a <b>freer</b> <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> is required if reform objectives are to be achieved.

The 21 st century media are saddled with the responsibility of providing the citizenry with substantial information to help them make informed decisions. The Freedom <b>of</b> <b>Information</b> Act (FOIA) synergized with Information and Communication Technology (ICT) have aided <b>freer</b> <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> from the media to the electorate. To ensure a successful democratic governance and sustainable development, the media have the responsibility to communicate the actions of the government to its citizens and relaying the feedback to the government through opinion pages and public affairs programmes, among others. Since inhibitions on the path <b>of</b> freedom <b>of</b> <b>information</b> have been removed with the hopes to enhance media capacity to freely divulge information, this paper, therefore, examines how well the media are living up to the expectation of grooming an informed populace.
