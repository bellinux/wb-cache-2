50|$|During World War II, when {{powerful}} rocket engines {{were first}} {{considered by the}} German, American and Soviet engineers independently, all discovered that rocket engines need high mass flow rate of both oxidizer and fuel to generate a sufficient thrust. At that time oxygen and low molecular weight hydrocarbons were used as oxidizer and fuel pair. At room temperature and pressure, both are <b>in</b> <b>gaseous</b> <b>state.</b> Hypothetically, if propellants had been stored as pressurized gases, the size and mass of fuel tanks themselves would severely decrease rocket efficiency. Therefore, to get the required mass flow rate, the only option was to cool the propellants down to cryogenic temperatures (below −183 °C K, −253 °C K), converting them to liquid form. Hence, all cryogenic rocket engines are also, by definition, either liquid-propellant rocket engines or hybrid rocket engines.|$|E

50|$|DMA(III) {{is able to}} form {{reactive}} {{oxygen species}} (ROS) by reaction with molecular oxygen. Resulting metabolites are the dimethylarsenic radical and the dimethylarsenic peroxyl radical.Both DMA(III) and DMA(V) were shown to release iron from horse spleen {{as well as from}} human liver ferritin if ascorbic acid was administered simultaneously. Thus, formation of ROS can be promoted.Moreover, arsenic could cause oxidative stress by depleting the cell’s antioxidants, especially the ones containing thiol groups. The accumulation of ROS like the cited above and hydroxyl radicals, superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxides causes aberrant gene expression at low concentrations and lesions of lipids, proteins and DNA in higher concentrations which eventually lead to cellular death.In a rat animal model, urine levels of 8-hydroxy-2’-desoxyguanosine (as a biomarker of ROS DNA damage) were measured after treatment with DMA(V). In comparison to control levels, {{they turned out to be}} significantly increased. This theory is further supported by a cross-sectional study which found elevated mean serum lipid peroxides (LPO) in the As exposed individuals which correlated with blood levels of inorganic arsenic and methylated metabolites and inversely correlated with nonprotein sulfhydryl (NPSH) levels in whole blood. Another study found an association of As levels in whole blood with the level of reactive oxidants in plasma and an inverse relationship with plasma antioxidants. A finding of the latter study indicates that methylation might in fact be a detoxification pathway with regard to oxidative stress: the results showed that the lower the As methylation capacity was, the lower the level of plasma antioxidant capacity. As reviewed by Kitchin (2001), the oxidative stress theory provides an explanation for the preferred tumor sites connected with arsenic exposure. Considering that a high partial pressure of oxygen is present in lungs and DMA(III) is excreted <b>in</b> <b>gaseous</b> <b>state</b> via the lungs this seems to be a plausible mechanism for special vulnerability. The fact that DMA is produced by methylation in the liver, excreted via the kidneys and latter on stored in the bladder accounts for the other tumor localizations.|$|E

40|$|Today {{hydrazine}} is {{the commonly}} used monopropellant for attitude- and orbit control of satellites and for powering probes or landers. Due to changing {{political and economic}} framework, (e. g. the REACH regulation in Europe) different propellants for replacing hydrazine are currently under development or qualification. The Institute of Space Propulsion of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) at Lampoldshausen is focusing on two different propellants to replace hydrazine: ADN-based monopropellants and mixtures of nitrous oxide with hydrocarbons. The latter are so called premixed monopropellants: oxidizer and fuel are stored in a premixed state in one tank. Thus the simplified propulsion system of a monopropellant can be combined with the high ISP of a bipropellant. To gain experience with a propellant mixture consisting of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and ethene (C 2 H 4), DLR is conducting hot gas combustion tests with an experimental combustor.

The decoloration rate of the dye solutions was promoted with the increasing of plasma treatment time. 0. 1 % CV solution needed 2 min to fade and 0. 1 % MO solution needed 3 min to fade at the discharge condition of 100 W and 8 mm.

40|$|The sintering-sublimation {{technics}} {{was conceived}} {{for increasing the}} reliability of the photoconductive devices, by decreasing the concentration of mobiles donors, which are utilised for photoconductive material sensibilisation. The technics combines three different technics: the vapor phase deposition; the vacuum vaporising; the ceramic sinterisation. This special technics gives stoichiometric layers. The technics avoids dissociation (the flash sublimation technic), sublimates the compounds from two different sources, on heated support, or sublimates the compound, with Cd excess. It was investigated, by mass spectrometry and optical absorption studies, the presence, <b>in</b> <b>gaseous</b> <b>state,</b> of the AIIBVI molecules. The condensation on the substrate of the vapors is difficult because the Cd, Zn and Hg elements have difficulties in the condensation process. The Frenkel model, of the condensation, can be successfully used for describing the process. This model uses the observations concerning the difficulty of the condensation on supports of those elements, at higher temperatures than 90 - 195 K.

The cloud is assumed to have three states in the proposed algorithm. Gaseous state represents the global exploration.
