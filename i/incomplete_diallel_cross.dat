Variation in disease response, ranging from highly susceptible to resistant, indicates a quantitative effect. The estimate of the narrow-sense heritability was 0. 49 +/- 0. 04 (SE), suggesting the population should be responsive to phenotypic recurrent selection.

These cultivars {{had been previously}} tested for their homogeneity of distinctive plant characters (flower color, plant height, earliness, persistence of flowering). F 1 hybrids {{as well as their}} parental forms were grown in Cluj-Napoca, Transylvania, in two successive years, 2006 and 2007, and measurements and observations were performed on six quantitative characters considered as having an obvious ornamental value: plant height, no. of inflorescences/plant, no. of flower/inflorescence, diameter of individual flower, start of blooming and persistence of flowering. Based on these date heritability in wide and narrow sense were computed as well as the general (GCA) and specific (SCA) combining ability. Additive effects of polygenes, emphasized by high GCA values in several characters, suggest that, in gillyflower, for most of these characters there are groups of polygenes with positive effects and other groups with negative ones. For SCA significant values were found for most of the characters under study, which could be considered as an preliminary proof that, in gillyflower, there might be fair chances of developing commercial hybrids with an obvious phenotypic expression of the desired heterosis (negative or positive) ...|$|R
40|$|Parental {{selection}} {{is crucial for}} hybrid breeding, but the methods available for such a selection are not very effective. In this study, a 6 × 6 <b>incomplete</b> <b>diallel</b> <b>cross</b> was designed using 12 rapeseed germplasms, {{and a total of}} 36 hybrids together with their parental lines were planted in 4 environments. Four yield-related traits and seed oil content (OC) were evaluated. Genetic distance (GD) was estimated with 359 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) markers. Heterosis levels, general combining ability (GCA) and specific combining ability (SCA) were evaluated. GD was found to have a significant correlation with better-parent heterosis (BPH) of thousand seed weight (TSW), SCA of seeds per silique (SS), TSW, and seed yield per plant (SY), while SCA showed a statistically significant correlation with heterosis levels of all traits at 1 % significance level. Statistically significant correlations were also observed between GCA of maternal or paternal parents and heterosis levels of different traits except for SS. Interestingly, maternal (TSW, SS, and OC) and paternal (siliques per plant (SP) and SY) inheritance of traits was detected using contribution ratio of maternal and paternal GCA variance as well as correlations between GCA and heterosis levels. Phenotype and heterosis levels of all the traits except TSW of hybrids were significantly correlated with the average performance of parents.

40|$|The low {{percentage}} of callus induction and green-plant regeneration has limited {{the application of}} anther culture techniques in indica rice breeding programmes. The aim of this work {{was to investigate the}} inheritance of the two characters and to determine whether good combinations with high-frequency callus induction and green-plant regeneration could be selected by sexual hybridization of suitable parents. So, a 3 x 4 <b>incomplete</b> <b>diallel</b> <b>crosses</b> were conducted between 7 parental lines. Three of them were believed to possess relatively high callus induction capacity and the other four relatively high green-plant regeneration capacity, based on our previous studies. Analysis of combining abilities and heritabilities revealed that both additive and non-additive effects were found to be important in the genetic control of callus induction. In case of green-plant regeneration, non-additive effects were predominant. Broad sense heritability values of 0. 92 for callus induction and 0. 98 for green-plant regeneration suggested that more than 90 % of the observed variation was due to genetic effects, with just less than 10 % attributed to non-genetic or environmental effects. In addition, the moderate narrow sense heritability values of 0. 49 for callus induction, 0. 29 for green-plant regeneration showed that the potential to introduce high responding ability into low lines was moderate. It was therefore conceivable that the frequency of anther culture response might be improved by suitable hybridization and selection strategies. A hybrid combination of code no. 67 / 107 incorporating high callus induction and high green-plant regeneration ability was selected in which genotype with high values of general combining ability (GCA) and positive effects of specific combining ability (SCA) ...|$|R

40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} for conducting a Hayman analysis of non-replicated diallel tables using a maximum-likelihood (ML) model-fitting approach, {{rather than a}} traditional analysis of variance (ANOVA) approach. Hayman's linear model for a diallel analysis is used to generate a table of expected cell means. This table of expected cell means is fit to a table of observed cell means, and the fit is assessed using a chi-square value. Often data collected from <b>diallel</b> <b>crosses</b> fail to meet the underlying assumptions of ANOVA. The ML method makes no assumptions about equal cell sizes or homogeneity of variance. Thus, the ML method for diallel analysis provides some statistical advantages over ANOVA methods. The ML method also offers the advantage of having the ability to analyze diallels with missing cells. Using the ML method, <b>incomplete</b> <b>diallel</b> tables can be analyzed, and the partitioning of all the sources of variation in a diallel table is still accomplished from the remaining crosses.

40|$|Advanced button {{mushroom}} cultivars {{that are less}} sensitive to mechanical bruising are required by the mushroom industry, where automated harvesting still cannot {{be used for the}} fresh mushroom market. The genetic variation in bruising sensitivity (BS) of Agaricus bisporus was studied through an <b>incomplete</b> set of <b>diallel</b> <b>crosses</b> to get insight in the heritability of BS and the combining ability of the parental lines used and, in this way, to estimate their breeding value. To this end nineteen homokaryotic lines recovered from wild strains and cultivars were inter-crossed in a diallel scheme. Fifty-one successful hybrids were grown under controlled conditions, and the BS of these hybrids was assessed. BS was shown to be a trait with a very high heritability. The results also showed that brown hybrids were generally less sensitive to bruising than white hybrids. The diallel scheme allowed to estimate the general combining ability (GCA) for each homokaryotic parental line and to estimate the specific combining ability (SCA) of each hybrid. The line with the lowest GCA is seen as the most attractive donor for improving resistance to bruising. The line gave rise to hybrids sensitive to bruising having the highest GCA value. The highest negative SCA possibly indicates heterosis effects for resistance to bruising. This study provides a foundation for estimating breeding value of parental lines to further study the genetic factors underlying bruising sensitivity and other quality-related traits, and to select potential parental lines for further heterosis breeding.

40|$|Most of the {{available}} results on optimal block designs for <b>diallel</b> <b>crosses</b> are based on stan-dard linear model assumptions where the general combining ability effects are taken as fixed. In many practical situations, this assumption may not be tenable since often one studies only a sample of inbred lines from a possibly large (hypothetical) population.
