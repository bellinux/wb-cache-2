5|$|A {{wide range}} of birds were eaten, {{including}} swans, peafowl, quail, partridge, storks, cranes, larks, linnets and other songbirds that could be trapped in nets, and <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>any</b> other wild bird that could be hunted. Swans and peafowl were domesticated to some extent, but were only eaten by the social elite, and more praised for their fine appearance as stunning entertainment dishes, entremets, than for their meat. As today, geese and ducks had been domesticated but were not as popular as the chicken, the fowl equivalent of the pig. Curiously enough the barnacle goose was believed to reproduce not by laying eggs like other birds, but by growing in barnacles, and was hence considered acceptable food for fast and Lent. But at the Fourth Council of the Lateran (1215), Pope Innocent III explicitly prohibited the eating of barnacle geese during Lent, arguing that they lived and fed like ducks and so were of the same nature as other birds.|$|E

For the organization there can be many aspects to virtualization, depending on technology infrastructure and corporate strategy.

The virtualization reduces energy costs provides power savings, maximizes the use of hardware, and improves overall cost efficiencies. Virtualization isn’t <b>just</b> <b>about</b> servers <b>any</b> more. With new solutions, organizations can virtualize everything from desktops (to increase security or decrease deployment issues) to storage (for increased performance, reliability, and flexibility). A successful virtualization strategy requires organizations to take an integrated approach to both virtualization and management. Maintaining performance in times when resources could fluctuate is important. Virtualization allows organization to consolidate some of legacy applications into a single. Virtualization provides significant benefits {{in terms of being}} able to respond quickly to need for more resources or more-isolated resources. virtualization, cloud computing, desktop virtualization, server virtualization, storage virtualization...|$|R

In many gasification processes most of the inorganic components of the input material, such as metals and minerals, are retained in the ash. In some gasification processes (slagging gasification) this ash has the form of a glassy solid with low leaching properties, but the net power production in slagging gasification is low (sometimes negative) and costs are higher.|$|E
50|$|Racing resumed {{at the end}} of {{the sixth}} lap, with Félix da Costa holding onto the lead from Rosenqvist, despite {{pressure}} all the way to Lisboa turn from the pit straight. Lynn and Wehrlein fell in behind, with Nasr completing the top five, while Derani moved past Marciello for seventh place with a move down the inside under braking for Lisboa corner and later got the better of team-mate Tincknell for sixth position. At the front, Félix da Costa had enough of an advantage to <b>just</b> <b>about</b> negate <b>any</b> threat that Rosenqvist could have made with the slipstream while Lynn continued his Macau initiation with a solid third place with Wehrlein doing likewise in fourth. Down the order, Harvey was another retiree in the pit lane due to front wing damage suffered on his Carlin car. The top five continued in their positions as the laps were continually racked off; with two laps to go, Hirakawa crashed at R Bend and was collected by Auer and left extensive debris from the corner all the way to the start-finish line. The safety car was not called for, but yellow flags were in effect until the end through that section of the course. Da Costa recorded the fastest lap of the main race on lap 11, completing a circuit in two minutes and 13.507 seconds.|$|R
40|$|This thesis dedicates {{to explore}} {{establishing}} effective communication with Chinese vendors for Western companies who outsourcing production to China. An effective communication with Chinese vendors refers {{to gain the}} true understanding, right decision and expected reaction from Chinese vendors, after they receive the managerial or communicational messages (e. g. contract or piecemeal instructions) sent by Western buyers/clients. Establishing effective communication with Chinese vendors is not <b>just</b> <b>about</b> communication <b>any</b> more, {{it is about the}} outsourcing management from a micromanagement to self-management level. Creating intercultural competence is also the core. The study has not only built up a multiple-categorised structure for analysing outsourcing management and communication, also generated three new attributes for effective communication with Chinese vendors i. e. ―cooperativeness‖, ―competency‖, ―specialisation‖, the other six are ―effective medium‖, ―timeliness‖, ―accuracy‖, ―consistency‖, ―credibility‖, and ―completeness‖. The quintessence of the research is that a New Model of ―effective communication with Chinese vendors‖ has been formed through the research. By following the model, a company can easily identify its development stage of effective communication establishment with Chinese vendors and predict its future communication and management orientation. Also the study is desirable for those entrepreneurs and academic researchers who are interested in outsourcing production or have the intent to really carry out an outsourcing strategy and project to China. Moreover the conclusions can inspire companies within similar environment to create their own effective method when outsourcing production to China...|$|R
40|$|It is an axiom of {{historical}} linguistics, and indeed historical studies generally, that our present-day assumptions {{are not a}} reliable basis for the analysis and interpretation of language data from earlier periods.

But those very assumptions interact with the phenomena to which they pertain, and together they change over time. Present-day assumptions form the endpoint of diachronic change. The first task for the historian is to describe earlier states of the language and its contexts, including the likely assumptions of contemporaries, and begin to understand why it is as it is. The second task is to explain the processes of change which have led to the current situation today. This paper aims to show how present-day assumptions about early modern play-texts are inappropriate or misleading. It explores how the dialogue of earlier plays was shaped by particular manuscript practices, and compares this with the dialogue of present-day plays that are shaped by the context of printing...|$|R

5000|$|Converged Identities:An {{operational}} issue emerges with 3G IMS and SIP and converged services.

This flexibility means that a SIP call can be made from <b>just</b> <b>about</b> anything to <b>any</b> other thing providing it is entitled to do so. As SIP can apply a mixture of these Internet and Telephone system identifiers in the call process, it follows that the SDP must tightly couple its SIP processing with the DHCP/DNS system, the HSS mobile database, the User authorization system, the presence event system, the user's address book, telephone call feature processing and the operator's service/product management with its entitlement system - all in real time.
