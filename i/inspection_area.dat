40|$|On April 22, 2005, NIOSH {{received}} a union request asking NIOSH to evaluate heat stress and CO exposures for CBP officers {{working in the}} outdoor vehicle <b>inspection</b> <b>areas</b> at the CBP ports of entry in El Paso, Texas. The request indicated that some officers had experienced heat cramps and heat exhaustion. In response, NIOSH investigators monitored heat stress, heat strain, and CO in air and exhaled breath on August 29 - September 2, 2005, at the Bridge of the Americas and Paso del Norte ports of entry in El Paso, Texas. At {{the time of our}} evaluation we found that officers working in the outdoor vehicle <b>inspection</b> <b>areas</b> were not exposed to heat stress that exceeded NIOSH and ACGIH recommendations. None of the officers monitored for heat strain showed signs of excessive heat stress exposure. However, environmental temperatures are often warmer in El Paso than they were on the days of our evaluations. Higher temperatures would increase the likelihood that occupational heat stress recommendations could be exceeded and that employees could be at increased risk of heat strain. The NIOSH recommended exposure limit ceiling for CO was exceeded for some of the officers working in the outdoor vehicle <b>inspection</b> <b>areas.</b> This REL was exceeded when the officers inspected the vehicle 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s undercarriage near the exhaust pipe. None of the officers monitored exceeded the full shift TWA occupational exposure limits for CO or the limits for COHb. Investigators recommended creating a formal heat stress management program that includes information on heat acclimatization and heat stress prevention. Management should monitor environmental heat exposure and develop criteria for heat alerts. Investigators also recommended turning off vehicles in primary inspection lanes, creating a hazard communication program for working around vehicle exhaust, continuing to use officer rotation schedules, and periodically monitoring officers 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 CO exposures.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{decision}} tree model for evaluation {{of the next generation}} radiation portal technology (Advanced Spectroscopic Portals or ASPs) to scan containers entering the United States non-intrusively against nuclear or radiological weapons. Advanced Spectroscopic Portals are compared against the current designs of portal monitors (plastic scintillators or PVTs). We consider five alternative deployment strategies: 1) Exclusive deployment of ASPs replacing all the PVTs currently deployed at U. S. ports of entry, 2) Sequential deployment of ASPs with PVTs installing ASPs in all secondary and some primary <b>inspections</b> <b>areas,</b> 3) Sequential deployment of ASPs with PVTs installing APs in only secondary <b>inspections</b> <b>areas,</b> 4) Exclusive deployment of PVTs, 5) Stop deployment of new portal monitors and continue inspections with the current capacity. The baseline solution recommends a hybrid strategy that supports the deployment of new designs of portal monitors for secondary inspections and current designs of portal through ports of entry, the probability of successful detonation, detection probabilities and the extra deterrence that each alternative may provide. We also illustrate that the list of most significant parameters depends heavily on the dollar equivalent of overall consequences and the probability of attack attempt. For low probability and low consequence scenarios, false alarm related parameters are found to have more significance. Our extensive exploratory analysis shows that for most parametric combinations, continued deployment of portal monitors is recommended. Exclusive deployment of ASPs is optimal under high risk scenarios. However, we also show that if ASPs fail to improve detection capability, then extra benefits they offer in reducing false alarms may not justify their mass deployment...|$|R
