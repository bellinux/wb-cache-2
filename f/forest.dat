5|$|Forests {{were special}} areas {{of land in}} medieval England, owned by the Crown and subject to <b>forest</b> law. They were often {{selected}} because of their natural resources, and were expected to provide the Crown with a flow of money or raw materials. In 1195, the <b>Forest</b> of Dartmoor extended across all of Devon, but in 1204 John curtailed {{the extent of the}} royal <b>forest,</b> removing much of Devon from <b>Forest</b> Law and leaving the area known in the modern period as Dartmoor. This reduced <b>forest</b> was still subject to the <b>Forest</b> Laws, involving a specialised group of legal officials who met at Lydford Castle to impose fines and other punishments. Probably both Lydford Castle and the <b>forest</b> was given to the Sheriff of Devon, William Brewer, in 1216. The arrangement changed under Henry III, when the estates were given to Richard, the Earl of Cornwall in 1239. Legally, this meant that the <b>Forest</b> of Dartmoor was converted to a chase, although the Earls of Cornwall continued to hold law courts at Lydford Castle, enforcing chase laws that closely resembled the former <b>Forest</b> Laws.|$|E
