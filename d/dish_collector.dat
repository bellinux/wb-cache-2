5000|$|A solar powered Stirling {{engine is}} a heat engine {{powered by a}} {{temperature}} gradient generated by the sun. It was patented by Roelf J. Meijer in 1987.His invention relates a heat engine, such as a Stirling cycle engine, with a solar <b>dish</b> <b>collector</b> {{in order to produce}} electricity. This apparatus consists of a large dish aimed at the sun to reflect the rays into the focus point, which is located {{at the center of the}} dish. Solar energy is then collected in the form of heat to fuel a Stirling cycle engine, [...] which operates by letting heat flow from a hot source to a cold sink in order to do work. The work output of the Stirling cycle is then used to drive a generator and create electric power. Moreover, in Meijer’s solar-powered engine, it is important that the dish always be pointed directly at the sun so that no shadows would be present in the solar <b>dish</b> <b>collector,</b> hence optimizing heat collection. This is where he ran into some issues because, in order for the apparatus to have a complete range of motion, lubrication and rotational systems would be necessary and may compromise structural stability.|$|E

The thermal power systems project which emphasizes the development of cost effective systems which will accelerate the commercialization and industrialization of plants up to 10 MWe, using parabolic <b>dish</b> <b>collectors</b> is described. The projected size of the isolated load market in the 1990 - 2000 time period is 300 to 1000 MW/year. Although this market is small in comparison to the grid connected utility market, it is indicated that by assuming only a 20 percent market penetration, up to 10, 000 power modules per year would be required to meet this need. At a production rate of 25, 000 units/year and assuming no energy storage, levelized bus bar energy costs of 75 mills/kWeh are projected. These numbers are based on what is believed to be a conservative estimate regarding engine-generator conversion efficiency (40 percent) for the 1990 time period. With a more optimistic estimate of efficiency (i. e., 45 percent), the bus bar cost decreases to about 67 mills/kWeh.
