5|$|After its {{victory in}} the Seven Years' War (1756–1763), the British Empire was deeply in debt. Looking for new sources of revenue, the British Parliament sought, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> <b>to</b> {{directly}} tax the colonies, beginning with the Sugar Act of 1764. The earlier Molasses Act of 1733, a tax on shipments from the West Indies, had produced hardly any revenue because it was widely bypassed by smuggling, which {{was seen as a}} victimless crime.|$|E

5|$|Although this {{question}} is brought up now <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> be decided by this Court, we consider it as having been long since settled in public opinion. In no other case for many years has this jurisdiction been asserted, and the general acquiescence of legal men shows the prevalence of opinion {{in favor of the}} negative of the proposition.|$|E
5|$|During the 1991–92 season, Canisius {{compiled}} an 8–22 record {{prior to}} Beilein's arrival. In 1992, Beilein arrived at Canisius College {{as head coach}} for the 1992–93 season, and was able <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> hire assistant coaches. A Western New York native, {{he had grown up}} a Canisius basketball fan because his uncle, Joe Niland, had been a former player and coach there. At Canisius—his first Division I coaching position—Beilein reached the NCAA Tournament once and the NIT twice in his five seasons.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, Joan Gamper became club {{president}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> {{save the}} club from bankruptcy. The club had not won since the Campeonato de Cataluña in 1905; this caused their financial trouble. One of his main achievements {{was to help}} Barcelona acquire its own stadium and thus achieve a stable income.|$|E

5|$|The {{formation}} of the Rüstungsstab allowed Speer, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> <b>to</b> consolidate key arms manufacturing projects for the three branches of the Wehrmacht {{under the authority of}} his ministry, further marginalising the Reich Ministry of Aviation. Several departments, including the once powerful Technical Office, were disbanded or transferred to the new task force. The task force oversaw the day-to-day development and production activities relating to the He 162, the Volksjäger ("people's fighter"), as part of the Emergency Fighter Program.|$|E

5|$|The studio {{also put}} {{together}} a trailer of scenes and images strictly from the first three minutes of the film, in which Andrea meets Miranda <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> <b>to</b> be used at previews and film festivals until they could create a more standard trailer drawing from the whole film. But, again, this proved so effective with early audiences it was retained as the main trailer, since it created anticipation {{for the rest of}} the film without giving anything away.|$|E
5|$|Throughout its existence, Christine was {{monitored}} by astronauts in the Skylab 3 project. During this project, active and passive microwave satellite imagery was used <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> determine the wind speed within a tropical cyclone. This was accomplished after {{the removal of}} regions of heavy rain from the data, a factor that gives inaccurate wind readings.|$|E
5|$|After the US Open, del Potro {{played in}} the Davis Cup {{semifinal}} against Serbia, winning both of his rubbers against Janko Tipsarević and world No. 1 Novak Djokovic. This helped Argentina to a 3–2 victory over Serbia in the semifinals, booking {{their place in the}} final. He then {{played in the}} Stockholm Open, losing in the second round to James Blake. He then reached the final in Vienna, losing <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. Despite having won the first set, he eventually lost the final. Del Potro then reached the semifinals of the Valencia Open 500, losing to eventual champion Marcel Granollers. He then withdrew from the Paris Masters due to a shoulder injury, wiping out his chances of qualifying for the Year-End Championships.|$|E
5000|$|Oberkassel {{was first}} {{mentioned}} as Cassele in 722/723 and as Cassela in 1144. The name Oberkassel {{refers to a}} Roman fortification; {{in the course of}} time [...] "Romerkastell" [...] (Roman castle) became [...] "Oberkassel". Oberkassel absorbed the previously separate settlements of Berghoven (mentioned <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> in 873), Büchel (mentioned <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> in 1202), Broich (mentioned <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> in 1306) and Meerhausen (mentioned <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> in 1442).|$|R

5|$|Another one-party cabinet was {{announced}} in January 1992, which prompted large scale protests in Kigali, and finally forced Habyarimana to make real concessions. He promised <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> negotiate with the RPF; a multiparty cabinet formed in April, still dominated by the MRND, but with opposition figures in some key positions. The opposition members of this cabinet met with the RPF, and were successful in negotiating a ceasefire. In July 1992 the rebels agreed to stop fighting, and the parties began a peace negotiation process headquartered in the Tanzanian city of Arusha.|$|E
5|$|At that time, {{the group}} had {{generated}} sales of 620 million Deutsche Mark and employed 22,600 employees. In the mid-1960s Triumph International introduced broad scale electronic data processing. Due to the economic crisis, the company encountered significant difficulties {{for the first time}} at the beginning of the 1970s, meaning the company even had to introduce short-term work. The crisis also affected the company’s tights sales, which they had begun in 1969 and discontinued only three years later. At the same time, Triumph International began <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> produce products from lighter fabrics with fibers such as nylon or lycra.|$|E
5|$|Castro's {{government}} diversified {{its economy}} into biotechnology and tourism, the latter outstripping Cuba's sugar industry as its {{primary source of}} revenue in 1995. The arrival of thousands of Mexican and Spanish tourists led to increasing numbers of Cubans turning to prostitution; officially illegal, Castro refrained from cracking down on prostitution in Cuba, fearing a political backlash. Economic hardship led many Cubans toward religion, both {{in the form of}} Roman Catholicism and Santería. Although long thinking religious belief to be backward, Castro softened his approach to religious institutions and religious people were permitted <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> join the Communist Party. Although he viewed the Roman Catholic Church as a reactionary, pro-capitalist institution, Castro organized a visit to Cuba by Pope John Paul II for January 1998; it strengthened the position of both the Cuban Church and Castro's government.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his return}} from Korea, Bolt was {{assigned}} to the U.S. Navy Bureau of Aeronautics in Washington, D.C. as an aircraft design engineer. In this duty, he was detailed to The Pentagon and a board which reported on aircraft performance and tactics. A press conference was held in September 1953 to welcome him to the position, and during this he recounted stories from his service in Korea <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> local newspapers. Bolt's experiences in World War II and the Korean War were used to help shape air combat doctrine. He worked in this assignment for around a year, until 1954 when he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and moved to the Naval Pilot Test Center at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, in St. Mary's County, Maryland. During this time, he took evening classes at the University of Maryland, eventually earning a Bachelor of Science in Military History.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{construction}} by Col. Parsons in 1861, the ballroom {{in the upper}} story of Wappocomo's stone addition served as the scene of many events and parties. According to tradition, as many as 100 couples have danced on the ballroom's wooden floor since {{its construction}} in 1861. It was the custom of the Parsons family to allow guests who were visiting the mansion <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> write their names and the date of their visit on the mortar between the addition's stone blocks; many of these signatures are still legible.|$|E
5|$|George Trice {{retired in}} 1948 and was succeeded {{by his son}} Derek, who sold Tillingbourne to Trevor Brown in September 1970. In the same year, route {{numbering}} was introduced <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> the three routes then operated. The company made an operating loss in 1969 and 1970, so one route, a local service in Guildford, was withdrawn in October 1971 due to poor usage, and another was cut in frequency. As the Chilworth garage was still owned by Trice, operations were transferred to an open-air site in Gomshall in early 1972.|$|E
