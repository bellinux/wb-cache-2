25|$|The {{increase}} in violence related with organized crime has significantly deteriorated {{the conditions in}} which local <b>journalism</b> <b>is</b> practiced. In {{the first years of the}} 21st century, Mexico was considered the most dangerous country in the world to practice journalism, according to groups like the National Human Rights Commission, Reporters Without Borders, and the Committee to Protect Journalists. Between 2000 and 2012, several dozen journalists, including Miguel Ángel López Velasco, Luis Carlos Santiago, and Valentín Valdés Espinosa, were murdered there for covering narco-related news.|$|E
25|$|Since {{newspapers}} {{began as}} a journal (record of current events), the profession involved {{in the making of}} newspapers began to be called journalism. In the yellow journalism era of the 19th century, many newspapers in the United States relied on sensational stories that were meant to anger or excite the public, rather than to inform. The restrained style of reporting that relies on fact checking and accuracy regained popularity around World War II. Criticism of <b>journalism</b> <b>is</b> varied and sometimes vehement. Credibility is questioned because of anonymous sources; errors in facts, spelling, and grammar; real or perceived bias; and scandals involving plagiarism and fabrication.|$|E

500|$|Play.d {{magazine}} credited Smith with inspiring gamers {{to learn}} more about the game industry and not accept company promotion, as well as turning 1UP from [...] "the bastard child of EGM" [...] to an important part of the Ziff Davis Internet company's gaming network. His style has been described as a [...] "robust, direct approach" [...] to journalism and is known for his scathing attacks on the industry. Smith, however, felt disheartened by the state of game journalism. [...] "Video game <b>journalism</b> <b>is</b> just weird. You have guys married to women in marketing for the games they cover. Video game <b>journalism</b> <b>is</b> still very young, very early, still trying to find out what it is," [...] he said. In an interview with Michael Zenke of The Escapist, Smith said he felt game journalists were treated by developers as another part of the PR plan, with developers sending out information and the journalists [...] "regurgitating" [...] it. Worse, Smith felt that gamers had become used to this sort of information; [...] "We have to be responsible for our actions and held accountable when we manipulate the expectations of gamers," [...] he told Zenke.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally mixed reviews. SFX {{described it}} as an [...] "okay" [...] episode that was reminiscent of the earlier episode [...] "The End of the World." [...] Despite praising Pegg, the theme of [...] "media control," [...] and the Jagrafess, they criticised it for [...] " [...] to capture the imagination" [...] because there was [...] "no real palpable sense of threat" [...] and that human culture looked identical to modern day. Rupert Smith of The Guardian wrote, [...] "Anything that satirises the profession of <b>journalism</b> <b>is</b> all right with me, but this did it with style." [...] Arnold T Blumburg of Now Playing gave [...] "The Long Game" [...] a grade of B-, describing it as [...] "entertaining" [...] and a welcome throwback to the classic series. However, he questioned the developing tradition of the Doctor not being {{the hero of the}} episode and noted that there were some dangling threads. Reviewing the episode in 2013, Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times was more positive, writing that it [...] "acts brilliantly as a satire of the media." [...] He also praised the guest cast and characters and Adam's departure. In 2011, Den of Geek's Mark Harrison wrote that [...] "In retrospect, 'The Long Game' is an underrated and perfectly enjoyable mid-series episode," [...] praising Adam's departure.|$|E

2500|$|The {{term was}} coined in the mid-1890s to {{characterize}} the sensational journalism that used some yellow ink in the circulation war between Joseph Pulitzer's New York World and William Randolph Hearst's New York Journal. The battle peaked from 1895 to about 1898, and historical usage often refers specifically to this period. Both papers were accused by critics of sensationalizing the news in order to drive up circulation, although the newspapers did serious reporting as well. [...] An English magazine in 1898 noted, [...] "All American <b>journalism</b> <b>is</b> not 'yellow', though all strictly 'up-to-date' yellow <b>journalism</b> <b>is</b> American!" ...|$|E

[...] In the words of journalist Bret Stephens, [...] "Moral clarity is a term that doesn't get much traction these days, least of all among journalists, who prefer 'objectivity' and 'balance.' Yet good <b>journalism</b> <b>is</b> more than about separating fact from opinion and being fair. Good <b>journalism</b> <b>is</b> about fine analysis and making distinctions, and this applies as much to moral distinctions as to any others. Because too many reporters today refuse to make moral distinctions, we are left with a journalism whose narrative and analytical failings have become ever more glaring".|$|E
