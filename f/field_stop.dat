25|$|The word stop is {{sometimes}} confusing {{due to its}} multiple meanings. A stop can be a physical object: an opaque part of an optical system that blocks certain rays. The aperture stop is the aperture setting that limits {{the brightness of the}} image by restricting the input pupil size, while a <b>field</b> <b>stop</b> is a stop intended to cut out light that would be outside the desired field of view and might cause flare or other problems if not stopped.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to an aperture stop, a photographic lens may have one or more field stops, which limit the system's field of view. [...] When {{the field of view}} is limited by a <b>field</b> <b>stop</b> in the lens (rather than at the film or sensor) vignetting results; this is only a problem if the resulting field of view is less than was desired.|$|E
50|$|By {{adjustment}} {{of the field}} diaphragm, {{the image of the}} field diaphragm aperture in the sample plane is set to a size slightly larger than the imaged region of the sample (which corresponds in turn to the portion of the sample image thrown into the eyepiece <b>field</b> <b>stop).</b> As the field diaphragm, sample, and eyepiece <b>field</b> <b>stop</b> all lie on conjugate image planes, this adjustment allows the illuminating rays to completely fill the eyepiece field of view, while minimizing the amount of extraneous light which must be blocked by the eyepiece <b>field</b> <b>stop.</b> Such extraneous light scatters inside the system and degrades contrast.|$|E

5000|$|If a {{diagonal}} or Barlow lens is used before the eyepiece, the eyepiece's {{field of view}} may be slightly restricted. This occurs when the preceding lens has a narrower <b>field</b> <b>stop</b> than the eyepiece's, causing the obstruction in the front {{to act as a}} smaller <b>field</b> <b>stop</b> in front of the eyepiece. The precise relationship is given by ...|$|E
50|$|In the Gregorian design, {{the primary}} mirror creates a real image before the {{secondary}} mirror. This allows for a <b>field</b> <b>stop</b> to be placed at this location, so that the light from outside {{the field of view}} does not reach the secondary mirror. This is a major advantage for solar telescopes, where a <b>field</b> <b>stop</b> (Gregorian stop) can reduce the amount of heat reaching the secondary mirror and subsequent optical components. The Solar Optical Telescope on the Hinode satellite is one example of this design.|$|E
50|$|One {{method to}} reduce this {{aberration}} is to insert a <b>field</b> <b>stop</b> (iris) {{in order to}} remove edge light rays. This method, however, greatly decreases the light collecting power of the lens.|$|E

50|$|The second {{formula is}} {{actually}} more accurate, but <b>field</b> <b>stop</b> size {{is not usually}} specified by most manufacturers. The first formula will not be accurate if the field is not flat, or is higher than 60Â° which is common for most ultra-wide eyepiece design.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to an aperture stop, a photographic lens may have one or more field stops, which limit the system's field of view.

5000|$|The {{optical layout}} of a CTIS {{instrument}} is shown at right: a <b>field</b> <b>stop</b> is {{placed at the}} image plane of an objective lens, after which a lens collimates the light before it passes through a disperser (such as a grating or prism). Finally, a re-imaging lens maps the dispersed image of the <b>field</b> <b>stop</b> onto a large-format detector array. Shown here is an example in which the device is imaging the university of Arizona's logo, uses a kinoform grating to disperse the transmitted light, and measures a [...] dispersion pattern on the detector array. After measurement, an algorithm is used to convert the multiplexed (overlapped) two-dimensional data into the three-dimensional datacube (spectrally resolved image). Conceptually, one can consider each of the dispersed images on the detector as a 2D projection of the 3D datacube, in a manner analogous {{to the way in}} which X-ray projections measured by medical computed tomography instruments are used to estimate the 3D volume distribution within a patient's body.|$|E

50|$|Dark {{field and}} phase {{contrast}} setups {{are based on}} an Abbe, aplanatic, or achromatic condenser, but to the light path add a dark <b>field</b> <b>stop</b> or various size phase rings. These additional elements are housed in various ways. In most modern microscope (ca. 1990s-), such elements are housed in sliders that fit into a slot between the illuminator and the condenser lens. Many older microscopes house these elements in a turret-type condenser, these elements are housed in a turret below the condenser lens and rotated into place.|$|E

50|$|This formula also {{indicates}} that, for an eyepiece design with a given apparent field of view, the barrel diameter {{will determine the}} maximum focal length possible for that eyepiece, as no <b>field</b> <b>stop</b> can be larger than the barrel itself. For example, a PlÃ¶ssl with 45Â° apparent field of view in a 1.25 inch barrel would yield a maximum focal length of 35mm. Anything longer requires larger barrel or the view is restricted by the edge, effectively making {{the field of view}} less than 45Â°.|$|E
50|$|The {{field of}} view, often {{abbreviated}} FOV, describes {{the area of}} a target (measured as an angle from the location of viewing) {{that can be seen}} when looking through an eyepiece. The field of view seen through an eyepiece varies, depending on the magnification achieved when connected to a particular telescope or microscope, and also on properties of the eyepiece itself. Eyepieces are differentiated by their <b>field</b> <b>stop,</b> which is the narrowest aperture that light entering the eyepiece must pass through to reach the field lens of the eyepiece.|$|E
5000|$|In optics, a {{diaphragm}} {{is a thin}} opaque structure with an opening (aperture) at its center. The role of the diaphragm is to stop the passage of light, except for the light passing through the aperture. Thus it is also called a stop (an aperture stop, if it limits the brightness of light reaching the focal plane, or a <b>field</b> <b>stop</b> or flare stop for other uses of diaphragms in lenses). The diaphragm {{is placed in the}} light path of a lens or objective, {{and the size of the}} aperture regulates the amount of light that passes through the lens. The centre of the diaphragm's aperture coincides with the optical axis of the lens system.|$|E

50|$|The 1981 {{meeting was}} a chaotic event {{wrapped in the}} midst of the FISA-FOCA war and the poor {{conditions}} of the Zolder circuit, including its very narrow pitlane. During Friday practice, an Osella mechanic was accidentally run over in the pitlane by Argentine Carlos Reutemann (the mechanic, Giovanni Amadeo, died of his injuries the day after the race), and on race day, as a result of the poor conditions of Zolder and the accident on Friday, there was drivers' strike which caused the race to be started later than scheduled. Then, when the race started after yet another delay, there was a starting-grid accident involving an Arrows mechanic: Riccardo Patrese stalled his Arrows on the grid, so his mechanic Dave Luckett jumped onto the circuit to try and start Patrese's car; however, the organizers started the race and the whole field went into motion while Luckett was still on the road. Next, the other Arrows driver, Italian Siegfried Stohr, hit the back of Patrese's car, where Luckett was standing. Luckett was knocked unconscious and laid sprawled on the circuit. Then, when the field reached the pit straight again (by which time Luckett had been removed from the road, although the track still had Stohr's broken Arrows car on the circuit and the surface was littered with debris) a number of track marshals jumped onto the tarmac and frantically waved their arms to try to make the <b>field</b> <b>stop</b> while waving yellow flags instead of red flags. Unfortunately the cars went by at full racing speeds and the drivers, made confused by the messy situation, waved back at the marshals: when they came back again for the third lap they voluntarily stopped themselves. The race was restarted and was won by Reutemann. Luckett survived the incident, but neither Patrese nor Stohr started the second race.|$|E
5000|$|Reflected {{solar energy}} was {{measured}} in six channels to sense color caused by absorption due to chlorophyll, sediments, and gelbstoffe in coastal waters. The CZCS used a rotating plane mirror at a 45 degree angle to the optic axis of a Cassegrain telescope. The mirror scanned 360 degrees but only the 80 degrees of data centered on nadir were collected for ocean color measurements. The instrument viewed deep space and calibration sources during {{the remainder of the}} scan. The incoming radiation was collected by the telescope and divided into two streams by a dichroic beam splitter. One stream was transmitted to a <b>field</b> <b>stop</b> that was also the entrance aperture of a small polychromator. The radiance that entered the polychromator was separated and re-imaged in five wavelengths on five silicon detectors in the focal plane of the polychromator. The other stream was directed to a cooled mercury cadmium telluride detector in the thermal region (10.5-12.5 micrometer). A radiative cooler was used to cool the thermal detector. To avoid sun glint, the scanner mirror was tilted about the sensor pitch axis on command so that the line of sight of the sensor was moved in 2-degree increments up to 20 degrees with respect to the nadir. Spectral bands at 0.443 and 0.670 micrometers centered on the most intense absorption bands of chlorophyll, while the band at 0.550 micrometers centered on the [...] "hinge point," [...] the wavelength of minimum absorption. Ratios of measured energies in these channels were shown to closely parallel surface chlorophyll concentrations. Data from the scanning radiometer were processed, with algorithms developed from the field experiment data, to produce maps of chlorophyll absorption. The temperatures of coastal waters and ocean currents were measured in a spectral band centered at 11.5 micrometers. Observations were made also in two other spectral bands, 0.520 micrometers for chlorophyll correlation and 0.750 micrometers for surface vegetation. The scan width was 1556 km centered on nadir and the ground resolution was 0.825 km at nadir.|$|E
