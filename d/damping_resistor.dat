The direct drive PMSG {{is connected to the}} load through a switch mode rectifier and a vector controlled pulse width modulated (PWM) IGBT-inverter. The generator side switch mode rectifier is controlled to achieve maximum power from the wind. The load side PWM inverter is using a relatively complex vector control scheme to control the amplitude and frequency of the inverter output voltage.

30|$|A filter {{with two}} series {{inductors}} and a shunt capacitor (an LCL filter) is usually applied {{to reduce the}} current harmonics around the switching frequency, because it can achieve good attenuation of the high frequency switching noise by using reasonably small passive filtering devices. One key consideration of the filter is its damping design, since the LCL filter suffers from instability due to the zero impedance at its resonant frequency [2, 3, 4]. Passive damping is a practical choice because it costs little and requires no additional control. A <b>damping</b> <b>resistor</b> is inserted in series with the filter capacitor, and a larger <b>damping</b> <b>resistor</b> gives more effective damping. However, it reduces the attenuation above the resonant frequency and also causes power loss at low frequencies. Therefore, there are always some tradeoffs in LCL filter design.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{control method}} of a {{three-phase}} PWM inverter with LC filter is proposed. The transfer function of LC filter {{is the same}} as that of second-order low pass filter(LPF), which has a zero damping ratio. A simple method of implementing second-order LPF with damping ratio is to add a resistor in an LC circuit. However, in a real power system, adopting <b>damping</b> <b>resistors</b> is impractical because it results in losses proportional to the square of the current flowing through the resistors. Instead of inserting resistors, the proposed control strategy utilizes the measured capacitor voltages to control the oscillation of LC circuit.

LCL filter introduces resonance, which needs to be damped through active or passive methods. Passive damping schemes have less control complexity and are more reliable. This study explores the split-capacitor resistive-inductive (SC-RL) passive damping scheme. The SC-RL damped LCL filter is modelled using state space approach. Using this model, the power loss and damping are analysed. Based on the analysis, the SC-RL scheme is shown to have lower losses than other simpler passive damping methods.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the design and practical implementation of a robust digital current controller for a threephase voltage source grid-connected interleaved inverter. Each phase consists of 6 half-bridge channels connected in parallel. Due to the current ripple cancellation of the interleaving topology, only small output filter capacitors are required which provide high impedance to grid voltage harmonics and hence better current quality compared to traditional 2 -level LCL topology. The current in each inductor is controlled via a single feedback loop. A feedforward loop of the grid voltage is incorporated to compensate for the grid disturbance. To control the high resonance frequency of the filter, high sampling and switching frequencies are required. Alternatively, resistors in series with the filter capacitors are used to provide damping. This method becomes practically possible due to the low magnitude of the current of the capacitors and consequently low power dissipation in the <b>damping</b> <b>resistors.</b> The paper also studies in detail the effects of computational time delay and grid impedance variation on system stability.

This paper investigates the possibility of type testing of MV LBS using synthetic test procedures. The transient recovery voltage (TRV) required is calculated from both IEC and IEEE standards and it is shown that the IEC TRV specification results in a more severe TRV. It is found that testing with a basic Weil circuit requires two-part testing. In one test, a low-amplitude TRV with a fast rate of rise stresses the early region associated with thermal failure. In the other test, a higher-amplitude slowly rising TRV stresses the later dielectric region. However, the two-part test using the unmodified Weil circuit is shown to cause significant TRV overstressing.
