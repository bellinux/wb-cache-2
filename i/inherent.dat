5|$|Littleton {{retired from}} {{teaching}} in 1977 {{to focus on}} his own art. Exploring the <b>inherent</b> qualities of the medium, he worked in series with simple forms {{to draw attention to}} the complex interplay of transparent glass with multiple overlays of thin color.|$|E
5|$|Most known RNA {{thermometers}} {{are located}} in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of messenger RNA encoding heat shock proteins—though it has been suggested this fact may be due, in part, to sampling bias and <b>inherent</b> difficulties of detecting short, unconserved RNA sequences in genomic data.|$|E
5|$|Simplified {{implementations}} {{which require}} less computational power {{are available for}} use in personal decompression computers. These are dominated by perfusion. The <b>inherent</b> biological unsaturation of tissues is considered in the calculations.|$|E
5|$|The writing, {{giving and}} reading of a kvitel is treated very seriously by Hasid and Rebbe alike, and is {{executed}} according to specific protocols. Because of their <b>inherent</b> sanctity, kvitelach {{may not be}} thrown away after use; they are either burned or buried.|$|E
5|$|A {{population}} bottleneck is when {{a population}} contracts to a significantly smaller size over {{a short period of}} time due to some random environmental event. In a true population bottleneck, the odds for survival of any member of the population are purely random, and are not improved by any particular <b>inherent</b> genetic advantage. The bottleneck can result in radical changes in allele frequencies, completely independent of selection.|$|E
5|$|Alexander F. Reichert was {{appointed}} by the Supreme Court to argue the case for Lara. Reichert argued that an Indian tribe had no <b>inherent</b> sovereignty in regards to non-member Indians, but only the power that Congress decided to give the tribe, citing Duro, Wheeler, and Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe to support his argument. He stated {{that it was the}} place of the Supreme Court, not Congress, to determine the <b>inherent</b> sovereignty of the tribe. Lara argued that since the tribe had no such <b>inherent</b> sovereignty, it could only prosecute a non-member Indian based upon federal sovereignty, which would make a subsequent Federal prosecution a violation of the prohibition of double jeopardy. It was noted that members of Indian tribes were at the same time United States citizens, and protected under the constitution {{in the same manner as}} any other citizen. Reichert stated that Duro was decided as a constitutional issue, not as a matter of common law, and it was the Court's place to determine the issue, not the place of Congress. To subject Lara to a prosecution by a tribal court, which was not subject to the Bill of Rights, would deprive Lara of his rights as a United States citizen. Lara's position was supported by amicus curiae briefs filed by the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, Lewis County, Idaho, (along with several other counties), the Citizen's Equal Rights Foundation, and T. Morris, E. Morris, and R. Morris (individual Indians).|$|E
5|$|Ancient writers {{believed}} that the worship of Terminus had been introduced to Rome {{during the reign of}} the first king Romulus (traditionally 753717 BC) or his successor Numa (717673 BC). Modern scholars have variously seen it as the survival of an early animistic reverence for the power <b>inherent</b> in the boundary marker, or as the Roman development of proto-Indo-European belief in a god concerned with the division of property.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{has been}} {{nominated}} for six Academy Awards {{over the course of}} his career, while his works have earned a further fourteen Academy Award nominations and two wins for cast and crew. There Will Be Blood has been named by several critics as the best film of the 2000s. It later ranked, along with The Master and <b>Inherent</b> Vice, in the BBC's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{a design}} flaw, ships of this class have <b>inherent</b> lists to {{starboard}} when under combat loads that exceed {{the capability of}} their list control systems. The problem appears to be especially prevalent {{on some of the}} more modern vessels. This problem has been previously rectified by using damage control voids for ballast, but a solution using solid ballast which does not affect the ship's survivability has been proposed.|$|E
5|$|He {{drew and}} painted {{numerous}} preparatory sketches while deciding which of several alternative {{moments of the}} disaster he would depict in the final work. The painting's conception proved slow and difficult for Géricault, and he struggled to select a single pictorially effective moment to best capture the <b>inherent</b> drama of the event.|$|E
5|$|Justice John Paul Stevens wrote a {{concurring opinion}} that {{argued that the}} Indian tribes have a {{stronger}} claim on <b>inherent</b> sovereign powers than do individual states. He noted that the Indian tribes governed themselves since before Columbus arrived, and that most states never governed themselves outside of the United States.|$|E
5|$|Justice Stephen Breyer {{delivered}} {{the opinion of}} the court on April 19, 2004. Breyer believed that the question the Court needed to answer was whether Congress had the authority to relax restrictions that had been imposed on an Indian tribe's <b>inherent</b> sovereignty. He noted that the intent of Congress was clear, not only based on the plain language of the statute, but also from its legislative history.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald {{suggests}} thatunlike Wagner, Alkan did {{not seek}} to refashion the world through opera; nor, like Berlioz, to dazzle the crowds by putting orchestral music {{at the service of}} literary expression; nor even, as with Chopin or Liszt, to extend the field of harmonic idiom. Armed with his key instrument, the piano, he sought incessantly to transcend its <b>inherent</b> technical limits, remaining apparently insensible to the restrictions which had withheld more restrained composers.|$|E
5|$|Media in the Eastern Bloc was {{an organ}} of the state, {{completely}} reliant on and subservient to the communist party, with radio and television organizations being state-owned, while print media was usually owned by political organizations, mostly by the local communist party. Soviet propaganda used Marxist philosophy to attack capitalism, claiming labor exploitation and war-mongering imperialism were <b>inherent</b> in the system.|$|E
5|$|Merrion v. Jicarilla Apache Tribe, 455 U.S. 130 (1982), {{was a case}} {{in which}} the Supreme Court of the United States holding that an Indian tribe has the {{authority}} to impose taxes on non-Indians that are conducting business on the reservation as an <b>inherent</b> power under their tribal sovereignty.|$|E
5|$|New {{classical}} economics {{had pointed}} out the <b>inherent</b> contradiction of the neoclassical synthesis: Walrasian microeconomics with market clearing and general equilibrium could not lead to Keynesian macroeconomics where markets failed to clear. New Keynesians recognized this paradox, but, while the new classicals abandoned Keynes, new Keynesians abandoned Walras and market clearing.|$|E
5|$|Richard {{severely}} curtailed {{tobacco production}} {{in favor of}} more sustainable crops, including wheat, corn, rye, and barley. This reduced the soil depletion <b>inherent</b> to tobacco production, and allowed for the practice of crop rotation. He also planted fruit orchards, including peach and apple trees, which he used to produce spirits. In 1801 Richard constructed a dairy, which ran primarily under the supervision of his wife Elizabeth Collins Lee.|$|E

She {{reflects on the}} nature of her marriages and looks back on her prior self-indulgent lifestyle. She explains to the reader how personal achievement may result from the allure of success, and simultaneously cautions against harmful byproducts of behavioral insecurity <b>inherent</b> in the mystique of celebrity.|$|E
5|$|Since medical {{literature}} began to describe homosexuality, {{it has often}} been approached from a view that sought to find an <b>inherent</b> psychopathology as the root cause, influenced by the theories of Sigmund Freud. Although he considered bisexuality <b>inherent</b> in all people, and said that most have phases of homosexual attraction or experimentation, exclusive same-sex attraction he attributed to stunted development resulting from trauma or parental conflicts. Much literature on mental health and lesbians centered on their depression, substance abuse, and suicide. Although these issues exist among lesbians, discussion about their causes shifted after homosexuality was removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual in 1973. Instead, social ostracism, legal discrimination, internalization of negative stereotypes, and limited support structures indicate factors homosexuals face in Western societies that often adversely affect their mental health.|$|E
5|$|The Glorious First of June {{demonstrated}} {{a number of}} the major problems <b>inherent</b> in the French and British navies {{at the start of the}} Revolutionary Wars. Both admirals were faced with disobedience from their captains, along with ill-discipline and poor training among their shorthanded crews, and they failed to control their fleets effectively during the height of the combat.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court {{unanimously}} {{upheld the}} Missouri voting legislation, saying that voting {{was not an}} <b>inherent</b> right of citizenship, that the Constitution neither granted nor forbade voting rights for women, and that allowing only male citizens to vote was not an infringement of Minor's rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|E
5|$|The United States will {{continue}} to stand by these principles, because of the conviction of the American people that unless the doctrine in which these principles are <b>inherent</b> once again governs the relations between nations, the rule of reason, of justice and of law – in other words, the basis of modern civilization itself – cannot be preserved.|$|E
5|$|The {{ambiguity}} <b>inherent</b> in the IAU's definition was {{highlighted in}} December 2005, when the Spitzer Space Telescope observed Cha 110913-773444 (above), only eight times Jupiter's mass with {{what appears to}} be the beginnings of its own planetary system. Were this object found in orbit around another star, it would have been termed a planet.|$|E
5|$|The carbon–fluorine bond is organic chemistry's strongest, {{and gives}} {{stability}} to organofluorines. It is almost non-existent in nature, but {{is used in}} artificial compounds. Research {{in this area is}} usually driven by commercial applications; the compounds involved are diverse and reflect the complexity <b>inherent</b> in organic chemistry.|$|E
5|$|The creatures {{each have}} unique {{cultural}} identities {{and a sense}} of loyalty towards their <b>inherent,</b> traditional practices. The main characters comprise a royal family that includes King Ploobis, Queen Peuta, and a male child named Wiss. There are also a male servant named Scred, a female servant named Vazh, and a rock prophet named the Mighty Favog. Scred acts like a fervent supporter of dim-witted King Ploobis, while Vazh displays flirtatious qualities.|$|E
5|$|The {{electrostatic}} design does {{away with}} two major weaknesses of boxed speakers: enclosure colourations and signal degradation {{due to the}} crossover. The crossover in the ESL consists merely of resistors which work with the <b>inherent</b> capacitance of the speaker elements to obtain a first-order response. Because it is bipolar, {{both sides of the}} elements are not enclosed, but radiate directly into the air. Thus, colourations due to crossover components and box-induced reflections are minimised.|$|E
5|$|The idea {{of planets}} {{has evolved over}} its history, from the divine lights of antiquity to the earthly objects of the {{scientific}} age. The concept has expanded to include worlds {{not only in the}} Solar System, but in hundreds of other extrasolar systems. The ambiguities <b>inherent</b> in defining planets have led to much scientific controversy.|$|E
5|$|These powers {{included}} {{the ability to}} both restrict tribal powers or to relax such restrictions. Congress has done both, {{such as in the}} withdrawal of federal recognition of the Menominee tribe with the Menominee Termination Act in 1954, and the Menominee Restoration Act to restore tribal recognition and powers. The earlier decisions in Duro, Wheeler, and Oliphant dealt with cases where Congress had restricted a tribe's <b>inherent</b> powers but pointed at nothing in the Constitution or established precedent that prohibits Congress from relaxing such restrictions. The decision in Duro was one of federal common law, and it is clear that Congress has the power to change that law. Since the power exercised by the Spirit Lake Sioux Tribe was that of <b>inherent</b> tribal sovereignty, double jeopardy did not attach.|$|E
5|$|While the High Court has <b>inherent</b> {{power to}} judicially review the {{decisions}} of inferior courts and other administrative bodies, one High Court judge may not judicially review a decision of another High Court judge, nor may the High Court judicially review decisions of the Court of Appeal.|$|E
25|$|Newton {{had also}} {{specifically}} attributed the <b>inherent</b> power of inertia to matter, against the mechanist thesis that matter has no <b>inherent</b> powers. But whereas Newton vehemently denied gravity was an <b>inherent</b> power of matter, his collaborator Roger Cotes made gravity also an <b>inherent</b> power of matter, as {{set out in}} his famous preface to the Principia's 1713 second edition which he edited, and contradicted Newton himself. And it was Cotes's interpretation of gravity rather than Newton's that came to be accepted.|$|E
25|$|An abugida is an {{alphabetic}} {{writing system}} whose basic signs denote consonants with an <b>inherent</b> vowel and where consistent modifications {{of the basic}} sign indicate other following vowels than the <b>inherent</b> one.|$|E
25|$|It is an abugida {{in which}} all {{consonant}}s have an <b>inherent</b> vowel. Diacritics, which can appear above, below, {{before or after the}} consonant they belong to, are used to change the <b>inherent</b> vowel.|$|E
25|$|Chakma {{is of the}} Brahmic type: the {{consonant}} letters {{contain an}} <b>inherent</b> vowel. Unusually for Brahmic scripts, the <b>inherent</b> vowel in Chakma is a long 'ā' (aː) as opposed to short 'a' (ə) which is standard in most other languages of India such as Hindi, Marathi or Tamil. Consonant clusters are written with conjunct characters, and a visible vowel killer shows the deletion of the <b>inherent</b> vowel {{when there is no}} conjunct.|$|E
25|$|The many {{different}} types of electrolytic capacitors show differences in electrical long-term behavior, their <b>inherent</b> failure modes, and their self-healing mechanism. Application rules for types with an <b>inherent</b> failure mode are specified to ensure capacitors with high reliability and long life.|$|E
