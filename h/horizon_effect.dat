40|$|Three essays {{compose the}} dissertation. In the first essay, {{entitled}} 2 ̆ 2 Interest Rate Rules, Endogenous Fluctuations and Chaotic Dynamics in Open Economies 2 ̆ 2 (joint with Luis-Felipe Zanna), we study {{the consequences for}} global equilibrium determinacy of implementing active interest rate rules (i. e. whereby the nominal interest rate responds more than proportionally to changes in inflation) in flexible-price open economies. We show that conditions under which these rules generate aggregate instability by inducing cyclical and chaotic equilibrium dynamics depend on particular characteristics of open economies such as the degree of (trade) openness {{and the degree of}} exchange rate pass-through. We find that a forward-looking rule is more prone to induce endogenous cyclical and chaotic dynamics the more open the economy and the higher the degree of exchange rate pass-through. The results persist under a contemporaneous rule, as well as for different degrees of international financial markets completeness. The second essay, entitled 2 ̆ 2 Monetary Policy Rules and Indeterminacy in Dollarized Open Economies 2 ̆ 2, studies the implications of both an interest rate and a constant money growth rule in a small open economy which is subject to currency substitution. We show that equilibrium determinacy depends not only on the policy parameters but also on the degree of dollarization, the complementarity between the domestic and the foreign currency, the degree of international capital mobility and the extent of network externalities {{in the use of the}} foreign currency. The third essay, entitled 2 ̆ 2 Real Exchange Rate Mean Reversion and International Portfolio Allocation 2 ̆ 2 (joint with Marcos Buscaglia), assesses whether mean reversion in real exchange rates (RER) can induce <b>horizon</b> <b>effects</b> in international portfolio allocation. We estimate and introduce a long memory (ARFIMA) RER model into an optimal portfolio allocation framework where a representative investor can access domestic and international stocks. Our results show that there are significant <b>horizon</b> <b>effects</b> for the buy and hold investor, and that they depend upon the initial value of the RER compared to its long run value. <b>Horizon</b> <b>effects</b> disappear for the optimal rebalancing case.

Using quarterly data from 1970 Q 4 to 2006 Q 4, {{it turns out}} that bonds, equities and bills returns are actually predictable.

The VAR parameters estimates are then used to compute real returns conditional volatility across investment horizons. The results reveal the same kind of <b>horizon</b> <b>effect</b> as the one found in recent empirical studies using quarterly U. S. data. More specifically, the annualized standard deviation of French stocks returns goes down from 22 % for a 1 -year horizon to only 2. 8 % for a 25 -year investment horizon.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} corruption and political stability, from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. We propose a model of incumbent behavior that features the interplay of two effects : A <b>horizon</b> <b>effect,</b> whereby greater instability leads the incumbent to embezzle more during his short window of opportunity; and a demand effect, by which {{the private sector is}} more willing to bribe stable incumbents. The <b>horizon</b> <b>effect</b> dominates at low levels of stability, since firms are unwilling to pay high bribes and unstable incumbents have strong incentives to embezzle, whereas the demand effect gains salience in more stable regimes. Together, these two effects generate a nonmonotonic, U-shaped relationship between total corruption and stability. On the empirical side, we find a robust U-shaped pattern between country indices of corruption perception and various measures of incumbent stability, including historically-observed average tenures of chief executives and governing parties : Regimes that are very stable or very unstable display higher levels of corruption when compared to those in an intermediate range of stability. These results suggest that minimizing corruption may require an electoral system that features some reelection incentives, but with an eventual term limit. corruption, Political Stability, Incumbent Tenure, Term Limits...|$|E
40|$|We {{examine how}} the {{evidence}} of the time-varying volatility in stock returns affects optimal dynamic portfolio choice of investors with long horizons. As return volatility shows a relatively small correlation with realized return, its time-variation is expected to cause little, if any, hedging demand (in the sense of Merton (1973)). However, we find that, once transaction costs are taken into account in portfolio rebalancing, the time varying monthly return volatility produces significant <b>horizon</b> <b>effect</b> with stock allocations despite the negligible hedging demand. The driving force of this surprising result is newly identified in our study, and differs from the hedging demand documented in earlier studies (e. g. Brennan,Schwartz, and Lagnado (1997) and Barberis (2000)). Moreover, the <b>horizon</b> <b>effect</b> is found to be state-dependent, and could be either positive or strikingly negative, depending on the current value of return volatility. This leads to a reduced sensitivity of the initial optimal stock allocation to current return volatility {{as a function of the}} expected portfolio holding period.
