25|$|<b>Interesting</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{fact that}} Heilbronn sports three colours in its flag. Newly {{dedicated}} municipal flags in Baden-Württemberg only use two colours. According to State municipal laws, Heilbronn's flag was grandfathered {{as it had}} been in use prior to 1935.|$|E
25|$|More <b>interesting</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{understanding}} that the sums over the energies of standing waves should be formally understood as sums over the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian. This allows atomic and molecular effects, such as the van der Waals force, {{to be understood as}} a variation on the theme of the Casimir effect. Thus one considers the Hamiltonian of a system {{as a function of the}} arrangement of objects, such as atoms, in configuration space. The change in the zero-point energy as a function of changes of the configuration can be understood to result in forces acting between the objects.|$|E
25|$|The {{decoration}} includes stuccoes by Francesco Ferrari (c.1725), and a Cosmatesque pavement. The main altarpiece has a Madonna with Saints Andrew and Gregory (1734) by Antonio Balestra. The second altar on {{the left}} has a Madonna on a Throne with child and four Saints and Blesseds of the Gabrielli family (1739) by Pompeo Batoni. At {{the end of the}} nave, the altar of S. Gregorio Magno has three fine reliefs {{from the end of the}} 15th century by Luigi Capponi. Also <b>interesting</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Salviati Chapel, designed by Francesco da Volterra and finished by Carlo Maderno in 1600: it includes an ancient fresco which, according to the associated tradition, spoke to St. Gregory, and a marble altar (1469) by Andrea Bregno and pupils. The chapel is used by Rome's Romanian community, which follows the Byzantine rite there.|$|E

25|$|Maternal {{sensitivity}} even in {{the first}} few months of mother–child relationships are an important factor to health in childhood, especially with obesity. A study using data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development's Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development assessed mother–child interactions and categorized them in one of two groups: sensitive or insensitive. Their child's growth (height and weight) was monitored throughout their childhood, from 24 months all the way to grade six, and body mass index was calculated. As the children grew, the percentage of overweight or obese grew too. From 24 months the overall overweight-obese percentage was 15.58% and by grade six, 34.34% of the children were classified as overweight or obese. More <b>interesting</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> difference between the maternal sensitive group and the maternal insensitive group. The children with the sensitive mothers started out with an overweight-obese percentage of 14.96% (24 months) and ended the research with 29.54% (grade six). The children classified with insensitive mothers had an overweight-obese percentage of 16.16% at 24 months and 39.28% at grade six. This shows a significant correlation between the mother's sensitivity and the child's risk for overweight-obesity during their elementary years. This is very important for obesity prevention programs for children.|$|E

And the thing is, what she had talked about as well, is that before a concert, what she finds very <b>interesting</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> rehearsals and the straining and maybe {{she would like to}} injure. [...] And she said that the process of making the concert became more intriguing than the final result." ...|$|E
500|$|Producer Nik Korda noted how helpful {{it was to}} have Sean Gunn and Krystian Godlewski portray Rocket and Groot on set, as it {{provided}} references for lighting and on-set performances to the animators. When creating Groot, MPC realized early on that his eyes would be essential in maintaining the character's human qualities, as his face couldn't move in the way that humans' do. MPC visual effects supervisor Nicolas Aithadi explained that, [...] "When you look at humans what makes the eyes <b>interesting</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> imperfections – trying to make these two irises not aimed at the same place – trying to make them strange and look more human." [...] Textures for Groot came from a number of sources, including inspiration from a botanical garden in London, and the character was modeled as individual branches, rigged individually, to simulate a muscle system for the character.|$|E

500|$|Inspiration {{to work on}} Her Story {{stemmed from}} Barlow's {{disappointment}} of other detectives games: he felt that L.A. Noire (2011) never allowed him to feel like [...] "the awesome detective who was having to read things and follow up threads of investigation", and he called the Ace Attorney series (2001–present) [...] "rigidity". When Barlow began development on Her Story, he added more typical game aspects, but the game mechanics became more minimalist as development progressed. The initial plan for the game was for players to work towards a definitive resolution, ultimately solving the crime. However, when Barlow tested the concept on pre-existing interview transcripts of convicted murderer Christopher Porco, he began to discover themes surfacing within the interviews, particularly relating {{to the concept of}} money, which was ultimately a large factor in Porco's trial. He took this concept of recurring themes and threads, and decided to [...] "move beyond the clearly scripted stuff" [...] when developing Her Story. Barlow felt that the story's appeal was the ambiguity of the investigation, comparing Her Story to the podcast Serial (2014–present), which he listened to late in development. He found that the attraction of Serial was the lack of a definitive solution, noting that [...] "people lean towards certain interpretations ... what makes it <b>interesting</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> extent to which it lives on in your imagination".|$|E
500|$|Nekeeta Borden of Zap2it was {{favorable}} of {{the early}} pairing of Tucker and Ashley, giving them an [...] "honorable mention" [...] {{on a list of}} [...] "curiously quirky couplings". Candace Young of the website She Knows Soaps wrote that, [...] "Ashley and Tucker have been interesting as a power couple, if you will, in business and the corporate world." [...] In January 2011, Garrett awarded Nichols a [...] "Leading Men Gold Standard" [...] and praised his portrayal that week, writing: [...] "Stephen Nichols as Tucker was all over the place this week. Initially Tucker decided to back the recording label of Devon Winters and Noah Newman. Nichols played a man who wanted to help two young men break into the music industry. However, the shocking news that Cane and Sofia have been lying to Tucker and allowing a conman to swindle Tucker’s company was destined to be revealed. Although the climax came {{at the end of the}} week, the intensity in which Stephen Nichols played the revelation was exciting to say the least. Fans know that next week Tucker McCall’s going to cause heads to roll." [...] Jae Jones of Yahoo! praised the storyline revealing Tucker as Devon's father as it gave the soap opera's matriarch, Katherine, a biracial grandson. She wrote: [...] "What seems to make the story line even more <b>interesting</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> fact that she has a biracial grandson. Who would have ever thought the show could catch up with the current times? There are not too many daytime soaps left for housewives and house husbands to enjoy, but those who watch this show are always in for a special treat each afternoon." [...] They later named the storyline the [...] "best reveal" [...] of 2011.|$|E

2500|$|The {{collection}} of the responsa of Israel Isserlein, [...] "Terumat ha-Deshen", comprises 354 decisions, which are important as describing many characteristic features of the time. Several of them (Nos. 341-346) discuss the apportionment of the taxes and the assessments, while others {{are concerned with the}} attitude to be observed toward a repentant apostate (No. 198). Particularly <b>interesting</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> responsum (No. 197) devoted to the problem whether Jews might so disguise themselves as to escape recognition in countries where they were absolutely forbidden to reside. He was lenient in cases of widows who lacked a divorce document (agunah).|$|E
2500|$|Kundera's early novels {{explore the}} dual tragic and comic aspects of totalitarianism. He does not view his works, however, as {{political}} commentary. [...] "The condemnation of totalitarianism doesn't deserve a novel," [...] he has said. According to the Mexican novelist Carlos Fuentes, [...] "What he finds <b>interesting</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> similarity between totalitarianism and [...] "the immemorial and fascinating {{dream of a}} harmonious society where private life and public life form but one unity and all are united around one will and one faith." [...] In exploring the dark humor of this topic, Kundera seems deeply influenced by Franz Kafka.|$|E

2500|$|The fort {{was built}} in stages [...] between the 11th and 13th centuries by the dynastic rulers of the region {{including}} the Chalukyas and Hoysalas, later the Nayakas of Chitradurga of the Vijayanagar Empire. The Nayakas of Chitradurga, or Palegar Nayakas, were most responsible {{for the expansion of}} the fort between the 15th and 18th centuries. The fort was taken over for a short while by Hyder Ali at Chitradurga in 1779. The fort was captured by the British forces twenty years later, when they defeated his son Tipu Sultan. The fort is built in a series of seven concentric fortification walls with various passages, a citadel, masjid, warehouses for grains and oil, water reservoirs and ancient temples. There are 18 temples in the upper fort and one huge temple in the lower fort. Among these temples the oldest and most <b>interesting</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Hidimbeshwara temple. The masjid was an addition during Hyder Ali’s rule. The fort's many interconnecting tanks were used to harvest rainwater, and the fort was said to never suffer from a water shortage.|$|E
2500|$|She {{released}} a second book in 2003, titled Sacred Evil: Encounters with the Unknown. The book, which was previously known as Good and Evil, chronicled nine case studies during {{her life as}} a Wiccan healer and gives explanations as to why those events happened. To promote the book, Chakraverti held a healing session at Oxford Bookstore in Kolkata, where she read excerpts from the book, and gave demonstration of her healing skills, holding the hand of a volunteer, tapping her with her athame (wand) and reciting Egyptian chants. After its release, the book received positive reaction from critics. Rajdeep Bains from The Tribune commented [...] "Sacred Evil is a very coherent account of the author’s dealings with witchcraft and sorcery. Unfortunately, it could add to superstition, which is already prevalent at an unhealthy level in our country. As a work of fiction it would have been laudable; given the cover of truth it becomes a dangerous piece of writing. [...] But what makes Sacred Evil so <b>interesting</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> juxtaposition of modern thought with the ageless. After every chapter there are notes on the practices described in it along with modern explanations." [...] Krithika Ranjan from The Hindu commented, [...] "Throughout [...] Chakraverti refers to herself as a skeptic. Yet the stories she tells are bound to raise the ire of [...] rationalists. You can almost hear one spluttering about superstition as you read the story Those who return. [...] In the final analysis, the book is a good read— whether you believe in the dark arts or whether you just want to curl up with a spine chiller." [...] Chakraverti started working on her third book, tentatively titled Every Strong Woman is a Witch.|$|E

6000|$|Now {{this is a}} {{perfectly}} plain piece of brute logic. We need not go into the other delicious things in the article, as when it says that [...] "in old times Parliament had to be protected against Royal invasion by {{the man in the}} street." [...] Parliament has to be protected now against the man in the street. Parliament is simply the most detested and the most detestable of all our national institutions: all that is evident enough.
