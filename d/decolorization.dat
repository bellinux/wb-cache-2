25|$|Molasses Number is {{a measure}} of the degree of <b>decolorization</b> of a {{standard}} molasses solution that has been diluted and standardized against standardized activated carbon. Due to the size of color bodies, the molasses number represents the potential pore volume available for larger adsorbing species. As all of the pore volume may not be available for adsorption in a particular waste water application, and as some of the adsorbate may enter smaller pores, it is not a good measure of the worth of a particular activated carbon for a specific application. Frequently, this parameter is useful in evaluating a series of active carbons for their rates of adsorption. Given two active carbons with similar pore volumes for adsorption, the one having the higher molasses number will usually have larger feeder pores resulting in more efficient transfer of adsorbate into the adsorption space.|$|E

The presence of an antigen {{on the surface of}} the blood cells is indicated by agglutination. An alternative system for blood type determination involving no antibodies was developed in 2017 at Imperial College London which makes use of paramagnetic molecularly imprinted polymer nanoparticles with affinity for specific blood antigens. [...] In these tests, rather than agglutination, a positive result is indicated by <b>decolorization</b> as red blood cells which bind to the nanoparticles are pulled toward a magnet and removed from solution.|$|E

5000|$|Ozone is a gas {{used for}} {{disinfecting}} water, laundry, foods, air, and surfaces. It is chemically aggressive and destroys many organic compounds, resulting in rapid <b>decolorization</b> and deodorization {{in addition to}} disinfection. Ozone decomposes relatively quickly. However, due to this characteristic of ozone, tap water chlorination cannot be entirely replaced by ozonation, as the ozone would decompose already in the water piping. Instead, {{it is used to}} remove the bulk of oxidizable matter from the water, which would produce small amounts of organochlorides if treated with chlorine only. Regardless, ozone has a very wide range of applications from municipal to industrial water treatment due to its powerful reactivity.|$|E
50|$|When a decolorizer such as {{alcohol or}} acetone is added, it {{interacts with the}} lipids of the cell membrane. A gram-negative cell loses its outer {{lipopolysaccharide}} membrane, and the inner peptidoglycan layer is left exposed. The CV-I complexes are washed from the gram-negative cell along with the outer membrane. In contrast, a gram-positive cell becomes dehydrated from an ethanol treatment. The large CV-I complexes become trapped within the gram-positive cell due to the multilayered nature of its peptidoglycan. The <b>decolorization</b> step is critical and must be timed correctly; the crystal violet stain is removed from both gram-positive and negative cells if the decolorizing agent is left on too long (a matter of seconds).|$|E

50|$|The Mycobacteria have a cell {{envelope}} {{which is}} not typical of gram-positives or gram-negatives. The mycobacterial cell envelope does not consist of the outer membrane characteristic of gram-negatives, but has a significant peptidoglycan-arabinogalactan-mycolic acid wall structure which provides an external permeability barrier. Therefore, there {{is thought to be}} a distinct 'pseudoperiplasm' compartment between the cytoplasmic membrane and this outer barrier. The nature of this compartment is not well understood. Acid-fast bacteria, like Mycobacteria, are resistant to <b>decolorization</b> by acids during staining procedures. The high mycolic acid content of Mycobacteria, is responsible for the staining pattern of poor absorption followed by high retention. The most common staining technique used to identify acid-fast bacteria is the Ziehl-Neelsen stain or acid-fast stain, in which the acid fast bacilli are stained bright red and stand out clearly against a blue background.|$|E

Both the enzymes had lower <b>decolorization</b> % for azo-carmin (30 – 33 %). During <b>decolorization</b> treatment, both natural dyes and titan yellow formed precipitates which settled down and were removed by centrifugation. The enhancement of the <b>decolorization</b> % of the most tested dyes by treatment with POL and HRP was reported in the presence of some redox mediators.

Laccase activity was inhibited by monovalent ions (Li+, Na+, K+ and Ag+) but the presence of divalent ions increased laccase activity at the concentration of 10 mmol/l. The effect of metal ions on <b>decolorization</b> of triphenylmethane dyes with different structures namely Bromochlorophenol Blue, Bromophenol Blue, Bromocresol Blue and Phenol Red was tested. The presence of metal ions (Na+, K+, Mg 2 +, Ca 2 +, Ba 2 +, Mn 2 +, Zn 2 +) slightly decreased triphenylmethane dye <b>decolorization</b> by laccase from T. versicolor except Na+ and Mg 2 +, which caused the increase of <b>decolorization</b> for all tested dyes. <b>Decolorization</b> of selected dyes showed that the presence of low-molecular-weight compounds is necessary for effective <b>decolorization.</b> Hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT) is the most frequently used.

This study investigated <b>decolorization</b> of a reactive azo dye, Remazol Golden Yellow (RGY, Reactive Orange 107), by persulfate oxidation activated with Fe 0 aggregate. RGY <b>decolorization</b> was not effective in ultrasound-activated, heat-activated, and base-activated persulfate oxidation; however, a significant <b>decolorization</b> improvement was achieved by applying Fe 0 aggregate to activated persulfate (PS/Fe 0). <b>Decolorization</b> was strongly influenced by pH, Fe 0, persulfate dosages and temperature. The suitable conditions for RGY <b>decolorization</b> were pH 6. 0, PS 5 × 10 – 3 M, and Fe 0 0. 5 g/L. This condition yields 98 % color removal of 100 mg/L RGY solution within 20 min treatment; the azo bonds of RGY were completely broken down. RGY <b>decolorization</b> followed the first-order kinetics. Activation energy of the PS/Fe 0 system was 0. 479 kJ/mol, suggesting the temperature dependence of RGY <b>decolorization</b> is small.

40|$|Anthraquinone dyes {{constitute}} {{the second largest}} class of textile dyes, and are used extensively in the textile industry. A high fraction of the initial reactive dye mass used in the dyeing process remains in the spent dyebath. Reactive dyes are not readily removed by typical wastewater treatment processes and the high salt concentration typical of reactive dyeing further complicates the management of spent reactive dyebaths. Investigation of the reductive transformation of reactive anthraquinone dyes and their <b>decolorization</b> products has been very limited. Additionally, very limited {{research has been conducted}} on the <b>decolorization</b> of spent reactive dyebaths. Research was conducted to investigate the key operational parameters of batch and continuous-flow ZVI <b>decolorization</b> of a reactive anthraquinone dye, Reactive Blue 4 (RB 4), under anoxic conditions, as well as the potential for the biodegradation of its <b>decolorization</b> products in a halophilic culture under aerobic conditions. The effect of two operational parameters, such as mixing intensity and initial dye concentration, on the ZVI batch <b>decolorization</b> kinetics indicates that ZVI <b>decolorization</b> of RB 4 is a surface-catalyzed, mass transfer-limited process. The high salt and base concentrations enhanced the rate of RB 4 <b>decolorization.</b> Based on parameters such as porosity, hydraulic conductivity, pore water velocity, and dispersion coefficient, non-ideal transport characteristics were observed in a continuous-flow ZVI column. The results of a long-term continuous-flow ZVI <b>decolorization</b> kinetics demonstrated that continuous-flow ZVI <b>decolorization</b> is feasible. However, column porosity losses and a shift of reaction kinetics occur in long-term column operation. ZVI <b>decolorization</b> of RB 4 was successfully described with a pseudo first-order or a site saturation model. Lastly, the RB 4 <b>decolorization</b> products generated by ZVI treatment had no inhibitory effect on the halophilic culture. However, biodegradation and/or mineralization of RB 4 <b>decolorization</b> products was not observed after a long-term incubation of the culture.

RESULTS: Bjerkandera sp BOL 13 showed the highest dye <b>decolorization</b> potential. This fungus {{was also found}} to support high <b>decolorization</b> of Remazol Red RR at an initial pH of 4 - 6 and when using straw as co-substrate. The fungus was evaluated for Remazol Red RR <b>decolorization</b> in a continuously fed packed-bed bioreactor operated under non-sterile conditions with 3 days of hydraulic retention time. When glucose was supplied as growth-substrate, <b>decolorization</b> efficiencies of 65 - 90 % were maintained for 12 days in a bioreactor packed with wooden material. The <b>decolorization</b> efficiency was lower when glucose was not fed to the fungus or when a plastic material was used as packing.
