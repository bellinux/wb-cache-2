5|$|Through the 2012 season, Huff had hit 242 career home runs, tying him for 217th all-time with <b>Dusty</b> <b>Baker,</b> Sal Bando, Wally Berger, Roy Campanella, and J. D. Drew. In {{addition}} to {{being used as a}} designated hitter, he has played at five different positions in his career: first base, third base, left field, right field, and second base.|$|E
5|$|The Dodgers scored {{their only}} {{run in the}} bottom of the fourth as <b>Dusty</b> <b>Baker</b> singled, {{advanced}} to second on an error, and scored on another single. They threatened again in the sixth inning, loading the bases, though they failed to score. That was the only inning after the fourth in which a Dodgers' runner reached scoring position. Niekro steadied again after the sixth, allowing just one baserunner on a two-out ninth-inning single over the remaining three innings.|$|E
5000|$|... 2002 was manager <b>Dusty</b> <b>Baker's</b> tenth {{and final}} season {{managing}} the Giants. Following the season he departed {{to manage the}} Chicago Cubs.|$|R
5000|$|Oliver {{managed the}} Sacramento Steelheads in [...] He has also worked at two {{baseball}} schools in California's Sacramento County: operating his own Baseball Academy in Sacramento, {{as well as}} working as a hitting instructor at <b>Dusty</b> <b>Baker's</b> Baseball Camp in Rancho Cordova. http://www.dustybakerbaseballcamp.com/doc.asp?id=19 ...|$|R
50|$|The 2008 {{season was}} manager <b>Dusty</b> <b>Baker's</b> {{first with the}} Reds; the 19-year major league veteran outfielder from 1968 to 1986 with the Atlanta Braves, Los Angeles Dodgers, San Francisco Giants, and Oakland Athletics, {{previously}} managed the San Francisco Giants from 1993 to 2002 and the Chicago Cubs from 2003 to 2006. He took the entire 2007 off. Baker replaced Pete Mackanin, who was named the interim manager on July 1, 2007, after Jerry Narron, coincidentally hired as an interim manager himself,was fired.|$|R
5|$|Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim manager Mike Scioscia is {{currently}} the longest-tenured manager with the same team in Major League Baseball, having led the Angels since 2000. The longest-tenured manager with the same team in the National League is Bruce Bochy, who has led the San Francisco Giants since 2006. The Miami Marlins, Seattle Mariners, San Diego Padres, Los Angeles Dodgers, and Washington Nationals all began the 2016 season with new managers: respectively, Don Mattingly, Scott Servais, Andy Green, Dave Roberts, and <b>Dusty</b> <b>Baker.</b> Additionally, the Philadelphia Phillies and Milwaukee Brewers will retain managers who had been midseason replacement managers during the 2015 season: Pete Mackanin and Craig Counsell.|$|E
5|$|Several {{managers}} {{have won the}} award in a season when they led their team to 100 or more wins. Lou Piniella won 116 games with the Seattle Mariners in 2001, the most by a winning manager, and Joe Torre won 114 with the New York Yankees in 1998. Sparky Anderson and Tony La Russa finished with identical 104–58 records in 1984 and 1988, respectively. Three National League managers, including <b>Dusty</b> <b>Baker,</b> Whitey Herzog, and Larry Dierker, have exceeded the century mark as well. Baker's San Francisco Giants won 103 games in 1993; Dierker's 1998 Houston Astros won 102 and Herzog led the Cardinals to 101 wins in the award's third season.|$|E
5|$|In {{baseball}} statistics, tie-breakers {{count as}} regular season games, with all events in them added to regular season statistics. Niekro, for example, reached his 20th win {{to break a}} tie with Jim Bibby for the second most wins in the NL that season. Similarly, Steve Garvey played in his 163rd game of the season, leading the league with a figure which {{could not have been}} equaled by anyone not on the Astros or Dodgers. <b>Dusty</b> <b>Baker</b> won a Silver Slugger Award and Steve Howe, who pitched the final two scoreless innings of the tie-breaker for the Dodgers in relief, won the Rookie of the Year Award for their performances in the regular season. Additionally six Dodgers (Garvey, Davey Lopes, Bill Russell, Reggie Smith, Jerry Reuss, and Bob Welch) and two Astros (J. R. Richard and Cruz) were named to the National League's All-Star team.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, La Russa was {{the focus}} of a book by sportswriter Buzz Bissinger. Bissinger's Three Nights in August delves into La Russa's role as manager during a 3-game series in 2003 between his Cardinals and manager <b>Dusty</b> <b>Baker's</b> Chicago Cubs, their {{longtime}} rivals. The book received much praise from both fans and critics, though some complained that Bissinger sets out to glorify La Russa's [...] "old school" [...] managerial style as a direct challenge to the statistical analysis theses of Michael Lewis's 2004 book Moneyball.|$|R
5|$|The Washington Nationals elected not {{to extend}} manager <b>Dusty</b> <b>Baker's</b> {{contract}} {{after a second}} consecutive season in which the Nationals reached the National League Division Series and lost in five games (in 2016 to the Los Angeles Dodgers; in 2017 to Martinez's Cubs). Martinez was one of {{just a handful of}} candidates mentioned for the open managerial job. On October 30, 2017, the Nationals announced they had come to terms with Martinez on a three-year managing contract starting with the 2018 season, with a club option for the 2021 season.|$|R
50|$|With the Nationals, Romero {{quickly became}} a key cog in manager <b>Dusty</b> <b>Baker's</b> bullpen as it {{struggled}} to find its footing over {{the first half of}} the season, going through three closers before Baker decided to handle the ninth inning by committee. While Romero continued to walk batters at an above-average rate, as he had with Tampa Bay, his strikeout rate climbed and his earned run average declined relative to what it had been with the Rays. He was frequently deployed to handle the eighth and even the ninth inning.|$|R
5|$|The National League {{franchise}} in Philadelphia {{was established in}} 1883 following the dissolution of Worcester. The team adopted the Philadelphia Phillies name in 1884 and has used the moniker, and been located in the city, since that time. The team's first manager was Bob Ferguson. Charlie Manuel was the manager from 2005 to 2013 until he was fired on August 16, 2013 he {{was replaced by the}} 3rd base coach Ryne Sandberg. Sandberg resigned on June 26, 2015. Pete Mackanin was the replacement. Manuel was the first Phillies manager since Dallas Green in 1980 to win a World Series (2008) and to lead his team to five consecutive playoff appearances since Danny Ozark (1976–1978). Manuel's career managerial record is 867–678, having previously managed the Cleveland Indians; his record with the Phillies was 780-636 surpassing Gene Mauch's previous regular season record of 645 wins (1960–68). The Phillies won five consecutive division championships (2007–2011) and back-to-back National League pennants (2008–2009) during Manuel's tenure. Manuel has the most postseason wins (27) in team history, while Ozark has the most playoff losses (9). Larry Bowa is the only Phillies skipper to capture the Manager of the Year Award, which he won in 2001. Four Phillies managers have been inducted into the Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame for service to the Phillies: Paul Owens, Bowa, Gavvy Cravath, and Green. Mackanin will not return as manager for 2018 season, but will be a Senior Adviser to the GM. Brad Ausmus, John Farrell, <b>Dusty</b> <b>Baker,</b> Mickey Callaway, and Raul Ibanez are all candidates to replace Mackanin. On October 29, 2017, the Phillies reportedly decided that Gabe Kapler would be their next manager.|$|E
25|$|The Washington Nationals {{announced}} in October 2016 that their entire coaching staff would {{return for the}} 2017 season, led by manager <b>Dusty</b> <b>Baker.</b>|$|E
25|$|When <b>Dusty</b> <b>Baker</b> {{was fired}} from the Chicago Cubs, Harry Caray's Restaurant named a hot dog kids meal after Roe. He is the first non-Cub whom the {{restaurant}} has so honored.|$|E
50|$|Montreal's Ray Burris almost single-handedly evened {{the series}} with a masterful {{complete}} game shutout in Game 2. The Dodgers managed only five singles against Burris, and their only real threats, {{in the sixth}} and ninth, were foiled by double plays. Typically in {{what would be a}} very low-scoring series, the Expos didn't do much more hitting against Dodger starter Fernando Valenzuela. But Montreal did manage to push across two runs in the second on RBI hits by Warren Cromartie and Tim Raines. Montreal added another run in the sixth, aided by <b>Dusty</b> <b>Baker's</b> error in left. Burris did the rest to notch his 3-0 victory.|$|R
50|$|For {{the first}} seven innings Game 4 {{followed}} the usual pattern of the series, with dominant performances from both starting pitchers. Montreal's Bill Gullickson allowed an unearned run in the third, after Bill Russell reached on Larry Parrish's error and scored on <b>Dusty</b> <b>Baker's</b> double. Los Angeles' Burt Hooton gave up the game-tying run in the fourth on another unearned tally, when Gary Carter reached on Ron Cey's error and scored on a single by Warren Cromartie. The starters yielded nothing more until the eighth, when Steve Garvey's two-run homer put the Dodgers up 3-1 and chased Gullickson. The Dodgers blew the game open with four more runs in the ninth, highlighted by Baker's two-run single. Hooton finally tired in the eighth but the Dodger bullpen got the last five outs and the series was even.|$|R
5000|$|In 1976, Maddox had {{his best}} {{year as a}} hitter, with a [...]330 batting average, and helped the Phillies win the National League East, their first postseason berth since the Whiz Kids in the 1950 World Series. But the team lost three {{consecutive}} National League Championship Series, including in 1978 against the Los Angeles Dodgers as Maddox made two errors in Game Four. With the score tied {{in the bottom of}} the tenth inning, two out, and Ron Cey on first, Maddox misplayed <b>Dusty</b> <b>Baker's</b> fly ball. He started back on the ball, then charged forward, and the ball glanced off his glove. Bill Russell then followed with a single to center. Maddox charged, but the ball skipped past him; had he fielded the ball cleanly, he could have thrown Cey (who was not known for his baserunning speed) out at the plate. Instead, Cey scored the winning run to put the Dodgers in the World Series.|$|R
25|$|After the Cubs fired <b>Dusty</b> <b>Baker</b> in 2006, {{the rivalry}} {{was raised by}} another notch as they {{replaced}} him with Lou Piniella. Coincidentally, Piniella and La Russa both grew up in Tampa and faced {{each other in the}} 1990 World Series as managers of the Cincinnati Reds and Oakland Athletics, respectively.|$|E
25|$|With Max Scherzer still {{completing}} his recovery from a hamstring tweak, Gio González started Game 2 for Washington, facing Chicago ace Jon Lester. Despite the impotence of the Nationals′ lineup against Cubs pitching the previous evening, <b>Dusty</b> <b>Baker</b> opted {{to put the}} same lineup up against Lester {{in the belief that}} it was capable of an offensive explosion at any time.|$|E
25|$|When <b>Dusty</b> <b>Baker,</b> the Cub {{manager was}} interviewed later, he stated any use of corked bats {{on his team}} is {{strictly}} prohibited. On June 6, Sosa was suspended for eight games. However, the suspension was reduced to seven games after appeal on June 11. Sosa finished the season with 40 home runs, and he hit two more in the 2003 NLCS against the Florida Marlins, which the Cubs led 3 games to 1 before ultimately falling in seven games.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} 37seasons since Durocher, the Cubs have had 22 managers. Jim Frey and Don Zimmer {{led the team}} to the National League Championship Series (NLCS) in 1984 and 1989, respectively. In both of those seasons, the team's manager won a Manager of the Year Award. Jim Riggleman managed the team for five years from 1995 through 1999, earning the team's first and only wild card playoff spot in 1998. <b>Dusty</b> <b>Baker's</b> Cubs lost in the 2003 NLCS {{during the first year}} of a {{four-year}} managing tenure. Baker's successor, Lou Piniella, led the team to two consecutive National League Central Division titles during his first two years with the team and was awarded the 2008 Manager of the Year Award. On July 20, 2010, Piniella announced his intention to retire as manager of the Cubs following the end of the season. However, on August 22, 2010, Piniella announced he would resign after that day's game with the Atlanta Braves, citing family reasons. Third base coach Mike Quade would finish the rest of the season as manager. The Cubs' current general manager is Jed Hoyer, who replaced Jim Hendry.|$|R
2500|$|The Barry Bonds era began auspiciously as Bonds put up {{the numbers}} for the third MVP of his career: 46 homers, 129 runs and 123 RBI, (.336 BA, [...]458 OBP, [...]677 SLG, {{for a total of}} 1.135 OPS), all career highs. Matt Williams excelled as well (38 HR, 110 RBI, [...]294 BA), with {{veterans}} Robby Thompson and Will Clark (in his last season with the Giants) providing offensive support. John Burkett and Bill Swift won more than twenty games apiece, and closer Rod Beck was dominant with 48 saves and a 2.16 ERA. All this led the Giants to a 103–59 record in <b>Dusty</b> <b>Baker's</b> first year as manager, which earned him the Manager of the Year award. [...] But despite the Giants' great record, the Atlanta Braves — fueled by solid seasons from David Justice, Ron Gant, Deion Sanders and their key midseason acquisition of Fred McGriff from the San Diego Padres — came back from a ten-game deficit to pass the Giants win the NL West by a single game. The Braves also had two 20+-game winners, Tom Glavine and Cy Young Award-winning Greg Maddux.|$|R
5000|$|... 2002 was <b>Dusty</b> <b>Baker's</b> tenth {{season as}} manager of the Giants. It was also their third season playing at Pacific Bell Park (now AT&T Park). The Giants {{finished}} the previous season {{with a record of}} 90-72, finishing in second place in the NL West, two games behind the Arizona Diamondbacks. They also finished in second place in the NL wild card standings, three games behind the St. Louis Cardinals. Notable player departures included 2001 midseason acquisition Andrés Galarraga, who departed as a free agent, and Shawn Estes, who was traded to the New York Mets in exchange for Tsuyoshi Shinjo and Desi Relaford. Notable player acquisitions included Reggie Sanders, a free agent, and David Bell, who the Giants received from the Seattle Mariners in exchange for Desi Relaford and cash. During the season the Giants also acquired Kenny Lofton from the Chicago White Sox in exchange for two minor leaguers. Sanders, Bell, Shinjo, and Lofton helped bolster a Giants offense led by longtime Giants Barry Bonds, J. T. Snow, Rich Aurilia, and Jeff Kent, as well as relative newcomer Benito Santiago. The starting pitching rotation was led by Kirk Rueter and Jason Schmidt, with a bullpen led by Tim Worrell and closer Robb Nen.|$|R
25|$|Stephen Strasburg was {{selected}} as a pitcher. It was his second all-star selection, the first having been in 2012. On July 8, Major League Baseball announced that Strasburg would not be available to pitch in the all-star game. Nationals general manager Mike Rizzo and manager <b>Dusty</b> <b>Baker</b> explained that Strasburg, {{in consultation with the}} Nationals, had decided not to pitch because he recently had come off the disabled list after a back injury. Strasburg traveled to the game and participated in festivities.|$|E
25|$|Stephen Strasburg was {{reactivated}} {{from the}} disabled list minutes before gametime on July 3 and proceeded to pitch 6⅔ innings without allowing a hit to the Cincinnati Reds before manager <b>Dusty</b> <b>Baker</b> took {{him out of the}} game with a runner on third base and a pitch count in the triple digits. Strasburg earned the win in the 12–1 Nationals victory, raising his record to 11–0 and becoming only the fourth pitcher in the past 75 years with as good a win-loss mark through his first 15 starts. The Nationals hit six home runs in the game, their highest mark of the season.|$|E
25|$|Compounding the Nationals' late-June problems, Strasburg {{was placed}} on the {{disabled}} list with a back strain after missing two starts late in the month. Right-handed starting pitcher Lucas Giolito, the Nationals' top prospect and the #1-rated pitching prospect in all of baseball, was called up to replace him on the roster. Giolito made his first start June 28 against the New York Mets at Nationals Park, pitching four scoreless innings and allowing just one hit before a rainstorm delayed the game and prompted manager <b>Dusty</b> <b>Baker</b> to go to the bullpen when play resumed. The Nationals shut out the Mets 5–0, with the win awarded to Óliver Pérez in relief.|$|E
5000|$|The Barry Bonds era began auspiciously as Bonds put up {{the numbers}} for the third MVP of his career: 46 home runs, 129 runs, 123 runs batted in, [...]336 batting average, [...]458 on-base percentage, [...]677 {{slugging}} percentage, 1.135 on base plus slugging. All exceeded his numbers from previous years. Matt Williams excelled as well (38 home runs, 110 runs batted in, [...]294 batting average), with veterans Robby Thompson and Will Clark, the latter in his last season with the Giants, providing additional offensive support. John Burkett and Bill Swift won more than twenty games apiece, and closer Rod Beck was dominant with 48 saves and a 2.16 ERA. All this led the Giants to a 103-59 record in <b>Dusty</b> <b>Baker's</b> first year as manager, which earned him the Manager of the Year award. But despite the Giants' great record, the Atlanta Braves — fueled by solid seasons from David Justice, Ron Gant, Deion Sanders and their key midseason acquisition of Fred McGriff from the San Diego Padres — {{came back from a}} ten-game deficit to pass the Giants win the NL West by a single game. The Braves also had two 20+-game winners, Tom Glavine and Cy Young Award-winning Greg Maddux.|$|R
25|$|During the 2017 season, Kelley {{was among}} the {{relievers}} manager <b>Dusty</b> <b>Baker</b> tried as closer, with Opening Day closer Blake Treinen being demoted due to ineffectiveness early in the season. Kelley himself lost the role by late May, with Baker moving rookie Koda Glover into the position due to Kelley's lack of durability. Kelley experienced dramatic increases in his rates of walks and home runs allowed over {{the first half of}} the season, landing on the disabled list twice (with a lower back strain in May and a right trapezius strain in June) as he struggled to a 7.00 ERA and 4.5 home run rate per nine innings.|$|E
25|$|The {{struggles of}} newly minted closer Blake Treinen {{in the ninth}} inning {{prompted}} manager <b>Dusty</b> <b>Baker</b> to announce on April 19 that closing duties would be shared between relievers Shawn Kelley and Koda Glover. Baker said concerns about Kelley's resiliency, due to a twice-repaired elbow, and Glover's lack of experience, as a rookie without a career save, kept the team from giving either one the sole job of closer. Glover earned his first career save on April 22, coming into the ninth inning with two outs and retiring the only batter he faced. However, he landed on the disabled list with a left hip impingement on April 26, and left-handed reliever Matt Grace was recalled.|$|E
25|$|On May 26, Nationals manager <b>Dusty</b> <b>Baker</b> won his 1,700th game as {{a manager}} as the Nationals {{defeated}} the Cardinals at Nationals Park. Three days later, Strasburg improved to 9–0 for {{the season with a}} win over the Cardinals on May 29, setting a record for the Montreal–Washington franchise of 12 consecutive decisions won dating back to the 2015 season. Daniel Murphy, the Nationals' starting second baseman, tied a franchise record for hits in a month with 47, including seven home runs. Murphy was named the National League Player of the Month, the first time since 2009 that two teammates had received the honor in back-to-back months following Harper's award for April.|$|E
25|$|Plans {{called for}} retired pitcher and former National Liván Hernández {{to throw out}} the {{ceremonial}} first pitch, but after Hurricane Matthew′s effects on Florida made it impossible for Hernández to fly to Washington, the Nationals surprised the fans at Nationals Park by having Nationals starting catcher Wilson Ramos – whose season had ended with a knee injury on September 26 – throw it instead, to a huge roar from the crowd. The game provided an historic first: When <b>Dusty</b> <b>Baker</b> and Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts exchanged line-up cards before the game, it became the first postseason game in the Major League Baseball history in which two African-American managers faced one another.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fifth}} {{game of the}} series, the Dodgers jumped on top early with a {{home run in the}} second by Enrique Hernandez. He added two more home runs later in the game, {{including}} a grand slam. He became only the fourth Dodger to hit a post-season grandslam (joining Ron Cey and <b>Dusty</b> <b>Baker</b> from the 1981 NLCS and James Loney in the 2008 NLDS). His seven RBI in the game also set a NLCS record. The Dodgers cruised to an 11–1 win and a trip to their first World Series since 1988. Chris Taylor and Justin Turner were voted co-MVPs of the series. The Dodgers bullpen set a record with 23 consecutive scoreless innings in the post-season from game two of the NLDS through the completion of the NLCS.|$|E
25|$|After the Dodgers scored their first-inning run, Gio González retired 11 of {{the next}} 12 batters he faced. However, {{throwing}} his 83rd pitch of the game with one out in the fifth inning, he gave up a two-run homer to Dodgers pinch-hitter Carlos Ruiz that narrowed the Nationals′ lead to 4-3. Nationals manager <b>Dusty</b> <b>Baker</b> immediately took Gonzalez out of the game, and, {{for the second consecutive}} game, Nationals relievers had to pitch the final 4⅔ innings. Sammy Solis relieved Gonzalez and pitched 1⅔ innings, followed by Óliver Pérez for a third of an inning and Shawn Kelley for 1⅔ innings, all scoreless; Kelley retired all five Dodgers he faced, striking out three of them. The Dodgers′ bullpen also shut the Nationals out through the eighth inning, and Washington still clung to a 4-3 lead going into the ninth.|$|E
25|$|Retired {{pitcher and}} former National Liván Hernández {{had missed the}} chance {{to throw out the}} {{ceremonial}} first pitch in Game 1 when Hurricane Matthew made it impossible for him to fly from Florida to Washington for that game, but he threw out the first pitch for Game 5 instead. For some the game carried an historic weight that would either confirm or change the narrative of the Nationals, their achievements, and their prospects for the future after their collapse in the 2012 NLDS and the impotence of their offense in the 2014 NLDS. A Washington, D.C., MLB team had not won a postseason series since the Washington Senators won the 1924 World Series, the Montreal-Washington franchise had won only one playoff series in its history (in 1981, as the Montreal Expos), and the Nationals had never advanced beyond the NLDS in two previous tries. Two personal negative streaks also were on the line: Teams <b>Dusty</b> <b>Baker</b> managed had lost eight straight postseason elimination games in a row in which they had a chance to advance to the next round of the playoffs, and starting pitcher Max Scherzer had started three postseason elimination games in a row for his previous teams, all of them losses.|$|E
25|$|Scherzer did {{not allow}} a baserunner until the fourth inning, when he hit John Jay with a pitch, and threw a no-hitter for 6⅓ innings – the deepest no-hit bid by an {{opponent}} in Cubs postseason history – and struck out seven Cubs before finally giving up a double to Zobrist with one out {{in the bottom of}} the seventh inning. With Scherzer having thrown 98 pitches, <b>Dusty</b> <b>Baker</b> came out to relieve him, choosing lefty Sammy Solis to face the left-handed Schwarber. Maddon countered by pinch-hitting for Schwarber, bringing right-hander Albert Almora Jr. to the plate. Solis, although he had posted a 5.88 ERA during the season, actually had fared better against right-handed batters than left-handers, but on Solis′s seventh pitch, Almora singled – his first career postseason hit in 15 at-bats – to score Zobrist and tie the game at 1–1. Solis then gave up a single to right fielder Jason Heyward that advanced Almora to second before Brandon Kintzler relieved Solis and got shortstop Addison Russell to line out to Taylor in center field. Heyward made a rare baserunning mistake by attempting to advance to second on Russell′s liner, allowing Taylor to double him off at first base to end the inning.|$|E
