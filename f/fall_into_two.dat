5|$|Another type of {{approach}} is tissue engineering, using biomaterials to help scaffold and rebuild damaged tissues. Biomaterials being investigated include natural substances such as collagen or agarose and synthetic ones like polymers and nitrocellulose.

5|$|Chalukyan temples <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> {{categories}} – {{the first}} being temples {{with a common}} mantapa (a colonnaded hall) and two shrines (known as dvikuta), and the second being temples with one mantapa and a single shrine (ekakuta). Both kinds of temples have two or more entrances giving access to the main hall. This format differs from both the designs of the northern Indian temples, which have a small closed mantapa leading to the shrine and the southern Indian temples which generally have a large, open, columned mantapa.|$|E

5|$|Many {{proteins}} {{are able}} to recognize or distort the Holliday junction structure. One such class contains junction-resolving enzymes that cleave the junctions, sometimes in a sequence-specific fashion. Such proteins distort {{the structure of the}} junction in various ways, often pulling the junction into an unstacked conformation, breaking the central base pairs, and/or changing the angles between the four arms. Other classes are branch migration proteins that increase the exchange rate by orders of magnitude, and site-specific recombinases. In prokaryotes, Holliday junction resolvases <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> families, integrases and nucleases, that are each structurally similar although their sequences are not conserved.|$|E
5|$|Supernova {{searches}} <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> classes: those {{focused on}} relatively nearby events and those looking farther away. Because {{of the expansion}} of the universe, the distance to a remote object with a known emission spectrum can be estimated by measuring its Doppler shift (or redshift); on average, more-distant objects recede with greater velocity than those nearby, and so have a higher redshift. Thus the search is split between high redshift and low redshift, with the boundary falling around a redshift range of z=0.1–0.3—where z is a dimensionless measure of the spectrum's frequency shift.|$|E
5|$|The purely orchestral works <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> categories. The best-known {{ones in the}} West, {{and perhaps}} the finest in overall quality, are mainly {{programmatic}} in nature—in other words, the musical content {{and how it is}} handled in the piece is determined by the plot or characters in a story, the action in a painting or events reported through another non-musical source. The second category of works are more academic, such as his First and Third Symphonies and his Sinfonietta. In these, Rimsky-Korsakov still employed folk themes but subjected them to abstract rules of musical composition.|$|E

5|$|Although to date most KBOs still appear spectrally featureless due {{to their}} faintness, {{there have been a}} number of successes in {{determining}} their composition. In 1996, Robert H. Brown et al. acquired spectroscopic data on the KBO 1993 SC, which revealed that its surface composition is markedly similar to that of Pluto, as well as Neptune's moon Triton, with large amounts of methane ice. For the smaller objects, only colors and in some cases the albedos have been determined. These objects largely <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> classes: gray with low albedos, or very red with higher albedos. The difference in colors and albedos is hypothesized to be due to the retention or the loss of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) on the surface of these objects, with the surfaces of those that formed far enough from the Sun to retain H2S being reddened due to irradiation.|$|E
5|$|Early {{sources on}} Richard Neville <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> categories. The first are the {{sympathetic}} chronicles {{of the early}} Yorkist years, or works based on these, such as the Mirror for Magistrates (1559). The other category originates with chronicles commissioned by Edward IV after Warwick's fall, such as the Historie of the arrivall of Edward IV, and take a more negative view of the earl. The Mirror portrayed Warwick as a great man: beloved by the people, and betrayed by the man he helped raise to the throne. The other perspective {{can be found in}} Shakespeare's Henry VI trilogy: a man driven by pride and egotism, who created and deposed kings at will.|$|E
5|$|Flowers {{are usually}} borne {{in groups of}} three—one female flower {{together}} with two male flowers. In some species groups of four flowers (two male and two female) have been reported. At {{the far end of}} the inflorescence, away from the axis of the tree, pairs of male flowers replace the triads of male and female flowers. Flower colour is poorly known. It must be recorded from live plants, since preserved flowers lose their colour over time, and records of these species in the wild are incomplete. Male flowers tend to <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> groups—those with cream or yellow flowers and those with some amount of purple in the flowers. Female flowers are even less well known than male flowers.|$|E

5|$|Settlement on the Mendip Hills {{appears to}} <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> types. The first, {{apparent}} in the Neolithic and Bronze Age Britain periods, and repeated {{on a small scale}} in the Middle Ages and post-medieval era, comprised occupation by self-sufficient groups in small communities or isolated farms. The second was represented in the Iron Age Britain and Roman periods by large sites with specialist functions, existing by virtue of their ability to exert power over lowland producers. From the Iron Age onward the ownership of land took on increasing importance, with large landholdings based on the mines or on stock grazing, denying settlers access to the plateau or forcing them off the hills.|$|E
5|$|The coins of Ælfwald's reign are {{amongst the}} {{earliest}} that were minted in East Anglia. The coinage of silver pennies known as sceattas expanded {{in his time}} and several types are attributed to East Anglian production. Most of them <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> main groups, known as the 'Q' and 'R' series. Neither group bears a royal name or title and the authority by which they were issued cannot not established. The 'Q' series, which has some Northumbrian affinities, is most densely distributed in western East Anglia, along the Fen edge between the Wash and Cambridge. The R series, with bust and standard, derived from earlier Kentish types, is more densely distributed {{in central and eastern}} East Anglia, including the Ipswich area. According to Michael Metcalf, the 'R' series was also East Anglian, being minted at Gipeswic.|$|E
5|$|The {{myths and}} legends {{surrounding}} Cofresí <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> categories: those portraying {{him as a}} generous thief or anti-hero and those describing him as overwhelmingly evil. A subcategory represents him as an adventurer, world traveler or womanizer. Reports by historians such as Tió of the pirate sharing his loot with the needy have evolved into a detailed mythology. These apologetics attempt to justify his piracy, blaming it on poverty, revenge or a desire to restore his family's honor, and portray Cofresí as a class hero defying official inequality and corruption. He {{is said to have}} been a protector and benefactor of children, women and the elderly, with some accounts describing him as a rebel hero and supporter of independence from imperial power.|$|E

5|$|The {{songs of}} {{mainland}} goldcrests vary only slightly across their range and {{consist of a}} single song type, but much more divergence {{has occurred in the}} isolated Macaronesian populations. Not only are there variations between islands and within an island, but individual males on the Azores can have up to three song types. The dialects on the Azores <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> main groups, neither of which elicited a response from male European goldcrests in playback experiments. There are also two main dialect groups on the Canary islands, a widespread group similar to the European version, and another that is restricted to the mountains of Tenerife. The song variations have been used to investigate the colonisation pattern of the Macaronesian islands by goldcrests, and identified a previously unknown subspecies.|$|E
5|$|Christian {{churches have}} existed in Greater Manchester since the Anglo-Saxon era, but no {{significant}} Saxon features remain in its listed churches, {{and the only}} Norman material {{is to be found}} in StLeonard, Middleton. The churches in this list <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> main groups: those originating mainly from the medieval period, which are in Gothic style, and churches built during the 19th and 20thcenturies, mainly in Gothic Revival style, with only a few churches created between these periods. Gothic churches originating from the medieval era include Manchester Cathedral, StMary, Radcliffe, and StWerburgh Old Church, Warburton. Churches from the 19thcentury include some of the finest works of the leading architects of the period: George Gilbert Scott (StMark, Worsley), Alfred Waterhouse (StElisabeth, Reddish), George Frederick Bodley (StAugustine, Pendlebury), and Charles Barry (All Saints, Whitefield). Built between these periods was the Neoclassical church of StAnn, Manchester. All the above examples are Anglican churches. There are two Roman Catholic churches in the list: Joseph A.Hansom's Holy Name of Jesus, Manchester, and E.W.Pugin's All Saints, Urmston, and one church built for the Christian Scientists, the Edgar Wood Centre.|$|E
5|$|Doom 3 is a story-driven action {{game played}} from a first-person perspective. As with {{previous}} Doom games, the main {{objective is to}} successfully pass through its levels, defeating a variety of enemy characters intent on killing the player's character. Doom 3s more story-centered approach, however, means that the player often encounters friendly non-player characters, who provide key plot information, objectives and inventory items. The game incorporates ten weapons for the player's use to survive, including conventional firearms and explosives such as a submachine gun, shotgun and grenades, experimental plasma weaponry, and the traditional BFG 9000 and chainsaw weapons of the Doom franchise. Enemies come in multiple forms and with different abilities and tactics, but <b>fall</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> broad categories of either zombies or demons. Zombies are humans possessed by demonic forces, who attack the player's character using their hands and melee weapons or a variety of firearms, while demons are creatures from Hell, most of which attack using claws and spines, or by summoning plasma-based fireballs. The corpses of demons are reduced to ashes after death, leaving no trace of their body behind.|$|E
