5|$|Females <b>grow</b> <b>faster</b> {{than males}} overall, {{and must be}} larger to mature sexually. In most populations males reach sexual {{maturity}} at 2–4years old, and females at 6–10.

5|$|Many {{species of}} birdlice are {{present on the}} birds and in their nests, and mites of the genus Knemidocoptes {{have been known to}} infest populations, {{resulting}} in lesions on the legs and toes. Parasitisation of nestlings by Protocalliphora blow-fly larvae is a significant factor in nestling mortality. Egg size does not influence nestling mortality, but chicks from large eggs <b>grow</b> <b>faster.</b>|$|E
5|$|The fore gut of {{some species}} extends the whole {{length of the}} insect {{and can be used}} to store prey for {{digestion}} later. This may be advantageous in an insect that feeds intermittently. Chinese mantises live longer, <b>grow</b> <b>faster,</b> and produce more young when they are able to eat pollen.|$|E

5|$|The {{common toad}} reaches {{maturity}} at three {{to seven years}} old but there is great variability between populations. Juveniles are often parasitised by the lung nematode Rhabdias bufonis. This slows growth rates and reduces stamina and fitness. Larger juveniles at metamorphosis always outgrow smaller ones that have been reared in more crowded ponds. Even when they have heavy worm burdens, large juveniles <b>grow</b> <b>faster</b> than smaller individuals with light worm burdens. After several months of heavy worm infection, some juveniles in a study were only half as heavy as control juveniles. Their parasite-induced anorexia caused a decrease in food intake and some died. Another study investigated whether the use of nitrogenous fertilisers affects the development of common toad tadpoles. The toadlets were kept in very dilute solutions of ammonium nitrate of various strengths. It was found that at certain concentrations, which were well above any normally found in the field, growth was increased and metamorphosis accelerated, but at others, {{there was no significant}} difference between the experimental tadpoles and controls. Nevertheless, certain unusual swimming patterns and a few deformities were found among the experimental animals.|$|E

Growth of one to two metres (3.3 to 6.6ft) per {{year for the first}} four years is considered normal. Shade considerably hampers growth rates. Older trees, while growing much slower, still do so faster than other trees. Studies found that Californian trees <b>grew</b> <b>faster</b> than their East Coast counterparts, and American trees in general <b>grew</b> <b>faster</b> than Chinese ones.|$|R
25|$|Size {{of youth}} {{population}}. “In 2010, {{more than a}} quarter of the world’s total population (27%) was under the age of 15.” Christian youth under 15 were the same as the 27% global average. But an even higher percentage of Muslims (34%) were younger than 15. This higher youth population is one of the reasons that from 2010-2050 Muslims are projected to <b>grow</b> <b>faster</b> than Christians.|$|E

25|$|There {{is always}} a dominant-subordinate {{relationship}} between chicks in a brood.

In one longitudinal study, {{there appears to be no}} long-term effects of dominance hierarchies; in fact, subordinate chicks were often observed producing nests of their own before their dominant siblings.|$|E

25|$|Growth {{of cells}} {{contributes}} to the plant's size, unevenly localized growth produces bending, turning and directionalization of organs- for example, stems turning toward light sources (phototropism), roots growing in response to gravity (gravitropism), and other tropisms originated because cells on one side <b>grow</b> <b>faster</b> than the cells {{on the other side}} of the organ. So, precise control of auxin distribution between different cells has paramount importance to the resulting form of plant growth and organization.|$|E
25|$|A 2008 {{study of}} one {{skeleton}} of the hadrosaur Hypacrosaurus concluded that this dinosaur grew even faster, reaching its full size {{at the age}} of about 15; the main evidence was the number and spacing of growth rings in its bones. The authors found this consistent with a life-cycle theory that prey species should <b>grow</b> <b>faster</b> than their predators if they lose a lot of juveniles to predators and the local environment provides enough resources for rapid growth.|$|E

25|$|Finally, {{the sum of}} auxin {{arriving}} from stems to roots influences the degree of root growth. If shoot tips are removed, the plant does not react just by outgrowth of lateral buds — which are supposed to replace to original lead. It also follows that smaller amount of auxin arriving to the roots results in slower growth of roots and the nutrients are subsequently in higher degree invested in {{the upper part of}} the plant, which hence starts to <b>grow</b> <b>faster.</b>|$|E
25|$|When {{treated with}} GH, a {{severely}} deficient child {{will begin to}} <b>grow</b> <b>faster</b> within months. In {{the first year of}} treatment, the rate of growth may increase from half as fast as other children are growing to twice as fast (e.g., from 1nbsp&inch a year to 4nbsp&inches, or 2.5nbsp&cm to 10). Growth typically slows in subsequent years, but usually remains above normal so that over several years a child who had fallen far behind in his height may grow into the normal height range. Excess adipose tissue may be reduced.|$|E
25|$|Thailand {{introduced}} E20 in 2008, but {{shortages in}} ethanol supplies by mid-2008 caused {{a delay in}} {{the expansion of the}} E20 fueling station network in the country. By mid-2010, 161 fueling stations were selling E20, and sales have risen 80% since April 2009. The rapid growth in E20 demand is because most vehicle models launched since 2009 were E20-compatible, and sales of E20 are expected to <b>grow</b> <b>faster</b> once more local automakers start producing small, E20-compatible, fuel-efficient cars. The Thai government is promoting ethanol usage through subsidies, as ethanol costs four baht a litre more than gasoline.|$|E
