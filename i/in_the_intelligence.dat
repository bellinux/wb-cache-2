5|$|Tod {{was born}} in London and educated in Scotland. He joined the East India Company as a {{military}} officer and travelled to India in 1799 as a cadet in the Bengal Army. He rose quickly in rank, eventually becoming captain of an escort for an envoy in a Sindian royal court. After the Third Anglo-Maratha War, during which Tod was involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>intelligence</b> department, he was appointed Political Agent for some areas of Rajputana. His task was to help unify the region {{under the control of}} the East India Company. During this period Tod conducted most of the research that he would later publish.

Over time, his work was restricted and his areas of oversight were significantly curtailed. In 1823, owing to declining health and reputation, Tod resigned his post as Political Agent and returned to England.|$|E
