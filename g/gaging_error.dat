40|$|An {{investigation}} of the Shuttle Reaction Control System (RCS) propellant gaging module has revealed that the gaging errors due to the combined effects of random instrumentation measurement errors and propellant loading uncertainties are non-linear over {{the range of the}} propellant quantity gage (0 - 100 %), with the largest error occurring at the zero point. When the RCS propellant tanks are filled to contain 100 % of the maximum usable propellant, the largest <b>gaging</b> <b>error</b> was determined to be 3. 9 % for the fuel and 5. 4 % for the oxidizer. When the RCS propellant tanks initially contain 50 % of the maximum usable propellant, the largest <b>gaging</b> <b>error</b> increases to 4. 0 % for the fuel and 5. 6 % for the oxidizer...|$|E

40|$|The shuttle orbital {{maneuvering}} system (OMS) pressure-volume-temperature (P-V-T) propellant gaging module computes {{the quantity}} of usable OMS propellant remaining based on the real gas P-V-T relationship for the propellant tank pressurant, helium. The OMS P-V-T propellant quantity <b>gaging</b> <b>error</b> was determined for four sets of instrumentation configurations and accuracies with the propellant tank operating in the normal constant pressure mode and in the blowdown mode. The instrumentation inaccuracy allowance for propellant leak detection was also computed for these same four sets of instrumentation. These gaging errors and leak detection allowances are presented in tables designed to permit a direct comparison {{of the effectiveness of}} the four instrumentation sets. The results show the magnitudes of the improvements in propellant quantity gaging accuracies and propellant leak detection allowances which can be achieved by employing more accurate pressure and temperature instrumentation...|$|E

40|$|A general {{framework}} is proposed for using precipitation estimates from NEXRAD weather radars in raingage network design. NEXRAD precipitation products {{are used to}} simulate space-time rainfall #elds, which can be sampled by hypothetical raingage networks. A stochastic model is used to simulate gage observations from areal-average precipitation for radar grid cells. The stochastic model accounts for spatial variability within the cell and <b>gage</b> measurement <b>errors.</b> The approach is ideally suited to raingage network design in regions with strong climatic variations in rainfall patterns, where conventional methods are sometimes lacking. A case study example, involving the estimation of areal-average precipitation for catchments in the Catskill Mountains, illustrates the approach. Although limitations are imposed {{by the quality of}} NEXRAD precipitation estimates, weather radars can provide valuable information for empirical simulations of rainfall #elds. Results from the case study sh [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Long-term {{trends in}} annual {{evaporation}} and watershed Bowen ratio were studied on 51 eastern United States watersheds which had experienced an estimated 0 – 58 % urban/residential development between 1920 and 1990. Annual watershed evaporation was estimated as {{the difference between}} annual streamflow and average watershed precipitation, corrected for watershed elevation effects and <b>gage</b> catch <b>error.</b> Annual watershed Bowen ratios were estimated using spatially and temporally averaged net radiation values and annual evaporation. Significant (a 5 0. 1) positive trends in annual watershed Bowen ratio and negative trends in evaporation were found for 12 and 10 watersheds, respectively, of 28 watersheds with. 2 % urban/residential development and only 2 and 3 watersheds, respectively, of 23 watersheds with, 2 % development. Trend results lead to estimates of the overall change in water and energy balances which were separately related to the percentage change in urban/residential area for all 51 watersheds. These regional relationships, linking watershed hydrology, energy exchange, and land use changes, showed significant decreases in watershed evaporation and significant increases in sensible heating of the atmosphere with increased urban/residential development on watersheds in the eastern United States. At 100 % urbanization the regional relationships predicted a decrease in annual evaporation of 22 cm {{and an increase in}} the sensible heating of the atmosphere of 13 W/m 2. 1...|$|R
40|$|Traditionally, {{structural}} loads are measured using strain gages. A loads calibration test {{must be done}} before loads can be accurately measured. In one measurement method, a series of point loads {{is applied to the}} structure, and loads equations are derived via the least squares curve fitting algorithm using the strain gage responses to the applied point loads. However, many research structures are highly instrumented with strain gages, and the number and selection of gages used in a loads equation can be problematic. This paper presents an improved technique using a genetic algorithm to choose the strain gages used in the loads equations. Also presented are a comparison of the genetic algorithm performance with the current T-value technique and a variant known as the Best Step-down technique. Examples are shown using aerospace vehicle wings of high and low aspect ratio. In addition, a significant limitation in the current methods is revealed. The genetic algorithm arrived at a comparable or superior set of gages with significantly less human effort, and could be applied in instances when the current methods could not.

40|$|There is {{no simple}} and perfect way to measure {{residual}} stresses in metal parts that have been welded or deformed to make complex structures such as pressure vessels and aircraft, yet these locked-in stresses can contribute to structural failure by fatigue and fracture. However, one proven and tested technique for determining the internal stress of a metal part is to drill a test hole while measuring the relieved strains around the hole, such as the hole-drilling strain gage method described in ASTM E 837. The program HOLEGAGE processes strain gage data and provides additional calculations of internal stress variations that are not obtained with standard E 837 analysis methods. The typical application of the technique uses a three gage rosette with a special hole-drilling fixture for drilling a hole {{through the center of}} the rosette to produce a hole with very small <b>gage</b> pattern eccentricity <b>error.</b> Another device is used to control the drilling and halt the drill at controlled depth steps. At each step, strains from all three strain gages are recorded. The influence coefficients used by HOLEGAGE to compute stresses from relieved hole strains were developed by published finite element method studies of thick plates for specific hole sizes and depths. The program uses a parabolic fit and an interpolating scheme to project the coefficients to other hole sizes and depths. Additionally, published experimental data are used to extend the coefficients to relatively thin plates. These influence coefficients are used to compute the stresses in the original part from the strain data. HOLEGAGE will compute interior planar stresses using strain data from each drilled hole depth layer. Planar stresses may be computed in three ways including: a least squares fit for a linear variation with depth, an integral method to give incremental stress data for each layer, or by a linear fit to the integral data (with some surface data points omitted) to predict surface stresses before strain gage sanding preparations introduced additional residual stresses. Options are included for estimating the effect of hole eccentricity on calculations, smoothing noise from the strain data, and inputting the program data either interactively or from a data file. HOLEGAGE was written in FORTRAN 77 for DEC VAX computers under VMS, and is transportable except for system-unique TIME and DATE system calls. The program requires 54 K of main memory and was developed in 1990. The program is available on a 9 -track 1600 BPI VAX BACKUP format magnetic tape (standard media) or a TK 50 tape cartridge. The documentation is included on the tape. DEC VAX and VMS are trademarks of Digital Equipment Corporation...|$|R
