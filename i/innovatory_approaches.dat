40|$|Assessment at Masters Level is {{the subject}} of a three-year UK National Teaching Fellowship Scheme (NTFS) project, 'Assimilate', which seeks to explore <b>innovatory</b> <b>approaches</b> in this field. More than 40 {{interviews}} were undertaken for the project with teachers at Masters level in the UK and internationally. Although national and institutional systems differentiate clearly in their documentation how assessment at M-level should differ from that at undergraduate level, in practice there is not necessarily such clarity. This article draws on how teachers and programme leaders on Masters level courses who were interviewed for the project described the differences in practice. It concludes that there is considerable confusion and ambivalence about what distinguishes one level from another and scope for further clarification...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} {{tribology}} encompasses the friction, wear and lubrication of mechanical components such as bearings and gears. Tribological practices {{are aimed at}} ensuring that such components operate with high efficiency (low friction) and achieve long lives. On spacecraft mechanisms the route to achieving these goals brings its own unique challenges. This review describes the problems posed by the space environment, the types of tribological component used on spacecraft and the approaches taken to their lubrication. It is shown that in many instances lubrication needs can be met by synthetic oils having exceedingly low volatilities, but that at temperature extremes {{the only means of}} reducing friction and wear is by solid lubrication. As the demands placed on space engineering increase, <b>innovatory</b> <b>approaches</b> will be needed to solve future tribological problems.

Technology and working practices are changing rapidly, but strategies {{for dealing with the}} human resource implications are developing more slowly. The socio-economic costs are increased unemployment and limitations to European competitiveness in the global market. Drawing on field studies {{in a wide range of}} manufacturing and service industries, the network will develop policies for responding to this problem. Our recommendations will include <b>innovatory</b> <b>approaches</b> to human resource development, the design of new technologies themselves and the organisation of work within enterprises. Exploitation activities will be aimed at five main groups: policy makers at European, regional, national and company levels; the academic community; HRD professionals; trainers and managers in enterprises; and social partners. The main exploitation activities will be: publications; conferences and symposia; dialogue and networking. The project aims to impact on two of the five major socio-economic challenges identified in TSER: a socially sustainable development, and improving the quality of life in Europe...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{following}} article {{deals with}} customer personality in the CRM systems. Its <b>innovatory</b> <b>approach</b> consists in {{the method of}} segmentation performed {{according to one of}} psychological factors- personality. The analysis {{is based on the assumption}} that the class of customers can be divided into separate types. This is possible due to the preservation of a large internal homogeneity within every type (homogeneous groups) and a considerable differentiation among types. The article argues that the classification of customers should be based on the criterion which has an essential influence on their behavior. Such a criterion is the customer personality. Accordingly, this division can make up a good basis for the CRM strategy: 1) the elaboration of several diverse scripts of the customers service suitably to distinguished groups; 2) the individualization of the service. It can be concluded that such a modeling will allow to supplement the CRM programmes with a module of an individual and institutional customers practical service...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, many {{countries}} have embarked upon public service modernisation and development programmes that have sought to alter fundamentally {{the ways in which}} citizens are served. These programmes have varied both in their character and pace of change between member states of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). However, one common feature has been the efforts made by different public administrations, including here in Ireland, to seek the views of its citizens on a more systematic basis in order {{to improve the quality of}} services delivered, to reduce the burden of red-tape and to assist in the development of policy initiatives more geared to the needs of those for whom they are intended. It is within such a setting that this discussion paper focuses specifically on experiences to date and lessons to be learned when public service organisations seek to engage more effectively with their external customers, including not just citizens (who are themselves highly diverse in character) but a wide range of organisations (in the public, private and voluntary sectors), at local, regional, national and international levels. The terms of reference for this study were to: 1. Review and evaluate national/international documentary material, identifying and discussing the key issues to be addressed in order to consult effectively with external customers. 2. Consult with key personnel inside and outside the public service, in order to identify examples of good practice in Ireland and overseas, including <b>innovatory</b> <b>approaches.</b> 3. Explore the implications of different approaches to consultation by public service bodies through in-depth discussions in a selected number of such organisations. 4. Identify and discuss key issues to be addressed by public service bodies to encourage more widespread and effective consultation with external customers.

40|$|It {{is often}} {{observed}} that Tennyson’s poetry was profoundly influenced by his reading in astronomy, geology and science in general, and evolutionary thought {{before and after}} Darwin. This reflected the period’s intense crossover between science and what would today be called literature. The scientific paper was approaching its modern format, asserting specialist authority through formality of description and analysis (Secord, 2009). But men, and some women, of science also wrote in other and very different veins, especially when aiming at a wider audience than their specialist colleagues. They selected literary concepts and strategies from novels and poems, amongst other genres, to disseminate their work, and they drew on the moral and spiritual resources of literature (for example, A. Buckland, 2013; Purton, 2013 b, 2013 c). Thus geological books by, for instance, Charles Lyell (1797 - 1875) and Hugh Miller (1802 - 1856) may, and indeed should, be read as works of literature as much as of science (O’Connor, 2007; Secord, 2014, 138 - 172). Conversely, novelists and poets seized on new scientific concepts and their implications for the origin and meaning {{of the world in}} which they lived. They were stimulated to develop <b>innovatory</b> <b>approaches,</b> and explored the new ideas in their works, helping to disseminate these ideas more widely. Geology, the most romantic and exciting of the new sciences, drew much of this attention (Rudwick, 2005, 2007, 2014, reviews the then state of the science, and O’Connor, 2007, its literary and popular deployment). In the first part of this paper we examined Tennyson’s relationship with geology during his earlier years (Anderson and Taylor, 2015; also Taylor and Anderson, 2015). In this second part, we consider his later engagement with the science, and particularly his interest in animals of the past. We also clarify some hitherto puzzling allusions in the literature...|$|E
40|$|About the book: Everyone {{remembers a}} good teacher. But across the world, in {{developing}} country contexts, millions of children, seventy-five {{million at the}} last estimate, {{have no access to}} schooling and no opportunity to engage with any teachers at all. And of the lucky ones in schools the chances of meeting a teacher to remember are dropping. In {{some parts of the world}} qualified teachers are a rarity with millions of untrained adults taking over the role of teacher. Schools and teachers in many parts of the world face significant challenges. Enrolment is expanding to meet the millennium targets to have every child in school by 2015. Yet the supply of good quality teachers is falling behind. Not the least because the image of the teaching profession is deterring many from entering the profession. Poor status, low salaries and inadequate working conditions characterise perceptions of teachers in many countries. There are strong critiques of the one dimensional, didactic approach to pedagogic practice. Despite this, millions of teachers are carrying out, often heroically, the task of educating a newly enfranchized generation of learners. This book focuses on the teacher role. It examines the problems of finding and retaining teachers and also on how these teachers can be supported, trained and educated. The book examines the ways in which teachers can help in raising achievement levels and contributing to poverty alleviation. The main argument of this book is that existing policy structures around teachers, whilst barely adequate in the twentieth century, are not adequate at all in the twenty-first. The book identifies the global pressures on teaching and shows how these are particularly acute in developing economies. In summarising the key policy and research issues and analysing <b>innovatory</b> <b>approaches</b> to teacher supply, retention, training, education and career enhancement, the book provides a key text for policy-makers, researchers and others working in this important development area. ...|$|E

It is {{licensed}} under a Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivs 3. 0 Unported License (CC-BY-ND) The Engineering Students Understanding Mathematics (ESUM) project was a developmental research project aimed at enhancing the quality of mathematics learning of students of materials engineering {{in terms of their}} engagement and conceptual understanding. The initial phase of the project consisted of an innovation in mathematics teaching-learning which was designed, implemented and studied, with feedback and concomitant modification to practice. Details are reported in Jaworski (2011 b). The second phase of the project, reported here, focused more overtly on the analysis of data in relation to theoretical perspectives. In particular, Activity Theory (AT) was used to make sense of emerging findings. A literature review was undertaken and showed evidence of so-called ‘constructivist’ methods being introduced to the teaching of mathematics in higher education (HE). Dissemination has taken place both internally within the institution and externally and is still ongoing. It has generated interest and activity beyond the local setting. Findings from the project include students’ views on elements of the innovation, improved scores on tests and examinations compared with earlier cohorts and students’ strategic approaches to their studies and ways in which this creates tensions with lecturers’ aims in designing the <b>innovatory</b> <b>approach.</b> The gains from the projects can be seen in terms of developing knowledge of the complexities of achieving principles for more conceptual understandings of mathematics within the context and culture in which teaching and learning take place...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{research and}} development in registration of images containing rigid structures using deformable models. In the existing methods of deformable image registration, the feature based methods using purely interpolation are often used {{under the assumption that}} all parts of the image can be deformed non-linearly. However, it is not applicable for some images, such as medical images which contain some bony structures. Therefore, it is more reasonable in image registration to treat the parts representing rigid structures differently from the remaining parts. A novel method is proposed in this thesis that uses a flexible spring-mass system to provide a good representation of image information. Anatomical structures are represented by spring masses and their interconnecting springs located along the structure boundaries. Hence, the system can treat some pre-selected parts of an image as rigid structures, whilst it is possible to elastically deform the rest of the image. The deformation caused by the displacement of the features is modelled by the spring-mass system via the motion equation. To ensure high quality registration, the image content is introduced as external forces acting on the masses and is iteratively employed into the motion equation to achieve a better and better registration result (It {{should be noted that the}} improvement in registration quality is limited by the quality and content of original images). The performance of the proposed method is shown using simulated data, and is validated using real Computed Tomography (CT) images. Objective measures and images that enable subjective evaluation of the new technique are provided. The proposed method is fast, robust and offers high registration accuracy. This is due to the following developments: • <b>Innovatory</b> <b>approach</b> based on the spring-mass system for image registration. • A new spring force formula to support the new method. • External forces based on image content are employed and applied via an iterative approach to ensure the high quality registration. • A fast initialisation method for the spring-mass system generation. • A fast interpolation technique to reduce the computation time in the iterative registration stage...|$|R
40|$|Violence, {{democracy}} and rights {{are issues that}} are not fully addressed in research methodology literatures, yet violence is of vital interest in substantive and theoretical debates across the social sciences, education, philosophy, politics and cultural studies. Methodology needs to be informed by, and be relevant to, the debates and practices within and across these perspectives on the worlds of everyday life. Research is fundamentally entwined with the political, the ethical and the legal. When it presumes the neutrality of method and ignores its radical roots of inquiry, it {{is in danger of}} being politically co-opted and ethically naïve. Research that reveals what is at stake politically, ethically and legally is typically open to accusations of being partisan and therefore political. It cannot avoid being political in the broadest sense of the word, and consequently the researcher cannot escape – through some mystical notion of being ‘objective’ – the political, ethical and legal consequences of undertaking research. Research is vital to the construction of public spaces for debate, decision making and action. Hence, there is a close relationship between methodological practices, research design and the conditions under which violence, {{democracy and}} rights can be addressed. Researching Violence, Democracy and the Rights of People explores what is at stake methodologically (both theoretically and practically) for researchers seeking to expand opportunities for people to become visible upon the public stages of debate, decision making and action, and thus make audible their experiences of wrongs and injustices, express their rights, and engage democratically in processes of change. Drawing on international contributions and contexts, this book introduces readers to the complex realities of real research and the substantive issues that their methodological approaches strive to deal with. It will benefit undergraduate and postgraduate students as well as post-doctoral and experienced researchers across a range of cultural and social science disciplines, as well as educational and sociological researchers. Its aim is to explore and {{contribute to the development of}} <b>innovatory</b> <b>approaches</b> to engaging in research that make a difference in the lives of people. ...|$|E
40|$|E-government is a {{comparatively}} recent phenomenon. Within {{a short period}} of time,most industrialised countries have embarked upon a programme of making public services and information about the public sector available via the Internet and other Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). Considerable {{progress has been made in}} the online provision of government information to citizens electronically, and it is becoming more common for this information to be organised around citizens’ needs and life situations, rather than around administrative structures. In the area of online service provision, however, less progress has been made. Although it is in many countries possible to view, print and submit some application forms and other documents online, full online service transactions (such as applying for a permit/licence and receiving a decision electronically) are still something of a rarity. E-government is clearly an important area of policy development and indeed has the potential to change the way in which the public sector operates, both internally and in relation to its customers. In Ireland, e-government has been the focus of significant attention as its importance for the public service modernisation programme as a whole has been recognised. This study sets out to provide a clearer understanding of both what e-government is, and where its limits lie; to paint a picture of the developmental stage that Ireland has reached to date; to compare Ireland to other countries with advanced e-government; and to point out ways in which the e-government agenda can be further shaped and advanced. The terms of reference for this study were to: 1. review and evaluate national/international evidence on relevant e-government initiatives to improve the quality of, and access to, public services with particular reference to the decentralisation of delivery; 2. undertake a number of in-depth case studies at national and local levels in order to explore the management issues and challenges raised by <b>innovatory</b> <b>approaches</b> to e-government and service decentralisation; 3. in the light of best practice and the lessons that can be learned from experiences to date, identify how such key challenges may be most successfully addressed...|$|E
40|$|Using online social {{networking}} to improve learning is often confused with {{social networking}} for {{personal and social}} reasons, states Gerry White in DERN.. Social networks in education can be usefully deployed to increase student engagement and improve learning, especially where a focus on discussion-led learning and student engagement with course material are incorporated into a course. Social networking to enhance student engagement requires <b>innovatory</b> <b>approaches</b> to course-work and consistent staff participation in the online activities. An exciting and innovative approach that utilised social networking and measured student engagement has been described in a paper Beyond marks: new tools to visualise student engagement via social networking {{which can be found}} in the open online journal Research in Learning Technology. The paper is refreshing because it demonstrates how course leaders can innovatively use social networking services to engage students in the content and also to assess student performance. Although Facebook is a very well-known and used global social networking service, the researchers have used Friendfeed because of its capacity for non-reciprocal subscriptions that link other participants. The researchers analysed Friendfeed logs and graphically showed the networking clusters of student activity. In addition, the researchers codified and examined online student contributions and gathered student feedback via a questionnaire. As a part of their course-work, students were required to make regular significant online academic contributions reflecting on the content as distinct from engaging in social or personal discussions for which they deferred to Facebook. The researchers were also the course leaders of this inventive approach to engaging students, in a ten week science course. Students could submit status updates, comments, questions about the course and shared links but to quality for credit, external links had to be ‘accompanied by a short commentary explaining how and why it [was] relevant to academic study’ (p. 3). Significant reflective comments on the course content or commentary added to discussion threads were also given assessment credit. The researchers noted that ‘females make more significantly contributions than males’ (p. 4) but that ‘typical male students tend to be strategically focussed on meeting assessment criteria’ (p. 5). However, these statistics indicated the behaviour of the entire cohort rather than individual students. Interestingly, a male student ‘made the highest number of academically-relevant comments’ (p. 5). The researchers deployed a number of research methods for analysing who was talking to whom, what they were talking about and why they were talking as they were. The analysis revealed that three communities of students formed: a very active group that interacted with staff, a smaller group that chatted amongst themselves and a medium sized group that interacted with the whole group but remained on the periphery of the main discussion (p. 7). The researchers clearly demonstrated that to inform educational practices, popular social networks can be deployed as a part of course-work, although the educational activities need to be carefully designed, so that they can be closely related to the course-work. In the science course that was analysed, staff participated in the online social networking activities and led discussions. There is a suggestion that where teaching staff are engaged in student networks that the networks may become higher performing activities. Beyond marks: new tools to visualise student engagement via social networking is a demonstration of successfully using social networks in which ‘student peer networks leverage academic input for maximum engagement’ and for ‘more subtle and effective ways for educators to measure and guide student engagement with academic learning’ (p. 12). This research introduces a successful new method for course leaders that makes use of digital technologies. Beyond marks: new tools to visualise student engagement via social networking is compelling reading for course leaders.

40|$|Innovation {{is crucial}} to the {{successful}} development of small to medium-sized enterprises- and SMEs themselves are key to the continuing growth of the economy. Yet the owner/managers of many SMEs perceive the existence of many barriers to innovation. Whether such obstacles are real or merely perceived makes little difference to the strategic management and marketing practice of these firms. To illustrate this problem, this article reports both quantitative and qualitative research about barriers to innovation in smaller firms. A postal survey of 375 owner/managers who empoly fewer than 50 people indicated these managers 2 ̆ 7 views and concerns about a range of innovation-related issues such as high tax rates, innovation "costs" and cultural lethargy towards innovation. The owner/managers also suggested how such barriers to innovation might be overcome. These opinions were subsequently contrasted with those of officialdom, elicited from in-depth interviews with a sample of senior officials of state support agencies. This enabled some interesting observation and illumination about obstacle and possible incentives to greater levels of innovation in SMEs. A number of policy recommendations are proffered, including a suggestion that the state support agencies themselves be more <b>innovatory</b> in their <b>approach...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on {{research}} which aimed to describe and account for patients' experiences in eight unexceptional examples of predominantly long-stay geriatric wards, each in a different hospital. Observational methods were used to document the experiences of 86 patients. Other data on ward work processes were drawn from interviews with Ward Sisters and Consultants, written records and informal conversations with ward participants. Data analysis {{was based on the}} type and amount of inhumane treatment which patients suffered. In focussing on inhumane treatment and developing a systematic and non-emotive analysis of its origins, the research breaks new ground. Patients in all the wards experienced inhumane treatment, but this varied in kind and quantity. It is shown that poor staffing levels and heavy workload cannot by themselves account for the inhumane treatment of patients which was observed. Instead, the beliefs, work practices and interrelationships between Consultants and Ward Sisters emerged as important. Where the work of long-term care was viewed as a valuable and important task, there was evidence of attempts to offer personalised care to patients. Where long-term care was viewed as low-status work, an outcome of 'failure' of the medical cure system, there was scant evidence of personal attention to patients' needs. The nature of inhumane treatment which was observed enables a new perspective to be offered on what constitutes humane treatment and how this might be reliably secured in practice. Eight practical recommendations are {{made on the basis of}} research findings. Consideration is also given to ways in which the <b>innovatory</b> social research <b>approach</b> of documenting inhumane treatment might be further developed and applied in practice by professionals seeking to monitor and improve patients' experiences in geriatric wards...|$|R
40|$|Using {{prescription}} {{analyses and}} questionnaires, the way drug information {{was used by}} general medical practitioners during the drug adoption process was studied. Three new drugs were considered; an innovation and two 'me-too' products. The innovation was accepted by general practitioners via a contagion process, information passing among doctors. The 'me-too' preparations were accepted more slowly and by a process which {{did not include the}} contagion effect. 'Industrial' information such as direct mail was used more at the 'awareness' stage of the adoption process while 'professional' sources of information such as articles in medical journals were used more to evaluate a new product. It was shown that 'industrial' information was preferred by older single practice doctors who did not specialise, had a first degree only and who did not dispense their own prescriptions. Doctors were divided into early and late-prescribers by using the date they first prescribed the <b>innovatory</b> drug. Their <b>approach</b> to drug information sources was further studied and it was shown that the early-prescriber issued slightly more prescriptions per month, had a larger list size, read fewer journals and generally rated industrial sources of information more highly than late-prescribers. The prescribing habits of three consultant rheumatologists were analysed and compared with those of the general practitioners in the community which they served. Very little association was noted and the influence of the consultant on the prescribing habits of general practitioners was concluded to be low. The consultants influence was suggested to be of two components, active and passive; the active component being the most influential. Journal advertising and advertisement placement were studied for one of the 'me-too' drugs. It was concluded that advertisement placement should be based on the reading patterns of general practitioners and not on ad-hoc data gathered by representatives as was the present practice. A model was proposed relating the 'time to prescribe' a new drug to the variables suggested throughout this work. Four of these variables were shown to be significant. These were, the list size, the medical age of the prescriber, the number of new preparations prescribed in a given time and the number of partners in the practice...|$|R
30|$|Mosquito bites {{can give}} an {{unpleasant}} feeling and may transmit the vector disease such as dengue or malaria to humankind. Mosquitoes {{are attracted to}} human blood containing protein to develop their eggs, biting human to another human, thereby transmitting the vector disease to human. The genus Aedes mosquitoes are responsible to transmit the vector of dengue all over the worlds with billion people suffer from the disease and also death cases reported (Division of Vector-Borne Disease 2012). There {{are only a few}} vaccines to treat the virus caused by mosquito bites, however, in the case of dengue, researchers are yet to find the vaccines for it (Farag et al. 2011) the best way is for people to avoid mosquito bites. Repellents are practical products and economical means to prevent the transmissions of the mosquito vector disease (Yang and Ma 2005). Hence, personal protective measure must be taken to protect human from mosquito bites. Applying mosquito repellents either on their skin, house, even on their clothing or upholsteries may help in protecting human against mosquito bites. Repellents that applied to skin or clothing produce a vapor layer that has an offensive smell or taste and makes a person unattractive for feeding and therefore repels the mosquito (Brown and Hebert 1997; Fradin and Day 2002) several studies showed that most repellents was developed in the form of lotions, cream, essential oils, spray, or solution where in most cases require direct application to the human skin (Amer and Mehlhorn 2006; Ariffin et al. 2012; Fei and Xin 2007; Fradin and Day 2002; Snodgrass 1992; Yates et al. 2005). Treating the garment fabrics with repellent agent is another way to avoid mosquito bites as the big proportion of the human skin is covered by the treated garment thus, avoiding it to be exposed to the blood sucking mosquitoes. Imparting the mosquito repellents onto the textile and cloth impregnating laundry emulsions application is one of the <b>innovatory</b> and practical <b>approach</b> in daily routine to driving away the blood sucking arthropods from people (Brown and Hebert 1997; Maheshwari and Ramya 2014). The present inventions of mosquito repellents to be imparted into the fabric can be produced using various techniques such as addition during rinse cycle, direct coating, finishing like cloth impregnating laudry emulsions and others (Anitha et al. 2011; Anuar and Yusof 2016; Farag et al. 2011; Fei and Xin 2007; Snodgrass 1992; Sumithra and Vasugi Raja 2012; Troutman 2009; Van Winkle 2002). The textiles with mosquito repelling features exhibit a character that can drive the mosquito away from the treated textile, or by knocking down the mosquitoes when it is in contact with the treated textiles. The applications of the mosquito repellent feature must not damage the original characteristic of the textile materials itself. The value added of repellent properties also for textile material is a novel approaches as it by means can help to reduce the statistics of vector disease cases without giving a side effect to the wearer. According to a study by (Stajkovic and Milutinovic 2013), the recommendation regarding usage of repellent product for textile materials is “the product should be applied in a thin layer on the skin surface, clothing or both, it should not be applied under clothing”.|$|R
