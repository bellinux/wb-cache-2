5|$|Hurricane Gustav was {{the only}} major {{hurricane}} to form during the 1990 Atlantic hurricane season. Developing out of a tropical wave on August24, Gustav tracked westward across the Atlantic Ocean, steadily intensifying. The storm reached hurricane-status on August26 and reached its initial peak intensity as a strong Category 2 hurricane the following day. After turning towards the north and weakening due to increased wind shear, the storm encountered more favorable conditions and re-intensified, attaining peak winds of 120mph (195km/h) around 0600UTC on August31. Gradual weakening {{took place in the}} following days. on September 2, the former hurricane underwent an extratropical transition and dissipated shortly after completing <b>it.</b> <b>At</b> <b>that</b> time, the system was located roughly 230miles (370km) south of Iceland.|$|E

25|$|Due to its {{proximity}} to the rebels, {{as well as its}} status as a major commercial and cultural center, the city of Basra was a prime target for the Zanj. 'Ali ibn Muhammad had led an aborted revolt in the city in 868, {{and it was one of}} his first objectives after the start of the Zanj rebellion in 869. Although the Zanj had failed to take <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time, a significant number of Basrans were subsequently killed at the Battle of the Barges, and the city was thereafter forced to rely on the Abbasid government to send troops for protection. The fall of al-Ubulla and of al-Ahwaz in 870 further instilled a state of panic in the city, and many of its inhabitants decided to evacuate to safer areas.|$|E

25|$|After four hours, at midday, {{the sirens}} {{across the country}} sounded and Poland went back to work. The {{magnitude}} of the strike shocked {{the leadership of the}} Polish United Workers' Party, especially when it turned out that members of the party had universally participated in <b>it</b> (<b>at</b> <b>that</b> time, Solidarity had some 9 million members, but 12-14 million people took part in the strike). Meanwhile, Lech Wałęsa's advisors, such as Tadeusz Mazowiecki, Bronisław Geremek told the leader of Solidarity that the general strike, planned for March 30, would mean civil war and the risk was too high. Diplomats from Western countries were also aware of the tense situation in Poland; therefore, military attaches from the United Kingdom, the United States and West Germany were ordered not to leave Poland. In case of a Soviet invasion of Poland, the Americans were planning a military blockade of Cuba.|$|E
25|$|In {{the period}} {{following}} the revolution, {{and during the}} communist persecutions up to 1970, no canonizations took place. Only in 1970 did the Holy Synod {{made a decision to}} canonize a missionary to Japan, Nicholas Kasatkin (1836–1912). In 1977, St. Innocent of Moscow (1797–1879), the Metropolitan of Siberia, the Far East, the Aleutian Islands, Alaska, and Moscow was also canonized. In 1978 it was proclaimed that the Russian Orthodox Church had created a prayer order for Meletius of Kharkov, which practically signified his canonization because that was the only possible way to do <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time. Similarly, the saints of other Orthodox Churches were added to the Church calendar: in 1962 St. John the Russian, in 1970 St. Herman of Alaska, in 1993 Silouan the Athonite, the elder of Mount Athos, already canonized in 1987 by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. In the 1980s the Russian Orthodox Church re-established the process for canonization; a practice that had ceased for half a century.|$|E
25|$|On June 7, 1904, Kid Curry was {{tracked down}} by a posse outside of Parachute, Colorado. Curry and two others had robbed a Denver and Rio Grande train outside Parachute. As they escaped, they stole fresh horses owned by Roll Gardner and a neighbour. The next morning, when they {{discovered}} their horses had been stolen, Gardner and the neighbour set out {{in pursuit of the}} gang. They joined up with a posse and continued tracking the outlaws. The gang shot Gardner's and his neighbour's horses from under them; Gardner found cover while his neighbour started running. Kid Curry took aim at the neighbour and Gardner shot Curry. The wounded Curry decided to end <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> time, and fatally shot himself in the head to avoid capture. The other two robbers escaped. The rifle Gardner used is still in the family today. Rumors persist that Curry was not killed in Parachute and was misidentified, having actually departed for South America with Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Charlie Siringo resigned from the Pinkertons, believing they got the wrong man.|$|E

25|$|The bridge {{question}} has again been revived {{after many years}} of slumber, and business men in Quebec seem hopeful that something will come of it, though the placing of a subsidy on the statute book is but {{a small part of the}} work to be accomplished, as some of its enthusiastic promoters will, ere long, discover. Both Federal and Provincial Governments seem disposed to contribute towards the cost, and the City of Quebec will also be expected to do its share. Many of our people have objected to any contribution being given by the city unless the bridge is built opposite the town, and the CHRONICLE like every other good citizen of Quebec would prefer to see it constructed at Diamond Harbor, and has contended in the interests of the city for this site as long as there seemed to be any possibility of securing it there. It would still do so if it appeared that our people could have <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> site. A bridge at Diamond Harbor would, it estimated, cost at least eight millions. It would be very nice to have, with its double track, electric car track, and roads for vehicles and pedestrians, and would no doubt create a goodly traffic between the two towns, and be one of the show works of the continent.|$|E
