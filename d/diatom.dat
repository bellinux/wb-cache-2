5|$|A <b>diatom</b> floristic {{study of}} the lagoon {{revealed}} that it contains 41 species and is a rich storehouse of psychrophilic photosynthetic bacteria. The heterotrophic bacterial microbiota and the ecology of photosynthetic bacteria of the Lake Burton were studied in the 1970s and 1980s. Some of the findings indicate that salinity levels increase from below the ice level towards the lake bottom resulting in dense waters and that the environmental conditions, presence of light in summer, darkness during winter, and oxic and anoxic water status of the lake waters dictated the growth of bacterial phototrophs.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Diatoms</b> {{are mostly}} non-motile; however, sperm {{found in some}} species can be flagellated, though {{motility}} is usually limited to a gliding motion. [...] In centric <b>diatoms,</b> the small male gametes have one flagellum while the female gametes are large and non-motile (oogamous). Conversely, in pennate <b>diatoms</b> both gametes lack flagella (isoogamous). [...] Certain araphid species, that is pennate <b>diatoms</b> without a raphe, have been documented as anisogamous and are, therefore, considered to represent a transitional stage between centric and raphid pennate <b>diatoms,</b> <b>diatoms</b> with a raphe.|$|R
5000|$|Zoids are not {{as common}} in the <b>diatoms</b> as in the algal families. <b>Diatoms</b> are {{generally}} broken into two categories, the centric <b>diatoms</b> and the pennate <b>diatoms.</b> Of these two categories, only the centric <b>diatoms</b> {{have been found to}} produce zoids and only the male gametes have flagella. These motile, male gametes have been found to only possess one flagellum with no signs of even a rudimentary second flagella. [...] This deviates from the standard definition of a heterokont. Because of this deviation, <b>diatoms</b> are often classified as [...] "stramenopiles".|$|R
50|$|In some taxonomic schemes, the pennate <b>diatoms</b> {{are divided}} into two groups: pennate <b>diatoms</b> without a raphe, known as araphids (order Fragilariophyceae), and pennate <b>diatoms</b> with a raphe, known as raphids (order Bacillariophyceae).|$|R
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, {{following}} the major decline in brown pelican numbers in Louisiana from DDT poisoning, 500 pelicans were imported from Florida to augment and re-establish the population; over 300 subsequently died in April and May 1975 from poisoning by the pesticide endrin. About 14,000 pelicans, including 7500 American white pelicans, perished from botulism after eating {{fish from the}} Salton Sea in 1990. In 1991 abnormal numbers of brown pelicans and Brandt's cormorants died at Santa Cruz, California, when their food fish (anchovies) were contaminated with neurotoxic domoic acid, produced by the <b>diatom</b> Pseudo-nitzschia.|$|E
5|$|Radiolaria {{have left}} a {{geological}} record {{since at least the}} Ordovician times, and their mineral fossil skeletons can be tracked across the K–Pg boundary. There is no evidence of mass extinction of these organisms, and there is support for high productivity of these species in southern high latitudes as a result of cooling temperatures in the early Paleocene. Approximately 46% of <b>diatom</b> species survived the transition from the Cretaceous to the Upper Paleocene. This suggests a significant turnover in species, but not a catastrophic extinction of diatoms, across the K–Pg boundary.|$|E
5|$|Many parasites {{latch onto}} whales, notably whale lice and whale barnacles. Almost all species of whale lice are {{specialized}} towards a certain species of whale, and {{there can be}} more than one species per whale. Whale lice eat dead skin, resulting in minor wounds in the skin. Whale louse infestations are especially evident in right whales, where colonies propagate on their callosities. Though not a parasite, whale barnacles latch onto the skin of a whale during their larval stage. However, in doing so it does not harm nor benefit the whale, so their relationship is often labeled as an example of commensalism. Some baleen whales will deliberately rub themselves on substrate to dislodge parasites. Some species of barnacle, such as Conchoderma auritum and whale barnacles, attach to the baleen plates, though this seldom occurs. A species of copepod, Balaenophilus unisetus, inhabits baleen plates of whales in tropical waters. A species of Antarctic <b>diatom,</b> Cocconeis ceticola, forms a film on the skin, which takes a month to develop; this film causes minor damage to the skin. They are also plagued by internal parasites such as stomach worms, cestodes, nematodes, liver flukes, and acanthocephalans.|$|E

40|$|<b>Diatoms</b> are {{photosynthetic}} unicellular, eukaryotic, microorganisms (algae) {{that are}} distinguished by their silicified (SiO 2 -nH 2 O) cell walls. They {{have often been}} employed to assess salinity, pH, and nutrient conditions. Our data suggest that, {{they may also be}} used to assess suspended solid levels in streams. The ratio of motile to attached benthic <b>diatoms</b> from five different stream sites in Hong Kong was correlated with the level of suspended solids for each of these sites. Sites with high concentrations of suspended solids had a high percentage of motile <b>diatoms</b> on their rocks while sites with low concentrations of suspended solids had a high percentage of attached (non-motile) <b>diatoms</b> on their rocks. When water carried by a stream has a high concentration of suspended solids, benthic <b>diatoms</b> in the stream are often covered in a layer of silt. Those <b>diatoms</b> that are motile are able to get on top of this silt layer while attached <b>diatoms</b> cannot. If the silt layer is not washed away, the attached <b>diatoms</b> perish and the percentage of motile <b>diatoms</b> increases. Thus, streams with high concentrations of suspended solids display a higher proportion of motile <b>diatoms</b> than do clear water streams with low concentrations of suspended solids. © 2005 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

25|$|The <b>diatom</b> endosymbiont is {{bounded by}} a single membrane, inside it are chloroplasts with four membranes. Like the <b>diatom</b> endosymbiont's <b>diatom</b> ancestor, the chloroplasts have triplet thylakoids and pyrenoids.|$|E
25|$|Some dinophytes, like Kryptoperidinium and Durinskia have a <b>diatom</b> (heterokontophyte) derived {{chloroplast}}. These chloroplasts are {{bounded by}} up to five membranes, (depending on whether you count the entire <b>diatom</b> endosymbiont as the chloroplast, or just the red algal derived chloroplast inside it). The <b>diatom</b> endosymbiont has been reduced relatively little—it still retains its original mitochondria, and has endoplasmic reticulum, ribosomes, a nucleus, and of course, red algal derived chloroplasts—practically a complete cell, all inside the host's endoplasmic reticulum lumen. However the <b>diatom</b> endosymbiont can't store its own food—its storage polysaccharide is found in granules in the dinophyte host's cytoplasm instead. The <b>diatom</b> endosymbiont's nucleus is present, but it probably can't be called a nucleomorph because it {{shows no sign of}} genome reduction, and might have even been expanded. Diatoms have been engulfed by dinoflagellates at least three times.|$|E
25|$|The entire genomes of the centric <b>diatom,</b> Thalassiosira pseudonana (32.4 Mb), and the pennate <b>diatom,</b> Phaeodactylum tricornutum (27.4 Mb), {{have been}} sequenced. Comparisons {{of the two}} fully sequenced <b>diatom</b> genomes finds that the P. tricornutum genome {{includes}} fewer genes (10,402 opposed to 11,776) than T. pseudonana and no major synteny (gene order) could be detected between the two genomes. T. pseudonana genes show an average of ~1.52 introns per gene as opposed to 0.79 in P. tricornutum, suggesting recent widespread intron gain in the centric <b>diatom.</b> Despite relatively recent evolutionary divergence (90 million years), the extent of molecular divergence between centrics and pennates indicates rapid evolutionary rates within the Bacillariophyceae compared to other eukaryotic groups. Comparative genomics also established that a specific class of transposable elements, the <b>Diatom</b> Copia-like retrotransposons (or CoDis), has been significantly amplified in the P. tricornutum genome with respect to T. pseudonana, constituting 5.8 and 1% of the respective genomes.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn Plantae, the Calvin–Benson–Bassham (CBB) {{cycle is}} highly {{regulated}} {{and most of}} its enzymes have been thoroughly studied. Since <b>diatoms</b> arose as a result of secondary endosymbiosis with one or more Plantae ancestors, their precise evolutionary history is enigmatic and complex resulting in biochemical variations on the original CBB cycle theme. The Rubisco Michaelis constant for CO 2 is higher in <b>diatoms</b> than land plants and the nuclear-encoded Rubisco activase in Plantae is replaced by an analogous chloroplast-encoded CbbX (Calvin–Benson–Bassham protein X) in <b>diatoms.</b> In the CBB cycle reduction phase, phosphoglycerate kinase in <b>diatoms</b> is redox-regulated and similar to that in red algae; however, glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is not redox-regulated, unlike in Plantae. The phosphoribulokinase (PRK) -GAPDH-CP 12 complex found in many photosynthetic organisms has not yet been found in <b>diatoms,</b> but a ferredoxin-NADP reductase (FNR) -GAPDH-CP 12 complex has been found in one species. In the CBB cycle regeneration phase, sedoheptulose 1, 7 -bisphosphatase and PRK are not redox-regulated in <b>diatoms,</b> unlike in Plantae. Regulation at the transcriptional level seems to be important in <b>diatoms.</b> CBB cycle enzyme properties appear to be variable among <b>diatoms,</b> but this view relies on results from a few model species: a greater range of <b>diatoms</b> need to be studied to test this...|$|R
25|$|The Cretaceous {{record of}} diatoms is limited, but recent studies reveal a {{progressive}} diversification of <b>diatom</b> types.

25|$|The {{fossil record}} of diatoms {{has largely been}} {{established}} through the recovery of their siliceous frustules in marine and non-marine sediments. Although diatoms have both a marine and non-marine stratigraphic record, <b>diatom</b> biostratigraphy, {{which is based on}} time-constrained evolutionary originations and extinctions of unique taxa, is only well developed and widely applicable in marine systems. The duration of <b>diatom</b> species ranges have been documented through the study of ocean cores and rock sequences exposed on land. Where <b>diatom</b> biozones are well established and calibrated to the geomagnetic polarity time scale (e.g., Southern Ocean, North Pacific, eastern equatorial Pacific), diatom-based age estimates may be resolved to within <100,000 years, although typical age resolution for Cenozoic <b>diatom</b> assemblages is several hundred thousand years.|$|E

40|$|Predation {{pressure}} of Noctiluca scintillans on <b>diatoms</b> and thecate dinoflagellates was investigated off the western coast of Kyushu, Japan by {{a comparison between}} the taxonomic composition of prey in the food vacuoles of N. scintillans {{and that in the}} ambient water. The ratios of total <b>diatoms</b> and centric <b>diatoms</b> in the food vacuoles were higher than those in the ambient water, while thecate dinoflagellates and pennate daitoms showed a reverse trend. These results indicate that predation {{pressure of}} N. scintillans on total <b>diatoms</b> is higher than on thecate dinoflagellates, and that the pressure on centric <b>diatoms</b> is stronger than that on pennate ones. Among the centric <b>diatoms,</b> Chaetoceros and Bacteriastrum were dominant in the food vacuoles and their respective ratios were higher than in the ambient water.

25|$|The first {{insights}} into {{the properties of the}} Phaeodactylum tricornutum gene repertoire were described using 1,000 expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Subsequently, the number of ESTs was extended to 12,000 and the <b>diatom</b> EST database was constructed for functional analyses. These sequences have been used to make a comparative analysis between P. tricornutum and the putative complete proteomes from the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae, and the <b>diatom</b> Thalassiosira pseudonana. The <b>diatom</b> EST database now consists of over 200,000 ESTs from P. tricornutum (16 libraries) and T. pseudonana (7 libraries) cells grown in a range of different conditions, many of which correspond to different abiotic stresses.|$|E
25|$|Importantly, <b>diatom</b> {{genomics}} brought {{much information}} about the extent and dynamics of the endosymbiotic gene transfer (EGT) process. Comparison of the T. pseudonana proteins with homologs in other organisms suggested that hundreds have their closest homologs in the Plantae lineage. EGT towards <b>diatom</b> genomes can be illustrated {{by the fact that}} the T. pseudonana genome encodes six proteins which are most closely related to genes encoded by the Guillardia theta (cryptomonad) nucleomorph genome. Four of these genes are also found in red algal plastid genomes, thus demonstrating successive EGT from red algal plastid to red algal nucleus (nucleomorph) to heterokont host nucleus. More recent phylogenomic analyses of <b>diatom</b> proteomes provided evidence for a prasinophyte-like endosymbiont in the common ancestor of chromalveolates as supported by the fact the 70% of <b>diatom</b> genes of Plantae origin are of green lineage provenance and that such genes are also found in the genome of other stramenopiles. Therefore, it was proposed that chromalveolates are the product of serial secondary endosymbiosis first with a green algae, followed by a second one with a red algae that conserved the genomic footprints of the previous but displaced the green plastid. However, phylogenomic analyses of <b>diatom</b> proteomes and chromalveolate evolutionary history will likely take advantage of complementary genomic data from under-sequenced lineages such as red algae.|$|E

40|$|Research {{to develop}} tools {{to assess the}} {{ecological}} status of phytobenthos, as required in Annex V of the European Union Water Framework Directive, has focussed largely on <b>diatoms.</b> <b>Diatoms</b> are often the most abundant and diverse group of algae within the phytobenthos and have been used widely for other monitoring purposes. However, there is little empirical justification {{for the use of}} <b>diatoms</b> as proxies for the wider phytobenthos. In this paper, we re-examine an existing dataset compiled largely from littoral samples from standing waters in the English Lake District and compared transfer functions for total phosphorus, dissolved inorganic carbon, conductivity and calcium concentration generated from <b>diatoms</b> and non-diatoms separately and together. The results show that transfer functions generated from <b>diatoms</b> alone are as powerful as transfer functions generated from <b>diatoms</b> and non-diatoms combined, while transfer functions generated from non-diatoms alone are less effective.

25|$|Biofilms in aquatic environments {{are often}} founded by <b>diatoms.</b> The exact {{purpose of these}} biofilms is unknown, however there is {{evidence}} that the EPS produced by <b>diatoms</b> facilitates both cold and salinity stress. These Eukaryotes interact with a diverse range of other organisms within a region known as the phycosphere, but importantly are the bacteria associated with <b>diatoms,</b> as {{it has been shown that}} although <b>diatoms</b> excrete EPS, they only do so when interacting with certain bacteria species.|$|R
25|$|<b>Diatom</b> {{cells are}} {{contained}} within a unique silica cell wall {{known as a}} frustule made up of two valves called thecae, that typically overlap one another. The biogenic silica composing the cell wall is synthesised intracellularly by the polymerisation of silicic acid monomers. This material is then extruded to the cell exterior and added to the wall. In most species, when a <b>diatom</b> divides to produce two daughter cells, each cell keeps {{one of the two}} halves and grows a smaller half within it. As a result, after each division cycle, the average size of <b>diatom</b> cells in the population gets smaller. Once such cells reach a certain minimum size, rather than simply divide, they reverse this decline by forming an auxospore. This expands in size to give rise to a much larger cell, which then returns to size-diminishing divisions. Auxospore production is almost always linked to meiosis and sexual reproduction.|$|E
