40|$|The infra-red {{absorption}} technique (IRA) is a line-of-sight, non-intrusive laser method, {{that provides}} the relative <b>fuel</b> <b>vapour</b> concentration in a multiphase flow with evaporation at isothermal conditions. Experiments using this technique were carried out on the LPP test rig of DLR Cologne {{in the frame of}} the EU LOPOCOTEP programme. A modular air-blast injection system with variable swirl number and fuel nozzle position was tested under several realistic gas turbine flow injection conditions. The resulting atomisation (particle size, velocity and fuel placement) has been reported by Becker $&$ Hassa cite{becker-hassa- 2004 }. This paper focuses on the complementary results on the <b>fuel</b> <b>vapour</b> phase conducted with IRA. The technique and its specific configuration are briefly described. The different vapour concentration profiles obtained are discussed. Some configurations, that were previously found to provide a discontinuous spray using a PDA sampling reconstruction technique, are investigated more detailed.

40|$|Abstract. A {{numerical}} study {{based on}} VOF {{model has been}} carried out to investigate the dynamics of water droplet impact on solid surface in microgravity in comparison with that in normal gravity to discuss the differences of the extinguishing mechanism of water mist in different gravity level. Water droplets with different initial diameters and impact velocities were considered. The simulated results show that the deformation process in microgravity lags behind that in normal gravity. And it was also found that Dmax and spread velocities are smaller in microgravity as the potential energy decreases and the time taken for a liquid droplet to reach its maximum spread has no obvious regularity. Hence, the effect of cooling the fuel surface and diluting <b>fuel</b> <b>vapour</b> with water mist in microgravity may be not as good as that in normal gravity. The critical impact Weber number for water droplet breaking up in microgravity is lower than that in normal gravity as the reduction of the value of Bond number, which may result in diluting <b>fuel</b> <b>vapour</b> with water mist in microgravity being more effective than that in normal gravity in some case...|$|R

One problem is developing materials that can mitigate an event of interplanetary spacecraft fire. A numerical simulation of piloted ignition delay time of solid fuel material for PMMA sample, subjected to various incident radiant heat fluxes and airflows was developed based on thermo-chemical solid phase model. The model incorporates, conduction, convection, surface re-radiation and radiation surface absorption heat transfer modes and solid phase chemical degradation described by first order Arrhenius law chemistry. The predicted surface temperature rise adequately captured the measured surface temperatures for forced air flow velocities induced by buoyancy relevant to normal gravity environments. Based on the measured onset temperature of ignition the critical pyrolysate, <b>fuel</b> <b>vapour</b> mass flow rate was deduced in normal gravity conditions.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{the paper is the}} {{investigation}} of the phenomena that mainly affect the mixture preparation and the combustion development in lean-premixed chambers supplied with liquid fuels (LPP). In such a study, the experimental analysis, performed by PDA based measurements, is supported and addressed by a CFD tool that is able to simulate the injection conditions, by isolating and studying some specific phenomena. A 3 -D fluid dynamic code (i. e., the FLUENT® flow solver) has been used to simulate the spray pattern in the chamber. Preliminarily, the numerical simulation refer to cold flow conditions, in order to validate the estimation of the fundamental spray parameters through the comparison with the experimental data; in a second step, the calculations employ boundary conditions close to those occurring in the actual combustor operation, in order to predict the <b>fuel</b> <b>vapour</b> distribution throughout the premixing chamber. In particular, the fuel is injected under the typical conditions that occur in the injection system of a gas turbine LPP combustor. In this phase, the experimental information are introduced in terms of air and fuel mass flow rates and of inlet characteristics of the air flow entering the prevaporizing chamber, in order to predict the <b>fuel</b> <b>vapour</b> formation and distribution. The paper also compares different approaches that have been experienced for the CFD simulation...|$|R

The previously derived singularly perturbed system of three equations (droplet radii, gas temperature and <b>fuel</b> <b>vapour</b> concentration), describing evaporation and ignition of monodisperse fuel sprays, are shown to satisfy all five assumptions of the Tikhonov theorem.

Three varieties of fuel were used, unleaded petrol (ULP) and two ULP-ethanol blends which contained 5 % and 10 % ethanol (E 5, E 10). The <b>fuel</b> <b>vapours</b> were introduced into the chamber using two methods, by injecting the vapours from wholly evaporated fuel directly, and by injecting the headspace <b>vapour</b> from <b>fuel</b> equilibrated at 38 °C. The chamber experiments were simulated using the selected mechanisms and comparisons made with collected experimental data. The SAPRC- 99 mechanism reproduced Δ(O₃–NO) more accurately for almost all fuel types and injection modes, with negligible model error for both injection modes. The average model error for MCM simulations was − 16 % and for CB 05 the average model error was − 34 %. The predictions for the CB 05 mechanism varied depending on injection mode, the Δ(O₃–NO) model error for wholly evaporated experiments was − 44 %, compared to − 24 % for headspace vapour experiments. The difference in aromatic content between experiments of different injection modes {{was likely to be}} the cause of the difference in model error for CB 05. The model error for all headspace experiments was dependent upon the initial carbon monoxide concentrations. The results for Δ(O₃–NO) were matched by the prediction of other key products, with formaldehyde predicted to within 20 % by both SAPRC and the MCM. The addition of ethanol to the base SAPRC mechanism altered the predictions of Δ(O₃–NO) by less than 2 %. Changes observed in the concentrations of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde were consistent with the expected yields from ethanol oxidation. 8 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Whilst {{the physics}} of both {{classical}} evaporation and supercritical fluid mixing are reasonably well characterized and understood in isolation, {{little is known about}} the transition from one to the other in the context of liquid fuel systems. The lack of experimental data for microscopic droplets at realistic operating conditions impedes the development of phenomenological and numerical models. To address this issue we performed systematic measurements using high-speed long-distance microscopy, for three single-component fuels (n-heptane, n-dodecane, n-hexadecane), into gas at elevated temperatures (700 - 1200 K) and pressures (2 - 11 MPa). We describe these high-speed visualizations and the time evolution of the transition from liquid droplet to <b>fuel</b> <b>vapour</b> at the microscopic level. The measurements show that the classical atomization and vaporisation processes do shift to one where surface tension forces diminish with increasing pressure and temperature, but the transition to diffusive mixing does not occur instantaneously when the fuel enters the chamber. Rather, subcritical liquid structures exhibit surface tension in the near-nozzle region and then, after time surrounded by the hot ambient gas and <b>fuel</b> <b>vapour,</b> undergo a transition to a dense miscible fluid. Although there was clear evidence of surface tension and primary atomization for n-dodecane and n-hexadecane for a period of time at all the above conditions, n-heptane appeared to produce a supercritical fluid from the nozzle outlet when injected at the most elevated conditions (1200 K, 10 MPa). This demonstrates that the time taken by a droplet to transition to diffusive mixing depends on the pressure and temperature of the gas surrounding the droplet as well as the fuel properties. We summarise our observations into a phenomenological model which describes the morphological evolution and transition of microscopic droplets from classical evaporation through a transitional mixing regime and towards diffusive mixing, as a function of operating conditions. We provide criteria for these regime transitions as reduced pressure–temperature correlations, revealing the conditions where transcritical mixing is important to diesel fuel spray mixing...|$|R
