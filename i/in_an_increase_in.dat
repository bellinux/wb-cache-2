The genetic mixing may threaten many species with extinction, while genetic erosion in crop plants may be damaging the gene pools of many species for future breeding. Many commercially useful fruits, flowers, garden herbs and trees have been produced by hybridization. One flower, Oenothera lamarckiana, was central to early genetics research into mutationism and polyploidy.|$|E

5|$|Ahmedabad {{has emerged}} as an {{important}} economic and industrial hub in India. It is the second largest producer of cotton in India, and its stock exchange is the country's second oldest. Cricket is a popular sport in Ahmedabad, which houses the 54,000-seat Sardar Patel Stadium. The effects of liberalisation of the Indian economy have energised the city's economy towards tertiary sector activities such as commerce, communication and construction. Ahmedabad's increasing population has resulted <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> the construction and housing industries resulting in recent development of skyscrapers.|$|E
5|$|All main-sequence {{stars have}} a core region where energy is {{generated}} by nuclear fusion. The temperature and density of this core are at the levels necessary to sustain the energy production that will support {{the remainder of the}} star. A reduction of energy production would cause the overlaying mass to compress the core, resulting <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> the fusion rate because of higher temperature and pressure. Likewise an increase in energy production would cause the star to expand, lowering the pressure at the core. Thus the star forms a self-regulating system in hydrostatic equilibrium that is stable over the course of its main sequence lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Cope and Marsh were {{financially and}} {{socially}} ruined by {{their attempts to}} outcompete and disgrace each other, but they made important contributions to science and the field of paleontology, and provided substantial material for further work—both scientists left behind many unopened boxes of fossils after their deaths. The efforts {{of the two men}} led to more than 136 new species of dinosaurs being discovered and described. The products of the Bone Wars resulted <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> knowledge of prehistoric life, and sparked the public's interest in dinosaurs, leading to continued fossil excavation in North America in the decades to follow.

5|$|Following their {{successive}} championships, Liverpool's fortunes declined {{as their}} side aged. Some {{of the players}} had begun their careers before the war; goalkeeper Scott {{had been in the}} side since 1912. The club began the 1923–24 season aiming to win three league titles in a row, but finished in twelfth place. They achieved fourth place the following season, which was to be their best finish until after the Second World War. Changes to the offside rule in the 1925–26 season resulted <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> the number of goals scored during matches. Liverpool contributed to this, with big victories over Manchester United and Newcastle United, but could only manage a seventh-place finish.|$|E

In addition, when Jordan's power at the ticket gates was at its highest point, the Bulls regularly sold out both their home and road games.

5|$|Mutations in the PRKACA {{gene that}} promote {{abnormal}} enzyme activity {{have been linked}} to disease of the adrenal gland. Several mutations in PRKACA have been found in patients with Cushing’s syndrome that result <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> the ability of PKA to broadly phosphorylate other proteins. One mutation in the PRKACA gene that causes an amino acid substitution of leucine to arginine in position 206, was found in over 60% of patients with adrenocortical tumors. Other mutations and genetic alterations in the PRKACA gene have been identified in adrenocortical adenomas that also disrupt PKA signaling, leading to aberrant PKA phosphorylation. The Cα gene has also been incriminated in a variety of cancers, including colon, renal, rectal, prostate, lung, breast, adrenal carcinomas and lymphomas.|$|E
5|$|Narrowing of the airways occurs due to {{inflammation}} and scarring within them. This {{contributes to the}} inability to breathe out fully. The greatest reduction in air flow occurs when breathing out, as the pressure in the chest is compressing the airways at this time. This can result in more air from the previous breath remaining within the lungs when the next breath is started, resulting <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> the total volume of air in the lungs at any given time, a process called hyperinflation or air trapping. Hyperinflation from exercise is linked to shortness of breath in COPD, as it is less comfortable to breathe in when the lungs are already partly full. Hyperinflation may also worsen during an exacerbation.|$|E

Concerning the effect on corporate investment, there is evidence that the introduction of the euro has resulted <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> investment rates and that it has made it easier for firms to access financing in Europe. The euro has most specifically stimulated investment in companies that come from countries that previously had weak currencies. A study found that the introduction of the euro accounts for 22% of the investment rate after 1998 in countries that previously had a weak currency.|$|E

5|$|The {{formation}} of a supercontinent can dramatically affect the environment. The collision of plates will result in mountain building, thereby shifting weather patterns. Sea levels may fall because of increased glaciation. The rate of surface weathering can rise, resulting <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> the rate that organic material is buried. Supercontinents can cause a drop in global temperatures {{and an increase in}} atmospheric oxygen. This, in turn, can affect the climate, further lowering temperatures.
