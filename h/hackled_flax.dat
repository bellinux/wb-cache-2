40|$|In this study, the Impregnated Fibre Bundle Test (IFBT), {{a common}} method used by carbon and glass fibre {{manufacturers}} {{to determine the}} properties of fibres used in composites, was adapted for natural fibres and validated by a round robin test on one type of natural fibres, namely flax fibres. Five European laboratories have carried out in parallel the IFBT, on the same batch of <b>hackled</b> <b>flax</b> (long fibres), to check the applicability and reliability of this modified method on natural fibres. The results were compared to the more traditional single fibre test (SFT) on elementary fibres. The back-calculated fibre stiffness shows a very low scatter between the five laboratories of less than +/- 5 % (59. 8 ± 2. 4 GPa, as measured between 0 and 0. 1 % strain). The fibre ultimate tensile strength of 527 ± 138 MPa has a higher scatter, compared to stiffness values, as this property is highly sensitive to imperfections and flaws. status: accepte...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{present study}} quantifies the {{environmental}} impacts of the production of <b>hackled</b> <b>flax</b> fibres destined for reinforcement of composite materials and compared with those for the production of glass fibres. The ecological advantages of flax fibres production over glass fibres are shown. Most of the environmental indicators used (climate change, acidification, non-renewable energy consumption [...] .) are favourable to flax fibres. However the eutrophication indicator remains high, mainly due to the use and production of fertilizers. Possible optimisation is studied by means of reduction of mechanical extraction steps and chemical products use. A sensitivity analysis highlights that the calculation method used (CML 2000 modified) is robust. The hypothesis of carbon dioxide sequestration influences the climate change indicator. The choice of allocation method, by weight or by economic value, has also a strong influence on {{the environmental impacts}}. Globally, the production of flax fibres appears to be an environmentally attractive alternative to glass fibres...|$|E

One was untreated {{and the other was}} steamed for 45 minutes at 125 degrees C in three pressure/vacuum cycles in an autoclave. Dust was collected when the two flaxes were separately processed by industrial doubler and stapler machines. From untreated flax 7. 2 g of dust was collected per kilogram of flax after two processing operations. From the steamed flax 4. 4 g of flax was obtained per kilogram after four operations. A method was devised to disperse the dust in a room to produce dust levels similar to those encountered in a dusty mill (4. 5 - 5. 7 mg/m 3). Twelve normal volunteers from the managerial staff of the linen industry of Northern Ireland inhaled the dust over six hour periods. With the untreated flax decreases were obtained in mean forced expiratory measurements of 7. 6 % in FEV 1 and 4. 5 % in FVC (p less than 0. 01). A double blind crossover comparison of similar levels of untreated and steamed flax dusts showed 30 % less impairment of the forced expirations with steamed than with untreated flax (p less than 0. 05). If these responses reflect the long term airway effects of flax dust then the steaming of flax may help in reducing byssinosis...|$|E

40|$|Today, global {{environmental}} issues, such as {{global warming and}} fossil depletion, drive a paradigm shift in material applications from conventional fossil sources to renewable sources. Following this trend, the topic of this thesis is to analyse the use of biobased resources for fibre reinforced composite fabrication. Currently {{the most widely used}} fibre reinforced composites are composed of glass fibre reinforcements and polymeric matrices. In this thesis, the biobased alternative, i. e. flax fibre, {{which is one of the}} most widely used natural fibres, is studied as a glass fibre substitute from an environmental impact point of view. Moreover, a newly emerging biobased polymer, the wheat gluten, is analysed in the study; and it is compared to a conventional polymer and to a commercially available biobased polymer from environmental impact perspective. The main question addressed in this thesis is whether there are general environmental advantages for the use of flax fibres over glass fibres, and for the wheat gluten polymer over petrochemical polymers. Although biobased materials are often perceived to be environmentally friendly, an in-depth analysis is still needed to answer this question. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is considered to be an appropriate tool for environmental impact quantification. The thesis addresses the following research objectives: (i) to deliver life cycle inventory data for the flax fibre and wheat gluten; (ii) to perform LCA studies on flax fibres compared to glass fibres in composite reinforcement applications and on wheat gluten polymer compared to the conventional low density polyethylene (LDPE) and commercially available biobased polymer polylactic acid (PLA); (iii) to conduct an in-depth analysis concerning sensitivity and uncertainty to obtain information on the robustness of the obtained results. As the initial step, a detailed life cycle inventory for flax cultivation in Northern France is documented. Field emissions associated with the nitrogen cycle are estimated both from a process-oriented DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) method and the generic Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) method. Since the IPCC method is derived from field measurements at sites with various soil types, climate conditions, and crops, it is subject to relatively large uncertainty. In contrast, the outputs from the DNDC method are believed to be more accurate because this method is constructed based on complex biochemical models from soil science and makes use of site specific data. The comparison of the results lead to the conclusion that the emission factors from the DNDC method and the recommended values from the IPCC method for flax cultivation in Northern France are quite different. The DNDC based emission factor for direct N 2 O emission, which is a strong greenhouse gas, is by a quarter to half lower than the recommended emission factor according to the IPCC method. The DNDC method leads to a reduction of 17 % in the impact category of climate change per kg retted flax straw production in comparison to the level obtained from the IPCC method. Different co-product accounting principles: mass allocation, economic allocation, and system expansion are investigated for the flax fibre extraction process. The impact results per kg <b>flax</b> <b>hackled</b> long fibre show that economic allocation and system expansion lead to similar values, while the mass allocation approach leads to significantly lower values among all impact categories. Furthermore, methods including the statistical fitting, qualitative judgement, and expert-judgement are integrated to parameterise the important inventory data to run a Monte-Carlo simulation for uncertainty analysis. In the case of the climate change impact category, the uncertainty levels through the mass allocation, economic allocation, and system expansion are compared for the results. It is found that the system expansion approach implies the highest level of uncertainty due to inclusion of additional external processes, while the mass allocation leads to the lowest uncertainty. The uncertainty level related to economic allocation is significantly higher than the mass allocation, which can be caused by fluctuating prices of flax (co-) products. With a reliable impact assessment on flax fibre production and with the economic allocation method is used, the study further extends to a comparison of flax fibres and glass fibres in composite applications. The Ashby method is used to ensure functionally equivalent designs. A so-called life cycle environmental impact indicator (LEI) has been introduced. Such LEI is derived from the material mass indices illustrated in the Ashy method. The material mass indices contain only material intrinsic properties and are proportional to the product mass while ensuring equal functionality (e. g. stiffness, strength, etc.) for a specified structure and loading type. Then the LEI can be constructed by using unit environmental impact values (e. g. climate change, fossil depletion, and etc.) in production, use, and EoL, and multiplying these with the mass indices. The LEI highlights three important variables severely influencing the outcome of comparative studies based on this indicator method: the replacement ratio, the specific fuel saving (in case of transport applications), and the fibre volume fraction. The first parameter addresses the concern that flax FRPs are likely to fail earlier than conventional FRPs. Therefore, more flax FRP components are needed for the expected lifespan. The specific fuel saving denotes how much fuel can be saved by a certain weight reduction over a total transport distance. Since flax fibres have a much lower density than conventional glass fibres, flax FRPs can facilitate structures with reduced weight. Therefore flax FPRs are likely to contribute to lower fuel consumption rates. The third parameter, the flax volume fraction, influences the mechanical properties of flax FRPs. Constructed on the polypropylene (PP) matrix, two types of flax FRP products: the flax mat-PP (panel) and short flax fibre-PP (strut), produced via compression moulding and injection moulding, respectively, have been evaluated for multiple impact categories using the ReCiPe method for fixed values of the fibre volume fraction and specific fuel reduction. Compared to a 9 kg glass mat-PP with 20 vol% fibre content, with the equal stiffness criterion under bending, the flax mat-PP with 20 vol% leads to a reduced mass design (7. 8 kg). In contrast, with an equal stiffness criterion under tension, the short flax fibre-PP is similarily heavy (9. 2 kg) as the corresponding GFRP (9 kg). The LCA study compared the environmental impact of flax FRPs and GFRPs within Europe in non-transport use (production plus EoL phases) and transport use. Over the production and EoL phases, the flax mat-PP exhibits lower values for most environmental impact categories than its corresponding glass fibre based counterpart. For most categories, the reductions can reach 20 %~ 50 %. In particular, a 23 % reduction in the climate change category and a 24 % reduction in fossil depletion are documented. Moreover, for the impact categories of ozone depletion and human toxicity reductions of up to 70 % can be achieved. On the other hand, replacing the short glass fibre-PP by short flax fibre-PP only results in modest environmental impact reductions in multiple impact categories, including the impact categories of climate change and fossil depletion where only reductions of around 10 % are recorded. Coming to the full life cycle impact, the saved fuel consumption during the use phase could be very significant depending on the lifetime distance travelled. In 14 out of 17 impact categories, lower life cycle impact results can be observed for the flax mat-PP. However, in case of the short flax fibre-PP compared to short glass fibre-PP, the two material systems lead to very similar environmental impact values in multiple categories due to their very similar mass. Subsequently, a consequential life cycle analysis (CLCA) is conducted to capture how overall environmental impact will change when shifting from glass fibres to flax fibres as reinforcements in composite fabrication. With certain assumptions, the marginal flax fibre supply is identified to be a combination of Chinese flax fibre (70 %) and French flax fibre (30 %). Due to inferior cultivars and coal-fired electricity in Chinese flax cultivation, the CLCA study reveals that flax mat-PP has 0. 8 ~ 2 times higher environmental impact values than the glass mat-PP in most environmental impact categories over the production and end-of-life (EoL) phases. For the purpose of providing potential trajectories of marginal flax fibre supply, additional all French fibre, and all Chinese fibre scenarios are also evaluated, formulating the lower and upper boundaries in terms of environmental impact change, respectively. The attributional fibre supply mix scenario is supplied as well. The all French fibre scenario leads to better scores than glass fibre composites in most impact categories; while the break-even mix lies at attributional supply mix scenario since it presents a close eco-profile to that of glass mat-PP. All of these scenarios are useful for policy analysis. Finally, the study quantifies the life cycle impact for wheat gluten based materials. The contribution serves as a base assessment which can feed into the evaluation of any future wheat-gluten based product. The study evaluates wheat gluten based packaging film and compares it with low density polyethylene LDPE and PLA film over the life cycle of these products. Scenarios including extrusion and casting for film production; incineration with energy recovery and composting for end-of-life treatments are evaluated. The comparison offers insight into the environmental benefits of using wheat gluten over conventional plastic film as well as its|$|R
