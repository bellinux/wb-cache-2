The IMF is stepping up in its <b>financial</b> <b>surveillance</b> through multilateral consultations to make it more effective and relevant. The World Bank president Paul Wolfowitz said that the poor should not be abandoned because their governments are weak, otherwise the people would be penalised twice. The IMF and World Bank see the need to combat corruption in developing countries.

Wolfowitz said that the issue of governance is being addressed, and the most important thing is to take the principles in the paper, applying it in terms of budget allocation. Matters may be complicated due to lack of political will. He added that working with developing countries is a starting point and must work with banks, global organisations and other governments to stop corruption in their nations.

50|$|As an {{economist}} at the OECD, Thorgeirsson was the co-author of several Economic Surveys for Finland and Norway, respectively, wherein he developed fiscal and monetary policy advice for these countries. In his capacity as chief economist for the Federation of Icelandic Industries in 2001-2004, Thorgeirsson was a participant in the debate in Iceland concerning membership in the European Union. During this time Thorgeirsson emphasised the advantages of the euro while warning about potential problems with the króna especially if monetary policy became restrictive. He advised the examination of other ways to adopt the euro if EU membership was a sticking point. He said the challenge for economic policy with a single European currency was overstated due to normal adjustment in a market economy. He warned against calls for a multi-currency system and advised of the benefits of the euro for financial stability. He presented an estimate of the potential benefit of EU membership for Iceland and suggested that small states benefited more from EU membership. In 2003, while calling for restraint in fiscal policy, bank lending and private sector decisions, Thorgeirsson warned of an exchange rate rise and subsequent collapse of the króna following the expected high interest rate policy path of the Central Bank during a FDI-led boom. At the same time, he suggested a moderate monetary policy path be considered (where domestic interest rates do not devitate too much from international rates). In May 2004, the central bank began to raise its policy interest rates from 5.3%, and by December 2007 it stood at 13.75%. Over this period, significant inflows of foreign capital took place, the exchange rate appreciated, bank lending surged and debt levels rose. The Icelandic króna and the oversized banking system collapsed in the Autumn of 2008 when global financial markets seized up. While serving as Director-General in the Ministry of Finance, Thorgeirsson suggested that the efficacy of fiscal policy was underrated in the upswing while that of monetary policy was overrated. More recently, while at the Central Bank,he has written about institutional reform in <b>financial</b> <b>surveillance,</b> with a focus on macroprudential policy. He has also performed research into the policy responses to the Icelandic banking collapse, finding that the government selected the optimal path to emerge from the crisis.|$|E

It proposes concrete and prioritized steps to further strengthen <b>financial</b> <b>surveillance</b> so that the Fund can fulfill its mandate to ensure the effective operation of the international monetary system and support global economic and financial stability. The strategy builds on and consolidates the progress achieved to date. It is ambitious, but focused, so as to ensure that scarce resources are used efficiently and effectively. A three-pronged strategy is proposed: (i) Strengthen the analytical underpinnings of macrofinancial risk assessments and policy advice. Systemic risk has become ever more complex, with shocks propagating rapidly through highly interconnected financial systems and across economies. The Fund needs to remain at the forefront of international efforts to better identify macrofinancial risks, such as credit booms and busts and balance sheet fragility, in order to inform its policy advice at th...|$|E

For instance, with a sliding window of 512 samples, SDT W is 400 times faster than DT W. 1...|$|R

40|$|AbstractHealthcare-Associated Infections (HAI) {{impose a}} {{substantial}} health and <b>financial</b> burden. <b>Surveillance</b> for HAI {{is essential to}} develop and evaluate prevention and control efforts. The traditional approaches to HAI surveillance are often limited in scope and efficiency {{by the need to}} manually obtain and integrate data from disparate paper charts and information systems. The considerable effort required for discovery and integration of relevant data from multiple sources limits the current effectiveness of HAI surveillance. Knowledge-based systems can address this problem of contextualizing data to support integration and reasoning. In order to facilitate knowledge-based decision making in this area, availability of a reference vocabulary is crucial. The existing terminologies in this domain still suffer from inconsistencies and confusion in different medical/clinical practices, and {{there is a need for}} their further improvement and clarification. To develop a common understanding of the infection control domain and to achieve data interoperability in the area of hospital-acquired infections, we present the HAI Ontology (HAIO) to improve knowledge processing in pervasive healthcare environments, as part of the HAIKU (Hospital Acquired Infections – Knowledge in Use) system.

To estimate the multifactor latent structure, we link the market risk (the covariance of the LCFIs'' equity) to credit risk (the default probability of the CDS basket) in a coherent manner. In addition, to analyze the response of the probabilities of default to changing macroeconomic conditions, we run a stress test by generating shocks to the latent multifactor structure. The results unveil a rich set of default probability dynamics and help in identifying the most relevant sources of risk. We anticipate that this approach could be of value to financial supervisors and risk managers alike.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new loss function and Usefulness measure for evaluating early warning systems (EWSs) that incorporate policymakers' preferences between issuing false alarms and missing crises, {{as well as}} individual observations. The novelty derives from three enhancements: i) accounting for unconditional probabilities of the classes, ii) computing the proportion of available Usefulness that the model captures, and iii) weighting observations by their importance for the policymaker. The proposed measures are model free such that they can be used to assess signals issued by any type of EWS, such as logit and probit analysis and the signaling approach, and flexible for any type of crisis EWSs, such as banking, debt and currency crises. Applications to two renowned EWSs, and comparisons to two commonly used evaluation measures, illustrate three key implications of the new measures: i) further highlights the importance of an objective criterion for choosing a final specification and threshold value, and for models to be useful ii) the need to be more concerned about the rare class and iii) the importance of correctly classifying observations of the most relevant entities.
