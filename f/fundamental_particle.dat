5|$|Fermi {{was fond}} of {{pointing}} out that Alessandro Volta, working in his laboratory, could have {{had no idea where}} the study of electricity would lead. Fermi is generally remembered for his work on nuclear power and nuclear weapons, especially the creation of the first nuclear reactor, and the development of the first atomic and hydrogen bombs. His scientific work has stood the test of time. This includes his theory of beta decay, his work with non-linear systems, his discovery of the effects of slow neutrons, his study of pion-nucleon collisions, and his Fermi–Dirac statistics. His speculation that a pion was not a <b>fundamental</b> <b>particle</b> pointed the way towards the study of quarks and leptons.|$|E

Hence in principle it need not be composed of {{a new type of}} <b>fundamental</b> <b>particle</b> but could, at least in part, be made up of standard baryonic matter, such as protons or electrons. However, for the reasons outlined below, most scientists consider the dark matter to be dominated by a non-baryonic component, which is likely composed of a currently unknown <b>fundamental</b> <b>particle</b> (or similar exotic state).|$|E

Furthermore, {{the members of the}} second and third generations quark composites consist of the first generation quark and the neutrino of <b>fundamental</b> <b>particles.</b> The particle and its anti-particle pair(or neutrino and its antineutrino pair) have to be an energy quantum (or a photon).

25|$|For a given {{energy in}} a given volume, there is an upper limit to the density of {{information}} (the Bekenstein bound) about the whereabouts of all the particles which compose matter in that volume, suggesting that matter itself cannot be subdivided infinitely many times and {{there must be an}} ultimate level of fundamental particles. As the degrees of freedom of a particle are the product of all the degrees of freedom of its sub-particles, were a particle to have infinite subdivisions into lower-level particles, the degrees of freedom of the original particle would be infinite, violating the maximal limit of entropy density. The holographic principle thus implies that the subdivisions must stop at some level, and that the <b>fundamental</b> <b>particle</b> is a bit (1 or 0) of information.|$|E

40|$|In {{continuation}} of our model of composite electron, its companion neutrinos, photon and electro-weak gauge bosons {{as well as}} their super-partners based on extended Lorentz group SU(3) ⊗ SU(3) in (8 + 1) dimensional space-time, we show that the remaining leptons, quarks, lepto-quarks and gluons {{as well as their}} respective super-partners can be considered as composites of <b>fundamental</b> <b>particles</b> belonging to the 5 ⊗ 5 dimensional representation of the further extended Lorentz group SU(5) ⊗ SU(5) in (24 + 1) dimensional space-time. The <b>fundamental</b> <b>particles</b> constituting the composite ones do not posses quantum numbers of the latter such as charge, hypercharge etc. Since according to our estimate based on experimental limit on the electron life-time, the mass of the <b>fundamental</b> <b>particles</b> is in the Planckian regime, the composite particles would break up into their constituents at these energies and lose their quantum numbers.
