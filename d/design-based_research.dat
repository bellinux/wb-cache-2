In 2000, Charles Desforges famously called design experiments 'neither designed, nor experiments'. <b>Design-based</b> <b>research</b> is viewed as an outgrowth of product development processes rather than scientific research. Critics see [...] "design science" [...] as an application of science to develop products or instructional interventions rather than scientific research. Some researchers question whether <b>design-based</b> <b>research</b> is primarily useful as an exploratory research method geared towards producing designed artifacts, or whether it can validly test robust theories that are contingent on designed artifacts or interventions.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This article {{develops}} {{an argument}} {{that the type of}} intervention research most useful for improving science teaching and learning and leading to scalable interventions includes both research to develop and gather evidence of the efficacy of innovations and a different kind of <b>research,</b> <b>design-based</b> implementation <b>research</b> (DBIR). DBIR in education focuses on what is required to bring interventions and knowledge about learning to all students, wherever they might engage in science learning. This research focuses on implementation, both in the development and initial testing of interventions and in the scaling up process. In contrast to traditional intervention research that focuses principally on one level of educational systems, DBIR designs and tests interventions that cross levels and settings of learning, with the aim of investigating and improving the effective implementation of interventions. The article concludes by outlining four areas of DBIR that may improve the likelihood that new standards for science education will achieve their intended purpose of establishing an effective, equitable, an...|$|R
30|$|The {{implications}} of this work illustrate the need for researchers to be responsive to {{the context of their}} school partners if they expect their work to be meaningful. Using the frame of <b>design-based</b> implementation <b>research</b> proved to be an effective strategy for working with the district STEM leadership team and teacher leaders to adapt the Problem-Solving Cycle and Mathematics Leadership Preparation models to support district implementation of a new curriculum that necessitates shifts in teacher practices and for determining how to make video-based discussions more productive activities in the models.|$|R
30|$|These {{demands on}} PD {{research}} overlap with methodological improvements in education <b>research.</b> For example, <b>design-based</b> implementation <b>research</b> “is an emerging form of design research {{that supports the}} productive adaption of programs as they go to scale” (Penuel & Fishman, 2012; p. 282). It aims to include both the design of interventions and the ongoing improvement of the implementation of these interventions. As the field is now challenged to devise strategies for taking effective video-based PD programs beyond pockets of success and excellence to a larger scale, the DBIR approach can offer guidance, as illustrated in the paper by Borko and colleagues.|$|R
50|$|<b>Design-based</b> <b>{{research}}</b> (DBR) {{is a type}} {{of research}} methodology commonly used by researchers in the learning sciences.

5000|$|Many {{learning}} science researchers employ <b>design-based</b> <b>research</b> methodology. The growing {{acceptance of}} <b>design-based</b> <b>research</b> methodology {{as a means}} for study is often viewed as a significant factor distinguishing learning science from many of the fields that contribute to it. By including <b>design-based</b> <b>research</b> within its methodological toolkit, learning science qualifies as a [...] "design science", with characteristics in common with other design sciences that employ design science such as engineering and computer science.

30|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the professional development}} design decisions of the university researchers as they collaborated with mathematics teachers and coaches to construct a reasonable and realistic vision of STEM integration using MEAs.

DBIR allowed the team to draw upon the research on specific enactments of MEAs as tools in mathematics and engineering education. Additionally, DBIR supported both the theorization and practical support that teachers and coaches would need to implement these tools (Penuel et al. 2011) to create more meaningful mathematics opportunities to learn in STEM integration contexts.|$|R

30|$|This {{research}} highlights a school-university collaboration {{to pilot}} a professional development framework for integrating STEM in K- 6 mathematics classrooms in a mid-Atlantic suburban school division. Because mathematics within STEM integration is often characterized as the calculations or the data representations in science classrooms, technology labs, or outside-of-school programs, developing a reasonable and realistic conceptualization of STEM integration for mathematics teachers and coaches {{may be especially}} challenging. Using <b>design-based</b> implementation <b>research,</b> university facilitators worked with eight mathematics teachers and coaches to construct an accessible vision of STEM integration built upon the design features of model-eliciting activities (MEAs). The research team strategized a flexible and fluid professional development that would (1) situate participants’ breadth of experiences on a STEM curriculum integration continuum; (2) elicit a new vision of STEM integration through open-ended mathematics problems with client-driven, real-life contexts; and (3) focus on making mathematics content explicit.|$|R

Although the models provide a structure for professional learning experiences, they are also intentionally designed to be flexible and adaptable to local contexts. With this in mind, we suggested a <b>design-based</b> implementation <b>research</b> project in which we would collaborate with UUSD to adapt the models to align with district needs and priorities. The UUSD STEM leaders thought that the project would fit well with their current work to develop and implement a CCSS-aligned middle school math curriculum for the district.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this article is on the {{analysis}} of reflection and peer learning in the pedagogical environment. The research draws on findings from an Australian study, which aimed to develop and critically evaluate a model of vocal pedagogy influenced by socio-cultural theories.

To capture the developmental nature of this pedagogical project, a <b>design-based</b> development <b>research</b> methodology was employed. Central to this approach was flexibility of the design, multiple dependent variables and capturing social interaction. The students were not the subject of experimentation, but were co-participants in the design and analysis. The results of the study suggest that there is value in peer learning for both classical and non-classical singers at an undergraduate level.

In this study, the ‘I’ narrative was extensively utilised {{in the form of an}} autoethnography perspective. This was achieved by incorporating three self-report methods within a design experiment, in order to explore the messiness associated with showcasing the creation and modification of a faculty-wide blended learning framework for STEM teachers. Data generation procedures from three sources provided the evidential basis for investigating this process: (1) self-reflection, (2) key literature findings, and (3) critical discussions from a community of inquiry. The findings identified three particular features of the process of change that were challenging, for which STEM academics required support: educators’ professional context; finding models to support change in practice; and identifying the change agent. The paper argues for the program of a personal and complex methodology to inform practice, providing insights into the change process, because process is just as important as product...|$|R

30|$|Use {{of mixed}} methods with video data {{collection}} and analysis can complement the design-based, iterative nature of research that includes human participants. <b>Design-based</b> video <b>research</b> allows for both qualitative and quantitative collection and analysis of data throughout the project, as various events are encapsulated for specific examination as well as analyzed comparatively for changes over time. Design research, in general, provides the structure for implementing work in practice and iterative refinement of design towards achieving research goals (Collins, Joseph, & Bielaczyc, 2004). Using an integrated mixed method design that cycles through qualitative and quantitative analyses as the project progresses gives researchers the opportunity to observe trends and patterns in qualitative data and quantitative frequencies as each round of analysis informs additional insights (Gliner et al., 2009). This integrated use also provides a structure for evaluating project fidelity in an ongoing basis through a range of data points and findings from analyses that are consistent across the project. The ability to revise procedures for data collection, systematic analysis, and presenting work does not change the data being collected, but gives researchers the opportunity to optimize procedural aspects throughout the process.|$|R

With proper technological and pedagogical support for collaborative dynamic mathematics, {{it is possible to}} create a CSCL approach to foster significant math discourse. The demo of the Virtual Math Teams (VMT) online environment will focus on the recent development of a multi-user version of GeoGebra within VMT. To support effective use of VMT, a coherent set of dynamic-geometry activities has been developed; this will be discussed as well as a professional-development course for in-service math teachers, preparing and supporting them for introducing collaborative dynamic mathematics in their schools. Tools built into the VMT software for detailed interaction analysis will be demoed and sample case studies referenced.

40|$|Marking and {{provision}} of formative feedback on student assessment items are essential but onerous and potentially error prone activities {{in teaching and}} learning. Marking and Feedback Support Systems (MFSS) aim to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of human (not automated) marking and {{provision of}} feedback, resulting in reduced marking time, improved accuracy of marks, improved student satisfaction with feedback, and improved student learning. This paper highlights issues in rigorous evaluation of MFSS, including potential confounding variables as well as ethical issues relating to fairness of actual student assessments during evaluation. To address these issues the paper proposes an evaluation research approach, which combines artificial evaluation {{in the form of}} a controlled field experiment with naturalistic evaluation {{in the form of a}} field study, with the evaluation to be conducted through the live application of the MFSS being evaluated on a variety of units, assessment items, and marking schemes. The controlled field experiment approach requires the assessment item for each student to be marked once each using each MFSS together with a manual (non-MFSS) marking control method. It also requires markers to use all the MFSS as well as the manual method. Through such a design, the results of the comparative evaluation will facilitate <b>design-based</b> education <b>research</b> to further develop MFSS with the overall goal of more efficient and effective assessment and feedback systems and practices to enhance teaching and learning...|$|R
