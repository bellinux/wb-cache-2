5|$|The {{costs of}} keeping the women imprisoned in the tolbooth at Pittenweem were {{becoming}} prohibitive; on 12 August, after payment of five hundred marks, all the women except Cornfoot were released on bail. In September Morton was summoned to give evidence to the Privy Council but he had fully regained his health and displayed no symptoms of being possessed. Adam was questioned by the Privy Council in October and freed. In November, Laing, Lawson, Horsefoot and Wallace were released after paying a fine of £8 each; but {{the last of the}} accused, Cornfoot, was kept in solitary confinement in the tolbooth by Cowper. One of the prison guards, who perhaps <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>her,</b> put her in a cell with a window low enough for her to escape so she also gained her freedom.|$|E
500|$|A {{few weeks}} before Libby was written out of the show, Watros and Michelle Rodriguez were arrested for driving under the {{influence}} in Kailua, Hawaii, in two separate incidents. This led fans to speculate that this was the cause of the two characters' deaths in the episode [...] "Two for the Road". The producers denied this claim, and Rodriguez confirmed the producers' comments and denied the relation between their arrests and their characters' deaths. Watros took the news of the death of her character badly and was sad about the decision. The producers <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> and tried to help her get a new job. She was cast in a pilot for a show on CBS called My Ex-Life, although it was not picked up by the network.|$|E
2500|$|Arkel tells Mélisande how he <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> {{when she}} {{first came to the}} castle [...] "with the strange, bewildered look of someone {{constantly}} awaiting a calamity." [...] But now that is going to change and Mélisande will [...] "open the door to a new era that I foresee." [...] He asks her to kiss him. [...] Golaud bursts in with blood on his forehead — he claims it was caused by a thorn hedge. When Mélisande tries to wipe the blood away, he angrily orders her not to touch him and demands his sword. He says that another peasant has died of starvation. Golaud notices Mélisande is trembling and tells her {{he is not going to}} kill her with the sword. He mocks the [...] "great innocence" [...] Arkel says he sees in Mélisande's eyes. He commands her to close them or [...] "I will shut them for a long time." [...] He tells Mélisande that she disgusts him and drags her around the room by her hair. When Golaud leaves, Arkel asks if he is drunk. Mélisande simply replies that he does not love her any more. Arkel comments: [...] "If I were God, I would have pity on the hearts of men." ...|$|E

50|$|Much to Elaine's indignation, Toby then {{receives}} a major promotion that Elaine had wanted because <b>her</b> boss <b>felt</b> so <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> {{because of the}} accident. Toby's {{first order of business}} is getting Kramer's coffee table book published.|$|R
2500|$|Most fellow {{tennis players}} reacted {{negatively}} to her announcement, {{with almost no}} support or sympathy in general for Sharapova. John McEnroe and Pat Cash said they {{found it hard to}} believe her. Jennifer Capriati posted on Twitter that she should be stripped of her 35 professional titles. Chris Evert expressed her surprise at the lack of support in tennis for Sharapova, noting that she [...] " [...] always isolated herself {{from the rest of the}} tennis world, from the players". Serena Williams expressed surprise at Sharapova’s announcement but commended her for being [...] "upfront with what she had done". Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray all publicly condemned Sharapova and argued that she deserved to be punished on the basis that she failed the doping test, with Murray adding that [...] "Taking a drug you don't necessarily need because it's legal is wrong" [...] and Federer stating that [...] "Whether it's intentional or not, I don't see too much difference. You must be 100 percent about what you are taking". Sharapova's case prompted Federer to urge the tennis federation to conduct more anti-doping tests. Novak Djokovic said that he <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>her,</b> but that she must still be ready for punishment. Victoria Azarenka and Dominika Cibulkova were far less supportive, with Cibulkova adding that she didn't feel sorry at all for Sharapova and didn't miss having her on the tour, describing her as [...] "a totally unlikeable person; arrogant, conceited, and cold". The Russian Tennis Federation strongly defended Sharapova, describing the positive drug test as [...] "nonsense" [...] and adding that they expected Sharapova to be available for the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.|$|E

60|$|The girl stood still, {{trembling}} {{with anger and}} confusion, and Kenwardine <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> She was worse hurt than he had expected, but she would rally.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Let us amuse ourselves,' I said, taking Matteo by the arm, and {{dragging}} him along {{in search of}} prey. We fixed on a seller of cheap jewellery--a huge woman, with a treble chin and a red face dripping with perspiration. We <b>felt</b> quite <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>her,</b> and went to console her.|$|R
60|$|The fust thing 'e {{did when}} 'e got his money on Friday was to send off a post-office order to Shap Street, and Mrs. Burtenshaw cried with rage and 'ad {{to put it}} down to the {{headache}}. She 'ad the headache every Friday for a month, and Bill, wot was feeling stronger and better than he 'ad done <b>for</b> years, <b>felt</b> quite <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
6000|$|She {{declined}} to sit down, and evidently wished {{to appear to}} have come but for a few seconds. She looked confusedly at the place in which she found herself, and when her eyes met his own they struck him as anxious and appealing. She was evidently not thinking of his song, though she said {{three or four times}} over that it was beautiful. [...] "Well, I only wanted you to know, and now I must go," [...] she added; but on his hearthrug she lingered with such an odd helplessness that he <b>felt</b> almost <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|Melissa {{pinned on}} her hair again {{and put on}} her hat and drank the milk, all without a word; but she was purple. I <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... 'Oh! what a poor {{helpless}} old creature!' said another, who <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> 'That {{poor old}} woman {{can do no}} harm to anyone. She may sit there and welcome.' ...|$|E
60|$|MISS GILPIN (gravely). She's {{been going}} down hill steadily--(meaningly)--ever since you left. She's {{in a very}} serious state, let me impress you with that. We've all loved <b>her,</b> and <b>felt</b> so <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> and admired her spirit so--that's the only reason she's been allowed to stay here so long after her time. We've kept hoping she'd start to pick up--in another day--in another week. But now that's all over. Doctor Stanton has given up hope of her {{improving}} here, and her father is unwilling to pay <b>for</b> <b>her</b> elsewhere now he knows there's a cheaper place--the State Farm. So she's to be sent there {{in a day or}} so.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the time}} that Ovidie became an pornographic actor, she {{described}} herself as a [...] "very active militant feminist". She first viewed pornography {{to get a sense}} of the injustice that was being perpetrated on female industry workers. She found herself surprised when female porn stars, who she once <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for,</b> impressed <b>her</b> with their powerful sexual images. Wanting to attain this same kind of sexual strength, which seemed compatible with feminist ideals, she began acting in pornographic films. She told The Times Magazine [...] "I am interested in these sort of experiences not just because I am perverse, which as you have seen I can be when I want to be. No, it's because not everyone can achieve them." ...|$|R
60|$|The Doctor almost pitied her. Poor Catherine was not defiant; {{she had no}} {{genius for}} bravado; and as she felt that her father viewed her companion's attentions with an unsympathising eye, {{there was nothing but}} {{discomfort}} <b>for</b> <b>her</b> in the accident of seeming to challenge him. The Doctor <b>felt,</b> indeed, so <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> that he turned away, to spare her the sense of being watched; and he was so intelligent a man that, in his thoughts, he rendered a sort of poetic justice to her situation.|$|R
6000|$|... "I haven't a notion. She {{walked into}} Brown's hotel {{yesterday}} looking played out and anxious, and said somebody {{had told her}} I {{was going to the}} Bluff. As I <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> I started at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{nine years}} since I've seen it, but I can't get those lines {{out of my}} head. Perhaps it's because of the girl who sang them. Somehow, I <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> She had remarkably fine eyes." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{thanked her}} most heartily. I felt {{this was the}} real tender sympathy of a being of my own age and like myself, and there were {{something}} so pathetic in her expression that I <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
6000|$|George {{steadily}} {{declined from}} this time. I {{went to see}} him two years later. He was not at home. Meg wept to me as she told me of him, how he let the business slip, how he drank, what a brute he was in drink, and how unbearable afterwards. He was ruining his constitution, he was ruining her life and the children's. I <b>felt</b> very <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> as she sat, large and ruddy, brimming over with bitter tears. She asked me if I did not think I might influence him. He was, she said, at the [...] "Ram." [...] When he had an extra bad bout on he went up there, and stayed sometimes for a week at a time, with Oswald, coming back to the [...] "Hollies" [...] when he had recovered—"though," [...] said Meg, [...] "he's sick every morning and almost after every meal." ...|$|R
30|$|My little niece {{came home}} and was very excited to tell auntie how easy the test she had just done was. When I asked her to tell {{me some of the}} {{questions}} asked, she had this to say, ‘one of the questions they asked us was: Jesus was crucified on a ____?’ I asked her what she wrote as the answer and she brought out the question paper and showed me that she had chosen the answer option ‘B’ which had ‘table’ as answer, but in the mother tongue said that the answer was mutharaba which means ‘cross’. I <b>felt</b> so <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> because I knew she was going to fail that question, not because she did not know the answer, but because the language of the test was an enormous barrier. I later learned that the teacher had actually read out the questions to them but she did not read the choices.|$|R
60|$|There {{was a set}} of six {{cups and}} saucers from Peter something, who had loved Betsy in vain. She had shown the Dominie and Tommy the ear-rings given her long ago by Peter (they were bought with 'Sosh checks) and the poem he had written about them, and she was most anxious to gratify him in her reply. All Cathro could do, however, was to wish Peter well in some ornate sentences, while Tommy's was a letter that only a tender woman's heart could have indited, with such {{beautiful}} touches about the days which are no more alas forever, that Betsy listened to it with heaving breast and <b>felt</b> so <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> old swain that, forgetting she had never loved him, she all but gave Andrew the go-by and returned to Peter. As for Peter, who had been getting over his trouble, he saw {{now for the first}} time what he had lost, and he carried Betsy's dear letter in his oxter pocket and was inconsolable.|$|R
6000|$|He {{stopped and}} laughed. [...] "It's nine years since I've seen it, but I can't get those lines {{out of my}} head. Perhaps it's because of the girl who sang them. Somehow, I <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> She had remarkably fine eyes." ...|$|E
60|$|Millicent {{managed to}} convey {{a great deal more}} than she said, and her sigh {{suggested}} that she often suffered keenly from loneliness; but while Geoffrey <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>her,</b> he was occupied by another thought just then, and did not at first answer.|$|E
60|$|Her voice trembled a little, {{though her}} eyes were hard, and Prescott <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> She was not of {{emotional}} nature; he could imagine her shrinking from any display of tenderness. Nevertheless, {{it was obvious that}} she was a prey to fear and grief.|$|E
6000|$|He unconsciously {{included}} Cynthia in his {{scheme of}} inquiry; {{he had been}} used so long to trust to her instincts and opinions, and to rely upon her help, {{and he realized that}} she was no longer in his life with something like the shock a man experiences when the loss of a limb, which continues a part of his inveterate consciousness, is brought to his sense by some mechanical attempt to use it. But even in this pang he did not regret that all was over between them. He knew now that he had never cared <b>for</b> <b>her</b> as he had once thought, and on her account, if not his own, he was glad their engagement was broken. A soft melancholy for his own disappointment imparted itself to his thoughts of Cynthia. He <b>felt</b> truly <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>her,</b> and he truly admired and respected her. He was in a very lenient mood toward every one, and he went so far in thought toward forgiving his enemies that he was willing at least to pardon all those whom he had injured. A little rustling in the underbrush across the clearing caught his quick ear, and he looked up to see Jombateeste parting the boughs of the young pines on its edge and advancing into the open with a gun on his shoulder. He called to him, cheerily: [...] "Hello, John! Any luck?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What {{can they}} see in it?' thought Swithin; 'it's not a tune.' He took up his hat. Rozsi saw him and stopped; her lips had parted with a faintly dismayed expression. His sense of {{personal}} injury diminished; he even <b>felt</b> a little <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> She jumped up from her seat and twirled round with a pout. An inspiration seized on Swithin. [...] "Come and dine with me," [...] he said to Boleskey, [...] "to-morrow--the Goldene Alp--bring your friend." [...] He felt {{the eyes of the}} whole room on him--the Hungarian's fine eyes; Margit's wide glance; the narrow, hot gaze of Kasteliz; and lastly--Rozsi's. A glow of satisfaction ran down his spine. When he emerged into the street he thought gloomily, 'Now I've done it!' And not for some paces did he look round; then, with a forced smile, turned and removed his hat to the faces at the window.|$|R
6000|$|... "Col. Zane, I do {{not feel}} that I owe your sister anything, and what I am going to tell you is simply because you have always been my friend, and I do not want you to have any wrong ideas about me. I'll tell you the truth and you can be the judge {{as to whether or not}} I insulted your sister. I fell in love with her, almost at first sight. The night after the Indians recaptured your brother, Betty and I stood out in the {{moonlight}} and she looked so bewitching and I <b>felt</b> so <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> and so carried away by my love <b>for</b> <b>her</b> that I yielded to a momentary impulse and kissed her. I simply could not help it. There is no excuse for me. She struck me across the face and ran into the house. I had intended that night to tell her of my love and place my fate in her hands, but, of course, the unfortunate occurrence made that impossible. As I was to leave at dawn next day, I remained up all night, thinking what I ought to do. Finally I decided to write. I wrote her a letter, telling her all and begging her to become my wife. I gave the letter to your slave, Sam, and told him it was a matter of life and death, and not to lose the letter nor fail to give it to Betty. I have had no answer to that letter. Today she coldly ignored me. That is my story, Col. Zane." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{disappeared}} {{and the girl}} sat down, looking very forlorn and disconsolate. Her voice was English and she had obviously traveled a long distance in an open car on the supply train. Kermode <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> He {{took off his hat}} as he approached.|$|E
60|$|Vane {{thanked her}} with a glance; he <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> and Drayton. They were {{strongly}} attached to each other, and he had reason for believing that even with the advanced salary the man expected to get they would find it needful to study strict economy.|$|E
