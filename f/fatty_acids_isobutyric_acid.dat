40|$|A {{total of}} sixty surgically {{castrated}} male pigs (Large White × Landrace) weighing 31 • 2 (sd 4 • 3) kg {{were used in}} a randomised block experiment to {{examine the effect of}} added dietary inulin (0, 20, 40 and 80 g/kg) on the occurrence of swine dysentery (SD) and on fermentation characteristics in the large intestine after experimental challenge with the causative spirochaete Brachyspira hyodysenteriae. The pigs were allowed to adapt to the diets for 2 weeks before each pig was challenged orally four times with a broth culture containing B. hyodysenteriae on consecutive days. Increasing dietary levels of inulin linearly (P = 0 • 001) reduced the risk of pigs developing SD; however, eight out of fifteen pigs fed the diet with 80 g/kg inulin still developed the disease. The pH values in the caecum (P = 0 • 072) tended to decrease, and in the upper colon, the pH values did decrease (P = 0 • 047) linearly with increasing inulin levels in the diets, most probably due to a linear increase in the concentration of total volatile fatty acids in the caecum (P = 0 • 018), upper colon (P = 0 • 001) and lower colon (P = 0 • 013). In addition, there was a linear reduction in the proportion of the branched-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> <b>isobutyric</b> <b>acid</b> and isovaleric acid in the caecum (P = 0 • 015 and 0 • 026) and upper colon (P = 0 • 011 and 0 • 013) with increasing levels of dietary inulin. In conclusion, the present study showed that a diet supplemented {{with a high level of}} inulin (80 g/kg) but not lower levels reduced the risk of pigs developing SD, possibly acting through a modification of the microbial fermentation patterns in the large intestine...|$|E

Physicochemical parameters of wastewater samples were measured using standard methods. Bacterial diversity was determined using 16 S rRNA gene amplicon pyrosequencing of the variable region V 1 - 3. Results showed soluble COD concentrations from settled sewage for Unit- 3 at 192. 8 mg COD/L and for Unit- 5 at 214. 6 mg COD/L, which increased to 301. 8 mg COD/L and 411. 6 mg COD/L in the overflow from elutriation tanks and decreased to 170. 9 mg COD/L and 256. 3 mg COD/L at the division boxes, respectively. Both long-chain volatile <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (heptanoic <b>acid,</b> <b>isobutyric</b> <b>acid,</b> 3 -methylbutanoic acid, pentanoic acid, 4 -methylpentanoic acid, methylheptanoic acid) and short-chain volatile <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (acetic <b>acid,</b> propionic <b>acid,</b> <b>isobutyric</b> <b>acid)</b> were present within concentration ranges of 17. 19 mg/L to 54. 98 mg/L and 13. 64 mg/L to 87. 6 mg/L for Unit 3 and 38. 61 mg/L to 58. 85 mg/L and 21. 63 mg/L to 92. 39 mg/L for Unit 5, respectively. In the secondary settling tanks, the phosphate-removal efficiency in Unit- 5 appeared to be slightly higher (0. 08 mg P/L) compared to that of Unit- 3 (0. 11 mg P/L). The average DO concentrations (2. 1 mg/L and 2. 2 mg/L) as well as the pH values (pH 7 to pH 7. 5) were found to be slightly higher in Unit- 5 in the aerobic zones. The high presence of PAOs in the bioreactors (Unit- 5 : Dechloromonas (14. 96 %), Acinetobacter (6. 3 %), Zoogloea (4. 72 %) in the anaerobic zone and Dechloromonas (22. 37  %) in the aerobic zone; Unit- 3 : Dechloromonas (37. 25 %) in the anaerobic zone and Dechloromonas (23. 97 %) in the aerobic zone) confirmed the phosphate-removal efficiencies of both units. Negligible GAOs were found in the aerobic zones (Defluviicoccus spp. : 0. 33 % for Unit- 5 and 0. 68 % for Unit- 3) and in the anaerobic zones (Defluviicoccus: 9. 8 % for Unit- 3). The high microbial diversity and a negligible percentage of GAOs in Unit- 5 could contribute to its high phosphate-removal efficiency, although results did not indicate statistically significant differences between the unit with a covered elutriation tank (Unit- 5) and that with open elutriation tanks (Unit- 3) ...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the fermented diet including grape and apple pomace on amino digestibility, nitrogen balance and volatile <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> in finishing pigs. A total of 24 finishing pigs ((Yorkshire x Landrace) x Duroc) with an average BW of 63. 42 ± 9. 78 kg were used in this experiment. Pigs were allotted to 6 experiment diets according to initial BW. Dietary treatments were: CON (dry compound diet), (fermented liquid compound diet), GF 10 (fermented liquid compound diet with 10 % grape pomace), GF 20 (fermented liquid compound diet with 20 % grape pomace), AF 10 (fermented liquid compound diet with 10 % apple pomace) and AF 20 (fermented liquid compound diet with 20 % apple pomace). The DM, CP and CF digestibility was highest (p< 0. 05) in CON and F treatments among treatments. The DM, EE, ash and Ca digestibility was highest (p< 0. 05) in AF 10 treatment among treatments. All the detected Essential amino acid and non-essential amino acids digestibility were highest (p< 0. 05) in F treatment among treatments. All the detected essential amino acid and non-essential amino acids digestibility were lowest (p< 0. 05) in AF 20 treatment except leucine and and proline digestibility were lowest (p< 0. 05) in GF 20 treatment among treatments. The total essential amino acids, total non-essential amino acids and total amino acid digestibility was highest (p< 0. 05) in CON and F treatments and lowest in AF 20 treatment among treatments. The dietary Lactobacillus concentration was increased (p< 0. 05) as the order of treatments listed in table and the Enterobacteriaceae concentration was decreased (p< 0. 05) in reverse order. The fecal acetic <b>acid,</b> <b>isobutyric</b> <b>acid</b> and isovaleric acid emission were higher (p< 0. 05) in CON treatment than other treatments. The slurry acetic <b>acid,</b> butyric <b>acid,</b> <b>isobutyric</b> <b>acid</b> and isovaleric acid emission was higher (p< 0. 05) in AF 10 treatment than other treatments. The feed intake and feces excretion were highest (p< 0. 05) in AF 20 treatments among treatments. The feces (DM) excretion was highest in GF 20 treatment and lowest (p< 0. 05) in F treatment among treatments. The Fecal nitrogen, urinary nitrogen, nitrogen retention, fecal nitrogen excretion ratio, urinary nitrogen excretion ratio and nitrogen retention ratio were highest in AF 20 treatment, F treatment, AF 10 treatment, AF 20 treatment, CON treatment and AF 10 treatment, respectively. In conclusion, the supplementation of grape and apple pomace in finishing pig diets limited the approximate chemical composition and amino acid digestibility. The supplementation of grape and apple pomace in finishing pig diets could benefit the beneficial bacterial and decreased VFA emission in feces.

40|$|Short-chain {{carboxylic}} acids {{generated by}} various mixed- or pure-culture fermentation processes {{have been considered}} valuable precursors for production of bioalcohols. While conversion of carboxylic acids into alcohols is routinely performed via catalytic hydrogenation or with strong chemical reducing agents, biological conversion routes are being explored. Reduction of nbutyric acid by pure cultures using glucose {{as the source of}} energy and electrons have been studied. However, the high cost of sugars has lead to the searching for cheaper sources. Syngas produced via biomass gasification, which is a blend of carbon monoxide, hydrogen and carbon dioxide, was studied as an economical source of energy and electrons with pure cultures of Clostridium ljungdahlii as a biocatalyst for the carboxylic acids reduction. Acetic acid, propionic <b>acid,</b> n-butyric <b>acid,</b> <b>isobutyric</b> <b>acid,</b> n-valeric acid, and n-caproic acid were successfully converted into their corresponding alcohols.

40|$|It {{is found}} {{that use of}} acetone in place of acetic acid in the {{reaction}} with <b>isobutyric</b> <b>acid</b> is effective for the synthesis of the cross-ketonization product, methyl isopropyl ketone (MIPK). Rate of MIPK formation is of the same order of magnitude, but slightly lower for acetone compared to acetic acid under similar conditions (Fig. 1). The most active catalyst is KOH-treated titania. The second product of this reaction, DIPK, results from the ketonic decarboxylative condensation of <b>isobutyric</b> <b>acid</b> with itself. The 13 C labeled carbonyl group from <b>isobutyric</b> <b>acid</b> is almost exclusively (within the detection error) transferred to the MIPK product (Scheme 2). In the reaction of acetic acid with a more branched ketone, DIPK, only a negligible amount of MIPK is produced with all studied catalysts.

Moreover, GPR 43 expression was found to increase during the adipogenesis of cultured brown adipocytes. Pro-adipogenic reagent PPARγ agonist stimulation led to a further augment of GPR 43 expression while antiadipogenic reagents such as PPARγ antagonist, RXR antagonist and STAT 5 inhibitor played the opposite role on GPR 43 expression. Transcription factors such as XBP 1 and STAT 5 were identified to be involved in GPR 43 expression regulation in brown adipocytes. Furthermore, we also examined the role of acetate in the regulation of brown adipogenesis. Our results showed that acetate treatment during adipogenesis up-regulated AP 2, PGC- 1 α and UCP 1 expression and affected the morphological changes of brown adipocytes. Moreover, an increase in mitochondrial biogenesis was observed after acetate treatment. Acetate also elicited the activation of ERK and CREB, and these responses were sensitive to G(i/o) -type G-protein inactivator, Gβγ-subunit inhibitor, PLC inhibitor and MEK inhibitor, indicating a role for the G(i/o) βγ/PLC/PKC/MEK signalling pathway in these responses. These effects of acetate were mimicked by treatment with 4 -CMTB, a synthetic GPR 43 agonist, and were impaired in GPR 43 knock-down cells, further supported the hypothesis that GPR 43 mediates the pro-adipogenic effects of acetate in brown adipocytes. Furthermore, the effects of acetate treatment on brown adipose tissue were also measured in vivo. Mice fed with acetate demonstrated increased PGC- 1 α in brown adipose tissue, which was in agreement with the results obtained from immortalized brown adipocytes. In addition, we also measured the effects of acetate on lipid metabolism in differentiated brown adipocytes. The results showed effects of acetate treatment on lipolysis were different in white adipocytes and brown adipocytes. Acetate treatment significantly decreased the lipolysis in white adipocytes while had little effects on lipolysis in brown adipocytes. Besides, acetate treatment was also found to decrease TF 2 -C 12 <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> uptake in differentiated IM-BAT cells, suggesting acetate may affect many aspects of lipid metabolism in brown adipocytes. Collectively, our results indicated that acetate might have important physiological roles in brown adipocytes.

40|$|The aim of {{the current}} study was to assess lipid {{metabolism}} in horses with atypical myopathy. Urine samples from 10 cases were subjected to analysis of organic acids, glycine conjugates, and acylcarnitines revealing increased mean excretion of lactic acid, ethylmalonic acid, 2 -methylsuccinic acid, butyrylglycine, (iso) valerylglycine, hexanoylglycine, free carnitine, C 2 -, C 3 -, C 4 -, C 5 -, C 6 -, C 8 -, C 8 : 1 -, C 10 : 1 -, and C 10 : 2 -carnitine as compared with 15 control horses (12 healthy and three with acute myopathy due to other causes). Analysis of plasma revealed similar results for these predominantly short-chain acylcarnitines. Furthermore, measurement of dehydrogenase activities in lateral vastus muscle from one horse with atypical myopathy indeed showed deficiencies of short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (0. 66 as compared with 2. 27 and 2. 48 in two controls), medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (0. 36 as compared with 4. 31 and 4. 82 in two controls) and isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase (0. 74 as compared with 1. 43 and 1. 61 nmol min(- 1) mg(- 1) in two controls).

40|$|There is {{a growing}} concern with air and odor {{emissions}} from agricultural facilities. A supplementary research project was conducted to complement the U. S. National Air Emissions Monitoring Study (NAEMS). The overall goal of the project was to establish odor and chemical emission factors for animal feeding operations. The study was conducted over a 17 -month period at two freestall dairies, one swine sow farm, and one swine finisher facility. Samples from a representative exhaust airstream at each barn were collected in 10 L Tedlar bags and analyzed by trained human panelists using dynamic triangular forced-choice olfactometry. Samples were simultaneously analyzed for 20 odorous compounds (acetic acid, propanoic <b>acid,</b> butyric <b>acid,</b> <b>isobutyric</b> <b>acid,</b> valeric acid, isovaleric acid, hexanoic acid, heptanoic acid, guaiacol, phenol, 4 -methylphenol, 4 -ethylphenol, 2 -aminoacetophenone, indole, skatole, dimethyl disulfide, diethyl disulfide, dimethyl trisulfide, hydrogen sulfide, and ammonia). In this article, which is part 6 of a six-part series summarizing results of the project, we investigate the correlations between odor concentrations and odor activity value (OAV), defined as the concentration of a single compound divided by the odor threshold for that compound. The specific objectives were to determine which compounds contributed most to the overall odor emanating from swine and dairy buildings, and develop equations for predicting odor concentration based on compound OAVs. Single-compound odor thresholds (SCOT) were statistically summarized and analyzed, and OAVs were calculated for all compounds. Odor concentrations were regressed against OAV values using multivariate regression techniques. Both swine sites had four common compounds with the highest OAVs (ranked high to low: hydrogen sulfide, 4 -methylphenol, butyric acid, isovaleric acid). The dairy sites had these same four compounds in common in the top five, and in addition diethyl disulfide was ranked second at one dairy site, while ammonia was ranked third at the other dairy site. Summed OAVs were not a good predictor of odor concentration (R 2 = 0. 16 to 0. 52), underestimating actual odor concentrations by 2 to 3 times. Based on the OAV and regression analyses, we conclude that hydrogen sulfide, 4 -methylphenol, isovaleric acid, ammonia, and diethyl disulfide are the most likely contributors to swine odor, while hydrogen sulfide, 4 -methyl phenol, butyric acid, and isovaleric acid are the most likely contributors to dairy odors...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to reduce the predictor dimensionality {{and to develop a}} model able to forecast Clostridium tyrobutyricum contamination in corn silages. A survey on 33 dairy farms was performed, and samples from core, lateral, and apical parts of the feed-out face of corn silage bunkers were analyzed for chemical, biological (digestible and indigestible NDF), fermentative (pH, ammonia nitrogen, lactic acid, VFA, and ethanol), and microbiological (yeasts and molds) traits. Corn silage samples were analyzed for C. tyrobutyricum cell and spore counts by adoption of a molecular DNA–based method. A partial least squares (PLS) regression with a leaveone- out cross-validation method was used to reduce the dimensionality of the original predictors (n = 30) by projecting the independent variables into latent constructs. In a first step of the model development, the importance of independent variables in predicting C. tyrobutyricum contamination was assessed by plotting factor loadings of both dependent and independent variables on the first 2 components and by verifying for each predictor the variable influence on projection values adopting the Wold’s criterion as well as the entity of standardized regression coefficients. Three ensiling characteristics (bunker type, presence of lateral wrap plastic film, and penetration resistance as a measurement of the ensiled mass density), a chemical trait (DM), 9 characterizations of the fermentative profile (pH, ammonia nitrogen, acetic <b>acid,</b> butyric <b>acid,</b> <b>isobutyric</b> <b>acid,</b> valeric acid, isovaleric acid, ethanol, and lactic acid), and 2 microbiological traits (yeasts and molds) were retained as important terms in the PLS model. Three reduced-variable PLS (rPLS) regressions—the first based on ensiling, chemical, fermentative, and microbiological retained important variables (rPLSecfm); the second based on chemical, fermentative, and microbiological retained important traits (rPLScfm); and the last based on only chemical and fermentative retained important variables (rPLScf) —were performed. The model that best fit the C. tyrobutyricum measurements was rPLSecfm. The rPLScfm and rPLScf models had similar regression performances but higher mean square errors of prediction than rPLSecfm. However, all tested models seemed adequate to rank corn silages for low, medium, and high risks of C. tyrobutyricum contamination. To avoid the visit on farm by trained people required to measure penetration resistance, the use of the rPLScf model is suggested as a useful tool to assess the risk of C. tyrobutyricum in corn silage...|$|R

Gas {{chromatography}} analyses of host odour extracts coupled to electrophysiological recordings from basiconic sensillum receptors indicate that nonanal is a constituent of sheep wool and chicken feather odour that stimulates {{one of the}} receptors {{in this type of}} sensillum. Similar analyses revealed <b>isobutyric</b> <b>acid</b> in rabbit odour to be a chemostimulant for one of the receptors in grooved-peg sensilla. The response of the aldehyde receptor was higher to heptanal, octanal and nonanal than to other aliphatic aldehydes, and the response of the acid receptor was higher to <b>isobutyric</b> <b>acid</b> than to other short-chain branched and unbranched acids. The behavioural responses of fifth-instar T. infestans nymphs to nonanal and <b>isobutyric</b> <b>acid</b> in an air-stream on a servosphere indicate that, whereas nonanal causes activation of the bugs, <b>isobutyric</b> <b>acid</b> induces an increase in upwind displacement, i. e. odour-conditioned anemotaxis.
