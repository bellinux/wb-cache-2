40|$|Applications {{ranging from}} {{nonlinear}} terahertz spectroscopy to remote sensing require broadband and intense THz radiation {{which can be}} generated by focusing two-color laser pulses into a gas. In this setup, THz radiation originates from the buildup of the electron density in sharp steps of attosecond duration due to tunnel ionization, and subsequent acceleration of free electrons in the laser field. We show that the spectral shape of the THz pulses generated by this mechanism is determined by superposition of contributions from individual <b>ionization</b> <b>events.</b> This provides a straightforward analogy with linear diffraction theory, where the <b>ionization</b> <b>events</b> {{play the role of}} slits in a grating. This analogy offers simple explanations for recent experimental observations and opens new avenues for THz pulse shaping based on temporal control of the <b>ionization</b> <b>events.</b> We illustrate this novel technique by tailoring the spectral width and position of the resulting radiation using multi-color pump pulses.

40|$|In this paper, {{calculations}} {{of the hole}} initiated interband impact ionization rate in bulk silicon and GaAs are presented based on an ensemble Monte Carlo simulation with {{the inclusion of a}} wave-vector-dependent numerical transition rate formulation. The ionization transition rate is determined {{for each of the three}} valence bands, heavy, light, and split-off, using Fermi's golden rule with a two-body, screened Coulomb interaction. The dielectric function used within the calculation is assumed to be wave-vector-dependent. Calculations of the field-dependent impact ionization rate as well as the quantum yield are presented. It is found from both the quantum yield results and examination of the hole distribution function that the effective threshold energy for hole initiated impact ionization is relatively soft, similar to that predicted for the corresponding electron initiated <b>ionization</b> <b>events</b> occur more frequently than either heavy or split-offf initiated <b>ionization</b> <b>events</b> in bulk silicon over the applied electric field strengths examined here, 250 - 500 kV/cm.

40|$|We gratefully {{acknowledge}} the {{support from the}} European Community under the FP 7 by the ERC starting grant 257431 Brown dwarfs (BDs) form mineral clouds in their atmospheres, where charged particles can produce large-scale discharges {{in the form of}} lightning resulting in substantial sudden increase of local ionization. BDs are observed to emit cyclotron radio emission. We show that signatures of strong transient atmospheric <b>ionization</b> <b>events</b> (flash <b>ionization)</b> can be imprinted on a pre-existing radiation. Detection of such flash <b>ionization</b> <b>events</b> will open investigations into the ionization state and atmospheric dynamics. Such events can also result from explosion shock waves, material outbursts or (volcanic) eruptions. We present an analytical model that describes the modulation of a pre-existing electromagnetic radiation by a time-dependent (flash) conductivity that is characteristic for flash <b>ionization</b> <b>events</b> like lightning. Our conductivity model reproduces the conductivity function derived from observations of terrestrial gamma-ray flashes, and is applicable to astrophysical objects with strong temporal variations in the local ionization, as in planetary atmospheres and protoplanetary discs. We show that the field responds with a characteristic flash-shaped pulse to a conductivity flash of intermediate intensity. More powerful <b>ionization</b> <b>events</b> result in smaller variations of the initial radiation, or in its damping. We show that the characteristic damping of the response field for high-power initial radiation carries information about the ionization flash magnitude and duration. The duration of the pulse amplification or the damping is consistently shorter for larger conductivity variations and can be used to evaluate the intensity of the flash ionization. Our work suggests that cyclotron emission could be probe signals for electrification processes inside BD atmosphere. Publisher PDFPeer reviewe...|$|R
5000|$|A plasma {{begins with}} a rare natural '{{background}}' <b>ionization</b> <b>event</b> of a neutral air molecule, perhaps {{as the result of}} photoexcitation or background radiation. If this event occurs within an area that has a high potential gradient, the positively charged ion will be strongly attracted toward, or repelled away from, an electrode depending on its polarity, whereas the electron will be accelerated in the opposite direction. Because of the huge mass difference, electrons are accelerated to a much higher velocity than ions.|$|E
5000|$|The {{ionizing}} {{effect of}} radiation on a gas is extensively {{used for the}} detection of radiation such as alpha, beta, gamma and X-rays. The original <b>ionization</b> <b>event</b> in these instruments results in the formation of an [...] "ion pair"; a positive ion and a free electron, by ion impact by the radiation on the gas molecules. The ionization chamber is the simplest of these detectors, and collects all the charges created by direct ionization within the gas through the application of an electric field.|$|E
50|$|The same {{approach}} that produces an <b>ionization</b> <b>event</b> {{can be used}} to access the dense manifold of near-threshold Rydberg states with laser experiments. These experiments often involve a laser operating at one wavelength to access the intermediate Rydberg state and a second wavelength laser to access the near-threshold Rydberg state region. Because of the photoabsorption selection rules, these Rydberg electrons are expected to be in highly elliptical angular momentum states. It is the Rydberg electrons excited to nearly circular angular momentum states that are expected to have the longest lifetimes. The conversion between a highly elliptical and a nearly circular near-threshold Rydberg state might happen in several ways, including encountering small stray electric fields.|$|E

50|$|The {{proportionality}} {{between the}} energy of the charged particle travelling through the chamber and the total charge created makes proportional counters useful for charged particle spectroscopy. By measuring the total charge (time integral of the electric current) between the electrodes, we can determine the particle's kinetic energy because the number of ion pairs created by the incident ionizing charged particle is proportional to its energy. The energy resolution of a proportional counter, however, is limited because both the initial <b>ionization</b> <b>event</b> and the subsequent 'multiplication' event are subject to statistical fluctuations characterised by a standard deviation equal to the square root of the average number formed. However, in practice these are not as great as would be predicted due to the effect of the empirical Fano factor which reduces these fluctuations. In the case of argon, this is experimentally about 0.2.|$|E
50|$|The Townsend {{discharge}} is a {{good example}} of the creation of positive ions and free electrons due to ion impact. It is a cascade reaction involving electrons in a region with a sufficiently high electric field in a gaseous medium that can be ionized, such as air. Following an original <b>ionization</b> <b>event,</b> due to such as ionizing radiation, the positive ion drifts towards the cathode, while the free electron drifts towards the anode of the device. If the electric field is strong enough, the free electron gains sufficient energy to liberate a further electron when it next collides with another molecule. The two free electrons then travel towards the anode and gain sufficient energy from the electric field to cause impact ionization when the next collisions occur; and so on. This is effectively a chain reaction of electron generation, and is dependent on the free electrons gaining sufficient energy between collisions to sustain the avalanche.|$|E
50|$|Photoelectron photoion {{coincidence}} spectroscopy (PEPICO) is {{a combination}} of photoionization mass spectrometry and photoelectron spectroscopy. Free molecules from a gas-phase sample are ionized by incident vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) radiation. In the ensuing photoionization, a cation and a photoelectron are formed for each sample molecule. The mass of the photoion is determined by time-of-flight mass spectrometry, whereas, in current setups, photoelectrons are typically detected by velocity map imaging. Electron times-of-flight are three orders of magnitude smaller than ion ones, which means that the electron detection {{can be used as a}} time stamp for the <b>ionization</b> <b>event,</b> starting the clock for the ion time-of-flight analysis. In contrast with pulsed experiments, such as REMPI, in which the light pulse must act as the time stamp, this allows to use continuous light sources, e.g. a discharge lamp or a synchrotron light source. No more than several ion-electron pairs are present simultaneously in the instrument, and the electron-ion pairs belonging to a single photoionization event can be identified and detected in delayed coincidence.|$|E
50|$|The {{scintillator}} must be {{shielded from}} all ambient light so that external photons do not swamp the <b>ionization</b> <b>events</b> caused by incident radiation.

50|$|A time {{projection}} chamber {{consists of}} a gas-filled detection volume in an electric field with a position-sensitive electron collection system. The original design (and the one most commonly used) is a cylindrical chamber with multi-wire proportional chambers (MWPC) as endplates. Along its length, the chamber is divided into halves {{by means of a}} central high-voltage electrode disc, which establishes an electric field between the center and the end plates. Furthermore, a magnetic field is often applied {{along the length of the}} cylinder, parallel to the electric field, in order to minimize the diffusion of the electrons coming from the ionization of the gas. On passing through the detector gas, a particle will produce primary ionization along its track. The z coordinate (along the cylinder axis) is determined by measuring the drift time from the <b>ionization</b> <b>event</b> to the MWPC at the end. This is done using the usual technique of a drift chamber. The MWPC at the end is arranged with the anode wires in the azimuthal direction, &theta;, which provides information on the radial coordinate, r.

At low temperature most electrons initiating <b>ionization</b> <b>events</b> occupy L valleys due to the increased ionization threshold.
