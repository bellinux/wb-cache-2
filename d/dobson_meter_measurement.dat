40|$|AbstractDistributed {{generation}} and low carbon loads are already leading to some restrictions {{in the operation}} of distribution networks and higher penetrations of e. g. PV generation, heat pumps and electric vehicles will exacerbate such problems. In order to manage the distribution network effectively in this new situation, increased real-time monitoring and control will become necessary. In the future, distribution network operators will have smart <b>meter</b> <b>measurements</b> available to them to facilitate safe and cost-effective operation of distribution networks. This paper investigates the application of smart <b>meter</b> <b>measurements</b> to extend the observability of distribution networks. An integrated load and state estimation algorithm was developed and tested using residential smart <b>metering</b> <b>measurements</b> and an 11 kV residential distribution network. Simulation results show that smart <b>meter</b> <b>measurements,</b> both real-time and pseudo measurements derived from them, can be used together with state estimation to extend the observability of a distribution network. The integrated load and state estimation algorithm was shown to produce accurate voltage magnitudes and angles at each busbar of the network. As a result, the algorithm can be used to enhance distribution network monitoring and control...|$|R

40|$|Accurate state {{estimation}} is {{of paramount importance}} to maintain the power system operating in a secure and efficient state. The recently identified coordinated data injection attacks to <b>meter</b> <b>measurements</b> can bypass the current security system and introduce errors to the state estimates. The conventional wisdom to mitigate such attacks is by securing <b>meter</b> <b>measurements</b> to evade malicious injections. In this paper, we provide a novel alternative to defend against false-data injection attacks using covert power network topological information. By keeping the exact reactance of a set of transmission lines from attackers, no false data injection attack can be launched to compromise any set of state variables. We first investigate from the attackers' perspective the necessary condition to perform injection attack. Based on the arguments, we characterize the optimal protection problem, which protects the state variables with minimum cost, as a well-studied Steiner tree problem in a graph. Besides, we also propose a mixed defending strategy that jointly considers the use of covert topological information and secure <b>meter</b> <b>measurements</b> when either method alone is costly or unable to achieve the protection objective. A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation is introduced to obtain the optimal mixed defending strategy. To tackle the NP-hardness of the problem, a tree pruning-based heuristic is further presented to produce an approximate solution in polynomial time. The advantageous performance of the proposed defending mechanisms is verified in IEEE standard power system testcases.

40|$|AbstractThe {{accurate}} {{estimation of}} system state variables at buses in the power-grid {{is crucial for}} determining the operational state of the power system. Spoofing attacks on meters at buses can bypass bad data detectors in Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems and undetectably manipulate state estimates. Existing methods for protection of the state estimate of critical buses against spoofing attacks assume {{the existence of a}} given set of set of critical buses/meters to be protected. Given budget constraints, determining the critical set of meters/buses to be protected against spoofing attacks is a crucial problem. In this paper, we address the issue of how best to determine the set of meters to be protected. We suggest the use of two sparse temporal modeling methods from the machine learning literature to evaluate the influence of each <b>meter</b> <b>measurement</b> on the power grid network. Based on the influence distribution as indexed by these methods we can populate a set of <b>meter</b> <b>measurements</b> which serves a dual purpose. First, this set can serve as the initial collection of nodes that is a required input for methods developed to defend against false injection attacks on power system state estimation. Second, the high influential power of meters in the set incentivizes their protection since they are pivotal for making real-time prediction in the absence of complete real-time data from other meters. Thus, we introduce influence as one of the primary criteria to be considered in the process of selecting nodes to protect. We also suggest a novel way to measure influence based on sparse structure learning. We provide results on a publicly available simulated dataset and discuss how to use the notion of the N 50 statistic to calibrate the number of <b>meter</b> <b>measurements</b> that should be protected under a specified budget...|$|R
40|$|The Soil Plant Analysis Development (SPAD) {{chlorophyll}} meter {{is one of}} {{the most}} commonly used diagnostic tools to measure crop nitrogen status. However, the measurement method of the meter could significantly affect the accuracy of the final estimation. Thus, this research was undertaken to develop a new methodology to optimize SPAD <b>meter</b> <b>measurements</b> in rice (Oryza sativa L.). A flatbed color scanner was used to map the dynamic chlorophyll distribution and irregular leaf shapes. Calculus algorithm was adopted to estimate the potential positions for SPAD <b>meter</b> <b>measurement</b> along the leaf blade. Data generated by the flatbed color scanner and SPAD meter were analysed simultaneously. The results suggested that a position 2 / 3 of the distance from the leaf base to the apex (2 / 3 position) could represent the chlorophyll content of the entire leaf blade, as indicated by the relatively low variance of measurements at that positon. SPAD values based on di-positional leaves and the extracted chlorophyll a and b contents were compared. This comparison showed that the 2 / 3 position on the lower leaves tended to be more sensitive to changes in chlorophyll content. Finally, the 2 / 3 position and average SPAD values of the fourth fully expanded leaf from the top were compared with leaf nitrogen concentration. The results showed the 2 / 3 position on that leaf was most suitable for predicting the nitrogen status of rice. Based on these results, we recommend making SPAD measurements at the 2 / 3 position on the fourth fully expanded leaf from the top. The coupling of dynamic chlorophyll distribution and irregular leaf shapes information can provide a promising approach for the calibration of SPAD <b>meter</b> <b>measurement,</b> which can further benefit the in situ nitrogen management by providing reliable estimation of crops nitrogen nutrition status...|$|R
