Vessey believes that William's claim to have been commissioned by Amalric is a typical ancient and medieval topos, or literary theme, in which a wise ruler, a lover of history and literature, wishes to preserve for posterity the grand deeds of his reign. William's claims of impartiality are also a typical topos in ancient and medieval historical writing.|$|E

However, Liddell did later state {{that he was not}} certain whether this was true. He also asserted that Gardner later joined another of the Pickingill covens, based in Hertfordshire, through which he received [...] "the Second Rite of the Hereditary Craft". Liddell stressed that this group was separate from Gardner's own Bricket Wood coven. He furthermore claimed that Gardner received the [...] "Third Rite" [...] from an East Anglian coven, with this three-degree system of initiation influencing that in Gardnerian Wicca. As a result, he stated that the structure and rituals of Gardnerian Wicca were based on those devised by Pickingill, and that [...] "no <b>impartial</b> <b>observer</b> could fail to see that they formed the nucleus of the rites of Wicca."

Recording sessions were sometimes contentious, as DeLonge strove for heavier and dirtier guitar-driven rock.

Refraining from paying for a studio drummer, he invited Barker to record drums on the project and Hoppus felt betrayed.

Barker also explored hip-hop influences and teamed up with Rancid's Tim Armstrong to form the rap rock band Transplants.|$|E
500|$|The {{recording}} and release of Neighborhoods was delayed multiple times. The recording's delay {{was due to}} the way the band chose to work — in bits and pieces, alone and together, in a pair of California studios — in addition to each member's busy schedules. The album was recorded at both DeLonge's studio in San Diego and in Los Angeles by Hoppus and Barker. [...] Recording in separate studios was DeLonge's idea, and ideas were exchanged via e-mail. Various engineers met up in person to trade files on hard drives. Although the three musicians were rarely in the same room while recording, opting to work on their parts individually, DeLonge asserted that the method of recording was a more efficient way of working considering the schedules, not {{due to a lack of}} unity within the band. In addition, Barker was releasing a solo record, DeLonge was involved in Angels & Airwaves, and Hoppus had to fly to New York City once a week to film his television show, Hoppus on Music. The record was the band's first to be self-produced, due to the death of long-time producer Jerry Finn in 2008. Not only did Finn helm their last three studio albums, but he served as an invaluable member of the band: part adviser, part <b>impartial</b> <b>observer,</b> he helped smooth out tensions and hone their sound. [...] "I honestly still feel like he’s in the studio with us, because for me, personally, everything that was about {{recording and}} being in a studio, I learned from Jerry," [...] said Hoppus. Instead of a producer, each band member had their own dedicated sound engineer. DeLonge, who was against using a producer after self-producing most of his Angels & Airwaves records, described the band situation as [...] "very democratic," [...] noting that he learned during the recording process to [...] "let go and be okay with not being able to control everything." ...|$|E

In this paper, we explore the trade-off between reputation and fees and find that relative to monopoly, rating agencies are more prone to inflate ratings under competition, resulting in lower expected welfare. Our results suggest that more competition by itself is undesirable under the current issuer-pay model and will do little to resolve the conflict of interest problem. ...|$|R
