500|$|The latest {{generation}} Planar 3, released in 2016, is a wholesale improvement on the classic. Rega reports that only 2 part assemblies remain unchanged from the prior RP3 model, the dustcover and dustcover hinges. Significant revisions to plinth, platter, tonearm show net improvements in fit and finish, {{as well as}} performance. The new plinth is an MDF core with a high-pressure acrylic laminate finish, and thicker braces, for improved strength and aesthetics, lowering noise floor and improving response. The main bearing well has been completely redesigned to reduce pressure on the ball bearing and hub, while allowing for a higher tolerance assembly, netting smoother operation and lower noise. A new hub (subplatter) is constructed of polycarbonate, reshaped to improve contact with the platter and lower overall resonance of the main bearing/hub/platter assembly. The 12mm platter is a new glass material, dubbed Optiwhite, is noticeably clearer in appearance and {{is said to be}} machined to higher tolerance which improves rotational stability. The old RB303 tonearm {{has been replaced by a}} new RB330 version of the classic, with patent pending [...] "zero-tolerance" [...] bearings, stiffer vertical bearing housing, redesigned bias (anti-skate) housing, improved three-point plinth mounting, a new arm tube coating, and new arm wiring. The 24V AC synchronous motor has a new control PCB and <b>housing</b> <b>cover</b> for greater consistency during assembly and improved reliability, and the power switch has been relocated under the plinth for better ergonomics. New feet are said to lower noise transfer into the turntable, via a new stiffer, wider, hollow cone design constructed from Santoprene rubber. As always, the Planar 3 is still produced in Rega's UK manufacturing plant located in Southend-on-Sea, Essex UK. Remarkably, the 2016 Planar 3 only rose in price nominally from its predecessor, revealing the benefits of Rega's increased manufacturing capacity and popularity.|$|E

5000|$|The final chapters, on the Gautreaux {{public housing}} {{desegregation}} {{case and the}} rebirth of public <b>housing,</b> <b>cover</b> the messy attempts to remedy Chicago public housing. The lawyer who filed the Gautreaux lawsuit in the 1960s and battled it out for more than 30 years, Alexander Polikoff, is portrayed as a crusader who faced opposition from both the white establishment (especially Mayor Richard J. Daley) and black community activists. Polikoff has fought for Chicago to open all of its neighborhoods to subsidized African-American families, a fight that has drawn many opponents over the years. The final chapter offers a fairly balanced perspective on the effort to rebuild Chicago public housing in the 1990s through a [...] "Plan for Transformation." [...] Hunt views the transformation effort as important in acknowledging the failure of high-rise public housing, but the book recognizes that the plan's implementation may not be kind to {{the poorest of the}} poor.|$|E

40|$|Heavy {{machinery}} strips {{the land}} of trees and topsoil and compacts the ground. Roads, parking lots, commercial buildings, and residential <b>housing</b> <b>cover</b> the landscape with impervious surfaces. Precipitation runs off the landscape. Erosive gullies form. Trash and chemical pollutants wash into storm drains. Streams are impaired, and only the most tolerant species persist. In the present housing boom, this scene is becoming typical across the United States. Many communities are considering options to address stormwater runoff problems in already-developed areas, such as those pictured in Figure 1. However, such retrofit stormwater management is riddled with legal constraints (e. g., private property rights), economic challenges (e. g., stormwater fees not tightly linked to runoff), and social concerns (e. g., basement flooding). Although a multidisciplinary approach that directly incorporates the various legal, social, economic, and hydrologic aspects of stormwater management is therefore more appropriate, such an approach is more complicated and thus rarely undertaken. Stormwater runoff from new or existing development can be addressed using either centralized management systems, such as larg...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the latest}} in a series of LDRD's that we have been {{conducting}} with Florida State University/Florida A&M University (FSU/FAMU) under the campus executive program. This research builds on the earlier projects; ''Development of Highly Integrated Magnetically and Electrostatically Actuated Micropumps'' (SAND 2003 - 4674) and ''Development of Magnetically and Electrostatically Driven Surface Micromachined Pumps'' (SAND 2002 - 0704 P). In this year's LDRD we designed 2 nd generation of surface micromachined (SMM) gear and viscous pumps. Two SUMMiT{trademark} modules full of design variations of these pumps were fabricated and one SwIFT{trademark} module is still in fabrication. The SwIFT{trademark} fabrication process results in a transparent pump <b>housing</b> <b>cover</b> that will enable visualization inside the pumps. Since the SwIFT{trademark} pumps have not been tested as they are still in fabrication, this report will focus on the 2 nd generation SUMMiT{trademark} designs. Pump testing (pressure vs. flow) was conducted on several of the SUMMiT{trademark} designs resulting in the first pump curve for this class of SMM pumps. A pump curve was generated for the higher torque 2 nd generation gear pump designed by Jason Hendrix of FSU. The pump maximum flow rate at zero head was 6. 5 nl/s for a 30 V, 30 Hz square wave signal. This level of flow rate would be more than adequate for our typical SMM SUMMiT{trademark} or SwIFT{trademark} channels which have typical volumes on the order of 50 pl...|$|E
