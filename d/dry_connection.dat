30|$|<b>Dry</b> beam-column <b>connections</b> are {{achieved}} by connecting the precast elements with post-tensioning, welding or embedded rods. Chang et al. (2013) presented experimental results of two full-scale interior beam-column connections with embedded ductile rods within the joint region. Main test parameters were {{the use of}} high strength concrete, post-tensioning and high performance reinforcing steel. They were concluded that specimens sustained large drifts without any strength degradation. Experimental studies on post-tensioned connections showed that increase in mild reinforcement ratio results in improved ductility and energy dissipation capacities. However, in some cases premature buckling and rupture of mild reinforcement may occur before reaching the drift ratios that the connection can sustain (Cheok et al. 1993; Priestley et al. 1999; ACI T 1.2 2003; Ertas et al. 2006). It is proposed that, unbonding of reinforcing bars over a length of precast beam and column elements in a sleeve can reduce the strain demands and prevent rupture which leads significant degradation in strength (Cheok et al. 1996; Pampanin et al. 2001; Belleri et al. 2012). However, unbonded length should be selected properly to ensure yielding of reinforcing bars without premature rupture (Cheok et al. 1993).|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} {{of the ideal}} head varies dramatically from breed to breed based on a mixture of the role the horse is bred for and what breeders, owners and enthusiasts find appealing. Breed standards frequently cite large eyes, a broad forehead and a <b>dry</b> head-to-neck <b>connection</b> as important to correctness about the head. Traditionally, the length of head as measured from poll to upper lip should be two-thirds {{the length of the}} neck topline (measured from poll to withers). Presumably, the construction of the horse's head influences its breathing, though there are few studies to support this. Historically, a width of 4 fingers or 7.2 cm was associated with an unrestricted airflow and greater endurance. However, a study in 2000 which compared the intermandibular width-to-size ratio of Thoroughbreds with their racing success showed this to be untrue. The relationship between head conformation and performance are not well understood, and an appealing head may be more a matter of marketability than performance.Among mammals, morphology of the head often plays a role in temperature regulation. Many ungulates have a specialized network of blood vessels called the carotid rete, which keeps the brain cool while the body temperature rises during exercise. Horses lack a carotid rete and instead use their sinuses to cool blood around the brain. These factors suggest that the conformation of a horse's head influences its ability to regulate temperature.|$|R

40|$|Water {{circulation}} {{patterns in}} a tropical mangrove-fringed bay with seagrass and coral reef {{are driven by}} tides that generate strong reversing tidal currents. The wind, which has an onshore component, generates a net clockwise-rotating eddy. The dominant tidally driven water circulation pattern, coupled {{with the effects of}} onshore wind and alongshore current generated by wave breaking, promotes the coastal trapping of turbid brackish water and its inherent nutrient content. This brackish water inundates the mangrove swamp and seagrass beds but not the coral reef ecosystem. Weak stratification prevails during the wet season in the upper parts of Kidogoweni Creek as a result of freshwater influx from rivers.

40|$|Experimental {{studies have}} shown that precast {{concrete}} hybrid frames with <b>dry</b> jointed moment <b>connections</b> can provide adequate lateral force resistance for buildings located in high seismic zones. This framing concept, which has been approved for use by code officials, utilizes unbonded post-tensioning and mild steel reinforcement that is debonded over a short distance to establish a moment resisting connection between a precast beam and a precast column. As a result, the hybrid frames have the ability to dissipate energy and sustain minimal residual displacements when subjected to earthquake lateral forces. Due to the use of unbonded steel reinforcement, the hybrid connection concept introduces strain incompatibility between the reinforcement and the surrounding concrete, making the analysis and design of the connection difficult. Consequently, the available analysis and design methods for hybrid frame connections are based on many simplified assumptions. The analytical investigation presented in this report examines the monolithic beam analogy concept and establishes an improved set of expressions for estimating concrete and steel strains at the connection. The accuracy of the improved set of equations is verified using experimental data through section (or connection) and system level analyses. The improved analysis procedure is then demonstrated for a member level analysis and seismic analysis of a five-story precast hybrid building under different earthquake input motions. Using the analytical response of the five-story building, the following are examined: the benefits of using flexible floor links in hybrid frames, the ability of hybrid frames to satisfy limit states when subjected to different earthquake intensities, and suitable response modification (R-) factors for the force based design of hybrid frames...|$|R

Due to their complex characteristics, modeling waterflow through wetlands using more realistic process formulations (integrated surface-ground water and vegetative resistance) is an actual necessity. ^ This dissertation focused on developing an integrated surface – subsurface hydrologic simulation numerical model by programming and testing the coupling of the USGS MODFLOW- 2005 Groundwater Flow Process (GWF) package (USGS, 2005) with the 2 D surface water routing model: FLO- 2 D (O’Brien et al., 1993). The coupling included the necessary procedures to numerically integrate and verify both models as a single computational software system that will heretofore be referred to as WHIMFLO- 2 D (Wetlands Hydrology Integrated Model). An improved physical formulation of flow resistance through vegetation in shallow waters based on the concept of drag force was also implemented for the simulations of floodplains, while the use of the classical methods (e. g., Manning, Chezy, Darcy-Weisbach) to calculate flow resistance has been maintained for the canals and deeper waters. ^ A preliminary demonstration exercise WHIMFLO- 2 D in an existing field site was developed for the Loxahatchee Impoundment Landscape Assessment (LILA), an 80 acre area, located at the Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee National Wild Life Refuge in Boynton Beach, Florida. After applying a number of simplifying assumptions, results have illustrated the ability of the model to simulate the hydrology of a wetland.

Comparison of measured and simulated groundwater head levels showed an average error of 0. 18 % with a maximum of 2. 9 %. ^ The coupling of FLO- 2 D model with MODFLOW- 2005 model and the incorporation of the dynamic effect of flow resistance due to vegetation performed in the new modeling tool WHIMFLO- 2 D is an important contribution to the field of numerical modeling of hydrologic flow in wetlands. ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2004 Steel {{wire rope}} is the {{accepted}} standard in logging. It is strong, durable, stiff, and dependable in the logger's arsenal. However, {{steel wire rope}} has several disadvantages: its strength to weight ratio is low; it is difficult and time-consuming to splice; and used wire ropes contain jaggers. Ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMW-PE) braided rope has potential to replace steel wire rope. The offshore mooring and shipping industries have appreciated it for years. Characteristics such as a specific gravity less than one (it floats!), high flexibility, low stretch, and ease of splicing make the synthetic rope useful. At equivalent diameters, synthetic rope has an equal or greater breaking strength to that of steel wire rope, but at 1 / 7 the weight. This thesis is {{an investigation of the}} end connectors for the unique physical, mechanical, and thermal properties of UHMW-PE 12 -strand braided rope that make this technology of interest in logging applications. This studied focused on three diameter classes of the synthetic rope that are common to logging operations: 3 / 8 ", 9 / 16 ", and 5 / 8 ". Within each diameter class there were five different spools representing separate production runs. A randomized complete block design was used with each diameter class and the corresponding five spools a separate population. Following the laboratory tests, the breaking strengths were compared to the buried eye splice. Three types of end connectors were evaluated during this pilot study. They are identified as spliced, adhesives, and dry hardware. Spliced end connections provided consistent performance in breaking strengths. The end connections with adhesives had variable strength performance laboratory tests and are therefore not recommended. Within the <b>dry</b> hardware end <b>connections,</b> the pinned nubbin and knuckle link provided the highest breaking strength relative to the buried eye splice. This project has accomplished its objectives. It was the first extensive study on end connections specifically designed for synthetic rope. New end connections were developed and steel wire rope connections were modified to meet the strength and usability criteria for timber harvesting operations. Suitable end connections for forest operations were: buried eye splice, Whoopie Sling, long splice, rope clamps, knuckle link, pinned nubbin, and Y-splice. These end connections suitable for use with forest operations were identified and recommended user guidelines were given. Further research and development needs to be conducted on these seven concepts with larger sample sizes and in varied conditions...|$|R
40|$|Within {{the scope}} of a {{longitudinal}} study, eight different dairy cow herds were observed {{over the course of}} twelve months. The relevant dairy farms were visited every four weeks. Selected test specimens were lame cows (3 rd degree and above), non-lactating (dry) cows (up to four weeks a. p.) and recently calved cows (up to four weeks p. p.). Ruminal fluid, urine, and blood samples were taken from all test specimens and milk data from the most recent milk control examination was collected. The samples were predominantly examined for acidity status and the related parameters in order to establish an acute or chronic latent ruminal acidosis as the cause for the claw problems. In addition, further metabolic parameters, electrolytes, minerals and vitamin B 12 were taken into account. Furthermore, claw trimming and the use of buffer additions to the feed, the number of past lactation periods of each test specimen,the number of days ante or post partum at the time of sampling and the loss data of lame animals {{during the course of the}} twelve month-long study were recorded for each herd. The lameness incidence was 36. 5 %. In terms of ascertained diagnoses, the sole ulcer dominated with 46. 9 %, followed by the foot abscess (26. 5 %) and laminitis (12. 2 %). The influencing variable "claw trimming" was notable because cows which received treatment once annually had an only somewhat lower incidence than those which did not receive regular claw trimming. No correlation could be made in the eight examined dairy farms between the potential influencing variable "buffer additions" and lameness occurring later during lactation. The lameness incidence correlated significantly with increased age of the dairy cows. More than 40 % of the lame cows left the herd within the first twelve months following the determined lameness; more than 20 % left within the first six months. With regard to the ruminal fluid pH level, no further statistical distinction was made in the dry cows or in the recently calved cows or in the cows which became lame later. Nor could such a statistical distinction be made with regard to cows which developed a sole ulcer. Upon analysis of the urine parameter of the <b>dry</b> cows in <b>connection</b> with a later occurring lameness, no significances resulted. The milk parameters remained statistically insignificant. With regard to the chemical parameters of the blood, significant increases appeared in the ß-hydroxybutyric acid values for the recently calved cows that developed a lameness later during lactation, as well as for cows that specifically developed a sole ulcer (p= 0. 007 p= 0. 000). The factors which obviously play an important roll for the farms examined and could possibly be optimized are routine professional claw trimming and an improved adaptation of the energy needs of each dairy cow to the peripartal phase. In addition, the housing conditions with regard to cow comfort should be reconsidered, in particular for the offspring of the herd...|$|R
40|$|Timber has {{experienced}} renewed interests as a sustainable building material in recent times. Although traditionally {{it has been}} the prime choice for residential construction in New Zealand and some other parts of the world, its use can be increased significantly in the future through a wider range of applications, particularly when adopting engineered wood material, Research has been started on the development of innovative solutions for multi-storey non-residential timber buildings in recent years and this study is part of that initiative. Application of timber in commercial and office spaces posed some challenges with requirements of large column-free spaces. The current construction practice with timber is not properly suited for structures with the aforementioned required characteristics and new type of structures has to be developed for this type of applications. Any new structural system has to have adequate capacity for carry the gravity and lateral loads due to occupancy and the environmental effects. Along with wind loading, one of the major sources of lateral loads is earthquakes. New Zealand, being located in a seismically active region, has significant risk of earthquake hazard specially in the central region of the country and any structure has be designed for the seismic loading appropriate for the locality. There have been some significant developments in precast concrete in terms of solutions for earthquake resistant structures in the last decade. The “Hybrid” concept combining post-tensioning and energy dissipating elements with structural members has been introduced in the late 1990 s by the precast concrete industry to achieve moment-resistant <b>connections</b> based on <b>dry</b> jointed ductile <b>connections.</b> Recent research at the University of Canterbury has shown that the concept can be adopted for timber for similar applications. Hybrid timber frames using post-tensioned beams and dissipaters have the potential to allow longer spans and smaller cross sections than other forms of solid timber frames. Buildings with post-tensioned frames and walls can have larger column-free spaces which is a particular advantage for non-residential applications. While other researchers are focusing on whole structural systems, this research concentrated on the analysis and design of individual members and connections between members or between member and foundation. This thesis extends existing knowledge on the seismic behaviour and response of post-tensioned single walls, columns under uni-direction loads and small scale beam-column joint connections into the response and design of post-tensioned coupled walls, columns under bi-directional loading and full-scale beam-column joints, as well as to generate further insight into practical applications of the design concept for subassemblies. Extensive experimental investigation of walls, column and beam-column joints provided valuable confirmation of the satisfactory performance of these systems. In general, they all exhibited almost complete re-centering capacity and significant energy dissipation, without resulting into structural damage. The different configurations tested also demonstrated the flexibility in design and possibilities for applications in practical structures. Based on the experimental results, numerical models were developed and refined from previous literature in precast concrete jointed ductile connections to predict the behaviour of post-tensioned timber subassemblies. The calibrated models also suggest the values of relevant parameters for applications in further analysis and design. Section analyses involving those parameters are performed to develop procedures to calculate moment capacities of the subassemblies. The typical features and geometric configurations the different types of subassemblies are similar with the only major difference in the connection interfaces. With adoption of appropriate values representing the corresponding connection interface and incorporation of the details of geometry and configurations, moment capacities of all the subassemblies can be calculated with the same scheme. That is found to be true for both post-tensioned-only and hybrid specimens and also applied for both uni-directional and bi-directional loading. The common section analysis and moment capacity calculation procedure is applied in the general design approach for subassemblies...|$|R
