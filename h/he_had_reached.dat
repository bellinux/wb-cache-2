5|$|Braille {{had always}} been a sickly child, and his {{condition}} worsened in adulthood. A persistent respiratory illness, long believed to be tuberculosis, dogged him, and by the age of forty, he was forced to relinquish his position as a teacher. Despite the lack of a cure at the time, Braille lived with the illness for 16 years. When his condition reached mortal danger, he was admitted to the infirmary at the Royal Institution, where he died in 1852, two days after <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>reached</b> the age of forty-three.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of his action, O'Leary was a nine-year veteran of the British armed forces {{and by the time he}} retired from the British Army in 1921, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>reached</b> the rank of lieutenant. He served in the army again during the Second World War, {{although}} his later service was blighted by periods of ill-health. At his final retirement from the military in 1945, O'Leary was an Army major in command of a prisoner of war camp. Between the wars, O'Leary spent many years employed as a police officer in Canada and is sometimes considered to be a Canadian recipient of the Victoria Cross. Following the Second World War he worked as a building contractor in London, where he died in 1961.|$|E

5|$|By 7June 1823, Etty {{felt that}} <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>reached</b> {{the limits of}} what he could {{accomplish}} in Venice, and was considering returning home. Soon afterwards he left Venice for Florence, {{with the intention of}} creating a full-size replica of Titian's Venus of Urbino, considered one of the finest works of the Venetian school of painting. Although the Uffizi management were hostile to this proposal, after 10 days of negotiations they allowed Etty to create his copy. His contemporaries considered it among the finest copies ever made of a painting generally considered to be impossible to copy. In late July Etty began the journey home, pausing for a further two months in Venice. On 8October 1823 Etty finally left Venice, travelling via Mantua and Geneva to Paris.|$|E
5|$|During the January 2010 tournament, {{a tabloid}} {{magazine}} claimed Asashōryū punched his personal manager after getting drunk during {{a night out}} in downtown Nishiazabu. After the tournament Asashōryū was reprimanded by Japan Sumo Association (JSA) head Musashigawa, and he apologised once again for his behaviour. However, it subsequently emerged {{that it was not}} his manager but a restaurant employee who was attacked, reportedly sustaining a broken nose. The man did not file a report with the police, and on 31 January 2010, Asashōryū told the authorities that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>reached</b> a settlement with him. Despite this, the police did not rule out the possibility of questioning Asashōryū about the assault.|$|E

As Aurobindo disappeared from view, the warrant was held back and the prosecution postponed. Aurobindo manoeuvred the police into open action and a warrant was issued on 4 April 1910, but the warrant could not be executed because on that date <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>reached</b> Pondicherry, then a French colony. The warrant against Aurobindo was withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|Koniecpolski's {{life was}} one of almost {{constant}} warfare. Before <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>reached</b> the age of 20, he had fought in the Dymitriads and the Moldavian Magnate Wars. Later, in 1620, he {{took part in the}} Battle of Cecora, during which he was captured by Ottoman forces. After his release in 1623, he defeated the Ottomans' Tatar vassals several times between 1624 and 1626. With inferior numbers, during the Polish–Swedish War (1626–29), Koniecpolski stopped the Swedish forces of Gustavus Adolphus from conquering Prussia and Pomerania before the war was concluded with the Truce of Altmark. In 1634, he defeated a major Turkish invasion at Kamianets-Podilskyi (Kamieniec Podolski), in the Ukraine, while in 1644, his victory against the Tatars at the Battle of Ochmatów brought him international fame and recognition.|$|E

5|$|The {{foundations}} of the British Empire were laid when England and Scotland were separate kingdoms. In 1496, King Henry VII of England, following the successes of Spain and Portugal in overseas exploration, commissioned John Cabot to lead a voyage to discover a route to Asia via the North Atlantic. Cabot sailed in 1497, {{five years after the}} European discovery of America, but he made landfall on the coast of Newfoundland, and, mistakenly believing (like Christopher Columbus) that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>reached</b> Asia, there was no attempt to found a colony. Cabot led another voyage to the Americas the following year but nothing was ever heard of his ships again.|$|E
5|$|Æthelstan {{set out on}} his {{campaign}} in May 934, accompanied by four Welsh kings: Hywel Dda of Deheubarth, Idwal Foel of Gwynedd, Morgan ap Owain of Gwent, and Tewdwr ap Griffri of Brycheiniog. His retinue also included eighteen bishops and thirteen earls, six of whom were Danes from eastern England. By late June or early July <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>reached</b> Chester-le-Street, where he made generous gifts to the tomb of St Cuthbert, including a stole and maniple (ecclesiastical garments) originally commissioned by his step-mother Ælfflæd {{as a gift to}} Bishop Frithestan of Winchester. The invasion was launched by land and sea. According to the twelfth-century chronicler Simeon of Durham, his land forces ravaged as far as Dunnottar in north-east Scotland, while the fleet raided Caithness, then probably part of the Norse kingdom of Orkney.|$|E

5|$|Hawkins {{was born}} in Finley, New South Wales to Jack and Jenny Hawkins. He {{grew up in the}} New South Wales region of Finley as the middle child among three other siblings. He {{attended}} Finley High School and played for the Finley Football Club before making the move south of the border to begin boarding at Melbourne Grammar School. Hawkins' footballing ability was recognised early on when he was selected to play first XVIII football for the school whilst still in year ten, when many of his teammates were completing their final year of schooling at year twelve. Hawkins kicked four goals on debut for the school and his performances up forward soon received attention from AFL recruiting teams. By the time <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>reached</b> his final school year he was rewarded with joint captaincy of the football team alongside Hawthorn draftee Xavier Ellis. He was also selected in the Associated Public Schools (APS) team to play the Associated Grammar School (AGS) selected football team in the traditional annual clash of schools, where he won best on ground honours for his performance.|$|E
5|$|Kershaw had a 41 inning {{scoreless}} inning streak {{that ended}} {{in the top of}} the sixth inning on July 10 when, with two outs, Chase Headley homered to left field at Dodger Stadium. Kershaw's streak was, at the time, tied for the fifteenth longest scoreless inning streak in MLB history. He won the pitcher of the month award again in July, the third Dodger (along with Don Sutton and Burt Hooton) to win it two months in a row. He was 4–0 with a 1.10 ERA in the month with 48 strikeouts and only 10 walks. He picked up his 200th strikeout of the season on September 2, the fifth year in a row <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>reached</b> that number, trailing only the six seasons in a row for Sandy Koufax among Dodger starters. He also became just the fourth pitcher since 1893 to have at least five 200-strikeout seasons through an age-26 season (Bert Blyleven, Walter Johnson and Sam McDowell are the others).|$|E
5|$|Monaeses {{meanwhile}} entered Armenia {{and approached}} Tigranocerta. Tigranes had taken care to gather supplies, {{and the city}} was well-fortified and garrisoned with Romans and Armenians alike. The siege was largely undertaken by the Adiabenian contingent, since the Parthians, being cavalrymen, were unskilled and unwilling to engage in siegework. The Parthian assault failed, and was driven back with loss by a successful Roman sally. At this point, Corbulo sent an envoy to Vologases, who had encamped with his court at Nisibis, near Tigranocerta and the Roman–Parthian border. The failed siege and a shortage of fodder for his cavalry forced Vologases to agree to withdraw Monaeses from Armenia. At the same time however, the Romans too left Armenia, something that, according to Tacitus, raised suspicions of Corbulo's motives: some whispered that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>reached</b> an agreement of mutual withdrawal with the Parthians, {{and that he was}} unwilling to risk his reputation by renewing hostilities against them. At any rate, a truce was arranged and a Parthian embassy was dispatched to Rome. The negotiations failed to reach an agreement, and war was resumed in the spring of 62.|$|E
