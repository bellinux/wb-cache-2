25|$|There {{once was}} a fourth primary pantheon, the Eastern Pantheon, based on the Greek pantheon led by Zeus.

25|$|Alger's works {{received}} favorable {{comments and}} experienced a resurgence following his death. Until {{the advent of}} the Jazz Age in the 1920s, he sold about seventeen to twenty million volumes. In 1926, however, reader interest plummeted, and his major publisher ceased printing the books altogether. Surveys in 1932 and 1947 revealed very few children had read or <b>even</b> <b>heard</b> of Alger. The first Alger biography was a heavily fictionalized account published in 1928 by Herbert R. Mayes, who later admitted the work was a fraud.|$|E
25|$|Today, Pesach Sheni on the 14th of Iyar has {{the status}} of a very minor holiday (so much so that many of the Jewish people have never <b>even</b> <b>heard</b> of it, and it {{essentially}} does not exist outside of Orthodox and traditional Conservative Judaism). There are not really any special prayers or observances that are considered Jewish law. The only change in the liturgy is that in some communities Tachanun, a penitential prayer omitted on holidays, is not said. There is a custom, though not Jewish law, to eat just one piece of matzo on that night.|$|E
25|$|Hans Scholl, Alexander Schmorell, Christoph Probst, and Willi Graf were medical students. Their {{studies were}} {{regularly}} interrupted by terms of compulsory service as student {{soldiers in the}} Wehrmacht medical corps on the Eastern Front. Their experience during this time had {{a major impact on}} their thinking, and it also motivated their resistance, because it led to their disillusionment with the Nazi regime. Alexander Schmorell, who was born in Orenburg and raised by Russian nurses, spoke perfect Russian, which allowed him to have direct contact and communication with the local Russian population and their plight. This Russian insight proved invaluable during their time there, and he could convey to his fellow White Rose members what was not understood or <b>even</b> <b>heard</b> by other Germans coming from the Eastern front.|$|E

25|$|Even under good {{military}} leadership, the army's continued {{success was}} not assured {{because of its}} heavy reliance on conscript manpower. This reliance had several major weaknesses. First, the size of population was often too small to support the conqueror kings' wartime ambitions. With the size of population even under Toungoo and Konbaung empires only about 2 million, continual warfare was made possible only by gaining more territories and people for the next campaign. The strategy proved unsustainable {{in the long run}} both with Toungoo dynasty in the 1580s and 1590s and the Konbaung Dynasty in the 1770s and 1780s. The long running wars of the 16th and 18th centuries greatly depopulated the Irrawaddy valley, and correspondingly reduced their later kings' ability to project power in lands most conscripts had never <b>even</b> <b>heard</b> of. The populace welcomed breaks from warfare such as during the reign of King Thalun (r. 1629–1648) or that of King Singu (r. 1776–1782).|$|E
25|$|Ridgway {{was arrested}} in 1982 and 2001 on charges related to prostitution. He became {{a suspect in the}} Green River killings in 1983. In 1984, Ridgway took and passed a {{polygraph}} test (quality control protocols later developed in the FBI after careful review determined that Ridgway actually failed his polygraph test), and on April 7, 1987, police took hair and saliva samples from Ridgway. Around 1985, Ridgway began dating Judith Mawson, who became his third wife in 1988. Mawson claimed in a 2010 television interview that when she moved into his house while they were dating, there was no carpet. Detectives later told her he had probably wrapped a body in the carpet. In the same interview, she described how he would leave for work early in the morning some days, ostensibly for the overtime pay. Mawson speculated that he must have committed some of the murders while supposedly working these early morning shifts. She claimed that she had not suspected Ridgway's crimes before she was contacted by authorities in 1987, and had not <b>even</b> <b>heard</b> of the Green River Killer before that time because she did not watch the news.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea of the}} Pro Spectacular was {{inspired}} from Motorcycle Motocross Supercross. Professional only events held in indoor arenas with tracks that were built with greater difficulty to enthuse the spectators who were attracted by heavy television promotion. The intent, highly successful in the MX world was to turn MX from almost a strictly participatory sport into a sport that would have great appeal to spectators, who like in most team sports like baseball and football would pay entrance fees to watch. Like in Supercross the ABA restricted the event to pros eliminating the amateur and children classes and whenever possible held its Spectaculars indoors like in Supercross (this also reduced the politics inherent in deciding which track would hold a national in any given state) and invested heavily in television advertisements. Races where to be held on Friday nights and held to two hours in length. That could both could fit a television schedule and the attention span of an attending audience. This was to give BMX greater public exposure, most of which never <b>even</b> <b>heard</b> of BMX much less {{knew how to get}} involved which in turn would spark an up surge of the beginner classes at the local level. At the same time greater revenue could be obtain from the entrance fees, making the ABA less dependent on participation on the local level.|$|E

Those who watched at his bedside that <b>evening</b> <b>heard</b> him murmur, [...] "Let us Go! Let us Go!" [...] When asked where he wanted to go, Francis replied, [...] "To heaven, to heaven!"

25|$|Though Bermuda {{has been}} {{classified}} as a self-governed colony since 1620, internal self-government was bolstered by {{the establishment of a}} formal constitution in 1968, and the introduction of universal adult suffrage; debate about independence has ensued, although a 1995 independence referendum was soundly defeated. For many, Bermudian independence would mean little other than the obligation to staff foreign missions and embassies around the world, which would be a heavy obligation for Bermuda's small population, and the loss of British passports (which could severely restrict travel, as few enough countries have <b>even</b> <b>heard</b> of little Bermuda, and could regard travellers with suspicion). Another concern, which raised its head during the 1991 Gulf War, was the loss of the protection provided by the Royal Navy, especially, to the large number of merchant vessels on Bermuda's shipping register. The Bermuda government is unlikely to be able to provide naval protection to oil tankers plying the Persian Gulf, or other potentially dangerous waters. At present, Bermuda is {{able to take advantage of}} its status as part of the United Kingdom to attract overseas shipping operators to its register, although it does not contribute to the navy's budget. With independence, it was feared, a large chunk of the money currently flowing into the Bermuda Government's coffers would disappear. The current government is promoting independence – by means of a general election (that is, the government of the day would have the power to decide whether to go independent or not) as opposed to a referendum (a direct vote by the people) – by establishing a committee to investigate (though the committee is notably staffed with party members, and without representation by the opposition party). This stance is being supported by the UN, who have sent delegations to the island claiming that Bermuda is being suppressed by the British.|$|E

With the sympathetic support of Kemal seen as important to Soviet foreign policy, a compromise had been brokered providing for the reading of Kemal's statement without his physical presence in the hall — a decision which took the edge off of the inevitable anger and hubbub on the floor when it was read.|$|R
