40|$|AbstractEffect algebras {{have been}} {{introduced}} in the 1990 s {{in the study of}} the foundations of quantum mechanics, as part of a quantum-theoretic version of probability theory. This paper is part of that programme and gives a systematic account of Lebesgue integration for [0, 1]-valued functions in terms of effect algebras and <b>effect</b> modules. <b>The</b> starting point is the 'indicator' function for a measurable subset. It gives a homomorphism <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> algebra of measurable subsets to <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> module of [0, 1]-valued measurable functions which preserves countable joins. It is shown that the indicator is free among these maps: any such homomorphism <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> algebra of measurable subsets can be thought of as a generalised probability measure and can be extended uniquely to a homomorphism <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> module of [0, 1]-valued measurable functions which preserves joins of countable chains. The extension is the Lebesgue integral associated to this probability measure. The preservation of joins by it is the monotone convergence theorem...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{work has}} shown that T {{lymphocytes}} undergo apoptosis upon treatment with the glucocorticoid analogue dexamethasone. These cells can be protected <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> of dexamethasone by interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) or IL- 4. We were interested in analysing whether a transfected cell dependent on three different lymphokines could be protected by them <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> of dexamethasone. In addition, we took advantage of our cellular system, in which we expressed intermediate- or high-affinity IL- 2 R independently, to analyse the role of these receptors in <b>the</b> protection <b>from</b> glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis. In this report we show that IL- 2 rescues murine T cells expressing exogenous intermediate- (TS 1 beta) or high-affinity (TS 1 alpha beta) IL- 2 receptor (IL- 2 R) from dexamethasone-induced apoptosis. This result suggests that intermediate-affinity IL- 2 R alone can replace high-affinity IL- 2 R for <b>the</b> protection <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> of dexamethasone. In addition, IL- 4 and IL- 9 are rescue-factors, as well as IL- 2, of glucocorticoid-treated TS 1 beta and TS 1 alpha beta cells. Our {{data suggest that the}} presence of the alpha-chain of the IL- 2 R is not required for rescue by IL- 2 <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> of dexamethasone. In addition, we show that proliferation is not required for preventing glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis. This result implies a new role for the intermediate-affinity IL- 2 R...|$|R

The storm surge affected numerous low-lying cities in southeastern Louisiana by flooding roadways, including the only road to Grand Isle, stranding residents and visitors. The road was opened {{a day after the}} storm as floodwaters receded. The floodwaters entered a few homes and businesses in St. Tammany Parish.

He says that the Terrans are crazy because they do not respect the sanctity of life in the same way that the Athsheans do, which was why he led the attack against camp Smith.

Of the 11 that played for Scotland, six earned at least 10 caps: McColl (14), Docherty (25), McLeish (77), Burley (11), Levein (16) and Strachan (50).
