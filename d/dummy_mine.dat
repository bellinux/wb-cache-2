2500|$|To {{divert the}} American convoy {{into the path}} of the kaiten, Cdr. Oba {{released}} a <b>dummy</b> <b>mine</b> which was observed and engaged by the guns of Underhill. After several direct hits, the mine was determined to be a dud by the Americans and they continued on with their patrol. At this time, one of the submarine chasers lost power and had to be towed by PCE-872. Shortly thereafter, a sonar contact was made, so Underhill and PC-804 began depth charging the area. The destroyer escort is credited with sinking one of the kaiten at this point while another attacked PC-804. It missed the chaser and the kaiten turned around for a surface attack on Underhill. But as soon as the mini submarine was out of water, Lt. Cdr. Newcomb ordered a ramming maneuver because the kaiten was too close for his guns to bear. Underhill then sailed right over the kaiten and it exploded at 15:15 along with the escort's boilers and readied ammunition. Underhill was torn in two, the bow section of the ship quickly sank with all hands, the aft section remained afloat until being sunk by American gunfire the following day. All 122 survivors were wounded in action and each sailor received a Purple Heart. Lt. Cdr. Newcomb was killed and he was posthumously awarded the Silver Star. Two of the remaining American warships depth charged the area for an hour after Underhill was destroyed, but I-53 escaped and arrived back in Japan a month later, just {{before the end of the}} war. The last of the American survivors were picked up after at least an hour of being in the water though rescue operations continued until 18:30 that night. Most of the survivors were in need of urgent medical assistance which they received on PC-803 and [...] The engagement was one of the last in the Pacific War and was one of the few victories of the Japanese kaiten program.|$|E
50|$|Five 5 kg Torpex mines {{would be}} carried with a sixth <b>dummy</b> <b>mine</b> used to {{implicate}} UNITA.

5000|$|LeMay {{assigned}} {{one group}} of about 160 aircraft of the 313th Bombardment Wing to the task, with orders to plant 2,000 mines in April 1945.The mining runs were made by individual B-29 Superfortresses at night at moderately low altitudes. [...] Radar provided mine release information. [...] The 313th Bombardment Wing received preliminary training in aerial mining theory while their B-29 aircraft received bomb-bay modification to carry mines. [...] Individual aircrew were then given four to eight training flights involving five radar approaches on each flight and <b>dummy</b> <b>mine</b> drops on the last flight.|$|E

50|$|Tanks {{were also}} {{vulnerable}} to hand-placed anti-tank mines. Infantry have even immobilized tanks using {{a set of}} plates covered with leaves and dirt as <b>dummy</b> <b>mines</b> - the ruse being augmented by the crew's obscured vision - infantry can then attack the stopped tank. This tactic was taught to the British Home Guard during World War II since they were not often provided with long-range anti-tank weapons.|$|R
50|$|UNITA {{would later}} claim {{responsibility}} when they released a communique out of Lisbon, Portugal on 2 August 1984 stating they had sunk a Soviet and Cuban ship, destroying war material. The Angolan news agency ANGOP announced a Angolan and East German ship had {{been damaged by}} saboteurs with American mines, a statement the American's quickly denied. The Angolan's and Russian's had studied the <b>dummy</b> <b>mine</b> and their investigations concluded it was too unsophisticated {{to have been the}} type that had caused the destruction and that the operation was the work of the South African special forces though the use of a submarine was not suspected. Anti-diving countermeasures would be introduced in the harbour as well as increased naval patrols.|$|E
50|$|The {{two ships}} {{that had been}} {{attacked}} were, the MV Arendsee a 7,500 ton East German cargo vessel and the MV Lundoge a 9,000 ton Angolan vessel. Arendsee, carrying heavy vehicles, artillery and industrial cargo, was sunk by two explosions and resting on the bottom stern up would be towed to a sandbar four hours later.. A <b>dummy</b> <b>mine</b> would later be removed from her, her cargo removed and as {{she was unable to}} be repaired, towed out to sea and sunk on 30 August. The Lundoge, carrying military equipment and foodstuff, was hit by two explosions, was sailed by its crew to a nearby quay before settling. With most of her cargo destroyed she was patched up and sailed to Rio de Janeiro were she was repaired and re-entered service until 1995.|$|E

25|$|The {{point of}} Task Force Growdon reached Munsan-ni at 18:30 on March 23, but the {{remainder}} of the extended column took several hours longer. The force encountered no Chinese positions along Route 1 but was kept to an intermittent crawl by having to lift or explode over 150 live mines, some of them booby-trapped, and almost as many <b>dummy</b> <b>mines,</b> including a five-mile (8km) stretch of buried C-rations and beer cans. Casualties were few, but four tanks were disabled by mines. As the last of these tanks hit a mine a mile (1.5km) below Munsan-ni, the explosion attracted artillery fire that damaged two more. The tail of the task force finally arrived at the airborne position at 07:00 on March 24.|$|R
50|$|Carey {{served in}} World War II as a Captain {{in the special}} forces unit Z Force, {{developing}} a bold plan using small teams to mine ships in an enemy harbour.

25|$|Many {{dogs were}} used to locate mines. They did not prove to be very {{effective}} under combat conditions. Marine mine detecting dogs were trained using bare electric wires beneath the ground surface. The wires shocked the dogs, teaching them that danger lurked under the dirt. Once the dog's focus was properly directed, <b>dummy</b> <b>mines</b> were planted and the dogs were trained to signal their presence. While the dogs effectively found the mines, the task proved so stressful for the dogs they were only able to work between 20 and 30 minutes at a time. The mine detecting war dogs anticipated random shocks from the heretofore friendly earth, making them extremely nervous. The useful service life of the dogs was not long. Experiments with lab rats show that this trend can be very extreme, in some tests rats even huddled in the corner {{to the point of}} starvation to avoid electric shock.|$|R
500|$|The German surface raider [...] was {{the first}} Axis warship to operate in Australian waters during World War II. After {{operating}} off {{the northern tip of}} New Zealand and the South Pacific, Orion entered Australian waters in the Coral Sea in August 1940 and closed to within [...] north-east of Brisbane on 11 August. Following this, Orion headed east and operated off New Caledonia before proceeding south into the Tasman Sea, sinking the merchant ship Notou south-west of Noumea on 16 August and the British merchant ship Turakina in the Tasman Sea four days later. Orion sailed south-west after sinking Turakina, passing south of Tasmania, and operated without success in the Great Australian Bight in early September. While Orion laid four <b>dummy</b> <b>mines</b> off Albany, Western Australia on 2 September, she departed to the south-west after being spotted by an Australian aircraft the next day. After unsuccessfully patrolling in the Southern Ocean, Orion sailed for the Marshall Islands to refuel, arriving there on 10 October.|$|R
25|$|At {{midnight on}} 22 June 1943, the unit left Magnetic Island and paddled by folboat through the heavily mined mouth of Townsville Harbour. <b>Dummy</b> limpet <b>mines</b> were {{attached}} to ten ships, including two destroyers. The men rowed into Ross Creek, dismantled and hid their folboats, then travelled into Townsville {{to find a place}} to sleep. Around 10:00am, the limpets were discovered, and panic ensued.|$|R
25|$|The British {{made several}} {{attempts}} to sink Königsberg including one to slip a shallow-draught torpedo boat (with escorts) within range, an operation easily repulsed {{by the force}} in the delta. A blockship, the Newbridge, was sunk by the British across one of the delta mouths to prevent her escape; however, it was soon realized that Königsberg could still escape {{through one of the}} delta's other channels. <b>Dummy</b> <b>mines</b> were laid in some of these alternatives, but they were considered a doubtful deterrent. A civilian pilot named Cutler was hired to bring his Curtiss seaplane for reconnaissance; his plane was shot down, although the presence of the elusive cruiser was verified. A pair of Royal Naval Air Service Sopwith seaplanes were brought up with the intention of scouting and even bombing the ship, but they soon fell apart in the tropical conditions. A trio of Short seaplanes fared a little better, managing to take photographs of the ship before they were grounded by the glue-melting tropical heat and German fire.|$|R
40|$|A remote-sensing method {{based on}} active {{high-power}} microwave (HPM) illumination and detection {{in the infrared}} (IR) region is described {{for the detection of}} shallow buried landmines. This method is based on different interactions of the incident HPM radiation with the mine and the surrounding soil which occur due to a difference in their complex dielectric constants. This leads {{to the development of a}} thermal signature of the mine at the soil surface that can be detected in the infrared region. The thermal signature which is observed initially in near real-time persists for several minutes following HPM illumination. It is primarily made up of two components. The first component appears on the soil surface in near real-time due to the interference of the incident HPM beam and the HPM beam reflected by the mine. A second signature is due to the absorption of microwave energy by the mine. This signature appears at the soil surface after a brief time-delay from the start of HPM illumination. At any instant, the resultant thermal signature at the soil surface is the sum of the two time-dependent signatures. In this report we provide both laboratory and field trial results obtained using this method to detect metallic and non-metallic <b>mine</b> surrogates, <b>dummy</b> <b>mines</b> without explosives and live mines wit...|$|R
50|$|Command of the German defences of the Western Front was {{conducted}} by Hitler through OKW. Since 1940, work had been done on the fortification of ports and {{the defeat of the}} Dieppe Raid (19 August 1942) for the loss of only 600 casualties, demonstrated the defensive value of fortifications. In March 1942, Hitler issued Directive 40, requiring that an invasion force be defeated before it could land or on the coast; in November 1943, Hitler added Directive 51, for the reinforcement of the defences of Western Europe. Rommel was sent from Italy to inspect the coast defences and then Heeresgruppe B was transferred from Italy to command the 15th Army (General Hans von Salmuth) deployed from Antwerp to the Orne and the 7th Army (General Friedrich Dollmann) from the Orne to the Loire but was limited only to a coastal strip 6 mi deep. Further south, Heeresgruppe G commanded the 1st Army and the 19th Army on the French Atlantic and the Mediterranean coasts. Command of the forces further inland was retained by Rundstedt but command of the panzer and panzergrenadier divisions was eventually split between OKW and the two army groups, Rundstedt retaining command only of the three divisions in Heeresgruppe G. Rommel kept the civilian workers of Organisation Todt and troops busy installing a mutually-supporting Perlenschnur (string of pearls) of steel and concrete defensive positions with overlapping fields of fire based on Widerstandsnester (resistance nests) formed into Stüzpunkter (strong points) and Stützpunktgruppe (strong point groups). Beach obstacles, anti-tank ditches were built and vast numbers of real and <b>dummy</b> <b>mines</b> were laid, trebling the number planted since 1941. By the end of 1943 about 8,500 fortifications had been built and another 12,247 were added in northern France by 6 June. Artillery positions were moved and false positions dug to mislead Allied air reconnaissance.|$|R
50|$|The 47th Division {{transferred}} to the Ypres Salient, and the 1/6th Bn absorbed a large draft of reinforcements. Training continued between spells spent holding the line. On 20 February 1917 the 1/6th carried out a large-scale trench raid involving all four rifle companies with attached sappers from 520 Company Royal Engineers and 2nd Australian Tunnelling Company, a total of 20 officers and 640 other ranks. <b>Dummy</b> raids, <b>mines</b> and bombardments on neighbouring sections of the line were used to deceive the enemy. A Stokes mortar barrage on the German front line cut the wire {{in front of the}} attack and kept the defenders in their dugouts, while field guns laid a box barrage to seal off the area attacked. The attack went in at 17.00, led by the second-in-command of 1/6th sounding a hunting horn, and met almost no hostile fire. A record number of prisoners were taken, dugouts, emplacements and a mine shaft were destroyed, and considerable intelligence gained. After about an hour, the raiders retired to their own lines as dusk fell.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the morning}} of the third day out, 24 July 1945, about 200 to 300 miles {{northeast}} of Cape Engaño, Underhills radar detected a Japanese [...] "Dinah" [...] reconnaissance plane circling the convoy about ten miles out. Her crew immediately manned their battle stations and ordered other escorts to air defense stations. The Japanese pilot remained out of gun range, determining the convoys base course and relaying it to Japanese submarines in the area. After some 45 minutes, Underhill crew secured from battle stations and ordered the other escorts to resume assigned patrol stations. During this time, an SC had developed mechanical problems and had to be taken in tow by PCE-872.Two or three Japanese submarines were in the area. After establishing the convoys base course, one released a <b>dummy</b> naval <b>mine</b> {{in the path of the}} convoy. When it was sighted by Underhill lookouts, the ships commander ordered a general course change to port. When the last ship had cleared, Underhill stood in to sink the mine. After repeated direct hits by the 20-millimeter guns and 30-calibre rifle fire, the convoy realized the mine was a diversionary tactic by the Japanese submarines.|$|R
40|$|In this way, the {{measurement}} device {{can be used}} to aid us in finding the optimal set of vehicle parameters for a certain situation. 8. Discussion Not only is this ground pressure measurement device valuable in the process of designing a vehicle for demining, it could also be used to test whether existing vehicles are siutable for the task. Many new detection technologies are simply outfitted onto an readily available platform such as an ATV or a small backhoe. The ground pressure of these vehicles would be tested, and as customizations are made, the ground pressure will be modified as well. Other applications of this device could include testing of detection technologies. Those technologies such as mechanical prodders, waterjet, or the air spade, which all disturb the ground in some way. These make detonation of the land mine they are detecting a possibility. This measurement device could be used to test the dangers involved with each detection method. Also, {{at the same time the}} device is measuring the ground pressure effects of the detec-tion system, the mine could easily fulfill a role as a <b>dummy</b> anti-tank <b>mine.</b> It is roughly the same size as many anti-tank mines and will present some challenge to detection systems because it is primarily plastic...|$|R
40|$|The Norwegian {{long-term}} {{program for}} military use of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) reached an important milestone in December 2001, when {{the concept of}} AUV based mine hunting and rapid environmental assessment (REA) was demonstrated from the Oksøy class mine hunting vessel KNM Karmøy. Within one day, the complete concept of AUV based mine hunting was demonstrated: The HUGIN AUV was programmed and launched from the MCMV, performed an acoustically controlled survey, proceeded to carry out an autonomous mine reconnaissance survey in a forward area with mine-like bottom objects, {{and returned to the}} MCMV for recovery. Through automatic mine detection and classification algorithms, a list of mine-like contacts was established, and data from these contacts was evaluated manually. The end result was that four out of four <b>mine</b> <b>dummies</b> were detected, classified, and accurately positioned on each of the demonstrations. Four months after the successful demonstrations, the Royal Norwegian Navy approved a project to develop the HUGIN Mine Reconnaissance System (HMRS), the first HUGIN system developed specifically for military applications. Current plans are to introduce the first HMRS vehicle to the Norwegian MCM forces in 2004 / 05. ...|$|R
