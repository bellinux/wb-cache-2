25|$|Galton {{invented the}} term {{eugenics}} in 1883 and set down {{many of his}} observations and conclusions in a book, Inquiries into Human Faculty and Its Development. He believed that a scheme of 'marks' for family merit should be defined, and early marriage between families of high rank be encouraged by provision of monetary incentives. He pointed {{out some of the}} tendencies in British society, such as the late marriages of eminent people, and the paucity of their children, which he thought were <b>dysgenic.</b> He advocated encouraging eugenic marriages by supplying able couples with incentives to have children. On 29 October 1901, Galton chose to address eugenic issues when he delivered the second Huxley lecture at the Royal Anthropological Institute.|$|E
25|$|Lynn and Harvey {{have argued}} that the causes of the above are {{difficult}} to interpret since these countries have had significant recent immigration from countries with lower average national IQs. Nevertheless, they expect that similar patterns will occur, or have occurred, first in other developed nations and then in the developing world as {{there is a limit to}} how much environmental factors can improve intelligence. Furthermore, during the last century there is a negative correlation between fertility and intelligence although there is not yet any conclusive evidence of the association between the two. They estimate that there has been a <b>dysgenic</b> decline in the world's genotypic IQ (masked by the Flynn effect for the phenotype) of 0.86 IQ points per decade for the years 1950–2000.|$|E
25|$|Late in his life, Shockley became {{intensely}} {{interested in}} questions of race, human intelligence, and eugenics. He thought {{this work was}} important to the genetic future {{of the human species}} and he came to describe it as the most important work of his career, even though expressing his views damaged his reputation. Shockley argued that a higher rate of reproduction among the less intelligent was having a <b>dysgenic</b> effect, and that a drop in average intelligence would ultimately lead to a decline in civilization. With regard to racial differences he used the following standard statement, e.g., on a debate with Afro-centrist Frances Welsing and on Firing Line with William F. Buckley Jr.:My research leads me inescapably to the opinion that the major cause of the American Negro's intellectual and social deficits is hereditary and racially genetic in origin and, thus, not remediable to a major degree by practical improvements in the environment.Shockley's published writings and lectures to scientific organizations on this topic were partly based on the writings of psychologist Cyril Burt and were funded by the Pioneer Fund. Shockley also proposed that individuals with IQs below 100 be paid to undergo voluntary sterilization.|$|E

50|$|<b>Dysgenics</b> (also {{known as}} cacogenics) {{is the study}} of factors {{producing}} the accumulation and perpetuation of defective or disadvantageous genes and traits in offspring of a particular population or species.|$|R
2500|$|We must {{therefore}} concentrate on producing a single equalized environment; and this clearly {{should be one}} as favourable {{as possible to the}} expression of the genetic qualities that we think desirable. Equally clearly, this should include the following items. A marked raising of the standard of diet for the great majority of the population, until all should be provided both with adequate calories and adequate accessory factors; provision of facilities for healthy exercise and recreation; and upward equalization of educational opportunity. ... we know from various sources that raising the standard of life among the poorest classes almost invariably results in a lowering of their fertility. In so far, therefore, as differential class-fertility exists, raising the environmental level will reduce any <b>dysgenic</b> effects which it may now have.|$|E
2500|$|Some German teachers' {{representatives and}} a number of {{scientists}} disputed the PISA findings. They claimed, amongst other things, that the questions had been ill-translated, that the samples drawn in some countries were not representative, that German students (most of whom had never done a multiple choice tests in their lives before) were disadvantaged by the multiple choice questions, that the PISA questions had no curricular validity and that PISA was [...] "in fact an IQ-test", which according to them showed that <b>dysgenic</b> fertility was taking place in Germany. Additionally, the OECD was criticized for following its own agenda of a strictly economically utilitarian education policy—as opposed to humanist education policy following the German ideal of Bildung—and for trying to establish an educational testing industry without democratic legitimation.|$|E

50|$|Lynn {{presented}} counter-arguments, such as {{the traits}} discussed are not genetically determined, intelligence and fertility can be inversely related without <b>dysgenics,</b> socio-economic status does not differ genetically, {{and there is no}} such thing as a 'bad gene', and dismissed all of the counter-arguments on the basis that the trends he found represent a serious problem, leading him to announce his support of eugenics.|$|R

5000|$|A {{review of}} <b>Dysgenics</b> by W. D. Hamilton, Royal Society {{research}} professor in evolutionary {{biology at the}} University of Oxford, was published posthumously in 2000. Hamilton wrote a lengthy review stating that Lynn, [...] "discussing the large bank of evidence that still accumulates on heritability of aptitudes and differentials of fertility,shows in this book {{that almost all of}} the worries of the early eugenicists were well-founded, in spite of the relative paucity of their evidence at the time".|$|R
50|$|In The New York Times, Dan Mitchell {{argued that}} Fox might be shying {{away from the}} cautionary tale about low-intelligence <b>dysgenics,</b> because the company {{did not want to}} offend either its viewers or {{potential}} advertisers portrayed negatively in the film. In 2017, Judge told The New York Times that the film's lack of marketing and wide release was the result of negative test screenings. He added that Fox subsequently decided to not give the film a strong marketing push because the distributor believed it would develop a cult following through word-of-mouth and recoup its budget through home video sales, as Judge's previous film Office Space had.|$|R

50|$|Lynn {{examined}} sibling {{studies and}} concluded that the tendency of children with a high number of siblings to be the least intelligent is evidence of <b>dysgenic</b> fertility.

50|$|Richard Lynn (born February 20, 1930) is an English {{professor}} emeritus {{of psychology at the}} University of Ulster and assistant editor of the journal Mankind Quarterly. Lynn studies intelligence and is known for his belief in racial differences in intelligence. Lynn was educated at King's College, Cambridge in England. He has worked as lecturer in psychology at the University of Exeter and as {{professor of psychology at the}} Economic and Social Research Institute, Dublin, and at the University of Ulster at Coleraine. He has written or co-written 11 books and more than 200 journal articles spanning five decades. Two of his recent books are on <b>dysgenics</b> and eugenics.|$|R
5000|$|Stoddard {{visited the}} Hereditary Health Court in Charlottenburg, {{an appeals court}} that decided whether Germans would be {{forcibly}} sterilized. After having observed several <b>dysgenics</b> trials at the court, Stoddard stated that the eugenics legislation was [...] "being administered with strict regard for its provisions and that, if anything, judgments were almost too conservative" [...] and that the law was [...] "weeding out the worst strains in the Germanic stock in a scientific and truly humanitarian way."However, Stoddard was {{taken aback by the}} forthrightness of the Nazis' anti-Jewish views, foreseeing that the [...] "Jewish problem" [...] would soon be settled [...] "by the physical elimination of the Jews themselves from the Third Reich." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{author of}} many papers and books, Porteus also created a racial {{hierarchy}} of intelligence using his maze device which he believed was [...] "a valid, culture-free measure of general intelligence--despite the fact that among his South African samples one group that already knew a 'labyrinth game' outscored all neighboring groups that {{did not know the}} game" [...] (Cole 56). His theories about the superior intelligence of white races has led to recent controversy, including protests by students at the University of Hawaii. Porteus was an early contributor to Mankind Quarterly, helped William Shockley organize the Foundation for Education on Eugenics and <b>Dysgenics,</b> and served on the executive committee of the International Association for the Advancement of Ethnology and Eugenics.|$|R
50|$|In the 2006 Mike Judge film Idiocracy, {{a fictional}} character, pvt. Joe Bauers, aka Not Sure (played by Luke Wilson), awakens from a {{cryogenic}} stasis {{in the year}} 2505 into a world devastated by <b>dysgenic</b> degeneration. Bauers, who was chosen for his averageness, is discovered to be the smartest human alive and eventually becomes president of the United States.|$|E
50|$|Some centers {{specifically}} targeted {{women in}} an effort to control and regulate a subsection of the female population that was defined as fertile, feeble-minded, female paupers and therefore officially recognized as <b>dysgenic.</b> This theoretical relationship manifested itself in early legislation that supported psychological asylums that aimed to indirectly criminalize not an action, but the female body itself.|$|E
5000|$|Instead {{of trying}} to control the rate of {{population}} growth per se, trying to arrange things so that all population groups of a certain type (e.g. all social classes within a society) have the same average rate of population growth. This is not eugenics, because it does not discriminate, but it is an attempt to avoid a <b>dysgenic</b> outcome.|$|E
5000|$|Other novels {{touching}} {{upon the}} subject include The Gate to Women's Country by Sheri S. Tepper and That Hideous Strength by C. S. Lewis. The Eugenics Wars {{are a significant}} part of the background story of the Star Trek universe (episodes [...] "Space Seed", [...] "Borderland", [...] "Cold Station 12", [...] "The Augments" [...] and the film Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan). Eugenics also plays a significant role in the Neanderthal Parallax trilogy where eugenics-practicing Neanderthals from a near-utopian parallel world create a gateway to earth. Cowl by Neal Asher describes the collapse of western civilization due to <b>dysgenics.</b> Also Eugenics is the name for the medical company in La Foire aux immortels book by Enki Bilal and on the Immortel (Ad Vitam) movie by the same author.|$|R
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of hybrid dysgenesis {{was investigated in}} Drosophila sturtevanti Duda, 1927 using diagnostic crosses {{similar to those used}} for induction of <b>dysgenics</b> traits in D. melanogaster. Reciprocal test crosses were made, at 27 ° C, between an old laboratory strain of D. sturtevanti (COL, from Colombia), assumed to be an M'-like strain, and eight freshly collected strains from several natural populations. The gonadal dysgenesis indices were under 10 % in most of crosses, except in hybrids of COL with I 27, a strain from Minas Gerais (Brazil), in which the index values were moderate in both directions of crosses (25. 71 and 12. 87). The smallest productivity was also observed in hybrids of females COL mated to I 27 males. No causal relationship between the observed gonadal dysgenesis and mobilization of P element or another transposable element could be effectively established...|$|R
5000|$|Another {{review of}} <b>Dysgenics</b> {{was written in}} 2002 by Nicholas Mackintosh, emeritus {{professor}} of experimental psychology in the University of Cambridge. Mackintosh wrote that, [...] "with a cavalier disregard for political correctness, {{he argues that the}} ideas of the eugenecists were correct and that we ignore them at our peril." [...] While recognising that the book provides a valuable and accurate source of information, he criticised Lynn for [...] "not fully acknowledging the negative relationship between social class and education on the one hand, and infant mortality and life expectancy on the other." [...] He questioned Lynn's interpretation of data. He also points out that according to Lynn's reading of the theory of natural selection, [...] "if it is true that those with lower IQ and less education are producing more offspring, then they are fitter than those of higher IQ and more education". According to Mackintosh, eugenicist arguments are not based on a [...] "biological imperative, but rather on a particular set of value judgements." ...|$|R
5000|$|Rui Nunes {{wrote that}} {{dysgenics}} is {{the selection of}} genetic traits that are [...] "commonly accepted as a disabling condition," [...] and like eugenics, dysgenics can be positively selected or negatively selected. Nunes defined positive dysgenics as a selection that increases {{the number of individuals}} with <b>dysgenic</b> traits, while negative dysgenics is the discarding of genetics that cause disability.|$|E
50|$|In {{the context}} of human genetics, a <b>dysgenic</b> effect is the {{projected}} or observed tendency ofa reduction in selection pressures and decreased infant mortality since the Industrial Revolution resulting in the increased propagation of deleterious traits and genetic disorders. Richard Lynn in his Dysgenics: Genetic Deterioration in Modern Populations (1996) identified three main concerns: deterioration in health, in intelligence, and in conscientiousness.|$|E
5000|$|The {{adjective}} [...] "dysgenic" [...] is the antonym of [...] "eugenic". It {{was first}} used [...] 1915 by David Starr Jordan, describing the supposed <b>dysgenic</b> effects of World War I. Jordan believed that healthy men were as likely to die in modern warfare as anyone else, and that war killed only the physically healthy men of the populace whilst preserving the disabled at home.|$|E
50|$|The {{science fiction}} film Idiocracy (2005) portrays the U.S. as a greatly dumbed-down society 500 {{years in the}} future, in which low {{cultural}} conditions were unintentionally achieved by eroding language and education coupled with <b>dysgenics,</b> where people of lower intelligence reproduced faster than the people of higher intelligence. Similar concepts appeared in earlier works, notably the science fiction short story The Marching Morons (1951), by Cyril M. Kornbluth which also features a modern-day protagonist in a future dominated by low-intelligence persons. Moreover, the novel Brave New World (1931), by Aldous Huxley, discussed the ways a utopian society was deliberately dumbed down {{in order to maintain}} political stability and social order by eliminating complex concepts unnecessary for society to function (i.e. the Savage tries reading Shakespeare to the masses and is not understood). More malevolent uses of dumbing down to preserve the social order are also portrayed in The Matrix, Nineteen Eighty-Four and many dystopian movies.|$|R
50|$|Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic {{fiction is}} a subgenre of science fiction, science fantasy or horror fiction {{literature}} {{in which the}} Earth's technological civilization is collapsing or has collapsed. The apocalypse event may be climatic, such as runaway climate change; natural, such as an impact event; man-made, such as nuclear warfare or resource depletion; medical, such as a Pandemic, whether natural or man-made; or imaginative, such as a zombie apocalypse, cybernetic revolt, technological singularity, <b>dysgenics,</b> or alien invasion. The story may involve attempts to prevent an apocalypse event, deal with the impact and consequences of the event itself, {{or it may be}} post-apocalyptic, set after the event. The time frame may be immediately after the catastrophe, focusing on the travails or psychology of survivors, the way to maintain the human race alive and together as one, or considerably later, often including the theme that the existence of pre-catastrophe civilization has been forgotten (or mythologized). Post-apocalyptic stories often take place in a non-technological future world, or a world where only scattered elements of society and technology remain.|$|R
2500|$|In 1940, at {{the height}} of World War II, Northern Transylvania, {{including}} Cluj, was ceded by Romania to Hungary following the Second Vienna Award. The entire university and its logistics moved to Sibiu. Cupcea remained in contact with his colleagues, publishing in Revista de Psihologie: in 1941, Constituția morfologică la bolnavii mintal ("The Morphological Built of the Mentally Ill"); in 1944, Încercarea unui sistem de psihopatologie constituțională evolutiv ("Sketching a System of Progressive Bodily Psychopathology"). He based these studies on the impact of health on intelligence, and the theories of Ernst Kretschmer, by examining the body types of university students, industrial workers and mental patients in relation to their intelligence quotient and state of mind, describing various correlations. A disciple of physician and eugenicist Iuliu Moldovan, he frequented ASTRA Society and published in its paper the 1941 tract Ce este Eugenia ("What Eugenics Is"). It discussed [...] "the improvement of the genetic dowry" [...] through both positive and negative measures. Quoting Moldovan and Francis Galton, Cupcea tried to delimit his field of interest from Nazi racial science (too radical) and euthenics (too mild), preferring Moldovan's term [...] "hygiene of the nation". At the time, he expressed himself as a supporter of strict biological determinism, and demanded the universal introduction of prenuptial examinations to filter out the <b>dysgenics.</b>|$|R
