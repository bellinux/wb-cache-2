60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> pleased me best at Dijon was {{the little}} old Parc, a charming public garden, {{about a mile from}} the town, to which I walked by a long, {{straight}} autumnal avenue. It is a jardin fran- cais of the last century, - a dear old place, with little blue-green perspectives and alleys and rondpoints, in which everything balances. I went there late in the afternoon, without meeting a creature, though I had hoped I should meet the President de Brosses. At the end of it was a little river that looked like a canal, and on the further bank was an old-fashioned villa, close to the water, with a little French garden of its own. On the hither side was a bench, on which I seated myself, lingering a good while; for this was just the sort of place I like. It was the furthermost point of my little tour. I thought that over, as I sat there, on the eve of taking the express to Paris; and as the light faded in the Parc the vision of some of the things I had seen became more distinct.|$|E

40|$|Chemical-free IPM Cue: Integrated Pest Management, often {{known as}} IPM, is a {{technique}} for crop management that many extension programmes are teaching. Normally IPM combines the use of both chemical and biological pest control methods, as well as pest reducing land management practices. But in northern Tanzania, an NGO called the Zonal Plant Protection Centre has been developing and teaching farmers IPM methods that are purely organic, and make no use of chemical pesticides. To {{find out about the}} advantages and disadvantages of these methods, and whether the organic farmers were actually making a profit from their production, Lazarus Laiser went to an agricultural show in Arusha and spoke to Mr. Lotto Simon. Mr. Simon is an employee of the NGO who both farms himself and trains other farmers. He began by explaining why organic pest control methods were appropriate for farmers in his area. IN:		?The knowledge is appropriate ?? OUT:		?? certificate which he has got. ? DUR?N	 3 ? 47 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Mr. Lotto Simon on the benefits and difficulties of organic production and pest control. Transcript Simon	The knowledge is appropriate to us because our environment is flooded with industrial chemicals and fertilizers, so we would like to reduce this, or to eliminate. Also human health will be sustained, as no toxic is applied. We only apply the botanicals which are available in our environment. Laiser	Can you mention some of the techniques that you are using in organic agriculture? Simon	Use of natural, environmentally available materials for crop and animal production. Also organic fertilizers such as cattle manure, and use of biological control methods in pest control: botanicals available in our environment. Laiser	<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> you are doing, or the programme in organic agriculture, it has some advantages. What are the advantages of organic agriculture? Simon	Advantages. We have got reliable markets, especially here in Arusha, due to publicity. We publicise in our areas that we are practising this agriculture so we have got reliable markets. For example we are selling our products, like cabbages, and also in Nairobi and at Dar Es Salaam. They are paying good price, for example for one cabbage they are paying us 100 shillings in the field, which is a lot of money. And also farmers? standard is raised now, because most of them have got modern houses through this farming. Laiser	How about disadvantages; can you mention some? Simon	The disadvantage of organic farming is, you will not apply it in large scale, because it is laborious. That is a major disadvantage. For example, in botanical application, if you want to eradicate diamondback moth in your field, you must apply twice per week, up to thrice. In industrial-chemical, you have to apply only once and you eliminate. It is time consuming actually. Laiser	How about a very poor farmer. Can he afford to try this kind of method? Simon	Yes, this farming is especially for those poor farmers, because, for example in my area, nobody would not have cattle, at least one to two, so a poor farmer can afford this agriculture because he can get manure from his cattle. Also he can get urine which can be applied as a pesticide or insecticide, and also a poor farmer must afford to have trees in his field for fodder, which also is important in fertilizer preparation, like tea manure. Laiser	How about the market? Is there any permanent market for organic products? Simon	That is a big problem, we don?t have a permanent market. Maybe in the future; because the market which we are getting we are finding every year; it is not permanent. So we have to announce ourselves, due to our certificate which we have got. Every farmer who are practising this farming have got a certificate. Laiser	How long it has took for somebody to get a certificate? Simon	It took about three years to complete training and after that they provide a certificate. So it is the duty of the farmer to go and search for a market, through his certificate which he has got. End of track.
