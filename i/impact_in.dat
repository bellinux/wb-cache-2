5|$|Due to Paula's small size, <b>impact</b> <b>in</b> Mexico was minor, mainly {{limited to}} light {{rainfall}} and winds. However, an American tourist drowned offshore Cozumel. After Paula attained its peak intensity on October13, wind shear began to increase, causing the storm to weaken. The storm turned north-northeastward {{and fell to}} tropical storm intensity on October14. Shortly thereafter, Paula made landfall in the Cuban province of Pinar del Río. Early on October15, Paula weakened to a tropical depression while moving eastward over Cuba, before degenerating into a remnant low pressure area about six hours later. In Cuba, rainfall was mostly beneficial. Strong winds, with gusts reaching 68mph (109km/h), left power outages in Pinar del Río and Artemisa provinces. In the Havana area, a few homes were deroofed, while falling trees blocked many roads. <b>Impact</b> <b>in</b> the Florida Keys was minimal, limited to light rainfall and increased tides.|$|E
