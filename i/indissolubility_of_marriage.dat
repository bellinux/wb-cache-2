40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{the different ways}} that clandestine marriages were reproved {{in the writings of}} reformists and for what purposes. Medieval doctors had already demonstrated that a clandestine marriage was morally bad and canonically prohibited, even if they had had to recognize its validity to strengthen the consensualist theory of sacrament. In order to prove marriage was an honorable way to salvation for the laity, the theologian Jean Raulin argued that clandestine marriages were as devilish as adultery or fornication. Erasmus reproved the troubles that arose from the validity <b>of</b> <b>marriages</b> contracted without family consent or by having sex after betrothal. The two of them wanted to defend the marriage sacrament and reorder society. But Erasmus’s calling into question the sacramentality and <b>indissolubility</b> <b>of</b> clandestine <b>marriages</b> opened the way for Lutheran questioning of the scholastic theory of marriage: it is no sacrament but a civil contract, and parental approval is necessary to create it...|$|R

She sees in it the confirmation of the goodness <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> and the proclamation that thenceforth marriage will be an efficacious sign of Christ's presence. In his preaching Jesus unequivocally taught the original meaning of the union of man and woman as the Creator willed it from the beginning permission given by Moses to divorce one's wife was a concession to the hardness of hearts. The matrimonial union of man and woman is indissoluble: God himself has determined it 'what therefore God has joined together, let no man put asunder'. This unequivocal insistence on the <b>indissolubility</b> <b>of</b> the <b>marriage</b> bond may have left some perplexed and could {{seem to be a}} demand impossible to realize. However, Jesus has not placed on spouses a burden impossible to bear, or too heavy - heavier than the Law of Moses. By coming to restore the original order of creation disturbed by sin, he himself gives the strength and grace to live marriage in the new dimension of the Reign of God." ...|$|R

I know your argument by heart, that Christian character develops by submission, by suffering, that it is the woman's place to submit, to efface herself. But the root of the matter goes deeper than that. I am far from deploring sacrifice, yet common-sense tells us that our sacrifice should be guided by judgment, that foolish sacrifices are worse than useless. And there are times when the very limitations of our individuality--necessary limitation's for us--prevent our sacrifices from counting.|$|E
5000|$|Catholic {{women were}} the last {{to take up the}} agitation. The main reason for this is the impregnability of Catholic principles. Owing to this woman's {{suffrage}} did not become a burning question as quickly in the purely Catholic countries as in Protestant and religiously mixed ones. The convents, the <b>indissolubility</b> <b>of</b> sacramental <b>marriage</b> and the customary charitable works kept in check many difficulties. However, on account of the international character of the movement and the causes which produced it, Catholic women would not finally hold back from co-operation in solving the question, especially as the attack of revolutionary ideas on the Church today is most severe in Catholic countries. For a long time Christian charity has not sufficed for the needs of the day. Social aid must supplement legal ordinances for the justifiable demands of women. For this purpose the [...] "ligues des femmes chrétiennes" [...] were formed in Belgium in 1893; in France [...] "Le féminisme chrétien" [...] and [...] "L'action sociale des femmes" [...] in 1895, after the international review, [...] "La femme contemporaine", had been established in 1893. In Germany the [...] "Katholisches Frauenbund" [...] was founded in 1904, and the [...] "Katholische Reichs-Frauenorganisation" [...] in Austria in 1907, while a woman's society was established in Italy in 1909. In 1910 the [...] "Katholisches Frauen-Weltbund" [...] (International Association of Catholic Women) was established at Brussels on the insistent urging of the [...] "Ligue patriotique des Françaises". Thus an international Catholic women's association exists today, in opposition to the international liberal women's association and the international Social-Democratic union. The Catholic society competes with these others in seeking to bring about a social reform for the benefit of women in accordance with the principles of the Church.|$|R

Never before perhaps had each of these four women realized so clearly how much Miltoun--that rather strange and unknown grandson, son, and brother--counted {{in the scheme of}} existence. Their suppressed agitation was manifested in very different ways. Lady Casterley, upright in her chair, showed it only by an added decision of speech, a continual restless movement of one hand, a thin line between her usually smooth brows. Lady Valleys wore a puzzled look, as if a little surprised that she felt serious. Agatha looked frankly anxious. She was in her quiet way a woman of much character, endowed with that natural piety, which accepts without questioning the established order in life and religion. The world to her being home and family, she had a real, if gently expressed, horror of all that she instinctively felt to be subversive of this ideal. People judged her a little quiet, dull, and narrow; they compared her to a hen for ever clucking round her chicks. The streak of heroism that lay in her nature was not perhaps of patent order. Her feeling about her brother's situation however was sincere and not to be changed or comforted. She saw him in danger of being damaged in the only sense in which she could conceive of a man--as a husband and a father. It was this that went to her heart, though her piety proclaimed to her also the peril of his soul; for she shared the High Church view of the <b>indissolubility</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage.</b>|$|E

6000|$|A {{great number}} of people object to divorce under any {{circumstances}} whatever. This {{is the case with}} the orthodox Catholic and with the orthodox Positivist. And many religious and orthodox people carry their assertion of the <b>indissolubility</b> <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> to the grave; they demand that the widow or widower shall remain unmarried, faithful to the vows made at the altar until death comes to the release of the lonely survivor also. Re-marriage is regarded by such people as a posthumous bigamy. There is certainly a very strong and logical case to be made out for a marriage bond that is indissoluble even by death. It banishes step-parents from the world. It confers a dignity of tragic inevitability upon the association of husband and wife, and makes a love approach the gravest, most momentous thing in life. It banishes for ever any dream of escape from the presence and service of either party, or of any separation from the children of the union. It affords no alternative to [...] "making the best of it" [...] for either husband or wife; they have taken a step as irrevocable as suicide. And some logical minds would even go further, and have no law as between the members of a family, no rights, no private property within that limit. The family would be the social unit and the father its public representative, and though the law might intervene if he murdered or ill-used wife or children, or they him, it would do so in just the same spirit that it might prevent him from self-mutilation or attempted suicide, {{for the good of the}} State simply, and not to defend any supposed independence of the injured member. There is much, I assert, to be said for such a complete shutting up of the family from the interference of the law, and not the least among these reasons is the entire harmony of such a view with the passionate instincts of the natural man and woman in these matters. All unsophisticated human beings appear disposed to a fierce proprietorship in their children and their sexual partners, and in no respect is the ordinary mortal so easily induced to vehemence and violence.|$|E

He said: Is there no place at the Lord’s table for people who experienced and suffered an irreversible break in their lives? How perfect and holy must one be to be allowed to the supper of the Lord? It becomes clear to me every time that the question of allowing divorced and remarried people to the Eucharist is not in the first place a question about the <b>indissolubility</b> <b>of</b> the sacrament <b>of</b> <b>marriage....</b> Many people question the Church and her mercy in this regard.

40|$|In {{keeping in}} mind the {{required}} openness <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> towards procréation, the Vatican II Council and the Code of Canon Law of 1983 have described the conjugal union more by taking as starting point the spouses and the couple. This is the conséquence of a rather récent évolution of thought, which, although still very much western, is more attentive to other cultures. This is requiring that one distinguish better in the description <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> what is contingent because mainly cultural and what is of its nature more universal. The Code of Canon Law of 1983 maintains that in a marriage between baptised, one has to affirm the absolute identity between the matrimonial «contract» and the sacrament. This is not without causing some problems to those belonging to a Christian faith denying the sacramental nature <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> or <b>of</b> baptised catholics who, because of a formai act defected from the Church, are dispensed from the canonical form <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> (canon 1117). Moreover, {{the question of the}} faith required to hâve a valid sacrament is not without importance. The increase of divorces, the awareness of this growing phenomenon, the uneasiness in which certain remarried divorcées as well as the pastors they question live in, cause a disarray in front of the repeated affirmation <b>of</b> the absolute <b>indissolubility</b> <b>of</b> the consummated sacramental marriage. Maybe the power of the Church to dispense has not been studied sufficiently !

This article reviews evidence of the deterioration of families and of parenting in society, including rising cohabitation, increasing non-marital child-bearing, consistently high (and socially accepted) divorce, and growing single-parenting, with attendant high social cost, all indicating a need for laws that support indissoluble parenting.
