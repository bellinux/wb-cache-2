The REPORT BROADCAST function {{is intended to}} retrieve originated broadcast counts and the REPORT PHY BROADCAST COUNTS to retrieve received broadcast counts. This proposal suggests that retrieving all broadcast counters can be done efficiently with a single list based SMP function. Suggested changes 1. Remove the REPORT PHY BROADCAST COUNTS function and make its function code reserved. 2. Extend the REPORT BROADCAST function to return all originated and received broadcast counters, for a given type specified in the function request, in a descriptor list format.

40|$|Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) (Noctuidae: Lepidoptera), {{commonly}} known as legume pod borer, is a major insect pest of legume crops in the semi-arid tropics. A baculovirus of type nucleopolyhedrovirus (NPV) was isolated from this insect during natural epizootics at ICRISAT. Patancheru (Andhra Pradesh, India). Electron microscopic studies showed that the occlusion bodies (OBs) are in polyhedral shape and approximately 2 pin in diameter containing multiple nucelocapsids per envelope and purified virus particles revealed bacilliform tocylindrical shaped structures of size of 282 x 49 nm. In bioassays the virus on 2 nd and 3 '* instar H. arinligera larvae had LCs 0 values on 71 h day are 2. 30 x lo 4 and 1. 5 x lo 5 POBs/ml and LTsO values at virus con cent ratio^^ of 1. 8 x 10 ' POBsIml are 118. 80 and 133. 92 hr respectively. The virus yield was high in the fieldcollected larvae (5. 60 x lo 9 POBs/larva and/or 14. 01 x loy POBs/ml) than laboratory reared larvae (5. 02 x 109 POBs /larva and/or 12. 42 ~lo 9 P OBS/~Ib) u,t no variation in their virulence (LCs 0 values on 7 t' 1 day: 1. 79 x 105 and 1. 11 x lo 5 POBs/ml). Using a degenerate oligonucleotide primer set polyhedrin gene of the virus was amplified by PCR. This resulted in a 744 bp product w hich was cloned and sequenced. The nucleotide gene sequence had a high ho~nology with several NPVs, specifically with NPV from Mutnestra brassicue (97 %), Marnestra cor$gl~rura (97 %) and Leucariirl seperata (95 %) (Noctuidae: Lepidoptera) and these three viruses shared a unique restriction site for Xlzo-I enzyme at nucleotide position 130 (M. brossicae and M. cor?fi,purata) and at 670 (L. seperata). The phylogenetic analysis showed that the virus belongs to Group-I 1 NPVs and the virus was named as Helicoverpa arniigera N~~cleopolyhedorivrus (NPV), Patancheru strain. This is the 81 <b>h</b> <b>report</b> worldwide and first report from the Indian subcontinent to be described the complete polyhedrin gene of a NPV isolated from H. armigera.
