50|$|If {{the injury}} or damage affects a citizen within the {{territory}} of a state, it would be usual for that state to claim jurisdiction to protect the interests {{of those who are}} present within its borders. But X would not have taken any action within State B's borders, so the wording of the actus reus must permit a prosecution in this situation. The theoretical justification for this jurisdiction may be that X has intended to cause the loss or injury and so should not escape liability through the device of only seeking to deceive those resident outside State A (a strategy that would be very simple given the internet). The justification is less clear when the place of injury is an accident. Within a single state, the doctrine of transferred intent would apply to criminalise accidental departures from a planned attack, but if X's letter is redirected out of State A by one of Y's helpful relatives, the receipt of the letter by Y on holiday in State B is entirely outside X's actual intention (just it might be irrelevant to a sender where the recipient of an e-mail is resident). Alternatively, suppose that X physically attacks Y in State A, intending to kill him. Both are nationals of State A. Y is seriously injured and, because the hospitals in State B have a superior track record for treating injuries of this type, Y arranges to be transferred to State B where he later dies. Again, there is no causal connection between X's initial criminal acts and the territory of State B, and seeking to found jurisdiction simply on the ground that Y died within its borders, is not wholly convincing <b>given</b> <b>that</b> <b>Y</b> is not a national of State B and so neither owes allegiance nor is owed any duty of protection as a part of State B's social contract.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{greatest}} difficulties in astrophysics is {{the determination of the}} fundamental stellar parameters (FSPs), one of which is the initial mass fraction of helium (Y). However, <b>given</b> <b>that</b> <b>Y</b> can be measured spectroscopically in {{only a small percentage of}} stars, a linear relationship is assumed between Y and the mass fraction of metals (Z). This Y-Z relation is generally represented as Y=Yp+DY/DZxZ, with the value of the helium-to-metal enrichment ratio (DY/DZ) assumed as a constant. However, there is no fundamental reason for every star to have a Y value on a linear scale with Z. In this paper a method for determining the FSPs of nearby stars is presented that uses at the same time Mbol, Teff, and log g. One of these parameters is Y, which is used to determine the validity of the Y-Z relation. A new set of evolutionary tracks is created using the PGPUC stellar evolution code, which includes 7 masses (0. 5 <M/Msun< 1. 1), 7 helium abundances (0. 230 <Y< 0. 370), and 12 metallicities (1. 6 x 10 ^- 4 <Z< 6. 0 x 10 ^- 2) for solar-scaled chemical compositions ([alpha/Fe]= 0. 0). The suggested method is tested using two different spectroscopic databases of nearby main sequence stars with precise parallaxes, and spectroscopic measurements of [Fe/H], Teff and g. The proposed method is compared to other techniques used to determine the FSPs, where one assumes an age of 5 Gyr for all nearby stars. This comparison demonstrates that the hypothesis regarding constant age leads to an underestimation of the Y value, especially for low metallicities. In addition, the suggested method is limited to masses above 0. 60 Msun and requires high-precision measurements of spectroscopic surface gravities in order to obtain reliable results. Finally, estimating masses and ages assuming a Y-Z relation rather than a free Y value may induce average errors of approximately 0. 02 Msun and 2 Gyr, respectively.

30|$|Conclusion: To date, no {{quantitative}} PET {{measurement of}} the 90 Y microsphere LSF following radioembolization has been reported and no data are currently available comparing the pre-therapy MAA LSF and the post-therapy 90 Y microsphere LSF. One challenge {{is that there is}} no reference standard for estimating the LSF other than planar scintigraphic imaging of the chest and abdomen following the intra-arterial MAA administration. <b>Given</b> <b>that</b> 90 <b>Y</b> microsphere dosage is based upon the pre-therapy 99 mTc MAA LSF and that MAA particles are more variable in size (e.g., 10 - 90 microns) than 90 Y microspheres (20 - 35 microns), quantitative estimation of the post-therapy 90 Y microsphere LSF using dPET/CT approaches may have diagnostic and therapeutic impact by identifying patients with smaller or larger than anticipated LSFs. In particular, subsets of patients would be identified on post-therapy 90 <b>Y</b> PET imaging <b>that</b> may be eligible for additional radioembolization therapy (i.e., patients with 50 Gy cumulative lung dose). Routine estimates of 90 Y dPET LSF would also greatly increase our understanding of tumor-induced neovascularity and the degree of vascular shunting in various liver malignancies/metastases targeted by 90 Y radioembolization therapy.|$|R

40|$|A binary {{response}} {{model is}} a regression model in which the dependentvariable Y is a binary random variable that takes on only the values zeroand one. In many economic applications of this model, an agent makes a choice between two alternatives: for example, a commuter chooses {{to drive a car}} to work or to take public transport. Another example is the choice of a worker between taking a job or not. Driving to work and taking a job are choices <b>that</b> correspond to <b>Y</b> 5 1, and taking public transport and not taking a job to Y 5 0. The model <b>gives</b> the probability <b>that</b> <b>Y</b> 5 1 is chosen conditional on a set of explanatory variables. In the transportation example, common explanatory variables include the time and the cost of travel; in the worker example, common explanatory variables include age, education and experience. The econometric problem is to estimate the conditional probability <b>that</b> <b>Y</b> 5 1 considered {{as a function of the}} explanatory variables. The most commonly used approach, notably logit and probit models, assumes that the functional form of the dependence on the explanatory variables is known. The logit and probit models have been used almost exclusively in econometric applications in the leading journals. However, the functional form is seldom known in practice. If the functional form is misspecified, then the estimates of the coefficients and the inferences based on them can be highly misleading. It is possible to relax the restrictive assumption that the functional form is known by using either semiparametric or nonparametric models. In these types of models, the functional form is unknown.

40|$|Aim of study: To {{identify}} {{species of}} wood samples based on common names and anatomical analyses of their transversal surfaces (without microscopic preparations). Area of study: Spain and South America Material and methods: The test {{was carried out}} on a batch of 15 lumber samples deposited in the Royal Botanical Garden in Madrid, from the expedition by Ruiz and Pavon (1777 - 1811). The first stage of the methodology is to search {{and to make a}} critical analysis of the databases which list common nomenclature along with scientific nomenclature. A geographic filter was then applied to the information resulting from the samples with a more restricted distribution. Finally an anatomical verification was carried out with a pocket microscope with a magnification of x 40, equipped with a 50 micrometers resolution scale. Main results: The identification of the wood based exclusively on the common name is not useful due to the high number of alternative possibilities (14 for “naranjo”, 10 for “ébano”, etc.). The common name of one of the samples (“huachapelí mulato”) enabled the geographic origin of the samples to be accurately located to the shipyard area in Guayaquil (Ecuador). <b>Given</b> <b>that</b> Ruiz <b>y</b> Pavon did not travel to Ecuador, the specimens must have been obtained by Tafalla.
