5000|$|Hercules Computer Technology, Inc. {{was formed}} in 1982 in Hercules, California, by Van Suwannukul and Kevin Jenkins {{and was one of}} the major <b>graphics</b> <b>card</b> {{companies}} of the 1980s. Its biggest products were the MDA-compatible <b>Hercules</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Card</b> (HGC) and <b>Hercules</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Card</b> Plus (HGC+) and the associated standard, which was widely copied and survived into the 1990s. The <b>Hercules</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Card</b> included a [...] "Centronics compatible" [...] parallel printer port, the same as the IBM Monochrome Display and Printer Adapter board that the card was based on. The company also produced CGA compatible cards, and with the unsuccessful Hercules InColor Card, it tried to go head-to-head with EGA.|$|R

50|$|<b>Hercules</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Card</b> Plus is an 8-bit ISA card, {{containing}} the display controller and a printer port.|$|R
50|$|HBASIC is {{also the}} name for a BASIC {{interpreter}} created specifically for use with the <b>Hercules</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Card.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>Hercules</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Card</b> Plus (HGC+) (June 1986) allowed {{user-defined}} fonts called RAMFONT {{to be used}} in 80&times;25 text mode.|$|R
50|$|Like the IBM Monochrome Display Adapter it {{improved}} on, the <b>Hercules</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Card</b> {{had both}} a parallel printer port {{and a video}} output port.|$|R
50|$|After {{the success}} of the {{monochrome}} <b>Hercules</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Card</b> (HGC) and <b>Hercules</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Card</b> Plus (HGC+) which gained wide developer support, the market was changing with the release of new colour cards which were becoming increasingly affordable. So Hercules released the InColor to compete primarily with IBM's new high-end VGA card, and also the many existing EGA compatible cards on the market. The InColor did not bring the success that Hercules had hoped for, and revenue slowly declined until Hercules was eventually acquired by ELSA in August 1998 for $8.5m USD.|$|R
50|$|As {{part of its}} {{commercial}} packaging, the <b>Hercules</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Card</b> included a diskette with HBASIC, an interpreted version of the BASIC computer language that enabled programming graphics on a monochrome monitor.|$|R
50|$|A {{variant of}} the <b>Hercules</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Card</b> Plus with {{on-board}} TOPS/FlashTalk-compatible network adapter was available as Hercules Network Card Plus in 1988. Reportedly, the card also supports RAMFONT but lacks a printer port.|$|R
50|$|Buyers of <b>Hercules</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Cards</b> {{received}} a special version of GW-BASIC on the card's utility disk that was called HBASIC and which added support for its 720×348 monochrome graphics (other versions of BASICA/GW-BASIC only allowed <b>graphics</b> on <b>Hercules</b> <b>cards</b> if SIMCGA was loaded).|$|R

As {{can be seen from}} the PCB the layout was done in 1985, whereas the marking on the central chip CW16800-A says [...] "8639" [...] meaning that chip was {{manufactured}} week 39, 1986.|$|R
50|$|The {{graphics}} mode available were MDA, CGA, EGA, VGA and SVGA emulating <b>Hercules</b> <b>graphic</b> <b>cards</b> with 512 KiB to 2 MiB RAM, {{and up to}} 256 colors on Amiga AGA machines, and could make use of Amiga graphic boards (e.g. Cybergraphics, EGS Spectrum, Picasso).|$|R
50|$|It was {{intended}} to provide high resolution (at the time) monochrome graphic abilities to computers limited to text displays. It was aimed at the business market {{and one of the}} three first third party graphic boards for PCs (the others being Plantronics Colorplus and <b>Hercules</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Card).</b>|$|R
5000|$|Although it cited {{flaws in}} the {{hardware}} and software, BYTE called the <b>Hercules</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Card</b> [...] "a fine product" [...] that gave owners of monochrome monitors graphics capability. PC Magazine reported successfully running CGA-compatible games on a monochrome display, and using the card with a Columbia MPC.|$|R
50|$|The Z-100 had unusually good {{graphics}} for its era, {{superior to}} the contemporary CGA (640×200 monochrome bitmap or 320×200 4-color), IBM Monochrome Display Adapter (MDA) (80×25 text-only), and arguably even the <b>Hercules</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Card</b> (720×348 monochrome). Early versions of AutoCAD were released for the Z-100 because of these advanced graphics.|$|R
50|$|Although the PCW {{actually}} had excellent monochrome graphics support for its time and specification, closely {{comparable to the}} <b>Hercules</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Card</b> for the PC, Mallard BASIC had no graphics support whatsoever. Instead, Locomotive optimised it for business use, with, for instance, full ISAM random-access file support, {{making it easier to}} write database applications.|$|R
25|$|Electro Body {{was noted}} for its low system requirements. The game {{supported}} every video card on the Polish market, including the <b>Hercules</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Card,</b> CGA, EGA and VGA cards; it also supported numerous audio devices, including the PC speaker, Covox Speech Thing or the Sound Blaster. A special release of the game came with a Covox device included in the box.|$|R
50|$|The {{initial release}} of 1-2-3 {{supported}} only three video setups, CGA, MDA (in {{which case the}} graph maker was not available) or dual monitor mode. However, {{a few months later}} support was added for Hercules Computer Technology's <b>Hercules</b> <b>Graphics</b> Adapter which was a clone of the MDA that allowed bitmap mode. The ability to have high-resolution text and graphics capabilities (at the expense of color) proved extremely popular and Lotus 1-2-3 is credited with popularizing the <b>Hercules</b> <b>graphics</b> <b>card.</b>|$|R
25|$|VS {{connectivity}} was via an ISA based VS-terminal card, or via LightSpeed, the networked VS Terminal Emulator, over an IPX-based Ethernet connection. Originally the PC-240 {{came with}} a Wang specific <b>Hercules</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Card</b> and compatible screen, which also acted as a keyboard extension, meaning the base unit could be kept {{some distance from the}} screen. This was later replaced with an EGA card and screen.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Hercules</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Card</b> was {{developed}} in 1982 by Van Suwannukul, founder of Hercules Computer Technology. The system was created by Suwannukul initially {{so that he could}} work on his doctoral thesis on an IBM PC using the Thai alphabet, as Thai was his native language. In 1984, its list price was US$499, although it was often sold for less than the manufacturer's suggested price.|$|R

5000|$|Introduced in 1982, the non-IBM <b>Hercules</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Card</b> offers both an MDA {{compatible}} {{high resolution}} text mode and a monochrome graphics mode. It can address individual pixels, and display {{a black and}} white picture of 720&times;348 pixels. This resolution is better than even the highest monochrome resolution CGA cards can offer. Thus, even without a color capability of any kind, the Hercules adapter's offer of monochrome graphics without sacrificing MDA-equivalent text quality made it a more desirable choice for many.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Hercules</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Card</b> (HGC) is a {{computer}} graphics controller made by Hercules Computer Technology, Inc. that combines IBM's text-only MDA display standard with a bitmapped graphics mode. This allows the HGC to offer both high quality text and graphics from a single card. The HGC was very popular, and became a widely supported de facto display standard on IBM PC compatibles connected to a monochrome monitor. The HGC standard was used long after more technically capable systems had entered the market, especially on dual-monitor setups.|$|R
50|$|It only {{produced}} green colors {{because it}} used P39 phosphor. IBM designed its MDA monochrome display system to deliver extremely well-formed characters for the time. The monitor {{was meant to}} be hooked up to an IBM Monochrome Display Adapter which had no graphics modes at all, and only supported the 80 x 25 text mode, using 9 x 14 pixels per character. The <b>Hercules</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Card</b> had its resolution designed around this monitor, allowing cheap high-resolution PC graphics, and some people also used 5151 monitors with EGA boards for their mono modes.|$|R
50|$|The 5151 was {{designed}} {{to work with the}} PC's Monochrome Display Adapter (MDA) text-only <b>graphics</b> <b>card,</b> but the third-party <b>Hercules</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Card</b> became a popular companion to the 5151 screen because of the Hercules' comparatively high-resolution bitmapped 720×348 pixel monochrome graphics capability, much used for business presentation graphics generated from spreadsheets like Lotus 1-2-3. This was much higher resolution than the alternative IBM Color Graphics Adapter 320×200 pixel, or 640×200 pixel graphic standard. It could also run most programs written for the CGA <b>card's</b> standard <b>graphics</b> modes. Monochrome monitors continued to be used, even after the introduction of higher resolution color IBM Enhanced Graphics Adapter and Video Graphics Array standards in the late 1980s, for dual-monitor applications.|$|R
50|$|It {{had many}} strengths, but was {{regularly}} criticized in reviews over speed issues. Even before GUI environments like Windows, it pioneered treating the empty editing screen as a 'scratchpad', that is, {{a space that}} you could cursor into, placing a character or other entry anywhere at will on a printable page. In WordPerfect and Word, and virtually all other editors of that period, territory beyond the last character entered did not exist. When the <b>Hercules</b> <b>graphics</b> <b>card</b> became popular, Samna Word gained a Print Preview mode that was not editable, but showed font and format treatments.|$|R
5000|$|In 1982, the non-IBM <b>Hercules</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Card</b> (HGC) was introduced, {{the first}} {{third-party}} video card for the PC. In {{addition to an}} MDA-compatible text mode, it offered a monochrome graphics mode. With a resolution of 720&times;348 pixels, it had a higher resolution than that produced by CGA. The Hercules' combination of sharp monochrome text and graphics capabilities made it ideal for running software such as Lotus 1-2-3 that supported business graphics. Some games also had Hercules support, and most others {{could be made to}} work with HGC via SimCGA, a TSR which would reformat the CGA graphics memory to HGC format in the background.|$|R
5000|$|The IBM PC compatibles version {{released}} in 1990 {{is similar to}} the Mega Drive/Genesis version, but features richer 256 color palette in VGA mode as well as the ability to run in 16 colors (EGA/Tandy 1000), 4 color (CGA) and 2 color (<b>Hercules</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Card)</b> modes.The Atari ST and Amiga versions of the game {{released in}} late 1990 by Virgin Software are more similar to the arcade. Unlike the PC version, the Amiga version is not a port of the Genesis/Mega Drive version - rather, it {{is similar to the}} arcade game, with some palette changes and without parallax scrolling. [...] The ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64 versions suffer from the limitations of the two platforms.|$|R
50|$|Founded in 1983, Tseng Labs' {{first product}} was {{designed}} to allow IBM PCs to run the CP/M Operating System. When an OEM deal for that product was cancelled, TLI introduced a combination multifunction and graphics, called Ultrapak, which upgraded IBM PC and XT compatible computers with some features of an IBM AT. Ultrapak also foreshadowed Tseng Labs penchant for enhancing graphics - by providing IBM Monochrome Display Adapter (MDA) and <b>Hercules</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Card</b> (HGC) compatibility along with their own special 132 column text modes. These extended text modes created a successful niche for TLI - the cards were popularly used by corporations for PCs that also emulated mainframe terminals that displayed 132 columns. The UltraPAK Short (a graphics-only version of UltraPAK) was the base design for the DFI MG-150, which {{was reported to be}} the best selling MDA/HGC compatible card of all time.|$|R
50|$|TurboCAD was {{originally}} developed in South Africa by Hendrik Vermooten and Hein Oosthuizen. Initial hardware support {{was for a}} specific device configuration: <b>Hercules</b> monochrome <b>graphics</b> <b>cards,</b> HP7475 plotters with keyboard for data entry. The first version of TurboCAD fit on a single 360kb floppy disk {{so that it could}} run on the original IBM PC. The source code also fit on a single floppy disk along with the 30kb required by the “development environment”: Turbo Pascal 2.0.|$|R
50|$|The dual-monitor {{capability}} of the original Hercules card and its imitations (and some successors) came from its emulation of an MDA rather than a CGA. When IBM designed the original two cards for the PC, the MDA and the CGA, it assigned them different I/O and memory address ranges. This {{made it possible for}} both cards to be installed and operated in the same computer at the same time. Subsequent video hardware standards from IBM - the EGA and VGA - used the same I/O and memory address ranges as the CGA (optionally emulating an MDA in its address ranges or using an additional I/O and memory addresses not used by earlier cards). Therefore, an EGA or a VGA could replace a CGA and operate in color modes, but either could only replace an MDA, and operate alongside another color <b>graphics</b> <b>card,</b> if it was put into MDA-compatible mode, which gave no more display capability than the <b>Hercules</b> <b>graphics</b> <b>card.</b> Two color cards could not operate in color modes {{at the same time in}} a PC, PC XT, or PC AT. Therefore, the Hercules card (or, later, a much more expensive EGA operating in a configuration to essentially emulate the Hercules card) was the only way to produce two graphics displays on two monitors at the same time.|$|R
50|$|By the mid-1980s, {{computers}} had outgrown these video {{systems and}} needed better displays. The Apple IIgs {{suffered from the}} use of the old scanning method, with the highest display resolution being 640x200, resulting in a severely distorted tall narrow pixel shape, making the display of realistic proportioned images difficult. Solutions from various companies varied widely. Because PC monitor signals {{did not need to be}} broadcast, they could consume far more than the 6, 7 and 8 MHz of bandwidth that NTSC and PAL signals were confined to. IBM's Monochrome Display Adapter and Enhanced Graphics Adapter as well as the <b>Hercules</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Card</b> and the original Macintosh computer generated a video signal close to 350p. The Commodore Amiga created a true interlaced NTSC signal (as well as RGB variations). This ability resulted in the Amiga dominating the video production field until the mid-1990s, but the interlaced display mode caused flicker problems for more traditional PC applications where single-pixel detail is required. 1987 saw the introduction of VGA, on which PCs soon standardized, Apple only followed suit some years later with the Mac when the VGA standard was improved to match Apple's proprietary 24 bit color video standard also introduced in 1987.|$|R
