A new routing protocol based on the trust model is proposed and analysed in this article.

Then this trust model is integrated into the Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocol {{which is the most}} common on demand routing protocol used in MANET. In the proposed scheme the route is not {{selected on the basis of}} first arrival of RREP and waits till it gets the RREP from all neighboring nodes and decides the path to be routed based on the nature of Association between them. Thus the Greyhole nodes will be identified and will not be given preference in the route selection. The performance the proposed protocol is evaluated by comparing the simulation results of it with the standard DSR in presence of Greyhole nodes.

40|$|An ad hoc {{network is}} a {{collection}} of self-configured nodes that are dynamically and arbitrarily located in such a manner that the interconnections between nodes are capable of changing on a continual basis. In order to facilitate communication within the network, a routing protocol {{plays an important role in}} discovering and defining the routes between nodes. To date, a considerable amount of research effort has focused on the design of ad hoc network routing protocols. However, relatively little of this work examines the stability of routes in such networks. There are several reasons to believe that the routes in ad hoc networks will be unstable. One reason is that the majority of routing messages are broadcast packets which tend to be unreliable and have lower service quality at lower layer. The routing traffic usually shares resources such as bandwidth and buffer space with data traffic. The data traffic constitutes a larger portion of traffic mix. Furthermore, data traffic comprises mostly of unicast transmission because it offers more reliable delivery and higher service quality for user applications. Thus, the routing packets will suffer from a higher degree of loss when a network contains both routing and data traffic. The loss of routing packets can cause peering sessions to fail and consequently leads to routing instabilities. Due to the layered network architecture, the routing protocol designs often overlook any severe packet loss that is induced not only by the surrounding wireless traffic but also by their own traffic. Therefore, the communication link quality varies significantly even in a static network topology. This dissertation examines the stability and robustness properties of ad hoc routing protocols when the routing control traffic is not isolated from data traffic. The research begins with an analytical model to examine the subtle interactions between delivery of routing (broadcast) and data (unicast) packets in wireless networks. The model highlights the deficiencies of existing MAC protocols in delivering routing packets in congested networks, which can be detrimental for the routing protocols. The study continues with simulation study of routing behaviour in such condition. Two representative routing protocols, Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) and Optimised Link State Routing (OLSR), are chosen to examine the stability performance of reactive and proactive routing protocols respectively. Through a series of analytical and simulation studies, this study identifies a number of routing pathologies for both reactive (AODV) and proactive (OLSR) routing protocols. Three different approaches have been proposed to address routing instabilities from different network layers. The first approach presents Out-of-Band Routing (OBR) which evaluates the feasibility of <b>isolating</b> <b>routing</b> and data traffic using different radio interfaces. OBR ensures that a channel is used exclusively for routing traffic to reduce the chance of losing important routing packets. Through extensive simulations, OBR is shown to improve the stability of end-to-end sessions by 30 % for AODV and 50 % for OLSR in a congested network. The second approach aims to improve the stability of AODV by exploiting the interaction between routing and underlying MAC protocols. Two protocol techniques known as Adaptive Bulk Trigger (ABT) and Dynamic Window Selection (DWS) are proposed to tolerate a small amount of packet loss and assign higher priority to nodes with critical routing demand. Simulation results show that combining ABT and DWS increases the duration of end-to-end sessions by 30 % while reducing route recovery latency by 50 % in a congested scenario. The third and final approach introduces Optimised Link State Routing with Reactive Route Repair (OLSR-R 3). The reactive route repair compliments the traditional OLSR protocol by providing reactive routing when routing packets are lost. Simulation results show OLSR-R 3 improves the end-to-end session duration by 30 % and reduces the route recovery latency by 20 % over OLSR by avoiding the erratic routing behaviour caused by incomplete link-state knowledge...|$|R

It is an impartial network where nodes {{communicate with each}} other without the need of any additional resources and move randomly thus forming a dynamic topology. Nodes are often susceptible to failure thus making mobile ad hoc networks open to threats and attacks. In MANET routing relies on mutual trust between the participating nodes but the characteristics of MANET make this tough. Nodes accept to participate in routing but fail to do so where in they misbehave and start dropping packets during the transmission. Such nodes are responsible for untrustworthy routing.

Mobile ad hoc networks consist of nodes that cooperate to provide connectivity and are free to move and organize randomly. Every node is router or an end host, in general autonomous and should be capable of routing traffic as destination nodes sometimes might be out of range. Nodes are mobile since topology is very dynamic and they have limited energy and computing resources. These nodes are often vulnerable to failure thus making mobile ad hoc networks open to threats and attacks. Communication in MANET relies on mutual trust between the participating nodes but the features of MANET make this hard. Nodes sometimes fail to transmit and start dropping packets during the transmission. Such nodes are responsible for untrustworthy routing. Nodes should also be considered for sufficient energy levels to make transmission. A secured scheme can be used to track these untrustworthy nodes and <b>isolate</b> them from <b>routing,</b> thus provide trustworthiness. In this paper a secured and energy based AODV (SE-AODV) protocol is presented which implements a message digest algorithm for every transmission. Energy is introduced and nodes are considered for routing only if they have energy level higher than the threshold (Average energy value of nodes considered for routing).

40|$|A mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) is a {{peer-to-peer}} {{wireless network}} where nodes {{can communicate with}} each other without the use of infrastructure such as access points or base stations. These networks are self-configuring, capable of self-directed operation and hastily deployable. Nodes cooperate to provide connectivity, operates without centralized administration. Nodes are itinerant, topology can be very dynamic and nodes must be able to relay traffic since communicating nodes might be out of range. The dynamic nature of MANET makes network open to attacks and unreliability. Routing is always the most significant part for any networks. Each node should not only work for itself, but should be cooperative with other nodes. Node misbehaviour due to selfish or malicious intention could significantly degrade the performance of MANET. The Qos parameters like PDR, throughput and delay are affected directly due to such misbehaving nodes. We focus on trust management framework, which is intended to cope with misbehaviour problem of node and increase the performance of MANETs. A trust-based system can be used to track this misbehaving of nodes, spot them and <b>isolate</b> them from <b>routing</b> and provide reliability. In this paper a Trust Based Reliable AODV [TBRAODV] protocol is presented which implements a trust value for each node. For every node trust value is calculated and based trust value nodes are allowed to participate in routing or else identified to become a misbehaving node. This enhances reliability in AODV routing and results in increase of PDR, decrease in delay and throughput is maintained. This work is implemented and simulated on NS- 2.

30|$|In MANETs, trust can {{be defined}} as to what extent a node can fulfill the {{expectations}} of other node(s) as per the specification of an underlying communication protocol [11]. In trust-based security schemes, each node within the network manages an independent trust table to compute and store the trust values of other nodes. The routing decisions are based on the computed trust values of the nodes. Although a lot of research work has been carried in the field of trust and reputation based systems in MANETs, however, almost all the proposed schemes suffer from one basic problem known as bootstrapping problem [12]. It refers to the time required by the trust-based scheme to build trust and reputation among nodes in the network. Such delay in accumulation of trust and reputation is often not acceptable in time-critical applications. Due to the slow trust building process, a misbehaving node may have more opportunities to drop packets before being detected as malicious. One of the basic reasons for the aforementioned bootstrapping problem is that in most of the trust-based security schemes, an evaluated node’s trust is computed based on a single trust attribute, such as data forwarding [13 – 17]. Moreover, using single trust attribute may not effectively deal with the problem of selective misbehavior [12]. A smart malicious node may misbehave in the context of one network function and behave properly for other network functions. For example, a node may misbehave in the context of data forwarding while demonstrating good behavior when dealing with the control packet forwarding. As the existing schemes [7 – 10, 13 – 17] use single trust attribute, the aforementioned selective misbehaving node is declared as malicious node and <b>isolated</b> from the <b>routing</b> path, hence no longer will be available to be used for other network functions.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} {{the integration of the}} Household Activity Pattern Problem (HAPP) with various locational decisions considering both supply and demand sides. We present several methods to merge these two distinct areas—transportation infrastructure and travel demand procedures—into an integrated framework that has been previously exogenously linked by feedback or equilibrium processes. From the demand side, travel demand for non-primary activities is derived from the destination choices that a traveler makes that minimizes travel disutility within the context of considerations of daily scheduling and routing. From the supply side, the network decisions are determined as an integral function of travel demand rather than a given fixed OD matrix. First, the Location Selection Problem for the Household Activity Pattern Problem (LSP-HAPP) is developed. LSP-HAPP extends the HAPP by adding the capability to make destination choices simultaneously with other travel decisions of household activity allocation, activity sequence, and departure time. Instead of giving a set of pre-fixed activity locations to visit, LSPxviii HAPP chooses the location for certain activity types given a set of candidate locations. A dynamic programming algorithm is adopted and further developed for LSP-HAPP {{in order to deal with}} the choices among a sizable number of candidate locations within the HAPP modeling structure. Potential applications of synthetic pattern generation based on LSP-HAPP formulation are also presented. Second, the Location – Household Activity Pattern Problem (Location-HAPP), a facility location problem with full-day scheduling and routing considerations is developed. This is in the category of Location-Routing Problems (LRPs), where the decisions of facility location models are influenced by possible vehicle routings. Location-HAPP takes the set covering model as a location strategy, and HAPP as the scheduling and routing tool. The proposed formulation <b>isolates</b> each vehicle’s <b>routing</b> problem from those of other vehicles and from the master set covering problem. A modified column generation that uses a search method to find a column with a negative reduced price is proposed. Third, the Network Design Problem is integrated with the Household Activity Pattern Problem (NDP-HAPP) as a bilevel optimization problem. The bilevel structure includes an upper level network design while the lower level includes a set of disaggregate household itinerary optimization problems, posed as HAPP or LSP-HAPP. The output of upper level NDP (level-ofservice of the transportation network) becomes input data for the lower level HAPP that generates travel demand which becomes the input for the NDP. This is advantageous over the conventional NDP that outputs the best set of links to invest in, given an assumed OD matrix. Because the proposed NDP-HAPP can output the same best set of links, a new OD matrix and a detailed temporal distribution of activity participation and travel are created. A decomposed xix heuristic solution algorithm that represents each decision makers’ rationale shows optimality gaps of as much as 5 % compared to exact solutions when tested with small examples. Utilizing the aforementioned models, two transportation sustainability studies are then conducted for the adoption of Alternative Fuel Vehicles (AFVs). The challenges in adopting AFVs are directly related to the transportation infrastructure problems since the initial AFV refueling locations will need to provide comparable convenient travel experience for the early adopters when compared to the already matured gasoline fuel based transportation infrastructure. This work demonstrates the significance of the integration between travel demand model and infrastructure problems, but also draws insightful policy measurements regarding AFV adoption. The first application study attempts to measure the household inconvenience level of operating AFVs. Two different scenarios are examined from two behavioral assumptions – keeping currently reported pattern and minimizing the inconvenience cost through HAPPR or HAPPC. From these patterns, the personal or household inconvenience level is derived as compared to the original pattern, providing quantified data on how the public sector would compensate for the increases in travel disutility to ultimately encourage the attractiveness of AFVs. From the supply side of the AFV infrastructure, Location-HAPP is applied to the incubation of the minimum refueling infrastructure required to support early adoption of Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles (HFCVs). One of the early adoption communities targeted by auto manufacturers is chosen as the study area, and then three different values of accessibility are tested and measured in terms of tolerances to added travel time. Under optimal conditions, refueling trips are found to be toured with other activities. More importantly, there is evidence xx that excluding such vehicle-infrastructure interactions as well as routing and scheduling interactions can result in over-estimation of minimum facility requirement...|$|R
