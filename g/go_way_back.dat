Some of our folksong exponents seem to think you have to <b>go</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> in the hills and drag out the worst singer in the world before it's authentic. Now, this is nonsense...Just because he's old and got three arthritic fingers and two strings left on the banjo doesn't prove anything." ...|$|E

Multiple carburetion had been with Pontiac since 1956 starting with 2X4 bbls. and Pontiac's famous Tri-Power (3X2bbls.) since 1957. Ironically the only GM cars to escape this ban was Ed Cole's beloved Corvair and Corvette. There are scores of this conflict with Ed Cole that <b>go</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> to Bunkie Knudsen.
