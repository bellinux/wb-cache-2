40|$|<b>Green</b> {{political}} <b>parties</b> {{are traditionally}} known {{to strive for}} radical systematic change {{in favor of the}} environment. The radical demands might limit the voter support and consequently the possibility of coalition collaborations. However, <b>Green</b> <b>parties</b> have permanently established themselves in various parliaments throughout Europe. This thesis argues that an ideological transformation has occurred, which enables <b>Green</b> <b>parties</b> to increase parliamentary policy influence. Moreover, the study has a mixed methods approach. The quantitative research is conducted on all well established European <b>Green</b> <b>parties,</b> followed by qualitative case studies on three specific <b>Green</b> <b>parties.</b> The hypothesis implies that the internal ideological transformation can be explained as a shift from traditional Ecologism towards Ecological Modernization. By conducting ideal type analysis on the cases selected, the study finds support for the hypothesis, and an ideological transformation can be confirmed. The results are discussed and a potential reason for the transformation is found to be the strive for increased policy influence. However, further research is needed in order to confirm this hypothesis...|$|R
