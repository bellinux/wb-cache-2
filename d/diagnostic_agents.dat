50|$|Boranophosphates are {{synthetic}} {{modifications of}} nucleosides being studied as potential therapeutic and <b>diagnostic</b> <b>agents.</b> They were first {{developed in the}} laboratories of Barbara Ramsay Shaw. The boranophosphate resembles the normal phosphate in that the negative charge is retained; however, the polarity of the molecule changes because the negative charge is localized on the remaining non-bridging oxygen. Partitioning experiments have demonstrated that boranophosphates are more lipophilic than normal phosphates; this could allow for increased cellular uptake and targeted delivery. In addition, boranophosphates have increased nuclease resistance without affecting activation of RNase H cleavage of RNA in RNA:boranophosphate hybrids.|$|E

50|$|Although the EPA {{does not}} require testing for {{pharmaceuticals}} and personal care products (PPCP)s in drinking water, the Portland Water Bureau monitors the Bull Run and groundwater supplies for their presence. PPCPs include prescription and non-prescription drugs for humans, veterinary drugs, vitamins, cosmetics, <b>diagnostic</b> <b>agents,</b> and other personal-care or pharmaceutical chemicals. When the Bull Run water was first tested for PPCPs in August 2006, the water bureau found an extremely low level, 9.2 parts per trillion of caffeine. Regulated contaminants are generally measured in parts per billion, which is a thousand times larger than parts per trillion. Tests of the groundwater in October 2007 found extremely low levels (25 parts per trillion or less) of acetaminophen, caffeine, ibuprofen, and sulfamethoxazole. Testing in April and May 2008 found no PPCPs in the Bull Run supply and trace amounts (18 parts per trillion or less) of estradiol and ethinylestradiol in the groundwater supply. In August and November 2008, tests found no PPCPs in the groundwater supply.|$|E
