Although the first images appeared to be sharper than those of ground-based telescopes, Hubble failed to achieve a final sharp focus and the best image quality obtained was drastically lower than expected.

In this paper, we use a probabilistic approach to design an Equal-Leaves Spring (ELS) by verifying the <b>design</b> <b>criterion</b> for a given reliability that allows introducing design conservator diagrams for several ELS characteristics. The reliability of the design is determined using the performance function with Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS). In addition, we study the effect of each parameter expressing the <b>design</b> <b>criterion</b> of such a spring and we also study the interaction between these parameters using the Design of Experiment method (DoE).

The hull design was simplified and {{shorter than the}} Fubukis, partly due {{to a reduction in}} the number of boilers, which itself resulted in a significant reduction in speed. The heretofore standard six 5inch, 50 calibre weapons were replaced by three Type 89 5inch/40 calibre guns which performed better than its predecessor in an AA role. The enclosed turrets were also replaced by a forward single open shield and an aft twin open mounting. This major redesign delivered a significantly smaller ship (1,280 tons). A number of the class were modified to transport kaiten.|$|E

25|$|Utilising and {{capturing}} the picturesque {{of the landscape}} was essential {{to the success of}} the Griffins’ design and was achieved by integrating the territory's topography into their design rather than designing to avoid it. An example of this is the Molonglo valley, which was utilised as a position for an artificial, grand central lake which satisfied part of the <b>design</b> <b>criteria</b> (Lake Burley Griffin). With respect to {{capturing the}} picturesque, the Griffin's lake centrepiece was a selling point of their design. It is likely that the Griffins were familiar with, and influenced by, the work of fellow Chicagoan Daniel Burnham, whose 1909 Plan of Chicago, also known as the Burnham Plan, focussed on reclaiming and improving Chicago's lakefront for public enjoyment.|$|E

25|$|Once {{inserted}} into a TEM, the sample {{has to be}} manipulated to locate the region {{of interest to the}} beam, such as in single grain diffraction, in a specific orientation. To accommodate this, the TEM stage allows movement of the sample in the XY plane, Z height adjustment, and commonly a single tilt direction parallel to the axis of side entry bolders. Sample rotation may be available on specialized diffraction holders and stages. Some modern TEMs provide the ability for two orthogonal tilt angles of movement with specialized holder designs called double-tilt sample holders. Some stage designs, such as top-entry or vertical insertion stages once common for high resolution TEM studies, may simply only have X-Y translation available. The <b>design</b> <b>criteria</b> of TEM stages are complex, owing to the simultaneous requirements of mechanical and electron-optical constraints and specialized models are available for different methods.|$|E
25|$|On August 26, 2003, the CAIB {{issued its}} {{report on the}} accident. The report {{confirmed}} the immediate cause of the accident was a breach in {{the leading edge of}} the left wing, caused by insulating foam shed during launch. The report also delved deeply into the underlying organizational and cultural issues that led to the accident. The report was highly critical of NASA's decision-making and risk-assessment processes. It concluded the organizational structure and processes were sufficiently flawed and that a compromise of safety was expected no matter who was in the key decision-making positions. An example was the position of Shuttle Program Manager, where one individual was responsible for achieving safe, timely launches and acceptable costs, which are often conflicting goals. The CAIB report found that NASA had accepted deviations from <b>design</b> <b>criteria</b> as normal when they happened on several flights and did not lead to mission-compromising consequences. One of those was the conflict between a design specification stating that the thermal protection system was not designed to withstand significant impacts and the common occurrence of impact damage to it during flight. The board made recommendations for significant changes in processes and organizational culture.|$|E
25|$|The DH.6 was {{specifically}} {{designed as a}} military trainer, {{at a time when}} it was usual for obsolete service types to be used in this role. Geoffrey de Havilland seems to have had two <b>design</b> <b>criteria</b> in mind. The first was that it should be inexpensive and easy to build, and above all, simple to repair after the mishaps common in training units. The top and bottom wings were square-cut and interchangeable, hence roundels often located in unusual positions. They were heavily cambered, and braced with cables rather than streamlined wires. On the original version of the type there was no stagger. Even the fin and rudder, on the prototype of the usual curved de Havilland outline, were cut square on production machines. The fuselage structure was a straight box with no attempt at refinement of outline – instructor and pupil sat in tandem on basketwork seats in a single cockpit, spartan even by the standards of the time. The standard engine was the readily-available 90hp (67kW) RAF 1a. Because of its use in the B.E.2 the engine was familiar to RFC mechanics. No cowling was used, and upswept straight exhaust pipes were fitted. When stocks of the RAF 1a ran short, other engines were fitted, including the 80hp (60kW) Renault.|$|E
