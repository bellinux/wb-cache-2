40|$|Severe acute {{respiratory}} syndrome (SARS) {{has been}} described as the first major emerging infectious disease of the twenty-first century. Having initially emerged, almost unnoticed, in southern China, it rapidly spread across the globe. It severely tested national public health and health systems.

The UK mounted a vigorous public health response.

40|$|Since {{transportation}} systems, especially air transportation, {{have the}} potential to spread infectious diseases (e. g.

The three objectives are: (1) to provide the necessary background regarding the diseases and screening technologies, (2) to create models of an air transportation network in a simulation software, and (3) to conduct simulation experiments, analyze and interpret the results including the formulation of recommendations for decision makers. ^ In {{the first part of the}} thesis, several infectious diseases are described, as well as the health screening methods and procedures. In the second part, four simulation models are developed. In the third part, the experimental results are presented and, based on them, several recommendations are provided. ^ The research showed that from the global perspective, <b>exit</b> <b>screening</b> in the affected countries is the most important measure in order to slow down the spread of an infectious disease.

40|$|Background: The WHO {{declared}} the 2014 west African Ebola epidemic {{a public health}} emergency of international concern in view of its potential for further international spread. Decision makers worldwide {{are in need of}} empirical data to inform and implement emergency response measures. Our aim was to assess the potential for Ebola virus to spread across international borders via commercial air travel and assess the relative efficiency of exit versus entry screening of travellers at commercial airports. Methods: We analysed International Air Transport Association data for worldwide flight schedules between Sept 1, 2014, and Dec 31, 2014, and historic traveller flight itinerary data from 2013 to describe expected global population movements via commercial air travel out of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Coupled with Ebola virus surveillance data, we modelled the expected number of internationally exported Ebola virus infections, the potential effect of air travel restrictions, and the efficiency of airport-based traveller screening at international ports of entry and exit. We deemed individuals initiating travel from any domestic or international airport within these three countries to have possible exposure to Ebola virus. We deemed all other travellers to have no significant risk of exposure to Ebola virus. Findings: Based on epidemic conditions and international flight restrictions to and from Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone as of Sept 1, 2014 (reductions in passenger seats by 51 % for Liberia, 66 % for Guinea, and 85 % for Sierra Leone), our model projects 2 · 8 travellers infected with Ebola virus departing the above three countries via commercial flights, on average, every month. 91 ? 547 (64 %) of all air travellers departing Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone had expected destinations in low-income and lower-middle-income countries. Screening international travellers departing three airports would enable health assessments of all travellers at highest risk of exposure to Ebola virus infection.

Common types are BACK, <b>EXIT,</b> ITEM, <b>SCREEN.</b> The idea of the command abstraction is to make applications more portable across various mobile devices. Application developers should use the command types properly to indicate the purpose of an operation, and device implementation then places the operation to the common location for a given type in a device's specific user interface style. This may be e.g. a specific key, like [...] "a back navigation key" [...] for BACK commands or a button on screen.|$|R
