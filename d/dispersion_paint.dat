40|$|The {{level and}} {{fluctuations}} of indoor humidity {{plays an important}} role for the indoor air qual-ity. The buffering effect of the internal surfaces in the building has been more emphasized lately. This study focus on the buffering effects for short time periods (hours, days) since the surface materials at this time scale may play a significant role. The objective is to determine the time-dependent moisture properties of plasterboard for indoor use and the different layers of a <b>dispersion</b> <b>paint</b> surface coating system. The effect of moistening and drying is studied in the interval RH 33 – 54 % (+ 20 °C). The surfaces step-response was determined through a gra-vimetrical method while the sample was in a well-defined relative humidity (RH). Calculated values for the moisture capacity, ξ, together with an evaluation of the experimental data are presented. The experimental results have a satisfying agreement compared with the calcula-tions...|$|E

40|$|Environmental {{considerations}} {{are becoming increasingly}} important in the decision making process of consumers and producers. A credible environmental label can only be established if it is issued by a neutral or state organisation {{on the basis of}} scientifically derived criteria. This holds true for the Blue Angel issued by the German Institute for Quality Control and Designation e. V. (RAL, Deutsches Institut f G und Kennzeichnungen). A growing number of environmental labels are being introduced through internal declarations of single companies or groups choosing their own criteria. The credibility of such declarations, in the opinion of consumers, is generally slight. A case study of <b>dispersion</b> <b>paints</b> labelled with the Blue Angel indicates that environmental consciousness of' consumers can, {{with the help of a}} credible environmental label be transformed into higher market penetration of a labelled product. Proce differences between labelled and competing non-labelled products should be moderate, as in general the willingness to pay more for an environmentally friendly product is not pronounced. Applying the results of the case study on <b>dispersion</b> <b>paints</b> to other products is restricted by the fact that consumers are not necessarily as directly affected by negative environmental effects of these products as they are by the toxic fumes emitted by paints containing solvents. Given a less significant direct effect on consumers, the sales and price dynamics should be lower than the behaviour observed for <b>dispersion</b> <b>paints...</b>|$|R
30|$|Information on the {{investigated}} {{treated articles}} and active substances {{is given in}} Tables  1 and 2. The paints were all waterborne and either based on acrylates (paint A and C) or polymer <b>dispersions</b> (<b>paint</b> B). Paints A and B are the paints for wood, whereas paint C is a roof paint. Mixtures of active substances were added to commercially available paints by producers {{according to the requirements}} of this study. Therefore, liquid formulations were used although a number of modern paints now contain microencapsulated active substances. The textile was treated in an industrial procedure by the producer using an impregnation material that contains biocides. The contents of the active substances were confirmed by chemical analysis of the product.|$|R

During the following ten years the production of Herbig-Haarhaus expanded. New branches in Würzburg and Switzerland were commissioned. In 1955 Hans Herbig died; {{for the first time}} no bearer of the traditional name Herbig was to be found. During the next three years Erich Zschocke informed the company. The collection of the passionate fancier of hand-painted porcelain and varnished objects, together with the collection of Kurt Herberts, later {{paved the way for the}} collection of the Museum für Lackkunst (Museum for Lacquer Art) in Münster. In 1957 the Herbol-logo was redesigned by the American designer Raymond Loewy (Coca-Cola bottle, Lucky Strike). It showed the Herbol lettering within a paintbrush.|$|R

40|$|The {{photocatalytic}} {{effect of}} TiO 2 has {{great potential for}} the disinfection of surfaces. Most studies {{reported in the literature}} use UV activation of TiO 2, while visible light has been used only in a few applications. In these studies, high concentrations of TiO 2, which can compromise surface properties, have been used. In this work, we have developed an acrylic-water <b>paint</b> <b>dispersion</b> containing low TiO 2 content (2 vol %) for the inactivation of microorganisms involved in hospital-acquired infections. The nanoparticles and the coating have been characterized using spectroscopic techniques and transmission electron microscopy, showing their homogenous dispersion in the acrylic urethane coating. A common fluorescent light source was used to activate the photocatalytic activity of TiO 2. The <b>paint</b> <b>dispersion</b> showed antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The coating containing the TiO 2 nanoparticles maintained good UV stability, strong adhesion to the substrate and high hardness.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} the materials flow of three substances (or groups thereof) for which endocrine (estrogenic) activity {{has been demonstrated}} in vitro {{and in some cases}} in vivo: bisphenol A (BPA); dibutyl phthalate (DBP) or benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP); and nonylphenol (NP) or alkylphenol ethoxylates (APEO). The study addresses the production and domestic consumption (for further processing and in final products) of these three chemicals/groups in Germany in 1995, taking account of imports/exports, and also the pathways for release and disposal. The data acquired is used to assess emission paths and volumes of potential environmental relevance. Production volume: BPA 210, 000 tonnes, DBP/BBP 30, 600 tonnes, NP 23, 100 tonnes. Principal applications: BPA almost exclusiveley as a pre-product for polycarbonate (70 %) and epoxy resins (30 %). DBP/BBP as softening agents, two thirds for PVC but also <b>dispersions,</b> <b>paints,</b> adhesives (DBP) and polysulphide sealant et al. (BBP) Np over 80 % pre-product for APEO, remainder for phenol resins et al. Emissions: Production sites are not the main factor, but rather products which contain these substances/groups in unconverted form and as additives or else in compounds from which they are readily released (NP from APEO). The annual emissions 'identifiable' within the study amount to less then 20 tonnes for BPA. They are estimated at 500 - 800 tonnes for DBP/BBP, and over 200 tonnes for NP. (orig.)

50|$|Anionic {{surfactants}} such as {{sodium dodecyl sulfate}} {{are most}} commonly used for stabilizing emulsions because of their affinity for hydrogen bonding with the aqueous medium. Nonionic surfactants are rarely used alone due to their inferior efficiency in creating stable emulsions in comparison to anionic surfactants. Because of this, non-ionic surfactants are usually used in tandem with anionic surfactants and impart a second method of colloidal stabilization through steric interference of the van der Waals forces amid polymer and pigment particles. Latexes that require stability over large pH ranges use larger nonionic to anionic surfactant ratios. Cationic surfactants are least commonly used because of their high cost, inefficient emulsifying capability, and undesirable effects on initiator decomposition. High speed application, low temperature storage, shear stresses from pumping, and other extreme storage or application conditions can cause {{the failure of a}} surfactant to adequately stabilize a <b>paint</b> <b>dispersion.</b>|$|R
40|$|Drying {{and aging}} <b>paint</b> <b>dispersions</b> display {{a wealth of}} complex {{phenomena}} that make their study fascinating yet challenging. To meet the growing demand for sustainable, high-quality paints, {{it is essential to}} unravel the microscopic mechanisms underlying these phenomena. Visualising the governing dynamics is, however, intrinsically difficult because the dynamics are typically heterogeneous and span a wide range of time scales. Moreover, the high turbidity of paints precludes conventional imaging techniques from reaching deep inside the paint. To address these challenges, we apply a scattering technique, Laser Speckle Imaging, as a versatile and quantitative tool to elucidate the internal dynamics, with microscopic resolution and spanning seven decades of time. We present a toolbox of data analysis and image processing methods that allows a tailored investigation of virtually any turbid dispersion, regardless of the geometry and substrate. Using these tools we watch a variety of paints dry and age with unprecedented detail. </p...|$|R
40|$|Paint-gun {{injuries}} are notoriously disabling, far {{more so than}} those caused by other foreign materials as they carry a high morbidity rate. Forty-three cases of high pressure injection injury due to paint-guns {{have been reported in}} the English literature. The four new cases reported here reflect the ffects of injury by the epoxy resins, relatively recently introduced and widely used in heavy industry. The <b>dispersion</b> f the <b>paint</b> is determined by the volume and the injection pressure (Kaufman, 1966, 1968 a & b). To this should be added the elasticity of the tissue and the viscosity of the paint as shown by this study. The more viscous the paint, he less the dispersion. The high morbidity rate of the paint-gun injury is therefore attributable to he severe compression of the tissues. The resultant severe compression of neurovascular bundles of the digit leads to neurovascular compromise. This explains the striking absence of pain soon after th...|$|R
40|$|Red, {{green and}} blue paints were {{prepared}} for use as thickness insensitive spectrally selective (TISS) paint coatings for solar façade absorbers. The paints were composed of a polyurethane resin binder in which various pigments were incorporated {{in such a way}} that they formed stable <b>paint</b> <b>dispersions,</b> satisfying stability criteria for façade coatings. A low emittance of the paints was achieved by using low-emittance aluminium flake pigments combined with iron oxide (red coloured paints). Black pigment was added to adjust solar absorptance. Blue and green paints were made by the addition of coloured aluminium flake pigment and the solar absorptance was also adjusted by the addition of black pigment. Efficiency for photo-thermal conversion of solar radiation was assessed by evaluation of the corresponding performance criteria, which enabled the selection of paints whose performance criteria values were higher than 0 (spectrally non-selective black coating). The results confirmed that blue and green paints and to minor extent red ones, combined selectivity with colour. The morphology of the paints was assessed, revealing that the colours originated from the deposition of finely dispersed colour and/or black pigment on the surface of the aluminium flakes during paint preparation...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{dispersion}} of an initially packed, static granular bed by the injection of a liquid jet. This is a relevant system for many industrial applications, including <b>paint</b> <b>dispersion</b> or food powder dissolution. Both decompaction and dispersion of the powder {{are not fully}} understood, leading to inefficiencies in these processes. Here we consider a model problem where the liquid jet is injected below a granular bed contained in a cylindrical cell. Two different initial conditions are considered: a two-phase case where the bed is initially fully immersed in the liquid and a three-phase case where the bed and cell are completely dry preceding the injection of the liquid. The focus of this contribution is the simulation of these model problems using a two-way coupled SPH-DEM granularliquid method [M. Robinson, M. Ramaioli, and S. Luding, submitted (2013) and [URL] (2013) ]. This is a purely particle-based method without any prescribed mesh, well suited for this and other problems involving a free (liquidgas) surface and a partly immersed particle phase.

40|$|The {{application}} properties of paints such as spreading and levelling properties, film thickness, sedimentation tendency and pigment stability {{are determined by}} the paint rheological behaviour. Sufficiently shear thinning, thixotropic paints with a yield point have, as a rule, suitable {{application properties}}. If the paint does not exhibit the required properties, its rheological behaviour may be improved using a proper type of rheological additive. In this work, the rheological properties of an acrylic <b>paint</b> (<b>dispersion</b> of TiO 2 in a solution of acrylate copolymers), which behaves as a Newtonian liquid, have been modified using three different types of commercial additives. To evaluate the influence of additive adjuction, the flow curves, yield point, oscillation tests, and creep and recovery tests have been measured for the paint samples on the dynamic rheometer RS 150 (Haake). It has been found out that the modified paints show shear thinning behaviour with a yield point and thixotropy. At the same time, they behave as viscoelastic liquids with different portion of elastic component of deformation at shear stresses {{in the vicinity of the}} yield point. The additive Byk 410 has been evaluated as the most efficient type of rheological additive. Its addition to the basic paint is easy and the paint samples modified with this additive exhibit the most suitable rheological properties...|$|R
40|$|The {{replacement}} of solvent containing systems by pure waterborne aqueous dispersions {{is an important}} challenge of technical development. Nevertheless {{the investigation of the}} film formation process is still an object of scientific work with controversial discussions about mechanisms even for simple latex systems. Therefore, the aim of this project was the research of film formation process for polymer dispersions (latices) based on industrial systems with Poly(vinyl acetate), Poly(vinyl acetate-co-ethylen) and pure Acrylics of homogeneous or core/shell morphology with the 4 steps: I - Concentration (homogeneous or skin formation), II - Deformation, III - Coalescence, IV -Interdiffusion which were analyzed partly by time-dependent measurements with more than 20 methods (some of them new methods) in order to establish correlations between the main parameters of synthesis, the film formation process and application properties. No universal comprehensive model could be established but a series of special models for film formation which enhance fundamental know-how about the essential parameters of film formation steps (skin formation, compacting, surface tension, capillary forces, crack formation, hydroplastification, surfactant segregation, critical pigment or hard component volume concentration) for important industrial groups of polymer <b>dispersions</b> and some <b>paints.</b> With this enhanced knowledge optimization of some waterborne coatings has been obtained in order to replace dispersions with solvent content.

Hybrid nanopigments are {{intercalation}} compounds {{formed by}} cationic organic dyes adsorbed {{on the surface}} of, mainly, smectite clay mineral hosts. In this study, the inorganic host is a Namontmorillonite, an smectite-type clay with a layered structure, and a cation exchange capacity of 1, 16 meq/g. The organic guests are Basic blue 41 C. I. 1105 (BB 41) Basic yellow 28 C. I. 48054 (BY 28) and Basic Red 46 C. I. 110825 (BR 46). In a first stage, the clay is dispersed in water and then, the dye solution is added. By continuous stirring, the ionic exchange reactions between these two components takes place. Then, these three nanopigments were applied in a transparent paint. In order to improve the <b>dispersion</b> in the <b>paint,</b> were added two kinds of dispersant (A 40, and N 40), and then, were analyze the effects of each dispersant in the results. The nanopigments synthesized firstly obtained in paste form, after centrifuging, the supernatant eliminating water, {{and the proportion of}} dye which has not been exchanged. That proportion was determined by measuring in a UV-Vis spectrophotometer Jasco- 650. This paste format which has been used to mix it in different rates, with the transparent paint base, for extension of different concentrations, and analyzing the obtained color range, and testing in a climatic chamber at SOLARBOX RH 1500 e, for a test of UV-Vis radiation resistance. A part of samples were dried by lyophilization (freezer LDplus ALPHA 1 - 2), in order to avoid agglomerates, and changes in structure with temperature drying. This powdered form has been used for characterization analysis by X-ray diffraction (Mettler Toledo equipment, model TGA/SDTA 851 e/SF/ 1100), to see how it affects the exchange of the three dyes, in the interlayer spacing of the clay, and thermogravimetric analysis (equipment TGA/SDTA 851 e/SF/ 1100) to check if the reinforcement, provides added resistance to loss of mass by temperature. Colorimetric analysis was performed by measuring the spectral reflectance of the extensions of paint applied on cardboards white-black, with an integrating sphere spectrophotometer Minolta CM-Kronica- 2600 D, with daylight illuminant D 65 and 10 ° observer. CIELAB color space was used to analyze the perceived color of the samples, and determine the colour differences with samples made with the pure dye. For optical performance has been applied the Kubelka-Munk theory, so that extensions are needed to prepare in different concentrations. The results showed that the initial hypothesis was correct, and there are a significant reinforcement of organic matter in both, the UV radiation and temperature resistance. The colors obtained are more pure than the original dye, and the color range increases, but the optical performance is significantly lower than that of the samples with the pure dye. That could be because of the lower concentration of pure dye, in these nanopigments, and by influence of the paint base...|$|R
