25|$|By 1908, banana {{growing in}} the Samford {{district}} {{had become one of}} the area's most important industries, and in 1926 and 1927, more bananas were sent from Samford railway station, <b>just</b> <b>down</b> from Camp Mountain, to Sydney and Melbourne than any other station in Queensland. This successful industry existed until the banana bunchy top virus wiped out the crops in the early 1930s.

25|$|By December 2009, no {{takeover}} {{had happened}} and the current owners held creditors meetings {{to try to get}} the banks to give them more time to raise vital funds. Results on the pitch improved slightly with November finishing with two wins, one draw and one defeat, but Zola's men were given a swift reminder of the up hill battle they faced to survive in the Premier League at the hands of Manchester United, as they lost 4–0 at home. More bad luck followed with the loss of top goal scorer Carlton Cole for two months to injury along with young Zavon Hines with a knee injury, leaving Zola over the Christmas break with just Franco and Frank Nouble up front. West Ham also lost Valon Behrami for most of December along with facing a scare with goalkeeper Robert Green, who went off early during the Manchester United game. This since proved to be <b>just</b> <b>down</b> to illness rather than injury.|$|E

25|$|The AIF faced {{their last}} county {{opposition}} on Friday, 29 August in another two-day match, though they won this one. It was <b>just</b> <b>down</b> {{the road from}} Clifton at the Taunton County Ground where they defeated Somerset by 95 runs in a very low-scoring game: AIF 85 and 144 for four declared; Somerset 70 and 64. Only 363 runs in the entire game. The first day was impacted by rain and only 59 overs were bowled. The AIF were all out for 85 just before the scheduled close of play. They quickly dismissed Somerset for 70 in only 32 overs of the second morning. Seamer Charlie Winning and slow left armer Collins did all the bowling, Winning taking six for 30 and Collins four for 38. Collins followed up with 67* to give the Australians a useful lead of 159 going into {{the latter half of}} the last day. Somerset lasted only 28 overs as Collins wiped them out with a career-best eight for 31.|$|E
25|$|Robert Quigley King came to {{a largely}} undeveloped Springfield at age nine in 1840, with his sister, Mary Elizabeth, age three and his brother, David Jr. age one. He {{attended}} the early Springfield schools. He later recalled hunting for squirrels in a woods that later became the train station (now demolished) {{and what would be}} close to the location of the present Clark County Library. His father died when he was eighteen. Nonetheless, his mother was able to send him and, as they arrived at college age, his brothers to Wittenberg College. At one time, she had them all in college at the same time—and Almena could afford that. When Robert Quigley King first started at Wittenberg, it held classes in the lecture room of the First Lutheran Church. However, while he was a student, Wittenberg moved to what is now the western part of its present-day campus. He was in the first class to graduate from Wittenberg. The history of early Springfield mentions how much he liked to hunt, especially in the woods that later became today's Snyder Park, which would have been <b>just</b> <b>down</b> Buck Creek from his childhood home at the King Homestead.|$|E

500|$|Author Robert Rodriguez {{suggests}} {{that one of}} the reasons for Harrison's follow-up album, Extra Texture (Read All About It), being rushed into production in April 1975 was to [...] "redeem the artist from negative fallout" [...] created by Dark Horse over the winter of 1974–75. Having come up with little new material in the previous six months, Harrison revisited songs he had written or begun writing in 1973, one of which was titled [...] "World of Stone". While discussing the song in September 1975, with BBC Radio 1 disc jockey Paul Gambaccini, Harrison commented: [...] "There's not much of a story to it ... it's really <b>just</b> <b>down</b> to saying that everybody has their own opinion and right to be ...

500|$|The Stork Club {{was owned}} and {{operated}} by Sherman Billingsley (1896–1966) an ex-bootlegger who came to New York from Enid, Oklahoma. [...] The Stork Club first opened in 1929 at 132 West 58th Street, <b>just</b> <b>down</b> the street from Billingsley's apartment at 152 West 58th Street. Billingsley's handwritten recollections of the early days recall that he was approached by two gamblers he knew from Oklahoma in his New York real estate office, proposing to open a restaurant together, which he accepted. The origin of the name of the club is unknown; Billingsley once remarked, [...] "Don't ask me how or why I picked the name, because I just don't remember." [...] New York City's El Morocco had the sophistication and Toots Shor's drew the sporting crowd, but the Stork Club mixed power, money, and glamor. [...] Unlike its competitors, the Stork stayed open on Sunday nights and during the summer months.|$|E
