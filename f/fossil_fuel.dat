40|$|The recovery, {{handling}} and combustion of <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> is damaging the environment. This damage may ultimately cause many {{plant and animal}} species to become extinct. If we continue to increase our use of <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> for energy production, humanity may ultimately become one of the species that perish. This is an overwhelming reason to stop the use of <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> as our main energy source. If long-range survival is deemed inadequate to make profound near-term changes in the energy infrastructure, then a second powerful justification comes from the need to conserve the unique substances in <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> for future higher-value use as chemical feed-stocks. These two drives, one to stop using <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> because they cause damage, and the second to save the fossil materials for higher-value use, constitute a powerful motivation to terminate the burning of <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels.</b> We must find new sources of energy. It is shown here that a large part of current environmental damage {{is a direct result of}} the use of <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> as our main energy source,and that the materials found in <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> are much more valuable as chemical feedstocks, from which high value products are made. ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> such as {{coal and}} oil are made {{primarily}} of plant material that was deposited {{millions of years}} ago. This period of time equates to thousands of half-lives of 14C, so essentially all of the 14C in <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> has decayed. <b>Fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> also are depleted in 13C relative to the atmosphere, because they were originally formed from living organisms. Therefore, the carbon from <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> that is returned to the atmosphere through combustion is depleted in both 13C and 14C compared to atmospheric carbon dioxide.|$|R

5|$|Although {{machinery}} {{has replaced}} horses {{in many parts}} of the world, an estimated 100million horses, donkeys and mules are still used for agriculture and transportation in less developed areas.

In agriculture, less <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> is used and increased environmental conservation occurs over time with the use of draft animals such as horses. Logging with horses can result in reduced damage to soil structure and less damage to trees due to more selective logging.|$|E
