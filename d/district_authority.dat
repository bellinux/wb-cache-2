500|$|During the Great Depression, crews {{from the}} Civilian Conservation Corps {{embarked}} on projects {{to improve and}} maintain the parks, which were still {{under the control of}} <b>District</b> <b>authority</b> at that time. At Fort Stanton, CCC members trimmed trees and cleared brush, as well as maintaining and constructing park buildings. Various non-park buildings were also discussed for the land. The City Department of Education proposed building a school on park land, while authorities from the local water utility suggested the construction of a water tower would be suitable for the tall hills of the park. The Second World War interrupted these plans, and post-war budget cuts instituted by President Harry S. Truman postponed the construction of the Fort Drive once more. Though land for the parks had mostly been purchased, construction of the ring road connecting them was pushed back again and again. Other projects managed to find funding, however. In 1949, President Truman approved a supplemental appropriation request of $175,000 to construct [...] "a swimming pool and associated facilities" [...] at Fort Stanton Park.|$|E
