5|$|Future <b>gravitational</b> <b>waves</b> {{observatories}} {{might be}} able to detect primordial <b>gravitational</b> <b>waves,</b> relics of the early universe, up to less than a second after the Big Bang.|$|E
5|$|Some exact {{solutions}} describe <b>gravitational</b> <b>waves</b> {{without any}} approximation, e.g., a wave train traveling through empty space or Gowdy universes, varieties of an expanding cosmos filled with <b>gravitational</b> <b>waves.</b> But for <b>gravitational</b> <b>waves</b> produced in astrophysically relevant situations, {{such as the}} merger of two black holes, numerical methods are presently {{the only way to}} construct appropriate models.|$|E
5|$|The first, indirect, {{detection}} of <b>gravitational</b> <b>waves</b> {{came in the}} 1970s through observation {{of a pair of}} closely orbiting neutron stars, PSR B1913+16. The explanation of the decay in their orbital period was that they were emitting <b>gravitational</b> <b>waves.</b> Einstein's prediction was confirmed on 11 February 2016, when researchers at LIGO published the first observation of <b>gravitational</b> <b>waves,</b> on Earth, exactly one hundred years after the prediction.|$|E
50|$|Center for <b>Gravitational</b> <b>Wave</b> Astronomy Research {{focuses on}} astrophysical source modeling, <b>gravitational</b> <b>wave</b> data analysis, and the phenomenological {{astrophysics}} of <b>gravitational</b> <b>wave</b> sources.|$|R
40|$|An {{overview}} of <b>gravitational</b> <b>wave</b> and its possible detection while propagating in a plasma is given. The linear propagation of <b>gravitational</b> <b>wave</b> in magnetized plasma is considered. It is {{found that a}} × polarized <b>gravitational</b> <b>wave</b> excites Alfve′n modes while a + polarized wave excites magneto-acoustic waves propagating parallel to the <b>gravitational</b> <b>wave.</b> In merging binary pulsars <b>gravitational</b> <b>wave</b> energy can be converted into pulsar wind at a large scale. Key words: <b>gravitational</b> <b>wave,</b> general theory of relativity, binary pulsars, plasmas...|$|R
40|$|Topics {{discussed}} are <b>gravitational</b> <b>wave</b> detection experiments, {{the theoretical}} foundations of <b>gravitational</b> <b>wave</b> physics, black holes, and neutron stars. Particular consideration {{is given to}} methods for circumventing the quantum limit for <b>gravitational</b> <b>wave</b> detectors, global problems in numerical relativity, massive black holes and gravitational radiation, the role of binaries in <b>gravitational</b> <b>wave</b> production, and astrophysical sources of gravitational radiation...|$|R
5|$|In 1916, Einstein {{predicted}} <b>gravitational</b> <b>waves,</b> ripples in {{the curvature}} of spacetime which propagate as waves, traveling {{outward from the}} source, transporting energy as gravitational radiation. The existence of <b>gravitational</b> <b>waves</b> is possible under general relativity due to its Lorentz invariance which brings {{the concept of a}} finite speed of propagation of the physical interactions of gravity with it. By contrast, <b>gravitational</b> <b>waves</b> cannot exist in the Newtonian theory of gravitation, which postulates that the physical interactions of gravity propagate at infinite speed.|$|E
5|$|Experiments and {{observations}} show that Einstein's description of gravitation accounts for several effects that are unexplained by Newton's law, such as minute anomalies in {{the orbits of}} Mercury and other planets. General relativity also predicts novel effects of gravity, such as <b>gravitational</b> <b>waves,</b> gravitational lensing and an effect of gravity on time known as gravitational time dilation. Many of these predictions have been confirmed by experiment or observation, most recently <b>gravitational</b> <b>waves.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gravitational-wave {{astronomy}} is {{an emerging}} field of astronomy that employs gravitational-wave detectors to collect observational data about distant massive objects. A few observatories have been constructed, {{such as the}} Laser Interferometer Gravitational Observatory LIGO. LIGO made its first detection on 14 September 2015, observing <b>gravitational</b> <b>waves</b> from a binary black hole. A second gravitational wave was detected on 26 December 2015 and additional observations should continue but <b>gravitational</b> <b>waves</b> require extremely sensitive instruments.|$|E

40|$|In {{conventional}} <b>gravitational</b> <b>wave</b> scattering theory, a large-distance asymptotic approximation is employed. In this approximation, the <b>gravitational</b> <b>wave</b> is approximated by its large-distance asymptotics.

40|$|The future {{detection}} of <b>gravitational</b> <b>wave</b> {{forces us to}} consider the {{many ways in which}} astrophysics, <b>gravitational</b> <b>wave</b> theory and fundamental theory will interact. In this paper, I summarize some recent work done to develop such an interface. In particular, I concentrate on how non-vacuum astrophysical environments can modify the <b>gravitational</b> <b>wave</b> signal emitted by compact binary inspirals, and whether signatures from the former are detectable by current and future <b>gravitational</b> <b>wave</b> detectors. I also describe the interface between <b>gravitational</b> <b>wave</b> modeling and fundamental theory, focusing on the status of the parameterized post-Einsteinian framework (a general framework to detect deviations away from General Relativity in future <b>gravitational</b> <b>wave</b> data) and its current data analysis implementation.

In February 2016, the Advanced LIGO team announced that they had detected <b>gravitational</b> <b>waves</b> from a black hole merger.|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} we {{introduce}} an activity in which introductory astronomy students act as <b>gravitational</b> <b>wave</b> astronomers by extracting information from simulated <b>gravitational</b> <b>wave</b> signals.

Although the activity described focuses on circular binaries, the techniques described can be applied to other <b>gravitational</b> <b>wave</b> sources as well.

40|$|Abstract. The <b>gravitational</b> <b>wave</b> sky is {{expected}} to have isolated bright sources superimposed on a diffuse <b>gravitational</b> <b>wave</b> background. The background radiation has two components: a confusion limited background from unresolved astrophysical sources; and a cosmological component formed during the birth of the universe. A map of the <b>gravitational</b> <b>wave</b> background can be made by sweeping a <b>gravitational</b> <b>wave</b> detector across the sky. The detector output is a complicated convolution of the sky luminosity distribution, the detector response function and the scan pattern. Here we study the general de-convolution problem, and show how LIGO (Laser Interferometric Gravitational Observatory) and LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna) can be used to detect anisotropies in the <b>gravitational</b> <b>wave</b> background...|$|R
5|$|The first {{observation}} of {{a decrease in}} orbital period due to the emission of <b>gravitational</b> <b>waves</b> was made by Hulse and Taylor, using the binary pulsar PSR1913+16 they had discovered in 1974. This was the first detection of <b>gravitational</b> <b>waves,</b> albeit indirect, {{for which they were}} awarded the 1993 Nobel Prize in physics. Since then, several other binary pulsars have been found, in particular the double pulsar PSR J0737-3039, in which both stars are pulsars.|$|E
5|$|Observations of binary pulsars provide strong {{indirect}} {{evidence for the}} existence of <b>gravitational</b> <b>waves</b> (see Orbital decay, above). Detection of these waves is a major goal of current relativity-related research. Several land-based gravitational wave detectors are currently in operation, most notably the interferometric detectors GEO 600, LIGO (two detectors), TAMA 300 and VIRGO. Various pulsar timing arrays are using millisecond pulsars to detect <b>gravitational</b> <b>waves</b> in the 10−9 to 10−6 Hertz frequency range, which originate from binary supermassive blackholes. A European space-based detector, eLISA / NGO, is currently under development, with a precursor mission (LISA Pathfinder) having launched in December 2015.|$|E
5|$|The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) uses two 4-km Michelson-Fabry-Pérot interferometers for the {{detection}} of <b>gravitational</b> <b>waves.</b> In this application, the Fabry–Pérot cavity is used to store photons for almost a millisecond while they bounce up and down between the mirrors. This increases the time a gravitational wave can interact with the light, which results in a better sensitivity at low frequencies. Smaller cavities, usually called mode cleaners, are used for spatial filtering and frequency stabilization of the main laser. The first observation of <b>gravitational</b> <b>waves</b> occurred on September 14, 2015.|$|E
40|$|We discuss LISA's {{ability to}} resolve {{different}} polarizational states of a <b>gravitational</b> <b>wave</b> with fixed frequency and amplitude.

Using methods of signal processing, we calculate the 1 - uncertainty range for measuring the orientation of the source...|$|R
40|$|<b>Gravitational</b> <b>wave</b> {{science is}} on the verge of direct {{observation}} of the waves predicted by Einstein's General Theory of Relativity and opening the exciting new field of <b>gravitational</b> <b>wave</b> astronomy. In the coming decades, ultra-sensitive arrays of ground-based instruments and complementary spaced-based instruments will observe the <b>gravitational</b> <b>wave</b> sky, inevitably discovering entirely unexpected phenomena while providing new insight into many of the most profound astrophysical phenomena known. in July 2007 the <b>Gravitational</b> <b>Wave</b> International Committee (GWIC) initiated the development of a strategic roadmap for the field of <b>gravitational</b> <b>wave</b> science with a 30 -year horizon. The goal of this roadmap is to serve the international <b>gravitational</b> <b>wave</b> community and its stakeholders as a tool for the development of capabilities and facilities needed to address the exciting scientific opportunities on the intermediate and long-term horizons.
