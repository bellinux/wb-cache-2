50|$|The {{harvester}} {{contains a}} drum-shaped series of cutting knives which shear the fibrous plant material {{into small pieces}} {{no more than an}} inch long, to facilitate mechanized blowing and transport via augers. The finely chopped plant material is then blown by the harvester into a <b>forage</b> <b>wagon</b> which contains an automatic unloading system.|$|E
50|$|Filling a silo {{requires}} parking two tractors {{very close}} to each other, both running at full power and with live PTO shafts, one powering the silo blower and the other powering a <b>forage</b> <b>wagon</b> unloading fresh-cut forage into the blower. The farmer must continually move around in this highly hazardous environment of spinning shafts and high-speed conveyors to check material flows and adjust speeds, and to start and stop all the equipment between loads.|$|E
50|$|The bag {{is loaded}} {{using the same}} forage {{harvesting}} methods as the tower, but the <b>forage</b> <b>wagon</b> must be moved progressively forward with the bag loader. The loader uses an array of rotating cam-shaped spiraled teeth associated with a large comb-shaped tines to push forage into the bag. The forage is pushed in through a large opening, and as the teeth rotate back out, they pass between the comb tines. The cam-shaped auger teeth essentially wipe the forage off using the steel tines, keeping the forage in the bag.|$|E

2500|$|The {{route of}} the bulk of Lee's army was through Fairfield and over Monterey Pass to Hagerstown. A small but {{important}} action that occurred while Pickett's Charge was still underway, the Battle of Fairfield, prevented the Union from blocking this route. Brig. Gen. Wesley Merritt's brigade departed from Emmitsburg with orders to strike the Confederate left and rear along Seminary Ridge. Merritt dispatched about 400 men from the 6th U.S. Cavalry to seize <b>foraging</b> <b>wagons</b> that had {{been reported in the}} area. Before they were able to reach the wagons, the 7th Virginia Cavalry, leading a column under Confederate Brig. Gen. William E. [...] "Grumble" [...] Jones, intercepted the regulars, but the U.S. cavalrymen repulsed the Virginians. Jones sent in the 6th Virginia Cavalry, which successfully charged and swarmed over the Union troopers. There were 242 Union casualties, primarily prisoners, and 44 casualties among the Confederates.|$|R
50|$|Finally on April 30, Lamson's sailors {{landed on}} Hill's Point {{and set up}} pickets. However, around this time Longstreet began to receive word of Union {{movements}} in northern Virginia under Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker. Longstreet assumed he would be called to reinforce Lee, though no orders were issued at the time. Peck also received reports of Union movements and assured Hooker he could hold Longstreet at Suffolk. On May 1, {{the first day of}} fighting at the Battle of Chancellorsville, Hooker insisted to Peck that Longstreet had rejoined Lee, although Peck insisted that he had not left Suffolk. None of Longstreet's forces had returned to Lee by this point but the Confederate <b>foraging</b> <b>wagons</b> began to move back to the North. It was clear at this point that Lee and Hooker were engaged in a major battle, but Longstreet informed Richmond that he would not withdraw until the wagons were safe. On May 3 the withdrawal orders were given. Early on May 3 Getty's division attacked Law's Alabamans and captured the first line of Confederate trenches. The fighting produced relatively high casualties while Longstreet decided to continue with his withdrawal plans later in the day. Corcoran's front pursued Pickett as he withdrew, but they were unable to catch up to the retreating Confederates. By May 9 Longstreet had rejoined Lee near Fredericksburg.|$|R
40|$|Eight whole-plant corn silages were {{evaluated}} using laboratory silos. Treatments were: 1) control (no additive); 2) H/M Inoculant {{applied to the}} fresh crop at the forage harvester (H/M-field); and 3) H/M Inoculant applied to the fresh crop {{at the time of}} ensiling (H/M-silo). The control and H/M-field treatments were ensiled at 0, 4. 5, and 12 hours post-harvest with the fresh crop remaining in the <b>forage</b> <b>wagons</b> until ensiled. The H/M-silo treatment had the inoculant applied immediately prior to ensiling at 4. 5 and 12 hours post-harvest. All eight corn silages were well preserved and underwent predominantly lactic acid fermentations. H/M Inoculant did not influence lactic acid content or 1 actic:acetic and lactic:DM loss ratios. However, H/M-field silage ensiled immediately showed small improvements in quality over the control silage, as judged by lactic acid content and the two fermentation efficiency ratios. H/M Inoculant did not effect DM recovery at any ensiling time. However, when averaged across inoculant treatment, silages made at 4. 5 hours post-harvest had the highest DM recoveries; silages at 12 hours, the lowest. All 4. 5 and 12 hour post-harvest silages had less lactic and total acids than those made at harvest. The silages made as soon as possible after harvest had a faster accumulation of lactic and total fermentation acids than the same fresh crop ensiled 12 hours post-harvest...|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} transmissions, {{often called}} gearboxes to reflect their simplicity (although complex systems are also called gearboxes in the vernacular), provide gear reduction (or, more rarely, {{an increase in}} speed), sometimes {{in conjunction with a}} right-angle change in direction of the shaft (typically in helicopters, see picture). These are often used on PTO-powered agricultural equipment, since the axial PTO shaft is at odds with the usual need for the driven shaft, which is either vertical (as with rotary mowers), or horizontally extending {{from one side of the}} implement to another (as with manure spreaders, flail mowers, and <b>forage</b> <b>wagons).</b> More complex equipment, such as silage choppers and snowblowers, have drives with outputs in more than one direction.The gearbox in a wind turbine converts the slow, high-torque rotation of the turbine into much faster rotation of the electrical generator. These are much larger and more complicated than the PTO gearboxes in farm equipment. They weigh several tons and typically contain three stages to achieve an overall gear ratio from 40:1 to over 100:1, depending on the size of the turbine. (For aerodynamic and structural reasons, larger turbines have to turn more slowly, but the generators all have to rotate at similar speeds of several thousand rpm.) The first stage of the gearbox is usually a planetary gear, for compactness, and to distribute the enormous torque of the turbine over more teeth of the low-speed shaft. Durability of these gearboxes has been a serious problem for a long time.|$|R
60|$|Before {{the receipt}} of this letter, the French commanders, acting on their first impulse, had, about the 9th of February, {{detached}} M. de Tilly, with a sixty-gun ship and two frigates, to make a dash into the Chesapeake. Washington was apprised of their sailing {{just as he was}} preparing to send off the twelve hundred men spoken of in his letter to De Rochambeau. He gave the command of this detachment to Lafayette, instructing him to act in conjunction with the militia and the ships sent by Destouches against the enemy's corps actually in Virginia. As the case was urgent, he was to suffer no delay, when on the march, for want either of provisions, <b>forage,</b> or <b>wagons,</b> but where ordinary means did not suffice, he was to resort to military impress.|$|R
50|$|The lost pioneers had {{now been}} {{traveling}} {{across the desert}} for about two months since leaving the Old Spanish Trail. Their oxen were weak from lack of <b>forage</b> and their <b>wagons</b> were in poor shape. They too were weary and discouraged but their worst problem was not the valley that lay before them. It was the towering Panamint Range mountains to the west that stood like an impenetrable wall as far as {{could be seen in}} both directions.|$|R
50|$|SUPPLY OPERATIONS. Most unit {{logistics}} were accomplished at regimental level. Theregimental QM was {{normally a}} line lieutenant {{designated by the}} regimental commander. Hisduties included submitting requisitions for all QM supplies and transport, accounting forregimental property including tentage, camp equipment, extra clothing, <b>wagons,</b> <b>forage,</b> andanimals; issuing supplies and managing the regimental trains. The regimental commissaryofficer, also designated from the line, requisitioned, accounted for, and issued rations. Theregimental ordnance officer had similar duties regarding arms and ammunition and managedthe movement of the unit ammunition train.In theory, logistical staff positions above the regiment were filled by a fully qualifiedofficer of the supply department concerned, However, experienced officers were inperpetual short supply, and many authorized positions were filled by officers andnoncommissioned officers from line units or left vacant, the duties performed by someone inaddition to their own. This problem existed in both armies, where inexperience andignorance of logistical principles and procedures generally reduced levels of support.|$|R
