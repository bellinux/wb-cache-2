25|$|The {{improved}} {{injection of}} carriers {{into the base}} allows the base {{to have a higher}} <b>doping</b> <b>level,</b> resulting in lower resistance to access the base electrode. In the more traditional BJT, also referred to as homojunction BJT, the efficiency of carrier injection from the emitter to the base is primarily determined by the doping ratio between the emitter and base, which means the base must be lightly doped to obtain high injection efficiency, making its resistance relatively high. In addition, higher doping in the base can improve figures of merit like the Early voltage by lessening base narrowing.|$|E

The thicker the layer and the lower its <b>doping</b> <b>level,</b> the higher the breakdown voltage. On the contrary, the thinner the layer and the higher the <b>doping</b> <b>level,</b> the lower the RDSon (and therefore the lower the conduction losses of the MOSFET). Therefore, {{it can be seen that}} there is a trade-off in the design of a MOSFET, between its voltage rating and its ON-state resistance [...] This is demonstrated by the plot in figure 3.|$|E

40|$|The redox {{states of}} poly(3 -octylthiophene) (P 3 OT) in {{solution}} are studied {{to address the}} role of polarons and bipolarons in conducting polymers. By solution <b>doping,</b> oxidation <b>levels</b> up to ~ 0. 60 charges per thiophene ring can be attained, much higher than reported previously for p-conjugated polymers.

Bipolarons are only formed at high <b>doping</b> <b>levels</b> when the charges {{can no longer be}} accommodated in individual lattice distortions.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{saturated}} diffraction efficiency has been optimized {{by considering the}} effect of the absorption of the recording light on a crossed-beam grating with 90 degrees recording geometry in Fe:LiNbO 3 crystals. The dependence of saturated diffraction efficiency on the <b>doping</b> <b>levels</b> with a known oxidation-reduction state, as well as the dependence of saturated diffraction efficiency on oxidation-reduction state with known <b>doping</b> <b>levels,</b> has been investigated. Two competing effects on the saturated diffraction efficiency were discussed, and the intensity profile of the diffracted beam at the output boundary has also been investigated. The results show that the maximal saturated diffraction efficiency can be obtained in crystals with moderate <b>doping</b> <b>levels</b> and modest oxidation state.
