5|$|After {{spending}} the 2015–16 {{season with the}} Lightning's AHL affiliate, the Syracuse Crunch, in which he contributed with 49 points in 65 games, Tambellini returned to Sweden <b>in</b> <b>securing</b> a one-year contract with Djurgårdens IF of the SHL on June 10, 2016. Tambellini left Djurgården in February, 2017, having failed to make a significant impact at Djurgården by producing only 4 goals and 5 assists in 41 games. He subsequently rejoined his former team Växjö Lakers, {{with whom he had}} won the Le Mat Trophy in 2015.|$|E
40|$|A {{new concept}} of {{equilibrium}} <b>in</b> <b>secure</b> strategies (EinSS) <b>in</b> non-cooperative games is presented. The EinSS {{coincides with the}} Nash-Cournot Equilibrium when Nash-Cournot Equilibrium exists and postulates the incentive of players to maximize their profit under the condition of security against actions of other players. The new concept is illustrated {{by a number of}} matrix game examples and compared with other closely related theoretical models. We prove the existence of equilibrium <b>in</b> <b>secure</b> strategies <b>in</b> four classic games that fail to have Nash-Cournot equilibria. On an infinite line we obtain the solution <b>in</b> <b>secure</b> strategies of the classic Hotelling’s price game (1929) with a restricted reservation price and linear transportation costs. New type of monopolistic solution <b>in</b> <b>secure</b> strategies is discovered in the Tullock Contest (1967, 1980) of two players. For the model of insurance market we prove that the contract pair found by Rothschild, Stiglitz and Wilson (1976) is always an equilibrium <b>in</b> <b>secure</b> strategies. We characterize all equilibria <b>in</b> <b>secure</b> prices <b>in</b> the Bertrand-Edgeworth duopoly model with capacity constraints...|$|R

5|$|After the Jacobite rising of 1745, Adam's {{position}} as Mason to the Board of Ordnance {{brought him a}} number of large military contracts in the Highlands. In 1746, the position of Master Carpenter to the Board of Ordnance became vacant, and Adam was quick to put forward his son John's name for consideration, although he was unsuccessful <b>in</b> <b>securing</b> him the post. His three eldest sons were all involved in the family business by 1746, James and John both leaving Edinburgh University early to join their father.|$|E

Though Camp Zachary Taylor was abandoned after World War I, Fort Knox became the home of the United States Bullion Depository. When the United States entered World War I, Beckham continued to back President Wilson and supported the League of Nations.|$|E

5|$|It had {{two main}} limitations.

The CR was to prove a formidable competitor for Anglo-Scottish traffic, both passenger and goods, and much energy and money were expended <b>in</b> <b>securing</b> exclusive territory for the G, and in keeping the CR out.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, Athens orchestrated the {{creation}} of an alliance with Euboea, Megara, Achaea, Corinth, Acarnania and other states in the Peloponnese. However the most desirable ally for Athens was Thebes. To secure their allegiance, Demosthenes was sent, by Athens, to the Boeotian city; Philip also sent a deputation, but Demosthenes succeeded <b>in</b> <b>securing</b> Thebes's allegiance.* K. Tsatsos, Demosthenes, 284–285; H. Weil, Biography of Demosthenes, 41–42. Demosthenes' oration before the Theban people is not extant and, therefore, the arguments he used to convince the Thebans remain unknown. In any case, the alliance came at a price: Thebes's control of Boeotia was recognised, Thebes was to command solely on land and jointly at sea, and Athens was to pay two thirds of the campaign's cost.|$|E
