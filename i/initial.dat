There {{are nine}} diagrams, six miniatures, eight large historiated <b>initials,</b> two smaller historiated <b>initials</b> and three decorated <b>initials,</b> {{all of which}} are painted in colors and feature gold leaf. The larger historiated <b>initials</b> have full borders which are historiated and contain scenes in the base of the page. The smaller historiated <b>initials</b> have partial foliate borders. The decorated <b>initials</b> have extensions into the margins of the page. There are also some smaller decorated <b>initials</b> which include human heads, which are also painted in colors and gold. There are also smaller gold <b>initials</b> on red and blue grounds, smaller gold <b>initials</b> with purple foliate pen flourishes and smaller blue <b>initials</b> with red foliate pen flourishes.|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} aims at {{investigating}} {{the categories of}} the zhao-series <b>initials</b> of Middle Chinese. Particularly, the present study tries to examine whether the zhuang-group <b>initials</b> and the zhang-group <b>initials</b> should be considered belonging {{to one or two}} groups of <b>initials,</b> using both dialectal and historical data. The first part of the thesis is an overview on what is being said about the zhuang-group <b>initials</b> and the zhang-group <b>initials</b> in previous studies. The second part of the thesis discusses the merge and the split of the zhuang-group <b>initials</b> and the zhang-group <b>initials</b> based on their historical development and in conjunction with ancient Chinese and Modern Chinese Phonology. The third part of the thesis uses the data of the distribution of the zhuang-group <b>initials</b> and the zhang-group <b>initials</b> in present day Northern Mandarin to discuss the categories of these two groups of <b>initials</b> in Middle Chinese. Combining the observations made from both dialectal data and historical studies, the conclusion of the present study is that the zhuang-group <b>initials</b> and the zhang-group <b>initials</b> should be considered belonging to two different groups of <b>initials,</b> which will be the fourth part of the thesis...|$|R

5000|$|In most {{varieties}} of Chinese {{that have lost}} the voicing of Middle Chinese <b>initials,</b> the aspiration of the resulting <b>initials</b> is conditioned by tone, though the relationship varies between dialect groups.In Min varieties however, both aspirated and unaspirated voiceless <b>initials</b> are found in lower register tones.These <b>initials</b> must therefore be distinguished in proto-Min as aspirated and unaspirated voiced consonants.In Shao-Jiang these <b>initials</b> are uniformly aspirated, but the same distinction {{is reflected in the}} tonal development.As with the voiceless <b>initials,</b> there is a third group of formerly voiced <b>initials</b> with fricative or lateral reflexes in some Northern Min varieties, which Norman called [...] "softened" [...] voiced initials.In Eastern Min varieties, voiced unaspirated affricates typically yielded plain /s/.|$|R
