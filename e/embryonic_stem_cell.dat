40|$|<b>Embryonic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells,</b> {{typically}} {{isolated from}} the inner cell mass of blastocysts, represent a potentially unlimited cell source for tissue engineering. However, the potential tumorgencity of the undifferentiated cells and the heterogeneous cell population generated by current differentiation protocols impede the use of <b>embryonic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> as a clinical cell source for tissue engineering applications. This thesis examines the effects of emulating the differentiation signals provided by the extracellular matrix during development with synthetic poly (L-lactic acid) nanofibers on the differentiation of the <b>embryonic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> to osteoblasts. First, undifferentiated mouse <b>embryonic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> were seeded onto two dimensional nanofibrous thin matrices or flat (solid) films. With osteogenic supplementation the nanofibrous architecture was found to promote the osteogenic differentiation and mineralization of the mouse <b>embryonic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells.</b> α 2 and α 5 integrin appear to contribute to this osteogenic differentiation. Next, the effects of biologically active factors and three dimensional culture were examined on mouse <b>embryonic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> which were partially differentiated via embryoid body formation prior to seeding on the materials. The nanofibrous architecture was found to facilitate further differentiation of the cells {{in the absence of}} osteogenic stimulation, while the cells cultured on solid film required osteogenic supplements and growth factors to support osteogenic differentiation. Three dimensional culture on nanofibrous scaffolding was found to further enhance the osteogenic differentiation and mineralization more than two dimensional culture on either the nano-fibrous or solid architecture and three dimensional culture on the solid-walled scaffolding. The osteogenic differentiation of human <b>embryonic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> was examined next. In both two and three dimensional culture, the nanofibrous architecture enhanced the osteogenic differentiation and mineralization of the human <b>embryonic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> compared to the solid architecture. In summary, the nanofibrous architecture enhances the osteogenic differentiation of mouse and human <b>embryonic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> compared to the more traditional solid-walled tissue engineering scaffolding architecture. This indicates that emulating size scale of the extracellular matrix with synthetic nanofibers is advantageous in promoting osteogenic differentiation of <b>embryonic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background and Aim: <b>Embryonic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> are {{identified}} with two unique characteristics. First, {{they can be}} maintained and expanded as pure populations of undifferentiated cells, a characteristic which is known as self renewal aspect of <b>embryonic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells.</b> Second, these cells can give rise to all body cell types. In the current study, we used a feeder-free condition to differentiate mouse <b>embryonic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> into lymphoid lineage by IL- 7 and FLT- 3 ligand. Materials and Methods: Mouse <b>embryonic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> cultured on mouse embryonic fibroblasts were separated from the feeder layer. Then, embryoid bodies were formed from mouse <b>embryonic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells.</b> Following that, differentiation was performed by FLT- 3 ligand and IL- 7. In order to demonstrate the differentiation into lymphoid lineages, the expression of CD 25, CD 19 and CD 3 was assessed by RT-PCR technique on days 7 and 14. Results: After 14 days of differentiation into lymphoid lineages by defined factors, RT-PCR results showed the expression of CD 25 and CD 19 markers. Conclusion: In all previous studies, mouse <b>embryonic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> were differentiated into lymphoid lineage by OP 9 stromal feeder cells. In this study, a feeder-free condition was used to differentiate mouse <b>embryonic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> into lymphoid lineage.

40|$|Abstract: The bi-functional enzyme UDP-N-acetyl- 2 -epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE) is the {{key enzyme}} of the sialic acid biosynthesis. Sialic acids are {{negatively}} charged nine carbon amino sugars and are found on most glycoproteins and many glycolipids in terminal positions, where {{they are involved in}} a variety of biological important molecular interactions. Inactivation of the GNE by homologous recombination results in early embryonic lethality in mice. Here, we report that GNE-deficient <b>embryonic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> express less differentiation markers compared to wild-type <b>embryonic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells.</b> As a result, GNE-deficient <b>embryonic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> fail to form proper embryoid bodies (EB) within the first day of culture. However, when culturing these cells in the presence of sialic acids for three days, also GNE-deficient <b>embryonic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> form normal EBs. In contrast, when culturing these cells in sialic acid reduced medium, GNE-deficient <b>embryonic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> proliferate faster and form larger EBs without any change in the expression of markers of the germ layers...|$|R
