500|$|I quaked {{a little}} as we began our quartet 'A Right-down Regular Royal Queen.' [...] But [...] numbers seemed to amuse the real Queen more than {{anything}} else in the opera, and, indeed, who could so well as she see the point of them? [...] The very fact of her choosing this opera from all the others to be played before her shows how vivid was her sense of fun, and how truly British was her willingness to laugh at herself. [...] There was... only one encore... nd who <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>suppose</b> was singled out for that honour? Who but I who write this, little Jessie Bond... for my song in the first act, 'When a Merry Maiden Marries.' ...|$|E
2500|$|Predating {{the modern}} age of pornography, facials were {{described}} in literature. As an example, the French aristocrat Marquis de Sade wrote about performing facials in his work The 120 Days of Sodom, written in 1785. One passage of the novel reads [...] "... I show them my prick, then what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>suppose</b> I do? I squirt the fuck in their face... That's my passion my child, I have no other... and you're about to behold it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, taking <b>you</b> by-and-large, <b>you</b> <b>do</b> {{seem to be}} more {{different}} kinds of an ass than any creature I ever saw before. What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>suppose</b> he wanted to know for?' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> pause?" [...] said Bridgenorth; [...] "a sudden {{thought is}} often a wise, almost always an honest one. With whom <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>suppose</b> I meant to entrust my child, that the idea called forth so anxious an expression?" ...|$|R
2500|$|I watch none. He [...] {{sits and}} listens and I read books, because I know {{perfectly}} well that, don't take offense, that 90 percent of what I hear on television is supposition, when we're talking about the news. And he's not, not as understanding of my pettiness about that. But why should we hear about body bags and deaths, and how many, what day it's gonna happen, and how many this or that or what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>suppose?</b> Or, I mean, it's not relevant. So, why should I waste my beautiful mind on something like that, and watch him suffer.|$|E
2500|$|Carlton Blanchard: {{played by}} William Hickey, Carlton {{is an old}} man with a high-pitched nasal voice whose {{outwardly}} meek yet privately demanding behavior causes everyone who meets him to shudder at his coming. He is also known for asking bizarre questions such as [...] "If you were to carpet Florida, {{how long would it take}} to vacuum it?" [...] and [...] "If a monkey were to bite you, what kind of drugs <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>suppose</b> they'd give you?". He annoys Joe, Brian, Lowell and Antonio when he wins a charity contest sponsored by Sandpiper and demands to be flown to Las Cruces, New Mexico, far beyond the scope of Sandpiper's routes.|$|E

6000|$|... "Ellen! I {{will not}} have this!" [...] cried her mother, frantic at the reproach. [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> mean by my letting you? You {{knew that we were}} going to sail, didn't <b>you?</b> What else <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>suppose</b> we had come to the steamer for?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{should be}} quite plain. You could buy me. It sounds absurd, of course, and a trifle theatrical, {{but it is}} just what took place, and there are no doubt many of us for sale. Isn't that alone {{sufficient}} to make me hate you? Can't you realise the sickening humiliation of it, and <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>you</b> could buy my love as well?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell {{me about}} your wife, Alderling," [...] I said, and he {{answered}} {{with a sort of}} scream, [...] "I wanted you to ask me! Why didn't you ask me before? What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>suppose</b> I got <b>you</b> here for?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Mahaffey {{also stated}} that after the murder of Virgil Starks, the police made the {{farmhouse}} off limits to everybody. [...] "Several nights later, I was holding forth in the Arkansas police station when a call came through that a neighbor had seen strange lights in the farmhouse. We sped to the scene and I hid behind a car while Police Chief Max Tackett and three other patrolmen approached the house. Chief Tackett yelled into the house that the place was surrounded and the Phantom might as well give up. Who <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>suppose</b> walked out? None other than Lone Wolf Gonzaullas of the Texas Rangers and a woman photographer from Life and Time magazines. Lone Wolf explained rather sheepishly {{that he had been}} re-enacting the crime and the young lady was taking pictures of him. Police Chief Tackett turned to me and shouted {{at the top of his}} voice, 'Mahaffey, you can quote me as saying that the Phantom Murders will never be solved until Texarkana gets rid of the big city press and the Texas Rangers.'" ...|$|E

6000|$|March's {{face had}} sobered {{more and more}} as she {{followed}} one hopeful burst with another, and now it expressed a positive pain. But he forced a smile and said: [...] "There's a little condition attached. Where <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>suppose</b> it was to be published?" ...|$|R
6000|$|ATTEN. That is true, but it doth {{not follow}} {{that if the}} father had done as I said, the son would have <b>done</b> as <b>you</b> <b>suppose.</b> But if he had <b>done</b> as <b>you</b> have <b>supposed,</b> what had he done worse than what he hath done already? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{ought to}} require no consideration," [...] said Mr. Clavering, rising from his chair--"none at all; not a moment's. Heavens and earth! Why, what <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>you</b> were to live upon? But I won't discuss it. I {{will not say}} one more word upon a subject which is so distasteful to me. You must excuse me if I leave you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{were willing}} {{enough to take}} {{advantage}} of that impurity. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>suppose</b> Giulia's character has altered because you have married her?

6000|$|... 'And <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>suppose,</b> sir,' {{retorted}} Mr Tappertit, with a thickness and slowness {{of speech}} which contrasted forcibly with the rapidity and earnestness of his kind-hearted master--'and <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>suppose,</b> sir, that I am base and mean enough to accept your servile proposition?--Miscreant!' ...|$|E

"I {{am a man}} of peace, James Mainwaring," [...] Eleazer replied, [...] "but {{there are}} men of blood in these waters, and an {{appearance}} of great strength is of use to protect the innocent from the wicked. If I remained in appearance the peaceful trader I really am, how long <b>does</b> <b>thee</b> <b>suppose</b> I could remain unassailed in this place?" ...|$|R
