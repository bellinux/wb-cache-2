5000|$|Bothriechis is a genus of venomous pitvipers {{commonly}} called <b>palm</b> <b>vipers</b> or palm-pitvipers found predominantly in Mexico and Central America, although {{the most common}} species, B. schlegelii, ranges {{as far south as}} Colombia and Peru. All members are relatively slender and arboreal. The name Bothriechis is derived from the Greek words bothros and echis that mean [...] "pit" [...] and [...] "viper" [...] respectively. Ten species and no subspecies are currently generally recognized.|$|R

50|$|Trimeresurus is a genus of venomous pit vipers {{found in}} Asia from the Indian Subcontinent {{throughout}} Southeast Asia, China and the Pacific Islands. Currently at least 35 species are recognized. Common names include Asian <b>palm</b> pit <b>vipers,</b> Asian lanceheads and Asian lance-headed vipers.|$|R
25|$|There are {{numerous}} protected areas and wildlife preserves on the island. Animals that are ubiquitous throughout the island include frogs, toads, geckos, skinks, and butterflies. Present, but less commonly observed, are snakes (Asian <b>palm</b> pit <b>vipers,</b> red bamboo snake, and occasionally cobras), Siberian chipmunks, squirrels, and the masked palm civet. Almost no large animals {{remain in the}} wild. The lakes are largely populated with carp and catfish.|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} {{comparative}} proteomic {{characterization of the}} venoms of two related neotropical arboreal pitvipers from Costa Rica of the genus Bothriechis, B. lateralis (side-striped <b>palm</b> pit <b>viper)</b> and B. schlegelii (eyelash pit viper). The crude venoms were fractionated by reverse-phase HPLC, followed by analysis of each chromatographic fraction by SDS-PAGE, N-terminal sequencing, MALDI-TOF mass fingerprinting, and collision-induced dissociation tandem mass spectrometry of tryptic peptides. The venom proteomes of B. lateralis and B. schlegelii comprise similar number of distinct proteins belonging, respectively, to 8 and 7 protein families. The two Bothriechis venoms contain bradykinin-potentiating peptides (BPPs), and proteins from the phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2), serine proteinase, l-amino acid oxidase (LAO), cysteine-rich secretory protein (CRISP), and Zn 2 +-dependent metalloproteinase (SVMP) families, albeit each species exhibit different relative abundances. Each venom also contains unique components, for example, snake venom vascular endothelial growth factor (svVEGF) and C-type lectin-like molecules in B. lateralis, and Kazal-type serine proteinase inhibitor-like proteins in B. schlegelii. Using a similarity coefficient, we estimate that the similarity of the venom proteins between the two Bothriechis taxa may be < 10 %, indicating a high divergence in their venom compositions, {{in spite of the}} fact that both species have evolved to adapt to arboreal habits. The major toxin families of B. lateralis and B. schlegelii are SVMP (55 % of the total venom proteins) and PLA 2 (44 %), respectively. Their different venom toxin compositions provide clues for rationalizing the distinct signs of envenomation caused by B. schlegelii and B. lateralis. An antivenomic study of the immunoreactivity of the Instituto Clodomiro Picado (ICP) polyvalent antivenom toward Bothriechis venoms revealed that l-amino acid oxidase and SVMPs represent the major antigenic protein species in both venoms. Our results provide a ground for rationalizing the reported protection of the ICP polyvalent antivenom against the hemorrhagic, coagulant, defibrinating, caseinolytic and fibrin(ogen) olytic activities of Bothriechis (schlegelii, lateralis) venoms. However, these analyses also evidenced the limited recognition capability of the polyvalent antivenom toward a number of Bothriechis venom components, predominantly BPPs, svVEGF, Kazal-type inhibitors, some PLA 2 proteins, some serine proteinases, and CRISP molecules. info:eu-repo//Ministerio de Educación y Ciencia// BFU 2004 - 01432 /BMC/ [Madrid, España]//info:eu-repo//Universidad de Costa Rica-CSIC// 2006 CR 0010 /[Costa Rica]//info:eu-repo//Ciencia y tecnología para el Desarrollo (CYTED) // 206 AC 0281 /[España]//UCR::Investigación::Unidades de Investigación::Ciencias de la Salud::Instituto Clodomiro Picado (ICP...|$|R
