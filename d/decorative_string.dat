5000|$|Fort Wayne Hotel / American Hotel, 400-426 Temple : This 11 story, brown {{brick and}} terra cotta {{building}} {{was designed by}} Ellington and Weston and constructed in 1926 as a lodge headquarters and hotel for the Knights of Pythias. The first and second floors are finished in smooth ashlar and a <b>decorative</b> <b>string</b> of red and blue terra cotta tiles separate the ninth and tenth stories. The upper two stories have decorative stone surrounds.|$|E
50|$|Ballet flats or Dolly {{shoes are}} derived from a woman's soft ballet shoe, with a very thin heel or the {{appearance}} of no heel at all. The style sometimes features a ribbon-like binding around the low tops of the slipper and may have a slight gathering at the top-front of the vamp (toe box) and a tiny, <b>decorative</b> <b>string</b> tie. Ballet slippers can be adjusted and tightened to the wearer's foot by means of this string tie.|$|E
5000|$|The {{exterior}} displays numerous [...] "double keyhole" [...] gunloops, {{as well as}} <b>decorative</b> <b>string</b> {{courses and}} corbelling. Over the entrance are blank panels framed by carved supports, {{as well as the}} arms of the 5th Earl of Argyll with the Gaelic motto DIA LE UA NDUIBHNE, [...] "God be with O'Duine", referring to the semi-legendary ancestors of Clan Campbell. At the top of the tower are the remains of open rounds along the parapet, and a caphouse above the stair. Fragments of carved drain spouts have been found, and are on display in the cellars.|$|E
50|$|Though {{they are}} not of {{commercial}} interest as fibre crops, suitably prepared vines from some Cassytha species are of value in rural communities as a casual source of cord. They {{may be used for}} binding bundles of materials such as thatch, or for <b>stringing</b> <b>decorative</b> festoons.|$|R
500|$|According to oral tradition, scribes used {{obsidian}} flakes {{or small}} shark teeth, presumably the hafted tools still used to carve wood in Polynesia, to flute and polish the tablets {{and then to}} incise the glyphs. The glyphs are most commonly composed of deep smooth cuts, though superficial hair-line cuts are also found. In the closeup image at right, a glyph is composed of two parts connected by [...] a hair-line cut; this is a typical convention for this shape. Several researchers, including Barthel, believe that these superficial cuts were made by obsidian, and that the texts were carved in a two-stage process, first sketched with obsidian and then deepened and finished with a worn shark tooth. The remaining hair-line cuts were then either errors, design conventions (as at right), or <b>decorative</b> embellishments. Vertical <b>strings</b> of chevrons or lozenges, for example, are typically connected with hair-line cuts, {{as can be seen}} repeatedly in the closeup of one end of tablet B below. However, Barthel was told that the last literate Rapanui king, Nga‘ara, sketched out the glyphs in soot applied with a fish bone and then engraved them with a shark tooth.|$|R
2500|$|By 1847, all of Blacket's {{proposed}} changes, {{including the}} elaborate façade and lengthening of the nave had been accepted. In {{order to make}} sure that his design was truly the best possible solution, he sent copies of his plans to England, to both the Oxford Society and the Cambridge Camden Society for comment. His design was acceptable to both, the Oxford Society in particular waxed lyrical, saying that his design [...] "had realised the idea of a cathedral, as diverse from a parish church". However, Oxford wanted the roof of the aisles to be of steeper pitch, and a <b>decorative</b> moulding (or <b>string</b> course) around the interior walls, while Cambridge wanted more pinnacles and just one large window in the transept ends. Blacket obliged by making such changes as he could, but the string course and the rebuilding of the paired windows in the existent transept were impractical. Blacket had the model-maker J.C. White construct a detailed cardboard model of a scale 1inch to 8 feet. This pleased the committee and the cathedral was finished much as demonstrated on the model, but with one very significant change: the west front, while retaining its form, had it details redesigned, {{in the light of the}} drawings that he received from Yorkshire.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the main}} facades, {{there is a}} <b>decorative</b> <b>string</b> course above the first floor {{verandah}} roof. The windows {{on the second floor}} have moulded bracketed sills and decorative pediments. Above this are regularly spaced paired brackets supporting a cornice, surmounted by a parapet. Pedestals carrying urns divide the parapet into sections, some of which contain balustrading, while others are solid with the title [...] "TREASURY HOTEL" [...] in raised lettering. On the centre of the parapet of the Elizabeth Street facade is a pediment. A similar pediment crowns the corner and has a flagpole located behind it.|$|E
50|$|In Poland, the rector (rektor) is {{the elected}} {{head of a}} {{university}} or university college. The rector is the highest official of the university. Rector of the university can be a person {{with at least a}} doctoral degree, employed by the university as the main place of work. Rector is referred to as His/Her Magnificence (abbreviation: JM). The outfit of rector is red or purple coat (robe) with ermine fur, often with a scepter and a <b>decorative</b> <b>string</b> of symbols of the university. Deputy rectors (prorektor) at official ceremonies are dressed in the same gown, but with fewer decorations (usually without the fur). Rectors of military universities - wear only uniform of an officer and a necklace with symbols of the university.|$|E
50|$|The former Crawford and Co Building has an {{ornamental}} and eclectic Victorian facade featuring many {{characteristics of}} the Renaissance style of architecture including pediments, balustraded parapets and low-relief pilasters symmetrically composed around its vertical axis. Each floor space of the building is clearly articulated in {{the layout of the}} facade. The impression of strength and solidity is given by a decorative rendered finish. Rusticated quoining has been applied to each end of the building's upper floor and the lower floor has been lined out in imitation of stone ashlar. The entrance door and window opening on the ground floor are arched and feature casts of the heads (of Burns and Scott) on the key stones. A <b>decorative</b> <b>string</b> course with low-relief scrolls interspersed with rosette motifs spans the building between the upper and lower windows.|$|E
50|$|The Parish House is {{a three-story}} brick {{structure}} with a two story projecting bay. The central entrance door and vestibule is located {{next to the}} bay, towards the north end. The projecting bay has paired rectangular windows with a segmental transom light above on the first floor, and paired, segmental arched windows on the second floor. A segmental arched window {{is located at the}} second floor of the main block, while three rectangular windows are located at the third floor. The central window is covered with a triangular brick pediment and the side windows have jack arches. <b>Decorative</b> <b>string</b> courses are located at each of the levels and inset brick panels can be found between the basement and first floor and between the first floor and the second floors. The cornice of both the projecting bay and main block is corbelled and supports a flat roof.|$|E
50|$|The song fades {{in with an}} {{acoustic}} guitar in D tuning strumming the chords with a lively, syncopated rhythm, with a droning Farfisa organ playing chord tones (A, B♭, A, and A♭, respectively). After the first sixteen-bar progression, Gilmour begins the vocal. For the third repetition, bass guitar, Hammond organ, drums and lead guitar (playing a subtle drone of D) enter. After this repetition comes {{the first of several}} guitar solos, played by Gilmour on a Fender Telecaster rather than his usual Fender Stratocaster. Next is another verse of lyrics, followed by a keyboard solo. Finally, after six repetitions of the main theme, the tempo is cut in half, dramatically slower, a new chord progression is introduced, resolving gradually to the relative major, F, with two lead guitars loudly playing a slow harmonized melody, and a quieter third guitar adding <b>decorative</b> <b>string</b> bends, with heavy use of reverb and echo.|$|E
