25|$|For series 14, {{the format}} of the live shows was revised significantly: the finalists are divided into two groups, where the contestants in each group compete against each other on Saturday or Sunday to win that night's show; the two winning contestants {{competing}} against each other to win a weekly prize. The voting window has once again been shortened; in that viewers only <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> to vote for their favourite acts after all the contestants on the night have performed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Just so. Still, they'd <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> and there's {{reason for}} believing they're not fond of you. Then, I don't {{mean to be}} made a {{prisoner}} and, if I'm forced to, I'll shoot straight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Mrs. Conyers, please {{accompany}} them {{as quick as}} you can to the river. We will follow and cover the retreat. I think we <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> yet, before cavalry can arrive from the camp." ...|$|E
60|$|After {{his guests}} had departed, Wingate <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> alone with Josephine.|$|R
50|$|Core Values: Former WMAL pundit Chris Core <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> long {{monologue}} {{similar to}} Bill O'Reilly's Talking Points memo segment on The O'Reilly Factor.|$|R
50|$|They <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> of {{precious}} time, but a fatally wounded comrade, a now known vehicle, and a trunk load of weapons to hide.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{danger is}} not yet so inevitable," [...] {{returned}} Paul, steadily. [...] "Frightful and pressing as it truly seems, we <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> to think in. Let me entreat that Miss Effingham and Mademoiselle Viefville will receive a drop of this cordial." ...|$|E
6000|$|She put {{her hand}} to her bosom and looked about her restlessly. His {{intensity}} scared her. [...] "I know what you mean, but let us not talk of that now; let us discuss your play. I want to suggest something for your third act, but I must dress now. You will wait, won't you? We will <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> before I go on. Please sit here and wait for me." ...|$|E
60|$|I need hardly {{say that}} she did not read much. She sat there over her aunt's fire, waiting to catch the sound of the wheels on the gravel at the front door. At one moment she would think that he was never coming--the time {{appeared}} to be so long; and then again, when she heard any sound which might be that of his approach, she would again wish to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> more to herself.|$|E
6000|$|... "About {{a quarter}} of an hour," [...] was the answer. [...] "I'll come for you, if you like. <b>Have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minute's</b> nap if you feel sleepy." ...|$|R
25|$|In the {{championship}} Cruise <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> lead over Watson {{and stayed in}} the safety of the bunch, keeping out of trouble in the sprint around Como Park.|$|R
60|$|That {{sounds very}} formidable. I <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> to spare while some letters were being {{prepared}} for me to sign. But in any case I'm always at your service.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am so sorry," [...] {{she said}} as she shook hands with a very {{influential}} but very doubtful voter of the farmer class, [...] "but I don't know anything about English politics; so I can't talk to you about it as I'd like to. But you know I am going to marry Mr. Walmsley and come to live here, and it would be so nice to feel that all my friends had voted for him. If you <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> to spare, Mr. Brown, would you please tell me just where you don't agree with Paul? I should so much like to hear, because he tells me that if once you were on his side he would feel almost comfortable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] said Mr. George, [...] "about the dinner." [...] So the two {{travellers}} held {{a consultation}} on this subject, and concluded what to <b>have.</b> <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> afterwards a waiter came by, carrying a large salver, with some coffee and {{bread and butter}} upon it, for a gentleman on the deck. Mr. George beckoned to this waiter, {{and when he came}} to him, he ordered the dinner that he and Rollo had agreed upon. It consisted of sausages for Rollo, a beefsteak for Mr. George, and fried potatoes for both. After that they were to have an omelet and some coffee. The coffee on board the Rhine steamers, being made with very rich and pure milk, is delicious.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind them," [...] Chris shouted; [...] "we {{are going}} to be {{attacked}} by a big party. Put down your rifles all of you, and pile the stones on the crest, so as to make a shelter, as quickly as you can. We shall <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes.</b> Those who are coming up can't know yet what the firing means." [...] He ran up to the top. [...] "They are not more than six or seven hundred yards away," [...] he said, [...] "and {{it would be better to}} fight it out here than to take to our horses. Some of us would certainly not get off without a bullet. You need not mind showing yourselves when they come up. They won't be able to make out what we are." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{first film}} version of Thornton Wilder's The Bridge of San Luis Rey, also {{released}} in 1929, <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> of sound tacked onto what was basically a silent picture.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bless you, madonna! bless you!" [...] {{said the}} faint chorus, {{in much the}} same tone as that in which they <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> before praised and thanked the unseen Madonna.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} his watch. Although his {{cabriolet}} was already at the door, he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> to spare. He excused himself from Le Chapelier, and went briskly out to the anteroom.|$|R
60|$|This diary {{is getting}} mixed. The truth is, I am not {{living as a}} man who keeps a diary should live. I ought, of course, to sit down in front of this diary at eleven o'clock at night, and write down all that has {{occurred}} to me during the day. But at eleven o'clock at night, I am {{in the middle of a}} long railway journey, or have just got up, or am just going to bed for a couple of hours. We go to bed at odd moments, when we happen to come across a bed, and <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> to spare. We have been to bed this afternoon, and are now having another breakfast; and I am not quite sure whether it is yesterday or to-morrow, or what day it is.|$|E
60|$|A {{day or two}} {{passed without}} {{producing}} anything. The theatre or the rooms, where he was most likely to be, were not fashionable enough for the Elliots, whose evening amusements were solely in the elegant stupidity of private parties, {{in which they were}} getting more and more engaged; and Anne, wearied of such a state of stagnation, sick of knowing nothing, and fancying herself stronger because her strength was not tried, was quite impatient for the concert evening. It was a concert for the benefit of a person patronised by Lady Dalrymple. Of course they must attend. It was really expected to be a good one, and Captain Wentworth was very fond of music. If she could only <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> conversation with him again, she fancied she should be satisfied; and as to the power of addressing him, she felt all over courage if the opportunity occurred. Elizabeth had turned from him, Lady Russell overlooked him; her nerves were strengthened by these circumstances; she felt that she owed him attention.|$|E
6000|$|... "I write {{immediately}} {{to tell you}} of our safe arrival. We have found comfortable lodgings (as the address {{at the head of}} this letter will inform you) in Albion Place. I thank you, and Emma desires to thank you also, for your kindness in providing us with ample means for taking our little trip. It is beautiful weather today; the sea is calm, and the pleasure-boats are out. We do not of course expect to see you here. But if you do, by any chance, overcome your objection to moving out of London, I have a little request to make. Please let me hear of your visit beforehand--so that I may not omit all needful preparations. I know you dislike being troubled with letters (except on business), so I will not write too frequently. Be so good as to take no news for good news, in the intervals. When you <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> to spare, you will write, I hope, and tell me how you and the shop are going on. Emma sends you her love, in which I beg to join." [...] So the letter was expressed, and so it ended.|$|E
50|$|Sisal plants, Agave sisalana, {{consist of}} a rosette of sword-shaped leaves about 1.5 - 2 m tall. Young leaves may <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minute</b> teeth along their margins, but lose them as they mature.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{says the}} soldier, {{as soon as}} he had got over his wonder again, [...] "I would rather sit upon this stool than any I ever saw." [...] And so would I, if I had been in his place, and <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> to think of all that I wanted.|$|R
60|$|He {{turned and}} faced me. He was {{certainly}} paler than he <b>had</b> been <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> ago.|$|R
6000|$|... "But in so doing," [...] said Miss Raybold, [...] "they {{violated}} {{the principles of}} association. Our scheme included mutual confidence as well as self-investigation and assertion. I must admit that Mr. Archibald disappointed me. I think he misunderstood my project. By holding one's self entirely aloof from humanity one encourages self-ignorance. But perhaps our party was somewhat too large--the elements too many and inharmonious--and I {{see no reason why}} we who remain should relinquish our purpose. I believe it will be easier for us to become truly ourselves than when our number was greater, and so I propose that we make no change whatever in our plans; that we live on, for the time agreed upon, exactly as if the Archibalds were here. And now, if you <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> to spare, I would like to read you something I wrote this morning before I left my tent. I was awake during the night, and thought for a long time upon the subject of mental assimilation, the discussion of which we did not finish last evening, and this morning, while my thoughts were fresh, I put them upon paper, and now I would like to read them to you. Isn't there some shady place where we might sit down? There are two camp-chairs; will you kindly place them under this tree?" ...|$|E
50|$|Not here, I said. But my studios {{just around}} the corner from your hotel. If you <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> to spare Ill come and fetch you.|$|E
50|$|The {{season was}} the first to feature the Kiwibank Block Out Live online game, a bingo-style game {{designed}} to be played by viewers watching the show live. It consists of a grid of nine squares, each containing an event or quote from the show. When the event is broadcast, viewers <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> to tap the corresponding square. The first person to unlock all nine squares on a given night wins a $100 gift card.|$|E
60|$|Deane looked away--through {{the cluster}} of palms into the little smoking-room from which he <b>had</b> issued <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> before.|$|R
5000|$|.....I <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> {{to stop in}} to see an {{exhibition}} of war satires and miniatures by Arthur Szyk at the Seligman Galleries on East 57th Street. This exhibition {{is sponsored by the}} Writers' War Board. I know of no other miniaturist doing quite this kind of work. In its way it fights the war against Hitlerism as truly as any of us who cannot actually be on the fighting fronts today.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, it is {{something}} of a recognition," [...] I replied. [...] "Is there anything I can get for you in New York? I don't know how long I shall have to stay--I'll telegraph you when I'm getting back." [...] I kissed her and hurried out to the automobile. As I drove off I saw her still standing in the doorway looking after me.... In the station I <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> to telephone Nancy.|$|R
5000|$|Chop Chop Caveman is an iOS game {{developed}} by Gamerizon and released on November 25, 2010. The game has a Metacritic score of 73% based on 5 critic reviews. NoDpad said [...] "Chop Chop Caveman {{may be the}} best prehistoric platformer since Bonk's Adventure, and the best Chop Chop game yet. [...] " [...] AppSpy wrote [...] "Chop Chop Caveman is a great new platformer that features a 'smart' control system that may not click with some, but shows a lot of potential as an alternative to stiff virtual buttons. [...] " [...] GamePro described the game as [...] "A totally passable platformer that's fun to pull out and play if you only <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> on your hands. [...] " [...] Pocket Gamer UK wrote [...] "An adorable prehistoric romp, Chop Chop Caveman has sharp, modern graphics and clunky, stone age controls. [...] " [...] Slide To Play said [...] "Chop Chop Caveman is graphically sharp, but has primitive controls. [...] " ...|$|E
5000|$|In the post-World War II {{period in}} the United States, fast food chains like McDonald's rapidly gained a {{reputation}} for their cleanliness, fast service, and a child-friendly atmosphere where families on the road could grab a quick meal, or seek {{a break from the}} routine of home cooking. Prior to the rise of the fast food chain restaurant, people generally had a choice between greasy spoon diners where the quality of the food was often questionable and service lacking, or high-end restaurants that were expensive and impractical for families with children. The modern, stream-lined convenience of the fast food restaurant provided a new alternative and appealed to Americans' instinct for ideas and products associated with progress, technology, and innovation. Fast food restaurants rapidly became the eatery [...] "everyone could agree on", with many featuring child-size menu combos, play areas, and whimsical branding campaigns, like the iconic Ronald McDonald, designed to appeal to younger customers. Parents could <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> of peace while children played or amused themselves with the toys included in their Happy Meal. There is a long history of fast food advertising campaigns, many of which are directed at children.|$|E
5000|$|Hill {{later said}} {{he enjoyed the}} {{experience}} of making the film {{but that it was}} tough:I was very proud of the actors in it. It was a tough movie to make, and they put up with a lot. They would probably tell you they put up with a lot from me. Laughs. But they really did it without complaint. And I just thought I was very fortunate to have the cast that I had. Jesus, it was a hard movie to make... I think when you see the movie you can see that this one wasn’t nightclubs in Vegas. But it was just very hard locations to get in there. Very hard to shoot. I remember so many times we’d only <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> to set the camera because the bottom of the swamp would give way. And so, for your camera positions, you had to stage and shoot very quickly in many cases. It just was hard, and the weather was miserable. However, I will say this: If you choose to go make a movie in a swamp in the middle of winter, you probably deserve what you get. Laughs."It was unbelievably tough," [...] said Powers Boothe. [...] "The actors would clamber out of the muck just in time to get back into it. The situation was even harder on the crew. They'd set up a camera platform and it would slowly sink into the bayou. Or with a tripod, one leg would sink. And how can actors hit their marks in two feet of water?... I have to give Walter Hill credit for making the three months as endurable as possible. We didn't lose our senses of humor until late in the shooting. Taking two weeks off at Christmas time helped keep our sanity." ...|$|E
60|$|Jane {{saw that}} an attack {{was going to}} be made upon the party, and hesitated for a moment what to do. The rockets were going up in Mr. Brook's grounds, and she knew she <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> yet. First she ran to the house of James Shepherd. The pitman, who was <b>a</b> sturdy man, <b>had</b> been asleep for the last three hours. She knocked at the door, {{unlocked}} it, and went in.|$|R

60|$|Then {{the mother}} was so terrified and distressed that all sorts of comforting reassurances were required, and the chief object soon became to persuade her to go downstairs and leave Rachel to her bed. And at last the thought of civility and of the many Mrs. Grundys prevailed, and sent her downstairs, {{but there was little}} more comfort for Rachel even in being left to herself--that for which she <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> before most ardently longed.|$|R
