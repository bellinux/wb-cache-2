5|$|Bumblebee {{conservation}} {{is in its}} <b>infancy</b> {{in many parts of}} the world, but with the realization of the important part they play in pollination of crops, efforts are being made to manage farmland better.

5|$|Charles William Beebe {{was born}} in Brooklyn, New York, son of the {{newspaper}} executive Charles Beebe. Although some sources have described him as an only child, he had a younger brother named John who died in <b>infancy.</b> Early in his life, {{his family moved to}} East Orange, New Jersey, where he began to acquire both his fascination with the natural world and his tendency to record everything he saw.

5|$|Cibber and Katherine had 12 {{children}} between 1694 and 1713. Six died in <b>infancy,</b> {{and most of}} the surviving children received short shrift in his will.

She was duly rewarded at his death with most of his estate. His middle daughters, Anne and Elizabeth, went into business. Anne had a shop that sold fine wares and foods, and married John Boultby. Elizabeth had a restaurant near Gray's Inn, and married firstly Dawson Brett, and secondly (after Brett's death) Joseph Marples. His only son to reach adulthood, Theophilus, became an actor at Drury Lane, and was an embarrassment to his father because of his scandalous private life. His other son to survive <b>infancy,</b> James, died in or after 1717 before reaching adulthood. Colley's youngest daughter Charlotte followed in her father's theatrical footsteps, but she fell out with him and her sister Catherine, and she was cut off by the family.|$|E

5|$|Emeric, Stephen's {{only son}} to survive <b>infancy,</b> {{died in an}} {{accident}} in 1031.

On Stephen's order, Vazul was blinded shortly thereafter and his three sonsLevente, Andrew and Béla exiled, which strengthened Peter's right of succession. The King asked Peter {{to take an oath}} respecting the property of his wife, Queen Giselle, suggesting that Peter's relationship with his aunt was tense.|$|E
