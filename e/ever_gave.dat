5|$|As Smith {{began to}} {{establish}} a new side with talents such as Jackie Mudie and Jimmy Armfield, Blackpool posted a second-place finish in 1955–56, though they ended up some 11 points behind champions Manchester United. Matthews believed that the performance he gave in a 3–1 win over Arsenal on the opening day of the season was the finest he <b>ever</b> <b>gave.</b> At the end of the campaign Matthews was made the inaugural winner of the European Footballer of the Year award, having narrowly defeated Alfredo Di Stéfano 47 to 44 in the poll.|$|E

He claimed he showed Gray's patent caveat to Bailey. Wilber also claimed (after Bell arrived in Washington D.C. from Boston) that he showed Gray's caveat to Bell and that Bell paid him $100. Bell claimed they discussed the patent only in general terms, although in a letter to Gray, Bell admitted that he learned some of the technical details. Bell denied in an affidavit that he <b>ever</b> <b>gave</b> Wilber any money.|$|E
25|$|The English {{rock group}} the Beatles toured Germany, Japan and the Philippines between 24 June and 4 July 1966. The {{thirteen}} concerts comprised {{the first stage}} of a world tour that ended with the band's final tour of the United States, in August 1966. The shows in what was then West Germany represented a return to the country where the Beatles had developed as a group before achieving fame in 1963. Those in Japan and the Philippines marked the only live performances that the band <b>ever</b> <b>gave</b> in Asia. The return flight to England included a stopover in Delhi in India. There, the Beatles indulged in two days of sightseeing and shopping for musical instruments while still under the attention of the press and local fans.|$|E

Houchen later said that [...] "it {{was the only time}} I <b>ever</b> <b>gave</b> up... it wasn't the right club because it wasn't going anywhere... I said to Yvonne, 'I'm just going to take the money'". In doing so he rejected moves to Preston North End and Third Division Bury. He quickly regretted the move, and despite getting along well with manager Frank Barlow he found himself hating everything at the club, from the supporters to the Old Showground itself.|$|E
500|$|Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said he {{was enjoying}} the new paper company storyline, but that [...] "Michael Scott Paper Company" [...] was not as funny as [...] "Dream Team", which aired the same day. Sepinwall praised {{particular}} scenes such as Dwight and Andy's competitive duet [...] and Kelly's plan to make Charles want her. She criticized the cramped new office space jokes as being less funny than those in previous episodes. Sepinwall also said the storyline between Jim and Charles was getting repetitive and, [...] "It would help if the writers <b>ever</b> <b>gave</b> Idris Elba something funny to do." [...] Margaret Lions of Entertainment Weekly said, [...] "This episode wasn't {{one of my favorites}} … No bombs, no bits that failed, and by The Offices standards, nothing even particularly cringe worthy. But 'TMSPC' is more groundwork than payoff." [...] She said Dwight's rendition of [...] "Take Me Home, Country Roads" [...] in German was [...] "the absolute funniest moment of the episode".|$|E

500|$|... "Dream Team" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said he {{was enjoying}} the new paper company storyline and that [...] "Dream Team" [...] was funnier than [...] "Michael Scott Paper Company". Sepinwall said the final scene with Michael trying to comfort Pam in the car was a [...] "good payoff" [...] which was well acted by Steve Carell and Jenna Fischer, and [...] "yet another reminder that Michael does know what he's doing some of the time, which means Pam wasn't a complete idiot for following him out the door." [...] He also liked Kevin's struggle with the phones in the beginning, but said the storyline between Jim and Charles was getting repetitive and, [...] "It would help if the writers <b>ever</b> <b>gave</b> Idris Elba something funny to do." [...] Steven Mullen of The Tuscaloosa News called the episode [...] "stellar", said the Charles Miner soccer subplot ended [...] "perfectly" [...] and said, [...] "Watching [...] fears bubble beneath the surface and slowly erode Pam's confidence was a masterwork." ...|$|E

[...] "In Sri Lankan, arular means 'enlightenment from the sunshine' or something", she remarked, [...] "but a friend pointed {{out that it was}} a pun in English – 'a ruler' – which is funny because he is a politician. And my mum always used to say about my father, 'He was so useless, all he <b>ever</b> <b>gave</b> you was his name'. So I turned it around and turned that something into nothing. And at the same time I {{thought it would be a}} good way to find him. If he really was an egomaniac, he'd be looking himself up and he'd get this pop album stealing his name that would turn out to be me, and he'd have to get in touch", a prediction which ultimately came true.) ...|$|E
500|$|McConnell's work {{mainly focused}} on poison and blood analysis, and she testified in many {{criminal}} cases {{as an expert}} witness. Her work often involved determining {{the cause of death}} when poisoning was suspected. In 1930, she investigated the death of a ten-year-old Denver girl; the case was referred to at the time as the city's [...] "most famous and controversial murder case". Although she initially suspected the girl had been poisoned, McConnell discovered crushed glass in the girl's stomach and blood stains in the family car; her testimony led to the sentencing of the girl's stepmother for murder. In 1936, McConnell testified against suspected rapist and murderer Joe Arridy after finding fibers from the bedspread at the murder scene under the suspect's fingernails. (Although Arridy was convicted of murder and executed in 1939, he was granted a posthumous pardon in 2011.) McConnell also discovered that murder victim Georg Obendoerfer had been killed with a lethal dose of arsenic, which led to further investigations confirming that Anna Marie Hahn had killed Obendoerfer, as well as other men in the same way. McConnell testified at Hahn's trial in Cincinnati and Hahn was subsequently convicted and executed. After she was called to Raton, New Mexico as a key witness in a murder trial in 1935, a court reporter for the Raton Range wrote that McConnell [...] "has gained a national reputation ... in her blood analysis work". Additionally, she is thought to be the United States' first female forensic pathologist. Despite working on numerous high-profile, widely publicized cases, McConnell kept her life as private as possible and only <b>ever</b> <b>gave</b> one interview during her career.|$|E

500|$|Peel, having {{concluded}} that the suspension would end his Yorkshire career, signed a contract to play for Accrington Cricket Club. He told a newspaper that he regarded his suspension as unfair, {{that he had been}} given no opportunity to explain, and that he had taken the appointment with Accrington to provide for himself and his family. In 1900, he told Cricket magazine that, before his suspension, he had been bedridden for three weeks {{as a result of an}} injury he suffered while batting, that he played against Middlesex with some success and was then suspended without any explanation. He later said of the incident: [...] " [...] put his arm around me and escorted me off the field and out of Yorkshire cricket. What a gentleman". The journalist Harry Pearson suggests that this was [...] "either very gracious, or exceedingly sarcastic." [...] Hawke later described Peel's sacking as [...] "the most decisive action of my whole career... It had to be done for the sake of discipline and the good of cricket. Nothing <b>ever</b> <b>gave</b> me so much pain." [...] At the time, Hawke believed these events cost Yorkshire the County Championship, but the team had only two more games to play in that season's competition, and it was mathematically impossible for them to win. Hirst told Thompson that Hawke was always sorry that Peel had to be sacked, and that whenever the pair met afterwards, they remained friends and that neither bore the other any animosity. Although Peel considered himself indispensable, the following year he was replaced by Wilfred Rhodes, who remained in the team until 1930 and took 4,184 first-class wickets. Peel remained popular with the people of Morley in the aftermath of his dismissal, and they supported him rather than believing the reports.|$|E

2500|$|Tobe Liston inflicted whippings {{so severe}} on Sonny that the scars were still visible decades later.

Helen Baskin moved to St. Louis, Missouri, with some of her children, leaving Liston—aged around 13, {{according}} to his later reckonings—in Arkansas with his father. Sonny thrashed the pecans from his brother-in-law's tree and sold them in Forrest City. With the proceeds, he traveled to St. Louis and reunited {{with his mother and}} siblings. Liston tried going to school but quickly left after jeers about his illiteracy; the only employment he could obtain was sporadic and exploitative.|$|E
2500|$|Cline {{would become}} one of West's biggest career inspirations.

Then cast a spell over them. If you can't do it with feeling, then don't." [...] In their early days in Nashville, West and her family would often not have enough to pay the rent or buy the week's groceries, so Cline would hire her to help with her wardrobe and West's husband Bill to play in her band. Cline even offered to help pay West's rent or buy groceries when she and Bill were struggling to stay in Nashville.|$|E
