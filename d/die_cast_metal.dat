50|$|As of 2014, an {{estimated}} 80% of all gearing produced worldwide {{is produced by}} net shape molding.Molded gearing is usually either powder metallurgy or plastic. Many gears are done when they leave the mold (including injection molded plastic and <b>die</b> <b>cast</b> <b>metal</b> gears), but powdered metal gears require sintering and sand castings or investment castings require gear cutting or other machining to finish them. The {{most common form of}} gear cutting is hobbing, but gear shaping, milling, and broaching also exist. 3D printing as a production method is expanding rapidly. For metal gears in the transmissions of cars and trucks, the teeth are heat treated to make them hard and more wear resistant while leaving the core soft and tough. For large gears that are prone to warp, a quench press is used.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the lower}} {{pressures}} and temperatures required to <b>die</b> <b>cast</b> semi-solid <b>metal</b> the <b>die</b> material {{does not need to}} be as exotic. Often graphite or softer stainless steels may be used. Even non-ferrous dies can be used for one time shots. Because of this the process can be applied to rapid prototyping needs and mass production. This also allows for the casting of high melting point metals, such as tool steel and stellite, if a higher temperature die material is used. Other advantages include: easily automated, consistent, production rates are equal to or better than <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> rates, no air entrapment, low shrinkage rates, and a uniform microstructure.|$|R

50|$|The earlier high {{piece and}} high detail kits were {{referred}} to as the Classic line. Later a less assembly intensive line appeared which was called the Prestige line of cars. Classic kits were known for their high piece count and incredible detail such as working brake systems, engines with rotating crankshafts and moving pistons, windows that moved up and down, steering that operated, and when a tiny key was inserted into the dashboard the headlights lit up. Classic kits faithfully represented mostly 1930s cars from Fiat, Alfa Romeo, Bugatti, Mercedes-Benz, and Rolls Royce. Prestige kits were most often <b>die</b> <b>cast</b> <b>metal</b> bodies and contained about 500 parts. They featured working suspension and opening doors and detailed engines. These kits were designed to provide attractive models that could be built with little difficulty. These were mostly of Ferraris such as the Testarossa and F40, along with a few Porsches. A third line existed which was called Pocher Truck. This consisted of two Volvo trucks using the same assembly method as Prestige - mainly press fit parts with superb detailing. Four separate engine kits were produced that featured the engines from Ferrari Testarossa, Ferrari F40, Volvo, and Bugatti. Of these four kits the Bugatti was the most complex as it had a moving crankshaft and pistons.|$|E

50|$|Crescent Toys was a British toy {{manufacturing}} company in operation from 1922 to 1980. It manufactured lead hollow-cast figures and animals, <b>die</b> <b>cast</b> <b>metal</b> vehicles, toy guns, hollow cast and later plastic figures and toy soldiers of various historical periods. The firm {{was founded by}} Henry Eagles and Arthur Schneider and was located at 67, DeBeauvoir Crescent, Kingston Road, London.Henry George Eagles was one of seven children born of William Eagles, a lifebelt maker, and his wife Emily. At {{some point in the}} 1930s, one of Henry's brothers, Arthur, joined the Company under the name of Mr. Harvey to avoid suspicion of nepotism and worked as a foreman in the lead casting shop. It was understood that during {{the early part of the}} second World War, Arthur Schneider went to America because of the connotation with Germany that his surname gave. Henry's health deteriorated and Arthur (Harvey) carried more of the responsibility of running the factory aided by Doris Eagles one of Henry's four children. Henry, known to most of us as 'Harry' died in 1942 and his brother, my father, known as Mr. Harvey, continued to manage the business, which by now was manufacturing munitions' parts. At the end of the war, Henry's two sons, Harry and Ernie, who had served in the armed forces, joined Crescent along with their younger brother Frank and they together with their sister Doris, the Company Secretary held the controlling interest.|$|E
50|$|A {{large number}} of coachbuilders {{produced}} bodies for the Royal Tiger, {{most of them were}} standard buses or coaches, at the time underfloor engined single-deck buses with up to 45 seats generally had a single front entrance opposite the driver on the front overhang, often secured with a power-operated folding door; industry-standard coaches a central entrance in mid-wheelbase, generally with a manual sliding door, 41 seats was the general coach maximum, that said, there was a much greater variety of body styles and builders than today. Buses were built on Royal Tiger PSU1 by Brush, Crossley, Duple, East Lancashire Coachbuilders, Eastern Coach Works, Heaver, Metro Cammell Weymann, Massey Brothers, Northern Counties, Park Royal, Roe and others, whilst coaches were built by (among others) Alexander, Associated Coach Builders, Beccols, Bellhouse-Hartwell, Duple, Eastern Coach Works, Harrington, Metalcraft (who bodied the first two production coaches with 43 seat centre-entrance bodies for Don Everall of Wolverhampton), Mann, Egerton & Co., Plaxton, Samlesbury Engineering, Trans-United, Willowbrook and Windover. Perhaps the most famous body on the Royal Tiger coach was the Burlingham Seagull, but Dinky Toys chose the Duple Roadmaster body for their contemporary version, a style that was considerably rarer in full size than were 1:76 scale <b>die</b> <b>cast</b> <b>metal</b> models of it on railway layouts and in toy cupboards. Leyland’s own 44-seat bus and 41-seat coach bodies were built on a {{large number of}} Royal Tigers until Leyland's in-house coachbuilders were locked-out at the conclusion of an unofficial industrial dispute in 1954 bringing Leyland bus and coach bodies to an end. Although the 8 ft width was the majority choice most operators chose the vacuum-servo braking system, which was at its limits coping with a fully laden vehicle with an eight-ton unladen weight.|$|E
5000|$|Features: - {{the round}} Yamaha logo on the {{headstock}} {{is not a}} decal, it's a <b>die</b> <b>cast</b> <b>metal</b> piece with chrome tuning forks (the Yamaha logo) raised above a black background. You can turn it with your fingers on my guitar but it doesn't come off - you can also see in the picture that the Yamaha brand name appears on the neck plate. This is also chrome and black but is a stamping not a casting. And this isn't actually a neck plate because it doesn't hold the neck on. If you remove the four screws this plate comes off, you will then see the actual neck plate which has four larger screws holding the neck on. The neck plate has a rectangular [...] "window" [...] in it {{to allow you to}} access the truss rod through a hole through the body {{into the back of the}} neck (that's right, the truss is accessed through the back of the neck). - All three pickups are identical. They have adjustable pole piece screws. The black and silver areas that you see are actually the tops of the pickup bobbins themselves. The black and silver areas are covered by a domed clear plastic piece. I took the guitar apart a few years ago to give it a good cleaning. I found that the pickups are not held in place with springs at the height adjustment screws like normal pickups, but instead had a large foam rubber block under the body of each pickup. The fretboard is quite thin. Thin enough that the side dots are actually located on the split line between the fretboard material and the wood of the neck. The guitar's serial number is stamped directly into the fretboard between two of the lower frets. - Yamaha was obviously proud of this guitar, and put their name and logo all over it. Besides the Yamaha name on the tuning machines, it has the Yamaha decal and die cast logo on the headstock, the name and logo on the neck plate and the name and logo are molded into the bridge pickup ring between the two bridge pickups. - The SG2 and SG3 were Yamaha's first electric guitar models, and finish details (as described above) are amazing for a 1965 Japanese guitar. If I lay it down next to my Strat, the Strat looks like a bargain basement model by comparison. Later 1960s models in Yamaha's SG series have far cruder appointments. - As was already noted, the bridge has roller saddles and each saddle is height adjustable. The bridge also has the normal coarse height adjustment screws on each end. There are two sheet metal springs on the ends of the bridge pinching the saddles together so they don't move side-to-side. - The guitar shown here has either a metal or black plastic nut, mine is white plastic. There is, of course, a zero fret. - The string tree is also a good quality chrome plated die casting, not a metal stamping like many guitars of the period. - The main knobs are chrome-plated metal with plastic skirts. As for the roller controls, the mysterious 3rd thumbwheel nearest to the bridge pickup is a balance control for the two bridge pickups. This functions whether the slide switch is in the up or down position. - The remaining two thumbwheels are just like their Fender counterparts; they're a volume control and a tone control that override the main volume and tone controls when the slide switch is in the up position. [...] Supposedly most of them were sold in Japan, and only a few were exported to the US.|$|E

40|$|Soldering is {{a unique}} casting defect {{associated}} with <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> or <b>metal</b> mold <b>casting</b> of aluminum alloys. It occurs when molten aluminum sticks or solders {{the surface of the}} die steel and remains there after the ejection of the casting, causing a surface defect and dimensional inaccuracy of the castings and increased machine downtime. Soldering occurs easily when a bare die steel mold is used for <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> of aluminum alloys. When molten aluminum comes in contact with the die steel at a temperature higher than a critical temperature, the iron and aluminum atoms diffuse into each other, forming a series of intermetallic phases and a liquid aluminum-rich fcc phase. This liquid phase exists between intermetallic phases. On cooling, the liquid fcc phase solidifies on the intermetallic phases and grows into the casting, resulting in soldering. The critical temperature is the eutectic temperature near the aluminum corner of the phase diagram. If the die is protected using a nonreactive ceramic coating, soldering starts at locations where local coating failure occurs. Molten aluminum comes into contact with die steel through the coating failure locations and eats into the steel matrix, forming small pits. As these small pits grow, the coating is gradually removed and soldering becomes more severe. Details of die soldering step on a bare steel die and on a coated die material are discussed...|$|R
