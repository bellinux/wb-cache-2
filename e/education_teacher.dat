40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was twofold. First, the study was {{undertaken}} to determine an accurate picture of teacher attrition in Wisconsin based on information from the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction 2 ̆ 7 s (DPI) data base. Secondly, the study sought to discover causes of teacher attrition in Wisconsin and to determine whether special education and regular <b>education</b> <b>teachers</b> left for similar reasons. The study determined attrition rates of regular and special <b>education</b> <b>teachers</b> over a three year period (1984 - 1987) using the DPI data base. A survey was then sent to a random sample of 400 <b>teachers</b> (100 regular <b>education</b> <b>teachers</b> and 100 special <b>education</b> <b>teachers</b> who remained in teaching; 100 regular <b>education</b> <b>teachers</b> and 100 special <b>education</b> <b>teachers</b> who left teaching). Principal components analysis and Alpha factoring was used to reduce the 37 variables included in the survey to thirteen factors. On the basis of these factors, discriminant analysis was used to determine whether accurate predictions could be made as to whether a teacher left or remained in teaching. This research considered several hypotheses about teacher attrition. The first nine hypotheses differences in attrition rates of special and regular <b>education</b> <b>teachers,</b> teachers with emergency or full certification, teachers in rural and urban areas, teachers certified at the elementary, middle school, or secondary levels, teacher age, teachers certified in each subject area, teachers with graduate or undergraduate training, experienced and non-experienced regular <b>education</b> <b>teachers,</b> and special <b>education</b> <b>teachers</b> with and without regular education experience. These hypotheses were tested using data from the DPI data base and the survey. Other hypotheses dealt with conditions of the teaching profession such as salary; administrative, parental, and professional support; recognition of and feedback on job performance; vacation time; duties required outside of the classroom; opportunity to work on curriculum development; and autonomy. These hypotheses were tested using the results of the survey. Findings indicated significantly higher attrition rates for special <b>education</b> <b>teachers,</b> teachers on emergency certification, teachers under the age of 35, teachers at the secondary level, music and foreign language teachers, teachers with undergraduate training, and regular <b>education</b> <b>teachers</b> with less than six years experience.

A select sample of four-hundred twenty-three Industrial <b>Education</b> <b>teachers</b> representing over twenty occupational areas was chosen as the population for the study.

The study focused on obtaining answers to the five following questions: 1. How familiar are Industrial <b>Education</b> <b>teachers</b> in Utah with the base units of the Metric System? 2. Which subject area teachers have the least understanding of the base units of the Metric System? 3.

The analysis of the data and the basic findings of the study warranted the following conclusions: 1. Industrial <b>Education</b> <b>teachers</b> in Utah are in need of instruction in various portions of the Metric System of measurement. Electronics teachers as a group, do not need further instruction, since electronic s is already taught using metric terminology and measurement. 2. Woods teachers do not see the necessity for metric measurement in their occupation, nor do they see economic advantages in the conversion. 3. Curriculum guide s in Utah have been of little value to Industrial <b>Education</b> <b>teachers</b> in Utah, as sources of metric information. 4. Most subject area textbooks are not written in Metric terminology and are of little value to Industrial <b>Education</b> <b>teachers</b> as sources of metric information. 5.

40|$|In {{the field}} of education, the roles of special and general <b>education</b> <b>teachers</b> are {{changing}} regularly. Special <b>education</b> <b>teachers</b> have multiple responsibilities, including tracking the students on their caseloads.

This makes the communication and collaboration quite difficult. Collaboration is necessary for all teachers {{to meet the needs of}} students who receive special education services. 	A review of existing literature revealed there are not many studies conducted on effective collaboration among special and general <b>education</b> <b>teachers.</b> The attitudes teachers form about collaboration, time, understanding of special education and the process can truly influence collaboration as a whole. Many teachers believe they do not have the time or the resources to effectively collaborate with special <b>education</b> <b>teachers.</b> A possible solution to this problem is the creation of a resource binder. Many districts may already have a system in place to assist with the time, information, and resources needed to collaborate; some may even have a resource binder in place. 	A possible solution to the views general <b>education</b> <b>teachers</b> have of collaboration, time, and understanding of special education is to create a resource binder, which addresses each.
