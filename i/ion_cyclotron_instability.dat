The linear dispersion relations for the <b>ion</b> <b>cyclotron</b> <b>instability</b> (electron and ion collisions) are derived. Analytical solutions to the dispersion relation are obtained in three limits: collisionless; weakly collisional; and collisional. In addition, the linear dispersion relation is solved numerically, using parameters typical of the high-latitude bottomside ionosphere. It is pointed out that the linear growth rates in the bottomside collisional regime can be of the same order as the corresponding topside collisionless growth rates.

Each of these instabilities are dominant in different ranges of the wavelength along the magnetic field. The linearized dispersion equation is solved within the limits of long and short waves along the magnetic field where effects of electrons and ions, respectively, are dominant in the development of these instabilities.

The model is compared with recent observations with good agreement between the theory and observations, especially for an emission source located at a distance L less than 5.

40|$|Twelve proton {{velocity}} distribution {{functions as}} measured for different solar wind speeds by the plasma analyzer at the Helios spacecraft are modeled analytically by a superposition of two bi-Maxwellians. The stability of these distributions is investigated by solving the linear dispersion equation for parallel propagation of both left- and right-hand polarized modes. Due {{to the temperature}} anisotropy of the main proton component {{the presence of the}} resonant left-hand <b>ion</b> <b>cyclotron</b> <b>instability</b> is found to be typical for high-speed streams and is independent of an ion beam. The results indicate that the ratio of the beam density to total particle density and the beam drift velocity are generally close to the threshold values necessary to drive a highly unstable nonresonant right-hand mode. This instability is found for one proton distribution and is a consequence of the beam particles.

The plasma consisting of resonant and non-resonant particles has been considered. It is assumed that the resonant particles participate in energy exchange with the wave, whereas non-resonant particles support the oscillatory motion of the wave. The effect of ion beam velocity on the dispersion relation, growth rate, parallel and perpendicular resonant energy of the EMIC wave with general loss-cone distribution function in hot anisotropic plasma is described by particle aspect approach. The effect of beam anisotropy and beam density on electromagnetic <b>ion</b> <b>cyclotron</b> <b>instabilities</b> is investigated. Growth length is derived for EMIC waves in hot anisotropic plasma. It is found {{that the effect of}} the ion beam is to reduce the energy of transversely heated ions, whereas the thermal anisotropy of the background plasma acts as a source of free energy for the EMIC wave and enhances the growth rate. It is observed that ion beam velocity opposite to the wave propagation and its density reduces the growth rate and enhance the reduction in perpendicularly heated ions energy. The effect of ion beam anisotropy on EMIC wave is also discussed. These results are determined for auroral acceleration region. It is also found that the EMIC wave emissions occur by extracting energy of perpendicularly heated ions in the presence of an up flowing ion beam...|$|R
40|$|The proton {{temperature}} anisotropy in {{the solar}} wind {{is known to be}} constrained by the theoretical thresholds for pressure anisotropy-driven instabilities. Here we use approximately 1 million independent measurements of gyroscale magnetic fluctuations {{in the solar}} wind to show {{for the first time that}} these fluctuations are enhanced along the temperature anisotropy thresholds of the mirror, proton oblique firehose, and <b>ion</b> <b>cyclotron</b> <b>instabilities.</b> In addition, the measured magnetic compressibility is enhanced at high plasma beta (β_∥≳ 1) along the mirror instability threshold but small elsewhere, consistent with expectations of the mirror mode. The power in this frequency (the 'dissipation') range is often considered to be driven by the solar wind turbulent cascade, an interpretation which should be qualified in light of the present results. In particular, we show that the short wavelength magnetic fluctuation power is a strong function of collisionality, which relaxes the temperature anisotropy away from the instability conditions and reduces correspondingly the fluctuation power.

Such ULF waves have been previously suggested {{as the source}} of ion precipitation leading to Jovian aurorae. The peaks of the wave spectra are closely related to the <b>ion</b> <b>cyclotron</b> frequencies, which is evidence of the waves being <b>ion</b> <b>cyclotron</b> waves (ICWs). Analysis of the dispersion relation using a multicomponent density model shows that at high latitudes (approximately 30 deg), peak frequencies of the waves fall into L mode branches of guided or unguided ICWs. Near the equator, in addition to the ICWs below f cO(2 +), there are strong signals at approximately 10 Hz which require an unexpectedly large energetic ion temperature anistropy to be explained by the excitation of either convective or nonconvective <b>ion</b> <b>cyclotron</b> <b>instabilities.</b> Their generation mechanism remains open for the future study. Evaluation of the Poynting vector and the dispersion relation analysis suggest that the waves near the equator had a small wave angle relative to the magnetic field, while those observed at high latitudes were more oblique. The polarization of the waves below f cH(+) is more random than that of the whistler mode waves, but left-hand-polarized components of the waves can still be seen.

Yet, whether a collisionless faster-than-Coulomb energy transfer mechanism exists in two-temperature accretion flows is still an open question. We study the physics of electron heating during the growth of ion velocity-space instabilities, by means of multi-dimensional fully-kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. A background large-scale compression — embedded in a novel form of the PIC equations — continuously amplifies the field. This constantly drives a pressure anisotropy P ⊥> P‖, due to the adiabatic invariance of the particle magnetic moments. We find that, for ion plasma beta values β 0 i ∼ 5 − 30 appropriate for the midplane of low-luminosity accretion flows (here, β 0 i is the ratio of ion thermal pressure to magnetic pressure), mirror modes dominate if the electron-to-proton temperature ratio is T 0 e/T 0 i & 0. 2, whereas for T 0 e/T 0 i. 0. 2 the <b>ion</b> <b>cyclotron</b> <b>instability</b> triggers the growth of strong Alfvén-like waves, that pitch-angle scatter the ions to maintain marginal stability.

We study 19 flares observed by RHESSI (Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager) with strong spectral breaks at energies around a few deka-keV, that cannot be explained by isotropic albedo or non-uniform ionization alone. We identify these breaks at the HXR peak time, but we obtain 8 s-cadence spectra of the entire impulsive phase. Electrons with an initially power-law distribution and a sharp low-energy cutoff lose energy through return-current losses until they reach the thick target, where they lose their remaining energy through collisions. Our main results are: (1) The return-current collisional thick-target model (RCCTTM) provides acceptable fits for spectra with strong breaks. (2) Limits on the plasma resistivity are derived from the fitted potential drop and deduced electron-beam flux density, assuming the return-current is a drift current in the ambient plasma. These resistivities are typically 2 - 3 orders of magnitude higher than the Spitzer resistivity at the fitted temperature, and provide a test for the adequacy of classical resistivity and the stability of the return current. (3) Using the upper limit of the low-energy cutoff, the return current is always stable to the generation of ion acoustic and electrostatic <b>ion</b> <b>cyclotron</b> <b>instabilities</b> when the electron temperature is lower than 9 times the ion temperature. (4) In most cases the return current is most likely primarily carried by runaway electrons from the tail of the thermal distribution rather than the bulk drifting thermal electrons.
