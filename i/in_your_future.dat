If you like to take into account <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>Futures</b> Map various what if type scenarios you seldom manage just with two basic contrasting scenarios. However, in order to be understandable to lay people it is seldom reasonable to construct more than four scenarios. If the criterion 5 is the main focus two contrasting scenarios might be enough.|$|R

6000|$|Burns's correspondence, {{generally}} {{collected and}} publish'd since his death, gives wonderful glints into both the amiable and weak (and worse than weak) {{parts of his}} portraiture, habits, good and bad luck, ambition and associations. His letters to Mrs. Dunlop, Mrs. McLehose, (Clarinda,) Mr. Thompson, Dr. Moore, Robert Muir, Mr. Cunningham, Miss Margaret Chalmers, Peter Hill, Richard Brown, Mrs. Riddel, Robert Ainslie, and Robert Graham, afford valuable lights and shades to the outline, and with numerous others, help to a touch here, and fill-in there, of poet and poems. There are suspicions, it is true, of [...] "the Genteel Letter-Writer," [...] with scraps and words from [...] "the Manual of French Quotations," [...] and, in the love-letters, some hollow mouthings. Yet we wouldn't on any account lack the letters. A full and true portrait is always what is wanted; veracity at every hazard. Besides, do we not all see by this time {{that the story of}} Burns, even for its own sake, requires the record of the whole and several, with nothing left out? Completely and every point minutely told out its fullest, explains and justifies itself--(as perhaps almost any life does.) He is very close to the earth. He pick'd up his best words and tunes directly from the Scotch home-singers, but tells Thompson they would not please his, T.'s, [...] "learn'd lugs," [...] adding, [...] "I call them simple--you would pronounce them silly." [...] Yes, indeed; the idiom was undoubtedly his happiest hit. Yet Dr. Moore, in 1789, writes to Burns, [...] "If I were to offer an opinion, it would be that <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>future</b> productions you should abandon the Scotch stanza and dialect, and adopt the measure and language of modern English poetry"! ...|$|E

Citizens of Rome, patricians, and soldiers all! What we must look for <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>future</b> ruler is valour in the face of death, coolness and intrepidity in the sight of danger. These qualities, which grace your present Cæsar, must be transmitted to his successor through Dea Flavia, the divine, and by a father who has given signal proof of his virtues. I have enjoined the Augusta Dea Flavia to bestow her hand on him who above all is worthy to be her lord. To this has she consented and to-day will she make her choice, and herewith do I call on you patricians who aspire to her hand to enter the lists in her honour. Give a proof of your valour, of your intrepidity, of your courage! Show that you are as valiant as the lion, as wary as the snake. Descend into the arena now, unarmed save for the hands which the gods have given you, and thus engage that unconquered monster in single combat! An even chance of life is given you!
