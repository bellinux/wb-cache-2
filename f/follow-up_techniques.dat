30|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to perform a {{systematic}} review of the literature of the epidemiology and management of tibial eminence fractures in the paediatric population. Unfortunately, there are no level one studies at the present time on this topic, so the conclusions are based solely on the case series presented in the literature. In addition, there are widely varied reports of principles of treatment, treatment methods, outcome measures, rehabilitation and length of follow-up. Due to the retrospective nature of most case series, these factors within the same paper were often varied. Nine of the case series reported findings from clinical follow-up alone [2, 3, 4, 8, 18, 19, 22, 25, 37, 38].

We compared MR angiography with {{digital subtraction angiography}} (DSA) as a <b>follow-up</b> <b>technique</b> {{for the detection of}} aneurysmal remnant cavities and arterial patency in patients treated for intracranial aneurysms with Guglielmi detachable coils (GDCs). METHODS: In 20 consecutive patients, follow-up MR angiography and routine intra-arterial cerebral angiography were performed on the same day 1 to 7 months (mean, 4. 5 months) after embolization with GDCs. MR angiographic data were postprocessed for subvolume maximum intensity projections centered on the region of the treated aneurysm. Hard copies of both imaging studies were interpreted independently in a blinded fashion to record and compare remnant cavities, location of residual flow, and adjacent arterial narrowing, using DSA as the standard of reference. The interpreters also established an occlusion grade for the treated aneurysms as evidenced on DSA images and evaluated MR angiograms for artifactual effects.

We use the individual photometry in each bandpass {{as well as the}} colors of KOI 565 and other nearby stars to determine that the source of the transit signal initially detected by Kepler is not due to a super-Earth-size planet around KOI 565. Instead, we find the source to be a background eclipsing binary star located ∼ 15 arcsec to the North of KOI 565. We discuss future prospects for using high-precision multi-color photometry from the GTC to determine whether additional Kepler planet candidates have a planetary nature or are instead false positives (e. g., foreground or background eclipsing binaries or hierarchical triple systems).

40|$|Ultrasound (US) is a {{well-established}} screening tool for detection of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) {{and is currently}} recommended not only for those with a relevant family history but for all men and high-risk women older than 65 years of age. The advent of minimally invasive endovascular techniques {{in the treatment of}} AAAs (EVAR) has increased the need for repeat imaging especially in the post-operative period. Nevertheless, preoperative planning, intraoperative execution and postoperative surveillance all mandate accurate imaging. While CTA and angiography have dominated the field, repeatedly exposing patients to the deleterious effects of cumulative radiation and intravenous nephrotoxic contrast, ultrasound technology has significantly evolved over the past decade. In addition to standard color duplex US, 2 D, 3 D or 4 D contrast enhanced US modalities are revolutionizing AAA management and postoperative surveillance. This technology can accurately measure AAA diameter and volume and most importantly it can detect endoleaks post EVAR with high sensitivity and specificity. 4 D contrast enhanced US can even provide hemodynamic information about the branch vessels following fenestrated EVARs. The need for experienced US operators and accredited vascular labs is mandatory to guarantee the reliability of the results. This review article presents a comprehensive overview of the literature on the state-of-art US imaging in AAA management, including post EVAR <b>follow-up,</b> <b>techniques</b> and diagnostic accuracy...|$|E

40|$|UnrestrictedI {{describe}} {{methods for}} the detection of brain activation and functional connectivity in cortically constrained maps of current density computed from magnetoencephalography (MEG) data using multivariate statistical analysis. I apply time-frequency (wavelet) analysis to individual epochs to produce dynamic images of brain signal power on the cerebral cortex in multiple time-frequency bands, and I form observation matrices by putting together the power from all frequency bands and all trials. To detect changes in brain activity, I fit these observations into separate multivariate linear models for each time band and cortical location with experimental conditions as predictor variables; the resulting Roy’s maximum statistic maps are thresholded for significance using permutation tests and the maximum statistic approach. A source is considered significant if it exceeds a statistical threshold, which is chosen to control the familywise error rate, or the probability of at least one false positive, across the cortical surface. As <b>follow-up</b> <b>techniques</b> to identify individual frequencies that contribute significantly to experimental effects, I further describe protected F-tests and linear discriminant analysis. To detect functional interactions in the brain, I take these observations and compute the canonical correlation between a chosen reference voxel and every other voxel in the brain. The canonical correlation maps are also thresholded for significance, but here I use parametric asymptotic approximations. Based on collinearity properties of the vectors associated to the canonical correlations, I implement procedures to discard voxels whose interaction with the reference is due to linear mixing, and describe approximate F-tests to identify individual frequencies that contribute significantly to detected interactions. I evaluate these multivariate approaches both on simulated data and experimental data from a MEG visuomotor task study.; My results indicate that Roy’s maximum root is more powerful than univariate approaches in detecting experimental effects when correlations exist between power across frequency bands; as for canonical correlation analysis, I find that it detects experimental effects, allowing the simultaneous evaluation of several possible combinations of cross-frequency interactions in a single test...|$|E
40|$|Determination of the personality’s {{psychological}} {{resources that}} ensure its resilience to {{negative effects of}} the social environment is a priority problem in modern society, science, and education, since we currently see {{a sharp increase in}} the number of factors that affect psychological hardiness and security. One of these is intensification of violent and aggressive forms of interaction in educational institutions. Such manifestations are especially dangerous in schools, since, by virtue of their age-specific features, students are the most vulnerable and they subsequently translate the acquired values and behaviors to society as a whole. The goal of this empirical study was to identify teenagers’ psychological resources that determine their resilience to various forms of psychological violence in the educational environment. The study covered four St. Petersburg high schools, with 437 teenagers aged from 16. 5 to 17 (189 boys and 248 girls). A questionnaire was developed to divide the subjects into groups with high and low levels of protection (security) against psychological violence in the educational environment. The questionnaire lists forms of psychological violence in the educational environment (identified by theoretical review) that can occur in interpersonal communication between peers and between teachers and students. The respondents evaluated each item of the questionnaire in accordance with the proposed scale of frequency with which each form of violence occurred. Theoretical analysis determined that psychological violence is traumatic for the adolescent personality’s cognitive, emotional, and behavioral spheres. The teenagers’ psychological resources of resilience to violence in the educational environment were identified with the aid of psychodiagnostic methods addressing each of them. Our study allows us to conclude that the resources that ensure the teenager’s resilience to the negative effect of psychological violence in the educational environment are: satisfaction with oneself, accepting oneself as a personality with positive and socially desirable characteristics; high level of self-control, well- developed ability to behave in an acceptable way whatever the circumstances; openness and goodwill, self-confidence; perception of the surrounding world as friendly and generous, which gives rise to friendly behavior; holistic perception of the world, experiencing the present moment in one’s life in its entirety, striving for personal development and self-improvement; independence of values and behavior from external factors; significance of such values as achievement, self-development, and high financial position, in combination with a priority on learning and education; explanation as a typical mechanism of psychological protection, search for a reasonable basis for justifying behavior and actions as well as impulsive acts; low level of anxiety, aggressiveness, and rigidity. The results obtained can be useful for researching the resource-oriented approach to psychology, and also for the development of <b>follow-up</b> <b>techniques</b> for ensuring the safety of the educational environment, preventing all forms of violence in interpersonal interaction between students and teachers...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} elementary teacher education programs within the State of Utah, to describe those parts of each program specifically designed to prepare prospective elementary school teachers for teaching social studies, and to determine the attitudes and opinions of various groups concerning the adequacy of the programs. This study was of descriptive research design. The subjects were selected to include all prospective 1967 graduates in elementary education in the state of Utah (a total of 603), all 1966 - 67 first-year elementary school teachers who had graduated from a Utah university or college (a total of 511), and a faculty respondent from each Utah university and college preparing elementary school teachers (a total of 6). The questionnaire was selected as the instrument to be used in the collection of basic data in this descriptive research. A preliminary questionnaire was constructed utilizing Guidelines for the Preparation of Elementary Social Studies Teachers (National Council for the SocialStudies, 1965) as the basic document for the identification of the several items. The questionnaire was submitted to experts in the field of social studies and teacher education for their comments and suggestions. The preliminary questionnaire was subsequently expanded to its final form. Appropriate mailing and <b>follow-up</b> <b>techniques</b> were used in administering the questionnaire. Three follow-up contacts yielded the following total respondent returns: prospective graduates, 305 respondents, 58 per cent; first-year elementary school teachers, 345 respondents, 68 per cent; and faculty representatives of the universities and colleges, 6 respondents, 100 per cent. Two different techniques were used to substantiate the data received in this study. One technique utilized a randomly selected population of 21 non-respondents in a follow-up survey 9 months after the initial contact. A second technique was concerned with respondent and nonrespondent stratification analysis. Both of these techniques and their resultant findings supported the utilization of data gathered on the original questionnaire return. Findings indicate that programs of Utah universities and colleges preparing elementary school teachers for teaching social studies are varied and different. There is little uniformity among the universities and colleges regarding these programs. Other important findings suggest that (1) sixty per cent of the graduates completing programs of preparation in elementary education within the state of Utah enroll in a social studies methods course; (2) most students enrolling in a social studies methods course rate their preparation for teaching elementary school social studies as 2 ̆ 2 moderate 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 little 2 ̆ 2 preparation; (3) university and college faculty representatives largely believe the methods courses are 2 ̆ 2 very greatly 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 greatly 2 ̆ 2 preparing their graduates to teach elementary school social studies; (4) students and former students report areas emphasized in the social studies methods courses as centering around 2 ̆ 2 Unit Structure 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 and related areas, they also reported 2 ̆ 2 Critical Thinking 2 ̆ 2 as an area of emphasis; (5) in the social sciences, prospective elementary school teachers are completing the greatest number of hours of course work in history, psychology, and geography, with the average student completing less than 1. 5 hours of course work in any one of the following disciplines of anthropology, philosophy, general social science, and economics; and (6) students and former students believe courses best preparing them for teaching social studies to be those social science courses in which they complete the most hours of course work. It is concluded that the staff of the department or division of elementary education at each of the six institutions of higher learning within the state is primarily responsible for determining the program for preparing elementary school teachers for teaching social studies.

40|$|Objective: An {{end-to-end}} nerve {{repair site}} always has {{the risk of}} rupture and nerve healing failure. In observing the nerve healing site and nerve anastomosis after surgery, here, a new simple and cost-effective technique, and ldquo;Nerve Repair Site Marking and rdquo; (NRSM), is defined. Methods: During primary or secondary nerve repair, to see {{the continuity of the}} repair site, a new technique was employed - NRSM. After coaptation of the nerve at any site of the body and when repairing under tension, 1 cm proximal and 1 cm distal of the suture site, the epineurium was marked with a titanium hemoclip. During the first 6 weeks post-surgery, X-rays of the repair site were taken every week and the distance between the hemoclips was measured. Results: Since 2006, in 23 patients, 25 nerves underwent end-to-end repair (brachial plexus and peripheral nerves), was conducted under tension and if there was the risk of rupture of the repair site, NRSM was employed. All patients were followed up with X-ray of the repair site every week, especially during the first 4 weeks {{and at the end of}} 6 weeks. If the patients lived far away from the clinic, they sent their repair site X-rays. Only one patient had rupture of the repair site, and it was just after surgery and repaired immediately. Conclusion: To get the best results following end-to-end nerve repair, nerve continuity must continued, though there is always the risk of rupture at the repair site. As ultrasonography and MRI can be utilized to examine the repair site, they are not helpful in brachial plexus repairs, are expensive and can be time-consuming when employed with peripheral nerves.

However physiotherapy has its limitations: 30 % of {{women do not}} improve at all and only 10 to 20 % of women are totally dry after treatment. In case of failure or insufficient response, surgery must be considered. Until recently, {{the gold standard for}} the treatment of urinary incontinence was the "Burch" procedure. However the surgical approach has been considerably modified since the introduction by Ulmsten in 1995 of the tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) and more recently of the "Uratape". Short and mid-term results of the TVT are very encouraging with about 85 % "dry patients" at five years <b>follow-up.</b> This <b>technique</b> can also be used with good results in patients with a low urethral pressure (< 20 cm H 2 O). Of course the superiority of TVT over other "classical techniques" must be confirmed by randomized comparative studies. English AbstractJournal ArticleReviewinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Purpose The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} clinical and radiographic outcome of patients treated with a modified Grob technique analysing the advantages related to increased mechanical stability. Methods 30 patients that underwent “in situ” fusion for L 5 -S 1 spondylolisthesis were evaluated. All patients presented a low-dysplastic developmental L 5 -S 1 spondylolisthesis. Patients were divided into two groups: A, in which L 5 -S 1 pedicle instrumentation associated with transsacral screw fixation was performed, and B, in which L 5 -S 1 pedicle instrumentation associated with a posterolateral interbody fusion (PLIF) was performed. Results Patients treated with transdiscal L 5 -S 1 fixation observed a faster resolution of the symptoms and a more rapid return to daily activities, especially at 3 – 6 months’ <b>follow-up.</b> The <b>technique</b> is reliable in giving an optimal mechanical stability to obtain a solid fusion. Conclusions The advantages of this technique are lower incidence of neurologic complications, speed of execution and faster return to normal life...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntroductionCongenital tarsal {{coalition}} resection {{in adolescents}} may be hindered by the complex three-dimensional {{anatomy of the}} talocalcaneal joint. Peroperative fluoroscopy is not greatly contributive, especially for talocalcaneal coalition. Hypothesis 3 D planning and patient-specific instruments facilitate the procedure. Materials and methodsA made-to-measure surgical guide (patient-specific instrument) was used in 9 consecutive patients for tarsal coalition resection (7 talocalcaneal and 2 calcaneonavicular coalitions). The guide was created by 3 D modeling from the CT scan of the foot. Placed on the bone surface, it oriented the saw blade to resect the bone bridge at the appropriate depth. A fascia lata allograft was interposed. Complete resection and absence of recurrence were checked on postoperative CT in talocalcaneal and on radiography in calcaneonavicular coalitions. ResultsResection was complete in all cases, with no recurrence at last <b>follow-up.</b> DiscussionThis <b>technique</b> makes tarsal coalition resection easier and more reliable and may be recommended to improve precision.

40|$|Abstract Background Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) are {{the most}} {{frequent}} hemato-oncological malignancies. Despite recent major advances in treatment, a substantial proportion of patients relapses highlighting {{the need for new}} therapeutic modalities. Promissory results obtained in pre-clinical studies are usually not translated when moving into clinical trials. Pre-clinical studies are mainly conducted in animals with high tumor burden; instead patients undergo chemotherapy as first line of treatment and most likely are under remission when immunotherapies are applied. Thus, an animal model that more closely resembles patients’ conditions would be a valuable tool. Methods BALB/c mice were injected subcutaneously with A 20 lymphoma cells and after tumor development different doses of chemotherapy were assessed to find optimal conditions for minimal residual disease (MRD) establishment. Tumor growth and survival, as well as drugs side effects, were all evaluated. Complete lymphoma remission was monitored in vivo using positron emission tomography (PET), and the results were correlated with histology. Immunological status was assessed by splenocytes proliferation assays in NHL-complete remission mice and by analyzing tumor cell infiltrates and chemokines/cytokines gene expression in the tumor microenvironment of animals with residual lymphoma. Results Two cycles of CHOP chemotherapy at days 25 and 35 post-tumor implantation induced complete remission for around 20  days. PET showed to be a suitable <b>follow-up</b> <b>technique</b> for MRD condition with 85. 7 and 75 % of sensibility and specificity respectively. Proliferative responses upon mitogen stimulation were similar in animals that received chemotherapy and wild type mice. Tumors from animals with residual lymphoma showed higher numbers of CD 4 + and CD 8 + and similar numbers of NK, neutrophils and Tregs infiltrating cells as compared with non-treated animals. Gene expression of several cytokines as well as an array of chemokines associated with migration of activated T cells to tumor sites was upregulated in the tumor microenvironment of animals that received chemotherapy treatment. Conclusions We established a NHL-B pre-clinical model using standard chemotherapy to achieve MRD in immunocompetent animals. The MRD condition is maintained for approximately 20  days providing a therapeutic window of time where new immunotherapies can be tested in conditions closer to the clinics...|$|R
