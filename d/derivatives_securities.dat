40|$|The main {{parameter}} {{required in}} pricing of <b>derivative</b> <b>securities</b> is {{the volatility of}} the underlying security. This may typically be estimated from historical prices or as implied volatility from derivative prices. It is however not clear how to estimate the volatility of the underlying securities over a given sample period, say six months. In this paper we propose an estimation technique in state space framework which can model unobserved component effectively. This approach allows combining in an optimal fashion {{the information contained in}} the prices of the underlying <b>security</b> and its <b>derivatives</b> over the sample period. 2 BACKGROUND Probably the single most important innovation in the area of pricing <b>derivative</b> <b>securities</b> is the concept of risk-neutral valuation. This implies that if a <b>derivative</b> <b>security</b> depends only on the price of a traded security then the differential equation for the price of the <b>derivative</b> <b>security</b> does not involve any parameter that depends upon the risk preferences of the traders. In that sense it is safe to discount any cash flow due to the <b>derivative</b> <b>security</b> at the risk-free rate. This assumption greatly simplifies the procedure for pricing such <b>derivative</b> <b>securities.</b> It should, however, be emphasised that this approach is only applicable for <b>derivative</b> <b>securities</b> and it s...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} pricing <b>derivatives</b> <b>securities</b> such as stock options in {{incomplete}} financial markets. The {{goal is to}} determine arbitrage free prices for these securities. For this we consider a finite state, discrete time stochastic model of a financial market known as the finite market model. We restrict our attention to <b>derivatives</b> <b>securities</b> known as European contingent claims, those {{that can only be}} exercised on the expiration date. In the early chapters, we define the model precisely and also summarize the pricing theory for complete markets. In this case, it turns out that there is a unique way to price arbitrage freely. This unique price can be computed as a certain conditional expected value under the associated equivalent martingale measure. The larger goal of this thesis is to give a thorough exposition of the pricing theory for incomplete markets. We will show that in these markets, arbitrage free prices exist, but unique pricing cannot always be obtained. When a particular price is not unique, there is an open interval over which the price can vary freely. The left (resp. right) end points of this interval can be characterized as an infimum (resp. a supremum) of a certain conditional expected value over the set of associated equivalent martingale measures.

40|$|In this article, {{we define}} new 'Greeks' for {{financial}} derivatives: sensitivities to the running maximum and the running maximum drawdown of an underlying asset. Some types of portfolios, {{such as the}} net asset value of a hedge fund or performance fees, are sensitive to these parameters. In order to illustrate {{the concept of the}} new 'Greeks', we derive probabilistic representations of sensitivities for two classes of financial contracts: forwards on the maximum drawdown and lookback options.

40|$|This paper explores {{strategic}} {{trade in}} short-lived <b>derivative</b> <b>securities</b> by agents that possess long-term information about an underlying asset. In contrast to trading equity, where an informed agent will ultimately benefit from his trades, trading short-lived securities is profitable {{only if the}} price impounds the private information before expiry. A consequence is that a risk neutral informed agent's holdings of the short-lived security affect his trading behavior: Past informed trading leads to greater future informed trading. The shorter horizon in which information must be impounded for a short-lived security to pay off makes an informed agent more reluctant to trade at earlier dates. By characterizing {{the conditions under which}} liquidity traders choose to incur extra costs to roll over their short-term positions rather than trade in longer-term <b>derivative</b> <b>securities,</b> we provide a possible explanation for why most markets for longer-term <b>derivative</b> <b>securities</b> have little liquidity and large bid-ask spreads.

40|$|I {{survey and}} assess the {{development}} of continuous-time methods in finance during the last 30 years. The subperiod 1969 to 1980 saw a dizzying pace of development with seminal ideas in <b>derivatives</b> <b>securities</b> pricing, term structure theory, asset pricing, and optimal consumption and portfolio choices. During the period 1981 to 1999 the theory has been extended and modified to better explain empirical reg-ularities in various subfields of finance.

40|$|We {{study the}} impact of risk-aversion on the {{valuation}} of credit derivatives. Using the technology of utility-indifference pricing in intensity-based models of default risk, we analyse resulting yield spreads in multi-name credit derivatives, particularly CDOs. We study first the idealized problem with constant intensities where solutions are essentially explicit. We also give the large portfolio asymptotics for this problem. We then analyse the case where the firms have stochastic default intensities driven by a common factor, which {{can be viewed as}} another extreme from the independent case. This involves the numerical solution of a system of reaction-diffusion PDEs. We observe that the nonlinearity of the utility-indifference valuation mechanism enhances the effective correlation between the times of the credit events of the various firms leading to non-trivial senior tranche spreads, as often seen from market data.

40|$|When {{the market}} is {{incomplete}} a new non-redundant <b>derivative</b> <b>security</b> cannot be priced by no arbitrage arguments alone. Moreover {{there will be a}} multiplicity of stochastic discount factors and each of them may give a different price for the new <b>derivative</b> <b>security.</b> This paper develops an approach to the selection of a stochastic discount factor for pricing a new <b>derivative</b> <b>security.</b> The approach is {{based on the idea that}} the price of a <b>derivative</b> <b>security</b> should not vary too much when the payoff of the primitive security is slightly perturbed, i. e., the price of the derivative should be robust to model misspecification. The paper develops two metrics of robustness. The first is based on robustness in expectation. The second is based on robustness in probability and draws on tools from the theory of large deviations. We show that in a stochastic volatility model, the two metrics yield analytically tractable bounds for the derivative price as the underlying stochastic volatility model is perturbed. The bounds can be readily used for numerical examination of the sensitivity of the price of the derivativ...|$|R

40|$|MBA - WBSFinancial Derivatives {{are some}} of {{financial}} markets innovations {{that have been the}} subject of debate particularly with respect to their impact on the volatility of the price of the underlying asset. These instruments have been thought to have increased the volatility of the underlying asset‟s price, while some have praised them for decreasing the volatility of the price of the asset. The variability of volatility may create uncertainty about future prices and profits and may therefore impair long term investment decisions; consequently it is important to understand the factors of volatility. This research looks at the rand dollar exchange rate data to investigate the effect of the introduction of rand dollar futures in the foreign exchange rate market. The main finding of this research is that there is evidence to suggest that the introduction of rand dollar futures has lead to the decrease in the volatility of the rand dollar exchange rate.

40|$|Abstract—This {{research}} {{seeks to}} investigate the frequency and profitability of index arbitrage opportunities involving the SET 50 futures, SET 50 component stocks, and the ThaiDEX SET 50 ETF (ticker symbol: TDEX). In particular, the frequency and profit of arbitrage are measured in the following three arbitrage tests: (1) SET 50 futures vs. ThaiDEX SET 50 ETF, (2) SET 50 futures vs. SET 50 component stocks, and (3) ThaiDEX SET 50 ETF vs. SET 50 component stocks are investigated. For tests (2) and (3), the problems involve conic optimization and quadratic programming as subproblems. This research is first to apply conic optimization and quadratic programming techniques {{in the context of}} index arbitrage and is first to investigate such index arbitrage in the Thai equity and derivatives markets. Thus, the contribution of this study is twofold. First, its results would help understand the contribution of the <b>derivatives</b> <b>securities</b> to the efficiency of the Thai markets. Second, the methodology employed in this study can be applied to other geographical markets, with minor adjustments. Keywords—Conic optimization, Equity index arbitrage, Executio...|$|E
40|$|Unidroit has {{recently}} launched an intergovernmental process intended {{to set an}} international non-binding standard for close-out netting legislation. This paper, first, provides insights into {{the question of why}} harmonisation is needed. The colossal exposures inherent in the <b>derivatives,</b> <b>securities</b> lending, repo, forex and similar markets are generally covered by close-out netting provisions, which are contained in the relevant master agreements. Close-out netting reduces mutual exposure by about 80 – 90 %. The ‘net’ exposure is taken as a basis for the calculation of collateral and underlying capital, thus being vital for market participants' risk management, as well as for prudential supervision. Even though most developed markets have adopted netting-friendly legislation, the international nature of the modern financial market complicates enforceability of close-out netting in cross-jurisdictional situations, in particular in insolvency scenarios. Further, the Article explains the current difficulties in transposing the concept of close-out netting across jurisdictional borders and advocates a functional approach alongside the five criteria (immediate discharge of obligations? obligations due? obligations of the same kind?). Lastly, it sheds light on the concepts underlying the current UNIDROIT draft principle...|$|E

First chapter {{is dedicated to}} securities and deals mostly with the term of securities and its sorting. Czech legal system doesn't contain any clear definition of securities and enumerate only demonstrative list of securities. Definition of this term can be found only in legal theory and says that securities are connection of subject right and carrier instrument, which can be for example paper or record in evidence. According to the Czech law of capital market are most of the securities investments instruments. Second part characterizes financial derivatives, describes legal base of derivatives and divides them into categories. These instruments are derived from other basic ones and their value is changeable depending on price or value of underlying instrument. Basic instrument can be stock, bond, interest rate, index and etc. These instruments are characteristic by derived feature, big leverage effect, risk managing possibility and speculative function for investors. These instruments are classified as investments [...] ...|$|E
40|$|During {{recent years}} the {{counterparty}} risk subject has received a growing attention because of the so called Basel Accord. In particular the Basel III Accord asks the banks to fulfill finer conditions concerning counterparty credit exposures arising from banks' <b>derivatives,</b> <b>securities</b> financing transactions, default and downgrade risks characterizing the Over The Counter (OTC) derivatives market, etc. Consequently the development of effective and more accurate measures of risk have been pushed, particularly focusing on the estimate of the future fair value of derivatives with respect to prescribed time horizon and fixed grid of time buckets. Standard methods used to treat the latter scenario are mainly based on ad hoc implementations of the classic Monte Carlo (MC) approach, which {{is characterized by a}} high computational time, strongly dependent on the number of considered assets. This is why many financial players moved to more enhanced Technologies, e. g., grid computing and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) capabilities. In this paper we show how to implement the quantization technique, in order to accurately estimate both pricing and volatility values. Our approach is tested to produce effective results for the counterparty risk evaluation, with a big improvement concerning required time to run when compared to MC approach.

Violations of key assumptions of this model {{are found to be}} virtually inconsequential, especially for large, welldiversified portfolios. By contrast, flaws in the calibrated interdependence of credit risk across exposures, caused by plausible small-sample estimation errors or rule-of-thumb values of asset return correlations, can lead to significant inaccuracies in measures of portfolio credit risk. Similar inaccuracies arise under standard assumptions regarding the tails of the distribution of asset returns. JEL Codes: G 21, G 28, G 13, C 15.
