5|$|The {{automobile}} unions {{played a}} leading role in advancing the cause of women's rights. In 1955, the United Auto Workers Union (UAW) organized the UAW Women's Department to strengthen women's role in the union and encourage participation in the union's elected bodies. In a move that was met with some hostility by Teamsters leaders, the U.S. Division of Transport Personnel had in 1943 instructed Teamsters Union officials that women should be allowed full employment as truck drivers. That proved to be only a temporary wartime measure, but a change of heart among Teamsters leadership by the mid-1950s led to the Equal Pay Act of 1963. Women <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>auto</b> industry were considered leaders in the movement for women's rights.|$|E

25|$|With {{the rapid}} growth of {{industrial}} workers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>auto</b> factories, labor unions such as the American Federation of Labor and the United Auto Workers fought to organize workers to gain them better working conditions and wages.

The labor activism during those years increased influence of union leaders in the city such as Jimmy Hoffa of the Teamsters and Walter Reuther of the Autoworkers.|$|E

Is it suitable to undergo the whole process of changing <b>the</b> company <b>Auto</b> Hégr, a. s. towards process management? Would it not be more purposeful and efficient to take a different way of improvement? Is it not the best solution to make no change? The method used for achieving the main target {{of this paper}} is the analytical and synthetic cognitive procedure. <b>The</b> examined situation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> company <b>Auto</b> Hégr, a. s. is divided, in terms of thoughts, into the individual parts that are the subject of further examination.

25|$|The auto {{manufacturing}} industry expanded rapidly under Nieto's presidency. In 2014, more than US$10 billion was committed in {{investment in the}} sector. In conjunction with Kia Motors in August 2014, the president announced plans for Kia to build a US$1 billion factory in Nuevo León. At the time, Mercedes-Benz and Nissan were already building a US$1.4 billion plant near Puebla, while BMW was planning a US$1 billion assembly plant in San Luis Potosí. Audi began building a US$1.3 billion factory near Puebla in 2013. As of December 2014, two years into Peña Nieto's term, total investment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>auto</b> sector in Mexico had reached US$19 billion. The Bajío Region has received the majority of this investment, and with its rapidly expanding aerospace industry has become the fastest-growing region in the country.|$|E
25|$|The first {{investments}} in road infrastructure {{have given up}} in the 1920s, the government of Washington Luis, being pursued in the governments of Getúlio Vargas and Eurico Gaspar Dutra.

Kubitschek {{was responsible for the}} installation of major car manufacturers in the country (Volkswagen, Ford and General Motors arrived in Brazil during his rule) and one of the points used to attract them was, of course, support for the construction of highways. With the implementation of Fiat in 1976 ending an automobile market closed loop, {{from the end of the}} 1990s the country has received large foreign direct {{investments in}}stalling in its territory other major car manufacturers and utilities, such as Iveco, Renault, Peugeot, Citroen, Honda, Mitsubishi, Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Hyundai, Toyota among others.

25|$|Detroit {{was founded}} on July 24, 1701 by the French {{explorer}} and adventurer Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac and a party of settlers. During the 19th century, it became an important industrial hub {{at the center of}} the Great Lakes region. With expansion of the auto industry in the early 20th century, the city and its suburbs experienced rapid growth, and by the 1940s, the city had become the fourth-largest in the country. However, due to industrial restructuring, the loss of jobs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>auto</b> industry, and rapid suburbanization, Detroit lost considerable population from the late 20th century to the present. Since reaching a peak of 1.85 million at the 1950 census, Detroit's population has declined by more than 60 per cent. In 2013, Detroit became the largest U.S. city to file for bankruptcy, which it successfully exited in December 2014, when the city government regained control of Detroit's finances.|$|E

25|$|Trujillo {{began to}} {{interfere}} {{more in the}} domestic affairs of neighboring countries. He expressed great contempt for Venezuela's president Rómulo Betancourt. An established and outspoken opponent of Trujillo, Betancourt associated with Dominicans who had plotted against the dictator. Trujillo developed an obsessive personal hatred of Betancourt and supported numerous plots by Venezuelan exiles to overthrow him. This pattern of intervention led the Venezuelan government to take its case against Trujillo to the Organization of American States (OAS). This infuriated Trujillo, who ordered his agents to plant a bomb in Betancourt's car. On 24 June 1960, while Betancourt was driving {{through the streets of}} Caracas, Venezuela, during the annual Army Day parade, a powerful bomb exploded in his motorcade. The bomb had been placed in a green Oldsmobile parked near the parade route and contained 65 kilos of TNT. The blast exploded right under the car carrying Betancourt and his party. The car was sent flying across the street. One person <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>auto</b> was killed, and Betancourt suffered severe burns to his hands.|$|E
25|$|The American Federation of Labor (AFL) had {{attempted}} to organize auto workers since the early 1920s with little success. After {{the passage of the}} National Industrial Recovery Act in June 1933, the AFL again spearheaded a major drive in automobile manufacturing, this time organizing workers into federal labor unions. By March, more than 32,000 workers (representing about 17 percent of the total automotive manufacturing workforce) had been organized. On March 4, 1934, auto workers at Buick, Fisher Body, and Hudson voted to strike unless the employers recognized their unions, rehired all workers fired for union activity, and raised wages 20 percent. The AFL had accepted severe restrictions on union organizing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>auto</b> industry code (accepted by the government in early fall 1933), did not do much organizing under the code, utilized craft rather than industrial organizers whose main role appeared to be to suppress worker militancy rather than organize unions, and acquiesced when Hugh S. Johnson reinterpreted Section 7(a) in February 1934 to require proportional rather than exclusive representation. Worried that the auto worker unions might actually strike, the AFL negotiated with the government {{to find a way to}} avoid a strike.|$|E

While at Bristol Motor Speedway for the Food City 500, Johnson finished in the ninth position, moving him up to 11th in the Drivers' Standings. Next, Johnson finished tenth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Auto</b> Club 400, despite having an oil leak, but the rain saved Johnson from a low finish. He went on to finish twelfth during the spring event at Martinsville after being involved in a crash on the first green-white-checker attempt.

Afterward, he recorded a third-place finish in the STP 400 at Kansas on April 22, 2012, and a sixth-place finish in the Capital City 400 at Richmond one week later.
