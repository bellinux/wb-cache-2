If the fundamental <b>environmental</b> <b>imperative</b> is to preserve the integrity and stability of natural ecosystems, wouldn't this require frequent and costly human interventions to prevent naturally occurring changes to natural environments? In nature, the [...] "stability and integrity" [...] of ecosystems are disrupted or destroyed all the time by drought, fire, storms, pests, newly invasive predators, etc. Must humans act to prevent such ecological changes, and if so, at what cost? Why should we place such high value on current ecological balances? Why think it is our role to be nature's steward or policeman? According to these critics, Leopold's stress on preserving existing ecological balances is overly human-centered and fails to treat nature with the respect it deserves.|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} many {{developing}} nations {{have been exposed}} to significant external changes such as economic deregulation and globalization. Evidence suggests that this has resulted in the adoption of EC by organizations in these countries. It is important to understand the strategic and <b>environmental</b> <b>imperatives</b> for EC adoption. Such understanding is required for anticipating necessary changes in EC adoption, to keep in tune with the impending and emerging changes in the environment. It is also needed for formulating business strategies in alignment with the organization?s IS strategies and IT capabilities, and for addressing managerial challenges in EC adoption. This paper is based on a study of EC adoption in eighteen companies from eleven industries in India. It is aimed at examining the different factors, related to strategic and <b>environmental</b> <b>imperatives,</b> which lead to the adoption of EC by organizations in developing countries. The results, based on interviews with close to a hundred people in these organizations indicate that there are broadly three conditions under which an organization adopts EC. These are related to the external environment, organizational performance and specific internal management compulsions. Each of these conditions describes a specific aspect of EC adoption and leads to imperatives for changes in processes and products. These imperatives in turn, result in the adoption of EC in different critical organizational processes. This study {{is one of the first}} detailed empirical studies on EC adoption in Indian organizations...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the role and}} influence of the biological metaphor ‘growth’ in studies of organizations, specifically in entrepreneurial settings. We argue {{that we need to}} reconsider metaphorical expressions of growth processes in entrepreneurship studies in order to better understand growth in the light of contemporary challenges, such as environmental concerns. Our argument is developed in two stages: first, we review the role of metaphor in organization and entrepreneurship studies. Second, we reflect critically on three conceptualizations of growth that have drawn on biological metaphors: the growing organism, natural selection and co-evolution. We find the metaphor of co-evolution heuristically valuable but under-used and in need of further refinement. We propose three characteristics of the co-evolutionary metaphor that might enrich our understanding of entrepreneurial growth: relational epistemology; collectivity; and multidimensionality. Through this we provide a conceptual means of reconciling an economic impetus for entrepreneurial growth with an <b>environmental</b> <b>imperative</b> for sustainability...|$|E

40|$|Growing {{interest}} of the global community to <b>environmental</b> <b>imperative</b> of sustainable development poses a problem of recording the systemic interrelation between natural environment resources and economic results both at the macrolevel within the system of national accounts, and at the microe-conomics level – within the accounting system of an individual organisation.

40|$|The {{rationale}} for providing state subsidised public transport {{has shifted from}} a social obligation to provide transport options for those without access to private transport to an economic and <b>environmental</b> <b>imperative</b> to minimise congestion and {{the total number of}} kilometres travelled by private vehicle and to maximise service productivity. In many jurisdictions this shift has seen a greater focus on the provision of high occupancy crush loaded peak hour commuter services which are not designed {{to meet the needs of}} children and their carers who often need to engage in trip chaining and to travel outside peak commuting periods. In addition to service scheduling difficulties, attitudes which may see children as out of place and unwelcome on commuter services combined with inaccessible or child unfriendly transport infrastructure does not facilitate travel with or by children on many public transport services. Because the majority of children’s trips are accompanied, any consideration of children’s mobilities must also consider women’s mobilities. Combining the child-friendly cities agenda with feminist transport literature primarily around mobilities of care, this paper advances basic criteria for the provision of child-friendly public transport services and supporting infrastructure which meets the travelling needs of children and their carers and juxtaposes the achievement of these in South East Queensland, Australia and Stockholm, Sweden...|$|E
