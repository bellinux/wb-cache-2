The southbound track at Dyre Avenue is {{in the position of}} the southbound express track, as the southbound local track is no longer present. The current platform is built over the northbound express track. Small portions of the original side platforms remain on both sides of Dyre Avenue station. South of Dyre Avenue station, the southbound track moves over to the local position and the southbound express track begins.|$|E

5000|$|Track 1 is {{from the}} EP Successor, track 2 is a re-record from the demo Friend 'till the <b>End,</b> <b>track</b> 4 is a re-record from the demo Agre Pamppers, and track 5 {{is from the}} single [...] "Broken".|$|E

40|$|Proteins {{that track}} growing {{microtubule}} (MT) ends {{are important for}} many aspects of intracellular MT function, but the mechanism by which these +TIPs accumulate at MT ends {{has been the subject}} of a long-standing controversy. In this issue, Bieling et al. (Bieling, P., S. Kandels-Lewis, I. A. Telley, J. van Dijk, C. Janke, and T. Surrey. 2008. J.

This strongly supports the hypothesis that plus <b>end</b> <b>tracking</b> depends on a biochemical property of growing MT ends, and that the characteristic +TIP comets result from the generation of new +TIP binding sites through MT polymerization in combination with the exponentia...|$|R

50|$|Situated in {{the western}} suburb of Avellino, 2,5 km far from city centre, the station also serves the town of Atripalda, whose {{territory}} borders with it. The <b>end</b> <b>track</b> of the RA2 motorway from Salerno is located 500 m south of the station.|$|E

50|$|In addition, plus <b>end</b> <b>tracking</b> proteins, which bind to {{the very}} tip of growing microtubules, have also been identified. These include EB1, EB2, EB3, p150Glued, Dynamitin, Lis1, CLIP170, CLIP115, CLASP1, and CLASP2.|$|R
5000|$|... "You, Still of War" [...] is the <b>ending</b> <b>track</b> of {{the regular}} album and the longest of all editions; it {{tells the story of}} a nuclear bomb that is the only {{survivor}} of a war. Deris explained: ...|$|R

5000|$|One is {{the first}} solo album by jazz {{musician}} Bob James released in 1974. It followed [...] "Bold Conceptions (1963 on Mercury) and [...] "Explosions (1965 on ESP-Disk).

50|$|Here is {{the liner}} notes {{for the latest}} album Frøy Aagre Electric: The name Frøy Aagre Electric refers to the new setup with Fender Rhodes Electric Piano, effects and bass synth {{as opposed to the}} {{previous}} setup of merely acoustic instruments. This album is divided into two parts; following is a description of part 1, the main section of the album (track 1-6). Part 2 is the three duo pieces at the <b>end</b> (<b>track</b> 7-9).|$|E
50|$|The {{station has}} two west facing {{terminal}} platform tracks, numbered 1 and 2, {{and a third}} through platform track, numbered 3 {{for most of its}} length but 13 at its eastern <b>end.</b> <b>Track</b> 1 is served by a side platform adjacent to the station buildings, whilst 2 and 3 flank an island platform accessed by a concourse across the terminal end of tracks 1 and 2. Tracks 1, 2 and 3 are used by Brünig line trains, track 13 by Meiringen-Innertkirchen trains.|$|E
5000|$|Like the {{previous}} album's closing track [...] "Fifty-Nine," [...] this album's <b>ending</b> <b>track</b> [...] "Sixty-Three" [...] contains a dialogue {{passage from the}} classic spaghetti western The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. As usual, the instrumental tracks are given numbers instead of names.|$|R
40|$|CLASPs are {{spatially}} regulated microtubule plus <b>end</b> <b>tracking</b> proteins {{involved in}} forming polarized microtubule arrays.

5000|$|The track [...] "Hashire! Mirai" [...] {{was used}} as the opening theme of the anime {{adaptation}} of Ace of Diamond. The track [...] "Sakurabito", composed by Takuro upon request by the Fukushima Hamakaido Sakura Project, was included as the <b>ending</b> <b>track</b> of both compilations.|$|R

50|$|Amsterdam Centraal has fifteen tracks, {{eleven of}} which are {{alongside}} a platform: four island platforms with tracks along the full length on both sides (tracks 4/5, 7/8, 10/11, 13/14); one side platform with one track along the full length (track 15); and one bay platform (or side platform) with two tracks (tracks 1/2). All tracks along a platform have an A-side and a B-side, except for track 1. This means that there are 21 places where a train can be positioned for passenger access. One track has a side track along the full length (track 2); on the other side, there is track only at the west <b>end</b> (<b>track</b> 1; bay platform), along {{the rest of the}} platform is the station building. Tracks 3, 6, 9, and 12 have no platform.|$|E
50|$|Even {{after the}} line was singled, until February 1845, {{two of the three}} daily {{services}} each way carried through coaches to London. The daily service was reduced from three trains to two in 1859, and from May 1877 the service was reduced to a Parliamentary train service of a single morning train in each direction. This being the minimum level of service required by law. This lasted until 1917, when the passenger service was finally withdrawn as a wartime economy measure, while under government control (but not ownership) during the First World War. The line continued in use for freight until 1935 when it was officially closed, following a bridge failure in Packington. However, the track at the northern end remained in place, and was used as a siding for the storage of disabled wagons between the mid 1930s and 1951, when the track was finally removed. The Hampton <b>end</b> <b>track</b> had become a minor siding, and was lifted in 1963.|$|E
50|$|Today's {{infrastructure}} of the station consists of the station building, two low-lying through passenger platforms and one cargo platform, walking bridge over south yard neck. Station layout consists of 8 tracks including 2 stub <b>ended</b> <b>tracks</b> (the first six tracks are electrified 25 kV AC system).|$|R
5000|$|In 2008, Price also {{recorded}} vocals {{for the opening}} track, [...] "We Will Be Heroes", of the Pokémon DP: Battle Dimensions television series, and the <b>ending</b> <b>track,</b> [...] "Ill Always Remember You", for two Pokémon movies, The Rise of Darkrai and Arceus and the Jewel of Life.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>ending</b> <b>track,</b> [...] "The Lost Saga", is {{the longest}} song on the album. In the liner notes, Kotipelto states that writing the lyrics, which deal with Vikings and battles, was the [...] "hardest work he has ever done".

He specially engaged a dance instructor from Korea to choreograph his dance for the song [...] "Kiss Me" [...] and {{was reported to have}} learned it via a video recording in just two days. The song [...] "Kelly" [...] was chosen as the <b>end</b> <b>track</b> for the Korean drama [...] "You Who Came From The Stars" [...] which was aired in Taiwan in May. [...] "The Song" [...] was also selected to be the closing song for thirteen Shin Kong Mitsukoshi malls in Taiwan, which will be played just before the malls close starting on 1 July.
