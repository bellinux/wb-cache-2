40|$|AbstractObjectives. This study {{sought to}} {{determine}} the degree of <b>interinstitutional</b> <b>agreement</b> {{in the interpretation of}} dobutamine stress echocardiograms. Background. Dobutamine stress echocardiography involves subjective interpretation. Consistent methods for acquisition and interpretation are of critical importance for obtaining high inter-observer agreement and for facilitating communication of test results. Methods:Five experienced centers were each asked to submit 30 dobutamine stress echocardiograms (dobutamine up to 40 μg/kg body weight per min and atropine up to 1 mg) obtained in patients undergoing coronary angiography. Thus, a total of 150 dobutamine stress echocardiograms were interpreted by each center without knowledge of any other patient data. Left ventricular wall motion was assessed using a 16 -segment model but was otherwise not standardized. No patient was excluded because of poor wage quality or inadequate stress level. Echocardiographic image quality was assessed using a five-point scale. Results. Angiographically significant coronary artery disease (≥ 50 % diameter stenosis) was present in 95 patients (63 %). By a majority decision (three or more centers), the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of dobutamine echocardiography were 76 %, 87 % and 80 %, respectively. Abnormal or normal results of stress echocardiography were agreed on by four or all five of the centers in 73 % of patients (mean kappa value 037, fair agreement only). Agreement on the left anterior descending artery territory (78 %) was similar to that for the combined right coronary artery/left circumflex artery territory (74 %), and for specific segments the agreement ranged from 84 % to 97 % and was highest for the basal anterior segment and lowest for the basal inferior segment. Agreement was higher in patients with no (82 %) or three-vessel coronary artery disease (100 %) and lower in patients with one-or two-vessel disease (61 % and 68 %, respectively). Agreement on positivity or negativity of stress test results was 100 % for patients with the highest image quality but only 43 % for those with the lowest image quality (p = 0. 003). Conclusions. The current heterogeneity in data acquisition and assessment criteria among different centers results in low inter-institutional agreement in interpretation of stress echocardiograms. Agreement is higher in patients with no or advanced coronary artery disease and substantially lower in those with limited echocardiographic image quality. To increase <b>interinstitutional</b> <b>agreement,</b> better standardization of image, acquisition and reading criteria of stress echocardiography is recommended...|$|E
40|$|Since the Treaty of Lisbon, the {{legislative}} {{system of the}} European Union {{is based on a}} distinction between legislative acts and non-legislative acts as well as on a distinction between delegation and implementation. This system has brought about several issues that received a fair degree of scholarly attention prior to the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and in the initial years thereafter. The new <b>Interinstitutional</b> <b>Agreement</b> on Better Law Making (IIA) has addressed some of these issues, but this still leaves the question open as to how this new legislative system is to be implemented in practice. This article reviews these issues, first, in light of the new IIA and, second, in light of {{the legislative}} practice that has emerged since then. The revision of the Directive on Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision is taken as the legislative case in this respect.

40|$|The European Union is {{a unique}} and {{exceptional}} organisation in many respects. Its financial system, whose rules and structure {{are very different from}} those of national budgetary law, has changed a great deal and is still changing. The most significant changes include: — The unification of budgetary instruments. Initially, each Community had its own budget or budgets (administrative and operating). These have now been replaced by a single budget, the general budget of the European Union. — Progress towards financial autonomy. Following the example of the ECSC, which was financed by real ‘tax revenue’ from the time it was set up, the EEC and Euratom changed to a system of own resources on 1 January 1971. — Reform of the Community financial system. The financial perspective, a genuine multiannual financial framework and instrument of budgetary discipline, was introduced in 1988. It forms an integral part of an <b>interinstitutional</b> <b>agreement</b> between Parliament, the Council and the Commission. — The pursuit of an institutional balance between the Council, Parliament and the Commission in the exercise of budgetary power.

40|$|The European Union {{budget has}} a number of {{specific}} characteristics which make it different from the budgets of the Member States : in principle, it must never be in deficit, and there is a special decision-making procedure. The structure and maximum expenditure are specified for a 7 -year period in the Financial Perspective. In relation to GDP and national budgets of the Member States, the EU budget is small. It is increasingly funded {{on the basis of the}} size of the gross national income of each Member State whereas import levies and VAT-based transfers from the Member States are becoming less important. The United Kingdom receives a special rebate. The importance of the Common Agricultural Policy, historically the largest EU expenditure item, is steadily diminishing in favour of expenditure on cohesion policy. Since the beginning of the 1990 s, the Common Agricultural Policy has undergone a radical reform. Opinions differ on the contribution made by the cohesion policy towards income convergence between regions in the EU. The Commission’s proposals regarding the Financial Perspective for 2007 - 2013 embodied an important increase in expenditure and placed the emphasis on the attainment of the Lisbon objectives.

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} examine the motivations for the European Union’s (EU) policy towards the Common Market of the South (Mercosur), the EU’s most {{important}} relationship with another regional economic integration organisation. As such, the EUMercosur relationship has a prominent place {{in the literature on}} the EU as a global actor. This thesis argues that the dominant explanations in the literature [...] balancing the US, global aspirations, being an external federator, long-standing economic and cultural ties, economic interdependence, and the Europeanization of Spanish and Portuguese national foreign policies – fail to adequately explain the EU’s policy. In particular, these accounts tend to infer the EU’s motives from its activity. Drawing extensive primary documents, this thesis argues that the major developments in the relationship [...] the 1992 <b>Interinstitutional</b> <b>Agreement</b> and the 1995 Europe Mercosur Inter-regional Framework Cooperation Agreement – were initiated by Mercosur. Moreover, a free trade agreement was included in the latter agreement which negotiations finally started in 1999 due to the insistence of Mercosur. This means that rather than the EU pursuing a strategy, as implied by most of the existing literature, the EU was largely responsive. How it responded to Mercosur’s overtures, however, has been influenced by some of the factors highlighted in the literature, most notably the Europeanisation of Portuguese and, particularly, Spanish foreign policies. Also the Commission’s role as external federator has influenced as well, although to a lesser extent. Overall, however, these supposedly causal factors have provided only a very weak impetus for EU policy, which explains in large part why the relationship is much less developed than the EU’s relations with other parts of the world. Beyond providing a distinctive and empirically rich account of the EU’s relationship with Mercosur, this thesis contributes to the literature on the EU as a global actor, particularly {{the extent to which it}} is a strategic actor, and to the literature on Europeanization of national foreign policies of member states from a bottom-up perspective with the case of Spain and Portugal...|$|E

40|$|The European Union {{regarded}} as an economic reenhancement force in Europe {{and in the world}} must fund the needs of 500 million citizens. To do that, it should possess an innovative budget adjusted to the new facts of globalization meant to meet present challenges and create various opportunities for the future. In order to improve budgetary procedures, the need to reform the community bugdet has emerged, namely to change the way it is designed and spent. The manner of setting and distributing the community budget has been changed several times whenever the context in member states has demanded. Thus, European institutions concluded in 1988 <b>interinstitutional</b> <b>agreements</b> which have been covering budgetary process and budget allocation ever since.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of digital echocardiography has significantly enhanced {{our ability to}} select the best set of frames for analysis. However, despite the beneficial attributes of transthoracic dobutamine stress echocardiography, poor quality 2 -dimensional images {{continue to be a}} significant limiting factor in patients with chest deformities, severe chronic obstructive lung disease, marked obesity, and previous chest surgery. Transesophageal echocardiography provides a new window to monitor left ventricular contractility without the interference of bone and air-filled structures of the thoracic cage. The transesophageal dobutamine stress test is a logical but poorly explored modality to image/stress the heart in certain patients with known or suspected myocardial ischemia. Overall sensitivity (< or = 85 %) and specificity (< or = 95 - 100 %) of transesophageal dobutamine stress echocardiography appear to be similar to that of previous transthoracic studies, although no direct comparison has been accomplished between transthoracic and transesophageal stress images. False negative transesophageal dobutamine stress echocardiography results have been described in patients with single-vessel disease in whom ischemic regions may not have been visualized throughout the entire study. False positive study results may be present in patients with hypertension and myocardial hypertrophy that may have signs and symptoms of myocardial ischemia in absence of obstructive disease of the epicardial coronary arteries, presumably related to either microvascular disease or impaired vasodilatory reserve. The proportion of patients with coronary artery disease who need a transesophageal examination for reliable assessment of echocardiographic response to stress varies depending on the operators' skills, the interpreters' experience, and the use of videotape or digitizing systems for image analysis. Although clinically useful in its present transthoracic and transesophageal form, a major limitation of dobutamine stress echocardiographic study is the subjective visual interpretation of endocardial motion and wall thickening, which is only semiquantitative. Color kinesis and tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) are 2 novel echocardiographic techniques that color code endocardial motion and myocardial velocity online and have the potential to objectively quantify regional left ventricular function. Quantitative standardization of transthoracic and transesophageal data interpretation, such as establishing endocardial motion by color kinesis or velocity thresholds by TDI for an abnormal segmental response to stress, has the potential to decrease interobserver variability and increase <b>interinstitutional</b> <b>agreement...</b>|$|E
40|$|This work, {{prepared}} and published during the author's {{stay at the}} RSCAS, EUI, is a "compilation thesis" (in Finnish "artikkeliväitöskirja"), Department of Political Sciences, University of Helsinki, and contains the {{major part of the}} author's PhD thesis (forthcoming print monograph, 2012). The future is uncertain, and the financial system of the European Union has to take into account this uncertainty. This book looks at the different means it has at its disposal to do so, and analyses how these means have evolved since the creation of the general budget of the European Communities in 1968. The analysis is extended to a broader study of the development of the European Union through several case studies: negotiations on the Financial Regulation of 25 June 2002,on its first modifi cation, adopted on 13 December 2006, and on the <b>Interinstitutional</b> <b>Agreement</b> (IIA) of 17 May 2006 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and sound fi nancial management and on the Multiannual Financial Framework for 2007 - 2013. The question of the uncertainty of the future is addressed using the so-called “Theory of Budgetary Flexibility”. This theory, developed originally to analyse national budgetary systems, establishes an essential distinction between External Flexibility and Internal Flexibility, on the one hand, and Annual Flexibility and Multiannual Flexibility on the other hand. It is particularly useful here as it enables us to examine under a common framework processes that are often considered separate (and treated in the literature as such), and to draw conclusions at systems’ level. The book is divided into three Parts: - Part One (Chapters 1 to 3), which forms the theoretical part of this book, includes an analysis of the specificities and of the functioning of the budgetary and financial systems of the European Union, while presenting an “état des lieux” of studies carried out in these fields; - Part Two (Chapters 4 to 13) deals with changes that have been made to various forms of flexibility since 1968. Special attention is paid not only to the consequences these changes have had for the various actors involved – namely the European Parliament, the Council, the Commission and Member States – but also for the financial system of the European Union as a whole; - Part Three (Chapters 14 to 18) addresses the question of how the changes examined in Part Two affect the general development of the European Union...|$|E
40|$|This {{collection}} of studies analyses {{the various ways}} and means that the financial system of the European Union has at its disposal for handling the inevitable uncertainties {{of the future and}} traces their evolution since the creation of the general budget of the European Communities in 1968. Special attention is paid to the consequences of this evolution not only for the various actors involved – namely the European Parliament, the Council, the Commission and Member States – but also for the financial system of the European Union as a whole. The question of the uncertainty of the future is addressed {{in the light of the}} theory of “Budgetary Flexibility”, which posits an essential distinction between “External Flexibility and “Internal Flexibility, on the one hand, and “Annual Flexibility“ and “Multiannual Flexibility“ on the other. External Flexibility differs from Internal Flexibility in that, in the case of the former, more resources (or fewer, in the case of budget cuts) can be allocated in the course of the budgetary year. In the case of the latter, budget limits (frames) are maintained, i. e. a reallocation of resources during the financial year will not lead to the growth in the overall size of the budget. At the same time, Multiannual Flexibility differs from Annual Flexibility in that the former can be considered as an exception to the principle of budgetary annuality as set out by the EC and EU Treaties. The theory of “Budgetary Flexibility” allows to place under a common theoretical framework processes that are often considered separate (and treated in the academic literature as such), and also enables to analyse the pros and cons and the consequences of such flexibility, and to draw conclusions at the level of the European Union. The studies also develop further the theory, devised originally in the 1990 s to analyse the budgetary systems of the Member States. The studies focus on three recent major negotiations which led to the Financial Regulation of 25 June 2002, to its first modification, adopted on 13 December 2006, and to the <b>Interinstitutional</b> <b>Agreement</b> (IIA) of 17 May 2006 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and sound financial management and to the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for 2007 - 2013. The main forms of flexibility identified in the studies are: the system of amending budgets, the quantity of various budget headings and ”operational” budget lines in the general budget and the system of transfer of appropriations during the budgetary year (”structural flexibility”), the system of compulsory vs non-compulsory expenditure (”normative flexibility”), the system of provisional appropriations, reserves and Funds, the system of commitment appropriations, the system of carry-overs, and the various flexibility elements present in budgetary discipline system and the multiannual financial perspectives and framework of the European Union...|$|E

To review these and other developments in interlibrary cooperation in Latin American would require far more extended treatment than is possible here. As the observer of the book and library scene in the countries south of the 1 Jnited States becomes familiar with the many diverse trends in library development, he comes to realize that there are relatively few instances of cooperation which reach across the entire area. However, just as library cooperation in the United States often crosses state boundaries, in Latin America a considerable portion of the cooperative activities centers around regions like the Caribbean and Central America. In addition, there are presently relatively few specific examples of the kinds of cooperation mentioned above.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} extent to which {{arrangements}} concluded between European institutions contribute to the separation of powers underlying the European Union’s political system. The point of departure is an analysis of different separation of powers models. The author posits that the European Union’s political system is best interpreted against the background of a ‘separation of institutions’, implying that no European institution should exercise its legal powers in an unchecked manner. This approach builds on the Court of Justice’ institutional balance doctrine. It differs from the more traditional constitutional law theory known as ‘trias politica’ according to which no government authority ought to combine two ‘governmental functions’. Seen from this perspective, separation of powers is a matter of autonomous institutions subject to ‘checks and balances’. Some checks and balances find their basis in EU law. However, many others are based on arrangements between the European institutions. Many of such arrangements are not based on law. An enquiry into the possible general legal bases for such interinstitutional agreements finds all of them unsound. Driessen argues that interinstitutional arrangements without a legal basis (‘interinstitutional conventions’) cannot be legally enforceable. Although there are differences, to a certain extent they can be equated to the ‘constitutional conventions’ known in British constitutional law. An analysis of such interinstitutional conventions suggests their omnipresence in European constitutional practice. The study analyses the effects of interinstitutional arrangements on different fields of EU law. This includes, inter alia, an analysis of the political responsibility of the Commission and of its members towards the European Parliament, of the interinstitutional conventions that govern the Parliament’s rights of oversight, and those governing legislative procedures, the budgetary procedure and external relations. The analysis shows that many interinstitutional conventions are important instruments for the daily management of the Union. Other interinstitutional conventions concern the details of the relations between the institutions. They can tangibly affect the balance of influence between the European institutions. For example, in the budgetary field, the European Parliament successfully used interinstitutional agreements to ensure that about one half of expenditure is subject to its approval as non-compulsory expenditure. Additionally, it acquired some control over the remainder through the financial perspectives, which are equally based on interinstitutional conventions. Driessen researches the limitations on the use of such interinstitutional arrangements. Although they certainly cannot replace the procedures foreseen in European law, they can affect such them. Jurists often fail to notice {{the extent to}} which this happens. The study is based on current law but also takes on board the changes proposed in the Constitutional Treaty.

SEAM agreed to: first, accept the regional management plan presented by the Aché community; and second, initiate the process of transfer of title from the SEAM to the Aché Community Kuetuvy, which had been solicited by request to SEAM on April 28, 2005 in note #34128. In this fashion, SEAM indicated that the necessary steps were being planned taking into account that the process must comply with certain regulations in order to legally cede title to the community. Soon afterwards, on August 19, 2005 the Secretary of the Environment sent a document (note #563/05) directed to the President of the Republic in reference to the Finca 470, situated in the District of Ygatimi, Department of Canindeyú. This letter stated that the aforementioned property [...] "..was acquired by the Secretary of the Environment for conservation purposes in the area of influence of National Highway 10 [...] "Las Residentas" [...] through the loan number 933/OC-PR from the International Development Bank {{within the framework of the}} [...] "Natural Corridors" [...] program of the Public Works and Communications Ministry, as stated in the transfer of title document registered by the Escribanía Mayor de Gobierno in 2003, under the registry n° 30 archive 195 and those that follow." [...] The document sent to the President of the Republic goes on to repeat SEAM's commitment to the terms of the 2004 <b>Interinstitutional</b> Cooperation <b>Agreement</b> with the ultimate goal of maintaining a forest reserve and transferring title to the indigenous inhabitants of the property in observance with the National Constitution and aforementioned laws N° 352/94, N° 904/94, N° 234/93. Continuing, the document states that [...] ".. taking into account that the aforementioned property functions as permanent location of the native Aché community Kuetuvy, and according to the principles of national law 234/93, which endorses article 14 of ILO Convention 169 (this refers to the Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989 formulated by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, United Nations) stating that [...] "The rights of ownership and possession of the peoples concerned over the lands which they traditionally occupy shall be recognised.", in my position as Secretary of the Environment I am submitting the background concerning this case to the Presidencia de la República, in order that the corresponding necessary steps be taken by the appropriate entities, in order that we comply with the first clause in the framework of the mentioned International Convention." ...|$|R
