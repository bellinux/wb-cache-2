5|$|The {{indigenous}} {{religion of}} the Māori population was animistic, but {{with the arrival of}} missionaries from the early nineteenth century most of the Māori population converted to Christianity. In the 2013 census, 2,595 Māori still identify themselves as adhering to traditional Māori beliefs. The largest Christian denominations are Roman Catholicism, Anglicanism, Presbyterianism. There are also significant numbers of Christians who identify themselves with Methodist, Pentecostal, Baptist and Latter-day Saint churches, and the New Zealand-based Rātana church has adherents among Māori. Immigration and associated <b>demographic</b> <b>change</b> in recent decades has contributed to the growth of minority religions, especially Hinduism, Buddhism and Islam.|$|E

The dispute between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu over the sharing of Kaveri river water often leads to minor altercations and demonstrations in the city.

5|$|The temple {{properties}} were {{no longer}} cultivated, and tanks were not maintained. Thus the population was surviving on slash and burn agriculture. British colonial policies favored the conversion of these lands into lucrative coconut plantations quickly covering all suitable Pattuva lands. Establishments of large-scale plantations also led to population increase due to migration and settlement of plantation workers from {{the interior of the}} country. This led to a <b>demographic</b> <b>change,</b> and the local Pattuva people became disassociated from the temple and its administration.|$|E

40|$|Asia has {{witnessed}} robust growth since the 1960 s {{and the so-called}} “East Asian economic miracle”. Even till today when the world’s largest economies are suffering from debt and banking crises, emerging markets in Asia have managed to maintain rapid growth. In the meantime, significant <b>demographic</b> <b>changes</b> are taking place in Asian countries. Although existing studies have found <b>demographic</b> <b>changes</b> and economic growth closely related, such findings are rather inconsistent and a defined relationship cannot be concluded. Using an economic growth model, this article further examines the relationship between <b>demographic</b> <b>changes</b> and economic growth in Asia with data spanning from the 1960 s to {{the first decade of}} the current century. The results find various extents to which <b>demographic</b> <b>changes</b> have affected the economic growth in the region and their potential impact in the future...|$|R

5|$|Enrollment dropped {{every year}} since the program's {{inception}} such that, when compounded by dropouts, the program was below half-capacity three years later. UW President Glenn Frank had warned of decreased enrollment in August 1928 and of its consequences for the college. UW College of Letters and Science Dean George Sellery offered support conditional on codified discipline and uniform final exams, which Meiklejohn refused. Sellery later refused to allow transfer students into the college. Meiklejohn wrote letters to Wisconsin high schools in April 1929 that acknowledged the college's stereotypes and welcomed <b>demographic</b> <b>change,</b> but the campaign backfired. He sent an adviser to tour the state and solve {{what he saw as}} a communication issue. The adviser found high school seniors largely interested in vocational training, and that the prospect of traditional college excited students {{to the point where they}} did not consider improvements upon that model. The adviser found students uninterested in the Experimental College's prospects.|$|E
5|$|The temple {{is located}} in Munneswaram, a village with mixed Sinhala and Tamil {{population}} situated in the historic Demala Pattuva ("Tamil division") region in the Puttalam District. The main Shiva temple owns extensive property in the surrounding villages, ownership of which was affirmed when the region {{was part of the}} medieval Kotte Kingdom. The temple was destroyed twice by the Portuguese colonial officers, who handed over the properties to the Jesuits. Although the Jesuits built a Catholic chapel over the temple foundation, locals reconstructed the temple both times. Due to religious and <b>demographic</b> <b>change</b> after the late 18th century, most surrounding villages and towns are not directly associated with the temple administration and maintenance. However, the villages of Maradankulama and Udappu are associated with organizing the main temple festival.|$|E

25|$|In Nauru's history, {{there have}} been six major {{demographics}} changes. The island was first inhabited by Micronesian people roughly 3,000 years ago. The first European to find the island was John Fearn in 1798. In 1888, the country was annexed by Germany. The next <b>demographic</b> <b>change</b> came when Japanese occupied the island during World War II in the 1940s. During this time, the Japanese deported several thousands of Nauruans to other islands. The next major <b>demographic</b> <b>change</b> was in the 1960s; the country gained independence, where the percentage of Nauruans started to increase. The last major demographics change was in 2006 when the Government of Nauru repatriated {{almost all of the}} remaining Tuvaluan and I-Kiribati workers, following large scale reduction from the Republic of Nauru Phosphate Corporation (RONPhos) and government workers. The census of 2006 stated 9,233 people were in Nauru: down 2.13% per year from the previous census of 2002.|$|E

Although a majority of citizens still identify with Christianity in many surveys, regular church attendance has fallen dramatically since the middle of the 20th century, while immigration and <b>demographic</b> <b>change</b> have contributed to the growth of other faiths, most notably Islam.

25|$|A {{shifting}} class make-up was not {{the only}} <b>demographic</b> <b>change</b> to affect the student body, as in 1869 women were permitted to attend lectures for the first time.

The decision to admit women was made in large part owing to pressure from local campaigner Mary Burton, who later became the Institution's first female director in 1874.|$|E
