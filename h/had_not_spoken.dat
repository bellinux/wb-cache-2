5|$|At this point, Khánh <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>spoken</b> up {{and allowed}} the {{impression}} that the moves had been made without his consultation or against his will, and an attempt on the part of other officers to take power themselves. Hương had actually privately endorsed the dissolution of the HNC, as both he and the Young Turks thought it would allow them to gain more power and influence over Khánh.|$|E
5|$|Taraborrelli {{decided to}} focus on the singer's private life; who she really was. Many books about the superstar were based on {{previously}} published material, but Taraborrelli had ten years of research to draw upon including interviews with people who <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>spoken</b> about Madonna in public and his own interviews with the icon. Taraborrelli and his team of private investigators interviewed Madonna's close friends, business associates, and family members including her father Silvio Ciccone.|$|E

Seattle-based producer and audio engineer Martin Feveyear, who had mixed Carlile's debut album {{in addition to}} other live EPs and demos, recorded, mixed, and mastered the album. Carlile <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>spoken</b> to Feveyear prior to the first rehearsal, but was pleased with the result of his work. Carlile's band included long-time members (and brothers) Phil and Tim Hanseroth on guitar and bass, Josh Neumann on cello, and Allison Miller on drums. The Seattle Symphony was led by Assistant Conductor Eric Garcia.|$|E

5|$|Murphy {{was born}} in Harlow {{and grew up in}} Irthlingborough. He was home-schooled from age 13 after being bullied at school, and his parents split up when he was 14. He lived with his father Tony, a former {{professional}} golfer, and did not see his mother again until he was 19. During the 2007 World Championship, it was reported that he had developed a rift with his father, {{who was a member of}} the World Snooker board. He said that they <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>spoken</b> in over a year, but that he would willingly speak to his father again if the other called him.|$|E
5|$|McCulloch met former Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr in 1993 {{and they}} wrote and {{recorded}} an album, tentatively titled Touch Down. The album {{was to be}} released in early 1994; however, despite McCulloch and Marr being happy with the album, Rob Dickins at WEA felt it was missing some element. Dickins suggested to McCulloch that Sergeant be brought in to do some work. McCulloch was initially sceptical because he <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>spoken</b> with Sergeant since de Freitas's funeral; however, he did give the idea some thought. Before McCulloch had chance to contact Sergeant, a mutual friend persuaded the pair to meet socially. While McCulloch and Sergeant were being reacquainted, the tapes from the McCulloch and Marr sessions disappeared. McCulloch was not upset about this as he and Sergeant had started working together as Electrafixion.|$|E
5|$|Now in a {{committed}} relationship, Rachel and Adam begin trying for a baby. The storyline was devised because Harries wanted Cold Feet to reflect relevant issues in contemporary society; {{in vitro fertilisation}} featured heavily in the news during 2000, and Harries felt that incorporating it into the series would help {{to raise awareness of}} it, as well as provide fodder for the characters' story arcs. Rachel's intracytoplasmic sperm injection treatment incorporated aspects of the real life IVF treatment experienced by Harries and his wife Rebecca Frayn, and eminent fertility scientist Sammy Lee was consulted extensively throughout the development of the plot. After spending several thousand pounds on IVF treatment, Rachel's doctor informs her that she is infertile due to Asherman's syndrome, most likely caused by her abortion. Despite being unable to have children naturally, Rachel and Adam are determined to continue their relationship; Adam proposes to her and they are married in a civil ceremony in Series 3, Episode 8. In the same episode, she is reunited with her estranged parents, Brian and Mary (Paul Ridley and Sue Holderness). Before the episode, Rachel <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>spoken</b> to them for years; her father because of his bigotry and abuse of her mother, and her mother for staying with him. She refuses to allow Paul to give her away, and instead asks David to, despite learning that he has been having an extra-marital affair. At the reception, she inadvertently reveals to her parents that her sister, their other daughter Lucy, has come out as a lesbian.|$|E

25|$|A {{jury was}} hastily {{selected}} for the second Quinlan trial, with the selection process completed {{in less than an}} hour.

Nevertheless, in the retrial Quinlan was found guilty as charged by the speedily-picked jury after just two hours of deliberations.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the band}} played the {{remaining}} 2016 tour dates that were already booked, the Wilson sisters only spoke to one another through third parties {{for the remainder of}} the tour.

The pair's relationship was strained by the incident; An April 2017 article in Rolling Stone reported that although they remain on amicable terms, they <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>spoken</b> to one another since the 2016 tour ended, and only sporadically contact one another through text messaging.|$|E

Herbert wrote in 1980 that though he <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>spoken</b> to Schoenherr prior to the artist creating the paintings, the author {{was surprised to find}} that the artwork appeared exactly as he had imagined its fictional subjects, including sandworms, Baron Harkonnen and the Sardaukar.|$|E
25|$|Fort Sumter raised Wigfall's white {{handkerchief}} on its flagpole as Wigfall departed in {{his small}} boat back to Morris Island, where he was hailed as a hero. The handkerchief was spotted in Charleston and a delegation of officers representing BeauregardStephen D. Lee, Porcher Miles, a former mayor of Charleston, and Roger Pryorsailed to Sumter, unaware of Wigfall's visit. Anderson was outraged when these officers disavowed Wigfall's authority, telling him that the former senator <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>spoken</b> with Beauregard for two days, and he threatened to resume firing. Meanwhile, General Beauregard himself had finally seen the handkerchief and sent {{a second set of}} officers, offering essentially the same terms that Wigfall had presented, so the agreement was reinstated.|$|E
25|$|For the film's release, Valentino {{travelled}} to London, {{staying there}} and in France, spending money with abandon while his divorce took place. Quite some time elapsed before he made another film, The Son of the Sheik, despite his hatred of the sheik image. The film began shooting in February 1926, with Valentino given his choice of director, and pairing him again with Vilma Bánky. The film used the authentic costumes he bought abroad and allowed him to play a dual role. Valentino was ill during production, but he needed {{the money to pay}} his many debts. The film opened on July 8, 1926, to great fanfare. During the premiere, Valentino was reconciled with Mathis; the two <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>spoken</b> in almost two years.|$|E

25|$|At that time, {{rumors that}} Hansen would begin {{pursuing}} a vulnerable franchise {{to relocate to}} Seattle began making the rounds.

While Hansen <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>spoken</b> in public about his desires or pursuits for a specific team, the rumors were rampant enough that Think Big Sacramento, a community action group created by Sacramento mayor Kevin Johnson to develop solutions for the Kings, composed an open letter to Hansen asking him not to pursue the city's team. Meanwhile, negotiations between McGinn, Constantine, and Hansen continued on development of a memorandum of understanding that would lay out the relationship for a public-private partnership on the new arena.|$|E
25|$|In his 1996 campaign, Zafy {{blamed the}} {{problems}} faced by Madagascar during his presidency on his opponents and the International Monetary Fund, and he downplayed {{the charges against him}} that had led to his impeachment. Although he had lost much of his support, {{in the first round of}} the election, held on 3 November, he was able to take second place with 23.39% of the vote, behind Ratsiraka's 36.61%. Zafy received some support in the second round from those who, despite their criticisms of Zafy, felt he was preferable to Ratsiraka, such as Interim President Norbert Ratsirahonana, who had unsuccessfully stood as a candidate in the first round. In the second round, held on 29 December, Zafy narrowly lost to Ratsiraka, taking 49.29% of the vote and losing by about 45,000 votes. He later alleged that the High Constitutional Court had switched the numbers for himself and Ratsiraka and said that he <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>spoken</b> of that at the time for the sake of peace.|$|E
25|$|After the Bulls' final {{title of}} the Jordan era in 1998, Jackson left the team vowing never to coach again, but after he took a year off he decided to give it another chance with the Lakers. Longtime friend of Krause and Bulls {{assistant}} coach Tex Winter, who was {{the architect of the}} triangle offense, stayed with the Bulls for another full season, leaving the organization in the summer of 1999, when Phil Jackson was hired to coach the Los Angeles Lakers. Krause said that he <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>spoken</b> to Jackson since. When Jordan was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2009, Krause was not in attendance. Krause said he would not attend the ceremony because of his personal boycott of the Hall of Fame over their refusal to induct Winter. Krause and Jackson briefly put their differences aside when Winter was finally inducted two years later. The two shook hands before the ceremony and conducted themselves in a cordial manner during Winter's segment.|$|E
