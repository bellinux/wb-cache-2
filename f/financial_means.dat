5|$|The {{first few}} naval battles were {{disasters}} for Rome. However, after training more sailors and inventing a grappling engine, a Roman naval force {{was able to}} defeat a Carthaginian fleet, and further naval victories followed. The Carthaginians then hired Xanthippus of Carthage, a Spartan mercenary general, to reorganise and lead their army. He cut off the Roman army from its base by re-establishing Carthaginian naval supremacy. The Romans then again defeated the Carthaginians in naval battle at the Battle of the Aegates Islands and left Carthage with neither a fleet nor sufficient <b>financial</b> <b>means</b> to raise one. For a maritime power {{the loss of their}} access to the Mediterranean stung financially and psychologically, and the Carthaginians sued for peace.|$|E

The family had limited <b>financial</b> <b>means,</b> but they camped and hiked together, and would put up amateur skits that were usually written by her father, and sometimes by her mother. Adams was enthusiastic about the plays and invariably played the lead in them.|$|E

5|$|It {{is likely}} that the castle was built by one of the earls of Chester, partly because of the cost and partly because Cheshire was a palatine county and the earl had {{authority}} over who was permitted to build castles. The earls were involved in the civil war of King Stephen’s reign {{in the middle of the}} 12th century commonly known as the Anarchy and the revolt against Henry II in 117374, both of which may have prompted castle building. Ranulf de Gernon, 4th Earl of Chester wanted control of the earldom of Carlisle but during the Anarchy it and much of northern England come under Scottish control. The construction of Buckton Castle may have been to safeguard Cheshire. These civil wars and rebellions would also have provided a context for the deliberate destruction of the castle. Alternatively the castle could have been built by William de Neville when he held the lordship of Longdendale under the earl of Chester between 1181 and 1186, though he may not have had the <b>financial</b> <b>means</b> to do so.|$|E
5|$|Representative {{of the new}} {{historical}} perspective is the 2003 biography by Pauline Croft. Reviewer John Cramsie summarises her findings:Croft's overall assessment of James is appropriately mixed. She recognises his good intentions in matters like Anglo-Scottish union, his openness to different points of view, and his agenda of a peaceful foreign policy within his kingdoms' <b>financial</b> <b>means.</b> His actions moderated frictions between his diverse peoples. Yet he also created new ones, particularly by supporting colonisation that polarised the crown's interest groups in Ireland, obtaining insufficient political benefit with his open-handed patronage, an unfortunate {{lack of attention to}} the image of monarchy (particularly after the image-obsessed regime of Elizabeth), pursuing a pro-Spanish foreign policy that fired religious prejudice and opened the door for Arminians within the English church, and enforcing unpalatable religious changes on the Scottish Kirk. Many of these criticisms are framed within a longer view of James' reigns, including the legacy – now understood to be more troubled – which he left Charles I.|$|E

5|$|The ousting of Aflaq, Bitar, and the National Command is {{the deepest}} schism in the Ba'ath movement's history. While {{there had been}} many schisms and splits in the Ba'ath Party, Aflaq and Bitar always emerged as the victors, and {{remained}} party leaders, but the 1966 coup brought {{a new generation of}} leaders to power who had different aims to their predecessors. While Aflaq and Bitar still had supporters in Syria and in non-Syrian Regional Branches, they were hampered by the lack of <b>financial</b> <b>means</b> – the Syrian Regional Branch had funded them since 1963. Jadid and his supporters now had the Syrian state at their disposal, and were theoretically able to establish new party organisations or coerce pro-Aflaq opinion, this failed to work since most of the regional branches changed their allegiance to Baghdad. Later in 1966, the first post-Aflaqite National Congress, officially designated the 9th, was held, and a new National Command was elected. Another change was to the ideological orientation of the Syrian Regional Branch and the new National Command; while the Aflaqites believed in an all-Arab Ba'ath Party and the unification of the Arab world, the Syria's new leaders saw this as impractical. Following the coup, the National Command became subservient in all but name to the Syrian Regional Command, and ceased to have an effective role in Arab or Syrian politics.|$|E

40|$|Title: Subsidies to {{the sports}} {{industry}} {{from the perspective of}} an entity active in Prague 5 Objectives: The aim of this thesis is to determine whether and to what extent it is effective to subsidize the sports industry through public sector budgets and whether obtaining grants is an important competitive advantage for entrepreneurs. This thesis should define and describe the basic concepts related {{to the sports}} industry and subsidies and simply and clearly explain the legislative changes introduced by the Czech civil Code valid from January 1, 2014. Methods: In this thesis, the method of analysis was applied. The data were obtained through in-depth written interview and from websites of individual ministries and organizations. Results: It was found out that that the individual agencies and ministries focus on certain economic entities through local or special-purpose criteria. In granting a subsidy, there are high demands of administrative nature for both the applicant and the provider. Taking into account the uncertainty of being granted the subsidy, the application may be very demanding - in terms of finance as well of time.

40|$|The {{financial}} and popular media report almost daily on {{the volatility of}} securities market prices. Yet, many people continue to buy securities to hedge against or speculate on certain risks. People can also buy or sell derivatives to hedge against or speculate on fluctuations in securities prices. This Article discusses three regulatory policy implications of utilizing derivatives markets to reallocate the bearing of securities price risks. First, if there are too few non-redundant derivative markets, a competitive market equilibrium allocation of securities price risks is typically constrained Pareto inefficient. This <b>financial</b> economic result <b>means</b> that for typical economies, a regulator can in principle improve social welfare by financial market interventions. Second, introducing some but not enough non-redundant derivatives markets has indeterminate normative consequences for the allocation of securities price risks. This <b>financial</b> economic result <b>means</b> that for typical economies, introducing a new derivative market can improve, worsen, or {{have no effect on}} the welfare of consumers and investors. Finally, government regulation might not improve the social allocation of securities price risks because of informational or political economy obstacles.
