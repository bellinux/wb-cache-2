5|$|Shout-out to Mariah Carey and {{her whole}} squad and my boy Chris Lighty. He got me and Mariah together. I {{appreciate}} it. He {{put me on}} there as well as her. Both of them are smart for doing that. The song came out hard. Mariah knew I {{wanted to do a}} song with her. It finally happened, and it turned out <b>hard.</b> <b>I</b> just flew up there to New York, went in the studio with her. I flew right out and went back on the road. When I do a song with people, I like to really get in the studio with them so I could feel they swag and they could feel mine. The music comes out better.|$|E

The people came out so heavy and so <b>hard.</b> <b>I</b> think it was exciting, {{especially}} to participate and experience it with them like that. Me and B have a good relationship. And {{to be able to have}} the chemistry we have and do it in a city that's so unique like that is unforgettable. The pictures speak a thousand words. So you saw the energy out there.

In an interview, Willis said, [...] "I have a warm spot in my heart for Die Hard..... it's just the sheer novelty {{of being able to}} play the same character over 25 years and still be asked back is fun. It's much more challenging to have to do a film again and try to compete with myself, which is what I do in Die <b>Hard.</b> <b>I</b> try to improve my work every time." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the same}} interview, Sapochnik was also asked {{about how he}} went about {{creating}} a sense of emotion in the 'King in the North' scene, saying [...] "It wasn't <b>hard.</b> <b>I</b> think as fans we'd been waiting for it for so long. That said, {{it was a very}} difficult scene to shoot. Mainly because it was unusually hot over the two days we shot it, everyone was wearing heavy furs and armor, Kit was actually pretty ill and everyone was crammed into this space full of plates of sheep's tongues and chicken carcasses so it got quite smelly and sticky. It's also quite a long scene and yet Bella did it probably more than a hundred times, only forgetting a line once in the entire time. When we finished the scene she got a standing ovation from all the cast and crew." ...|$|E

[...] The singer also decided to record [...] "Pretty Hurts" [...] because she wanted to shift her focus to the beauty industry, which she felt was [...] "the most humiliating, judgmental place you can be as a woman". She saw the track's theme as representation of [...] "finding that thing in the world that makes you truly happy," [...] and felt that the song was in line with the album's theme of [...] "finding beauty in imperfections". Speaking to iTunes Radio, Beyoncé explained: [...] "I feel like sometimes the world is a big contest, we're all being judged. I wanted to capture how humiliating and insecure that makes you feel." ...|$|E

500|$|Barbara Holper was the {{daughter}} of Hieronymus Holper, under whom Albrecht the Elder served his apprenticeship as a goldsmith. The two men became friends, and when she came of age Holper gave his daughter into marriage when Dürer senior was 40 and she was 15. The couple were compatible, well-matched and fond of each other. Yet their son's writings detail their difficult lives and many setbacks; three of their 18 children survived into adulthood – 17 of whom had been born by the time of this portrait. After her husband died Barbara was destitute and went to live with her son. After she in turn died in 1514, her son wrote [...] "This my pious Mother... often had the plague and many other severe and strange illnesses, and she suffered great poverty, scorn, contempt, mocking words, terrors, and great adversities. Yet she bore no malice. Also she died <b>hard...</b> <b>I</b> felt so grieved for her that I cannot express it." ...|$|E
500|$|Leroux {{stated that}} {{at a very early}} age, she knew she wanted to play for the United States women's {{national}} soccer team. To pursue her goal, she moved to Scottsdale, Arizona at the age of 15 and attended Horizon High School during her junior and senior years while living with multiple host families. Despite having a challenging time adjusting to life without her family and friends, she helped lead Sereno Soccer Club to state titles in 2007 and 2008. Of her move to the United States, she said, [...] "It was not easy. It {{was probably one of the}} most difficult things I ever had to do, move away from everything that I knew and was comfortable with to something that I had no idea about. Not having any family around. Doing it on my own. As a 15-year-old, that's kind of <b>hard.</b> <b>I</b> had to grow up really fast [...] But I guess it's all worth it. Now I have a chance to prove myself, and that's what I enjoy, and that's why I did what I did." ...|$|E
500|$|Taylor {{withstood}} {{a tremendous}} amount of punishment throughout the game. At one point in the first quarter, he bit his tongue while being tackled by Huff, causing him to swallow blood {{for the rest of the}} game. He also required six stitches at halftime to close a gash on his elbow. Some players wondered if he could even play in the second half. [...] "Taylor isn't human," [...] said Huff. [...] "No human being could have taken the punishment he got today." [...] Taylor described the contest in the locker room after the game, saying, [...] "I never took a worse beating on a football field. The Giants hit me hard, and then I hit the ground <b>hard.</b> <b>I</b> got it both ways. This was the toughest game I've ever played ... I just rammed it down their throats by letting my running do my talking. They couldn't rattle me ... I think Huff hit me with his elbow after a tackle. Anyway, I cut my tongue of all things." [...] Additionally, Taylor was playing while sick; two weeks later, he learned he had hepatitis, which contributed to his 15-pound weight loss prior to the game.|$|E

500|$|Bowie {{elected to}} play less {{well-known}} {{songs on the}} tour and avoided some of his bigger hits. He was eager to not repeat the formula that made the Serious Moonlight Tour a success, saying, [...] "It seemed so easy. It was cheers from the word go. You {{know how to get}} a reaction – play 'Changes,' 'Golden Years' and they'd be up on their feet. You get the reaction, take the money and run away. It seemed too easy. I didn't want to do that again." [...] In a different contemporary interview he said, [...] "I'm not doing 'Star' again. That was quite <b>hard.</b> <b>I</b> don't think I'm doing much Ziggy material on this tour! [...] Probably use a lot of that mid-70s material, but not the more ponderous things like 'Warszawa.' I tried that, and that was a bit yawn-making. There was one I was humming to myself the other day: [...] 'Baby, baby, I'll never let you down' – oh lord, what's that one? Jesus, I can't remember it. ... 'Sons of the Silent Age!' [...] Ah! That's right! Thank god I could remember it! So that for me now is a new song. I've never done that one onstage." [...] "Sons of the Silent Age" [...] was performed every night of the tour.|$|E
500|$|NBC {{executives}} {{tried to}} solve the problem so that both Leno and O'Brien would keep their jobs. Jeff Gaspin, the chairman of NBC Universal Television, instructed both parties that he did not wish to make a difficult decision but that the most appropriate solution was to move Leno back to his previous timeslot and push O'Brien to 12:05. Carter details a heated exchange between NBC executive Jeff Zucker and O'Brien's agent Rick Rosen during which Zucker told O'Brien's representatives he could enforce O'Brien's contract and [...] "ice him for two years", after details of the conflict were leaked to the media. The author cites O'Brien's disappointment with the perceived unfairness of the situation, and quotes O'Brien's comments at a meeting with NBC Entertainment and Universal Media Studios chairman Marc Graboff and Jeff Gaspin, [...] "I know how <b>hard</b> <b>I</b> worked for this. It was promised to me. I had a shitty lead-in." [...] Carter recounts how affiliates of NBC complained to the network about the poor ratings performance of Leno's program The Jay Leno Show. O'Brien asked the two NBC executives, [...] "What does Jay have on you? What does this guy have on you people? What the hell is it about Jay?" ...|$|E
500|$|Kaushik and {{his team}} taught the crew [...] "all [...] knew about hockey". In an interview, he later said that he [...] "taught him (Sahni) {{everything}} about the game, starting from how the camp is conducted, how the girls come from different backgrounds and cultures, the psychological factors involved. Also how the coach faces pressure to select girls from different states and teams". After Negi was suggested, the latter assembled a team of hockey players to train the actors. He later said that he [...] "trained the girls for six months. Waking up at 4, traveling from Kandivili to Churchgate. We would retire around 11 in the night. It was tiring. But {{we were on a}} mission ... They couldn't run; couldn't hold the hockey sticks. I ensured none of them [...] cut their nails or eyebrows (as the players do). The girls have worked very <b>hard.</b> <b>I</b> salute them". Some of the actors, such as Chitrashi, Sandia, and Raynia, were cast because they were hockey players. Rob Miller was the Sport Action Director, and worked with Negi to train the actors. About working with Khan, Negi recalled that everything was planned [...] "including the penalty stroke that SRK missed. That shot alone took us nearly 20 hours as I was keen that it should be very realistic. I took the help of a lot of my former teammates. But more importantly, it was so easy working with SRK. He is unbelievably modest and was willing to do as many re-takes as we wanted".|$|E

500|$|In July 2009, Coulter {{released}} [...] "Don't Miss You", which {{peaked at}} number24, {{as the lead}} single from her proposed third studio album, Hear No, See No, Speak No. The second single, the title track, was released in October 2009, and peaked at number46. Hear No, See No, Speak No was originally scheduled {{to be released in}} November 2009, but was pushed back for a January 2010 release. Coulter eventually decided to cancel the album's release due to the first two singles struggling on the charts. In March2010, Coulter was a supporting act for Backstreet Boys' Australian leg of their This Is Us Tour. That same year, her song [...] "Can't Touch It" [...] was featured on the soundtrack to the film, Sex and the City 2. Coulter announced via her official Twitter account on 2 July 2010, that she had parted ways with her manager of five years Lauren Brown. It was then revealed that her new manager was Sean Anderson of the management company 22. Coulter later parted ways with Anderson and became managed by her-then boyfriend Richard Harrison of Black Label Entertainment. Throughout 2010, Coulter put her music career on hold as she took on a full-time position as a breakfast radio presenter for Sydney's Nova 96.9, alongside Merrick Watts and Scott Dooley. During this time, Coulter had thoughts about quitting music. [...] "At the start of [...] year, I couldn't imagine walking in a studio and writing a song again. I didn't even want to get on stage and sing. I was over it. It's hard for me to say that even now. Music is all I've ever wanted to do. I wasn't mentally there any more. I wanted out, it was too <b>hard.</b> <b>I</b> felt like I'd been worn down. I felt defeated". She later stated that after attending a Thirty Seconds to Mars concert in Melbourne and rewatching Michael Jackson's [...] DVD, she was inspired to perform again.|$|E
500|$|Jeff Labrecque of Entertainment Weekly {{wrote that}} [...] "SeinfeldVision was a clever and ironic way to {{incorporate}} Seinfeld." [...] Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide said that [...] " [...] {{was a solid}} start to the new, fought-for season" [...] and that it did have [...] "some great, great moments." [...] Despite this praise, Webb Mitovich criticised Kenneth and Tracy's [...] "office wife" [...] storyline saying that [...] "we've seen this shtick before on countless other sitcoms, {{so it was a}} bit empty and filled with 'easy' jokes." [...] Criticism was also received regarding the [...] "striped outfit... it didn't work. No," [...] referring to a joke involving Jenna trying to distract the TGS writers from her newly gained weight. Lisa Schmeiser of Television Without Pity graded this episode as a [...] "B+." [...] Rick Porter of Zap2it thought that this episode [...] "started off [...] second season on a pretty strong note." [...] Porter said that this episode wasn't the best episode of 30 Rock but it was still [...] "one of the sharpest and wittiest comedies on television." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad wrote that [...] "SeinfeldVision" [...] "was a really funny beginning to the second season." [...] Sassone also notes that the appearance of Seinfeld did not feel like stunt casting. He also said that the joke about Jerry being able to buy NBC for $4 million was [...] "one of the many reasons [...] this show." [...] Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wrote that this episode [...] "proves the low-rated show's best comedy Emmy win was no undeserved fluke." [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger described this episode as [...] "really funny" [...] and thought that [...] "everyone is played in a style that's believable within [...]" [...] Linda Stasi of The New York Post said that [...] "the on-going story of the regulars that had me laughing so <b>hard</b> <b>I</b> almost fell out of bed." [...] Jake Brooks of The New York Observer thought that this episode was [...] "a rather poor 22 minutes of television (well, only [...] portion of it, the rest was pretty great)." [...] Robert Canning of IGN said that [...] "30 Rock delivers a fantastic episode to open the season. Let's hope they can also deliver an audience to keep this great show on the air." [...] Canning also awarded this episode a rating of 9.4 out of 10. Brian Lowry of Variety said that it [...] "neatly highlights this series' strengths and weaknesses, elevated by moments of inspiration and Alec Baldwin's brilliance and leavened by considerably-less-flattering silliness." [...] Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times thought that [...] "SeinfeldVision" [...] "is mostly a reminder that even the most talented actors and writers sometimes slip under pressure." [...] Seinfeld was criticized as using his appearance in this episode as a plug for his upcoming feature film Bee Movie. Seinfeld, NBC and General Electric stated that this was done as metahumor.|$|E
