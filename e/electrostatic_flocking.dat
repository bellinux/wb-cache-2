500|$|For the cape, {{director}} Christopher Nolan {{wanted to}} have a [...] "flowing cloak... that blows and flows as in so many great graphic novels". Hemming's team created the cape out of their own version of parachute nylon that had <b>electrostatic</b> <b>flocking,</b> a process shared with the team by the British Ministry of Defence. The process was used by the London police force to minimize night vision detection. The cape was topped by a cowl, which was designed by Nolan, Hemming, and costume effects supervisor Graham Churchyard. The cowl was created to be thin enough to allow motion but thick enough to avoid wrinkling when Bale turned his head in the Batsuit. Churchyard explained the cowl had been designed to show [...] "a man who has angst", so his character would be revealed through the mask.|$|E

40|$|To improve {{cultivation}} efficiency for microalgae Spirulina platensis {{is related}} to increase its potential use as food source and as an effective alternative for CO 2 fixation. The present work attempted to establish a technique, namely attached cultivation, for S. platensis. Laboratory experiments were made firstly to investigate optimal conditions on attached cultivation. The optimal conditions were found: 25 g m (2) for initial inoculum density using <b>electrostatic</b> <b>flocking</b> cloth as substrata, light intensity lower than 200 mu mol m (2) s (1), CO 2 enriched air flow (0. 5 %) at a superficial aeration rate of 0. 0056 m s (1) in a NaHCO 3 -free Zarrouk medium. An outdoor attached cultivation bench-scale bioreactor was built and a 10 d culture of S. platensis was carried out with daily harvesting. A high footprint areal biomass productivity of 60 g m (2) d (1) was obtained. The nutrition of S. platensis with attached cultivation is identical to that with conventional liquid cultivation.

40|$|Electrostatic {{precipitator}} (ESP) {{has been}} widely utilized to collect airborne particles in industrial and indoor ventilation systems. However, conventional ESP has not been used to remove gaseous pollutants from a gas flow. Recently, a wet-type ESP {{has been used for}} removing them. In this study, to improve the removal performance of gaseous pollutants and particulate matters, a wet-type ESP with a wet <b>electrostatic</b> <b>flocking</b> electrode was experimentally studied by measuring the removal efficiency of acetaldehyde and fine particles. And a carbon fabric plate as a collecting electrode was suggested to effectively remove ozone and fine particles in ESPs. Removal efficiency of acetaldehyde (CH 3 CHO: about 30 ppm) in one-pass test was about 68. 2 % at 8. 4 W of input power with residence time of 2. 1 s and high collection efficiency was obtained to submicron particles (0. 3 - 0. 5 Pm in diameter) with residence time of 1. 05 s. The combined system of the wet type ESP and ESP with a carbon fabric plate electrode also was examined for removing them. These results suggest that the wet-type ESP has a potential of the simultaneous removal of gaseous and particulate pollutants. 1...|$|E
40|$|This Master Thesis {{investigates the}} {{possibility}} to implement new innovative textile techniques for the manufacturing of fibre reinforced ceramics {{with the purpose of}} enhancing the interlaminar properties. A needling technique is developed that pushes fibre material into and through a laminate, creating a 3 -dimensional structure. This results in a stable structure that is suitable as a preform onto which a non-oxide ceramic matrix such as graphite or silicon carbide can be placed using a vapour deposition or vapour infiltration process. By manufacturing specimens made of unidirectional carbon fabrics and an epoxy matrix, the crack initiation and propagation during destructive testing is analysed. The study shows that the failure mechanism for such a needled material is changed during bending loads. This is due to the modification of the fibre structure that creates through the thickness fibres. It is demonstrated {{that it is possible to}} increase the energy absorption and the fracture toughness of the needled material. In addition, an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>flocking</b> procedure for creating interlaminar fibres is investigated using electromagnetic field theory combined with numerical analysis. Via theory and conventional techniques a manufacturing procedure for flocked material is developed and shown to display great potential for increasing interlaminar shear strength of any laminated fibre-reinforced material. Finally, {{the possibility to}} implement the above techniques into industry and the methods to do so is demonstrated. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E
