5|$|A ^ Rob {{was awarded}} the Dickin Medal in 1945 for taking part in more than 20 {{parachute}} <b>drops</b> <b>and</b> for his involvement in operations behind enemy lines in Italy and North Africa during the Second World War. There is evidence that his record is a hoax concocted by the training officer at 2nd SAS at the time so that the dog would remain with the regiment.|$|E
5|$|Like other boletes, Boletus pinophilus has small pores on the {{underside}} of its cap rather than gills. These are coloured white at first, becoming yellow with age and olivaceous-brown at full maturity. The spores are cylindric-ellipsoid, smooth, with oil <b>drops</b> <b>and</b> dimensions 15.520 by 4.55.5µm. They produce an olive-brown spore print.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} match saw Nakano challenging Blayze for the Women's Championship. Nakano {{used her}} size to perform such moves as leg <b>drops</b> <b>and</b> several submission holds. Blayze countered with aerial maneuvers like a hurricanrana and a spinning heel kick. Vachon got involved by choking Blayze while Nakano distracted the referee. The match ended when Nakano missed a diving leg drop, allowing Blayze to pin {{her for the}} win.|$|E

50|$|Overall, {{the layout}} of Twister II has {{similarities}} to the Mister Twister, but a noticeable difference is the helix entry. While Mister Twister went down the second <b>drop</b> <b>and</b> into the helix right away, Twister II leaves the second <b>drop</b> <b>and</b> goes up a double up hill, then makes another <b>drop</b> <b>and</b> rise, and enters the helix near the station. Because of this, {{the entrance to the}} tunnel does not cross over the second climb.|$|R
5|$|The game {{also offers}} {{objectives}} {{to be accomplished}} over multiple sessions, like making a six-letter word, or clearing three or more rows at once. This unlocks power-ups that occasionally provide opportunities such as halting the rate of new tetromino <b>drops,</b> <b>and</b> removing blocks from the screen. Up to three power-ups can be selected {{to be used in}} each game.|$|E
5|$|The {{positions}} {{specific to}} punt plays are the punter (P), long snapper, and gunner. The long snapper snaps the football {{directly to the}} punter, who then <b>drops</b> <b>and</b> kicks it before it hits the ground. Gunners line up split outside the line and race down the field, aiming to tackle the punt returner (PR) – the player that catches the punt.|$|E
5|$|Bezen Perrot enacted {{operations}} in January 1944. It was initially employed on guard and surveillance duty around German installations. It {{took part in}} the arrests of Jews, Service du travail obligatoire evaders and resistance fighters. Their knowledge of the Breton language proved to be a prized possession, enabling the German authorities to intercept arms <b>drops</b> <b>and</b> infiltrate Breton resistance networks who used it to encode their communications. In March, their civilian clothing was replaced with the uniforms of Waffen-SS, lacking any Breton insignia and they were armed with submachine guns, operating in conjunction with the French collaborationist Selbstschutz Polizei.|$|E

30|$|Here, {{we focus}} on {{verification}} of <b>drop</b> <b>and</b> cut-through operations and the reconfigurability of the proposed ROADM because insertion of wavelength channels and time slots for add operation can be also achieved by setting up almost the same optical system for <b>drop</b> <b>and</b> cut-through operations.|$|R
5|$|Cores {{are often}} drilled {{in areas such}} as Antarctica and central Greenland where the {{temperature}} is almost never warm enough to cause melting, but the summer sun can still alter the snow. In polar areas, the sun is visible day and night during the local summer and invisible all winter. It can make some snow sublimate, leaving the top inch or so less dense. When the sun approaches its lowest point in the sky, the temperature <b>drops</b> <b>and</b> hoar frost forms on the top layer. Buried under the snow of following years, the coarse-grained hoar frost compresses into lighter layers than the winter snow. As a result, alternating bands of lighter and darker ice can be seen in an ice core.|$|E
5|$|Taken together, {{analyses}} {{indicate that}} the impactor was large enough to create a 120-mile peak ring, to melt, shock and eject granite from many miles within the earth, to create colossal water movements, and to eject an immense quantity of vaporized rock and sulfates into the atmosphere, where they would have persisted over years to decades. This global dispersal of dust and sulfates would {{have led to a}} sudden and catastrophic effect on the climate worldwide, large temperature <b>drops,</b> <b>and</b> devastated the food chain. The researchers stated that the impact generated an environmental calamity that extinguished life, but it also induced a vast subsurface hydrothermal system that became an oasis for the recovery of life.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} {{five different}} terrain settings with each level being {{played on a}} large map divided into several missions. These missions include seek-and-destroy, search-and-rescue, escorts, the destruction of bridges, supply <b>drops</b> <b>and</b> air support. In some sections the player forms part of a coordinated attack with AI-controlled allies, while in others the player directs ground troops {{in the style of}} a real-time strategy game. As well as engaging in combat, the player must monitor and replenish his fuel and ammunition supplies. The heads-up display shows this information, along with intelligence on missions objectives and on friendly and enemy units and their locations. The compass indicating mission objectives is a feature new to Nuclear Strike, as is a radar showing the positions of nearby enemies.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{the notion}} of {{declarative}} goals as used in agent programming is central. Declarative goals describe desirable states and are updated during the execution of an agent. These goal dynamics are analyzed by distinguishing and formalizing various notions of goal <b>dropping</b> <b>and</b> goal adoption. Furthermore, possible motivations for an agent to drop or adopt goals are identified. Based on these motivations, we define specific mechanisms for implementing <b>dropping</b> <b>and</b> adoption. We show how these mechanisms {{are related to the}} general definitions of <b>dropping</b> <b>and</b> adoption...|$|R

5|$|At midnight, Homer quietly {{gets out}} of bed, visits each family member, who are all asleep, and says goodbye. Feeling glum, {{he goes to the}} living room and listens to Larry King read the Bible on tape. The tape plays out to which {{suddenly}} his head <b>drops</b> <b>and</b> it appears he has succumbed to the poison. Marge awakens the next morning and is panicked that her husband is not by her side. She runs downstairs and finds Homer, collapsed in the armchair. As she mourns, she realizes that his drool is still warm. She wakes him up and drums in {{the fact that he is}} alive and had not been poisoned after all. Homer then prances around in an overjoyed state and vows to live life to its fullest. Back to living his normal life, Homer returns to the couch watching a bowling tournament and eating pork rinds.|$|E
5|$|Like its {{predecessors}} in the Tony Hawk's series, Underground {{is centered on}} skateboarding {{in a series of}} levels. The player performs tricks via combinations of analog stick and button inputs. For example, the player initiates an ollie (a jump trick) by holding and releasing the jump button. During an ollie, the player may change the position of the analog stick and press one of two buttons to perform either a flip trick (such as an impossible or kickflip) or a grab trick (such as a benihana or nosegrab). The player can grind on certain edges and rails; different tricks may be performed during a grind based on the position of the analog stick. On quarter pipes, the player may execute lip tricks. While skating on flat surfaces, the player may manual in multiple ways via button combinations. Miscellaneous tricks include acid <b>drops</b> <b>and</b> wall-rides.|$|E
5|$|The {{ranges of}} the American and Chinese {{alligator}} extend into regions that sometimes experience periods of frost in winter. Being ectothermic, the internal body temperature of crocodilians falls {{as the temperature}} <b>drops,</b> <b>and</b> they become sluggish. They may become more active on warm days, but do not usually feed at all during the winter. In cold weather, they remain submerged with their tails in deeper, less cold water and their nostrils just projecting through the surface. If ice forms on the water, they maintain ice-free breathing holes, {{and there have been}} occasions when their snouts have become frozen into the ice. Temperature sensing probes implanted in wild American alligators have found that their core body temperatures can descend to around , but as long as they remain able to breathe they show no ill effects when the weather warms up.|$|E

5|$|As an {{insufficient}} number of transport aircraft were {{allocated to the}} brigade, it was only possible to transport 3rd Parachute Battalion by air, with the battalion's strength consisting of its headquarters staff and 'B' and 'C' companies. The battalion landed at Gibraltar at dawn on 10 November, and its commander, Lieutenant Colonel Geoffrey Pine Coffin, was informed that the battalion was scheduled to conduct an airborne operation the next day. Pine Coffin was briefed by Lt. Gen. Kenneth Anderson, commander of the British First Army, on the mission; it was to take off from the airfield at Maison Blanche and conduct a parachute drop to capture an airfield near the port of Bône, which bordered both Tunisia and Algeria. It was known by Allied intelligence that a battalion of German Fallschirmjaeger were currently stationed at Tunis, {{and that they were}} likely to be given the same task; as such, it was vital that the two companies capture the airfield first. Once this had been achieved, it would then hold the airfield until relieved by No. 6 Commando, which would conduct an amphibious landing, capture Bône itself and link up with the battalion. This was a challenging task for Pine Coffin, as the battalion had arrived in fewer Dakotas than it would need to conduct a parachute drop, and two aircraft had failed to arrive at Gibraltar; however, sufficient aircraft were found and at 04:30 on 11 November they took off from Gibraltar, landing at Maison Blanche at 09:00. However, since the American pilots flying the Dakotas had no experience with night <b>drops,</b> <b>and</b> locating drop zones in darkness was extremely difficult, it was decided to delay the mission until dawn on 12 November.|$|E
5|$|Both of {{the episodes}} contain a {{different}} set of enemies in their levels, which the player must stun or avoid. The first episode contains a variety of alien creatures, including large slugs, giant bouncing mushrooms, and flying bats, while the second contains different types of robots and alien energy beings. Levels can also include hazards, such as dart traps or fire; touching a hazard or most enemies causes Keen to lose a life, and the game is ended if all of Keen's lives are lost. The episodes feature three difficulty settings, which change the number and types of enemies present. While Vorticons contained a raygun and the in-between episode Commander Keen in Keen Dreams had pellets that temporarily stunned enemies, Goodbye, Galaxy features a stun gun that knocks out most enemies permanently using ammo found throughout the game. Different enemies take differing numbers of shots to kill, or in some cases are immune. The player can also find food items throughout the levels which grant points, with an extra life awarded with enough points. The first episode also contains water droplets which award an extra life for every 100 <b>drops,</b> <b>and</b> the second green drinks which do the same. There are also colored keycards which grant access to locked parts of levels, and items which instantly grant an extra life.|$|E
