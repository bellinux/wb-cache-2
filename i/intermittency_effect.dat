The rise of factorial moments and cumulants with decreasing phase-space volume is stronger when evaluated in three than in lower dimensions. Ratios of slopes are easier to obtain than the slopes themselves. Contrary to earlier findings, they turn out {{to depend on the}} dimension. The order dependence of the averaged ratios is better described by a Lévy stable law solution with μ= 1. 6 than by Gaussian approximation of the α-model (μ= 2) or a second order phase transition (μ= 0), but values μ> 2 inconsistent with Lévy-type fluctuations are reached in a three-dimensional analysis.

40|$|We are {{interested}} in the analysis of Gibbs measures defined on two independent Brownian paths in R^d interacting through a mutual self-attraction. This is expressed by the Hamiltonian ∫∫_ R^ 2 d V(x-y) μ(d x) ν(d y) with two probability measures μ and ν representing the occupation measures of two independent Brownian motions. We will be interested in class of potentials V which are singular, e. g., Dirac or Coulomb type interactions in R^ 3, or the correlation function of the parabolic Anderson problem with white noise potential. The mutual interaction of the Brownian paths inspires a compactification of the quotient space of orbits of product measures, which is structurally different from the self-interacting case introduced in MV 14, owing to the lack of shift-invariant structure in the mutual interaction. We prove a strong large deviation principle for the product measures of two Brownian occupation measures in such a compactification, and derive asymptotic path behavior under Gibbs measures on Wiener paths arising from mutually attracting singular interactions. For the spatially smoothened parabolic Anderson model with white noise potential, our analysis allows a direct computation of the annealed Lyapunov exponents and a strict ordering of them implies the <b>intermittency</b> <b>effect</b> present in the smoothened model.

40|$|We {{report an}} {{experimental}} {{investigation of the}} statistical time dynamic of spatial Fourier modes in a fully developped turbulent jet flow. Measurements rely on an original acoustic scattering technique, allowing the direct and continuous probing {{in a time of}} spatial Fourier modes of the turbulent vorticity field at well defined spatial wavevectors. From the recordings of the amplitude of the spatial Fourier modes corresponding to different wavevectors in the inertial range, we compute the time correlation functions of the modal amplitude. The modal vorticity dynamics exhibits two well separated time scales: a short one which is scale dependant and related to the well known sweeping effect (random advection), and a much longer one, of order the integral time scale, which is not scale dependent. By computing the cross-correlation of the amplitude of two different wavevectors, we evidence a clear statistical dependance between scales, whatever their separation, at variance with the original Kolmogorov 41 theory. We ascribe our experimental results to a manifestation of a new type of statistical intermittency. We call this new statistical feature a large scale time <b>intermittency</b> <b>effect,</b> in contrast with the usual small scale spatial intermittency reported in Eulerian velocity measurements.

40|$|We {{examine the}} effects of {{turbulent}} intermittency on the deflagration to detonation transition (DDT) in Type Ia supernovae. The Zel’dovich mechanism for DDT requires the formation of a nearly isothermal region of mixed ash and fuel that is larger than a critical size. We primarily consider the hypothesis by Khokhlov et al. and Niemeyer and Woosley that the nearly isothermal, mixed region is produced when the flame makes the transition to the distributed regime. We use two models for the distribution of the turbulent velocity fluctuations to estimate the probability {{as a function of the}} density in the exploding white dwarf that a given region of critical size is in the distributed regime due to strong local turbulent stretching of the flame structure. We also estimate lower limits on the number of such regions as a function of density. We find that the distributed regime, and hence perhaps DDT, occurs in a local region of critical size at a density at least a factor of 2 − 3 larger than predicted for mean conditions that neglect intermittency. This factor brings the transition density to be much larger than the empirical value from observations in most situations. We also consider the <b>intermittency</b> <b>effect</b> on the more stringent conditions for DDT by Lisewski et al. and Woosley. We find that a turbulent velocity of 10 8 cm/s in a region of size 10 6 cm, required by Lisewski et al., is rare. We expect that intermittency gives a weaker effect on the Woosley model with stronger criterion. The predicted transition density from this criterion remains below 10 7 g/cm 3 after accounting for intermittency using our intermittency models.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references: p. 68 - 71. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. A nonlinear hybrid wave model (HWM) is developed. It uses the conventional mode-coupling method (MCM) and the phase modulation method (PMM) to address the nonlinear interactions between free-wave components in an ocean wave field. The PMM is a complementary solution to the divergence of the MCM because the MCM may not converge if the wave lengths of the two interacting wave components are quite different. The HWM divides a wave spectrum into several wave bands and employs the MCM to formulate the wave-wave interactions of close frequency wave components and the PMM to formulate interactions of wave components that are relatively fax apart in the frequency domain. Wave kinematics under irregular ocean waves is predicted by the HWM. The nonlinear effects on the kinematics are significant above the still water level (swl). For non-narrow spectra the prediction of wave kinematics by the MCM may be divergent. The HWM is applied to study the wave nonlinearity and surface <b>intermittency</b> <b>effects</b> on a single degree of freedom (SDOF) structure. It is concluded that the surface <b>intermittency</b> <b>effects</b> and wave nonlinearity are both important under relatively strong nonlinear waves when linear wave theory and modified linear theory may considerably underestimate the wave forces. The sensitivity of wave forces to the cutoff frequency, that was found by Hu et al. (1995), is caused by the divergence of the MCM for broad-band and relatively steep spectra.

A good understanding of the market competition is key to making better regulation, contract, and investment decisions. The goal of this thesis is to study the following market competition problems: (1) the competition between flexible generators with fast ramping rates and inflexible generators with constant production rates, (2) {{the effect of the}} renewable generation penetration and production based subsidies on the competition and operating efficiency, (3) generation competition in transmission constrained networks, and (4) competition in the capacity expansion of electricity networks. We first consider a centralized electricity model and find that reducing the production based subsidies to renewable plants dampens their <b>intermittency</b> <b>effect</b> through controlled curtailment, cuts operational cost, and improves the system's balance. We then consider an oligopoly in which generators submit supply function bids and analyze a supply function equilibrium (SFE) model with generators that have different ramping rates. We find that the controlled curtailment of renewables has an additional benefit in oligopolistic markets as it can reduce generator market power, which has favorable operational efficiency and electricity price ramifications. We also find that the classical SFE model is inadequate for modeling renewables and inflexible generators, and can grossly overestimate the competition intensity. We modify the SFE model to account for these issues. Afterwards, a Bertrand model is used to study the duopoly competition in a transmission constrained network. We find that adding transmission constraints in this model does not change the bidding policy, instead it changes the critical demand levels at which firms revise their position from competitive to aggressive bidding.

Extended self-similarity scaling exponents of the second, fourth, and fifth order structure functions remain relatively constant as a function of height in the far-wake; whereas in the near-wake, these are highly affected by the passage of the rotor where tip vortices reside, thus showing a dependence on physical location. When comparing with proposed models, these generally overpredict the structure functions in the far-wake region. The probability density function distributions in the far-wake region display wider tails compared to the near-wake region, and the constant skewness hypothesis based on the local isotropy is disrupted in the wake...|$|R
