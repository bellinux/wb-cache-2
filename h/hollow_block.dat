40|$|Dissertation {{focuses on}} the {{verification}} of construction family houses made of concrete shell block with internal thermal insulation system. The construction technology is transferred to the Czech Republic from France. The work focuses on building envelope. The suitability of implementation is assessed {{on the basis of}} verification selected thermal technical requirements placed on building envelope. Requirements are specified by legislation in force in the ČR. The verification was performed by using software simulations and measurements on realized buildings. Critical areas of construction technology were identified on the basis software simulations and measurements on site. It was suggested solution, in which critical areas comply the thermal technical requirements. The building envelope was checked also using the thermography imaging on site. Continuous measurement of interior temperature was used to evaluate thermal comfort in the room. In the completed buildings was tested airtightness of the building envelope, which revealed other critical areas of the building envelope. Critical areas are necessary to solve with sufficient care.

40|$|This study {{considered}} {{the production and}} testing of sandcrete <b>hollow</b> <b>blocks</b> and laterite interlocking blocks {{with a view to}} comparing their physical characteristics and production cost. Some units of sandcrete <b>hollow</b> <b>blocks</b> and laterite interlocking blocks were made using machine vibrated sandcrete block mould and hydraulic interlocking block making machine respectively. The blocks were tested to determine their density and compressive strength. The results obtained from the tests were compared with the specifications of Nigerian Building and Road Research Institute (2006), Nigerian Building Code (2006), and Nigerian Industrial Standards (2000). The results indicated that the compressive strength of 225 mm and 150 mm sandcrete <b>hollow</b> <b>blocks</b> varies from 1. 59 N/mm 2 to 4. 25 N/mm 2 and 1. 48 N/mm 2 to  3. 35 N/mm 2 respectively, as the curing age increases from 7 to 28 days. For laterite interlocking blocks, the strength varies from 1. 70 N/mm 2 at 7 days to 5. 03 N/mm 2 at 28 days.  All the blocks produced satisfied the minimum requirements in terms of compressive strength, by all available codes. The cost per square metre of 225 mm and 150 mm sandcrete hollow blocks are ₦ 2, 808 : 00 and ₦ 2, 340 : 00 respectively, while that of laterite interlocking blocks is ₦ 2, 121 : 20.

50|$|Operation of a diffusional thermal cooling CPC is {{depicted}} on the right. Air {{passes through a}} <b>hollow</b> <b>block</b> of porous material {{in contact with the}} working liquid, the block being heated to ensure high vapour content. Then the humified air enters the cooler where nucleation occur. Temperature difference between the heater and the cooler determines the supersaturation, which in its turn determines the minimal size of particles that will be detected (the greater the difference, the smaller particles get counted). As proper nucleation conditions occur {{in the center of the}} flow, sometimes incoming flow is divided: most of it undergoes filtering and forms the sheath flow, which the rest of flow, still containing particles, is inserted into via a capillary. The more uniform is obtained supersaturation, the sharper is particle minimal size cutoff. During the heterogeneous nucleation process in the nucleation chamber, particles grow up to 10…12 μm large and so are conveniently detected by usual techniques, such as laser nefelometry (measurement of light pulses scattered by the grown-up particles).|$|E
50|$|Udukku is {{a smaller}} version of Edakka, shaped like an hour glass. The {{instrument}} is about 8 to 10 inches long with a girth of 6 to 8 inches {{on both ends}} and tapering towards the centre.

Brass bodies are also used in some parts. The ends of the instrument is covered across the mouth with cured and dried animal hide, goat skin is the preferred leather. Hoops are placed {{on the edge of}} the instrument body and the skin is tightened using strings woven from end to end. Udukku is played on one side and the non playing side is provided with one or two metallic wire snares, enabling the player to generate more resonance. A strap made of cloth is fixed to the middle of the instrument for clasping it. Coloured balls made of cotton strings are also placed hanging from the instrument as an embellishment.|$|E
5000|$|The distinctive, and unusual, {{feature of}} the engine was its use of wet liners to form the {{cylinders}}. Rather than the cylinders being bored into the cast-iron block, separate thin-walled steel tubes were inserted into a <b>hollow</b> <b>block.</b> The space between liner and block formed a large uninterrupted water jacket, which improved cooling, as did the thin tubes of the liners. The liners only loosely installed into the block with hand pressure. They sealed into the block at the bottom {{by a pair of}} soft metal [...] "spectacle washers" [...] that each sealed a pair of liners. Each liner stood slightly proud of the cylinder block face. so that it formed a good seal against the head gasket when assembled. Such wet liners had been used in high performance engines for many years, but this was an early use of them for a low-cost, mass-production engine. Particularly with the advanced grinding techniques necessary to make such a thin-walled tube with good concentricity and surface finish, other manufacturers saw them as over-complex. However Banner Lane's building of sleeve-valve Bristol engines during the war had given them the necessary experience and equipment. Throughout the engine's service it was seen as a dependable and reliable, if slightly staid and tractor-like, engine and these liners never gave the trouble experienced by other engines such as the much later Rover K-series.|$|E
