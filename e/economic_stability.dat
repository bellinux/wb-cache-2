5|$|Hitler was {{appointed}} Chancellor of Germany by the President of the Weimar Republic Paul von Hindenburg on 30 January 1933. The Nazi Party {{then began to}} eliminate all political opposition and consolidate its power. Hindenburg died on 2 August 1934 and Hitler became dictator of Germany by merging the powers and offices of the Chancellery and Presidency. A national referendum held 19 August 1934 confirmed Hitler as sole Führer (leader) of Germany. All power was centralised in Hitler's person and his word became above all laws. The government was not a coordinated, co-operating body, but a collection of factions struggling for power and Hitler's favour. In {{the midst of the}} Great Depression, the Nazis restored <b>economic</b> <b>stability</b> and ended mass unemployment using heavy military spending and a mixed economy. Extensive public works were undertaken, including the construction of Autobahnen (motorways). The return to <b>economic</b> <b>stability</b> boosted the regime's popularity.|$|E
5|$|<b>Economic</b> <b>stability</b> {{returned}} with the U.S. entry into World War II in 1941, when demand for the state's agricultural and industrial products grew as the nation mobilized for war. In 1944, the Pick–Sloan Plan was passed {{as part of the}} Flood Control Act of 1944 by the U.S. Congress, resulting in the construction of six large dams on the Missouri River, four of which are at least partially in South Dakota. Flood control, hydroelectricity, and recreational opportunities such as boating and fishing are provided by the dams and their reservoirs.|$|E
5|$|In 1792, {{with their}} {{relationship}} completely ruptured, Jefferson unsuccessfully {{tried to convince}} Washington to remove Hamilton, but Washington largely supported Hamilton's ideas, believing that they had led to social and <b>economic</b> <b>stability.</b> Dissonance over Hamilton's proposals also irrevocably broke the relationship between Washington and Madison, who had served as the president's foremost congressional ally {{during the first year}} of his presidency. Opponents of Hamilton and the administration won several seats in the 1792 Congressional elections, and Hamilton was unable to win Congressional approval of his ambitious economic proposals afterward.|$|E

5|$|In April 1956, Marshall led a {{delegation}} to London to negotiate for complete self-rule in the Merdeka Talks, but the talks failed when the British {{were reluctant to}} give up control over Singapore's internal security.

5|$|Modern {{macroeconomics}} {{can be said}} to {{have begun}} with Keynes and the publication of his book The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money in 1936.

5|$|The Bubonic Plague struck Gaza {{again in}} 1839 and the city, lacking {{political}} and <b>economic</b> <b>stability,</b> {{went into a}} state of stagnation.

However, the battles brought about more death and destruction in Gaza whilst the city was still recovering from the effects of the plague.|$|E
40|$|Italy and the Eurozone {{are heading}} in the year 2012 into a {{financial}} depression of unprecedented magnitude, with a forthcoming multitude of often contradictory public <b>economic</b> and financial <b>stability</b> emergency interventions whose ultimate endogenous and exogenous effects on public and private health spending and on the sustainability of universal coverage are difficult to predict ex ante. The research question is to assess whether {{it is possible to}} synthesise into a single and simple quantitative index such multitude of public <b>economic</b> and financial <b>stability</b> interventions and assess their magnitude and direction towards increasing or decreasing sustainability of publicly funded health care and universal coverage. We have analyzed the Italian <b>Economic</b> and <b>Stability</b> Reform Program 2011 - 2014 and we have proposed a quantitative synthetic sustainability index σ based on simple partial and absolute differential equations. The sustainability index σ highlights that in case the growth of the GDP in the period 2011 - 2014 be insufficient - as is already the case in the first semester of 2012 - all the assumptions on which the Italian <b>Economic</b> and <b>Stability</b> Reform Program 2011 - 2014 rests will fall, and Universal Coverage will become unsustainable. Health and Public Health professionals should intervene immediately with Italian and Eurozone national budgets planners and financial health regulators before unselective exogenously induced health financing and provision shortages produce irreparable epidemiological effects.

5|$|The Mongol army {{administered}} the Yam. The Yam stretched across Mongol territory from Eastern Europe to the Pacific Ocean. The routes were well organised, funded, maintained, and administrated by the Mongols. This highly sophisticated system {{of communication and}} travel made it relatively easy to send important messages and travel long distances in relatively short amounts of time. As {{a result of the}} relatively lucid communication and ease of movement, the Mongols were able to govern their vast empire effectively, thus ensuring political and <b>economic</b> <b>stability.</b>|$|E
5|$|Weber also {{proposed}} a socioevolutionary model of religious change, showing that in general, societies {{have moved from}} magic to polytheism, then to pantheism, monotheism and finally, ethical monotheism. According to Weber, this evolution occurred as the growing <b>economic</b> <b>stability</b> allowed professionalisation {{and the evolution of}} ever more sophisticated priesthood. As societies grew more complex and encompassed different groups, a hierarchy of gods developed and as power in the society became more centralised, the concept of a single, universal God became more popular and desirable.|$|E
5|$|Debates over {{rules and}} {{schedules}} {{might have been}} solvable had the league achieved <b>economic</b> <b>stability</b> but losses amongst American teams were drastic and widespread. In 1995 alone, Fred Anderson estimated that the U.S. teams had collectively lost more than US$20 million. The Baltimore Sun provides a similar estimate of US$21 million. The $10 million estimated loss in Birmingham was the most substantial, followed by US$4 to $6 million estimated for Anderson's Texans. Memphis and Shreveport losses were estimated at about US$3 million apiece. The Baltimore losses were comparatively modest at US$1 to $1.5 million, but stung the league given {{the prestige of the}} franchise.|$|E

5|$|During the {{oil boom}} of the 1970s, Nigeria joined OPEC and the huge oil {{revenues}} it was generating enriched the economy. Despite these revenues, the military government did little to improve {{the standard of living}} of the population, help small and medium businesses, or invest in infrastructure. As oil revenues fueled the rise of federal subsidies to states, the federal government became the centre of political struggle and the threshold of power in the country. As oil production and revenue rose, the Nigerian government became increasingly dependent on oil revenues and on international commodity markets for budgetary and economic concerns. It did not develop alternate revenue sources in the economy for <b>economic</b> <b>stability.</b> That spelled doom to federalism in Nigeria.|$|E
5|$|The Bubonic Plague {{struck again}} in 1839 {{and the city}} stagnated, as it lacked {{political}} and <b>economic</b> <b>stability.</b> In 1840, Egyptian and Ottoman troops battled outside of Gaza, with the Ottomans emerging victorious, effectively ending Egyptian rule over Palestine. The battles brought about more death and destruction, just barely after the city began {{to recover from the}} plague. The Church of Saint Porphyrius was renovated in 1856, and in 1874, French orientalist Charles Clermont-Ganneau visited Gaza, gathering and cataloging a sizable collection of Byzantine inscriptions and describing the city's Great Mosque in detail. Sultan Abdul Hamid II had the wells of Gaza restored in 1893.|$|E

5|$|Welfare was expanded, as {{characterized}} {{by the introduction of}} non-contributory old-age pensions and payments to mothers provided their babies are taken for health checks and that their children attend school. Hundreds of free tractors were also handed out. The prices of gas and many foodstuffs were controlled, and local food producers were made to sell in the local market rather than export. A new state-owned body was also set up to distribute food at subsidized prices. All these measures helped to curb inflation, while the economy grew (partly because of rising public spending), accompanied by stronger public finances which brought <b>economic</b> <b>stability.</b>|$|E
5|$|A 2002 study {{conducted}} by CARE International across three districts in the Central Region of Malawi considers how HIV/AIDS has affected economic well-being in rural Malawi. When skilled laborers are infected with HIV, they are usually unable to work; therefore, they often shift agricultural production on their land to less labor-intensive crops, sacrificing the opportunity to grow more profitable, labor-intensive crops such as tobacco. When family members fall ill with HIV/AIDS, their relatives invest time in their treatment and care, further reducing household productivity. In addition, when family members are infected with HIV, households often use the money they would normally invest in agriculture to cover medical expenses, further decreasing <b>economic</b> <b>stability</b> at the household level. Finally, when adults contract HIV, their children often remain home from school {{to work in the}} fields, threatening long-term productivity and economic advancement in Malawi.|$|E
5|$|Bulgarian {{nationalism}} gradually {{emerged during}} the mid-19th century with the economic upsurge of Bulgarian merchants and craftsmen, the development of Bulgarian-funded popular education, the struggle for an autonomous Bulgarian Church and political actions towards {{the formation of a}} separate Bulgarian state. The First and Second Serbian Uprisings had laid the foundation of an autonomous Serbia during the late 1810s, and Greece had been established as an independent state in 1832, {{in the wake of the}} Greek War of Independence. However, support for gaining independence through an armed struggle against the Ottomans was not universal. Revolutionary sentiment was concentrated largely among the more educated and urban sectors of the populace. There was less support for an organized revolt among the peasantry and the wealthier merchants and traders, who feared that Ottoman reprisals would jeopardize <b>economic</b> <b>stability</b> and widespread rural land ownership.|$|E

5|$|Macrinus {{began to}} {{overturn}} Caracalla's fiscal policies and moved closer towards {{those that had}} been set forth by Septimius Severus. One such policy change involved the pay of Roman legionnaires. The soldiers that were already enlisted during Caracalla's reign enjoyed exorbitant payments which were impossible for Macrinus to reduce without risking a potential rebellion. Instead, Macrinus allowed the enlisted soldiers to retain their higher payments, but he reduced the pay of new recruits to the level which had been set by Severus. Macrinus revalued the Roman currency, increasing the silver purity and weight of the denarius from 50.78 percent and 1.66 grams at the end of Caracalla's reign to 57.85 percent and 1.82 grams from Fall 217 {{to the end of his}} reign, so that it mirrored Severus' fiscal policy for the period 197–209 A.D. Macrinus' goal with these policies might have been to return Rome to the relative <b>economic</b> <b>stability</b> that had been enjoyed under Severus' reign, though it came with a cost. The fiscal changes that Macrinus enacted might have been tenable had it not been for the military. By this time, the strength of the military was too great and by enacting his reforms he angered the veteran soldiers, who viewed his actions in reducing the pay of new recruits as a foreshadowing of eventual reductions in their own privileges and pay. This significantly reduced Macrinus' popularity with the legions that had declared him emperor.|$|E

40|$|Financial {{stability}} {{is as important}} a policy objective as maintaining monetary <b>stability</b> if <b>economic</b> growth and <b>stability</b> are to be achieved and sustained. A prerequisite for more effective official oversight is {{the development and implementation}} of a better framework for assessing the ability of the financial system to perform its key economic functions, i. e. matching needs of savers and investors, providing transactions and payments services; risk pricing, spreading, sharing, and management; and the production, processing, and monitoring of information. However, the ultimate goal is sustained <b>economic</b> growth, <b>stability,</b> and prosperity. The purpose of this paper is twofold: first, to discuss a definition of financial stability and a framework for policy analysis more closely aligned with economic processes and efficiency; and second, to examine the implications and challenges for assessing systemic risk and the safeguarding of financial-system stability. ...|$|R
