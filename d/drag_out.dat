5|$|The game, played under rugby rules, was {{a battle}} from {{beginning}} to enda regular knock down and <b>drag</b> <b>out</b> fight. Both sides became immediately excited and the audience was aroused to the highest pitch of enthusiasm by the spirited contest. The ball oscillated backward and forward over the ground without any material result.|$|E
5|$|Katherine Marlowe is {{the main}} {{antagonist}} of Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception. She is the coldly calculating leader of a secret society whose roots date back over four hundred years {{to the court of}} Queen Elizabeth I. She has a long-standing rivalry with Nathan Drake over Sir Francis Drake’s ring – something they both contend is rightfully theirs and is also the key to an ancient mystery. Katherine Marlowe is a much more cerebral enemy than Drake has confronted in the past, using both psychological and physical tactics to get what she is after. Marlowe also has the assistance of her team of highly trained agents in this secret society – they are far more elusive and dangerous than the hired guns Nathan Drake and Victor Sullivan have faced before. She treats her subordinates with slight disdain, getting annoyed with Talbot for hiring Charlie Cutter. Marlowe appears to have studied Nathan's past and reveals that he's not actually the direct decedent of Sir Francis Drake - he was merely in an orphanage named after the great explorer. She first meets a teenage Drake in Colombia, forcing him to give her the Cipher disk he had just stolen from a museum to her but fails to get Sir Francis Drakes ring when he runs off. Twenty years later, she meets with Drake in an Alleyway and steals his ring. However, she soon discovers it's a fake and promptly loses both the disc and the ring when Drake steals both. Marlowe then sends Talbot and her agents to France and Syria, successfully getting the clues to the location of Ubar. She then captures Nate and Sully and leaves for the lost city. Nathan eventually finds her using a winch to <b>drag</b> <b>out</b> King Solomon's hallucinogenic Talisman from the lakes in Ubar and destroys the foundations of the city, causing Marlowe to fall into a pool of quicksand. Though Drake attempts to save her, Marlowe submerges and dies.|$|E

After an emotional split, he realizes he has left some books in her apartment. Jerry tries to convince George {{that he does not}} need the books, as he has already read them, but George is nevertheless able to persuade Jerry to get them for him. To retrieve the books, Jerry decides to go on a date with Marlene, during which she tells him that she and Jerry can still be friends, despite her recent break-up. Jerry and Marlene start dating; but, after a while, Jerry finds her just as annoying as George did. He wants to break up with her, but is unable to because she has a [...] "psycho-sexual" [...] hold on him.|$|E

500|$|Niels Matthijs, {{writing for}} Twitch Film, stated that [...] "It's astounding how van Dormael turns each scene into a unique little {{cinematic}} event. There is hardly filler here, no scenes to <b>drag</b> <b>out</b> the running time or to fill some gaps in between other climaxes. Every scene matters and every scene {{is made to}} look like it matters. The director uses all means to his disposal to keep the viewer engaged and interested {{in the life of the}} main protagonist, Nemo Nobody." [...] Fred Topel, writing for Screen Junkies, praised the film's artistry, saying [...] "All of Nemo's lives are painful. No matter what he chooses, he experiences heartbreak, death of loved ones, his own death, and clinical depression. My future seems brighter, but the film makes the strong point that every experience is worthwhile. The goal isn't to choose the easiest path. It's to live." [...] Chris Holt from Starburst magazine wrote that [...] "Mr. Nobody is a film that is remarkable by its very existence and that in itself is something to be happy about. You may love it you may hate it, but you can bet that you will never forget it." [...] Exclaim!s Robert Bell called the film [...] "a powerful movie about what it means to be alive." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{writing the}} scene with Meredith and Shepherd fighting, Rater {{explained}} that she was intending to show how they matured, adding: [...] "This is a real grown-up argument. Meredith isn't running away, getting all dark and going to Cristina for help getting out of her marriage. She's staying and fighting." [...] While writing the episode, writers intended {{the theme of the}} episode to be [...] "exposure", but after the episode was filmed, realized it was [...] "ambition". Rater commented on this: [...] "Derek wants to be Chief; Meredith wants to do a procedure that she knows she isn’t ready for; Cristina wants Teddy to stay." [...] In the episode, Oh's character asked her fellow residents if they would choose love or surgery, if need be, with Stevens choosing love and Yang and Meredith choosing surgery. The Grey Anatomy staff offered the insight: [...] "When we were first discussing this story we had a knock down <b>drag</b> <b>out</b> fight in the writers' room – if you had to choose your love or your art, which would you choose? And some of us came down on the Cristina side, and some of us came down on the Izzie side – that in the end love is all that matters." [...] At the conclusion of the episode, Karev ended his marriage to Stevens. Rater expressed that the writers decided to have the fictional couple break-up, because Stevens wasn't sick anymore, and Karev would not have left her when she was.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} met with mixed {{critical}} responses. Ahsan Haque of IGN praised {{the second half of}} the episode but felt that the Kathy Ireland plot was too long. In his review, he commented [...] "It's definitely meant for people who are open-minded to this kind of humor, and can make sure they treat the subject matter purely as comedy and not any manner of social commentary or prejudice. Take away the slow start, and this episode managed to really deliver some memorable shocking comedy." [...] TV Guide critic Alex Rocha praised the show's League of Justice opening sequence and the Kathy Ireland plot but reacted negatively to {{the second half of the}} episode, stating that he [...] "dozed off" [...] during the last fifteen minutes. TV Guide also listed the episode on the [...] "TV hot list" [...] of October 4. The Toronto Star noted the episode was [...] "worth watching". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a negative review, giving it a C— grade and concluding that, [...] "Overall, the episode was just an excuse to <b>drag</b> <b>out</b> a bunch of tired Jewish jokes and also have Peter briefly descend into anti-Semitism". Though he mostly disliked the episode, VanDerWerff praised Stewie's part in the episode, as well as the Shakespeare cutaway gag and a cutaway that featured Peter getting into fight with a cat. Jewish Journal critic Adam Willis commented [...] "My hope is that the series will roast the familiar Jewish themes introduced in “Family Goy,” rather than continuing on the Jews-as-targets route. The show has regularly featured some inspiring Jewish gags– both in good taste and bad. And while Hebrew community in-jokes would be better received by Jewish viewers, the likely reality is the Holocaust humor will continue to dominate." ...|$|E

2500|$|A week later, after {{consultation}} with the SFO, the Attorney General met with Blair to argue against dropping the case. It was Blair's opinion that [...] "Any proposal that the investigation be resolved by parties pleading guilty to certain charges {{would be unlikely to}} reduce the offence caused to the Saudi Royal Family, even if the deal were accepted, and the process would still <b>drag</b> <b>out</b> for a considerable period".|$|E

2500|$|During this period, {{the main}} Chinese {{objective}} was to <b>drag</b> <b>out</b> the war {{for as long as}} possible, thereby exhausting Japanese resources while building up Chinese military capacity. American general Joseph Stilwell called this strategy [...] "winning by outlasting". The NRA adopted the concept of [...] "magnetic warfare" [...] to attract advancing Japanese troops to definite points where they were subjected to ambush, flanking attacks, and encirclements in major engagements. The most prominent example of this tactic was the successful defense of Changsha in 1939 (and again in 1941), in which heavy casualties were inflicted on the IJA.|$|E
2500|$|The {{lead singer}} is the kaner, {{and the second}} singer is the diskaner. [...] The kaner sings a phrase, and the diskaner sings the last few lines with the kaner, then repeats it alone until the same last few lines, when the kaner again joins in. [...] The phrase's {{repetition}} is changed slightly in each execution. [...] Kan ha diskan can be songs about any subject, but must meet {{one of a number}} of a meters used in folk dances, mostly line or round. [...] Vocables, or nonsense syllables (typically tra la la la leh no), are sometimes used to <b>drag</b> <b>out</b> lines. Usually a kan ha diskan lasts from 5 to 20 minutes.|$|E
2500|$|After the game, Favre {{reflected}} on his {{long road to}} becoming a Super Bowl champion, which included {{the death of his}} friend Mark Harvy in a car accident during the season. [...] "Through everything I really believed I'd be here today. Right here in this stairwell, talking about being world champions. My best friend's gone forever. Trouble never seems to be far away, and the future won't be all rosy, but they can't take this away from me. Thirty years from now, the kids will be getting ready for Super Bowl LXI, and NFL Films will <b>drag</b> <b>out</b> Steve Sabol — he'll be around 102 then — and he'll talk about how Brett Favre fought through such adversity. And there will be other players and coaches. But I know this: We etched our place in history today." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jefferson held four {{confidential}} {{talks with}} French consul Joseph Létombe {{in the spring}} of 1797 where he attacked Adams, predicting that his rival would serve only one term. He also encouraged France to invade England, and advised Létombe to stall any American envoys sent to Paris by instructing him to [...] "listen to them and then <b>drag</b> <b>out</b> the negotiations at length and mollify them by the urbanity of the proceedings." [...] This toughened the tone that the French government adopted toward the Adams administration. After Adams' initial peace envoys were rebuffed, Jefferson and his supporters lobbied for the release of papers related to the incident, called the XYZ Affair after the letters used to disguise the identities of the French officials involved. However, the tactic backfired when it was revealed that French officials had demanded bribes, rallying public support against France. The U.S. began an undeclared naval war with France known as the Quasi-War.|$|E
2500|$|Dana {{managed to}} wash off the filth {{from the river}} before the {{dizziness}} sets in once again. This time, she is whisked back to a bedroom where a red-haired boy has set his bedroom drapes aflame. The boy {{turns out to be}} Rufus, now a few years older. Dana quickly puts out the fire and speaks to Rufus, who, unafraid, confesses he set fire to the drapes to get back at his father for beating him after he stole a dollar. During their ensuing conversation, Rufus's casual use of the word [...] "nigger" [...] to refer to Dana, who is black, initially upsets Dana, but then leads her to figure out that she has been transported back in time as well as space, specifically to Maryland, circa 1815. Following Rufus's advice, Dana seeks refuge at home of Alice Greenwood and her mother, free blacks who live {{on the edge of the}} plantation. Dana realizes that both Rufus and Alice are her ancestors, and will one day have children. At the Greenwoods', she witnesses a group of young white men smash down the door, <b>drag</b> <b>out</b> Alice’s father, who is a slave, and whip him brutally for being there without papers. One of the men punches Alice's mother when she refuses his advances. The men leave, Dana comes out of hiding, and helps Alice’s mother, only to be confronted by one of the white men, who hits her and attempts to rape her. Fearing for her life, Dana becomes dizzy and returns to 1976. Though hours have passed for her, Kevin assures her that she has only been gone for a few minutes. The next day, Kevin and Dana prepare for the possibility that she may travel back in time again by packing her a survival bag and by doing some research on black history from the books in their home library.|$|E
