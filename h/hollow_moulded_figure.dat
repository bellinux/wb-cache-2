50|$|When the Duncan's {{brand name}} was {{dispensed}} with by Rowntree's and manufacturing moved from Beaverhall Road {{in the late}} 1970s, the manufacturing process changed from being hand made to being <b>hollow</b> <b>moulded</b> by machine. An {{attempt was made to}} recreate the original surface appearance but with limited success, and it now has no function other than decoration.|$|R
50|$|During {{planning}} {{and even in}} construction it was still uncertain when the new buildings would be constructed and how they would look. Because the full spatial limits would still be lacking for an unknown time, the park is designed as a tree body not as a <b>hollow</b> <b>mould.</b> The engagement of landscape architecture, architecture, and art was the intention and aim of the project.|$|R
40|$|The method {{concerns}} {{production of}} three-dimensional components, {{and consists of}} two process steps. At the first step a <b>hollow</b> <b>mould</b> is by a free-forming process, while at the second step this mould - which shapes the function surface of the finished component - {{is filled with the}} component material in liquid or powder form. USE - Used in various industries. ADVANTAGE - Large components with high surface accuracy are produced simply...|$|R

50|$|The {{building}} is two storied with an attic and slate roof. Plain stone chimney of untypical form. The timber framed construction has close studding {{to the ground}} floor, and square timber-framing. The upper storey of the porch has bold diamond framing {{which is similar to}} Glas Hirfryn and Rhydycarw in Trefeglwys. The porch is off-centre because the hall is twice as wide as the parlour. The porch has depressed ogee inner and outer doorheads. There are turned balusters set into the sides of the porch and internal side seats. The older part of the house is jettied on three sides with ovolo and <b>hollow</b> <b>moulded</b> bressumers, and supported by brackets.|$|R
50|$|During {{its early}} period, Court Farm had a high, open-trussed roof, {{visible from the}} floor of the main hall and of an {{elaborate}} design, with double roll and <b>hollow</b> <b>moulding.</b> Bredwardine Court and Porthaml Mansion, two other ancestral homes of the Vaughans, have similar surviving roofs. However, part of the original roof of Court Farm was lowered and flattened during alterations made during the 19th century, and the carved ornamental detail of the original trussed roof was lost. In addition, the original stone tiles, which needed a more steeply pitching roof, were replaced with Caernarvon slates (as reported in Mr. Driver’s survey), and the roof valleys were finished off with lead flashing.|$|R
50|$|The cat was {{manufactured}} by the lost wax method, where a wax model {{is covered with}} clay and fired in a kiln until the wax flows out, and the <b>hollow</b> <b>mould</b> is refilled with molten metal. In this case the metal was 85% copper, 13% tin, 2% arsenic with a 0.2% trace of lead. The remains of the pins that held the wax core can still be seen using X-rays. The original metalworkers {{would have been able}} to create a range of colours on a bronze casting and the stripes on the tail are due to metal of a differing composition. It is also considered likely that the eyes contained stone or glass decorations.|$|R
5000|$|The third {{style was}} the best known. Introduced in 1956 and used until 1962, {{it was one of}} the Western Region designs to {{recreate}} a sense of regional identity. The shape was a curved rectangle, without the cutouts to the upper corners. It was painted overall, cream with brown letters. In the upper centre a disc protruding above the main headboard carried a <b>moulded</b> <b>figure</b> of a red dragon.|$|R
60|$|Violet {{said nothing}} {{for half a}} minute, during which she lay resting on one elbow, looking down upon the cool, green {{flashing}} of the water a hundred feet below, and again Nasmyth felt a little thrill run through him. She was so very dainty in speech and thought and person, {{a woman of the}} world he had once belonged to, and which it now seemed he might enter again. Her delicately chiselled, half-averted face matched the slight but finely <b>moulded</b> <b>figure</b> about which the thin white draperies clung. She turned and looked at him.|$|R
6000|$|On the day {{of which}} we write, Young and Adams found the square {{above-mentioned}} in possession of the infantry, under command of their self-elected captain, Otaheitan Sally, who was now, according to John Adams, [...] "no longer a chicken." [...] Being in her eleventh year, and, like her country-women generally at that age, far advanced towards big girlhood, she presented a tall, slight, graceful, and beautifully <b>moulded</b> <b>figure,</b> with a sweet sprightly face, and a smile that was ever disclosing her fine white teeth. Her profusion of black hair was gathered into a knot which hung low {{on the back of}} her pretty round head. She was crowned with a wreath of wild-flowers, made and presented by her troops. It is needless to say that every one of these, big and little, was passionately attached to Sally.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Metalcasting {{involves}} {{having a}} molten metal poured in a <b>hollow</b> <b>mould</b> to produce metal objects. These moulds are generally made {{of sand and}} are chemically bonded, clay-bonded, or even unbounded. There are many binder systems used. Binders based on furfuryl resins constitute currently the highest fraction in the binders no-bake group. Moulding sand, after knocking out the cast, is par-tially reclaimed, and the remaining part, known as waste foundry sand is used or stored outside the foundry. In this case, the environment hazardous organic compounds and metals can be leached from the moulding sand, thus causing pollution of water and soil. Also during the casting moulds with molten metal, they emit pyrolysis gases containing many different compounds, often dangerous from the BTEX and PAH group, which has adverse impacts {{on the environment and}} workers. The article presents the results of research on the impact of the regenerate addition to the moulding sand matrix on emitted gases and the degree of threat to the environment due to leaching of hazardous components. Therefore, for the total assessment of the moulding sands harmfulness, it is necessary to perform inves-tigations concerning the dangerous substances elu-tion into the environment during their management and storage, as well as investigations concerning emissions of hazardous substances (especially from the BTEX and PAHs group) during moulds pouring, cooling, and casting knocking out. Both kinds of investigations indicated that reclaimed sand additions to moulding sands have significantly negative influ-ence on the environment and working conditions...|$|R

Simple geometries such as a cubical box, a sphere, a cylinder and a 'bottle-neck' geometry have been investigated experimentally and the results have been compared with computed light distributions obtained using the 'radiosity method'. A high reflection coefficient of the mould and the best uniform direct irradiance possible {{on the inside of the}} mould were found to be important determinants for achieving a uniform light distributio...|$|R
60|$|He saw her sudden uncertainty, which was, however, not {{tinged with}} embarrassment, and {{feeling that he}} had gone far enough in the {{meanwhile}} {{he went out to}} put up his team. When he came back there was a cloth on the table, and Sally was busy about the stove. He sat down and watched her attentively. In some respects, he thought, she compared favourably with Agatha. She had a nicely <b>moulded</b> <b>figure,</b> and a curious lithe gracefulness of carriage which was suggestive of a strong vitality, while Agatha's bearing was usually characterised by a certain rather frigid repose. This and the latter's general manner had a somewhat inciting effect on him when he was in her presence, but he now and then remembered it afterwards with resentment. Then Sally's face was at least as comely in a different way, and there was no reserve in it. She was what he thought of as human, frankly flesh and blood. Her quick smile was, as a rule, provocative, and never chilled one as Agatha's quiet glances sometimes did.|$|R
60|$|Half amused {{and half}} annoyed, Hemmingway seated {{himself on the}} little {{platform}} beside the open door, and began a conscientious description of the progress of Sacramento, its new buildings, hotels, and theatres, as it had struck him on his last visit. For a while he was somewhat entertained by the girl's vivacity and eager questioning, but presently it began to pall. He continued, however, with a grim sense of duty, and partly {{as a reason for}} watching her in her household duties. Certainly she was graceful! Her tall, lithe, but beautifully <b>moulded</b> <b>figure,</b> even in its characteristic southwestern indolence, fell into poses as picturesque as they were unconscious. She lifted the big molasses-can from its shelf on the rafters with the attitude of a Greek water-bearer. She upheaved the heavy flour-sack to the same secure shelf with the upraised palms of an Egyptian caryatid. Suddenly she interrupted Hemmingway's perfunctory talk with a hearty laugh. He started, looked up from his seat on the platform, and saw that she was standing over him and regarding him with a kind of mischievous pity.|$|R

5000|$|In a {{solid cast}} mould, ceramic {{objects such as}} handles and plates are {{surrounded}} by plaster on all sides with a reservoir for slip, and are removed when the solid piece is held within. For a <b>hollow</b> cast <b>mould,</b> for objects such as vases and cups, once the plaster has absorbed most of the liquid from the outside layer of clay the remaining slip is poured off for later use. After a period for further absorption of water, the cast piece {{is removed from the}} mould once it is leather-hard, that is, firm enough to handle without losing its shape. It is then [...] "fettled" [...] (trimmed neatly) and allowed to dry out further, usually overnight or for several hours. This produces a greenware piece which is then ready to be decorated, glazed and fired in a kiln.|$|R

2500|$|Comalcalco {{was also}} an {{important}} centre of clay figurine production and commerce between 600 and 1000 CE In and around the site, archaeologists have found identical clay <b>moulds</b> and <b>figures,</b> as well as tools, pit kilns and dumping grounds, indicating standardized mass production. Figurines found on Jaina Island, approximately [...] away on the Yucatán Peninsula, use clay with the same chemical composition as those of Comalcalco. Unlike the funerary objects used on Jaina Island, the figurines of Comalcalco seemed to be meant for daily use. Certain representations appear more frequently in the ceremonial core (rulers, dwarfs, articulated figures), while others (women) are more common in residential areas.|$|R

40|$|The University of Pisa {{worked at}} Dra Abu el-Naga from 6 until 27 November 2006, {{in the new}} tomb MIDAN. 05 found in 2004, west of TT 14. The aim of the November season was to {{complete}} the excavation of the corridor “c” and to clear the funerary shaft “f” discovered during the previous season. The west end of “c”, closed by a wall partially demolished by robbers in the 19 th century, was investigated: archaeological evidence allows to understand that, in the original project, the wall was meant to close up and conceal {{the western end of}} “c”, too irregularly cut out, serving as its rear wall. A first re-use of that part was made by ancient robbers, who burnt there mummies buried elsewhere in the tomb. After the plundering by ancient robbers, in the Late Period the space was re-used for hosting there the jars with the remains of mummification. The scarcity of funerary equipment, the complete absence of wood or meaningful quantities of ash, and the narrow available room suggest to exclude the hypothesis of secondary burials. The shaft - about 4. 50 m deep – was found filled with sand, deriving from many flood events, through which modern robbers dug out their way. Four chambers, each for side, are on its bottom. Only the eastern chamber (“h”) has been completely cleared. It is a small almost squared room, whose walls were not plastered. It could belong to a later re-use phase of the tomb. Traces of a Late Period burial were still in site: a big amount of small shabti <b>moulded</b> <b>figures,</b> in clay, were found all together in the south-western corner of the chamber, amidst wooden fragments partly burnt, which probably composed once a shabti box.

We estimated the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus in wood mould and compared the coarse fraction which constitutes frass of O. eremita with the finer fraction of wood mould, and found that the nutrient richness was higher in frass. O. eremita larvae have a fermentation chamber that harbours nitrogen fixing bacteria. As the levels of absorbable nitrogen are a limiting factor in insect growth, an increase in nutrient richness is one of several possible explanations why the species richness of saproxylic beetles is higher in hollow oaks where O. eremita is present in relation to similar trees where the beetle is absen...|$|R

50|$|Students {{of bronze}} casting will usually work in direct wax, where {{the model is}} made in wax, {{possibly}} formed over a core, or with a core cast in place, if the piece is to be <b>hollow.</b> If no <b>mould</b> is made and the casting process fails, the artwork will also be lost. After the metal has cooled, the external ceramic or clay is chipped away, revealing {{an image of the}} wax form, including core pins, sprues, vents, and risers. All of these are removed with a saw and tool marks are polished away, and interior core material is removed to reduce the likelihood of interior corrosion. Incomplete voids created by gas pockets or investment inclusions are then corrected by welding and carving. Small defects where sprues and vents were attached are filed or ground down and polished.|$|R
