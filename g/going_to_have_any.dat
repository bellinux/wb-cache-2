500|$|Asked {{to assess}} his {{personal}} performance {{after the loss}} to Kansas State, Colt McCoy said, [...] "I think I've had some bad luck, I'm definitely a better quarterback, definitely more experienced—I've just had some bad luck. Things that can go the wrong way, have gone the wrong way — tipped balls and that stuff." [...] He also said there was room for improvement, [...] "Teams are blitzing us a lot more. We've handled it well for the most part, but there's so many {{things we can do}} better... If you ask every person on this offense, they'll tell you there's something individually they can do better." [...] After the loss to Oklahoma, Mack Brown said {{he did not want to}} hear about bad luck, [...] "By saying we're unlucky is just a cop-out, this game isn't about luck. [...] If you knock balls loose you should get on them. If you tip balls in the air you should catch them. We're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> excuses." [...] Brown cited the lack of big plays on defense, particularly the lack of forced turnovers, as a problem for Texas. [...] Both Brown and Greg Davis hinted that Jamaal Charles could face less playing time as a result of his problems hanging onto the ball.|$|E

5000|$|Manne was Chairman of the Editorial Board of The Monthly, a {{national}} magazine of politics, {{society and the}} arts, from February 2006 until his resignation on 18 August 2011. He wanted to focus on his writing, [...] "including a new blog to be published on The Monthly's website." [...] Manne's departure as chairman resulted in the editorial board's dissolution, with Monthly editor Ben Naparstek announcing, [...] "We're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> one <b>any</b> more.". Manne's blog, entitled Left, Right, Left, had its first post on 12 September.|$|R

"No; Ben, {{the driver}} {{on the wagon}} where I ride, {{told him not to}} do that again; but he hain't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> let me <b>have</b> <b>any</b> supper, 'cause I was so slow about my work--though I wasn't slow; I only talked to Mr. Stubbs when there wasn't anybody round his cage." ...|$|R

60|$|The aspect {{and action}} of Mordecai were so new and mysterious to Jacob--they carried such a burden of obscure threat--it {{was as if}} the patient, indulgent {{companion}} had turned into something unknown and terrific: the sunken dark eyes and hoarse accents close to him, the thin grappling fingers, shook Jacob's little frame into awe, and while Mordecai was speaking he stood trembling with a sense that the house was tumbling in and they were not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> dinner <b>any</b> more. But when the terrible speech had ended and the pinch was relaxed, the shock resolved itself into tears; Jacob lifted up his small patriarchal countenance and wept aloud. This sign of childish grief at once recalled Mordecai to his usual gentle self: {{he was not able to}} speak again at present, but with a maternal action he drew the curly head toward him and pressed it tenderly against his breast. On this Jacob, feeling the danger well-nigh over, howled at ease, beginning to imitate his own performance and improve upon it--a sort of transition from impulse into art often observable. Indeed, the next day he undertook to terrify Adelaide Rebekah in like manner, and succeeded very well.|$|R

40|$|Extract] In 1891, Fred Barkas, then thirty-seven {{years of}} age and living in Christchurch, New Zealand, wrote to his brother in England about his usual reading habits. Another result of this delay in mail {{delivery}} is that both Amy & I have got ahead of our supply of Home papers, this is a very unusual state of things [...] . We get Spectators, weekly Chronicles, Truth, &c. &c. and should we fail in our steady reading it's wonderful how our 'Papers-to-be-read' baskets get crowded - now they are empty. We don't go out much of an evening and usually read our papers {{for an hour or so}} between finishing our nightly game of cards and <b>going</b> <b>to</b> bed. Not <b>having</b> <b>any</b> papers I <b>have</b> this week again taken up 'Lorna Doone' and I think I'm enjoying it even more than I did upon my first and second readings. Amy <b>has</b> taken <b>to</b> 'Treasure Island' again - but we miss our papers as we like to keep up a nodding acquaintance with the events in the Great World. 1 More than thirty years later the same man wrote to his daughter, then also living in England...|$|R
60|$|The caravan {{followed}} at no great distance. As it went jolting through the streets, Nell peeped from the window, {{curious to see}} in what kind of place they were, and yet fearful of encountering at every turn the dreaded face of Quilp. It was a pretty large town, with an open square which they were crawling slowly across, {{and in the middle}} of which was the Town-Hall, with a clock-tower and a weather-cock. There were houses of stone, houses of red brick, houses of yellow brick, houses of lath and plaster; and houses of wood, many of them very old, with withered faces carved upon the beams, and staring down into the street. These had very little winking windows, and low-arched doors, and, in some of the narrower ways, quite overhung the pavement. The streets were very clean, very sunny, very empty, and very dull. A few idle men lounged about the two inns, and the empty market-place, and the tradesmen's doors, and some old people were dozing in chairs outside an alms-house wall; but scarcely any passengers who seemed bent on <b>going</b> anywhere, or <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> object in view, went by; and if perchance some straggler did, his footsteps echoed on the hot bright pavement for minutes afterwards. Nothing seemed <b>to</b> be <b>going</b> on but the clocks, and they had such drowzy faces, such heavy lazy hands, and such cracked voices that they surely must have been too slow. The very dogs were all asleep, and the flies, drunk with moist sugar in the grocer's shop, forgot their wings and briskness, and baked to death in dusty corners of the window.|$|R

It's like this: I don't mind dealing {{with my men}} if they think they've got any grievances--though Lord knows what's come over workmen, nowadays--don't {{appreciate}} a good job. But still, if they come to me honestly, as man to man, I'll talk things over with them. But I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> outsider, any of these walking delegates, or whatever fancy names they call themselves now--bunch of rich grafters, living on the ignorant workmen!

25|$|In other words, don't {{spend the}} money unless you're sure you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the legal {{environment}} to go forward.

5000|$|The main {{character}} team are The Mates. While there are parallels with The Beatles and each {{character is a}} pastiche of a superhero, Tischman insisted the concept was much broader than that: [...] "The persona of the Mates is an iconic one for both superhero teams and rock bands. You are always <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the really cute one. You are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the quiet one.

40|$|In late 2006, {{shortly before}} the end of his tenure as {{secretary}} of defense, Donald Rumsfeld made the following remark regarding the ongoing U.

They’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> provide security for it. And they’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do it sooner rather than later. ” This remark is striking for its ahistorical crassness and demonstrated a striking amount of chutzpah even by Secretary Rumsfeld’s standards. However, it also raises some interesting questions about sovereignty and responsibility in foreign affairs...|$|R
