500|$|In {{addition}} to the dams on the Rogue main stem, {{at one time or}} another [...] "several hundred dams were built on tributaries within the range of salmon migration", most of which supplied water for mining or irrigation. Before 1920, many of these dams made no provision for fish passage; public pressure as well as efforts by turn-of-the-century cannery owner R.D. Hume led to the installation of fish ladders on the most destructive dams. As of 2005, there were about 80 non-hydroelectric dams, mostly small <b>irrigation</b> <b>structures,</b> in the Rogue basin. In {{addition to}} Lost Creek Lake on the main stem, large reservoirs in the basin include Applegate Lake, Emigrant Lake, and Fish Lake.|$|E
2500|$|Archaeological {{excavations}} at {{many sites}} in Tamil Nadu including Arikamedu, Kodumanal, Kaveripumpattinam and Alagankulam, [...] have yielded a [...] variety of artifacts {{belonging to the}} Sangam era, such as various types of pottery and other items including [...] black and red ware, rouletted ware, [...] Russet coated ware, brick walls, ring wells, pits, industrial items, [...] {{and the remains of}} seeds and shells. Many of the pottery sherds contain Tamil-Brahmic inscriptions on them, which have provided additional evidence for the archaeologist to date them. Archaeologists agree that activities best illustrated in these material records are trade, hunting, agriculture and crafts. These excavations have provided evidence for the existence of the major economic activities mentioned in Sangam literature. Remnants of <b>irrigation</b> <b>structures</b> like reservoirs and ring wells and charred remains of seeds attest to the cultivation of different varieties of crops and knowledge of various agricultural techniques. Spinning whorls, cotton seeds, remains of a woven cotton cloth and dyeing vats provide evidence for the activities of the textile industry. Metallurgy has been supported by the discovery of an ancient blast furnace, along with its base and wall, anvil, slags and crucibles. The remains have indicated that, in addition to iron, the blacksmith may have worked with steel, lead, copper and bronze. The Kodumanal excavation recovered several jewellery items and semi precious stones at different stages of manufacture, suggesting that they were locally manufactured. Remains of import and export articles recovered from Arikamedu indicate the important role it played as an Indo-Roman trading station. Building construction, pearl fishery and painting are other activities that have been supported by findings from these excavations.|$|E

Again the project would be bogged down due to financial problems; the original barrages were initially completed in 1862, and greatly improved in the 1880s under British rule. A new barrage structure was built slightly downstream in 1939. The name of the city, is a reference to the structure and the river crossing it nonetheless provided.|$|R

Where this is practiced, drainage must also usually be employed, to carry away the excess water.|$|R
50|$|Whereas {{the formal}} {{agreements}} between Kenya and the World Bank were signed in June 1977 the implementation was delayed {{due to a}} number of factors. Firstly Kenya and the consultants needed about 10 months before they could agree on a new consultancy contract. The outcome of these negotiations was that the consultancy cost almost doubled. Secondly, during the preparation of the final designs, major modifications were made by the consultants on both the intake and the <b>irrigation</b> <b>structure.</b> These changes caused not only new delays, but also, for instance, an increase of concrete structures in the main canal with 138%, stone pitching with 338% and digging with 255%. In 1979 the World Bank concluded that both the original design of Ilaco and MacDonald’s design were based on sound engineering principles. Rejection of the new design would have resulted in further delays and fearing further delays the World Bank accepted the new design. According to the World Bank, however, design changes would result in a cost increase of 65% in real terms. At that time the economic rate of return of the project was at best 4%. Also one of the financiers (CDC) withdrew {{and as a result of}} this the part to be financed by Kenya, depending on the project formulation, increased to between 50 and 65% in real terms of the total project cost.|$|R

50|$|The {{success of}} Tibbets' orange {{inspired}} irrigation projects which converted more desert to orange groves. The size, scale, and ingenuity of the <b>irrigation</b> <b>structures</b> in Riverside and surrounding area are {{considered one of}} the agricultural marvels of the age. By 1893 Riverside was the wealthiest city per capita in the United States. Money poured into California. Tibbets' orange led to an estimated $100 million of direct and indirect investment in citrus industry over the next 25 years. But Eliza Tibbets' orange did not merely feed the wealth and growth of existing towns; new cities and towns popped up whose birth, existence, and future depended upon the condition of the orange market. In 1886 alone new citrus towns were laid out in Rialto, Fontana, Bloomington, Redlands, Terracina, Mound City (Loma Linda), Guasti and South Riverside, (Corona). Irrigated communities like Etiwanda, Redlands, Ontario and many others were launched.|$|E

In 1981, the colony of Socorro springsnails was found to occupy not only the source, but also the outflow tributary about 2.5 m (8 ft) long to an irrigation ditch. No snails were found in the irrigation flow itself however. In 1991, the total population of the Socorro springsnail in the spring outflow was estimated at 5,000 individuals.|$|E

40|$|Tractors {{provide the}} primary source of power for most farming operations. Their {{mobility}} makes them adaptable to different production practices. However, they have two major disadvantages: soil compaction resulting from multiple passes of heavy power units, and inefficiency in transmitting power through tractive means. Cable farming systems were developed to overcome those disadvantages. Most, however, are used only for tillage operations, and employ a limited number of implements. A cable drawn farming system (CDFS) was developed which utilizes a modified linear move <b>irrigation</b> <b>structure</b> as its main frame. The system consists of a mobile truss, carriage, endless cable and controller. A multipurpose carriage system was designed for the CDFS. Finite element analysis was used to determine carrier frame and attachment structural requirements. An implement carrier of the carriage system was designed to be drawn by an endless cable, and to accommodate most three-point hitch implements, including PTO driven implements. An automatic cable gripping device was developed to connect the carriage to the cable. An electrical system was developed to provide power to the carrier through an electric trolley. A rail was designed to guide the carrier and support the electric lines. Potential harvesting scenarios were examined to identify material handling solutions. Evaluation suggested material handling requirements of vegetables could be best met with a conveyor system, while other crops might utilize trailers. A programmable logical controller (PLC) was selected and a control sequence is provided to accommodate the field operations. This research defined design parameters for a CDFS compatible with linear move irrigation system operations. Analytical results provide support for the concept of multipurpose use of a linear move irrigation system...|$|R
