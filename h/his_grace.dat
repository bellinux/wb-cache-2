Castiel calls Dean and tells him {{that while he was}} held captive by Malachi he learned that the angel Ezekiel is dead and so the angel possessing Sam must be an impostor.|$|E
5|$|My lords, the law {{of nature}} moves me to sorrow for my sister; the burden that is fallen upon me makes me amazed, and yet, {{considering}} I am God's creature, ordained to obey His appointment, I will thereto yield, desiring {{from the bottom of}} my heart that I may have assistance of <b>His</b> <b>grace</b> to be the minister of His heavenly will in this office now committed to me. And as I am but one body naturally considered, though by His permission a body politic to govern, so shall I desire you all... to be assistant to me, that I with my ruling and you with your service may make a good account to Almighty God and leave some comfort to our posterity on earth. I mean to direct all my actions by good advice and counsel.|$|E

5|$|Seeking to help Dean find a {{cure for}} the Mark of Cain, Castiel breaks Metatron out of Heaven and removes <b>his</b> <b>Grace</b> so that the Winchesters can {{interrogate}} him. Although he fails to provide any new information, Metatron is able to lead Castiel to the library where he hid the remaining fragments of Castiel's Grace. With his powers restored, Castiel helps Claire find her long-lost mother, but although Amelia sacrifices herself to save Claire, Claire accepts that the Winchesters and Castiel meant well, even speculating that she will become a Hunter herself. When Rowena – Crowley's long-lost mother – casts a spell to remove the Mark, she also casts a spell that causes Castiel to attack Crowley while she escapes, leaving Castiel driven by a greater rage to the point that he kills two angels until Rowena is forced to cure him.|$|E

25|$|For most aspirants {{the path}} {{is one of}} true devotion to the perfect spiritual master (Sadguru) who initiates them.

They will acquire non-dualistic realization that their Master is a realized soul (Brahmajnani-ब्रह्मज्ञानी) and experience bliss due to intense love for him {{over the course of}} time, when they are enabled to participate in his Leela (love play-लिला) for helping others.|$|E

25|$|In August 1614 at age twenty-one, Villiers {{caught the}} eye of James I at a hunt in Apethorpe. Opponents of the king's {{favourite}} Robert Carr saw an opportunity to usurp the Earl of Somerset and began promoting Villiers. Money was raised to purchase Villiers a new wardrobe, and intense lobbying secured his appointment as Royal Cupbearer, a position that allowed him to make conversation with the king. Villiers began to appear as a dancer in masques from 1615, in which he could exhibit <b>his</b> <b>grace</b> of movement and beauty of body, a recognised avenue to royal favour since the time of Elizabeth I.|$|E
25|$|Harold Macmillan link: On 26 November 1950 <b>His</b> <b>Grace</b> The 10th Duke of Devonshire {{had a heart}} attack. Adams tended him and was by {{his side}} when he died, 13 days {{after the death of}} Morrell. The coroner should have been notified, since the Duke had not seen a doctor in the 14 days before his death. Because of a {{loophole}} in the law, Adams, though present at death, could sign the death certificate to state that the Duke died naturally. The Duke's sister was married to Harold Macmillan, and some have argued that Macmillan, who became Prime Minister during preparations for the trial, might not have wanted this case to be investigated further: The Attorney-General, Manningham-Buller, attended Cabinet meetings regularly.|$|E
25|$|The {{first and}} chief article is this: Jesus Christ, our God and Lord, died for our sins and was raised again for our {{justification}} (Romans 3:24–25). He alone is the Lamb of God who takes away {{the sins of}} the world (John 1:29), and God has laid on Him the iniquity of us all (Isaiah 53:6). All have sinned and are justified freely, without their own works and merits, by <b>His</b> <b>grace,</b> through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, in His blood (Romans 3:23–25). This is necessary to believe. This cannot be otherwise acquired or grasped by any work, law or merit. Therefore, it is clear and certain that this faith alone justifies us... Nothing of this article can be yielded or surrendered, even though heaven and earth and everything else falls (Mark 13:31).|$|E
