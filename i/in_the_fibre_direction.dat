In hollow fibres dialyzers blood flows <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fibres</b> {{channel and}} plasma filtrates through their {{permeable}} wall {{to feed the}} flow of the permeate (dialyzate), which takes place among <b>the</b> <b>fibres</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opposite <b>direction.</b> We investigate this fluid dynamical problem exploiting the existence of two separate scales: <b>the</b> one <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fibres</b> <b>direction</b> (∼ 20 cm), and the one along <b>the</b> <b>fibre</b> radius (∼ 0. 1 mm). We formulate a mathematical model based on a two-scale approach providing a full description of the flows of the blood, of the dialyzate and the of the plasma through the membrane, {{as well as of the}} progressive increase of the hematocrit. The problem is characterized by various rather unusual features like the slip condition of blood on the membrane and the feedback loop of boundary data for the hematocrit. Blood rheology is assumed to be of shear-thinning type, with hematocrit dependent coefficients. Under some simplifications explicit solutions are found. We show how the necessity of respecting several constraints and of reaching some specific targets influences the selection of the geometrical and physical parameters of the system.

Here σ∞, 0 is an Lloc 1 current on P(R ⊕ V) and [X] is the current of integration over the zero section of V.

Models of cellular tension development have been proposed which include these effects, and have in recent years been embedded <b>in</b> models of <b>the</b> nonlinear passive mechanical response of tissue, in order to simulate muscular contraction, especially in cardiac tissue. However, {{it has been observed}} that such models are no longer purely elastic. Instead they are visco-elastic, but only <b>in</b> <b>the</b> muscle <b>fibre</b> <b>direction.</b> These models can be considered to be partially degenerate visco-elastic. The mathematical properties of such systems are unclear, and in fact preliminary observations [Pathmanathan et al., QJMAM, 2010] raised questions about their well-posedness. This paper lays a mathematical foundation for the use of partially degenerate visco-elastic models in muscular modelling. We define an abstract linear problem, for which we prove an existence theorem. This theorem allows jumps at initial time of particular spatial derivatives of the solution; we show that such jumps are always possible in general, but derive constraints on the initial condition that guarantee continuous solutions. Overall, the linear partially degenerate visco-elastic case is fully characterised, and the implication of these results for nonlinear muscular models (cardiac electro-mechanical models in particular) is discussed. 1.
