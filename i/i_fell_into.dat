I noticed beside me a hole by which I left without knowing how, and <b>I</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> a mud puddle. I then could {{contemplate}} the flames which consumed the plane. It was not about excess weight. It's a simple mechanical failure.|$|E
25|$|A shrine {{adjacent}} to the southern sanctuary contains several famous icons, including one of the Virgin Mary dating to the 14th century. The Virgin Mary is seated on a tree that grows {{from the back of}} Jesse (Isaiah 11:1-10). She is surrounded by four major and twelve minor prophets, above whom are two angels. According to tradition, whenever Pope Matthew <b>I</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> temptation, he would stand before this icon and address it in supplication. The Virgin Mary would appear before him to comfort his soul. It is also said that Saint Ruweiss prayed before this icon.|$|E
25|$|Well, it's {{not really}} a choice at all. It's just, you know, I started playing very young and from early on, the people I was {{listening}} to had some element of finger style. Probably the first guitarist I was emulating was Scotty Moore, when I was maybe 6 or 7. And he played with a pick, but he also used fingers. And {{a lot of the}} session players, like Chet Atkins, they played with fingers or a pick. Then I listened to a certain amount of light classical guitar playing. And of course later on, when the first wave of rock 'n' roll kind of fell away, folk music was very popular and very influential in my style. So it was really less of a choice than what <b>I</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into.</b> I use a pick occasionally. I certainly use it more in the studio when {{you want to get a}} certain tone. But it's just the way I came up. I wasn't taught. I just sort of figured things out on my own terms. I guess that was one of the ways that I became comfortable and it just kind of set in.|$|E

500|$|During the fight, Mann {{was able}} to land several {{successful}} punches, before Hioki took Mann down with a trip, where he {{was able to}} land knees and execute a D'arce choke. After scrambling to avoid an armbar attempt, Mann fell to a triangle choke, tapping out at 3:09 of the first round. After the fight, Mann stated [...] "I started off well, standing up, but <b>I</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> his game. Fell into his trap. The punches were only small punches, but it was the triangle that was slowly coming on, so in the end, I tapped." ...|$|E
500|$|..... {{we turned}} off the dusty French road, through a gateway and into a meadow beside the {{buildings}} of a farm. I saw {{with one of the}} nastiest feelings I have ever had in my life two heavy machine guns inside the meadow ... pointing at the head of our column. The guns began to spit fire ... for a few seconds the cries and shrieks of our stricken men drowned the crackling of the guns. Men fell like grass before a scythe ... I felt a searing pain and pitched forward ... my scream of pain mingled with the cries of my mates, but even before <b>I</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> the heap of dying men, the thought stabbed my brain 'If I ever get out of here, the swine that did this will pay for it.' ...|$|E
2500|$|During World War II, Orwell {{believed}} that British democracy as it existed before 1939 would {{not survive the}} war. The question being [...] "Would it end via Fascist coup d'Ã©tat from above or via Socialist revolution from below"?

60|$|I {{know very}} well, that this scheme hath been much talked of {{for some time}} past, {{and is in the}} {{thoughts}} of many patriots, neither was it properly mine, although <b>I</b> <b>fell</b> readily <b>into</b> it, when it was first communicated to me.|$|R

2500|$|In summer 1827 {{the family}} visited Germany where in Weimar young Aleksey met Goethe. The great man greeted the boy very warmly {{and left him}} a {{fragment}} of a mammoth tusk with his own drawing (depicting a frigate) on it, for a present. Aleksey, having been awe-stricken, remembered little: [...] "Only his magnificent features {{and the way he}} took me upon his lap," [...] according to his autobiography. The family spent the next ten years in continuous travel, both in Russia and abroad. An 1831 trip to Italy especially impressed the 13-year-old. [...] "Back in Russia <b>I</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> a deep nostalgic depression, longing for Italy which felt like a real motherland; desperately mourning the loss, I cried at night when my dreams carried me off to this Paradise lost," [...] he wrote in his autobiography decades later. In Italy the family met Karl Bryullov. On May 10, 1831, Aleksey wrote in his diary: [...] "Bryullov dined with us and left a sketch in my album." [...] The painter promised Perovsky to make portraits of all three of them once he was back in Russia, but five years later he had finished only one, that of his nephew.|$|E
2500|$|... "After a night {{spent in}} fever and sleeplessness, I {{forced myself to}} take a long tramp the next day through the hilly country, which was covered with pine woods. It all looked dreary and desolate, and I could not think what I should do there. Returning in the afternoon, I {{stretched}} myself, dead tired, on a hard couch, awaiting the long-desired hour of sleep. It did not come; but <b>I</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> a kind of somnolent state, in which I suddenly felt as though I were sinking in swiftly flowing water. The rushing sound formed itself in my brain into a musical sound, the chord of E flat; major, which continually re-echoed in broken forms; these broken chords seemed to be melodic passages of increasing motion, yet the pure triad of E flat; major never changed, but seemed by its continuance to impart infinite significance to the element in which I was sinking. I awoke in sudden terror from my doze, feeling as though the waves were rushing high above my head. I at once recognised that the orchestral overture to the Rheingold, which must long have lain latent within me, though it had been unable to find definite form, had at last been revealed to me."

2500|$|In January 2009, {{after the}} release of The Trials of Ted Haggard, Haggard and wife Gayle {{appeared}} on The Oprah Winfrey Show, Larry King Live, Good Morning America, and other national media programs to offer a public apology and confession for the issues that spurred his resignation. The couple also appeared on the syndicated television show Divorce Court in April 2009. On the program, Ted says he wanted his wife to divorce him after the scandal, saying that he thought he had become so [...] "toxic" [...] that divorce was best for Gayle and their children. On March 11, 2009, Haggard attended a performance in New York of This Beautiful City, a play about him and the Colorado Springs evangelical community. In August 2009, Haggard told Charisma magazine: [...] "I do not believe my childhood experience is an excuse. <b>I</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> sin and failed to extract myself. I am responsible, and I have repented." [...] He also extols the benefits of qualified counselors: [...] "I highly recommend qualified Christian counseling... for anyone losing their fight with any kind of compulsive thoughts or behaviors. ... I believe our generation of believers {{is going to have to}} accept that it's not always lack of faith if we need counseling for assistance with integrity. If I had gone to counseling, I probably could have completely avoided my crisis." ...|$|E

25|$|It was thrilling {{to work on}} {{this film}} and when you see my {{extraordinary}} interpretation you realise why <b>I</b> immediately <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> the arms of Jenny Craig, and minor cosmetic surgery.

"Bless you, no! <b>I</b> only <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> Joe's arms, {{and when}} I came to, there the dear fellow was, crying over {{me like a}} baby, while old Sally danced round us like a bedlamite, {{in spite of her}} rheumatics, shouting: 'Hosanna!

5000|$|So <b>I</b> <b>fell</b> ever deeper <b>into</b> temptation, {{and finally}} this {{resulted}} in my marriage to George Landmann in the year 1823. With that, we were banished from the Community. (Scheuner, 1873) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What should hurt me? Oh dear, oh dear! <b>I</b> never <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> a river before. My darling Flo, don't be unhappy. It's {{such good}} fun.

60|$|There was a {{discordant}} hum {{of human}} voices! There {{was a loud}} blast as of many trumpets! There was a harsh grating as of a thousand thunders! The fiery walls rushed back!

60|$|I began life unluckily {{by being}} the wag and bright fellow at school; and I had the farther misfortune of {{becoming}} the great genius of my native village. My father was a country attorney, and intended that I should succeed him in business; but I had too much genius to study, and he was too fond of my genius to force it into the traces. So <b>I</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> bad company and took to bad habits. Do not mistake me. I mean that <b>I</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> the company of village literati and village blues, and took to writing village poetry.|$|E
60|$|FAITH. I {{escaped the}} Slough that <b>I</b> {{perceived}} you <b>fell</b> <b>into,</b> {{and got up}} to the gate without that danger; only I met with one whose name was Wanton, who had like to have done me a mischief.|$|R
60|$|After taking matÃ© I {{left them}} to settle their affairs, not doubting which {{would come out}} best from a trial of skill.

60|$|As I like to {{make new}} acquaintances, {{considering}} every man a volume of human nature, <b>I</b> soon <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> conversation with the stranger, who, I was pleased to find, {{was by no means}} difficult of access. After I had dined, I joined him at the window, and we became so sociable that I proposed a bottle of wine together; to which he most cheerfully assented.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> a {{pleasant}} reverie. The backwoods of the Great Nor'-west vanished from my mental view, and, with eyes half closed, I indulged in memories {{of home and}} all its sweet associations.|$|E
6000|$|... "To undo it, if I can," [...] {{he replied}} quickly,--"a part of it, at any rate. <b>I</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> a trap--Selingman and I. I've a way out, if there's time. I want your uncle." ...|$|E
