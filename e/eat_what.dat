5|$|Mourning doves eat almost {{exclusively}} seeds, {{which make up}} more than 99% of their diet. Rarely, they will eat snails or insects. Mourning doves generally eat enough to fill their crops and then fly away to digest while resting. They often swallow grit such as fine gravel or sand to assist with digestion. The species usually forages on the ground, walking but not hopping. At bird feeders, mourning doves are attracted to one of the largest ranges of seed types of any North American bird, with a preference for canola, corn, millet, safflower, and sunflower seeds. Mourning doves do not dig or scratch for seeds, though they will push aside ground litter; instead they <b>eat</b> <b>what</b> is readily visible. They will sometimes perch on plants and eat from there.|$|E

She is an avid supporter of charities, and stood as a trustee of a British charity helping those with alcohol and substance abuse issues (at the time called The Chemical Dependency Centre and later renamed Action on Addiction in 2007). She also supported the Lavender Trust at Breast Cancer Care and The Elton John AIDS Foundation. Criticised for being [...] "too skinny", she responded: [...] "I've been nine stone for 20 years, I always <b>eat</b> <b>what</b> I want, it's not an issue for me. But it pisses me off - because if people did decide that I starved myself, {{it would have a}} direct consequence on what we advocate!'".|$|E
500|$|At {{the dining}} room, Diane orders them {{to wait for}} dinner until the turkey is ready. As suppertime is passing, the turkey is still very undercooked and the {{trimmings}} have gone cold. Carla and Norm start blaming {{each other for the}} turkey's slow cooking. Norm throws some of Carla's peas at her, and she then throws carrots back at him. Cliff throws mashed yams at Frasier, who accidentally throws gravy skin back at Woody, intended for Cliff. The whole gang is poised to start a food fight until Diane stands up and tells them loudly to stop. When she is close to scolding them, Sam throws cranberry sauce at her, so the food fight resumes. By the time the food fight ends, the turkey is finally cooked. The gang calms down and decides to <b>eat</b> <b>what</b> they can. Diane comes out of the kitchen and throws a pumpkin pie to spite Sam for throwing cranberry sauce at her. The pie misses Sam but accidentally hits Vera as she enters. Vera tells Norm to fetch his coat, and Norm says, [...] "Yes, dear." ...|$|E

2500|$|One {{classical}} {{version of}} the optimal foraging theory is the optimal diet model, which {{is also known as}} the prey choice model or the contingency model. [...] In this model, the predator encounters different prey items and decides whether to <b>eat</b> <b>what</b> it has or search for a more profitable prey item. [...] The model predicts that foragers should ignore low profitability prey items when more profitable items are present and abundant.|$|E
2500|$|Starting in 1992, {{there was}} an {{advertising}} campaign that featured children expressing their enjoyment of Apple Jacks, regardless of its lack of apple flavor. The slogan for this campaign became [...] "We <b>eat</b> <b>what</b> we like". The shift toward marketing cereals directly at children signaled the growing recognition of children's influence on family purchases. The commercials took place in such normal kid hang-outs as the at school, garage, ballet class, the kitchen and such. After each commercial, the group of children would pose for a group Polaroid of the entire group.|$|E
2500|$|Carina Garland notes how {{the world}} is [...] "expressed via {{representations}} of food and appetite", naming Alice's frequent desire for consumption (of both food and words) her [...] "Curious Appetites". Often, the idea of eating coincides to make gruesome images. After the riddle [...] "Why is a raven like a writing-desk?", the Hatter claims that Alice might as well say, [...] "I see what I eat… I <b>eat</b> <b>what</b> I see" [...] and so the riddle's solution, put forward by Boe Birns, could be that [...] "A raven eats worms; a writing desk is worm-eaten"; this idea of food encapsulates the idea of life feeding on life, for the worm is being eaten and then becomes the eater [...] a horrific image of mortality.|$|E

2500|$|Details of {{what had}} {{happened}} with the poll were picked up by various media; as one writer explained, [...] "Voting for Hank offered people a chance to violate People's expectations while still playing by its rules”. [...] Some observers concluded that the reaction by the public to vote for Hank was a veiled commentary on how the media assumes that the masses are easily manipulated into liking what is marketed to them. The New York Times quoted a participant in the poll as stating, [...] "The 'media' tells us what food to <b>eat,</b> <b>what</b> movies to see, what music to listen to, who to vote for politically and what kind of people are attractive enough to have relationships with!...Voting for 'Hank the Dwarf' is a reflection of how the people really feel about media!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{interpretation}} obviates all of {{the speculation}} about the Sabbath year entirely, translating the verse as: [...] "And this shall be the sign for you, this year you shall <b>eat</b> <b>what</b> grows by itself, and the next year, what grows from the tree stumps, and in the third year, sow and reap, and plant vineyards and eat their fruit." [...] According to the Judaica Press commentary, it was Sennacherib's invasion that prevented the people of Judah from sowing {{in the first year}} and Isaiah was promising that enough plants would grow to feed the population {{for the rest of the}} first year and the second year. Therefore, Isaiah was truly providing a sign to Hezekiah that God would save the city of Jerusalem, as explicitly stated, and not an injunction concerning the Sabbath (shmita) or jubilee (yovel) years, which are not mentioned at all in the passage.|$|E

Accordingly, several researchers have identified worldview transformation in members of various self-help groups dealing with addiction issues.

2500|$|At 2:00 AM on July 29 to take {{advantage}} of the cool of night, Nolan resumed his heartless track south-east by compass. Nolan had wanted to start earlier but a horse went down and unable to move. The men cut its throat and drank its blood. Nolan again repacked what he thought was most important and abandoned the rest. The rode then walked the horses and repeated the process over and over. As the day progressed, the walks got longer because of the condition of the animals. The clouds helped, but no rain fell on Nolan's command on the [...] "Staked Plains." [...] They lost another horse and watched rain appear to fall from whence they had come.

[...] Nolan and Cooper struggled to keep their remaining men alive and were as harsh as they needed to be. Another soldier walked away from the command and he would finally find water about 3:00PM the next day or some ninety-six hours without water.|$|E

These were the ‘left-overs’ from the morning, and now the cook wanted to feed them to us. [...] Although I was very angry, I made no remark, but quietly left the table and went over where Buffalo Bill and the head officials of the show were eating dinner. Colonel Cody asked, ‘What is it, Standing Bear?’ ‘Colonel Cody,’ I replied, ‘this morning all the other races represented in the show were served with pancakes, but the Indians were not given any. [...] We do not object to that, as we do not care for them; but now the cook has put his old pancakes on our table and expects us to <b>eat</b> <b>what</b> was left over from breakfast, and it isn’t right.’ [...] Buffalo Bill’s eyes snapped, as he arose from the table. ‘Come with me, Standing Bear,’ he exclaimed. [...] We went direct to {{the manager of the}} dining-room, and the Colonel said to him, ‘Look here, sir, you are trying to feed my Indians left-over pancakes from the morning meal. [...] I want you to understand, sir, that I will not stand for such treatment.
