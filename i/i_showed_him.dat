The story ends with Cowley telling himself, [...] " [...] 'I showed him...I guess <b>I</b> <b>showed</b> <b>him.</b> I guess <b>I</b> <b>showed</b> <b>him</b> I ain't so queer", a proclamation obviously laced with dramatic irony.|$|E

I yelled against the wind...I felt I was not arguing with him, but with death itself, with the death he had already chosen." [...] An alert sounds, the camp lights go out, and Eliezer, exhausted, follows the crowd to the barracks, leaving his father behind. He wakes at dawn on a wooden bunk, remembering that he has a father, and goes in search of him.|$|E

2500|$|Early in 1952, Wilkins began {{a series}} of {{experiments}} on sepia sperm which were very encouraging. [...] "I...got much clearer patterns than the previous year.....when I met [...] Bragg by chance <b>I</b> <b>showed</b> <b>him</b> the pattern [...] very clearly offered strong evidence for a helical structure for DNA....the sharp sperm patterns were very inspiring, and had the special interest that sperm were real live objects and not just purified DNA extracted by chemists from living material". Wilkins was particularly interested in whether living samples would yield meaningful X-ray diffraction patterns – his results showed they could.|$|E

[...] Rockefeller and the Fund became investors in StarMedia, which moved its headquarters from Connecticut to the city and quickly grew to more than 700 employees worldwide.

He began coughing and spitting blood. <b>I</b> <b>showed</b> <b>him</b> the blood. He remarked {{that he had a}} burning sensation around his lungs. He tried to undress but was unable. I convinced him to see a doctor, he accepted. Then Édouard added ‘I will die, it’s so sad to die so young and so far away from dear parents.’ He asked for a glass of water. I ran to get water and at my return he was already unconscious. The ambulance transported him to the Emergency Hospital where he died a few minutes later.” Édouard Beaupré died on July 3, 1904 from a pulmonary hemorrhage at age 23.

2500|$|In another article, Fitzpatrick told of {{his work}} with a student who had been [...] "horribly crippled" [...] from birth. [...] The student asked to be excused from the {{compulsory}} gymnasium work, claiming it would be [...] "utterly impossible" [...] for him to participate. The student had never walked a step, his legs were twisted out of shape, {{and he could not}} control his head and neck. Fitzpatrick denied the request and promised the young man: [...] "I will teach you to walk." [...] Fitzpatrick invented exercises to strengthen every part of the student's body, until eventually the student could walk on his own. Fitzpatrick recalled:"Day after day I taught him. [...] <b>I</b> <b>showed</b> <b>him</b> how to step and helped him with my hands to take steps. The first two steps he took alone were followed by tears of joy. Of course, he'll never be able to walk as an able-bodied man, but he learned to discard his shuffle. ... This is but an instance of gymnasium work's benefits. If people realized the value of physical culture, we would be a splendidly developed race of men and women." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 1989 {{interview}} with a Japanese newspaper, James Randi {{was quoted as saying}} that Geller had driven a scientist to [...] "shoot himself in the head" [...] after finding out that Geller had fooled him. Randi afterwards claimed it was a metaphor lost in translation. The story was also repeated in a Canadian newspaper, which quoted Randi as saying essentially the same thing: [...] "One scientist, a metallurgist, wrote a paper backing Geller's claims that he could bend metal. The scientist shot himself after <b>I</b> <b>showed</b> <b>him</b> how the key bending trick was done." [...] In 1990, Geller sued Randi in a Japanese court over the statements published in the Japanese newspaper. Randi claims that he could not afford to defend himself, therefore he lost the case by default. The court declared Randi's statement an [...] "insult" [...] as opposed to libel, and awarded a token judgement against Randi, only [...] "one-third of one-percent of what he'd demanded". Since the charge of [...] "insult" [...] is only recognized in Chinese and Japanese law, Randi was not required to pay. Later in 1995 Geller agreed not to pursue payment of the Japanese fine. Randi maintains that he has never paid even one dollar or even one cent to Geller.|$|E
2500|$|While it {{has never}} been {{published}} or seen, Brodovitch did the design work for what would have been the very first publication of Truman Capote's novella Breakfast at Tiffany's in Harper's Bazaar. [...] The novella was to appear in the July, 1958 issue. It was to be illustrated with a series of photo montages by David Attie, who had been a student of Brodovitch's the previous year and was offered the job on the final night of the class. [...] Alice Morris, the fiction editor of Harper's, recalled that [...] "Brodovitch... had these wonderful photos taken {{that had nothing to do}} with the Breakfast story, but with Holly Golightly's cat. [...] A cat in a window, mysterious-looking, slightly shady and misty." [...] However, after the publication was scheduled, longtime Harper's editor Carmel Snow, who had wielded considerable influence, was ousted by the magazine's publisher, the Hearst Corporation, and replaced with her niece. Hearst executives then began asking for changes to the novella's tart language. By this time, Attie's montages and Brodovitch's design work had been completed, and Morris recounted that while Capote initially refused to make any changes, he relented [...] "partly because <b>I</b> <b>showed</b> <b>him</b> the layouts. We had about six pages with beautiful, atmospheric photographs." [...] Yet despite Capote's changes, Hearst ordered Harper's not to run the novella anyway. [...] Its language and subject matter were still deemed [...] "not suitable," [...] and there was concern that Tiffany's, a major advertiser, would react negatively. An outraged Capote soon took the work to Esquire, and it appeared in the November 1958 issue without Attie's or Brodovitch's contributions.|$|E
