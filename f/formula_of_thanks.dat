60|$|At {{the top of}} {{the great}} staircase, {{receiving}} everybody, stood Clement Darpent, looking rather pale, and his advocate's black dress decorated with heavy weepers of crape. When he saw us his face lighted up, and he came down to the landing to meet us, an attention of course due to our rank; but it was scarcely the honour done to the family that made his voice so fervent in his exclamation, 'Ah! this is true goodness,' though it was only addressed to me, and of course it was my hand that he held as he conducted us upstairs, and to the great chamber where his mother sat up in her bed, not, as you may imagine, in the cloud of lace and cambric which had coquettishly shrouded the widowhood of poor little Madame de Chatillon. All was plain and severe, though scrupulously neat. There was not an ornament in the room, only a crucifix and a holy-water stoup {{by the side of the}} bed, and a priest standing by, of the grave and severe aspect which distinguished those connected with Port Royal aux Champs. Madame Darpent's face looked white and shrunken, but there was a beautiful peace and calmness on it, as if she dwelt in a region far above and beyond the trifling world around her, and only submitted, like one in a dream, to these outward formalities. I felt quite ashamed to disturb her with my dull commonplace compliment of condolence, and I do not think she in the least saw or knew who we were as her lips moved in the <b>formula</b> <b>of</b> <b>thanks.</b> Then Clement led us away in the stream to the buffet, where was the cake and wine of which it was etiquette for every one to partake, though we only drank out of clear glass, not out of silver, as when the mourners are noble. Monsieur Verdon and some familiars of the house, whether friends or relations I do not know, were attending to this, and there was a hum of conversation around; but there was no acquaintance of ours present, and nobody ventured to speak to us, except that Clement said: 'She will be gratified, when she has time to understand.' And then he asked whether I had heard anything of my brother.|$|E
5000|$|Among Europeans (includes the Americas and Australia) and {{sometimes}} east Asians (esp. in Japan), the phrases for “thank you” are expected and welcomed {{in quite a}} number of situations (it's said the most in Great Britain and North America), whereas South Asian and Middle Eastern people use the phrase in a more economical way and often contend themselves with simple looks of thanks; on the other hand, other non-western civilizations (i.e. Polynesians of the south Pacific and Native American tribes) have rather extended <b>formulae</b> <b>of</b> <b>thanks.</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} aimed {{to be an}} accurate and detailed analysis of profitability and costs of bank deposits and loans for individual clients in the Czech market with possibility to make {{a comparison of the}} advantages of the Czech banks' products. Moreover, in general, the thesis tries to refute or confirm the criticism about the magnitude of bank fees in the Czech Republic. The principle of the analysis is based on a comparative tool designed in MS Excel containing defined parameters in the form of actual fees and interest rates and the appropriate <b>formulas</b> <b>of</b> financial mathematics, <b>thanks</b> to which, it is able to calculate the return on the deposit or total costs of loan products. The final amount is calculated for specific flexibly entered inputs such as the amount of the deposit or loan repayment period. This tool is an electronic attachment to this work...|$|R
