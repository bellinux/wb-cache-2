Keywords Iliotibial band Knee pain Running injuries Iliotibial <b>band</b> <b>friction</b> syndrome What is iliotibial <b>band</b> <b>friction</b> syndrome? Iliotibial <b>band</b> <b>friction</b> syndrome (ITBFS) involves pain {{in the region of}} the lateral femoral condyle or slightly inferior to it, that occurs after repetitive motion of the knee, typically in a runner, cyclist, or other athlete. Most typically a diagnosis is made based on the case history and physical examination, though in some cases MRI’s might be indicated to rule out another disorder in the region. An important finding on physical examination is local tenderness of the lateral knee inferior to the epicondyle and superior to the joint line. The Ober test for distensibility o...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn {{the present}} study, thermal {{striping}} development on <b>friction</b> <b>bands</b> of brake discs is investigated through an experimental and numerical analysis. A test {{consisting of a}} series of several hundred severe brakings was carried out on a specific bench at PSA Peugeot Citroën. The experimental observations of the crack network evolution and a numerical analysis of a brake disc with a single crack helped to propose a macroscopic criterion capable of predicting the criticality of the network, namely, its ability to lead to the complete failure of the structure. In addition, a numerical analysis of the crack shielding process is developed whose results are compared with experimental findings...|$|R
50|$|In its {{simplest}} form {{an engine}} {{is connected to}} a rotating drum {{by means of an}} output shaft. A <b>friction</b> <b>band</b> is wrapped around half the drum's circumference and each end attached to a separate spring balance. A substantial pre-load is then applied {{to the ends of the}} band, so that each spring balance has an initial and identical reading. When the engine is running, the frictional force between the drum and the band will increase the force reading on one balance and decrease it on the other. The difference between the two readings multiplied by the radius of the driven drum is equal to the torque. If the engine speed is measured with a tachometer, the brake horsepower is easily calculated.|$|E
50|$|The Matchless Model 7 is a British 'touring' {{motorcycle}} {{designed and}} made by Harry and Charlie Collier. Based on the proven 85mm x 85mm JAP V-twin engine, the Model 7 had a two-speed transmission with a hub gear and an epicyclic gear {{for the low}} ratio, with a <b>friction</b> <b>band</b> clutch operated by a hand lever {{at the side of}} the fuel tank. Problems with unreliable belt drive were addressed by having two belts side by side, so when the first broke, the second would still work. The 770cc engine was started like a moped with pedals, and a small lever on the end of the silencer could be used to eject smoke and sparks. The paintwork was all done by hand in page grey with a forest-green panelled tank lined in gold pinstriping.|$|E
5000|$|A modern {{draw-works}} {{consists of}} five main parts: the drum, the motor(s), the reduction gear, the brake, and the auxiliary brake. The motors can be AC or DC-motors, or the draw-works may be connected directly to diesel engines using metal chain-like belts. The {{number of gears}} could be one, two or three speed combinations. The main brake, usually operated manually by a long handle, may be <b>friction</b> <b>band</b> brake, a disc brake or a modified clutch. It serves as a parking brake when no motion is desired. The auxiliary brake {{is connected to the}} drum, and absorbs the energy released as heavy loads are lowered. This brake may use eddy current rotors or water-turbine-like apparatus to convert the kinetic energy of the moving load to heat and dissipate it.|$|E
50|$|In November 2015, Hellbastard {{played a}} fairly {{successful}} European tour with great reception from the punk D.I.Y scene.

The band were then rejoined by Paul OShea on bass and joined by new guitarist, Danny Blundell. A USA tour was planned for February 2016 plus 2 open air festivals with Hellbastard included on the lineup. Paul OShea was subsequently replaced by Dave Ingram of UK metal band Vindicator. A session drummer was hired for the festival shows.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe present paper details an elasto-viscoplastic {{constitutive}} model for automotive brake discs made of flake graphite cast iron. In a companion paper, the authors proposed a one-dimensional setting appropriate for representing the complex {{behavior of the}} material (i. e. asymmetry between tensile and compres-sive loadings) under anisothermal conditions. The generalization of this 1 D model to 3 D cases on a volume element and the associated challenges are addressed. A direct transposition is not possible and an alternative solution without unilateral conditions is first proposed. Induced anisotropic damage and associated consti-tutive laws are then introduced. The transition from the volume element to the real structure and the numerical implementation requires a specific basis change. Brake disc simulations with this {{constitutive model}} show that unilateral conditions are needed for the <b>friction</b> <b>bands.</b> A damage deactivation procedure is therefore defined...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{perturbation}} approach rooted in time-dependent density-functional theory to calculate electron hole (eh) -pair excitation spectra during the non-adiabatic vibrational damping of adsorbates on metal surfaces. Our {{analysis for the}} benchmark systems CO on Cu(100) and Pt(111) elucidates the surprisingly strong influence of rather short electronic coherence times. We demonstrate how {{in the limit of}} short electronic coherence times, as implicitly assumed in prevalent quantum nuclear theories for the vibrational lifetimes as well as electronic <b>friction,</b> <b>band</b> structure effects are washed out. Our results suggest that more accurate lifetime or chemicurrent-like experimental measurements could characterize the electronic coherence.
