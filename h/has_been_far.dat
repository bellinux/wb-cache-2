Chinese Central Asia <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>far</b> from the centre of that country's economic boom and the area has remained considerably poorer than the coast.

It {{is seen in}} insect processes in roles similar to in the human central nervous system, such as memory, appetite, sleep, and behavior. Locust swarming is mediated by serotonin, by transforming social preference from aversion to a gregarious state that enables coherent groups.

It currently lists CFS/ME with a highlight notice, inviting researchers to develop high-quality research proposals for funding. In February 2010, the All-Party Parliamentary Group on ME (APPG on ME) produced a legacy paper, which welcomed the recent MRC initiative, but felt that there <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>far</b> too much emphasis in the past on psychological research, with insufficient attention to biomedical research, {{and that it is}} vital that further biomedical research be undertaken to help discover a cause and more effective forms of management for this disease.|$|E

Mendelson enjoyed the trailer, but wished it did not reveal as many story elements as it did.

500|$|The Hall of Fame {{has been}} criticized for {{inducting}} several lacklustre candidates in the early 2000s decade due to [...] "a shortage of true greatness". Since then, some have claimed that the Hall of Fame has become too exclusive. The Hall of Fame has also been criticized for failing to induct international players and critics have claimed that the Hall <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>far</b> too focused on the National Hockey League. A common statement is that it is more of an [...] "NHL Hall of Fame" [...] than a general Hockey Hall of Fame. Partially in response to these claims, the Hall of Fame opened an International Hockey exhibit and announced that it would start looking at more international players for induction. Valeri Kharlamov was inducted in 2005, {{and is one of the}} few modern-day inductees to never play in the NHL. The Hall of Fame has also been criticized for overlooking World Hockey Association players and over representing the Original Six era from 1942 to 1967. For several years, the Hall of Fame was criticized for overlooking female hockey players before the Hall of Fame announced that women would be given separate consideration. In 2010, Angela James and Cammi Granato were the first women to be inducted into the Hall of Fame.|$|E

500|$|Lafayette's {{reputation}} in France is more problematic. Thomas Gaines, {{in his book}} about Lafayette, noted that the response to Lafayette's death was far more muted in France than in America, and suggested that {{this may have been}} because Lafayette was the last surviving hero of America's only revolution, whereas the evolution of the French government <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>far</b> more chaotic. Lafayette's role, especially in the French Revolution, created a more nuanced picture of him in French historiography. To the 19th century historian Jules Michelet, Lafayette was a [...] "mediocre idol", lifted by the mob far beyond what his talents deserved. In their Histoire et dictionnaire de la Révolution française, Jean Tulard, Jean-François Fayard, and Alfred Fierro noted Napoleon's deathbed comment about Lafayette that, if Napoleon had had Lafayette's place during the French Revolution, [...] "the king would still be sitting on his throne". They called Napoleon's comment [...] "not too excessive" [...] and deemed Lafayette [...] "an empty-headed political dwarf [...] one of the people most responsible for the destruction of the French monarchy". Gaines disagreed, and noted that liberal and Marxist historians have also dissented from that view of Lafayette. As Lloyd Kramer related in a survey of the French public, just before the Revolution's bicentennial in 1989, 57 percent deemed Lafayette the figure from the Revolution they most admired, with Marat and Saint-Just tying for second with 21 percent each: [...] "he [...] clearly had more French supporters in the early 1990s than he could muster in the early 1790s".|$|E
500|$|In a {{contemporary}} review, Rolling Stone critic Rob Tannenbaum found Emotions dependent on [...] "commercial dance-pop" [...] and Carey's indulgent vocal exercises, {{making it difficult}} for listeners to connect with the lyrics. [...] "Carey has a remarkable vocal gift, but to date, unfortunately, her singing <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>far</b> more impressive than expressive," [...] Tannenbaum wrote. Dennis Hunt from the Los Angeles Times said Carey's [...] "spectacular and impressive" [...] voice was comparable to that of Whitney Houston, but criticized the songwriting and production for [...] "playing high on the angst scale." [...] In The New York Times, Stephen Holden believed the record showcased Carey's vocal strengths more effectively than her debut, but showed no improvement in writing lyrics, which Holden said [...] "describe the rapturous highs and desperate lows of romance in blunt, strung-together pop clichés, with minimal rhyming." [...] Arion Berger from Entertainment Weekly found the record [...] "colder and more calculated" [...] than Carey's debut, describing Emotions as [...] "the hybrid progeny of a venerable tradition — the tradition of the R diva — and crass commercial instincts. it's gospel without soul, love songs without passion, pop without buoyancy." [...] Orlando Sentinel editor Parry Gettelman was also critical of Carey's vocal acrobatics, writing that the singer had become [...] "so enamored of the ultra-high-frequency part of her range that I'm starting to suspect she may be an intergalactic spy trying to re- establish communications with the far-off Planet of Dogs." [...] Steve Morse from The Boston Globe was more enthusiastic in his review, deeming Emotions [...] "a quantum leap in maturity and confidence" [...] from her first album. He called the lyrics [...] "remarkable," [...] the ballads [...] "unspeakably beautiful," [...] and Carey's vocal and songwriting ability [...] "unlimited." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} for The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw wrote, [...] "I felt {{occasionally}} that Owen's rumpled performance {{is in danger}} of becoming a little one-note ... but this is still an unexpectedly well–made thriller with brainpower as well as firepower". Philip French, in his review for The Observer, called the film a [...] "slick, fast-moving conspiracy thriller" [...] and the gunfight in the Guggenheim [...] "spectacular". In his review for The Independent, Anthony Quinn wrote, [...] "It's reasonably efficient, passably entertaining, and strenuously playing catch-up with the Bourne movies: flat-footed Owen doesn't look as good as Matt Damon sprinting through city streets, and the editing doesn't match Paul Greengrass's whiplash pace". The New Yorker magazine's David Denby wrote, [...] "And there's a big hole {{in the middle of the}} movie: the director, Tom Tykwer, and the screenwriter, Eric Warren Singer, forgot to make their two crusaders human beings". In his review for The New York Post, Lou Lumenick wrote, [...] "There, an anticlimactic rooftop chase reminds us that Tykwer, the German director who reinvented the Euro thriller with Run, Lola, Run a decade ago, <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>far</b> surpassed by Paul Greengrass and the Bourne adventures, yet thankfully lacking the rampant and nonsensical roller-coaster style of editing, where no shot lingers for longer than a nano-second.". A.O. Scott, in his review for The New York Times, wrote, [...] "The International, in contrast, is so undistinguished that the moments you remember best are those that you wish another, more original director had tackled". Citing the climatic shoot-out in the Guggenheim, hailed by other critics as spectacular, Scott wonders if another, such as Brian de Palma could have [...] "turned into a fugue of architectural paranoia"? ...|$|E
