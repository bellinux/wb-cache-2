The IMC has single tuning parameter to adjust the performance and robustness of the controller. The proposed method is the efficient in set-point tracking and disturbance rejection and controlling the overshoot, stability and dynamics of the speed control of turbine. The results obtained in simulated environment implemented in LabVIEW show the improvement in the performance compared to PID tuning using convention techniques like Ziegler-Nicholas (Z-N) rules and tuning technique proposed by Y.
