40|$|The project {{developed}} and trialed {{a method of}} mapping <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functions</b> in South East Queensland using biophysical data layers in preference to land use surrogates. Biophysical data and surrogates were identified for 19 <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functions</b> and maps were produced for each. Data layers for each <b>ecosystem</b> <b>function</b> were standardized for mapping purposes using existing expert advice or data quantiling. Two versions of the total <b>ecosystem</b> <b>function</b> overlap maps were also produced, showing areas of high <b>ecosystem</b> <b>function</b> that {{have the potential to}} contribute to high ecosystem service provision. This method was successfully used to replace land use surrogates in most cases, and produced maps that planners and decision makers considered credible.

40|$|Ecosystems {{provide a}} vast array of {{services}} for human societies, but understanding how various organisms contribute to the functions that maintain these services remains an important ecological challenge. Predators can affect <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functions</b> through a combination of top-down trophic cascades and bottom-up effects on nutrient dynamics. As the most abundant vertebrate predator in many eastern US forests, woodland salamanders (Plethodon spp.) likely affect <b>ecosystems</b> <b>functions.</b> We examined the effects of red-backed salamanders (Plethodon cinereus) on a variety of forest <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functions</b> using a combined approach of large-scale salamander removals (314 -m 2 plots) and small-scale enclosures (2 m 2) where we explicitly manipulated salamander density (0, 0. 5, 1, 2, 4 m 22). In these experiments, we measured the rates of litter and wood decomposition, potential nitrogen mineralization and nitrification rates, acorn germination, and foliar insect damage on red oak seedlings. Across both experimental venues, we found no significant effect of red-backed salamanders on any of the <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functions.</b> We also found no effect of salamanders on intraguild predator abundance (carabid beetles, centipedes, spiders). Our study adds to the already conflicting evidence on effects of red-backed salamander and other amphibians on terrestrial <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functions.</b> It appears likely that the impact of terrestrial amphibians on <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functions</b> is context dependent.

40|$|Water {{infrastructure}} is {{a cornerstone of}} economic development. In the Zambezi River Basin huge investments {{have been made in}} dams for hydropower, irrigation, water supply and flood control. <b>Ecosystem</b> <b>functions</b> are central to outcomes from dams. Not only does the performance of dams depend on <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functions</b> but dams also modify them (e. g. by changing natural flow regimes). It is by changing <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functions</b> (and hence <b>ecosystem</b> services) that dams often have their greatest impact on the livelihoods of poor people. However, investment decisions and, subsequently the management of dams, rarely consider <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functions.</b> Trade-offs and synergies between dams and <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functions</b> often go unrecognized and, as a result, the benefits accruing from dams are typically sub-optimal. One reason for the failure to consider <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functions</b> is lack of understanding of them and how they translate into services for people. It is not clear which <b>ecosystems</b> perform which <b>functions</b> or how they will be affected by a dam. For example, whilst it is widely understood that in relation to hydrology, different ecosystems provide different regulating functions, there is little quantitative information {{on the extent to which}} they do this or the dynamic nature of such <b>functions.</b> If <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functions,</b> and specifically flow regulating functions, are to be considered in dam planning and management more information and a method to incorporate them into decision-making processes is required.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between species diversity and <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functions</b> has generated considerable debate among ecologists. <b>Ecosystem</b> <b>functions</b> (e. g. productivity, nutrient retention) are often {{positively correlated with}} species richness in experimental plant assemblages, but little or no correlation exists in natural communities. We {{examined the effects of}} species richness on productivity and available soil nitrate by experimentally manipulating richness using random draws from a pool of ten perennial grasses. Species richness had no significant effect on aboveground productivity or soil nitrate availability, suggesting that functional diversity may be more important than species richness in determining <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functions.</b> The {{relationship between}} diversity and <b>ecosystem</b> <b>functions</b> may also depend on resource limitation.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between biodiversity and <b>ecosystem</b> <b>function</b> {{has received a}} great deal of attention in ecological research and recent results, from re-analyses, suggest that <b>ecosystem</b> <b>function</b> improves with increases in phylogenetic diversity. However, many of these results have been generalized across a range of different species and clades, and plants with different evolutionary histories could display different relationships between biodiversity and <b>ecosystem</b> <b>function.</b> To experimentally test this hypothesis, we manipulated species richness and phylogenetic diversity using 26 species from two subgenera of the genus Eucalyptus (subgenus Eucalyptus and subgenus Symphyomyrtus). We found that plant biomass (a measurement of <b>ecosystem</b> <b>function)</b> sometimes, but not always, responded to increases in species richness and phylogenetic diversity. Specifically, Symphyomyrtus plants showed a positive response while no comparable effect was observed for Eucalyptus plants, showing that responses to biodiversity can vary across different phylogenetic groups.

40|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} {{focus on the}} impacts of environmental change on <b>ecosystem</b> <b>function</b> arising from changes in species richness. However, environmental change may affect <b>ecosystem</b> <b>function</b> without affecting richness, most notably by affecting population densities and community composition. Using a theoretical model, we find that, despite invariant richness, (1) small environmental effects may already lead to a collapse of function; (2) competitive strength may be a less important determinant of <b>ecosystem</b> <b>function</b> change than the selectivity of the environmental change driver and (3) effects on <b>ecosystem</b> <b>function</b> increase when effects on composition are larger. We also present a complementary statistical analysis of 13 data sets of phytoplankton and periphyton communities exposed to chemical stressors and show that effects on primary production under invariant richness ranged from − 75 % to + 10 %. We conclude that environmental protection goals relying on measures of richness could underestimate ecological impacts of environmental change. </p...|$|R
