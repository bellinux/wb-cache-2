A comparison between the plots of Vads vs potential for SBA- 16, LPC and MCF suggested that the differences are a consequence of the non equilibrium evaporation mechanism of the organics from the pores of SBA- 16 and LPC. The isosteric <b>enthalpies</b> of adsorption indicated that the strength of the gas-solid interactions for toluene is superior to those corresponding to neopentane, methylcyclohexane or n-pentane.

5|$|In the gas phase, and at {{very low}} {{temperatures}} in the condensed phase, the alkali metals form covalently bonded diatomic molecules. The metal–metal bond lengths in these M2 molecules increase down the group from Li2 to Cs2, but then decrease after that to Uue2, due to the aforementioned relativistic effects that stabilize the 8s orbital. The opposite trend is shown for the metal–metal bond-dissociation energies. The Uue–Uue bond should be slightly stronger than the K–K bond. From these M2 dissociation energies, the <b>enthalpy</b> of sublimation (ΔHsub) of ununennium is predicted to be 94kJ·mol−1 (the value for francium should be around 77kJ·mol−1).|$|E
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} {{are among the}} most {{electropositive}} elements on the periodic table and thus tend to bond ionically to the most electronegative elements on the periodic table, the halogens (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, and astatine), forming salts known as the alkali metal halides. The reaction is very vigorous and can sometimes result in explosions. All twenty stable alkali metal halides are known; the unstable ones are not known, with the exception of sodium astatide, because of the great instability and rarity of astatine and francium. The most well-known of the twenty is certainly sodium chloride, otherwise known as common salt. All of the stable alkali metal halides have the formula MX where M is an alkali metal and X is a halogen. They are all white ionic crystalline solids that have high melting points. All the alkali metal halides are soluble in water except for lithium fluoride (LiF), which is insoluble in water due to its very high lattice <b>enthalpy.</b> The high lattice <b>enthalpy</b> of lithium fluoride is due to the small sizes of the Li+ and F− ions, causing the electrostatic interactions between them to be strong: a similar effect occurs for magnesium fluoride, consistent with the diagonal relationship between lithium and magnesium.|$|E

5|$|Unambiguous {{determination}} of the chemical characteristics of nihonium has yet to have been established. The isotopes 284Nh, 285Nh, and 286Nh have half-lives long enough for chemical investigation. It is theoretically predicted that nihonium should have an <b>enthalpy</b> of sublimation around 150kJ/mol and an <b>enthalpy</b> of adsorption on a gold surface around −159kJ/mol. From 2010 to 2012, some preliminary chemical experiments were performed at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research to determine the volatility of nihonium. The reaction used was 243Am(48Ca,3n)288Mc; the isotope 288Mc has a short half-life and would quickly decay to the longer-lived 284Nh, which would be chemically investigated. Teflon capillaries at 70°C connecting the recoil chamber, where the nihonium atoms were synthesized, and the gold-covered detectors: the nihonium atoms would be carried along the capillaries by a carrier gas. While about ten to twenty atoms of 284Nh were produced, none of these atoms were registered by the gold-covered detectors, suggesting either that nihonium was similar in volatility to the noble gases or, more plausibly, that pure nihonium was not very volatile and thus could not efficiently pass through the Teflon capillaries at 70°C. Formation of the hydroxide NhOH would ease the transport, as nihonium hydroxide {{is expected to be}} more volatile than elemental nihonium, and this reaction could be facilitated by adding more water vapor into the carrier gas. However, it seems likely that this formation is not kinetically favored, so that the longer-lived isotope 286Nh, created as the granddaughter of 294Ts, might be more desirable for future experiments.|$|E

5|$|Calcium {{is a very}} ductile silvery metal with a {{pale yellow}} tint whose {{properties}} {{are very similar to}} the heavier elements in its group, strontium, barium, and radium. A calcium atom has twenty electrons, arranged in the electron configuration 4s2. Like the other elements placed in group 2 of the periodic table, calcium has two valence electrons in the outermost s-orbital, which are very easily lost in chemical reactions to form a dipositive ion with the stable electron configuration of a noble gas, in this case argon. Hence, calcium is almost always divalent in its compounds, which are usually ionic. Hypothetical univalent salts of calcium would be stable with respect to their elements, but not to disproportionation to the divalent salts and calcium metal, because the <b>enthalpy</b> of formation of MX2 is much higher than those of the hypothetical MX. This occurs because of the much greater lattice energy afforded by the more highly charged Ca2+ cation compared to the hypothetical Ca+ cation.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the relativistic contraction and binding of the 7s subshell, the 6d5/2 orbital {{is expected to be}} destabilized due to spin-orbit coupling, making it behave similarly to the 7s orbital in terms of size, shape, and energy.

Copernicium is expected to crystallize in the hexagonal close-packed crystal structure, with lattice parameters a=332pm and c=540pm. The c/a ratio of 1.63 is the ideal value, establishing a kinship between solid copernicium and the solid noble gases, though its cohesive energy (<b>enthalpy</b> of crystallization) should be on the order of that of mercury rather than be near the lower value of the noble gases.|$|E
5|$|In the gas phase, the {{alkaline}} earth metals do not usually form covalently bonded diatomic molecules like the alkali metals do, since such molecules {{would have the}} same number of electrons in the bonding and antibonding orbitals and would have very low dissociation energies. Thus, the M–M bonding in these molecules is predominantly through van der Waals forces. The metal–metal bond lengths in these M2 molecules increase down the group from Ca2 to Ubn2. On the other hand, their metal–metal bond-dissociation energies generally increase from Ca2 to Ba2 and then drop precipitously to Ubn2, which should be the most weakly bound of all the group 2 homodiatomic molecules. The cause of this trend is the increasing participation of the p3/2 and d electrons as well as the relativistically contracted s orbital.
