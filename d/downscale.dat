However, the relatively low spatial resolution of GCMs outputs is unsatisfactory for the local-scale climate impact assessments.

In this review paper, recent advances in three fundamental statistical <b>downscaling</b> approaches (regression methods, weather type approaches and stochastic weather generators) were presented firstly.

Such techniques can be grouped into two approaches of dynamical and statistical <b>downscaling.</b> In this study, we investigated the performances of different <b>downscaling</b> methods, focusing on East Asian summer monsoon precipitation to obtain more finely resolved and value added datasets. The dynamical <b>downscaling</b> was conducted by the Regional Model Program (RMP) of the Global/Regional Integrated Model system (GRIMs), while the statistical <b>downscaling</b> was performed through coupled pattern-based simple linear regression. The dynamical <b>downscaling</b> resulted in a better representation of the spatial distribution and long-term trend than the GCM produced; however, it tended to overestimate precipitation over East Asia. In contrast, the application of the statistical <b>downscaling</b> resulted in a bias in the amount of precipitation, due to low variance that is inherent in regression-based <b>downscaling.</b> A combination of dynamical and statistical <b>downscaling</b> produced the best results in time and space. This study provides a guideline for determining the most effective and robust <b>downscaling</b> method in the hydrometeorological applications, which are quite sensitive to the accuracy of <b>downscaled</b> precipitation...|$|R

The objectives {{of this study are}} to compare three methods of applying statistical <b>downscaling</b> to catchment rainfall and evaluating their hydrological response with a hydrological model: (a) statistically <b>downscaling</b> to sites and then interpolating to gridded rainfall which is accumulated to catchment average rainfall; (b) statistically <b>downscaling</b> to catchment average rainfall directly; and (c) statistical <b>downscaling</b> to grid cells and then accumulating to catchment average rainfall. Results indicate that statistical <b>downscaling</b> can be successfully applied at catchment average and grid cell scales. All three methods of application performed similarly for a range of rainfall characteristics, with directly <b>downscaled</b> catchment average rainfall producing a relatively better result for extreme daily rainfall indices. However, hydrological simulation indicated that the direct <b>downscaling</b> of catchment average rainfall did not have any advantages over the other two <b>downscaling</b> application methods in terms of the runoff statistics evaluated. In addition, all three methods of <b>downscaling</b> application could simulate the spatial correlation of daily and annual runoff across the nine focus catchments investigated.

To improve the simulation accuracy of <b>downscaling</b> methods, the Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) method combined with three statistical <b>downscaling</b> methods, which are support vector machine (SVM), BCC/RCG-Weather Generators (BCC/RCG-WG), and Statistics <b>Downscaling</b> Model (SDSM), is proposed in this study, based on the statistical relationship between the larger scale climate predictors and observed precipitation in upper Hanjiang River Basin (HRB). The statistical analysis of three performance criteria (the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency, the coefficient of correlation, and the relative error) shows that the performance of ensemble <b>downscaling</b> method based on BMA for rainfall is better than that of each single statistical <b>downscaling</b> method. Moreover, the performance for the runoff modelled by the SWAT rainfall-runoff model using the <b>downscaled</b> daily rainfall by four methods is also compared, and the ensemble <b>downscaling</b> method has better simulation accuracy.

30|$|Over the years, the {{applicability}} of dynamical <b>downscaling</b> has significantly improved owing to the continuous development of computing technology and advances in numerical models. Even though the use of dynamical <b>downscaling</b> has become easier, {{it continues to be}} an extremely demanding method that requires considerable computational cost, simulation time, and output storage. Statistical <b>downscaling</b> is an alternative to dynamical <b>downscaling</b> for high-resolution climate <b>downscaling</b> that can overcome the drawbacks of dynamical <b>downscaling</b> methods. Statistical <b>downscaling</b> takes into account the empirical, spatial, and temporal relationships between large-scale climate indicators (predictors) and local-scale climate variables (predictands) and are trained on a historical period. Subsequently, these relationships are presumed to hold in the future, where they can be used to determine future predictands. Statistical <b>downscaling</b> methods are computationally inexpensive and significantly faster than dynamical <b>downscaling,</b> so they can be applied for even higher resolutions, up to station-scale. Since statistical <b>downscaling</b> methods rely on the assumption of an unchanged statistical relationship, they require long historical climate observation data for validation, which is not always available for every region. In contrast, dynamical <b>downscaling</b> operates based on physical realism with complex local processes, which allows it to map important fine-scale variations in climate that otherwise might not be included (Salathé Jr et al. 2008; Pierce et al. 2012; Walton et al. 2017).|$|R

While global climate models (GCMs) are important tools for climate change risk assessment at regional scales, even the increased spatial resolution of statistically <b>downscaled</b> GCMs (commonly approximately 1 / 8 deg) is not sufficient for hydrologic, ecologic, and land-use modeling of small watersheds within the mountainous Northeast. To address this limitation, an ensemble of topographically <b>downscaled,</b> high-resolution (30 "), daily 2 -m maximum air temperature; 2 -m minimum air temperature; and precipitation simulations are developed for the mountainous Northeast by applying an additional level of <b>downscaling</b> to intermediately <b>downscaled</b> (1 / 8 deg) data using high-resolution topography and station observations. First, observed relationships between 2 -m air temperature and elevation and between precipitation and elevation are derived. Then, these relationships are combined with spatial interpolation to enhance the resolution of intermediately <b>downscaled</b> GCM simulations. The resulting topographically <b>downscaled</b> dataset is analyzed {{for its ability to}} reproduce station observations. Topographic <b>downscaling</b> adds value to intermediately <b>downscaled</b> maximum and minimum 2 -m air temperature at high-elevation stations, as well as moderately improves domain-averaged maximum and minimum 2 -m air temperature. Topographic <b>downscaling</b> also improves mean precipitation but not daily probability distributions of precipitation. Overall, the utility of topographic <b>downscaling</b> is dependent on the initial bias of the intermediately <b>downscaled</b> product and the magnitude of the elevation adjustment.

However, the <b>downscaling</b> results may contain considerable uncertainty which needs to be quantified before making the results available.

40|$|The Australian {{eastern seaboard}} is a {{distinct}} climate entity from {{the interior of the}} continent, with different climatic influences {{on each side of the}} Great Dividing Range. Therefore, it is plausible that <b>downscaling</b> of global climate models could reveal meaningful regional detail, or 'added value', in the climate change signal of mean rainfall change in eastern Australia under future scenarios. However, because <b>downscaling</b> is typically done using a limited set of global climate models and <b>downscaling</b> methods, the results from a <b>downscaling</b> study may not represent the range of uncertainty in plausible projected change for a region suggested by the ensemble of host global cl imate models. A complete and unbiased representation of the plausible changes in the climate is essential in producing climate projections useful for future planning. As part of this aim it is important to quantify any differences in the change signal between global climate models and <b>downscaling,</b> and understand the cause of these differences in terms of plausible added regional detail in the climate change signal, the impact of sub-sampling global climate models and the effect of the <b>downscaling</b> models themselves. Here we examine rainfall projections in eastern Australia under a high emissions scenario by late in the century from ensembles of global climate models, two dynamical <b>downscaling</b> models and one statistical <b>downscaling</b> model. We find no cases where all three <b>downscaling</b> methods show the same clear regional spatial detail in the change signal that is distinct from the host models. However, some <b>downscaled</b> projections suggest that the eastern seaboard could see little change in spring rainfall, in contrast to the substantial rainfall decrease inland. The change signal in the <b>downscaled</b> outputs is broadly similar at the large scale in the various model outputs, with a few notable exceptions. For example, the model median from dynamical <b>downscaling</b> projects a rainfall increase over the entirety of eastern Australia in autumn that is greater than the global models. Also, there are some instances where a <b>downscaling</b> method produces changes outside the range of host models over eastern Australia as a whole, thus ex-panding the projected range of uncertainty. Results are particularly uncertain for summer, where no two <b>downscaling</b> studies clearly agree.
