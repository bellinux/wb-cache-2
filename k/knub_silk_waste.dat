40|$|Background & Aims of the Study: p-Chloronitrobenzene is a benzoic {{compound}} that {{widely used in}} many chemical industrials. p-Chloronitrobenzene may be absorbed through the skin and is suspected to causing cancer. So, developing an easy method to remove {{of it from the}} environment is necessary. Equilibrium isotherms and adsorption kinetics of p-Chloronitrobenzene onto modified <b>silk</b> <b>waste</b> were studied experimentally. 			Materials and Methods: <b>Silk</b> <b>waste</b> was modified by HCl and used as an adsorbent to remove of p-Chloronitrobenzene from aqueous solutions. After preparing of adsorbent, the adsorption experiments were down in a batch system in an erlen mayer at different concentrations of p-Chloronitrobenzene (20, 40, 60, 80, 100 mg/L), pH (2, 4, 6), dosage of modified <b>silk</b> <b>waste</b> (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 g/ 250 mL), temperature (20, 30, 40 oC) and contact time. 			Results: Data revealed that the adsorption of p-Chloronitrobenzene on to modified <b>silk</b> <b>waste</b> was reached equilibrium after 20 min. The adsorption of p-Chloronitrobenzene decreased with the increasing of pH and the concentration of p-Chloronitrobenzene which is increased by increasing of modified <b>silk</b> <b>waste</b> dosage. Also, data confirmed that changing of temperature did not have significant p-Chloronitrobenzene removal efficiency. Pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order equations were used to determine the kinetics of removal process. It was found that the adsorption of p-Chloronitrobenzene onto modified <b>silk</b> <b>waste</b> was obeyed from pseudo-second-order kinetic model. 			 		 	 Conclusion: The results indicated the adsorption of p-Chloronitrobenzene onto modified <b>silk</b> <b>waste</b> could be well fitted with the Freundlich isotherm and pseudo-second-order kinetic models...|$|R

40|$|Sericin is {{the second}} main {{component}} in cocoons, which are removed in the silk reeling process of the raw silk industry and in the <b>silk</b> <b>waste</b> degumming of the spun silk industry. The main amino acid of sericin, serine, exhibits a skin moisturing and antiwrinkle action, which is interesting to use for film formation in this study. The extraction conditions of sericin from two <b>silk</b> <b>wastes,</b> pieced cocoon and inferior knubbs were studied to find the optimum extraction conditions. Boiling water extraction was considered based on the response surface methodology (RSM) {{in order to identify}} the important factors for the sericin extraction. The two factors considered were time and temperature. Both factors were needed to be independent parameters in the predicted equation in order to improve the model fit with R 2 = 0. 84. The components ofextracted sericin were 18. 24 % serine, 9. 83 % aspatate, and 5. 51 % glycine with a molecular weight of 132 kDa. Film formationfrom extracted sericin was carried out to find the optimum conditions. Extracted sericin could not form a stand-alonefilm. Therefore, polysaccharide polymers, such as glucomannan, were incorporated with glycerol to form a flexible film. Sericin-based films were characterized for its properties in terms of solubility and permeability before application. It wasfound that sericin-based films showed a film flexibility and solubility without an increasing film water vapor permeability...|$|R

Hydrogels were obtained directly by dialyzing silk fibroin solutions against frequent changes of water until the gelation point and then lyophilized and characterized in terms of their morphology, crystallinity, thermal resistance and secondary structure.

If the filament of the cocoon can be unwound from it in a continuous fibre, it is 2 ̆ 7 reeled 2 ̆ 7 and known in commerce as 2 ̆ 7 raw 2 ̆ 7 silk [but] [...] . if the cocoon through any cause be pressed, broken or injured so that its filament cannot be 2 ̆ 7 reeled, 2 ̆ 7 then it must be 2 ̆ 7 spun 2 ̆ 7 as characterized by the American Silk Journal. Spun silk was also classed as 2 ̆ 2 waste 2 ̆ 2 and included refuse or product thrown off in the process of reeling. Samuel Lister discovered <b>silk</b> <b>waste</b> by accident in a London warehouse and the owners were happy to sell it for rubbish. 2 ̆ 2 It was neither agreeable to the feel, the smell, nor the touch; but simply a mass of knotty, dirty, impure stuff, full of bits of stick and dead mulberry leaves. 2 ̆ 2 Lister recognized the commercial viability of manufacturing spun silk fabric that could compete in appearance with material from the perfect cocoon...|$|R
40|$|Fiberglass, {{developed}} in the late 1940 s, was the first modern composite and {{is still the most}} common. It makes up about 65 per cent of all the composites produced today and is used for boat hulls, surfboards, sporting goods, swimming pool linings, building panels and car bodies. We may well be using something made of fiberglass without knowing it. Polymer composites are gaining popularity in many industrial applications due to their higher specific strength and module. Now days, the fiber reinforced composites have dramatically come into use. These composites have gained so much recognition because of their processing advantages and good technical properties like strength, density, impact, stiffness, elastic modulus, creep rate, damping. Furthermore, these properties showed considerable improvement with increasing silk fabric content. The <b>waste</b> <b>silk</b> collected from the factory outlets were used to fabricate silk reinforced epoxy composites and various samples were developed with varying silk content. In recent years the natural fiber composites have attracted substantial importance as a potential structural material. The attractive features of glass fiber have been their low cost, light weight, high specific modulus, renewability and biodegradability. Natural composites reinforced with such natural fibers have thus been a subject of intense study for high strength, low cost application in contrast to the synthetic fiber reinforced composite. In the present work “Research Work on Fiber Glass Wool Reinforced and Epoxy Matrix Composite Material ” tests were performed to find tensile strength, density, impact, damping. of the composites for the different variables. The composites were fabricated using Epoxy resin as polymer, Araldite as hardener, Glass fiber as reinforcement. Single and double layer composites were made. They were then experimented in the universal testing machine and more test...|$|R
