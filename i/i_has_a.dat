25|$|Multiple DNA polymerases take on {{different}} {{roles in the}} DNA replication process. In E. coli, DNA Pol III is the polymerase enzyme primarily responsible for DNA replication. It assembles into a replication complex at the replication fork that exhibits extremely high processivity, remaining intact for the entire replication cycle. In contrast, DNA Pol I is the enzyme responsible for replacing RNA primers with DNA. DNA Pol <b>I</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> 5' to 3' exonuclease activity {{in addition to its}} polymerase activity, and uses its exonuclease activity to degrade the RNA primers ahead of it as it extends the DNA strand behind it, in a process called nick translation. Pol I is much less processive than Pol III because its primary function in DNA replication is to create many short DNA regions rather than a few very long regions.|$|E

The 3B20 three-cylinder powerplant has an aluminium cylinder block, a displacement of 659cubic centimetres, and incorporates double overhead camshafts with MIVEC variable valve timing in the cylinder head. Initially only an intercooled and turbocharged engine was offered, until a naturally aspirated version was introduced for 2007. A four-speed automatic gearbox transmits power to the rear or all four wheels, depending on specification.|$|E

50|$|Here, the presupposition {{triggered}} by the expression my wife (that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> wife) is blocked, because it is stated in the antecedent of the conditional: That sentence doesn't imply that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> wife. In the following example, it is not stated in the antecedent, so it is allowed to project, i.e. the sentence does imply that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> wife.|$|R
40|$|Think of {{the most}} boring, uncontroversial case of presupposition {{satisfaction}} you can imagine. I thought of this one: <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> pet hamster. <b>I</b> know that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> hamster. You know that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> hamster. <b>I</b> know that you know, and so forth. I say to you: (1) Tomorrow I’m taking my hamster to the vet. Why was it acceptable for me to utter this sentence, which contains the presuppositional expression my hamster? Presumably it’s because the sentence presupposes that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> hamster; and a sentence with this presupposition is acceptable in any context like the one we’re in, where you and I come into the conversation sharing the belief that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> hamster. It could also be that you didn’t know that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> hamster, but <b>I</b> told you: “I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> hamster. Tomorrow I’m taking my hamster to the vet. ” So then it’s not necessary that we begin the conversation both believing that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> hamster: it’s enough that, before the sentence containing the phrase my hamster is uttered, we both believe that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> hamster. But beliefs are fickle creatures. What happens if I start a sentence, and then something happens in the room while I’m talking? If you and I witness the event, our beliefs will change, and the context changes accordingly. For instance, imagine I say...|$|R
