50|$|The {{central nervous}} system of Pseudunela cornuta is euthyneurous and {{composed}} of the paired cerebral, rhinophoral, optic, pedal, pleural, buccal and <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> ganglia as well as three distinct ganglia on the visceral nerve cord, plus a presumed osphradial ganglion. All ganglia excluding the buccal and <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> ganglia are situated pre-pharyngeally. The {{central nervous system}} is epiathroid; the pleural ganglion is located closer to the cerebral ganglion than to the pedal one. All ganglia consist of an outer cortex containing the nuclei and an inner medulla. The large cerebral ganglia are linked by a robust commissure and lie dorsal to the pedal ganglia. Anteroventrally, the robust labiotentacular nerve emerges innervating the labial tentacle. A rhinophoral ganglion is situated anterodorsally to each cerebral ganglion connected by a short, single cerebro-rhinophoral connective. The rhinophoral nerve arises from the rhinophoral ganglion extending to the rhinophore. A small, unpigmented eye is connected by the thin optic nerve to the rhinophoral nerve, slightly anterior to the rhinophoral ganglion. An optic ganglion is attached laterally to each cerebral ganglion and connected to the latter by a thin nerve. The optic ganglion is surrounded by an additional layer of connective tissue shared with the cerebral ganglion.

50|$|Prolactin {{secretion}} in the pituitary {{is normally}} suppressed by the brain chemical dopamine. Drugs that block {{the effects of}} dopamine at the pituitary or deplete dopamine stores in the brain may cause the pituitary to secrete prolactin. These drugs include the major tranquillizers (phenothiazines), trifluoperazine (Stelazine), and haloperidol (Haldol); antipsychotic medications, such as risperidone and quetiapine; metoclopramide (Reglan), domperidone, cisapride used to treat <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> reflux; medication-induced nausea (such as cancer drugs); and, less often, alpha-methyldopa and reserpine, used to control hypertension; and estrogens and TRH. The sleep drug ramelteon (Rozerem) also {{increases the risk of}} hyperprolactinaemia. A benzodiazepine analog, etizolam, can also increase the risk of hyperprolactinaemia. In particular, the dopamine antagonists metoclopramide and domperidone are both powerful prolactin stimulators and have been used to stimulate breast milk secretion for decades. However, since prolactin is antagonized by dopamine and the body depends on the two being in balance, the risk of prolactin stimulation is generally present with all drugs that deplete dopamine, either directly or as a rebound effect.|$|E
50|$|The paired pedal ganglia lie posteroventrally to the {{cerebral}} ganglia, and are {{connected by a}} commissure which is slightly longer than {{the cerebral}} commissure. A statocyst with a single otolith is attached dorsally to each pedal ganglion. The static nerve could not be detected. Two pedal nerves emerge from each pedal ganglion, one in the anterior and another in the posterior part, both innervating the foot. The pleural ganglion is located posterior to the cerebral ganglion and connected to the latter and the pedal ganglion by short connectives forming the pre-pharyngeal nerve ring. The pleural ganglia are connected by very short connectives to the visceral nerve cord, so that the latter {{is located at the}} very beginning of the pharynx. There are three distinct ganglia on the short visceral nerve cord: the left parietal ganglion, the fused subintestinal/visceral ganglion and the fused right parietal/supraintestinal ganglion. While the left pleuro-parietal, the parietal-subintestinal/visceral and the right pleuro-parietal/supraintestinal connectives are very short, the subintestinal/visceral-parietal/supraintestinal connective is long. An additional presumed osphradial ganglion is linked to the fused parietal/supraintestinal ganglion. Anteriorly, a nerve emerges and innervates the right body wall; no histologically differentiated osphradium could be detected. The buccal ganglia are positioned posterior to the pharynx and are linked to each other by a short buccal commissure ventral to the oesophagus. The thin cerebro-buccal connective emerges anteriorly from each buccal ganglion and was not traceable along the entire length. A smaller <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> ganglion lies dorsally to each buccal ganglion and is connected to the latter by a short connective.|$|E
50|$|The first pair {{of nerves}} come from the {{olfactory}} ganglions, and are large, but of no great length; they divide into several filaments {{as they enter the}} base of the dorsal tentacles. The second pair pass from the under surface of the anterior border of the cerebroid ganglions, not far from their union with the olfactory ganglions; these nerves go to supply the upper surface of the channel of the mouth. The third and fourth pairs of nerves issue from the same ganglions, but considerably behind the second pair; these also go to the channel of the mouth; the third probably sending a branch to the oral tentacles. A strong cord passes off close to the root of the fourth pair: these cords curve round the oesophagus and are united to the outer extremities of the buccal ganglions, forming the anterior collar. The fifth pair of nerves issue apparently from the outer border of the branchial ganglia, and go to the skin {{by the side of the}} head. The sixth pair are small, and come from the upper surface of the branchial ganglions; these nerves go to the skin of the sides of the back. The seventh, much larger than the sixth, emerge from the posterior margin of the same ganglions, and supply the dorsal skin, and apparently likewise the cerata. These are the branchial nerves. The eighth and ninth pairs are large nerves; they issue from the outer border of the pedial ganglions and go to the foot. The posterior margins of these ganglions are united by a stout, shortish commissure, composed of two or three cords, which, passing below the gullet, form the great oesophageal collar. The tenth pair of nerves are given off from the posterior margin of the buccal ganglions; these pass into the buccal mass and go to supply the tongue. The eleventh pair, issuing from the outer extremities of the buccal ganglions, are distributed to the muscles of the buccal mass. The twelfth pair come from the apex of the <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> ganglions, and being applied to the gullet, each divides into two branches, one of which supplies the upper portion of that tube, the other, passing down it, goes to the stomach as in the other nudibranchs. The thirteenth pair are large; these are the hepatic nerves; they issue from the buccal mass and probably (as in genus Aeolidia) are connected at their origin with ganglions, which must be looked upon as belonging to the sympathetic system. Immediately on emerging from the buccal mass, they are connected to the buccal ganglions at their point of union with the gastrooesophageal, and then, arching outwards and upwards, pass from within the anterior oesophageal collar, and go to supply the glands of the cerata.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} QCancer® (<b>Gastro-Oesophageal)</b> for predicting the risk of undiagnosed <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> cancer in an independent UK cohort of patients from general practice records. DESIGN: Open cohort study to validate QCancer® (<b>Gastro-Oesophageal)</b> prediction model. Three hundred sixty-five practices from the United Kingdom contributing to The Health Improvement Network database. 2. 1 million patients registered with a general practice surgery between 01 January 2000 and 30 June 2008, aged 30 - 84 years (3. 7 million person years) with 1766 <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> cancer cases.

40|$|Helicobacter pylori {{is not a}} {{risk factor}} for <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> reflux and oesophagitis, and there are {{arguments}} suggesting that H. pylori may actually protect against <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> reflux disease. <b>Gastro-oesophageal</b> reflux disease patients are less often infected with H. pylori than controls.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Our {{understanding}} of <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> reflux disease has undergone significant changes {{over the last}} century. AIM: To trace the rise in {{understanding of}} <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> reflux disease and highlight remaining areas of uncertainty. METHODS: Literature review. RESULTS: In 1906, Tileston published his observations on 'peptic ulcer of the oesophagus'. Winkelstein, in 1934, first correlated symptoms of heartburn with acid regurgitation and reflux oesophagitis. In 1946, Allison described hiatus hernia as a causal factor {{in the development of}} <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> reflux disease. In 1958, Bernstein and Baker showed a direct relationship between oesophageal acidification and heartburn in patients with <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> reflux disease, irrespective of endoscopic findings, leading to the recognition of non-erosive <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> reflux disease. In the 1980 s, continuous recordings of the lower oesophageal sphincter showed that episodes of reflux were related to transient relaxations of lower oesophageal sphincter tone. There is now increasing recognition that <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> reflux disease arises from the interaction of several anatomical and physiological factors. A turning point in the medical treatment of <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> reflux disease came with the introduction of the first proton pump inhibitor, omeprazole, in 1989.

40|$|SUMMARY The {{association}} between <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> reflux and sleep state in 24 infants with confirmed or suspected <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> reflux was studied by monitoring both the pH {{in the lower}} oesophagus and polygraphic tracings made during sleep at night. <b>Gastro-oesophageal</b> reflux during the night was confirmed in 20 infants. Three hundred and sixteen precipitous drops {{of more than one}} unit of pH were recorded during the studies, 186 during periods of wakefulness. Of 130 drops in pH during sleep, 62 (48 %) began during active sleep and 62 during indeterminate sleep. Of the latter, 56 (90 %) were associated with brief gross body movements.

40|$|Background: The {{natural history}} of <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> reflux disease in Asian {{population}} has not been studied before. Aim: To study the onset and disappearances of reflux symptoms over a 1 -year period in the Chinese population. Methods: A population-based telephone survey was performed in 2002 and repeated 1 year later. The change in prevalence rate, onset and disappearance of <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> reflux disease, and the change in diagnoses were assessed. Factors associated with the onset and disappearance of <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> reflux disease were studied. Results: A total of 712 subjects completed {{the first and second}} survey. The annual, monthly and weekly prevalence of <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> reflux disease were 34. 1 %, 10. 1 % and 2. 7 % respectively. The onset rate (per 1000 person-year) and disappearance rate of any <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> reflux disease and frequent <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> reflux disease (≥ monthly symptoms) were 209, 40; and 395, 243 respectively. Forty-four percentage of <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> reflux disease subjects changed their diagnoses in 2003. By multiple logistic regression analysis, high anxiety score (OR: 1. 2, 95 % CI: 1. 1 - 1. 2) and higher educational level (OR: 2. 7, 95 % CI: 1. 3 - 6. 3) were associated with the onset of gastrooesophageal reflux disease; while the frequency of acid regurgitation (OR: 0. 35, 95 % CI: 0. 17 - 0. 70) and use of antisecretory therapy (OR: 0. 50, 95 % CI: 0. 28 - 0. 89) were associated with the disappearance of gastrooesophageal reflux disease. Conclusion: The prevalence of <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> reflux disease is stable over 1 year. Higher anxiety score and higher educational level were associated with the onset of <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> reflux disease, while lower frequency of reflux symptoms and infrequent use of antisecretory therapy were associated with the disappearance of <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> reflux disease in a Chinese population. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|<b>Gastro-oesophageal</b> reflux {{disease is}} a {{condition}} in which the reflux of gastric contents into the oesophagus provokes symptoms or complications and impairs quality of life. Typical symptoms of <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> reflux disease are heartburn and regurgitation but <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> reflux disease has also been related to extra-oesophageal manifestations, such as asthma, chronic cough and laryngitis. The pathogenesis of <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> reflux disease is multifactorial, involving transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations and other lower oesophageal sphincter pressure abnormalities. As a result, reflux of acid, bile, pepsin and pancreatic enzymes occurs, leading to oesophageal mucosal injury. Other factors contributing to the pathophysiology of <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> reflux disease include hiatal hernia, impaired oesophageal clearance, delayed gastric emptying and impaired mucosal defensive factors. Hiatal hernia contributes to <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> reflux disease by promoting lower oesophageal sphincter dysfunction. Impaired oesophageal clearance is responsible for prolonged acid exposure of the mucosa. Delayed gastric emptying, resulting in gastric distension, can significantly increase the rate of transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations, contributing to postprandial <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> reflux disease. The mucosal defensive factors play an important role against development of <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> reflux disease, by neutralizing the backdiffusion of hydrogen ion into the oesophageal tissue. While the pathogenesis of oesophageal symptoms is now well known, the mechanisms underlying extra-oesophageal airway manifestations are still poorly understood. Two hypotheses have been proposed: direct contact of gastric acid with the upper airway and a vago-vagal reflex elicited by acidification of the distal oesophagus, leading to bronchospasm. In conclusion, <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> reflux disease can be considered {{as the result of a}} complex interplay of factors, all promoting the contact of gastric acidic contents with the oesophageal mucosa, leading to different degrees of oesophageal damage...|$|E
40|$|AIMS: The primary aim was {{to assess}} whether there were {{differences}} in symptoms, laboratory data, and oesophageal pH-metry between infants with primary <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> reflux and those with reflux secondary to cows' milk protein allergy (CMPA). PATIENTS AND METHODS: 96 infants (mean(SD) age 7. 8 (2. 0) months) with either primary <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> reflux, reflux with CMPA, CMPA only, or none of these (controls) were studied. Symptoms, immunochemical data, and oesophageal pH were compared between the four groups {{and the effect of}} a cows' milk protein-free diet on the severity of symptoms was also assessed. RESULTS: 14 out of 47 (30 %) infants with <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> reflux had CMPA. These infants had similar symptoms to those with primary <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> reflux but higher concentrations of total IgE and circulating eosinophils (p < 0. 005) and IgG anti-beta lactoglobulin (p < 0. 003). A progressive constant reduction in oesophageal pH {{at the end of a}} feed, which continued up to the next feed, was seen in 12 out of 14 patients with <b>gastro-oesophageal</b> reflux secondary to CMPA and in 24 of 25 infants with CMPA only.
