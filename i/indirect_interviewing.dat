40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to check the answers of {{respondents}} against the records of a district dispensary of general medical services as well as to analyse the influence of certain traits of respondents (sex, age, occupation and education) upon the accuracy of their answers. The data obtained from interviews conducted in the WHO International Collaborative Study of Medical Care Utilization were used. The checking related only to medical visits which occurred in three time periods: (1) not longer than two weeks before the date of interviewing, (2) from two weeks to one year, (3) more than one year. Data obtained from direct interviews with 524 adults and 111 <b>indirect</b> <b>interviews</b> on children (for whom their parents or foster parents were answering) were used. Two kinds of accordance (“positive” and “negative”), two kinds of discrepancies (overstating, understating) and so called inaccurate answers were distinguished in the analysis. Discrepancies between the answers of respondents and the medical records turned out to be pretty large; the range of differences was, depending on the category of respondents and the period covered, from 8. 8 to 47. 1 percentage points. Positively less answers out of line with reality (i. e. discordant with medical records) were found when the question related to a short time period (i. e. “two weeks ago”); much more when longer time periods were covered. The range of the gross errors, depending on the time period covered, was from 7. 0 to 28. 8 percentage points for direct interviews, and from 6. 3 to 47. 1 for indirect ones. Discrepancies between the data obtained in interviews and the records of medical dispensary are much greater in case of <b>indirect</b> <b>interviews,</b> in which a tendency toward "incomplete” answers (i. e. understating discrepancy) is discernible; a contrary tendency appeared in direct interviews, in which half of the respondents were giving false answers overstating the actual number of visits. Most of the false answers were given by older respondents with elementary – or less than elementary – education level. In these persons there prevailed a tendency to give “overstating” answers. Most of discrepancies of all kinds consisted in the wrong location in time of a visit that actually took place earlier. Time discrepancies ranged from two to six days. It follows from the analysis that least truthful are answers relating to past time periods longer than two weeks before the date of an interview as well as the data obtained from <b>indirect</b> <b>interviews...</b>|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide a basic {{overview}} of the ways art teachers can use drawings (artistic expression) to identify and assist children who are traumatized by abuse. Children's exposure to various forms of abuse in families (physical, emotional and sexual abuse and neglect), and exposure to traditional (bullying) or electronic peer violence (cyberbullying) may result in serious consequences for the child's health, welfare and functioning in life and school. Since abused children have difficulties verbalizing inner emotional states and experiences due to fear, shame, trauma repetition and memory difficulties, artistic expression through symbols can help them externalize cognitively difficult experience and thus reduce the symptoms of trauma and feelings of powerlessness. Knowing the specifics of the abused children's drawings can significantly contribute to the recognition of this problem, and serve as a starting point for the discussions with children about what they wanted to express (<b>indirect</b> <b>interview).</b> However, conclusions should not be made about the possible abuse on the basis of a single drawing, but a series of drawings containing a number of distinctive signs which are complemented by the information obtained through conversation with the child.

In testing the validity of research data used source triangulation and method triangulation. The progress that has been achieved to date in the implementation of tax holiday policy is to provide ease of bureaucracy administration and simplicity of licensing services in investing by improving coordination among government to improve foreign investors' confidence when investing in Indonesia. So technically, the implementation of tax holiday policy is quite effective in attracting foreign direct investment because it can perform the right obligations according to the regulations. In the investment point of view, tax holiday policy is not effective in attracting foreign direct investment or not becoming the main factor of investor's goal in investment. The cause of the ineffectiveness of the tax holiday policy in attracting foreign direct investment in Indonesia is another indicator that becomes an assessment among others the ease of investment licensing, infrastructure, electricity supply, investor protection, minority and tax administration.

This thesis aims to analyze a) the characteristics of individuals {{at risk of being}} underrepresented in surveys {{of older people}}, b) the systematic errors likely to occur {{as a result of these}} selections, and c) whether these systematic errors can be minimized by weighting adjustments.   In Study I, we investigated a) who would be missing from a survey that excluded those living in institutions and that did not use <b>indirect</b> <b>interviews,</b> b) how prevalence rates would be affected by these exclusions, and c) whether post-stratifying the data by sex and age (weighting adjustment) would correct for any systematic measurement error. In Study II, we compared mortality and hospitalization rates in those who responded to a postal questionnaire with rates in the target population. In addition, we tested whether a weighting variable created with a number of auxiliary variables could correct for the differences.   In Study III, we followed a longitudinal cohort sample for 43 years. By recalculating baseline characteristics at each follow-up, we investigated how the sample changed after a) selective mortality and b) survey non-participation. In Study IV, we investigated whether the systematic non-participation that is likely to occur in surveys of older people affects the association between education and health. In sum, the results of these four studies show that people in the oldest age groups, women, those of low socioeconomic position, and those with the poorest health tend to be underrepresented in surveys of older people. This systematic underrepresentation might lead to an underestimation of poor health and function, a bias that is unlikely to be corrected by weighting adjustments, and to an underestimation of health inequality between educational groups. The results also show that the selective mortality that occurs in longitudinal samples might be compounded by selective non-participation among the most disadvantaged groups.

40|$|International audienceCiguatera Fish Poisoning (CFP) is a non-bacterial seafood {{poisoning}} well characterized in {{the remote}} archipelagos of French Polynesia, yet poorly documented in the Society archipelago, most notably on Moorea, the second most populated island in French Polynesia, which counts {{a high proportion of}} fishermen fishing on a regular basis. To address this knowledge gap, a holistic study of the ciguatera issue was conducted on Moorea. First, ciguatera risk was analysed in terms of incidence rate, fish species most commonly involved and risk stratification in Moorea lagoon based on 2007 – 2013 epidemiological data. A mean incidence rate of 8 cases per 10, 000 inhabitants for the study period and an average under-reporting rate of 54 % were found. Taking into account hospitalization and medication fees, and loss of productive days, the health-related costs due to CFP were estimated to be USD $ 1613 and $ 749 for each reported and unreported case, respectively, with an overall cost of USD $ 241, 847 for the study period. Comparison of the present status of CFP on Moorea with a risk map established in the late 1970 ’s showed that the spatial distribution of the risk has stayed relatively stable in time, with the north shore of the island remaining the most prone to ciguatera. Evaluation of the current knowledge on CFP among different populations groups, i. e. fishermen, residents and visitors, was also conducted through direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>interviews.</b> About half of the fishermen interviewed were actually able to identify risky fishing areas. While, overall, the CFP risk perception in the fishing community of Moorea seemed accurate, although not scientifically complete, it was sufficient for the safe practice of their fishing activities. This may be due in part to adaptive responses adopted by 36 % of the fishermen interviewed, such as the avoidance of either high-risk fishing sites or toxic species. At the residents and visitors’ level, the study points out a striking lack of awareness of the CFP issue among visitors, as compared to local residents. Indeed, less than 25 % of Moorea visitors vs. an average of 98 % in residents were aware of CFP or of its presence on the island. Interestingly, evaluation of the fish consumption preferences showed that 70 % of visitors do not consume lagoon fish during their stay, not for fear of CFP, but mainly {{due to the lack of}} availability of these species in recreational facilities or because they have nutritional preference for pelagic fish. This lack of awareness, along with the report by several CFP patients of the consumption of fish species yet banned for sale, stress the need for improved communication efforts on this critical issue among both residents and visitors on Moorea. The implementation of a public outreach strategy is proposed, based on both existing information networks and low-cost communication actions through information displays at various strategic locations, e. g. Tahiti-Faa’a international airport, the ferry boat station, recreational facilities, as well as the major trading points on Moorea Island...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{begins with}} Leavitt&# 039;s (2007) premise that {{business}} schools do not forewarn their {{students of the}} realities of working life. Even for those with "successful" careers, it comprises both rewards and disappointments. It is argued that relationships at work are central to those rewards and disappointments and can help or hinder individuals in bringing their best selves to the tasks required of them. The intent of the thesis is to describe the intrapersonal experience of these realities of working life using a relational lens. The thesis {{is based on a}} multi-paradigm inquiry and comprises three studies. Initially, a functionalist study using survey research methods was conducted to select research participants. An interpretive study followed. It involved the use of direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>interview</b> methods for accessing the personal, lived experience of ten participants. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the applicability of Josselson&# 039;s (1992) multidimensional model of relatedness for the workplace. The model is concerned with identifying the range of relational needs people have of one another and the affective consequences of those needs being met or not. It potentially addresses the gap in the literature of a relational framework that integrates motivational and emotional factors, as well as the more commonly researched cognitive factors. The study found support for the application of Josselson&# 039;s model to the workplace, modified to include the task system. The third study was an interpretive study involving a re-analysis of the interview data as a series of case studies. The analytic approach incorporated clinical, psychoanalytic concepts and Josselson&# 039;s model as organising frameworks. Consideration of the organisational context was included as part of this study. This involved a smaller functionalist study using survey research methods. This third study illustrates that compromising for a job and a career is an ordinary and pervasive experience. It is argued that dignity and hope in the face of such compromise is important for managing the assaults on identity that inevitably result. The research describes the multiple ways that dignity is denied and preserved at work for each participant. It shows that each participant attempts to trade-off his/her particular experience of indignity in an attempt to experience work as dignified overall. It highlights that positive leader-member relations are critical for this experience. The nature of these positive leader-member relations is discussed drawing on intersubjective theory (e. g. Benjamin, 1988; Orange, 2007). It is argued that they involve mutual recognition rather than the complementary relations of the master-slave dialectic. In this study, only those in a low quality relationship with their appointed leader experience the indignity of being denied the opportunity to pursue their own career aspirations. It is the one indignity that could not be traded-off. It is a form of misrecognition by the leader that denies the individual the possibility of becoming who he/she wants to be in the organisational context. In this study, it is the knowledge that the opportunity is there, not taking it up, that matters for dignity as it provides career-related hope...|$|R

As such, recent studies have proposed alternative ways of judging veracity in order to increase accuracy. In the current study, researchers examined whether indirect methods of detecting lies led to more accurate judgements of veracity than direct methods. 40 participants viewed a number of video clips in which the speaker was either lying or being truthful. Participants were either directly asked to detect liars in the video clips or they were asked to identify individuals whose behaviour, mannerisms or speech patterns changed throughout the <b>interview</b> (<b>indirect</b> methods). It was presumed that participants using the indirect methods of lie detection would be significantly more accurate at judging veracity than those who were explicitly looking for liars. However, upon analysis of the research, although those in the indirect methods condition were more accurate, no statistically significant findings were found between the two conditions. Therefore, a different method of judging veracity is required in order to increase accuracy. Keywords: deception detection, indirect methods, direct methods, accuracy, veracity judgement...|$|R

Although market chains of live bird trade have been studied through <b>indirect</b> means including <b>interviews</b> and questionnaires, direct methods have not been used to identify movements of individual poultry. To bridge the knowledge gap on quantitative movement and transportation of poultry, we introduced a novel approach for applying telemetry to document domestic duck movements from source farms at Poyang Lake, China. We deployed recently developed transmitters that record Global Positioning System (GPS) locations and send them through the Groupe Spécial Mobile (GSM) cellular telephone system. For the first time, we were able to track individually marked ducks from 3 to 396 km from their origin to other farms, distribution facilities, or live bird markets. Our proof of concept test showed that the use of GPS-GSM transmitters may provide direct, quantitative information to document the movement of poultry and reveal their market chains. Our findings provide an initial indication of the complexity of source-market network connectivity and highlight the great potential for future telemetry studies in poultry network analyses...|$|R

The purpose of this case study was to identify effective strategies used by retail store managers that lead to employee commitment to increase business performance. The study population was 8, 230 retail store managers in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area. The conceptual framework for this study was the Meyer and Allen 3 -component model of commitment. Participants were purposefully selected for their knowledge, experience and success in implementing effective retention strategies. Data were collected via face-to-face semistructured <b>interviews,</b> <b>indirect</b> participant observations, and archival document reviews with 5 retail store managers. The data analysis process involved organizing the interviews, color coding themes, and using NVivo software to interpret the data. Three themes emerged: Employee engagement increased employee commitment to the organization, managers decreased employee turnover by taking a personal interest in employees, and employee empowerment increased organizational commitment. Increasing employee commitment contributes to social change by providing organizational managers and leaders with important insights. Enhancing employee commitment contributes to society through increased organizational profitability resulting from improved retention strategies...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to gain a better understanding, through {{qualitative}} exploration, of the ways in which social influence affects the decision to start bicycling in England. ‘Social influence’ is defined as the process by which an individual’s thoughts and actions are changed by the thoughts and action of others. Its role was investigated at three levels: the immediate family, household members and significant others (direct social influence); the extended family, friends, peers and colleagues (less direct social influence); and the wider cultural context (<b>indirect</b> social influence). <b>Interviews</b> with 61 individuals living in 12 towns and cities across England were analysed. Half of the interviewees were new regular bicyclists and the other half did not bicycle at all, or only occasionally. Social influence was found to be the dominant factor for a minority of the cases where participants started bicycling regularly. It played a role alongside other factors in other cases. It could take the form of direct influence from family, friends and peers or indirect influence from the social and cultural context. The analysis illustrates the difficulty of capturing social influence which is often hidden and emerges incidentally in the course of the interviews and interacts with other contributing factors. The role of social influence found in this research challenges the rational approach to explaining travel decision making that has traditionally dominated transport studies. The paper suggests that social processes could be harnessed to improve the efficacy of bicycling promotion programs...|$|R

The form of the research is qualitative descriptive. The research uses a holistic approach which places the form of the dance or its sensation as the objective factor, the concept or idea which symbolizes as the genetic factor, and the response or emotion of the audience as the affective factor in an interactive communicative study. The research places each factor in an equal position as a data source and in the activity of the analysis. The theories used for researching the Kukila dance are: (1) Theories of Aesthetics; (2) Theories of Performing Arts; (3) Theories of Symbolism; and (4) Theories of Communication. The methods used by the writer for collecting the data include: a library study, direct and <b>indirect</b> observation, and <b>interviews</b> with a number of informants. The conclusions drawn, based on the form, symbols, and emotions of the audience, are that aesthetically, the Kukila dance depicts a friendship between two kinds of birds which are agile, lively, and vivacious in character, while it functions as entertainment and can be interpreted as having content which is meaningful for character building. In its implementation, the form of the Kukila dance is expressed through the performance of presentative and representative movements which are agile, lively, and vivacious,and supported by make-up and costumes resembling the appearance of a bird, as well as dynamic music, creating a sense of harmony in a high quality work of art. The Kukila dance is essentiallya popular dance which is often learned by children in elementary school and junior high school. Keywords: Kukila dance, aesthetic, and character buildin...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the thesis is to study how contacts/relationships are established in prison, and whether this is of significance for co-offending. A further objective is that of studying co-offending among individuals classified as gang members. Data have been collected from the Register of Suspected Offenders for all individuals released from Swedish prisons {{over a period of}} six months (n= 3, 930). Data have also been collected for individuals deemed by prison service officials to be members of various gangs (n= 1, 310). Twelve individuals (four women and eight men) with experience of serving time in prison have been interviewed. The results of the register study show that it is uncommon for individuals who have spent time together at the same prison to be suspected of committing offences together subsequent to release. This was the case for two percent of the entire study population and three percent of the gang members. The co-offending of different gangs has also been studied by means of network analysis. There are substantial variations between different gangs as regards the proportion of suspected offences involving gang members and other individuals respectively, as reflected in both direct and <b>indirect</b> links. The <b>interview</b> study shows that there are different reasons for wanting to establish contacts/relationships with others. For some the intention is to maintain contacts of value for future crimes. A number of different reasons emerged however for why such contacts are discontinued. Inmates return to their old friends, they are re-arrested, women find themselves back in the worlds of men, a long time may pass between the individuals’ respective release dates, they may live a long way apart or drug use, leading to the breakdown of contacts as a result. The theoretical framework employed in the thesis proceeds from social exchange theory. For co-offending to take place subsequent to release from prison, the contact/relationship established in prison must be worth something. Trust, contacts with other criminals, the size of an individual’s criminal network, and criminal capital are all relevant in this context...|$|R
40|$|Much of {{the work}} {{exploring}} video-enhanced alternatives to traditional methods employed {{in teaching and learning}} has examined the provision of learning materials to scaffold the learning experience; there are case studies which have investigated the use of instructional tutorial videos, and more recently emerging pockets of work have explored the use of video to present learners with generic feedback in response to summative assessment. While integrated approaches with the potential to inform the development of video-based strategies currently remain under-represented in the literature, the award-winning VELOCITy strategy interweaves three strands of video-based activity to form a coordinated, holistic approach to the integration of video technologies within an overarching framework. This paper presents findings from doctoral research underpinning the development of the VELOCITy strategy, exploring how asynchronous video technologies were leveraged to enhance learner engagement on an undergraduate course in the Informatics department of a UK HEI, and examining how key elements from these video-enhanced learning opportunities combined to form an integrated pedagogic strategy. A design-based research methodology, incorporating aspects of Mayer’s Multimedia Theory of Learning and Laurillard’s Conversational Framework, provided the backdrop for an integrated series of projects in which learners engaged with video-technologies. Three phases of video-based activities saw the learning experience first scaffolded by a series of instructional tutorials embedded within an e-portfolio system, and then supported and nurtured through an approach to the provision of video-based formative feedback situated within a conversational framework. Concurrently, learners documented the development of a portfolio of work using short video-diary entries, reporting on their progress by reflecting on the development of personal and technical competencies as part of the personal development planning process, and culminating in a summative, reflective self-assessment of achievement over an academic year. A mixed methods approach to data collection and analysis was employed; primarily qualitative data were collected using online surveys, direct and <b>indirect</b> observation, semi-structured <b>interviews</b> and focus groups, and analysis conducted using a combination of thematic coding and direct interpretation. The validity of the findings was further strengthened using methodological triangulation which focused on an analysis of further data derived from online surveys, server logs, the results of the NSS survey, and records of academic achievement. The findings suggest that VELOCITy promotes deeper learner engagement with the assessment and feedback process, facilitates greater opportunities for reflexive learning, and offers the potential for improved rates of learner satisfaction and retention...|$|R

Zainteresirana javnost često izražava protivljenje projektu zbog mogućeg nepovoljnog utjecaja na okoliš i zdravlje ljudi, zato što smatra da nije utjecala na donošenje odluke već je samo bila informirana, što je i razlog nepovjerenja u postupak. U ovome radu analizirane su moguće razlike u informiranju i sudjelovanju zainteresirane javnosti između javnih rasprava u donošenju odluka kod prostornih planova i javnih rasprava u donošenju odluka kod studija utjecaja na okoliš. Kao metode za prikupljanja empirijskog materijala korišteni su problemski usmjeren, dubinski intervju i sudjelujuće promatranje. U analizi empirijskog materijala korištena je utemeljena teorija s inicijalnim, aksijalnim i selektivnim kodiranjem. Kvantifikacija kvalitativnog empirijskog materijala i pretvaranja u numerički oblik izvršena je paketom obrade STATISTICA, Ver. 11. 00. Korištena je deskriptivna statistika, gdje je izračunata učestalost, apsolutna i relativna kumulativna vrijednost svakog kodiranog odgovora. Slijedom dobivenih rezultata primijenjena je parametrijska analiza razlika ANOVA s {{post hoc}} analizom Tukey HSD testa te diskriminativna analiza. Temeljem rezultata istraživanja utvrđeno je da postoje značajne razlike u informiranju i sudjelovanju zainteresirane javnosti u procesima javnih rasprava o prostornim planovima i javnih rasprava o studijama utjecaja na okoliš. Rezultati istraživanja predstavljaju polazište za daljnja istraživanja s aspekta informacijskih i komunikacijskih znanosti. Public informing and {{participation}} in the processes of assessing the effects on the environment is becoming the new paradigm in environmentalism - the concerned public changes the social legitimacy of policies and sees as acceptable only those that have the approval of all parties involved. A project can be deemed unacceptable if the concerned public sees a potentially harmful effect on human health or the environment, or if it believes {{that it was not}} given the opportunity to affect the decision-making process and was only informed (which is often the source of scepticism). Public participation in the treatment of environmental issues and access to information is not an environmental standard in Croatia, but sets the rules for public availability of information that is handled by public institutions, as well as for public participation in certain processes related to giving out permits. The international legal framework dealing with access to information, public participation in policy-making, and the involvement of the justice system is detailed in the 1998 Aarhus Convention. By ratifying the Convention, a state obliges itself to make information related to environmental issues freely available to the public, as well as to make public participation in related policy-making and access to the justice system possible. In order for this to be achieved, the public has to be aware, informed, and involved in decision-making processes. Scientific research methods were used in this paper to analyse the possible differences in public informing and participation between public debates on policies related to spatial planning and those related to environmental impact assessment. The aim {{of the study was to}} determine how information {{and participation in}} public debates on spatial planning in a community affects the understanding of the issues which emerge in the later stage of assessing the environmental impact of a particular project. The research material consisted of two dependent variables, which were defined according to target and sector group, and thirty-six independent variables, which were defined by the 36 questions in the questionnaire and divided into 6 thematic groups. 1. Sustainable development in the plan-making and decision-making processes related to spatial planning on a local level; 2. Public participation and access to information and data in the spatial planning process; 3. Parties involved in the system of informing and public participation in the processes of environmental impact assessment; 4. Reliability of information and the quality of environmental impact studies; 5. Methods of public participation and informing in the process of environmental impact assessment; 6. Taking into account public opinion and that of other parties involved in the policy-making process. Participants were chosen based on the following criteria: a purposive, non-random sample for an empirical study consisting of those considered to be the concerned public in the processes relevant to the study due to their professional or voluntary involvement. The sample consisted of 100 people. The participants were divided into 10 subsamples (target groups) which were qualitatively defined to include 10 people each. Three new control sectors (clusters) were qualitatively defined based on the ten subsamples. The following methods were used to collect empirical data: 1. A problem-driven, in-depth interview - structurally, an open or <b>indirect</b> <b>interview.</b> Both standardised and non-standardised interviews were conducted with the 100 participants divided into 10 target groups. 2. Participant observation - sequential analysis was used to gain insight into social changes through several periods of time or sequences. The following were used in the analysis of empirical data: 1. Grounded theory: open or initial coding, axial coding, selective coding. Final analysis and the categorisation of key terms allowed for the construction of a conceptual matrix within an integrated theoretical framework. 2. Quantification of qualitative empirical data and its transformation into a numerical form in order to be subjected to further statistical analysis were performed using the STATISTICA software package, ver. 11. 00. Descriptive statistics was used to determine the frequency and absolute and relative cumulative value of every coded answer. The results were then subjected to parametric ANOVA variance analysis, with post-hoc analysis of the Turkey HSD test, and discriminant analysis. Descriptive analysis revealed the frequency of every coded variable assigned to each question, as well as their absolute and relative cumulative values. 3. PESTEL analysis and SWOT analysis - based on the results of the qualitative and quantitative processing of empirical data, both PESTEL and SWOT analyses were conducted. The results of the study showed that there were significant differences in information access and participation in the public debate processes dealing with spatial planning and environmental impact studies. Differences of statistical significance between the participants classified as belonging to previously defined control groups were not registered in the cases of only 5 coded variables out of the 36 used in the entire study. Out of 12 discriminant functions, statistically significant differences between previously defined sector groups were registered in the case of 9. The overall result of the PESTEL analysis was negative, while SWOT analysis of all the thematic groups and all the empirical data has shown that the weaknesses override the strengths, as well as that the threats override the opportunities, contributing to a limitation strategy. Statistically significant differences were registered between participants assigned to different target groups in the case of 11 out of 12 coded variables for the first and second thematic group (those related to spatial planning). Discriminant analysis of the results related to these two thematic groups has registered statistic significance between sector groups in the case of 3 out of 4 discriminant functions. SWOT analyses of the first and second thematic group have shown that the weaknesses override the strengths and that the threats override the opportunities, contributing to a limitation strategy. The result of the PESTEL analysis was positive. The informing and involvement of the concerned public in the public debate processes related to spatial planning are both at a low level, amounting to consulting and tokenism. Communication models present in the first two thematic groups are the public information model and the two-way asymmetrical model. The models of non-public and latent public can be used to describe the level of public involvement in policy-making related to spatial planning. In the case of non-public and latent public, the level of participation is very low and inefficient, the lack of information on the process of spatial planning results in a decreased interest in the problem and the public is not aware of its relation to other concerned groups. When looking at the level of activity the public shows in the policy-making processes related to spatial planning, the models of an apathetic public and an all-issue public can be registered. Statistically significant differences were registered between participants assigned to different target groups in the case of 20 out of 24 coded variables for the thematic groups 3 to 6 (those related to environmental impact assessment). Discriminant analysis of the results related to these two thematic groups has registered statistic significance between sector groups in the case of 6 out of 8 discriminant functions. The overall result of the PESTEL analysis was negative, while SWOT analysis of the thematic groups 3 to 6 has shown that the strengths override the weaknesses and that the threats override the opportunities, contributing to a maintenance strategy. The informing and involvement of the concerned public in the public debate processes related to environmental impact assessment are both at a low level, amounting to pacification and tokenism. The communication models present in the thematic groups 3 to 6 is the two-way asymmetrical model. The models of active public and informed public can be used to describe the level of public involvement in policy-making related to environmental impact assessment. When looking at the level of activity the public shows in the policy-making processes related to environmental impact, two types can be registered. The first is that of the single-issue public, one that is only concerned with a single issue or several smaller, but related issues. The single-issue public is not against the process itself, but against particular activities that go against its stances on a certain problem. The second is that of the hot issue public, one that becomes involved after the single-issue public, but only if many representatives of the all-issue public are present and if the particular activity has attracted significant media attention. The results of this study are a sort of novum, as they introduce and provide a starting point for further research in the fields of information and communication sciences and public relations on the interdisciplinary topic of information access and public participation in the processes of debate related to spatial planning and environmental impact assessment...|$|R
