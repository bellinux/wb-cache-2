5|$|Under Smith, 1st Battalion emplaced on hills {{overlooking}} the road into Chochiwon, resting {{the night of}} July 11 with no contact from the North Koreans until the next day. Just after dawn on July 12, the American battalion first encountered North Korean patrols followed by an attack on their left flank by a North Korean force estimated as battalion sized at 0930. Soon afterward, some 2,000 North Koreans began a direct assault on 1st Battalion's position, supported by heavy artillery. Stephens decided the understrength battalion, with its large percentage of replacements, could not hold its position long and ordered it to withdraw. Smith subsequently moved the battalion from the line one company {{at a time and}} the retreat was orderly. By nightfall, the entire regiment had moved by truck to a blocking position at Taepyong-ni, across the Kum River close to Taejon. In the meantime, U.S. forces on the westerly Kongju road fought a series of minor engagements to delay North Korean forces traveling <b>down</b> <b>that</b> <b>road</b> before retreating across the Kum river.|$|E
500|$|Steve Giergerich of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch {{felt that}} Sarah and Little Bee are both [...] "so richly drawn that the {{supporting}} characters suffer by comparison." [...] These supporting characters are Andrew, Sarah's husband, Lawrence, her lover, Clarissa her colleague and Charlie, her four-year-old son, who {{for much of}} the novel answers only to [...] "Batman" [...] and dresses only in his Batman costume. Sarah Liss of CBC News deemed Andrew and Lawrence the two least-likeable characters in the novel, describing Andrew as [...] "an ordinary guy with self-righteous beliefs who comes up slightly short when he's tested by real life" [...] and Lawrence as a [...] "cowardly yes-man". Cleave agreed that for Lawrence, [...] "career and propriety are more important than basic morality. He's gone so far <b>down</b> <b>that</b> <b>road</b> that he can't come back, and he's made more villainous for all the things he could do but doesn't." [...] Charlie is based on Cleave's oldest son, who similarly spent six months aged four answering only to [...] "Batman". He forms the emotional centre of the novel, holding the adult characters together, and is a study in the early formation of identity. Cleave explained: [...] "Little Bee is a novel about where our individuality lies – which layers of identity are us, and which are mere camouflage. So it's a deliberate choice to use the metaphor of a child who is engaging in his first experiments with identity – in Charlie's case by taking on the persona of a superhero." ...|$|E

Give him to us.... Then we will try [...] and give him to you...." [...] "You have a pastor too. ... You give us that one and we'll work with our judiciary and give back yours." [...] The Federal judiciary alone determines extradition cases in the U.S. An August 2017 decree gave Erdogan authority to approve the exchange of detained or convicted foreigners with people held in other countries. Asked about the suggested swap on September 28, 2017, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said: [...] "I can’t imagine that we would go <b>down</b> <b>that</b> <b>road.</b> ...

2500|$|Also in April, Michael Keaton entered {{talks to}} play a villain, but dropped out of discussions shortly {{thereafter}} due to scheduling conflicts with The Founder. He soon reentered talks for the role after a change in schedule for that film, and closed the deal in late May. In June, Michael Barbieri was cast {{as a friend of}} Parker's, Kenneth Choi was cast as Parker's high school principal, and Logan Marshall-Green was cast as another villain alongside Keaton's character, while Donald Glover and Martin Starr joined the cast in undisclosed roles. Watts said that he wanted the cast to reflect Queens as [...] "one of [...] most diverse places in the world", with Feige adding that [...] "we want everyone to recognize themselves in every portion of our universe. [...] especially, it really feels like this is absolutely what has to happen and continue." [...] This is also different from the previous films, which Feige described as being [...] "set in a lily-white Queens". Additionally, Marvel made a conscious decision to mostly avoid including or referencing characters who appeared in previous Spider-Man films, outside of major ones like Peter and May Parker, and Flash Thompson. This included The Daily Bugle, with co-producer Eric Hauserman Carroll saying, [...] "We toyed with it for a while, but again, we didn’t want to go <b>down</b> <b>that</b> <b>road</b> right away, and if we do do a Daily Bugle, we want {{to do it in a}} way that feels contemporary." [...] This also included the character Mary Jane Watson, but Zendaya's Michelle was eventually given the initials [...] "MJ" [...] as a nod to that character. Feige said that the point of this is [...] "to have fun with [...] while at the same time having it be different characters that can provide a different dynamic." ...|$|E

Then {{he took out}} his watch, a great, old-fashioned German silver thing as big as a turnip, and looked at it, with his eyebrows gathered together and a little impatient shrug of his shoulders. I realised that this was his way of respectfully protesting against the unnecessary delay, and sank back in the carriage, merely motioning him to proceed. He started off rapidly, as if {{to make up for lost}} time. Every now and then the horses seemed to throw up their heads and sniffed the air suspiciously. On such occasions I often looked round in alarm. The road was pretty bleak, for we were traversing a sort of high, wind-swept plateau. As we drove, I saw a road that looked but little used, and which seemed to dip through a little, winding valley. It looked so inviting that, even at the risk of offending him, I called Johann to stop--and when he had pulled up, I told him I would like to drive <b>down</b> <b>that</b> <b>road.</b> He made all sorts of excuses, and frequently crossed himself as he spoke. This somewhat piqued my curiosity, so I asked him various questions. He answered fencingly, and repeatedly looked at his watch in protest. Finally I said: ...|$|E

And up the steps and on to the porch jumps the disrespectable Indian. The lamp in the hall shines on him, and I fail to recognize Mr. J. T. Little Bear, alumnus of the class of '91. What I see is a Cherokee brave, and the warpath is what he has been travelling. Firewater and other things have got him going. His buckskin is hanging in strings, and his feathers are mixed up like a frizzly hen's. The dust of miles is on his moccasins, and the light in his eye is the kind the aborigines wear. But in his arms he brings that kid, his eyes half closed, with his little shoes dangling and one hand fast around the Indian's collar.|$|E

If he is a Frenchman he is only too happy to explain his ideas and methods. Here, he will point out, is a little difference between the German trench beyond the wood since yesterday. For a number of reasons he thinks that will be a new machine gun emplacement; here at the centre of the farm wall they have been making another. This battery here--isn't it plain? Well, it's a dummy. The grass in front of it hasn't been scorched, and there's been no serious wear on the road here for a week. Presently the Germans will send one or two waggons up and <b>down</b> <b>that</b> <b>road</b> and instruct them to make figures of eight to imitate scorching on the grass in front of the gun.

It was managed by my old friend Espado; he was the bright-clad fop, whose hook nose got him called the Vulture. Posing {{as a sort of}} philanthropist at the front, he felt his way through the English Army, and at last got his fingers on its one corrupt man--please God!--and that man at the top. St. Clare was in foul need of money, and {{mountains}} of it. The discredited family doctor was threatening those extraordinary exposures that afterwards began and were broken off; tales of monstrous and prehistoric things in Park Lane; things done by an English Evangelist that smelt like human sacrifice and hordes of slaves. Money was wanted, too, for his daughter's dowry; for to him the fame of wealth was as sweet as wealth itself. He snapped the last thread, whispered the word to Brazil, and wealth poured in from the enemies of England. But another man had talked to Espado the Vulture as well as he. Somehow the dark, grim young major from Ulster had guessed the hideous truth; and when they walked slowly together <b>down</b> <b>that</b> <b>road</b> towards the bridge Murray was telling the general that he must resign instantly, or be court-martialled and shot. The general temporised with him till they came to the fringe of tropic trees by the bridge; and there by the singing river and the sunlit palms (for I can see the picture) the general drew his sabre and plunged it through the body of the major." ...|$|E
