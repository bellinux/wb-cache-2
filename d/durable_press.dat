The tensile strength of <b>durable</b> <b>press</b> finished cotton fabrics is significantly reduced as a result of the crosslinking process. In this research, we investigated the effects of acid degradation and crosslinking of cellulose on the mechanical strength of the cotton fabric crosslinked with polycarboxylic acids, and evaluated various factors influencing the mechanical strength of <b>durable</b> <b>press</b> finished cotton fabrics. The strength loss caused by acid degradation is irreversible. The magnitude of fabric strength loss is affected by the temperature and time of the exposure, the concentration of the acid applied to the fabric, the dissociation constant of the acid, and the pH of the acid solution applied to the fabric. Crosslinking of cellulose with a polycarboxylic acid causes a reversible loss in fabric strength. The magnitude of the fabric strength loss increases as the degree of crosslinking increases. In order to optimize the mechanical strength of crosslinked cotton fabrics, it is necessary to minimize the acid-catalyzed depolymerization by controlling the finish bath pH and the curing conditions.

40|$|In this study, {{the effects}} of {{differential}} foam application of <b>durable</b> <b>press</b> (DP) and fluorochemical (FC) finishes to cotton fabrics were investigated. Two different degrees of preparatory finishing of 100 % cotton print cloth were evaluated: bleach-ing only (BL), and bleaching followed by caustic mercerization and liquid ammonia treatment (BL-CM/AT). The two pretreated fabrics were finished separately by one-and two-sided foam applications at 25 % wet pick-up with various levels of FC (0 75, 1. 00, and 1. 25 %) and fixed DMDHEU resin (4. 00 %) add-on, and at 21 % wet pick-up with 1. 00 % FC/ 3. 80 % DMDHEU add-on. Performance properties (water and oil repellency, wrinkle recovery, and <b>durable</b> <b>press</b> appearance rating) of foam finished cotton fabrics were examined. One-sided foam application of FC and DP finishes resulted in excellent water and oil repellency on the applied side while leaving the nonapplied side absorbent. At the same time similar <b>durable</b> <b>press</b> properties were obtained on both sides. At corre-sponding chemical add-ons with the one-sided foam application technique, the com-bination pretreatment (BL-CM/AT) resulted in slightly higher water and oil repellency values.

40|$|<b>Durable</b> <b>press</b> {{finishing}} {{processes are}} generally {{used in the}} textile industry to produce wrinkle-free fabrics and garments.

The scanning electron microscopy was used to verify the presence of the TiO 2 on the cotton fabric before and after the laundering. We conclude that with BTCA, more TiO 2 nanoparticles remain on the fabric surface. It was shown that the UV protection of treated fabric using BTCA as a binder is lower than treated fabric only with TiO 2 nanoparticles. ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the mechanical and <b>durable</b> <b>press</b> properties of cotton woven apparels by applying nano-technology. Cotton fiber is an important material in the textile industry. However, its poor smoothness performance after laundering has caused {{a major problem in}} its application. <b>Durable</b> <b>press</b> finishing process can increase wrinkle resistance but also induce deleterious loss in mechanical strength in treated fabric due to the rigid cross-linking formed on the other hand. Nano-sized polymeric particles have been synthesized and characterized to solve this problem. A core-shell structure has been observed in the particles with functional polymer on the surface. Nano-particles exhibit functional groups such as hydroxyl and carboxylic groups will react with hydroxyl groups present in the cellulosic fiber. After curing, those particles will form a film on the fabric surface which then will help to impart the mechanical strengths. The fabric treatment process is optimized by varying different parameters such as the proportion of cross-linking reagent and catalyst as well as the curing temperature and duration time. Results indicated that application of nano-particles will improve the tensile, tearing strength as well as the abrasion resistance of the treated fabric. Both tensile and tearing strength retentions are increased by at least 20 % when compared with native fabric. Rheological studies provided useful information for the particles under shear. Shearing thickening effect indicated the formation of clusters for the particles under shear. Optical rheological result suggested that fabric treatment with nano-particles should be not done under vigorous stirring in order to prevent agglomeration of particles...|$|E
