5|$|The {{thunderstorm}} {{that would}} eventually produce the infamous F3tornado in <b>Fort</b> <b>Worth</b> developed from a cluster of storms that formed west of the city. At 4:38p.m. CST (22:38UTC), a severe thunderstorm warning was issued on the quickly organizing storm for Parker County. About an hour later, another severe thunderstorm warning was issued, this time for Tarrant County, as the storm continued to track eastward. Radar imagery showed that the supercell was rapidly organizing, developing a bounded weak echo region and hook echo—radar signatures that hint at a strong and potentially tornadic thunderstorm—in less than a half-hour. Radar also indicated that a broad mesocyclone had developed by around 6:00p.m. CST (00:00 UTC), extending vertically through {{the entirety of the}} supercell. At around the same time, a wall cloud was spotted in association with the rotating thunderstorm while baseball-sized hail fell ahead of the rotation in northern <b>Fort</b> <b>Worth</b> along Interstate 820. Winds from the downdraft of another small thunderstorm south of <b>Fort</b> <b>Worth</b> allowed the strengthening supercell to organize further. At 6:10p.m. (00:10UTC), a tornado warning was issued for Tarrant County, and accordingly emergency sirens were activated in the <b>Fort</b> <b>Worth</b> a minute later.|$|E
