5|$|Clearly, {{some sort}} of {{flexible}} bag was required to contain an explosive gel so {{that it did not}} matter how the bomb landed on the target. However, a flexible bag is hard to throw and trials had not been at all satisfactory. Discussions of the problem in Macrae's office were overheard by Gordon Norwood, a master printer who Macrae had recruited from his former magazine publishing employer, but he was not directly working on the weapon. Norwood suggested that what was needed was a <b>frangible</b> container and to the annoyance of the War Office store keeper he obtained a 150 W light bulb with which to demonstrate his point: a spherical glass flask inside a sock of woven wool is rigid when thrown, but on contact the glass breaks and the bomb deforms to the required shape. Experiments with glass flasks filled with cold porridge confirmed that this was the way to go. The grenade needed a delay for the thrower to get clear, so the woollen sock was covered in a sticky substance ensuring that the bomb stayed in place for a few seconds before detonating. Having covered the bomb in glue, a non-sticky handle was required. In the handle, a delay fuse was ignited by releasing a sprung lever so that a five second time delay starts as the grenade leaves the thrower's hand (just like the levers found on a conventional Mills bomb type hand grenade).|$|E

They also ordered a study on the “feasibility of building a <b>frangible</b> ILS antenna array for LaGuardia Airport” Further, they ordered a review of Fokker F28-4000 passenger safety briefing cards [...] "to ensure that they clearly and accurately depict the operation of the two types of forward cabin doors in both their normal and emergency modes and that they describe clearly and accurately how to remove the overwing emergency exit and cover." ...|$|E
2500|$|RP-63G [...] "Pinball" [...] "Dedicated" [...] flying targets which {{included}} two prototypes (43-11723 and 11724) and 30 production aircraft that incorporated a flush dorsal inlet but, more significantly, lights {{that would come}} on when the target was struck with <b>frangible</b> munitions. In 1948, the remaining RP-63Gs were redesignated QF-63Gs.|$|E
2500|$|Its main use in American {{service was}} the unusual {{one of a}} manned flying target for gunnery practice. [...] The {{aircraft}} was generally painted bright orange to increase its visibility. All armament and the regular armor was removed from these RP-63 aircraft, and over a ton of armored sheet metal {{was applied to the}} aircraft. This was fitted with sensors that would detect hits, and these hits were signaled by illuminating a light in the propeller hub where the cannon would have been. This earned the aircraft the unofficial nickname of Pinball. Special <b>frangible</b> rounds made of a lead/Bakelite combination were developed that would disintegrate upon impact. [...] These were known as the [...] "Cartridge, Caliber [...]30, <b>Frangible,</b> Ball, M22". In 1990, veteran Pinball pilot, Ivan L. Hickman, wrote Operation Pinball about the training flights.|$|E
6000|$|... 156. There is, first, work in baked clay, which {{contracts}} as it dries, and is {{very easily}} <b>frangible.</b> Then you must put no work into it requiring niceness in dimension, nor any so elaborate {{that it would be}} a great loss if it were broken, but as the clay yields at once to the hand, and the sculptor can do anything with it he likes, it is a material for him to sketch with and play with,--to record his fancies in, before they escape him--and to express roughly, for people who can enjoy such sketches, what he has not time to complete in marble. The clay, being ductile, lends itself to all softness of line; being easily <b>frangible,</b> it would be ridiculous to give it sharp edges, so that a blunt and massive rendering of graceful gesture will be its natural function; but as it can be pinched, or pulled, or thrust in a moment into projection which it would take hours of chiselling to get in stone, it will also properly be used for all fantastic and grotesque form, not involving sharp edges. Therefore, what is true of chalk and charcoal, for painters, is equally true of clay, for sculptors; they are all most precious materials for true masters, but tempt the false ones into fatal license; and to judge rightly of terra-cotta work is a far higher reach of skill in sculpture-criticism than to distinguish the merits of a finished statue.|$|E
60|$|Forester and Marco {{walked on}} {{until they came}} to the school-house. Thomas got to the school-house before them, and went in. Forester and Marco passed on and went through the gate. They then went on beyond the gate a little way till they came to a pair of bars. Marco took down all but the topmost bar, and Forester, stooping down, passed under. Marco {{attempted}} to do the same; but forgetting that he had a knapsack upon his back, he did not stoop low enough, and gave his knapsack such a knock as almost threw him down. Fortunately there was nothing <b>frangible</b> inside, and so no damage was done. One of his apples was mellowed a little; that was all.|$|E
60|$|As the day wore on {{his state}} of mind passed from wonder to elation, albeit the {{circumstances}} of his dismissal from the Long Dragon were still disagreeable to recall, and a garbled account of the matter that had reached his colleagues led to some badinage. It was evident he must be careful how he lifted <b>frangible</b> articles, but in other ways his gift promised more and more as he turned it over in his mind. He intended among other things to increase his personal property by unostentatious acts of creation. He called into existence a pair of very splendid diamond studs, and hastily annihilated them again as young Gomshott came across the counting-house to his desk. He was afraid young Gomshott might wonder how he had come by them. He saw quite clearly the gift required caution and watchfulness in its exercise, but so far as he could judge the difficulties attending its mastery would be no greater than those he had already faced in the study of cycling. It was that analogy, perhaps, quite as much as the feeling that he would be unwelcome in the Long Dragon, that drove him out after supper into the lane beyond the gas-works, to rehearse a few miracles in private.|$|E
6000|$|... § 3. Not better {{painted in}} every respect. In those {{interesting}} and popular treatises {{on the art}} of drawing, which tell the public that their colors should neither be too warm nor too cold, and that their touches should always be characteristic of the object they are intended to represent, the directions given for the manufacture of stones usually enforce [...] "crispness of outline" [...] and [...] "roughness of texture." [...] And, accordingly, in certain expressions of frangibility, irregular accumulation, and easy resting of one block upon another, together with some conditions of lichenous or mossy texture, modern stone-painting is far beyond the ancient; for these are just the characters which first strike the eye, and enable the foreground to maintain its picturesque influence, without inviting careful examination. The mediæval painter, on the other hand, not caring for this picturesque general effect, nor being in anywise familiar with mountain scenery, perceived in stones, when he was forced to paint them, eminently the characters which they had in common with figures; that is to say, their curved outlines, rounded surfaces, and varieties of delicate color, and, accordingly, was somewhat too apt to lose their angular and fragmentary character in a series of muscular lines resembling those of an anatomical preparation; for, although in large rocks the cleavable or <b>frangible</b> nature was the thing that necessarily struck him most, the pebbles under his feet were apt to be oval or rounded in the localities of almost all the important schools of Italy. In Lombardy, the mass of the ground is composed of nothing but Alpine gravel, consisting of rolled oval pebbles, on the average about six inches long by four wide--awkward building materials, yet used in ingenious alternation with the bricks in all the lowland Italian fortresses. Besides this universal rotundity, the qualities of stones which rendered them valuable to the lapidary were forced on the painter's attention by the familiar arts of inlaying and mosaic. Hence, in looking at a pebble, his mind was divided between its roundness and its veins; and Leonardo covers the shelves of rock under the feet of St. Anne with variegated agates; while Mantegna often strews the small stones about his mountain caves in a polished profusion, as if some repentant martyr princess had been just scattering her caskets of pearls into the dust.|$|E

50|$|A {{material}} {{is said to}} be <b>frangible</b> if through deformation it tends to break up into fragments, rather than deforming elastically and retaining its cohesion as a single object.

50|$|<b>Frangible</b> bullets {{striking}} animal targets create wounds {{similar to}} conventional bullets. Some penetrate soft tissue similar to {{full metal jacket}} bullets. Some may disintegrate upon striking bone.

During penetration, a <b>frangible</b> projectile's core fragments into many high-velocity pieces. The {{effect of a}} <b>frangible</b> projectile on a lightly armoured target {{is much the same}} as a high explosive incendiary round, but with a cloud of dense, high-velocity fragments penetrating deeper into the target's interior. Upon striking heavy armour the effect of FAPDS is more akin to a standard APDS, albeit with higher fragmentation of the core, and hence lethality if the armour is perforated.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Frangible</b> bullets will {{disintegrate}} upon {{contact with}} a surface harder than the bullet itself. <b>Frangible</b> bullets are often used by shooters engaging in close quarter combat training to avoid ricochets; targets are placed on steel backing plates that serve to completely fragment the bullet. <b>Frangible</b> bullets are typically made of non-toxic metals, and are frequently used on [...] "green" [...] ranges and outdoor ranges where lead abatement is a concern.|$|E

Brittle <b>frangible</b> bullets may break during the self-loading cycle of semi-automatic firearms; and those fired from revolvers often break as the bullet encounters the barrel forcing cone after leaving the cylinder.|$|E

50|$|The {{mechanism}} of bullet disintegration {{varies with the}} energy transfer {{at the time of}} impact. With sufficient velocity, bullets may be vaporized upon impact. Few firearms can propel bullets at sufficient velocity to cause reliable vaporization at the target, and air resistance causes bullet velocity to decrease with increasing distance from the firing point; so <b>frangible</b> bullets typically rely upon other mechanisms for disintegration at lower velocities. Target characteristics are an important aspect of interaction with the bullet. Energy available to initiate the disintegration mechanism is limited by {{the rate at which the}} target slows the bullet; so bullets may pass through flexible, fragile or low-density materials without slowing the bullet enough to cause disintegration. Bullets must resist disintegration during handling, loading, and firing to reliably hit the target; so high-velocity loads may require a non-frangible jacket to protect a <b>frangible</b> core from disintegration prior to target impact. The jacket may ricochet, but should have reduced range without the weight of the <b>frangible</b> core. <b>Frangible</b> hollow-point bullets may penetrate clothing, drywall, and light sheet metal; but often disintegrate upon striking glass.|$|E
50|$|<b>Frangible</b> bullets offer {{improved}} {{safety for}} specialized combat simulation training involving firing at {{an array of}} multiple steel targets in various directions encountered while moving through a maze. <b>Frangible</b> bullets are also used in reduced ricochet, limited penetration (RRLP) loads intended to reduce risk to friendly forces and innocent persons during close quarters military or police actions in urban areas, aboard ships, or in hazardous material environments like oil platforms and chemical or nuclear plants.|$|E

5000|$|On March 4, 2011, a Taurus XL rocket failed {{again during}} the launch of NASA's $424 million Glory climate change {{monitoring}} satellite. In total, the last two failures of the Taurus XL have resulted in payload losses worth $700 million. [...] The reason for the failure {{was the same as}} with OCO: the payload fairing failed to separate, although the rocket's manufacturer Orbital Sciences Corporation had spent the last two years trying to fix the problem and had made several design changes to the fairing separation system. Ronald Grabe, manager of Orbital Sciences Corporation, which also built the Glory satellite itself, said the employees of his companies are [...] "pretty devastated" [...] because of the latest failure. [...] The fairing was built by the Vermont Composites company, and the <b>frangible</b> rail pyrotechnic separation system was built by the Ensign-Bickford Company. A NASA MIB panel concluded that the failure was most likely caused by a section of the <b>frangible</b> rail somewhere near the nose cap failing to separate. While a root cause could not be identified, two likely causes were identified: the rubber charge holder in the <b>frangible</b> rail slumping due to launch acceleration and random vibration, or a failure of the <b>frangible</b> rail system due to it operating outside the environment for which it was tested.|$|E
