The aim {{of the study was to}} explore these attitudes and to identify any commonalities in underlying reasons for the attitudes displayed. After reviewing current literature on the topic themes of understanding vs attainment, confidence vs challenge, enjoyment vs obligation and use value vs exchange value were identified as being key and informed the design of questionnaires given to 106 students in year 10 studying for higher tier mathematics GCSE. The mixed method research style combined the quantitative results of these questionnaires with semi structured interviews with a small group of students selected by their responses. Results showed that the reported low aspirations were much less widespread than initially thought and student aims had in general risen throughout the year. Regardless of this links were found between certain feelings toward mathematics and having lower expectations of themselves, most notably non-enjoyment of the subject indicating lower aspirations for achievement...|$|R

40|$|This {{study has}} {{explored}} the motivational problem of speaking among language learners <b>in</b> <b>an</b> English secondary school. It {{set out from}} the premise that learners’ speaking is {{an important aspect of}} language learning but it is beset by a series of motivational difficulties, including lack of knowledge of oral progress, lack of awareness of how to improve, lack of confidence <b>in</b> speaking and <b>an</b> inability to say what they want to say. There has been little research into motivation in specific language skills among learners in UK schools despite evidence that speaking is associated with low levels of achievement. This study has sought to shed some light on this difficult aspect of language learning from the students’ perspectives. The study was conducted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large,</b> <b>mixed</b> comprehensive school <b>in</b> South East England in 2006 - 2007 and involved qualitative case studies of classes of students aged 11 to 14. Information was elicited by means of questionnaires, diaries and interviews. Performance data on students was also obtained from teachers (pseudonyms are used throughout when referring to the school, the teachers and the students). Although the study is small-scale, a series of key themes emerged from the data, which could help to inform developments in language teaching, research and policy. The findings of the study suggest that speaking is affected by a series of complex individual and social motivational variables that are not well understood but are, nonetheless, a source of tension for some learners.

The work was conducted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large,</b> <b>mixed</b> colony <b>in</b> the western Wadden Sea (Texel), where measures of fecundity were collected simultaneously. In Herring Gulls, we found a mean apparent annual adult survival of 79 % in females and 86 % in males. Additive year effects rather than sex provided highest model support in Lesser Black-backed Gulls, in which apparent survival for both sexes combined varied between 81 % and 100 % (mean approximate to 91 %). Breeding success in Lesser Black-backed Gulls was significantly lower than that of Herring Gulls. Lesser Black-backed Gulls experienced four consecutive breeding seasons with very low fledging rates (2006 - 2009) as a result of cannibalism (60 - 67 % of all hatchlings). Chick predation was generally lower <b>in</b> Herring Gulls. <b>A</b> strong population increase in Lesser Black-backed Gulls coincided with substantial population declines in Herring Gulls in the Wadden Sea in the late 20 st and early 21 st century.

In recent years, within the College, {{there has been a}} {{perceived}} augmentation of a culture of reluctance and lethargy towards practical work in science amongst the students. Teachers have reported that many students were trying to choose to ‘opt out’ of practical work and instead work out of a text book. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore these attitudes and opinions towards practical work in science and to identify any correlation in the underlying reasons for the perspectives displayed. After reviewing current literature about the topic, it became apparent that there was very little research conducted into the perspective of the student with regards to the purpose of practical work in science and how that compared to the perspective and intentions of the teacher. As the emphasis on practical work has been heightened during the A-Level reform, this investigation had clear justification. In order to explore these perspectives, four Research Questions were composed. Firstly, what do students and teachers believe is the purpose of practical work in science? Secondly, do all students consider practical work in science enjoyable and beneficial to their learning? Thirdly, what elements of practical work are considered to be the most important? Lastly, do students always understand what a practical requires of them?

Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to statistically test risk factors for VR <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> population of equids. Hospital records were reviewed for 3. 499 equids, admitted at the internal medicine department of the Liege Equine Teaching Hospital between 1994 and 2011, aged ≥ 2 years, and which underwent thorough cardiac clinical evaluation. Of this population, 495 cases had ECG and echocardiography performed because of a clinical suspicion of cardiac disease. Chi-square test or logistic regressions (as appropriate) were used to test if breed, gender, age, body weight (BW), and co-existence of various cardiac diseases were risk factors for each VR. Moreover, the risk of development of congestive heart failure (CHF) was tested for each VR. Significance was set at p< 0. 05. Most of the studied animals were warmbloods, and observed prevalences were 4. 4 % for mitral regurgitation (MR), 2. 1 % for aortic regurgitation (AR), 1. 7 % for tricuspid regurgitation (TR), and 1. 0 % for pulmonary regurgitation (PR). Significant risk factors were male gender and increasing age for AR (OR= 2. 03, CI= 1. 07 - 4. 94), and racehorses breed group and middle-age for TR (OR= 4. 36; CI= 1. 10 - 17. 24). No effect of age or BW was demonstrated for MR. MR was the major valvular disease associated with atrial fibrillation (AF), ventricular tachyarrhythmia, PR and CHF. TR was also linked to AF, PR and CHF; but AR was not linked to CHF. In conclusion, several previously suspected risks factors for VR were confirmed statistically in this study and should be taken into account in health and athletic monitoring of horses presenting predisposing factors.

40|$|AIM: The {{traditional}} architecture based classification system of ductal {{carcinoma in situ}} (DCIS) has been criticised {{on the grounds that}} individual lesions often show more than one pattern resulting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>mixed</b> category. New DCIS classification systems have emphasised the importance of cytological grade, which is reputed to be more uniformly expressed throughout a lesion. This study investigates the hypothesis that cytological heterogeneity is less common than architectural heterogeneity within DCIS lesions. METHODS: 121 cases of DCIS were graded as poorly, intermediately, or well differentiated according to a recently developed classification system that employs cytonuclear morphology as the major diagnostic criterion. Cases were categorised as pure when only one grade was present and as mixed if more than one grade was observed. Architecturally the cases were classified as solid, cribriform, micropapillary, or papillary and were described as pure if only one architectural pattern was present and as mixed if more than one pattern was seen. The incidence of cytological heterogeneity was compared with that of architectural heterogeneity. The presence of necrosis was assessed as an independent parameter and the relation to DCIS grade evaluated. RESULTS: Using the cytology based classification system 102 cases (84 %) were classified as pure (65 poorly differentiated, 25 intermediately differentiated, and 12 well differentiated) and 19 cases (16 %) as mixed. Extensive necrosis was observed in 61 (50 %) cases and was closely correlated to DCIS grade. Architecturally 46 cases (38 %) were classified as pure (38 solid, 5 cribriform, 2 micropapillary, and 1 papillary) and 75 (62 %) as mixed. CONCLUSIONS: Cytological heterogeneity is much less common than architectural heterogeneity in DCIS lesions. The assessment of cytonuclear morphology is therefore likely to provide more consistent information about DCIS, particularly in small biopsy specimens where only part of the lesion may be available for examination...|$|R

40|$|Master thesis, Programme in Medicine. TITLE: Waiting Time at the Emergency Department from a Gender Equality Perspective. Introduction Increasing patient {{load and}} longer waiting {{times at the}} {{emergency}} departments are well-known phenomena. A central function is the so-called triage system for prioritization of the patients. Only a few studies address the question if there is <b>a</b> gender bias <b>in</b> triaging and waiting time. Aim To quantify gender effects <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>mixed</b> population of patients seeking health care at <b>a</b> <b>large</b> emergency department and, {{on the basis of}} the magnitude of the gender difference in subpopulations draw conclusions regarding possible causes of observed gender effects. Methods The patient material consisted of all cases seeking medical care at the emergency ward of the Östra Hospital during 2009 - 2012. They were divided into subgroups on the basis of gender, chief complaint, age and socioeconomic status. A standardized formula (RETTSTM) was used in the triaging process and the patients were prioritized with one of five colors. Three time registrations were recorded; time to triage (TTT), time to doctor (TTD) and total lead time (TLT). Results 135 417 patients were included in the study with a mean age of 54, 2 years. They came from all parts of Gothenburg. Men were more often triaged red/orange and women more often green/yellow. There was no gender difference in TTT. The mean TTD and TLT were significantly longer for females than for males in the entire material, with an approximate magnitude of 15 minutes. The gender signal was seen independently of the chief complaint, in both medical and surgical cases. The signal disappeared among old seriously ill patients and among patients from residence areas with high socioeconomic status. Conclusion We observed differences in waiting times and triage priority levels that are hard to explain on the basis of presenting symptoms. The magnitude of the gender dependent signal was affected by age and socioeconomic status.

40|$|Although {{the culture}} of an {{organisation}} is often regarded as {{a key component of}} its overall character as well as a determinant of its success, it is a difficult, complex and intricate concept that is hard to define. Further, its individualistic and organic nature means it is potentially hard to capture, let alone measure. This research focused on the effects of planned change on the organisational culture among staff that present HE programmes <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>mixed</b> economy college <b>in</b> the United Kingdom (UK). After a critical review of the current literature on organisational culture was conducted a case study approach was used to collect the primary data. This case study comprised a two-phase research design. While Phase 1 focused on the returns to a published questionnaire by Brown [1998], Phase 2 comprised a series of follow-up open-ended, semi-structured interviews with some of the staff who had completed Phase 1 of the project. As a result a ‘snapshot’ of the changes in {{the culture of}} that part of the organisation where the research was undertaken to be captured. The findings of the follow-up interviews, based on the negative aspects elicited in phase one of this process, provided an opportunity for staff to consider these issues in greater depth and detail. Conclusions was drawn from the findings provided evidence that the two phase approach to data collection provided valuable information relating to changes in the organisational culture (and particularly its subcultures) at a time of planned change. These data supported the view expressed in the literature review that the nature of organisational culture in this setting is also complex, both overt and opaque and similarly dynamic to that found in any other large organisation. Further, and also in line with the findings of the literature review, {{as a result of the}} different perceptions (and thus the reactions of individual staff within the two Schools) the planned changes created unpredictable influences on the sub-cultures within the setting.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Corticosteroids are {{frequently}} used in critically ill patients. We investigated whether systemic corticosteroid use increases {{the probability of}} transitioning to delirium <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> population of <b>mixed</b> medical-surgical ICU patients. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: A 32 -bed medical-surgical ICU at an academic medical center. PATIENTS: Critically ill adults (n = 1, 112), admitted to the ICU for more than 24 hours without a condition that could hamper delirium assessment. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Systemic corticosteroid exposure was measured daily and converted to prednisone equivalents (milligrams). Daily mental status was classified as coma, delirium, or an awake without delirium state. Transitions between states were analyzed using a first-order Markov multinomial logistic regression model with 11 different covariables, with the transition from an awake without delirium state to delirium as a primary interest. Among the 1, 112 patients, corticosteroids were administered on 35 % (3, 483 / 9, 867) of the ICU days at a median dose of 50 mg (interquartile range, 25 - 75 mg) prednisone equivalent. Administration of a corticosteroid, and any increase in the dose of the corticosteroid given on exposure days, was not significantly associated with the transition to delirium (adjusted odds ratio, 1. 08; 95 % CI, 0. 89 - 1. 32 and adjusted odds ratio, 1. 00; 95 % CI, 0. 99 - 1. 01, per 10 mg increase in prednisone equivalent).

The researcher adopted quantitative methods to test the hypothesis that a combined New Literacies and Print Comprehension Strategy Instruction intervention positively influences online comprehension levels. The researcher used qualitative data produced by focus group sessions and reflective logs to explore results of the intervention. The study was conducted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large,</b> <b>mixed,</b> primary school located in North county Dublin. One hundred and sixty Irish primary school pupils participated in the quasi-field experiment (N = 160). 84 female participants (n = 84) and 76 male participants (n = 76) partook in this study. There were 40 (n= 40) participants in each condition ranging from seven to ten years. The between group independent variable was form of comprehension strategy instruction and consisted of four levels: No comprehension strategy instruction, Print Comprehension Strategy Instruction, New Literacies comprehension strategy instruction and Combined Print and New Literacies comprehension strategy instruction. The within groups independent variable was time which was measured pre-intervention (Time 1) and post-intervention (Time 2) for each condition group. The dependent variable was Online Comprehension levels which were measured using the Online Research and Comprehension Assessment (ORCA) Primary. Condition 1 was a control condition, participants in this condition did not engage in Comprehension Strategy Instruction. In Condition 2 participants received Print based Comprehension strategy instruction. In Condition 3 participants received New Literacies Comprehension strategy instruction. Finally, in Condition 4 participants received Combined Print and New Literacies Comprehension strategy instruction. A Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test revealed a statistically significant increase in online comprehension levels from Time 1 to Time 2 in the combined Print and New Literacies comprehension instruction condition, z =- 2. 35, p =. 01, with a medium effect size (r =. 3). Wilcoxon Signed Rank Tests revealed no statistically significant difference in ORCA Elementary revised scores from Time 1 to Time 2 in all other conditions. Thematic Analysis of focus group and reflective log data identified one main theme; The application and uses of individual comprehension strategies in online comprehension and research. Within this theme three subthemes were identified; strategies used for online comprehension research purposes; strategies used for online comprehension of static texts and strategies that were ineffective for either online research comprehension or online comprehension of static texts.

While the historic centre was neglected during most of {{the second half of the}} 20 th century, recent public initiatives have been leading to new urban morphologies and typologies. In addition to the redevelopment of the historic market and the investments <b>in</b> museums, <b>a</b> <b>large</b> scale <b>mixed</b> use development, known as Msheireb project, has been launched, which will replace an entire district. The objective of this paper is therefore to clarify how these public initiatives are modifying existing urban structures and to which extent this spatial reconfiguration contributes to major revitalisation objectives, such as diversity, consolidation and identity. The methodologies include a GIS survey to analyse the shift in urban densities, land uses and typologies as well as a Space Syntax study assessing the various levels of spatial integration in the case of the Msheireb project...|$|R
40|$|Production {{planning}} {{is a very}} important step in managing the operation of a single refinery and their complexes. Despite its significance, few contributions have been found in literature and the existing ones rely on linear models. Pinto et al. (Comp. Chem. Engng. 24, 2259 - 2276, 2000), presented a superstructure that represents a general topology and allows the implementation of nonlinear process models as well as blending relations. The main objective of the present work is to extend the single refinery model to a corporate planning model that contains multiple refineries, which can be connected by supply pipelines in common. Intermediate streams also interconnect refineries in order to take advantage of each plant infrastructure. The model is optimized along a planning horizon resulting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> scale <b>Mixed</b> Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP). The non-linearity arises from blending equations and physical properties. The objective function maximizes net present value under raw material and product inventory level constraints as well as mass balance and operating constraints in each refinery. Finally, detailed analysis for different crude oil types and product demand scenarios is incorporated <b>in</b> the model. <b>A</b> real-world application is developed for a refinery network composed of three refineries. Different petroleum types are supplied to the refineries from a single oil terminal. Results show that the optimization of the supply chain presents clear advantages of the corporate planning with respect to multiple one-site refinery production planning...|$|R

40|$|Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) {{have been}} widely used as a {{representation}} of conditional independence in machine learning and statistics. Moreover, hidden or latent variables are often an important component of graphical models. However, DAG models suffer from an important limitation: the family of DAGs is not closed under marginalization of hidden variables. This means that in general we cannot use a DAG to represent the independencies over a subset of variables <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> DAG. Directed <b>mixed</b> graphs (DMGs) are a representation that includes DAGs as a special case, and overcomes this limitation. This paper introduces algorithms for performing Bayesian inference in Gaussian and probit DMG models. An important requirement for inference is the characterization of the distribution over parameters of the models. We introduce a new distribution for covariance matrices of Gaussian DMGs. We discuss and illustrate how several Bayesian machine learning tasks can benefit from the principle presented here: the power to model dependencies that are generated from hidden variables, but without necessarily modelling such variables explicitly...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} some of {{the principal}} findings of an experimental investigation of forced statistically steady turbulence <b>in</b> <b>a</b> rapidly rotating background. The experiment is conducted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> cylindrical <b>mixing</b> tank and bulk rotation is produced by two large co-rotating impellers installed near the top and {{the bottom of the}} tank. The mean flow motion generated <b>in</b> such <b>a</b> configuration is axisymmetric and close to but not exactly solid-body rotation. The focus of this work is on the region {{in the vicinity of the}} rotation axis where the flow is Rayleigh stable. The unique features of this facility allows forcing and thus permits turbulence to be maintained at a certain level without a mean decay. The facility also allows an easy experimental access of statistical quantities. The bulk rotation rates and the amount of turbulence are adjusted to a Rossby number (Ro) of O(1). Under this condition, some physical phenomena commonly seen in solid-body rotating turbulent flows at low Ro are also observed, despite the differences <b>in</b> other parameters. <b>A</b> flow visualization at one of the testing conditions using pearlescence clearly shows the presence of cyclonic columnar structures. Two-dimensional particle image velocimetry (2 DPIV) measurements are carried out <b>in</b> <b>a</b> plane normal to the axis of the rotation and near the middle height of the tank. Symmetry breaking between cyclonic and anti-cyclonic vorticity in the flow is revealed by the skewness of the fluctuating vorticity. It is found that skewness is not a monotonic function of Ro; in this particular experimental arrangement, symmetry is broken to a maximum extent at Ro∼ 1. 5 based on velocity length scale. Turbulence quantities are also computed along with the turbulent energy dissipation, which is estimated using velocity structure functions and lends support to previous findings that purport that dissipation is suppressed in such flows...|$|R

40|$|Background: Growing {{evidence}} suggests that individual genetic susceptibility may influence the host's response to infections. Previously, we showed that <b>a</b> common variation <b>in</b> the interleukin (IL) - 6 gene was associated with increased odds of detection of common periodontal pathogens from individuals with aggressive periodontitis. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the association between IL- 6 polymorphisms and periodontopathogenic bacteria <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger,</b> ethnically <b>mixed</b> population of subjects with periodontitis. Methods: Genomic DNA was extracted from 107 subjects diagnosed with severe forms of periodontitis to study a cluster of polymorphisms in inflammatory genes, including IL- 6. The presence of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Tannereila forsythia (previously T. forsythensis) in their subgingival biofilm was determined by polymerase chain reaction analysis. Serum IL- 6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the IL- 6 - 6106 polymorphism was associated with the detection of A. actinomycetemcomitans (P = 0. 009; odds ratio [OR] = 3. 5; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 38 to 9. 16) and the concomitant detection of A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis (P = 0. 015; OR = 3. 6; 95 % CI: 1. 28 to 10. 04). The IL- 6 - 174 polymorphism was associated with increased odds of the concomitant detection of A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis (P = 0. 042; OR = 2. 8; 95 % CI: 1. 04 to 7. 75). Haplotype analysis of all five IL- 6 polymorphisms confirmed an association with the detection of A. actinomycetemcomitans (P = 0. 046). The IL- 6 - 6106 polymorphism was also associated with CRP serum levels at multivariate analysis (P = 0. 024). Conclusions: These findings confirm the hypothesis that complex interactions between the microbiota and host genome are at the basis of susceptibility to periodontitis. Periodontal disease may represent a useful model to study the pathways and mechanisms of host-pathogen interactions in inflammatory diseases. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Effects of <b>a</b> <b>large</b> rotor tip gap on the {{performance}} of a one and half stage axial compressor are investigated <b>in</b> detail with <b>a</b> numerical simulation based on LES and available PIV data. The current paper studies the main flow physics, including why and how the loss generation is increased with the large rotor tip gap. The present study reveals that when the tip gap becomes large, tip clearance fluid goes over the tip clearance core vortex and enters into the next blade's tip gap, which is called double-leakage tip clearance flow. As the tip clearance flow enters into the adjacent blade's tip gap, a vortex rope with a lower pressure core is generated. This vortex rope breaks up the tip clearance core vortex of the adjacent blade, resulting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> additional <b>mixing.</b> This double-leakage tip clearance flow occurs at all operating conditions, from design flow to near stall condition, with the large tip gap for the current compressor stage. The double-leakage tip clearance flow, its interaction with the tip clearance core vortex of the adjacent blade, and the resulting <b>large</b> <b>mixing</b> loss are the main flow mechanism of the large rotor tip gap in the compressor. When the tip clearance is smaller, flow near the end wall follows more closely with the main passage flow and this double-leakage tip clearance flow does not happen near the design flow condition for the current compressor stage. When the compressor with <b>a</b> <b>large</b> tip gap operates at near stall operation, a strong vortex rope is generated near the leading edge due to the double-leakage flow. Part of this vortex separates from the path of the tip clearance core vortex and travels from the suction side of the blade toward the pressure side of the blade. This vortex is generated periodically at near stall operation with <b>a</b> <b>large</b> tip gap. <b>As</b> the vortex travels from the suction side to the pressure side of the blade, <b>a</b> <b>large</b> fluctuation of local pressure forces blade vibration. Nonsynchronous blade vibration occurs due to this vortex as the frequency of this vortex generation {{is not the same as}} the rotor. The present investigation confirms that this vortex is a part of separated tip clearance vortex, which is caused by the double-leakage tip clearance flow...|$|R
