40|$|Comparisons of {{the course}} of {{coccidioidomycosis}} in two strains of inbred mice established that BALB/c mice are significantly more susceptible to pulmonary infection with Coccidioides immitis than are DBA/ 2 mice. The susceptibility of BALB/c mice does not reside in their inability to mount a <b>delayed-type</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>response</b> to C. immitis antigen. That is, BALB/c mice manifested footpad hypersensitivity to coccidioidin early {{during the course of}} disease, to a level comparable to that of DBA/ 2 mice. In contrast to the more resistant DBA/ 2 mouse strain, however, BALB/c mice developed anergy by day 15 postinfection. Suppression of the <b>delayed-type</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>response</b> was not specific for C. immitis antigen, as evidenced by the finding that BALB/c mice immunized with mycobacterial purified protein derivative prior to infection with C. immitis were suppressed in their footpad response to mycobacterial antigen at day 15 postinfection. Taken together, these results establish that genetically determined susceptibility to this fungus is associated with an acquired suppression of cell-mediated immune reactivity...|$|E

40|$|Inbred CBA/J mice {{were used}} in {{developing}} a defined in vivo model for studying host-parasite relationships in cryptococcosis. Mice were infected either intranasally or intraperitoneally with 103 viable Cryptococcus neoformans cells. At weekly intervals over a 92 -day period, C. neoformans growth profiles in the lungs, spleens, livers, and brains of the infected animals were determined. In addition, humoral and <b>delayed-type</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>responses</b> and cryptococcal antigen levels were assayed in these mice. Intranasally infected mice developed strong <b>delayed-type</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> reactions in <b>response</b> to cryptococcal culture filtrate (CneF) antigen, and there was good correlation between acquisition of <b>delayed-type</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> and the reduction of C. neoformans cell numbers in infected tissues. In contrast, intraperitoneally infected mice displayed greater numbers of C. neoformans cells in tissues and had somewhat suppressed <b>delayed-type</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>responses</b> to CneF antigen. Anticryptococcal antibodies were not detected in intranasally or intraperitoneally infected mice, but cryptococcal polysaccharide antigen titers were relatively high in both groups. The transfer of sensitized spleen cells from intranasally infected mice to syngeneic naive recipient mice resulted in the transfer of <b>delayed-type</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> responsiveness to cryptococcal antigen in the recipients.

40|$|Intravenous {{injection}} of BALB/c mice with coccidioidin or an alkali-soluble cell wall extract of Coccidioides immitis mycelia {{resulted in the}} induction of a splenic cell population(s) that suppressed <b>delayed-type</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>response</b> to coccidioidal antigen. To determine whether the levels of C. immitis antigen produced {{during the course of}} active coccidioidal disease might also cause suppression of T-lymphocyte response, BALB/c mice were infected by intranasal instillation of arthroconidia, and 2 weeks later, their sera were evaluated for suppression of T-lymphocyte response in syngeneic recipients. Intravenous transfer of sera, which were shown to contain high levels of coccidioidal antigen by an enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay, suppressed the <b>delayed-type</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>response</b> of recipients to immunization with coccidioidin. Solid-phase immunoadsorption of the sera with goat antibodies to C. immitis antigens removed the suppressive component(s). To determine whether the suppressive effect of circulating coccidioidal antigen(s) was associated with the activation of a splenic suppressor cell(s), as was observed in mice injected intravenously with coccidioidal antigen, spleen cell lysates were prepared from infected donors, and after filtration to remove viable fungi, the lysates were transferred to syngeneic mice. Recipients of lysates from infected but not noninfected donors were suppressed in their response to immunization with coccidioidin. Collectively, these results provide evidence that depressed T-cell responses observed in coccidioidomycosis are associated with, and may be attributable to, the activation of a suppressor cell or factor by circulating C. immitis antigens...|$|E

There was high concordance between CCR 5 polymorphisms and haplotype pairs that influenced <b>delayed-type</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>responses</b> in healthy persons and HIV disease progression. In the cohorts examined, CCR 5 genotypes containing - 2459 G/G (HHA/HHA, HHA/HHC, HHC/HHC) or - 2459 A/A (HHE/HHE) associated with salutary or detrimental <b>delayed-type</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> and AIDS phenotypes, respectively. Accordingly, the CCR 5 -Δ 32 allele, when paired with non-Δ 32 -bearing haplotypes that correlate with low (HHA, HHC) versus high (HHE) CCR 5 transcriptional activity, associates with disease retardation or acceleration, respectively. Thus, the associations of CCR 5 -Δ 32 heterozygosity partly reflect {{the effect of the}} non-▵ 32 haplotype in a background of CCR 5 haploinsufficiency. The correlations of increased <b>delayed-type</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> with - 2459 G/G-containing CCR 5 genotypes, reduced CCR 5 expression, decreased viral replication, and disease retardation suggest that CCR 5 may influence HIV infection and AIDS, at least in part, through effects on cell-mediated immunity...|$|R

In this study, we isolated a 62 -kDa band, termed HIS- 62, from electrophoresed cell wall and cell membrane of H. capsulatum yeast cells and examined its antigenicity and immunogenicity. C 57 BL/ 6, BALB/c, and CBA/J mice that were immunized with viable H. capsulatum yeast cells mounted a <b>delayed-type</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>response</b> to HIS- 62 that was stronger than that of normal controls.

In vitro, responder lymphocytes harvested from popliteal and inguinal lymph nodes of immunized animals exhibited significant proliferation to the MHC allopeptide mixture. In addition, these responder lymphocytes had significantly increased proliferation to allogeneic WF (RT 1 u) stimulator cells, when compared to naive controls in the standard one-way mixed lymphocyte response. In vivo, peptide-immunized LEW animals were challenged in the ear 2 weeks after immunization with the allopeptide mixture, the individual allopeptide sequences, or allogeneic WF splenocytes. When compared to controls, these animals had significant <b>delayed-type</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>responses</b> to the allopeptide mixture, to the beta-pleated sheet allopeptide sequences, and to allogeneic WF splenocytes but not to the alpha-helix allopeptide sequences, to syngeneic LEW splenocytes, or to third party allogeneic BN splenocytes. Oral administration of the allopeptide mixture to LEW responder rats daily for 5 days before immunization effected significant reduction of <b>delayed-type</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>responses</b> both to the allopeptide mixture and to allogeneic splenocytes. This reduction was antigen-specific, since there was no reduction of <b>delayed-type</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>responses</b> to mycobacterium tuberculosis.

Thus different mediators may modulate the various immune responses affected by ultraviolet exposure, depending on the wavelength of the radiation...|$|E
40|$|When UVB-irradiated urocanic acid, the {{putative}} photo- receptor/mediator for UVB suppression, is administered to mice it induces a dose-dependent {{suppression of the}} <b>delayed-type</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>response</b> to herpes simplex virus, type 1 (HSV- 1), of similar magnitude to that induced by UV irradiation of mice. In this study, the efferent suppression of delayed-type hypersensitivity by UV-irradiated urocanic acid is demonstrated {{to be due to}} 2 phenotypically distinct T cells, (Thy 1 +, L 3 T 4 -Ly 2 +) and (Thy 1 +, L 3 T 4 +, Ly 2 -). The suppression is specific for HSV- 1. This situation parallels the generation of 2 distinct T-suppressor cells for HSV- 1 by UV irradiation of mice and provides further evidence for the involvement of urocanic acid in the generation of UVB suppression...|$|E
40|$|Several murine Sendai virus-specific T-cell clones were {{characterized}} in vitro and in vivo. All T-cell clones were phenotypically Thy- 1. 2 +, and most clones were Lyt- 1 +, 2 -; one T-cell clone was Lyt- 1 -, 2 -. Some of the clones proliferated {{in response to}} antigen presented on I region-compatible stimulator cells. Proliferation could be inhibited by monoclonal antibodies directed against class II antigens. Clones which proliferated in response to antigen secreted lymphokines which could be identified as Interleukin 2 and Interleukin 3. All of the clones tested in vivo induced a <b>delayed-type</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>response</b> in syngeneic mice challenged with antigens. Depending on the experimental conditions chosen, Interleukin 2 -producing clones as well as non-Interleukin 2 -producing clones mediated help for stimulation of cytolytic T lymphocytes...|$|E
40|$|Liposomes {{composed}} of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine were reconstituted by detergent dialysis with 3 M K Cl extracts of L 2 C tumour cells. Liposomes containing L 2 C antigens were as antigenic as intact tumour {{cells in the}} elicitation of <b>delayed-type</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>responses</b> in strain- 2 guinea-pigs previously immunized against L 2 C tumours. Soluble L 2 C antigens were devoid of immunoprotective activity, whereas the reconstituted liposomes were capable of protecting animals against up to approximately 100 times the minimal lethal dose of tumour cells. Moreover, the reconstituted liposomes were as antigenic and immunoprotective as viable (irradiated) cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{contribution}} of autoimmune {{responses to the}} pathogenesis of Theiler's virus-induced demyelinating disease was investigated. <b>Delayed-type</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>responses</b> to myelin were examined in both symptomatic and asymptomatic mice at different times post-infection, {{in order to determine}} whether autoreactivity correlates with the development of demyelination. The results indicate that although autoimmune responses probably do not {{play a major role in}} the initiation of demyelination at early times post-infection, autoreactivity to myelin antigens dose eventually develop in symptomatic animals, perhaps through the mechanism of epitope spreading. Autoimmunity to myelin components is therefore an additional factor that may contribute to lesion progression in chronically diseased animals...|$|R
40|$|Several Histoplasma capsulatum-reactive murine cloned T-cell lines (TCLs) were {{isolated}} from spleens of C 57 BL/ 6 mice immunized with viable H. capsulatum yeast cells, using {{the methodology of}} Kimoto and Fathman (1980). These T-cells were characterized phenotypically as Thy- 1. 2 (+) Lyt- 1 (+) L 3 T 4 (+) Lyt- 2 (-), that is, as the helper/inducer phenotype. The cloned T cells proliferate in response to histoplasmin and, in some cases, to heterologous fungal anigens. Upon injection of mice with the antigen, the T-cells mediate local <b>delayed-type</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>responses</b> and, after stimulation, release regulatory lymphokines...|$|R
