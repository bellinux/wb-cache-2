5000|$|Prior to the {{developments}} {{leading to the}} use of pulverized coal most boilers utilized <b>grate</b> <b>firing</b> where the fuel was mechanically distributed onto a moving grate {{at the bottom of the}} firebox in a partially crushed gravel like form.

In 1918 The Milwaukee Electric Railway and Light Company, later Wisconsin Electric, conducted tests in the use of pulverized coal at its Oneida Street power plant. These experiments helped Fred L. Dornbrook to develop methods of controlling the pulverized coal's tarry ash residues with boiler feed water tube jackets that served to reduce the surface temperature of the firebox walls and allowed the ash deposits be easily removed. This plant became the first central power station in the United States to use pulverized fuel.|$|E

40|$|<b>Grate</b> <b>firing</b> is {{the most}} common way to burn bio-fuels in {{small-scale}} units. Different combustion modes are achieved depending on how fuel and primary air are introduced.

The fuel was forest waste with moisture content of approximately 50 %. The combustion in a cross-current flow furnace is generally assumed to start by ignition {{on the surface of the}} bed, followed by a reaction front propagating from the surface down to the grate.

Hence, the progress of combustion in the bed is opposite to the expected one...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the present work was to demonstrate the possibilities to reduce the emission of fine particle forming alkali during co-combustion of wood with peat in a full scale (150 kW) <b>grate</b> <b>fired</b> boiler. For this purpose the particle emissions from a 150 kW district heating <b>grate</b> <b>fired</b> boiler situated in northern part of Kramfors, Sweden, were studied. During the experiment the district heating boiler was fired with sawdust fuel with a 0, 10 and 20 wt-% (zero, low, high) peat content respectively. Mass concentrations and particle size distribution were measured by using a DLPI (13 -step low-pressure cascade impactor) with a precyclone. The particle matter was analyzed for morphology and elemental composition using SEM/EDS (Scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive spectroscopy). In addition, chemical equilibrium model calculations were used to interpret the experimental findings. The present study clearly shows that reduction of fine particles (< 1 um) is possible when co-combusting wood pellets with peat pellets in <b>grate</b> <b>fired</b> boilers. When 10 wt % peat {{was added to the}} wood/peat fuel mixture the fraction of fine particles was significantly decreased (about half of that emitted during pure softwood pellet combustion). The fine particles were for all fuel types/mixtures dominated by potassium, chlorine, sulfur, sodium and zinc. The result from this work therefore shows that a significant reduction of fine particle alkali is possible when co-combusting wood pellets with peat. The results from the thermo-chemical calculations suggest that a significant share of the potassium is retained in the bottom ash as a K rich silicate slag and as KAlSi 2 O 6 (s) (Leucite) when co-combusting sawdust with peat.

40|$|The <b>grate</b> <b>firing</b> {{system is}} one of the most common ways for the {{combustion}} of biomass because it is able to burn a broad range of fuels with only little or even no requirement for fuel preparation. In order to improve the fuel combustion efficiency, it is important to understand the details of the thermochemical process in such furnaces. However, the process is very complex due to many involved physical and chemical phenomena such as drying, pyrolysis, char combustion, gas phase reaction, two phase flow and many more. The main objective of this work is to study precisely the involved processes in biomass combustion on a forward acting grate and provide a detailed insight into the local and global conversion phenomena. For this purpose, XDEM as an Euler-Lagrange model is used, in which the fluid phase is a continuous phase and each particle is tracked with a Lagrangian approach.

Very good agreements between simulation and measurement have been achieved, proving the ability of the model to predict the biomass combustion under study on the grate. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Within the {{framework}} of EU-Life+ research project MARSS (Material Advanced Recovery Sustainable Systems) the outlet stream of a mechanical-biological treatment plant for the processing of mixed municipal solid waste is further processed to produce RRBF (Refined Renewable Biomass Fuel). The material is dry and has (very) small particle sizes below 40 mm, which {{makes it impossible to}} be burnt in standard <b>grate</b> <b>firing</b> systems. The main purpose was to examine whether RRBF is a suitable fuel for bubbling fluidized bed combustion for the decentralised production of combined heat and power. RRBF was fed into a bubbling fluidized bed combustion plant with a nominal fuel input of 100 kW in 3 combustion test runs. Proximate and ultimate analyses were performed for original RRBF and fly ash. The fuel analysis showed high ash contents between 25 and 37 weight-%, while the lower heating value lay in the range of 10. 5 â€“ 12. 9 MJ/kg. The ash softening temperature was above 1. 150 Â°C and therefore no bed agglomeration was observed. Combustion at around 900 Â°C could be maintained even without preheating of the combustion air. The carbon content of the fly ash was below 1 %, which indicates complete combustion in the bubbling fluidized bed with sufficient residence time. The content of phosphorous in the fly ash was above 1 % and therefore this is an interesting material for prospective phosphorous recovery, potentially together with sewage sludge or ash from sewage sludge combustion. RRBF is a suitable solid fuel for fluidized bed combustion...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is a {{comparison}} of different kinds of flue gas cleaning systems of municipal solid waste incinerators (MSWI). This comparison will be done with the aid of material flow analysis. In addition, investment costs will be taken into consideration. The main topic of the investigation is the relationship between type of flue gas cleaning system and resulting material flow including auxiliary chemicals and solid residues. Material flow analyses are performed by model calculations. Data used for these calculations are representative of operating values for technical-scale plants. As starting point a model plant with <b>grate</b> <b>firing</b> is considered. For this plant 10 different flue gas cleaning systems are analysed, 6 of them being equipped with a wet cleaning system. Additionally, 2 systems operating in a semi dry sorption and 2 systems operating in conditioned dry sorption are taken into account. The system boundaries for the material flow analysis performed include the entire flue gas cleaning system, starting with the raw gas downstream of the boiler and ending downstream of the stack. The elements chlorine (Cl), sulfur (S), mercury (Hg), cadmium and lead are considered. As a result of this work, two flue gas cleaning concepts seem to be very interesting for the construction of new plants: A plant with a wet flue gas cleaning system equipped with fabric filter followed by a two-stage scrubber system generates small amounts of residues by low investment costs. Moreover, semi dry sorption seems to be a respectable alternative, but this study shows that the operation of the semi dry sorption can be optimized. (orig.)

40|$|This work {{concerns}} log firing in small-scale boilers for house heating, {{which in}} Sweden meets a heat demand of 12 TWh a year. In boilers used for domestic central heating in {{the sizes of}} 10 to 30 kW the predominant combustion technique is <b>grate</b> <b>firing.</b> Prediction of the transient release of combustible gas from the log-fire in such boilers enables an optimised design of the combustion chamber to minimise emissions of unburnt and harmful emissions. The release of gas is governed by the heating of each log of wood. The heat flux to a log is given by {{the design of the}} furnace and by the surrounding logs. Exposure of a log to a heat flux will lead to evaporation of water (drying) and then to thermal degradation (pyrolysis) of the wood into volatiles (about 80 %) and char (about 20 %). Subsequently these constituents will burn. In order to predict the release of gas from a log of wood under combustion conditions, drying and pyrolysis of one log of wood, idealised to a cylinder, are studied. The complex heating situation in a log-fire in a small-scale boiler is simplified to a constant furnace wall temperature. The progress of drying and pyrolysis was monitored from measurements of interior temperature distribution and mass loss. The heat transfer properties of wood and charcoal were investigated. Based on comparison of measured data and simulations, using a numerical model, the applicability of measured thermal properties, the submodel of pyrolysis and the anisotropy of wood permeability are discussed. The results suggest that modelling of drying and pyrolysis of thermally thick wood particles should include: The structural changes during pyrolysis causing growth of pores, formation of cracks and global shrinkage of the sample. A pyrolysis reaction mechanism that accurately predicts initiation of pyrolysis at slow heating rates, such as in the particle's interior. Drying governed by the liquid permeability in the longitudinal fibre direction at moisture contents above the fibre saturation point. Instant, non-thermal equilibrium release of gas from the particle at temperatures above 400 Â°C (after pyrolysis). Due to the structural changes in conjunction with uncertainties in literature on thermal properties of wood and charcoal, it is recommended to use a simple approach, for instance, of constant thermal diffusivity. The application of {{the results of this study}} to other types of thermally thick wood particles needs data on thermal properties of wood and charcoal coupled to the structural variations in such particles...|$|E
40|$|The biomass pellet consumption, {{both in the}} {{industry}} and in residential appliances, has increased during the latest years and this is expected to continue. In order to handle the demand, more ash rich (> 0, 5 wt-%) raw materials have been introduced as energy wood and other forest based fuels. In connection with this, ash related problems as fouling, slagging and corrosion have occurred. However introduction of peat as a co-combustion fuel {{has turned out to}} have positive effects on these problems. Earlier research shows that introduction of peat into biomass results in reduced bed agglomeration, fouling and corrosion. Nevertheless the previous works has mainly focused on fluidized bed boilers with bed agglomeration and deposit formation in focus. Experimental work in small and residential combustion appliances is still scarce (e. g. in <b>grate</b> <b>firing</b> boilers and burnerâ€™s). In this work the influence of peat addition to biomass pellets on combustion characteristics here defined in terms of slagging characteristics, operational maintenance, gaseous- and particulate emissions in residential appliances, were determined. Six peat samples representing a broad variation in ash forming matter of Scandinavian peats were chosen in this study. They were co-pelletized with sawdust, energy wood, forest residue as well as wheat straw and combusted in a P-labeled underfed commercial pellet burner (15 kW) installed in a reference boiler. The NO and SO 2 emissions were generally higher when introducing peat. However these emissions are both fuel and combustion specific and the increment has not been further investigated to conclude its origin. The particle emissions were in all cases totally dominated by fine (< 1 Î¼m) particles and contained high concentrations of K. When adding peat containing high amounts of Si and/or clay minerals into the wood derived fuels a clear reduction of emitted fine particles were shown. The likely mechanism is that the reactive Si and/or the clay minerals from the peat react with K vapor from the biomass forming K-silicates that will stay in the coarse ash fractions, hence capturing the K. The reduction was most obvious for the biomasses short in reactive Si as sawdust and forest residue. In fact a K reduction of up to 70 % was shown when adding a Si- or clay-rich peat to forest residue. However, when adding a peat with low ash content and high Ca content the reduction was diminished. It was further shown that addition of peat to the K and Si rich wheat straw did not generally affect the reduction of fine particle- and deposit forming K i. e. only a dilution effect of ash forming matter occurred. The slagging tendency was increased in all cases when peat was introduced hence also the operational maintenance was disturbed. However, great differences between different peat assortments existed in this aspect. High Si together with low Ca contents in the peat resulted in the most severe slagging, whereas a peat with higher Ca/Si ratio gave a significant lower slagging tendency. The sawdust was generally more affected by the peat addition than the other studied biofuels. In order to receive a considerable particle reduction in parallel with a manageable slagging tendency when using "problematic" biomass fuels in small scale burners and grate boilers, co-combustion with a carex based peat with a high ash content and relatively high Ca/Si ratio is suggested.

40|$|This {{parametric}} {{study shows}} that thermal radiation from particles, fly ash and char, can be highly relevant for estimating the radiative heat flux to surfaces in <b>grate</b> <b>fired</b> furnaces, especially to the hot bed. The large effects of particle radiative heat transfer come from cases with municipal solid waste (MSW) as fuel whereas biomass cases have moderate effect on the overall:radiative heat transfer.

The investigations were conducted in a 3 -D rectangular environment with a fixed temperature field, and homogeneous distribution of gases and particles. The choice of boundary emissivity was found to be much more or equally important as the particle radiation effects, dependent if biomass or MSW, respectively, was used as the fuel. The effect of particle radiation increased with increasing furnace size, mostly evident in the change of the radiative source term and the heat flux to the bed.

40|$|Thermal {{radiation}} {{is an important}} physical phenomenon in combustion environments. For the understanding of existing- and the design of new combustion environments computational modelling is a useful tool as it can describe the different transport phenomena. This thesis has focused on studying thermal radiative property models of the participating media, gases and particles. Two specific combustion environments have also been studied, from a thermal radiation perspective. The focus is on radiative property models that are useful specifically for engineering purposes. These property models are often developed from more advanced spectral models by means of correlative or other methods to simplify {{the treatment of the}} radiative transfer. One such model is the non-correlated statistical narrow band (SNB) model, which drops spectral relation between intensity and transmissivity, which is used in the correlated SNB model. By doing so a significant decrease in computational demand can be achieved. The accuracy of this model has been questioned in the literature although it has been suggested as an appropriate option for sooty environments. The assessment of the model revealed that it only gives good predictions in large geometries and highly sooty environments. Because of the modelâ€™s limited applicability and a still rather high computational demand it is not recommended for use even in sooty environments. A simpler model, and computationally much faster, called the weighted sum of gray gas (WSGG) model accompanied the assessment of the non-correlated SNB model. The WSGG model was shown to be a better choice than the non-correlated SNB model in sooty environments. A gray gas property model was compared with a WSGG model in combustion environments resembling the ones found in <b>grate</b> <b>fired</b> furnaces. In these environments, which also contains particles, the gray model was shown to give predictions of wall heat flux in close agreement with the WSGG model. This shows how the simplest model, which the gray model is, can sometimes be a suitable choice, especially when particles are present. Particle property models were evaluated in various combustion environments. A common approach is to use Planck mean coefficients to represent the particle properties. The use of Planck mean coefficients for fly-ash particles, common in furnaces combusting solid fuels, is shown to give large errors in prediction of both radiative heat flux and the source term in particular. The two investigated combustion environments are those found in <b>grate</b> <b>fired</b> furnaces and environments with high CO mole fraction. The <b>grate</b> <b>fired</b> furnace was studied in both modelling- and measurement work. Specifically the importance of particle radiation was investigated in the <b>grate</b> <b>fired</b> combustion environment. A preliminary study of the <b>grate</b> <b>fired</b> furnace was a parametric study. The parameters investigated were different particles originating from combustion of biomass and municipal solid waste, different furnace size, and boundary emissivities. The most significant effect on the overall radiative heat transfer is that of particles from municipal solid waste; moderate effects are seen when particles come from biomass. Increased furnace size most affected the heat flux to the hot bed and source term compared with a case without any particles. The choice of emissivity can be as important as considering particles or not. The measurement and modelling work were carried out on a 400 kW <b>grate</b> <b>fired</b> furnace combusting biomass. The boundary temperatures, flue gas temperature, gas mole fraction, particle mass-size distribution, and wall irradiation were measured. A so-called indirect wall irradiation was retrieved when the furnace was modelled with the implemented measured parameters. This indirect wall irradiation was compared with the directly measured wall irradiation. The study revealed that particle {{radiation is}} very important in the evaluated furnace, it doubles the wall irradiation in the hot flame zone compared with irradiation only from gases. The CO contribution to the total directional radiation was studied in environments with high mole fractions of CO, often found in gasifiers. CO is normally disregarded in environments where the fuel is fully oxidised, as it is a weak radiating species and small mole fractions of CO exist in these types of environments. The evaluation reveal that disregarding CO is still a good approach even in gasifier environments. These environments still contain small volume fractions of CO 2 and H 2 O, which compared with CO are much stronger radiators. The rotational-vibrational bands of these two species overlaps the important fundamental band of CO reducing the importance of CO to the total directional radiative heat flux...|$|R
