5|$|Extant strepsirrhines have an epitheliochorial placenta, {{where the}} {{maternal}} blood {{does not come}} in <b>direct</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> fetal chorion like {{it does in the}} hemochorial placenta of haplorhines. The strepsirrhine uterus has two distinct chambers (bicornuate). Despite having similar gestation periods to comparably sized haplorhines, fetal growth rates are generally slower in strepsirrhines, which results in newborn offspring that are as little as one-third the size of haplorhine newborns. Extant strepsirrhines also have a lower basal metabolic rate, which elevates in females during gestation, putting greater demands on the mother.|$|E

5|$|The insect {{circulatory system}} {{utilizes}} hemolymph, a tissue analogous to blood that circulates {{in the interior}} of the insect body, while remaining in <b>direct</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> animal's tissues. It is composed of plasma in which hemocytes are suspended. In addition to hemocytes, the plasma also contains many chemicals. It is also the major tissue type of the open circulatory system of arthropods, characteristic of spiders, crustaceans and insects.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} parasites {{can affect the}} lungs, {{including}} Toxoplasma gondii, Strongyloides stercoralis, Ascaris lumbricoides, and Plasmodium malariae. These organisms typically enter the body through <b>direct</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> skin, ingestion, or via an insect vector. Except for Paragonimus westermani, most parasites do not affect specifically the lungs but involve the lungs secondarily to other sites. Some parasites, in particular those belonging to the Ascaris and Strongyloides genera, stimulate a strong eosinophilic reaction, which may result in eosinophilic pneumonia. In other infections, such as malaria, lung involvement is due primarily to cytokine-induced systemic inflammation. In the developed world these infections are most common in people returning from travel or in immigrants. Around the world, these infections are most common in the immunodeficient.|$|E
5|$|At {{its maximum}} extent, Tang {{expansion}} brought China into <b>direct</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> rising Umayyad Caliphate. China's western borders reached the eastern frontier of the Caliphate. Following the Arab defeat of Sassanid Persia in 651, the Caliphate began its expansion into Central Asia, {{competing with the}} Tang's sphere of influence in the region. Chinese and Islamic troops finally clashed at the Battle of Talas in 751. The Chinese lost against the Arabs, now under Abbasid rule, and the Arab army captured Chinese papermaking craftsmen. An Arabic record of the conflict claims that the battle led {{to the introduction of}} papermaking to the Islamic world.|$|E

5|$|During osmoregulation, fluid {{is added}} to the pericardia of the branchial hearts. The octopus has two nephridia (equivalent to {{vertebrate}} kidneys) which are associated with the branchial hearts; these and their associated ducts connect the pericardial cavities with the mantle cavity. Before reaching the branchial heart, each branch of the vena cava expands to form renal appendages which are in <b>direct</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> thin-walled nephridium. The urine is first formed in the pericardial cavity, and is modified by excretion, chiefly of ammonia, and selective absorption from the renal appendages, as it is passed along the associated duct and through the nephridiopore into the mantle cavity.|$|E
5|$|Looms {{were not}} {{controlled}} by the guilds. Dependent on a migrant workforce, their commercial activity was driven by entrepreneurs, who were usually painters. The entrepreneur would locate and commission patrons, hold a stock of cartoons and provide raw materials such as wool, silk, and sometimes gold and silver – which often had to be imported. The entrepreneur was in <b>direct</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> patron, and they would often go through the nuances of the design at both the cartoon and final stages. This examination was often a difficult business and necessitated delicate management; in 1400 Isabeau of Bavaria rejected a completed set by Colart de Laon having earlier approved the designs, to de Laon's – and presumably his commissioner's – considerable embarrassment.|$|E
5|$|RNAi in vivo {{delivery}} to tissues still eludes science—especially to tissues {{deep within the}} body. RNAi delivery is only easily accessible to surface tissues such as the eye and respiratory tract. In these instances, siRNA {{has been used in}} <b>direct</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> tissue for transport. The resulting RNAi successfully focused on target genes. When delivering siRNA to deep tissues, the siRNA must be protected from nucleases, but targeting specific areas becomes the main difficulty. This difficulty has been combatted with high dosage levels of siRNA to ensure the tissues have been reached, however in these cases hepatotoxicity was reported.|$|E

5|$|Stephen I granted {{privileges}} to the Roman Catholic Church, {{for example}} by ordering the general {{imposition of the}} tithe upon the population. Burials in most local pre-Christian cemeteries, for example at Hunedoara, only ceased around 1100. Stephen I also divided his kingdom, including the territories of modern Romania he had occupied, into counties, that is administrative units around royal fortresses, each administered by a royal official called count. In time the voivode, a higher royal official first attested in 1176, became the principal of all the counts in Transylvania. In contrast with Transylvania, the counts in modern Banat and Crişana remained in <b>direct</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> king who appointed and replaced them at will.|$|E
5|$|The spells of the Book of the Dead {{made use}} of several magical {{techniques}} which {{can also be seen}} in other areas of Egyptian life. A number of spells are for magical amulets, which would protect the deceased from harm. In addition to being represented on a Book of the Dead papyrus, these spells appeared on amulets wound into the wrappings of a mummy. Everyday magic {{made use of}} amulets in huge numbers. Other items in <b>direct</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> body in the tomb, such as headrests, were also considered to have amuletic value. A number of spells also refer to Egyptian beliefs about the magical healing power of saliva.|$|E

5|$|Allan Cunningham sent seed of G.juniperina to England in 1820; it {{was grown}} there the {{following}} year. Baron Charles von Hügel grew the species in Vienna in 1831. It has been grown outdoors in southern England, particularly G. juniperina subspecies sulphurea. Grevillea juniperina adapts easily to cultivation and {{grows in a}} wide range of soils and aspects in locations with good drainage. Long-flowering, it attracts birds such as honeyeaters with its nectar. The prickly dense foliage is also a good nesting site and shelter, particularly for smaller birds, such as finches. Many forms and hybrids have been commercially propagated and sold, some having more horticultural appeal than others. Low winter temperatures promote more prolific flowering and pruning promotes dense foliage. Plants are readily propagated by cuttings or seed, although propagation by cuttings is required to ensure the new plants have the same characteristics of the parent. <b>Direct</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> plant may cause a skin rash.|$|E
5|$|An-Nasir Ahmad {{was known}} to be a seclusive sultan, {{surrounding}} himself with his coterie of supporters from al-Karak, rarely making <b>direct</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Mamluk emirs of Egypt and avoiding the public view. Two months into his reign, he relocated to al-Karak with substantial sums from the treasury and several horses and senior administrative officials. He ruled from the desert fortress, leaving a deputy, Emir Aqsunqur al-Salari, to oversee affairs in Egypt on his behalf. His unorthodox rule, alleged frivolity, and his execution of loyal partisans, namely Tashtamur and Qutlubugha, led to an-Nasir Ahmad being deposed from the sultanate by his half-brother, as-Salih Isma'il. He remained in the fortress of al-Karak, which the Mamluks besieged at least seven times, until being captured in July 1344. He was killed later that month on the orders of as-Salih Isma'il.|$|E
5|$|Byzantine {{churches are}} not the only source of {{inspiration}} that researchers attribute to the Round Church. Some scholars link its design to an Armenian influence, perhaps brought to Bulgaria by craftsmen from the Caucasus. In general, churches with such an antiquated plan in the Balkans are associated with the migration of Cappadocian, Armenian, or Georgian monks. Another possible model for the Round Church in Preslav may well be found in Carolingian architecture from the time of Charlemagne, and particularly the Palatine Chapel in Aachen, western Germany, with which it shares some characteristics. At the time of the Round Church's construction, Bulgaria was in <b>direct</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Frankish Empire. One trait of the Round Church that is claimed by scholars to be a very recognisable Carolingian influence is the presence of a monumental westwork.|$|E
50|$|Arsaces, the {{chieftain}} of the nomadic (Dahae) {{tribe of}} the Parni, fled before him into Parthia and there defeated and killed Andragoras, the former satrap and self-proclaimed king of Parthia, {{and became the}} founder of the Parthian Empire (Strabo l.c.). The Greco-Bactrians became cut from <b>direct</b> <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Greek world. Overland trade continued at a reduced rate, while sea trade between Greek Egypt and Bactria developed. When Seleucus II in 239 BC attempted to subjugate the rebels in the east, it appears he and Diodotus united together against the Parthians (Justin xli. 4, 9).|$|R
40|$|Ten {{years after}} its creation, the {{ombudsman}} institution (Defensor del Pueblo) appears to have carved out an important position for itself in the turbulent political and administrative life of Bolivia. This paper inquires into the reasons for its successes (and failures) in ensuring compliance with its resolutions among {{the institutions of the}} Bolivian state. In this regard, the essay tests three theoretical propositons of how accountability and compliance are constructed; indirectly through the actions of third parties in the state, indirectly through pressure from non-state actors, or in <b>direct</b> <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> targeted institutions. Drawing on a mix of statistical material and interviews with key staff at the institution, this essay argues that compliance primarily seems to be achieved through close <b>direct</b> <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> concerned bureaucrats and entities. This finding contrasts <b>with</b> views on <b>the</b> ombudsman which stress its relative powerlessness and its need to rely on third parties in state or society to ensure compliance. 1. Apart from my academic affiliation, I work for Swedish development cooperation (Sida) in La Paz. The Defensor del Pueblo is one of the institutions supported by Swedish funds in Bolivia. I am not in charge of that contribution, however, and although I would like to state it for the record, I do not believe that this had led me t...|$|R

5|$|Ernst Lindemann was {{frustrated}} by the fact that—as commander of the Naval Gunnery School—he would never come into <b>direct</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> enemy. When he received the news {{that he had been}} selected to be the first commander of the battleship , he was honoured by the trust that had been bestowed on him but doubted that {{he would be able to}} get Bismarck ready for action before the war was over. His doubts suggest that he was confident the war would end in a favourable outcome for Germany by mid-1940. Prior to commanding Bismarck, Lindemann had never held any shipboard command, a situation rare if not unique in the Kriegsmarine. Nevertheless, Lindemann had served exclusively on ships with a gun calibre of at least , and he was Germany's leading gunnery expert. In 1940, he ranked second out of Crew 1913 and was considered an outstanding leader.|$|E
5|$|After the {{effective}} {{completion of the}} evacuation, {{the mandate of the}} British forces began to expand. They assisted with the evacuation of besieged peacekeepers—including several British ceasefire observers—and began to assist the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) and the Sierra Leone Army (SLA). Despite the mission expansion, it was not until 17 May that British soldiers came into <b>direct</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> RUF. The rebels attacked a British position near Lungi airport, but were forced to retreat after a series of firefights. On the same day, the RUF's leader, Foday Sankoh, was captured by Sierra Leonean forces, leaving the RUF in disarray. After deciding that the RUF would not disarm voluntarily, the British began training the SLA for a confrontation. During the training mission, a patrol returning from a visit to Jordanian peacekeepers was taken captive by a militia group known as the West Side Boys. Negotiations achieved the release of five of the eleven soldiers, and three weeks into the crisis, British special forces launched a mission codenamed Operation Barras, freeing the remaining six. The success of Operation Barras restored confidence in the British mission; one academic suggested that its failure would have forced the British government to withdraw all its forces from Sierra Leone.|$|E
5|$|The {{bald eagle}} {{is a sacred}} bird in some North American cultures, and its feathers, {{like those of the}} golden eagle, are central to many {{religious}} and spiritual customs among Native Americans. Eagles are considered spiritual messengers between gods and humans by some cultures. Many pow wow dancers use the eagle claw as part of their regalia as well. Eagle feathers are often used in traditional ceremonies, particularly in the construction of regalia worn and as a part of fans, bustles and head dresses. In the Navajo Tradition an Eagle feather is represented to be a Protector, along with the Feather Navajo Medicine Man use the leg and wing bones for ceremonial whistles. The Lakota, for instance, give an eagle feather as a symbol of honor to person who achieves a task. In modern times, it may be given on an event such as a graduation from college. The Pawnee considered eagles as symbols of fertility because their nests are built high off the ground and because they fiercely protect their young. The Choctaw considered the bald eagle, who has <b>direct</b> <b>contact</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> upper world of the sun, as a symbol of peace.|$|E

40|$|AbstractLoop {{flexibility}} is discussed {{as a factor}} that affects ligand binding affinity of SH 3 domains. To test this hypothesis, we designed a mutant in which a proline in the RT-loop of the human Lck SH 3 -domain is replaced by glycine. The dynamics and ligand binding properties of wild-type and mutant LckSH 3 were studied by fluorescence and NMR spectroscopy as well as molecular dynamics simulations. Although the mutated residue does not form <b>direct</b> <b>contacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> ligand, the mutation increases ligand affinity {{by a factor of}} eight. The mutant exhibits increased loop flexibility and enhanced sampling of binding-competent conformations.
