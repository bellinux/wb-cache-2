5|$|In the Elizabethan era the Lord of the Manor, Sir Christopher Hatton was {{a sponsor}} of Sir Francis Drake's expeditions; Drake renamed {{one of his}} ships the <b>Golden</b> <b>Hind</b> after the heraldic symbol of the Hatton family. A hotel in a Grade II listed {{building}} built in the 17th century, was known variously as the Hind Hotel and later as the <b>Golden</b> <b>Hind</b> Hotel.|$|E
5|$|Among people {{associated}} with Deptford are Christopher Marlowe, who was murdered at Deptford Strand; diarist John Evelyn (1620–1706) {{who lived at}} Sayes Court, and had Peter the Great (1672–1725) as a guest for about three months in 1698; and Sir Francis Drake who was knighted by Queen Elizabeth I aboard the <b>Golden</b> <b>Hind</b> in Deptford Docks.|$|E
5|$|The medical faculties of Charles University in Prague {{also have}} a pelican as their emblem. The symbol of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service is a pelican, {{and for most of}} its {{existence}} the headquarters of the service was located at Pelican House in Dublin, Ireland. The heraldic pelican also ended up as a pub name and image, though sometimes with the image of the ship <b>Golden</b> <b>Hind.</b> Sir Francis Drake's famous ship was initially called Pelican, and adorned the British halfpenny coin.|$|E
50|$|In the hills, the <b>Golden</b> <b>Hinds</b> {{are being}} {{wiped out by}} Zeus, fearing their god-killing blood. Serena comes upon the scene in Hind form, and is changed into human form by Ares to save her. He and Strife had been {{watching}} the destruction nearby, and decided to save her so they could use her. Hercules sees all this, and is noticed by Ares, who just laughs.|$|R
60|$|Hoping that Captain Winter had sailed north, the <b>Golden</b> <b>Hind's</b> {{head was}} turned in that direction, with great {{hope that they}} might meet her in {{latitude}} 30 degrees; which had been before appointed {{as a place of}} rendezvous, should the fleet happen to be separated. Touching at many points, they inquired everywhere of the natives, but could hear no word of any ship having been seen before.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, at Ares' temple, Hercules {{finds the}} god {{watching}} a confused Serena. Ares notices his half-brother looks older, and guesses he is a time-traveller. He reveals {{he wants to}} keep her around without Zeus knowing, but Hercules reminds him if Zeus finds out, he won't be spared the wrath. Near the temple path, Serena finds an injured hunter and his brother. She uses her healing powers on him, and when asked what happened, they revealed they were hunting the <b>Golden</b> <b>Hinds.</b> During her outrage, a hunter touches her and she changes into the Hind. Before anything can happen, Hercules saves her. Not sure what to tell her, he tries to convince her she doesn't need Ares. Confused, she runs away. In the woods, she is shot by an arrow. Ares comes up and helps her, and wants her to stay with him so he can teach her to defend herself. She mentions Hercules, and the god stifles his anger, telling her he will be there if she wants his help.|$|R
25|$|To {{maintain}} his dwindling wealth, Hatton began investing {{in some of}} the voyages of Francis Drake. He helped fund Drake's acts of piracy in Spanish America. During Drake's subsequent circumnavigation of the globe, when he reached the straits of Magellan, he renamed his ship The <b>Golden</b> <b>Hind</b> in honour of Hatton's coat of arms, which contained a <b>golden</b> <b>hind,</b> and of and all the Spanish gold on board. Hatton made a profit of £2300 from this particular expedition.|$|E
25|$|He also edited, with Austin Osman Spare, <b>Golden</b> <b>Hind,</b> {{an artistic}} and {{literary}} magazine that appeared from October 1922 to July 1924.|$|E

6000|$|O FAIR is Love's first hope to gentle mind! [...] As Eve's first star thro' fleecy cloudlet peeping; [...] And {{sweeter than}} the gentle {{south-west}} wind. [...] O'er willowy meads, and shadow'd waters creeping, [...] And Ceres' <b>golden</b> fields;--the sultry <b>hind</b> [...] 5 [...] Meets it with brow uplift, and stays his reaping.|$|R
25|$|Queen Elizabeth I knighting Sir Francis Drake {{aboard the}} <b>Golden</b> <b>Hind</b> in 1588 (an {{apocryphal}} scene as {{the ceremony was}} performed by the ambassador from France—in the Queen's presence).|$|E
25|$|The English {{explorer}} and privateer Francis Drake sailed {{south along}} the coast of northern California in 1579 after capturing two Spanish treasure ships in the Pacific. It is believed Drake put ashore somewhere north of San Francisco, where the <b>Golden</b> <b>Hind</b> underwent extensive repairs and accumulated needed supplies for a trip across the Pacific. Leaving California, he completed the second recorded circumnavigation of the world (after Ferdinand Magellan) in 1580.|$|E
25|$|The plot {{joins the}} legend at the exile of prince Rama from his father's court, {{at the behest}} of his father's {{favorite}} queen, Kaikeyi. Having earned the right to any single favor by saving the king's life, Kaikeyi attempts to secure her own son's inheritance over the eldest and favorite, Rama, by ordering him banished from the court. Sita, Rama's wife, determines to accompany her beloved husband, although the woods are dangerous and overrun with demons and evil spirits. The demon king Ravana, encouraged by his spiteful ogress sister, hears of Sita's beauty and determines to kidnap her. He sends a <b>golden</b> <b>hind</b> past their dwelling to distract Rama, who tries to impress Sita by hunting the hind into the woods. In his absence, Ravana abducts Sita and demands that she submit to him on pain of death. Sita remains staunchly devoted to Rama and refuses to entertain the idea; Ravana sets a deadline for the ultimatum and Sita waits faithfully for Rama to rescue her.|$|E
25|$|For {{instance}} the Letters Patent granting Arms to the University of Plymouth were presented by Eric Dancer, CBE, JP, Lord Lieutenant of Devon, {{in a ceremony}} at the University on 27 November 2008, {{in the presence of}} Henry Paston-Bedingfeld, York Herald of the College of Arms, the Lord Mayor and Lady Mayoress of Plymouth, Judge William Taylor, the Recorder of Plymouth, and Baroness Wilcox. The books represent the University's focus on learning and scholarship. The scattering of small stars represents navigation, which has {{played a key role in}} the history of the city and the university. The scallop shells in gold represent pilgrimage, a sign of the importance of the departure of the Pilgrim Fathers from the Barbican aboard the Mayflower in 1620. A Pelican and a <b>Golden</b> <b>Hind</b> support the shield and reflect both the original and later, better known, name of Sir Francis Drake's ship. The crest contains the Latin motto Indagate Fingite Invenite ('Explore Dream Discover'), a quote from Mark Twain, reflecting the university's ambitions for its students and Plymouth's history of great seafarers.|$|E
2500|$|The {{significance}} of Deptford to English maritime strength was highlighted when Elizabeth I knighted Francis Drake at the dockyard in 1581 after his circumnavigation {{of the globe}} aboard the <b>Golden</b> <b>Hind.</b> She ordered that the <b>Golden</b> <b>Hind</b> be moored in Deptford Creek for public exhibition, where the ship remained until the 1660s before rotting away and being broken up. The dockyard {{is one of the}} locations associated with the story of Sir Walter Raleigh laying his cloak before Elizabeth's feet. Deptford's significant role during this and later periods resulted in it being termed the [...] "Cradle of the Navy." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the roof}} of the chapel, {{standing}} on the pinnacles, and also on pinnacles on the sides, are seventy-six heraldic statues representing the Queen's (or King's) Beasts. They represent fourteen of the heraldic animals: the lion of England, the red dragon of Wales, the panther of Jane Seymour, the falcon of York, the black bull of Clarence, the yale of Beaufort, the white lion of Mortimer, the greyhound of Richmond, the white hart of Richard II, the collared silver antelope of Bohun, the black dragon of Ulster, the white swan of Hereford, the unicorn of Edward III and the <b>golden</b> <b>hind</b> of Kent.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was just}} nightfall when the English ship entered the harbor, where thirty Spanish vessels were lying, all {{prepared}} for defense The <b>Golden</b> <b>Hind</b> entered the port and dropped her anchor in the midst; and the quiet resolution and confidence, which this act betrayed, struck such a panic into {{the minds of}} the Spanish captains, that not one dared be the first to fire a gun at the intruder. Half an hour after the <b>Golden</b> <b>Hind</b> came to anchor, a boat was seen approaching, and was met by the hail, [...] "Who goes there?" ...|$|E
60|$|The 15th of February, {{the date}} {{upon which the}} <b>Golden</b> <b>Hind</b> arrived {{at the port of}} Lima, was indeed one to be remembered {{throughout}} the lives of the rescued seamen. Their future had appeared well-nigh hopeless. On the one side, the dungeon of the Inquisition and probably a death by fire. On the other, a life passed in the midst of savages, away from all possibility of ever rejoining their friends, or returning to their country. Now they were once again among those delighted to see them, and proudly trod the decks of the <b>Golden</b> <b>Hind</b> as gentlemen adventurers, having a good share in the booty, {{as well as in the}} honor, which would accrue to all on board.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{brother is}} well, Mr. Gilbert. The <b>Golden</b> <b>Hind</b> is {{gone on to}} Dartmouth, with Mr. Hayes. I came ashore here, meaning to go north to Bideford, ere I went to London. I called at Drake's just now, but he was away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... * The Raleigh, {{the largest}} ship of the squadron, was of only [...] 200 tons burden; The <b>Golden</b> <b>Hind,</b> Hayes' ship, which [...] {{returned}} safe, of 40; and The Squirrel (whereof more [...] hereafter), of 10 tons! In such cockboats did these old [...] heroes brave the unknown seas.|$|E
6000|$|... "The <b>Golden</b> <b>Hind,</b> sir, {{the vessel}} {{in which we}} were gentlemen adventurers, rounded Cape Horn, sailed up the American coast, and then, keeping west, crossed through the islands; and has, we trust, long since rounded the Cape of Good Hope and arrived in England, having circumnavigated the globe." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was too hot}} to {{run about}} in the open, so Dan asked their friend, old Hobden, to take their own dinghy from the pond and {{put her on the}} brook {{at the bottom of the}} garden. Her painted name was the Daisy, but for {{exploring}} expeditions she was the <b>Golden</b> <b>Hind</b> or the Long Serpent, or some such suitable name. Dan hiked and howked with a boat-hook (the brook was too narrow for sculls), and Una punted with a piece of hop-pole. When they came to a very shallow place (the <b>Golden</b> <b>Hind</b> drew quite three inches of water) they disembarked and scuffled her over the gravel by her tow-rope, and when they reached the overgrown banks beyond the garden they pulled themselves up stream by the low branches.|$|E
6000|$|... "The same Monday, {{about twelve}} of the clock, or not long after, the frigate (the Squirrel) being ahead {{of us in the}} <b>Golden</b> <b>Hind,</b> {{suddenly}} her lights were out; and withal our watch cried, the general was cast away, which was true; for in that moment the frigate was devoured and swallowed up of the sea." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{following}} day they hove the anchor and sailed northwards. In the port they had obtained news that, {{on the evening}} before they arrived, a ship laden with much treasure from Panama had appeared, but receiving news of {{the approach of the}} English, had again set sail. All determined that, if possible, the treasures on board the Cacafuego should pass into the hold of the <b>Golden</b> <b>Hind.</b>|$|E
60|$|It {{turned out}} to be an island of about a mile in length, so far as they could judge. A reef of coral ran round it. The center of the island was {{somewhat}} elevated, and was covered with coconut trees; and it was this, alone, which had enabled it to be seen, from so great a distance, from the deck of the <b>Golden</b> <b>Hind.</b>|$|E
60|$|It {{was with}} great {{pleasure}} {{that they were}} received by the commander. He expressed but little surprise at seeing them; for, as he told them, he made sure {{that sooner or later}} they would arrive, and had given orders that, upon the division of the great sums which had been gained by the <b>Golden</b> <b>Hind</b> on her voyage, their shares should be scrupulously set aside.|$|E
6000|$|... "The <b>Golden</b> <b>Hind</b> {{was four}} days on her journey from Ternate {{to the place}} where she refitted; another two to the spot where she went on the reef. The wind was very light, and her speed was not above five knots an hour. We should be able to paddle back in the course of ten days, and must take {{provisions}} sufficient for that time.|$|E
60|$|The Englishmen, much amused at the ceremony, {{stood at}} a short {{distance}} off. They {{did not wish to}} be recognized by any of the people of Ternate, as it was possible that some English vessels might again come into these seas, and they did not desire that the pleasant remembrance of the visit of the <b>Golden</b> <b>Hind</b> should be obliterated, by the sight of some of its crew in alliance with the Portuguese.|$|E
60|$|The ship, the Maria Pia, {{was a large}} one, far greater, indeed, {{than the}} <b>Golden</b> <b>Hind,</b> and the boys felt that in a {{floating}} castle of this description, their voyage {{ought to be a}} safe and pleasant one. The captain had received instructions to do all in his power to make the voyage agreeable to them. A handsome cabin had been placed at their disposal, and their position on board was altogether an honorable one.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hope that}} it will not be so," [...] Ned said, [...] "for more than story telling depends upon our success. I fear the <b>Golden</b> <b>Hind</b> is fixed fast, and that all the fruits of our {{expedition}} are lost, even if our lives be saved. Everything depends upon the report we may make when we return; and anything that should occur to delay us, or to prevent our bearing back tidings of this place to the admiral, would be bad fortune, indeed." ...|$|E
6000|$|They christened the bay [...] "The Parting of Friends," [...] and the <b>Golden</b> <b>Hind</b> {{was driven}} down again into 55 degrees south latitude. Fresh gales fell upon them and, {{as has been}} said, it was not till October the 28th, after fifty-two days of almost unexampled bad weather, that the sky cleared, {{and they were able}} to renew their journey. They searched the islands in all {{directions}} for their missing friends, and in remembrance of them the admiral gave them the name of the Elizabethedes.|$|E
6000|$|We must feed our sea for a {{thousand}} years, [...] For that is our doom and pride, [...] As it was when they sailed with the <b>Golden</b> <b>Hind</b> [...] Or the wreck that struck last tide-- [...] Or the wreck that lies on the spouting reef [...] Where the ghastly blue-lights flare. [...] If blood be the price of admiralty, [...] If blood be the price of admiralty, [...] If blood be the price of admiralty, [...] Lord God, we ha' bought it fair! ...|$|E
60|$|Except for a {{group of}} islands which they passed the day after sailing west, the <b>Golden</b> <b>Hind</b> saw no more land from the 23rd of July until September 30th, sixty-eight days in all, when they fell in sight of some islands, lying about eight degrees to the northward of the line. As soon as the ship was seen a great number of canoes came out, having in them some four, some six, some fourteen, or even twenty men, {{paddling}} rapidly and bringing cocoas, fish, and fruits.|$|E
60|$|The Cacafuego had {{no thought}} that the solitary ship which was seen {{approaching}} was that of Captain Drake; but taking her for a Spaniard, {{made no effort to}} fly. When, upon her coming close and hailing her to surrender, they discovered their mistake, the captain made a bold fight. Hastily loading his carronades, he poured a volley into the <b>Golden</b> <b>Hind,</b> and did not surrender his ship until one of his masts had fallen by the board, and he himself was wounded. Then, finding further resistance useless, he hauled down his flag.|$|E
60|$|When {{they reached}} Otter Pool the <b>Golden</b> <b>Hind</b> {{grounded}} comfortably on a shallow, and they lay beneath a roof of close green, watching the water trickle over the flood-gates down the mossy brick chute from the mill-stream to the brook. A big trout--the children knew him well--rolled {{head and shoulders}} at some fly that sailed round the bend, while, once in just so often, the brook rose {{a fraction of an}} inch against all the wet pebbles, and they watched the slow draw and shiver of a breath of air through the tree-tops. Then the little voices of the slipping water began again.|$|E
60|$|There {{was palpable}} truth in what Ned said; and the governor, unbending, {{expressed}} his readiness to receive and help them. He then asked {{a few more}} questions about {{the manner in which}} they had become separated from their friends; and seeing no advantage in concealing the truth, and thinking perhaps that it would be well, if an opportunity should offer, that the governor should send a vessel to search among the islands near where the wreck took place, and see if any of the crew had sought refuge there, they told him frankly the circumstances under which they had left the <b>Golden</b> <b>Hind.</b>|$|E
