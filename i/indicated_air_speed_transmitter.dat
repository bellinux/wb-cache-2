This paper reports the TAMDAR sensor performance validation and verification, as flown on board NOAA Lockheed WP- 3 D aircraft. These flight tests were conducted to assess {{the performance of the}} TAMDAR sensor for measurements of temperature, relative humidity, and wind parameters. The ultimate goal was to develop a small low-cost sensor, collect useful meteorological data, downlink the data in near real time, and use the data to improve weather forecasts. The envisioned system will initially be used on regional and package carrier aircraft. The ultimate users of the data are National Centers for Environmental Prediction forecast modelers. Other users include air traffic controllers, flight service stations, and airline weather centers. NASA worked with an industry partner to develop the sensor. Prototype sensors were subjected to numerous tests in ground and flight facilities. As a result of these earlier tests, many design improvements were made to the sensor. The results of tests on a final version of the sensor are the subject of this report. The sensor is capable of measuring temperature, relative humidity, pressure, and icing.

While in a shallow left turn onto a downwind approach heading, the airplane crossed into the vortex trail of a Boeing 727 flying in the same approach pattern about 4 miles ahead. The B- 737 airplane rolled and turned sharply to the left, exited the vortex wake and plunged into the ground. Weather was not a factor in the accident. The airplane was equipped with a 11 + channel digital Flight Data Recorder (FDR) and a multiple channel Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR).

Virtual sensors are normally considered as a relevant component of Fault Detection and Isolation approaches to the Fault Tolerant Control Theory, briefly introduced in the thesis.

40|$|In {{order to}} extend the fatigue life of an aging fleet of aircraft, a. fu 2 l scale air frame fatigue test is {{conducted}} on a representative airframe in the laboratory. For simulating the service loads on the airframe, a spectrum load sequence has {{to be derived from}} the flight parameters recorded in the flight data recording (FDR) system. The data recorded on a magnetic tape is transferred to digital format through an interface along with other parameters that are entered by the pilot, such as weight of aircraft, stores carried, type of sortie, etc. The recorded data has to be "cleaned up" to eliminate electronic disturbance, tape related problems and intern 7 ittent data points. The noise elimination is solely dependent on experience one has developed after looking at the various continuous parameters like Fuel Remainder, Vertical Acceleration (g,), <b>Indicated</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Speed,</b> Mach Number, Barometric Altitude, etc. The permissible minimum and maximum variations within a second, for each of the parameters form the basis for the elimination of noisy data points. The FDR data has an advantage of recording all the parameters synchronously at an equal interval of one second. Hence the vectors of g, and fuel remainder together with take off weight, as recorded by the pilot, can be used to obtain loads taking into account fuel consumption and the stores carried during the sortie. A computer code has been developed for filtering spurious amplitudes/ excursions due to noise recorded on the tape. The 'gv' is the acceleration normal to flight direction, while 'g,' and 'g,' are longitudinal and lateral accelerations; data from a large number of FDR files are then arranged randomly, flight by flight, from which number of exceedings of various 'g' levels were counted to arrive at a 'g' -exceedance curve that is representative of the service load history for the fighter aircraft. Finally, a representative spectrum load sequence was derived through analysis of all these flight parameters, for full scale fatigue testing in the laboratory. (Full paper not available) ...|$|R

40|$|The Italian Aerospace Research Centre (CIRA) is {{carrying}} out a national research project, named TECVOL, which aims at developing relevant technologies for fully autonomous flight of fixed unmanned aerial vehicles, from take-off to landing, including mid-air flight and collision avoidance functionalities. Such technologies are tested in flight {{by means of an}} experimental set-up constituted by a flying platform, named FLARE (Flying Laboratory for Aerospace Researches), and a Ground Control Station (GCS). The flying platform is an experimental ultra light aircraft with designed empty weight of 281 Kg, max take-off weight of 450 Kg, max speed s/l about 218 km/h, cruising speed about 190 km/h, wing area of 13. 2 m 2, wing span of 9. 6 m and maximum engine power of 100 hp. The FLARE vehicle is also equipped with an avionic system able to put in operation the algorithms developed in the TECVOL project, whereas the ground control station is dedicated, and thus suitably equipped, to supervision and on-line setting of the in-flight experiments. All the critical components of the equipment are Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) elements. This paper presents the design, development, integration and flight testing of a low cost air data computer (ADC), developed in the framework of TECVOL project. The main aim of this ADC is to provide accurate and reliable data to the Flight Control System (FCS) during the critical flight phases of take-off and landing. The requirements of the ADC are firstly discussed, because they drove the on board sensors selection. These requirements concern mainly the system size and weight and its performances (in terms of data accuracy, output rate and latency) which are essentially determined by the performances required to the flight control system. The choice to realize a custom air data computer is motivated by the absence of any commercial off the shelf ADC able to fit system requirements, because commercial ADCs are generally designed to provide cockpit information and not to be enslaved to a FCS. The software/hardware architecture of the ADC and its integration on board the flying platform are then described. The algorithms developed to compute air data (i. e., altitudes, true <b>air</b> <b>speed,</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>air</b> <b>speed</b> and Mach number) and to perform model based self-diagnostic of the ADC are also presented.

Flight tests have been performed for in-flight calibration of the air data computer.
