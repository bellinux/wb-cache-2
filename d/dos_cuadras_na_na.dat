5000|$|Written by Vinton Hoover and Avalanche's member Kjetil Rosnes, [...] "Johnny Johnny Come Home" [...] was {{published}} twice : first in late 1988, {{with a red}} cover single, then in March 1989 with a blue one containing a new remix. The refrain is composed of the title repeated eight times and many onomatopoeias ("Na <b>na</b> <b>na</b> <b>na</b> <b>na</b> <b>na</b> <b>na</b> <b>na</b> <b>na</b> <b>na</b> <b>na</b> <b>na</b> <b>na</b> <b>na</b> na"). The song is available on many compilations such as Boulevard des hits volume 8, La Discothèque du XXè siècle - 1988, Nostalgie Classiques 80 and Summer klub80 Volume 2. Two songs with almost the same title, [...] "Johnny Come Home", by Fine Young Cannibals in 1985, then by The Men They Couldn't Hang in 1987, {{are not related to}} Avalanche's one.|$|R

The band arrives in the album's dystopia known as Battery City, stopping in front of BL/ind headquarters.|$|R

5000|$|Upon {{discovery}} of the Killjoys' arrival, BL/ind places their guards on stand-by all around the headquarters. The Killjoys quickly shoot {{their way into the}} building, arriving in the main security center and rescue The Girl (Grace Jeanette), who was previously kidnapped in [...] "Na <b>Na</b> <b>Na</b> (<b>Na</b> <b>Na</b> <b>Na</b> <b>Na</b> <b>Na</b> <b>Na</b> <b>Na</b> <b>Na</b> Na)". During this time, Korse (Grant Morrison) is activated by BL/ind headquarters' head of security and accompanied by reinforcement draculoids and guards to stop the Killjoys. A gunfight between the Killjoys and Korse's minions follows in BL/ind's lobby. At one point, Party Poison (Gerard Way) kills and pulls off the mask of one of the draculoids, discovering him to be Agent Cherri Cola (Jimmy Urine), an ally of the Killjoys (who was captured by BL/ind while trying to infiltrate their headquarters, and turned into a draculoid).|$|R
5000|$|Thus far, [...] "Na <b>Na</b> <b>Na</b> (<b>Na</b> <b>Na</b> <b>Na</b> <b>Na</b> <b>Na</b> <b>Na</b> <b>Na</b> <b>Na</b> Na)" [...] {{has been}} met with {{generally}} positive critical enthusiasm. Spins William Goldman described [...] "Na <b>Na</b> Na" [...] as an [...] "in-your-face punk anthem with blistering guitar leads, an epic breakdown, and Gerard Ways sneering delivery", and added, [...] "its classic MCR and its all hinged on an unforgettable, hockey-arena-filling chorus of <b>na,</b> <b>na,</b> <b>na,</b> <b>na,</b> <b>na,</b> nas". Jason Lipshutz of Billboard called the song a [...] "three-minute punk-rock blast" [...] that [...] "is a startling {{change of pace}} from My Chemical Romances 2006 concept album The Black Parade". NMEs Dan Martin said the song is [...] "rooted {{in the here and}} now, with the most simple pop song refrain rebooted as nothing less than a generational call to arms". Sara D. Anderson of AOL Radio noted, [...] "By the looks of their new single and its paired video teaser, MCR are opting for an effervescent, light-hearted sound compared to their heavier-themed efforts." [...] MTVs Chris Ryan said the song [...] "gets right to the point, exploding out of the gate with an absolutely ferocious riff that could have been ripped right off of an old Stooges album. Singer Gerard Way sounds in fine form, going toe to toe with the guitars".|$|R
5000|$|The {{magazine}} Rolling Stone {{says the}} frontman [...] "dyed his hair fiery red, and he's pissed at everyone: junkies, party girls, Hollywood, {{and most of}} all himself, for getting so damn famous", and that Danger Days is a total rejection of the rock infladísimo celebrity. In the same vein, the song [...] "Na <b>Na</b> <b>Na</b> (<b>Na</b> <b>Na</b> <b>Na</b> <b>Na</b> <b>Na</b> <b>Na</b> <b>Na</b> <b>Na</b> Na)" [...] presents a stand of criticism of consumerist culture of the United States. The magazine Chilango argues that [...] "the letters of the album have elements of science fiction, horror and comics, which helps to create an atmosphere of pop culture that is heard along entire disk". Similarly, claims that the songs [...] "Party Poison", [...] "Vampire Money" [...] and [...] "Planetary (GO!)" [...] show a new side of the band: a fun and partying, previously seen for a moment in the song [...] "Teenagers".|$|R

5000|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Planets" [...] was spread between two songs, [...] "Planets" [...] and [...] "We Dance to a Different Disco, Honey" [...] {{such as in}} My Chemical Romance's songs [...] "Na <b>Na</b> <b>Na</b> (<b>Na</b> <b>Na</b> <b>Na</b> <b>Na</b> <b>Na</b> <b>Na</b> <b>Na</b> <b>Na</b> Na)" [...] and [...] "Sing", and {{features}} the band in a fancy club with people wearing masks, and the members taking the masks off to reveal their identity, also with scenes of a lady torturing another lady by licking her. At {{the end of the}} video the lady being tortured reveals that something is hidden at the place that the band is at. Guitarist/Vocalist Shaun Diviney eventually takes off a statue's mask, revealing a white lady with no mouth. Security guards then block Diviney and the lady's path and captures them. The story is then continued in [...] "We Dance to a Different Disco, Honey". There are also scenes of Short Stack playing a in a large room with flashing purple lights.|$|R
5000|$|Certain songs have {{historically}} been associated with particular sporting events. Fans of the home team at collegiate athletic events may serenade the losing visitors with a song recorded by Steam, titled [...] "Na <b>Na</b> Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye", with its familiar refrain, [...] "na <b>na,</b> <b>na</b> <b>na</b> <b>na</b> <b>na,</b> hey, hey, hey, goodbye." ...|$|R

5000|$|With DeCarlo as lead vocalist, they {{recorded}} {{the song in}} one recording session. Instead of using a full band, Leka played keyboards himself and had engineer Warren Dewey splice together a drum track from one of DeCarlos four singles and a conga drum solo by Ange DiGeronimo recorded in Mr. Lekas Bridgeport, Conn. studio for an entirely different session. [...] "I said we should put a chorus to it (to make it longer)", Leka told Fred Bronson in The Billboard Book of Number One Hits. [...] "I started writing while I {{was sitting at the}} piano going <b>na,</b> <b>na,</b> <b>na,</b> <b>na,</b> <b>na,</b> <b>na,</b> <b>na,</b> <b>na...</b> Everything was <b>na</b> <b>na</b> when you didnt have a lyric." [...] Gary added [...] "hey hey". The group that is seen on the album cover and in the old black and white video was a road group {{that had nothing to do}} with the recording. The road group was lip syncing to DeCarlos vocal in the video.|$|R

5000|$|The album {{starts out}} with [...] "Keep On Bringing Me Down", which Alternative Press {{described}} as a [...] "picture-perfect uptempo pop-punk" [...] song, that deals with a crying out question {{as to why the}} world brings people down. [...] "I Guess You Can Say Things Are Getting Pretty Serious" [...] has been {{described as a}} [...] "high-voltage pop-tune", driven by Cook's addictive vocals and distorted guitars by Caleb Turman and Marc Stewart. [...] "Life of the Party" [...] is an electronic, upbeat, dance-influenced song. [...] "Robots & Aliens" [...] is an upbeat, feel-good song that deals with one waiting for another in a relationship, with AbsolutePunk stating the song could've been a [...] "huge radio hit". Drummer Kyle Burns claimed the song was recorded right before My Chemical Romance's [...] "Na <b>Na</b> <b>Na</b> (<b>Na</b> <b>Na</b> <b>Na</b> <b>Na</b> <b>Na</b> <b>Na</b> <b>Na</b> <b>Na</b> Na)". [...] "King for a Day" [...] is a softer tune, equipped with synth and a catchy chorus, dealing with the wish of being king for a day in order to give a girl anything. [...] "Good Life" [...] is a song that deals with the common subject of desiring the good life.|$|R
