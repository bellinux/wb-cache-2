40|$|Abstract: Determining loadability margins {{to various}} {{security}} limits {{is of great}} importance for the secure operation of a power system, especially in the current deregulated environment. A novel approach is proposed in this paper for fast prediction of loadability margins of power systems based on neural networks. Static security boundaries, comprised of static voltage stability limits,oscillatory stability limits, and other operating limits, such as <b>generator</b> <b>power</b> <b>output</b> limits, are constructed by means of loading the power system until these security limits are reached from a base operating point along various loading directions. Back-propagation neural networks for different contingencies are trained to approximate the security boundaries.

The simulation results for the IEEE two-area benchmark system and the IEEE 50 -machine test system demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed method for on-line prediction of loadability margins. ...|$|E
