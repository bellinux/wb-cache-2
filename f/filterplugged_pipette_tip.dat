40|$|Recently, {{our group}} {{reported}} that an any aqueous droplet dispensed from a <b>pipette</b> <b>tip</b> has {{considerable amount of}} electrical charge. This natural electrical charge of a droplet could cause undesired, unfamil-iar experimental results. Since {{the origin of the}} charge of a droplet is related to the <b>pipette</b> <b>tip</b> material, we modified the inside material of the <b>pipette</b> <b>tip</b> with poly(dimethylsiloxane) -graphene nanocomposites. The droplets dispensed from the modified <b>pipette</b> <b>tip</b> has lower elec-trical charge than that from the common <b>pipette</b> <b>tip.</b> We compare the experimental results with the droplets from common <b>pipette</b> <b>tip</b> and modified <b>pipette</b> <b>tip.</b> This fluid dynamics video includes the principle of the spontaneous electrification of the droplet and the results of the droplet in oil experiments. 1 Detailed explanation Our fluid dynamics video includes 4 segments: 1.

The surrounding medium is silicone oil (50 cs). The charge of a DI water droplet dispensed from the <b>pipette</b> <b>tip</b> spontaneously has positive charge and the cell suspension in our experiment has negative charge.

Recently, {{it has been}} also employed {{as a tool to}} deliver stimuli to the cells. In this work we have investigated the mechanical interaction occurring between the <b>pipette</b> <b>tip</b> and the sample during SICM operation. For the purpose, we have built a setup combining SICM with atomic force microscopy (AFM), where the AFM cantilever replaces the sample. Our data indicate that, operating in far-scanning mode with current decrease values below 2 %, no force can be detected, provided that the level of the electrolyte filling the pipette is equal to that determined by the capillary tension. A filling level different from this value determines a hydrostatic pressure, a flux through the <b>pipette</b> <b>tip</b> and detectable forces, even in far-scanning mode. The absolute value of these forces depends on the <b>pipette</b> <b>tip</b> size. Therefore, a possible pitfall when using SICM for cell imaging is to imply zero-force working conditions.

Current-voltage curves showed outward rectification. Single channel currents appeared in cell-attached patches when the <b>pipette</b> <b>tip</b> was perfused with pipette solution containing 0. 5 microM GABA and disappeared when a solution containing 100 microM bicuculline plus 0. 5 microM GABA was injected into the <b>pipette</b> <b>tip.</b> The channels showed outward rectification and, in some patches, had a much lower probability of opening at hyperpolarized potentials.

40|$|Abstract — Reported is a {{study of}} {{applying}} nanofabrication technology to improve the surface roughness of micro glass pipettes to achieve giga ohm seal resistance in patch clamping processes. The surface roughness of <b>pipette</b> <b>tips</b> was first measured by 3 D reconstruction of <b>pipette</b> <b>tips</b> using stereo imaging technique based on high resolution SEM images. Both the SEM images and the reconstructed images show that micro glass pipettes have rough and uneven tips which {{could be one of}} the causes of leakage in patch clamping. Then focused ion beam system was used to cut across the very end of the tip, producing a smooth and flat new tip. The average surface roughness Ra of a milled <b>pipette</b> <b>tip</b> was within a few nanometres. Patch clamping experiments were carried out using the polished pipettes on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), which were well known for their extremely flat shape making them very difficult to patch. The results show that above 3 Giga ohm seals were achieved in 60 % of the experiments, as opposed to 1. 5 - 2. 0 GΩ in average with the conventional pipettes. The highest seal resistance achieved with a focused ion beam polished pipette was 9 GΩ, well above the 3 GΩ resistance, the usually best result achieved with a conventional pipette. The leakage current in single channel recording afterwards was found 0. 3 pA, significantly smaller than 2 - 3 pA usually achieved using conventional pipettes. The research results demonstrate that the surface roughness of a pipette has a significant effect on the giga-seal formation of a patch clamping process...|$|R
