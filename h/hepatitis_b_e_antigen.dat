50|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{appearance}} of the HBsAg, another antigen called <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> <b>e</b> <b>antigen</b> (HBeAg) will appear. Traditionally, the presence of HBeAg in a host's serum is associated with much higher rates of viral replication and enhanced infectivity; however, variants of the hepatitis B virus do not produce the 'e' antigen, so this rule does not always hold true. During the natural course of an infection, the HBeAg may be cleared, and antibodies to the 'e' antigen (anti-HBe) will arise immediately afterwards. This conversion is usually associated with a dramatic decline in viral replication.|$|E
5000|$|The HBV {{has four}} genes: S, P, C, and X. The S gene codes for the [...] "major" [...] {{envelope}} protein (HBsAg). The largest gene is P. It codes for DNA polymerase. The C gene codes for HBeAg and HBcAg. The C gene has a precore and a core region. If translation is initiated at the precore region, the protein product is HBeAg. If translation {{begins with the}} core region, HBcAg is the protein product. HBeAg is a marker of HBV replication and infectivity. The precore region is not necessary for viral replication. Precore mutants can replicate. They are readily detectable by HBV DNA in serum, but <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> <b>e</b> <b>antigen</b> (HbeAg) is absent. The X gene codes for HBxAg.

However, on the basis of available data that hepatitis B infection is more prevalent among the Mongolian population than among people of other populations, the work was repeated among Tibetans who had settled down in Karnataka. This set of experiments showed that, contrary to the report of McGlynn et al, there is a statistically significant association between a positive tuberculin test and the presence of <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> <b>e</b> <b>antigen</b> and that those individuals who showed the presence of <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> <b>e</b> <b>antigen</b> exhibited less severe form of the disease than those who were negative to this antigen.

40|$|At {{least two}} {{proteolytic}} events {{are involved in}} the biogenesis of <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> virus <b>e</b> <b>antigen.</b> The first proteolytic event removes the signal peptide and results in the translocation of the precursor protein, P 22, into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).

In contrast to the first proteolytic event, the second proteolytic event is suppressed by brefeldin A, a chemical that inhibits the transport of protein from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. In subcellular fractionation experiments, P 22 was detected in both the ER and the Golgi fractions, but P 16 was detected only in the Golgi fraction. On the basis of these results, we conclude that the conversion of P 22 to P 16 occurs ina post-ER compartment, mostly likely the Golgi apparatus...|$|R

We provisionally named this mutation a “replacement mutation”; the core promoter upstream regulatory sequence/basic core promoter was replaced with {{a part of the}} S 1 promoter covering the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF 1) binding site, followed by a tandem repeat of the HNF 1 site. A longitudinal analysis of the HBV population over 6 years showed the clonal change from wild-type HBV/E to replacement-mutant type, resulting in a lower <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> (HB) <b>e</b> <b>antigen</b> titer, a high HBV DNA level in serum, and progression of liver fibrosis. In an in vitro study using a replication model, the replacement-mutant HBV showed higher replication levels than the wild-type HBV/E replicon, probably mediated by altered transcription factor binding.
