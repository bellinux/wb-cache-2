25|$|In August 2007 it was {{announced}} that the cause of the crash was a failure of the hydraulic flight control system, caused by coating flaking off from servo pistons. The loosened plasma coating flakes blocked the return valves of the servos, causing the aircraft to abruptly lose its maneuverability. Copterline did not have the authority to service or <b>even</b> <b>open</b> these components. However, in the final report, Copterline was criticized for omitting a periodic leak test of the hydraulic flight control system that could have revealed the problem. The Finnish authorities were also criticized for insufficient supervision.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{said that}} the expansion's single-player game was more {{difficult}} than that of Neverwinter Nights 2; 1UP.com stated that Obsidian [...] " [...] the ante with tougher enemies and a more challenging experience altogether". The expansion also has more puzzles which make the player think, rather than somehow being resolvable through combat, with one reviewer noting that the expansion has [...] "genuinely tough logic puzzles (some frustratingly short on clues) {{and a series of}} side quests that completely vary (some might not <b>even</b> <b>open</b> up) depending on your party makeup". Multiple reviewers mentioned that the expansion is more serious than Neverwinter Nights 2.|$|E
500|$|The Six-Day War in the Middle East had {{the effect}} of {{increasing}} Soviet–American cooperation; to improve relations even further, the United States Government invited Kosygin to a summit with Lyndon B. Johnson, the President of the United States, following his speech to the United Nations. At the summit, which became known as the Glassboro Summit Conference, Johnson and Kosygin failed to reach agreement on limiting anti-ballistic missile systems, but the summit's friendly and <b>even</b> <b>open</b> atmosphere was referred to as the [...] "Spirit of Glassboro". Relations between the two countries improved further when the 1970 Moscow Treaty was signed on 12 August 1970 by Kosygin and Gromyko and Willy Brandt and Walter Scheel who represented West Germany.|$|E

500|$|In December 1986, Bono {{stated that}} he had a love–hate {{relationship}} with America, and that this influenced his work on the album. Speaking of his encounter with COMADRES in El Salvador and their impact on the song, he said, [...] "There's {{no question in my mind}} of the Reagan Administration's involvement in backing the regime that is committing these atrocities. I doubt if the people of America are even aware of this. It's not my position to lecture them or tell them their place or to <b>even</b> <b>open</b> their eyes up to it in a very visual way, but it is affecting me and it affects the words I write and the music we make." [...] In 2007, Clayton noted [...] "We were looking at this America through a European lens, at a time when Britain was under Margaret Thatcher who was breaking the miners.... So we were singing from the same hymn sheet as the Clash but with our spotlight focused on injustice inside and outside America." [...] He said [...] "'Mothers of the Disappeared' was not just a reflection on what had happened under the military government in Chile but also at the US which had supported that government", and described Bono's vocals as [...] "prehistoric", saying [...] "it connects with something very primitive." ...|$|E
2500|$|Scheduled {{for public}} release on 1 January 2017, all {{versions}} of Reflection were actually released on 31 December 2016; it was figured that such {{would be easier}} on those in the market business, as more work on New Year's Day in the record shops (if <b>even</b> <b>open)</b> and online stores was not desired. The generative version of Reflection is the fourth iOS App created by Brian Eno and Peter Chilvers: of generativemusic.com. Unlike the other Apps they released Reflection provides no real options other then Play/Pause – later, in its initial update, Airplay and Sleep Timer options were added. As well, being {{that they did not}} take into consideration that Apple had started increasing prices for Apps sold in UK, they lowered its price and provided links to a four track collection called 'Sisters' (each track with a 15:14 duration): a free downloadable album available to those who bought the App at a higher price.

2500|$|In {{contrast}} to his predecessor Emperor Ferdinand (who {{spent the rest of}} his life after his abdication in 1848 in Bohemia and especially in Prague), Franz Joseph was never crowned king of Bohemia. In 1861, the negotiations failed because of unsolved constitutional problems, and in 1866, a visit of the monarch to Prague following the defeat at Hradec Králové (Königgrätz) was also unsuccessful. In 1867, the Austro-Hungarian Compromise and the introduction of the dual monarchy left the Czechs and their aristocracy without the recognition of Bohemian state rights for which they had hoped. Instead of celebrating a coronation in Prague, they had to witness the coronation in Budapest (8 June 1867). In Bohemia, opposition to dualism took the form of street demonstrations, resolutions from district representations, and <b>even</b> <b>open</b> air mass protest meetings. The Czechs were disillusioned. According to the Czech newspaper Národní listy, the Czechs were not yet been compensated for their wartime losses and sufferings during the Austro-Prussian War, and had just seen their historic state rights tossed aside and their land subsumed into [...] "other" [...] half of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, commonly called [...] "Cisleithania".|$|E

2500|$|Dyer, {{who is from}} East London where EastEnders is set, had {{previously}} been offered {{a role in the}} soap in 2009, but turned it down, fearing the level of publicity it would bring. He also said he turned down a 10-episode role in EastEnders because it was an [...] "obvious gangster bully" [...] who would be [...] "blown up by Phil Mitchell". Dyer also revealed that he was approached to play Carl White, but turned it down. He said, [...] "if I'd gone down that route, then I wouldn't be playing the role I am now." [...] Dyer confirmed on 19 October 2013 that he had already started filming his role, stating, [...] "I've already got my kit off for the cameras—we had a funny sex scene early on. But I don't get my bollocks out, you'll be glad to hear." [...] Richie, experienced at playing a landlord in the show, mentored Dyer and helped him on the pub set because he [...] "couldn't <b>even</b> <b>open</b> the f***ing till". He was also trained in how to use a beer engine. After Dyer had been filming for a month, he stated that he was [...] "bringing something to soap land that's never been seen before" [...] and said that taking over The Queen Victoria was [...] "a big responsibility" [...] that he was ready for, adding [...] "I don't want to let them down". He said that his character's entrance to the show was [...] "flawless, but it's not going to be what you expect", and felt that he would have the same impact as original landlord Den Watts (Leslie Grantham). He also thought that his role would be controversial, because of the baggage that comes with him as an actor. Inside Soap said that the success of Mick, the Carter family and the pub all rest on Dyer's shoulders, of which Dyer said put pressure on him but he added that [...] "there should be pressure coming into a show like this. I didn't want to come in as some peripheral character". He hoped that people would find Mick believable and loveable.|$|E

60|$|This was {{a terrible}} state of things for Rosie. There {{was nothing she could}} do; and to sit still and wait was torture to one of her restless, {{energetic}} mind.

But Fan usually locked her out, and would not <b>even</b> <b>open</b> the door to take in her dinner when it was brought; then Rosie would wait until it was cold before leaving it on the landing.|$|E
