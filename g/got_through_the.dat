5|$|As {{the race}} got under way, Kimi Räikkönen's Ferrari {{remained}} motionless {{on the spot}} and only started after all other cars had passed the Finn. Meanwhile, Hamilton <b>got</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> first chicane in front of Vettel, but his teammate Rosberg had to avoid Räikkönen's car and lost two places to the two Williams of Felipe Massa and Valtteri Bottas. Both Lotus drivers were forced to retire {{before the end of}} the second lap, Grosjean due to contact with another car, while Maldonado damaged his chassis when he went over a kerb. While Räikkönen charged through the field to get back up to twelfth place by lap three, Lewis Hamilton quickly increased his advantage over Vettel and moved out of the one-second DRS window. Nico Rosberg was unable to pass Bottas on track and was told by his team to cool his brakes. Further back, the Red Bull sponsored cars moved up the order as well, with Carlos Sainz Jr., Daniel Ricciardo and Daniil Kvyat fighting for tenth position. Sainz yielded his place on lap 11, when he needed to go into the pit lane for a five-second penalty handed to him for cutting the chicane at the start. By lap 14, Hamilton led Vettel by over eight seconds, with Rosberg still behind both Williams in fifth place, pushing Bottas by enabling DRS on the long straights. Behind the German were the two Force India cars of Sergio Pérez and Nico Hülkenberg.|$|E

25|$|In summer 1942, {{supplies}} on the British occupied Mediterranean {{island of}} Malta were running desperately low. There were acute food shortages, {{but even more}} serious {{was the lack of}} aviation fuel, needed to sustain the dozens of fighter aircraft defending the island against German Luftwaffe and Italian Regia Aeronautica bombing attacks. It was later said that Malta would have been forced to surrender in only sixteen days if fuel had not <b>got</b> <b>through.</b> <b>The</b> British conceived a plan to resupply Malta using fourteen merchant ships escorted by a vast armada of Royal Navy warships; four aircraft carriers, two battleships, seven cruisers and thirty-two destroyers.|$|E

25|$|After {{blowing a}} save {{in the ninth}} inning, the Eagles came back to win Game 5 in 10 innings.

Karashima <b>got</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> first four innings without giving up a hit and allowed his first and only hit in the fifth inning. Relieving Karashima, Norimoto blew the game's save opportunity in the ninth only to earn a win in the tenth inning. Yomiuri's Shuichi Murata scored both of the Giants' runs off of Norimoto. His first RBI came from a solo home run in the seventh inning and his game-tying RBI hit came in the ninth sending the game into extra innings.|$|E
25|$|From the 1830s under Daniel O'Connell, {{generations of}} leaders campaigned for the {{creation}} of a new Irish parliament, convinced that the Act of Union had been a great mistake. While O'Connell campaigned for full scale Repeal of the Act, leaders like Isaac Butt and Charles Stewart Parnell sought a more modest form of Home Rule within the United Kingdom, rather than the full recreation of an independent Irish state. However, even if the proposal <b>got</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> British House of Commons (and the first two attempts, in 1886 and 1893 did not), the British House of Lords, with its massive unionist majority, was guaranteed to veto it. Finally, the passage of the Parliament Act in 1911, which restricted the veto powers of the House of Lords, opened up the prospect that an Irish Home Rule Bill might indeed pass through both Houses, receive the Royal Assent and become law.|$|E
25|$|The 1/20th London had Eaucourt as its {{objective}} {{and crossed the}} Flers trenches after the tanks had driven by, then rushed through the farmstead and established a line to the north with the 1/19th London. The position was held under difficult conditions until a line was consolidated round Eaucourt. Both tanks ditched in the Flers trenches west the farm and on the left flank, the 1/17th London encountered uncut wire {{in front of the}} Flers Line; some troops <b>got</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> wire despite several unsuppressed machine-guns but not in strong enough force to hold the line. Troops of II Battalion, Bavarian Infantry Regiment 17, counter-attacked south-eastwards along the Flers trenches and bombed the British out, as the tanks were set on fire and the crews withdrawn. The new position was vulnerable because of the open left flank, which left a gap {{to the right of the}} 50th (Northumberland) Division in the Flers trenches.|$|E

Executive producer Betsy Beers stated that the writing staff was going to focus on the balance between her vulnerability and her courage, also dealing with changes in the relationship with her friends. Pompeo noted that the uncertainty of her character's fate is what helped her evolve into a more adaptable actor. Rhimes also disclosed that an episode with Ellis Grey's unexpected lucidity and eventual death was in plans {{since the beginning of the}} series. Rhimes described how Pompeo <b>got</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> challenge of sending Meredith in the afterlife: [...] "It was an exciting place to take her. Exciting to watch her find her way back."

In the aftermath of Denny's death, Katherine Heigl came to believe that Izzie was not cut out to be a doctor. Executive producer Betsy Beers explained, however, that Denny's death served to make Izzie more mature, and Heigl affirmed that [...] "At the beginning of the third season they were trying to show how lost Izzie was.
