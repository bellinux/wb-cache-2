40|$|International audienceThis {{communication}} {{reports on}} the design of ultra-low power micro-hotplates on polyimide (PI) substrate based on thermal simulations and characterization. The goal of this study was, by establishing a simulation model for very small scale heating elements, to decrease the power consumption of PI micro-hotplates to few mWs to make them suitable for very low-power applications. To this end, the mean heat transfer coefficients in air of the devices were extracted by finite element simulations combined with very precise thermographic measurements. A simulation model was implemented to investigate both the influence of the hotplates' downscaling and the bulk micromaching of the polyimide substrate to lower their power consumptions. Simulations were in very good agreement to the experimental results. The main parameters influencing significantly the power consumption at such dimensions were identified and guidelines have been established allowing the design of very small (15 × 15 μm 2) and ultra-low power heating elements (6 mW at 300 °C). These very low-power heating structures could allow the realization of flexible sensors (gas, flow, wind) for applications in autonomous wireless sensors networks or RFID applications and make them compatible with large scale production on foil such as <b>roll</b> <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> or <b>printing</b> processes...|$|R
40|$|To {{achieve a}} high living {{standard}} {{for all people}} on Earth access to low cost energy is essential. The massive {{burning of fossil fuels}} must be drastically reduced if we are to avoid large changes of our climate. Solar cells are both technologically mature and have the potential to meet the huge demand for renewable energy in many countries. The prices for silicon solar cells have decreased rapidly {{during the course of this}} thesis and are now in grid parity in many countries. However, the potential for even lower energy costs has driven the research on polymer solar cells, a class of thin film solar cells. Polymer solar cells can be produced by <b>roll</b> <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> <b>printing</b> which potentially enables truly low cost solar cells. However, much research and development remain to reach that target. Polymer solar cells consist of a semiconducting composite material sandwiched between two electrodes, of which one is transparent, to let the light energy in to the semiconductor where it is converted to electric energy. The semiconductor comprise an intimate blend of polymer and fullerenes, where the nanostructure of this blend is crucial for the photo current extraction. To reach higher solar cell performance the dominating strategy is development and fine tuning of new polymers. To estimate their potential as solar cell materials their optical response have been determined by spectroscopic ellipsometry. Furthermore, optical simulations have been performed where the direction dependency of the optical response of the transparent electrode material PEDOT:PSS have been accounted for. The simulations show reduced electrode losses for light incident at large oblique angles. Moreover, we have shown that a gentle annealing of the active layer induces a local conformational changes of an amorphous polymer that is beneficial for solar cell performance. The active layer is deposited from solution where the drying kinetics determine the final nanostructure. We have shown that using in-situ photoluminescence phase separation can be detected during the drying process while a reflectance method have been developed to image lateral variations of solvent evaporation rate. Imaging methods are important tools to detect performance variations over the solar cell area. For this purpose an intermodulation based photo current imaging method have been developed to qualitatively differentiate the major photo current loss mechanisms. In addition, a 1 D LED-array photo current imaging method have been developed and verified for high speed in-line characterization of printed organic solar modules. The corrections in the published errata list are implemented in the electronic version. </p...|$|R

Micro-contact <b>roll</b> <b>printing</b> control systems can regulate the printing pressure of a polydimethylsiloxane stamp on a polymer sheet, but the technology cannot adequately control the registration of the stamp on the sheet because the precise dynamic mechanical behavior of the polydimethylsiloxane stamp is unknown. The purpose of this thesis is to apply system identification techniques to characterize the dynamic behavior of samples of polydimethylsiloxane by constructing a test environment that can apply an input force at various frequencies and measure the output force and position at the test sample. A mechanical structure which integrates a voice coil actuator with a load cell and linear variable differential transformer was designed for this purpose. A model and controller were also built to predict the dynamic behavior of the polydimethylsiloxane. In future work the mechanical structure and controller will be integrated and used to fully characterize the behavior of polydimethylsiloxane and other polymers used in micro-fabrication processes. by Emma Claire Benjaminson.

40|$|Over {{the last}} few decades, it has become evident that current energy {{production}} for humanity since the industrial revolution has incurred the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) into the Earth’s atmosphere, resulting in rampant pollution, global warming, ocean acidification and other disastrous environmental effects. The continued emission GHGs {{is a direct result}} of the predominant use of fossil fuels to meet an exponentially increasing global energy demand. Development of sustainable energy technologies is a global imperative to avoid future catastrophe. Photovoltaics (PV) are an ideal resource that allows us to convert our greatest supply of energy, sunlight, directly into our greatest source of energy consumption, electricity. ^ In the last four decades, PV research for new solar materials and fabrication methods to compete with crystalline silicon (c-Si) modules has expanded in an effort to reach $ 1 /Watt solar energy. Thin films of chalcogenide semiconductors such as CdTe, Cu(In,Ga) (S,Se) 2 and Cu 2 ZnSn(S,Se) 4 (CZTSSe) have ideal band gaps for solar absorption, require 100 times less material than c-Si, and do not require high levels of purity, thus lowering material costs and processing. The lower material cost from earth-abundant elements and ability to solution process CZTSSe make this material an ideal competitor with current PV technologies. Solution based methods, such as <b>roll</b> <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> <b>printing</b> of nanoparticle inks, are a more scalable method to deposit the absorber film. Once coated, only the selenization sinters sulfide nanoparticles into micron sized grains, which are required for high efficiency PV devices. Selenization and sulfurization equipment were engineered to study the chalcogenization of CZTS and CZTSe nanoparticle films. Due to the volatility of sulfur, liquid assisted sintering does not occur. However, abnormal grain growth above 550 °C may occur as the kinetics of nanoparticle thermolysis become appreciable, thus forming nuclei at the film surface. Recent literature has shown the necessity of CuSe nuclei to induce sintering. Sulfurization of CuS doped CZTS films sinter, thus expanding these claims beyond the selenide. ^ Throughout this work, experiments on the chalcogenization of varying nanoparticle materials, film architectures, and processing times, were studied to understand the sintering process. One disadvantage of annealing nanoparticle thin films is the formation of the carbon rich fine-grain layer due to pyrolysis of oleylamine nanoparticle ligands present from hot-injection synthesis. Oleylamine capped CZTS nanoparticles form a suitable film morphology that enables the percolation of liquid selenium throughout the nanoparticle film, and diffusion of copper to the film surface. Ligand exchange procedures with carbon-free diammonium sulfide suppress sintering by altering the nanoparticle film morphology with agglomerate formation, resulting in the fabrication of porous nanostructures that are more suited for thermoelectric application. Pre-annealing ligand exchanged films in air breaks the nanoparticle agglomerates, resulting in a higher degree of coarsening and improved device performance. ^ Beyond diammonium sulfide, the effect of surface ligand on film sintering was researched. Hard soft acid base (HSAB) concepts qualitatively explain why soft Lewis bases such as Cu 2 S, Se, (NH 4) 2 S bind strongly to copper and prevent film sintering. In contrast, nanoparticles recapped with hard Lewis bases like KOH, NH 4 OH, and NaNH 2 show more sintering, presumably by allowing copper to react with selenium more readily. Thiourea which comprises both soft sulfide and hard amide results in both large and small grain sintering. ^ As a lower cost alternative to CZTS nanoparticles, Cu 2 FeSnS 4 (CFTS) nanoparticles were synthesized via hot injection and fabricated for the first time into a PV device. Selenization of hot-injection synthesized tetragonal P 4 CFTS nanoparticles sinter into ~ 1 - 2 µm stannite Cu 2 FeSn(S,Se) 4 (CFTSS) grains. PV devices demonstrated photoconductivity; however, tin loss during annealing produced binary and ternary phases that shunted the devices. ^ The aim of this work is to develop new solution processing methods and materials to lower the cost per watt of chalcogenide solar absorbers. The use of Corning® Willow® glass (CWG) enables roll-to-roll printing and provides a unique opportunity for processing flexible chalcogenide solar cells. Doping with NaF was demonstrated as a viable method to improve device efficiency, reaching a record 6. 9 % CZTSSe device. Thus this work establishes a plethora of solution processing tools towards achieving $ 1 /Watt PV energy. ...|$|R
