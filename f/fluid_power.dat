In 584 the dukes agreed to crown King Cleph's son, Autari, and delivered to the new monarch half of their property (and then probably getting even with a new crackdown against the surviving Roman property land).|$|E
25|$|Liquid is {{the primary}} {{component}} of hydraulic systems, which take advantage of Pascal's law to provide <b>fluid</b> <b>power.</b> Devices such as pumps and waterwheels {{have been used to}} change liquid motion into mechanical work since ancient times. Oils are forced through hydraulic pumps, which transmit this force to hydraulic cylinders. Hydraulics can be found in many applications, such as automotive brakes and transmissions, heavy equipment, and airplane control systems. Various hydraulic presses are used extensively in repair and manufacturing, for lifting, pressing, clamping and forming.|$|E

50|$|These can {{be either}} {{hydraulic}} or electric submersible. The hydraulic uses high pressure <b>power</b> <b>fluid</b> to operate down hole fluid engine. The engine in turn drives a piston that moves the fluid to the surface. The <b>power</b> <b>fluid</b> system {{can be either}} open or closed, it depends on whether the <b>power</b> <b>fluid</b> can be mixed with well fluid. This type of system usually has above ground <b>power</b> <b>fluid</b> pumps and a reservoir. The electric submersible is another type of rodless pumping system. This uses an electric pump submerged in the well and connected {{to a series of}} transformers and control equipment that power and control the pumping rate. In this system the electric motor is isolated from the oil by a protector. The fluid intake which is before the pump mechanism has a gas separator, also the junction box on the surface helps to dissipate any gas that may have come up the power lines.|$|R

50|$|Revenge as a genre {{has been}} {{consistent}} {{with a variety of}} themes that have frequently appeared in different texts over the last few centuries.

Each theme, along with the concept of dramatic irony, play a large role in the success of revenge in literature. Dramatic irony is a literary device in which the audience possesses knowledge unavailable to characters in a novel, play, or film. Its purpose is to intensify the tragic events that are going to unfold by creating tension between the audience and the actions of the characters. It is essential to narratives of revenge.|$|R
