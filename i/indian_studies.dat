The Americans, Paul Sereno and Jeff Wilson, started {{the reconstruction of the}} collection of dinosaur bones gathered in 1983 and 1984. The team of scientists, after a detailed study of the maps prepared earlier by Srivastava, were able to reconstruct the partial skull, left and right hip bones, and a sacrum. They interpreted the part of a skull and a horn as resembling those of dinosaurs found in Madagascar. Fossils of Rajasaurus were also found near Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh. In all, the collected fossils include a partial skull, limb bones, hip bones, and vertebrae.|$|E

500|$|The {{stereotyping}} of Native Americans must {{be understood}} {{in the context of}} history which includes conquest, forced relocation, and organized efforts to eradicate native cultures, such as the boarding schools of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which separated young Native Americans from their families in order to educate them as European Americans. As stated in an editorial by Carter Meland (Anishinaabe heritage) and David E. Wilkins (Lumbee) both professors of American <b>Indian</b> <b>Studies</b> at the University of Minnesota: [...] "Since the first Europeans made landfall in North America, native peoples have suffered under a weltering array of stereotypes, misconceptions and caricatures. Whether portrayed as noble savages, ignoble savages, teary-eyed environmentalists or, most recently, simply as casino-rich, native peoples find their efforts to be treated with a measure of respect and integrity undermined by images that flatten complex tribal, historical and personal experience into one-dimensional representations that tells us more about the depicters than about the depicted." ...|$|E
500|$|Elliot Sperling, a {{specialist}} of <b>Indian</b> <b>studies</b> {{and the director}} of the Tibetan Studies program at Indiana University’s Department of Central Eurasia Studies, writes that [...] "the idea that Tibet became part of China in the 13th century is a very recent construction." [...] He writes that Chinese writers of the early 20th century were of the view that Tibet was not annexed by China until the Manchu Qing dynasty invasion during the 18th century. He also states that Chinese writers of the early 20th century described Tibet as a feudal dependency of China, not an integral part of it. Sperling states that this is because [...] "Tibet was ruled as such, within the empires of the Mongols and the Manchus" [...] and also that [...] "China's intervening Ming dynasty...had no control over Tibet." [...] He writes that the Ming relationship with Tibet is problematic for China’s insistence of its unbroken sovereignty over Tibet since the 13th century. As for the Tibetan view that Tibet was never subject to the rule of the Yuan or Qing emperors of China, Sperling also discounts this by stating that Tibet was [...] "subject to rules, laws and decisions made by the Yuan and Qing rulers" [...] and that even Tibetans described themselves as subjects of these emperors.|$|E
