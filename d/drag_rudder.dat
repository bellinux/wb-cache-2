40|$|Historically {{aircraft}} noise {{is one of}} the principal environmental issues for aviation. Within this context, the Silent Aircraft Initiative was launched with the objective to achieve a step-change in noise reduction compared to current practice. One of the most critical tasks in noise reduction is to develop technologies to increase drag in quiet ways. The work presented in this thesis focuses primarily on aeroacoustic tests and analysis of perforated drag plates. The idea behind a quiet spoiler or <b>drag</b> <b>rudder</b> is to alter the noise production mechanism by perforating the drag plates. The hypothesis is that the large length scales responsible for the noise radiated by unsteady vortical structures can be changed to small length scales driving jet noise at frequencies which are perceived unannoying by the human ear. The aeroacoustic characteristics of laboratory-scale perforated spoilers were measured in an acoustic chamber at MIT. Based on the experimental data a noise prediction model was developed for the bluff-body and turbulent mixing noise generated by a perforated <b>drag</b> <b>rudder.</b> Acoustic phased array measurements of seven perforated plates in four different installation configurations were conducted in the Markham wind tunnel at Cambridge University to further investigate the noise mechanisms. (cont.) The analysis of the test results showed that there are two identifiable peak frequencies which scale with free stream velocity. Different candidate length scales were investigated with the goal to collapse the data on a Strouhal number basis. However, a universal length scale was not found. It was hypothesized that the noise is mainly due to the isotropic turbulence generated behind such perforated plate. Due to the high background noise levels in the experiments the impact of the perforations on the low frequency noise signature could not be assessed. A perforated plate of 28 : 19 % porosity with a hole diameter to plate length ratio d/L of 0 : 013 and a non- dimensional hole separation s/L of 0 : 0217 was identified to be the most beneficial plate in terms of noise reduction. The experiments showed that a spoiler mounted on the suction surface of the wing is the quietest configuration. In order to scale the results to full size, the observed peak magnitudes are suggested to scale with the 4 th power of the free stream velocity. In addition, the overall sound pressure levels were found to scale with plate size such that an increase in source area causes an equivalent increase in the acoustic power. (cont.) The developed models were used to predict the noise signature of a full sized <b>drag</b> <b>rudder</b> which enabled a 6 ⁰ glide slope angle resulting in a 4 dBA reduction in cumulative sound pressure level of the candidate SAX 10 Silent Aircraft design. by Kiril Dimitrov Sakaliyski.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} a {{simulation}} {{model for a}} Very Large Crude Carrier is revised. MARINTEK s software ShipX is used to develop, improve, test and validate {{a model for the}} case vessel KVLCC 2. The Manoeuvring Plug-In (SIMAN, 3 -DOF) and the Vessel Simulator Plug-In (VeSim, 6 -DOF) are utilized for this purpose. The underlying field of study has been ship manoeuvrability. KVLCC 2 s hull lines, propeller and rudder data are available at SIMMAN 2014 websites [4]. Captive and free model tests conducted in connection to the workshop on verification and validation of ship manoeuvring simulation methods SIMMAN 2008 are available. The methodology for improving the simulation model is to use the model to simulate the IMO standard manoeuvres. Turning circles, zig-zag and stopping tests in deep water is simulated. Turning circles(35), zig-zag(10 / 2. 5, 20 / 5) and spiral tests are simulated in shallow water. The simulation results are compared to results from SIMMAN in 2008. The 26 th ITTC has suggested benchmark data from average values of the free sailing model tests from the workshop that are used for model validation. The simulation results are also evaluated and compared to the results from MARINTEK s contribution in SIMMAN 2008 using SIMAN. A sensitivity analysis is performed to find which parameters are of high importance in the model. The parameters of high importance are investigated further. The linear velocity coefficients are compared with empirical methods and PMM tests. Shallow water effects and low speed manoeuvring are assessed. The shallow water simulations at low speed are compared with the shallow water effect trends from full-scale trials with Esso Osaka. Validation and verification of simulation modelsare assessed and understood. The simulation model does fulfil all the IMO criteria of turning, initial turning/course-changing, yaw-checking abilities in both VeSim and SIMAN. The model in VeSim fulfil the IMO criteria of stopping ability, while the model in SIMAN does not. The differences in the results of VeSim and SIMAN and small. The simulation results do not correspond well with the benchmark data based on free model tests from SIMMAN 2008, and the model can not be validated. MARINTEK s contribution using SIMAN in 2008 was more consistent with the benchmark data, and indicates that the changes made in the plug-in does not give better results for KVLCC 2. Changes has been observed in the calculation of the hydrodynamic coefficients and resistance polynomial. Especially the calculation methods of Yr and Nr have been altered. When usingthe same input parameters as well as the same hydrodynamic coefficients and resistance polynomial as in 2008 the manoeuvring simulations deviates substantially. These deviations must be because of changes in either non-linear cross-flow <b>drag,</b> <b>rudder</b> module or the propeller module(or all). These subroutines are hard to assess because of lack of updated documentation. The linear damping coefficients proved to be of high importance in the sensitivity analysis, especially Nv and Nr. Wake fraction and thrust deduction are also of some importance. ShipX tends to overestimate Nv and underestimate Nr and can not be validated against results from PMM tests. An input value of 0. 150 [-] for the wake fraction of the hull has been observed to be too low compared to literature and other wake fractions used in SIMMAN 2008. The same shallow water trends for KVLCC 2 are observed as for Esso Osaka for the turning circle test. The same trends are not found for checking and counter turning ability for KVLCC 2. From the 23 rd ITTC committee s review of shallow water ratios as well as using methods of Clarke, Ankudinov and Kijima it seems like SIMAN s shallow water formulae underestimates the linearvelocity coefficient ratios. There has been made several changes in the different subroutines and modules of the plugin during the last six years. These changes are easily noticed by looking at results when using exactly the same inputs and coefficients. It is impossible to assess and suggest improvements to the cross-flow <b>drag,</b> <b>rudder</b> module and propeller module when the documentation is not updated. Nv is overestimated and Nr is underestimated compared to empirical methods and PMM tests. Due to the high importance of these a review of the current calculation methods of these should be looked into. SIMAN and VeSim is tuned for offshore vessels, which could have an impact of the results since KVLCC 2 is a VLCC. An assessment of SIMAN s shallow water formulae is hard to do as well due to lack of documentation, but this should be looked into after SIMMAN 2014...|$|E
25|$|The {{control system}} of the SZD-6x was {{designed}} to allow the aircraft to be flown with several different control configurations. The trailing edges of the wings carried three surfaces each, all {{of which could be}} linked to form elevons or operated individually as ailerons, elevators or flaps. The metal-skinned split ailerons, (the outboard control surfaces), also formed the airbrakes, opening out to give increased drag. The ailerons/airbrakes could be connected to the rudder pedals to be used as <b>drag</b> <b>rudders,</b> similar to the <b>drag</b> <b>rudders</b> used on the Northrop flying wings. The inboard control surfaces on the swept ford section of trailing edge were typically used for trimming purposes deflecting 10° up or down.|$|R
50|$|The {{shape is}} aerodynamically stable {{enough to be}} flown without {{computer}} correction. Its aerodynamic stability is {{in part due to}} lift provided by the chines, as used in other aircraft including the SR-71 Blackbird. This provided lift for the nose in flight. This configuration, which can be stable without a horizontal tailplane and a conventional vertical rudder, is now a standard in later stealth unmanned aerial vehicles such as the X-45 and X-47, tailless aircraft which use <b>drag</b> <b>rudders</b> (asymmetrically-used wingtip airbrakes) for rudder control.|$|R
2500|$|This {{arrangement}} reduced unfavourable yawing moments due to aileron {{by making}} use of differential aileron movement, but avoided the change in longitudinal trim by the opposing differential of the inner flap pair. In high speed flight the nose down trim was provided mainly by the inner elevon section moving downwards, the outer flap deflecting only slightly; this {{had the advantage of}} relieving the tips of torsional loads at high speed. [...] <b>Drag</b> <b>rudders,</b> similar to airbrakes fitted in modern gliders, were fitted near the wingtips, providing yaw control similar to those used in the H.II.|$|R
50|$|The wings were of {{conventional}} construction with a ply-covered torsion box forming {{the leading edge}} forward of the mainspar and fabric-covered ribs {{to the rear of}} the main-spar. Ovoid-shaped fins with rudders were fitted at the wing-tips; also skids for support when static on the ground. The use of <b>drag</b> <b>rudders</b> was also investigated with the rudders opening in similar fashion to the airbrake, increasing drag on one side and yawing the aircraft. The centre of gravity was also adjustable in flight, with a 7 kg (15 lb) weight, on a fore-aft orientated threaded rod, which could be adjusted by the pilot.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the absence}} of a {{conventional}} rudder the Habicht had <b>drag</b> <b>rudders.</b> [...] These were leading edge flaps placed near the tips and formed by mounting the leading edge surfaces on a hinge so they could open upwards and downwards (those of the Horten H.I had extended downwards only). [...] Their differential operational controlled yaw and they served as conventional airbrakes when opened together. The whole trailing edge was occupied by control surfaces; the outer panels had elevons outboard and landing flaps inboard and there were further landing flaps on the centre section. Rear control surfaces were assisted by Flettner servo tabs and were ply covered.|$|R
40|$|AbstractWith control using {{redundant}} multiple {{control surface}} arrangement and large-deflection <b>drag</b> <b>rudders,</b> a combat flying wing {{has a higher}} probability for control surface failures. Therefore, its flight control system {{must be able to}} reconfigure after such failures. Considering three types of typical control surface failures (lock-in-place (LIP), loss-of-effectiveness (LOE) and float), flight control reconfiguration characteristic and capability of such aircraft types are analyzed. Because of the control surface redundancy, the aircraft using the dynamic inversion flight control law already has a control allocation block. In this paper, its flight control configuration during the above failures is achieved by modifying this block. It is shown that such a reconfigurable flight control design is valid, through numerical simulations of flight attitude control task. Results indicate that, in the circumstances of control surface failures with limited degree and the degradation of the flying quality level, a combat flying wing adopting this flight control reconfiguration approach based on control allocation could guarantee its flight safety and perform some flight combat missions...|$|R
40|$|The Blended-Wing-Body (BWB) {{concept has}} shown {{substantial}} performance benefits over conventional aircraft configuration {{with part of}} the benefit being derived from {{the absence of a}} conventional empennage arrangement. The configuration instead relies upon a bank of trailing edge devices to provide control authority and augment stability. To determine the aerodynamic characteristics of the aircraft, several wind tunnel tests were conducted with a 2 % model of Boeing's BWB- 450 - 1 L configuration. The tests were conducted in the NASA Langley Research Center's National Transonic Facility and the Arnold Engineering Development Center s 16 -Foot Transonic Tunnel. Characteristics of the configuration and the effectiveness of the elevons, <b>drag</b> <b>rudders</b> and winglet rudders were measured at various angles of attack, yaw angles, and Mach numbers (subsonic to transonic speeds). The data from these tests will be used to develop a high fidelity simulation model for flight dynamics analysis and also serve as a reference for CFD comparisons. This paper provides an overview of the wind tunnel tests and examines the effects of Reynolds number, Mach number, pitch-pause versus continuous sweep data acquisition and compares the data from the two wind tunnels...|$|R
50|$|Upon {{completion}} of Patrol 63, Lafayette transited to Charleston Weapons Station on 20 February 1987 and, after shipyard maintenance, departed Charleston for Patrol 64. While egressing the port, she was slightly off course and technically ran aground, {{even though it}} was just <b>dragging</b> the <b>rudder</b> through the mud. She was ordered to moor at Charleston Navy Base pending a Board of Inquiry. Three days later, she set sail and performed Patrols 64 to 66, (20 February-27 May, 28 May-5 September, 6 September-15 December respectively) returning to Holy Loch to refit. Subsequently, she got underway on 16 December for Patrol 67, during which she enjoyed a port visit in Lisbon, Portugal, from 24-29 February 1988. Underway on 25 March for Patrol 68, she returned to Holy Loch on 1 July. The following day, she commenced Patrol 69, returning on 11 October for refit, venturing out on 12 October to begin Patrol 70.|$|R
60|$|Two nicely matched steamers {{will stay}} in sight of each other day after day. They might even stay side by side, but {{for the fact that}} pilots are not all alike, and the smartest pilots will win the race. If one of the boats has a 'lightning' pilot, whose 'partner' is a trifle his inferior, you can tell which one is on watch by noting whether that boat has gained ground or lost some during each four-hour stretch. The shrewdest pilot can delay a boat if he has not a fine genius for steering. Steering is a very high art. One must not keep a <b>rudder</b> <b>dragging</b> across a boat's stem if he wants to get up the river fast.|$|R
50|$|In {{the civil}} field, the {{integration}} increases flight safety and economy. The Airbus A320 and its fly-by-wire brethren are protected from dangerous situations such as low-speed stall or overstressing by flight envelope protection. As a result, in such conditions, the flight control systems commands the engines to increase thrust without pilot intervention. In economy cruise modes, the flight control systems adjust the throttles and fuel tank selections more precisely than {{all but the}} most skillful pilots. FADEC reduces <b>rudder</b> <b>drag</b> needed to compensate for sideways flight from unbalanced engine thrust. On the A330/A340 family, fuel is transferred between the main (wing and center fuselage) tanks and a fuel tank in the horizontal stabilizer, to optimize the aircraft's center of gravity during cruise flight. The fuel management controls keep the aircraft's center of gravity accurately trimmed with fuel weight, rather than drag-inducing aerodynamic trims in the elevators.|$|R
40|$|Stern gear {{design for}} luxury high speed yachts {{currently}} relies on an {{estimation of the}} inflow velocity at the propeller plane and the propeller race. These components are often located within tunnel features on the hull and the flow regime will {{be influenced by the}} vessel trim and planning speed. Typically, the flow into the propeller is taken as an average over the entire propeller area and {{does not take into account}} the variation of the flow into the propeller due to appendages and hull shape. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations allow this variation to be calculated. These data are coupled with a potential based lifting surface program and are used to improve propeller design. In order to optimise the design of the rudder, the propeller race must be known. A method of introducing the propeller forces back into the CFD flow is investigated. This improved method has the advantage of providing a more accurate flow field into the rudder, which allows the rudder design to be improved. It is expected that this procedure will reduce the <b>rudder</b> <b>drag</b> and cavitation. The development and validation of this CFD methodology applied to high speed planning craft propulsion using open source software is illustrated with regard to two case studies for P bracket and propeller design optimisation, and to estimate the toe-in angle for the rudder in order to align it with the propeller race...|$|R
40|$|The rudder {{of a ship}} is used to {{maintain}} its direction and for changing course. As such the goal of rudder design is to maximise sideforce for control of course while minimising resistive <b>drag.</b> Ship <b>rudder’s</b> are typically mounted downstream of the propeller {{to take advantage of}} the higher speed flow in the propeller race. This flow also has a swirl component that results in a complex flow regime arriving at the rudder. Likewise, the presence of the rudder has an influence on the flow speed and direction passing through the propeller. It is therefore recommended that design of the propulsive system incorporates the rudder design. This will ensure that appropriate decisions are made that maximise the net propulsive thrust for a given engine power. We examine in this paper how the design of the combined propeller-rudder system can be best achieved for a goal of maximising propulsive efficiency without sacrificing the ability to manoeuvre. The design of the rudder requires careful thought as to its longitudinal, lateral and vertical position. The swirl component of propeller race results in a force distribution over the rudder that can give a net propulsive thrust by extracting energy from the flow rotation. Such effects can be used to compensate for the resistive drag of the form and surface area of the rudder itself. Design of rudders are often based on evolutionary principles that will not capture the subtleties necessary to enhance propulsive efficiency. We discuss a hierarchy of computational analysis tools that includes unsteady solution of the Navier Stokes equations, their coupling with propeller blade element momentum analysis and use of surface panel and lifting line theories to understand rudder forces. Such techniques are suitable for design optimization. Conventionally it is the rudder structural strength and associated cost of construction that limits the types of rudders that can be designed. Recent work on a variety of twisted rudders has shown that there can be significant performance gains. For more radical shapes the use of suitable composite construction will give cost-effective performance while also reducing rudder mass as well. We show through three case studies related to: (1) twisted rudders, (2) cathodic protection and (3) the influence of the rudder on kite assisted ship propulsion; that to achieve improved propulsive performance all that is required is greater care and attention to the rudder design process. Such design detail will more than cover its cost in fuel savings and the resultant reduced engine emission...|$|R
40|$|Concerning the {{characteristic}} {{effectiveness of the}} specially deformed rectangular cross-section Rudder, built in the ship-building yards in Kagoshima Prefecture, and adopted in Yamakawa and some other districts, there has been made no researches in ascertaining its merits {{in comparison with the}} typical stream-line cross-section Rudder used far more widely. This is the reason why a test was carried out on the steerability-comparison between the above mentioned two Rudder-models, a Rectangular Cross-section one and a Stream-line Cross-section one, {{with the use of the}} Wind Tunnel Balance newly set in our Faculty, the items ascertained are as in the following : In Rectangular Cross-section Rudder, both Lift Coefficient (C_L) and Drag Coefficient (C_D) are larger than those in Stream Line Cross-section one. But under the usual Rudder angle 10 ~ 25 °, the increased percentage of the Lift Coefficient is considerably larger than that of the Drag Coefficient; namely, under the biggest Steerability, when Reynolds number is 1. 8 × 10 ^ 4, the increased percentage is 30 %; likewise, when 4. 0 × 10 ^ 4, it is 23 %; when 5. 9 × 10 ^ 4, it is 18 %; when 7. 8 × 10 ^ 4, it is 14 %; which shows that the effectiveness of the Rectangular Cross-section Rudder is obviously higher than that of the Stream-line Cross-section Rudder, which also means that the former is superior to the latter. In this case, it is without saying that the disadvantage in the form of the <b>Rudder</b> <b>Drag</b> is accompanied inevitably. But, as is to be seen in the following table the amount of the Drag under the above mentioned Reynolds number is, at its maximum, 24 %, 13 %, 10 %, 7 % respectively. Hence, the reasonable conclusion that, at least, on board of the small sized vessels operating within narrow bays and coves, and in which Rudder effectiveness rather than the Navigation speed is necessitated, the popular use of this type of Rudder might be encouraged more widely than it is to-day.

40|$|This master's thesis {{studies the}} kayak rudder flow {{phenomena}} and uses analytic, numerical and experimental methods {{to describe the}} force coefficients of kayak rudders. Also {{an analysis of the}} sport of flatwater kayaking is conducted – amongst others with regard to the motion of the kayak hull and with regard to the propulsion. The former is based on measurement data of a K 1 kayak. Further the focus is put on the rudder, and the gained knowledge finds e. g. utilization in modeling of the dynamic angle of attack. Simulations based on CAD-data of a kayak rudder type are conducted (mostly RANS models) and discussed. Assumptions in this framework are that the boundary layer of the kayak hull is not accounted for and that possible effects of a transitional flow are not incorporated. Naturally, also the process and the solutions used to face the challenges of the grid development are described. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of different simulations (meshes, turbulence models and two sizes of the rudder) is undertaken. The main outcome are force coefficients and lift-to-drag ratios. They are based on angles of attack: 0 o ≤ α ≤ 7. 5 o and found for three different Reynolds numbers. These force coefficients are compared to analytical methods and discussed in the context of general flow phenomena and its modeling. The mainly discussed and derived analytical methods are slender body and lifting line theory (SBT & LLT). If the known error of LLT at small aspect ratios is empirically taken into account, the simulation results are in excellent agreement with the LLT. However, all of the studied sizes of the kayak rudder exceed the slenderness approximation of SBT. The simulation results are combined with the study of the kayak-hull motion, and the approximate dynamic power loss caused by the rudder is deduced. For the smallest rudder that is approximately 1. 2 W. In addition, an experiment is designed and build up to measure lift and <b>drag</b> of kayak <b>rudders.</b> First runs are conducted. They deliver a reasonable preliminary result for the drag force at zero angle of attack (compared with the simulations), but could unfortunately not be pursued further. This master's thesis was not part of any ongoing project, and one can conclude that a further study in the field of kayak rudders most certainly could benefit from the achievements of this work...|$|R
