5|$|Scent factors {{heavily into}} lemur reproduction. Scent-marking {{activity}} escalates during the mating season. Pheromones may coordinate reproductive timing for females coming into estrus. Mating {{can be either}} monogamous or promiscuous <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> females, and mating can include individuals from outside the group. Monogamous lemurs include the red-bellied lemur (Eulemur rubriventer) and the mongoose lemur (E. mongoz), although the mongoose lemur has been observed mating outside of its pair bond. Monogamy is most common among nocturnal species, although some exhibit scramble competition, sexual suppression of subordinates, or competitions between males that avoid direct fighting. In mouse lemurs, males utilize sperm plugs, developed enlarged testes during the mating season, and develop size dimorphism (likely due to the enlarged testes). These indicate a mating system known as scramble competition polygyny, where males cannot defend females or the resources that might attract them.|$|E
25|$|There are dichotomous {{differences}} of opinion among Sunni scholars in regards to female genital cutting. These {{differences of}} opinion range from obligatory to acceptable.

25|$|This hadith {{does not}} specify the gender, and is {{sometimes}} {{claimed to be}} a basis for circumcision as a religious requirement <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> females. However, Mohamed Salim Al-Awwa claims it is unclear if some or all of these religious requirements were meant for females, because cutting a mustache is an act typical to men.

25|$|PCBs {{have shown}} toxic and {{mutagenic}} effects by interfering with hormones in the body. PCBs, {{depending on the}} specific congener, {{have been shown to}} both inhibit and imitate estradiol, the main sex hormone in females. Imitation of the estrogen compound can feed estrogen-dependent breast cancer cells, and possibly cause other cancers, such as uterine or cervical. Inhibition of estradiol can lead to serious developmental problems <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> females, including sexual, skeletal, and mental development issues. In a cross-sectional study, PCBs were found to be negatively associated with testosterone levels in adolescent boys.|$|E
25|$|Both the Qur'anIslam's sacred textand {{the spoken}} or acted {{example of the}} Prophet Muḥammad (Sunnah) {{advocate}} {{the rights of women}} and men equally to seek knowledge. The Qur'an commands all Muslims to exert effort in the pursuit of knowledge, irrespective of their biological sex: it constantly encourages Muslims to read, think, contemplate and learn from the signs of God in nature. Moreover, Muḥammad encouraged education <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> females: he declared that seeking knowledge was a religious duty binding upon every Muslim man and woman. Like her male counterpart, each woman is under a moral and religious obligation to seek knowledge, develop her intellect, broaden her outlook, cultivate her talents and then utilise her potential to the benefit of her soul and her society.|$|E
25|$|Non-penetrative genital {{stimulation}} is {{very common}} throughout the animal kingdom. Different forms of self and partner genital stimulation have been observed in the animal kingdom. Oral sex has been observed throughout the animal kingdom, from dolphins to primates. Bonobos have been observed to transition from a simple demonstration of affection to non-penetrative genital stimulation. Animals perform oral sex by licking, sucking or nuzzling the genitals of their partner. Another form of genital stimulation is masturbation. Masturbation is widespread throughout mammals <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> females. It is less common in birds. There are several techniques, in which animals engage in masturbation from using paws, feet, flippers, tails, and sometimes using objects like sticks, pebbles, and leaves. Masturbation occurs more often in primate species with large testes relative to their body size.|$|E

25|$|Glutathione reductase is a {{nicotinamide}} adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and FAD-dependent enzyme, and {{the major}} flavoprotein in erythrocyte. The measurement of the activity coefficient of erythrocyte glutathione reductase (EGR) is the preferred method for assessing riboflavin status. It provides a measure of tissue saturation and long-term riboflavin status. In vitro enzyme activity in terms of activity coefficients (AC) is determined both with and without the addition of FAD to the medium. ACs represent a ratio of the enzyme’s activity with FAD to the enzyme’s activity without FAD. An AC of 1.2 to 1.4, riboflavin status is considered low when FAD is added to stimulate enzyme activity. An AC > 1.4 suggests riboflavin deficiency. On the other hand, if FAD is added and AC is < 1.2, then riboflavin status is considered acceptable. Tillotson and Bashor reported that a decrease in the intakes of riboflavin was associated with increase in EGR AC. In the UK study of Norwich elderly, initial EGR AC values <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> females were significantly correlated with those measured 2 years later, suggesting that EGR AC may be a reliable measure of long-term biochemical riboflavin status of individuals. These findings are consistent with earlier studies.|$|E
500|$|The {{program for}} the Beijing Games was quite {{similar to that of}} the 2004 Summer Olympics held in Athens. There were 28 sports and 302 events at the 2008 Games.

In fencing, women's team foil and women's team sabre replaced men's team foil and women's team épée. Two sports were open only to men, baseball and boxing, while one sport and one discipline were open only to women, softball and synchronized swimming.

2500|$|By 1930, Dr. F. W. W.

[...] The work of sexologist Alfred Kinsey during the 1940s and 1950s, most notably the Kinsey Reports, insisted that masturbation was an instinctive behaviour <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> females.

2500|$|The {{blending}} of sexual and spiritual is portrayed in Hindu iconography, {{as seen in}} ubiquitous phallic and vaginal iconography in Hindu temples and for instance in the Kharjuraho and Konarak medieval temples, where thousands of couples having sex in endless positions, and with the gods, are carved in deep bas-relief. [...] However, these depictions of sex are not generally understood to be a license for free sexual practices, but are instead meant to celebrate procreation {{as an integral part}} of existence in the universe.
