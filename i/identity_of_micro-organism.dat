40|$|The {{reliability}} of reference materials (RMs) depends on properties such as fitness, robustness, commutability, stability, and homogeneity. The development of RMs for microbiological analysis is especially challenged through questions around the stabilisation and recovery of viable cells, the dispersion of precise numbers of cells, matrix effects and, when using molecular techniques, {{the presence of}} nucleic acids (e. g. DNA) of dead and live target organisms. However, RMs are indispensible tools for quality control in microbiological analysis. The Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (IRMM), {{as part of the}} European Commission, concentrates its efforts on the development of RMs to support the development, implementation and monitoring of EU legislation. A special focus is given to highly precise RMs for presence/absence and enumeration tests in microbiological food and water analysis. Another group of new RMs certified by the IRMM comprise DNA-based materials to control the <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> <b>micro-organisms</b> in qualitative assays. All of these activities serve to improve quality control in microbiological analysis. JRC. D. 2 -Reference material...|$|R
30|$|Maintenance of optimal {{water quality}} and removal of {{nitrogen}} compounds poses challenges to aquaculture (van Kessel et al. 2010). Bio-filtration is an important separation process employed to convert toxic nitrogen metabolites into less toxic forms (Crab et al. 2007), although the <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>micro-organisms</b> responsible for this conversion has not been well characterized (Tal et al. 2003; van Kessel et al. 2010). In bio-filtration systems, the pollutants are removed by biological degradation rather than physical filtration (Rijn 1996; Hargreaves 1998). And diverse microbial community structures can facilitate decomposition of chemical pollutants and improve water quality (Ibekwe et al. 2007).|$|R
40|$|The {{environmental}} safety of {{crop protection products}} of natural origin (biopesticides) is to be re-evaluated within a few years' time by the European Union. Also, new biopesticides will enter the EU market, due to the increasing importance of sustainable agriculture. There is, however, almost no guidance to evaluate the {{environmental safety}} of these products. Therefore, in this desk study risk decision trees {{have been developed for}} three groups of products, i. e. microbial organisms, signalling chemicals (including pheromones) and plant-derived substances. These trees help to discern acceptable from unacceptable potential risks. Also, summary tables have been developed to record and evaluate environmental tests with microbial pesticides. In this way the reliability and usefulness for the safety evaluation can be assessed per test. The decision trees and the summary tables are intended to improve the safety evaluation for regulatory purposes. Biopesticides are allegedly less toxic and persistent than synthetic chemicals. However, this should not exclude them from a proper environmental safety evaluation, since microbial and plant-derived biopesticidal ingredients can be infective, pathogenic or toxic. This depends on their microbiological or chemical properties, the dosage and the site and type of application. It is of primary importance to find out the <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>micro-organism(s)</b> or the active substance(s), the microbial or chemical characteristics, the mode of action, the origin, the role under natural conditions and the range of hosts or target organisms, if relevant. Subsequently, the scientific literature and/or the results of special environmental tests should be used to assess the safety of biopesticides to the environment...|$|R

40|$|A {{method of}} {{characterization}} <b>of</b> airborne <b>micro-organisms</b> {{in a given}} location involves (1) large-volume filtration of air onto glass-fiber filters; (2) accelerated extraction of membrane lipids <b>of</b> the collected <b>micro-organisms</b> by use <b>of</b> pressurized hot liquid; and (3) identification and quantitation of the lipids by use of gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. This method is suitable for use in both outdoor and indoor environments; for example, {{it can be used}} to measure airborne microbial contamination in buildings ("sick-building syndrome"). The classical approach to analysis <b>of</b> airborne <b>micro-organisms</b> is based on the growth <b>of</b> cultureable <b>micro-organisms</b> and does not provide an account of viable but noncultureable micro-organisms, which typically amount to more than 90 percent <b>of</b> the <b>micro-organisms</b> present. In contrast, the present method provides an account <b>of</b> all <b>micro-organisms,</b> including cultureable, noncultureable, aerobic, and anaerobic ones.
