50|$|Another {{variation}} is a hybrid between VAV and CAV systems. In this system, the interior zones operate as in a VAV system. The outer zones differ {{in that the}} heating is supplied by a <b>heating</b> <b>fan</b> in a central location usually with a heating coil fed by the building boiler. The heated air is ducted to the exterior dual duct mixing boxes and dampers controlled by the zone thermostat calling for either cooled or heated air as needed.|$|E
40|$|A 3 D {{printing}} {{fused filament}} fabrication (FFF) {{approach has been}} implemented {{for the creation of}} microstructures having an internal 3 D microstructure geometry. These objects were produced without any sacrificial structures or additional support materials, just by precisely tuning the nozzle <b>heating,</b> <b>fan</b> cooling and translation velocity parameters. The manufactured microporous structures out of polylactic acid (PLA) had fully controllable porosity (20 %– 60 %) and consisted of desired volume pores (~ 0. 056 μm 3). The prepared scaffolds showed biocompatibility and were suitable for the primary stem cell growth. In addition, direct laser writing (DLW) ablation was employed to modify the surfaces of the PLA structures, drill holes, as well as shape the outer geometries of the created objects. The proposed combination of FFF printing with DLW offers successful fabrication of 3 D microporous structures with functionalization capabilities, such as the modification of surfaces, the generation of grooves and microholes and cutting out precisely shaped structures (micro-arrows, micro-gears). The produced structures could serve as biomedical templates for cell culturing, as well as biodegradable implants for tissue engineering. The additional micro-architecture is important in connection with the cell types used for the intention of cell growing. Moreover, we show that surface roughness can be modified at the nanoscale by immersion into an acetone bath, thus increasing the hydrophilicity. The approach is not limited to biomedical applications, it could be employed for the manufacturing of bioresorbable 3 D microfluidic and micromechanic structures...|$|E

50|$|Sparse {{attendance}} was a problem; games were held on weekdays. The final series in 2000 even included two games played at noon in 100-degree <b>heat.</b> <b>Fans</b> {{of the participating}} teams had insufficient time to arrange plans to attend the event.

50|$|Fans {{are used}} when natural {{convection}} {{is insufficient to}} remove <b>heat.</b> <b>Fans</b> may be fitted to the computer case or attached to CPUs, GPUs, chipset, PSU, hard drives, or as cards plugged into an expansion slot. Common fan sizes include 40, 60, 80, 92, 120, and 140 mm. 200, 230, and 250 mm fans are sometimes used in high-performance personal computers.|$|R

However, {{they should not be}} seen as an alternative to an air curtain, which also serves to separate the indoor and outdoor air spaces.|$|R
5|$|After {{breaking}} his own Miami Heat single-season scoring record, Wade gave the jersey he wore in that night's victory to 8-year-old Michael Stolzenberg, an avid <b>Heat</b> <b>fan</b> that {{had his hands}} and feet removed surgically due to a bacterial infection. Wade stated that he knew Stolzenberg previously and wished to add to his collection of Heat memorabilia. Wade has been known for visiting other sick children, usually in private to avoid placing himself in the media spotlight.|$|R
5000|$|The song {{has been}} used in the hype videos played before each Miami Heat home game in the 2012-13 and 2013-14 seasons. The famous {{underlying}} riff of the song is also sung frequently by <b>Heat</b> <b>fans</b> as a chant. After the Heat's popularization of the song's main riff as a [...] "battle cry", many other NBA teams have started using it for the same effect, and it is now in essence the NBA [...] "battle song". During the 2013 NBA Finals 3rd game between the San Antonio Spurs and the <b>Heat,</b> Spurs <b>fans</b> used the chant when they won the game to mock the Heat's use of the song in their hype video. The fans also used the chant in game 5 of the 2014 NBA Finals, also against the Heat, when the Spurs won the NBA championship in five games.|$|R

However, all wasn’t well behind closed doors, and following the exit of previous Chairman and main sponsor Robert Banks, the club announced on 12 February 2009 that it had gone into administration but with a buyout imminent. The franchise’s assets were purchased by local businessman Alan McClafferty, a <b>Heat</b> <b>fan</b> and volunteer coach in the club’s youth setup.|$|R

Even with a common <b>heat</b> sink and <b>fan</b> attached, typical processor operating temperatures may still reach up to 70 °C (160 °F). A thermosiphon can efficiently transfer heat over a much wider temperature range and can typically maintain the processor temperature 10-20 °C cooler than a traditional <b>heat</b> sink and <b>fan.</b> In some cases, {{it is also possible}} that a thermosiphon may be more compact than an appropriately sized conventional <b>heat</b> sink and <b>fan.</b>|$|R
