5|$|Kirchner died on 27 October 2010, {{at the age}} of 60. The <b>day</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> {{national}} holiday for the INDEC to run a national census, so he was at home in El Calafate. After a cardiac arrest, Kirchner was rushed to a local hospital and was pronounced dead at 9:15a.m. He had undergone two medical procedures that year: surgery on his right carotid artery in February and an angioplasty in September. His death was a surprise for the Argentinian population, to whom he had always represented his heart problems as not very serious.|$|E
5|$|The first Jackie Robinson Day was on April 15, 2004. That <b>day</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> {{start to}} an annual {{tradition}} throughout Major League Baseball and an inspirational reminder about what happened on that day exactly fifty-seven years earlier when Jackie Robinson became a Major League Baseball player. The day {{would be the first}} official league-wide Jackie Robinson Day, having festivities taking place at all 23 ballparks where Major League games were scheduled to be played. Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig made the announcement with Sharon Robinson (daughter of Rachel and Jackie Robinson).|$|E
5|$|When Macbeth {{returns to}} the witches later in the play, they show him an {{apparition}} of the murdered Banquo, along with eight kings of his family, descending through Fleance. King James, on the throne when Macbeth was written, was the ninth Stuart king. This scene thus suggests strong support for James' right to the throne by lineage, and for audiences of Shakespeare's <b>day,</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> tangible fulfilment of the witches' prophecy. The apparition is also deeply unsettling to Macbeth, who not only wants the throne for himself, but also desires to father a line of kings.|$|E

5|$|Although Gibraltar's {{civilian}} inhabitants {{had started}} to return as early as April 1944, the last evacuees did not arrive back home until as late as February 1951. The immediate problem after VJ <b>Day</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> lack of shipping, as all available vessels were needed to bring troops home, but the longer-term problem {{was a lack of}} civilian housing. The garrison was relocated to {{the southern end of the}} peninsula to free up space and military accommodation was temporarily reused to house the returning civilians. A programme to build housing projects was implemented, though progress was slow due to shortages of building materials. By 1969, over 2,500 flats had either been built or were under construction.|$|E
5|$|The Browns next {{beat the}} Los Angeles Dons 31–14 in Cleveland {{to extend their}} winning streak to seven games. The crowd of 71,134 people who {{attended}} the game on a sunny October <b>day</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> professional football record. Cleveland {{got off to a}} slow start, falling behind 7–3 at halftime. The Browns' only score in the first half came on a 49-yard Lou Groza field goal, then the fourth-longest kick in professional football history. A flurry of scoring {{at the end of the}} third quarter and in the fourth quarter, however, won Cleveland the game. Otto Graham passed 36 yards to end Dante Lavelli and then ran in a touchdown with less than three minutes left in the third. It was the first of four touchdowns in 14 minutes of play. Fullback Marion Motley ran in two touchdowns in the fourth quarter, one of them a 68-yard run that tied an AAFC record for a rush from scrimmage. The Browns won despite a strong ground attack by the Dons, who gained 274 yards of rushing. The Dons had 21 first downs compared to Cleveland's 10. Groza made all of his extra point attempts, extending his streak to 22 in a row.|$|E
5|$|The {{preferred}} {{method of}} honor killing in that <b>day</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> duel. Despite Cooke's admonition that Sharp {{would not accept}} a challenge to duel, Beauchamp traveled to Frankfort to gain an audience with him. He had recently been named the state's attorney general by Governor John Adair. Beauchamp's account of the interview states that he bullied and humiliated Sharp, that Sharp begged for his life, and that Beauchamp promised to horsewhip Sharp every day until he consented to the duel. For two days, Beauchamp remained in Frankfort, awaiting the duel. He discovered that Sharp had left town, allegedly destined for Bowling Green. Beauchamp rode to Bowling Green, {{only to find that}} Sharp was not there and was not expected. Sharp was saved from Beauchamp's first attempt on his life.|$|E

5|$|Thomas <b>Day</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> {{bachelor}} who {{had inherited}} his fortune {{from his father}} {{when he was an}} infant. Described as having a face pockmarked from smallpox, a brooding personality, and a short temper, Day attended Corpus Christi College, Oxford, to study philosophy. It was there that he decided to dedicate his life to becoming a virtuous man, shunning luxury and focusing on altruism. Around the same time he developed a list of requirements for his future wife, that she should be subservient and pure but also able to discuss philosophy and live without frivolities. These high standards, combined with his generally unlikeable personality, meant that his advances were rejected by several women while he was at university.|$|E
