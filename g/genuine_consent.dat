40|$|Background Currently {{there is}} {{increasing}} recognition {{of the need for}} research in developing countries where disease burden is high. Understanding the role of local factors is important for undertaking ethical research in developing countries. We explored factors relating to information and communication during the process of informed consent, and the approach that should be followed for gaining consent. The study was conducted prior to a family-based genetic study among people with podoconiosis (non-filarial elephantiasis) in southern Ethiopia. Methodology/Principal Findings We adapted a method of rapid assessment validated in The Gambia. The methodology was entirely qualitative, involving focus-group discussions and in-depth interviews. Discussions were conducted with podoconiosis patients and non-patients in the community, fieldworkers, researchers, staff of the local non-governmental organisation (NGO) working on prevention and treatment of podoconiosis, and community leaders. We found that the extent of use of everyday language, the degree to which expectations of potential participants were addressed, and the techniques of presentation of information had considerable impact on comprehension of information provided about research. Approaching podoconiosis patients via locally trusted individuals and preceding individual consent with community sensitization were considered the optimal means of communication. Prevailing poverty among podoconiosis patients, the absence of alternative treatment facilities, and participants' trust in the local NGO were identified as potential barriers for obtaining <b>genuine</b> informed <b>consent.</b> Conclusions Researchers should evaluate the effectiveness of consent processes in providing appropriate information in a comprehensible manner and in supporting voluntary decision-making on a study-by-study basis...|$|R

30|$|In {{biomedical}} research, {{discussions of}} consent primarily {{focused on how}} to ensure valid consent when the nature of research and the related potential {{risks and benefits of}} participation are unknown. This issue has been acknowledged by many commentators as equally challenging in human microbiome research (Ma et al., 2017; Rhodes, 2016; McGuire et al., 2008; McGuire et al., 2012): although it is already common practice to collect and store microbiome samples from people as well as their personal medical data, given our limited knowledge about the human microbiome, it is almost impossible for researchers to provide a full explanation about specific research related information using microbiome samples. Moreover, in human microbiome biobanking research, microbial samples are collected from multiple body sites and will be linked with human host’s data, but we are unable to predict the future research and the potential risks associated with that research. These facts raise an important ethical issue as whether participants should be permitted to give general consent to unknown future research and whether this form of consent is “valid” and “voluntary”. Some argues that it is acceptable that participants are informed the uncertainty inherent in conducting microbial research as a condition of participation, while research advances and new risks and benefits discovered, changes to the consent process are necessary (McGuire et al., 2008). But this practice faces similar critique as in human biobank regarding the erosion of participant’s protection of autonomy in decision-making (Caulfield, 2007). General <b>consent</b> is not <b>genuine</b> valid <b>consent</b> because it deprives the opportunity to withdraw if the nature of future research is not consistent with the values and priorities of participants. Another unique problem in human microbiome relates to the stability and dynamic nature of microbiome samples. It is questionable about the value and necessity of re-consent in microbiome biobanking research, which may be unnecessary and unfeasible as microbiome sample collected may not be identifiable to the same person over time.|$|R
40|$|In this article, {{the author}} {{challenges}} the received wisdom of 2 ̆ 2 gap-filling {{in the absence}} of consent 2 ̆ 2 by showing how the concept of default rules bolsters the theoretical importance of consent. He accomplishes this by expanding and refining his analysis of a 2 ̆ 2 consent theory of contract. 2 ̆ 2 The author proposes that the concept of default rules reveals consent to be operating at two distinct levels of contract theory. First, the presence of consent to be legally bound is essential to justify the legal enforcement of any default rules. Second, nested within this overall consent to be legally bound, consent also operates to justify the selection of particular default rules. In part I, the author elaborates in some detail on the essential social functions that consent plays in the liberal conception of justice and the rule of law. He discusses how the consensual element of contract that comprises the liberal principle of freedom of contract addresses the pervasive social problems of knowledge and of interest. Freedom of contract entails both freedom to contract-the power to effect one 2 ̆ 7 s legal relations by consent-and freedom from contract-the immunity from having one 2 ̆ 7 s rights to resources transferred without one 2 ̆ 7 s consent. Working together, these two components of contractual freedom harness the personal and local knowledge possessed by individuals and associations by enabling them to put their own knowledge into action while taking into account the vast knowledge possessed by others of which they are necessarily ignorant. Moreover, these components of contractual freedom also address the problem of interest by providing incentives both to use the knowledge in one 2 ̆ 7 s possession and {{to take into account the}} knowledge of others. In part II, the author uses this functional analysis of consent to explain the important justificatory role played by manifestations of consent. He shows how, by manifesting their intention to be legally bound, contracting parties are implicitly committing themselves to the jurisdiction of a legal system that is thereby justified in using the background rules of contract law to fill the gaps in their agreement. Under certain circumstances, this 2 ̆ 2 consent to jurisdiction 2 ̆ 2 would also justify the enforcement of any promulgated set of default rules. In sum, a consent to be legally bound provides a necessary but only sometimes sufficient justification for enforcing whatever set of default rules may be promulgated by a legal system. In part Ill, the author argues that, within a consent theory of contract, silence can be meaningful and that its meaning should influence our choice of default rules when the circumstances described in part II are absent. He defends his 2 ̆ 2 consent theory of contract 2 ̆ 2 against Richard Craswell 2 ̆ 7 s recent criticism that, whatever other justificatory virtues it may have, a consent theory of contract cannot assist in selecting among possible default rules. In particular, the author shows how a consent theory provides two compelling reasons to choose default rules that reflect the conventional or commonsense understanding existing in the relevant community of discourse. First, conventionalist default rules are likely to reflect the tacit subjective agreement of the parties and thereby facilitate the social functions of consent. Second, when parties have asymmetric access to the background rules of contract, enforcing conventionalist default rules will reduce subjective disagreements by providing parties who are rationally informed of the background rules with an incentive to educate those parties who are rationally ignorant of these rules. This, too, facilitates the social functioning of consent. In sum, where a consent to jurisdiction exists but is insufficient to justify the enforcement of any promulgated set of default rules, consent justifies the enforcement of conventionalist default rules. In part IV, the author takes up the issue of why objective or manifested consent can be considered as 2 ̆ 2 real 2 ̆ 2 or <b>genuine</b> as subjective <b>consent.</b> He discusses how the concept of default rules not only reconciles the idea of gap-fillers with consent as the basis of contractual obligation, but also may justify a more radical change in the legal system that makes contract law. In particular, it may support a horizontal legal order composed of competing legal systems, in contrast to the relatively vertical, monopolistic legal order we live in today. Finally, in Part V, he concludes by briefly discussing the difficult methodological problem of determining the commonsense or conventional meaning of silence...|$|R

40|$|Background: Obtaining genuine {{informed}} consent from research participants {{in developing countries}} can be difficult, partly due to poor knowledge about research process and research ethics. The situation is complicated when conducting genomic research on a disease considered familial and a reason for stigmatisation. Methods: We used a Rapid Ethical Appraisal tool to assess local factors that were barriers to getting genuine {{informed consent}} prior to conducting a genetic study of podoconiosis (non-filarial elephantiasis) in two Zones of Ethiopia. The tool included in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with patients, healthy community members, field workers, researchers/Institutional Review Board (IRB) members, elders, religious leaders, and podoconiosis administrators who work closely with patients. Results: Most patients and healthy community members did not differentiate research from routine clinical diagnosis. Participants felt comfortable when approached {{in the presence of}} trusted community members. Field workers and podoconiosis administrators preferred verbal consent, whereas the majority of patients and healthy community members prefer both verbal and written consent. Participants better understood genetic susceptibility concepts when analogies drawn from their day-to-day experience were used. The type of biological sample sought and gender were the two most important factors affecting the recruitment process. Most researchers and IRB members indicated that reporting incidental findings to participants is not a priority in an Ethiopian context. Conclusions: Understanding the concerns of local people in areas where research is to be conducted facilitates the design of contextualized consent processes appropriate for all parties and will ultimately result in getting <b>genuine</b> <b>consent...</b>|$|E

40|$|The United States Supreme Court’s 2014 {{decision}} in Daimler AG v. Bauman changed how the courts {{will determine whether}} companies {{should be subject to}} general personal jurisdiction. In 1945, Pennoyer v. Neff’s geographical fixation gave way to International Shoe Co. v. Washington, which provided a test for courts to determine whether corporations had sufficient contact with a forum to meet the bar for personal jurisdiction there. Specific jurisdiction requires “minimum contacts,” provided the action is satisfactorily related to the forum. However, to be subject to general jurisdiction, a corporation must possess more than just “minimum contacts,” and claimants can bring actions in forums where companies are subject to general jurisdiction regardless of whether those actions have any relationship to that forum. Precisely how much contact a company must have with a forum to be subject to general jurisdiction has evolved since International Shoe, and Daimler is the most current iteration. Analyzing general jurisdiction by pinpointing a company’s level of contact with a particular forum can be a superfluous exercise. The case law has developed such that “consent” can overcome even a remarkable lack of contacts with a particular forum and subject a company to general jurisdiction. Some courts have interpreted a corporation’s registration and appointment of someone to accept service of process in a state as implied consent to general jurisdiction. Others at least require a state’s registration procedure to explicitly mandate the company submit to general jurisdiction. Daimler, and its recent progeny, may have signaled the death knell for at least implied consent to general jurisdiction by virtue of registration and perhaps for explicit consent as well. Some courts and commentators are rightly noting that mandating consent as {{the cost of doing business}} in a particular forum is consent in name only. While courts used to give credence to the legal fictions of corporate consent and corporate presence, they are now striking them down as violations of the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. This Note seeks to address how states can maintain general jurisdiction over corporations that do not meet Daimler’s apparent demand that a company be “at home” in the forum. The inevitable chipping away of states’ registration statutes as sufficient (impliedly or explicitly) for general jurisdiction potentially leaves a viable alternative intact: <b>genuine</b> <b>consent.</b> States might look to structure a form of incentive based consent by use of their regulatory or taxing authority. States can craft solutions based on how important it is to them to provide their courtrooms to those who would seek redress from corporations operating within their borders. Additionally, an incentive-based <b>genuine</b> <b>consent</b> to jurisdiction serves the ancillary benefit of ensuring more companies go through the proper channels of a state’s registration process, including filling out the appropriate paperwork, instead of operating outside its bounds. After Daimler, states will have to decide whether, and how, to adapt their corporate registration statutes to ensure their courts remain open to claims based on general jurisdiction. This Note will put forward solutions so that states will be able to craft new legislation before the courts invalidate their reliance on fictional consent...|$|E
40|$|The Canadian Criminal Code {{currently}} prohibits {{any contact}} with a non-human animal {{for the purpose of}} human sexual gratification. This prohibition dates back unbroken {{to the creation of a}} Canadian jurisdiction, and was in existence under British law prior to that. Peter Singer has recently asked whether zoophilia is always worthy of legal sanction and moral condemnation. More specifically: Singer wonders whether instances of zoophilic contact that cause no apparent harm to participants can rightly be considered liable to such sanction or condemnation. Critics of Singer's stance most frequently cite the supposed inability of a nonhuman animal to render <b>genuine</b> <b>consent</b> to zoophilic contacts as sufficient grounds to make zoophilia morally problematic without exception. If one takes non-human consent seriously, however, then one cannot avoid making human interventions into the lives of non-human animals almost universally problematic.

This examination suggests a different approach to determining the proper moral and legal status of zoophilic activities by regarding any such interactions within the moral and legal contexts of fiduciary relationships.

40|$|High-stakes multidistrict litigations saddle the {{transferee}} {{judges who}} manage {{them with an}} odd juxtaposition of power and impotence. On one hand, judges appoint and compensate lead lawyers (who effectively replace parties’ chosen counsel) and promote settlement with scant appellate scrutiny or legislative oversight. But on the other, without the arsenal class certification once afforded, judges are relatively powerless to police the private settlements they encourage. Of course, this power shortage is of little concern since parties consent to settle. Or do they? Contrary to conventional wisdom, this Article introduces new empirical data revealing that judges appoint an overwhelming number of repeat players to leadership positions, which may complicate <b>genuine</b> <b>consent</b> through inadequate representation. Repeat players’ financial, reputational, and reciprocity concerns can govern their interactions {{with one another and}} opposing counsel, often trumping fidelity to their clients. Systemic pathologies can result: dictatorial attorney hierarchies that fail to adequately represent the spectrum of claimants’ diverse interests, repeat players trading in influence to increase their fees, collusive private deals that lack a viable monitor, and malleable procedural norms that undermine predictability. Current judicial practices feed these pathologies. First, when judges appoint lead lawyers early in the litigation based on cooperative tendencies, experience, and financial resources, they often select repeat players. But most conflicts do not arise until discovery and repeat players have few self-interested reasons to dissent or derail the lucrative settlements they negotiate. Second, because steering committees are a relatively new phenomenon and transferee judges have no formal powers beyond those in the Federal Rules, judges have pieced together various doctrines to justify compensating lead lawyers. The erratic fee awards that result lack coherent limits. So, judges then permit lead lawyers to circumvent their rulings and the doctrinal inconsistencies by contracting with the defendant to embed fee provisions in global settlements — a well recognized form of self-dealing. Yet, when those settlements ignite concern, judges lack the formal tools to review them. These pathologies need not persist. Appointing cognitively diverse attorneys who represent heterogeneous clients, permitting third-party financing, encouraging objections and dissent from non-lead counsel, and selecting permanent leadership after conflicts develop can expand the pool of qualified applicants and promote adequate representation. Compensating these lead lawyers on a quantum-meruit basis could then smooth doctrinal inconsistencies, align these fee awards with other attorneys’ fees, and impose dependable outer limits. Finally, because quantum meruit demands that judges assess the benefit lead lawyers’ conferred on the plaintiffs and the results they achieved, it equips judges with a private-law basis for assessing nonclass settlements and harnesses their review to a very powerful carrot: attorneys’ fees...|$|E
