5|$|<b>Hanging</b> scroll: <b>Hanging</b> scrolls {{originated}} in their earliest form from literature and other texts written on bamboo strips and silk banners in ancient China. The earliest <b>hanging</b> scrolls {{are related to}} and developed from silk banners in early Chinese history. These banners were long and hung vertically on walls. Such silk banners and <b>hanging</b> scroll paintings were found at Mawangdui {{dating back to the}} Han Dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE). By the time of the Tang Dynasty (618–907), the aesthetic and structural objectives for <b>hanging</b> scrolls were summarized, which are still followed to this day. During the early Song Dynasty (960–1279), the scrolls became well suited to the art styles of the artists, consequently <b>hanging</b> scrolls were made in many different sizes and proportions.|$|E

5|$|Although {{conclusive}} evidence might be wanting either way for whether Hebrew Law allowed for impalement, or just <b>hanging,</b> the Neo-Assyrian method of impalement {{as seen in}} the carvings could, perhaps, equally easily be seen as a form of <b>hanging</b> upon a pole, rather than focusing upon the stake's actual penetration of the body.|$|E
25|$|The {{collection}} {{also includes}} the Oxburgh <b>Hangings,</b> which were made by Mary, Queen of Scots and Bess of Hardwick. However, the Oxburgh <b>Hangings</b> are on permanent long-term loan at Oxburgh Hall.|$|R
50|$|Brown's next <b>hangings</b> came in December, and he {{assisted}} both Ellis and Thomas Pierrepoint for {{the rest}} of the decade. All in all, he participated in 22 <b>hangings.</b> His last job was on 7 October 1919.|$|R
50|$|The hall is also {{notable for}} the Oxburgh <b>Hangings,</b> {{needlework}} <b>hangings</b> by Mary, Queen of Scots and Bess of Hardwick. Mary worked on these while imprisoned in England, {{in the custody}} of the Earl of Shrewsbury.|$|R
5|$|Although the Act of Parliament {{defining}} {{high treason}} {{remains on the}} United Kingdom's statute books, during {{a long period of}} 19th-century legal reform the sentence of <b>hanging,</b> drawing, and quartering was changed to drawing, <b>hanging</b> until dead, and posthumous beheading and quartering, before being abolished in England in 1870. The death penalty for treason was abolished in 1998.|$|E
5|$|Bats are {{adapted to}} roosting, <b>hanging</b> upside {{down from their}} feet. The femurs are {{attached}} at the hips {{in a way that}} allows them to bend outward and upward in flight. The ankle joint can flex so as to allow the trailing edge of the wings to bend downwards. However, this design does not permit many movements other than <b>hanging</b> or clambering up trees. Most megabats roost with the head tucked towards the belly, whereas most microbats roost with the neck curled towards the back. This difference is reflected {{in the structure of the}} cervical vertebrae in the two groups, which are clearly distinct. Tendons allow bats to lock their feet closed when <b>hanging</b> from a roost. Muscular power is needed to let go, but not to grasp a perch or when holding on.|$|E
5|$|Since {{at least}} the Han dynasty, such media {{have been used to}} create <b>hanging</b> scrolls and handscrolls.|$|E
5000|$|Twenty-nine <b>hangings</b> {{took place}} over {{the next twenty years}} and 71 took place in the 20th century, {{bringing}} the total number to 100. During {{the second half of the}} century, the number of executions decreased, with no <b>hangings</b> between 1954 and 28 November 1962, when James Smith was executed. John Robson Walby (alias Gwynne Owen Evans), one of the last two people to be hanged in England, was executed here on 13 August 1964. Out of the 100 <b>hangings,</b> four were double <b>hangings,</b> while the rest were done individually. The [...] "quickest hanging" [...] of James Inglis in seven seconds, carried out by Albert Pierrepoint, took place here.|$|R
25|$|In 1868, <b>hangings</b> {{were moved}} to the State Prison in Concord, after a riot {{followed}} the execution of Samuel Mills on {{the main street of}} Woodsville. Prior to the 1868 execution, <b>hangings</b> were carried out in public.|$|R
25|$|A {{medium of}} Late Gothic style that is easily {{overlooked}} {{because it has}} virtually entirely disappeared is that of painted <b>hangings,</b> which served as a less expensive substitute for woven <b>hangings</b> but could be produced, with appropriate themes, on short notice.|$|R

5|$|The Iazyges used <b>hanging</b> {{barrel-shaped}} pots {{that were}} asymmetrical, and had uneven weight distribution. The rope to hang the pot was {{wrapped around the}} edges of the side collar, it is believed that the rope was tied tightly to the pot, allowing the pot to spin in circles, due to the spinning motion, several theories have been made of the use of the pots. It is believed that the smaller <b>hanging</b> pots were used to ferment alcohol, by use of the seeds of touch-me-not balsam (Impatiens noli-tangere), and the larger <b>hanging</b> pots were used to churn butter and make cheese. They were cattle breeders, and as such required salt in order to preserve their meat, however, the Iazyges had no salt mines within their land. According to Dio, the Iazyges received grain from the Romans.|$|E
5|$|What Bethesda had {{originally}} disclosed to us, as an example: In {{that section of}} the game, there is a <b>hanging</b> corpse. What they disclosed to us was a <b>hanging</b> corpse in the dark, pretty far away and without much detail. And yet, when you bring a torch up to the <b>hanging</b> corpse in the actual game, {{you can see that}} it's very mutilated with lots of blood and bones. That was a very different depiction, far more intense, far more extreme than what had been disclosed to us.|$|E
5000|$|Historically, Placerville {{was often}} {{referred}} to by the name [...] "Hangtown," [...] because of the frequent <b>hangings</b> {{that occurred in the}} lawless area. Those traveling in the area can still see the old hangman's platform that was used for public <b>hangings.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{coming of}} fall brings the usual routine housecleaning {{and with it}} the desire for new <b>hangings</b> [...] It has always been a simple enough problem for the woman with {{unlimited}} means to purchase attractive <b>hangings</b> for her home. The time was when the limited purse bought only the plainest white curtains, and as a result the room lacked personality. Today an entirely different situation exists. It is possible now to make attractive <b>hangings</b> at a nominal cost...|$|R
5000|$|Crewel {{embroidery}} was, in the past, embroidered {{to create}} elaborate and expensive bed <b>hangings</b> and curtains. Now {{it is most}} often used to decorate cushions, curtains, clothing and wall <b>hangings.</b> Recently several other items such as lamp shades and handbags have been added.|$|R
5|$|About {{five months}} after Wilde arrived at Reading Gaol, Charles Thomas Wooldridge, a trooper in the Royal Horse Guards, was brought to Reading to await his trial for murdering his wife on 29 March 1896; on 17 June Wooldridge {{was sentenced to death}} and {{returned}} to Reading for his execution, which took place on Tuesday, 7 July 1896 – the first <b>hanging</b> at Reading in 18 years. From Wooldridge's <b>hanging,</b> Wilde later wrote The Ballad of Reading Gaol.|$|E

5|$|Banksia caleyi, {{commonly}} known as the red lantern banksia or Caley's banksia, is a species of woody shrub of the family Proteaceae native to Western Australia. It generally grows as a dense shrub up to 2m (7ft) tall, has serrated leaves and unusual red, pendent (<b>hanging)</b> inflorescences which are generally hidden in the foliage. First described by Scottish naturalist Robert Brown in 1830, Banksia caleyi was named in honour of the English botanist George Caley. No subspecies are recognised. It is one of three or four related species with <b>hanging</b> inflorescences, which is an unusual feature within the genus.|$|E
6000|$|... "Look!" [...] he gasped. [...] "It is {{the corpse}} of O-Mai! Ancestor of ancestors! {{we are in the}} {{forbidden}} chamber." [...] Simultaneously there came from behind the <b>hangings</b> beyond the grewsome dead a hollow moan followed by a piercing scream, and the <b>hangings</b> shook and bellied before their eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would not}} have a man the slave of his ideals. <b>Hangings</b> make the room comfortable, but, after all, <b>hangings</b> are <b>hangings.</b> Perhaps, now and then--of course, I would not suggest continual inconstancy--a slight change, a little rearrangement, even a partial replacement, might {{brighten}} up the dear old dwelling-place. An ideal may be clung to too fondly. When the moth gets into it, or the dust--did not Carlyle warn us against this, lest they 'accumulate and at last produce suffocation'? I am exactly at one with him there.|$|R

5|$|Booth was {{strongly}} {{opposed to the}} abolitionists who sought to end slavery in the U.S. He attended the <b>hanging</b> of abolitionist leader John Brown on December 2, 1859, who was executed for leading a raid on the Federal armory at Harpers Ferry in present-day West Virginia. Booth had been rehearsing at the Richmond Theatre when he abruptly decided to join the Richmond Grays, a volunteer militia of 1,500men traveling to Charles Town for Brown's <b>hanging,</b> to guard against an attempt by abolitionists to rescue Brown from the gallows by force. When Brown was hanged without incident, Booth stood in uniform near the scaffold and afterwards expressed great satisfaction with Brown's fate, although he admired the condemned man's bravery in facing death stoically.|$|E
5|$|Despite this plea, at 15:00 he {{was sentenced}} to death by <b>hanging,</b> which was carried out on 28 January 1949 in Hamelin. No other German {{soldiers}} or officers were prosecuted for their roles in the massacre.|$|E
5|$|Each guest's {{positioning}} in {{the painting}} has its own meaning. In the foreground there is a dancer wearing the colours of that time period {{and there are many}} peasants in that area. In the middle there is the bride dancing with an older man, her father. On the right of the work, there is a musician playing on a pijpzak, who is watching the dance from the side. Judging by the writing utensils <b>hanging</b> on his belt, he is a writer or possibly a middle-class painter. Behind him is a <b>hanging</b> tablecloth decorated with a crown and beneath it is the bride's table. Before her table, money collectors can be seen digging trenches while the wedding guests sit down and eat.|$|E

5|$|High water {{volume in}} wet seasons {{does most of}} the downcutting in the main canyon. These flood events are {{responsible}} for transporting most of the 3millionshorttons (2.7millionmetrictons) of rock and sediment that the Virgin River transports yearly. The Virgin cuts away its canyon faster than its tributaries can cut away their own streambeds, so tributaries end in waterfalls from <b>hanging</b> valleys where they meet the Virgin. The valley between the peaks of the Twin Brothers is a notable example of a <b>hanging</b> valley in the canyon.|$|E
