5|$|The USPTO will {{contact the}} senior {{registrant}} to inform that {{party of the}} claim against their mark. The proceeding in which the respective rights of the parties are determined is like a trial in which the applicant must submit evidence showing that the applicant had adopted the mark in good faith, that the applicant had adopted the mark prior to the senior registrant's <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>registration,</b> and that the confusion is not likely. The senior registrant may present evidence to the contrary, {{in order to prevent}} the loss of control over the use of the registered mark in the applicant's claimed territory. Both parties may take discovery in the form of requests for admission, interrogatories, requests for production, and depositions. As with a regular trial, the TTAB may be called upon to resolve disputes over whether discovery requests are overbroad, and whether discovery responses are inadequate.|$|E
25|$|Outside of the United States the {{registration}} process is substantially {{similar to that}} found in the U.S. save for one notable exception in many countries: registration occurs prior to the opposition proceeding.

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of 2008 AIB entered the Latvian, Estonian and Lithuanian markets by acquiring the AmCredit mortgage finance business from the Baltic American Enterprise Fund. Now AIB operates as a branch of this financial group in Estonia and Lithuania (update needed), operations in Latvia have ceased (see below). In 2008 AIB operated through its local branches providing financial services under established AmCredit brand in all three countries. AmCredit operated as a single product mortgage business, but the company is expanding the range of banking products. All AmCredit's mortgage customers automatically became customers of the AIB branch in their country. The goal of AIB {{is to become a}} full service customer focused bank in the Baltic region. The branch in Latvia was operating between November 26, 2007 (<b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>registration)</b> and September 20, 2012 (date of liquidation). Its mortgage portfolio of 800 loans was acquired by Swedbank.|$|E
