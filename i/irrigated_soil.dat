5000|$|The {{quality of}} {{irrigation}} water {{is very important}} to maintain soil fertility and tilth, and for using more soil depth by the plants. When soil is irrigated with high alkaline water, unwanted sodium salts build up in the soil which would make soil draining capacity very poor. So plant roots can not penetrate deep into the soil for optimum growth in Alkali soils. When soil is irrigated with low pH / acidic water, the useful salts ( [...] Ca, Mg, K, P, S, etc.) are removed by draining water from the acidic soil and in addition unwanted aluminium and manganese salts to the plants are dissolved from the soil impeding plant growth. [...] When soil is irrigated with high salinity water or sufficient water is not draining out from the <b>irrigated</b> <b>soil,</b> the soil would convert into saline soil or lose its fertility.
