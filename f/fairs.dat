5|$|Invitations {{to enter}} the Inter-Cities <b>Fairs</b> Cup, a {{football}} tournament set up to promote industrial trade <b>fairs,</b> were extended to the city hosting the trade fair rather than to clubs. Some cities entered a select team including players {{from more than one}} club, but Aston Villa, the other major club based in the city of Birmingham, rejected the opportunity to field a combined team. Thus Birmingham City became the first English club side to play in European competition when they played their first match in the 1955–58 Inter-Cities <b>Fairs</b> Cup on 15 May 1956. They were also the first English club side to reach a European final, the 1960 <b>Fairs</b> Cup final, in which they met Barcelona. The home leg, a goalless draw, was played on 29 March 1960 and the away leg, which Barcelona won 4–1, some six weeks later. In the semifinal of the 1961 <b>Fairs</b> Cup Birmingham beat Internazionale home and away; no other English club beat them in a competitive match in the San Siro until Arsenal did so in the Champions League over 40 years later.|$|E

5|$|The period {{also saw}} the {{development}} of charter <b>fairs</b> in England, which reached their heyday in the 13th century. From the 12th century onwards, many English towns acquired a charter from the Crown allowing them to hold an annual fair, usually serving a regional or local customer base and lasting {{for two or three}} days. The practice increased in the next century and over 2,200 charters were issued to markets and <b>fairs</b> by English kings between 1200 and 1270. <b>Fairs</b> grew in popularity as the international wool trade increased: the <b>fairs</b> allowed English wool producers and ports on the east coast to engage with visiting foreign merchants, circumnavigating those English merchants in London keen to make a profit as middlemen. At the same time, wealthy magnate consumers in England began to use the new <b>fairs</b> as a way to buy goods like spices, wax, preserved fish and foreign cloth in bulk from the international merchants at the <b>fairs,</b> again bypassing the usual London merchants.|$|E

50|$|<b>Fair</b> Use Week is an {{international}} event that celebrates <b>fair</b> use and <b>fair</b> dealing. <b>Fair</b> Use Week was first proposed on a <b>Fair</b> Use Allies listserv, which was {{an outgrowth of the}} Library Code of Best Practices Capstone Event, celebrating the development and promulgation of ARL’s Code of Best Practices in <b>Fair</b> Use for Academic and Research Libraries. While the idea was not taken up nationally, Kyle K. Courtney, Copyright Advisor at Harvard University, launched the first ever <b>Fair</b> Use Week at Harvard University in February 2014, with a full week of activities celebrating <b>fair</b> use. The first <b>Fair</b> Use Week included blog posts from national and international <b>fair</b> use experts, live <b>fair</b> use panels, <b>fair</b> use workshops, and a <b>Fair</b> Use Stories Tumblr blog, where people from the world of art, music, film, and academia shared stories about the importance of <b>fair</b> use to their community. The first <b>Fair</b> Use Week was so successful that in 2015 ARL teamed up with Courtney and helped organize the Second Annual <b>Fair</b> Use Week, with participation from many more institutions. ARL also launched an official <b>Fair</b> Use Week website, which was transferred from Pia Hunter, who attended the Library Code of Best Practices Capstone Event and had originally purchased the domain name fairuseweek.org.|$|R
40|$|As {{documented}} in previous research, the attitude-behaviour gap (inconsistency between declared values and actual purchases) is phenomena which affects consumption {{in many different}} markets of ethical consumption. The diploma thesis analyses this phenomena, specifically in Czech <b>Fair</b> trade market.

From people with pro <b>Fair</b> trade values who do not buy <b>Fair</b> trade products, approximately half is not aware of <b>Fair</b> trade existence, indicating that lack of <b>Fair</b> trade awareness could be possibly hurting <b>Fair</b> trade sales. When analyzing respondents with pro <b>Fair</b> trade values who also have <b>Fair</b> Trade awareness, the skepticism towards ability of <b>Fair</b> trade movement to fulfill their declared goals and high quality perception of <b>Fair</b> trade products {{turned out to be the}} strongest and statistically significant predictors of whether one buys <b>Fair</b> trade or not. Focus on raising awareness about <b>Fair</b> trade existence, improving quality perception and decreasing skepticism towards <b>Fair</b> trade conversion is suggested for <b>Fair</b> trade marketers for helping to convert people with pro <b>Fair</b> trade values into <b>Fair</b> trade buyers...|$|R
