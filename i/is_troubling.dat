500|$|Negative {{evaluations}} {{condemned the}} film's plot, acting, and screenplay. Roger Ebert of Chicago Sun-Times groused that [...] "perhaps movies are like history, and repeat themselves, first as tragedy, then as farce." [...] James Berardinelli of ReelViews stressed that [...] "the movie mandates complete gullibility and vacuous attention {{in order to}} work on any level." [...] Claudia Puig of USA Today groused on how [...] that [...] "there is an audience for a movie in which innocent people suffer hideous accidental deaths <b>is</b> <b>troubling</b> enough, but a group of creative people chose to direct their energies on this repulsive spectacle [...] simply provokes disgust." [...] Justine Elias of The Village Voice asserted that [...] "this risible thriller is merely a sadistic series of misread premonitions and vile murders." [...] David Grove of Film Threat stated that [...] " [...] wasn’t much scared by anything in Final Destination 2 which is silly and illogical." [...] Jeff Vice of Deseret News censured to [...] "not even get into the awful script or the numbingly awful performances"; while Bruce Fretts of Entertainment Weekly reviled [...] "everything else about the film is also deadly." ...|$|E

2500|$|Huckabee took stances {{opposed to}} the nature of the {{incumbent}} president, Barack Obama. In comments made March 1, 2011, on The Steve Malzberg Show, Huckabee said of Obama, [...] "I would love to know more. What I know <b>is</b> <b>troubling</b> enough. And one thing that I do know is his having grown up in Kenya, his view of the Brits, for example, is very different than the average American." [...] (This is a reference to the Mau Mau Uprising against the colonial rule of the United Kingdom in 1952; Obama himself has never lived in Kenya.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Myc family: The Myc {{family of}} {{transcription}} factors are proto-oncogenes implicated in cancer. Yamanaka et al. and Jaenisch et al. demonstrated that c-myc {{is a factor}} implicated in the generation of mouse iPS cells and Yamanaka et al. demonstrated it was a factor implicated in the generation of human iPS cells. However, Thomson et al., Yamanaka et al. Usage of the [...] "myc" [...] family of genes in induction of iPS cells <b>is</b> <b>troubling</b> for the eventuality of iPS cells as clinical therapies, as 25% of mice transplanted with c-myc-induced iPS cells developed lethal teratomas. N-myc and L-myc have been identified to induce instead of c-myc with similar efficiency.|$|E
2500|$|... "We {{live in a}} {{world in}} which four fifths of its {{population}} live in frustration while the other fifth lives in fear. The United Nations, our world's [...] "figleaf," [...] does not hide the shame of humanity but rather scandalizes humanity's malaise. It <b>is</b> <b>troubling</b> that the League of Nations and the United Nations were born after two world wars. Humanity's unity should come as a natural birth and not as the result of a cesarean section, i.e., through violent global wars. This is reminiscent of the ages of epidemics. Then, because of ignorance about the causes behind these illnesses, plagues swept through communities, leaving millions of dead behind. Yet, after technology made it possible for us to see smaller forms of life and medicine brought us a better understanding of germs, communities became better equipped to halt disease and heal the sufferers.|$|E
2500|$|In a June 3, 2008, op-ed in The Wall Street Journal, Schumer {{wrote that}} {{cooperative}} economic sanctions from the U.S., Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China could topple Iran's theocratic government. In discussing {{the importance of}} Russia's cooperation, Schumer stated that [...] "Mr. Putin is an old-fashioned nationalist who seeks to regain the power and greatness Russia had before {{the fall of the}} Soviet Union." [...] He followed it up by noting that [...] "The anti-missile system strengthens the relationship between Eastern Europe and NATO, with real troops and equipment on the ground. It mocks Mr. Putin's dream of eventually restoring Russian hegemony over Eastern Europe." [...] The East European Coalition sent Schumer a letter regarding the article on June 10, 2008, writing that [...] "As a supporter of democracy for the nations of Eastern Europe, which suffered greatly under 'Russian hegemony over Eastern Europe,' your suggestion that these nations be used as bargaining chips in order to appease Russia <b>is</b> <b>troubling,</b> inexplicable and unacceptable." ...|$|E

50|$|Why all Jerusalem should <b>be</b> <b>troubled</b> <b>is</b> a more {{important}} question. Throughout this chapter Matthew shows the leaders of Jerusalem allied with Herod against the new messiah. These passages have been quoted in support of Christian anti-Semitism. That all Jerusalem is agitated also seems to conflict with later in the Gospel when the people are oblivious to Jesus. France suggests that the passage could perhaps be read as showing {{that the people of}} Jerusalem <b>were</b> <b>troubled</b> because of the possibility of Herod's wrath. Other scholars see this interpretation as being fairly implausible. Brown notes that this phrase originates in Exodus. There is a theory that this part of Matthew is heavily influence by the story of Moses. In Exodus all Egypt <b>is</b> <b>troubled</b> by Moses, not just the Pharaoh. Thus in parallel all Jerusalem must also <b>be</b> <b>troubled.</b> This view <b>was</b> shared by St. Chrysostom.|$|R
2500|$|Feces tend to leak {{from the}} carcass until the {{evisceration}} stage, and the evisceration stage itself gives {{an opportunity for}} the interior of the carcass to receive intestinal bacteria. (The skin of the carcass does as well, but the skin presents a better barrier to bacteria and reaches higher temperatures during cooking.) Before 1950, this was contained largely by not eviscerating the carcass at the time of butchering, deferring this until the time of retail sale or in the home. This gave the intestinal bacteria less opportunity to colonize the edible meat. The development of the [...] "ready-to-cook broiler" [...] in the 1950s added convenience while introducing risk, under the assumption that end-to-end refrigeration and thorough cooking would provide adequate protection. E. coli can be killed by proper cooking times, but there is still some risk associated with it, and its near-ubiquity in commercially farmed chicken <b>is</b> <b>troubling</b> to some. Irradiation has been proposed as a means of sterilizing chicken meat after butchering.|$|E
