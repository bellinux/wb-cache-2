The cabin temperature is controlled by regulating {{the temperature of the}} pressure bleed air that is routed through the cabin. The bleed air is cooled in the heat exchanger by ram air entering the dorsal fin inlet and passing through the heat exchanger. The amount of bleed air cooling at the heat exchanger can be controlled by the <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> bypass <b>valve</b> (H-valve). The H-valve position can be adjusted by the crew to increase or reduce the amount of bleed air cooling at the heat exchanger.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe flow {{condition}} of water supply pipelines {{are affected by}} terrain, buildings and other external factors, easy to produce the complex phenomenon of hydraulic transient. More seriously, it can cause the pipeline rupture, water supply interruption and equipment damage, resulting in huge economic loss. It is necessary to equip the <b>air</b> <b>valves</b> in actual projects to prevent the gas-liquid transient flow. Firstly, this paper illustrated the effect, the type and the principle of <b>air</b> <b>valve</b> in detail. Secondly, combined with the actual projects, the authors analyzed the numerical simulations of water hammer. At last, the authors compared the results of <b>air</b> <b>valve</b> simulation. The results show that by comparison, the two stages closing <b>air</b> <b>valve</b> reduces not only the negative pressure but also the positive pressure than the one stage closing <b>air</b> <b>valve.</b> So the two stages closing <b>air</b> <b>valve</b> for the preventive measure in practical engineering could be effective...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an experimental programme on the dynamic behaviour of <b>air</b> <b>valves</b> {{performed in a}} large-scale pipeline apparatus. Dynamic flow tests were performed at large (full) scale, since previous quasi-steady flow tests at small scale {{did not lead to}} realistic results. Investigations in a large-scale pipeline apparatus lead {{to a better understanding of}} the physical processes associated with the dynamic performance of <b>air</b> <b>valves.</b> Float type <b>air</b> <b>valves</b> of nominal diameter of 50 and 100 mm were tested in geometrically similar 200 and 500 mm test sections, to allow for the assessment of dynamic scale effects and the development of dimensionless parameter groups and dynamic scale laws. The approach in the determination of the dynamic performance of <b>air</b> <b>valves</b> was to measure their response to flow acceleration/ decelerations, which are imposed upon the valve. In this way, the <b>air</b> <b>valve</b> behaviour following events like system start-up, pump trip and pipe rupture is simulated. Key results of the dynamic flow tests, including <b>air</b> release tests (<b>valve</b> slam) and column separation tests (effect of <b>air</b> <b>valve</b> on surge suppression), are presented and discussed...|$|R

50|$|Quadrajet carburetors have {{mechanical}} secondary {{throttle plates}} {{operated by a}} progressive linkage; the primaries open before the secondaries, and use on-demand <b>air</b> <b>valve</b> plates above the secondary throttle plates. The <b>air</b> <b>valves</b> are connected by a cam and linkage to the secondary fuel metering rods. As the airflow increases through the secondary bores, the <b>air</b> <b>valves</b> are pushed down, rotating a cam that lifts the secondary metering rods. The secondary rods are tapered {{in a similar fashion}} to the primary metering rods, effectively increasing the size of the fuel metering holes as the rods are lifted and delivering more fuel. Therefore, the position of the <b>air</b> <b>valve</b> will control both fuel and air flow through the secondary venturis, even if the secondary throttle plates are fully opened. Thus the Quadrajet acts like a vacuum-secondary carburetor and only delivers more fuel as it is needed.|$|R

5000|$|The spread-bore four-barrel carburetor, first {{released}} by Rochester in the 1965 model {{year as the}} [...] "Quadrajet" [...] has a much greater spread between the sizes of the primary and secondary throttle bores. The primaries in such a carburetor are quite small relative to conventional four-barrel practice, while the secondaries are quite large. The small primaries aid low-speed fuel economy and driveability, while the large secondaries permit maximum performance when it is called for. To tailor airflow through the secondary Venturis, each of the secondary throats has an <b>air</b> <b>valve</b> at the top. This is configured much like a choke plate, and is lightly spring-loaded into the closed position. The <b>air</b> <b>valve</b> opens progressively in response to engine speed and throttle opening, gradually allowing more air to flow through the secondary side of the carburetor. Typically, the <b>air</b> <b>valve</b> is linked to metering rods which are raised as the <b>air</b> <b>valve</b> opens, thereby adjusting secondary fuel flow.|$|R

Catfish (order Siluriformes) slices were dehydrated in a microwave assisted <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> convective dehydration (MWHA) system to investigate the effects of microwave power and <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> temperature on drying time, dehydration behaviour, energy consumption and colour of dried fish. Three different microwave power outputs namely medium (373 W), medium low (217 W) and low (91 W) combined with convective <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> temperature of 40 °C, 70 °C and 130 °C accordingly were employed in the drying experiments.

Experiments show that drying time was reduced about 75 % when an increase of microwave power from low (91 W) to medium mode (373 W) combining with convective <b>hot</b> <b>air.</b> However, drying with microwave alone required longer drying time.

The drying rate curves indicated {{the absence of}} a constant-rate drying period in all drying methods. Within a certain microwave power range (75 – 900 W in the current study), increasing microwave power speeds up the drying process, thus shortening the drying time. No benefits were seen when increasing drying time from 30 to 120 min when grapes drying started in <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> cabinet dryer and finished in microwave oven for 1 min at any power level. The higher value of energy consumption during grapes drying belonged to <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> cabinet dryer alone as drying method with value of 564. 5 MJ/kgwater evaporated. The average total soluble solids was 90. 4 ° Brix when drying was achieved by microwave oven followed by <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> cabinet dryer, meanwhile, it was 90. 2 ° Brix when drying was achieved by <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> cabinet dryer followed by microwave oven.
