This will result in greater dependence on storage of raw water in lakes and reservoirs and produce greater variability in water levels as lakes fill and drain. During the 2007 / 08 Level 4 drought in Georgia, Gwinnett County Department of Water Resources (GCDWR) was faced with historical low lake levels in Lake Lanier. Since Lake Lanier is their sole drinking water source, GCDWR was concerned that the lake level could drop below their intake elevations and the entire county of 800, 000 people could be out of water. Faced with such a dire situation, GCDWR was making preparations to contract with a contractor under “emergency authority” to construct a <b>floating</b> <b>intake</b> pump station to withdrawal water {{from the center of}} the lake, which would cost upwards of $ 11 M. GCDWR was faced the circumstance of $ 1 spent too soon or implementation 1 second too late and the opportunity for backlashed was intensified. Therefore, GCDWR contracted with Hazen and Sawyer to develop a reliability model of the lake that predicts the numbers of days remaining until the water level drops below the intake. The model used lake release flows and the historical, worst-case climate conditions for the coming months to estimate the probability and the number of days remaining until their intake goes dry. They were able to see seasonal variation in the water level and understand the cause and effect relationship with the Army Corps of Engineer’s release flows. This was combined with internal procurement practices to create a more effective process that allows GCDWR to make risk-based decisions to implement a cost-effective land-based temporary pump station. Capital expenditures were to be triggered at specific risk levels – combination of lake level and season. Even with the drought behind them, GCDWR now has a contingency plan in place for next drought. Sponsored by: Georgia Environmental Protection Division; U. S.

50|$|Some overall {{changes were}} made to the bikes: the {{handlebars}} were no longer welded to the mounts, the exhaust pipe now ran under the seat, the engines now used a <b>float</b> bowl carburetor/slanted <b>intake</b> combination and the front forks now had internal telescopic suspension. Bikes were offered in various colors, specific to the models.|$|R
50|$|At the front, the new 991 has wide-set {{headlights}} {{that are}} more three-dimensional. Front fender peaks are a bit more prominent, and wedgy directionals now appear to <b>float</b> above the <b>intakes</b> for the twin coolant radiators. The stretched rear 3/4 view has changed the most, with a slightly more voluminous form and thin taillight slivers capped with the protruding lip of the bodywork. The biggest and main change in the interior is the center console, inspired by the Carrera GT and adopted by the Panamera.|$|R
40|$|Riverscreen {{irrigation}} {{pumps are}} {{a relatively new}} design in which the pump <b>intake</b> <b>floats</b> on the river surface, pulling water in only from the bottom side and surrounded by a self-cleaning screen. The Walla Walla County Conservation District recently started replacing old pump screens with the Riverscreen and was interested in whether the screens are protective of juvenile salmonids. Pacific Northwest National Laboratory evaluated approach velocities and operations at the Riverscreen installation on the Dallas Thompson property, approximately 3 mi. north of Touchet, Washington and 300 ft north of Hofer Dam, on June 18, 2007. Evaluation of this site consisted of underwater videography and water velocity measurements. The Dallas Thompson Riverscreen was pumping approximately 930 gpm during our evaluation, which {{is close to the}} maximum pumping rate for this model. Underwater videography showed only slow movement of water-borne particulates toward the pump intake, and the screen material was clean. All water velocity measurements were taken below the pump intake opening and between 3 to 6 in. from the screen face. All approach velocities (flow toward the screen and pump) were below National Marine Fisheries Service draft guidelines for juvenile fish screens...|$|R

40|$|To prevent salp (jellyfish) from {{entering}} Diablo Canyon Power Plant’s intake pipes, and ultimately having the plant shut {{down as a}} result, an air bubble curtain is anchored along the ocean floor {{for the duration of}} the salp swarm to create a barrier that prevents the salp and other debris {{from entering}} the intake. The curtain consists of four large air compressors connected to four parallel pipes with holes strategically drilled at various places along the length of the pipe. When the air compressors are turned on, a torrent of bubbles are shot out from the pipes which create a current which deters the salp from <b>floating</b> into the <b>intake.</b> As the ocean floor shifts with the current and tide, the pipes becomes unlevel and do not produce an adequate barrier of bubbles across the length of the pipe. To improve the bubble curtain, our team was tasked with creating a self-leveling anchor system to work with the existing air bubble curtain pipes. Over the course of the last academic year, we designed, built, and tested a model sized prototype of an anchoring concept that would keep the bubble curtain pipes level. The final design suspends the bubble curtain pipes from buoys. The concept uses the surface of the water to remain level, while a long tether to a ground anchor keeps it from floating freely. Through testing, we determined this design stays level independent of change in floor elevation. However, the effectiveness is dependent on the tide, and works best at low tide and in water with a low tide greater than 20 feet. We recommend designing this system for deeper sections of the intake bay, and implementing it to allow a constant upward slope in the bubble pipe. Before building a complete system, we recommend constructing and testing a partial system to insure it behaves as expected and withstands full-scale ocean conditions...|$|R
