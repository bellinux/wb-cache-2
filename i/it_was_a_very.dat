5|$|On 16 May 2016 a 'terrorist hide' {{was found}} by civilians in Capanagh Forest near Larne, Antrim, {{possibly}} belonging to the New IRA. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> substantial cache.|$|E
5|$|P. l. europaea, {{known as}} the European lion, was {{probably}} identical with Panthera leo persica or Panthera leo spelea. It became extinct around 100 AD due to persecution and over-exploitation. It inhabited the Balkans, the Italian Peninsula, southern France, and the Iberian Peninsula. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> popular object of hunting among ancient Romans and Greeks.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the season}} — nearly two months earlier than the first storm {{formation}} in 2004 — a low-pressure area formed and persisted north of Honduras. Despite significant shear, the low managed to become Tropical Depression One on June 8 just north of Honduras. The depression began to head north towards western Cuba that day, but as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> large and poorly organized system {{under the influence of}} heavy shear, the official forecasts from the National Hurricane Center emphasized that the route the storm would take was uncertain. Despite this uncertainty, the official forecasts were highly accurate in predicting the storm's track. As the shear dropped, the depression strengthened further and it became Tropical Storm Arlene on June 9. It produced precipitation over a very wide area; the Cayman Islands reported tropical storm-force winds and heavy rain over 150 statute miles (240km) east of the center. Arlene crossed the western tip of Cuba on the morning of June 10 with 50mph (85km/h) winds. Tropical Storm Arlene had an unusual structure throughout its life, with a large circulation containing numerous small centers rotating about a larger gyre, as opposed to an inner convective core.|$|E

25|$|The Sri Lankan team {{on their}} way back home from Australia visited Dhaka in March 1985. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> short tour; there was just one three-day fixture, played under searing March heat.

25|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> popular piece however {{during the}} Third Reich, {{generally}} {{with a number}} of significant amendments to tailor it to contemporary circumstances.

25|$|When I grew {{up there}} weren't many other guitarists... There was one other guitarist {{in my school}} who {{actually}} showed me the first chords that I learned and I went on from there.

25|$|Early in 1925 Joyce {{returned}} with his 9 thoroughbreds to the United States on the SS California from an extended engagement in London. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> rough passage.

The game was played in front of 11,134 fans, lasting 4 hours 15 minutes into double overtime, with Oshawa winning 5–4. Kitchener then played Laval in the semi-finals. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> close game throughout, with Kitchener pulling out a 5–4 victory.|$|E

25|$|While D'Alema was Prime Minister, Italy {{took part}} in the NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1999. The attack was {{supported}} by Silvio Berlusconi and the centre-right opposition, but the far left strongly contested it. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> important test about the government loyalty to NATO and the country's foreign policy, as it concerned the first post-communist leader of Italy and the first military action formally outside a UN mandate.|$|E

25|$|The SM {{was sold}} with a small, {{lightweight}} engine in various forms, designed from scratch by Giulio Alfieri but {{capable of being}} assembled on existing V8 tooling. Because of this, the engine sported an unusual 90° angle between cylinder banks — a trait shared with the later PRV V6. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> compact and innovative design that allowed the use of just one pattern for the cylinder heads and an intermediate shaft extended out to drive the auxiliaries.|$|E
25|$|In the Giants {{first home}} playoff game since 1962, {{despite the fact}} that the 49ers {{recorded}} 362 yards of total offense, with receiver Dwight Clark catching eight passes for 120 yards, the Giants defense limited San Francisco to only one field goal the entire game. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> satisfying win for New York, who had lost their last five games played against the 49ers, including playoff losses in 1981 and 1984.|$|E
