40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to develop sustained-release matrix tablets of metoprolol succinate, β 1 -selective adrenergic receptor blocking agent. The tablets were prepared by the wet granulation method. Ethanolic solutions of ethylcellulose (EC) and polyvinylpyrrolidone were used as granulating agents along with hydrophilic matrix materials like hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) and guar gum. The granules were evaluated for angle of repose, bulk density, compressibility index, total porosity, and drug content. The tablets were subjected to weight variation test, drug content, hardness, friability, and in vitro release studies. The granules showed satisfactory flow properties, compressibility, and drug content. All the tablet formulations showed acceptable pharmacotechnical properties. The results of dissolution studies indicated that formulation F 1 (drug-to-HPMC, 1 : 4; ethanol as <b>granulating</b> <b>agent)</b> could extend the drug release up to 12 hours. In the further formulation development process, F 5 (drug-to-HPMC, 1 : 4; EC 4 % wt/vol as <b>granulating</b> <b>agent),</b> the most successful formulation of the study, exhibited satisfactory drug release.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the feasibility of using Eudragit E as a <b>granulating</b> <b>agent</b> for a spray-dried extract fromPhyllanthus niruri to obtain tablets containing a high dose of this product. The granules were developed by wet granulation and contained 2. 5 %, 5. 0 %, and 10. 0 % Eudragit E in the final product concentration. The tablets were produced on a single-punch tablet press by direct compression of granules using 0. 5 % magnesium stearate as a lubricant. The tablets were elaborated following a 2 × 3 factorial design, where Eudragit E concentration and compression force were the in-dependent variables, and tensile strength and the extract release of the tablets were the dependent variables. All granules showed better technological properties than the spray-dried extract, including less moisture sorption. The characteristics of the granules were directly dependent on the proportion of Eudragit E in the formulation. In general, all tablets showed high mechanical resistance with less than 1 % friability, less moisture sorption, and a slower extract release profile. The Eudragit E concentration and compression force of the tablets significantly influenced both dependent variables studied. In conclusion, Eudragit E was efficient as a <b>granulating</b> <b>agent</b> for the spray-dried extract, but additional studies are needed to further optimize the formuations in order to achieve less water sorption and improve the release of the extract from the tablets...|$|E

40|$|The {{oral route}} of drug {{administration}} is most extensively used {{due to the}} obvious ease of administration. Verapamil hydrochloride is a WHO listed phenylalkylarnine, L-type calcium channel antagonist that is mainly indicated for cardiovascular disorders such as angina pectoris, supraventricular tachycardia and hypertension. Due to its relatively short half-life of approximately 4. 0 hours, the formulation of a sustained-release dosage form is useful to improve patient compliance and to achieve predictable and optimized therapeutic plasma concentrations. Direct compression and wet granulation were initially used as methods for tablet manufacture. The direct compression method of manufacture produced tablets that exhibited formulation and manufacturing difficulties. Mini-tablets containing veraparnil hydrochloride were then prepared by wet granulation using Surelease® E- 7 - 19010. and Eudragit® NE 30 D as the <b>granulating</b> <b>agents</b> after which the granules were incorporated with an hydrophilic matrix material, Carbopol® 974 P NF. Granule and powder blends were evaluated using the angle of repose, loose and tapped bulk density, Can's compressibility index, Hausner's ratio and drug content. Granules with good flow properties and satisfactory compressibility were used for further studies. Tablets were subjected to thickness, diameter and weight variation tests, crushing strength, tensile strength, friability and content uniformity studies. Tablets that showed acceptable pharmaco-technical properties were selected for further analysis. Drug content uniformity and dissolution release rates were determined using a validated isocratic HPLC method. Initially, USP apparatus 1 and 3 dissolution apparatus {{were used to determine}} in-vitro drug release rates from the formulations over a 22 -hour period. USP apparatus 3 was finally selected as it offers the advantages of mimicking, in part, the changes in the physicochemical environment experienced by products in the gastro-intestinal tract. Differences in release rates between the test formulations and a commercially available product, Isoptin® SR were observed at different pH's using USP apparatus 1. The release of veraparnil hydrochloride from matrix tablets was pH dependent and was markedly reduced at higher pH values. This may be due, in part, to the poor solubility of veraparnil hydrochloride at these pH values and also the possible interaction of verapamil hydrochloride with anionic polymers used in these formulations. Swelling and erosion behaviour of the tablets were evaluated and differences in behaviour were observed which may be attributed to the physico-chemical characteristics of the polymers used in this study. In-vitro dissolution profiles were characterized by the difference (j 1) and similarity factor (j 2) and also by a new similarity factor, Sct. In addition, the mechanism of drug release from these dosage forms was mainly evaluated using the Korsmeyer-Peppas model and the kinetics of drug release assessed using other models, including Zero order, First order, Higuchi, HixsonCrowell, Weibull and the Baker-Lonsdale model. Dissolution kinetics were best described by application of the Weibull model, and the Korsmeyer-Peppas model. The release exponent, n, confirmed that drug release from these dosage forms was due to the mixed effects of diffusion and swelling and therefore, anomalous release kinetics are predominant. In conclusion, two test batches were found to be comparable to the reference product Isoptin® SR with respect to their in-vitro release profiles...|$|R

One of the possible approach to overcome these drawbacks is to represent them in unit dosage form i. e. tablet dosage form. The {{purpose of this study is}} to elucidate and quantify the compressibility and compactibility of herbal granules prepared by using hydrogel isolated from whole seeds of Ocimum basilicum as a novel binder. The compressibility is the ability of the powder to deform under pressure and the compactibility is the ability of a powder to form coherent compacts. To test the functionality of novel excipients, Sonnergaard proved a simple linear model to confirm compactability, which is an uncomplicated tool for quantification. The tablets were compressed at increasing compression pressures and were evaluated for various mechanical properties. The linear relationship between specific crushing strength and compression pressure revealed the compactibility of the herbal granules and the linear relationship between porosity and logarithm of compression pressure revealed the compressible nature of the herbal granules according to the model developed by Sonnergaard.

Binder selection for particular system is quite often empirical and dependent on the skills and experience of the formulator. Hand squeeze test was and still the main way for determination of wet granulation end point. It depends mainly on operator experience, {{so it is not}} possible to be validated. Literature reveals a variety of advanced monitoring techniques following up different stages of wet massing. Torque measurement has been proved to be the most reliable control method as its tight relation to mass resistance. The first objective of this work was to investigate and optimize the influence of different variables on Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose binder solutions used as <b>granulating</b> <b>agents</b> during wet massing techniques prior to granulation step. Variables examined were the effect of polymer concentration, viscosity, addition of surfactant (Tween 80), addition of plasticizer (PEG 600), binder solution pH, and polymer grade. Mixing torque rheometer (MTR) was efficient in tracing and follow up of the interaction between liquid binder and the solid substrate providing us with the mean line torque of the wet mass and the optimum binder ratio required. The type of solid substrate (microcrystalline cellulose; Avicel PH- 101) was kept constant while variation in the liquid binder grade and/or characteristics was tested. Full factorial design was used to study the possibility of combining more than one variable simultaneously on the same binder solution. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for testing the significance of results. It was found that all HPMC concentrations were able to produce a mean line torque higher than that of the blank test. Increasing polymer molecular weight, concentration and/or viscosity caused increase in torque value of wet mass. The results showed the enhanced effect of plasticizer and surfactant on the spreading and diffusion of liquid binder inside solid substrate particles. The maximum torque amplitude of the wet mass was achieved using solution pH of about 7. 5 and addition of 2. 0 %v/v of surfactant. The second objective of this work was to investigate and optimize the influence of different variables the torque profile of Carbopol and Polyvinylpyrrolidone. Variables examined were the effect of polymer concentration, viscosity, addition of surfactant (Tween 80), addition of plasticizer (PEG 600), binder solution pH, and polymer grade. It has been found that the maximum torque of the wet mass was achieved with Carbopol and Polyvinylpyrrolidone when adding 4. 2 and 1. 0 % v/v of plasticizer as well as 3. 5 and 4. 5 % v/v of surfactant, respectively. The third objective of the current study was to study the effect of variations in the solid substrate particle size and composition on the rheological behavior of wet massing. This was done using three different liquid binders (Carbopol, Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and Polyvinylpyrrolidone). Extrusion-spheronization was based upon the rheological data followed be evaluation of the produced pellets. A mixer torque rheometer (MTR) methodology was used for selecting the optimum binder volume which is suitable for wet massing and consequently for extrusion-spheronization. Different methods for pellets evaluation and assessing of quality were used such as scanning electron microscopy. Theophylline as a model drug was used for the current study. Statistical analysis was performed using one way ANOVA from which differences between formulations were considered to be significant at p ≤ 0. 05. The results indicated that addition of any of the used co-excipient caused marked decrease in the maximum torque value below that of MCC alone. The influence of particle size on the dissolution behavior was of low effect while the type of the binder solution was more pronounced. Last but not least the final objective of the current study was to figure out the influence of MTR instrumental variables on the pellets quality and performance. The current study also compared between hand-made granules and pellets using wet granulation. In addition a formula composed of Avicel PH- 101 and dibasic calcium phosphate (90 : 10 % w/w) was selected for studying the ability to scale up and possibility of transfer form MTR to larger mixer types. It has been shown that. The hand-made granules showed the faster drug release within 20 minutes which may be related to their non compacted nature and higher porosity. The maximum torque was directly proportional to the mixing speed (rpm) value of MTR rotating blades. Pellets made of binder solution volume constituting the maximum torque position were of high quality. It has been shown that increasing binder volume led to decreasing friability of pellets and hand-made granules. Results showed that increasing binder volume during wet massing led to decreased pellets particle size and decreased friability. The decreased flowability of hand-made granules may be attributed to the scaly nature of their morphology which might increase the friction to each other. Scaling up from 30 gm to 500 and 1000 gm was highly successful confirming suitability of MTR as a preformulation tool...|$|R
