This thematic reorientation took place on two fronts. The first one is the global transnational democracy, which includes the impacts of the economic globalization on national democracies, as well the proposal for a political Constitution for a pluralistic world society, based on a constitutionalization of international law. The second one is the European transnational democracy, which includes the redefinition of the political profile of European welfare state for an economic liberal profile, as well the paradox of democratic technocracy operated by European institutions and the proposal to overcome the decoupled technocratic policy model. This paper will address only this last topic, describing the reasons of the democratic deficit and the consequent delay of <b>European</b> <b>political</b> <b>Union.</b> Despite numerous reforms, the technocratic policies have not eliminated the discrepancy between centralization and democratization, and mistakenly indicate another direction further reinforcing the problem of European undemocratic institutions. In contrast, Habermas argues that the democratic deficit could only be overcome replacing the technocratic approach by a deeper democratization of European institutions. <br /...|$|E

40|$|EU {{founding}} states {{aimed the}} establishment of an economic and political organism. Economic and political nature of this sui generis organization {{goes hand in hand with}} common principles of law. Economic cooperation brought common markets and elimination of borders and this followed with added cross-border criminality. The international criminality requires international measures, but due to the different national legislations, there is a necessity to harmonize them. European Union expectations go beyond simply harmonizing the law. There is a purpose towards the unification of law and the creation of a common criminal law like a European Criminal Code. The Lisbon Treaty creates a favorable ground for such a thing. This paper aims to make a brief analysis of this issue by addressing the Lisbon Treaty and the innovations he brought in the context of unification of criminal law and the conditions and obstacles that this process has. The questions raised are: Does the Lisbon Treaty provide the necessary tools for further harmonization of the law? Is it possible to have a European Criminal Code and a European Criminal Procedural Code? Is it necessary that in applying criminal law, there should be a <b>European</b> <b>political</b> <b>union</b> at a higher level, like a Confederation...|$|E

40|$|Émeric Crucé’s Nouveau Cynée (1623) was the {{earliest}} work {{to call for}} both universal peace and global free trade. Anonymously published, the work endorsed a pacifistic international body that would replace war with diplomatic state cooperation. Crucé claimed that by eschewing belligerent aggrandisement people could not only live in peaceful co-existence, regardless of geography or religion, great material prosperity would also be engendered. But this notion of an end to war within a seventeenth century context of frequent conflict meant the work was largely ignored by contemporaries, who favoured the international law of jurists such as Grotius. As a consequence the Nouveau Cynée was largely forgotten. Instead, the abbé de Saint-Pierre’s Projet pour rendre la paix perpétuelle (1712) came to be acclaimed as the first plan to value the correlation between non-violent cooperative states and commercial prosperity. Building on the Duke of Sully’s call in the Grand Dessein (1638) for a European senate, Saint-Pierre envisaged a <b>European</b> <b>political</b> <b>union</b> enriched by trade. Yet these proposals were restricted to Christendom, thereby lacking the breadth and purpose of Crucé’s world vision. While the Nouveau Cynée’s contribution has been noted in international relations and economics, it has largely been neglected by historians of political thought. Through an interdisciplinary approach this article will discuss {{the significance of the}} Nouveau Cynée’s early advocacy of global peace and free trade to political thought, as well as its influence on Sully and Saint-Pierre...|$|E

The former comprised distinct but related talks on monetary union and political union, while the latter was a united negotiation. Discussion in 1985 fell within a single Presidency, that of Luxembourg; negotiations took place between October and November and agreement was reached on 2 - 3 December. In contrast, the 1990 - 91 intergovernmental conference (IGC) lasted 12 months and spanned three Presidencies: Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands (in essence the latter two only). Furthermore, whereas the 1985 IGC was based on a Commission text, during 1990 - 91 the Commission proposal did not form the basis of political union discussions, although it did on monetary union. The political union debates were rather based on Member States’ texts, advanced individually or via alliances, supplemented with Presidency documents. The broader subject matter of the 1990 - 91 IGC combined with the longer negotiating process meant there were different degrees of involvement by the Member States and institutional actors (Commission and European Parliament) during each conference...|$|E
40|$|More {{than fifty}} years after the Schuman Declaration, Europe is still far from a real <b>Political</b> <b>Union.</b> Europe faces an {{important}} imbalance {{between the two sides}} of the integration process, appearing as an important actor in the international economic scenario, but as a minor actor in the international political arena. In this paper, we start by arguing that the “small steps” strategy that led the European Union (EU) until the present situation is no longer sufficient to let the Union efficiently overcome its present deficits and challenges. So, we call for an important change in the institutional and economic organisation of the EU, towards a model of largely decentralised federalism. Examining the present challenges for the EU and the characteristics of the Draft Constitution/Constitutional Treaty for Europe, and comparing the main existent federal systems, we argue that the new “Constitution” is not enough to give the EU a strong voice both in the political and the economic areas. In this context, we discuss the design of an adequate institutional framework for the political organisation of the EU, presenting an alternative proposal based on the characteristics of a truly federal system, also as its consequences in what concerns the design and implementation of European economic policies. <b>European</b> <b>Union,</b> <b>Political</b> <b>Union,</b> Federalism, Fiscal Federalism, European Constitution...|$|R

Today, the political and economic institutions and structures that emerged from the process of European integration confront the challenges posed by the recent Eurozone crisis. Europe’s survival demonstrates resilience but does not evidence a transformation in the politically contested nature of <b>European</b> economic and <b>political</b> <b>union.</b> This thesis asks why the thick regulatory framework and rules-based nature of the Eurozone produced a suboptimal currency union. To answer this question, this thesis draws on the two major theories of political economy, liberalism and socialism. An analysis of these theories yields {{a better understanding of how}} the political and economic factors plaguing the Eurozone interrelate. The absence of a state to accompany the Eurozone creates a fundamental structural shortcoming responsible for the poor economic and political performance of the currency union. However, both liberal and socialist critiques fall short in offering viable solutions to ameliorate the persisting challenges plaguing the Eurozone. The employment of the two major theories of political economy to interpret the threats facing the currency union reveals the utopian ideals and political tasks accompanying liberal and socialist critiques. Understanding the political and economic elements of the Eurozone crisis and how both theories grapple with the challenges they present will prepare scholars of <b>European</b> <b>political</b> economy to offer appropriate solutions to strengthen the political support for the currency union...|$|R

In the third section, I describe the development of European citizenship {{leading up to the}} Maastricht Agreement.
