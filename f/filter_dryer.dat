40|$|An {{intermittent}} noise that occurs around 30 seconds after compressor start-up has been disturbing customers of many domestic refrigerator manufacturers {{over the past}} 10 years. This noise {{is very similar to}} that produced by popcorn popping, being referred to as popping noise. The most probable cause of this strange and unpleasant noise is thought to be CIS (Condensation Induced Shock). The aim of this study was firstly to check the possible occurrence of CIS in a specific household refrigerator and, secondly, to identify ways to avert it without affecting the product performance. To this end some changes were made to the refrigerator: i) the diameter of the <b>filter</b> <b>dryer</b> was altered; ii) the slope of the <b>filter</b> <b>dryer</b> was altered; iii) the compressor mass flow rate was changed and iv) an additional internal heat exchanger was installed. The replacement of the <b>filter</b> <b>dryer</b> made the sound even more unpleasant, while the replacement of the original compressor by another of smaller capacity considerably reduced the noise. The noise was effectively eliminated only by placing the <b>filter</b> <b>dryer</b> horizontally or by installing an additional internal heat exchanger.

40|$|The present work shows a way {{to develop}} an {{industrial}} organic solvent-free process for lithium-ion battery electrodes manufacturing. The process uses a water-based slurry to cast the electrodes, using poly vinylidene-fluoride (PVDF) as a polymeric binder. The use of aqueous PVDF latex as a binder in positive electrodes is of difficult integration in existing production lines due to the low stability of lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO 2) in an aqueous environment. The use of electroless plating solves this issue by coating LiCoO 2 particles with a copper-based layer stable to water. The presence of copper {{on the surface of}} the powders is confirmed by means of SEM, XRF and conductivity measurements of the powders. Electrochemical characterization of the electrodes has been carried out with cycling tests in coin cells, confirming the cycling stability during charge/discharge cycles. Cycling performances of the water-based cathodes containing coated active material particles are comparable to a reference NMP-based cathode, while uncoated particles show a sensibly lower capacity retention during cycling.

40|$|The drying of {{pharmaceutical}} powders following their isolation via crystallization and filtration is examined using a laboratory-scale agitated <b>filter</b> <b>dryer</b> (AFD). Vacuum contact and through-circulation convective drying {{with and without}} agitation of aspirin powders with pure and mixed solvents are studied through an integrated experimental and modelling approach. Experiments were carried out under different operating conditions by using aspirin particles and water/water-ethanol as typical solid-solvent systems. Two approaches were used to study the drying behaviour of aspirin: 100 µL small-scale drying using thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and 5 L medium-scale drying in a laboratory AFD. While the TGA tests provided {{a better understanding of}} drying kinetics as functions of temperature, vacuum level, solvent type and particle size, the AFD study revealed the effects of industry-relevant operating parameters (such as the heating rate, vacuum level, agitation speed and regime, gas flow rate, and initial solvent content) on the drying of aspirin particles. In the TGA experiments, the constant and falling rate periods are observed for drying with pure water, while only the falling rate period is observed for pure ethanol and water-ethanol mixed solvents. In the laboratory-scale AFD experiments, drying cycle time is found to decrease with increasing agitation speed, vacuum level, heating power supplied and gas flow. The critical solvent content is determined by identifying the transition point on the temperature-time and the torque-time plots during the drying process. Particle size distribution and morphology analysis of aspirin particles before and after drying with agitation indicate that the particles tend to agglomeration at lower stirring speeds while they are prone to attrition at higher speeds. An increase of the circularity of the particles with the increase of the agitation speed is observed due to attrition effect. Drying models based on a lumped-parameter (LPM) approach are developed for the static and agitated bed vacuum contact drying and combined LMP and distributed-parameter model (DPM) for the convective drying. Within this modelling approach, only one parameter that is the critical solvent content needs to be estimated from experimental results compared to other LPMs which greatly reduced the degree of parameter estimation. These computationally expedient models can be used for the prediction of drying time in a fast and reliable way. The model equations are implemented in gPROMS software and the models are applied to simulate the experiments carried out in the 5 L AFD. The vacuum contact drying experiments were also simulated using a DPM embedded in the gPROMS software. The modelling results of LPM were compared with that obtained using the DPM. Overall, a good agreement between the calculated and measured drying curves is obtained and the measured drying times are well predicted at varied drying conditions. This research presented the following improvements over the current studies on powder bed drying with limited research on organic crystalline materials and mixed solvent: holistic studies on drying behaviour with varied external drying conditions as well as internal material properties using different scale apparatus: TGA and AFD. Over the previous LPMs on powder bed drying, the modelling approach presented the following improvements: the models developed in this work need less parameter estimation. Three consistent approaches to measure the required parameter at the laboratory scale have been described in this work. The models provide a potential for industrial application on AFD drying...|$|E

40|$|Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) fluxes {{measured}} using the eddy-covariance method capture the {{spatial and temporal}} heterogeneity of N 2 O emissions. Most closed-path trace-gas analyzers for eddy-covariance measurements have large-volume, multi-pass absorption cells that necessitate high flow rates for ample frequency response, thus requiring high-power sample pumps. Other sampling system components, including rain caps, <b>filters,</b> <b>dryers,</b> and tubing can also degrade system frequency response. This field trial tested {{the performance of a}} closed-path eddy-covariance system for N 2 O flux measurements with improvements to use less power while maintaining the frequency response. The new system consists of a thermoelectrically cooled tunable diode laser absorption spectrometer configured to measure both N 2 O and carbon dioxide (CO 2). The system features a relatively small, single- pass sample cell (200  ml) that provides good frequency response with a lower-powered pump (~  250  W). A new filterless intake removes particulates from the sample air stream with no additional mixing volume that could degrade frequency response. A single-tube dryer removes water vapor from the sample to avoid the need for density or spectroscopic corrections, while maintaining frequency response. This eddy-covariance system was collocated with a previous tunable diode laser absorption spectrometer model to compare N 2 O and CO 2 flux measurements for two full growing seasons (May 2015 to October 2016) in a fertilized cornfield in Southern Ontario, Canada. Both spectrometers were placed outdoors {{at the base of the}} sampling tower demonstrating ruggedness for a range of environmental conditions (minimum to maximum daily temperature range: − 26. 1 to 31. 6  °C). The new system rarely required maintenance. An in situ frequency response test demonstrated that the cutoff frequency of the new system was better than the old system (3. 5  Hz compared to 2. 30  Hz), and similar to that of a closed-path CO 2 eddy- covariance system (4. 05  Hz) using shorter tubing and no dryer that was also collocated at the site. Values of the N 2 O fluxes were similar between the two spectrometer systems (slope = 1. 01, r 2  =  0. 96); CO 2 fluxes as measured by the short-tubed eddy-covariance system and the two spectrometer systems correlated well (slope =  1. 03, r 2  =  0. 998).

The method employs dual wall drill rods. The inner tubes provide a continuous pathway for the chips and cores from the drill bit face to the surface. To modify air reverse circulation drilling technology according to the conditions of a specific glacier, original cutter drill bits and air processing devices (air-cooled aftercoolers, air receivers, coalescing <b>filters,</b> desiccant <b>dryers)</b> should be used. The airflow velocity for conveying a 60 -mm diameter and 200 -mm long ice core should not be lower than 22. 5 m/s, and the minimal airflow rate for continual chip and cores transport is 6. 8 m 3 /min at 2. 3 – 2. 6 MPa.

40|$|Vertical axis mixers, such as {{high shear}} granulators and {{agitated}} <b>filter</b> <b>dryers</b> (AFDs), are commonly used in the processing of particulate materials. For example, AFDs are regularly used in the pharmaceutical industry to dry the wet active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) particles. During the drying process, an impeller blade agitates the bed to increase the drying rate and enhance drying uniformity. Unfortunately, the needle-shaped API particles tend to flow poorly, are frequently damaged, and can sometimes form undesirable agglomerates, causing manufacturing inefficiencies, flow stoppages, and unpredictable product quality. Therefore, {{it is important to}} gain an improved understanding of the system 2 ̆ 7 s particle behavior to aid in the design and optimization of unit operations. Previous work in vertical axis mixers, especially prior computational work, has assumed spherical particles. This thesis focuses on modeling and analysis of dynamics and stresses of elongated particles processed in vertical axis mixers. Elongated particles are of particular interest in the operation of pharmaceutical AFDs since the particles processed in such devices are often needle-shaped. ^ A discrete element method (DEM) model is used to examine the velocity, solid fraction, and particle orientation fields of non-cohesive, sphero-cylindrical particles agitated in a vertical axis mixer for a range of particle aspect ratios and bed depths. The model is validated against experimental measurements of the rotating shaft torque and bed surface velocity field. The particle trajectories within the bed are similar to those that have been reported previously for spheres, with a vortex circulating in the direction opposite of the blade rotation on horizontal planes of the bed. Increasing the particle aspect ratio generally decreases the particle velocities relative to the blade, implying reduced mixing. The solid fraction is largest just upstream of the blades and toward the base of the container. The former finding is different than what has been observed for spheres, but the latter is consistent with prior observations. The smallest solid fractions are located in the wake region and at the bed 2 ̆ 7 s free surface, which is similar to the patterns for spheres. In general, larger particle aspect ratios decrease the overall bed solid fraction as well as the solid fraction uniformity. Particles with an aspect ratio larger than one have major axes that are offset between 10 – 20 degrees from the flow streamlines. The degree of alignment between particles increases near boundary regions. In addition to the strong correlation between the particle principal orientation and velocity vectors, regions of larger velocity gradient magnitude result in smaller solid fractions and smaller degrees of three-dimensional alignment between particles. ^ In addition, the DEM model is used to predict the internal load and moment distribution within sphero-cylindrical particles in a low-speed, vertical axis mixer. The internal loads and moments are combined with small deformation beam bending theory to determine the internal stress distributions. Parametric studies using the model examined the influence of particle aspect ratio, blade rotational speed, and material properties. The spatial distributions of loads and moments, averaged over all particles and time steps, are symmetric about the particle center-plane with a maximum at the particle center-plane. In addition, the largest average maximum principal stress or Mises stress is observed to occur along the particle circumference at the center-plane of the particle. These results indicate that particle failure is not only most likely to occur at the center-plane of the particle, but the failure will occur at the particle 2 ̆ 7 s circumference. The largest average values of loads and moments increase with particle aspect ratio. The largest average maximum principal stress and Mises stress both increase with increasing particle aspect ratio. The trend of largest average maximum principal stress or Mises stress appears to have a positive curvature, which follows the trend of largest average bending moment most closely. The frequency distributions of maximum principal stress at high stress range can be fit to a Weibull distribution. Increasing blade speed, bed height and particle-particle friction coefficient generally leads to an increase in internal loads, moments and stresses, i. e. more particle breakage. ...|$|R

The design of packed beds requires a detailed knowledge of local dynamics of flow, composition and temperature. Unfortunately, investigations {{for the development}} of 3 D modelling codes by computational fluid dynamics are still not sufficiently mature compared with those relying on 2 D modelling or simplified pseudo-homogenous models. This project investigates non-uniform catalyst deactivation in packed bed reactors of low aspect ratios under steady-state and dynamic operations. Low aspect ratio packed beds were selected as they are known to generate non-uniform distribution of local flow. Detailed knowledge of flow dynamics in terms of local structure of the packed bed, pressure drops, interstitial flow, heat and mass rate distributions was examined. The discrete element method was used to generate various packing configurations and the results of profiles of porosity were in a good agreement with the semi-analytical models, especially, {{in the vicinity of the}} wall. Similar oscillation trends with damping profiles towards the centre of the packed beds were observed. Flow heterogeneity was assessed by tests of mass transfer dispersion through a Lagrangian approach. Interactions of fluid flow, mass and heat transfers, and local deactivation of alumina catalyst Al 2 O 3 of CO oxidation were investigated under design and operating conditions. An increase in the activation energy of deactivation promoted the deactivation by accelerating the reaction rate and releasing additional thermal energy, which in turn accelerated the deactivation. The 3 D modelling allowed observation of local catalyst deactivation at packing pore level which is typically not accessible by the 2 D modelling or pseudo-homogeneous models. In addition, the deactivation was quite asymmetrical along axial and radial directions, leading to uneven rates of thermal expansion and contraction and causing local deactivation associated with temperature runaways...|$|R
50|$|Purified Air is {{supplied}} {{in the gap}} between the water surface and the top of the Super-Kamiokande tank. The air purification system contains three compressors, a buffer tank, <b>dryers,</b> <b>filters,</b> and activated charcoal filters. A total of 8 m3 of activated charcoal is used. The last 50 L of charcoal is cooled to −40 °C to increase removal efficiency for radon. Typical flow rates, dew point, and residual radon concentration are 18 m3/h, −65 °C (@+1 kg/cm2), and a few mBq m−3, respectively. Typical radon concentration in the dome air is measured to be 40 Bq m−3. Radon levels in the mine tunnel air, near the tank cavity dome, typically reach 2000-3000 Bq m−3 during the warm season, from May until October, while from November to April the radon level is approximately 100-300 Bq m−3. This variation is due to the chimney effect in the ventilation pattern of the mine tunnel system; in cold seasons, fresh air flows into the Atotsu tunnel entrance that is a relatively short path through exposed rock before reaching the experimental area, while in the summer, air flows out the tunnel, drawing radon-rich air from deep within the mine past the experimental area.In order to keep radon levels in the dome area and water purification system below 100 Bq m−3, fresh air is continually pumped at approximately 10 m3/min from outside the mine which generates a slight over-pressure in the Super-Kamiokande experimental area to minimize the entry of ambient mine air. A “Radon Hut” (Rn Hut) was constructed near the Atotsu tunnel entrance to house equipment for the dome air system: a 40 hp air pump with 10 m^3 min−1 /15 PSI pump capacity, air dehumidifier, carbon filter tanks, and control electronics. In autumn 1997, an extended intake air pipe was installed at a location approximately 25 m above the Atotsu tunnel entrance. This low level satisfies that goals of air quality so that carbon filter regeneration operations would no longer be required.|$|R
