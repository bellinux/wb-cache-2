50|$|The DWV built 120,000 Class A2 {{goods wagons}} from 1910 to 1927. These flat-roofed wagons were {{produced}} {{with and without}} hand brakes and in two variants of <b>loading</b> <b>door</b> and ventilation flap. One had a <b>loading</b> <b>door</b> and ventilation flap on each side; the other variant had two <b>loading</b> <b>doors</b> and two ventilation flaps per side. Later, most of the four-door variants were converted to two-door wagons as the extra doors were deemed superfluous. Vans with two ventilators were mainly used for transporting fruit and vegetables. The new raised brakeman's cab was given a gabled roof with a pointed ridge and handrails {{were added to the}} outside of the steps.|$|R

50|$|The East Lane {{elevation}} {{has similar}} parapet detailing, but the rendered facade details finish {{at the edge}} of the splayed corner entrance. This elevation is finished in painted brickwork, and the ground floor has a single opening with timber louvres and fixed glazing, with evidence of brick infill of an earlier <b>loading</b> <b>door</b> below. A brick infilled arched doorway is located adjacent. The first floor has a <b>loading</b> <b>door,</b> consisting of a roller door to the lower section surmounted by timber louvres, and a smaller louvred glass window is located adjacent.|$|R
50|$|On the Events Level, {{there are}} five truck docks with 8 ft x 10 ft <b>loading</b> <b>doors,</b> one 8 ft x 10 ft {{drive-in}} door, and one 20 ft x 24 ft drive-in <b>loading</b> <b>door,</b> allowing large shows to load and unload eight trucks simultaneously. Trucks can load and unload unobstructed, directly into the marshalling area at the arena floor's west end. Backstage are three star dressing rooms, two promoter offices (located in the marshalling area), and seven team dressing rooms, {{as well as a}} dressing room for officials.|$|R
5000|$|A {{belt course}} connects the window lintels. These are the building's only {{decoration}} besides [...] "Port Business Center" [...] painted in large black letters on a yellow background {{just below the}} eastern roofline. The bricks rise several feet above the roofline to form a parapet capped with terra cotta barrel tiles. At the southwest corner the roof is pierced by the elevator's motor housing, and a small chimney rises from the northeast.In the fourth bay west from Broadway along the north side is the building's main business entrance. A small set of steps leads up to a heavy wooden door with transom. A similar secondary entrance is in the fourth bay from the east facde, just west of a large <b>loading</b> <b>door</b> {{similar to that in}} the middle of the east facade. Along the south is a large metal canopy, and another <b>loading</b> <b>door</b> is in the center. The west of the building has <b>loading</b> <b>doors</b> on the first and second floors.|$|R

50|$|The {{building}} has housed {{collections of the}} Maritime Archaeological Association of Far North Queensland since 1988. A <b>loading</b> <b>door</b> {{is present in the}} front end of the building, and was reportedly added after 1988 so that large maritime artefacts could be easily moved into the structure.|$|R
50|$|Eight bomber {{variants}} (BT-32) {{were built}} with manually operated machine gun turrets {{in the nose}} and above the rear fuselage. All these aircraft were exported. A military cargo version (CT-32) was also built for Argentina. It had a large <b>loading</b> <b>door</b> on the starboard side of the fuselage.|$|R
50|$|Like the 1934 Citroën Traction Avant, the H had {{a unitary}} body with no {{separate}} frame, four-wheel independent suspension, and front-wheel drive. For a commercial van, this combination provided unique benefits - a flat floor {{very close to}} the ground, and 6 feet cm standing height, with a side <b>loading</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Blackburn B-107A : Projected Stage 3 {{development}} of the B-101 Beverley designed in 1959. The B-107A {{was similar to the}} B-107 but included main <b>loading</b> <b>doors</b> in the nose and rear doors for para-dropping only, as well as a relocated flight deck. Like the B-107, this project never progressed beyond the planning stage.|$|R
25|$|Built {{as a car}} ferry, Caledonian Princess was a roll-on/roll-off design, with {{a single}} vehicle door in the stern. The vehicle deck had space for 103 cars. To {{facilitate}} the turning of trucks for disembarking, a turntable {{was included in the}} deck. In 1969, she had side <b>loading</b> <b>doors</b> cut into her vehicle deck.|$|R
50|$|In Australia, brake vans (or guard's vans; both {{terms were}} in common use) were often {{also used for}} {{carrying}} parcels and light freight, and usually had large compartments and <b>loading</b> <b>doors</b> for such items. Some of the larger vans also included a compartment for passengers travelling on goods services or drovers travelling with their livestock.|$|R
50|$|The Valetta was a {{military}} transport development of the Viking civil airliner. The 58th Viking (c/n 158) became the prototype Valetta, which was first flown from Brooklands by test pilot Mutt Summers on 30 June 1947. The Valetta differed from the Viking fundamentally in being fitted with more powerful engines, a strengthened floor and large <b>loading</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|R
40|$|Report {{presents}} the results of an investigation made to determine the influence of various factors on the take-off performance of a hypothetical large flying boat by means of take-off calculations. The factors varied in the calculations were size of <b>hull</b> (<b>load</b> coefficient), wing setting, trim, deflection of flap, wing loading, aspect ratio, and parasite drag. The take-off times and distances were calculated to the stalling speeds and the performance above these speeds was separately studied to determine piloting technique for optimum take-off...|$|R

50|$|By 1913 over 300 touring {{companies}} had appeared on its stage, and the Woodland Opera House was becoming an entertainment {{center for the}} region. However, a lawsuit originating from 1912 when an event attendee mistook a <b>loading</b> <b>door</b> for an exit and fell three feet breaking their arm mixed with declining ticket sales due {{to the rise of}} the motion picture closed the theater down in 1913.|$|R
50|$|Early {{examples}} {{with just}} one or two wagons together were pulled downhill by the horse, the horse also acting as brakes. Later trains developed better mechanical brakes and so several wagons could be coupled together as a single train. The resting horse was carried in a separate wagon or 'dandy car'. These wagons were simple unpowered wagons, with no more adaption for horses than their <b>loading</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Tupolev Tu-107 was a {{prototype}} Soviet military transport aircraft {{developed from the}} Tupolev Tu-104. It featured a rear ramp <b>loading</b> <b>door</b> and was intended to carry light vehicles, artillery pieces, or up to 70 paratroopers. The fuselage was unpressurized, which meant that passengers would have to use oxygen masks. A single prototype was built and flown, but the aircraft was not put in production.|$|R
50|$|The lower storey of {{the rear}} facade has a central set of large <b>loading</b> <b>doors.</b> Above this are three symmetrically placed double-hung sash windows with brick sills and low arches to their heads. This facade has two {{rainwater}} heads and associated downpipes, {{the one in the}} southern-most corner appearing to be set into the wall. The facade to the north-west has only three, small windows in it.|$|R
5000|$|Ship {{classification}} societies such as Det Norske Veritas, American Bureau of Shipping, and Lloyd's Register indian {{register of shipping}} have established standard calculation forms for <b>hull</b> <b>loads,</b> strength requirements, the thickness of hull plating and reinforcing stiffeners, girders, and other structures.These methods often give a quick and dirty way to estimate strength requirements for any given ship.Almost always those methods will give conservative, or stronger than precisely required, strength values.However, they provide a detailed starting point for analyzing a given ship's structure and whether it meetsindustry common standards or not.

25|$|It was {{considered}} to be sturdy and very manoeuvrable for a glider. The design of the Horsa adopted a high-wing cantilever monoplane configuration, being equipped with wooden wings and a wooden semi-monocoque fuselage. The fuselage was built in three sections bolted together, the front section held the pilot's compartment and main freight <b>loading</b> <b>door,</b> the middle section was accommodation for troops or freight, the rear section supported the tail unit.|$|R
50|$|The Connect, {{when first}} sold, {{was the only}} vehicle of its kind to offer folding and {{separately}} removable 60/40 split rear seats that allowed multiple seating formations and increased load capacity. It also boasted the option of twin sliding side <b>load</b> <b>doors</b> as well as rear doors or a tailgate, whereas neither of its main competitors have this option. The Connect's design emphasizes Ford's ideal that the vehicle be multipurpose.|$|R
