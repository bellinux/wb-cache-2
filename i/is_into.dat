5|$|Battles {{come in two}} types: random {{encounters}} with standard enemies, and staged boss battles. The battle system revolves around turn-based combat: each side is allowed to perform an action or multiple actions, with each character having independent movements and commands: these actions include attacking with the equipped weapon, using magic, or using an item. The party also has the option to escape from most battles. Key to the battle system are the Bravely and Default options. Brave Points (BP) dictate the number of actions a character or enemy can take within a turn, along with being needed for the execution of certain abilities. Party members can utilize BP down into negative figures, enabling up to four actions within a single turn. When the BP gauge <b>is</b> <b>into</b> negative figures, they must wait for the BP counter to reach zero before they can act again. BP are naturally recovered once per turn. Alternately, a chosen character can Default, which accumulates BP and reduces the damage taken by enemy strikes. An additional power is Bravely Second, an ability which freezes time for the enemy, allowing a party member to move four times in a single turn with no cost. Bravely Second requires SP, a currency which is either replenished while the 3DS is in sleep mode or through buying regenerative SP Drinks using microtransactions. Battle speed during combat can be sped up or returned to normal by the player's choice.|$|E

25|$|It {{generally}} {{occurs in}} small arteries or arterioles and is commonly due to hypertension, intracranial vascular malformations (including cavernous angiomas or arteriovenous malformations), cerebral amyloid angiopathy, or infarcts into which secondary hemorrhage has occurred.

25|$|One of the {{difficulties}} that result from these long development times and high costs is making accurate cores repeatably. This is extremely important because the core {{is an integral part}} of the mold, so essentially each shot <b>is</b> <b>into</b> a new mold cavity. Another difficulty is keeping the core from melting when the plastic is shot into the mold, because the plastic is approximately twice the melting temperature of the core material. A third difficulty is the low strength of the core. Hollow plastic cores can collapse if too much pressure is used in the shot plastic. Metal cores (with low melting temperatures) are solid so they cannot collapse, but are only 10% as strong as steel cores so they can distort. This is especially a problem when molding manifolds, because the waviness of the core can be detrimental to the airflow within the runners.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{is aimed at}} describing the variations of the language forms, describing the different expression between male and female, and describing the equivalence of the implicature pattern of compliment utterances on Legally Blonde movie and its translation.

Having analyzed the data, the writer finds that the forms of compliment utterances and its translation are word <b>is</b> translated <b>into</b> word; noun phrase <b>is</b> translated <b>into</b> word; noun phrase <b>is</b> translated <b>into</b> noun phrase; noun phrase <b>is</b> translated <b>into</b> declarative sentence; simple declarative sentence <b>is</b> translated <b>into</b> word; simple declarative sentence <b>is</b> translated <b>into</b> adjective phrase; simple declarative sentence <b>is</b> translated <b>into</b> simple declarative sentence; negative declarative sentence <b>is</b> translated <b>into</b> negative declarative sentence; compound sentence us translated into compound sentence; compound sentence <b>is</b> translated <b>into</b> simple declarative sentence; interrogative sentence <b>is</b> translated <b>into</b> interrogative sentence; negative interrogative sentence <b>is</b> translated <b>into</b> declarative sentence; negative interrogative sentence <b>is</b> translated <b>into</b> negative interrogative sentence; and exclamatory sentence <b>is</b> translated <b>into</b> adjective phrase. In the case of politeness strategies the writer finds equivalence in bald on record, positive politeness, negative politeness, and off record; and the non equivalence case the writer finds in negative politeness <b>is</b> translated <b>into</b> positive politeness. In the case of implicature the writer finds the equivalence in source language and target language are conventional implicature <b>is</b> translated <b>into</b> conventional implicature; conventional implicature <b>is</b> translated <b>into</b> conversational implicature; and conversational implicature <b>is</b> translated <b>into</b> conversational implicature. ...|$|R

25|$|Over {{the real}} numbers (if the {{coefficients}} must be real), {{there are no}} non-hyperbolic loxodromic transformations, and the classification <b>is</b> <b>into</b> elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic, as for real conics. The terminology is due to considering half the absolute value of the trace, |tr|/2, as the eccentricity of the transformation– division by 2 corrects for the dimension, so the identity has eccentricity 1 (tr/n is sometimes used as an alternative for the trace for this reason), and absolute value corrects for the trace only being defined up to a factor of ±1 due to working in PSL. Alternatively one may use half the trace squared {{as a proxy for}} the eccentricity squared, as was done above; these classifications (but not the exact eccentricity values, since squaring and absolute values are different) agree for real traces but not complex traces. The same terminology is used for the classification of elements of SL(2, R) (the 2-fold cover), and analogous classifications are used elsewhere. Loxodromic transformations are an essentially complex phenomenon, and correspond to complex eccentricities.|$|E
25|$|Ælfric {{was asked}} by Æthelweard to {{translate}} the book of Genesis up {{to the story of}} Abraham and Isaac, along with selections from other books of the Hexateuch. Against his better judgment, Ælfric agreed because he knew it would be done regardless of whether he helped or not. This, the Old English Hexateuch, was revolutionary, for {{it was the first time}} that the Bible was translated from Latin into the vernacular, that <b>is,</b> <b>into</b> Old English. To his translation of Genesis, he wrote a preface. This preface was to ensure that the uneducated who might read this translation of the Old Testament would understand that they ought not believe that the practices of the ancient Israelites were still acceptable for Christians. In his preface, Ælfric employs the same writing techniques that King Alfred used in his preface to a translation of the Cura Pastoralis. Also notable is that in his translation of Genesis Ælfric did not just translate it word for word from the Latin, which was common due to the belief that the word order of sacred Scripture was itself sacred. Rather, he translated much of it by its meaning; he recognized that the meaning of what the Bible said was the most important thing to be conveyed, not the word order.|$|E
