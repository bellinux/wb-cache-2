Best results were obtained when MH was applied at post-full bloom. MH when applied at full bloom or at post-full bloom {{did not result in}} a significant reduction in yield or leaf area. ^ MH was effective in reducing the percentage of sprouted and rotted tubers in the three methods of storage. However, Fusarex was only effective in reducing sprouting of cold stored potatoes. ^ The surface storage produced the best chip quality but resulted in high percentage of sprouting. This increase in sprouting percentage was effectively suppressed when MH was used. The pit storage resulted in the highest percent of rotting and respiration rate of the tubers. ^ The five cultivars were not significantly different in percentage of sprouting or rotting in the three methods of storage, but they varied significantly in chip quality, glucose content, respiration rate and ethanol production. The cultivar Norchip, having the lowest percentage of glucose, had a lower respiration rate and the best chip quality, whereas Rhinered had the highest glucose content, higher respiration rate and darkest chip quality. ^ The <b>Ebulliometer</b> Salleron method of measurement of ethanol production gave consistently higher value (11 % higher) than the refractometer method. When compared to a standard, the <b>Ebulliometer</b> Salleron method was more accurate, due to the error in the refractometer which is more sensitive to minor change in temperature.

40|$|ABSTRACT – This paper aims {{to obtain}} {{experimental}} data on vapor-liquid equilibrium of the ethanol-water-calcium nitrate at atmospheric pressure, {{as well as}} the validation of the UNIFAC thermodynamic model. Several solvents have been studied to break the azeotrope of ethanol-water systems, including salts, organic solvents and ionic liquids. The choice of salt is due to the importance of searching for other cheaper solvents to separate ethanol from water. Thus, the data were measured using an Othmer-type <b>ebulliometer</b> and composition analysis was obtained using a digital densimeter. Salt was used at concentrations of 0. 06 and 0. 15 mole, and 30 % (w/w) (dehydrated salt), to compare the behavior between the VLE with and without the salts. All the experiments were done in triplicate. An enrichment of ethanol in the vapor phase was observed, indicating the breaking of the azeotrope. Furthermore, the average relative deviation between the experimental measurements of calcium nitrate dehydrated 30 % (w/w) and the predicted values by the model was less than 7 % for the vapor phase composition and for the temperatures, therefore validating the model. This study showed that calcium nitrate is a solvent {{that can be used for}} the production of anhydrous ethanol with a high purity with low cost. 1...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis work {{focuses on}} {{equilibrium}} modeling of CO 2 solubility in aqueous solutions of unloaded (as hydroxides) and loaded (as carbonates) hydroxides containing Li+, Na+ and K+ counter ions. Due to the ionic {{nature of the}} LiOH/NaOH/KOH-CO 2 -H 2 O solutions, the electrolyte-Non-Random-Two-Liquid (e-NRTL) model, described by Chen and Evans [1], is applied to correct the non-idealities in the liquid phase. The special feature of the equilibrium model employed in this work is the simultaneously regression of Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium (PCO 2, Ptotal) and apparent Henry's law constant data selected from literature and Ptotal data for LiOH measured in this work. This approach will give better prediction for the molecular CO 2 activity coefficients and the liquid phase activities calculated by use of the resulting e-NRTL model will {{be consistent with the}} apparent Henry's law constant.

40|$|In this paper, the {{azeotropic}} behaviour of the (benzene + cyclohexane + chlorobenzene) {{ternary mixture}} was experimentally investigated {{with the aim}} of enhancing the knowledge for the feasible use of chlorobenzene as an entrainer for the azeotropic distillation of the binary azeotrope. Such a study has not been reported in the literature to the best of the authors’ knowledge. (Vapour + liquid) equilibria data for (benzene + cyclohexane + chlorobenzene) at 101. 3 kPa were obtained with a Othmer-type <b>ebulliometer.</b> Data were tested and considered thermodynamically consistent. The experimental results showed that this ternary mixture is completely miscible and exhibits an unique binary homogeneous azeotrope, an unstable node at the conditions studied, and the propitious topological characteristics (residual curve map and relative volatility) to be separated. Satisfactory results were obtained for the correlation of equilibrium compositions with the UNIQUAC activity coefficients model and also for prediction with the UNIFAC method. In both cases, low root mean square deviations of the vapour mole fraction and temperature were calculated. The capability of chlorobenzene as a modified distillation agent at atmospheric condition is discussed in terms of the thermodynamic topological analysis. A conceptual distillation scheme with reversed volatility is proposed to separate the azeotropic mixture.

40|$|The {{distillation}} {{of close}} boiling mixtures may {{be improved by}} adding a proper affinity solvent, and thereby creating an extractive distillation process. An example of a close boiling mixture that may be separated by extractive distillation is the mixture ethylbenzene/styrene. The ionic liquid 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium thiocyanate ([EMIM][SCN]) is a promising solvent to separate ethylbenzene and styrene by extractive distillation. In this study, (vapour + liquid) equilibrium data have been measured for the binary system (styrene + [EMIM][SCN]) over the pressure range of (3 to 20) kPa and binary and ternary (liquid + liquid) equilibrium data of the system (ethylbenzene + styrene + [EMIM][SCN]) at temperatures (313. 2, 333. 2 and 353. 2) K. Due to the low solubility of ethylbenzene in [EMIM][SCN], {{it was not possible}} to measure accurately VLE data of the binary system (ethylbenzene + [EMIM][SCN]) and of the ternary system (ethylbenzene + styrene + [EMIM][SCN]) using the <b>ebulliometer.</b> Because previous work showed that the LLE selectivity is a good measure for the selectivity in VLE, we determined the selectivity with LLE. The selectivity of [EMIM][SCN] to styrene in LLE measurements ranges from 2. 1 at high styrene raffinate purity to 2. 6 at high ethylbenzene raffinate purity. The NRTL model can properly describe the experimental results. The rRMSD in temperature, pressure and mole fraction for the binary VLE data are respectively (0. 1, 0. 12 and 0. 13) %.

40|$|Increasing {{concern about}} air {{pollution}} {{has led many}} countries to adopt more stringent regulations, which impose an ultra-low concentration of sulphur in gasoline. These regulations place many challenges for the refining industry. Lower sulphur levels are being recommended for gasoline and diesel for environmental reasons. New methods and innovations are required to further reduce the sulphur level in liquid fuels. Separation process design to accomplish the removal of sulphur compounds requires knowledge of the vapour-liquid equilibrium (VLE) of sulphur compounds with hydrocarbons, particularly their activity coefficients at infinite dilution. However, the investigations concerning the systems containing sulphur compounds are very limited. This thesis deals with the VLE measurements of selected sulphur compounds (1 -propanethiol, diethyl sulphide, and thiophene) with various hydrocarbons (C 6 to C 8) and 2 -ethoxy- 2 -methylpropane (ETBE) under isobaric and isothermal conditions, using a circulation still and the infinite dilutions activity coefficients measurements of 1 -propanethiol, ethyl methyl sulphide, and thiophene in toluene, n-heptane, and 2, 2, 4 -trimethylpentane at 90  kPa using comparative <b>ebulliometer</b> techniques. The gamma-phi approach {{was used in the}} calculation of VLE. The activity coefficients of the liquid phase (γ) were correlated with the Wilson model. The Wilson model gave a good correlation for all systems. The activity coefficients at infinite dilution (γ∞) were extrapolated from the VLE measurements with the Wilson model. The γ∞ values of sulphur compounds for the systems thiophene + toluene and thiophene + 2, 2, 4 -trimethylpentane obtained from the recirculation still measurements are compared with the γ∞ values of sulphur compounds obtained from the comparative <b>ebulliometer</b> measurements. The agreement between the measurements is good. All the measured γ∞ of sulphur compounds in hydrocarbons are less than two. 1 -Propanethiol, thiophene, and diethyl sulphide in toluene show nearly ideal behaviour, and thus the γ∞ of sulphur compounds for these systems are one. The activity coefficients of sulphur compounds in hydrocarbons show the typical behaviour of positive deviations from Raoult's law, which become smaller with increasing temperature and with {{an increase in the number}} of C-atoms of the alkanes. The systems 1 -propanethiol, thiophene, and diethyl sulphide in toluene show nearly ideal behaviour. No azeotrope formation was observed for the systems thiophene + 1 -hexene and diethyl sulphide + 1 -hexene. The reaction between 1 -propanethiol and 1 -hexene was observed. The systems thiophene + n-hexane and thiophene + 2, 2, 4 -trimethylpentane, as well as the systems diethyl sulphide + n-heptane and diethyl sulphide + 2, 2, 4 -trimethylpentane, show positive deviations from Raoult's law. These systems exhibit maximum pressure azeotropy. The systems thiophene + 1 -hexene and thiophene + 2 -ethoxy- 2 -methylpropane, as well as the systems diethyl sulphide with n-hexane, 1 -hexene, cyclohexane, and 2 -ethoxy- 2 -methylpropane, show positive deviation and strong nonideality. No azeotropes formed in these systems. The original UNIFAC predictive model is adequate to describe the behaviour of sulphur in hydrocarbons, even though its application is limited to the availability of the functional group interaction parameters. COSMO-RS gives poor prediction for all the systems studied, and thus it is not currently a suitable model for predicting the behaviour of systems containing sulphur compounds. These new consistent measurements can be used to improve and develop thermodynamic models in dilute systems, and thus the behaviour of organic sulphur compounds in the distillation of hydrocarbons can be simulated. reviewe...|$|E
40|$|A mixed 2 -(diethylamino) -ethanol (DEEA) and 3 -(methylamino) -propylamine (MAPA) {{system could}} be an {{attractive}} alternative solvent to improve the performance of CO 2 capture for low partial pressure cases. This solvent has the advantages of forming two liquid phases upon CO 2 loading, one rich in CO 2 and the other very low in CO 2. Having a highly concentrated rich solvent improvements could be reached by reducing the sensible heat and improving the equilibrium sensitivity hence reducing the need for stripping steam. Also {{it is possible that}} the heat of absorption may change to the better. To better understand this system in designing the separation unit requires substantial work on characterization of the solvent. One important aspect is to provide equilibrium data. In this work new ebulliometric VLE data for the binary DEEA/H 2 O and DEEA/MAPA systems and the ternary DEEA/MAPA/H 2 O system are reported at different temperatures and concentrations. Results show that pure MAPA is more volatile than DEEA, but in aqueous solution MAPA was found to be less volatile. A mix of DEEA and MAPA in aqueous solution tends to lower the volatility thus makes the system more advantageous by reducing volatility. The activity coefficients for the species in the ternary aqueous system are found to be lower than the activity coefficients obtained from the corresponding binary aqueous mixtures. The UNIQUAC framework was implemented to represent the experimental data. The six UNIQUAC parameters were determined and were able to predict P-T-x-y, activity coefficient, excess enthalpy and freezing point depression for both the binary and ternary systems. However, a small inconsistency was observed between water activity coefficients determined from <b>ebulliometer</b> and freezing point depression measurements. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Physics is {{introduced}} {{as a basic}} matter in the curricula of professional schools (i. e. schools for agriculture, electronic or chemistry experts). Students meet physics {{in the early years}} of their training and then continue in vocational subjects where many physics' topics can be useful. Rarely, however, the connection between physics and professional matters is quite explicit. Students often feel physics as boring and useless, i. e. very far from their interests. In these schools it is almost always required the physics lab, but it does not always exist. The physics teachers of a local Agricultural Technical Institute asked us to realize a learning path in laboratory for their students, since in their school the physics lab was missing. This institute is the only public school in the Chianti area specializing in Viticulture and Enology, and attending a further year post diploma, allows the achievement of the qualification of Enologist. We report a learning path realized starting from thermal equilibrium to a full understanding of the measures made with the Malligand's <b>ebulliometer,</b> used for determining the alcoholic strength (alcohol concentration by volume) of an alcoholic beverage and water/alcohol solutions in general. The aim was to make interesting measures of physical quantities, calorimetry and state transitions connecting them to the functioning of an instrument that students use in their professional career. The feedback of students and the interests of their teachers convinced us to go further in this way.

40|$|The energy {{required}} to operate CO 2 capture systems at present significantly reduces the overall efficiency of fossil fuel based power generation and other industrial processes {{and leads to}} increased fuel requirements, solid wastes generation and environmental impacts relative to {{the same type of}} base plant without capture. Minimization of energy requirements for capture, together with improvements in the efficiency of the energy conversion processes will continue to be of highest priority for future improved technologies. Energy requirements for CO 2 capture are directly related to the solvents used; being required in the solvent regeneration stage for heating up the solvent, for providing the required heat of desorption for the chemically bound CO 2, and for producing sufficient steam for stripping in {{the upper part of the}} desorber. Little experimental data of the heats of absorption/desorption have been published in the open literature. An even smaller number of publications may be found on the modelling of the heat of absorption. Heats of absorption have very often been calculated, using the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation, from data on partial pressure of CO 2 as function of temperature and loading. One objective of this work has been the measurement and prediction of heats of absorption of CO 2 with aqueous solutions of a range of amines and their mixtures. Heats of absorption were in this work measured in a reaction calorimeter at low system pressure, (max 3 and 10 bar) and in an industrially important range of temperatures (40 to 120 ºC). A method was developed and validated in this work for the first time for measuring heats of absorption that were differential both in temperature and loading. It was shown in this work that it is possible to predict overall heats of absorption of CO 2 using temperature dependent correlations for the equilibrium constants of each of the key reactions taking place in the systems CO 2 + amine + H 2 O. For the first time, heat contributions from the individual reactions for basic amines (MEA and MDEA) were separated out and discussed. It was shown that experimental heats of absorption values may be used together with partial pressures of CO 2 for fitting some of the equilibrium constants. Two equilibrium models – the Deshmukh-Mather model (Deshmukh and Mather, 1981) and the electrolyte-Non-Random-Two-Liquid model (Chen and Evans, 1986), were used in this work for calculating the activity coefficients and concentrations of species distribution in the solutions. Based on these data, the extents of reactions were calculated and used for the estimation of the heat contributions of the individual reactions. Predictions of the overall heats of absorption using both models were compared. The other main objective of this work was to measure vapour-liquid equilibria (VLE) on the unloaded amine + water solution. These data are necessary for proper thermodynamic modelling. For engineering purposes, it is often necessary to make estimates of activity coefficients for mixtures, where only fragmentary data, or no data at all, are available. Accurate data for vapour pressures of pure components are also very important in the calculation of activity coefficients. They are highly sensitive to the experimental conditions and to the purity of the materials used. For proper experimental determination of vapour-liquid equilibria (VLE) it is essential that the vapour pressures of the pure components be measured with the same apparatus and for the same lots of material as are used for the other measurements so that they are an integral part of the data set. Vapour pressure of pure components and equilibrium vapour pressure and compositions of both vapour and liquid phases for binary and ternary amine + water solutions were measured in a modified Swietoslawski <b>ebulliometer</b> under pressures of maximum 1 bar at temperatures from 40 to 100 ºC, The data were used in calculations of experimental activity coefficients for the components in the liquid and vapour phases. Binary molecule-molecule interaction parameters were fitted in this work to the experimental activity coefficients of amines and water. It was shown that these parameters may be used in activity coefficient models. Also, experimental activity coefficients may be used for testing VLE models on their ability to predict the system behaviour at zero loading.
