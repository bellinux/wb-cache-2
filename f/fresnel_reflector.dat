50|$|<b>Fresnel</b> <b>reflectors</b> {{are made}} of many thin, flat mirror strips to {{concentrate}} sunlight onto tubes through which working fluid is pumped.

5|$|Compact Linear <b>Fresnel</b> <b>Reflectors</b> are CSP-plants {{which use}} many thin mirror strips instead of {{parabolic}} mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto two tubes with working fluid.

50|$|A {{solar tracker}} is {{a device that}} orients a payload toward the Sun. Payloads are usually solar panels, {{parabolic}} troughs, <b>fresnel</b> <b>reflectors,</b> lenses or the mirrors of a heliostat.|$|R
25|$|A linear <b>Fresnel</b> <b>reflector</b> {{power plant}} uses {{a series of}} long, narrow, shallow-curvature (or even flat) mirrors to focus light onto one or more linear {{receivers}} positioned above the mirrors. On top of the receiver a small parabolic mirror can be attached for further focusing the light. These systems aim to offer lower overall costs by sharing a receiver between several mirrors (as compared with trough and dish concepts), while still using the simple line-focus geometry with one axis for tracking. This {{is similar to the}} trough design (and different from central towers and dishes with dual-axis). The receiver is stationary and so fluid couplings are not required (as in troughs and dishes). The mirrors also do not need to support the receiver, so they are structurally simpler. When suitable aiming strategies are used (mirrors aimed at different receivers at different times of day), this can allow a denser packing of mirrors on available land area.|$|E

50|$|A compact linear <b>Fresnel</b> <b>reflector</b> (CLFR) - also {{referred}} to as a concentrating linear <b>Fresnel</b> <b>reflector</b> - is a specific type of linear <b>Fresnel</b> <b>reflector</b> (LFR) technology. Linear Fresnel reflectors use long, thin segments of mirrors to focus sunlight onto a fixed absorber located at a common focal point of the reflectors. These mirrors are capable of concentrating the sun’s energy to approximately 30 times its normal intensity. This concentrated energy is transferred through the absorber into some thermal fluid (this is typically oil capable of maintaining liquid state at very high temperatures). The fluid then goes through a heat exchanger to power a steam generator. As opposed to traditional LFR’s, the CLFR utilizes multiple absorbers within the vicinity of the mirrors.|$|E

40|$|Linear Fresnel {{collector}} arrays {{present some}} relevant advantages {{in the domain}} of concentrating solar power because of their simplicity, robustness and low capital cost. However, they also present important drawbacks and limitations, notably their average concentration ratio, which seems to limit significantly the performance of these systems. First, the paper addresses the problem of characterizing the mirror field configuration assuming hourly data of a typical year, in reference to a configuration similar to that of Fresdemo. For a proper comparative study, it is necessary to define a comparison criterion. In that sense, a new variable is defined, the useful energy efficiency, which only accounts for the radiation that impinges on the receiver with intensities above a reference value. As a second step, a comparative study between central linear <b>Fresnel</b> <b>reflectors</b> and compact linear <b>Fresnel</b> <b>reflectors</b> is carried out. This analysis shows that compact linear <b>Fresnel</b> <b>reflectors</b> minimize blocking and shading losses compared to a central configuration. However this minimization is not enough to overcome other negative effects of the compact Fresnel collectors, as the greater dispersion of the rays reaching the receiver, caused by the fact that mirrors must be located farther from the receiver, which yields to lower efficiencies...|$|R
