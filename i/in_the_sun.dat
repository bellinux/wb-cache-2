5|$|In the 1970s, much {{research}} {{focused on the}} abundances of iron-group elements <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun.</b> Although significant research was done, until 1978 {{it was difficult to}} determine the abundances of some iron-group elements (e.g. cobalt and manganese) via spectrography because of their hyperfine structures.|$|E
5|$|Neon's {{abundance}} {{in the universe}} is about 1 part in 750; <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> and presumably in the proto-solar system nebula, about 1 part in 600. The Galileo spacecraft atmospheric entry probe found {{that even in the}} upper atmosphere of Jupiter, the abundance of neon is reduced (depleted) by about a factor of 10, to a level of 1 part in 6,000 by mass. This may indicate that even the ice-planetesimals which brought neon into Jupiter from the outer solar system, formed in a region which was too warm to retain the neon atmospheric component (abundances of heavier inert gases on Jupiter are several times that found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun).</b>|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1983, it {{was thought}} that the whole Sun has the same {{composition}} as the solar atmosphere. In 1983, it was claimed that it was fractionation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> itself that caused the isotopic-composition relationship between the planetary and solar-wind-implanted noble gases.|$|E

5|$|According {{to reports}} <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Sun,</b> the {{following}} day at 3:00pm, those who were left of the original 6th Regiment disbanded.

The armory of the 6th remained guarded by a single police officer.|$|E
5|$|Bats may avoid flying {{during the}} day to prevent {{overheating}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun,</b> since their dark wing-membranes absorb solar radiation.

5|$|Carbon is {{the fourth}} most {{abundant}} chemical element in the universe by mass after hydrogen, helium, and oxygen. Carbon is abundant <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> stars, comets, and in the atmospheres of most planets. Some meteorites contain microscopic diamonds that were formed when the solar system was still a protoplanetary disk. Microscopic diamonds may also be formed by the intense pressure and high temperature at the sites of meteorite impacts.|$|E
5|$|Cnidarians feed {{in several}} ways: predation, {{absorbing}} dissolved organic chemicals, filtering food particles {{out of the}} water, obtaining nutrients from symbiotic algae within their cells, and parasitism.

Cnidaria give their symbiotic algae carbon dioxide, some nutrients, a place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> and protection against predators.|$|E
5|$|HD 2039 is {{a stable}} G-type star, meaning it shines with white light {{that can be}} seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun.</b> In terms of mass, the star {{exhibits}} almost identical properties.

The star is slightly hotter than the Sun; while HD 2039 has a temperature of 5935 K, the Sun's surface temperature lies nearly 200 kelvins lower at 5778 K. HD 2039 is unusually metal-rich, which has attracted the attention of astrophysicists.|$|E

5|$|High-energy gamma-ray photons {{initially}} released with fusion {{reactions in}} the core are almost immediately absorbed by the solar plasma of the radiative zone, usually after traveling only a few millimeters. Re-emission happens in a random direction and usually at a slightly lower energy. With this sequence of emissions and absorptions, {{it takes a long}} time for radiation to reach the Sun's surface. Estimates of the photon travel time range between 10,000 and 170,000years. In contrast, it takes only 2.3 seconds for the neutrinos, which account for about 2% of the total energy production of the Sun, to reach the surface. Because energy transport <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> is a process that involves photons in thermodynamic equilibrium with matter, the time scale of energy transport <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> is longer, on the order of 30,000,000 years. This is the time it would take the Sun to return to a stable state, if the rate of energy generation in its core were suddenly changed.|$|E
