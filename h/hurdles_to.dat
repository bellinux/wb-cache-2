5|$|The New Zealanders had {{a number}} of preparatory <b>hurdles</b> <b>to</b> {{overcome}} before the battle. The men of the Rifle Brigade had, for the previous few weeks, been carrying out engineering work for II ANZAC Corps and were fatigued. The ongoing rainfall affected both the roads by which the division had to move to its starting positions and the placement of the supporting artillery. The muddy ground did not provide a stable platform for the guns and howitzers. Furthermore, the artillery barrage targeting the barbed wire emplacements protecting the strongpoints on the slopes of Belluvue Spur failed to destroy them, a fact determined by scouts on 11 October. Once this information reached the brigade commanders, Braithwaite and A. E. Stewart (who took over command of the Rifle Brigade following Young's wounding), they pressed Russell for cancellation of the attack; this was refused.|$|E

25|$|While this {{cooperation}} {{presents a}} new set of challenges and <b>hurdles</b> <b>to</b> fieldwork, it has benefits for all parties involved. Tribal elders cooperating with archaeologists can prevent the excavation of areas of sites that they consider sacred, while the archaeologists gain the elders' aid in interpreting their finds. There have also been active efforts to recruit aboriginal peoples directly into the archaeological profession.|$|E

25|$|In {{presenting}} {{his theory}} of human behavior, Nietzsche also addressed, and attacked, concepts from philosophies popularly embraced in his days, such as Schopenhauer's notion of an aimless will or that of utilitarianism. Utilitarians claim that what moves people is mainly {{the desire to be}} happy, to accumulate pleasure in their lives. But such a conception of happiness Nietzsche rejected as something limited to, and characteristic of, the bourgeois lifestyle of the English society, and instead put forth the idea that happiness is not an aim per se—it is instead a consequence of a successful pursuit of one's aims, of the overcoming of <b>hurdles</b> <b>to</b> one's actions—in other words, of the fulfillment of the will.|$|E
25|$|The term {{private bank}} {{refers to a}} bank that offers private banking {{services}} and in its legal form is a partnership. The first private banks were created in St. Gallen in the mid-18th century and in Geneva in the late 18th century as partnerships, and some {{are still in the}} hands of the original families such as Hottinger and Mirabaud. In Switzerland, such private banks are called private bankers (a protected term) to distinguish them from the other private banks which are typically shared corporations. Historically in Switzerland a minimum of CHF1million was required to open an account, however, over the last years many private banks have lowered their entry <b>hurdles</b> <b>to</b> CHF250,000 for private investors.|$|E

25|$|Three new women's {{events were}} {{introduced}} at the 21st {{edition of the}} competition: pole vault, hammer throw, and the 20 km race walk. Apart from the new events, eight previous games records were beaten at the competition, as well as 29 national records. Many champions from the 1999 edition of the tournament retained their titles: Arumugam Munusamy (men's 1500 metres) and Supriati Sutono (women's 5000 metres) won their third straight SEA Games titles, Juthaporn Krasaeyan had her third consecutive women's shot put and discus throw double, Loo Kum Zee won his fourth men's high jump gold, James Wong Tuck Yim took a fifth title in the men's discus and Nur Herman Majid extended his unbeaten run in the 110 metres <b>hurdles</b> <b>to</b> six titles.|$|E
25|$|Having {{finished}} her junior career, she gained an athletic scholarship {{to study at}} the University of Technology, Jamaica – an institution with a prominent sports programme. She continued {{to focus on the}} 400m hurdles, setting a new best of 56.30 seconds in 2013, and began training in the event under Stephen Francis at the MVP Track Club. She markedly improved her performances in 2014. She knocked over a second and a half off her 400m sprint best, running a time of 51.49 seconds in Kingston in June. At the Jamaican Championships she was runner-up i the 400m <b>hurdles</b> <b>to</b> the Kaliese Spencer, the top Jamaican and training partner. Russell's time of 54.75 seconds was almost a second improvement on her previous best.|$|E
25|$|A study {{published}} in June 2016 evaluated {{the status of the}} implementation of Golden Rice, which was first developed in the 1990s to produce higher levels of Vitamin A than its non-GMO counterparts. This strain of rice was designed so that malnourished women and children in third world countries who were more susceptible to deficiencies could easily improve their Vitamin A intake levels and prevent blindness, which is a common result. Golden Rice production was centralized to the Philippines, yet there have been many <b>hurdles</b> <b>to</b> jump in order to get production moving. The study showed that the project is far behind schedule and is not living up to its expectations. Although research on Golden Rice still continues, the country has moved forward with other non-GMO initiatives to address the Vitamin A deficiency problem which is so prevasive in that region.|$|E

25|$|Statistics {{show that}} {{education}} in Pakistan {{can be characterized}} by extensive gender inequalities. Girls/women have to face socio-cultural <b>hurdles</b> <b>to</b> acquire education. International community has developed a consensus through the Millennium Development Goals to eliminate gender inequality from education. The proponents of gender equality {{argue that it is}} not only humane and ethical thing to provide everyone easy access to education without any gender bias, but it is also essential for development and progress of a society that both men and women are educated. They also point towards empirical studies that have confirmed that gender inequality in education has significant impact on rural poverty in Pakistan, and female literacy is important for poverty alleviation. Feminists like Martha Nussbaum are arguing that there is an immediate need to increase the public expenditures on female education in order to achieve gender equality at all levels.|$|E
25|$|In his 2004 book, the Russian {{linguist}} Andrey Zaliznyak analyzes {{arguments and}} {{concludes that the}} forgery theory is virtually impossible. It {{was not until the}} late 20th century, after hundreds of bark documents were unearthed in Novgorod, that scholars learned that some of the puzzling passages and words of the tale were part of common speech in the 12th century, although they were not represented in chronicles and other formal written documents. Zaliznyak concludes that no 18th-century scholar could have imitated the subtle grammatical and syntactical features in the known text. He did not believe that Dobrovský could have accomplished this, as his views on Slavic grammar (as expressed in his magnum opus, Institutiones) were strikingly different from the system written in Igor's Tale. In his revised second edition issued in 2007, Zaliznyak was able to use evidence from the posthumous edition of Zimin's 2006 book. He argued that even someone striving to imitate some older texts would have had almost impossible <b>hurdles</b> <b>to</b> overcome, as mere imitation could not have represented the deep mechanics of the language.|$|E

500|$|The game {{is based}} on LucasArts' {{proprietary}} [...] "Ronin" [...] game engine but also integrates third-party technology: Havok for rigid body physics, Pixelux Entertainment's [...] "Digital Molecular Matter" [...] (DMM) for dynamically destructible objects, and NaturalMotion's Euphoria for realistic non-player character artificial intelligence. LucasArts' programmers had to overcome technical <b>hurdles</b> <b>to</b> get Havok-, DMM- and Euphoria-coded components to interact. Developers also had {{to strike a balance}} between realistic and entertaining physics. LucasArts initially opted not to release a personal computer version of The Force Unleashed, stating that doing the game well would be too processor-intensive for typical PCs and that scaling down the game's procedural physics for the PC platform would [...] "fundamentally" [...] change The Force Unleasheds gameplay. However, LucasArts later announced Windows and Mac versions of the game, developed in conjunction with Aspyr Media, for release in Fall 2009.|$|E
500|$|On 31 January 1606, Fawkes {{and three}} others– Thomas Wintour, Ambrose Rookwood, and Robert Keyes– were dragged (i.e., [...] "drawn") from the Tower on wattled <b>hurdles</b> <b>to</b> the Old Palace Yard at Westminster, {{opposite}} the building they {{had attempted to}} destroy. [...] His fellow plotters were then hanged and quartered. [...] Fawkes {{was the last to}} stand on the scaffold. [...] He asked for forgiveness of the King and state, while keeping up his [...] "crosses and idle ceremonies" [...] (Catholic practices). [...] Weakened by torture and aided by the hangman, Fawkes began to climb the ladder to the noose, but either through jumping to his death or climbing too high so the rope was incorrectly set, he managed to avoid the agony of the latter part of his execution by breaking his neck. His lifeless body was nevertheless quartered and, as was the custom, his body parts were then distributed to [...] "the four corners of the kingdom", to be displayed as a warning to other would-be traitors.|$|E
500|$|Objects {{that are}} smaller than the katamari will stick to it when the player comes into contact with them, while greater objects can be hurdles; colliding at high speed with any may cause objects to fall off the katamari, slowing the player's progress. The game uses size, weight, and surface area to {{determine}} if an object will stick to the katamari. [...] This allows slender objects, such as pencils, that are longer than the katamari is wide, to be picked up, and these will alter how the katamari rolls until more objects are picked up. [...] Animals such as cats will chase the katamari, knocking things from it, but once the katamari is great enough, it will scare the animals away, {{and they can be}} rolled up once they are chased down. As objects stick to the katamari, the katamari will grow, eventually allowing objects that were once <b>hurdles</b> <b>to</b> be picked up, and creating access to areas that were formerly blocked. [...] In this manner, the player might start the game by picking up thumbtacks and ants, and slowly work up {{to the point where the}} katamari is picking up buildings, mountains, and clouds.|$|E
