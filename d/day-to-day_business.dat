40|$|Abstract—Every {{organization}} owns or {{manages a}} LAN for its <b>day-to-day</b> <b>businesses.</b> Different studies shows {{that on the}} average only 5 % of the total computational power of an organization is used and remaining 95 % goes unused. On the other side there are enormous research projects that can’t be performed because the research community or a single organization can’t afford to purchase the required computational resources. Local ad hoc grids are formed with the aim to utilize the unutilized computational resources of a single organization or across different organizations. Participating computing nodes in local ad hoc grids need to be autonomous, intelligent, reactive and self-organizing. Software agents provide these characteristics. In this paper we describe local Ad Hoc grids {{as an alternative to}} large scale grids and supercomputing. Different issues faced in developing an Agent-based local ad hoc grid will be discussed. At the end initial design and experimental setup of an agent-based local ad hoc grid will be discussed...|$|R
