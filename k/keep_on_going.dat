He mentioned that Shaft was always pressed for time during the production process and only just managed to complete each episode right before its air time.

However, in overcoming this situation, he remarked [...] "a week went by, and two weeks went by, and the staff started saying that they couldn't stay in shock forever, that they had to <b>keep</b> <b>on</b> <b>going,</b> and then production continued." ...|$|E

She hoped to give her fans {{an idea of what}} her life two years prior and to instill relief or inspiration in them. In the song, Carey sings [...] "Not more than three short years ago / I was abandoned and alone / Without a penny to my name / So very young and so afraid / No proper shoes upon my feet / Sometimes I couldn't even eat / I often cried myself to sleep." [...] Later in the song, Carey sings [...] "But still I had to <b>keep</b> <b>on</b> <b>going</b> / I struggled and I prayed / And finally found my way," [...] retelling how her faith helped guide her until her career blossomed and expressing to listeners the importance of finding and connecting with God.

[...] Describing the character, Hunnam stated: [...] "When you meet me, in the beginning of the story, I've suffered a giant loss. Not only has it killed my sense of self-worth, but also my will to fight and <b>keep</b> <b>on</b> <b>going.</b> And then, Rinko and Idris, and a couple other people, bring me {{out of retirement}} to try to help with this grand push. I think that journey is a very relatable one. Everybody, at some point in their life, has fallen down and not felt like getting back up, but you have to, no matter how difficult it is."

500|$|The {{gameplay}} {{was generally}} praised by reviewers, who typically found the combat engaging but were {{split on the}} repetitive aspects of the game. 1UP.com's Matt Clark said that the sword gameplay [...] "just feels right", while Mark Brown of Eurogamer said that the combat had an excitement factor that pushed players to <b>keep</b> <b>on</b> <b>going</b> for one more battle. Tracy Erickson of Pocket Gamer described the swipe-based combat system as [...] "easy to understand, though tough to master", and Nick Chester of Destructoid said that although the combat was not very complicated, {{it was fun to}} play. The role-playing game elements were praised—Destructoid's Chester called them [...] "satisfying" [...] and IGN's Goldstein said that they added to the game's difficulty. Brown's review for Eurogamer, however, said that while good they were not as engaging as the combat, and the Edge review dismissed them as minimal. Reviewers had mixed opinions on the effectiveness of the bloodline system's repetition: Destructoid's Chester described it as addictive and IGN's Goldstein agreed, but Erickson's review for Pocket Gamer said that the game had problems with repetition and Wired Meyer dismissed it as [...] "repetitive ... as the title suggests". J. Nicholas Geist, writing for Kill Screen, focused his entire review on the cyclical nature of the game, treating its nature of repetition with small changes between each bloodline as a metaphor for life. Most reviewers found themselves between the two extremes, with Brown of Eurogamer simultaneously describing it as [...] "alarmingly repetitious" [...] but still addictive and 1UP.com's Clark saying that enjoying the game required getting past the repetition, despite being [...] "stellar".|$|E

60|$|And {{that is how}} it {{came about}} that I tackled surf-riding. And now that I have tackled it, more than ever do I hold {{it to be a}} royal sport. But first let me explain the physics of it. A wave is a communicated agitation. The water that composes the body of a wave does not move. If it did, when a stone is thrown into a pond and the ripples spread away in an ever {{widening}} circle, there would appear at the centre an ever increasing hole. No, the water that composes the body of a wave is stationary. Thus, you may watch a particular portion of the ocean's surface and you will see the sane water rise and fall a thousand times to the agitation communicated by a thousand successive waves. Now imagine this communicated agitation moving shoreward. As the bottom shoals, the lower portion of the wave strikes land first and is stopped. But water is fluid, and the upper portion has not struck anything, wherefore it <b>keeps</b> <b>on</b> communicating its agitation, <b>keeps</b> <b>on</b> <b>going.</b> And when the top of the wave <b>keeps</b> <b>on</b> <b>going,</b> while the bottom of it lags behind, something is bound to happen. The bottom of the wave drops out from under and the top of the wave falls over, forward, and down, curling and cresting and roaring as it does so. It is the bottom of a wave striking against the top of the land that is the cause of all surfs.|$|R
