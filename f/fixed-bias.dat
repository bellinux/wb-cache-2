5000|$|The 5F4 model had Presence, Bass, and Treble controls, and {{separate}} Volume controls for {{the microphone and}} instrument inputs. It used 12AY7 pre-amplifier tubes for [...] "more clarity and headroom" [...] than a 12AX7 would. A <b>fixed-bias</b> output stage and split-phase inverters helped the Super overdrive more quickly than the Fender Bassman and produce a sound that, according to Vintage Guitar's Dave Hunter, [...] "in the estimation of many a vintage-amp fan, is among the sweetest and most delectable of any amp ever made." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1948 the Pro-Amp {{was part}} of Fender's revamped lineup in top-panel {{cabinets}} covered in luggage twill (miscalled [...] "tweed") with redesigned electronics. The first version (1948-53) had a small, round-cornered speaker aperture and {{is known as the}} [...] "TV-front;" [...] this was followed by the [...] "wide-panel" [...] (1953-55) and [...] "narrow-panel" [...] (1955-60) cabinets. The circuit over this time evolved considerably, from 6SC7 (or 6SL7) grid-leak biased preamp tubes and paraphase inverter driving a cathode-biased 6L6G push-pull output section (model 5A5) to a more advanced 12AY7 cathode-biased preamp and 12AX7 cathodyne inverter driving <b>fixed-bias</b> 6L6GBs with negative feedback and filter choke (model 5E5-A); while headroom was increased and distortion reduced, output power remained around 25 watts.|$|E
5000|$|The Vibrasonic was {{introduced}} in 1959 and was discontinued in 1964. During this period, the [...] "brownface" [...] era, it's brown control panel was matched with light brown ("tan") or standard brown tolex cabinets with grill cloth schemes typically in tweed style ("gold stripe") or yellow ("wheat"). At {{the time of its}} introduction, the Vibrasonic-Amp displaced the Fender Twin as the company's new top of the line or [...] "flagship" [...] model. This elevated status was short-lived however, as the new high-powered 6G8 blonde Twin-Amp appeared in mid 1960. The Vibrasonic was one of the seven models in the newly designated Professional Series [...] of Fender amplifiers. These amplifiers shared nearly identical circuits, with two (or four) 5881/6L6GC tubes in <b>fixed-bias</b> Class AB configuration, long-tailed pair phase inverters, and dual [...] "normal" [...] and [...] "vibrato" [...] channels with independent volume and tone controls; the models were differentiated only by cabinet/speaker configurations, transformers, and rectifiers. The tremolo ("vibrato") circuit which the Vibrasonic premiered and which gave it its name more closely resembled a Vox tremolo circuit than anything which Fender used before or after, a complex [...] "harmonic vibrato" [...] which created the illusion of true pitch-shifting. Two tubes (5G13 model) and later three tubes (6G13-A model) were used in the tremolo circuit alone and this perhaps explains why it was not widely used, and abandoned in the mid-1960s [...] "blackface" [...] amps.|$|E
5000|$|In 1961, a new Princeton (6G2) of {{fundamentally}} different design was introduced, which {{instead of being}} essentially an upgraded Champ {{was more like a}} junior Deluxe. This [...] "brownface" [...] version used a single 7025 dual triode in the preamplifier; a 12AX7 dual triode, one half of which operated a tremolo oscillator and the other half of which served as a split-load phase inverter; and two 6V6GT tubes, which were <b>fixed-biased</b> in Class AB push-pull configuration in the power section. In 1963, the single tone control was replaced with individual bass and treble control knobs, and the base Princeton was joined by the Princeton Reverb. A pull-out [...] "boost" [...] switch was added to the volume pot in 1978.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} experimental characterization of two output-capacitor-free adaptively biased low-dropout regulators (AB LDRs) for system-on-chip applications. The low-voltage high-precision AB LDRs adopt Miller compensation and Q-reduction technique to achieve high stability over a wide load current range, without relying on a large off-chip capacitor. The first implementation of adaptive biasing uses a simple current mirror and is more area efficient; the second one uses a symmetrically matched current-voltage mirror and achieves more accurate sensing of load current. The design considerations and stability strategies are discussed. The two AB LDRs and their counterpart, a <b>fixed-biased</b> LDR, are fabricated using a standard 0. 35 -μm CMOS process. The minimum input voltage is 1. 2 V, the preset output voltage is 1. 0 V and the maximum load current is 100 mA. Measurement results verify that the AB LDRs improve the line and load transient responses and power supply rejections significantly, while maintaining tight regulation, low quiescent current and high current efficiency. © 2010 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|User?s {{everyday}} outgrowing {{demand for}} high-data and high performance mobile devices pushes industry and researchers into more sophisticated systems to fulfill those expectations. Besides new modulation techniques and new system designs, significant improvement {{is required in}} the transceiver building blocks to handle higher data rates with reasonable power efficiency. In this research the challenges and solution to improve the performance of wireless communication transceivers is addressed. The building block that determines the efficiency and battery life of the entire mobile handset is the power amplifier. Modulations with large peak to average power ratio severely degrade efficiency in the conventional <b>fixed-biased</b> power amplifiers (PAs). To address this challenge, a novel PA is proposed with an adaptive load for the PA to improve efficiency. A nonlinearity cancellation technique is also proposed to improve linearity of the PA to satisfy the EVM and ACLR specifications. Ultra wide-band (UWB) systems are attractive due to their ability for high data rate, and low power consumption. In spite of the limitation assigned by the FCC, the coexistence of UWB and NB systems are still an unsolved challenge. One of the systems that is majorly affected by the UWB signal, is the 802. 11 a system (5 GHz Wi-Fi). A new analog solution is proposed to minimize the interference level caused by the impulse Radio UWB transmitter to nearby narrowband receivers. An efficient 400 Mpulse/s IR-UWB transmitter is implemented that generates an analog UWB pulse with in-band notch that covers {{the majority of the}} UWB spectrum. The challenge in receiver (RX) design is the over increasing out of blockers in applications such as cognitive and software defined radios, which are required to tolerate stronger out-of-band (OB) blockers. A novel RX is proposed with a shunt N-path high-Q filter at the LNA input to attenuate OB-blockers. To further improve the linearity, a novel baseband blocker filtering techniques is proposed. A new TIA has been designed to maintain the good linearity performance for blockers at large frequency offsets. As a result, a + 22 dBm IIP 3 with 3. 5 dB NF is achieved. Another challenge in the RX design is the tough NF and linearity requirements for high performance systems such as carrier aggregation. To improve the NF, an extra gain stage is added after the LNA. An N-path high-Q band-pass filter is employed at the LNA output together with baseband blocker filtering technique to attenuate out-of-band blockers and improve the linearity. A noise-cancellation technique based on the frequency translation has been employed to improve the NF. As a result, a 1. 8 dB NF with + 5 dBm IIP 3 is achieved. In addition, a new approach has been proposed to reject out of band blockers in carrier aggregation scenarios. The proposed solution also provides carrier to carrier isolation compared to typical solution for carrier aggregation...|$|R
40|$|A <b>fixed-bias</b> spherical Langmuir probe is {{included}} {{as part of}} the Vector Electric Field Instrument (VEFI) suite on the Communication Navigation Outage Forecast System (CNOFS) satellite. CNOFS gathers data in the equatorial ionosphere between 400 and 860 km, where the primary constituent ions are H+ and O+. The ion current collected by the probe surface per unit plasma density is found to be a strong function of ion composition. The calibration of the collected current to an absolute density is discussed, and the performance of the spherical probe is compared to other in situ instruments on board the CNOFS satellite. The application of the calibration is discussed with respect to future <b>fixed-bias</b> probes; in particular, it is demonstrated that some density fluctuations will be suppressed in the collected current if the plasma composition rapidly changes along with density. This is illustrated in the observation of plasma density enhancements on CNOFS...|$|E

In a pure system, the spatial variation of the order parameter (OP) of the FFLO state forms a two-dimensional lattice, and there exist two types of sub-gap quasi-particle states. Our numerical iterations indicate that an OP saddle point, and slightly less so energetically, an OP extremum favor to be pinned at the impurity site. The local density of states and the <b>fixed-bias</b> map reveal the subtle effects of an impurity on the subgap energy spectrum, because the OP changes sign in both the (relative) momentum space and the real space.

40|$|A double-probe {{electric}} field detector and two spatially separated <b>fixed-bias</b> Langmuir probes were flown on a Taurus-Tomahawk sounding rocket launched from Poker Flat Research Range in March 1982. Interesting wave data {{have been obtained}} from about 10 s of the downleg portion of the flight during which the rocket passed through the auroral electrojet. Here the {{electric field}} receiver and both density fluctuation (delta-n/n) receivers responded to a broad band of turbulence centered at 105 km-altitude and at frequencies generally below 4 kHz. Closer examination of the two delta-n/n turbulent waveforms reveals that they are correlated; from the phase {{difference between the two}} signals, the phase velocity of the waves in the rocket reference frame is inferred. The magnitude and direction of the observed phase velocity are consistent either with waves which travel at the ion sound speed or with waves which travel at the electron drift velocity. The observed phase velocity varies by about 50 percent over a 5 km altitude range, an effect which probably results from shear in the zonal neutral wind, although, unfortunately, no simultaneous neutral wind measurements exist to confirm this...|$|E

40|$|Accurate {{measurement}} of the electron density profile and its variations is crucial to further progress in understanding the physics of the disturbed equatorial ionosphere. To accomplish this, a plasma frequency probe {{was included in the}} payload complement of two rockets flown during the Condor rocket campaign conducted from Peru in March 1983. This paper presents density profiles of the disturbed equatorial ionosphere from a night-time flight in which spread-F conditions were present and from a day-time flight during strong electrojet conditions. Results from both flights are in excellent agreement with simultaneous radar data in that the regions of highly disturbed plasma coincide with the radar signatures. The spread-F rocket penetrated a topside depletion during both the upleg and downleg. The electrojet measurements showed a profile peaking at 1. 3 x 10 to the 5 th per cu cm at 106 km, with large scale fluctuations having amplitudes of roughly 10 percent seen only in the upward gradient in electron density. This is in agreement with plasma instability theory. It is further shown that simultaneous measurements by <b>fixed-bias</b> Langmuir probes, when normalized at a single point to the altitude profile of electron density, are inadequate to correctly parameterize the observed enhancements and depletions...|$|E
40|$|The modern semiclassical {{theory of}} a Bloch {{electron}} in {{a magnetic field}} now encompasses the orbital magnetic moment and the geometric phase. These two notions are encoded in the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition as a phase (λ) that is subleading in powers of the field; λ is measurable in the phase offset of the de Haas-van Alphen oscillation, {{as well as of}} <b>fixed-bias</b> oscillations of the differential conductance in tunneling spectroscopy. In some solids and for certain field orientations, λ/π are robustly integer-valued owing to the symmetry of the extremal orbit, i. e., they are the topological invariants of magnetotransport. Our comprehensive symmetry analysis identifies solids in any (magnetic) space group for which λ is a topological invariant, as well as identifies the symmetry-enforced degeneracy of Landau levels. The analysis is simplified by our formulation of ten (and only ten) symmetry classes for closed, Fermi-surface orbits. Case studies are discussed for graphene, transition metal dichalchogenides, 3 D Weyl and Dirac metals, and crystalline and Z_ 2 topological insulators. In particular, we point out that a π phase offset in the fundamental oscillation should not be viewed as a smoking gun for a 3 D Dirac metal. Comment: Update: (i) Generalized Lifshitz-Kosevich formulae (for the oscillatory magnetization and density of states) which apply also in magnetic solids. (ii) Case studies on Bi 2 Se 3 and Na 3 Bi.

40|$|Very few {{sequences}} of high resolution wind and temperature measurements {{in the lower}} thermosphere {{are available in the}} literature, which makes it difficult to verify the simulation results of models that would provide better understanding of the complex dynamics of the region. To address this problem the Turbopause experiment used four rockets launched over a period of approximately two hours from Poker Flat Research Range, Alaska (64 ° N, 147 ° W) on the night of 17 – 18 February 2009. All four rocket payloads released trimethyl aluminum trails for neutral wind and turbulence measurements, and two of the rockets carried ionization gauges and <b>fixed-bias</b> Langmuir probes measuring neutral and electron densities, small-scale fluctuations and neutral temperatures. Two lidars monitored temperature structure and sodium densities. The observations were made under quiet geomagnetic conditions and show persistence in the wind magnitudes and shears throughout the observing period while being modulated by inertia-gravity waves. High resolution temperature profiles show the winter polar mesosphere and lower thermosphere in a state of relatively low stability with several quasi-adiabatic layers between 74 and 103 km. Temperature and wind data were combined to calculate Richardson number profiles. Evidence for turbulence comes from simultaneous observations of density fluctuations and downward transport of sodium in a mixed layer near 75 km; the observation of turbulent fluctuations and energy dissipation from 87 – 90 km; and fast and irregular trail expansion at 90 – 93 km, and especially between 95 to 103 km. The regions of turbulent trails agree well with regions of quasi-adiabatic temperature gradients. Above 103 km, trail diffusion was mainly laminar; however, unusual features and vortices in the trail diffusion were observed up to 118 km that have not been as prevalent or as clearly evident in earlier trail releases...|$|E

The VEFI instrument includes a vector DC electric field detector, a <b>fixed-bias</b> Langmuir probe operating in the ion saturation regime, a flux gate magnetometer, an optical lightning detector, and associated electronics including a burst memory. Compared to data obtained during more active solar conditions, the ambient DC electric fields and their associated E x B drifts are variable and somewhat weak, typically < 1 mV/m. Although average drift directions show similarities to those previously reported, eastward/outward during day and westward/downward at night, this pattern varies significantly with longitude and is not always present. Daytime vertical drifts near the magnetic equator are largest after sunrise, with smaller average velocities after noon. Little or no pre-reversal enhancement in the vertical drift near sunset is observed, attributable to the solar minimum conditions creating a much reduced neutral dynamo at the satellite altitude. The nighttime ionosphere is characterized by larger amplitude, structured electric fields, even where the plasma density appears nearly quiescent. Data from successive orbits reveal that the vertical drifts and plasma density are both clearly organized with longitude.

The VEFI instrument includes a vector DC electric field detector, a <b>fixed-bias</b> Langmuir probe operating in the ion saturation regime, a flux gate magnetometer, an optical lightning detector, and associated electronics including a burst memory. The DC electric field detector has revealed zonal and meridional electric fields that undergo a diurnal variation, typically displaying eastward and outward-directed fields {{during the day and}} westward and downward-directed fields at night. In general, the measured DC electric field amplitudes are in the 0. 5 - 2 mV/m range, corresponding to I 3 x B drifts of the order of 30 - 150 m/s. What is surprising is the high degree of large-scale (10 's to 100 's of km) structure in the DC electric field, particularly at night, regardless of whether well-defined spread-F plasma density depletions are present.

40|$|Electric probes {{have been}} the primary {{instruments}} for the in situ investigation of plasma parameters in the Earth’s ionosphere. This dissertation is a compendium of three papers, each dealing with a separate spacecraft that carried one or more instruments based on the electric probe technique. The ﬁrst paper presents data from the Sudden Atom Layer sounding rocket that carried an RF Impedance Probe, a DC <b>ﬁxed-bias</b> Langmuir Probe (DCP), and an Electric Field Probe. The combined dataset indicates a case of payload surface charging, the causes of which are investigated within the paper. A generic circuit model is developed to analyze payload charging and behavior of Langmuir-type instruments. Our analysis indicates that the anomalous charging event was an outcome of triboelectriﬁcation of the payload surface from neutral dust particles present in the Earth’s mesosphere. These results suggest caution in interpreting observations from the Langmuir class of instrumentation within dusty environments. The second paper presents data from the Floating Potential Measurement Unit (FPMU) that is deployed on the International Space Station. The FPMU instrument suite consists of three diﬀerent Langmuir-type probes and a Plasma Impedance Probe (PIP). We ﬁrst give {{a brief overview of}} the instrumentation, and then describe the algorithm used to reduce Langmuir probe I-V curves to plasma parameters. It is shown that the derived temperatures agree well with International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) model, while the derived density matches better with the USU-Global Assimilation of Ionospheric Measurement model. The third paper presents the dataset from the EQUIS II sounding rocket campaign. The rocket payloads carried a PIP, a DCP, and an internally heated Sweeping Langmuir Probe. The ratio of the payload surface area to the cumulative area of the instrument and its guard was about 250. We show that on small sounding rocket payloads the DCP technique of relative electron density measurement is not very accurate. We further show that the ion saturation region analysis of the I-V curve produces absolute ion density that matches very well with the absolute electron density derived from the PIP, and the derived temperatures agree reasonably well with the IRI model...|$|E
40|$|The Dynamic Ionosphere Cubesat Experiment (DICE) {{mission is}} due to launch in October 2011 on a NASA rocket from Vandenburg Air Force Base. DICE was {{selected}} for flight under the NSF 2 ̆ 2 CubeSat-based Science Mission for Space Weather and Atmospheric Research 2 ̆ 2 program. Space weather refers to conditions in space (the Sun, solar wind, magnetosphere, ionosphere, or thermosphere) that can influence the performance and reliability of space-borne and ground-based technological systems. Ionospheric variability has a particularly dramatic effect on radio frequency (RF) systems; for example, large gradients in ionospheric electron density can impact communications, surveillance and navigation systems. Some of the largest gradients are found {{on the edges of}} Storm Enhanced Density (SED) features, which regularly occur over the US in the afternoon during magnetic disturbances. The DICE mission has three scientific objectives: (1) Investigate the physical processes responsible for formation of the midlatitude ionospheric Storm Enhanced Density (SED) bulge in the noon to post-noon sector during magnetic storms; (2) Investigate the physical processes responsible for the formation of the SED plume {{at the base of the}} SED bulge and the transport of the high density SED plume into the polar cap; (3) Investigate the relationship between penetration electric fields and the formation and evolution of SED. The mission consists of two identical Cubesats launched simultaneously into a near circular 600 km, nearly sun-synchronous orbit in the evening sector, precessing to earlier local times. Each satellite carries a <b>fixed-bias</b> DC Langmuir Probe (DCP) to measure in-situ ionospheric plasma densities, and an Electric Field Probe (EFP) to measure DC and AC electric fields.
