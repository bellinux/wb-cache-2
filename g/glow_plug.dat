25|$|Methanol is {{occasionally}} used to fuel {{internal combustion}} engines. Pure methanol {{is required by}} rule {{to be used in}} Champcars, Monster Trucks, USAC sprint cars (as well as midgets, modifieds, etc.), and other dirt track series, such as World of Outlaws, and Motorcycle Speedway, mainly because, {{in the event of an}} accident, methanol does not produce an opaque cloud of smoke. Since the late 1940s, Methanol is also used as the primary fuel ingredient in the powerplants for radio control, control line, free flight airplanes, cars and trucks; such engines use a platinum filament <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> that ignites the methanol vapor through a catalytic reaction. Drag racers, mud racers, and heavily modified tractor pullers also use methanol as the primary fuel source. Methanol is required with a supercharged engine in a Top Alcohol Dragster and, until the end of the 2006 season, all vehicles in the Indianapolis 500 had to run on methanol. As a fuel for mud racers, methanol mixed with gasoline and nitrous oxide produces more power than gasoline and nitrous oxide alone.|$|E
25|$|Traditional {{spark plugs}} {{need to be}} {{indented}} into {{the walls of the}} combustion chamber to enable the apex of the rotor to sweep past. As the rotor's apex seals pass over the spark plug hole, a small amount of compressed charge can be lost from the charge chamber to the exhaust chamber, entailing fuel in the exhaust, reducing efficiency, and resulting in higher emissions. These points may be overcome by using laser ignition, eliminating traditional spark plugs and removing the narrow slit in the motor housing so the rotor apex seals can fully sweep with no loss of compression from adjacent chambers. This concept has a precedent in the <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> used by Toyota (SAE paper 790435), and the SAE paper 930680, by D. Hixon et al., on 'Catalytic Glow Plugs in the JDTI Stratified Charge Rotary Engine'. The laser plug can fire its spark through the narrow slit. Laser spark plugs can also fire deep into the combustion chamber using multiple sparks. Direct fuel injection, to which the Wankel engine is suited, combined with laser ignition in single or multiple laser plugs, has been shown to enhance the motor even further reducing the disadvantages.|$|E
25|$|Land Rover's radically updated {{product line}} was {{launched}} in 1983. Initially only the long-wheelbase One Ten was available and it was sold with the same engine line-up as the preceding Series III model- 2.25-litre petrol and diesel engines and the 3.5-litre Rover V8. However, Land Rover planned a series of rolling improvements. Launched shortly before the short-wheelbase Ninety model in 1984 was a 2.5-litre diesel engine. This {{was little more than}} an updated version of the existing diesel unit (at this time 22 years old). The stroke was lengthened to improve torque, and an updated cylinder head was used to reduce noise and emissions. A more modern injector pump improved fuel economy and an improved <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> system improved cold-starting performance. The most significant change was the swapping of the chain-driven camshaft for one driven by a fibre toothed belt, which also drove the repositioned injector pump. The drive vacated by the injector pump was used to power a vacuum pump for the brake servo system. To reduce engine weight, extensive use of aluminium castings was made for the cambelt case, vacuum pump, rocker cover and other parts. Other small improvements were made such as the fitment of a spin-on cartridge oil filter instead of older, harder-to-change element type and the fitting of under-piston oil jets. In the mid-1980s Land Rover was part of the Land Rover Group, responsible for production of the Freight Rover van. The 2.5-litre diesel was fitted to the Freight Rover 300-series and the FX4 taxi (the engines for these applications had slight design changes, such as higher-mounted injector pumps and non-waterproof cambelt cases. They received the designations 14J and 15J respectively. Being fitted with a timing belt rather than a chain the 15J engine suffered none of the reliability problems in the FX4 that its 10J predecessor had encountered (see above)). The engine became a special-order only option after the introduction of turbodiesel engines (see below) but remained in production (and popular with military and some commercial buyers) until 1994. The British Army used this engine {{in the vast majority of}} the 20,000 Land Rovers it bought between 1985 and 1994. A manufacturing flaw with pistons combined with Army maintenance practises (such as a tendency to over-fill the sump with oil) caused the engines to over-breathe and ingest their oil, leading to piston failure. Late military-spec engines had a centrifugal separator in the breather system, allowing excess oil to drain back to the sump. These engines were designated 13J. and 11J (ref Land Rover Defender Military 110 1991 Supplementary Parts Catalogue). These later, modified engines were the first in their class (small capacity high-speed diesels) to pass the Ministry of Defence's arduous 500-hour durability trial.|$|E

2500|$|The RASCAL was {{powered by}} a XLR67-BA-1 rocket engine also {{developed}} by Bell. The XLR-67 provided [...] of thrust using three vertical in-line thrust chambers. All three thrust chambers of the XLR67 were operated during the missile's boost phase which could last up to two minutes. At {{the conclusion of the}} boost phase the upper and lower chambers of the XLR-67 were shut down and thrust was sustained by the center chamber alone. Fuel for the XLR-67 included [...] of white fuming nitric acid oxidizer and [...] of JP-4 jet fuel. The oxidizer was stored in a series of tube bundles instead of a spherical storage tank. It is believed this configuration was chosen because it weighed less than a spherical tank of the same volume. Propellant was provided to the thrust chambers by a turbine driven propellant pump. A gas generator powered the propellant pump. The propellants were <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> ignited. Bell contracted with Purdue University for the <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> ignition system. Aerojet provided the pump drive assemblies.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} multi-cylinder 4-stroke model engines have been commercially {{available}} in a radial configuration, beginning with the Japanese O.S. Max firm's FR5-300 five-cylinder, 3.0 cu.in. (50cm3) displacement [...] "Sirius" [...] radial in 1986. The American [...] "Technopower" [...] firm had made smaller-displacement five- and seven-cylinder model radial engines as early as 1976, but the OS firm's engine was the first mass-produced radial engine design in aeromodelling history. [...] The rival Saito Seisakusho firm in Japan has since produced a similarly sized five-cylinder radial four-stroke model engine of their own as a direct rival to the OS design, with Saito also creating a trio of three-cylinder radial engines ranging from 0.90 cu.in. (15cm3) to 4.50 cu.in. (75cm3) in displacement, also all now available in spark-ignition format up to 84cm3 displacement for use with gasoline. The German Seidel firm formerly made both seven- and nine-cylinder [...] "large" [...] (starting at 35cm3 displacement) radio control model radial engines, mostly for <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> ignition, with an experimental fourteen-cylinder twin-row radial being tried out - the American Evolution firm now sells the Seidel-designed radials, with their manufacturing being done in India.|$|E

50|$|A <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> engine, or glow engine, {{is a type}} {{of small}} {{internal}} combustion engine typically used in model aircraft, model cars and similar applications.

5000|$|A <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> engine must be {{operated}} {{with the correct}} <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> temperature. Large engines can operate with lower temperatures, while smaller engines radiate heat to the air more quickly and require a hotter <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> to maintain the correct temperature for ignition. The ambient temperature also dictates the best <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> temperature; in cold weather, hotter plugs are needed. Since <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> engines are air-cooled, an engine that [...] "runs hot" [...] can sometimes benefit from a lower plug temperature, although this may cause rougher idling and difficulty in tuning. The operating speed of the engine must also be considered; if the engine is to run at consistently high RPM, such as with an airplane or a car on a mostly straight track, a lower plug temperature is more efficient. If the engine is to operate at lower RPM, combustion will not heat the engine as much, and a hotter plug is required.|$|E

5000|$|In older {{generation}} diesel-engine vehicles, unlike in a gasoline-engine vehicle, for a 'cold start' the operator did not simply turn {{the key to}} the [...] "start" [...] position and have the engine immediately start. Instead, the operator activated the <b>glow</b> <b>plug(s)</b> for a time first. Early diesels used the 'Thermostart' type glowplug in the inlet manifold. These take 20 seconds to achieve working temperature and the vehicle operator had to manually time (or guess) when the 20 seconds had elapsed. With in-cylinder <b>glow</b> <b>plugs,</b> technological improvements included a warning light on the dash to indicate how long the preheating should last. The preheating phase was also made to be automatically activated when the operator turned {{the key to the}} [...] "on" [...] position for a long duration; the glowplug relay switches the glowplugs on, and a light (see picture at right) on the instrument cluster illuminates. This process is called [...] "pre-heating" [...] or [...] "glowing". Many modern diesels automatically activate their <b>glow</b> <b>plugs</b> when the operator unlocks the vehicle or opens the door to the car, thus simplifying the process and shortening the time the operator has to wait before the engine will start. According to Bosch: [...] "Older engines with Thermostart manifold <b>plugs</b> used a <b>glow</b> period of up to 20 seconds whereas more modern engines use around a 6 to 8 second heat period and provide after glow at a reduced voltage." ...|$|R
50|$|When starting, the <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> is {{electrically}} preheated by electric current. The <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> {{is not to}} {{be confused}} with a spark plug - there is no spark in the <b>glow</b> <b>plug.</b> Catalysis from methanol vapor on the heated platinum element keeps it red-hot even after voltage has been removed, which ignites the fuel and keeps the engine running. Whereas spark plugs are constantly used to ignite the fuel/air mix every time the piston comes up, as seen in the petrol engine where the spark plug is used, the fuel cannot be ignited with compression alone. It is the plug's temperature, still red-hot from previous ignition and from catalysis with the new compressed mixture, that ignites the fuel.|$|E
50|$|The {{glow plugs}} used in model engines are {{significantly}} different from those used in full-size diesel engines. In full-size engines, the <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> is used only for starting. In model engines, the <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> {{is an integral part}} of the ignition system because of the catalytic effect of the platinum wire. The <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> is a durable, mostly platinum, helical wire filament recessed into the plug's tip. When an electric current runs through the plug, or when exposed to the heat of the combustion chamber, the filament glows, enabling it to help ignite the special fuel used by these engines. Power can be applied using a special connector attaching to the outside of the engine, and may use a rechargeable battery or DC power source.|$|E
5000|$|The Cox [...]049 Engine is a 2-stroke {{internal}} combustion <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> engine. These engines use a <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> {{to heat the}} fuel/air within the cylinder to start. Once running it is disconnected and operates {{in the same manner}} as a diesel engine. The self ignition is due to the heat produced from the compression of the air/fuel mix, and the catalytic reaction of the platinum element in the <b>glow</b> <b>plug</b> and the methanol in the fuel and does not depend in any way upon the continued use of the battery. Fuel intake to the engine is controlled by a simple needle valve and venturi system. Fuel/air mixture intake to the crankcase is controlled via a reed valve or rotary valve depending on the engine design.|$|E
