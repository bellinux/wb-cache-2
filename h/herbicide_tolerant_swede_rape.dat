These crops, which enhance weed control options and greatly expand market demand for some herbicides, have been readily adopted by farmers in the United States and Canada.

Screening of 300 diverse chickpea genotypes (278 accessions from the reference set and 22 breeding lines) revealed large genetic variations for tolerance to herbicides imazethapyr and metribuzin.

40|$|Herbicide {{resistance}} is an innate characteristic of crop plants. It {{enables them to}} survive and propagate even {{in the presence of}} lethal doses of herbicides in the surroundings. Genetic tolerance in crops towards herbicides may have several benefits. It may increases safety margins between weed and crop sensitivity and also expands applicability of a particular herbicide. Besides, it can also lower the operating cost for weed control as compared to manual weeding and crop rotation which is normally prohibited by herbicide persistence. Herbicide resistant crops are developed through transformation of a plant with either native or mutant resistant genes, seed mutagenesis, plant cell or tissue culture and through other traditional plant breeding techniques. Seed mutagenesis is a non-transgenic approach, which is found to be most economical and perfect approach. Moreover, all commercial <b>herbicide</b> <b>tolerant</b> crops were derived from single nucleotide substitution of genes and trait can be incorporated into elite varieties because of incomplete dominance and non-pleiotropic effect of the alleles of all commercial <b>herbicide</b> <b>tolerant</b> mutations...|$|R

30|$|Of {{the various}} herbicides, imidazolinones {{are the most}} widely {{targeted}} ones for developing <b>herbicide</b> <b>tolerant</b> crops through non-GM approach. Imidazolinones act by disrupting Acetolactate Synthase (ALS), and/or Acetohydroxy Acid Synthase (AHAS), enzymes involved in branched chain amino acid (valine, leucine and isolecine) biosynthesis (Singh and Shaner, 1995). Nucleotide and amino acid sequences of AHAS and mutations causing tolerance against imidazolinones are well characterized in Arabidopsis (Sathasivan et al. 1990 and 1991). Mutations in AHAS gene is reported to confer resistance to five groups of herbicides, namely, imidazolinones (Shaner et al. 1984), sulfonylurea (Chaleff and Mauvais, 1984), pyrimidinyl thiobenzoates (Stidham, 1991), triazolopyrimidine and sulfonylaminocarbonyltriazolinones (Gerwick et al. 1990). Although ALS/AHAS mutants tolerant to imidazolinone compounds have been developed in rice, wheat, sunflower, canola and maize (Tan et al. 2005), they are all protected by patents (Croughan 1998, 2002; Livore 2003; Livore et al. 2011).

With {{more than a}} decade of use, the actual farm-level environmental impact of HT canola can be evaluated. This article reports on a spring 2007 survey of nearly 600 canola farmers in the three prairie provinces of Western Canada. Producers were asked about their crop production experiences for 2005 and 2006 and expected crop planting for 2007. A reduction in the total number of chemical applications over the 3 -year period was reported, resulting in a decrease of herbicide active ingredient being applied to farmland in Western Canada of nearly 1. 3 million kg annually. Fewer tillage passes over the survey period were reported, improving moisture conservation, decreasing soil erosion and contributing to carbon sequestration in annual cropland. An estimated 1 million tonnes of carbon is either sequestered or no longer released under land management facilitated by HT canola production, as compared to 1995.
