25|$|The {{following}} year, Mickelson captured {{his second}} major at the 2005 PGA Championship at Baltusrol, in a Monday final-round conclusion {{that had been}} forced by inclement weather the previous day. On the 18th hole, Mickelson hit one of his trademark soft pitches from deep greenside rough to within a <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> (0.45 m) of the cup, and made his birdie to finish at a 4-under-par total of 276, one shot ahead of Steve Elkington and Thomas Bjørn.|$|E
25|$|In 1992 Lowe was {{commissioned}} by the Minnesota Arts Commission for Cloquet Community College. The sculpture sits within a large grouping of pine trees, made of polished stainless steel it hovers a <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> above the ground, intertwining through the trees like a stream. Utilized as a bench, large rocks are also placed underneath from nearby riverbeds to be glimpsed at under thin slits cut into the steel to represent the flowing of the water.|$|E
25|$|Telescopic {{fishing rods}} are {{designed}} to collapse down to a short length and open to a long rod. 20 or even 30ft rods can close to {{as little as a}} <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half.</b> This makes the rods very easy to transport to remote areas or travel on buses, compact cars, or public buses and subways. Telescopic fishing rods are made from the same materials as conventional multi-piece rods. Graphite, carbon, and sometimes fibreglass, or composites of these materials, {{are designed to}} slip into each other so that they open and close. The eyes on the spinning rods are generally, but not always, a special design to aid in making the end of each section stronger. Various grade eyes available in conventional rods are also available in telescopic fishing rods. The eyeless Tenkara style rods are also of this type and are typically made from carbon and/or graphite.|$|E

60|$|The {{troops had}} {{proceeded}} but {{a short distance}} before they had reason to congratulate themselves on their retreat before the rains began in earnest, and to rejoice {{over the fact that}} the thunderstorms did not set in three days earlier than they did. The marsh round the town had increased a foot in depth, while the next stream, before <b>a</b> rivulet two <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> deep, had now swollen its banks for <b>a</b> hundred <b>and</b> fifty yards on either side, with over five <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> of water in the old channel.|$|R
500|$|Shane Rangi as Asterius the Minotaur and Josh Campbell as {{the voice}} of Asterius. An elderly minotaur who aids Caspian. He is killed during the raid while holding the gate open to allow some of the army to escape. Rangi also stood in for Aslan, the Bulgy Bear, the Werewolf, another Minotaur, and the Wild Bear on set. Rangi played General Otmin in the {{previous}} film and Tavros in The Voyage of The Dawn Treader. He was able to see more in the redesigned animatronic minotaur heads, though [...] "in order to make the eye line straight and correct, you've actually got to hold your head down, so your view is only about a <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> in front of you, which still makes it a little bit hard". This resulted in Rangi knocking himself against the rising gate of the Telmarine castle, although he was fine and it was the animatronic head that bore the brunt of the damage. The costumes were still very hot, reducing him to a [...] "walking waterfall". Although a head sculpt of Aslan was used to stand in for the character on the first film, Rangi had to portray the character on set because Lucy interacts with him more. Rangi lost four kilograms wearing all his costumes.|$|E
500|$|St Stephen's Chapel {{remained}} largely unchanged until 1692 when Sir Christopher Wren, {{at the time}} the Master of the King's Works, was instructed to make structural alterations. He lowered the roof, removed the stained glass windows, put in a new floor and covered the original gothic architecture with wood panelling. He also added galleries from which the public could watch proceedings. The result was described by one visitor to the chamber as [...] "dark, gloomy, and badly ventilated, and so small... when an important debate occurred... the members were really to be pitied". When the future Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone remembered his arrival as a new MP in 1832, he recounted [...] "What I may term corporeal conveniences were... marvellously small. I do not think that in any part of the building it afforded the means of so much as washing the hands." [...] The facilities were so poor that, in debates in 1831 and 1834, Joseph Hume, a Radical MP, called for new accommodation for the House, while his fellow MP William Cobbett asked [...] "Why are we squeezed into so small a space that it is absolutely impossible that there should be calm and regular discussion, even from circumstance alone... Why are 658 of us crammed into a space that allows each of us no more than a <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> square?" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The President, {{who was a}} <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> {{taller and}} a hundred pounds heavier than George, struck him a resounding clap {{on the back and}} caught his hand in an immense fist. Wrenching George's arm up and down with a pumping motion that might have drawn oil from a dry Texas well, Johnson congratulated him on the briefing, and on his {{services}} to the country and its voters. As he released George, he said, 'Anytime {{you want to talk to}} me, just pick up the phone and come over.' It was a vintage LBJ performance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'A first-rate galloper, small-hoofed, {{five feet}} high; [...] tail three <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> long; cheek {{pieces of the}} bit of [...] twenty-three carat gold; shoes silver?' said Zadig.|$|R
6000|$|... "And how big was the box?" [...] asked Sweet Fern. [...] "Why, perhaps {{three feet}} long," [...] said Eustace, [...] "two <b>feet</b> wide, <b>and</b> two <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> high." ...|$|R
60|$|While Kwaque obeyed, {{the mate}} sounded the {{well for the}} last time, {{reporting}} three <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half,</b> <b>and</b> the lighter freightage of the starboard boat was tossed in by the sailors.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the middle}} of the room is placed a vessel of about a <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> high which is called here a [...] "baquet". It is so large that twenty people can easily sit round it; near the edge of the lid which covers it, there are holes pierced [...] {{corresponding}} to the number of persons who are to surround it; into these holes are introduced iron rods, bent at right angles outwards, and of different heights, so as to answer to the part of the body to which they are to be applied. Besides [...] these rods, there is a rope which communicates between the baquet and one of the patients, and from him is carried to another, and so on the whole round. [...] The most sensible effects are produced on the approach of Mesmer, who is said to convey the fluid by certain motions of his hands or eyes, without touching the person. I have talked with several who have witnessed these effects, who have convulsions occasioned and removed by a movement of the hand...|$|E
2500|$|Technological {{developments}} such as crude ceramics {{were developed}} by Archaic societies early during the late Holocene. A total of 792 shards of pottery were found at Indian Knoll. All of which were shell or grit tempered, [...] mainly found within the first <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> of the mound, and closely relate to the later Mississippian culture's pottery. Most vessels had wide mouths and curved or flat bases, which were handmade by building up coils of clay. Pottery contributed to the exploitation and manipulation of wild plants, and more efficiency in food processing and water storage. The {{most common type of}} ceramics were shell tempered, representing 78.5% of the total pottery shards found at Indian Knoll, with only 171 grit tempered shards of bowls or jars discovered. Heavy grit tempered pottery appeared in different regions of the Eastern Woodlands, including Ohio Valley, between 2000-500 BC. The grit tempered ceramics that were found show plain and cord marked ware, as well as simple stamped grooved patterns. Several different finishes on shell tempered ceramics were also noted. [...] Nine shards found in one were also cord marked, or tapped with a twisted fibers wrapped [...] paddle, and three shards show signs of roughening, which were individually created by a rectangular object. Other shards show signs of net impressions caused by [...] mesh fabrics, which is common in much of western Kentucky.|$|E
2500|$|Hirsh {{had good}} leverage, pitched down to hitters, {{and had a}} refined {{repertoire}} of pitches. [...] He had a [...] "plus" [...] 2-seam fastball that had sink and good movement at 91–94mph, and threw a [...] "filthy" [...] hard-breaking slider that was consistently precise, and had bite at 80–86mph (managers rated it the best breaking ball in the Texas League). [...] Hirsh continued to refine his moderate changeup, which had fair deception and movement in the low-80s. [...] He also threw a 4-seam fastball in the 94–96mph range. [...] He was not afraid to pitch inside, and threw strikes to {{both sides of the}} plate. [...] "I'm 6-foot-8 and I keep a high three-quarters arm angle," [...] noted Hirsh. [...] "You figure the mound is a <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half,</b> and my arm may be another two, three, four feet. [...] It makes the batter have to look up instead of straight at me, and he may have a difficult time adjusting." [...] During the 2007 season, Hirsh had trouble throwing his fastball enough. Pitching coach Bob Apodaca gave this assessment of Hirsh before 2008: [...] "All Jason has to do is trust his stuff. [...] He has the type of fastball you work off, but he was using his fastball the way you'd use an off-speed pitch —- to try and trick hitters." ...|$|E
5000|$|..... {{a little}} squat, uncourtly figure ... about four <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> {{perpendicular}} height, with a breadth of back, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> sesquipedality of belly, {{which might have}} done honour to a serjeant in the horse-guards." ...|$|R
60|$|Here {{again we}} have a most curious {{instance}} of the subtlety of eye which was not satisfied without a third dimension, but could be satisfied with a difference of an inch on three <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... [p.237] Shaykh's {{arms are}} <b>a</b> sword <b>and</b> <b>a</b> matchlock slung behind his back; {{in his right}} hand he carries a short javelin[FN#25] or a light crooked stick, about two <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> long, called <b>a</b> Mas'hab,[FN#26] used for guiding camels.|$|R

60|$|Ike Watson halted in perplexity for fully a minute. Then he {{dismounted}} and {{waded into}} the stream, which was scarcely a foot to a <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> in depth.|$|E
60|$|In the {{meantime}} Captain Langless whispered {{to one of}} his sailors, and the tar ran to one of the staterooms and returned with an old-fashioned seven-shooter, fully a <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> long.|$|E
60|$|In this half-circle I pitched {{two rows}} of strong stakes, driving them into the ground till they stood very firm like piles, the biggest end being {{out of the ground}} about five <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>and</b> {{sharpened}} on the top. The two rows did not stand above six inches from one another.|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{are long}} and narrow, and in shape very much {{resemble}} a New England whale-boat; the larger sort seem to be built chiefly for war, and will carry from forty to eighty or a hundred armed men. We measured one which lay ashore at Tolago. She was sixty-eight <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> long, five <b>feet</b> broad, <b>and</b> three <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> deep. The bottom was sharp, with straight sides like <b>a</b> wedge, <b>and</b> consisted of three lengths hollowed out to about two inches, or <b>an</b> inch <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> thick, <b>and</b> well fastened together with strong plaiting. Each side consisted of one entire plank sixty-three feet long, ten or twelve inches broad, <b>and</b> about <b>an</b> inch <b>and</b> <b>a</b> quarter thick, <b>and</b> these were fitted and lashed to the bottom part with great dexterity <b>and</b> strength. <b>A</b> considerable number of thwarts were laid from gunwale to gunwale, {{to which they were}} securely lashed on each side, as a strengthening to the boat. The ornament at the head projected five or six feet beyond the body, and was about four <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> high. The ornament at the stern was fixed upon that end as the stern-post of a ship is fixed upon its keel, and was about fourteen feet high, two <b>feet</b> broad, <b>and</b> <b>an</b> inch <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> thick. They both consisted of boards of carved work, of which the design was much better than the execution." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir, she is down {{nearly two}} <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half.</b> I {{reported}} {{to you that}} we gained {{a considerable amount of}} booty at Astropalaia, and of course we have added gradually to that, but never had anything like so good a haul. The hold up {{to the level of the}} main deck is full." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{snow had}} ceased to come down. It covered the ground to the depth of a <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> on the level and Jed said {{it was just the}} right kind of weather for deer.|$|E
60|$|Again {{he tried}} to raise himself, and by a mighty effort got up a {{distance}} of a <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half.</b> But {{that seemed to be}} the limit and, utterly exhausted, he dropped back, gasping for breath.|$|E
60|$|Rollo and Nathan {{held the}} cord, {{stretched}} from corner to corner, just along {{the surface of}} the snow, while Oliver, with the shovel, cut the snow square down to the ground, more than a <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> deep.|$|E
60|$|Snap was right, {{and it was}} no mean task {{to bring}} the fish to the shore, and even then it flopped around in a manner that scared them a little. The maskalonge was dark gray in color with small black spots, and {{measured}} all of four <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> from head to tail.|$|R
5000|$|We shall {{mount the}} steep ascent towards Belstone Tor, <b>and</b> within <b>a</b> {{quarter of a}} mile, on its western slope, we shall observe the circle called in the {{neighbourhood}} Nine Stones, but which in reality consists of seventeen stones, erect, the highest of which is not more than two <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> from the ground.|$|R
60|$|He was right. The {{work now}} went on undisturbed, {{and at the}} end of a {{fortnight}} the schooner was laden. All the hatches had been closed and made water-tight; and so full was she that her deck was only two <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> above the water, although her guns had been thrown overboard or landed.|$|R
60|$|He {{took two}} of our large mats and sewed them together, and they made {{a kind of a}} bag four feet broad, three feet and a half high, and about a <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> thick when it was full.|$|E
60|$|By {{night the}} ice had been chopped {{away to the}} depth of a <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> {{the entire length of}} the vessel. Then the wind, which had been blowing {{strongly}} from one direction, shifted to another, and the pressure on the vessel let up a little.|$|E
6000|$|... "In a kind {{of white}} robe cut rather low, with her hair loose hanging to her waist, but {{carefully}} combed and held outspread by {{what appeared to be}} a bent piece of ivory about a <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> long, to which it was fastened by a thread of gold." ...|$|E
6000|$|To the {{rendering}} [...] "circular" [...] it is objected that {{a circular}} shield of, say, four <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> in diameter, would be intolerably heavy and superfluously wide, while the shields represented in Mycenaean art are not circles, but rather resemble {{a figure of}} eight, in some cases, or a section of a cylinder, in others, or, again, a door (Fig. 5, p. 130).|$|R
50|$|And be it {{remembered that}} the iron yard of our Lord the King containeth 3 <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> no more, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>foot</b> ought to contain 12 inches by the right measure of this yard {{measured}}, to wit, the 36th part of this yard rightly measured maketh 1 inch neither more nor less and 5 yards <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> make <b>a</b> perch that is 16 <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> measured by the aforesaid yard of our Lord the King.|$|R
5000|$|They had {{likewise}} {{two other}} javelins, {{the largest of}} which was composed of <b>a</b> staff five <b>feet</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> long <b>and</b> <b>a</b> triangular head of iron nine inches mm long. This was formerly called the pilum, {{but now it is}} known by the name of spiculum.
