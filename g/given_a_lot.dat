5|$|The most wide-reaching {{psychological}} {{weapon was}} {{the radio station}} Voice of Liberation. It began broadcasting on 1 May 1954, carrying anti-communist propaganda, telling its listeners to resist the Árbenz government and support the liberating forces of Castillo Armas. The station claimed to be broadcasting from deep within the jungles of the Guatemalan hinterland, a message which many listeners believed. In actuality, the broadcasts were concocted in Miami by Guatemalan exiles, flown to Central America, and broadcast through a mobile transmitter. The Voice of Liberation made an initial broadcast that was repeated four times, after which it took to transmitting two-hour bulletins twice a day. The transmissions were initially only heard intermittently in Guatemala City; a week later, the CIA significantly increased their transmitting power, allowing clear reception in the Guatemalan capital. The radio broadcasts have been <b>given</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of credit by historians {{for the success of}} the coup, due to the unrest they created throughout the country. They were unexpectedly assisted by the outage of the government-run radio station, which stopped transmitting for three weeks while a new antenna was being fitted. These transmissions continued throughout the conflict, broadcasting exaggerated news of rebel troops converging on the capital, and contributing to massive demoralization among both the army and the civilian population.|$|E

25|$|In 1957, I Love Lucy was re-tailored into {{an hour-long}} show {{originally}} titled The Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show {{that was to}} be part of an anthology series called the Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse. The hour-long Lucy-Desi show was to alternate on a monthly basis with other hour long Playhouse shows. The new series put a much heavier emphasis on big name guest stars as being part of the plot and although the Mertz characters continued into the new series, their roles became somewhat diminished. Although a lighter workload was welcomed by Frawley, Vance came to somewhat resent the change. Arnaz, in an effort to please Vance, for whom he had much respect, proposed doing a spin-off from I Love Lucy called The Mertzes. Seeing a lucrative opportunity and the chance to star in his own show, Frawley was enthused. Vance, however, declined for a number of reasons, the biggest factor being that she felt she and Frawley could barely work together on the ensemble show they were doing at the time, so it would be much less likely the two could work together on their own series. Vance also felt that the Mertz characters would not be as successful without the Ricardos to play-off each other, and despite being her biggest success, she was becoming interested in playing more glamorous roles rather than Ethel. In fact, during the thirteen-episode run of the Lucy-Desi hour-long shows, Vance was <b>given</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more latitude to look more attractive as Ethel Mertz, something she was denied during the run of the I Love Lucy episodes. Frawley's resentment of Vance intensified after she declined to do the spin-off show and the two rarely talked to each other outside of their characters' dialogue with one another.|$|E

500|$|Atlus's senior {{project manager}} Masaru Nanba commented {{it was decided}} that [...] "Shin Megami Tensei" [...] was to be kept in the title of Persona 3 and Persona 4, as it was {{believed}} that {{they were part of the}} same series as however, the [...] "Shin Megami Tensei" [...] title was omitted from both Persona 4 Golden and Persona 4 Arena, as it would have been much too long. Similarly, Persona 4: The Ultimate in Mayonaka Arena and Persona 4: The Golden were shortened to the previously stated titles. As with Persona 3, the honorifics used in the Japanese voice track were retained in the English dub, despite proving contentions among series fans. This was done as part of an intended trend to remain faithful to the original source material. The pronunciations of honorifics, along with the sounds of names, were a point that was carefully considered by the localization team and it took a while for the English cast to get used to them. A member of the English dub that also appeared in Persona 3 was Yuri Lowenthal. Though he had dubbed characters in Persona 3, Namba wanted him to have a larger part. His role as Yosuke ended up featuring 1000 more lines of dialogue than the other major characters. Important roles for the localization team were Teddie and Rise, as they would be the party's supports. Another element in the English script was that the use of swear words was increased over Persona 3: the first draft featured very strong language which was cut as it did not seem suited. The character Kanji was <b>given</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of swearing in his dialogue, due to his volatile nature. The use of swearing was carefully considered depending on the emotional situation.|$|E

500|$|In 2013, Miyazaki {{stated that}} Howl's Moving Castle was his {{favorite}} creation, and explained his choice by saying [...] "I wanted to convey the message that life is worth living, and I don't think that's changed." [...] In the film, Sophie is shown to overcome extreme challenges by learning to put the well-being of those she cares about above her own self-interest, a quality which Miyazaki refers to as devotion. Several of the protagonists in Miyazaki's films, such as Ashitaka and San in Princess Mononoke and Sheeta and Pazu in Castle in the Sky learn to survive by learning the same lesson. Cavallaro states that Miyazaki spreads this moral through the entire film, to convey human beings' ability to be compassionate, such as when the scarecrow holds an umbrella over Sophie's head when it rains. Over {{the course of the}} film, Howl, its most vain and selfish character, also learns to put others before himself. When Madame Suliman returns the Witch of the Waste to her true form as a decrepit old woman, Sophie takes her in and cares for her, despite the witch being responsible for Sophie's curse, thus strongly demonstrating the idea of compassion. The witch then nearly destroys Howl through her selfish behavior, but also helps save the castle at the end. Parsons writes that [...] "In Miyazaki's balancing act, old women can be powerful and weak, positive and negative, nurturing and selfish, maligned and loved; in short, they can not be simply categorized or stereotyped, and they can not be dismissed as fantasy malefactors embodied by evil witches." [...] They are also <b>given</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of space in the film as active characters, something not commonly found in western movies.|$|E

Spirit Detective was officially announced by Atari in August 2003. The game was released in North America on December 9, 2003 and in Europe on April 1, 2005.

2500|$|Abo {{noted that}} {{while all the}} games are part of one series, their sound have {{different}} images; comparing them to weather, he called Chaos;Head rainy, Steins;Gate cloudy, Robotics;Notes clear weather, and Chaos;Child stormy. He used the same process {{for all of them}} when composing the music: he started by reading the story, to understand the setting and characters as well as possible, and writing down notes about the games' emotional flow and the situations that occur throughout the stories. Using these notes, he constructed musical worldviews for the games, with a lot of weight on his first impressions. This approach, while slower than just designating songs to different areas of a game, allowed him to compose higher-quality songs with a better relationship to the games' worldviews. He was <b>given</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of freedom when working on the series, and was able to make the music he wanted to make for it, something he enjoyed greatly.

2500|$|In {{the middle}} of the 2010/11 Ashes series between Australia and England, Katich injured his Achilles tendon and was ruled out for the {{remainder}} of the series. In mid-2011 the Cricket Australia Selection Panel did not grant Katich a new international contract despite Katich being one of the most consistent batsmen in the team. At the time he was dropped, Katich had an average as an opening batsman of 50.48 runs. The selectors claimed that they were planning for the future but Katich has claimed that new Australian captain, Michael Clarke, was behind his test axing due to a scuffle in the SCG dressing rooms after a Test match between Clarke and Katich. Former Test Cricket Bowler, Brett Lee claimed in his autobiography that [...] "If you don't get on with Katich, you're a pretty ordinary bloke." [...] Katich was <b>given</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of support following his axing and he said at the start of the 2011/12 Sheffield Shield season that he would score 1,000 runs in the season.

2500|$|Her {{marriage}} was distant and {{both she and}} her spouse had extramarital affairs. Charles {{paid more attention to}} his lovers than to her: {{at the time of their}} marriage, he was in the middle of his relationship with Augusta von Fersen. Her intimate friendship with countess Sophie von Fersen inspired rumors of bisexuality which, true or not, were repeated throughout her time as royal Duchess, by both Francisco de Miranda in 1786 and later by Frederica of Baden. From 1783, she had a long term relationship with Count Carl Piper, whom she herself referred to as her lover in her secret correspondence to Sophie von Fersen. Among her alleged lovers was Count Axel von Fersen, alleged lover of Marie Antoinette. It is not known when her affair with Axel von Fersen occurred, it is only known that she wished to resume it when Fersen returned to Sweden after the death of Marie Antoinette and that Fersen refused to do so. It has been suggested that this was merely a temporary affair which occurred during the stay of the royal court at Gripsholm Castle in the summer of 1784. She also had a relationship with Axel von Fersen's younger brother, Count Fabian von Fersen [...] Her affair with Fabian von Fersen is assumed to have started in the late 1780s was discontinued with the marriage of von Fersen in 1797. It was rumored at the time that the pregnancy which ended in a miscarriage in 1792 (which was referred by Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte as her first real pregnancy) was caused by Fabian von Fersen. The rumors of her extramarital affairs were <b>given</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of attention during her second pregnancy in 1797, who produced a stillborn daughter. The next year (1798) she gave birth a son who lived only six days. Ultimately, she was unable to have living children.|$|E
