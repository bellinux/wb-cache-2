500|$|At first <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{going to}} work on one song; that was the {{original}} plan. Let's try to work on one song and take it from there -- not spend too much time thinking about the legend, and do something that just makes sense. [...] We did one song and another song, and we were having fun making music. And actually it was a very privileged time.

500|$|BBC drama bosses {{worked on}} {{introducing}} an Asian family, {{who would be}} central to the show, {{for a couple of}} years. Berridge commented on the casting: [...] "After a search which has taken more than two years, and in which we have met literally hundreds of people, we have finally found the perfect cast for our dynamic new family. We're delighted to welcome the Ferreiras to Albert Square and I'm sure the viewers will be too." [...] Berridge also claimed the show didn't set out to look for an Asian family, saying: [...] "We wanted a new family as there were various elements missing from the show. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> short on males and needed a surge of testosterone," [...] and said that the characters were formed around the actors: [...] "We didn't set out knowing exactly what we wanted. We workshopped constantly, trying out different improvisations with the actors and the characters evolved." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{first week}} of {{recording}} produced [...] "Go", [...] "Blood", [...] "Rats", and [...] "Leash" [...] before the band hit a lull. In order to keep up his intensity, Vedder traveled into San Francisco and began sleeping in his truck, {{as well as the}} sauna at the recording studio. Bassist Jeff Ament said, [...] "Recording Vs., {{there was a lot more}} pressure on Ed. The whole follow-up. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> playing so well as a band that it would take care of itself... He was having a hard time finishing up the songs; the pressure, and not being comfortable being in such a nice place." [...] Ament added that [...] "toward the end it got fairly intense" [...] and that the band [...] "tried to make it as uncomfortable for [...] as we could." [...] Eventually the band was able to get [...] "back on track" [...] according to Ament as Vedder was allowed [...] "to get in the space of his songs." [...] The album was finished in May 1993. Vedder later said, [...] "The second record, that was the one I enjoyed making the least... I just didn't feel comfortable in the place we were at because it was very comfortable. I didn't like that at all." ...|$|E
500|$|Television critics {{reacted with}} mixed {{reaction}} toward the episode, with one critic calling the storyline [...] "pretty dull." [...] In a simultaneous {{review of the}} episodes of American Dad!, The Simpsons and Bob's Burgers that preceded the show, and the episode of The Cleveland Show that followed it, The A.V. Clubs Rowan Kaiser wrote, [...] "I don't {{have much to say}} about tonight's Family Guy. Last week, we had some comments about how Family Guy seems to be willing to play with its format this season. That didn't happen this week at all." [...] Kaiser went on to criticize the flashback involving Lois and Joyce in high school, stating, [...] "Having a previously unknown flashback as the big reveal feels like cheating, if you're inclined to view Family Guy as consistent." [...] He concluded his review by praising [...] "the burning bush" [...] joke, and ultimately gave the episode a C- rating, the worst rating of the night. It was beaten by the American Dad! episode [...] "Fart-Break Hotel", The Cleveland Show episode [...] "How Do You Solve a Problem Like Roberta?", The Simpsons episode [...] "Flaming Moe", and the Bob's Burgers episode [...] "Crawl Space". In a slightly more positive review of the episode, Jason Hughes of TV Squad praised the episode for some of its [...] "silly side jokes," [...] but felt disappointed by the ending to the show, commenting, [...] "it didn't follow any real logic [...] It was an easy way out, as if they'd written themselves into a corner." [...] Hughes also criticized the episode for its dependence on cutaway gags, writing, [...] "at least there were some funnier moments in this one. Unfortunately, a lot of those came in the cutaways. And <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> starting to move away from a dependence on them." [...] Hughes went on to comment that he felt confused by Stewie possibly being fathered by a porn star, adding that [...] "it would be far more likely that Chris or Meg was fathered by the porn star." ...|$|E
2500|$|Thereafter on December 12, {{upon the}} {{conclusion}} of a Republican debate in Iowa, Huckabee personally apologized to Romney.

2500|$|President Lyndon B. Johnson {{ignored the}} report and {{rejected}} the Kerner Commission's recommendations. In April 1968, {{one month after the}} release of the Kerner report, rioting broke out in more than 100 cities following the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. [...] However, in New York City, Lindsay traveled directly into Harlem, telling black residents that he regretted King's death and was working against poverty. He is credited with averting riots in New York with this direct response, even as other major cities burned. David Garth, who accompanied Lindsay that night, recalled: [...] "There was a wall of people coming across 125th Street, going from west to east... <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> dead. John raised his hands, said he was sorry. It was very quiet. My feeling was, his appearance there was very reassuring to people because it wasn't the first time they had seen him. He had gone there on a regular basis. That gave him credibility when it hit the fan." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a 23 June 2011 interview, Flea {{discussed}} the band's return {{and how he}} almost quit the Chili Peppers during their hiatus.

[...] "Things had gotten dysfunctional and not fun, even though <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> making great records, doing great shows and were a really powerful, mighty thing as a band.

I wanted to keep that going, I never want to let that go. Playing with him is something, even though I can do other things that are exciting and beautiful and I always will do those things and I'll always want to grow and do music outside of the band, the thing that we have is special to us and something that is blood." ...|$|E
2500|$|DeLonge's early guitar {{tone was}} {{described}} as [...] "clean to crisply overdriven." [...] During those years, he tended to use Fender Custom Shop Stratocasters (and still occasionally uses in studio recordings), and his own Fender Tom DeLonge Statocaster, with Seymour Duncan Invader pickups, Ernie Ball strings, Dunlop tortex picks, and a Whirlwind Selector A/B/Y box. The Mesa/Boogie Triple Rectifier was key to DeLonge's early sound; he employed them to create a distorted sound. [...] "A Mesa/Boogie is like a nuke: you plug it in and it fills up every piece of the sonic spectrum," [...] he said. As his sound gradually grew cleaner, he grew away from the Mesa/Boogies. DeLonge employed the Marshall JCM900 amps {{for his work on}} Dude Ranch, in which he improved his guitar tone. In a September 1999 Guitar Player article, DeLonge outlined his intentions: [...] "I'm the kind of guitarist that wants the biggest, fattest, loudest, sound he can get." [...] As such, he refrained from toying with his guitar equipment for several years. [...] "I was just into punk-rock. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> cooler than every other band. I thought punk was way cooler and we knew something other people didn’t know. Now I look and think, 'Fuck, there was a lot I didn't know!'" [...] he later remarked.|$|E
2500|$|However, in a January 28, 2009 {{interview}} with MTV News, Richard {{announced that the}} group had split up. Richard explained that Combs had invited all the women {{to come back to}} the 2009 season of Making the Band and that only two of them, Richard and Fimbres, showed up. [...] "It changes [...] completely," [...] she said. [...] "We have fans out there who love Danity Kane. We love Danity Kane. It's hard. We're sitting here trying to make sense of it now. It's hard. We're put in this position that we didn't ask to be in and we're being told to fix it." [...] On the series and in an earlier interview, Bex had explicitly stated her discontent about Danity Kane being divided. [...] "I don't know why ," [...] said Richard. [...] "I think she's just happy. I don't want to even try to answer it 'cause that's not fair to her. I haven't [...] but I heard she's doing well with her husband and she got a house. I love her, but I don't know." [...] Richard was surprised that only two members showed up for another season. [...] "The thing about it ... <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> all going to come back and talk, or maybe if [...] didn't come back, 'cause I don't know how [...] was feeling about that, if the four of us got together.
