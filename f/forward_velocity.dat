25|$|In {{addition}} to the Reynolds number, {{there are at least}} two other relevant dimensionless parameters. A wing has three velocity scales: the flapping velocity with respect to the body (u), the <b>forward</b> <b>velocity</b> of the body (U0), and the pitching velocity (Ωc). The ratios of them form two dimensionless variables, U0/u and Ωc/u, the former is often referred to as the advance ratio, and it is also related to the reduced frequency, fc/U0.|$|E
25|$|Another {{interesting}} {{feature of}} insect flight {{is the body}} tilt. As flight speed increases, the insect body tends to tilt nose-down and become more horizontal. This reduces the frontal area and therefore, the body drag. Since drag also increases as <b>forward</b> <b>velocity</b> increases, the insect is making its flight more efficient as this efficiency becomes more necessary. Additionally, by changing the geometric angle of attack on the downstroke, the insect is able to keep its flight at an optimal efficiency through as many manoeuvres as possible. The development of general thrust is relatively small compared with lift forces. Lift forces {{may be more than}} three times the insect's weight, while thrust at even the highest speeds may be as low as 20% of the weight. This force is developed primarily through the less powerful upstroke of the flapping motion.|$|E
25|$|The bounce of an oval-shaped ball (such {{as those}} used in {{gridiron}} football or rugby football) is in general much less predictable than the bounce of a spherical ball. Depending on the ball's alignment at impact, the normal force can act ahead or behind the centre of mass of the ball, and friction from the ground {{will depend on the}} alignment of the ball, as well as its rotation, spin, and impact velocity. Where the forces act with respect to the centre of mass of the ball changes as the ball rolls on the ground, and all forces can exert a torque on the ball, including the normal force and the force of gravity. This can cause the ball to bounce forward, bounce back, or sideways. Because it is possible to transfer some rotational kinetic energy into translational kinetic energy, it is even possible for the COR to be greater than 1, or for the <b>forward</b> <b>velocity</b> of the ball to increase upon impact.|$|E

500|$|Dynamic {{equilibrium}} {{was first}} described by Galileo who noticed that certain assumptions of Aristotelian physics were contradicted by observations and logic. Galileo realized that simple velocity addition {{demands that the}} concept of an [...] "absolute rest frame" [...] did not exist. Galileo concluded that motion in a constant velocity was completely equivalent to rest. This was contrary to Aristotle's notion of a [...] "natural state" [...] of rest that objects with mass naturally approached. Simple experiments showed that Galileo's understanding of the equivalence of constant velocity and rest were correct. For example, if a mariner dropped a cannonball from the crow's nest of a ship moving at a constant velocity, Aristotelian physics would have the cannonball fall straight down while the ship moved beneath it. Thus, in an Aristotelian universe, the falling cannonball would land behind the foot of the mast of a moving ship. However, when this experiment is actually conducted, the cannonball always falls {{at the foot of the}} mast, as if the cannonball knows to travel with the ship despite being separated from it. Since there is no forward horizontal force being applied on the cannonball as it falls, the only conclusion left is that the cannonball continues to move with the same velocity as the boat as it falls. Thus, no force is required to keep the cannonball moving at the constant <b>forward</b> <b>velocity.</b>|$|E

The penalties for operation of a sharp-lip inlet at velocity ratios other than 1. 0 may be severe; at lower velocity ratios an additive drag is incurred that is not cancelled by lip suction, while at higher velocity ratios, unavoidable losses in inlet total pressure will result. In particular, at the take-off condition, the total pressure and the mass flow for a choked inlet are only 79 percent of the values ideally attainable with a rounded lip. Experimental data obtained at zero speed with a sharp-lip supersonic inlet model were in substantial agreement with the theoretical results...|$|R

Simple dynamic models provide insight into manoeuvrability via simulation of pitch, roll and yaw tail motion primitives.

A novel control framework based on adaptive oscillators combined with dynamic movement primitives was proposed.

The learning process is completely autonomous and it is done in real time. In the second step the periodic dynamic pattern is executed using a low gain feedback controller combined with feed forward torque/force control signals. This allows compliant behaviour, smooth interaction with unstructured environment and generates stable ”open-loop” walking pattern.
