As full professor Tillman was given responsibility for redesigning the physical science curriculum at the academy; U.S. Army Adjutant General Richard C. Drum ordered Tillman and fellow academy instructor George L. Andrews to visit Harvard, Yale, and other American institutions of higher learning to investigate new educational technologies in order to incorporate them <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>curriculum.</b>|$|E
5|$|When Seungsahn {{first began}} {{teaching}} in the United States, there was an underemphasis in his message on the significance of zazen. Under advice from some students, however, he soon came to incorporate zazen <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>curriculum</b> more frequently. More than {{a few of his}} earliest students had practiced Zen previously under the Sōtō priest Shunryū Suzuki, laying out a convincing argument about how zazen and Zen were seen as inseparable in the Western psyche.|$|E

The Learning for Life Programme (LLP) provides a unique cognitive-aesthetic domain of learning through drama, public speaking, debate, puppetry and creative Chinese lyrical composition, to strengthen self-expression and nurtures aesthetics appreciation in students, as well as to allow them to learn and embrace cultural diversity.|$|E

40|$|Although {{visual art}} is {{considered}} a subject deemed {{by the federal government}} as part of <b>the</b> core <b>curriculum,</b> many elementary schools do not include this subject <b>into</b> <b>the</b> current core <b>curriculum</b> of studies. This review of literature provides insight through current qualitative and quantitative studies on the effectiveness of including visual art <b>into</b> <b>the</b> core <b>curriculum</b> and it's impact on reading at the elementary level. Research compiled to reveal the importance of including visual art <b>into</b> <b>the</b> core <b>curriculum</b> and <b>the</b> results of brain-based research on teaching visual art to children. The review also ties together the effects of a core curriculum which includes visual art and it's effect on emergent readers, reading comprehension, and reading test scores. The review concludes with implications for further studies and final thoughts about visual art integration <b>into</b> <b>the</b> core <b>curriculum...</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{conservative}} {{tradition of}} the mosque, with its {{lack of attention to}} science, was shaken by Napoleon's invasion. A seminal innovation occurred with the introduction of printing presses to Egypt, finally enabling the curriculum to shift from oral lectures and memorization to instruction by text, though the mosque itself only acquired its own printing press in 1930. Upon the withdrawal of the French, Muhammad Ali Pasha encouraged the establishment of secular learning, and history, math, and modern science were adopted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>curriculum.</b> By 1872, under the direction of Jamāl al-Dīn al-Afghānī, European philosophy was also added to the study program.|$|E
5|$|Common Sense Realism {{not only}} {{dominated}} Scottish thought but {{also had a}} major impact in France, the United States, Germany and other countries. Victor Cousin (1792–1867) {{was the most important}} proponent in France, becoming Minister of Education and incorporating the philosophy <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>curriculum.</b> In Germany the emphasis on careful observation influenced Humboldt's ideas about science and was {{a major factor in the}} development of German Idealism. James McCosh (1811–94) brought Common Sense Realism directly from Scotland to North American in 1868 when he became president of Princeton University, which soon became a stronghold of the movement. Noah Porter (1811–92) taught Common Sense Realism to generations of students at Yale. As a result, it would be a major influence on the development of one of the most important offshoots of Romanticism in New England, Transcendentalism, particularly in the writing of Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803–82).|$|E
5|$|German {{was first}} {{introduced}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>curriculum</b> in 1931, the same time at which the school began to offer voluntary after-school art classes. F. H. Taylor attempted to achieve equilibrium in the curriculum between arts and science subjects; he made woodwork and art continuous for an entire term and introduced a geography course for the Higher School Certificate. In 1948 rural biology {{was added to the}} curriculum for the first time, for which the headmaster provided a plot of land {{to be used as a}} vegetable plot. At the end of that year, an after-school study period was introduced; following the seven normal periods (five in the morning, two in the afternoon), students were to either begin their homework, or attend a school society. However, the 1950s saw a definite swing towards maths and science, and a subsequent increase in staffing in those departments. In 1957, zoology and botany was taught at A-level for the first time, and physics and chemistry replaced rural biology at O-level (now replaced by the GCSE).|$|E

Nonetheless, he also included the works of certain Acharonim <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>curriculum,</b> such as the Ketzos Hachoshen, Nesivos Hamishpat and Rabbi Akiva Eiger's works.|$|E

His Christian principles made his position difficult after the outbreak of the First World War, especially after he preached a sermon at St Margaret's, Westminster, in March 1915, in which he said that the whole German nation should not be condemned and that any peace settlement should be generous. This led to a public storm of protest, and perhaps partly as a result Lyttelton resigned in 1916.|$|E
