40|$|Polycarbonate {{is widely}} used as a {{transparent}} protective material because of its low density and excellent mechanical properties. However, when defects such as cracks or notches are introduced, it is subject to catastrophic brittle failure at relatively low loads. Notched <b>Izod</b> <b>testing</b> is a common qualitative measure of toughness of a material, measuring energy absorbed prior to failure under high triaxiality and high rate loading conditions. Much {{research has been done}} using <b>Izod</b> <b>testing</b> to compare the fracture energies of blends of Polycarbonate and rubbery materials; however the specific yielding and fracture mechanisms associated with each blend are rarely analyzed. This study presents detailed images, fracture energies, and time durations of the deformation and failure processes actively occurring during the Notched <b>Izod</b> <b>testing</b> of 3. 23 mm and 6. 35 mm thick Polycarbonate specimens, as well as of a quasi-static version of Notched Izod bending. The thin specimens were found to yield in a ductile manner followed by tearing across most of the ligament width, resulting in a final failure including a small plastically-deformed ligament hinging the two failure surfaces in both the Notched Izod impact and Quasi-Static tests. (cont). The thick specimens exhibited slight yielding followed by catastrophic failure, where the crack initiated ahead of the notch and then propagating back towards the notch root as well as across the remaining ligament [...] In the thick <b>Izod</b> <b>tests</b> local pre-failure yielding was evident at the notch root resulting in extensive blunting of the notch. The fracture energies per unit thickness for the thin specimens were almost a full order of magnitude larger than those for the thick specimens. A finite element simulation for the Notched <b>Izod</b> Impact <b>test</b> was developed using the Arruda and Boyce(1988) constitutive model of polymers as modified by Mulliken and Boyce(2004) for high rate deformation. The 3. 23 mm Notched <b>Izod</b> impact <b>test</b> was successfully modeled from initial contact of the pendulum through initiation of failure and early tearing. The yielding patterns and failure occurred along the same lines as in the experiment where diagonal shear bands and lobes initiate plastic deformation from the notch tip and tearing progresses in a horizontal manner across the specimen width. An extensive shear yielded region is observed ahead of the propagating tear. The 6. 35 mm thick model shows the beginning of the formation pressure concentration which causes brittle fracture, but further refinement of the mesh needs to be performed for more accurate modeling. by Meredith N.

The rubber content ranged from 0 to 40 vol. %. The tensile modulus and the yield stress decrease linearly with increasing rubber content. The crystallinity of the PP phase as measured with differential scanning calorimetry did not change with rubber content. The fracture behaviour was studied with a notched Izod impact test and with an instrumented single edged notched tensile test at 1 m/s and 1 mm/s. The blends were studied in temperature range from − 80 to 120 °C. The brittle–ductile transition temperature (Tbd) decreases with increasing rubber content from 85 °C for pure polypropylene to − 50 °C for a 40 vol. % blend, a shift of 135 °C. The Tbd with the notched <b>Izod</b> <b>test</b> and the SEN at 1 m/s are very comparable. The Tbd for the SEN at 1 mm/s if compared to the 1 m/s are at a 30 °C lower temperature.

40|$|Abstract. Bone is the {{principal}} structural component of a skeleton: it assists the load-bearing framework of a living body. Structural integrity of this component is important; understanding of its mechanical behaviour up to failure is necessary for prevention and diagnostic of trauma. Bone fractures occur in both low-energy trauma, such as falls and sports injury, and high-energy trauma, such as car crash and cycling accidents. By developing adequate numerical models to predict and describe the deformation and fracture behaviour up to fracture of a cortical bone tissue, a detailed study of reasons for, and ways to prevent or treatment methods of, bone fracture could be implemented. This study deals with both experimental analysis and numerical simulations of this tissue and its response to impact dynamic laoading.

40|$|SummaryThe {{application}} of natural fibres such as bamboo, jute, banana, coir, linen {{and the like}} in Fibre Reinforced Polymeric (FRP) composites have become so vital due to their high effective stiffness and strength, availability, low cost, specific strength, better dimensional stability and mechanical properties, eco-friendly and biodegradable as compared with synthetic fibres. The interest in natural fibre reinforced polymeric composites is rapidly springing up in terms of research and industrial applications. The increased applications of these natural fibres in such composites are a proof to this claim. The paper deals with the detailed study of bamboo fibre, banana fibre and linen fibre cut into 2 − 4 mm of length with epoxy resin having random orientations. Various tests like Impact test (IZOD and CHARPY test), Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) test and Rockwell Hardness test were conducted on 10 specimens of bamboo epoxy resin composite, bamboo−banana epoxy resin composite and bamboo−linen epoxy resin composite.

However, manufacturers assume that each product produced in either arrangement {{would have the same}} quality. Manufacturers do not have enough information about the properties of each product, i. e. strength, internal defect and the microstructure. Furthermore, in actuality the quality of each product might be affected. It is the problem that we found within the market now (pinholes, cracks, misruns and etc.), that is the reason investigation and comparison of the multi product in vertical and horizontal arrangement is needed. This investigation is needed to choose which arrangement is preferred to maintain the quality of the product. The methodology used are vickers microhardness test, <b>izod</b> <b>test,</b> ensile test, density and porosity test and optical microscope inspection for all produced sample. Results of this research show that castings produced at vertical arrangement mould have higher mechanical and properties than castings produced in horizontal arrangement mould. Vertical arrangement castings obtained higher density exceeds % 1. 6117 than horizontal arrangement castings that ranges between (1. 156 and 4. 8707 percent). However, vertical arrangement castings obtained higher porosity exceeds % 13. 3885 than horizontal arrangement castings that ranges between (0. 0809 and 7. 4629 percent).

Steel wire with < 0. 3 % C content is cold-drawn through a series of drawing dies to reduce the diameter of the wire to the required diameter of the nails. A 0. 12 %w C steel wire cold drawn progressively by 20 %, 25 %, 40 % and 50 % was investigated. The influence of the degree of cold drawing on the mechanical properties of the carbon steel material were studied using the tensile test, impact test and hardness test experiments in order to replicate the service condition of the nails. The tensile test was done on a Montanso® tensometer to investigate the yield strength and the tensile strength of the material as the degree of deformation increases. An <b>Izod</b> <b>test</b> was used to determine the impact toughness of the steel using the Hounsfield impact machine and the hardness numbers were obtained for the different degrees of drawn deformation of the steel on the Brinnel tester. The study used the stress-strain relationship of the tensile test experiment to study the effect of the degree of cold-drawing deformation on the yield strength and tensile strength properties of the low carbon steel. The yield strength of the material was observed to reduce with increasing degree of cold-drawing, an indication of reduction in the ductility and the tensile strength of the material reduced with increasing degree of cold-drawn deformation. The ability of the material to resist impact loads when nails are hammered reduced with increasing degree of drawn deformation as a result of strain hardening of the material after the drawing operation. However the resilience of the material to further cold drawn deformation increased with increasing degree of deformation as evident in the Brinnel hardness number which increases with the degree of drawing deformation. This is an indication of the material’s approach to brittleness as the degree of drawn deformation increases...|$|E
