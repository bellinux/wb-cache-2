40|$|Abstract. Linear <b>flow</b> <b>splitting</b> {{is a new}} {{continuous}} {{cold forming}} process where {{the edge of a}} sheet metal is formed into two flanges by splitting and supporting rolls. Thus the production of bifurcated profiles from sheet metal without lamination of material becomes feasible. The production of such structures takes place incrementally in a modified roll forming machine. Experimental investigate-ons on a HSLA steel show, that even at a surface increase of the sheet edge of about 1800 % no cracks were nucleated in the profiles. EBSD measurements in the splitting centre reveal that similar to other SPD processes UFG microstructures develop in the processing zone. Thus a steady state is reached in the processing zone where increasing strain has no more (or little) influence on the materials properties i. e. its deformability, as it is typical for SPD-processes. The formation of UFG microstructures {{is considered to be a}} mandatory condition for the linear <b>flow</b> <b>splitting</b> process, as it improves the formability of the material to the extremely high level required for this process. The mechanical properties of profiles produced by linear <b>flow</b> <b>splitting</b> are characterised by large gradients, depending on the local deformation and the resulting microstructure.

No large series exists that establishes the flow distributions in Fontan patients, which would be an important resource for everyday clinical use and may affect future surgical reconstruction. MethodsWe studied 105 Fontan patients (aged 2 – 24 years) with through-plane phase contrast velocity mapping to determine flow rates in the inferior and superior venae cavae and left and right pulmonary arteries. Superior caval anastomosis type included 40 bidirectional Glenn shunts (of which 15 were bilateral) and 53 hemi-Fontan anastomoses; Fontan type included 69 intra-atrial baffles, 28 extracardiac conduits, and 4 atriopulmonary connections. ResultsTotal caval flow was 2. 9 ± 1. 0 L · min− 1 · m− 2, with an inferior vena cava contribution of 59 % ± 15 %. Total pulmonary flow was 2. 5 ± 0. 8 L · min− 1 · m− 2, statistically less than caval flow and not explained by fenestration presence. The right pulmonary artery contribution (55 % ± 13 %) was statistically greater than the left. In patients with bilateral superior cavae, the right cava accounted for 52 % ± 14 % of the flow, with no difference in pulmonary <b>flow</b> <b>splits</b> (50 % ± 16 % to the right).

As a result, including the chiral vortical effect alone cannot lead to a splitting between the elliptic flows of negatively and positively charged particles. On the other hand, negatively and positively charged particles do develop a splitting in their elliptic flows if the effect due to a strong and long-lived magnetic field is also included. However, to have a positive slope in the dependence of the elliptic <b>flow</b> <b>splitting</b> on the charge asymmetry of the quark matter, as seen in experiments, requires the neglect of the effect of the Lorentz force.

The reduction in the production temperature for two smooth fractures with increasing <b>flow</b> <b>split</b> ratio is indicated by the solid line in Fig.  10 and we will refer to this function as g(ϕ [...]). A metric of the additional loss of thermal performance in the two fracture reservoir compared with the case of two smooth fractures with unequal apertures is F^*, which we define as the fraction of two fracture reservoirs with Θ _p > g(ϕ [...]), i.e., the fraction that beat the smooth fracture reservoir with the same <b>flow</b> <b>split.</b> The results for F^* are higher than F because the smooth case thermal performance drops with respect to increasing ϕ. However, F^* is closer to the results of F for the two fracture results than to the single fracture results. These results demonstrate that the primary determinant of the diminished performance of the two fracture system is the aperture variation and flow channeling within each reservoir rather than being simply a result of the difference of hydraulic aperture of the two fractures.|$|E
