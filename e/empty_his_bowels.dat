5000|$|The man who {{was elected}} to the White House by one of the widest margins in U.S. history and pushed through as much {{legislation}} as any other American politician now seems to be remembered best by the public for succeeding an assassinated hero, steering the country into a quagmire in Vietnam, cheating on his saintly wife, exposing his stitched-up belly, using profanity, picking up dogs by their ears, swimming naked with advisers in the White House pool, and <b>emptying</b> <b>his</b> <b>bowels</b> while conducting official business. Of all those issues, Johnson's reputation suffers the most from his management of the Vietnam War, something that has overshadowed his civil rights and domestic policy accomplishments and caused Johnson himself to regret his handling of [...] "the woman I really loved--the Great Society." ...|$|R
40|$|Surgeons {{as well as}} {{patients}} have recently shown much interest in stapled haemorrhoidectomy. This is a new technique, which is claimed to result in less pain than traditional operations for haemorrhoids. Conventional surgery involves total excision of {{the internal and external}} components of the haemorrhoids, in order to alleviate symptoms like bleeding and prolapse. Various methods have been used to achieve this, including leaving the wounds open or closing the wounds with sutures 1 or staples. 2 All of these techniques involve some cutting into the sensitively innervated skin, just outside of the anal canal. Understandably, many patients decline such surgery because of severe postoperative pain. This pain is most distressing when the patient <b>empties</b> <b>his</b> <b>bowels</b> and stretches the painful healing perianal wounds. In order to avoid such painful perianal wounds, Longo 3 advocated pushing the prolapsed haemorrhoidal tissue back into the anal canal. A stapling device would then be used to excise the excessive mucosa and to interrupt the branches of the superior haemorrhoidal arteries that supply the haemorrhoids. A special stapler and kit has since been designed for this technique of stapled haemorrhoidectomy (PPH ™ set; Ethicon Endo-surgery®, Ohio, USA), which has become popularly used in certain parts of Europe. However, it was only last year that randomized controlled data regarding the efficacy of this method have been published. 4 - 6 These studies confirmed that postoperative pain was less than conventional surgery. In particular, stapled haemorrhoidectomy patients had earlier and less painful bowel movements after surgery, had less analgesic requirement...|$|R
