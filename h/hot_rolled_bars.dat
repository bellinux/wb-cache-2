40|$|In this paper, a fracto-metallographic {{analysis}} {{was performed on the}} cracked specimens of cold drawn pearlitic steel subjected to fatigue tests. Fatigue cracks are transcollonial and exhibit a preference for fracturing pearlitic lamellae, with non-uniform crack opening displacement values, micro-discontinuities, branchings, bifurcations and frequent local deflections that create microstructural roughness. At the micro-level, the cold drawn pearlitic steel exhibits higher micro-roughness than the <b>hot</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>bar</b> (this is a consequence of the manufacturing process by cold drawing), so that the actual fractured surface in the cold drawn wire is greater than that in the <b>hot</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>bar,</b> {{due to the fact that}} the crack deflection events are more frequent and with higher angle in the former (the heavily drawn prestressing steel wire).

40|$|During {{the past}} 40 years in Germany some serious damages in post- and {{pre-tensioned}} components have been occurred because of {{stress corrosion cracking}} of prestressing steel. Especially those problems caused a great stir, where the attendant circumstances of design, execution and building materials were not unusual. But the prestressing steel was unsuited to resist the inevitable conditions on construction site and inside the construction. Therefore some important measures and corrections were introduced to reduce number of damages related to stress corrosion cracking. They include improved standards and recommendations for planning and executions of new constructions and for strengthening of older ones. Research was done to de-velop non-destructive measuring techniques to investigate older prestressed constructions. With regard to building materials such materials which not guarantee durable protection of the embedded steel had been forbidden and a steady control prevents that unwelcome materials can come on the market.

40|$|ABSTRACT. This paper {{analyzes}} {{the propagation of}} fatigue cracks in pearlitic steel in two materials, <b>hot</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>bar</b> and cold drawn wire. The experimental procedure consisted of fatigue tests on cylindrical bars under tensile loading, using steps with decreasing amplitude of stress and constant stress range during each step. Results show how the cold drawing process improves the fatigue behaviour of eutectoid steel by retarding the fatigue crack growth rate in the Paris regime. The fracto-metallographic analysis shows how the microstructural anisotropy of the drawn steel (consequence of the drawing process itself) creates {{a change in the}} fracture crack path in the form of local micro-deflections (and thus multiaxially-driven fatigue propagation at the very local microscale). The net fatigue surface increases with cold drawing due to the higher angle of crack micro-deflections {{in the case of the}} heavily drawn material, thereby allowing a correction of the Paris law curves by considering the real (experimental) fatigue crack path (multi-deflected; locally multiaxial) and the theoretical fatigue crack path (non deflected; locally uniaxial) ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this study, various {{experimental}} methods are employed {{to determine the}} anisotropic fatigue behavior of a 25 MnCrSiVB 6 forged steel (Metasco MC). This material has a bainitic microstructure and contains many elongated non-metallic inclusions in the rolled direction, which are grouped into clusters. Specimens with different orientations relative to the rolling direction have been extracted from a <b>hot</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>bar</b> {{and the ability of}} certain experimental techniques to capture the fatigue anisotropy has been tested. Results obtained from monotonic tensile tests and Charpy impact tests show that the material has isotropic fracture strength and anisotropic ductility. The influence of the inclusion clusters is clearly demonstrated via observation of the fracture surfaces. Concerning the fatigue behavior, results from a classical staircase experimental procedure are compared to results from self-heating fatigue tests. For specimens orientated at 0 ° relative to the rolled direction, microcrack initiation is controlled by the material matrix and the prediction of the fatigue strength with the self-heating method has been observed to be correct. For specimens orientated at 45 ° and 90 °, the elongated manganese sulfide inclusion clusters are the origin of crack initiation and the fatigue strength drops significantly. For this case, it appears that the self-heating method has difficulty predicting the fatigue behavior...|$|R

The most distinct strengthening effect happens in a temperature on cooling table about 720 ˚C. Above 820 ˚C —the temperature on cooling table, all metallographic structure consist of ferrite and pearlite (F+P); under 725 ˚C, the sclerotic structure like bainite appears. With the temperature on cooling table arising, surface oxide layer thickens.
