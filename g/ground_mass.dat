50|$|The leucite-hearing dike-rocks {{are members}} of the tinguaite and monchiquite groups. The leucite tinguaites are usually pale grey or greenish in color and consist principally of nepheline, alkali {{feldspar}} and aegirine. The latter forms bright green moss-like patches and growths of indefinite shape, or in other cases scattered acicular prisms, among the feldspars and nephelines of the <b>ground</b> <b>mass.</b> Where leucite occurs, it is always euhedral in small, equant, many-sided crystals in the <b>ground</b> <b>mass,</b> or in larger masses which have the same characters as the pseudoleucites. Biotite occurs in some of these rocks, and melanite also is present. Nepheline decreases in amount as leucite increases since the abundances of the two reflect the Na:K ratio of the rock. Rocks of this group are known from Rio de Janeiro, Arkansas, Kola Peninsula (in Russia), Montana and a few other places., In Greenland there are leucite tinguaites with much arfvedsonite, (hornblende) and eudialyte. Wherever they occur they accompany leucite- and nepheline syenites. Leucite monchiquites are fine-grained dark rocks consisting of olivine, titaniferous augite and iron oxides, with a glassy <b>ground</b> <b>mass</b> in which small rounded crystals of leucite are scattered.

50|$|Those leucite rocks {{which contain}} {{abundant}} essential plagioclase feldspar {{are known as}} leucite tephrites and leucite basanites. The former consist mainly of plagioclase, leucite and augite, while the latter contain olivine in addition. The leucite is often present in two sets of crystals, both porphyritic and as an ingredient of the <b>ground</b> <b>mass.</b> It is always idiomorphic with rounded outlines. The feldspar ranges from bytownite to oligoclase, being usually a variety of labradorite; orthoclase is scarce. The augite varies a good deal in chemnistry and optical character, being green, brown or violet (suggesting high Na and Ti content), but it is rarely high enough in Na and Fe to qualify as aegirine-augite or aegirine. Among the accessory minerals biotite, brown hornblende, hauyne, iron oxides and apatite are the commonest; melanite and nepheline may also occur. The <b>ground</b> <b>mass</b> of these rocks is only occasionally rich in glass. The leucite-tephrites and leucite-basanites of Vesuvius and Somma are familiar examples of this class of rocks.

5000|$|The Great Þjórsá Lava is {{the largest}} lava flow in Iceland (by both area and volume) and the largest lava that {{is known to have}} erupted in a single {{eruption}} in the Holocene. It belongs to a group of lavas known as the Tungná lavas. It was erupted in the Veiðivötn region, Central Iceland, 8600 years BP (6600 BC). The crater area is covered by younger lavas and eruptives. The Þjórsá Lava does not appear on the surface until 70 km downstream of its supposed crater area. In the lowlands of South Iceland the lava has overflown wide areas, covering the districts Landsveit, Gnúpverjahreppur, Skeið and Flói.

50|$|In petrology, limburgite is a dark-colored {{volcanic}} rock resembling basalt in appearance, but containing normally no feldspar. The name {{derives from the}} type locality the Limberg or the Limburg, close to Sasbach am Kaiserstuhl in Baden-Württemberg, where they occur in the well-known rock of the Kaiserstuhl. They consist essentially of olivine and augite with a brownish glassy groundmass. The augite may be green, but more commonly is brown or violet; the olivine is usually pale green or colourless, but is sometimes yellow. Within the groundmass a second generation of small euhedral augites frequently occurs; more rarely olivine is present also as an ingredient of the matrix. The principal accessory minerals are ilmenite and apatite. Feldspar though sometimes present, is never abundant, and nepheline also is unusual. In some limburgites large phenocrysts of dark brown hornblende and biotite are found, mostly with irregular borders blackened by resorption; in others there are large crystals of anorthoclase. Hauyne is an ingredient {{of some of the}} limburgites of the Cape Verde Islands.- Rocks of this group occur in considerable numbers in Germany (Rhine district) and in Bohemia, also in Scotland, Auvergne, Spain, Africa (Kilimanjaro) and Brazil. They are associated principally with basalts, nepheline and leucite basalts and monchiquites. From the last-named rocks the limburgites are not easily separated as the two classes bear a very close resemblance in structure and in mineral composition, though many authorities believe that the <b>ground</b> <b>mass</b> of the monchiquites is not a glass but crystalline analcite.

Instead of the complete dynamics of the black hole self-interaction we consider only such stable (stationary) dynamical situations determined by condition that black hole (outer) horizon circumference holds the integer number of the reduced Compton wave lengths corresponding to mass spectrum of a small quantum system (representing quant of the black hole self-interaction). Then, we show that Kerr-Newman black hole entropy represents simply the quotient of the sum of static part and rotation part of mass of black hole {{on the one hand}} and <b>ground</b> <b>mass</b> of small quantum system on the other hand.

A quantitative indication of mass stability provides as an index term known “the Factor of Safety (F. S.) ”. There are uncertain to some degrees, such as only a single value of mass properties is used or variation in geologic conditions, computed values of F. S. are never absolutely precise. An alternative measurement of stability regarding use of index terms “Reliability (R) and probability of failure [p (f) ] ” is {{to cope with the}} uncertainty well. Concurrent processes of stability assessment are done using both the deterministic and reliability methods. Field data on the reliability approach assumed to be either normal function or lognormal function distribution. Conclusion/Recommendations: Three types of reliability model are proposed.
