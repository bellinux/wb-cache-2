40|$|International audienceA {{statistical}} analysis of the plasma sheet activity is performed from CLUSTER observations (years 2001 to 2004). Different types of 'events' are defined by using the plasma flow velocity (V-events), the low frequency magnetic fluctuations (B-events), and the spectral density of higher frequency waves (HF-events). They are selected by an automatic procedure from 2 criteria: a lower threshold for the fluctuations and a minimal <b>duration</b> <b>for</b> each events. The V-events correspond to the usual 'BBF'. The three types of 'events' form an homogenous set, their number (20 to 50 for each Cluster 'tail' season, depending on the selection criteria) and their total duration (5 - 10 % of the time spent by CLUSTER in the sheet) being comparable. 'Events' of different types are positively correlated with percentages of common detection reaching 50 %. They are also organized in bunches that characterize local active states in the plasma sheet. However, these active states do not present a one-to-one relationship with substorms or auroral activations. Analysing how the number of 'events' varies with the selection criteria, it is concluded that the B-events saturate at 2 - 4 nT and have a rather long duration (more than 1 - 2 minutes) when HF-events are more likely bursty and intense since their number significantly <b>increases</b> <b>for</b> <b>duration</b> smaller than 1 minute.

A previous study from Uruguay suggested {{a high risk of}} bladder cancer associated with maté drinking. We conducted an additional case-control study in order to further explore the role of non-alcoholic beverages in bladder carcinogenesis. Methods In the time period 1996 – 2000, 255 incident cases with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder and 501 patients treated in the same hospitals and in the same time period were frequency matched on age, sex, and residence. Both cases and controls were face-to-face interviewed on occupation, tobacco smoking, alcohol drinking and intake of maté, coffee, tea, and soft drinks. Statistical analysis was carried out by unconditional multiple logistic regression. Results Ever maté drinking was positively associated with bladder cancer (odds ratio [OR] 2. 2, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 2 – 3. 9) and the risk <b>increased</b> <b>for</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>duration</b> and amount of maté drinking.

40|$|Pacemaker-accumulator (PA) {{systems have}} been the most popular kind of timing model in the half-century since their {{introduction}} by Treisman (1963). Many alternative timing models have been designed predicated on different assumptions, though the dominant PA model during this period — Gibbon and Church’s Scalar Expectancy Theory (SET) — invokes most of them. As in Treisman, SET’s implementation assumes a fixed-rate clock-pulse generator and encodes durations by storing average pulse counts; unlike Treisman’s model, SET’s decision process invokes Weber’s law of magnitude-comparison to account for timescale-invariant temporal precision in animal behavior. This is one {{way to deal with the}} ‘Poisson timing’ issue, in which relative temporal precision <b>increases</b> <b>for</b> longer <b>durations,</b> contrafactually, in a simplified version of Treisman’s model.

Like Treisman’s model, this time-adaptive, opponent Poisson, drift–diffusion model accounts for timescale invariance without first assuming Weber’s law.
