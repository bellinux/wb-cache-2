5|$|It is {{uncertain}} exactly why Thomas {{decided to build}} Dunstanburgh. Although it was located on a strong defensive site, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> distance from the local settlements and other strategic sites of value. Thomas held some lands in Northumberland, but they were insignificant in comparison to his other estates in the Midlands and Yorkshire, and until 1313 he had paid them little attention.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> time {{afterward}} {{when the}} thought flashed upon {{my mind that}} the disturbances I had observed {{might be due to}} an intelligent control. Although I could not decipher their meaning, it was impossible for me to think of them as having been entirely accidental. The feeling is constantly growing on me that I had been the first to hear the greeting of one planet to another.|$|E

5|$|Reviewers {{agreed that}} A Link Between Worlds excelled at {{making use of}} the console's 3D capabilities. However, the game's art {{direction}} was divisive among critics, with some writers expressing dislike for the graphics, and others calling the visuals gorgeous. The game's music composition was complimented; Ryckert called the game's soundtrack {{one of the best}} in gaming, and Veloria thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> of the best in the series, praising both the new compositions and the adapted renditions music from A Link to the Past.|$|E
5|$|After {{the threat}} from {{invasion}} muted in 1941, the Command's attention turned to the Battle of the Atlantic. During this time, the Command used the Martin Maryland, which excelled in PR work. On 13 July 1941, the first PR Mosquito arrived, though <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> time before the aircraft was operational. By September 1941, the operational strength of the PRU's first flight was 37 Spitfires, two Marylands and two Mosquitoes. The long-range Spitfires and Mosquitoes could reach deep into German airspace, and photograph the Baltic Sea ports and monitor German surface ships. Flights of eight hours were not uncommon. One Spitfire reached Gdynia, searching for the German battleship Tirpitz. Tactics needed to vary to avoid Spitfires being intercepted by German patrols at heights of 30,000ft. Constant trips alerted the Germans to the British operations, but the Admiralty insisted in the volume of flights so they could keep tabs on German capital ships. With surprise lost, the only solution was to change the height and directions of approach.|$|E
5|$|She had {{formerly}} had {{the same}} symptoms of arsenical poison herself, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> time before she discovered {{it to be the}} mesmeric work of an enemy. Soon after her marriage her husband began to manifest the same symptoms and had since shown them from time to time; but was, with her help, always able to overcome them. A few weeks ago she observed that he did not look well, and when questioned {{he said that he was}} unable to get the idea of this arsenical poison out of his mind. He had been steadily growing worse ever since, but still had hoped to overcome the trouble until the last. After the death the body had turned black.|$|E

5|$|There {{was a scene}} were I {{was lying}} on the ground, {{appearing}} to be dead, in a Lodger-esque pose and we had a camera with a big weather balloon filled with helium hooked up to it… the first one we did, we started the film, I was laying on the ground and the ropes that were holding the balloon snapped, the camera just took off into the atmosphere… the camera landed two hundred miles away in a farmer's field somewhere. He finds it and takes it to the police, thinking that it's a surveillance camera for marijuana, they develop the film and think that it's some sort of snuff film of a murder, give it to the FBI and have pathologists looking at the body saying, 'yeah, he's rotting,' (I had corn starch on me, right) 'he's been decomposing for 3 weeks.' You could see {{the other members of the}} band walking away and they had these weird outfits on, and they thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> kind of gang slaying.|$|E
5|$|Three days later, on 26 April, Ball scored another double victory, flying S.E.5 no.A4850, and {{one more}} on 28 April. This last day's {{fighting}} left the S.E.5 so battered by enemy action that it was dismantled and sent away for repair. The following month, despite continual problems with jamming guns in the S.E.5s, Ball shot down seven Albatroses in five days, including two reconnaissance models on 1 May, a reconnaissance plane and an Albatros D.III fighter on 2 May; a D.III on 4 May, and two D.IIIs the next day, 5 May. The second of these victims nearly rammed Ball as they shot {{it out in a}} head-on firing pass. As they sped past one another, Ball was left temporarily blinded by oil spraying from the holed oil tank of his craft. Clearing the oil from his eyes, he flew his S.E.5 home with zero oil pressure in an engine on the brink of seizure. He was so overwrought that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> time after landing before he could finish thanking God, then dictating his combat report.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1932 season, Jardine became captain of Surrey. There was much speculation that Fender had been replaced due to disputes with the Surrey committee but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> time before this, and Jardine's appointment, was confirmed. Fender was supportive of Jardine and happy to play under him. Jardine overcame a cautious beginning to develop a more aggressive captaincy style, and Surrey finished in their highest position in the championship for six years. England played one international match that season, India's first ever Test match, and Jardine was selected as captain. India possessed a very effective bowling attack on this tour, which surprised many teams, and England's batsmen struggled against them. Jardine, who had played a long innings against the tourists for M.C.C. earlier in the season, was the only English batsman to pass 30 in both innings. He scored 79 and 85 not out, and was praised for two excellent defensive innings in a difficult situation by Wisden and The Cricketer. During the match, Jardine again clashed with his team. He gave Bill Bowes and Bill Voce the very unusual instruction to bowl one full toss each over {{to take advantage of the}} batsmen's trouble seeing the ball against the crowd. The bowlers did not do so, and were later reprimanded by Jardine who told them to obey orders. Jardine himself went on to score 1,464 runs in the season at an average of 52.28.|$|E

25|$|Volatile organic {{compounds}} (VOCs) are a dangerous contaminant of groundwater. They are generally {{introduced to the}} environment through careless industrial practices.

25|$|Carteret {{received}} a promotion to post-captain on 22 January 1806, but Scorpion had just sailed to the Leeward Islands station and so <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> time before notification {{caught up with}} him.

25|$|Bloxam {{also noticed}} that the Hawaiian nectar-feeding birds were {{different}} from both humming birds and the genus {{with which they were}} then associated, Certhia (creepers). He put them into a new genus Nectarina and wrote that in their flight they resembled finches. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> 150 years later that it was accepted that the Hawaiian honeycreepers (now in several different genera) had evolved from cardueline finches.|$|E
25|$|The Eph receptors were {{initially}} identified in 1987 following {{a search for}} tyrosine kinases with possible roles in cancer, earning their name from the erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular carcinoma cell line from which their cDNA was obtained. These transmembranous receptors {{were initially}} classed as orphan receptors with no known ligands or functions, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> time before possible functions of the receptors were known.|$|E

However, the weapons were removed by local residents and hid on Huckeby's property. A reward was offered for their return, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> time until the circumstances connected with the removal of the weapons were divulged.|$|E
25|$|On 31 March 1795, Étienne Lasne was {{appointed}} to be the child's guardian in replacement of Laurent. In May 1795, the boy was seriously ill, and a doctor, P. J. Desault, who had visited him seven months earlier, was summoned. However, on 1 June, Desault died suddenly, not without suspicion of poison, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> days before doctors Philippe-Jean Pelletan and Dumangin were called.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{political}} and economic change to a Lutheran state church during the reformation happened quickly, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> time before it was widely accepted by the people. Prior to the transition, the new doctrine had been preached only in Bergen and in a few noble households along the western seaboard. Influenced by Fru Inger, Austraat was one of the households noted for early assumption of the Protestant doctrine.|$|E
