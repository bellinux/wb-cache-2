The {{magazine}} was originally typewritten, reduced on a photocopier, pasted-up and printed on a Gestetner off-set litho <b>duplicating</b> <b>machine.</b> Around issue 17, {{the magazine was}} type-set on an Amstrad PCW using Wordstream and from Lobster 27, on an AppleMac with Claris Works. Lobster Issue 57 (Summer 2009) was the last hard copy issue. Issue 58 (Winter 2009/2010) was the first available without charge. The magazine is published from Ramsay's home in Hull.|$|E

After studying typography and page layouts, he borrowed the college's <b>duplicating</b> <b>machine</b> and published a newspaper called Jazz in 1958, which reported concerts at the Liverpool Jazz Society club, the Temple Jazz Club and the Cavern Club. He also worked as assistant editor on University of Liverpool's charity magazine, Pantosphinx, and on a music newsletter for Frank Hessy's musical instruments store called Frank Comments. The title was suggested by the owner, Frank Hesselberg, as a play on his own comments, but was abandoned after a few issues.|$|E

In 1929 he received his first industrial-design commission to contemporize {{the appearance of a}} <b>duplicating</b> <b>machine</b> by Gestetner. Further commissions followed, including work for Westinghouse, the Hupp Motor Company (the Hupmobile styling), and styling the Coldspot refrigerator for Sears-Roebuck. It was this product that established his reputation as an industrial designer. He opened a London office in the mid-1930s that continues to operate.|$|E

The pioneering group, consisting of the Craddocks, Doug Angus, Peter Jackson, and Greg Lovejoy split into two parties, with each party claiming a route on the same day. [...] Many more climbs were put up in the following days and weeks, including the classic climb Tiptoe Ridge (5), and in 1964 Steve Craddock and his father Bob produced the first Arapiles climbing guidebook on a school <b>duplicating</b> <b>machine</b> [...] (featuring 15 routes).|$|E

Copies appeared in Saarbrücken, Stuttgart, Cologne, Vienna, Freiburg, Chemnitz, Hamburg, Innsbruck and Berlin. Sophie Scholl stated during her Gestapo interrogation that from summer 1942 on, {{the aim of the}} White Rose was to address a broader range of the population. Consequently, in the fifth leaflet, the name of the group was changed from White Rose to [...] "German Resistance Movement", and also the style of writing became more polemic and less intellectual. The students had become convinced during their military service that the war was lost: [...] "Hitler kann den Krieg nicht gewinnen, nur noch verlängern. - Hitler cannot win the war, he can only prolong it." [...] They appealed to renounce [...] "national socialist subhumanism", imperialism and Prussian militarism [...] "for all time". The reader was urged to [...] "Support the resistance movement!" [...] in the struggle for [...] "freedom of speech, freedom of religion and protection of the individual citizen from the arbitrary action of criminal dictator-states". These were the principles that would form [...] "the foundations of a new Europe".|$|E
