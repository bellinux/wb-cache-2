40|$|Thesis (MTech (Environmental Health)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2007 Good {{sanitation}} includes appropriate <b>health</b> and hygiene <b>promotion.</b> This {{implies that}} proper <b>health</b> and hygiene <b>promotion</b> {{would have the}} desired effect as part of sanitation service delivery. However, lessons learnt worldwide show that in the <b>promotion</b> of <b>health</b> and hygiene, {{it is not enough}} simply to provide facilities, because if people do not use the available facilities properly, conditions do not improve or the system breaks down. The 1986 Ottawa Charter of the World Health Organisation suggests that effective <b>health</b> and hygiene <b>promotion</b> requires the following key elements: • the empowerment of local communities to take responsibility for promoting sanitation and environmental health • collaborative partnerships of role-players across departments • supportive policy environments. Against this background. the focus of this study {{is the extent to which}} <b>health</b> and hygiene <b>promotion</b> forms part of sanitation delivery programmes to informal settlements in the City of Cape Town. The investigation was confined to a comparative review of approaches to <b>health</b> and hygiene <b>promotion</b> in four case study sites (Khayelitsha, Joe Slovo, Kayamandi and Imizamu Yetho) in the context of the following criteria: • Community and household capacity to take responsibility for community-based <b>health</b> and hygiene <b>promotion</b> • Role-players and collaborative partnerships across departments • Implementation of <b>health</b> and hygiene <b>promotion</b> and alignment with national policy. Analysis of the case studies highlights the ineffectiveness of once-off awareness campaigns and the need for a more comprehensive approach to <b>health</b> and hygiene <b>promotion</b> in line with the Ottawa Charter. The push towards universal coverage of basic sanitation services will not bring the intended health benefits of delivery if, for instance, the provision of toilets is not complemented by appropriate <b>health</b> and hygiene <b>promotion</b> programmes...|$|R

Presently there is limited empirical evidence regarding the nutritional habits and education of individuals with intellectual disabilities.

In 2012, Special Olympics Texas provided nearly 1, 600 health screenings to athletes. The screenings provide surveillance information for public health organizations {{in the use of}} health planning, prevention, and promotion. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the validity of a screening tool used to measure nutrition knowledge and habits of Special Olympics athletes.

40|$|Research questions: What are {{the current}} conceptualizations of health literacy, and what {{strategies}} are Canadian health librarians in public, academic, and hospital libraries enacting to put <b>health</b> literacy <b>promotion</b> into practice? Data sources: Serving {{as the basis}} of this scoping review, library and information science, health sciences, and interdisciplinary databases were searched using key terms relating to <b>health</b> literacy <b>promotion</b> as it relates to services, programming, or resources used in a variety of library settings. A web searched allowed for the inclusion of grey literature sources. Study selection: Data sources were searched using a combination of subject headings and keywords relating to health literacy and librarians or libraries, which served as the inclusion criteria. Sources were also selected for their Canadian context or content and for <b>health</b> literacy <b>promotion</b> programs or services that took place in academic, public, or hospital library settings. Data extraction: Data sources included journal articles, government publications, library association reports, dissertations, grey literature, reviews, and newspaper articles. Data were extracted from selected Canadian data sources, identifying the type of library in which health literacy promotion-related programs were situated, the program 2 ̆ 7 s scope, topics covered, and the resources used or developed. Results: The established link between low health literacy and poor health outcomes allows librarians to play an active role in promoting {{the quality of life of}} their patrons. Summaries from research articles and publications from library associations provide descriptions of <b>health</b> literacy <b>promotion</b> efforts in public libraries, followed by an examination of the role librarians play in promoting health literacy skills or knowledge in academic and hospital libraries. Conclusion: Analyses of recent health literacy initiatives and programming, including educational programs, electronic or web resources, and cross-discipline committees reveal the diversity of innovative tactics implemented by librarians to promote health literacy. Health literacy awareness is a tool all librarians can incorporate into their interactions with patrons. Current barriers and sources for future inquiry surrounding <b>health</b> literacy <b>promotion</b> in libraries highlight the need for librarians to promote their skill set as a means to gain inclusion as key players in national action plans concerning <b>health</b> literacy <b>promotion...</b>|$|R
