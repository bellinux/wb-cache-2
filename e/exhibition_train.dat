Freight traffic {{continued}} to Ringwood until August 1967 before being truncated yet again, this time back to a military fuel dump at West Moors. Trains continued to serve West Moors until 1974, before being cut back further still to Wimborne. A light freight service {{and the use of}} the sidings at Wimborne for stabling of an <b>exhibition</b> <b>train</b> kept the line open for a further 3 years.

In 1981 {{it was decided to}} convert the latter and two of the Jubilee cars into loco hauled cars, the remaining five were similarly treated in 1983. They were placed in service on the Illawarra line between Sydney and Bomaderry.|$|E
50|$|The {{future of}} Pontiac was still doubtful. The 1878 History of Livingston County remarked, “the town of Pontiac {{was little more}} than a name.” In the early 1840s it still had only a half dozen cabins, an {{unfinished}} courthouse, and everything was so scattered among “clumps of bushes” that the town was almost invisible. In 1848 August Fellows, who now owned much of the town, had managed to set up a hostelry, which he called Buck’s Tavern. It became a popular stopping place. Some of the first church services in Pontiac were held at the tavern. Unfortunately, Fellows was no luckier than his in-laws had been ten years earlier. In 1849 Cholera swept through Pontiac, killing Fellows and two of his children. One early settler remembered that in Livingston County one person in two suffered from the dreaded disease. In 1851 there was a second attempt to displace Pontiac. On 23 June 1851 a town called Richmond was platted two miles east of Pontiac. Its backers included powerful local business and political figures. These men had calculated that the new Chicago and Mississippi Railroad would miss Pontiac and would have to cross the Vermilion River at their location. Stores, shops, and a school house were built at Richmond. However, the Richmond speculators had not reckoned with Jesse W. Fell, who had retained a strong economic and social interest in Pontiac and had important friends among the railroad officials. The tracks missed Richmond and passed through Pontiac, with the station located in Fell’s First Addition to the town. Richmond was quickly abandoned; some of its buildings were moved to Pontiac. On the Fourth of July 1854 an <b>exhibition</b> <b>train</b> steamed into Pontiac and a few months later regular service on the railroad, soon to be known as the Chicago and Alton, began. Pontiac had survived.|$|E

5000|$|In 1986, Winters had a solo {{exhibition}} at Maurice Keitelman Gallery in Brussels, Belgium, {{and the following}} year a {{solo exhibition}} at the Centre Régional d'Art Contemporain Midi-Pyrénées in Toulouse, France. [...] Also in 1986, Winters' Playroom {{was held at the}} Institute for Contemporary Art in Boston, Massachusetts. The exhibition was part of Think Tank, a retrospective of Winters' work which traveled to the Stedeliljk Museum in the Netherlands, the Centre Regional d’Art Contemporain in France, and the Contemporary Arts Center in Ohio. [...] In the Playroom, walls were covered with paper and cardboard boxes were placed in the room, all with the purpose of the audience being able to create their own art. Both children and adults were encouraged to participate.Winters spent a month in 1989 working with students at the San Francisco Art Institute. Never having worked with ceramics, he spent the month making numerous ceramic pieces, which were then shown in the aptly named One Month in San Francisco. Other components of the piece included Winters’ childhood bottle collection and a video showing each piece in the show filmed briefly next to a ruler. [...] Also that year, Robin served as a visiting artist at the Pilchuck Glass School. Winters again explored the accessibility of art, as he did in Playroom, with his <b>exhibition</b> <b>Train</b> of Thought/Objects of Influence, held in 1989 at both the Wadsworth Atheneum's Lion and Matrix galleries in Hartford, Connecticut. The use of such devices as audiotapes, Braille-like mono-types, low display furniture, wide aisles and ramps, and walls with colors and scents to make sure that his target audience of the visually and auditory impaired were included. Winters also made a number of objects available to the audience so that they could handle them, adding another sensory element to the show. [...] The artist has been quoted as saying, [...] "My work is about the interplay between the artist and viewer." ...|$|E
