500|$|In June 1837 Chopin visited London incognito in {{the company}} of the piano {{manufacturer}} Camille Pleyel where he played at a musical soirée at the house of English piano maker James Broadwood. On his return to Paris, his association with Sand began in earnest, {{and by the end of}} June 1838 they had become lovers. Sand, who was six years older than the composer, and who had had a series of lovers, wrote at this time: [...] "I must say <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>confused</b> and amazed at the effect this little creature had on me... I have still not recovered from my astonishment, and if I were a proud person I should be feeling humiliated at having been carried away..." [...] The two spent a miserable winter on Majorca (8 November 1838 to 13 February 1839), where, together with Sand's two children, they had journeyed in the hope of improving the health of Chopin and that of Sand's 15-year-old son Maurice, and also to escape the threats of Sand's former lover Félicien Mallefille. After discovering that the couple were not married, the deeply traditional Catholic people of Majorca became inhospitable, making accommodation difficult to find. This compelled the group to take lodgings in a former Carthusian monastery in Valldemossa, which gave little shelter from the cold winter weather.|$|E

We had a great year were we made like a hundred songs. Nobody’s ever heard that stuff. But once it went public, everything was different. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>confused,</b> it started to feel like fulfilling a commitment where the game had changed. It was interesting, I’m still sort of unpacking that experience. We all had to sign confidentiality agreements, so I can’t really talk about it." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{night fell}} on August 13, some protesters threw {{projectiles}} at police including Molotov cocktails, and police launched {{tear gas and}} smoke bombs. While police were clearing a McDonald's restaurant, The Washington Post reporter Wesley Lowery and The Huffington Post reporter Ryan J. Reilly were arrested. Officers reportedly asked them to leave first, gave them a 45-second countdown {{when they were not}} moving fast enough, and ultimately resorted to more forceful measures to remove people from the McDonald's. [...] "Officers slammed me into a fountain soda machine because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>confused</b> about which door they were asking me to walk out of," [...] Lowery said. Martin Baron, executive editor of The Washington Post, issued a statement, saying [...] "there was absolutely no justification for Wesley Lowery's arrest," [...] and that the police behavior [...] "was wholly unwarranted and an assault on the freedom of the press to cover the news." ...|$|E

If you could kindly mention now, for instance, what nine times ninepence are, or how many shillings in twenty guineas, it would <b>be</b> so encouraging. <b>I</b> should <b>be</b> so much more at my ease about your state of mind." ...|$|R

6000|$|I {{had been}} out, one day, {{loitering}} somewhere, in the listless, meditative manner that {{my way of}} life engendered, when, turning {{the corner of a}} lane near our house, I came upon Mr. Murdstone walking with a gentleman. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>confused,</b> and was going by them, when the gentleman cried: ...|$|E
60|$|Before I {{had read}} half-way through it, {{he began to}} dictate, {{speaking}} so rapidly that my pen was not always able to follow him.

2500|$|As an ex-smoker, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> also {{disgusted by}} the idea of {{thousands}} of cigarette butts littering the streets and ultimately being swept into the ocean ("Litterbugs and Butts," [...] letter, Aug. 26). <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>confused,</b> however, about what smokers in largely pedestrian areas such as Westwood, Venice, the promenades in Santa Monica and Pasadena, and State Street in Santa Barbara are supposed to do with their smoldering butts.|$|R
60|$|I gasped {{a painful}} laugh. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> tremendously <b>confused.</b> Cavor {{bent down and}} shouted in piping tones {{for me to be}} careful.|$|R
60|$|In those {{after days}} of sickness, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>confused</b> on some points, and very clear on others. I felt guilty of sin, yet smarted {{with a sense of}} injustice. It had not been my fault, yet I had done wrong. But very clear was my {{resolution}} never to touch liquor again. No mad dog was ever more afraid of water than was I of alcohol.|$|E
6000|$|... "Victor," [...] she said, solemnly, [...] "what {{this power}} is you shall have full {{opportunity}} to determine, but I {{say to you}} that {{for more than twenty years}} I've been guided by these unseen presences. I've tested their wisdom and lived under their care. So far as this message is concerned I accept it. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>confused</b> and frightened yesterday, but this morning I am calm. I shall do as they bid. I shall stay here while you go down into the city and see what you can find to do, and together we will test these voices." ...|$|E
60|$|All {{this and}} a great deal more he told us, not only with the utmost brilliancy and enjoyment, but with a certain vivacious candour--speaking of himself as if he were not at all his own affair, as if Skimpole were a third person, as if he knew that Skimpole had his {{singularities}} but still had his claims too, which were the general business of the community and must not be slighted. He was quite enchanting. If I felt at all confused at that early time in endeavouring to reconcile anything he said with anything I had thought about the duties and accountabilities of life (which I am far from sure of), <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>confused</b> by not exactly understanding why he was free of them. That he WAS free of them, I scarcely doubted; he was so very clear about it himself.|$|E
40|$|QUESTION: When I told {{a female}} patient who just {{transferred}} from another city {{to abstain from}} alcohol during pregnancy, she was surprised. She mentioned that, in the past, several doctors had {{told her it was}} all right to drink moderately. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>confused.</b> Have <b>I</b> missed something? ANSWER: No, you have not. Women should be advised to abstain from alcohol during pregnancy. There are insufficient data to suggest a safe threshold for fetal alcohol exposure...|$|R

6000|$|Roberts, {{in spite}} of Campbell's dumb-show inciting him to fiction: [...] "I--I--if you will kindly step apart here, I can explain. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> very <b>confused</b> when <b>I</b> spoke to Mrs. McIlheny." ...|$|R
60|$|What I said precisely, in the {{commencement}} of that interview, is more than I could record, did I think it would redound to my advantage, as I fear it would not; but I made myself understood, which is more, I fancy, than happens to all lovers in such scenes. At first <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>confused</b> and a little incoherent, I suspect; but feeling so far {{got the better of}} these defects, as to enable me to utter what I wished to express. Towards the end, if I spoke in the least as warmly and distinctly as I felt, there must have been some slight touch of eloquence about my manner and language. This being the first occasion, too, on which I had ever had an opportunity of urging my suit very directly, there was so much to be said, so many things to be explained, and so many seemingly slighted occasions to account for, that Anneke had little else to do, for the first ten minutes, but to listen. I have always ascribed the self-possession which my companion was enabled to command during the remainder of this interview, to the time that was thus accorded her to rally her thoughts.|$|E
6000|$|... "How long I slept," [...] said Tommy, {{continuing}} the narrative, [...] "I am not quite sure; {{but it must}} have been a longish time, for it was somewhere in a Tuesday when I lay down, and it was well into a Thursday when I got up, or rather was knocked up by the bow of a thousand-ton ship! It was a calm evening, with just a gentle breeze blowin' at the time, and a little hazy. The look out in the ship did not see the schooner until he was close on her; then he yelled `hard-a-lee!' so I was told, for I didn't hear it, bein', as I said, sound asleep. But I heard and felt what followed plain enough. There came a crash like thunder. I was pitched head-foremost out o' the berth, and would certainly have got my neck broken, but for the flimsy table in the cabin, which gave way and went to pieces under me, and thus broke my fall. I got on my legs, and shot up the companion like a rocket. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>confused</b> enough, as you may suppose, but I must have guessed at once what was wrong--perhaps the rush of water told it me--for I leaped instantly over the side into the sea to avoid being sucked down by the sinking vessel. Down it went sure enough, and I was so near it that in spite of my struggles I was carried down a long way, and all but choked. However, up I came again like a cork. You always said I was light-headed, Bax, and I do believe that was the reason I came up so soon! ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{point in}} the novel when two {{characters}} suddenly switch genders was unintentional. According to Burgess: “I {{came back to the}} story after leaving it aside for two years and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>confused</b> myself—then I decided, ‘Oh well, that works here.’ ” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'About HER!' cried Mrs Nickleby. 'Good gracious, Nicholas, my dear, how CAN {{you be so}} ridiculous! But {{that was}} always the way with your poor dear papa,--just his way--always wandering, never able to fix his {{thoughts}} on any one subject for two minutes together. I think I see him now!' said Mrs Nickleby, wiping her eyes, 'looking at me while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> talking to him about his affairs, just as if his ideas were {{in a state of}} perfect conglomeration! Anybody who had come in upon us suddenly, would have supposed <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>confusing</b> and distracting him instead of making things plainer; upon my word they would.' ...|$|R

5000|$|During an {{interview}} on RTÉ Radio 1 in February 2014, Dolan came out as gay. He said, [...] "In school <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>confused</b> about who I was, {{and it was really}} hard for me growing up because of that. It was hard to deal with because I knew that I was gay, but I couldn't get the courage to talk to someone about it".|$|E
5000|$|I {{was feeling}} down with myself.

5000|$|A speech {{given by}} Speedy {{to the girls}} of North London Collegiate School in about 1883 was remembered by Molly Hughes in her A London Girl of the 1880s: [...] "A certain Captain Speedy had just {{returned}} from Abyssinia, and gave us an amusing talk about it, dressing up, like a quick-change artist, as a general, a priest, a merchant, a courtier, and so on, and throwing in some amazing details of their religious rites, wedding ceremonies, and methods of commerce. He won our gratitude, too, by saying: 'I understand that you girls have to write an account of my talk to you. Well, the very word Abyssinia means confusion, because the races <b>are</b> <b>confused,</b> the religion <b>is</b> <b>confused,</b> the mountains and valleys <b>are</b> <b>confused,</b> and <b>I</b> know that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>confused</b> in addressing so many girls. So the more <b>confused</b> your accounts <b>are,</b> the better they will represent the country and the lecture." ...|$|R

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with The Guardian, Nasrallah commented on the charges he was facing by saying: [...] "I was completely shocked,I {{did not know how}} to respond.

5000|$|Lisa Roosen-Runge {{was less}} glowing in her {{report of the}} 20th Vancouver International Film Festival for Senses of Cinema, saying, [...] "I admit that the revelation about Anna's expired {{passport}} did not {{make any sense to}} me, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>confused</b> by the extra non-Yuki character played by the same actress. I also did not find the epilogue completely necessary. Still, Nabi is recommended as an unusual film despite the minor caveats." [...] Comments made in the San Francisco Bay Guardian were somewhat critical of Moon Seung-wook's direction, saying, [...] "some of his favored technical tactics (in particular, camera work that lurches during moments of emotional upheaval) become heavy-handed", though Kim Ho-jung's performance was singled out as the film's [...] "chief strength".|$|E
