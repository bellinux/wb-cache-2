5|$|Day-Lewis {{threw his}} {{personal}} version of method acting into full throttle in 1989 with his performance as Christy Brown in Jim Sheridan's My Left Foot, which garnered him numerous awards, including the Academy Award for Best Actor and BAFTA Award for Best Actor. Brown, {{a writer and}} painter, was born with cerebral palsy and was only able to control his left foot. Day-Lewis prepared for the role by making frequent visits to Sandymount School Clinic in Dublin, where he formed friendships with several people with disabilities, {{some of whom had}} no speech. During filming, he refused to break character. Playing a severely paralysed character on screen, off screen Day-Lewis had to be moved around the set in <b>his</b> <b>wheelchair,</b> and crew members would curse at having to lift him over camera and lighting wires, all so that he might gain insight into all aspects of Brown's life, including the embarrassments. Crew members were also required to spoon-feed him. It was rumoured that he had broken two ribs during filming from assuming a hunched-over position in <b>his</b> <b>wheelchair</b> for so many weeks, something he denied years later at the 2013 Santa Barbara International Film Festival.|$|E

5|$|The Dude {{finds his}} {{bungalow}} completely trashed and is greeted by Maude, who seduces him.

After Maude has sex with him, she says she hopes to conceive a child; the Dude protests being a father, but Maude tells him {{that he will not}} be involved in the child's upbringing. Maude also explains that her father has no money: her mother was the wealthy one and she left her money exclusively to the family charity. Having an epiphany, the Dude and Walter travel to the Lebowski estate, while the Dude explains: when Lebowski, who apparently hated his wife, heard of the kidnapping, he withdrew money from the foundation, kept it for himself, and gave the Dude a briefcase without any money in it, saying that it contained a million dollar ransom. The kidnapping was also a ruse: when Bunny took an unannounced trip, her friends (the nihilists) faked a kidnapping to be able to extort money from Lebowski. Walter and the Dude confront the Big Lebowski, who refuses to admit responsibility, but is thrown out of <b>his</b> <b>wheelchair</b> by Walter, who believes that he's faking his paralysis.|$|E
