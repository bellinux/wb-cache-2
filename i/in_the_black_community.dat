5|$|During the 1990s, {{the company}} {{was the subject of}} {{controversy}} for its official stance against gay and lesbian employees and for discriminatory practices against African-American customers and female employees. In 2004, a U.S. Department of Justice (USDOJ) investigation found that Cracker Barrel discriminated against minority customers; patrons complained of racially segregated seating and service quality. In an agreement with the USDOJ, Cracker Barrel implemented non-discrimination policies and pledged to focus on improving minority representation and civic involvement, particularly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>community.</b> Company shareholders added sexual orientation to the company's non-discrimination policy in 2002.|$|E

According to Hicks, it is not just that gumbo is a cultural and historical food <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>community,</b> but that it continues to foster that community through its flavors, colors and eating methods, which are usually in large groups where it can be shared among many people.|$|E
25|$|Homophobia in the Black British {{community}} is {{prevalent in the}} United Kingdom. Many gay people <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>community</b> get married or have significant others {{of the opposite sex}} to hide their sexual orientation. In 1998, Justin Fashanu, a gay black footballer, killed himself after publicly coming out to his brother. There has been hate music written <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>community</b> towards LGBT people; campaigns such as Stop Murder Music have tried to counteract this. Some have regarded this, alongside other anti-homophobia efforts aimed at the Black British community, as racist, which makes many social critics reluctant to criticize homophobia in the Black British community.|$|E

25|$|Another {{goal was}} to expand the canon of black children's literature, in which fiction and fantasy were rare, and to {{encourage}} youth participation in the NAACP.

25|$|During the 1990s, anti-Semitism became {{widespread}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>communities</b> {{on college}} campuses, where new historical studies revealed more data on Jewish participation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> slave trade, with some commentators {{claiming that they}} had dominated it. Prof. Leonard Jeffries of the City College of New York was a proponent of this idea, but his conclusions have been disputed by major African-American historians of the slave trade, including David Brion Davis.|$|R

25|$|Birmingham clubs often {{featured}} exotic trappings, such as vivid {{lighting and}} murals with tropical or oasis scenes.

50|$|Both the President and the Delmonico and {{subsequent}} Pullman sleeping cars offered first-rate service. The company hired African-American freedmen as Pullman porters.

25|$|White's {{first major}} {{struggle}} {{as leader of}} the NAACP centered on the Scottsboro Trial in 1931. It was also a case that tested the competition between the NAACP and the American Communist Party to represent the black community. The NAACP and Walter White wanted to increase their following <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>community.</b> Weeks after White started in his new position at the NAACP, nine black teenagers looking for work were arrested after a fight with a group of white teens as the train both groups were riding on passed through Scottsboro, Alabama.

25|$|The strike was, however, {{less than}} wholly successful: Italian workers crossed the picket lines {{in large numbers}} and the strikers lacked the {{resources}} to hold out longer than the employers. In addition, although activists within the WTUL, including William E. Walling and Lillian D. Wald, were also among {{the founders of the}} NAACP that year and fought the employers' plan to use African-American strikebreakers to defeat the strike, others <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>community</b> actively encouraged black workers to cross the picket lines. Even so, the strike produced some limited gains for workers, while giving both the WTUL and women garment workers a practical education in organizing.|$|E

25|$|For {{the first}} several years of its existence, the union {{continued}} fighting the Pullman Company, its allies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>community,</b> the white power structure, and rival unions within the AFL that were hostile to its members' job claims. They also successfully fought efforts by communist to infiltrate the BSCP. The BSCP also tried to involve {{the federal government in}} its fight with the Pullman Company: on September 7, 1927 the brotherhood filed a case with the Interstate Commerce Commission, requesting an investigation of Pullman rates, porters' wages, tipping practices, and other matters related to wages and working conditions; the ICC ruled that it did not have jurisdiction.|$|E
25|$|President Lyndon B. Johnson {{also led}} his administration's War on Poverty. He {{appointed}} Daniel Patrick Moynihan as Assistant Secretary of Labor. Mitchell was criticized by some <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>community</b> for {{his support of}} Moynihan during this period, as the latter had written a controversial book analyzing issues of the black family in the United States and poverty. Moynihan later became known as a noted U.S. Senator from New York. In addition, Mitchell defended the State of Israel during its war of 1967 against Arab states and was criticized by some. Mitchell was among the African-American leaders with whom President Johnson met after Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., was assassinated in April 1968.|$|E
25|$|Following the World War II, {{gospel music}} moved into major auditoriums, and gospel music concerts became quite elaborate. In 1950, black gospel was {{featured}} at Carnegie Hall when Joe Bostic produced the Negro Gospel and Religious Music Festival. He repeated {{it the next}} year with an expanded list of performing artists, and in 1959 moved to Madison Square Garden. Today, black gospel and white gospel are distinct genres, with distinct audiences. In white gospel, {{there is a large}} Gospel Music Association and a Gospel Music Hall of Fame, which includes a few black artists, such as Mahalia Jackson, but which ignores most black artists. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>community,</b> James Cleveland established the Gospel Music Workshop of America in 1969.|$|E

25|$|The {{deal was}} altered {{by having the}} Stax labels' profits cut by up to 40%, {{particularly}} since the CBS distribution agents bypassed the traditional small mom-and-pop record sellers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>community</b> which had been the backbone of Stax's distribution, and weren't pushing the Stax product to the larger retailers for fear of undercutting rack space for CBS R artists such as Earth Wind and Fire, the Isley Brothers, and Sly & the Family Stone. Reports came in to Stax of stores {{in cities such as}} Chicago and Detroit being unable to get new Stax records despite consumer demands, and the company attempted to annul its distribution deal with CBS. However, although CBS was uninterested in fully promoting Stax, it refused to release the label from its contract, for fear that Stax would land a more productive deal with another company and then become CBS's direct competitor.|$|E
25|$|Towards this end, Hamilton {{added to}} the Committee local {{attorney}} Hughes Spalding, chairman of the Fulton-DeKalb Hospital Authority, which owned and operated Grady Memorial Hospital. Hamilton and Spalding proposed the separate but equal black facility, in spite of leaders <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>community</b> pressing for full integration in society. Hamilton {{saw it as a}} beginning, but black leaders saw it as being {{out of touch with the}} reality of the times. The Hospital Authority donated the land for the hospital site, adjacent to Grady. Spalding won endorsements from county commissioners of Fulton and DeKalb, as well as the Fulton County Medical Society and area newspapers, which helped promote the concept. By 1949, $1.725 million in funds had been raised, with the remaining funding to come from the state and the Hospital Authority. Ground was broken on February 1, 1950. Named the Hughes Spalding Pavilion, it was dedicated May 29, 1952. Hamilton was named as secretary to the advisory board of trustees. In 1955, Hamilton and black members of Atlanta's legal and medical community organized Foundation for the Advancement of Medical and Nursing Education, with Hamilton as secretary. The foundation raised $10,000. No one applied for the money. Black interns could not serve at Grady. The United States Public Health Service provided $40,000 in surgery grants.|$|E
