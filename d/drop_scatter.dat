40|$|With {{a view to}} calculating {{depolarization}} and {{differential attenuation}} of microwaves by rain, with allowance for the variable shape and orientation of raindrops, the theory of P. C. Waterman {{is applied to the}} calculation of cross sections and depolarization ratios of spheroids and drops of the shapes determined by H. R. Pruppacher and R. L. Pitter. Use of Waterman's extendedBoundary condition facilitates computation. The scattering characteristics of spheroids appear similar in nature to those of spheres in the regimes considered. Marked singularities in the characteristics of backscattering depolarization appear at optical size 1. 5. The Pruppacher and Pitter <b>drops</b> <b>scatter</b> similarly to equivalent oblate spheroids. Implications for weather radar measurements are briefly discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{process of}} liner wear and the {{changing}} characteristics of the ability of crushing and grinding in the coal pulverizer are analyzed, {{a new type of}} cylinder liner is developed, which has a multi-step wave crest. The small balls on the liner are stuck by the steps, in this way, the wear of the liner wave crest is lightened, so it can keep a long-term stability, it also can take the balls to a reasonable height, increase the number of the balls which are taken by the wave crest and make the <b>dropping</b> points <b>scattered,</b> as result of that, it substantially increased the coal pulverizer's crushing and grinding efficiency; Also the wave crest of the liner can be dismantled from the base plate and individually replaced, so it made a great reduce in the material consumption of liner. The test shows that, with appropriate use of the balls, the liner can reduce the ball charge by 35 - 50 %, reduce power consumption by 30 - 40 %，it also can keep the coal pulverizer's output and improve milling fineness...|$|R

5000|$|On {{the night}} of 19-20 April 1945, the Italian paras (plus at least one British paratrooper who had joined them) jumped from 14 Douglas C-47 Skytrain {{transport}} aircraft of the U.S. 64th Troop Carrier Group and on their <b>drop</b> zones. <b>Scattering</b> was considerable, {{but it did not}} significantly hinder the paratroops' effectiveness. A few were captured upon their landing, but their comrades proved very aggressive - perhaps even too much as several German prisoners were murdered in cold blood by their captors, a cruelty the Germans reciprocated in kind by killing some Italian prisoners as well as a few civilians [...] 16 paras surrounded by German forces and barricaded inside a farmhouse died - all but two - fighting to the last round. Other groups were more successful, inflicting heavy damage and suffering light casualties. Two F Squadron squads (18 men) seized two little towns, Ravarino and Stuffione, capturing 451 Germans and holding out until the arrival of Allied ground forces. Even though the pressure was coming down hard on the Germans in Italy, the Germans did not give up easily, but they were no match for the Italians.|$|R
