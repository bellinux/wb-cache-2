500|$|Following {{defeat in}} the {{previous}} year's race, Oxford's first in eleven years, American Chris Clark was determined to gain revenge: [...] "Next year we're gonna kick ass ... Cambridge's ass. Even if I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> and bring the whole US squad with me." [...] He recruited another four American post-graduates: three international-class rowers (Dan Lyons, Chris Huntington and Chris Penney) and a cox (Jonathan Fish), {{in an attempt to}} put together the fastest Boat Race crew {{in the history of the}} contest.|$|E
500|$|Sargent's {{marriage}} was unhappy {{and ended in}} divorce in 1946. Before, during and after his marriage, Sargent was a continual womaniser, a {{fact that he did}} not deny. His liaisons with powerful women began early, in Stamford, when he was still conducting the Gilbert and Sullivan shows attended by the London gentry who came to join the Melton Mowbray hunt. Among his affairs were long-standing ones with Diana Bowes-Lyon, Princess Marina and Edwina Mountbatten. More casual encounters are typified by the young woman who said, [...] "Promise me that whatever happens I shan't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> alone in a taxi with Malcolm Sargent." ...|$|E
500|$|In early September, {{another letter}} from Parker arrived saying that Stockel wished {{to provide the}} copyist's fee for writing out the orchestral parts in Finland. As 1913 drew to a close, Sibelius had not made much {{progress}} on the American commission, having spent the entire autumn on other pieces and revisions. A trip to Berlin in January 1914 followed, and Sibelius's diary and correspondence indicate the Stoeckel commission was {{at the forefront of}} his mind; an initial plan to set Rydberg's poem Fantasos and Sulamit subsequently was discarded. His stay in Berlin was not productive, and in mid-February he returned to Helsinki ("Uneasy because of the America thing [...] Presumably <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> to my cell {{in order to be able}} to concentrate".) ...|$|E

6000|$|Aunt Eliza did not favour {{us with a}} visit after all. She took {{cold and}} <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home.</b> We were sorry {{that she had a}} cold but glad that she <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home.</b> Cecily said she thought it wicked of us to be glad. But when we asked her [...] "cross her heart" [...] if she wasn't glad herself she <b>had</b> <b>to</b> say she was.|$|R

500|$|Winslet {{has said}} that she is {{interested}} in parts of [...] "angst-ridden women" [...] with strong dispositions masking flaws and insecurities. She connects with [...] "women who are either finding {{their way out of}} a situation, looking for love, having some struggle within love, or questioning the big things in life". She subconsciously finds herself drawn to parts that are in tandem with her personal struggles at certain points in her life. She finds it difficult to detach herself from her roles, saying that [...] "you have to confront your true feelings every single day. And that’s pretty exhausting. Then you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> and make dinner". Even so, she finds it therapeutic to perform. Winslet is known for her willingness to perform nude scenes, having done so in 12 of her films, although she considers its contribution to the narrative before agreeing to it. She believes that these scenes promote a positive body image among women.|$|E
500|$|When Fiasco was 18, {{he began}} {{creating}} {{music as a}} solo artist in his father's basement, even though his parents were not keen on having their son be a rapper. He scoured flea markets and secondhand stores, where {{he was able to}} find an old mixing board and a record player, stacks of vinyl records, and mic stands. [...] At age 19, Fiasco joined a group called Da Pak, which was influenced by other California gangsta rappers such as Spice 1 and Ice Cube. Da Pak signed to Epic Records and released one single before splitting up. Fiasco later described the experience, saying [...] "We had a song out about cocaine, guns, and women, and I would go to a record store and look at it and think, 'What are you doing?' I felt like a hypocrite. I was acting like this rapper who would never be judged, and I had to destroy that guy. Because what Lupe Fiasco says on this microphone is {{going to come back to}} Wasalu Jaco. When the music cuts off, you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> and live with what you say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Four for {{a starter}} {{are not so}} bad," [...] remarked Tom, as the game was placed in their bags. [...] "Even if we don't get any more we won't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> empty-handed." ...|$|E

60|$|After I {{have bought}} things at a shop I am quite unfit for social intercourse. I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> and fume. There {{was a time}} when Euphemia would come and discuss my {{purchase}} with a certain levity, but on one occasion....|$|E
6000|$|... "O dear, Mr. Jenney," [...] said Victoria, glancing {{out of the}} window, [...] "I'll really <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home.</b> I'm sure it won't stop raining for hours. But I {{shall be}} {{perfectly}} dry in my rain-coat,--no {{matter how much you}} may despise it." ...|$|E

60|$|The man did so, and {{it turned}} into a great high {{mountain}} of stone, which Farmer Weatherbeard <b>had</b> <b>to</b> break his way through before he could follow them.

6000|$|... "NO. I AM SORRY. THAT IS NOT MY CARD. But won't {{you try it}} again? Please do. Perhaps you are {{a little}} excited--I'm afraid I was rather stupid.
