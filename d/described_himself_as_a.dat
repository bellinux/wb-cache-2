5|$|Despite {{his large}} number of works on Christian themes, Britten has {{sometimes}} been thought of as agnostic. Pears said that when they met in 1937 {{he was not sure}} whether or not Britten would have <b>described</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Christian.

5|$|On signing for Roma, Marquinhos <b>described</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> quick {{player with}} {{a good sense of}} {{position}} who knew how to impose himself on a game. He named Thiago Silva as his role model. In March 2015, Marquinhos told FourFourTwo that despite his average height for a defender, he compensated with honing his strength and timing, attributes he learnt from PSG assistant manager Claude Makélélé. He praised manager Laurent Blanc, a former defender himself, for encouraging the PSG defenders to attack in set pieces and teaching them the correct positioning in that situation.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} biologist Richard Dawkins <b>described</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> neo-Paleyan in The Blind Watchmaker (1986), {{where he}} argued, following the evolutionary biologist and humanist Julian Huxley, that Paley's watch analogy fails to recognise {{the difference between}} the complexity of living organisms and that of inanimate objects. Living organisms can reproduce themselves, so they can change to become more complex from generation to generation. Inanimate objects such as watches are unable to pass on any changes, so they never become more complex unless a watchmaker redesigns them. The comparison breaks down, in Dawkins's view, because of this important distinction.|$|E
