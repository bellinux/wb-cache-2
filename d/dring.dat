5|$|British mycologist Donald <b>Dring,</b> in his 1980 {{monograph}} on {{the family}} Clathraceae, wrote that C.ruber was not regarded highly in southern European folklore. He mentions a case of poisoning following its ingestion, reported by Barla in 1858, and notes that Ciro Pollini reported finding it growing on a human skull in a tomb in a deserted church. According to John Ramsbottom, Gascons consider the mushroom a cause of cancer; they will usually bury specimens they find. In other parts of France it has been reputed to produce skin rashes or cause convulsions.|$|E
5|$|Myriostoma {{had been}} {{classified}} in the family Geastraceae until 1973, when British mycologist Donald <b>Dring</b> placed it in the Astraeaceae based {{on the presence of}} trabeculae (stout columns that extend from the peridium to the central core of the fruit body) in the gleba, and the absence of a true hymenium. In his 1989 monograph, Stellan Sunhede returned it to the Geastraceae. Molecular analysis of DNA sequences has confirmed the traditional belief that Myriostoma and Geastrum are closely related.|$|E

25|$|At the 1945 general election, Hopkinson was for {{the first}} time opposed by all three main parties. He was by then in his mid-60s and had less ability to be active in his constituency, and also his outspoken criticisms of the Labour Party were not in line with the times.

25|$|After {{his tenure}} as Prime Minister was complete, <b>Dring</b> was knighted in the 1952 Queen's Birthday Honours. Like many former British {{residents}} of India, he went to Africa after Partition. In 1955 he was appointed as advisor to the Governor of the Gold Coast on possible plebiscite arrangements in Togoland, drawing on his experiences in the transition of Bahawalpur from princely state to part of Pakistan. The plebiscite resulted in the British part of Togoland being integrated into Ghana. In 1959 he fulfilled a similar role as advisor to the Governor-General of Nigeria in the lead-up to the British Cameroons plebiscite. The result was the Muslim-majority Northern Cameroons voting to join Nigeria and the Christian-majority Southern Cameroons voting to join the newly-independent country of Cameroon.|$|E

The North American distribution extends south to Mexico, and north to New York; it is also in Hawaii. The fungus is less common in the southeastern and southern United States. It is thought to have been introduced to North America, as it typically appear in landscaped areas or other locations where exotic plants have been established.|$|E

500|$|In one noted {{example of}} an author being too eager to assign a new name, in 1902 George Francis Atkinson {{described}} a specimen he found in Texas, otherwise similar to Simblum but with a loose net drooping from the head; he initiated the new genus Dictybole to include his [...] "new" [...] species D.texense. The species was, according to mycologist Curtis Gates Lloyd, merely a decomposing or insect-damaged specimen of L.periphragmoides that had been preserved in alcohol. Lloyd criticized Atkinson's poor judgment in his self-published journal Mycological Notes, and later, humiliated him under the pen name N.J.McGinty. William H. Long later (1907) transferred Atkinson's taxon to the genus Simblum, claiming that the yellow arms and longer spores were sufficiently distinct to consider it distinct from L.periphragmoides (then known as Simblum sphaerocephalum); however, according to <b>Dring,</b> D.texense should also be considered a synonym of L.periphragmoides. Despite Dring's renaming, and the subsequent acceptance of his subsuming of the genus Simblum into Lysurus, the species is still occasionally referred to Simblum sphaerocephalum.|$|E
