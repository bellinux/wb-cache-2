5000|$|The DRX {{behavior}} for systems with multiple peaks (and single peak as well) can be modeled considering {{the interaction of}} multiple grains during deformation. I. e. the ensemble model describes the transition between single and multi peak behavior based on the initial grain size.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to describe, on the basis of field data, the traits of milk <b>flow</b> <b>curves</b> of Italian Brown cows and to {{investigate}} some sources of variation. A total of 1, 450 milk <b>flow</b> <b>curves</b> of the whole udder were collected in 81 Italian Brown dairy herds in Lombardy, Italy, using electronic mobile milk flow meters. Parity order and days in milk affected most milk flow traits.

30|$|From the {{comparison}} of the heat <b>flow</b> <b>curves</b> and the stored heat curves, it can be noted that after the phase change {{the hierarchy of the}} curves changed. This can be explained by analyzing Fig.  1 (insert): the heat <b>flow</b> <b>curves</b> have different shapes and the overall heat stored before and during the phase transformation changes the hierarchy.|$|R
40|$|Multivariable {{empirical}} models {{based on}} artificial neural networks {{were developed in}} order to predict the <b>flow</b> <b>curves</b> and forming limit curves of AZ 31 magnesium alloy thin sheets, in warm forming conditions, versus process parameters and fibre orientation. Experimental tensile and hemispherical punch tests were carried out {{in order to obtain}} the experimental data set, in terms of <b>flow</b> <b>curves</b> and forming limit curves, to be used to train the artificial neural networks. A preliminary study, based on the leave one-out-cross validation methodology, has proven the very good predictive capability of the ANN-based models in modelling both <b>flow</b> <b>curves</b> (<b>flow</b> stress level, <b>curve</b> shape and strain at the onset of necking) and forming limit curves (curve shape, major strain values and minor strain limit) under different process conditions and fibre orientations. Then, the generalisation capability of the neural models in capturing the effect of process parameters and fibre orientation on <b>flow</b> <b>curves</b> and formability has been proven by the excellent agreement, in terms of the high correlation coefficients, low relative errors and average absolute relative errors, between predicted and experimental results not investigated in the training set...|$|R
50|$|Guar gum shows a clear low shear plateau on the <b>flow</b> <b>curve</b> and is {{strongly}} shear thinning. The rheology of guar gum is typical for a random coil polymer. It {{does not show}} the very high low shear plateau viscosities seen with more rigid polymer chains such as xanthan gum. It is very thixotropic above 1% concentration, but below 0.3%, the thixotropy is slight. Guar gum shows viscosity synergy with xanthan gum. Guar gum and micellar casein mixtures can be slightly thixotropic if a biphase system forms.|$|E
50|$|In a {{stress-strain}} curve, {{the onset}} of dynamic recrystallization can be recognized by a distinct peak in the flow stress in hot working data, due to the softening effect of recrystallization. However, not all materials display well-defined peaks when tested under hot working conditions. The onset of DRX can also be detected from inflection point in plots of the strain hardening rate against stress. It {{has been shown that}} this technique can be used to establish the occurrence of DRX when this cannot be determined unambiguously from the shape of the <b>flow</b> <b>curve.</b>|$|E
50|$|Liquid {{is forced}} through {{a tube of}} {{constant}} cross-section and precisely known dimensions under conditions of laminar flow. Either the flow-rate or the pressure drop are fixed and the other measured. Knowing the dimensions, the flow-rate can be converted into a value for the shear rate and the pressure drop into a value for the shear stress. Varying the pressure or flow allows a <b>flow</b> <b>curve</b> to be determined. When a relatively small amount of fluid is available for rheometric characterization, a microfluidic rheometer with embedded pressure sensors {{can be used to}} measure pressure drop for a controlled flow rate.|$|E
40|$|Using {{numerical}} simulations, the rheological {{response of}} an athermal assembly of soft particles with tunable attractive interactions is {{studied in the}} vicinity of jamming. At small attractions, a fragile solid develops and a finite yield stress is measured. Moreover, the measured <b>flow</b> <b>curves</b> have unstable regimes, which lead to persistent shearbanding. These features are rationalized by establishing a link between the rheology and the inter-particle connectivity, which also provides a minimal model to describe the <b>flow</b> <b>curves...</b>|$|R

Approximation of <b>flow</b> <b>curves</b> is accepted as a power law by P. Ludwig. The features of methods and its sufficient exactness are demonstrated. The methods of construction of the curve can be used for the estimation of specific energy of deformation in the process of traffic accidents examinations...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to study optimal {{transportation}} problems and gradient flows of probability measures on the Wiener space, based on and extending fundamental results of Feyel-Üstünel. Carrying out the program of Ambrosio-Gigli-Savaré, we present a complete characterization of the derivative processes for certain class of absolutely continuous curves. We prove existence of the gradient <b>flow</b> <b>curves</b> for the relative entropy w. r. t. the Wiener measure and identify these gradient <b>flow</b> <b>curves</b> with solutions of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck evolution equation...|$|R
5000|$|If a {{test with}} any {{geometries}} runs through {{a table of}} several shear rates or stresses, the data {{can be used to}} plot a <b>flow</b> <b>curve</b> — which is a graph of viscosity vs shear rate. If the above test is carried out slowly enough for the measured value (shear stress if rate is being controlled, or vice versa) to reach a steady value at each step, the data is said to be at [...] "equilibrium" [...] and we can generate an [...] "equilibrium flow curve". This is preferable over non-equilibrium measurements, as the data can usually be replicated across multiple other instruments or with other geometries.|$|E
50|$|The {{liquid is}} placed within the annulus of one {{cylinder}} inside another. One of the cylinders is rotated at a set speed. This determines the shear rate inside the annulus. The liquid tends {{to drag the}} other cylinder round, and the force it exerts on that cylinders (torque) is measured, which {{can be converted to}} a shear stress.One version of this is the Fann V-G Viscometer, which runs at two speeds, (300 and 600 rpm) and therefore only gives two points on the <b>flow</b> <b>curve.</b> This is sufficient to define a Bingham plastic model which used to be widely used in the oil industry for determining the flow character of drilling fluids. In recent years rheometers that spin at 600, 300, 200, 100, 6 & 3 RPM have been used. This allows for more complex fluids models such as Herschel-Bulkley to be used.Some models allow the speed to be continuously increased and decreased in a programmed fashion, which allows the measurement of time-dependent properties.|$|E
5000|$|Without FD models, {{recovery}} {{estimates and}} oil rates {{can also be}} calculated using numerous analytical techniques which include material balance equations (including Havlena-Odeh and Tarner method), fractional <b>flow</b> <b>curve</b> methods (such as the Buckley-Leverett one-dimensional displacement method, the Deitz method for inclined structures, or coning models), and sweep efficiency estimation techniques for water floods and decline curve analysis. These methods were developed and used prior to traditional or [...] "conventional" [...] simulations tools as computationally inexpensive models based on simple homogeneous reservoir description. Analytical methods generally cannot capture {{all the details of}} the given reservoir or process, but are typically numerically fast and at times, sufficiently reliable. In modern reservoir engineering, they are generally used as screening or preliminary evaluation tools. Analytical methods are especially suitable for potential assets evaluation when the data are limited and the time is critical, or for broad studies as a pre-screening tool if a large number of processes and / or technologies are to be evaluated. The analytical methods are often developed and promoted in the academia or in-house, however commercial packages also exist.|$|E
40|$|We explore numerically the shear {{rheology}} of soft repulsive particles {{at large}} volume fraction. The interplay between viscous dissipation and thermal motion results in multiple rheological regimes encompassing Newtonian, shear-thinning and yield stress regimes near the `colloidal' glass transition when thermal fluctuations are important, crossing over to qualitatively similar regimes near the `jamming' transition when dissipation dominates. In the crossover regime, glass and jamming sectors coexist and give complex <b>flow</b> <b>curves.</b> Although glass and jamming limits {{are characterized by}} similar macroscopic <b>flow</b> <b>curves,</b> we show that they occur over distinct time and stress scales and correspond to distinct microscopic dynamics. We propose a simple rheological model describing the glass to jamming crossover in the <b>flow</b> <b>curves,</b> and discuss the experimental implications of our results.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{establish}} the theoretical prediction that the steady torque characteristics of a rotating disk in ERF can be quantitatively and qualitatively explained. At the first step on the basis of this purpose, the ER effects of electric field and shear rate were investigated by comparison of experimental results of the <b>flow</b> <b>curves</b> between the rotating concentric cylinder type device and the rotating disk one. We clarified experimentally the difference of these <b>flow</b> <b>curves</b> influenced by the electrode gaps...|$|R
40|$|The shear {{rheology}} of soft particles systems becomes {{complex at}} large density because crowding effects may induce a glass transition for Brownian particles, or a jamming transition for non-Brownian systems. Here we successfully explore {{the hypothesis that}} the shear stress contributions from glass and jamming physics are `additive'. We show that the experimental <b>flow</b> <b>curves</b> measured in a large variety of soft materials (colloidal hard spheres, microgel suspensions, emulsions, aqueous foams) as well as numerical <b>flow</b> <b>curves</b> obtained for soft repulsive particles in both thermal and athermal limits are well described by a simple model assuming that glass and jamming rheologies contribute linearly to the shear stress, provided that the relevant scales for time and stress are correctly identified in both sectors. Our analysis confirms that the dynamics of colloidal hard spheres is uniquely controlled by glass physics while aqueous foams are only sensitive to jamming effects. We show that for micron-sized emulsions both contributions are needed to successfully account for the <b>flow</b> <b>curves,</b> which reveal distinct signatures of both phenomena. Finally, for two systems of soft microgel particles we show that the <b>flow</b> <b>curves</b> are representative of the glass transition of colloidal systems, and deduce that microgel particles are not well suited to studying the jamming transition experimentally.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the uniaxial <b>flow</b> <b>curve</b> for solder balls in a flip-chip from experimental-computational algorithms based on finite element modeling (FEM) of in-plane thermal displacement data measured by electronic speckle pattern interferometry (ESPI). In order to measure the deformation of such tiny components as the solder balls in the flip-chip, the spatial resolution of ESPI was increased to submicron scale by magnifying the areas studied. The <b>flow</b> <b>curve</b> for solder balls in the flip-chip was determined by the algorithm, which effectively matches the simulated solder deformation by FEM to the measured deformation by ESPI. The algorithms were applied to Sn- 36 Pb- 2 Ag flip-chip solder balls. The <b>flow</b> <b>curve</b> obtained for flip-chip solder was compared with those for bulk solder.

40|$|This master's thesis {{deals with}} the {{identification}} of the material <b>flow</b> <b>curve</b> from record of tensile test of smooth cylindrical specimen. First, necessary theory background is presented. Basic terms of incremental theory of plasticity, tensile test procedure and processing its outputs are described. Furthermore, possibilities of mathematical expression of the elastic-plastic material constitutive law, thus mathematical expression of the material <b>flow</b> <b>curve</b> itself. Mechanism of ductile damage of material is explained briefly as well. Overview of recent methods of the <b>flow</b> <b>curve</b> identification is given, focused on cases, when the stress distribution in a specimen is not uniaxial. That is either kind of analytic correction of basic formulas derived for uniaxial stress state, or application of mathematical optimization techniques combined with numerical simulation of the tensile test. Also unusual method of neural network is mentioned. For 8 given materials, the <b>flow</b> <b>curve</b> identification was performed using different methods. Namely by analytic correction, optimization, sequential identification and neural network. Algorithms of the last two methods were modified. Based on assessment of obtained results, application field and adjusting the parameters of single algorithms was recommended. It showed up, that an effective way to the accurate and credible results is the combination of different methods during <b>flow</b> <b>curve</b> identification procedure...|$|E

40|$|The modern {{equipment}} introduction into cow milking created technical {{possibilities for}} studying the milk <b>flow</b> <b>curve</b> and for using the results in cattle selection. In preventing mastitis, besides curing, other parameters of the milk <b>flow</b> <b>curve</b> could be used preventively. Research showed that cows that had the milk <b>flow</b> <b>curve</b> with a short duration of increasing flow rate (dIFR ≤ 0. 40 min) and a larger quotient between the peak and down phase (QPD > 1. 20) had also the least somatic cell count in milk (LSCC = 3. 47, and 3. 30 respectively). Such relation is favourable because increasing the relation, the duration of quick and uniform milking extends, and the duration of peak flow rate shortens. That also show correlation coefficients which were between the logarithmic somatic cell count in milk (LSCC) {{on one hand and}} the peak flow rate (dPFR), that means the quotient of peak and down phase (QPD) on the other hand negative (r= − 0. 25 ** and – 0. 27 **).

40|$|The grain-to-feature {{size ratio}} in micro-forming {{processes}} {{is predicted to}} have a vital impact on the material behavior {{in addition to the}} well-known effect of the grain size itself as manifested by the Hall-Petch relation. In this study, the "size effects" on the material <b>flow</b> <b>curve</b> of thin sheet metals under hydraulic bulge testing conditions were investigated. The ratio of the sheet thickness to the material grain size (N = t 0 /d) was used as a parameter to characterize the interactive effects between the specimen and the grain sizes at the micro-scales, while the ratio of the bulge die diameter to the sheet thickness (M = Dc/t 0) was used to represent the effect of the feature size in the bulge test. A systematic approach for determining the <b>flow</b> <b>curve</b> of thin sheet metals in bulge testing was discussed and presented. The results of the bulge tests at different scales showed a decrease in the material <b>flow</b> <b>curve</b> with a decrease in N and/or M values.

40|$|The present {{research}} work analyses {{the influence of}} Ti, V and Nb microalloying elements on the hot flow behavior of a high-Mn Twinning Induced Plasticity (TWIP) steel. For this purpose, <b>flow</b> <b>curves</b> were obtained by uniaxial hot compression tests performed at four strain rates (10 (- 1), 10 (- 2), 10 (- 3) and 10 (- 4) s(- 1)) and three temperatures (900, 1000 and 1100 degrees C). The models of Estrin, Mecking and Berg-strom; Avrami and Tegart, and Sellars were applied to determine the hot working constants used to derive the constitutive equations describing the <b>flow</b> <b>curves.</b> The analysis of modeling parameters of the hot <b>flow</b> <b>curves</b> shows that Ti, V and Nb additions to TWIP steel generated slight increase in the peak stress (sigma(p)), retardation of the dynamic recrystallization (DRX) onset, particularly at low temperature, and decrease in the activation energy required to recrystallization (Q(t)). Likewise, the softening effect promoted by DRV and DRX was more evident at high temperatures and low strain rates. On the other hand, the resulting deformed microstructures, analyzed by the SEM-EBSD technique, showed {{that the most important}} refining effect on recrystallized austenitic grain was in the presence of V and Ti. The good agreement between the experimental and predicted hot <b>flow</b> <b>curves</b> demonstrated that the developed constitutive equations predict with reasonable accuracy the hot flow behavior of the studied TWIP steels.

The volume fraction of these particles can be adjusted by {{the temperature of the}} system in a continuous fashion. Due to the finite polydispersity of the particles (standard deviation: 17 %), crystallization is suppressed and no fluid-crystal transition intervenes. Hence, the moduli G′ and G″ in the linear viscoelastic regime as well as the <b>flow</b> <b>curves</b> (shear stress σ(math) as function of the shear rate math) could be measured in the fluid region up to the vicinity of the glass transition. Moreover, <b>flow</b> <b>curves</b> could be obtained over a range of shear rates of 8 orders of magnitude, while G′ and G″ could be measured spanning over 9 orders of magnitude. Special emphasis has been laid on precise measurements down to the smallest shear rates/frequencies.
