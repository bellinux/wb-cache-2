5|$|London finance {{industry}} {{is based in}} the City of London and Canary Wharf, the two major Central Business Districts in London. London {{is one of the}} pre-eminent <b>financial</b> <b>centres</b> of the world as the most important location for international finance. London took over as a major financial centre shortly after 1795 when the Dutch Republic collapsed before the Napoleonic armies. For many bankers established in Amsterdam (e.g. Hope, Baring), this was only time to move to London. The London financial elite was strengthened by a strong Jewish community from all over Europe capable of mastering the most sophisticated financial tools of the time. This unique concentration of talents accelerated the transition from the Commercial Revolution to the Industrial Revolution. By the end of the 19th century, Britain was the wealthiest of all nations, and London a leading financial centre. Still, as of 2016 London tops the world rankings on both the Global <b>Financial</b> <b>Centres</b> Index (GFCI) and The Global Cities Index.|$|E
