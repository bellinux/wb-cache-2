5000|$|<b>Ice-minus</b> <b>bacteria</b> is {{a common}} name given to {{a variant of the}} common {{bacterium}} Pseudomonas syringae (P. syringae). This strain of P. syringae lacks the ability to produce a certain surface protein, usually found on wild-type P. syringae. The [...] "ice-plus" [...] protein (INA protein, [...] "Ice nucleation-active" [...] protein) found on the outer bacterial cell wall acts as the nucleating centers for ice crystals. This facilitates ice formation, hence the designation [...] "ice-plus." [...] The ice-minus variant of P. syringae is a mutant, lacking the gene responsible for ice-nucleating surface protein production. This lack of surface protein provides a less favorable environment for ice formation. Both strains of P. syringae occur naturally, but recombinant DNA technology has allowed for the synthetic removal or alteration of specific genes, enabling the creation of the ice-minus strain.|$|E
40|$|Ice-nucleating bacteria, {{which are}} known to occur {{naturally}} on many crops and {{have been associated with}} frost damage, may be subject to control with genetically engineered bacteria, dubbed "ice-minus" <b>bacteria.</b> <b>Ice-minus</b> technology is designed to depress the critical temperature at which frost damage begins by displacing the natural population of ice-nucleating organisms. A trial product has been tested in the field with strawberries. Although tests with bacteriacidal compounds have suggested other mechanisms for controlling the critical temperature in deciduous fruit crops, ice-minus may prove to be effective. This analysis examines the possibility of ice-minus being adopted by New York tree-fruit growers and the likelihood of it causing a major economic impact on the state's fruit industry. Based on the climatology, phenology of fruit trees, and the record of actual frost damage in New York, the need for ice-minus is apparently not great enough to conclude that its adoption would cause a significant impact on New York fruit production.
