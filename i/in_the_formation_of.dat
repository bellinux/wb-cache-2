5|$|A tornado is not {{necessarily}} visible; however, the intense low pressure caused by the high wind speeds (as described by Bernoulli's principle) and rapid rotation (due to cyclostrophic balance) usually cause water vapor {{in the air to}} condense into cloud droplets due to adiabatic cooling.

5|$|According to {{the solar}} nebular disk model, rocky planets {{form in the}} inner part of the protoplanetary disk, within the frost line, where the {{temperature}} is high enough to prevent condensation of water ice and other substances into grains.

5|$|After the 1971 primary, Combs {{retired from}} {{politics}} and resumed his law practice, maintaining {{an office in}} Frankfort. He continued to represent large coal companies, drawing the ire of local environmentalist and author Harry M.

5|$|Although the British {{authorities}} had prohibited the American Neo-Nazi George Lincoln Rockwell {{from entering the}} UK, the NSM managed to smuggle him in via Ireland to attend a summer camp in August 1962.

5|$|Analogous to its lighter congeners, the nonbonding {{electrons}} on unbiunium in UbuF {{are expected}} to be able to bond to extra atoms or groups, resulting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> the unbiunium trihalides UbuX3, continuing the trends of existence of ScX3, YX3, LaX3, and AcX3. Hence, the main oxidation state of unbiunium in its compounds should be +3, although the closeness of the valence subshells' energy levels may permit higher oxidation states, just like in elements 119 and 120. The standard electrode potential for the Ubu3+/Ubu couple is predicted as −2.1V.|$|E

5|$|Born in glaciers {{and flowing}} through a rugged {{landscape}} of mountains and valleys, the river drains an isolated and sparsely populated {{region of the}} Pacific Northwest. From its highest headwaters to its confluence with the Columbia River, the Kootenay falls more than two kilometers in elevation. Although comparable in length, watershed and discharge to the Columbia above the confluence, the Kootenay is of a notably different character; its much steeper gradient results <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> many rapids.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{these new}} rules, {{football}} remained a violent sport. Dangerous mass-formations, which involved interlocking interference, like the flying wedge resulted in serious injuries and deaths. A 1905 peak of 19 fatalities nationwide {{resulted in a}} threat by President Theodore Roosevelt to abolish the game unless major changes were made. In response, sixty-two colleges and universities met in New York City to discuss rule changes on December 28, 1905, and these proceedings resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States, later named the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).|$|E
5|$|Disturbance {{has been}} implicated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> {{vegetation}} dominated by large Attalea species. In seasonally dry Amazonian forests {{the density of}} large adult A.maripa palms was correlated with canopy openness; the species also dominates savannas formed by repeated forest fires in Trinidad and Tobago. Attalea speciosa forms pure stands {{in many parts of}} Brazil where natural forest vegetation has been cleared. Similarly, stands of A.funifera in Bahia, Brazil (which are cultivated for piassava fibre) are managed using fire—the seedlings survive cutting and burning, and are able to dominate burned forest patches.|$|E
