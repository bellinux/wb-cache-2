40|$|Forty-two {{children}} with trigger thumb were reviewed {{to determine the}} possibility of spontaneous recovery and the outcome of treatment. There were 22 boys and 20 girls. All {{of them had a}} normal physical examination at birth. Ten patients had spontaneous recovery within 3 months of their initial visit. Thirty-two patients underwent surgical release. All of them had satisfactory results. Our findings suggest hat spontaneous recovery of trigger thumb in children is possible and may be related to a traumatic cause for the condition. <b>Delaying</b> <b>operation</b> until after the age of 3 years will not affect the outcome. Journal of Hand Surgery (British and European Volume, 1998) 23 B. " 2. " 255 - 257 Trigger thumb in children is a relatively uncommon con-dition. The common presentation is either with a fixed contracture of interphalangeal joint or snapping of the thumb with passive xtension. The aetiology is still con-troversial. A congenital or hereditary cause has been proposed by several authors (Gharib, 1966; Van Genechten, 1982; Weber, 1979; White and Jensen, 1953; Zadek, 1942), but Sprecher (1949) believed that the flex-ion deformity was the result of trauma. Recently, Rodgers and Waters (1994) have suggested that the deformity isacquired rather than congenital. Slakey and Hennrikus (1996) also supported this view and stated that the appropriate term should be "acquired thumb flexion contracture " rather than congenital trigger thumb.

40|$|Scheduling {{techniques}} {{are used in}} high-level synthesis of integrated circuits. Traditional scheduling techniques assume fixed execution <b>delays</b> for the <b>operations.</b> For the synthesis of ASIC designs that interface with external signals and events, timing constraints and <b>operations</b> with unbounded <b>delays,</b> i. e. delays unknown at compile time, must also be considered. We present a relative scheduling formulation that supports operations with fixed and unbounded delays. In this formulation, the start time of an operation is specified in terms of offsets from the set of unbounded <b>delay</b> <b>operations</b> called anchors. We analyze first a novel property called well-posedness of timing constraints {{that is used to}} identify consistency of constraints in the presence of unbounded <b>delay</b> <b>operations.</b> We present an algorithm that will transform an ill-posed constraint graph into a minimally serialized well-posed constraint graph, if one exists. The anchors are then checked for redundancy, and we identify the minimum set of anchors that are required in computing the start time. We present an algorithm that schedules the operations relative to the anchors, which yields a minimum schedule that satisfies the timing constraints, or detects if no schedule exists, in polynomial time. Finally, we describe the generation of control logic from the resulting relative schedule. Analysis of the optimality and complexity of the algorithm is presented...|$|R
40|$|Background Ideal {{operative}} timing for non-emergent, acute diverticulitis (AD) remains unclear. Medical {{management is}} initially attempted to convert {{a high risk}} urgent surgery to a less morbid elective surgery, or to avoid surgery altogether. A large proportion of patients will fail medical treatment and require colectomy. Objectives To evaluate the effect of operative delay on sepsis and mortality in patients with AD. Methods Patients from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database who underwent colectomy with a primary diagnosis of diverticulitis between 2005 and 2014 were included. Multiple patient variables were analyzed to see their combined effect on death and sepsis. Patients undergoing surgical intervention on hospital day 0, emergent cases and those with preoperative sepsis were excluded. The impact of operative delay on mortality and sepsis was evaluated using day from admission as the predictor of the primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes included urinary tract infection (UTI), pneumonia (PNA), need for blood transfusion, septic shock, return to the operating room, length of stay (LOS), readmission, wound dehiscence, and surgical site infections (SSI). Frequency of patient variables was recorded and a multiple variable logistic regression analysis was performed to control for possible confounders. Odds ratios (OR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for primary and secondary outcomes. Results 32, 399 patients underwent colectomy for AD on hospital day 1 - 20. Adjusted for other factors, days to operation {{was found to be}} a significant predictor for death (OR = 1. 038, 95 % CI 1. 020 - 1. 057; P < 0. 0001) and sepsis (OR = 1. 051, 95 % CI, 1. 035 - 1. 067; P < 0. 0001). Each day in which surgical intervention was delayed was associated with a 3. 8 % increased risk of mortality and 5. 1 % increased risk of sepsis. Delay of surgery was also associated with an increased risk of blood transfusion, return to the operating room and increased LOS. Conclusions <b>Delaying</b> <b>operation</b> for patients with AD has a significant impact on sepsis and mortality. While non-operative approaches may be attempted, with each additional day operative therapy is delayed there is {{a significant increase in the}} risk of morbidity and mortality. This data suggests that surgeons should pursue operative therapy earlier in the hospital course to improve patient outcomes...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} a randomised, prospective, {{multicentre}} trial of the management of primary open angle glaucoma are presented at up to five years' follow up. Previously undiagnosed cases were selected with intraocular pressure of 26 mmHg or more on two occasions together with field loss characteristic of glaucoma. Analysis was performed on one eye selected at random from each of 99 patients. Conventional medical treatment followed in unsuccessful cases by trabeculectomy (group A) was compared with trabeculectomy at diagnosis followed when necessary by supplementary medical therapy (group B). The life expectancy of these glaucoma patients {{was found to be}} similar to that for the local population matched for age and sex. In group A after four years trabeculectomy had been performed in 53 % of eyes because medical management had failed to control the disease. The rate of operation was lower in those patients with intraocular pressure less than 31 mmHg and mild relative field loss (17 % at three years) than in those with intraocular pressure greater than 30 mmHg and dense scotomas (75 % at three years). Early surgery provided much more stable control with fewer changes in treatment than in group A. The group mean intraocular pressure after trabeculectomy was 15. 0 mmHg irrespective of the time of operation, and this was significantly lower than the intraocular pressure in those cases thought to be controlled on medical therapy alone {{at the end of the}} first year (20. 8 mmHg). Early operation provided significantly better protection of visual field, and the extra loss of visual field with delayed operation occurred in the preoperative period. Changes in visual fields were not related to the use of miotics. There was no significant difference in the final visual acuity in the two groups, but six cases in group A lost central fixation because of progressive loss of visual field, and there were no such cases in group B. Cataract occurred in approximately 10 % of cases in both groups, but in group A this happened with only half the number of operations and at a shorter postoperative follow-up than in group B. It appears that in cases of primary open angle glaucoma of this severity the risk of <b>delaying</b> <b>operation</b> are significantly greater than those of performing trabeculectomy as the primary treatment...|$|E

40|$|Abstract – To avoid {{undesirable}} disconnection {{of healthy}} wind generators (WGs) or a wind power plant, a WG protection relay should discriminate among faults, {{so that it}} can operate instantaneously for WG, connected feeder or connection bus faults, it can operate after a delay for inter-tie or grid faults, and it can avoid operating for parallel WG or adjacent feeder faults. A WG protection relay based on the positive- and negative-sequence fault components is proposed in the paper. At stage 1, the proposed relay uses the magnitude of the positive-sequence component in the fault current to distinguish faults requiring non-operation response from those requiring instantaneous or <b>delayed</b> <b>operation</b> responses. At stage 2, the fault type is first determined using the relationships between the positive- and negative-sequence fault components. Then, the relay differentiates between instantaneous <b>operation</b> and <b>delayed</b> <b>operation</b> based on the magnitude of the positive-sequence fault component. Various fault scenarios involving changes in position and type of fault and faulted phases are used to verify the performance of the relay. This paper concludes by implementing the relay on a hardware platform based on a digital signal processor. Results indicate that the relay can successfully distinguish the need for instantaneous, delayed, or non-operation...|$|R
