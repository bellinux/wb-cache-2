After setting up a committee to dispense alcohol for medicinal and industrial use (the only uses permitted), Dow ordered $1600 worth of alcohol and stored it at City Hall. Dow neglected to appoint an official agent to hold it there; because the invoice was in his name, this placed Dow in technical violation of the law. Dow's enemies seized on the mistake and demanded that the police search the municipal building for illegal liquor. Because the recent additions to the Maine law had removed <b>judicial</b> <b>discretion,</b> the judge {{had no choice but}} to issue the warrant. Police seized the alcohol, but did not arrest Dow.|$|E

Public Prosecutor (1980), {{an appeal to the}} Judicial Committee of the Privy Council from Singapore, it was held that the term law means more than just legislation validly enacted by Parliament, and includes fundamental rules of natural justice. Subsequently, in Yong Vui Kong v. Attorney-General (2011), the Court of Appeal held that such fundamental rules of natural justice embodied in the Constitution are the same in nature and function as common law rules of natural justice in administrative law, except that they operate at different levels of the legal order. A related decision, Yong Vui Kong v. Public Prosecutor (2010), apparently rejected the contention that Article 9(1) entitles courts to examine the substantive fairness of legislation, though it asserted a <b>judicial</b> <b>discretion</b> to reject bills of attainder and absurd or arbitrary legislation. In the same case, the Court of Appeal held that law in Article 9(1) does not include rules of customary international law.|$|E
40|$|This essay {{provides}} an overview of sentencing policies and practices in the state of Wisconsin and considers their impact on the state’s imprisonment rate. Current policies and practices are placed in historical context. Since 1980, state policy has increasingly emphasized the role of the local sentencing judge in determining punishment. Most importantly, a 1998 law ended discretionary parole, which had served as a check on the increasing severity of judge-imposed sentences. Although the state’s prison population remains near its record high of the mid- 2000 s, there seems little interest in adopting new restrictions on <b>judicial</b> sentencing <b>discretion</b> or otherwise restructuring the sentencing and corrections system in a fundamental way. The essay concludes by describing some more modest reforms that seem politically viable in the near term...|$|R

500|$|During Hale's {{period as}} a {{barrister}} and judge, the general conclusion in England {{was that the}} repository {{of the law and}} conventional wisdom was not politics, as in Renaissance Europe, but the common law. This had been brought about thanks to Sir Edward Coke, who in his Institutes and practice as a judge advocated judge-made law. Coke asserted that judge-made law had the answer to any question asked of it, and as a result, [...] "a learned judge... was the natural arbiter of politics". This principle was known as the [...] "appeal to reason", with [...] "reason" [...] referring not to rationality but the method and logic used by judges in upholding and striking down laws. Coke's theory meant that certainty of the law and [...] "intellectual beauty" [...] was the way to see if a law was just and correct, and that the system of law could eventually become sophisticated enough to be predictable. John Selden held similar beliefs, in that he thought that the common law was the proper law of England. However, he argued that this did not necessarily create <b>judicial</b> <b>discretion</b> to play with it, and that proper did not necessarily equal perfect. The law {{was nothing more than a}} contract made by the English people; this is known as the [...] "appeal to contract". Thomas Hobbes argued against Coke's theory.

40|$|Most {{recognize}} that {{federal and state}} laws imposing high sentences and reducing <b>judicial</b> sentencing <b>discretion</b> have created America’s current plague of mass incarceration. Fewer realize that these draconian laws shift sentencing power to prosecutors: defendants fear the immense sentences they face if convicted at trial, and therefore actively engage in the plea-bargaining process. This allows prosecutors, rather than judges, to effectively determine the sentences imposed in most cases, which creates significant sentencing discrepancies that most often are unrecorded and cannot be measured. This Essay proposes a solution that would not require legislative change {{to be put into}} effect: to have prosecutors occasionally serve as defense counsel for indigent defendants so prosecutors realize the great power they possess. Unfortunately, I {{recognize that}} such change is unlikely to happen in the near future, leaving prosecutors in power in the criminal justice system...|$|R

40|$|Does {{it matter}} for {{the outcome of a}} trial who the judge is? Legal {{practitioners}} typically believe that the answer is yes, yet legal scholarship sees trial judges as predictably enforcing established law.

We identify two motivations for the exercise of such discretion: judicial policy preferences and judges’ aversion to reversal on appeal when the law is unsettled. In the latter case, judges exercising fact discretion find the facts that fit the settled precedents, even when they have no policy preferences.

2500|$|Secondly, {{according}} to this interpretation of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution any law which removed <b>judicial</b> <b>discretion</b> would be unconstitutional. The result would be that all mandatory sentences would contravene Article 21. The Court of Appeal held {{that this was not}} the law applicable in Singapore. The Court was also of the opinion that in India Article 21 was given relative pride of place in its constitutional framework due to the [...] "economic, social and political conditions prevailing in India and the pro-active approach of the Indian Supreme Court in matters relating to the social and economic conditions of the people of India". The situation in Singapore was different. Finally, the Court gave two reasons for declining to imply a provision against inhuman punishment into Article 9(1). Singapore's constitutional history was markedly different from that of other Commonwealth countries, and its Constitution does not contain express prohibitions against cruel and inhuman punishments as it is not modelled upon the European Convention on Human Rights. In addition, in 1966 the Wee Chong Jin Constitutional Commission specifically considered whether to include a constitutional provision against inhuman punishment. However, the proposal was not taken up by the Government.|$|E

40|$|This {{article will}} analyse the {{contemporary}} co-existence of standard non-parole periods and judicial guideline judgments in New South Wales. In R v Way, judicial {{interpretation of the}} standard non-parole provisions circumscribed their direct application. Subsequently, in cases such as R v Davies, R v AJP, R v Sangalang and R v Mills, the Court of Criminal Appeal has grappled with {{the meaning of the}} standard non-parole period as a "reference point" in sentencing and has expressed a view that the practical effect of these reference points will be to increase sentence levels for certain offence categories. Alongside this scheme stand judicial guidelines judgments; the most recent promulgated in 2004 for the summary offence of driving within the high-range prescribed concentration of alcohol. With the concurrent operation of these two different forms of "guidance" for the exercise of <b>judicial</b> sentencing <b>discretion,</b> important questions have arisen in relation to enduring issues about sentencing in a context encompassing the potential for increasingly prescriptive statutory accretions. Will standard non-parole periods and judicial guideline judgments continue to provide moderate mechanisms for guidance to sentencers, or will the heightened emphasis on transparency and consistency in sentencing lead to more rigid regulation? What are the indicators for the future as to the extent and form of the guidance or regulation...|$|R

The replacement of Charter “right” or “freedom” with Charter “value” obscures the recognition of rights and freedoms in play. The administrative law proportionality analysis that the Court endorses in Doré does not respect the primacy or priority of Charter rights, and curial deference toward the outcomes it produces exacerbates the dilution of rights protection.

40|$|In 2013, the President, Secretary of Defense, {{and members}} of Congress responded with shock and outrage to {{perceptions}} of increased sex assaults committed by military personnel upon other military personnel. Politicians are considering a variety of changes to substantive and procedural criminal law to make prosecution of such offenses more effective. This Article evaluates substantive military criminal law, UCMJ art. 120, 10 U. S. C. § 920, and Military Rules of Evidence 404 (a) and 405 (c). Drawing on lessons learned from state and federal laws, the Article then makes recommendations regarding statutory changes in military criminal sexual assault and procedural statutes. Specifically, the author recommends amending substantive military criminal law to add the offense of “Indecent Act” back into UCMJ art. 120; modifying the definition of force; eliminating the increased emphasis on whether the victim’s fears are “reasonable”; removing the focus from the accused’s perceptions of the victim; returning the statutory limitations on the affirmative defense of mistake of fact as to consent; adopting California’s evidentiary threshold for giving affirmative defense instructions on mistake of fact as to consent and consent; and creating a statutory structure to restrict <b>judicial</b> appellate <b>discretion</b> in determining the need for certain lesser-included offense instructions.

40|$|Against the {{background}} of the reinforcement of the EU executive pursuant to the post- 2008 economic and financial market regulatory reforms, this article deconstructs the prevailing distinction between an executive body’s discretion to make policy choices and its discretion when conducting technical assessments.

40|$|The {{degree to}} which {{discrimination}} causes the large racial disparities {{in the criminal justice}} system is a long-standing and difficult empirical question. This paper studies a decision in which the influence of race on prosecutors is directly observed: the process of obtaining judicial approval to conduct wiretap surveillance. The Department of Justice requires that federal prosecutors obtain its authorization before seeking judicial approval for a wiretap warrant, and the Department’s strict internal review of these applications implies that federal judges approve all wiretap applications that reach them. After the Department gives its authorization, prosecutors in most <b>judicial</b> districts have <b>discretion</b> to choose the judge who will review the application for a wiretap warrant. In this setting, a judge’s personal characteristics, including a judge’s race, should not influence the number of wiretap applications she receives.
