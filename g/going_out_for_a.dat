5|$|Alison {{remembers a}} time when Bruce took her and her {{brothers}} to New York City and stayed in a borrowed Greenwich Village apartment. After a long day, Small Alison, Christian and John settle into sleeping bags. Small Alison wakes up and catches Bruce sneaking out. Bruce sings a lullaby ("Pony Girl"). He reassures his daughter that he's just <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> paper, but he leaves to go cruising. Medium Alison is angered by a noncommittal letter from Bruce, responding to her coming out. At a luncheonette with her father, Small Alison notices a butch delivery woman and feels an inexplicable kinship with her ("Ring of Keys").|$|E
5|$|After {{bringing}} on Carlos Tevez {{in place}} of Anderson at half time, Manchester United kicked off the second half in a different formation, with Tevez joining Ronaldo up front in a familiar 4–4–2. Both teams attempted to settle into their customary passing rhythms, but – unlike the first half – it was Barcelona who settled first; Manchester United's passes in their attacking third of the field failed to find their targets, and Iniesta eventually came away with the ball before flicking a pass through to Xavi, who played a through-ball to Henry on the left wing. The French forward turned Ferdinand inside-out, but his shot from a narrow angle was straight at Van der Sar and ended up <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> throw-in. Xavi then again passed the ball out to the left flank, where Henry nonchalantly left it for the on-rushing Sylvinho; the Brazilian full-back whipped in a cross for Eto'o, but it was caught {{on the edge of}} the six-yard box by Van der Sar.|$|E
5|$|Stealing a Ride follows two children, Susie Gay and Johnnie Eddy, {{who are out}} tobogganing on sleds. The two see Susie's parents <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{drive in}} a sleigh and ask to come along. The parents refuse and {{secretly}} two hitch their sleds behind the sleigh. When going up a hill, Susie loses her grip on her sled and Johnnie tries to save her from falling in vain. The two fall off and are unable to catch up the sleigh. The children wander {{into the woods and}} become lost. When Susie's parents discover the empty sleds they turn back and track down the children by the footprints they left in the snow {{with the aid of a}} dog. The parents find them asleep in the snow and bring them back home in the sleigh. The children are punished by spanking and then kissed by their parents for their actions.|$|E

60|$|The {{voice was}} now beside them, {{scarcely}} a yard away, yet {{they could see}} nothing {{on account of the}} light, which was intermittent, frequently <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant as the operator's thumb tired on the switch.|$|R
25|$|Some smoking {{restrictions}} {{were introduced in}} German hotels, restaurants, and bars in 2008 and early 2009. The restaurant industry has claimed that some businesses in the states which restricted smoking in late 2007 (Lower Saxony, Baden-Württemberg, and Hessen) experienced reduced profits. The German Hotel and Restaurant Association (DEHOGA) claimed that the smoking ban deterred people from <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> drink or meal, stating that 15% of establishments that adopted a ban in 2007 saw turnover fall by around 50%. However, {{a study by the}} University of Hamburg (Ahlfeldt and Maennig 2010) finds negative impacts on revenues, if any, only in the very short run. In the medium and long run, a recovery of revenues took place. These results suggest either, that the consumption in bars and restaurants is not affected by smoking bans in the long run, or, that negative revenue impacts by smokers are compensated by increasing revenues through non-smokers. Smoking is not permitted in any public transit or in or around railway stations except for the locations expressly indicated for smoking. Smoking on trains was banned completely by the Deutsche Bahn AG in 2007. Smoking has been restricted in airports and all Lufthansa planes since the late 1990s.|$|E
500|$|While {{writing the}} screenplay, Hirani and Joshi stayed {{together}} {{for more than}} four months. They developed scenes by <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> walk and discussing the scene. They would not return home until they had created a scene that would make them laugh, or cry, or had some provocative thought. While there was a shortage of resources during the shooting of Munna Bhai M.B.B.S., the crew did not encounter a financial crisis during the filming of Lage Raho Munna Bhai, as the team managed to receive whatever was deemed necessary (including a Jimmy Jib, a specific kind of camera crane, just for a single crane shot). The film was shot on location in and around Mumbai, with Goa as a backdrop for the [...] "Aane Charaane" [...] song.|$|E
500|$|Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) convinces Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) that {{he should}} {{approach}} Katy and if all else fails, he should buy a purse, which he does to Pam and Jim's delight. When Michael hears she'll need a ride home, he does his best to offer himself, {{going so far as}} to spend the aforementioned $1000 on an espresso machine to impress her. While Pam is sitting on Jim's desk and talking to him, Roy comes up and tries to apologize to Pam, eventually getting her out of her bad mood by tickling her; an uncomfortable Jim leaves his desk. Later, he strikes up a conversation with Katy and in the end she decides to get a ride from Jim, leaving Michael and Dwight devastated. [...] It is revealed that Katy and Jim are also <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> drink, to the apparent jealousy of Pam.|$|E

"I see," [...] {{she said}} one day, on {{entering}} the theological library, where Jessie, having laid down a worsted cuff {{which she had}} been knitting, was deep in Leslie's Short and Easy method with the Deists, and Kate, having dropped a worsted comforter, had lost herself in Chalmers's Astronomical Discourses. [...] "I see you are both busy, so I won't disturb you. I only looked in to say that I'm <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> hour or two." ...|$|R
500|$|The b-side of {{the single}} [...] "Zutto... Iyō yo" [...] was written by Matsu and {{produced}} by Hinata. Matsu decided {{to give it the}} theme of three girls <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> drive. However, she commented that no matter how others looked at it, {{it seemed as if the}} song is about two girls. The song opens with an [...] "electro" [...] introduction and utilizes a warped guitar throughout. In addition to the two songs, the single also featured the original karaoke track to [...] "Ashita, Haru ga Kitara". An LP titled Remix Hyper Bug containing remixes of [...] "Ashita, Haru ga Kitara" [...] by DJ Craig William—"Ashita, Haru ga Kitara" [...] (Hyper Bug Mix) and [...] "Ashita, Haru ga Kitara" [...] (Techno Dub Mix) was released on August 21, 1997 through BMG Victor. It also features a remix of the album track [...] "Love Sick", titled [...] "Love Sick (Deep Sick Mix)".|$|E
500|$|This {{brought the}} {{regiment}} into contact {{for the first}} time with someone it would later meet more seriously, Brigadier Bernard Law Montgomery (often referred to as [...] "Monty"), then commanding the 9th Infantry Brigade in Portsmouth. In 1937, the brigade was on an exercise in Wiltshire and RWY was attached to it for their two-week annual camp. The brigade major wrote that [...] " [...] was run like so much of the TA those days on rather feudal lines...when they heard they were going to have those tremendous exercises – three nights out at a time – they jibbed violently....Most of them had looked forward to exercises all day and then <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> bit of jollity at night." [...] The upshot was that the regiment was banished to a distant part of the camp where their socialising would not be disturbed by the Regulars. However, apparently the Yeomanry were so intrigued by Monty's exercises that their Commanding Officer (CO) approached him, asking to be included in the last brigade exercise.|$|E
500|$|Tolle recalls <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> walk in London {{the next}} morning, and finding that “everything was miraculous, deeply peaceful. Even the traffic." [...] The feeling continued, {{and he began}} to feel a strong {{underlying}} sense of peace in any situation. He stopped studying for his doctorate, and for a period of about two years after this he spent much of his time sitting, “in a state of deep bliss," [...] on park benches in Russell Square, Central London, [...] "watching the world go by.” He stayed with friends, in a Buddhist monastery, or otherwise slept rough on Hampstead Heath. His family thought him “irresponsible, even insane." [...] He changed his first name from Ulrich to Eckhart; by some reports this was in homage to the German philosopher and mystic, Meister Eckhart. A 2012 interview article states that he saw the name Eckhart on one of a pile of books in a dream, and knew he had written the book; soon after in real life he ran into a psychic friend who called him Eckhart out of nowhere, so he changed his name.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, he has gone. I {{have seen}} him over the wall; and it was much better that he should go without any fuss. He went off just as quietly and unconcernedly {{as if he had}} been <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> {{ordinary}} evening's walk. Now I am going up onto the roof. I don't say we should hear any hubbub down at the lines if he were discovered there, but we should certainly hear a shout if he came across any of the sentries round the house." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{game has}} three {{individual}} scenarios; training mode, Blitzkrieg mode, and campaign mode. Training mode {{is set on}} the lowest difficulty and allows the player to finish the game by using any strategy over an indefinite period of time. Blitzkrieg mode only lasts one in-game day and features the Luftwaffe <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> [...] "all-out" [...] attack simultaneously on every target and city. The campaign mode takes place {{over a period of}} 30 days and is set on the highest difficulty. In addition, the campaign mode features historically accurate movements and strategies used by both the RAF and Luftwaffe.|$|R

60|$|Saturday proved {{clear and}} warm, and the Rovers {{and their friends}} started {{directly}} after lunch <b>for</b> Rushville in <b>a</b> two-seated carriage, hired from a liveryman of Ashton.

60|$|Towards night an {{old woman}} came tottering up the garden as speedily as she could, and meeting the {{schoolmaster}} at the door, said he {{was to go to}} Dame West's directly, and had best run on before her.

60|$|Julian {{kept his}} promise, and was seen no {{more in the}} billiard saloon. Fortunately for him the young fellows with whom {{he was in the}} habit of playing were all townsmen, clerks, the sons of the richer tradesmen, or of men who owned fishing-boats or trading vessels, and others of that class--not, indeed, as Frank had said, the sort of men whom Colonel Wyatt would have cared for his son to have {{associated}} with--but harmless young fellows who frequented the billiard-rooms as a source of amusement and not of profit, and who therefore had no motive for urging Julian to play. To Mrs. Troutbeck's delight he now spent four or five evenings at home, only <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> hour to smoke a pipe and to have a chat with the fishermen. Once or twice a week he would be absent all night, <b>going</b> <b>out,</b> as he told his aunt, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> night's fishing, and generally returning in the morning with half a dozen mackerel or other fish as his share of the night's work.|$|R
5000|$|Annette McGivney, {{editor of}} Backpacker, {{has written that}} [...] "Colin {{was sort of the}} {{founding}} father of modern backpacking, the first person to write about <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> extended period and being self-sufficient." [...] Because many people started following Fletcher's advice in The Complete Walker, according to McGivney, [...] "the book could be credited with starting the backpacking industry," [...] including equipment makers and periodicals like Backpacker. Through his writings Fletcher [...] "inspired a generation of young Americans to take up backpacking as means of filling a spiritual void," [...] and to escape from the confusion of Vietnam-era America:"After Vietnam, I {{was trying to figure out}} what to do with my life. So many of my friends had died from bullet holes," [...] recalls Backpacker contributing editor Buck Tilton. [...] "I read The Man Who Walked Through Time, and it was the only thing that made sense to me. Fletcher's words gave meaning to backpacking. I loaded my pack exactly the way Fletcher did and carried a walking stick like his. He was my hero." ...|$|R
