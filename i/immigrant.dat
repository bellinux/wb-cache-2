40|$|This paper {{presents}} a broad {{approach to the}} analysis of immigration by combining aspects of both supply of <b>immigrants</b> and demand for <b>immigrants.</b> Immigration is assumed to be motivated by lack of economic and noneconomic opportunities; and, correspondingly, <b>immigrants</b> are classified as early <b>immigrants,</b> late <b>immigrants</b> and refugees. An optimal immigration quota 2 ̆ 7 s policy, which is based on a linear feedback rule and aimed at stabilizing the host-country’s unemployment level, is developed. The optimal feedback coefficient is found to be dependent upon the correlations of the number of legal <b>immigrants</b> in the previous period with the current numbers of illegal <b>immigrants</b> and vacant jobs, and upon the variances of these variables. The consequences of the feedback policy on the numbers of early <b>immigrants,</b> late <b>immigrants,</b> and illegal <b>immigrants</b> are discussed under the assumption that early <b>immigrants</b> and late <b>immigrants</b> generate rational expectations about incomes in the host country. This conceptual framework is applied to the United States in order to assess its immigration policy...|$|R
40|$|<b>Immigrants</b> {{who start}} with low earnings, such as family-based <b>immigrants,</b> {{experience}} higher earnings growth than <b>immigrants</b> who are recruited for specific jobs (employment-based <b>immigrants).</b> This occurs because family-based <b>immigrants</b> with lower initial earnings invest in human capital {{at higher rates}} than natives or employment-based <b>immigrants.</b> Therefore, <b>immigrants</b> who start at low initial earnings invest in new human capital {{that allows them to}} respond to the ever-changing needs of the host country 2 ̆ 019 s economy...|$|R

In general, the same as natives, nearly half of <b>immigrants</b> are employed in low-skilled occupations, which cover upper secondary education and tertiary level of no more than 2 years in length. However, <b>immigrants</b> have the less probability of being in skilled and high-skilled occupations than natives.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of the predicted earnings differential between self-employment and wage-employment on self-employment propensities among <b>immigrants</b> in Sweden. <b>Immigrants</b> from non-European countries have essentially lower earnings from self-employment and wage-employment than <b>immigrants</b> from European countries. It is found that the difference between an <b>immigrant's</b> predicted earnings in self- and wage-employment has a strong influence on an <b>immigrant's</b> self-employment decision. A one unit increase in the log differential between self-employment and wage-employment earnings increase the self-employment rate among <b>immigrants</b> by about 5 percentage points, suggesting that discriminatory wages in the wage-employment sector may push <b>immigrants</b> towards self-employment. ...|$|R

There are two outcomes that are studied for <b>immigrants</b> and Canadian-born: access to a full-time full-year job and earnings. This study finds that <b>immigrants</b> from all places of birth have a lower probability of having a full-time full-year job than Canadian-born individuals and that, for most places of birth; <b>immigrants</b> who studied outside Canada have a lower probability of having such a job than <b>immigrants</b> who studied in Canada. People with more years of schooling earn more for both <b>immigrants</b> and Canadian-born, but <b>immigrants</b> earn less than the Canadian-born workers with the same educational attainment. Among the <b>immigrants,</b> some completed their higher education {{in their own country}} while others studied in Canada.

The paper also defines <b>immigrants</b> who arrived in Canada at the age of 9 or younger as “young immigrants”. For both males and females, the same models were estimated for the first-generation and second-generation <b>immigrants.</b> As in previous studies, the results confirm that the young <b>immigrants</b> have earnings advantages compared to those who arrived as adults.
