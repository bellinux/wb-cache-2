40|$|The use of {{lespedeza}} as a <b>farm</b> <b>crop</b> has rapidly increased {{during the}} past few years.

This bulletin is based on information collected from farmers located in the States of Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Kentucky who are growing lespedeza regularly as a <b>farm</b> <b>crop.</b> The information includes methods of seeding, varieties used, the place in the cropping system usually occupied by lespedeza, and practices that have developed in connection with the production and use of the crop in these States.

40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} a processed-food manufacturer that faces uncertain exogenous demand and procures a <b>farm</b> <b>crop</b> {{either from the}} outside market or from local farmers via contract farming. The contract price is determined {{at the beginning of}} the season when the market price is still uncertain. When the market price is realised, we allow the farmer the possibility of reneging from the contract, which occurs if the market price is sufficiently high. We show that granting farmers the option of reneging on the contract may improve the manufacturer's expected profit, and identify the conditions under which such an improvement can be expected...|$|E
