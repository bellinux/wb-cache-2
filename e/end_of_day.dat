5|$|In England's second innings, Gooch {{played a}} lone hand. With the {{exception}} of Foster (34), promoted as nightwatchman at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> two, no-one else passed 15. When Gooch was last man out for 84 on the third day, England had compiled 202. The England bowlers managed to restrain the West Indian batsmen, Childs notably bowling 40 overs for just 79 runs, but, with more than two days left to play, there was little pressure on the West Indies, and they strolled to victory in 91 overs, losing just two wickets, {{with more than a}} day to spare.|$|E
5|$|Edrich {{came on and}} bowled a bouncer, which Bradman {{tried to}} swing to the leg side, but instead the edge went {{in the air and}} landed behind point. On 13, Bradman played a Bedser ball from his legs, {{narrowly}} evading Hutton in the trap at short fine leg. After one hour he was on 14. Bradman and Morris settled down as Coxon and Doug Wright operated. The Australian captain drove the debutant Coxon through the covers for two fours, and Yardley made frequent rotations of his bowlers. At the lunch break, Australia were 1/82 with Morris on 45 and Bradman 35. Shortly afterwards, in the third over after the resumption of play, with the score at 87, Bradman was caught for 38 for the third consecutive time in Tests by Hutton off Bedser at short fine leg, just two days after falling the same way in the second innings against Yorkshire. According to O'Reilly, this was evidence that Bradman was no longer the player he was before World War II, as he had been unable to disperse the close-catching fielders by counter-attacking, before eventually being dismissed. O'Reilly said that {{this was the first time}} that Bradman had fallen to the same trap three times in succession. Australia reached 7/258 at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> one, before a lower order burst took them to 350 on the second morning.|$|E
5|$|When Bill Edrich {{came to the}} crease, Bradman advised Lindwall not to bowl any bouncers at Edrich, {{fearing that}} it would be {{interpreted}} as retaliation for Edrich's bouncing of Lindwall in the first innings and lead to a negative media and crowd reaction. Although Lindwall did not retaliate, Miller did so with four consecutive bouncers, earning the ire of the crowd. He struck Edrich on the body before Bradman intervened and ordered him to stop, before apologising to Edrich. England reached 3/174, a lead of 316, at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> three, but declared on the fifth morning after the fourth day was washed out. Bradman chose the light roller and play was supposed to begin after lunch. However, play did not begin until after tea and the pitch played very slowly because of the excess moisture. With Australia not looking to chase the runs, Yardley often had seven men in close catching positions. Australia showed little attacking intent and Bradman joined Morris with Australia at 1/10 after 32 minutes.|$|E

25|$|Forced {{to bring}} himself on when Zaheer Khan walked off with cramps, Ganguly {{dismissed}} Kasprowicz lbw to leave Australia at 269/8. By the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>Day</b> 1, Australia were 291/8 with Steve Waugh batting on 29 with Jason Gillespie for company. Australia, having dominated {{the first two}} sessions, had lost 7 wickets in one session to squander the advantage.|$|E
25|$|The Australians {{still looked}} rusty, having {{spent most of}} the tour so far hiding from the rain in the {{dressing}} room. They too failed to settle and build partnerships, with regular wickets falling. By the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> two, the Australian tourists found themselves 153 for 6 after 36 overs, with only Gary Cosier making a serious contribution of 56.|$|E

25|$|Around 12:00, VII Corps {{started its}} {{attack on the}} {{positions}} held by Morava Division I. However, Serbian infantry and artillery were already deployed for combat, as the artillery fire from the east suggested that the battle had started. After the initial Ottoman progress, Serbs counterattacked and pushed {{them back to their}} starting positions. After the Serbian counterattack, Ottoman units were kept at bay by the well organised Serbian artillery fire until the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E
25|$|Loeb {{occupied}} his recess by, amongst other engagements, {{competing in}} the Shell Donegal International Rally on 15, 16 and , partially as preparation for the coming Rally Ireland World Championship round that November. He scored a comprehensive victory, albeit only after being given a scare by the pace of tenacious private Subaru-driver Mark Higgins, who had a 45-second lead at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> one. Punctures afflicted upon his rival eventually settled the contest.|$|E
25|$|After this distraction, England lost 2 quick wickets {{to end the}} day of 113/3. They {{recovered}} on day 3 {{through the}} efforts of Ian Bell and Kevin Pietersen who both scored centuries. England were eventually bowled out for 446, and their bowlers made an improved effort in Pakistan's second innings, reducing them to 183/6 by the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> 4. They could think about a possible victory, but Inzamam-ul-Haq was still at the wicket going into day 5.|$|E

25|$|Phil Jaques and Anthony McGrath lifted Yorkshire with a third-wicket {{partnership}} of 310, 13 off the county record set in 1928, and although Jaques only added two to his overnight score of 217 {{before he was}} out caught, Yorkshire still amassed 570 thanks mainly to Ian Harvey and Craig White. Derbyshire spinners Ant Botha and Andy Gray got cheap wickets towards the end, as White was left stranded on 67 not out with the lower-order making insignificant contributions. However, Chris Silverwood and Richard Dawson chipped away at the Derbyshire batting line-up, taking two wickets each as Michael Di Venuto was fairly alone with his 79 and Derbyshire {{made their way to}} 247 for 7 at stumps on day 2. That {{turned out to be the}} score at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> 3 as well, rain preventing any play as the match moved closer to a draw. Derbyshire's late-order battled for another thirty overs before they were bundled out for 350, and despite Deon Kruis snaring two early wickets in the follow on, Derbyshire survived 60 overs to make 173 for 5 at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> four and save the draw.|$|E
25|$|MCC won the toss at Lord's and batted first. They struggled, with Ranjitsinhji top scoring with 60 and Howell taking 6/105. The Australians were 80/2 {{at the end}} of the day's play. Next day, Hill {{took his}} score to 136, made in 240 minutes, with support from Noble (70) and Gregory (86). At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> two, MCC were 23-1. Next day, only H.A. Carpenter (66) and E. Smith (48) {{resisted}} for long. Armstrong took 6/44.|$|E
25|$|England survived {{until the}} <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> 4 without loss. For the most part, they batted sensibly {{throughout}} day 5 to reach 369/6 {{by the close}} of play and secure themselves a draw. However, there were still questions about the technique {{of some of the}} batsmen, with Michael Vaughan, Kevin Pietersen and Ian Bell all falling to slightly injudicious shots. Pietersen scored another test century, which was the main contributor to ensuring the draw by the close of play.|$|E
