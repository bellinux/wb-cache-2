2500|$|Most serious {{competitive}} stations log their contest contacts using contest logging software, {{although some}} {{continue to use}} paper and pencil. [...] There are many different software logging programs written specifically for radio contesting. [...] Computer logging programs can handle many additional duties besides simply recording the log data; they can keep a running score based upon the formula of the contest, track which available multipliers have been [...] "worked" [...] and which have not, and provide the operator with visual clues about how many contacts are being made on which bands. Some contest software even provide a means to control the station equipment via computer, retrieve data from the radio and send pre-recorded morse code, voice or <b>digital</b> <b>messages.</b> [...] After {{the conclusion of a}} contest, each station must submit its operational log to the contest sponsor. [...] Many sponsors accept logs by e-mail, by upload on web sites, or even by postal mail.|$|E

50|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of datalink in aviation, all communication between the aircraft and ground personnel was performed by the flight crew using voice communication, using either VHF or HF voice radios. In many cases, the voice-relayed information involved dedicated radio operators and <b>digital</b> <b>messages</b> sent to an airline teletype system or successor systems.|$|E
50|$|CPDLC: controller-pilot {{data link}} {{communications}} - allows <b>digital</b> <b>messages</b> {{to be sent}} between controllers and pilots, avoiding the need to use radiotelephony.
