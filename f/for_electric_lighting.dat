25|$|To reduce {{operating}} energy use, designers use {{details that}} reduce air leakage {{through the building}} envelope (the barrier between conditioned and unconditioned space). They also specify high-performance windows and extra insulation in walls, ceilings, and floors. Another strategy, passive solar building design, is often implemented in low-energy homes. Designers orient windows and walls and place awnings, porches, and trees to shade windows and roofs during the summer while maximizing solar gain in the winter. In addition, effective window placement (daylighting) can provide more natural light and lessen the need <b>for</b> <b>electric</b> <b>lighting</b> during the day. Solar water heating further reduces energy costs.|$|E

In 1878, the Ganz factory, Budapest, Hungary, began manufacturing equipment <b>for</b> <b>electric</b> <b>lighting</b> and, by 1883, had installed over fifty systems in Austria-Hungary.
