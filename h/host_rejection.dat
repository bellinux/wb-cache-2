40|$|Ovicide, superparasitism and <b>host</b> <b>rejection</b> are {{alternative}} reproductive tactics facing female parasitoid wasps encountering an already-parasitized host. Superparasitism {{is simply}} the addition of an egg or a clutch of eggs by the secondary parasitoid, but under ovicide the primary clutch is removed or destroyed. <b>Host</b> <b>rejection</b> occurs if the wasp leaves without laying a clutch. The ectoparasitoid Laelius pedatus (Say) (Hymenoptera: Bethylidae) performs ovicide in this situation. Clutch manipulation experiments show that secondary clutches suffer high mortality in competition with primary clutches, which increases with increasing time delay between clutches. Primary clutches however suffer little in competition with secondary clutches, {{even if there is}} minimal time delay between clutches. These data suggest that the offspring of ovicidal females are substantially fitter than the offspring of superparasitizing females. Handling time and clutch size do not differ significantly between first (sole) parasitoids and second (ovicidal) parasitoids. The same is true for offspring survival and development time. However, offspring of second females are slightly smaller. This suggests that parasitized and unparasitized hosts are resources of similar quality when ovicide is performed. These data strongly support the predictions of evolutionary models of ovicide. They may also give some insight into the taxonomic distribution of ovicide in parasitoids...|$|E

The chondrogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) has been demonstrated to be induced by collagen-based hydrogels in vivo, but whether the induction is material-driven or self-differentiation has not been elucidated. In the present study, BMSCs were encapsulated in porous materials, namely, a biphasic calcium phosphate ceramic (BCP), silk fibroin protein matrix (SFP) and collagen sponge (CS), to further study the chondrogenic effects of various mate-rials. Diffusion chambers that allow the body fluid to permeate and deter the host cells from invasion were also loaded with the cell-scaffold constructs. Chambers containing the scaffold-BMSC composites were implanted subcutaneously in the dorsa of rabbits. The specimens in the chamber were harvested for histological and immunohistochemical analyses eight weeks after implantation. The results showed that no chondrogenic differentiation of the BMSCs occurred when the BMSCs were encapsulated in BCP, SFP and CS, indicating that chondrogenesis induced by materials is material-dependent and that these particular porous materials are not suitable for inducing chondrogenesis.

40|$|Background: Donor Lymphocyte Infusion (DLI) is a well-recognized {{tool for}} {{augmentation}} of the anti-leukemia effect after mismatched bone marrow transplantation. Experimental results show, however, that DLI efficacy is strongly {{dependent on the}} number of donor hematopoietic cells persisting in recipient after transplantation. It is strong in mixed chimeras and relatively weak in full chimeras (FC) that replace host antigen-presenting cells by donor antigen-presenting cells. In this study we applied a new in vivo cytotoxicity monitoring method for evaluation of the changes in FC anti-host immunity after co-transplantation of donor and host hematopoietic cells together. Method: Full hematopoietic chimeras and naïve control mice were transplanted with a mixture of equivalent numbers of donor and recipient or donor and third party splenocytes labeled by a cell-permeable fluorescent dye CFDA-SE. The animals were sacrificed at various time points, and their splenocyte suspensions were prepared, depleted of red blood cells, stained with allophycocyanin-labeled anti-H 2 b antibodies, and analyzed using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The immune response was assessed according to the percentage of single positive CFDA-SE+/ H 2 b- cells of all CFDA-SE+ cells. Results: FC grafted with splenocytes from similar FC mixed with splenocytes from naïve host-type or third-party-type mice rejected host cells within 14 days, and third-party cells within 7 days. NK cell depletion in vivo had no influence on <b>host</b> cell <b>rejection</b> kinetics. Co-infusion of host-type splenocytes with splenocytes obtained from naïve donor-type mice resulted in significant acceleration of <b>host</b> cell <b>rejection</b> (10 days). Naïve mice rejected the same amount of allogeneic lymphocytes within 3 days. Conclusions: Proposed method provides a simple and sensitive tool to evaluate in vivo post-transplant cytotoxicity in different experimental settings. The method demonstrates that FC is specifically deficient in their ability to reject host lymphocytes even when antigen-presenting host cells are provided. DLI improve anti-host immune response in FC but can not restore it to the level observed in naïve donor-type mice...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Why do brood {{parasitic}} Vidua nestlings {{mimic the}} intricate gape patterns of their hosts ’ young so precisely? The classic {{explanation is that}} mimicry is {{the outcome of a}} coevolutionary arms race, driven by <b>host</b> <b>rejection</b> of odd-looking offspring. Selection favors para-sitic nestlings that converge on the host young’s mouth markings, and simultaneously benefits hosts whose mouth markings diverge from those of the parasite. The outcome is highly elaborate mouth markings in host young that are accurately mimicked by parasite nestlings. Our review of recent work provides mixed support for this traditional view and, instead suggest that complex mouth markings function to stimulate adequate provisioning, rather than to signal species identity. Thus, similarly elaborate gape morphologies in hosts and parasites could have evolved through nestling competition for parental care. According to this view, and in contrast with existing hypotheses, it is host young that mimic parasitic offspring, in order to compete effectively for food...|$|E

In a binomial general linear mixed model procedure, we quantified the possible influence of host clutch size, cuckoo parasitism in population (yes/no), height of the nest above ground, height of vegetation {{in the vicinity of}} the nest and distance to nearest vantage point on rejection of an experimentally added nonmimetic cuckoo sized egg. In addition, we entered "population" into the models as a random factor. Rejection rate varied significantly among populations (range 4. 8 [...] 68. 9 %). The most parsimonious model, based on selection by the Akaike information criterion, included cuckoo parasitism in the population (yes/no) and <b>host</b> clutch size; <b>rejection</b> rate was the highest in parasitized populations, and individuals laying larger clutches were the best rejecters.
