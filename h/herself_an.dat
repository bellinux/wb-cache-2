25|$|Christina was {{interested}} in theatre, especially the plays of Pierre Corneille; she was <b>herself</b> <b>an</b> amateur actress. In 1647 the Italian architect Antonio Brunati was ordered to build a theatrical setting {{in one of the}} larger rooms of the palace.

25|$|The show also covered {{many social}} issue storylines, {{including}} sexual assault, mental illness, and alcoholism. When Lorna was raped {{after a night}} of heavy drinking, viewers watched as she dealt with the aftermath of her brutal attack.

Cass and Frankie were devastated when their daughter, Charlie (Lindsay Fabes), became ill. Luckily, she recovered, but Cass had begun acting strangely. He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, which had been triggered by Charlie's illness. Again, viewers were informed: they learned both the symptoms of the illness and how to treat it by watching Cass see a counselor and start to take medication. Felicia had begun drinking heavily after Lucas's death, but she refused to call <b>herself</b> <b>an</b> alcoholic. After her friends staged an intervention, she found help through Alcoholics Anonymous.|$|E
