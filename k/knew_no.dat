5|$|Two of Vermigli's {{former colleagues}} in Lucca—Lacizi and Tremellius—would {{join him in}} Strasbourg. In 1544 he was elected canon of St. Thomas Church, Strasbourg. In 1545 Vermigli married his first wife, Catherine Dammartin, a former nun from Metz. Catherine <b>knew</b> <b>no</b> Italian, and Peter very little German, so {{it is assumed that}} they conversed in Latin.|$|E
5|$|Mary sent William Maitland of Lethington as an {{ambassador}} to the English court to put the case for Mary as the heir presumptive to the English throne. Elizabeth refused to name a potential heir, fearing that {{to do so would}} invite conspiracy to displace her with the nominated successor. However, Elizabeth assured Maitland that she <b>knew</b> <b>no</b> one with a better claim than Mary. In late 1561 and early 1562, arrangements were made for the two queens to meet in England at York or Nottingham in August or September 1562, but Elizabeth sent Sir Henry Sidney to cancel in July because of the civil war in France.|$|E
5|$|Nri people {{believed}} that the sun was the dwelling place of Anyanwu (Light) and Agbala (Fertility). Agbala was the collective spirit of all holy beings (human and nonhuman). Agbala was the perfect agent of Chukwu or Chineke (the Creator God) and chose its human and nonhuman agents only by their merit; it <b>knew</b> <b>no</b> politics. It transcended religion, culture and gender, and worked with the humble and the truthful. They believed Anyanwu, The Light, to be the symbol of human perfection that all must seek and Agbala was entrusted to lead man there.|$|E

5|$|Quintus of Smyrna, in {{a passage}} whose {{atmosphere}} Boitani describes as sad and elegiac, retains what for Boitani {{are the two}} important issues of the ancient story, that Troilus is doomed by Fate and that his failure to continue his line symbolises Troy's fall. In this case, {{there is no doubt}} that Troilus entered battle knowingly, for in the Posthomerica Troilus's armour is one of the funerary gifts after Achilles' own death. Quintus repeatedly emphasises Troilus's youth: he is beardless, virgin of a bride, childlike, beautiful, the most godlike of all Hecuba's children. Yet he was lured by Fate to war when he <b>knew</b> <b>no</b> fear and was struck down by Achilles' spear just as a flower or corn that has borne no seed is killed by the gardener.|$|E

25|$|In 1933, {{in a civil}} ceremony, Horowitz married Toscanini's {{daughter}} Wanda. Although Horowitz was Jewish and Wanda Catholic, {{this was}} not an issue, as neither was observant. As Wanda <b>knew</b> <b>no</b> Russian and Horowitz knew very little Italian, their primary language became French. They had one child, Sonia Toscanini Horowitz (1934–1975). It has never been determined whether her death in Geneva, from a drug overdose, was accidental or a suicide.|$|E

25|$|Before his appointment, Radcliffe {{had never}} visited India and <b>knew</b> <b>no</b> one there. To the British and the feuding {{politicians}} alike, this neutrality was {{looked upon as}} an asset; he {{was considered to be}} unbiased toward any of the parties, except of course Britain. Only his private secretary, Christopher Beaumont, was familiar with the administration and life in the Punjab. Wanting to preserve the appearance of impartiality, Radcliffe also kept his distance from Viceroy Mountbatten.|$|E
25|$|Louis {{had tried}} to become a canon regular, wanting to enter the Great St Bernard Hospice, but had been refused because he <b>knew</b> <b>no</b> Latin. Zélie, possessed of a strong, active temperament, wished to serve the sick, and had also {{considered}} entering consecrated life, but the prioress of the canonesses regular of the Hôtel-Dieu in Alençon had discouraged her enquiry outright. Disappointed, Zélie learned the trade of lacemaking. She excelled in it and set up her own business on Rue Saint-Blaise at age 22.|$|E
25|$|Lord Peterborough {{was short}} in stature and spare in habit of body. His {{activity}} <b>knew</b> <b>no</b> bounds. He {{was said to}} have seen more kings and postilions than any man in Europe, and the whole point of Jonathan Swift's lines on Mordanto consisted in a description of the speed with which he hastened from capital to capital. He was eloquent in debate and intrepid in war, but his influence in the senate was ruined through his inconsistency, and his vigour in the field was wasted through his want of union with his colleagues.|$|E

25|$|As their {{communities}} grew, {{women and men}} shared leadership of the Shaker communities. Women preached and received revelations as the Spirit fell upon them. Thriving on the religious enthusiasm {{of the first and}} second Great Awakenings, the Shakers declared their messianic, communitarian message with significant response. One early convert observed: “The wisdom of their instructions, the purity of their doctrine, their Christ-like deportment, and the simplicity of their manners, all appeared truly apostolical.” The Shakers represent a small but important Utopian response to the gospel. Preaching in {{their communities}} <b>knew</b> <b>no</b> boundaries of gender, social class, or education.|$|E
25|$|Icelandic scholar Grímur Jónsson Thorkelin {{made the}} first transcriptions of the {{manuscript}} in 1786 and published the results in 1815, working {{as part of a}} Danish government historical research commission. He made one himself, and had another done by a professional copyist who <b>knew</b> <b>no</b> Anglo-Saxon. Since that time, however, the manuscript has crumbled further, making these transcripts a prized witness to the text. While the recovery of at least 2000 letters can be attributed to them, their accuracy has been called into question, {{and the extent to which}} the manuscript was actually more readable in Thorkelin's time is uncertain.|$|E
25|$|The {{areas of}} {{southeast}} Manitoba where Steinbach was later founded, were originally {{lands of the}} nomadic Ojibway-speaking Anishinabe people. They used their traditional lands for hunting, fishing, and trapping. The Anishinabe <b>knew</b> <b>no</b> borders {{at the time and}} their land ranged both north and south of the US–Canada border, and both east and west of the Red River. On 3 August 1871 the Anishinabe people signed Treaty 1 and moved onto reserves such as the Brokenhead Indian Reserve and Roseau River Anishinabe First Nation Reserve. Shortly thereafter the government began surveying and staking out the land for the East Reserve (now the R.M. of Hanover).|$|E

25|$|Healy {{seemed to}} believe that he had been awarded the Governor-Generalship for life. However, the Executive Council of the Irish Free State decided in 1927 that the term of office of Governors-General would be five years. As a result, he retired from the office and public life in January 1928. His wife had died the {{previous}} year. He published his extensive two-volume memoirs in 1928. Throughout his life he was formidable because he was ferociously quick-witted, because he was unworried by social or political convention, and because he <b>knew</b> <b>no</b> party discipline. Towards {{the end of his life}} he mellowed and became otherwise more diplomatic.|$|E
25|$|One {{night while}} working the late shift, he killed a man. Authorities briefly arrested him, but Quantrill {{claimed that he}} had acted in self-defense. Since there were no eyewitnesses and the victim was a {{stranger}} who <b>knew</b> <b>no</b> one in town, William was set free. Nevertheless, the police strongly urged him to leave Mendota. Quantrill continued {{his career as a}} teacher, moving to Fort Wayne, Indiana in February 1856. The district was impressed with Quantrill's teaching abilities, but unfortunately the wages remained meager. Quantrill journeyed back home to Canal Dover that fall, with no more money in his pockets than when he had left.|$|E
25|$|One of {{his star}} {{students}} was Rabbi Shlomo Wahrman, a tremendous Torah scholar {{who came from}} Leipzig for fifteen years {{and went on to}} becoming principal and Rosh Yeshiva of the Hebrew Academy of Nassau County. Rabbi Wahrman attributes his success to Rabbi Silver’s insistence and encouragement to hone his writing skills and record his copious chidushei Torah. Rabbi Wahrman writes in the short biography he published on Rabbi Silver:I remember at times he screamed at me for lack of understanding-however, even then I sensed his great love and concern for me and not the slightest hint of hatred. Rabbi Silver was a man whose very essence was giving to others-his ahavas yisroel (love for his fellow Jew) <b>knew</b> <b>no</b> bounds…he saw every Jew as an extension of himself.|$|E

25|$|Cuvier {{spent an}} {{additional}} {{four years at}} the Caroline Academy in Stuttgart, where he excelled {{in all of his}} coursework. Although he <b>knew</b> <b>no</b> German on his arrival, after only nine months of study, he managed to win the school prize for that language. Upon graduation, he had no money on which to live as he awaited appointment to an academic office. So in July 1788, he took a job at Fiquainville chateau in Normandy as tutor to the only son of the Comte d'Héricy, a Protestant noble. There, during the early 1790s, he began his comparisons of fossils with extant forms. Cuvier regularly attended meetings held at the nearby town of Valmont for the discussion of agricultural topics. There, he became acquainted with Henri Alexandre Tessier (1741–1837), who had assumed a false identity. Previously, he had been a physician and well-known agronomist, who had fled the Terror in Paris. After hearing Tessier speak on agricultural matters, Cuvier recognized him as the author of certain articles on agriculture in the Encyclopédie Méthodique and addressed him as M. Tessier.|$|E
