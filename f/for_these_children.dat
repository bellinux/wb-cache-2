25|$|The Derg's (1976) Proclamation No: 103 had public {{ownership}} of schools {{consistent with the}} socialist system. This still left a few private schools for children of politicians and wealthy families resulting in a higher quality of education <b>for</b> <b>these</b> <b>children</b> than for all others. Primary schooling expanded throughout the country with national enrolment reaching 34.1%. There were still regional disparities with more resources going to the south than to the north. Educational quality decreased with expansion largely due to resource scarcity. The Derg tried to resolve the problem of teacher shortage by recruiting 5,500 untrained teachers from those who had completed grade 12. These teachers had to attend government designed summer schools for three years to obtain certification.|$|E
500|$|To Marianne Hirsch, Spiegelman's life is [...] "dominated by {{memories}} {{that are not}} his own". [...] His work is one not of memory but of postmemory—a term she coined after encountering Maus. [...] This describes {{the relation of the}} children of survivors with the survivors themselves. [...] While these children have not had their parents' experiences, they grow up with their parents' memories—the memory of another's memory—until the stories become so powerful that <b>for</b> <b>these</b> <b>children</b> they become memories in their own right. [...] The children's proximity creates a [...] "deep personal connection" [...] with the memory, though separated from it by [...] "generational distance".|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} part of the 1910s, there was an urgent need for medical {{facilities}} to treat infants in South Australia since, due to the risks of cross-infection, the Adelaide Children's Hospital would not treat those under the age of two. In 1913, Mayo and Stirling called a meeting of medical practitioners to discuss the prospect of a hospital <b>for</b> <b>these</b> <b>children.</b> [...] After doubts about the practicality of such a plan were expressed, the group raised some funds and presented to the board of the Adelaide Children's Hospital a plan to use the funds to build a separate ward on the grounds of the hospital. The board rejected the proposal, so Mayo and her group rented a two-story house in St. Peter's and opened a hospital for infants in 1914. Financial difficulties for the hospital eventually became overwhelming and the state government took over the hospital, moving it to Woodville and renaming it the Mareeba Hospital.|$|E

Other pastors and Christian activists strongly oppose such accusations and try to rescue children from their unscrupulous colleagues.

2500|$|The late 19th century {{marked the}} era of social reforms {{directed}} at children. It was due to these social reforms {{that the need for}} school psychologists emerged. These social reforms included compulsory schooling, juvenile courts, child labor laws as well as a growth of institutions serving children. Society was starting to [...] "change the 'meaning of children' from an economic source of labor to a psychological source of love and affection". Historian Thomas Fagan argues that the preeminent force behind the need for school psychology was compulsory schooling laws. Prior to the compulsory schooling law, only 20% of school aged children completed elementary school and only 8% completed high school. Due to the compulsory schooling laws, there was an influx of students with mental and physical defects who were required by law to be in school. There needed to be an alternative method of teaching for these different children. Between 1910 and 1914, schools in both rural and urban areas created small special education classrooms <b>for</b> <b>these</b> <b>children.</b> From the emergence of special education classrooms came the need for [...] "experts" [...] to help assist in the process of child selection for special education. Thus, school psychology was founded.|$|E
2500|$|One of the {{earliest}} hostings of Serbian children recorded in the media dates to late 1995 when 50 Bosnian Serb children from Zvornik spent Christmas and New Year's with Greek families. [...] Another 50 Bosnian Serb children from the same town arrived in Thessaloniki on 10 January 1996 for a two-week vacation with families in Kavala and Imathia. In July 1998, a total of 540 orphans and children of refugees from Republika Srpska and Serbia left for Greece and were hosted over the summer by various municipalities and communities in the country. It was the fourth hosting mission that had been organized by the Central Union of Municipalities and Communities of Greece {{in cooperation with the}} Red Cross that year. In total, the Central Union of Municipalities and Communities of Greece had been responsible for hosting more than 2,000 Serbian children by that point. [...] Greek Ambassador to Belgrade Panayiotis Vlassopoulos stated that hospitality <b>for</b> <b>these</b> <b>children</b> in Greece constituted only a portion of the humanitarian aid which Greek local governments and organizations have been providing for Yugoslavia since war erupted. He added that these initiatives contribute to the strengthening of Greek–Serbian relations. In 1999, the Yugoslav Red Cross and a Greek-Serb friendship society organized the hosting of {{children between the ages of}} 8 and 12 by families in Kavala for a nine-month period. The children were accompanied by their teachers so that they'd be able to keep up with their studies.

Creed was dead, however. His widow was a pew-opener in the cathedral hard by; his eldest son was a little scamp of a choir-boy, who played toss-halfpenny, led his little brothers into mischief, and had a voice as sweet as an angel. A couple of the latter were sitting on the door-step, down which you went into the passage of the house; and they jumped up with great alacrity to meet their lodger, and plunged wildly, and rather to Pen's surprise, at the swallow-tails of the Captain's dress-coat; for the truth is, that the good-natured gentleman, when he was in cash, generally brought home an apple or a piece of gingerbread <b>for</b> <b>these</b> <b>children.</b> [...] "Whereby the widdy never pressed me for rint when not convanient," [...] as he remarked afterwards to Pen, winking knowingly, and laying a finger on his nose.|$|E
60|$|Besides these fierce, deadly {{contests}} {{among the}} knights and nobles, {{the ladies of}} the court had their feuds and quarrels too. They were often divided into cliques and parties, and were full of envyings, jealousies, and resentments against each other. One {{of the most serious}} of these difficulties was occasioned by a marriage of the Duke of Lancaster, which took place toward the close of his life. This was his third marriage, he having been successively married to two ladies of high rank before. The lady whom he now married was of a comparatively humble station in life. She was the daughter of a foreign knight. Her name, originally, was Catharine de Rouet. She had been, in her early life, a maiden in attendance on the Duchess of Lancaster, the duke's second wife. While she was in his family the duke formed a guilty intimacy with her, which was continued for a long time. They had three children. The duke provided well <b>for</b> <b>these</b> <b>children,</b> and gave them a good education. After a time, the duke, becoming tired of her, arranged for her to be married to a certain knight named Swinton, and she lived with this knight for some time, until at length he died, and Catharine became a widow.|$|E
