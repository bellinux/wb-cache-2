[...] They advanced a reading of this language would suggest a Congressional limitation to the military power would assure an appropriately narrow range of detainees and that the power to detain would last only so long as the Congressional authorization was not revoked or remained in effect by its terms. Similarly, they noted that the Yaser Hamdi Supreme Court case (Hamdi v.

5000|$|Madisons Nightmare is {{the major}} {{synthesis}} of Shane’s separation of powers views. It both describes and analyzes the {{theory and practice of}} [...] "presidentialism" [...] as they unfolded from 1981 to 2009. He describes the period of 1981 to 2009 as a time of aggressive presidentialism. Presidents Ronald Reagan through George W. Bush made arguments for unilateral presidential authority that Shane characterizes as unprecedented and legally groundless. These arguments (and the actual assertions of power they supported) went so far beyond the claims of prior presidents as to constitute a new and distinctive phenomenon. Shanes critique, however, goes beyond his attack on presidentialism as legal doctrine. He also argues that presidentialism, as an operating ethos of government, undermines sound decision making {{and the rule of law}} in executive branch affairs. He illustrates many of his points through examples <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> 43 <b>Administration,</b> but argues that his analysis transcends party. His view is that, for presidents of either party, presidentialism can subvert the quality of decision making, policy makers attentiveness to law, and democratic accountability more generally. http://www.acslaw.org/node/13477 ...|$|R
