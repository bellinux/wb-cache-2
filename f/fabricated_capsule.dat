In this study, {{we present a}} technique for encapsulating aqueous drops in a modified calcium alginate membrane made from an emulsion of silicone oil and aqueous alginate solution and explore {{its effect on the}} loss of water from the capsule cores. The capsule membrane storage modulus increases as the initial concentration of oil in the emulsion is increased. The water barrier properties of the <b>fabricated</b> <b>capsules</b> were determined by observing the mass loss of capsules in a controlled environment. It was found that capsules made with emulsions containing 50 wt% silicone oil were robust while taking at least twice the time to dry completely as compared to capsules made from only an aqueous alginate solution.

The <b>capsules</b> are <b>fabricated</b> by directed assembly of block copolymers at the interfaces of a double emulsion template and electrostatic adsorption of particles onto the copolymers. The double emulsion drops are prepared using capillary-based microfluidics. The solvent phase of the double emulsion is then evaporated to yield polymersomes.

40|$|Bioencapsulation {{involves}} the envelopment of tissues or biological active substances in semipermeable membranes. Bioencapsulation {{has been shown}} to be efficacious in mimicking the cell's natural environment and thereby improves the efficiency of production of different metabolites and therapeutic agents. The field of application is broad. It is being applied in bioindustry and biomedicine. it is clinically applied for the treatment of a wide variety of endocrine diseases. During the past decades many procedures to <b>fabricate</b> <b>capsules</b> have been described. Unfortunately, most of these procedures lack an adequate documentation of the characterization of the biocapsules. As a result many procedures show an extreme lab-to-lab variation and many results cannot be adequately reproduced. The characterization of capsules can no longer be neglected, especially since new clinical trials with bioencapsulated therapeutic cells have been initiated and the industrial application of bioencapsulation is growing. In the present review we discuss novel Approached to produce and characterize biocapsules in view of clinical and industrial application. A dominant factor in bioencapsulation is selection and characterization of suitable polymers. We present the adequacy of using high-resolution NMR for characterizing polymers. These polymers are applied for producing semipermeable membranes. We present the pitfalls of the currently applied methods and provide recommendations for standardization to avoid lab-to-lab variations. Also, we compare and present methodologies to produce biocompatible biocapsules for specific fields of applications and we demonstrate how physico-chemical technologies such as FT-IR, XPS, and TOF-SIMS contribute to reproducibility and standardization of the bioencapsulation process. During recent years it has become more and more clear that bioencapsulation requires a multidisciplinary approach in which biomedical, physical, and chemical technologies are combined. For adequate reproducibility and for understanding variations in outcome of biocapsules it is advisable if not mandatory to include the characterization processes presented in this review in future studies.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{present a}} new type of {{microcapsule}} programmed with a tunable active release mechanism. The capsules are triggered by a plasticizing stimulus that induces a phase change transition of the polymeric membrane from a solid to a fluidized form; thereafter, the cargo is actively driven out of the capsule through a defect at the capsule wall with controllable release kinetics. Tuning the degree of membrane fluidity by tailoring the amount of plasticizing stimulus present allows us to obtain temporal variation of the release kinetics from a subsecond abrupt burst release to a slow sustained release of encapsulant over many minutes. Moreover, we demonstrate tuning of the collective capsule triggering response by adjusting stimulus content, polymer molecular weight, and capsule membrane thickness. For this model system, we use a microfluidic approach to <b>fabricate</b> polystyrene <b>capsules</b> triggered by a toluene stimulus.

Full fibers of cellulose {{have been used in}} many products such as plastics and textiles for over a century and a half, but recently, modern extraction techniques have made it possible to investigate uses for minuscule cellulose fibers (Habibi, Lucia, Rojas 2010). Through acid hydrolysis, cellulose fibers become rod-like nanostructures with a high aspect ratio that are known as Cellulose Nanocrystals (CNCs) (Habibi, Lucia, Rojas 2010). Since CNCs are biodegradable and derive from a renewable resource, finding ways to organize CNCs into capsules and particles is a topic of interest, particularly for the medical industry (Gravesen, Branebjerg, Jensen 1993). For this project, CNC particles and capsules were designed and fabricated from single and double emulsion drops generated in microcapillary microfluidic devices. The dispersion of CNC nanofibers in DI-H 2 O was also studied to ensure uniformity in the drops. The influence of sonication on the CNC surface charge, and the corresponding rheological properties of the suspensions were studied via rheological and zetapotential measurements. Microcapillary microfluidic devices composed of a coaxial-arrangement of round and square capillaries were fabricated.

40|$|The layer-by-layer (LbL) {{polyelectrolyte}} self-assembly {{encapsulation method}} has attracted much interest {{because of its}} versatility to use various polymers for capsule formation, ability to encapsulate different templates, and capability to control capsule permeability. Traditionally, the LbL method was performed in water as solvent and limited to poorly or non-water-soluble templates. Using the matrix-assisted LbL method, complex mixtures of water-soluble proteins or DNA could be encapsulated within agarose microbeads templates but leakage of biomolecules into the water phase during the LbL process results in low encapsulation efficiency. Recently, the reverse-phase LbL (RP-LbL) method was introduced to perform LbL and encapsulation of water-soluble templates in organic solvents, thus preventing the templates from dissolving and allowing high encapsulation efficiency. However, encapsulation of complex mixtures of biomolecules or other substances with quantitative encapsulation efficiency remained impossible. Here we present a new approach for encapsulation of biomolecules or complex mixtures thereof with almost 100 % encapsulation efficiency. The ability of our method to achieve high encapsulation efficiency arises from the combination of two strategies. (1) Using microparticles as surface stabilizer to create stable biomolecule-loaded hydrogel microbeads, termed matrix-assisted colloidosome (MAC), {{that are able to}} disperse in oil and organic solvents. (2) Using the RP-LbL method to <b>fabricate</b> polymeric <b>capsule</b> "membranes", thereby preventing diffusion of the highly water-soluble biomolecules.

A design-of-experiments (DOE) approach was used to characterize a glow-discharge-polymerization coater built at LLE to <b>fabricate</b> smooth, stress-free <b>capsules</b> with submicron wall thicknesses.

In addition, a two-parameter interaction between the total pressure and the RF power also affects the coating rate. The film stress depends on the total chamber pressure and the total mass-flow rate.

All our devices were made of standard wall borosilicate capillaries (OD 1. 0 mm, ID 0. 58 mm), steel dispensing needles without bevel (30 G, 32 G), microscopy glass slides, fast-curing epoxy glue (Araldite- 80805) and diamond scribe to process the glass. We designed four different geometries for each device, which can be separated for two groups: single and double droplet generators. The performance of the devices was validated using computational fluid dynamics and laboratory experiments. First of all, we tried to fabricate intricate single emulsion droplets and {{then moved on to}} double emulsion droplets. The range of the <b>fabricated</b> particles and <b>capsules</b> includes anisotropically-shaped amphiphilic polymer “microbuckets”, biphasic particles, capsules with various fillers and stimuli responsive polymer vesicles. To produce such objects we employed different functional monomers, for instance “clickable” glycidyl methacrylate or hydrophilic 2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate. We also utilized several chemical and physical phenomena such as internal phase separation, wettability or polymer chain cross-linking to tune the properties of the synthesized particles. We investigated properties of the above mentioned particles and capsules. For example, “microbuckets” which are hydrophilic at the exterior surface, but hydrophobic inside the cavity, were able to withdraw oil droplets from an aqueous phase and “arrest” them inside the cavity...|$|R
40|$|The Off-Site Source Recovery (OSR) Project at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) recovers {{and manages}} excess and {{unwanted}} radioactive sealed sources and other radioactive materials that present {{a risk to}} public health, safety and national security; and for which no disposal options currently exist. Due to their age, a lack of available manufacturer data and unknown origin, or the potential for leakage, some of the radioactive sealed sources targeted for recovery by the OSR Project do not meet US Department of Transportation (US DOT) Type A requirements. Sealed sources that are special form can be shipped using US DOT Type A, 7 A packages, which provide increased flexibility in shipping. In 2000, the OSR Project developed a sealed source overpack called the LANL Special Form Capsule (SFC) Model I to provide a method to ensure US DOT special form containment of radioactive sealed sources during transport. A key feature of the SFC was {{that it could be}} easily assembled in the field and allowed sealed sources which did not have current special form certification or documentation for domestic transport to be made special form by field encapsulation in a LANL SFC. After successful testing of the Model I and Model II, it was decided to <b>fabricate</b> a third <b>capsule</b> to accommodate the many source sizes. The Model III, with an internal diameter of 1. 5 inches was then fabricated and tested. This third model of the LAN...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper was}} {{presented}} at the 3 rd Micro and Nano Flows Conference (MNF 2011), which was held at the Makedonia Palace Hotel, Thessaloniki in Greece. The conference was organised by Brunel University and supported by the Italian Union of Thermofluiddynamics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, University of Thessaly, IPEM, the Process Intensification Network, the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, the Heat Transfer Society, HEXAG - the Heat Exchange Action Group, and the Energy Institute. We have designed a microfluidic system that combines a double flow-focusing setup for calibrated capsule fabrication with a microchannel for the characterization of their mechanical properties. The double flow-focusing system consists of a first Y junction to create the microdroplets and of a second Y junction to introduce the cross-linking agent allowing the membrane formation. The human serum albumin (HSA) aqueous solution for the dispersed solution, hydrophobic phase for the continuous solution and cross-linking agent solution are introduced by means of syringe pumps. A wavy channel after the second junction allows to control the reticulation time. A cylindrical microchannel then enables to deform and characterize the capsules formed. The mechanical properties of the capsule membrane are obtained by inverse analysis (Chu et al. 2011). The results show that the drop size increases with the flow rate ratio between the central and lateral channels and does not change much regardless of the flow rate of the reticulation phase. The mean shear modulus of the <b>capsules</b> <b>fabricated</b> after 23 s of reticulation is of the order of the surface tension of HSA solution with Dragoxat indicating that the reticulation time is too short to form an elastic membrane around the droplet. When the reticulation time is increased to 60 s, the membrane shear modulus is multiplied by a factor of 3 confirming that a solid membrane has formed around the drop...|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{energy storage}} (TES) {{is one of}} the most {{attractive}} and cost effective solutions to the intermittent generation systems like solar, wind and other renewable sources, compared to alternatives. It creates a bridge between the power supply and demand during peak hours or at times of emergency to ensure the continuous supply of energy. Among all the TES systems, latent heat thermal energy storage (LHTES) draws lots of interests as it has high energy density and can store or retrieve energy isothermally. Two major technical challenges associated with the LHTES are low thermal conductivity of the phase change materials (PCMs), and corrosion tendency of the containment vessel with the PCMs. Macro-encapsulation of the PCM {{is one of the}} techniques to encounter the low thermal conductivity issue as it will maximize the heat transfer area for the given volume of the PCM and restrict the PCMs to get in contact with the containment vessel. However, finding a suitable encapsulation technique that can address the volumetric expansion problem and compatible shell material are significant barriers of this approach. In the present work, an innovative technique to encapsulate PCMs that melt in the 100 - 350 oC temperature range was developed for industrial and private applications. This technique did not require a sacrificial layer to accommodate the volumetric expansion of the PCMs on melting. The encapsulation consisted of coating a non-reactive polymer over the PCM pellet followed by deposition of a metal layer by a novel non-vacuum metal deposition technique. The <b>fabricated</b> spherical <b>capsules</b> were tested in different heat transfer fluid (HTF) environments like air, oil and molten salt (solar salt). Thermophysical properties of the PCMs were investigated by DSC/TGA, IR and weight change analysis before and after the thermal cycling. Also, the constrained melting and solidification of sodium nitrate PCM inside the spherical capsules of different sizes were compared to explore the charging and discharging time. To accomplish this, three thermocouples were installed vertically inside the capsule at three equidistant positions. Low-density graphene was dispersed in the PCM to increase its conductivity and compared with pure PCM capsules. A laboratory scale packed-bed LHTES system was designed and built to investigate the performance of the capsules. Sodium nitrate (m. p. 306 oC) was used as the PCM and air was used as the heat transfer fluid (HTF). The storage system was operated between 286 oC and 326 oC and the volumetric flow rate of the HTF was varied from 110 m 3 /h to 151 m 3 /h. The temperature distribution along the bed (radially and axially) and inside the capsules was monitored continuously during charging and discharging of the system. The effect of the HTF mass flow rate on the charging and discharging time and on the pressure drop across the bed was evaluated. Also, the energy and exergy efficiencies were calculated for three different flow rates. Finally, a step-by-step trial manufacturing process was proposed to produce large number of spherical capsules...|$|R
40|$|Polyelectrolyte <b>capsules</b> <b>fabricated</b> by layer-by-layer (LbL) {{technique}} {{are introduced}} {{as a simple}} and efficient carrier system for spontaneous deposition of proteins and low molecular water soluble drug. The objective of the work {{was to investigate the}} applicability of polyelectrolyte capsules as vehicles for sustained or controlled delivery of drugs. Two different polymeric systems composed of weak and strong polyelectrolytes were chosen to study the loading and release behavior {{in order to meet the}} requirements of biomedical applications. In the first system, the wall permeability of weak polyelectrolyte (PAH/PMA) capsules could be readily manipulated from open to closed state by simply varying the pH. The open and closed state of the capsules could be attributed to the charge density variation of weak polyelectrolytes, which induces the capsule wall to undergo a transition from continuous to nanoporous morphology due to phase segregation. Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) was spontaneously deposited in the hollow capsules and deposition was investigated by CLSM, SEM and AFM techniques. The driving force for spontaneous deposition was electrostatic interaction between the preloaded polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) and BSA. The deposition was uniform and concentration of BSA in the capsule interior reached a few hundred times greater than that of bulk. The amount of loading was significantly influenced by the loading pH, loading concentration and charge density of substance to be loaded at the corresponding pH. The deposition was successful up to the isoelectric point of BSA (pH = 4. 8) and there was no loading observed above that, since the deposition is based on electrostatic attraction between PSS and BSA. During the release at physiological pH of 7. 4, charge reversal of BSA occurred which induced electrostatic repulsion between PSS and BSA thereby triggering the movement of BSA from the interior to the bulk. Release continued up to 5 h in water and a total release of 63 % was observed which increased to 72 % when release was performed in PBS. Spontaneous deposition of low molecular weight, water soluble drug, ciprofloxacin hydrochloride was performed in the same manner and its release profile was studied. Controlling diffusion of smaller drug molecules is extremely difficult in drug delivery applications. Cross linking of capsule wall components could be used to control the release rates of smaller drug molecules. Cross linking density is dependent on the cross linking time and increases the stiffness of the capsule wall. Release of ciprofloxacin hydrochloride was possible even up to 6 h after cross linking. Antibacterial studies showed that the drug released even after 25 h has a significant effect on the bacterial pathogen E. coli. The second system included weak and strong polyelectrolytes (PAH & DS) and a novel route was employed to <b>fabricate</b> optically addressable <b>capsules</b> that could be laser activated for delivery of drugs. This approach involved a combination of LbL assembly and polyol reduction method wherein PEG was used to reduce AgNO 3 to Ag nanoparticles (NPs). The capsules were prepared via LbL assembly of PAH and DS on silica template followed by synthesis of silver NPs in the layers and subsequent dissolution of the silica core. The sulfonate groups of DS present in the polyelectrolyte film act as binding sites for the adsorption of silver ions which are then reduced to silver NPs in the presence of PEG. The size of the silver NPs formed was influenced by the AgNO 3 concentration used. At lower concentration, smaller particles of uniform distribution were observed which turned into larger particles of random distribution when the concentration of AgNO 3 is increased. Silver NPs embedded capsules ruptured when exposed to laser and was significantly influenced by silver NPs size, their distribution, laser intensity and time of exposure. The synthesis of silver NPs increased the permeability of the capsules to higher molecular weight substances like dextran caused by the defects, discontinuities and pores created on the polymeric network due to the newly formed silver NPs. Encapsulation of FITC-dextran was performed using thermal encapsulation method by exploiting temperature induced shrinking of the capsules at elevated temperatures. During heat treatment the porous morphology transformed into smooth pore free structure which prevented the movement of dextran into the bulk and hence enrichment inside the capsules. The loaded dextran was readily released when exposed to laser and the release could be controlled from linear to burst release in order to meet practical requirements in biomedical applications...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decades, {{nanomedicine}} – {{the application of}} nanotechnology to medicine – has opened up an entirely new horizon of possibilities and applications, in particular for drug delivery and diagnostic. Indeed, {{a wide range of}} nanocarrier have been designed and realized. However, more recently researcher focused on the development of “multifunctional” platforms, i. e. nano-vectors able to simultaneously or sequentially perform several functionalities – enzymatic catalysis, controlled degradation, controlled drug release and sensing. In this context polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) <b>capsules</b> <b>fabricated</b> via the Layer-by-Layer (LbL) technique have emerged as very attractive tool for the assembly of multifunctional carrier systems, because of its ideal features like simplicity, versatility, and nanoscale control. The final aim of this research activity concerns the realization of completely biocompatible and biodegradable nanocarriers with diverse functionalities and purposes. The greater ambition, in particular, is the realization of nanometric sized drug vehicles entirely derived from natural materials but holding the features needed for the drug delivery. Starting from an inner oil-core carrier – with tunable sizes ranging from 80 to 200 nm, built up with natural materials like soybean oil and egg lecithin and able to encapsulate hydrophobic drugs or contrasting agents - oil-core polyelectrolytes-shells nanocarriers have been realized. As for the liquid core, natural materials have been selected for the realization of the shell, and, in particular, polysaccharides. More in detail, polysaccharides used as coating have been opportunely modified in order to add desired functionalities to the final nano-vectors. As matter of the fact, it was demonstrated how the thiolation of the nanocapsules’ surfaces, together with the appropriate choice of the materials, sizes and formulation, can positively effect on the oral delivery of an unstable nutraceutical, i. e. curcumin. Moreover, the modification of natural polyelectrolytes with thiol and olefin moieties allowed to covalently cross link the layers by applying a photo activated reaction, thiol-ene ‘click’ reaction: it was demonstrated that such strategy bring out to a final nano-system with enhanced biostability. Lastly, an in situ modification of heparin with an aminosilane allowed to apply a modified Stöber sol-gel method for the realization of a high versatile multilayered nanocarrier system featuring a hybrid polymer/silica-shell. All the designed and realized nanocapsules did not show any cytotoxic effect, so resulting completely biocompatible and, therefore, of interest for the nanomedicine fields...|$|R
