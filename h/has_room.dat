5|$|To defeat more {{powerful}} monsters and gain experience points efficiently, players can join a party. A regular party <b>has</b> <b>room</b> for six members. Like {{in many other}} games, a well-balanced party will consist of several archetypes- namely a healer, a tank (the party member with high defense {{that will be the}} main target of the monster), and the damage dealer. The enmity system comes into play heavily in parties, as players try to keep the monsters attention off fragile jobs and on the tanks. A well-balanced team working together {{is the only way to}} defeat many of the game's enemies.|$|E
5|$|The Sunwin Stand {{has further}} room for expansion, and is unusual because it only runs {{three-quarters of the}} length of the pitch.

25|$|Beekeepers may harvest honey from July until October, {{according}} to the honey flows in their area. Good management requires keeping the hive free of pests and disease, and ensuring that the bee colony <b>has</b> <b>room</b> in the hive to expand. Chemical treatments, if used for parasite control, must {{be done in the}} off-season to avoid any honey contamination. Exterminators therefore often offer bee-safe and honey-safe treatment methods targeted towards beekeepers. Success for the hobbyist also depends on locating the apiary so bees have a good nectar source and pollen source throughout the year.|$|E

25|$|The table below {{illustrates}} {{the capacity of}} a light rail train (the Siemens S70) {{compared to that of}} a standard car with five seats. The average length of a standard five-seat car is about 4.74 metres. The length of a Siemens S70 light rail vehicle is 27.7 meters, approximately the same length as 5.8 cars. The maximum occupancy of a five-seat automobile car is five people. The maximum capacity of the Siemens S70 is 220 people. This means that one metre in a car has a capacity of one person and one metre in a light rail vehicle has a capacity of almost eight persons, so the capacity of light rail is about eight times as high as that of an average consumer car, if only the length of the vehicles is taken into consideration. The average width of an automobile is about 1.77 metres, while the average width of the Siemens S70 is about 2.7 metres. The area of an average consumer car is about 8.4m², while the area taken up by a light rail car is about 74.8m². In an automobile car, each square metre <b>has</b> <b>room</b> for only 0.6 persons, while each square metre in a light rail car <b>has</b> <b>room</b> for 2.9 persons. This means that a light rail vehicle is significantly more capacity-effective than a consumer car is. Height is not taken into consideration, because it is not normally a problem given minimum-clearance regulations for underpasses.|$|E
