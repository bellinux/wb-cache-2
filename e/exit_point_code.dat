40|$|The {{attack surface}} concept {{provides}} a means of discussing the susceptibility of software to as-yet-unknown attacks. A system’s attack surface encompasses the methods the system makes available to an attacker, and the system resources {{which can be used}} to further an attack. A measurement {{of the size of the}} attack surface could be used to compare the security of multiple systems which perform the same function. The Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) has been in existence for over a decade. Relative to HTTP or SMTP, IMAP is a niche protocol, but IMAP servers are widely deployed nonetheless. There are three popular open source UNIX IMAP servers – UW-IMAP, Cyrus, and Courier-IMAP – and there has not been a formal security comparison between them. In this paper, I use attack surfaces to compare the relative security risks posed by these three products. I undertake this evaluation in service of two complementary goals: to provide an honest examination of the security postures and risks of the three servers, and to advance the study of attack surfaces by performing an automated attack surface measurement using a methodology based on counting entry and <b>exit</b> <b>points</b> in the <b>code...</b>|$|R

50|$|Another {{concept that}} Fusebox {{encourages}} is to parameterize any <b>exit</b> <b>points</b> {{in a web}} page, coding them as variables that are set in the circuit control file. These <b>exit</b> <b>points</b> are known as XFAs - eXit FuseActions. The idea is that by parameterizing the <b>exit</b> <b>points</b> in a web page, the flow of control can be updated more easily, allowing more reuse of web pages or fragments thereof.|$|R
50|$|Once the <b>exit</b> <b>point</b> on {{the level}} has been found, the player then must have one {{character}} collect the crystal and carry it slowly from the start to the <b>exit</b> <b>point,</b> while other characters protect the carrier from hordes of monsters that appear at this point. If the crystal carrier dies, the game is over, but if all surviving players {{make it to the}} room with the <b>exit</b> <b>point,</b> the player advances to the next level. The goal of the game is to complete 12 of these levels, each with more difficult monsters that appear, with at least one character carrying the crystal to the final <b>exit</b> <b>point.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{coupling}} {{of sandy}} beach aquifers with the swash {{zone in the}} vicinity of the water table <b>exit</b> <b>point</b> is investigated through simultaneous measurements of the instantaneous shoreline (swash front) location, pore pressures and the water table <b>exit</b> <b>point.</b> The field observations reveal new insights into swash-aquifer coupling not previously gleaned from measurements of pore pressure only. In particular, for the case where the <b>exit</b> <b>point</b> is seaward of the observation point, the pore pressure response is correlated with the distance between the <b>exit</b> <b>point</b> and the shoreline in that when the distance is large the rate of pressure drop is fast and when the distance is small the rate decreases. The observations expose limitations in a simple model describing <b>exit</b> <b>point</b> dynamics which is based only on the force balance on a particle of water at the sand surface and neglects subsurface pressures. A new modified form of the model is shown to significantly improve the model-data comparison through a parameterization of the effects of capillarity into the aquifer storage coefficient. The model enables sufficiently accurate predictions of the <b>exit</b> <b>point</b> to determine when the swash uprush propagates over a saturated or a partially saturated sand surface, potentially an important factor in the morphological evolution of the beach face. Observations of the shoreward propagation of the swash-induced pore pressure waves ahead of the runup limit shows that the magnitude of the pressure fluctuation decays exponentially and that there is a linear increase in time lags, behavior similar to that of tidally induced water table waves. The location of the <b>exit</b> <b>point</b> and the intermittency of wave runup events is also shown to be significant in terms of the shore-normal energy distribution. Seaward of the mean <b>exit</b> <b>point</b> location, peak energies are small because of the saturated sand surface within the seepage face acting as a "rigid lid 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 and limiting pressure fluctuations. Landward of the mean <b>exit</b> <b>point</b> the peak energies grow before decreasing landward of the maximum shoreline position...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{simultaneous}} {{measurements of}} the instantaneous shoreline (swash front) and the response of both the pore pressure and the water table <b>exit</b> <b>point</b> are presented and discussed. The new datasets reveal additional insights into swash-aquifer coupling not previously gleaned from measurements of pore pressure only. In particular, for the case where the <b>exit</b> <b>point</b> is seaward of the observation point, the pore pressure response correlates well with {{the distance between the}} <b>exit</b> <b>point</b> and the shoreline in that when the distance is large the rate of pressure drop is fast and when the distance is small the rate decreases. The observations expose limitations in the only existing theory describing the motion of the water table <b>exit</b> <b>point.</b> The theory is based only on the force balance on a particle of water at the sand surface and therefore neglects the effects of both sub-surface pressures and shoreline proximity. The model performance is greatly improved through a parameterisation of the effects of both capillarity and truncation of the capillary fringe {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>exit</b> <b>point.</b> These effects are parameterised as a reduction in the aquifer storage coefficient by three orders of magnitude. Observations of the propagation of the swash-induced pore pressure wave reveals behaviour similar to that found with tidally induced water table waves. That is, the magnitude of the pressure fluctuation decays exponentially and there is a linear increase in the time lag. The energy transfer of high frequency swash zone forcing to a low frequency response in the water table <b>exit</b> <b>point</b> and pore pressure is shown to be as a result of wave runup exceedance probabilities relative to the location of the water table <b>exit</b> <b>point.</b> Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EngineeringNo Full Tex...|$|R

40|$|The {{observed}} polarisation of {{the horizontal}} magnetic components of whistler mode signals received at Halley, Antarctica (L≈ 4. 3), {{is in many}} cases that expected from a simple model of the transionospheric and sub-ionospheric propagation in the southern hemisphere; i. e. right-hand elliptical (field vectors rotate clockwise, looking towards the source) for ionospheric <b>exit</b> <b>points</b> close to the receiver, tending towards linear for more distant <b>exit</b> <b>points.</b> This suggests {{it may be possible}} to use the observed polarisation to estimate the propagation distance. However, in other cases, in certain frequency ranges, left-hand elliptically polarised signals have been observed. More realistic models do predict polarisation reversals at certain frequencies and <b>exit</b> <b>point</b> to receiver distances, but not over such a wide frequency range as has sometimes been observed. Also, in some cases, signals with nearly right-hand circular polarisation have been observed for <b>exit</b> <b>points</b> at large distances where linear polarisation would be expected...|$|R

In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm called the Safe Exit Algorithm (SEA), which can efficiently compute the safe <b>exit</b> <b>points</b> of a moving nearest neighbor (NN) query on road networks. The safe region of a query {{is an area where}} the query result remains unchanged, provided that the query remains inside the safe region At each safe <b>exit</b> <b>point,</b> the safe region of a query and its non-safe region meet so that a set of safe <b>exit</b> <b>points</b> represents the border of the safe region. Before reaching a safe <b>exit</b> <b>point,</b> the client (query object) does not have to request the server to re-evaluate the query This significantly reduces the server processing costs and the communication costs between the server and moving clients.
