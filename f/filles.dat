5|$|Fabian Cancellara {{held the}} lead of the race {{throughout}} its opening Belgian leg; having won the race-commencing prologue, Cancellara defended it on the following two stages before the race returned to France. Cancellara maintained his overall lead {{for the rest of the}} race's first week, before eventually losing time on the first true mountain stage of the race – stage seven – as he was dropped on the closing climb to La Planche des Belles <b>Filles.</b> As a result, Bradley Wiggins assumed the maillot jaune, becoming the first British rider to wear the jersey since 2000. Wiggins maintained the lead for the following three stages, including his first victory at the Tour during the ninth stage individual time trial in Besançon. Wiggins held a lead of almost two minutes in the overall standings with the more mountainous second half of the Tour still to race. Two riders won multiple stages during the first half of the race; Peter Sagan, in his first Tour de France, won three stages and also held {{the lead of}} the points classification, while André Greipel took back-to-back stage victories on the fourth and fifth stages. World champion Mark Cavendish achieved one stage victory, while French riders Thibaut Pinot and Thomas Voeckler each took breakaway victories.|$|E

25|$|An early {{problem in}} {{recruitment}} was the women's {{adjustment to the}} new agricultural life. As Saint Marie de L'Incarnation wrote, the <b>filles</b> du roi were mostly town girls, {{and only a few}} knew how to do manual farm work. This problem remained but, in later years, more rural girls were recruited.|$|E
25|$|The women disembarked in Quebec City, Trois-Rivières, and Montreal. After their arrival, {{their time}} to find husbands varied greatly. For some, it was as short as a few months, while others took {{two or three years}} before finding an {{appropriate}} husband. For the process of choosing a husband, and the marriage, most couples would officially get engaged in church, with their priest and witnesses present. Then, some couples went in front of the notary, to sign a marriage contract. Marriages were celebrated by the priest, usually in the woman’s parish of residence. While the marriage banns customarily were to be published three times before a wedding could take place, the colony’s need for women to marry quickly led to few <b>filles</b> du roi having marriage banns announced. It is known that 737 of these <b>filles</b> du roi were married in New France.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the King's Daughters, {{the women}} who immigrated to Ville-Marie, {{otherwise}} known as Montreal, had been recruited by the Société Notre-Dame de Montréal founded in 1641 in Paris. Amongst these women were Jeanne Mance and Marguerite Bourgeoys. When the first <b>filles</b> du roi arrived in Montreal, they were taken in by Bourgeoys. Initially, there were no comfortable lodgings to receive them, but in 1668 Bourgeoys procured a large farmhouse in which to house them: the Maison Saint-Gabriel.|$|E
25|$|The {{marriage}} contracts {{represented a}} {{protection for the}} women, {{both in terms of}} financial security if anything were to happen to them or their husband, and in terms of having the liberty to annul the promise of marriage if the man they had chosen proved incompatible. A substantial number of the <b>filles</b> du roi who arrived in New France between 1669 and 1671 cancelled marriage contracts; perhaps the dowry they had received made them disinclined to retain a fiancé with whom they found themselves dissatisfied.|$|E
25|$|Relatively archaic {{forms of}} Quebec French are spoken on the {{territory}} {{corresponding to the}} historic Government of Three Rivers (Gouvernement de Trois-Rivières), notably Magoua dialect and Chaouin. It corresponded approximately to what is known today as the Mauricie and Centre-du-Québec regions (known locally under the historical name of Bois-Francs); the Mauricie was Atikamekw territory while the Bois-Francs was Abenaki. Here the early Frenchmen were mostly coureurs des bois who intermarried freely with the First Nations before the first arrival of the <b>filles</b> du roi in 1663.|$|E

25|$|For a long time, {{most women}} were taught at a {{separate}} ENS, the École normale supérieure de jeunes <b>filles</b> at Sèvres. It should however {{be noted that}} women were not explicitly barred entry until a law of 1940, and some women were students at Ulm before this date, such as philosopher Simone Weil and classicist Jacqueline de Romilly. In 1985, after heated debates, the two were merged into a single entity with its main campus at the historic site at the rue d'Ulm in Paris.|$|E
25|$|Until 1968, {{he played}} tenor {{saxophone}} exclusively. The final album {{on which he}} played tenor in the regular sequence of Davis albums was <b>Filles</b> de Kilimanjaro. In 1969, he played the soprano saxophone on the Davis album In a Silent Way and on his own Super Nova (recorded with then-current Davis sidemen Chick Corea and John McLaughlin). When performing live with Davis, and on recordings from summer 1969 to early spring 1970, he played both soprano and tenor saxophones; by the early 1970s, however, he chiefly played soprano.|$|E
