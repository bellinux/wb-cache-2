5|$|Much of {{the timber}} was reburied {{as the best}} way of {{preserving}} it, and a survey in 2005 found this to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>quite</b> successful, despite reports warning of the area drying out and the peat coverage being reduced. The site is included in the Heritage at Risk Register produced by English Heritage because of the risk to the buried timbers if the site dries out further.|$|E
5|$|Persistent {{attempts}} by the Israeli government to identify another Palestinian leader to represent the Palestinian people failed. Arafat was enjoying the support of groups that, given his own history, would normally <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>quite</b> wary of dealing with or supporting him. Marwan Barghouti (a leader of al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades) emerged as a possible replacement during the Second Intifada, but Israel had him arrested for allegedly {{being involved in the}} killing of twenty-six civilians, and he was sentenced to five life terms.|$|E
5|$|Aroma {{compounds}} {{are responsible}} for the particular odour or taste in some species, e.g. sotolon in the fenugreek-smelling Lactarius helvus, or the similar quabalactone III in Lactarius rubidus which causes a maple syrup-like odour in dried specimens. Pigments have been isolated from brightly coloured species, e.g. (7-isopropenyl-4-methylazulen-1-yl)methyl stearate from the blue Lactarius indigo or russulaflavidin and a derivative from the yellow Russula flavida. Some Russula species contain pigmented pteridine derivatives called russupteridines that are not found in the milk-caps. Sesquiterpenes are characteristic secondary metabolites of many Russulaceae, especially milk-caps which <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>quite</b> intensively studied. They are thought to be responsible for the hot taste in many species and may have deterrent, antifeeding functions in nature.|$|E

5|$|Being a {{foreigner}} {{and possibly a}} hetaera, Aspasia was free of the legal restraints that traditionally confined married women to their homes, and thereby was allowed {{to participate in the}} public life of the city. She became the mistress of the statesman Pericles in the early 440s. After he divorced his first wife (c. 445 BC), Aspasia began to live with him, although her marital status remains disputed. Their son, Pericles the Younger, must have been born by 440 BC. Aspasia would have to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>quite</b> young, if she were able to bear a child to Lysicles c. 428 BC.|$|E
5|$|There are {{records of}} two tutors {{for the young}} duke during the late 1030s and early 1040s, but the extent of William's {{literary}} education is unclear. He was not known as a patron of authors, {{and there is little}} evidence that he sponsored scholarship or other intellectual activities. Orderic Vitalis records that William tried to learn to read Old English late in life, but he was unable to devote sufficient time to the effort and quickly gave up. William's main hobby appears to have been hunting. His marriage to Matilda appears to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>quite</b> affectionate, and there are no signs that he was unfaithful to her– unusual in a medieval monarch. Medieval writers criticised William for his greed and cruelty, but his personal piety was universally praised by contemporaries.|$|E
5|$|Combined {{with the}} poached elements, both new {{specimens}} represent {{almost the entire}} skeleton of Deinocheirus, as MPC-D 100/127 includes all material apart from the middle dorsal vertebrae, most caudal vertebrae, and the right forelimb; MPC-D 100/128 fills in most gaps of the other skeleton, with nearly all dorsal and caudal vertebrae, the ilium, a partial ischium, {{and most of the}} left hindlimb. In 2014, the specimens were described in the Nature journal by Lee, Barsbold, Currie, Yoshitsugu Kobayashi, Hang-Jae Lee Lee, Godefroit, Escuillié, and Tsogtbaatar Chinzorig. A similar series of events was reported earlier in 2014 with Spinosaurus, another sail-backed theropod which had only been known from few remains since 1912. Poached remains were reunited with specimens obtained by scientists, and Spinosaurus was shown to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>quite</b> different from other spinosaurids. The two cases showed that the lifestyle and appearance of incompletely known extinct animals cannot always be safely inferred from close relatives.|$|E

5|$|Gunports {{for early}} {{gunpowder}} artillery {{had begun to}} be installed in English castles during the 15th century. At Kirby Muxloe, six gunports were constructed in the ground floor walls of both the gatehouse and west tower; these were then temporarily filled with bricks, probably to prevent vermin and to limit the drafts. Several more gunports were built lower down in the gatehouse, presumably in error as they were ultimately below the waterline of the moat and permanently blocked up. The range of any guns at the castle would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>quite</b> limited, as they were positioned relatively low to the ground. Historians are uncertain to what extent any guns at Kirby Muxloe would have been useful in a conflict. The gunports are of early design {{and may have been}} intended to be symbolic rather than practical; they were well positioned across the castle's defences, however, and might well have been intended to deter a serious attack.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, in the second-singular, {{inherited}} *-ta -ti {{competed with}} lengthened *-tā -tī for {{masculine and feminine}} forms. The expected result would be -t or -tā for masculine, -t or -tī for feminine, and in fact both variants of both forms {{are found in the}} Bible (with -h marking the long -ā and -y marking the long -ī). The situation appears to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>quite</b> fluid for several centuries, with -t and -tā/tī forms found in competition both in writing and in speech (cf. the Secunda (Hexapla) of Origen, which records both pronunciations, although quite often in disagreement with the written form as passed down to us). Ultimately, writing stabilized on the shorter -t for both genders, while speech choose feminine -t but masculine tā. This is the reason for the unexpected qamatz vowel written under the final letter of such words.|$|E
5|$|The dentary (lower jaw bone) {{itself is}} robust and short. The length {{axis of the}} p4 makes an angle of about 58° with the length axis of the jawbone. The bone is concave on the lingual, but convex on the labial side. There is a {{diastema}} (gap) between the p4 and the incisor {{that would have been}} in front of it, as in the jaw of Sudamerica. Gurovich estimated the length of the diastema as 2.5mm. There is a rounded mental foramen (an opening in the labial side of the jawbone), with a diameter of 0.7mm, located about 0.8mm below the dorsal margin of the bone and 1.5mm in front of the p4. Although the incisor itself is not preserved, its alveolus (the housing of the root) is in part. As in Sudamerica, it extends far into the dentary, passing below p4. The alveolus is 1.5mm wide below the front root of p4 and 1.4mm {{at the back of the}} jaw fragment. Although the height of the alveolus cannot be determined because the lower side is broken away, the incisor must <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>quite</b> deep.|$|E

5|$|The {{flag was}} {{examined}} in the early 20th century by A.J.B. Wace of the Victoria and Albert Museum, who concluded that the silk was woven in either Syria or Rhodes, and the darns {{were made in the}} Near East. It was his opinion that the flag, in its original state, would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>quite</b> precious, possibly a relic like the shirt of a saint. The belief {{at the time of this}} examination was the MacLeods were descended from Harald Hardrada, who spent some time in Constantinople in the 11th century. In line with this belief, it was suggested that the flag may have passed from Harald Hardrada down to the eponymous ancestor of the clan—Leod. The MacLeod Estate Office (Dunvegan Castle) website claims that experts have dated the flag to the 4th and 7th centuries—hundreds of years before the Crusades. The flag is currently held in Dunvegan Castle, along with other notable heirlooms such as the Dunvegan Cup and Sir Rory Mor's Horn.|$|E
5|$|Zaoutzes's rise to {{prominence}} was consolidated in 891–893, {{when he was}} given the newly created title of basileopator ("father of the emperor"). His promotion to this new and enigmatic title has been a subject of controversy, as neither the reasons for the creation of the title nor its exact functions are known. The early date of his elevation precludes a relation to the eventual rise of his daughter Zoe to the imperial throne as Leo's empress. Gratitude for Zaoutzes's support against Basil may have played a role, and a common theory is that the office implied some form of tutorship over the emperor. The office certainly confirmed Zaoutzes as the senior secular official of the Byzantine Empire. However, although Zaoutzes has traditionally been regarded as an all-powerful regent over a weak emperor, in no small part due to the account provided in the Vita Euthymii, the actual relationship between the two may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>quite</b> different. A more careful evaluation of the source material has led modern scholarship to conclude that Leo was actively involved in government, and that Zaoutzes as chief minister was loyal and obsequious to his master.|$|E
