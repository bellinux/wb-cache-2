Initially livid, Charuseela is impressed when Harsha succeeds in persuading her uncle's family not to migrate to the city to live with their employed son and instead makes their son agree to visit them every possible weekend. Later, Harsha and Charuseela learn that Ratnam is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>over</b> all the agricultural land around the village for political gain since the value of the land will appreciate following the official declaration of a new coastal industrial corridor. Harsha confronts them and warns them not to interfere in his work of developing the village.|$|E
5|$|Three bills {{directing}} {{that the}} battleships be sold were {{introduced into the}} Argentine National Congress {{in the summer of}} 1914, but all were defeated. Still, soon after the beginning of the First World War, the German ambassador to Argentina alleged to the U.S. State Department that Britain's Royal Navy was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>over</b> the ships as soon as the ships reached the River Plate, and the British put diplomatic pressure on the United States to try to ensure the ships were not sold to any other country (as this new country could in turn sell them to Germany). Italy, the Ottomans, and Greece were all reportedly interested in buying both ships, the latter as a counter to the Ottoman purchase of Rio de Janeiro. The United States, worried that its neutrality would not be respected and its technology would be released for study to a foreign competitor, put diplomatic pressure on Argentina to keep the ships, which it eventually did.|$|E
25|$|In 1960, {{preparation}} for the 1964 World's Fair was underway, and to provide transit access, {{an extension of the}} IND Queens Boulevard Line to the fair grounds was considered. Robert Moses, who was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>over</b> as president of the World's Fair on May 15, 1960, rejected the proposal once he found out that the line would have cost $10,000,000. In the end, improved Flushing Line service, and increased E, F, and GG service would provide improved transportation facilities for the fair.|$|E

25|$|Swindon Town F.C. {{was also}} {{scheduled}} to appear {{as part of the}} Sky TV series Big Ron Manager in 2006, which involved former football manager Ron Atkinson acting as a troubleshooter for a club in difficulties. Filming began in December 2005 at the County Ground, with caretaker-manager Iffy Onuora in charge of Swindon at the time. The appearance of Atkinson at the club resulted in widespread press speculation that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>over</b> the management of the team, which was denied. Following the disruption caused by this and the producers' wish for more backroom access, the television crew were asked to leave the club's premises in January 2006.|$|E
25|$|James' {{first run}} for the 35th Council District was in November 2001. In a close race, James {{received}} 42% of the vote on the Working Families Party line but lost to James E. Davis, a Democrat. In July 2003, just months before the next election, Davis was assassinated by Othniel Askew, another politician. Following the tragic event, Davis's brother, Geoffrey, had decided he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>over</b> the Council seat running on the Democratic platform, but on election day, November 4, Geoffrey Davis lost by a large margin to James as the Working Families Party nominee.

500|$|In January 2013, Joss Whedon {{deflected}} {{any direct}} influences from other series, {{such as the}} efforts of Fox Mulder and Dana Scully in The X-Files, and explained that while the show would involve people with powers and the spectacle of science-fiction storytelling, it would focus on [...] "the peripheral people...the people {{on the edges of}} the grand adventures." [...] As the series began to introduce more powered individuals, Bell noted that audiences [...] "seem to respond to powered people on the show and while it's not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>over</b> and become what the show's about, as a texture and flavor of the stories, we really enjoy that." [...] Jed Whedon stated that the series would continue to emphasize the general public's response to powered people, saying, [...] "The dynamic in the world has changed. There was one person with powers, and then by The Avengers there were maybe six total ... now they're much more prevalent, so there's reaction from the public based on that." ...|$|E

500|$|It is {{not just}} the women in his life that Lex has a {{difficult}} time maintaining a healthy relationship with, but his father as well. Rosenbaum characterizes the relationship between Lex and Lionel as a form of tug-of-war, and disagrees with John Glover's assessment that Lionel is merely testing Lex for the life he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>over.</b> For Rosenbaum, Lex is being pushed and pushed, and Lex is afraid that he will reach the point that he knows he will {{no longer be able to}} come back from. In [...] "Vortex", Lex realizes that he forgot who he was in that moment that his father was trapped under the column, and he felt guilty over the situation. According to Rosenbaum, Lex realized that by letting his father die he would have been traveling down a dark path, and would have become all that his father was—evil. As Lex continues to live in his father's shadow, and as time progresses, he learns more about the [...] "monster" [...] that Lionel truly is. The breaking point comes when Lex learns that his father killed Lex's grandparents in a tenement fire. Rosenbaum sees this as the ultimate ethical dilemma—he likens it to parents learning that their child has murdered someone, and then having to decide if they should go to the authorities or not—and Lex, who can no longer take his father's abuse, decides to turn Lionel over to the FBI. According to Rosenbaum, the decision is justified to Lex, who sees that monster that Lionel really is from his actions—using electroshock therapy to erase Lex's memories, drugging Lex, killing his own parents, and the way he treated Lex's mother.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} {{possible}} hints {{made in the}} season two finale towards an adaptation of Secret Warriors, Bell noted that the series does share the character Daisy Johnson with that comic, and [...] "the idea {{of a team of}} powered people is something we've seen in the show ... I think there's a world down the road where we do our version." [...] Elaborating on this and the series dealing with the many powered people introduced in season two, Bell said, [...] "People seem to respond to powered people on the show and while it's not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>over</b> and become what the show's about, as a texture and flavor of the stories, we really enjoy that. The fact that Inhumans are now out there is something I think we need to investigate". He later clarified that characters would not have to be Inhuman to join the Secret Warriors, just powered, and that not just any powered character would be allowed to join, given that Johnson had to go through years of training on top of getting powers to join the team, and so similar rules would apply to other potential members. Executive producers Maurissa Tancharoen and Jed Whedon also discussed the Secret Warriors, the former cautioning [...] "a very slow build" [...] to the team, and the latter explaining, [...] "We feel a duty to the Cinematic Universe to not hyper-accelerate how many people have powers ... We don't want it to be there's a thousand people with powers with a show that at its heart is about what it's like to not have powers in a world with powers." ...|$|E

[...] At the same time, he recognized that the company's DVD service may have contributed to a decline in DVD sales, and regarding the industry's willingness to make special deals with Netflix in the future, he added [...] "this has been an era of experimentation, and I think it's coming to a close." [...] Bewkes later refined his position, stating during a 2011 conference call that [...] "things like Netflix are welcome additions to the infrastructure. They can monetize value for companies like Warner that maybe there wasn't – in terms of efficiency for older product, wasn't as available beforeOur view of Netflix has been very consistent.

2500|$|We've {{seen here}} at the city of Kent especially, {{probably}} the most vicious form of campus-oriented violence yet perpetrated by dissident groups.

And these people just move from one campus to the other and terrorize the community. They're worse than the brown shirts and the communist element and also the night riders and the vigilantes. They're the worst type of people that we harbor in America. Now I want to say this. They are not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>over</b> [...] campus.

2500|$|Ortiz {{said that}} Sukeban Games was founded {{when he and}} Damas started a blog to write about anime and video games. They {{eventually}} managed to grow a [...] "small but awesome" [...] community, which lead them to create a short dating sim for the blog's first anniversary. After enjoying the video game creation process, they decided to continue following that path. The majority of influences for VA-11 HALL-A come from old PC-98 games, because they are [...] "retro" [...] yet also [...] "look futuristic"; especially X-Girl Cyber Punk Adventure which served as the blueprint for the game's aesthetic. According to Ortiz, in the 70s–90s, [...] "the world {{was under the impression}} that Japan was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>over</b> with its superior technology." [...] As such, the game is set in a parallel universe where Japan did conquer the world through technology, leading to the game's strong Japanese influences. Blade Runner, Neuromancer, Ghost in the Shell, and Bubblegum Crisis were also sources of inspiration. Anime influence has also resulted in the game's female protagonist and mostly female character list. Ortiz says that they focus their games on anime fans rather than mainstream appeal, as [...] "the bigger your audience is the more creative troubles you have. Too many opinions and it's hard to see one that will truly help your creative process." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{spite of}} {{official}} objections to intolerance {{by the party}} leadership and some Reformer MPs, comments and decisions made at party conventions by Reform Party supporters {{on a number of}} issues were considered highly intolerant by onlookers. In 1991, Manning was humiliated at a Reform Party rally when a Reform Party supporter spoke in support of Manning in racist terms, saying “You’re a fine white person. You know, we are letting in too many people from the Third World, the low blacks, the low Hispanics. They’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>over</b> the province”. Later in the same rally another Reform Party supporter stood up and said “Let them [...] go. We don’t need Quebec.” Long-time Progressive Conservative member and political commentator Dalton Camp observed the 1994 Reform Party convention in Ottawa and was personally disgusted with what he heard, saying: [...] "The speechifying gives off acrid whiffs of xenophobia, homophobia, and paranoia—like an exhaust—in which it seems clear both orator and audience have been seized by some private terror: immigrants, lesbians, people out of work or from out of town and criminals." [...] In the Reform Party policy convention in 1995, Manning urged members to avoid extremism, and a motion was passed by the vote of the delegates that the Reform Party recognized the equality of every individual, but only after the delegates demanded that the words [...] "without discrimination" [...] be removed from the motion. The 1995 convention went on to Reform party delegates controversially called for the removal of group specification in all human rights legisiation which was accepted in the convention by a 93 percent vote in favour. Another controversial motion in the 1995 convention called for tighter regulation of people infected with HIV which was supported by 84 percent of the delegates. One Reformer delegate raised concern that such a policy on HIV would make the party look anti-homosexual, but another delegate responded to this saying [...] "I did not join the Reform Party to bow down at the altar of political correctness".|$|E

The sultan had his troops and an enormous fleet at his disposal while the besieged Byzantines (and their Christian allies) were demoralized and divided amongst themselves. Responding to a request for help from the Byzantine Emperor, the Sfakian leader Manousos Kallikratis gathered 300 Sfakian warriors and another 760 Cretan fighters {{from other parts of the}} island.

I got that young fellow whom we came across down at Cropstone to look into the affairs of the Water and Lighting Company, found that they were an absolutely moribund concern, bought them out for cash, with the sole condition of secrecy, and sat tight. If Montague and Littleham had kept their bargain--that is to say if they had let me into their scheme for purchasing the Company--I should have told them the truth, a few plain words would have passed, and I should have compensated them for their disappointment. As it was, they tried to be too clever.

A Jewish {{resident}} of the city witnessed this, and spread the word throughout Sijilmassa that 'Ubayed Allah was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> attempt <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>over</b> the city. At or around the same time, Prince Yasa', the Midrarid ruler, received a letter from the Abbasids in Baghdad, warning him to close his frontiers and be wary of ‘Ubayed Allah. Yasa' was forced to imprison the men he had previously patronized. 'Ubayed Allah's servant escaped to Kairouan, which at the time was a stronghold for Isma’ilis. The leader of the Isma’ilis in Ifriqiya was Abu ‘Abdallah; he quickly mustered an army to rescue his compatriot. On his way to Sijilmassa, he subdued Tahert, the nearby Ibadi Kharijite stronghold under the Rustamid dynasty. The army arrived in the Tafilalt {{in the latter half of}} 909, and laid siege to the city.
