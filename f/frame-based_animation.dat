Its relative simplicity over traditional <b>frame-based</b> <b>animation</b> limits control and range of expression. Its real-time nature favors speed, cost saving, and flexibility over the higher quality of pre-rendered computer animation. Virtual acting is less expensive, dangerous, and physically restricted than live action. Machinima can be filmed by relying on in-game artificial intelligence (AI) or by controlling characters and cameras through digital puppetry. [...] Scenes can be precisely scripted, and can be manipulated during post-production using video editing techniques. Editing, custom software, and creative cinematography may address technical limitations. Game companies have provided software for and have encouraged machinima, but the widespread use of digital assets from copyrighted games has resulted in complex, unresolved legal issues.|$|E

40|$|This report {{describes}} our {{attempt to}} add animation as another data type {{to be used}} on the World Wide Web. Our current network infrastructure, the Internet, is incapable of carrying video and audio streams {{for them to be}} used on the web for presentation purposes. In contrast, object-oriented animation proves to be efficient in terms of network resource requirements. We defined an animation model to support drawing-based and <b>frame-based</b> <b>animation.</b> We also extended the HyperText Markup Language in order to include this animation mode. BU-NCSA Mosanim, {{a modified version of the}} NCSA Mosaic for X(v 2. 5), is available to demonstrate the concept and potentials of animation in presentations an interactive game playing over the web...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} motion sampling and reconstruction for globally illuminated animated environments (under fixed viewing conditions) based on sparse spatio-temporal scene sampling, a resolution-independent temporal file format, and a Delaunay triangulation pixel reconstruction method. The argument is made that motion that is usually achieved by rendering complete images of a scene at a high frame rate (i. e. flipbook style <b>frame-based</b> <b>animation)</b> can be adequately reconstructed using many less samples (often {{on the order of}} that required to generate a single, complete, high quality frame) from the sparse image data stored in bounded slices of our temporal file. The scene is rendered using a ray tracing algorithm modified to randomly sample over space - the image plane (x, y), and time (t), yielding (x, y, t) samples that are stored in our spatio-temporal images. Reconstruction of object motion, reconstructing a picture of the scene at a desired time, is performed by projecting the (x, y, t) samples onto the desired temporal plane with the appropriate weighting, constructing the 2 D Delaunay triangulation of the sample points, and Gouraud (or Phong) shading the resulting triangles. Both first and higher order visual effects, illumination and visibility, are handled. Silhouette edges and other discontinuities are more difficult to track but can be addressed with a combination of triangle filtering and image postprocessing...|$|E
