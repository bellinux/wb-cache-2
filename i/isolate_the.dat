Hatcher later commits suicide.|$|E
5|$|Arfwedson later {{showed that}} this same element {{was present in}} the {{minerals}} spodumene and lepidolite. In 1818, Christian Gmelin {{was the first to}} observe that lithium salts give a bright red color to flame. However, both Arfwedson and Gmelin tried and failed to <b>isolate</b> <b>the</b> pure element from its salts. It was not isolated until 1821, when William Thomas Brande obtained it by electrolysis of lithium oxide, a process that had previously been employed by the chemist Sir Humphry Davy to <b>isolate</b> <b>the</b> alkali metals potassium and sodium. Brande also described some pure salts of lithium, such as the chloride, and, estimating that lithia (lithium oxide) contained about 55% metal, estimated the atomic weight of lithium to be around 9.8 g/mol (modern value ~6.94 g/mol). In 1855, larger quantities of lithium were produced through the electrolysis of lithium chloride by Robert Bunsen and Augustus Matthiessen. The discovery of this procedure led to commercial production of lithium in 1923 by the German company Metallgesellschaft AG, which performed an electrolysis of a liquid mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.|$|E

5|$|As in {{the first}} attempt, a Sa'iqa company from the 103rd Battalion would occupy {{positions}} four kilometers east of Budapest to <b>isolate</b> <b>the</b> fort. It would be supported by an AT-3 Sagger ATGM platoon. The main attack would be launched from the east by a Sa'iqa company and a company from al-Mezahi's battalion as the first echelon. Other units of al-Mezahi's battalion would conduct a secondary attack from the west, while one company remained in reserve near Port Fouad along with a Sa'iqa company. A reinforced company (less one platoon) of al-Mezahi's battalion would land by sea directly upon the Israeli fort. The attack would be preceded by a 30-minute-long fire preparation.|$|E
5|$|Authors and {{military}} analysts {{have speculated that}} had Kingsbury not attacked, the Japanese might have destroyed the battalion. The Japanese had been attacking in waves, and had started to climb a steep hill to outflank the Australians, {{in an effort to}} win the battle. The Australians were low on supplies and the Japanese {{were on the verge of}} breaking through the Australian line. Had they broken through, they would have been able to <b>isolate</b> <b>the</b> battalion's headquarters from the soldiers on the flanks. This would have prevented the Australians from retreating to Alola, allowing the Japanese to overrun them.|$|E

40|$|Streptococcus pyogenes {{isolates}} (group A streptococcus) {{of different}} erythromycin resistance phenotypes {{were collected from}} all over Finland in 1994 and 1995 and studied; they were evaluated for their susceptibilities to 14 antimicrobial agents (396 <b>isolates)</b> and <b>the</b> presence of different erythromycin resistance genes (45 <b>isolates).</b> <b>The</b> erythromycin-resistant <b>isolates</b> with <b>the</b> macrolide-resistant but lincosamide- and streptogramin B-susceptible phenotype (M phenotype) were further studied for their plasmid contents and the transferability of resistance genes.

40|$|Abstract: Seedling {{reactions}} of 15 barley cultivars grown in Turkey were determined under greenhouse conditions to five isolates of Drechslera graminea, the causal agent of barley stripe disease.

5|$|In ambient {{pressure}} diving, the diver is directly {{exposed to the}} pressure of the surrounding water. The {{ambient pressure}} diver may dive on breath-hold, or use breathing apparatus for scuba diving or surface-supplied diving, and the saturation diving technique reduces the risk of decompression sickness (DCS) after long-duration deep dives. Atmospheric diving suits (ADS) may be used to <b>isolate</b> <b>the</b> diver from high ambient pressure. Crewed submersibles can extend depth range, and remotely controlled or robotic machines can reduce risk to humans.|$|E

5|$|It is {{relatively}} {{difficult to separate}} ytterbium from other lanthanides due to its similar properties. As a result, the process is somewhat long. First, minerals such as monazite or xenotime are dissolved into various acids, such as sulfuric acid. Ytterbium can then be separated from other lanthanides by ion exchange, as can other lanthanides. The solution is then applied to a resin, which different lanthanides bind in different matters.
