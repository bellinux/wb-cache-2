Ethylene propylene rubber (EPR) copolymer is a polymer which is widely used as <b>insulation</b> in <b>medium</b> and high voltage cable. This EPR insulation is highly filled and can have as many as 20 additives. Although the major effect of these additives on mechanical performance is known the effect on the dielectric behavior is not well understood. Thermally Stimulated Discharge Current (TSDC) measurements and Time Domain Dielectric Spectroscopy (TDDS) are employed to characterize the dielectric behavior of clay (kaolin) filled ethylene propylene rubber (EPR) copolymer. The TSDC results show two peaks at - 30 ∘C and 50 ∘C. ^ The low temperature peak is affected by the type of base polymer and is attributed to the motion of polymer chain segments. The high temperature peak is caused by the {{addition of}} the clay filler and shows dipole behavior. This peak is thought to be due to a distribution of dipole relaxations caused by the polarization at the clay/polymer interface. This peak can be described using Maxwell-Wagner interfacial effects where the polarization is dependent on the particle shape. The TDDS results show a loss peak in the low frequency region (0. 001 Hz) which is also attributed to the interfacial polarization introduced by the clay. Although bulk interfacial effects are thought to be the main mechanism which causes the polarization, the results have also indicated that surface ions on the clay filler will affect the polarization. The effect of silane treated clay, ion exchange of the clay and the effect of adding red lead (an ion scavenger) strongly suggests that ion motion and type of ion will affect this mechanism. ...|$|R

Typical test methods such as oscilating voltage waves (OVW), very low frequency (VLF) for medium cables and frequency-tuned resonance (FTR) for high voltage cables are adopted by far, especially for XLPE cable system. However, on-site interferences and noises make this PD detection very difficult. It requires a better method to extract PD pulses from severe noise circumstance. Wavelet transform technique used to suppress noises from PD signal (PDs) requires reasonable mother wavelet, amount of scales and thresholds to produce its best effect. This paper proposed a new wavelet-based denoising technique for on-site PD measurement of power cables. It aimed at applying discrete wavelet transform (DWT) with better denoising effect to on-site PD measurement. Firstly, it described and analyzed the testing methods for on-site PD measurement. Secondly, resonable amount of scales selection algorithm and threshold determine algorithm have been studied with this denoising technique. Finally, simulation studies associated with this method are presented. Moreover, previous wavelet denoising techniques are also studied here to compare to the new technique. Results indicate that this technique can not only attain better denoising effect but also improve the sensitivity of PD detection.

The objective of this thesis was to perform a comprehensive material characterization of these new resin/hardener combinations, which are potentially used as electrical <b>insulation</b> material in <b>medium</b> and high voltage engineering. The thermal cure behaviour of commercial tetraglycidyl-diamino-diphenylmethane (TGDDM) and a co-anhydride mixture consisting of maleic anhydride (MA) and hexahydrophthalic anhydride (HHPA) was extensively studied. Different analytical real-time methods, such as FT-Raman spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and chemo-rheological methods were applied to investigate the principal polymerization mechanism and the related curing kinetics. It was demonstrated that kinetic parameters that were based on isothermal measurements provided consistent and reliable results. On the other hand the general limitations of different dynamic methods for kinetic parameter calculations were outlined and discussed. Temperature modulated differential scanning calorimetry provided a powerful technique to confirm a TGDDM/MA and TGDDM/HHPA sub-network structure of the co-anhydride cured epoxy. A generalized time-temperature-transformation-diagram was developed in order to predict the complex material transformations (e. g. gelation and vitrification) occurring during the entire isothermal curing process. In the selected system, the mechanical deformation and fracture behaviour as a function of temperature, strain rate, inorganic filler fraction, particle size, and filler/matrix-adhesion were thoroughly studied by using compression-, tension- and double torsion fracture-tests. The potential of hyperbranched polymers (HBPs) as low viscosity toughening modifiers for highly crosslinked anhydride-cured epoxy networks was experimentally evaluated. The effects of the HBP molecular structure, in particular the specific shell chemistry, on thermo-mechanical properties, final morphology, and blend concentration, were assessed. For the neat investigated epoxy-system the most efficient toughening modifier was obtained for a molecular HBP-design that provided a pseudo-homogeneous blend morphology. Thus, by using suitable HBPs in a concentration of 20 % w/w, the fracture toughness, expressed by the critical stress intensity factor (Klc) of 0. 58 MPam(to the power of) 0. 5, was increased by over 50 % to 0. 88 MPam(to the power of) 0. 5. The corresponding Young's modulus and glass transition temperature were only affected to a limited extent by the addition of the HBP-additive. The toughest epoxy blend (critical stress intensity factor of about 1. 6 MPam(to the power of) 0. 5) was achieved by the incorporation of 60 % w/w inorganic silica particles. The application of hybrid concepts by utilizing synergistic toughening mechanisms (HBP and silica), revealed only moderate benefits within the investigated highly crosslinked materials. As the examined epoxy/anhydride formulations are generally considered for high temperature applications, it was essential to determine their long-term thermooxidative ageing performance. The long-term thermo-oxidative ageing behaviour has been investigated by means of thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and vibrational infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) methods with special emphasis on fundamental understanding of the ageing mechanism. Effects of the thermal ageing on the characteristic viscoelastic and flexural behaviour, weight-loss and oxidation susceptibility of the examined epoxy networks were assessed and discussed, thus providing an understanding of the principal material endurance properties. The thermo-mechanical behaviour and the related structural changes with thermal ageing were examined by Cole-Cole plots in combination with a molecular theory previously developed by Perez. It was demonstrated that this new methodology provides a connection between conversion, glass transition temperature, and mechanical relaxation data and allows a fundamental molecular interpretation with respect to physical and chemical ageing phenomena. A variety of thermo-gravimetric experiments were carried out in order to determine and model the specific weight-loss profile as a function of anhydride nature and ageing temperature. The influence of different inorganic fillers on the thermooxidative response was systematically studied. Different models were applied to extract meaningful kinetic parameters in order to describe the thermo-oxidative degradation and to facilitate an extrapolation of weight-loss data outside the experimental time- and temperature-scale. FT-IR micro ATR-spectroscopy was used to identify, localize and quantify the complex oxidation behaviour. A thermo-oxidative degradation mechanism, that involved predominantly radical oxidation processes and C-N as well as C-O chain scissions, was proposed to account for the experimental observations. Specific oxidation-front profiles were constructed to describe the heterogeneous oxidation processes. Finally, the comprehensive material characterization of these novel co-anhydridecured amino-glycidyl resins in terms of curing mechanism and kinetic, deformation and fracture behaviour, and thermo-oxidative ageing performance, allows the assessment of the potential of these materials for demanding applications in electrical and electronic industries...|$|R
40|$|SF 6 {{is widely}} used in modern {{transmission}} and distribution networks because of its outstanding dual qualities: arc quenching and dielectric insulation. As a gas medium, SF 6 is chemically inert, non-toxic, and non-flammable, which makes possible the construction of compact SF 6 switchgear. One major known disadvantage of the gas {{is that it has}} a global warming potential which is 23, 900 times higher than CO 2. This has led to research into alternative gases with a much lower environmental impact, and one of the emerging candidates is CF 3 I. The high boiling temperature of CF 3 I means {{that it has to be}} used as part of a mixture inside gas-insulated equipment. To carry out the investigation on CF 3 I, a scaled-down coaxial system that replicates the maximum electric field of a 400 kV GIL system was designed and fabricated. The insulation performances of CF 3 I/CO 2 and CF 3 I/N 2 gas mixtures were then examined by measuring the 50 % breakdown voltage, U 50, using a standard lightning impulse waveform (1. 2 / 50) under absolute pressures of 1 to 4 bar. The experimental results show that CF 3 I gas mixtures have promising potential as an <b>insulation</b> <b>medium</b> for application in gasinsulated lines...|$|E
40|$|In {{this context}} of {{changing}} and challenging market requirements, Gas Insulated Substation(GIS) {{has found a}} broad range of applications in power systems {{for more than two decades}} because of its high reliability, easy maintenance and small ground space requirement etc. SF 6 has been of considerable technological interest as an <b>insulation</b> <b>medium</b> in GIS because of its superior insulating properties, high dielectric strength at relatively low pressure and its thermal and chemical stability. SF 6 is generally found to be very sensitive to field perturbations such as those caused by conductor surface imperfections and by conducting particle contaminants. A study of CIGRE group suggests that 20 % of failure in GIS is due to the existence of various metallic contaminations in the form of loose particles. The presence of contamination can therefore be a problem with gas insulated substations operating at high fields. If the effects of these particles could be eliminated, then this would improve the reliability of compressed gas insulated substation. It would also offer the possibility of operating at higher fields to affect a potential reduction in the GIS size with subsequent savings in the cost of manufacture and installation. The purpose of this paper is to develop techniques, which will formulate the basic equations that will govern the movement of metallic particles like aluminum, copper in a coated as well as uncoated busduct...|$|E
