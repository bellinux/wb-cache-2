5|$|The Bhagavata Purana {{describes}} Naraka as {{beneath the}} earth: between the seven realms {{of the underworld}} (Patala) and the Garbhodaka Ocean, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the universe. It {{is located in the}} South of the universe. Pitrloka, where the dead ancestors (Pitrs) headed by Agniṣvāttā reside, is also located in this region. Yama, the Lord of Naraka, resides in this realm with his assistants. The Devi Bhagavata Purana mentions that Naraka is the southern part of universe, below the earth but above Patala. The Vishnu Purana mentions that it is located below the cosmic waters {{at the bottom of the}} universe. The Hindu epics too agree that Naraka is located in the South, the direction which is governed by Yama and is often associated with Death. Pitrloka is considered as the capital of Yama, from where Yama delivers his justice.|$|E

As in B/D, the declaration of the top/bottom may be required, though sadomasochists may also play without any power exchange at all, with both partners equally in control of the play.|$|E

25|$|All shoes have a sole, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of a shoe, {{in contact}} with the ground. Soles can be made from a variety of materials, {{although}} most modern shoes have soles made from natural rubber, polyurethane, or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) compounds. Soles can be simple— a single material in a single layer— or they can be complex, with multiple structures or layers and materials. When various layers are used, soles may consist of an insole, midsole, and an outsole.|$|E

500|$|This {{lengthening}} {{has received}} {{a number of different}} explanations within the context of theoretical phonology. All accounts agree that some property of the fortis sonorant is being transferred to the preceding vowel, but the details about what property that is vary from researcher to researcher. [...] argue that the fortis sonorant is tense (a term only vaguely defined phonetically) and that this tenseness is transferred to the vowel, where it is realized phonetically as vowel length and/or diphthongization. [...] argues that the triggering consonant is underlyingly associated with a unit of syllable weight called a mora; this mora then shifts to the vowel, creating a long vowel or a diphthong. [...] expands on that analysis to argue that the fortis sonorants have an advanced tongue root (that <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the tongue is pushed upward during articulation of the consonant) and that diphthongization is an articulatory effect of this tongue movement.|$|E

2500|$|Tool {{geometry}} {{is extremely}} important for accuracy in hand engraving. When sharpened for most applications, a graver has a [...] "face", which is {{the top of the}} graver, and a [...] "heel", which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the graver; not all tools or application require a heel. These two surfaces meet to form a point that cuts the metal. The geometry and length of the heel helps to guide the graver smoothly as it cuts the surface of the metal. When the tool's point breaks or chips, even on a microscopic level, the graver can become hard to control and produces unexpected results. Modern innovations have brought about new types of carbide that resist chipping and breakage, which hold a very sharp point longer between resharpening than traditional metal tools.|$|E
