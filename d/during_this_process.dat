5|$|As the mutinies spread, Regensburg {{was sent}} to Swinemünde, {{arriving}} on 7 November. That night, false reports of torpedo boats manned by Communist revolutionaries had sailed to attack his ships reached Karpf.

In December 1918, Regensburg escorted the British battleship , which was carrying the Allied Armistice Commission, to Kiel.|$|E
5|$|During the North American {{localization}} of Pokémon, a small {{team led}} by Hiro Nakamura went through the individual Pokémon, renaming them for western audiences based on their appearance and characteristics after approval from Nintendo Co.

During the translation process, it became apparent that simply altering the games' text from Japanese to English was impossible; the games had to be entirely reprogrammed from scratch due to the fragile state of their source code, a side effect of the unusually lengthy development time. Therefore, the games were based on the more modern Japanese version of Blue; modeling its programming and artwork, but keeping the same distribution of Pokémon found in the Japanese Red and Green cartridges, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Female loggerheads first {{reproduce}} {{between the}} ages of 17 and 33, and their mating period may last more than six weeks. They court their mates, but these behaviors have not been thoroughly examined. Male forms of courtship behavior include nuzzling, biting, and head and flipper movements. Studies suggest females produce cloacal pheromones to indicate reproductive ability. Before mating, the male approaches a female and attempts to mount her, while she resists. Next, the male and female begin to circle each other. If the male has competitors, the female may let the males struggle with each other. The winner then mounts the female; the male's curved claws usually damage the shoulders of the female's shell <b>during</b> <b>this</b> <b>process.</b> Other courting males bite the male while he is attempting to copulate, damaging his flippers and tail, possibly exposing bones. Such damage can cause the male to dismount and may require weeks to heal.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{publication}} of Tintin in America, Hergé had been keen to produce a mystery story, and had been inspired by the tabloid speculation surrounding an alleged Curse of the Pharaohs following the 1922 discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun. Cigars of the Pharaoh proved a commercial success in Belgium, and Hergé followed it with The Blue Lotus, a story which continues many of the plot elements that began in Cigars. The series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. In 1955, Cigars of the Pharaoh was re-drawn and coloured in Hergé's distinctive ligne-claire style by the cartoonist and his Studios Hergé team; <b>during</b> <b>this</b> <b>process</b> a number of minor plot elements were changed. The comic was adapted for a 1991 episode of the Ellipse/Nelvana animated series The Adventures of Tintin. Critical reception of the story has been positive, with analysis being focused on its innovative narrative and stylistic choices, {{as well as its}} introduction of three recurring characters, the detectives Thomson and Thompson and Rastapopoulos, who in this album appears to be a friendly, but in the continuing album The Blue Lotus is revealed as a villain.|$|E
5|$|In some instances, the {{production}} of analogue pizza cheese can be similar to {{the production}} of cream cheese, although production may be different and homogenization may be avoided. In some varieties, the product is heated to remain at a specific temperature and for a specific amount of time, which causes the proteins in the mix to gelatinize. <b>During</b> <b>this</b> <b>process,</b> salts in the mix serve to emulsify it and thus improve the meltability of the final product. The heated product is then placed in packaging such as bags-in-boxes while still hot, as it is more easily handled in this state compared to when in a solid state. During packaging, these types of pizza cheeses are then quick-cooled to avoid browning of the product, which can occur vis-a-vis the Maillard reaction.|$|E
5|$|Nolan North, {{the voice}} actor who played Drake, {{had a large}} role in {{defining}} the character's physical and vocal reactions.

In naming the character, the development team considered many different choices, including Ethan, Samuel, and John.
