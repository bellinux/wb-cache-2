5|$|Behaviorism {{dominated}} {{philosophy of}} mind {{for much of}} the 20th century, especially the first half. In psychology, behaviorism developed as a reaction to the inadequacies of introspectionism. Introspective reports on one's own interior mental life are not subject to careful examination for accuracy and cannot be used to form predictive generalizations. Without <b>generalizability</b> and the possibility of third-person examination, the behaviorists argued, psychology cannot be scientific. The way out, therefore, was to eliminate the idea of an interior mental life (and hence an ontologically independent mind) altogether and focus instead on the description of observable behavior.|$|E

25|$|I/O {{researchers}} employ quantitative statistical methods. Quantitative {{methods used}} in I/O psychology include correlation, multiple regression, {{and analysis of}} variance. More advanced statistical methods employed in I/O research include logistic regression, structural equation modeling, and hierarchical linear modeling (HLM; also known as multilevel modeling). I/O research has also employed meta-analysis. I/O psychologists also employ psychometric methods including methods associated with classical test theory, <b>generalizability</b> theory, and item response theory (IRT).|$|E
25|$|Educational {{material}} {{at all levels}} from pre-school to post-doctoral is available from websites. Examples range from CBeebies, through school and high-school revision guides and virtual universities, to access to top-end scholarly literature through the likes of Google Scholar. For distance education, help with homework and other assignments, self-guided learning, whiling away spare time, or just looking up more detail on an interesting fact, {{it has never been}} easier for people to access educational information at any level from anywhere. The Internet in general and the World Wide Web in particular are important enablers of both formal and informal education. Further, the Internet allows universities, in particular, researchers from the social and behavioral sciences, to conduct research remotely via virtual laboratories, with profound changes in reach and <b>generalizability</b> of findings as well as in communication between scientists and in the publication of results.|$|E
25|$|Participants in {{the trial}} were {{recruited}} when they sought medical care at general medical or psychiatric clinics. No advertising was used to recruit subjects {{in order to maximize}} the <b>generalizability</b> of the study results. Participants were required to have a minimum score of 14 point on the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D17) in order to be enrolled {{in the trial}}. Generally accepted cutoffs are 7–17 points for mild depression, 18–24 points for moderate depression, and ≥ 24 for severe depression. The average participant baseline HAM-D17 score was 22. The pre-specified primary endpoint of this trial was remission as determined by the HAM-D score, with all patients with missing scores rated as non-responders. In the aftermath of the trial, the investigators have presented the results mainly using the secondary endpoint of remission according to the QIDS-SR16 Score, which tend to be somewhat higher.|$|E
25|$|The H1 {{receptor}} antagonism of doxepin {{is responsible}} for its hypnotic effects and its effectiveness {{in the treatment of}} insomnia at low doses. The incidence of side effects with doxepin and its safety at these doses was similar to that of placebo in clinical trials; the most frequent side effects were headache and somnolence/sedation, both with an incidence of less than 5%. Other side effects sometimes associated with antihistamines, including daytime sedation, increased appetite, and weight gain, all were not observed. Clinical evidence of H1 receptor antagonists and TCAs for the treatment insomnia shows mixed effectiveness and is limited in its quality due to weaknesses like small sample sizes and poor <b>generalizability.</b> However, doxepin is a unique and notable exception; it has been well-studied in the treatment of insomnia and shows consistent benefits with excellent tolerability and safety. Aside from diphenhydramine and doxylamine, which have historical approval as hypnotics, doxepin is the only H1 receptor antagonist that is specifically approved for the treatment of insomnia in the United States.|$|E
25|$|The {{therapeutic}} {{potential of}} synthetic lethality as an efficacious anti-cancer strategy is continually improving. Recently, {{the applicability of}} synthetic lethality to targeted cancer therapy has heightened due to the recent work of scientists including Ronald A. DePinho and colleagues, in what is termed 'collateral lethality'. Muller et al. found that passenger genes, with chromosomal proximity to tumor suppressor genes, are collaterally deleted in some cancers. Thus, the identification of collaterally deleted redundant genes carrying out an essential cellular function may be the untapped reservoir for then pursing a synthetic lethality approach. Collateral lethality therefore holds great potential in identification of novel and selective therapeutic targets in oncology. In 2012, Muller et al. identified that homozygous deletion of redundant-essential glycolytic ENO1 gene in human glioblastoma (GBM) is the consequence of proximity to 1p36 tumor suppressor locus deletions and may hold potential for a synthetic lethality approach to GBM inhibition. ENO1 {{is one of three}} homologous genes (ENO2, ENO3) that encodes the mammalian alpha-enolase enzyme. ENO2, which encodes enolase 2, is mostly expressed in neural tissues, leading to the postulation that in ENO1-deleted GBM, ENO2 may be the ideal target as the redundant homologue of ENO1. Muller found that both genetic and pharmacological ENO2 inhibition in GBM cells with homozygous ENO1 deletion elicits a synthetic lethality outcome by selective killing of GBM cells). In 2016, Muller and colleagues discovered antibiotic SF2312 as a highly potent nanomolar-range enolase inhibitor which preferentially inhibits glioma cell proliferation and glycolytic flux in ENO1-deleted cells. SF2312 was shown to be more efficacious than pan-enolase inhibitor PhAH and have more specificity for ENO2 inhibition over ENO1. Subsequent work by the same team showed that the same approach could be applied to pancreatic cancer, whereby homozygously deleted SMAD4 results in the collateral deletion of mitochondrial malic enzyme 2 (ME2), an oxidative decarboxylase essential for redox homeostasis. Dey et al. show that ME2 genomic deletion in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells results in high endogenous reactive oxygen species, consistent with KRAS-driven pancreatic cancer, and essentially primes ME2-null cells for synthetic lethality by depletion of redundant NAD(P)+-dependent isoform ME3. The effects of ME3 depletion were found to be mediated by inhibition of de novo nucleotide synthesis resulting from AMPK activation and mitochondrial ROS-mediated apoptosis. Meanwhile, Oike et al. demonstrated the <b>generalizability</b> of the concept by targeting redundant essential-genes in process other than metabolism, namely the SMARCA4 and SMARCA2 subunits in the chromatin-remodeling SWI/SNF complex.|$|E

2500|$|A {{possible}} risk of raw feeding is that {{of human}} infection caused by direct or indirect exposure to bacterial pathogens in raw meat and animal stools. For example, the British Veterinary Association warns that humans [...] "risk exposing themselves to bacteria like Salmonella". A small study on the levels of salmonella in the stool of 10 dogs that ate a raw diet found that 80% of the raw diet tested positive for Salmonella and while 30 percent of the stool samples from dogs fed a raw food diet contained salmonella, none of the control dogs (commercial feed) contained Salmonella. The authors of the study concluded that dogs on a raw food diet may therefore {{be a source of}} environmental contamination, although they caution about the <b>generalizability</b> of their results due to the small number of dogs studied.|$|E
2500|$|A {{series of}} 2001 papers {{published}} in the Journal of Child Sexual Abuse discussed and criticized {{the findings of the}} Rind et al. study. Stephanie Dallam stated that, after reviewing the evidence, the paper was best described as [...] "an advocacy article that inappropriately uses science in an attempt to legitimatize its findings". Four other researchers also discussed possible flaws in the methodology and <b>generalizability</b> of Rind's findings, and concluded the paper's results were scientifically invalid. [...] The criticisms were co-{{published in the}} 2001 book Misinformation Concerning Child Sexual Abuse and Adult Survivors. [...] In 2002, a rebuttal to many of the claims made by critics was submitted to the APA journal, the American Psychologist by Scott Lilienfeld. [...] After passing a normal peer review, the editor of the journal re-submitted the article in secret and, {{on the basis of this}} second review, the paper was rejected. [...] Lilienfeld reported this subsequent rejection on several psychology Internet fora, which produced an intense response and resulted in the APA and American Psychologist ultimately printing the article as part of a special issue focusing on the controversy.|$|E

5000|$|With {{regard to}} the term of ‘generalizability’, Ellis (2004) points out that autoethnographic {{research}} seeks <b>generalizability</b> {{not just from the}} respondents but also from the readers. Ellis says, “I would argue that a story’s <b>generalizability</b> is always being tested - not in the traditional way through random samples of respondents, but by readers as they determine if a story speaks to them about their experience or about the lives of others they know. Readers provide theoretical validation by comparing their lives to ours, by thinking about how our lives are similar and different and the reasons why. Some stories inform readers about unfamiliar people or lives. We can ask, after Stake, ‘does the story have ‘naturalistic generalization’?’ meaning that it brings ‘felt’ news from one world to another and provides opportunities for the reader to have vicarious experience of the things told. (Stake, 1994) The focus of <b>generalizability</b> moves from respondents to readers.”(p.195) This <b>generalizability</b> through the resonance of readers’ lives and “lived experience”(Richardson, 1997) in autoethnographic work, intends to open up rather than close down conversation (Ellis, 2004, p. 22) ...|$|E

50|$|Scales {{should be}} tested for reliability, <b>generalizability,</b> and validity. <b>Generalizability</b> {{is the ability to}} make inferences from a sample to the population, given the scale you have selected. Reliability {{is the extent to which}} a scale will produce {{consistent}} results. Test-retest reliability checks how similar the results are if the research is repeated under similar circumstances. Alternative forms reliability checks how similar the results are if the research is repeated using different forms of the scale. Internal consistency reliability checks how well the individual measures included in the scale are converted into a composite measure.|$|E
50|$|Cronbach {{and others}} {{generalized}} some basic assumptions of classical test theory in their <b>generalizability</b> theory. If this theory {{is applied to}} test construction, then {{it is assumed that}} the items that constitute the test are a random sample from a larger universe of items. The expected score of a person in the universe is called the universe score, analogous to a true score. The <b>generalizability</b> is defined analogously as the variance of the universe scores divided by the variance of the observable scores, analogous to the concept of reliability in classical test theory. In this theory, Cronbach's alpha is an unbiased estimate of the <b>generalizability.</b> For this to be true the assumptions of essential -equivalence or parallelness are not needed. Consequently, Cronbach's alpha {{can be viewed as a}} measure of how well the sum score on the selected items capture the expected score in the entire domain, even if that domain is heterogeneous.|$|E
