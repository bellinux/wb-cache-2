Quinlan donated $40 million to the business school, which was renamed in his honor. During this time over 200,000 square-feet of LEED-certified sustainable spaces have been built on the Lake Shore Campus alone, along with significant mixed-use developments on the Water Tower Campus.|$|E
2500|$|In 1974, Stanford University {{graduate}} student David Gaines studied the Mono Lake ecosystem, {{and he became}} instrumental in alerting the public {{of the effects of}} the lower water level. The National Science Foundation funded the first comprehensive <b>ecological</b> <b>study</b> of Mono Lake, conducted by Gaines and under{{graduate student}}s from the University of California at Davis, the University of California at Santa Cruz, and Earlham College. In June 1977, the Davis Institute of Ecology of the University of California published a report, [...] "An <b>Ecological</b> <b>Study</b> of Mono Lake, California," [...] which alerted California to the ecological dangers posed by the redirection of water away from the lake for municipal uses.|$|E

Around {{the turn of the}} 20th century, the university began to expand significantly, hiring professors from eastern schools to teach in the newly organized professional colleges while also producing groundbreaking research in agricultural sciences. The [...] "Nebraska method" [...] of <b>ecological</b> <b>study</b> developed here during this time pioneered grassland ecology and laid the foundation for research in theoretical ecology {{for the rest of the}} 20th century. [...] The university is organized into eight colleges on two campuses in Lincoln with over 100 classroom buildings and research facilities.|$|E
