5|$|Sia {{is one of}} them. She comes in, singer-songwriter, {{she just}} writes the most {{beautiful}} amazing ballads. Now she is making a name for herself on a more broad commercial scale {{with a lot of}} more dance-driven stuff, and she is just an incredible singer. She came in and she just writes such serious songs, I was like 'Oh she is gunna be such a serious person, and I'm nervous to meet <b>her,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> just want her to get me and understand that I'm not a cheesy pop star'. She comes in and she was all nervous, and she is the most bubbliest person in the world, but once she starts singing and getting into her thing, you're just sucked into this world of 'wow' and it's inspiring to be around people with such creative energy. I love that, that's the best experience.|$|E

500|$|Tessa, and Kirsch's {{character}} Richie, {{were designed}} as MacLeod's mortal companions and contacts. Tessa and MacLeod are lovers and share deep feelings for each other. Adrian Paul commented that MacLeod spent twelve years with Tessa without wanting another relationship and that [...] "...she {{was a very}} important part of his life". Vandernoot thought that [...] "...the relationship between Tessa and MacLeod was very deep because very soon, he told her about himself (...) because he trusted <b>her,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think trust is a very good definition of their relationship. She trusted him entirely and he trusted her." [...] Tessa is thus MacLeod's only mortal lover who knows of his immortality.|$|E

500|$|Pinto had {{a middle}} class {{upbringing}} in the suburb of Malad. She first {{wanted to be an}} actress when she was five years old, often dressing up and imitating television actors during her childhood. She later recalled being inspired by Sushmita Sen's victory in the 1994 Miss Universe competition, explaining that [...] "the country was really proud of <b>her,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was like, one day, I want to do the same". Pinto attended the Carmel of St. Joseph School in Malad, and then studied at St. Xavier's College, Mumbai. Her major was in English literature, with minors in psychology and economics. At college, she participated in amateur theatre, but declined acting and modeling assignments until her graduation in 2005.|$|E
500|$|While {{looking for}} a new vocalist, Maia met Mulan Kwok, a {{performer}} at Barbados Cafe in Bilangan Kemang, Jakarta, in December 2004. Of this meeting, Maia later recalled [...] "When I met Mulan it was like meeting a new lover. I saw <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> liked her. Just fell in love." [...] Mulan was a café singer from Bandung who sang with Dimensi Band. She was asked to audition for the role and ultimately selected; her appointment was announced at a press conference on 7 April 2005. With Mulan, the group's concept, originally [...] "elegant", became [...] "coquettish and sexy". The group's musical style also changed; while originally R with light piano, it was changed to a rock sound with dominant guitars.|$|E

It'll be big, it'll probably be one of the bigger Beyoncé music videos ever done. And, I can say that I think the song is unbelievable. The Gaga thing took me by surprise, 'cause I've done videos for probably 15 years, and I had forgotten what it felt like to have a video premiere and have it be anticipated and have it explode. And yeah I hope the same for Beyoncé, but I don't know if that's gonna happen. It is a fantastic song, so I really hope that song catches for <b>her,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think the video's gonna be really fun and cool and different for her." ...|$|E

500|$|The network–ugh–they're {{so stupid}} sometimes. The shows [...] were doing good, they weren't big hits, {{but they were}} doing good. They felt that if they could put Paul [...] and Cleavon Little {{together}} {{that they would have}} a big hit. I didn't want to do that. I said I won't do it, not at the sacrifice of the show. It's wrong. I don't think it's a good idea. But they wanted to bring in somebody else {{as the head of the}} hospital.

500|$|At the Paley Festival Glee {{panel in}} March 2010, Murphy stated that Brittany and Santana {{would be seen}} to make out during the show's first season. Morris and Rivera only became aware of this after reading a Paley Festival report online. When they asked Murphy about the development, {{he claimed to have}} made the {{statement}} [...] "to get a kick" [...] out of the [...] "dirty guy" [...] asking about them. Murphy told Morris and Rivera that Glee would not push relationships to appease the show's fans, but would only pursue those which were [...] "organic and natural." [...] While there are moments on the show which depict Brittany and Santana as being very close to one another, Morris attributes these to her close relationship with Rivera: [...] "that is just Naya and I joking around with each other and being really close. It's always <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> just messing around and they end up using it." ...|$|E
500|$|Stephen, born on Christmas Eve {{and named}} for the first martyr of Christianity, dreams as a child that [...] "in some queer way she [...] Jesus". When she discovers that Collins, object of her {{childhood}} crush, has housemaid's knee, she prays that the affliction be transferred to her: [...] "I would like to wash Collins in my blood, Lord Jesus– I would like very much to be a Saviour to Collins– I love <b>her,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> want to be hurt like You were". This childish desire for martyrdom prefigures Stephen's ultimate self-sacrifice for Mary's sake. After she tricks Mary into leaving her– carrying out a plan that leads Valérie to exclaim [...] "you were made for a martyr!"– Stephen, left alone in her home, sees the room thronged with inverts, living, dead and unborn. They call on her to intercede with God for them, and finally possess her. It is with their collective voice that she demands of God, [...] "Give us also the right to our existence".|$|E

500|$|After the Seven Network dropped Neighbours in 1985, rival channel Network Ten {{picked the}} series up. It {{initially}} attracted low ratings and Ten began {{working hard to}} publicise the series. They revamped the show and added several new cast members. Kylie Minogue had had a fairly successful career as a child actress, having appeared in various television dramas, including Skyways and The Henderson Kids, but she was considering giving up acting after failing to find further work. After finishing her school exams in 1985, Minogue then auditioned {{for the role of}} Charlene. She attended the audition dressed as the character and won the role. Of hiring Minogue, Neighbours casting director Jan Russ commented [...] "Kylie had done a couple of things before I saw her, but she was only 18 and as shy as a mouse. She really hadn't evolved into anything at that stage, but the camera loved <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> knew I had my Charlene." [...] Minogue initially signed up to play Charlene for one week, this was then extended to 13 weeks and then through to mid-1988. She made her debut screen appearance in the episode broadcast on 17 April 1986.|$|E
500|$|As a final {{tribute to}} Pauline and Wendy Richard, the BBC aired a special {{television}} programme, EastEnders Revealed: Goodbye Pauline, which provided an emotional {{look back at}} Pauline's pivotal storylines during her time in Walford. It also reunited Wendy Richard with prior cast-mates Todd Carty and James Alexandrou (Mark and Martin respectively), and featured character commentary and tributes from television critics and EastEnders actors such as Anna Wing and Pam St. Clement (Lou and Pat). During the programme—which aired on New Year's Day, 2007—Wendy Richard reflected upon how [...] "proud" [...] she was of her character, commenting: [...] "Pauline had everything in life thrown at <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think she coped with it very well. It showed how people deal with their problems... She wasn't always grumpy... she did have lots of laughs, but sadly people don't seem to remember that, which is a shame... they still harp on about her wearing her cardigans and Pauline stopped wearing cardigans three years after EastEnders started. She is a good woman, she's a kind woman, a loving woman and all she ever thought about was her family. That {{was the most important}} thing in her life." ...|$|E

[...] Tom Parker, who wrote the liner notes for the 2003-release of Impossible Princess, had observed that critics slated [...] "Some Kind of Bliss" [...] due to Minogue's approach to [...] "obtain lyrical and production credibility, which was overshadowed in whole". Minogue publicly commented about the single's aftermath [...] "I think the static was that Elton had 75 percent of the sales that week, so mine didn't get off at a good start." [...] She went on to say [...] "I've told not to be frustrated, but I was frustrated because the album should be out [...] The point of it is to get it out and maybe people will like it, they may love it or they might hate it, but it was in my hands." [...] She also felt guilt for parting with Stock Aitken Waterman after her production team with Deconstruction was not in good terms; she later commented that she departed on [...] "good terms".|$|E

500|$|In his written {{confession}} {{released by}} Peruvian police, Van der Sloot recounted that he briefly left {{the hotel to}} get some coffee and bread, and returned to find Flores using his laptop computer without his permission. A police source stated {{that she may have}} found information linking him to the disappearance of Holloway. An altercation allegedly began, and she attempted to escape. According to the aforementioned written confession released by Peruvian authorities, Van der Sloot stated, [...] "I did not want to do it. The girl intruded into my private life [...] [...] [...] she didn't have any right. I went to <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> hit her. She was scared, we argued and she tried to escape. I grabbed her by the neck and hit her." [...] Van der Sloot reportedly stated that he was stoned on marijuana at the time. A detective linked to the case said that Van der Sloot considered getting rid of the body in a suitcase, but decided against it because he would have been stopped at the front desk. He then reportedly drank espresso and took amphetamines to counter fatigue before fleeing.|$|E
500|$|Emily Blunt plays Sergeant Rita Vrataski, {{a veteran}} who guides and trains Tom Cruise's character, Major William Cage. Blunt {{said of her}} role, [...] "In these male-fueled genres, it's usually the woman who's holding {{the hand of the}} guy and he's running through explosions leading <b>her,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> wanted to be doing the leading." [...] Chris Nashawaty, {{reviewing}} the film for Entertainment Weekly, called it [...] "the most feminist summer action flick in years". Bustles Alicia Lutes described Rita as [...] "ruthless and exacting in her takedown ... of a bunch of aliens" [...] and said: [...] "This is very much counter to the age-old ideals about ladies being the constant, delicate flowers of emotional heartstring-pulling." [...] Lutes noted how Cage's strength depended on Rita's guidance, as [...] "she trains him, aids him, and protects him (and in turn the fate of humanity) time and time again." [...] Tasha Robinson, writing a piece in The Dissolve about [...] "strong female characters" [...] that lack real purpose in films, said that Rita in Edge of Tomorrow was an exception. Robinson acknowledged that Rita existed to support Cage in his trials, but believed that [...] "the story doesn't degrade, devalue, weaken, or dismiss her".|$|E
500|$|Pamela's {{marriage}} to Bobby Ewing {{is central to}} understanding her character. The couple produced the opening scene of Dallas when the show first aired in 1978, with Bobby bringing his new bride home to meet Jock and Miss Ellie Ewing. [...] Their complex relationship has often been {{compared to that of}} Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. When asked about whether or not series creator David Jacobs had this parallel relationship in mind from the start, he said: [...] "Yes, guilty (laughs)". Relations can be made from William Shakespeare's two feuding families in Romeo and Juliet, the Montagues and the Capulets. These families represent the Barnes and the Ewing feuding families, with Pamela being portrayed as Juliet Capulet and Bobby as Romeo Montague. According to Patrick Duffy, being immediately paired off with Principal was a challenge. He said, [...] "We were {{in a constant state of}} competition. We were very territorial in front of the camera, and it was a strain." [...] However, their off-screen relationship significantly improved in the show's third season, with Duffy explaining: [...] "I developed an appreciation for <b>her,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think for the first time she started to trust me. Some of the best scenes on the show were between Victoria and me, and they happened after we got comfortable with each other." ...|$|E

The same website included Jasmine rejecting traditional standards of marriage second on its list of [...] "27 Feminist Disney Moments That Unapologetically Smashed The Patriarchy". Ranking Jasmine second on a list analyzing [...] "Which Disney Princess Most Embodies Feminist Principles", author Shannon Larson of The Huffington Post appreciated the character for rejecting the idea of marriage being necessary, asserting her right to marry whomever and owning her sexuality, but criticized {{the fact that she}} does not complete her attempt to escape royal oppression. Sonia Saraiya of Nerve ranked Jasmine fifth in her article [...] "Ranked: Disney Princesses From Least To Most Feminist". Saraiya praised her personality, likening her boldness, curiosity, and skepticism of marriage to that of Belle while commending her for [...] "falling for a completely inadequate 'street rat' and whisking him out of poverty, instead of the other way around." [...] However, Saraiya labeled Jasmine's use of sexuality her [...] "only power", criticizing her for sending a negative message to young girls. When questioned about whether or not Jasmine is a positive role model because [...] "all she wants to do is get married", Larkin defended her character, explaining, [...] "That's not true. Jasmine says to a generation of little kids about marriage that the law is wrong. She risks everything—her safety, her comfort, everything she knows—and goes out and finds a way to change the marriage law... Yeah, she's a good role model!' Really good! Whether it's connected or not, that person that the writers created that I got to portray, I'm so proud of <b>her.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> feel like she was ahead of her time." [...] Meanwhile, Jasmine's inability to recognize Aladdin despite his disguise has been met with controversy, comparing this characteristic to the relationship between Lois Lane and Clark Kent/Superman, and questioning the princess' intelligence.|$|E
