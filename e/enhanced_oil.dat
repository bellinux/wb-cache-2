25|$|<b>Enhanced</b> <b>oil</b> {{recovery}} (EOR) is {{a generic}} term for techniques used {{to increase the}} amount of crude oil that can be extracted from an oil field. In carbon capture and sequestration <b>enhanced</b> <b>oil</b> recovery (CCS EOR), carbon dioxide is injected into an oil field to recover oil that is often never recovered using more traditional methods.|$|E
25|$|Around 7 {{million tonnes}} per annum of carbon dioxide are {{recovered}} from ExxonMobil's Shute Creek gas processing plant in Wyoming, and transported by pipeline to various oil fields for <b>enhanced</b> <b>oil</b> recovery. This project has been operational since 1986.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} a project that will use CCS EOR is the Kemper Project in Mississippi. Due to the Kemper Project's close {{proximity}} to oil fields, the carbon dioxide byproduct from producing electricity will be transported to the neighboring oil fields for <b>enhanced</b> <b>oil</b> recovery.|$|E

30|$|Polyacrylamide {{microspheres}} {{have been}} successfully applied to reduce water production and <b>enhance</b> <b>oil</b> recovery in mature reservoirs with well-developed fractures or ultra-high permeability streaks/channels (Yao et al. 2012, 2013; Hua et al. 2013; Li et al. 2014). However, {{it is impossible to}} distinguish polyacrylamide microspheres from polyacrylamide that was used to <b>enhance</b> <b>oil</b> recovery and was already present in production fluids.|$|R

25|$|Summit’s Texas Clean Energy Project (TCEP) {{will be a}} coal-fueled, IGCC-based 400MW power/polygeneration project (also {{producing}} urea fertilizer), {{which will}} capture 90% of its CO2 in pre-combustion capture using the Rectisol process.

25|$|The {{objective}} of the Weyburn-Midale Carbon Dioxide Project is to increase oil production and extend the oil field’s lifetime through <b>Enhanced</b> <b>Oil</b> Recovery (EOR) by injecting the captured CO2 from the Dakota Gasification Company's Great Plains Synfuels Plant in North Dakota and SaskPower’s coal-fired Boundary Dam Power Station in Saskatchewan, Canada into the Weyburn oilfields.|$|E
25|$|The Kemper County IGCC Project, a 582 MW coal gasification-based power plant, {{will use}} {{pre-combustion}} capture of CO2 to capture 65% of the CO2 the plant produces, {{which will be}} utilized/geologically sequestered in <b>enhanced</b> <b>oil</b> recovery operations. If the technology used at the Kemper Project is successful, {{it will be the}} United States’ first clean coal plant.|$|E
30|$|It {{has been}} {{verified}} that addition of MA can control mobility of condensed water during steam flooding process thus to <b>enhance</b> <b>oil</b> recovery.|$|R
30|$|Surfactant loss due to {{adsorption}} {{is a major}} limitation {{during a}} surfactant flood for <b>enhancing</b> <b>oil</b> recovery since it causes surfactant retention which affects the economical feasibility of this process. Excessive surfactant retention results in adverse phase behavior properties, which cause the mobilized oil to be trapped again (Daoshan et al. 2004). This study includes adsorption analysis to quantify the amount of biosurfactant adsorbed in milligrams per gram of solid or crushed rocks. This was done to assess the applicability of using this biosurfactant for <b>enhancing</b> <b>oil</b> recovery and comparing its adsorption tendency {{to that of the}} commercially available chemical surfactants.|$|R
50|$|Three-phase heating (see Technology below) was {{originally}} created to <b>enhance</b> <b>oil</b> recovery. This design was patented in 1976 by Bill Pritchett of ARCO. The patent has expired {{and is now}} available for public use.|$|R
25|$|In 2011, a {{provision}} {{was added to}} the LCFS that allows refiners to receive credits for the deployment of innovative crude production technologies, such as carbon capture and sequestration or solar steam generation. Solar thermal <b>enhanced</b> <b>oil</b> recovery is a form of <b>enhanced</b> <b>oil</b> recovery (EOR), which is key to harvesting California’s heavy crude. Currently, California uses EOR to help produce about 60% of its crude output. By using solar power instead of natural gas to create steam for EOR, solar steam generation reduces the amount of emissions produced during oil extraction, thus lowering the overall carbon intensity of crude. California currently has two solar EOR projects in operation, one in McKittrick, operated by LINN Energy (formerly Berry Petroleum) using enclosed trough technology from GlassPoint Solar, and another in Coalinga operated by Chevron Corporation using BrightSource Energy power tower technology. CARB is currently considering an amendment to allow upstream operators to receive credits for deploying innovative crude production technologies.|$|E
25|$|Mississippi Power’s Kemper Project is in late {{stages of}} construction. It {{will be a}} lignite-fuel IGCC plant, {{generating}} a net 524 MW of power from syngas, while capturing over 65% of CO2 generated using the Selexol process. The technology at the Kemper facility, Transport-Integrated Gasification (TRIG), was developed and is licensed by KBR. The CO2 will be sent by pipeline to depleted oil fields in Mississippi for <b>enhanced</b> <b>oil</b> recovery operations.|$|E
25|$|The Saskatchewan Government's Boundary Dam Power Station Integrated Carbon Capture and Sequestration Demonstration Project {{will use}} post-combustion, amine-based {{scrubber}} technology to capture 90% of the CO2 emitted by Unit 3 {{of the power}} plant; this CO2 will be pipelined to and utilized for <b>enhanced</b> <b>oil</b> recovery in the Weyburn oil fields. However, only about a half of this CO2 will actually be permanently stored, the remainder is released into the atmosphere during capturing, and the processing in the oil field.|$|E
40|$|The pore-scale {{effects of}} seismic {{stimulation}} on two-phase flow are modeled numerically in random 2 D grain 0 pack geometries. Seismic stimulation aims to <b>enhance</b> <b>oil</b> production by sending seismic waves across a reservoir to liberate immobile patches of oil. For seismic amplitudes above a well-defined (analytically expressed) dimensionless criterion, the force perturbation {{associated with the}} waves indeed can liberate oil trapped on capillary barriers and get it flowing again under the background pressure gradient. Subsequent coalescence of the freed oil droplets acts to <b>enhance</b> <b>oil</b> movement further because longer bubbles overcome capillary barriers more efficiently than shorter bubbles do. Poroelasticity theory defines the effective force that a seismic wave adds to the background fluid-pressure gradient. The lattice-Boltzmann model in two dimensions is used to perform pore-scale numerical simulations. Dimensionless numbers (groups of material and force parameters) involved in seismic stimulation are defined carefully so that numerical simulations {{can be applied to}} field-scale conditions. Using the analytical criteria defined in the paper, there is a significant range of reservoir conditions over which seismic stimulation can be expected to <b>enhance</b> <b>oil</b> production...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This {{article is}} an {{overview}} of potential application of wettability modifier to <b>enhance</b> <b>oil</b> recovery in carbonate reservoir. In oil and gas industry, oil recovery {{can be divided into}} three stages which are primary recovery, secondary recovery and tertiary recovery. The primary recovery is the initial stages of oil recovery. At this stage, oil was displaced toward production well by natural drive mechanisms that naturally exist in the reservoir. Water is commonly used to <b>enhance</b> <b>oil</b> recovery by injected into the reservoir because of it is commercially available, less expensive and capable to maintain the reservoir pressure. In conclusion, smart water flooding is a new technique to solve the complexity problem of carbonate reservoir by manipulating the salinity and ionic composition in high temperature. Hence, smart water can be an excellent candidate as a displacing fluid in chemical flooding for <b>enhanced</b> the <b>oil</b> recovery (EOR) ...|$|R
25|$|In the past, {{the natural}} gas which was {{recovered}} {{in the course of}} recovering petroleum could not be profitably sold, and was simply burned at the oil field in a process known as flaring. Flaring is now illegal in many countries. Additionally, higher demand in the last 20–30 years has made production of gas associated with oil economically viable. As a further option, the gas is now sometimes re-ed into the formation for <b>enhanced</b> <b>oil</b> recovery by pressure maintenance as well as miscible or immiscible flooding. Conservation, re-injection, or flaring of natural gas associated with oil is primarily dependent on proximity to markets (pipelines), and regulatory restrictions.|$|E
25|$|Crude oil {{development}} and production in U.S. oil reservoirs can include {{up to three}} distinct phases: primary, secondary, and tertiary (or enhanced) recovery. During primary recovery only about 10 percent of a reservoir's original oil in place is typically produced. Secondary recovery techniques extend a field's productive life generally by injecting water or gas to displace oil and drive it to a production wellbore, resulting in the recovery of 20 to 40 percent of the original oil in place. However, {{with much of the}} easy-to-produce oil already recovered from U.S. oil fields, producers have attempted several tertiary, or <b>enhanced</b> <b>oil</b> recovery, techniques that offer prospects for ultimately producing 30 to 60 percent, or more, of the reservoir's original oil in place.|$|E
25|$|The Petra Nova {{project is}} a billion dollar {{endeavour}} taken upon by NRG Energy and JP Nippon to retrofit their jointly owned W.A Parish coal-fired power plant with post-combustion carbon capture. The plant, which is located in Thompsons, Texas (just outside of Houston), entered commercial service in 1977, and carbon capture began operation on January 10, 2017. The plant generates 240 MW and 90% of the CO2 (or 1.4 million tonnes) is captured per year. The carbon dioxide captured (99% purity) from the power plant is compressed and piped about 82 miles to West Ranch Oil Field, Texas, {{where it will be}} used for <b>enhanced</b> <b>oil</b> recovery. The field has a capacity of 60 million barrels of oil and is expected to increase oil production by a factor of 506. This project is expected to run for at least another 20 years.|$|E
30|$|Blunt et al. (1993) {{stated the}} usage of carbon dioxide in <b>enhancing</b> <b>oil</b> recovery. A {{projection}} was made that for every kilogram of CO 2 injection, an approximate amount of one to one quarter of additional oil was recovered.|$|R
30|$|Smart nano-EOR {{has also}} been {{examined}} via the use of carbonate rocks. Several types of nanoparticles have been tested to <b>enhance</b> <b>oil</b> recovery by different scenarios. The results verified the effectiveness of nanoparticle flooding in carbonate reservoirs (Haroun et al. 2012).|$|R
40|$|Ultra-low {{permeability}} reservoirs {{have the}} characteristics of complex pore throat structure, generally higher injection pressure and lower oil recovery. By means of casting thin sections, pore structure of selected ultra-low permeability core was surveyed. The core was classified into low porosity, low permeability and without natural fractures. Vast majority of throats of the core varied in width from 2. 5 μm to 15 μm. Core displacement experiments showed that surfactant flooding could have certain effect of reducing injection pressure and <b>enhancing</b> <b>oil</b> recovery. When interfacial tension was 5. 93 × 10 - 2 mN/m, decompression rate reached 7. 65 %, and recovery was improved by 4. 09 %. And when interfacial tension was 4. 9 × 10 - 5 mN/m, decompression rate reached 25 %, and recovery was improved by 11. 6 %. The lower interfacial tension is, the better the effect of reducing injection pressure is, and the higher the extent of <b>enhancing</b> <b>oil</b> recovery is. In general, surfactants have a great application prospect on the oil field development of ultra-low permeability reservoir, and the interfacial tension should be reduced as far as possible.

25|$|CO2 {{can bind to}} the MOF surface through either {{physisorption}} or chemisorption, where physisorption occurs through van der Waals {{interactions and}} chemisorption occurs through covalent bonds being formed between the CO2 and MOF surface. Once the MOF is saturated with CO2, the MOF would then be regenerated (CO2 {{is removed from the}} MOF to be transported elsewhere for sequestration or <b>enhanced</b> <b>oil</b> recovery) through either a temperature swing or a pressure swing. In a temperature swing, the MOF would be heated up until CO2 desorbs; temperature swing regeneration is usually used in post-combustion configurations where the heat is supplied from heat exchangers with the power plant. To achieve working capacities comparable to the amine solvent process, the MOF must be heated up to around 200 C. In a pressure swing, the pressure would be decreased until CO2 desorbs; this would usually be used in a pre-combustion carbon capture configuration.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{difference}} between a barrel of oil, which is a measure of oil, and a barrel of oil equivalent (BOE), which is a measure of energy. Many sources of energy, such as fission, solar, wind, and coal, are not subject to the same near-term supply restrictions that oil is. Accordingly, even an oil source with an EROEI of 0.5 can be usefully exploited if the energy required to produce that oil comes from a cheap and plentiful energy source. Availability of cheap, but hard to transport, natural gas in some oil fields has led to using natural gas to fuel <b>enhanced</b> <b>oil</b> recovery. Similarly, natural gas in huge amounts is used to power most Athabasca tar sands plants. Cheap natural gas has also led to ethanol fuel produced with a net EROEI of less than 1, although figures in this area are controversial because methods to measure EROEI are in debate.|$|E
25|$|Although U.N. {{sanctions}} were suspended in 1999, foreign investment was curtailed {{due to the}} U.S. Iran and Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA), which capped the annual amount foreign companies can invest in Libya at $20 million (lowered from $40 million in 2001). On 14 August 2003, Libya agreed to compensate families of the 1988 bombing with $2.7 billion, {{to be released in}} three tranches; the first following a lifting of UN sanctions, the second after lifting of US sanctions, and the third after Libya is removed from the U.S. State Department's state sponsors of terrorism list. On 22 December 2003, Libya announced it would abandon WMD programs and comply with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The US welcomed the move, but said it would maintain economic sanctions until it saw evidence of compliance. On 4 June 2004, US Assistant Secretary of Commerce William H. Lash announced that Libya had sent its first shipment of crude oil to the US since resumption of ties between the two countries. In May 2006, the U.S. officially removed Libya from its list of states that sponsor terrorism and normalized ties and removed sanctions. Since then, oil majors have stepped up exploration efforts for oil and natural gas in the country. Likewise, companies have tried using <b>enhanced</b> <b>oil</b> recovery (EOR) techniques to increase production at maturing fields.|$|E

Mechanisms by which chemical agent <b>enhance</b> <b>oil</b> recovery of heavy oil reservoir water flooding are: (1) improving mobility ratio by significantly decreasing viscosity of heavy oil, volumetric sweep efficiency is improved; (2) increasing capillary number by significantly decreasing oil-water interfacial tension, oil displacement efficiency is increased; (3) changing wettability {{of the rock}} surface from oil-wet to water-wet by significantly reducing the contact angle between displacement liquid and sandstone surface, capillary force is changed from the resistance force to the motive force, the residual oil is expelled from the small pores and the wall of pores, oil displacement efficiency is significantly increased...|$|R
40|$|Introducing {{the novel}} {{technique}} for <b>enhancing</b> <b>oil</b> recovery from available petroleum reservoirs {{is one of}} the important issues in future energy demands. Among of all operative factors, wettability may be the foremost parameter affecting residual oil saturation in all stage of oil recovery. Although wettability alteration {{is one of the}} methods which <b>enhance</b> <b>oil</b> recovery from the petroleum reservoir. Recently, the studies which focused on this subject were more than the past and many contributions have been made on this area. The main objective of the current study is experimentally investigation of the two nonionic surfactants effects on altering wettability of reservoir rocks. Purpose of this work is to change the wettability to preferentially the water-wet condition. Also reducing the residual oil saturation (Sor) is the other purpose of this work. The wettability alteration of reservoir rock is measured by two main quantitative methods namely contact angle and the USBM methods. Results of this study showed that surfactant flooding is more effective in oil-wet rocks to change their wettability and consequently reducing Sor to a low value. Cedar (Zizyphus Spina Christi) is low priced, absolutely natural, and abundantly accessible in the Middle East and Central Asia.
