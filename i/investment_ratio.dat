In general, genetic theory makes good predictions about sexual investment in ant populations, but understanding colony-level variance in sex <b>investment</b> <b>ratios</b> has proven more difficult. Recently, however, more studies have addressed ecological factors that influence colony-level sex <b>investment</b> <b>ratios.</b> Food availability, in particular, has been manipulated because larval nutrition influences female caste determination, thus implying that resource availability should be of critical importance for colony sex <b>investment</b> <b>ratios.</b> However, results from food supplementation experiments are equivocal, {{and it is clear}} that ant colony response to food supplementation is dependent on the ecological background of the population. We presented field colonies of the ant Myrmica brevispinosa with two food types (proteins and carbohydrates), and assessed their relative impact on colony-level sex <b>investment</b> <b>ratios.</b> We show that colonies receiving carbohydrate enhancement invested in more female sexuals and produced more female-biased sex allocation ratios than protein-fed or control colonies. Thus, our study is the first, to our knowledge, to demonstrate that sex ratios in social insect colonies might be sensitive to resource quality. Male investment was not influenced by food treatment, but was positively correlated with colony size. Therefore, the shift in sex ratios in our study must have been mediated through nutritional influences on female caste determination rather than male brood elimination. We also used our data to evaluate evidence for sex ratio compensation by queenright colonies in response to male production by workers from orphaned colonies...|$|R

Using new data, I compute industry-adjusted valuation, profitability, leverage, and <b>investment</b> <b>ratios</b> for thirty-six large, acquisitive conglomerates from 1966 to 1974. During the early 1970 s, the conglomerates were less valuable and less profitable than standalone firms, favoring an agency explanation for unrelated diversification. In the 1960 s, however, conglomerates were not valued at a discount. Evidence from acquisition histories suggests that conglomerate diversification may have added value by creating internal capital markets...|$|R
50|$|The <b>investment</b> sex <b>ratio</b> for P. japonicus is 4.61:1 (reproductive {{females to}} males). This ratio is {{expected}} to be female-biased when workers triumph in the conflict with queens, and unbiased when a foundress queen succeeds. If all males originate from eggs of workers, then the <b>investment</b> <b>ratios</b> are expected to be unbiased. If the workers are triumphant, then they can select for their offspring and differentially feed males and females. In the case of P. japonicus, protandrous production accounts for the strongly female-biased investment ration. Protandrous production is when reproductive females are created after males. It has been suggested {{that as a result of}} sexual selection, protandry forms a preadaptation that gives the queen more power to control the production of males and the sex ratio. The control of the sex ratio is not from the competition and actions of the workers while they rear the brood, but rather due to the ability of the foundress queen to control the percentage of eggs that she lays and fertilizes.|$|R
