25|$|For example, in the {{petroleum}} industry, sodium hydroxide {{is used as}} an additive in <b>drilling</b> <b>mud</b> to increase alkalinity in bentonite mud systems, to increase the mud viscosity, and to neutralize any acid gas (such as hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide) which may be encountered in the geological formation as drilling progresses.|$|E

40|$|At a pilot {{site for}} CO_{ 2 } storage in Ketzin (Germany), a drastic {{decrease}} in injectivity {{occurred in a}} well intended for injection. This was attributed to an obstruction of the pore throats due to microbial degradation of the organic <b>drill</b> <b>mud</b> and subsequent iron sulfide (FeS) precipitation in the highly saline brine (240 g L^{- 1 }). To better understand the biogeochemical processes, {{the response of the}} autochthonous microbial community to <b>drill</b> <b>mud</b> exposure was investigated. Pristine cores of two aquifers with different salinity were incubated under simulated in situ conditions (50 bar, 40 °C and 45 bar, 25 °C, respectively) and CO_{ 2 } atmosphere. For the first time, rock cores obtained from the CO_{ 2 } plume of the storage formation were investigated. The influence of acetate as a biodegradation product of <b>drill</b> <b>mud</b> polymers and the effectiveness of a biocide were additionally tested. Increased microbial diversities were observed in all long-term (8 - 20 weeks) incubations, even including biocide. Biofilm-like structures and small round-shaped minerals of probable microbiological origin were found. The results indicate that the microbial community remains viable after long-term CO_{ 2 } exposure. Microorganisms hydrolyzing cellulose polymers (e. g., Burkholderia spp., Variovorax spp.) biodegraded organic components of the <b>drill</b> <b>mud</b> and most likely produced low molecular weight acids. Although the effects of <b>drill</b> <b>mud</b> were less strong as observed in situ, it was demonstrated that acetate supports the growth of sulfate-reducing bacteria (i. e., Desulfotomaculum spp.). The microbial-induced precipitation of amorphous FeS reduced the injectivity in the near-well area. Therefore, when using organic <b>drill</b> <b>mud,</b> the well must be cleaned intensively to minimize the hazards of bacterial stimulation...|$|R

40|$|Due to some {{drawbacks}} {{of conventional}} drilling methods and drilling tools, {{the application of}} hydraulic hammers with a fluidic amplifier have been extensively popularized since its emergence in recent years. However, the performance life of a fluidic amplifier is still unsatisfactory in oil and gas wells drilling, especially the heavy wear or erosion of the fluidic amplifier leads to the reduction of service life time of hydraulic hammers, which {{is derived from the}} incision of <b>drilling</b> <b>muds</b> with high speed and pressure. In order to investigate the influence of <b>drilling</b> <b>muds,</b> such as particle size, solid content and jet velocity, on the antierosion property of a fluidic amplifier, several groups of <b>drilling</b> <b>muds</b> with different performance parameters have been utilized to numerical simulation on basis of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Simulation results have shown that the jet nozzle of fluidic amplifiers is primarily abraded, afterwards are the lateral plates and the wedge of the fluidic amplifier, which shows extraordinary agreement with the actual cases of fluidic amplifier in drilling process. It can be concluded that particle size, solid content and jet velocity have a great influence on the anti-erosion property of a fluidic amplifier, and the erosion rate linearly varies with the particle size of <b>drilling</b> <b>muds,</b> nevertheless exponentially varies with solid content and jet velocity of <b>drilling</b> <b>muds.</b> As to improve the service life time of a fluidic amplifier, the mud purification system or low solid clay-free mud system is suggested in the operation of directional well drillin...|$|R
