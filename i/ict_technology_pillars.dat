Design/methodology/approach – An on-line questionnaire survey was conducted to gather information about supply chain management operations, supplier relationship management and the <b>ICT</b> <b>technologies</b> used by contractor firms to manage their extended supply chain tiers. Findings – The extended supply chain relationships of contractor firms are primarily composed of contractual, technical and financial entities, but findings suggest that the vision to consider extended supply chain firms when selecting suppliers are still myopic. Majority of <b>ICT</b> <b>technologies</b> are used between Tier 1 supply chain firms and there is an inconsistency in the number of technologies adopted with the extended supply chain tiers. Despite having a high involvement relationship with Tier 2 downstream firms, findings indicate a lack of use of <b>ICT</b> <b>technologies</b> to manage the organisational, personal and technological interactions with these firms. Research limitations/implications – On the basis of different relationship types this study develops an initial framework for management of supply chains that are facilitated by relevant <b>ICT</b> <b>technologies.</b> Originality/value – This paper provides insights into the management of extended supply chain firms by contractor firms from a relationship-centric perspective and develops an initial framework for relationship-centric supply chain management...|$|R

Data were collected using semi-structured interviews, observations and available documents. The {{study found that the}} principal’s role as a <b>technology</b> (<b>ICT)</b> leader who possesses a positive attitude towards <b>technology</b> (<b>ICT)</b> is very crucial for promoting its use in the school. The principal as a <b>technology</b> (<b>ICT)</b> leader adopts various strategies like provision of resources, equal access to all, technical support and backup, opportunities for professional development in <b>technology</b> (<b>ICT)</b> for staff, to promote the use of technology in the school. The principal holds a vision for <b>technology</b> (<b>ICT)</b> use which works as a driving force for the use of ICT in the school. In order to achieve the vision of <b>technology</b> (<b>ICT),</b> the principal has provided free and easy access to all ICT resources, with proper technical support and backup. The principal is monitoring the use of the ICT resources and the teaching and learning that takes place using technology through the help of technical support persons. The principal was also found to be supportive of the professional development of the teachers in the use of <b>technology</b> (<b>ICT)</b> in their classrooms. The findings of the study coincide with what the literature says about <b>technology</b> (<b>ICT)</b> leadership in schools. This shows that context does not have an obvious effect on the ICT leadership; however, the attitude of the principal towards the use of <b>technology</b> (<b>ICT)</b> has helped him emerge as a <b>technology</b> (<b>ICT)</b> leader. The presence of technology in the school and the principals’ positive attitude towards the use of <b>technology</b> (<b>ICT)</b> for transforming the traditional teaching and learning has motivated the principal to provide the necessary technology leadership...|$|R

In fact, there are several different ways that ICT helps people on health, some <b>ICT</b> <b>technologies</b> are used to diagnose morbidities, some <b>ICT</b> <b>technologies</b> concentrate on curative machines, while some others contribute to support people to take care of health. However, limited research has studied how ICT support people to take care of health, and wearable in particular. This paper analysis the influence of wearable devices, which are not medicines and can not cure the sickness. What a wearable device can probably do is telling users about some basic indexes, supervise people to take care of heath and help them to get away from sicknesses.
