25|$|There was {{therefore}} no wholesale displacement of native lords in Scotland. In 1200 all the earls north of Forth and Clyde were still of Celtic descent; and {{as late as}} 1286, eight of the earldoms in Scotland {{were still in the}} hands of those of native stock. Many native lords were granted or confirmed in their lands in feudal form. Within a few generations, regular intermarriage and the Wars of Independence had removed most of the differences between native and <b>incomer,</b> although not those between Highlander and Lowlander.|$|E
25|$|Private car {{ownership}} in Shanghai has been rapidly increasing in recent years, {{but a new}} private car cannot be driven until the owner buys a license in the monthly private car license plate auction. Around 11,500 license plates are auctioned each month and the average price is about 84,000 RMB ($12,758). According to the municipal regulation in 2016, only those who are Shanghai registered residents or have paid social insurance or individual <b>incomer</b> tax for over 3 years in a row. The purpose of this policy is to limit the growth of automobile traffic and to alleviate congestion.|$|E

2500|$|During the 1960s Yell {{reached an}} impasse. It was in 1965 that the Orcadian novelist Eric Linklater said that Yell was [...] "the problem {{child of the}} archipelago" [...] due to its {{economic}} woes and burgeoning depopulation. Some blamed this on the islanders’ [...] "social egalitarianism", which supposedly prevented anyone from becoming a [...] "leader or entrepreneur"; Haswell-Smith disagrees but believes that [...] "airing the matter seems to have helped” It is certainly notable that the tiny remote Out Skerries seem to be wealthier and that Whalsay is better at retaining its population. Yell is neither near Lerwick like Bressay nor bridged to the mainland like Burra or Muckle Roe. Some Yell people do commute to work at Sullom Voe, but as {{this appears to be}} a declining industry this does not hold out hope for the future. Unlike neighbouring Fetlar, Yell never suffered large scale clearances, only some local ones, and has long had multiple ownership. Jim Crumley, himself an <b>incomer,</b> has noted the difficulties faced by Yell by both depopulation and repopulation.|$|E
2500|$|Upon Alexander's {{death in}} 1124, David succeeded to the throne. The latter's {{subsequent}} endowment of Annandale to Robert de Brus (died 1142) {{appears to have}} not only signalled the Scottish Crown's intention of consolidating control of the region, but served as a declaration of the kingdom's claims to Cumbria. Fergus' marriage to Henry I's daughter, which appears to date to about this period, may have been arranged with such developments in mind. If so, the union could have been orchestrated {{as a means to}} not only compensate for Ranulf's removal, but to counter the dramatic rise of David and the resultant imbalance of power his ascent created. With Ranulf thus vacated from the north, Henry I had filled the power vacuum with various so-called [...] "new men". One such <b>incomer</b> may have been Robert de Brus, a Norman who had previously received extensive lands from the English Crown. In fact, it is possible that it was in the wake of Ranulf's removal that Robert de Brus originally received the lordship of Annandale. If so, the latter may have been inserted into the region by Henry I, or perhaps through collaborative effort between Henry I and his then-vassal David as a means of securing the Anglo-Scottish border. The apparent rise of Fergus at about this time may have also played a part in the infeftment of Annandale.|$|E

60|$|Then the long, rangy MacNeff, home-run hitter for Place, faced Ken. His {{position}} at bat bothered Ken, for he stood almost on the plate.

If {{he had hit}} the ball {{it would have been}} with the handle of his bat. So Ken, knowing his control, and sure that he could pitch high shoots all day over the <b>incomer</b> of the plate, had no more fear of the Place slugger.

6000|$|I {{remember}} a conversation {{at the door}} of one saloon which was as characteristic for its brevity as it was a type of the prevailing stoicism. [...] "Hello!" [...] said a departing miner, as he recognized a brother miner coming in, [...] "when did you come down?" [...] "This morning," [...] was the reply. [...] "Made a strike on the bar?" [...] suggested the first speaker. [...] "You bet!" [...] said the other, and passed in. I chanced an hour later to be at the same place as they met again--their relative positions changed. [...] "Hello! Whar now?" [...] said the <b>incomer.</b> [...] "Back to the bar." [...] "Cleaned out?" [...] "You bet!" [...] Not a word more explained a common situation.|$|E

I should have recommended the holding up of feet under the table lest, mistaken for other feet, they should be trodden on and pressed. Also, I should have advised against entry into any room unpreceded by what in Stageland is termed [...] "noise without." [...] It is somewhat disconcerting to the nervous <b>incomer</b> to be met, the door still in his hand, by a sound as of people springing suddenly into the air, followed by a weird scuttling of feet, and then to discover the occupants sitting stiffly in opposite corners, deeply engaged in book or needlework. But, as I have said, with regard to some households, such precautions might be needless.|$|E

6000|$|I {{get along}} with my papers for Scribner not fast, nor so far {{specially}} well; only this last, the fourth one (which makes a third part of my whole task), I do believe is pulled off after a fashion. It is a mere sermon: [...] "Smith opens out";[24] but it is true, and I find it touching and beneficial, to me at least; and I {{think there is some}} fine writing in it, some very apt and pregnant phrases. Pulvis et Umbra, I call it; I might have called it a Darwinian Sermon, if I had wanted. Its sentiments, although parsonic, will not offend even you, I believe. The other three papers, I fear, bear many traces of effort, and the ungenuine inspiration of an income at so much per essay, and the honest desire of the <b>incomer</b> to give good measure for his money. Well, I did my damndest anyway.|$|E
60|$|I {{could not}} but admire, even {{at such a}} moment, {{the way in which}} a {{dominant}} spirit asserted itself. In all our hunting parties and adventures {{in different parts of the}} world, Quincey Morris had always been the one to arrange the plan of action, and Arthur and I had been accustomed to obey him implicitly. Now, the old habit seemed to be renewed instinctively. With a swift glance around the room, he at once laid out our plan of attack, and without speaking a word, with a gesture, placed us each in position. Van Helsing, Harker, and I were just behind the door, so that when it was opened the Professor could guard it whilst we two stepped between the <b>incomer</b> and the door. Godalming behind and Quincey in front stood just out of sight ready to move in front of the window. We waited in a suspense that made the seconds pass with nightmare slowness. The slow, careful steps came along the hall. The Count was evidently prepared for some surprise, at least he feared it.|$|E

40|$|In this work, we analyse all {{existing}} data {{related to}} the number of <b>incomers</b> and outcomers (who actually obtain the degree) of the following courses offered at the Federal University of Santa Catarina: physics teaching, bachelor in physics, master of sciences in physics and doctorate in physics, corresponding to the 1998 - 2017 period, according to their availability. The data point towards a great male predominance (larger than 76 %) and a huge evasion of both sexes (in average, less than 20 % of the undergraduate <b>incomers</b> obtain the degree), the evasion being lower in the postgraduate courses and always slightly higher for women. The average number of <b>incomers</b> and outcomers per year decreases as the students advance from graduate to postgraduate courses, although many students in the postgraduate courses come from other institutions. The proportion of women decreases as the carrier advances. The results indicate the need of complementary studies that can help the identification of the causes of such a high evasion in order to minimize them.
