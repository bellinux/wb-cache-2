40|$|Object {{detection}} <b>in</b> <b>videos</b> {{has drawn}} increasing attention recently {{with the introduction}} of the large-scale ImageNet VID dataset. Different from object detection in static images, temporal information <b>in</b> <b>videos</b> is vital for object detection. To fully utilize temporal information, state-of-the-art methods are based on spatiotemporal tubelets, which are essentially sequences of associated bounding boxes across time. However, the existing methods have major limitations in generating tubelets in terms of quality and efficiency. Motion-based methods are able to obtain dense tubelets efficiently, but the lengths are generally only several frames, which is not optimal for incorporating long-term temporal information. Appearance-based methods, usually involving generic object tracking, could generate long tubelets, but are usually computationally expensive. In this work, we propose a framework for object detection <b>in</b> <b>videos,</b> which consists of a novel tubelet proposal network to efficiently generate spatiotemporal proposals, and a Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) network that incorporates temporal information from tubelet proposals for achieving high object detection accuracy <b>in</b> <b>videos.</b> Experiments on the large-scale ImageNet VID dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for object detection <b>in</b> <b>videos.</b> Comment: CVPR 201...|$|R

40|$|We {{develop a}} novel {{framework}} for action localization <b>in</b> <b>videos.</b> We propose the Tube Proposal Network (TPN), which can generate generic, class-independent, video-level tubelet proposals <b>in</b> <b>videos.</b> The generated tubelet proposals can be utilized <b>in</b> various <b>video</b> analysis tasks, including recognizing and localizing actions <b>in</b> <b>videos.</b> <b>In</b> particular, we integrate these generic tubelet proposals into a unified temporal deep network for action classification. Compared with other methods, our generic tubelet proposal method is accurate, general, and is fully differentiable under a smoothL 1 loss function. We demonstrate {{the performance of}} our algorithm on the standard UCF-Sports, J-HMDB 21, and UCF- 101 datasets. Our class-independent TPN outperforms other tubelet generation methods, and our unified temporal deep network achieves state-of-the-art localization results on all three datasets...|$|R
