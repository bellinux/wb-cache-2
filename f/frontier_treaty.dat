25|$|The Nazi-Soviet treaty {{process was}} {{continued}} with the German–Soviet <b>Frontier</b> <b>Treaty</b> signed on 28 September. It adjusted and finalized the territorial division, placing Lithuania within the Soviet sphere and moving the Soviet-German agreed boundary east from the Vistula to the Bug River, and authorized further joint action to control occupied Poland. An idea of retaining a residual Polish state, considered earlier, was abandoned.|$|E
25|$|Stalin {{suggested}} a territorial exchange with Germany, {{giving them the}} ethnic Polish-dominated areas of Lublin Province and part of Warsaw Province, and in return receiving Lithuania; Stalin had desired the reintegration of the three Baltic states into the Soviet Union. This was agreed in 28 September. A German–Soviet <b>Frontier</b> <b>Treaty</b> was signed shortly after, in Stalin's presence. The two nations continued trading, undermining the British blockade of Germany.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the terms}} of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact and the German–Soviet <b>Frontier</b> <b>Treaty,</b> the Soviet Union annexed all Polish {{territory}} east of the line of the rivers Pisa, Narew, Bug and San, except for the area around Vilnius (known in Polish as Wilno), which was given to Lithuania, and the Suwałki region, which was annexed by Germany. These territories were largely inhabited by Ukrainians and Belarusians, with minorities of Poles and Jews (for numbers see Curzon Line). The total area, including the area given to Lithuania, was 201,000 square kilometres, with a population of 13.2 million. A small strip of land that was a part of Hungary before 1914 was given to Slovakia.|$|E

[...] The horror of the losses gave pause to further expansion. More importantly, the Royal government had broken its obligations toward settlers, and thus with the Tidewater aristocracy when it refused to honor recent <b>frontier</b> <b>treaties</b> with the Proclamation of 1763. The proclamation {{was the result of}} secret negotiation between the Royal government and Indian tribes by which the frontier settlers were deprived of their land and property and any further expansion westward of British colonies was permanently halted.|$|R
5|$|In the Balkan <b>frontier,</b> the <b>Treaty</b> of Devol {{marked the}} end of the Norman threat to the {{southern}} Adriatic littoral during Alexios' reign and later; the efficacy of the frontier defenses deterred any further invasions through Dyrrachium for most of the 12th century.|$|R
25|$|One of {{the most}} infamous secret {{treaties}} in history was the secret additional protocol to the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of August 23, 1939 between Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, negotiated by Soviet foreign minister Vyacheslav Molotov and German foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop. The pact itself, a ten-year nonaggression agreement, was public, but the Additional Secret Protocol (superseded by a similar subsequent secret protocol, the German-Soviet <b>Frontier</b> <b>Treaty,</b> the next month) carved up spheres of influence in Eastern Europe between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, placing Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Bessarabia (part of Romania), and eastern Poland in the Soviet sphere, and western Poland and Lithuania in the German sphere. The existence of the secret protocol was not revealed until 1989; when it became public, it caused outrage in the Baltic states.|$|E

Jews engaged in trade, crafts, carter, agriculture, and professional activities. Jewish cultural institutions included a large library and a sports club. On 8-11 September 1939 Sambor was overrun by the 1st Mountain Division of the Wehrmacht during the Polish Battle of Lwów.

It followed the Anglo-Nepalese War, 1814-1816. In return, the British were given trading rights and rights of passage {{up to the}} Tibet <b>frontier.</b> The <b>treaty</b> was signed at Titalia, now known as Tetulia Upazila, in the Rangpur District of present-day Bangladesh.

5|$|Cassel was {{annexed to}} France the {{following}} year {{under the terms of}} the Treaty of Nijmegen, which ended the war.

In addition, the revised <b>frontier</b> following the <b>treaty</b> was now a significant distance from Cassel and without the proximity of the border, the town was no longer seen as having much strategic significance.|$|R

The German invasion began on 1 September 1939, one week after the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, while the Soviet invasion commenced on 17 September following the Molotov-Tōgō agreement that terminated the Russian and Japanese hostilities in the east on 16 September.

5000|$|Secret {{protocols}} of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, adjusted by the German-Soviet <b>Frontier</b> <b>Treaty,</b> divided Eastern Europe into Soviet and Nazi {{spheres of}} influence.

According to the Soviet-Lithuanian Mutual Assistance Pact of October 10, 1939, Soviet Union transferred Vilnius and surrounding territory to Lithuania {{in exchange for the}} stationing of 20,000 Soviet troops within the country. It was a virtual sacrifice of independence, as reflected in a known slogan [...] "Vilnius - mūsų, Lietuva - rusų" [...] (Vilnius is ours, but Lithuania is Russia's). Similar Mutual Assistance Pacts were signed with Latvia and Estonia. When Finland refused to sign its pact, Winter War broke out.|$|E
50|$|Lord Shelburne in London was {{determined}} to settle disputes along the western frontier {{in order to avoid}} more conflict with the Native Americans. Although he lost his office as Southern Secretary in October 1768, negotiations with tribal chiefs regarding the North American colonial <b>frontier</b> progressed. The <b>Treaty</b> of Fort Stanwix in November 1768 fixed the boundary lines to the north of Virginia. The border variances from the Treaty of Hard Labour led to negotiations where 1000 Cherokees were hosted by Alexander Cameron (d. 1781) at Lochabar Plantation in Ninety-Six District, South Carolina.|$|R

50|$|At {{the end of}} World War I, United States President Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points and {{the idea}} of {{national}} self-determination were met with opposition from European powers standing to lose influence or territory—this included Germany and its domination of Greater Poland. German politicians had signed an armistice leading to a ceasefire on 11 November 1918. Also, Germany had signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with the Bolshevik Russia to settle the territorial boundaries of the eastern <b>frontiers.</b> The Brest-Litovsk <b>treaty</b> did not take into consideration a future Polish state, therefore from the date that the armistice was signed until the Treaty of Versailles was fully ratified in January 1920, many of the territorial and sovereignty issues remained unresolved.|$|R
50|$|During medieval times, {{the city}} {{was part of the}} Kingdom of Poland from 1020 until 1319 when it was taken by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.

After World War I, the city returned to Second Polish Republic. During the Invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in 1939 {{the city was}} first captured by the Wehrmacht and soon passed on to the USSR in accordance with German-Soviet <b>Frontier</b> <b>Treaty.</b> In 1941 it was taken again by the Nazis during Operation Barbarossa.

A year and a half later, it was again recaptured by the Germans on the 28 June 1941 during the German attack on the Soviet positions in eastern Poland which marked the beginning of Operation Barbarossa. The Ukrainian People's Militia was formed. The town was incorporated into the General Government territory. The Judenrat was established in July 1941. In March 1942 the nearby Bełżec extermination camp began its killing operations, {{and at the end of}} the month the first Holocaust train with 1,000 Jews left Rawa Ruska for Bełżec.

It was signed by Joachim von Ribbentrop and Vyacheslav Molotov, the foreign ministers of Germany and the Soviet Union respectively, {{in the presence of}} Joseph Stalin. The treaty was a follow-up to the first secret protocol of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact signed on August 23, 1939 between the two countries prior to their invasion of Poland and the start of World War II in Europe. Only {{a small portion of the}} protocol which superseded the first treaty was publicly announced while the spheres of influence of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union remained classified. The third secret protocol of the Pact was signed on January 10, 1941 by Friedrich Werner von Schulenberg, and Molotov, whereas Germany renounced its claims to portions of Lithuania, only a few months before their anti-Soviet Operation Barbarossa.|$|E

500|$|Between 1803 and 1809, Harrison {{supervised}} eleven {{treaties with}} Indian leaders {{that provided the}} federal government with large tracts of land (more than [...] ) that included the southern third of present-day Indiana and most of present-day Illinois for further settlement. The Treaty of St. Louis (1804) with Quashquame required the Sauk and Meskwaki tribes to cede much of western Illinois and parts of Missouri to the federal government. Many of the Sauk, especially Black Hawk, greatly resented this treaty {{and the loss of}} lands, a primary reason the Sauk sided with the United Kingdom during the War of 1812. Harrison thought the Treaty of Grouseland (1805) appeased some of the Indians, but tensions remained high along the <b>frontier.</b> The <b>Treaty</b> of Fort Wayne (1809) raised new tensions when Harrison purchased land from the Miami tribe, who claimed ownership of the land, more than 2.5 million acres (10,000km²) of land inhabited by the Shawnee, Kickapoo, Wea, and Piankeshaw peoples. Harrison rushed the treaty process by offering large subsidies to the tribes and their leaders so that the treaty would be in force before President Jefferson left office and the administration changed.|$|R
5000|$|The Treaty of Badajoz (also {{known as}} the Peace of Badajoz) was signed in Badajoz on 6 June 1801 between the representatives of Prince Regent John of Portugal and representatives from the Kingdom of Spain.
