Little evidence exists {{that this is the}} optimal dose for bronchodilatation or that this dose is without side-effects. Twelve patients with asthma were given increasing doses of salbutamol 1. 5 mg, 3. 0 mg, 7. 5 mg, and placebo. Treatments were administered twice daily for four days in a double-blind manner. Measurements of ventilatory capacity, pulse rate, and tremor were recorded before and for three hours after treatment. There was a significant <b>dose-related</b> <b>response</b> for FEVI and peak flow rate. There was also a significant <b>dose-related</b> <b>response</b> in pulse rate and tremor. The incidence of palpitations was similarly related to dose. Plasma levels of salbutamol were measured before and after treatment with salbutamol and showed a dose related increase in salbutamol absorption which begins to be evident after the 3. 0 mg dose. Three milligrams of salbutamol nebuliser solution may be an optimal dose, producing satisfactory bronchodilatation but fewer side-effects related to systemic absorption...|$|E

40|$|Purpose {{of review}} : Transgender {{individuals}} experience unique health disparities {{but are the}} subject of little focused health research. This manuscript reviews current literature on transgender medical and mental health outcomes and proposes research priorities to address knowledge gaps. Recent findings : Published research in transgender healthcare consists primarily of case reports, retrospective and cross-sectional studies, involving largely European settings. Challenges to US-based transgender health research include a diverse population where no single center has sufficient patient base to conduct clinical research with statistical rigor. Treatment regimens are heterogeneous and warrant study for best practices. Current research suggests increased mortality and depression in transgender individuals not receiving optimal care, and possibly a modest increase in cardiovascular risk related to hormone therapy. Current evidence does not support concerns for hormone-related malignancy risk. The priorities for transgender medical outcomes research should be to determine health disparities and comorbid health conditions over the life span, along with the effects of mental health, medical, and surgical interventions on morbidity and mortality. Specific outcomes of interest based on frequency in the literature, potential severity of outcome, and patient-centered interest, include affective disorders, cardiovascular disease, malignancies, fertility, and time <b>dose-related</b> <b>responses</b> of specific interventions...|$|R

The experiments {{were performed to}} establish the direct actions of these two agents on the organization of cytoskeletal structures, on the acid phosphatase contents, and on the bone resorption activities of these cells. The results showed that by treating the cultures with retinol or retinoic acid, from 10 (- 8) to 10 (- 5) M, there were <b>dose-related</b> <b>responses</b> of the osteoclasts. Adhesion to the substratum was stimulated by {{increasing the number of}} cells exhibiting the specialized dot-like adhesion structures, or podosomes, which represent the active part of the sealing zone. The treatments also induced rearrangement of the microtubular patterns with reversible depolymerization of microtubules. Acid phosphatase activity was significantly higher both in vitamin A-treated osteoclasts and in their media. When [3 H]proline-labeled bone particles were added to the retinoid-treated osteoclasts, the release of [3 H]proline was increased significantly compared to controls. These results suggest that the two vitamin A metabolites cause several modifications of the metabolic status of isolated osteoclasts that result in augmented rates of bone resorption...|$|R

When adsorption on activated carbon powder was used, a certain reduction of mutagenic activity was observed. The use of activated carbon filters, however, removed the activity completely.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Passive dry-powder inhalers (DPIs) {{have been}} {{developed}} {{as an alternative to}} pressurised metered-dose inhalers (pMDIs) to improve aerosol delivery on inhalation and eliminate the need for propellants. However, new DPI formulations of generic drugs must be rigorously compared with conventional pMDI therapy. This randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, seven-way cross-over study evaluated bronchoprotection from methacholine challenge in order to compare a novel salbutamol DPI (Clickhaler 1) with a reference salbutamol pMDI (Ventolin 1). Adult asthma patients with airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine (provocative concentration of methacholine causing a 20 % fall in the forced expiratory volume in one second (PC 20) v 4 mg?mL- 1) were treated on separate days with 0, 100, 200 or 400 mg of salbutamol via the DPI or pMDI.

40|$|Background {{levels of}} {{chlorpyrifos}} and earthworm abundance were determined in an orchard and adjacent areas {{on a farm}} in the Western Cape, South Africa before these areas were again sprayed with this organophosphate. The background concentrations ranged from 0. 2 μg/kg dm in the spray drift area adjacent to the orchard to 10. 18 μg/kg dm on the slope in the run off area. In the target area the chlorpyrifos concentrations varied from a mean of 15. 25 ± 10. 0 μg/kg directly after spraying to a mean of 7. 0 ± 0. 9 μg/kg 6 months later and in the nontarget area they varied from a mean of 55. 0 ± 35 μg/kg to 12. 0 ± 5 μg/kg after 6 months. Chlorpyrifos was therefore still present in the field soils, but at lower concentrations, up to 6 months after the last spraying event. Earthworm abundance and population densities were very low. Only Aporrectodea caliginosa was found and the densities were much lower in the orchards (22 per m 2) than in the nontarget areas (98. 3 per m 2). Microcosm studies were undertaken to relate biomarker responses to chlorpyrifos with biomass changes. Microcosms were filled with soil from the same areas and earthworms of the species A. caliginosa were introduced. The microcosms were treated with a series of concentrations of chlorpyrifos in the laboratory under controlled conditions. These concentrations were chosen to fall within the background ranges found in the soils. The biomass of the worms was determined regularly for a period of 5 weeks and worms in a state of estivation were noted. Earthworms were removed from the microcosms for biomarker tests: for cholinesterase (ChE) inhibition assays every week and for a neutral red retention determination 2 weeks after the exposures started. The most prominent biomass loss was noted in earthworms exposed to the highest pesticide concentration of 8. 0 μg/kg. Estivation was higher among earthworms exposed to higher exposure concentrations. Inhibition of ChE increased with higher exposure concentrations and with time but there was no clear <b>dose-related</b> <b>response.</b> A clear <b>dose-related</b> <b>response</b> with exposure concentration was established for the neutral red retention assay.

40|$|Prostacyclin is a {{critical}} mediator of structure and function in the pulmonary circulation, causing both the inhibition of vascular smooth muscle growth and vasodilation via the stimulation of adenylate cyclase. To examine the potential role of alterations in prostacyclin production or mechanism of action in chronic hypoxic pulmonary hypertension, we determined the effects of prolonged (7 d) in vivo hypoxia on in vitro prostacyclin synthesis and mediation of adenylate cyclase activity in rat main pulmonary arteries. In control arteries prostacyclin production exceeded that of prostaglandin (PG) E 2 by 25 -fold, with 42 % originating from the endothelium. Studies utilizing indomethacin revealed that endogenous prostaglandins mediate at least 69 % of basal adenylate cyclase activity. Prostacyclin-stimulated enzyme activity was enhanced by exogenous GTP, indicating {{that this is a}} receptor-mediated process involving G protein amplification. Comparable <b>dose-related</b> <b>responses</b> to prostacyclin and PGE 2 suggest that these agents may activate a common receptor. After 7 d of in vivo hypoxia there was a 2. 7 -fold increase in in vitro prostacyclin production, with equivalent increases in synthesis in the endothelium and vascular smooth muscle. However, despite this increase there was no change in basal adenylate cyclase activity, and this was associated with attenuated sensitivity of the enzyme to prostacyclin stimulation. Concomitant diminution of the response to beta-adrenergic stimulation, with previously-demonstrated beta receptor downregulation and unaltered postreceptor-mediated activity, suggests that the blunted response to prostacyclin is due to receptor downregulation. Parallel studies of the thoracic aorta indicated that these changes are specific to the pulmonary artery. It is postulated that attenuation of the response of adenylate cyclase to prostacyclin may contribute to the structural changes and hypertension observed in the pulmonary vasculature of the rat with chronic hypoxia...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that the fry color of stored {{potatoes}} (Solanum tuberosum L.) can be negatively affected by an interaction between elevated CO 2 (2 kPa) and ethylene gas (0. 5 mLL– 1) from various sources. Two consecutive trials were conducted during each of two storage seasons (2006 and 2007) to study the effects of varying concentrations of these two gases. In each year, CO 2 at 0, 0. 5, 1. 0, or 2. 0 kPa plus 0, 0. 25, or 0. 5 mLL– 1 ethylene was applied in a factorial design to ‘Russet Burbank’ tubers for 9 weeks. Trials that began in Jan. 2006 and Jan. 2007 comprised the dormanttuber experiment; trials that began in Apr. 2006 and Apr. 2007 comprised the nondormant-tuber experiment. Fry color of the tubers was evaluated at the start of each trial and thereafter at intervals of 3 weeks. In all trials, when tubers were exposed to different concentrations of CO 2 but without ethylene, fry color was the same as in untreated controls. When only ethylene was applied, the fry color was 7 to 22 Agtron percent reflectance units darker than the controls. In the nondormant-tuber experiment, the darkening resulting from ethylene was dose-related, in agreement with previous research. When the tubers were exposed to both CO 2 and ethylene, <b>dose-related</b> <b>responses</b> to both gases were observed in the nondormant-tuber experiment, i. e., fry color was darker with an increase in either CO 2 or ethylene when both gases were present.

Demographic, socioeconomic, health needs and regular source of care data were analyzed concerning visits to a doctor within two months from the interview. Adjusted prevalence ratios and 95 % confidence intervals were calculated using Poisson regression. RESULTS: Adjusted PR showed that women having stressful life events, health insurance, and a regular doctor increased the outcome. A <b>dose-related</b> <b>response</b> was found with self-reported health, and the probability of visiting a doctor increased with health needs. Analysis in the chronic disease group revealed that uneducated lower income subjects had a 62 % reduction in the chance of visiting a doctor compared to uneducated higher income ones. However, as it was seen a significant interaction between income and education, years of schooling increased utilization in this group. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest the existence of health inequity in the poorest group that could be overcome with education. Specific measures reinforcing the importance of having a regular doctor may also improve access in the underserved group...|$|E
40|$|Lipocortin or annexin 1 is a calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding protein which {{probably}} {{acts as a}} glucocorticoid- regulated anti-inflammatory factor. cDNA for human lipocortin 1 was cloned in the pT 7. 7 expression plasmid {{under the control of}} the inducible bacteriophage T 7 RNA polymerase promoter. Upon induction with isopropyl thio-beta-D-galactoside, large amounts of the protein were produced and accumulated in Escherichia coli in a soluble form. The recombinant protein was purified to homogeneity by means of two subsequent ion-exchange chromatographic steps. The final yield was about 30 mg/l bacterial culture. Electrospray mass spectrometric analysis of the purified protein demonstrated that the recombinant product corresponds to the native human lipocortin 1, without the initial methionine and with a free N-terminal alanine; tryptic peptide mapping by fast-atom-bombardment mass spectrometry showed that the recombinant protein contains cysteine residues at positions 263 and 324 with free thiol groups, whereas Cys 270 and Cys 343 are probably involved in an intrachain disulfide bridge. Recombinant human lipocortin 1 reduces the carrageenin-induced paw oedema in rat in vivo and inhibits porcine pancreatic phospholipase A 2 activity in vitro; in both cases, a <b>dose-related</b> <b>response</b> is observed...|$|E
40|$|To {{compare their}} {{relative}} immunogenicities, we used synthetically produced Escherichia coli heat-stable toxin coupled to a protein carrier and the B subunit of porcine heat-labile toxin separately in graded dosages to immunize rats. Equivalent antigen unit dosages of each toxin raised {{approximately the same}} level of mucosal immunoglobulin A (IgA) antitoxin response and degree of protection against a challenge with respective heat-stable- or heat-labile-toxin-producing viable bacteria. Conjugation conditions were identified, therefore, which yielded a vaccine of these toxins, cross-linked by the carbodiimide reaction, that consisted of equal antigenic proportions of each toxin component as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and expressed in antigen units. The <b>dose-related</b> <b>response</b> to immunization with this vaccine was the same as the response to its components given separately. The toxicity of the heat-stable toxin component was reduced greater than 600 -fold. Immunization with optimal antigen unit dosages of the vaccine gave {{greater than or equal to}} sixfold increases in mucosal IgA antitoxin titers and provided significant (P less than 0. 001) protection against challenge with heterologous serotypes of viable strains, of either human or porcine origin, that produce heat-stable or heat-labile toxin or both...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{describe}} the cardiovascular effects of local acetylcholine (Ach) microinjection into both the ventrolateral (vlPAG) and dorsal (dPAG) periaqueductal gray areas of anesthetized rats and the possible local receptors involved with these responses. Microinjection of Ach (9, 27, 45 or 81 nmol/ 50 nL) into the vlPAG caused <b>dose-related</b> depressor <b>responses.</b> These hypotensive responses were blocked by local pretreatment with increasing doses of the nonselective muscarinic antagonist atropine (1, 3 or 9 nmol/ 50 nL). The microinjection of Ach into the dPAG caused no significant cardiovascular responses in anesthetized rats. In conclusion, the present findings suggest that a cholinergic system present in the vlPAG, {{but not in the}} dPAG, is involved with cardiovascular system control. Moreover, these cardiovascular responses evoked by Ach are mediated by muscarinic receptors. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{a plethora}} of in situ studies and {{clinical}} trials evaluating the efficacy of fluoridated dentifrices on caries control, in vitro pH cycling models are still broadly used because they mimic the dynamics of mineral loss and gain involved in caries formation. This paper critically reviews the current literature on existing pH-cycling models for the in vitro evaluation of the efficacy of fluoridated dentifrices for caries control, focusing on their strengths and limitations. A search was undertaken in the MEDLINE electronic journal database using the keywords "pH-cycling", "demineralization", "remineralization", "in vitro", "fluoride", "dentifrice". The primary outcome was the decrease of demineralization or the increase of remineralization as measured by different methods (e. g. : transverse microradiography) or tooth fluoride uptake. Inclusion of studies, data extraction and quality assessment were undertaken independently and in duplicate by {{two members of the}} review team. Disagreements were solved by discussion and consensus or by a third party. One hundred and sixteen studies were included, of which 42 addressed specifically the comparison of dentifrices using different pH-cycling models. The other studies included meta-analysis or reviews, data about the effect of different fluoride sources on de-remineralization, different methods for analysis de-remineralization and chemical variables and characteristics of dental hard tissues that might have influence on de-remineralization processes. Generally, the studies presented ability to detect known results established by clinical trials, to demonstrate <b>dose-related</b> <b>responses</b> in the fluoride content of the dentifrices, and to provide repeatability and reproducibility between tests. In order to accomplish these features satisfactorily, it is mandatory {{to take into account the}} type of substrate and baseline artificial lesion, as well as the adequate response variables and statistical approaches to be used. This critical review of literature showed that the currently available pH-cycling models are appropriate to detect dose-response and pH-response of fluoride dentifrices, and to evaluate the impact of new active principles on the effect of fluoridated dentifrices, as well as their association with other anti-caries treatments...|$|R
40|$|The {{selective}} alpha 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist, RX 781094, evoked a <b>dose-related</b> pressor <b>response</b> in the pithed rat preparation when {{administered in}} bolus doses by the intravenous route. This response was enhanced following depletion of endogenous amines by reserpine, and inhibited by the selective alpha 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin. Two other selective alpha 2 -adrenoceptor antagonists, Wy 26703 and Wy 26392, had no marked {{effect on the}} blood pressure of this preparation. Pretreatment of the preparation with Wy 26703 had no {{significant effect on the}} pressor response evoked by RX 781094. It is concluded that RX 781094 is an alpha 1 -adrenoceptor agonist at similar doses to those at which it exhibits alpha 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist properties. The agonist activity exhibited by RX 781094 is not a general property of all alpha 2 -adrenoceptor antagonists and should be considered when this compound is employed as an alpha 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist...|$|R
