40|$|This article {{advocates a}} {{comprehensive}} approach to the current crisis in the Euro Area - and, namely, the joint consideration {{of the economic and}} political issues at stake. The European integration - whose greatest development is, to present time, the Monetary Union - is a political project: a matter of will and action. Surely, this political project has a strong and specific economic component. Still, it is political. Therefore, political variables are critical. They must be included in any analysis of the financial and economic circumstances, and they must be considered in any strategy to overcome the current roadblock. The Euro Area has to cope, not only with excessive indebtedness, fiscal unbalances and financial markets, but also with the democratic restrictions to austerity and economic recession, and with the <b>democratic</b> <b>requirement</b> to respect social rights, to look for public support and to engage in political dialogue and compromise. In liberal democracies, as ours, the employment, social protection, citizenship and the right to believe and hope are full goals for the public policies, including the economic and fiscal ones...|$|E
40|$|Fiscal indiscipline is {{a feature}} of many {{developed}} countries. It is generally accepted {{that the source of}} the phenomenon lies in the common pool problem, the fact that recipients of public spending to fail to fully internalize the costs that taxpayers must assume. As a result, democratically elected governments are led to postpone tax collection, or to cut spending. Solving the fiscal discipline problem requires internalizing this externality. This calls for adequate institutions or for rules, or both. This paper reviews the various types of solutions that have been discussed in the literature and surveys a number of experiments. With the European debt crisis in mind, the paper pays particular attention to the common pool problem that emerges in federal states. The main conclusions are the following. First, rules are unlikely to exist unless they come with supporting institutions. Second, fiscal institutions are neither necessary nor sufficient to achieve fiscal discipline, but they help. Third, because institutions must bind the policymakers without violating the <b>democratic</b> <b>requirement</b> that elected officials have the power to decide on budgets, effective arrangements are those that give institutions the authority to apply legal rules or to act as official watchdogs. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{planning}} of reforms in government is of itself {{a complex and}} difficult process. This article examines reforms in the Government of South Africa from 1994 to 2005. Reforms {{in the public sector}} of South Africa must be understood from the confines of historical perspectives and political accommodation. An extensive review of the literature written by scholars of public administration and political transformation indicates clearly that adequate public sector reforms must be hinged on proper planning, efficient administration and political will. Considering the brief historical overview it is obvious that prior to 1994 the South African public sector and in particular the public service, consisting of some 1, 3 million employees, was characterised by fragmentation of structures, lack of co-ordinated policy frameworks, unequal allocation of financial and human resources as well as disregard for the <b>democratic</b> <b>requirement</b> of public accountability. It should be evident that the public service reform that the democratically elected government had to undertake was extensive as well as complex. The article will conclude by highlighting the fact that the legal and policy frameworks have been created to obtain an ethical workforce that operates in a public service that conforms to standards acceptable in an open and democratic society...|$|E
40|$|The commodification {{of higher}} {{education}} has been described, within the philosophical and sociological literature, in opposition to, or in alliance with principled perspectives about the nature, purpose or value of ‘higher education’: for example, as that which is intrinsically valuable, a social good, a <b>democratic</b> <b>requirement</b> or an individual entitlement. This thesis argues that such approaches are relatively unproductive in providing descriptions that can inform higher education practice. Rather, it is argued, they largely seem to operate to reproduce the principled perspectives {{with which they are}} aligned or opposed. The thesis examines the following question: How do official texts that describe higher education, operate to (re) produce and/or resist the idea of its commodification? The methodology employed to examine this question, locates ‘official’ texts as empirical objects for analysis. The analysis proceeds by identifying and organising oppositions and alliances within these texts, to produce a constructive description of how each text is operating within the higher education field. Specific descriptions {{of higher education}} within official texts are analysed in relation to constructed theoretical spaces that describe modes of discursive action, including the commodified mode. The method provides a means of describing commodification as a discursive modality rather than as a representation of use-value/exchange-value or market/non-market type oppositions. This approach is productive in describing the ways that official texts operate to regulate higher education practice without reproducing a principled perspective. Despite some explicit references to the economic or commodity value of higher education, official texts tend to use such descriptions to promote the introduction or maintenance of bureaucratic and regulatory systems that actually stand in opposition to the commodified mode. This conclusion is in contrast with the idea that official descriptions of higher education are operating to promote increasing commodification...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} that an international permit trading system may hurt relatively poor countries by making associated economic activities unaffordable. A model is constructed {{in which the}} free market solution is Pareto inefficient {{as a result of}} pollution. The introduction of tradable permits allows pollution to be internalised, and brings about an increase in the total social surplus. But when incomes vary, this may not lead to a Pareto improvement; those in poor countries stop the polluting activity because they cannot afford to do otherwise. Only those in relatively rich countries are made better off. This may explain why poor countries are reluctant to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, itself advocating a permit trading scheme. The politico-economic implications of permit trading are also examined. We show that the <b>democratic</b> <b>requirements</b> for ratification impose a lower bound on pollution reduction that can be achieved through a system of pollution permits with trade...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the conditions for}} legitimate expert arrangements within a democratic order and from a deliberative systems approach. It is argued that standard objections against the political role of experts are flawed or ill-conceived. The problem that confronts us instead is primarily one of truth-sensitive institutional design: Which mechanisms can contribute to ensuring that experts are really experts and that they use their competencies in the right way? The paper outlines a set of such mechanisms. However, the challenge exceeds that of producing epistemically optimal expert deliberations because a deliberative political system must also fulfil the ethical and <b>democratic</b> <b>requirements</b> of respect and inclusion. Yet, epistemic concerns justify expertise arrangements in the first place, and measures taken to make the use of expertise compatible with these requirements have to balance the potential rewards from expertise against potential deliberative costs. In the final part of the paper, the regulatory framework of a best practice expert advice system is tentatively analysed to illustrate the applicability and critical potential of our approach.

40|$|Changes in Western Democracies, e. g. {{the ongoing}} dealignment of citizens, the individualization of {{interest}} representation {{and the rise}} of the mass media as a key factor in the political process, rise new challenges for political communication. Consultants in public affairs are said to meet these challenges in both an effective and efficient way. They are external, commercial agents who assist their clients in the management of relationships with politically relevant stakeholders. Nevertheless, the rise of public affairs consultants also poses the question of their accordance with the principles of modern democracy. What are the consequences resulting from public affairs to democracy? What relevance does the public and direct democratic institutions (i. e. intiative and referendum campaigns) have in the framework of public affairs services? Does public affairs consulting promote or impede the equality of interest representation with respect to clients? I answer these questions on the basis of empirical data on public affairs consultancies in Switzerland. A representative survey was conducted in order to generate information on the structures of the field of public affairs consulting. I try to give answer to this general question by confronting empirical data on political consultancies in Switzerland with two basic <b>democratic</b> <b>requirements...</b>|$|R
40|$|Stimulating {{innovation}} and {{growth in the}} so-called ‘creative economy’ is a current policy objective for national regulators. One policy lever {{that can be applied}} to the creative sector is intellectual property. For example, regulators may alter the scope or term of protection offered by copyright law. Increased copyright protection limits the size of the public domain by restricting access to and use of cultural expressions. Opposition to expansion and further enclosure of the cultural public domain was previously articulated in terms of access to a commons of information. Following the Hargreaves Review of Intellectual Property in 2011, copyright reform in the UK context has been increasingly framed in terms of economic policy objectives. This paper reviews two economic approaches which shape how researchers and policymakers discuss the public domain in debates about IP reform: an economic welfare approach which weighs increases in producer and consumer surplus under different policy configurations and an economics of innovation approach which considers the value of the public domain as a reservoir of ideas for innovators and firms. I argue that economic definitions of the public domain should be augmented by a consideration of the <b>democratic</b> <b>requirements</b> of freedom of expression and access to information. The consequences of this re-figuration of the public domain for the public interest and access to information are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Control of land is {{a source}} of {{contention}} among indigenous peoples, governments, conservationists and extractive industries.  Forests are crucial to the existence and survival of tribal and pastoralist populations in India. The competition for control of land, coupled with a historical lack of rights of indigenous peoples, has resulted in land dispossession and impoverishment. To address this, the Indian Government passed the Forest Rights Act in 2006. Using empirical evidence from India, I critically examine, from a socio-legal perspective, the challenges of implementing the Forest Rights Act. The Act itself, while pushing the new ‘inclusion’ paradigm within conservation thinking, has been a shock to bureaucratic structures in India such as the Forest Department, which sees its role as fighting the ‘encroachment’ of tribal communities, and whose attitudes towards the community ranges from apathetic to openly hostile. In violation of human rights, state and central governments are ignoring participatory and <b>democratic</b> <b>requirements</b> of the Act, such as informed consent and the right to self-determination, while handing over huge tracts of forest lands to private entities. I also examine the failure of governance, reflected in the implementation of the Act, ranging from infringing on usufruct rights to illegal evictions. This begs {{the question of whether the}} new Act increases the vulnerability of mobile indigenous peoples rather than serving as a powerful tool for them to protect and manage their own forests and advocate for their rights. ...|$|R

40|$|Citizen {{participation}} {{is an essential}} part of the democratic process. All citizens, according to democratic principles, should have equal access to the decision making structures of government, and should have equal opportunity to participate in public decision making. The concept of citizen participation and the manner in which participatory mechanisms have been implemented are very different. Who participates and the profundity of their involvement appear inconsistent with <b>democratic</b> <b>requirements.</b> Historically, some group or groups of citizens have consistently been left out. Those citizens who are involved are usually not representative of the demographic make-up of the larger population, may not be representative spokespersons for the needs and desires of those citizens for whom policies and programs are being designed, and often have little impact on what is decided. Citizen impact on decision making appears to occur only when the citizens represent groups that are socially constructed positively and their ideas closely mirror those of bureaucrats involved in the process. The reasons for lack of participation generally, and lack of substantive participation specifically, have focused on citizens. Little if any attention has been focused on the role government administrators play in both defining participatory processes and bringing citizens into them. ^ This dissertation suggests that both the inclusion and exclusion of citizens from the policy making processes is a result of (1) requirements and attitudes generated by a bureaucratic structure, and (2) characterizations of population groups held by decision makers. These assumptions were tested in a study of a statewide planning and policy making project. A triad of data collection techniques was employed including a mail survey, a telephone survey and personal interviews. Models of social construction and bureaucracy were used to analyze the findings. ^ The findings demonstrate that lack of participation by groups such as minorities, the poor, those classified as dependent on government services, and those characterized negatively by bureaucrats may be purposely excluded from participatory mechanisms. They also show that target populations often do not make substantive contributions to the policies that affect them. The implications of these findings for both democratic theory and practice cannot be ignored. ...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of the Witwatersrand, Faculty of Humanities, School of Social Sciences, 2012 This thesis {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between social capital/civil society and good governance/economic development both conceptually and empirically through case studies in the urban, rural, and peri-urban South Africa. As a starting point, this thesis attempts {{to answer the following}} six questions: How is social capital identifiable? Is its production exclusively confined to horizontally structured forms of associational life? Can peasant societies generate social capital? Do social capital networks accentuate divisions within communities between those who have access to authority and those without? Can political institutions play a role in producing social capital or does the enlargement of state authority take place {{at the expense of the}} associational networks which do produce social capital? And what kind of organisations in rural settings can best bridge sectional concerns and promote wider communities of trust? Can traditional existing political institutions be adapted to modern <b>democratic</b> <b>requirements?</b> I believe that in answering these questions I have gone some way in resolving some of the conceptual dilemmas identified by critics of the concept of social capital. I was then in a position to test and explore two hypotheses. Firstly, I argue that there is a relationship between social capital (a product of civil society) and good governance as well as economic and democratic development. Secondly, I argue that positive social capital will be under-produced in societies in which there is a weak market economy, that is, where members of civil society do not have independent sources of income. I demonstrate that civil society, the state, and markets have a symbiotic relationship and that they all have a role to play in the production of positive social capital. This thesis employed various data collection methods in order to navigate around the case studies chosen for the purposes of this study, viz. individual and group interviews, focus groups, direct observations, research surveys, secondary literature, and local newspapers. Evidence emanating from this thesis suggests that there is a vibrant civil society and, by implication, social capital in poorly resourced areas found in urban, peri-urban, and rural areas of South Africa, which has to some extent contributed to good governance as well as economic and democratic development. However, I conclude by arguing that the informalisation of the economy as well as high levels of unemployment in these areas certainly inhibit civil society from playing its important democratising and governance role since the production of positive social capital is constrained by this new reality...|$|R
40|$|This study {{primarily}} {{investigates the}} conceptions of democracy held by young Swedes: What conceptions can be found? How are these conceptions similar to and {{different from each}} other? My main intention is to present nuanced pictures of different ways of viewing and of arguing for and against democracy. Some attention is also paid to possible differences between different youth groups, in terms of age, gender, and socioeconomic background. In addition, I will relate the investigation to research concerning school and the socialisation {{that is supposed to}} take place there. What concepts of democracy do Swedish schools seem to inculcate in students? Theoretical discussions of democracy serve as the framework of the study, and throughout the work democracy is regarded as an ambiguous concept. I have designed an analytical tool by depicting the discussions of democratic theory from three perspectives. The first concerns what democracy is and how the rule of the people should be designed. The second deals with the justifications for democracy, and why it is or is not to be preferred. The third perspective focuses on some crucial matters in discussions of democracy. The empirical material analyzed consists of ten focus group interviews with students in two age categories: 14 – 15 and 18 – 19 years old. The groups were composed so that the members would include both genders and a range of socio-economic backgrounds. The main idea of focus group interviews is to take advantage of group-interaction dynamics. Opinions are often formed in interaction with other people, and since consideration and reflection are central concerns of this thesis, focus group interviews are thus very suitable. The findings indicate that there is a dominant understanding of democracy. The young people interviewed emphasize that democracy means that everybody has a right to participate in decision making, that, for example, universal suffrage and freedom of speech are necessary features and that democracy in practice connotes an elite/electoral democracy (at the national level) with politicians as the real power holders. Although some features of Sweden’s existing democracy are widely criticized, democracy as a fundamental concept is celebrated. The main justification for this support is that democracy includes everybody. A view of everybody’s equal value is implicit. The critical matters highlighted concern human nature in relation to <b>democratic</b> <b>requirements,</b> how to handle extremist political movements, and the limited possibilities and unequal opportunities for people to participate in the existing democracy. Within this overall picture, somewhat different conceptions can also be detected. Two themes are particularly prominent in the discussions. Without overtly mentioning the word, the young people interviewed strongly emphasize the concept of equality. One line of discussion concerns the participants’ own experiences of being subordinate to adults, another the concept that equality presupposes equal opportunities to influence society. Democracy is also considered to be a human matter. Notably,when speaking of equality and freedom, the interviewees rarely mention these words directly. Mention of political institutions is also lacking from the discussions. Some of the findings can be regarded as reflecting the conceptions of democracy manifested in and passed on by schools. The study may also provide some guidance concerning how to approach social and political issues in the school...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{provides}} a {{critical analysis of}} the problems and possibilities for developing cosmopolitan ethics in global finance. With reference to Ideas and debates within the campaign for a Tobin Tax, {{it is argued that}} cosmopolitanism is a promising, but limited, agenda for global reform. Extending principles of justice to support the re-distribution of wealth from financial markets towards an expanded program of global welfare provision is laudable. Likewise, the possibility of improving accountability mechanisms and fostering democratic inclusion in the global financial system should be supported. However, the thesis identifies and reflects upon some important ethical ambiguities relating to financial, institutional and <b>democratic</b> universalism. A <b>requirement</b> for capital account convertibility, a cash-based approach to global justice and proposals for state-centric world authority to administer the Tobin Tax infers that the proposal would entrench many of the logics its supporters might oppose. The thesis develops a pragmatic approach to these questions based on the philosophical pragmatism of Richard Rorty. A pragmatic approach acknowledges the historical and cultural contingency of cosmopolitanism, but questions how the ambiguities and tensions that pervade global ethics can be engaged. In this sense, and developing Rorty's concept of sentimental education, it is argued that the Tobin Tax campaign has generated a broad-based public conversation about global finance, increasing sensitivity to the suffering caused by global finance {{and the ways in which}} it might be changed. While such conversation may not solve all the dilemmas identified, it does allow for increased awareness of the ambiguity of ethics. The thesis points to a number of instances in the campaign where the constitutive ambiguities of the Tobin Tax have been questioned and alternative practices suggested. A pragmatic approach to the Tobin Tax campaign therefore situates cosmopolitan ideas in the extant dilemmas and indeterminacies of global ethics, looking to suggest alternatives where possible.

40|$|Whether a {{voluntary}} environmental agreement succeeds is partly {{determined by the}} possibility of legally enforcing the obligations which it establishes. Despite the fact that the importance of enforcing voluntary agreements is underlined by the Dutch government, enforcement of these agreements is not always (clearly) guaranteed in practice, especially from a legal viewpoint. Apparently there is uncertainty concerning the possibility to enforce. This uncertainty is not only due to the enforcement mechanisms which are to be applied, but also to aspects that affect the enforceability of voluntary environmental agreements. Aspects of enforceability concern for example the parties, the legal character and the obligations which {{a voluntary}} agreement estbalishes. In addition to discussing the enforceability and enforcement of this instrument in a general sense, four specific voluntary agreements in the field of climate policy have been analysed in detail. These are the Long-Term Agreements on Energy-Efficiency 2001 - 2012, the Energy-Efficiency Benchmarking Agreement, the Agreement on Glasshouse Cultivation and the Environment and the Agreement on Coal-Fired Power Stations and CO 2 -reduction. These voluntary agreements are used in the Netherlands to implement the Kyoto Protocol. The enforceability and enforcement of voluntary agreements and of voluntary climate agreements in particular has been tested against the requirements of the Dutch democratic rule-of-law state. These requirements are: the principle of legal certainty, the equality principle, the requirement that the authorities are bound by the law, the protection of fundamental rights, the principle of democracy, judicial control and the principle of serving the government. In general, it may be concluded that the enforceability of voluntary environmental agreements under the law currently in force to a certain degree fulfils or is able to fulfil the requirements set for enforceability by the democratic rule of law principles. This general statement is supported by the analysis of the four voluntary climate agreements. It further generally emerges that the parties to a voluntary agreement are quite free to determine to what extent they will give substance to aspects of enforceability and that for this reason it is nog guaranteed that the <b>requirements</b> of the <b>democratic</b> rule of law will be respected. This also emerges from the analysis of the four voluntary climate agreements. If the parties fail to fulfil these requirements, they do not immediately act contrary to objective law. Also because of tensions between the application of <b>democratic</b> rule-of-law <b>requirements</b> it is not always possible to completely meet all the requirements set. If possible, a balance should be found in applying these requirements then. Overviewing the various possible paths to enforcement it can generally be concluded that in theory at least sufficient possibilities exist for both actual parties and third parties to enforce obligations from voluntary environmental agreements and that it is clear which enforcement mechanisms may be applied. The enforcement mechanisms cannot, however, just be applied simultaneously or consecutively; there are issues of harmonization between the different mechanisms. Furthermore, it is too a large extent dependent upon the parties to what degree the possibilities for enforcement method can and will be used...|$|R
