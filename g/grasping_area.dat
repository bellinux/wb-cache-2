40|$|We {{aimed at}} {{understanding}} the relative contribution of visual information and hand shaping to the neuronal activity of medial posterior parietal area V 6 A, a newly added {{area in the}} monkey cortical grasping circuit. Two Macaca fascicularis performed a Reach-to-Grasp task {{in the dark and}} in the light, grasping objects of different shapes. We found that V 6 A contains Visual cells, activated only during grasping in the light; Motor neurons, equally activated during grasping in the dark and in the light; Visuomotor cells, differently activated while grasping in the dark and in the light. Visual, Motor, and Visuomotor neurons were moderately or highly selective during grasping, whereas they reduced their selectivity during object observation without performing grasping. The use of the same experimental design employed in the dorsolateral <b>grasping</b> <b>area</b> AIP by other authors allowed us to compare the grasp-related properties of V 6 A and AIP. From these data and from the literature a frame emerges with many similarities between medial <b>grasping</b> <b>area</b> V 6 A and lateral <b>grasping</b> <b>area</b> AIP: both areas update and control prehension, with V 6 A less sensitive than AIP to fine visual details of the objects to be grasped, but more involved in coordinating reaching and grasping. status: accepte...|$|E

40|$|AbstractWhen {{the space}} robot captures a {{floating}} target, contact impact occurs inevitably and frequently between the manipulator {{hand and the}} target, which seriously impacts the position and attitude of the robot and grasping security. “Dynamic grasping area” is introduced to describe the collision process of manipulator grasping target, and <b>grasping</b> <b>area</b> control equation is established. By analyzing the impact of grasping control parameters, base and target mass on the grasping process and combining the life experience, {{it is found that}} if the product of speed control parameter and dB adjustment parameter is close to but smaller than the minimum grasping speed, collision impact in the grasping process could be reduced greatly, and then an ideal grasping strategy is proposed. Simulation results indicate that during the same period, the strategy grasping is superior to the accelerating grasping, in that the amplitude of impact force is reduced to 20 %, and the attitude control torque is reduced to 15 %, and the impact on the robot is eliminated significantly. The results would have important academic value and engineering significance...|$|E

40|$|Reaching to a {{location}} in space {{is supported by a}} cortical network that operates in a variety of reference frames. Computational models and recent fMRI evidence suggest that this diversity originates from neuronal populations dynamically shifting between reference frames as a function of task demands and sensory modality. In this human fMRI study, we extend this framework to nonmanipulative grasping movements, an action that depends on multiple properties of a target, not only its spatial location. By presenting targets visually or somaesthetically, and by manipulating gaze direction, we investigate how information about a target is encoded in gaze- and body-centered reference frames in dorsomedial and dorsolateral grasping-related circuits. Data were analyzed using a novel multivariate approach that combines classification and cross-classification measures to explicitly aggregate evidence in favor of and against the presence of gaze- and body-centered reference frames. We used this approach to determine whether reference frames are differentially recruited depending on the availability of sensory information, and where in the cortical networks there is common coding across modalities. Only in the left anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS) was coding of the grasping target modality dependent: predominantly gaze-centered for visual targets and body-centered for somaesthetic targets. Left superior parieto-occipital cortex consistently coded targets for grasping in a gaze-centered reference frame. Left anterior precuneus and premotor areas operated in a modality-independent, body-centered frame. These findings reveal how dorsolateral <b>grasping</b> <b>area</b> aIPS could {{play a role in the}} transition between modality-independent gaze-centered spatial maps and body-centered motor areas...|$|E
40|$|Prehension {{in an act}} of coordinated {{reaching}} and grasping. The reaching {{component is}} concerned with bringing the hand to object to be grasped (transport phase); the grasping component refers to the shaping of the hand according to the object features (grasping phase) (Jeannerod, 1981). Reaching and grasping involve different muscles, proximal and distal muscles respectively, and are controlled by different parietofrontal circuit (Jeannerod et al., 1995) : a medial circuit, involving area of superior parietal lobule and dorsal premotor area 6 (PMd) (dorsomedial visual stream), is mainly concerned with reaching; a lateral circuit, involving the inferior parietal lobule and ventral premotor area 6 (PMv) (dorsolateral visual stream), with <b>grasping.</b> <b>Area</b> V 6 A is located in the caudalmost part of the superior parietal lobule, so it belongs to the dorsomedial visual stream; it contains neurons sensitive to visual stimuli (Galletti et al. 1993, 1996, 1999) as well as cells sensitive to the direction of gaze (Galletti et al. 1995) and cells showing saccade-related activity (Nakamura et al. 1999; Kutz et al. 2003). Area V 6 A contains also arm-reaching neurons likely involved in the control of the direction of the arm during movements towards objects in the peripersonal space (Galletti et al. 1997; Fattori et al. 2001). The present results confirm this finding and demonstrate that during the reach-to-grasp the V 6 A neurons are also modulated by the orientation of the wrist. Experiments were approved by the Bioethical Committee of the University of Bologna and were performed in accordance with National laws on care and use of laboratory animals and with the European Communities Council Directive of 24 th November 1986 (86 / 609 /EEC), recently revised by the Council of Europe guidelines (Appendix A of Convention ETS 123). Experiments were performed in two awake Macaca fascicularis. Each monkey was trained to sit in a primate chair with the head restrained to perform reaching and grasping arm movements in complete darkness while gazing a small fixation point. The object to be grasped was a handle that could have different orientation. We recorded neural activity from 163 neurons of the anterior parietal sulcus; 116 / 163 (71...|$|E

40|$|The {{closure of}} the gastrotomy in Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES) is a {{prerequisite}} for transgastric endoscopic procedures in the abdominal cavity. Different techniques have been proposed and are under experimental or early clinical investigation. We describe the technique of using an over-the-scope-clip system (OTSC), made of super-elastic Nitinol and a specially designed tissue-approximating double jaw endoscopic grasper for gastric closure. The OTSC is a clipping system mounted {{at the tip of the}} endoscope and is used for the treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding or gastrointestinal organ perforations. An enlarged version of the OTSC is now under investigation for NOTES. The closure procedure consists of two steps. First the margins of the perforation are approximated by means of an endoscopic grasper that has two mobile and one fixed jaw, thus providing two independent tissue <b>grasping</b> <b>areas.</b> Each half of this twin grasper is used to grasp one side of the perforation wound margins. Then the margins are approximated and pulled towards the OTSC cap at the tip of the scope. Then the clip is released and the access hole is closed by compression. The OTSC clip can be applied for organ closure in NOTES in experimental studies. The technique allows closing the access site from inside the gastric cavity without leaving material on the peritoneal surface of the organ...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of object shape {{is critical for}} both object recognition and <b>grasping.</b> <b>Areas</b> in the intraparietal sulcus of the rhesus monkey are important for the visuomotor transformations underlying actions directed toward objects. The lateral intraparietal (LIP) area has strong anatomical connections with the anterior intraparietal area, which is known to control the shaping of the hand during grasping, and LIP neurons can respond selectively to simple two-dimensional shapes. Here we investigate the shape representation in area LIP of awake rhesus monkeys. Specifically, we determined to what extent LIP neurons are tuned to shape dimensions known to be relevant for grasping and assessed the invariance of their shape preferences with regard to changes in stimulus size and position in the receptive field. Most LIP neurons proved to be significantly tuned to multiple shape dimensions. The population of LIP neurons that were tested showed barely significant size invariance. Position invariance was present in {{a minority of the}} neurons tested. Many LIP neurons displayed spurious shape selectivity arising from accidental interactions between the stimulus and the receptive field. We observed pronounced differences in the receptive field profiles determined by presenting two different shapes. Almost all LIP neurons showed spatially selective saccadic activity, but the receptive field for saccades did not always correspond to the receptive field as determined using shapes. Our results demonstrate that a subpopulation of LIP neurons encodes stimulus shape. Furthermore, the shape representation in the dorsal visual stream appears to differ radically from the known representation of shape in the ventral visual stream. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} novel {{antiparticle}} detector. The gaseous antiparticle spectrometer (GAPS) effects particle identification through the characteristic X-rays emitted by antiparticles when they form exotic atoms in gases. GAPS obtains particularly high <b>grasp</b> (effective <b>area</b> [...] solid angle product) at lower particle energies, where conventional schemes are most {{limited in their}} utility. The concept is simple and lightweight, {{so it can be}} readily employed on balloon and space-based missions. An extremely powerful potential application of GAPS is a space-based search for the neutralino through the detection of a neutralino annihilation by-product [...] the antideuteron. Paradoxically, this space-based search for the neutralino is capable of achieving comparable sensitivity to as yet unrealized third generation, underground dark matter experiments. And GAPS can obtain this performance in a very modest satellite experiment. GAPS can also provide superior performance in searches for primary antiprotons produced via neutralino annihilation, black hole evaporation and in probing subdominant contributions to the antiproton flux at low energies. In a deep space mission GAPS will obtain higher sensitivity for a given weight and power than BGO calorimeters. Comment: 16 pages, AASTeX, 11 figures, accepted for publication in Ap...|$|R
40|$|Perception of {{relevant}} visual object features can be modulated by {{the preparation of}} an action toward it ("action-modulated perception"). For instance, {{the perception of the}} orientation of a book can be enhanced when preparing to grasp it (but not when pointing to it). However, the underlying neuronal mechanisms are poorly understood. We argue that brain areas controlling arm movements are involved in establishing this effect through top-down feedback to early visual areas, similar to the neuronal mechanisms linking visual attention and eye movements. To investigate this involvement, we applied transcranial magnetic stimulation to a <b>grasping</b> motor <b>area,</b> the left anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS), during grasping or pointing preparation. Concurrently, an orientation change detection task was performed. As a control area, the vertex was stimulated. We found that stimulation of aIPS selectively modulates orientation sensitivity during action preparation compared with control stimulation (vertex), negating the increased orientation sensitivity with grasping preparation over pointing preparation. We argue that aIPS is a critical part of the mechanism underlying perceptual modulations during action preparation. The present results and recent literature suggest that this action-modulated perception for hand movements is implemented through a cortical feedback connection between aIPS and early visual areas...|$|R
40|$|We {{traced the}} {{cortical}} connections of the anterior intraparietal (AIP) area, {{which is known}} to {{play a crucial role}} in visuomotor transformations for grasping. AIP displayed major connections with 1) areas of the inferior parietal lobule convexity, the rostral part of the lateral intraparietal area and the SII region; 2) ventral visual stream areas of the lower bank of the superior temporal sulcus and the middle temporal gyrus; and 3) the premotor area F 5 and prefrontal areas 46 and 12. Additional connections were observed with the caudal intraparietal area and the ventral part of the frontal eye field. This study suggests that visuomotor transformations for object-oriented actions, processed in AIP, rely not only on dorsal visual stream information related to the object’s physical properties but also on ventral visual stream information related to object identity. The identification of direct anatomical connections with the inferotemporal cortex suggests that AIP also has a unique role in linking the parietofrontal network of areas involved in sensorimotor transformations for <b>grasping</b> with <b>areas</b> involved in object recognition. Thus, AIP could represent a crucial node in a cortical circuit in which hand-related sensory and motor signals gain access to representations of object identity for tactile object recognition...|$|R

40|$|The {{posterior}} {{parietal cortex}} (PPC), historically {{believed to be}} a sensory structure, is now viewed as an area important for sensory-motor integration. Among its functions is the forming of intentions, that is, high-level cognitive plans for movement. There is a map of intentions within the PPC, with different subregions dedicated to the planning of eye movements, reaching movements, and <b>grasping</b> movements. These <b>areas</b> appear to be specialized for the multisensory integration and coordinate transformations required to convert sensory input to motor output. In several subregions of the PPC, these operations are facilitated by the use of a common distributed space representation that is independent of both sensory input and motor output.

Although some previous works have studied the force-displacement response of the fingertips, the responses in all {{other regions of the}} hand that usually participate in grasping have not been analysed to date. In this work we performed experimental measurements in 20 subjects to obtain a stiffness map of the different <b>grasping</b> contact <b>areas</b> of the human hand. A force-displacement apparatus was used to simultaneously measure force and displacement at 39 different points on the hand at six levels of force ranging from 1 N to 6 N. A non-linear force-displacement response was found for all points, with stiffness increasing with the amount of force applied. Mean stiffness for the different points and force levels was within the range from 0. 2 N/mm to 7. 7 N/mm. However, the stiffness range and variation with level of force were found to be different from point to point. A total of 13 regions with similar stiffness behaviours were identified. The stiffness in the fingertips increased linearly with the amount of force applied, while in the palm it remained more constant for the range of forces considered. It is hypothesised that the differences in the stiffness behaviour from one region to another allow these regions to play different roles during grasping. ...|$|R

Crowned in gold, the finial {{on top of the}} mace has the two dominant emblems of the institution: the seal of the State of Rhode Island and the seal of Bryant. The mace depicted here is the College mace, which was used between July 1964 and August 2004. It is the same mace as the new University mace, except for the front seal of the finial. When Bryant College became Bryant University effective August 25, 2004, the front seal of the finial was replaced by a new seal with a new Latin motto. The central symbol of the seal is an ellipsoid globe with quills on each side to signify the traditional emblem of communication in business. In the center, behind the globe, is a torch symbolizing liberty, the spirit of free inquiry, academic freedom, and learning. The Archway, forming the background for the globe, torch, and quills, is a Bryant landmark, which is affectionately remembered by thousands of alumni.

Daniel Lemeshka of The Gorham Company, Providence, RI, to Mrs. Gertrude Meth Hochberg, Director of Public Relations, Bryant College, 154 Hope Street, Providence, RI. 2 ̆ 2 The Bryant College crowned mace is an excellent example of this time-honored ceremonial symbol. 2 ̆ 2 Originally, the mace, as the most ancient weapon known to man, symbolized only the power of physical strength. From its earliest form as the trunk of a young tree on which is left the root head, through the additions of metal and spiked heads, its authority lay in its appearance as a club for striking. 2 ̆ 2 During {{the latter part of the}} 16 th Century appeared the first reference to the crowned mace, an adaptation to symbolize the power of authority as well as strength.. 2 ̆ 2 The crown on the Bryant College mace combines the two emblems most dominant at the school – the Bryant College seal sharply etched on one side and the seal of the State of Rhode Island on the obverse. 2 ̆ 2 This decorative crown is visually attached to the shaft of the mace by means of a circle of stylized acanthus leaves which joins these symbols of authority to the frieze ornament representing the lamps of learning to the arch symbol that portrays the scholastic halls of Bryant, (And the arch, I understand, relates to your famous archway on campus.) 2 ̆ 2 The golden hues of these elements are picked up again in the center shaft section which is circled with the typical heraldic symbol of geometric diamond shapes.

It ranges from 0. 08 to 0. 16 depending on the year. The monthly runoff ratio indicated little value in March, April and May which is beginning of rainy season and high value in November and December which is beginning of dry season. 3) The gentle slope area with less than 2 %, which seems suitable area for lowland rice, occupies 22 % of inland valley...|$|R
40|$|The {{visual system}} cannot rely only upon {{information}} from the retina to perceive object motion because identical retinal stimulations can be evoked by the movement of objects {{in the field of}} view {{as well as by the}} movements of retinal images self-evoked by eye movements. We clearly distinguish the two situations, perceiving object motion in the first case and stationarity in the second. The present work deals with the neuronal mechanisms that are likely involved in the detection of real motion. In monkeys, cells that are able to distinguish real from self-induced motion (real-motion cells) are distributed in several cortical areas of the dorsal visual stream. We suggest that the activity of these cells is responsible for motion perception, and hypothesize that these cells are the elements of a cortical network representing an internal map of a stable visual world. Supporting this view are the facts that: (i) the same cortical regions in humans are activated in brain imaging studies during perception of object motion; and (ii) lesions of these same regions produce selective impairments in motion detection, so that patients interpret any retinal image motion as object motion, even when they result from her/his eye movements. Among the areas of the dorsal visual stream rich in real-motion cells, V 3 A and V 6, likely involved in the fast form and motion analyses needed for visual guidance of action, could use real-motion signals to orient the animal’s attention towards moving objects, and/or to help <b>grasping</b> them. <b>Areas</b> MT/V 5, MST and 7 a, known to be involved in the control of pursuit eye movements and in the analysis of visual signals evoked by slow ocular movements, could use real-motion signals to give a proper evaluation of motion during pursuits...|$|R
40|$|Using {{single cell}} {{recordings}} in non-human primates {{we tried to}} obtain a better insight in the neurophysiology of visuomotor processing {{for the purpose of}} grasping. Since binocular disparity is the main depth cue for the control of our grasp, the neural representation of disparity-defined curved surfaces can be important for the intricate visuomotor transformations necessary for visually-guided grasping. We studied therepresentation of 3 D shape in posterior parietal area AIP and ventral premotor area F 5 a, two brain areas known to be critically involved in <b>grasping.</b> In <b>area</b> AIP, an end-stage area of the dorsal visual stream, neurons mainly process 3 D object boundary information with a strong emphasis on the axis of curvature. These neurons have a fast and coarse representation of depth information and are insensitive to anticorrelated disparities. Recording sites in area AIP, involved in 3 D shape processing, were also responsive during visually guided grasping. These findings are consistent with the view that the dorsal stream is selectively important for using visual information to guide actions. In area F 5 a, neurons showed similar robust 3 D-shape selectivity in the absence of amotor response. The neuronal 3 D shape coding was very similar to area AIP with a rather coarse and monotonous coding. This metric coding is probably important for the fine control of hand movements towards objects. Disparity selective F 5 a neurons frequently exhibited responses during grasping of real-world objects. 3 D-shape selective single units responsive during grasping were generally visual and nearby neurons often showed motor-related activity in the dark. Such neurons were onlyfound in a specific anatomical subsector of F 5, not in surrounding periarcuate areas. This peculiar area is therefore distinct from neighboring regions of the ventral premotor cortex, in line with anatomical connectivity studies. This three-dimensional shape selectivity in the parietofrontal grasping circuit suggests a pivotal role in the intricate process of visuomotor transformations for grasping. The rapid and accurate 3 D-shape processing can hereby guide the preshaping of the hand according to particular 3 D object properties. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that neurophysiological activation during action planning depends on the orientation to initial or final action goals for precision grips. However, the neural signature for a distinct class of grasping, power grips, is still unknown. The aim {{of the present study was}} to differentiate between cerebral activity, by means of event-related potentials (ERPs), and its temporal organization during power grips executed with an emphasis on either the initial or final parts of movement sequences. In a grasp and transportation task, visual cues emphasized either the grip (the immediate goal) or the target location (the final goal). ERPs differed between immediate and final goal-cued conditions, suggesting different means of operation dependent on goal-relatedness. Differences in mean amplitude occurred earlier for power grips than for recently reported precision grips time-locked to <b>grasping</b> over parieto-occipital <b>areas.</b> Time-locked to final object placement, differences occurred within a similar time window for power and precision grips over frontal areas. These results suggest that a parieto-frontal network of activation is of crucial importance for grasp planning and execution. Our results indicate that power grip preparation and execution for goal-related actions are controlled by similar neural mechanisms as have been observed during precision grips, but with a distinct temporal pattern...|$|R
