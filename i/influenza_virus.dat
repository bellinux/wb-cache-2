5|$|Viruses {{reproduce}} rapidly {{because they}} {{have only a few}} genes compared to humans who have 20,000–25,000.

Because the two genes that determine G-types and P-types can be passed on separately to progeny viruses, different combinations are found.|$|E
5|$|Envelope: Some {{species of}} virus envelop {{themselves}} in a modified form {{of one of the}} cell membranes, either the outer membrane surrounding an infected host cell or internal membranes such as nuclear membrane or endoplasmic reticulum, thus gaining an outer lipid bilayer known as a viral envelope.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Pandemics of 1957 and 1968 were {{believed}} to arise from avian <b>influenza</b> <b>viruses.</b> 1 The tropism of avian and human seasonal <b>influenza</b> <b>viruses</b> for the human lower respiratory tract deserves investigation.

5|$|Enzymes serve a {{wide variety}} of {{functions}} inside living organisms. They are indispensable for signal transduction and cell regulation, often via kinases and phosphatases. They also generate movement, with myosin hydrolyzing ATP to generate muscle contraction, and also transport cargo around the cell as part of the cytoskeleton. Other ATPases in the cell membrane are ion pumps involved in active transport. Enzymes are also involved in more exotic functions, such as luciferase generating light in fireflies. Viruses can also contain enzymes for infecting cells, such as the HIV integrase and reverse transcriptase, or for viral release from cells, like the <b>influenza</b> <b>virus</b> neuraminidase.|$|E
5|$|In 1957 {{another new}} {{strain of the}} virus emerged and caused a {{pandemic}} of Asian flu; although the virus was not as virulent as the 1918 strain, over one million died worldwide. The next pandemic occurred when Hong Kong flu emerged in 1968, a new strain of the virus that replaced the 1957 strain. Affecting mainly the elderly, the 1968 pandemic was the least severe, but 33,800 {{were killed in the}} US. New strains of <b>influenza</b> <b>virus</b> often originate in East Asia; in rural China the concentration of ducks, pigs, and humans in close proximity is the highest in the world.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{diagnostics}} {{are used}} to identify infectious diseases such as chlamydia, <b>influenza</b> <b>virus</b> and tuberculosis; or specific strains such as H1N1 virus. Genetic identification can be swift; for example a loop-mediated isothermal amplification test diagnoses the malaria parasite and is rugged enough for developing countries. But despite these advances in genome analysis, in 2013 infections are still more often identified by other meanstheir proteome, bacteriophage, or chromatographic profile. Molecular diagnostics are also used to understand the specific strain of the pathogenfor example by detecting which drug resistance genes it possessesand hence which therapies to avoid.|$|E
40|$|While <b>influenza</b> A <b>viruses</b> {{comprise}} a heterogeneous group of clinically relevant <b>influenza</b> <b>viruses,</b> <b>influenza</b> B <b>viruses</b> form a more homogeneous cluster, divided mainly into two lineages: Victoria and Yamagata. This divergence has complicated seasonal influenza vaccine design, which traditionally contained two seasonal <b>influenza</b> A <b>virus</b> strains and one <b>influenza</b> B <b>virus</b> strain. We examined {{the distribution of}} the two <b>influenza</b> B <b>virus</b> lineages in Israel, between 2011 - 2014, in hospitalized and in non-hospitalized (community) influenza B virus-infected patients. We showed that <b>influenza</b> B <b>virus</b> infections can lead to hospitalization and demonstrated that during some winter seasons, both <b>influenza</b> B <b>virus</b> lineages circulated simultaneously in Israel. We further show that the <b>influenza</b> B <b>virus</b> Yamagata lineage was dominant, circulating in the county {{in the last few years}} of the study period, consistent with the anti-Yamagata <b>influenza</b> B <b>virus</b> antibodies detected in the serum samples of affected individuals residing in Israel in the year 2014.

40|$|<b>Influenza</b> <b>viruses</b> of gallinaceous {{poultry and}} wild aquatic birds usually have {{distinguishable}} receptor-binding properties. Here {{we used a}} panel of synthetic sialylglycopolymers and solid-phase receptor-binding assays to characterize receptor-binding profiles of about 70 H 7 <b>influenza</b> <b>viruses</b> isolated from aquatic birds, land-based poultry, and horses in Eurasia and America. Unlike typical duck <b>influenza</b> <b>viruses</b> with non-H 7 hemagglutinin (HA), all avian H 7 <b>influenza</b> <b>viruses,</b> irrespective of the host species, displayed a poultry-virus-like binding specificity, i. e., preferential binding to sulfated oligosaccharides Neu 5 Acα 2 - 3 Galβ 1 - 4 (6 -O-HSO 3) GlcNAc and Neu 5 Acα 2 - 3 Galβ 1 - 4 (Fucα 1 - 3) (6 -O-HSO 3) GlcNAc. This phenotype correlated with the unique amino acid sequence of the amino acid 185 to 189 loop of H 7 HA {{and seemed to be}} dependent on ionic interactions between the sulfate group of the receptor and Lys 193 and on the lack of sterical clashes between the fucose residue and Gln 222. Many North American and Eurasian H 7 <b>influenza</b> <b>viruses</b> displayed weak but detectable binding to the human-type receptor moiety Neu 5 Acα 2 - 6 Galβ 1 - 4 GlcNAc, highlighting the potential of H 7 <b>influenza</b> <b>viruses</b> for avian-to-human transmission. Equine H 7 <b>influenza</b> <b>viruses</b> differed from other viruses by preferential binding to the N-glycolyl form of sialic acid. Our data suggest that the receptor-binding site of contemporary H 7 <b>influenza</b> <b>viruses</b> in aquatic and terrestrial birds was formed after the introduction of their common precursor from ducks to a new host, presumably, gallinaceous poultry. The uniformity of the receptor-binding profile of H 7 <b>influenza</b> <b>viruses</b> in various wild and domestic birds indicates that there is no strong receptor-mediated host range restriction in birds on viruses with this HA subtype. This notion agrees with repeated interspecies transmission of H 7 <b>influenza</b> <b>viruses</b> from aquatic birds to poultry...|$|R

5|$|The 2007 Bernard Matthews H5N1 {{outbreak}} was an {{occurrence of}} avian influenza in England {{caused by the}} H5N1 subtype of <b>Influenza</b> <b>virus</b> A that began on 30 January 2007.

5|$|The {{origin of}} the Spanish flu pandemic, and the {{relationship}} between the near-simultaneous outbreaks in humans and swine, have been controversial. One hypothesis is that the virus strain originated at Fort Riley, Kansas, in viruses in poultry and swine which the fort bred for food; the soldiers were then sent from Fort Riley around the world, where they spread the disease. Similarities between a reconstruction of the virus and avian viruses, combined with the human pandemic preceding the first reports of influenza in swine, led researchers to conclude the <b>influenza</b> <b>virus</b> jumped directly from birds to humans, and swine caught the disease from humans.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSwine <b>influenza</b> <b>viruses</b> (SIV) {{have been}} {{recognized}} as important pathogens for pigs and occasional human infections with swine origin <b>influenza</b> <b>viruses</b> (SOIV) have been reported. Between 1990 and 2010, a total of twenty seven human cases of SOIV infections {{have been identified in}} the United States. Six viruses isolated from 1990 to 1995 were recognized as classical SOIV (cSOIV) A(H 1 N 1). After 1998, twenty-one SOIV recovered from human cases were characterized as triple reassortant (tr_SOIV) inheriting genes from classical swine, avian and human <b>influenza</b> <b>viruses.</b> Of those twenty-one tr_SOIV, thirteen were of A(H 1 N 1), one of A(H 1 N 2), and seven of A(H 3 N 2) subtype.

5|$|In adults, viruses {{account for}} {{approximately}} {{a third and}} in children for about 15% of pneumonia cases. Commonly implicated agents include rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, <b>influenza</b> <b>virus,</b> respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, and parainfluenza. Herpes simplex virus rarely causes pneumonia, except in groups such as: newborns, persons with cancer, transplant recipients, and people with significant burns. People following organ transplantation or those otherwise-immunocompromised present high rates of cytomegalovirus pneumonia. Those with viral infections may be secondarily infected with the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, or Haemophilus influenzae, particularly when other health problems are present. Different viruses predominate at different periods of the year; during influenza season, for example, influenza may account for over half of all viral cases. Outbreaks of other viruses also occasionally occur, including hantaviruses and coronavirus.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} ways in which viruses spread from host to host but each species of virus uses only one or two. Many viruses that infect plants are carried by organisms; such organisms are called vectors. Some viruses that infect animals, {{including}} humans, are also spread by vectors, usually blood-sucking insects. However, direct transmission is more common. Some virus infections, such as norovirus and rotavirus, are spread by contaminated food and water, hands and communal objects and by intimate contact with another infected person, while others are airborne (<b>influenza</b> <b>virus).</b> Viruses such as HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C are often transmitted by unprotected sex or contaminated hypodermic needles. It is important to know how each different kind of virus is spread to prevent infections and epidemics.|$|E
5|$|Some {{cases may}} be {{triggered}} by the <b>influenza</b> <b>virus</b> and potentially influenza vaccine. An increased incidence of Guillain–Barré syndrome followed influenza immunization that followed the 1976 swine flu outbreak (H1N1A/NJ/76); 8.8 cases per million recipients developed the complication. Since then, close monitoring of cases attributable to vaccination has demonstrated that influenza itself can induce GBS. Small increases in incidence have been observed in subsequent vaccination campaigns, {{but not to the}} same extent. The 2009 flu pandemic vaccine (against pandemic swine flu virus H1N1/PDM09) did not cause a significant increase in cases. It is considered that the benefits of vaccination in preventing influenza outweigh the small risks of GBS after vaccination. Even those who have previously experienced Guillain–Barré syndrome are considered safe to receive the vaccine in the future. Other vaccines, such as those against poliomyelitis, tetanus or measles, have not been associated with a risk of GBS.|$|E
40|$|Seropositivity to avian {{influenza}} (AI) via low-level antibody titers {{has been reported}} in the general population and poultry-exposed individuals, raising the question whether these findings reflect true infection with AI or cross-reactivity. Here we investigated serological profiles against human and avian <b>influenza</b> <b>viruses</b> in the general population using a protein microarray platform. We hypothesized that higher antibody diversity across recent H 1 and H 3 <b>influenza</b> <b>viruses</b> would be associated with heterosubtypic reactivity to older pandemic- and AI viruses. We found significant heterogeneity in antibody profiles. Increased antibody diversity to seasonal <b>influenza</b> <b>viruses</b> was associated with low-level heterosubtypic antibodies to H 9 and H 7, but not to H 5 AI virus. Individuals exposed to the recent 2009 A(H 1 N 1) pandemic showed higher heterosubtypic reactivity.

40|$|<b>Influenza</b> A <b>viruses</b> are {{zoonotic}} agents, {{capable of}} cross-ing the species barriers. Nowadays, they still constitute {{a great challenge}} worldwide. The natural reservoir of all <b>influenza</b> A <b>viruses</b> are wild aquatic birds, despite the fact they have been isolated {{from a number of}} avi-an and mammalian species, including humans. Even when <b>influenza</b> A <b>viruses</b> are able to get into another than waterfowl population, they are often unable to ef-ficiently adapt and transmit between individuals. Only in rare cases, these viruses are capable of establishing a new lineage. To succeed a complete adaptation and further transmission between species, <b>influenza</b> A <b>virus</b> must overcome a species barrier, including adaptation to the receptors of a new host, which would allow the virus–cell binding, virus replication and, then, animal-to-animal transmission. For many years, pigs were thought to be intermediate host for adaptation of avian <b>influenza</b> <b>viruses</b> to humans, because of their susceptibility to in-fection with both, avian and human <b>influenza</b> <b>viruses,</b> which supported hypothesis of pigs as a “mixing vessel”.

5|$|The {{ability of}} viruses to cause devastating {{epidemics}} in human societies {{has led to}} the concern that viruses could be weaponised for biological warfare. Further concern was raised by the successful recreation of the infamous 1918 <b>influenza</b> <b>virus</b> in a laboratory. Smallpox virus devastated numerous societies throughout history before its eradication. There are only two centres in the world that are authorised by the WHO to keep stocks of smallpox virus: the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR in Russia and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States. Fears that it may be used as a weapon may not be totally unfounded. As the vaccine for smallpox sometimes had severe side-effects, it is no longer used routinely in any country. Thus, much of the modern human population has almost no established resistance to smallpox, and would be vulnerable to the virus.|$|E
