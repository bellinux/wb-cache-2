25|$|This {{has some}} {{interesting}} implications. <b>For</b> <b>starters,</b> Everett {{suggested that the}} universe is actually indeterminate as a whole. To see this, consider an observer measuring the spin of some particle, which previously is in an undetermined state (a superposition of possible spins). When you measure the spin, you may determine it to be up or down. But in fact, there has been a “splitting” of the universe into two states, one where you measure up, and the other where you measure down. Thus, the indeterminacy of the system simply grows and you become a part of it.|$|E

500|$|Generally speaking, rats {{are quite}} sociable and {{function}} best {{with at least}} one cage mate. It is generally ill-advised to keep a singular rat unless there are severe behavioral problems, such as those that can be seen in some older males. The earlier rats are introduced to one another, the better and oftentimes, rat breeders will encourage new owners to take two or more rats of the same gender from the same litter <b>for</b> <b>starters.</b> [...] Particularly with males, there can be some fighting in the beginning, but once an alpha rat has been determined, the rats should get along well. Within two weeks to a month, the rats will most likely have adjusted and become friendlier with each other. Rats are generally very friendly to other cage mates, particularly with females. They will even sometimes help or take care of other sick rats.|$|E

2500|$|By 1995 [...] "nuevo rock argentino" [...] or Argentine new rock {{had lost}} steam. <b>For</b> <b>starters,</b> bands like Los Siete Delfines and Peligrosos Gorriones, with their more artistic antics, {{fell out of}} favor. At the same time, groups like Massacre and La Portuaria went on {{recording}} hiatuses and would not return until more favorable winds {{in the early to}} mid-2000s. Los Brujos disbanded in 1998 after eight years of solid productions, but it left a large void in the movement. One of the last hurrahs of new rock were rap-rockers Actitud Maria Marta, which had a year of fame in 1995. Babasónicos, Todos Tus Muertos, and Illya Kuryaki and the Valderramas were some of the new rock bands that were able to maintain their level as the year 2000 approached.|$|E

Stability and growth, <b>for</b> <b>starters.</b> After {{the chaos of the}} 90s, {{highlighted}} by Yeltsin's attack on the Russian parliament with tanks in 1993 and the collapse of almost every bank in 1998, Putin has delivered political calm and a 7% annual rate of growth. Inequalities have increased and many of the new rich are grotesquely crass and cruel, but not all the Kremlin's vast revenues from oil and gas have gone into private pockets or are being hoarded in the government's [...] "stabilisation fund". Enough has gone into modernising schools and hospitals so that people notice a difference. Overall living standards are up. The second Chechen war, the major blight on Putin's record, is almost over." ...|$|E
