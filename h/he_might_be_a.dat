5|$|The {{first known}} {{member of the}} family, Constantine Gabras, participated in the 976–979 revolt of Bardas Skleros, and was killed in battle in 979. A patrikios Gabras appears in 1018, who was blinded for {{plotting}} along with the Bulgarian Elemag to restore the recently subdued Bulgarian Empire; it is unclear, however, what his relation with the Chaldian Gabrades is, or whether <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> Bulgarian noble. In 1040, a Michael Gabras {{was one of the}} leaders of a failed aristocratic conspiracy against the Domestic of the Schools Constantine, a brother of Emperor Michael IV (r. 1034–1041). He too was blinded along with his fellow conspirators.|$|E

25|$|Jack Childs {{dropped out}} of the Communist Party in 1947 and spent his time and money taking care of his {{physically}} ailing brother as best he was able. His sudden lack of party activity generated a routine September exploratory visit by two Special Agents of the FBI in an effort to gauge his level of disaffection and to see whether <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> willing source of information about the top levels of the Communist Party.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{after the}} war, Léopold III, who had {{surrendered}} {{himself to the}} German army in 1940, was released; however, {{the issue of whether}} he had betrayed his country by surrendering, while most government ministers had escaped to the United Kingdom, presented an important constitutional dilemma. In particular, the Belgian public was concerned that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> collaborator with the Nazis. He had met Hitler in Berchtesgaden on November 19, 1940 and had even remarried (to Lilian Baels) during the war. Many Belgians, especially the Socialists, strongly opposed his return to power. He was kept in exile in Switzerland until 1950, while his brother Prince Charles presided as regent.|$|E
25|$|Zimbabwe got a {{good start}} by dismissing both Marshall twins, James and Hamish, in {{successive}} overs. Hamish's dismissal concluded the day, but Zimbabwe would be hopeful before the second day started. That hope quickly turned to despair. Twenty-eight overs were bowled before lunch, but Zimbabwe failed to take a single wicket, and New Zealand moved into a comfortable position at 180 for 2. New Zealand could push on the accelerator, Nathan Astle getting 128 and Lou Vincent 92, as New Zealand amassed 406 runs on the second day. Graeme Cremer, the leg spinner, bowled 24 overs for 111 runs, to illustrate the Zimbabweans' predicament. Test debutant Keith Dabengwa got two for 87, however, suggesting that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> better choice than Cremer for the spinner place in the Zimbabwean team.|$|E

25|$|Lyon brought Gloucestershire greater {{success than}} the county had {{seen since the}} days of W. G. Grace. In 1929 and 1930, they won more matches than any other county; in 1930 and 1931 they {{finished}} second. Lyon was aided, no doubt, by having Wally Hammond, perhaps England's finest batsman of the time in the side. And the three years of success coincided as well with the last truly effective years of the great slow left-arm bowler Charlie Parker and the first effective years of Parker's successor, the off break bowler Tom Goddard. But the captaincy of Lyon was regarded as a vital factor, and he was chosen as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1931. The citation in Wisden suggested that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> future captain of England, but that did not happen.|$|E
25|$|To {{prove the}} antiquity and {{authenticity}} of their claims, the Beta Israel cite the 9th-century CE testimony of Eldad ha-Dani (the Danite), {{from a time}} before the Zagwean dynasty was established. Eldad was a Jewish man of dark skin who appeared in Egypt and created a stir in that Jewish community (and elsewhere in the Mediterranean Jewish communities he visited) with claims {{that he had come}} from a Jewish kingdom of pastoralists far to the south. The only language Eldad spoke was a hitherto unknown dialect of Hebrew. Although he strictly followed the Mosaic commandments, his observance differed in some details from Rabbinic halakhah. Some observers thought that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> Karaite, although his practice also differed from theirs. He carried Hebrew books that supported his explanations of halakhah. He cited ancient authorities in the scholarly traditions of his own people.|$|E
25|$|Johnston first played club cricket in Ireland in 1995 and {{returned}} for four more seasons, meeting his wife Vanessa, {{with whom he}} now has two children. He continued playing Sydney Grade Cricket for North Sydney Cricket Club, but qualified for an Irish passport and then-coach Adrian Birrell decided <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> useful addition to the Irish side. He made his debut for Ireland on 5 May 2004 against Surrey in a C & G Trophy match that Ireland won, only their second win against a first-class county. He also played in the next match of the competition against Northamptonshire. Johnston's next appearances for Ireland were two matches against the West Indies in June, the second of which Ireland won. He then played against the MCC later that month, before making his first-class debut for Ireland against the Netherlands in the Intercontinental Cup. This {{was followed by the}} 2004 European Championship and a first-class match against Scotland. The main action for Ireland in 2005 was the 2005 ICC Trophy, hosted in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Johnston was in the Irish squad and they reached the final, losing to Scotland, but still qualifying for the 2007 World Cup.|$|E

25|$|A by-effect of Stanton's {{performance}} in Pennsylvania v. Wheeling and Belmont {{was that he}} was sought after for other prominent cases, such as the case of inventor Cyrus McCormick. In 1831, a young McCormick created a machine to harvest crops. The device was particularly useful in the burgeoning wheat fields of the Western United States. Demand for McCormick's invention grew rapidly, attracting fierce competition, especially from fellow inventor and businessman John Henry Manny. In 1854 McCormick and his two prominent lawyers, Reverdy Johnson and Edward M. Dickinson, filed suit against Manny claiming he had infringed on McCormick's patents. McCormick demanded an injunction on Manny's reaper. Manny was also defended by two esteemed lawyers, George Harding and Peter H. Watson. McCormick v. Manny was initially to be tried in Chicago, and the two lawyers wanted another attorney local to the city to join their team; the recommended choice was Abraham Lincoln. When Watson met Lincoln in Springfield, Illinois, he had a dim first impression of him, but after speaking with Lincoln, Watson saw that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> good choice. However, when the venue of the proceedings was transferred to Cincinnati rather than Chicago, and the necessity for Lincoln was negated, Harding and Watson went for their first choice, Edwin Stanton. Lincoln was not made aware that he had been replaced, and still appeared at the proceedings in Cincinnati with his arguments prepared. Stanton's apprehension towards Lincoln was immediate and severe, and he did well to indicate to Lincoln that he wanted him to absent himself from the case. The case proceeded with Harding, Watson and Stanton and Manny's true defenders; Lincoln did not actively participate in the planning or arguing of the case, but kept in Cincinnati as a spectator.|$|E
500|$|There were rumours in February 1976 that Soviet {{tanks were}} being {{unloaded}} in Mozambique {{to help in}} the war. Unluckily for Van der Byl, the British Foreign Office minister was David Ennals, one of those who had received rough treatment in 1966. Ennals announced that {{in the event of a}} racial war breaking out in Rhodesia, there would be no British help. Van der Byl responded by claiming this indicated Britain accepting Rhodesia's independence. He attacked Abel Muzorewa for supporting President Machel, saying that [...] "being a good churchman and a Bishop there is a very strong possibility <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> communist".|$|E
500|$|In January 1877 Eddy spurned an {{approach}} from Daniel Spofford, and to everyone's surprise married {{another of her}} students, Asa Gilbert Eddy. Eddy already believed that her former student and business partner Richard Kennedy was plotting against her. Weeks after the wedding Spofford was suspected too. She had hinted in October 1876 that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> successor, but instead he was expelled from the Christian Scientists' Association for [...] "immorality" [...] after quarrelling with her over money. She filed lawsuits against him and others for royalties or unpaid tuition fees. McClure's wrote that Eddy required [...] "absolute and unquestioning conformity" [...] from her students.|$|E

500|$|Coke was re-elected to Parliament in 1790, {{at a time}} {{of great}} {{political}} trouble. The French Revolution a year earlier had torn the Whig party in half, with Coke and Fox in the isolated minority who supported the revolutionaries as their acts became more brutal. With the declaration of war in 1793, an impact was finally felt in Britain with a rise in agricultural prices and rent. It also led to the establishment of local yeomanry forces to defend the country, something Coke opposed. This reduced his popularity in Norfolk and led to suspicions <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> Jacobin, {{to the point where he}} was forced to publicly declare that he was not a Republican and [...] "detested their principles". Eventually, late September 1798, he raised the Holkham Yeoman Cavalry, commanding it as a Major, to defend against any invasion. This unit was dissolved in 1802 with the Peace of Amiens, but after war broke out again a year later more volunteer regiments were formed. Coke was notably absent from any preparations for defence, feeling that the risks of invasion were exaggerated, but was eventually persuaded by public opinion to reform the Yeoman Cavalry in 1803; it was again dissolved in 1805.|$|E
500|$|Patrick Stewart {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Jean-Luc Picard after Justman saw him perform at the University of California, Los Angeles. Roddenberry insisted that he wanted a French actor in the role, but Justman {{arranged}} a meeting between Stewart and the production team to introduce the actor, and later Berman supported the casting. Fontana thought that American actor Stephen Macht would be better in the role. Justman wanted Stewart in the show in some capacity, and with Roddenberry still opposing him as Picard, Justman suggested that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> good fit instead for Data. Because Roddenberry couldn't find an actor he preferred more for Picard, he relented and changed his concept of Picard to better fit Stewart. Although Stewart was willing to put on an American accent to portray the role of Picard, the producers asked him to use his natural accent instead. They also tested him with a hairpiece but thought that it looked [...] "awful". Stewart was pleased to have received the role, saying that his children were impressed with the new part and praised the mythos of the show saying, [...] "The great strength of Star Trek is its epic, classic feel. For an actor of my background, it has more richness and depth than you might expect on television." ...|$|E

500|$|Pound {{broadcast}} over Rome Radio, although the Italian government {{was at first}} reluctant, concerned that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> double agent. He told a friend: [...] "It took me, I think it was, two years, insistence and wrangling etc., {{to get hold of}} their microphone." [...] He recorded over a hundred broadcasts criticizing the United States, Roosevelt, Roosevelt's family and the Jews, and rambling about his poetry, economics and Chinese philosophy. The first was in January 1935, and by February 1940 he was broadcasting regularly; he traveled to Rome one week a month to pre-record the 10-minute broadcasts, for which he was paid around $17, and they were broadcast every three days. The broadcasts required the Italian government's approval, although he often changed the text in the studio. Tytell wrote that Pound's voice had assumed a [...] "rasping, buzzing quality like the sound of a hornet stuck in a jar", that throughout the [...] "disordered rhetoric of the talks he sustained the notes of chaos, hysteria, and exacerbated outrage." [...] The politics apart, Pound needed the money; his father's pension payments had stopped —his father died in February 1942 in Rapallo — and Pound had his mother and Dorothy to look after.|$|E
500|$|Despite this, {{shortly after}} the British race McLaren's {{experienced}} team manager Teddy Mayer decided not to continue with Villeneuve for the following year. His explanation was that Villeneuve [...] "was looking as though <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> bit expensive" [...] and that Patrick Tambay, the team's eventual choice for 1978, was showing similar promise. Villeneuve was left with no solid options for 1978, although Canadian Walter Wolf, for whom Villeneuve had driven in Can-Am racing, considered giving him a drive at Wolf Racing. Rumours circulated that Villeneuve {{was one of several}} drivers in whom Ferrari's team was interested, and in August 1977 he flew to Italy to meet Enzo Ferrari, who was immediately reminded of the pre-war European champion Tazio Nuvolari: [...] "When they presented me with this 'piccolo Canadese' (little Canadian), this minuscule bundle of nerves, I immediately recognised in him the physique of Nuvolari and said to myself, let's give him a try." [...] Ferrari was satisfied with Villeneuve's promise after a session at Ferrari's Fiorano test track, despite the Canadian making many mistakes and setting relatively slow times, and Villeneuve signed to drive for Ferrari in the last two races of the 1977 season and the 1978 season. Villeneuve later remarked that: [...] "If someone said to me that you can have three wishes, my first would have been to get into racing, my second to be in Formula 1, my third to drive for Ferrari..." ...|$|E

[...] The Methodist showed Kent the list of questions he and Parsons had drawn up for the ghost to answer. [...] One concerned William and Fanny's marital status, prompting Kent {{to admit that they}} never married. [...] Moore told him he did not think he was a murderer, rather, he believed the spirit's presence indicated that [...] "there was something behind darker than all the rest, and that if he would go to Parson's house, <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> witness to the same and convinced of its reality". [...] On 12January therefore, Kent enlisted the aid of the two physicians who attended Fanny in her last days, and with Broughton, went to Cock Lane. [...] On the house's upper floor Elizabeth Parsons was publicly undressed, and with her younger sister was put to bed. [...] The audience sat around the bed, positioned in the centre of the room. [...] They were warned that the ghost was sensitive to disbelief and told that they should accord it due respect. [...] When the séance began, a relative of Parsons, Mary Frazer, ran around the room shouting [...] "Fanny, Fanny, why don't you come? [...] Do come, pray Fanny, come; dear Fanny, come!" [...] When nothing happened, Moore told the group the ghost would not come as they were making too much noise. [...] He asked them to leave the room, telling them he would try to contact the ghost by stamping his foot. [...] About ten minutes later they were told the ghost had returned and that they should re-enter the room. [...] Moore then started to run through his and Parsons' list of questions: ...|$|E
