40|$|CAPSULE DESCRIPTION: Graphite veins {{currently}} mined {{are from}} few centimetres to a m&e thick. Typically they cut amphibolite to granulite grade metamorphic rocks and/or associated intmsive rocks. TECTONIC SETTING(S) : <b>Katazone</b> (relatively deep, high-grade metamorphic environments associated with igneous activity; {{conditions that are}} common in the shield areas). DEPOSITIONAL ENVIRONMENT/GEOLOGICAL SETTING: Veins form in high-grade, dynamothermal metamorphic environment where metasedimentary belts are invaded by igneous rocks. AGE OF MINERALIZATION: Any age; most commonIy Precambrian. HOST/ASSOCIATED ROCK TYPES: Hosted by paragneisses, quartzites, clinopyroxenites, wollastonite-rich rocks, pegmatites. Other associated rocks are chamockites ~ granitic and intermediate intrusive rocks, quartz-mica schists, granulites, aplites, marbles, amphibohtes, magnetite-graphite iron formations and anorthosites. DEPOSIT FORM: Veins are from a few millimetres to over a metre thick in places, although usually less than 0. 3 meter thick. Individual veins display a variety of forms, including saddle-, pod- or lens-shaped, tabular or irregular bodies; frequently forming anastomosing or stockwork patterns. The mines in Sri Lanka are from 30 m&es to 400 m&es deep; individual veins rarely extend mare than tens o...|$|E
