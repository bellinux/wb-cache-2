5|$|The {{history of}} Burnham-on-Sea <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> the {{reclamation}} of the Somerset Levels from the River Severn and the Bristol Channel. The Romans {{were the first}} peoples to try to reclaim the Somerset levels, and it was their people who were probably the first settlers in the high sand dunes behind the River Parrett. This {{could have been in}} part to maintain navigational systems, to aid ships entering the River Parrett and what is now Highbridge. When the Romans left, the system of drainage they installed was not maintained, and the areas reverted to become a tidal salt flat during the Anglo Saxon period.|$|E

These include the traditional Muslim biographies of Muhammad, and quotes attributed to him (the sira and hadith literature), which provide further information on Muhammad's life. The earliest surviving written sira (biographies of Muhammad and quotes attributed to him) is Ibn Ishaq's Life of God's Messenger written some 120 to 130years after Muhammad's death. Although the original work is lost, portions of it survive in the recensions of Ibn Hisham and Al-Tabari.

25|$|The {{history of}} phycology <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> the {{scientific}} study of algae. Human interest in plants as food goes back into the origins of the species and knowledge of algae can be traced back more than two thousand years.

25|$|The {{history of}} Assam <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> a {{confluence}} {{of people from the}} east, west and the north; the confluence of the Tibeto-Burman (Sino-Tibetan), Indo-Aryan and Austroasiatic cultures. Although invaded over the centuries, it was never a vassal or a colony to an external power until the third Burmese invasion in 1821, and, subsequently, the British ingress into Assam in 1824 during the First Anglo-Burmese War.|$|E

25|$|A {{recurring}} {{subject area}} for Franklin <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> the Vietnam War {{and its role}} in American literature and culture since 1966. His books M.I.A., or Mythmaking in America and Vietnam and America: A Documented History (which he co-edited) have been used in courses on the Vietnam War. His Vietnam and Other American Fantasies (2000) synthesized his previous work and extended it into an overview of 21st-century American culture.|$|E
25|$|After his death, Thucydides's History was {{subdivided}} into eight books: its modern title <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>History</b> <b>of</b> the Peloponnesian War. His great contribution {{to history and}} historiography is contained in this one dense history of the 27-year war between Athens and Sparta, each alongside their respective allies. This subdividing was most likely done by librarians and archivists, themselves being historians and scholars, most likely working in the Library of Alexandria.|$|E
25|$|Aspects of {{the subject}} which {{have come to the}} fore in recent decades include {{interest}} in the patronage and consumption of art, including the economics of the art market, the role of collectors, the intentions and aspirations of those commissioning works, and the reactions of contemporary and later viewers and owners. Museum studies, including the history of museum collecting and display, is now a specialized field of study, as <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> collecting.|$|E

40|$|Not only <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>histories</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Negro in America and {{railroad}}ing inseparable, says Eric Arnesen in his superb {{study of}} African Americans and the railroad industry, but so too <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> railroading predicated upon racial divisions of labor (p. 5). These two fine studies describe both {{the central role}} of African Americans in America s railroads and the place of racial discrimination in rail employment. More, they show how railroad labor struggles <b>were</b> <b>the</b> proving ground for the larger struggles for civil rights and racial equality. ...|$|R
25|$|The {{history of}} World Championship Wrestling (WCW) <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> the American {{professional}} wrestling promotion that existed from 1988 to 2001.

25|$|The {{history of}} {{navigation}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> seamanship, {{the art of}} directing vessels upon the open sea through the establishment of its position and course by means of traditional practice, geometry, astronomy, or special instruments.

25|$|The {{history of}} the Netherlands <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> {{seafaring}} people thriving on a lowland river delta on the North Sea in northwestern Europe. Records begin with the four centuries during which the region formed a militarized border zone of the Roman empire. This came under increasing pressure from Germanic peoples moving westwards. As Roman power collapsed and the Middle Ages began, three dominant Germanic peoples coalesced in the area, Frisians {{in the north and}} coastal areas, Low Saxons in the northeast, and the Franks in the south.|$|E

25|$|From its {{founding}} in the mid-17th century {{to the creation of}} the modern city of Kingston in 1872, the history of the Stockade District <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> Kingston. Most of its older buildings were restored and rebuilt in the years after the 1777 burning of the village by the British, and its historic character has been made diverse as significant buildings were erected throughout the 19th century. Late 20th century preservation efforts have led to some confrontations between the city and its residents in recent years.|$|E
25|$|A {{dramatic}} {{example of}} the effect of food processing on a population's health <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> epidemics of beri-beri in people subsisting on polished rice. Removing the outer layer of rice by polishing it removes with it the essential vitamin thiamine, causing beri-beri. Another example is the development of scurvy among infants in the late 19th century in the United States. It turned out {{that the vast majority of}} sufferers were being fed milk that had been heat-treated (as suggested by Pasteur) to control bacterial disease. Pasteurisation was effective against bacteria, but it destroyed the vitamin C.|$|E
