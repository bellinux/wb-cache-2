25|$|I {{composed}} the fugue first and {{wrote it down}} while I was thinking out the prelude. <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>hope</b> {{that you will be}} able to read it, for it is written so very small; and I hope further that you will like it. Another time I shall send you something better for the clavier. My dear Constanze is really the cause of this fugue's coming into the world. Baron van Swieten, to whom I go every Sunday, gave me all the works of Händel and Sebastian Bach to take home with me (after I had played them to him). When Constanze heard the fugues, she absolutely fell in love with them. Now she will listen to nothing but fugues, and particularly (in this kind of composition) the works of Händel and Bach. Well, as she has often heard me play fugues out of my head, she asked me if I had ever written any down, and when I said I had not, she scolded me roundly for not recording some of my compositions in this most artistically beautiful of all musical forms and never ceased to entreat me until I wrote down a fugue for her.|$|E
500|$|Pacquette {{earned a}} call-up to the Dominica {{national}} {{team for the}} 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification CONCACAF First Round match against Barbados on 6 February 2008. Barbados went into the match as heavy favourites but fell behind to Pacquette's goal on his international debut, which finished as a 1–1 draw. After making his debut, manager Christopher Ericson said [...] "He is great in front of goal, powerful and full of effort and work. <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>hope</b> {{that we can get}} him some more support up front in the next game – if we do I am sure we can win it". He also played in the 1–0 defeat in the second leg on 26 March.|$|E
500|$|... "Provenance" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from television critics. Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity awarded the episode an A– grade. John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a largely positive review and awarded it a 9 out of 10. He wrote, [...] "Overall, {{this was a}} powerfully intense episode with plenty of strong characterization and ties to former continuity. In short, this episode had something for everyone. <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>hope</b> that the next episode manages {{to live up to}} this beginning." [...] Jeffrey Robinson from DVD Talk concluded that [...] "Provenance", along with its follow-up [...] "Providence", [...] "does a fairly good job without including Duchovny" [...] due to its adherence to [...] "the series' main storyline [...] the government conspiracies." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>hoped</b> so. <b>I</b> feared I {{might be}} wrong. But I began to find holding myself back {{was getting too}} hard, and I was afraid {{somebody}} else might come along who {{had the power to}} rouse you. I believe you can be roused." ...|$|R

500|$|The 2/48th Battalion {{remained}} at Sattelberg until late December 1943, when it {{returned to the}} coast in order to regroup. On Christmas Eve, Derrick noted in his diary that the next day would be his [...] "4th Xmas overseas" [...] and [...] "I don't care where I spend the next one <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>hope</b> I'm still on deck [...] ". On 7 February 1944, the battalion sailed from Finschhafen for Australia, disembarking at Brisbane. Granted home leave, Derrick {{made his way to}} South Australia for a short period with Beryl. In April, he was admitted to hospital suffering from malaria before returning to his battalion the following month. During this time, he was charged with being absent without leave and subsequently forfeited a day's pay.|$|E
500|$|After {{less than}} five years as a judge, Denning was {{appointed}} a Lord Justice of Appeal on 14 October 1948. He was sworn in as a Privy Counsellor on 25 October 1948. As a Lord Justice of Appeal he continued to make reforming judgments in a variety of areas, particularly in family law and the rights of deserted wives. In 1952 the Court of Appeal heard Bendall v McWhirter [...] 2 QB 466 and ruled that a deserted wife occupying the marital home had a personal licence to stay there. The decision provoked disapproval among the judiciary and from the public; a correspondent wrote: Dear Sir: You are a disgrace to all mankind to let these women break up homes and expect us chaps to keep them while they rob us of what we have worked for and put us out on the street. <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>hope</b> you have the same trouble as us. So do us all a favour and take a Rolls and run off Beachy Head and don't come back.|$|E
500|$|The storyline was criticised by {{some former}} Coronation Street cast members, who {{believed}} the producers {{were using the}} subject of rape to gain higher ratings than rival soap opera EastEnders. Taylor defended the storyline and hoped that it would help other {{women who had been}} attacked to seek help. She stated [...] "The main focus of the storyline is the psychological effect that the attack has on Toyah. There are many women out there who have been raped or sexually assaulted and we owe it to them {{to make sure that the}} story-line is handled sensitively and accurately. There is no denying that rape is a sensitive and controversial storyline. But I have put my heart and soul into it trying to portray it accurately and <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>hope</b> that women who have experienced it will think I have given it justice." [...] A show spokesperson commented that the storyline would be [...] "handled sensitively" [...] and that it would not become [...] "a whodunnit". Some of the male residents came under suspicion and were forced to give DNA samples. Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne) briefly became the prime suspect, but DNA soon eliminated him from enquires.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Harrison {{looked at}} me very {{steadily}} indeed. Then he looked at Eve. <b>I</b> can <b>only</b> <b>hope</b> that my own expression was as guileless as Eve's.|$|R
6000|$|To {{which he}} replied, [...] "I {{did not look}} for any {{specific}} thing. <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>hoped</b> to find, and find I have, all that there was, only some letters and a few memoranda, and a diary new begun. But I have them here, and we shall for the present say nothing of them. I shall see that poor lad tomorrow evening, and, with his sanction, I shall use some." ...|$|R
500|$|... "Wichita Linebacker" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews. Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode a 7.0 out of 10, indicating {{that it was}} [...] "good". Despite this, he wrote a mixed review, opining that [...] "as far as mysteries go, this was a so-so one," [...] that [...] "the Hearst campus rapist story just doesn't {{seem to be getting}} the proper weight it requires," [...] and that [...] "there's also some strange tonal issues currently." [...] However, he praised the return of Weevil. Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club, was also relatively critical, while focusing praise on Weevil's storyline. He referred to [...] "Wichita Linebacker" [...] as [...] "what I would expect were the show not so ambitious. Here, Veronica isn't going to Hearst College, she's going to Television College, where things that are college-y happen." [...] Television Without Pity gave the episode a [...] "C+". [...] "I don't think it's being overly harsh to say that this was not one of this show's stronger or more exciting episodes. The writing was oddly flat, in the first place, and the attention to detail was subpar as well." [...] In addition, the reviewer criticized the show's treatment of its relationships. [...] "That's one of the things that's made this show great in the past -- layering in complex and important relationships while not actually being a relationship-centered show. <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>hope</b> they go somewhere with the gambling thing, because otherwise, in my opinion, this episode will have been a total waste of time." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "God Almighty, in His wisdom, {{tests the}} {{faithful}} by allowing such calamities to happen. But He, in His mercy, also {{provides us with}} the will and determination, generated by faith, to enable us to transform such tragedies into great achievements, and crises that seem debilitating are transformed into opportunities {{for the advancement of}} humanity. <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>hope</b> that, with your cooperation and leadership, a new world will emerge out of the rubble of the World Trade Center: a world that is blessed by the virtues of freedom, peace, prosperity and harmony." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sometime in the 230s, Lü Yi, the {{supervisor}} of the audit bureau, falsely accused Diao Jia (刁嘉), the Administrator of Jiangxia Commandery (江夏郡; around present-day Wuhan, Hubei), of defaming the imperial court. Sun Quan was so furious {{when he heard about}} it that he had Diao Jia arrested and imprisoned. During the interrogation, when Diao Jia's colleagues were asked whether they heard him defame the imperial court, they all said they did, because they feared retaliation from Lü Yi if they said no. Shi Yi, however, insisted that he did not hear Diao Jia say anything defamatory. As the investigation dragged on for days, the tone of the imperial edicts issued by Sun Quan on this issue became increasingly harsh and stern, to the point where Shi Yi's colleagues feared for his life. Shi Yi remained unfazed and told Sun Quan, [...] "The sword's blade is now on my neck. Why would I dare to conceal the truth, seek my own death, and end up becoming a disloyal ghost? <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>hope</b> that everyone will see the truth." [...] When he was questioned, he answered truthfully and gave consistent responses. Sun Quan eventually believed Shi Yi and spared Diao Jia. The Eastern Jin dynasty historian Xu Zhong (徐眾) praised Shi Yi for maintaining his integrity, standing by his moral principles, and showing moral courage in such a life-threatening situation.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Unlike Mr. Lomas, I {{thoroughly}} enjoy a dance,' he said, {{turning to}} Lady Kelsey. 'My tastes are ingenuous, and <b>I</b> can <b>only</b> <b>hope</b> you've enjoyed your evening {{as much as}} your guests.' ...|$|R

25|$|As {{men have}} said often, {{it seemed as}} if there was in this war a God of Battles who held His mighty hand before the Americans. As I looked at Sergeant Quick wig-wagging there against the sky, I would not have given a tin tobacco-tag for his life. Escape for him seemed impossible. It seemed absurd to hope {{that he would not be}} hit; <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>hoped</b> that he would be hit just a little, in the arm, the shoulder, or the leg.|$|R
6000|$|He {{threw up}} his hand with a gesture of pain and despair. [...] "Don't! <b>I</b> can <b>only</b> <b>hope</b> that girl is utterly bad. Otherwise she is the sport of devils. Help me forget the whole uncanny business." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It {{does not}} signify in the least," [...] said Lily. [...] "Even if I were to meet Mr. Crosbie I don't think I should {{make such a}} fool of myself again. As it is, <b>I</b> can <b>only</b> <b>hope</b> {{he did not see}} it." ...|$|R

5000|$|Pornographer David Hurles {{wrote that}} [...] "Rechy's story set me free... His story {{told me of}} a world <b>I</b> had <b>only</b> <b>hoped</b> might really exist.

60|$|I {{thought that}} I was {{sufficiently}} {{authorized by the}} light to knock at the door. The ladies had not retired as yet. <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>hoped</b> {{they would not have}} any visitors of their own nationality. A broken-down, retired Russian official was to be found there sometimes in the evening. He was infinitely forlorn and wearisome by his mere dismal presence. I think these ladies tolerated his frequent visits because of an ancient friendship with Mr. Haldin, the father, or something of that sort. I made up my mind that if I found him prosing away there in his feeble voice I should remain but a very few minutes.|$|R
