50|$|Languages {{that have}} a <b>dedicated</b> <b>character</b> <b>data</b> type {{generally}} include character literals; these include C, C++, Java, and Visual Basic, but not Python or PHP. Languages without <b>character</b> <b>data</b> types will typically use strings of length 1 to serve the same purpose a <b>character</b> <b>data</b> type would fulfil. This simplifies the implementation and basic usage of a language but also introduces new scope for programming errors.|$|R
50|$|<b>Data</b> <b>characters</b> {{start with}} an odd parity, {{followed}} by a zero bit. This means that the character is a normal <b>data</b> <b>character,</b> followed by eight data bits.|$|R
50|$|Data {{parallelism}} features {{can also}} be implemented by libraries using <b>dedicated</b> <b>data</b> structures, such as parallel arrays.|$|R

30|$|Unlike {{existing}} {{real-time monitoring}} models in which live data are saved on a <b>dedicated</b> <b>data</b> server, real-time data from Karnes injection site are stored on Azure (Fig.  3). This {{does not necessarily}} mean that the data must be installed on a commercial cloud to be effective. Storing Karnes injection data on a commercial cloud rather than a <b>dedicated</b> <b>data</b> server is indeed an economic decision rather than a technical decision. Note that the commercial clouds do not provide any special technique that is essential or preferable for the remote real-time monitoring. In fact, the only requirement for a data server to be suitable for remote real-time monitoring is that the data server needs to be accessible through internet at any time. Thus, the feasibility of the remote real-time monitoring is not affected if real-time data have to be stored on a <b>dedicated</b> <b>data</b> server because of data security or any other reasons.|$|R

50|$|All {{primitives}} {{are four}} characters in length. They {{begin with the}} control character K28.5, followed by three <b>data</b> <b>characters.</b> In some primitives the three <b>data</b> <b>characters</b> are fixed, in others they can be varied to change the meaning or to act as parameters for the primitive. In some cases the last two parameter characters are identical.|$|R

50|$|For example, many URI {{schemes and}} {{protocols}} based on RFCs 1738 and 2396 presume that the <b>data</b> <b>characters</b> will {{be converted to}} bytes according to some unspecified character encoding before being represented in a URI by unreserved characters or percent-encoded bytes. If the scheme does not allow the URI to provide a hint as to what encoding was used, or if the encoding conflicts {{with the use of}} ASCII to percent-encode reserved and unreserved characters, then the URI cannot be reliably interpreted. Some schemes fail to account for encoding at all, and instead just suggest that <b>data</b> <b>characters</b> map directly to URI characters, which leaves it up to implementations to decide whether and how to percent-encode <b>data</b> <b>characters</b> that are in neither the reserved nor unreserved sets.|$|R
50|$|<b>Data</b> <b>characters</b> {{are made}} of two 4-bit symbols. Bits 0..3 are {{transmitted}} in the first symbol, 4..7 in the second.|$|R
50|$|The term CDATA, meaning <b>character</b> <b>data,</b> is {{used for}} distinct, but related, {{purposes}} in the markup languages SGML and XML. The term indicates that a certain portion of the document is general <b>character</b> <b>data,</b> rather than non-character <b>data</b> or <b>character</b> <b>data</b> with a more specific, limited structure.|$|R
50|$|From {{outside the}} United States, MCI Mail could be {{accessed}} via local packet switching services that were offered by local telephone companies. Around 1990 access was also provided via Infonet's <b>dedicated</b> <b>data</b> network. MCI Mail branded this access service: MCI Mail Global Access.|$|R

30|$|For {{small-scale}} {{real-time monitoring}} projects, SDMS may serve {{only as a}} device manager and a data-processing center, although it can {{also serve as a}} data-storage center. This is primarily because it is not cost effective to maintain, manage, and backup a <b>dedicated</b> <b>data</b> server if it is not expected to receive and send a massive volume of data on a 24 / 7 basis. Besides, stored data access from anywhere via internet connection could be a problem. Compared to the <b>dedicated</b> <b>data</b> server, cloud storage is not only cheaper, but also ideal for remote live monitoring because of fast and reliable data accessibility from anywhere of the world. For this reason, after sampling and processing the received data from a remote site, SDMS sends the data through internet to a commercial cloud platform (such as Microsoft Azure), although SDMS can also send the data to any customer’s data server if it is preferred.|$|R
