40|$|The {{suitability}} of wrought oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) superalloy sheet for {{gas turbine engine}} combustor applications was evaluated. Two yttria (Y 2 O 3) dispersion strengthened alloys were evaluated; Incoloy MA 956 and Haynes Development Alloy (HDA) 8077 (NiCrAl base). Preliminary tests showed both alloys to be potentially viable combustor materials, with neither alloy exhibiting a significant advantage over the other. MA 956 {{was selected as the}} final alloy based on manufacturing reproducibility for evaluation as a burner liner. A hybrid PW 2037 inner burner liner containing MA 956 and Hastelloy X components and using a louvered configuration was designed and constructed. The louvered configuration was chosen because of field experience and compatibility with the bill of material PW 2037 design. The simulated flight cycle for the ground based engine tests consisted of 4. 5 min idle, 1. 5 min takeoff and intermediate conditions in a PW 2037 engine with average uncorrected combustor exit temperature of 1527 C.

The focus of one such exercise is to evaluate the sensitivity of <b>fluorescent</b> liquid <b>penetrant</b> <b>inspection.</b> A baseline procedure using the water-washable <b>fluorescent</b> <b>penetrant</b> method defines a foundation for comparing the brightness of low cycle fatigue cracks in titanium test panels. The analysis of deviations in the baseline procedure will determine an acceptable range of operation for the steps in the inspection process. The data also gives insight into the depth of each crack and which step(s) of the inspection process most affect penetrant sensitivities. A set of six low cycle fatigue cracks produced in 6. 35 -mm thick Ti- 6 Al- 4 V specimens was used to conduct the experiments to produce sensitivity data.

50|$|There {{are many}} types of dye used in <b>penetrant</b> <b>inspections.</b> FPI {{operations}} use a dye much more sensitive to smaller flaws than penetrants used in other DPI procedures. This {{is because of the}} nature of the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>penetrant</b> that is applied. With its brilliant yellow glow caused by its reaction with ultraviolet radiation, FPI dye sharply contrasts with the dark background. A vivid reference to even minute flaws is easily observed by a skilled inspector.|$|R
40|$|The {{fractured}} HPTR disc {{belonging to}} an aeroengine retrieved {{from the wreckage}} of an aircraft was investigated. Fractographic examination showed that the HPTR disc had failed by fatigue resulting in extensive damage to the engine followed by which the aircraft had crashed onto the ground. There was multiple fatigue crack initiation at the fillet of the dovetail rim. After initiation, these cracks have propagated simultaneously and joined {{together to form a}} major crack front. The resulting crack had then propagated progressively through the thickness leading to fracturing of a part of the disc. <b>Fluorescent</b> dye <b>penetrant</b> <b>inspection</b> (FPI) carried out on the remaining portion of the disc showed presence of enumerable number of fatigue cracks at the fillet of the dovetail rim at several locations on the circumference. The fatigue cracks were found to have initiated at the fillet in between the cooling holes. Evidences suggest that fatigue was stress related and the crack initiation was resulted due to presence of stress raisers in the form of rough machining marks. The HPTR disc material was found to conform to specification. Microstructural study and hardness survey did not reveal any metallurgical degradation of the disc material due to usage or creep damage. The other wreckage items sent for investigation showed damages which are secondary in nature and were caused after the primary failure i. e., fatigue fracture of the HPTR disc. Evidences do not suggest extensive fire in the engine. It appears that after fracturing of the disc, the rim portion was thrown out under the centrifugal force, which pierced through the engine casing. The projectile sheared off the hydraulic pipeline in the vicinity resulting in immediate fire in the aircraft. The debris of the fuel tanks did not show any signatures of explosion. The fractographic features and failure patterns suggest that the fuel tanks have fractured under impact forces...|$|R

Before the FPI process begins, components are cleaned using a variety of cleaning methods which are selected based on the alloy and the soil types which must be removed. It is also important that the cleaning process not adversely affect the FPI process. From the first three phases of this project it has been found that a hot water rinse can aid in the detection process when using this nondestructive method...|$|E

40|$|One {{important}} part of the manufacturing process of aerospace components is making inspections using <b>Fluorescent</b> <b>Penetrant</b> <b>Inspection</b> (FPI). This mandatory inspection represents a non-negligible part of the manufacturing and service cost. It is therefore important to make the geometry of the components suitable for inspection i. e. practicing Design for Inspection (DFI). This has been studied at an aerospace company with the aim of bringing DFI to the early stages of product development process. In this paper, a tool is proposed for the evaluation of inspectability in the early design stages. The tool is applied on CAD-models of the components automatically ranking the inspectability of design proposals using a novel inspectability index. Thus, inspectability can be considered together with other performance and manufacturing aspects forming a powerful decision support.

40|$|Liquid <b>penetrant</b> <b>inspection</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely applied {{nondestructive}} inspection processes and thus is a major source of confidence in the structural integrity of engineering systems in our society. The simplicity, broad applicability and low cost of liquid <b>penetrant</b> <b>inspection</b> enables and encourages use by workers with expertise ranging from knowledgeable and skilled, to unknowledgeable and unskilled. Although the results should not be expected to be the same, there is a natural tendency to assume equal capabilities and to assume that variations in the process will not significantly affect results. In many cases, old lessons learned must be relearned and the relearning initiative is often the result of major failure in a structure, component or system. The elimination of ozone depleting hydrocarbons has significantly changed the options for precleaning as the initial step in a <b>penetrant</b> <b>inspection</b> process. This paper is intended to re-identify the role and importance of precleaning in a penetrant process; the impact of changing established precleaning processes; alternate precleaning materials and experiences with alternates; the requirement to optimized and requalify <b>penetrant</b> <b>inspection</b> processes with alternate cleaners; and cautions on the use of silicated cleaners...|$|R
