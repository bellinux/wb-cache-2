25|$|Now that <b>Italian</b> <b>Americans</b> have assimilated {{and joined}} the ranks of the middle class, their {{politics}} have shifted. It is not unusual for <b>Italian</b> <b>Americans</b> in Boston, as elsewhere, to vote Republican or to run for office as Republicans; for example, Massachusetts governors Paul Cellucci and John Volpe were Republicans.|$|E

25|$|After their {{increased}} {{immigration to}} the U.S. in the late 19th century, <b>Italian</b> <b>Americans</b> in the South were recruited for laboring jobs.

This incident was one of the largest mass lynchings in U.S. history. A total of twenty Italians were lynched during the 1890s. Although most lynchings of <b>Italian</b> <b>Americans</b> occurred in the South, Italians did not comprise a major portion of immigrants or a major portion of the population as a whole. Isolated lynchings of Italians also occurred in New York, Pennsylvania, and Colorado.|$|E

25|$|The popular culture's {{image of}} ethnic celebrities often {{includes}} stereotypes about immigrant groups.
