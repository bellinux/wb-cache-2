2500|$|First, under §158(a)(3)-(4) {{a person}} who joins a union must suffer no {{discrimination}} or retaliation in their chances for being hired, terms of their work, or in termination. For example, {{in one of the}} first cases, NLRB v Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp, the US Supreme held that the National Labor Relations Board was entitled to order workers be rehired after they had been dismissed for organizing a union at their plant in Aliquippa, Pennsylvania. It is also unlawful for employers to monitor employees who are organizing, for instance by parking outside a union meeting, or videotaping employees giving out union fliers. This can include giving people incentives or bribes to not join a union, so in NLRB v Erie Resistor Corp the Supreme Court held it was unlawful to give 20 years extra seniority to employees who crossed a picket line while the union had called a strike. Second, and by contrast, the Supreme Court had decided in Textile Workers Union of America v Darlington Manufacturing Co Inc that actually shutting down a recently unionized division of an enterprise was lawful, unless it was proven that the employer was motivated by hostility to the union. Third, union members need the right to be represented, in order to carry out basic functions of collective bargaining and settle grievances or disciplinary hearings with management. This entails a duty of fair representation. In NLRB v J Weingarten, Inc the Supreme Court held that an employee in a unionized workplace had the right to a union representative present in a management interview, if it could result in disciplinary action. Although the NLRB has changed its position with different political appointees, the DC Circuit has held the same right goes that non-union workers were equally entitled to be accompanied. Fourth, under §158(a)(5) it is an unfair labor practice to refuse to bargain in good faith, and out of this a right has developed for a union to receive information necessary to perform collective bargaining work. However, in Detroit Edison Co v NLRB the Supreme Court divided 5 to 4 on whether a union was entitled to receive <b>individual</b> <b>testing</b> scores from a program the employer used. Also, in Lechmere, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Board the Supreme Court held 6 to 3 that an employer was entitled to prevent union members, who were not employees, from entering the company parking lot to hand out leaflets. Fifth, there are a large group of cases concerning [...] "unfair" [...] practices of labor organizations, listed in §158(b). For example, in Pattern Makers League of North America v NLRB an employer claimed a union had committed an unfair practice by attempting to enforce fines against employees who had been members, but quit during a strike when their membership agreement promised they would not. Five judges to four dissents held that such fines could not be enforced against people who were no longer union members.|$|E

50|$|The {{concept of}} group testing was first {{introduced}} by Robert Dorfman in 1943 in a short report published in the Notes section of The Annals of Mathematical Statistics. Dorfman's report - as with all the early work on group testing - focused on the probabilistic problem, and aimed to use the novel idea of group testing to reduce the expected number of tests needed to weed out all syphilitic men in a given pool of soldiers. The method was simple: put the soldiers into groups of a given size, and use <b>individual</b> <b>testing</b> (testing items in groups of size one) on the positive groups to find which were infected. Dorfman tabulated the optimum group sizes for this strategy against the prevalence rate of defectiveness in the population.|$|E

[...] NAT testing is expensive, and blood banks in many countries, such as Canada, perform the testing on pooled donor samples. The <b>individual</b> <b>testing</b> is more sensitive to window period donations. [...] The testing is performed at central laboratories in Johannesburg and Durban.|$|E

50|$|Memory is a {{very broad}} {{function}} which includes several distinct abilities, {{all of which can}} be selectively impaired and require <b>individual</b> <b>testing.</b> There is disagreement as to the number of memory systems, depending on the psychological perspective taken.

Semantic memory and episodic memory (collectively called declarative memory or explicit memory); procedural memory and priming or perceptual learning (collectively called non-declarative memory or implicit memory) all four of which are long term memory systems; and working memory or short term memory. Semantic memory is memory for facts, episodic memory is autobiographical memory, procedural memory is memory for the performance of skills, priming is memory facilitated by prior exposure to a stimulus and working memory is a form of short term memory for information manipulation.|$|E

5000|$|By 1973, he {{had come}} up with a revolutionary concept in hearing aid design that was based on the early work of Steinberg and Gardner on {{loudness}} recruitment. This was the idea of using multi-channel compression {{to make up for the}} variable loss of loudness compression (recruitment). Each patient's audiogram, combined with <b>individual</b> <b>testing,</b> would determine a gain-map program for that person. It was multi-channel so that those with hearing losses in specific frequency ranges could receive amplification where needed. Equally important, one band would not [...] "pump" [...] another. For example, the base would not control the gain in the mid and high frequency bands. More importantly, he used [...] "wide dynamic range compression" [...] (WDRC). Unlike the previous [...] "compression limiting" [...] circuits, which limited loud sounds to a certain level but did nothing to increase the gain for quiet sounds, Villchur's WDRC amplifiers increased gain for softer sounds without excessively amplifying louder sounds.|$|E
