5|$|Despite {{manufacturing}} developments The Churchill Machine Tool Co {{experienced a}} lean period from 1921 to 1934, {{being unable to}} distribute a <b>dividend</b> on its ordinary share capital. The commencement of European rearmament from 1935 is given {{as the cause of}} a dramatic turnaround in fortunes. A <b>dividend</b> of 12% was paid in that year; in the following year it was quadrupled and there was a special <b>dividend</b> of 125%. An adjustment to the share capital was made, and in 1938 the <b>dividend</b> was 40%, with an additional scrip bonus of 33.3%. There was a subsequent fall in the yield to 30%, but in cash terms, allowing for capital restructuring, the payment remained the same.|$|E

5|$|In Southern Pacific Company v. Lowe, the Supreme Court {{ruled that}} where a {{shareholder}} receives a <b>dividend</b> representing earnings of a corporation realized by the corporation prior to January 1, 1913, the <b>dividend</b> is not includible in the gross {{income of the}} shareholder for purposes of the Federal Income Tax Act of 1913, Ch. 16, 38 Stat. 114 (Oct. 3, 1913). No issues involving the definition of income with respect to wages, salary or other compensation for labor were decided by the Court.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{case where}} income is not taxed as {{ordinary}} income {{is the case}} of qualified <b>dividends.</b> The general rule taxes <b>dividends</b> as ordinary income. A change allowing use of the same tax rates as is used for long term capital gains rates for qualified <b>dividends</b> was made with the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003. [...] Qualified <b>dividends</b> are <b>dividends</b> paid by domestic corporations or by corporations from foreign countries that have a tax treaty with the United States. This rule applies under the condition that the corporation has included the <b>dividends</b> in its own taxable income. Thus pass-through corporations like REITs and REMICs would not distribute qualified <b>dividends,</b> and the <b>dividends</b> from those entities would be taxed at the ordinary income rates.|$|R
40|$|Arguments for {{eliminating}} the double taxation of <b>dividends</b> {{apply only to}} <b>dividends</b> paid by corporations to individuals. The double (and multiple) taxation of <b>dividends</b> paid by one firm to another intercorporate <b>dividends</b> - was explicitly included in the 1930 s to eliminate pyramidal corporate groups. These structures exist elsewhere, and are associated with corporate governance problems, corporate tax avoidance, and a greater concentration of economic power than is currently possible in the United States. Current US tax reform proposals do not distinguish <b>dividends</b> paid to individuals from intercorporate <b>dividends</b> and, by eliminating double taxation on both sorts of <b>dividends,</b> may allow pyramidal groups in the US again {{for the first time}} since the 1930 s. ...|$|R
5|$|The company {{announced}} post-tax profits in 1949 of £119,909 (tax: £140,500); for 1950 the figures were £164,704 and £201,500, respectively. Total <b>dividend</b> for those years was 30%. By 1952 the net profit was £146,318 (tax: £347,000) and in 1953 the respective figures were £228,583 and £449,000. The <b>dividend</b> {{for both of}} these years was 20%, but in 1953 {{there was also a}} special distribution of 2d/share for capital profits of £17,810 from sale of investments.|$|E
5|$|From the 1840s, use of {{the river}} declined, {{as a result of}} {{competition}} from the railways, and changes in coastal shipping. Littlehampton grew in importance as a port and after years of resistance by the people of Arundel, the customs house was moved there in 1864. The Mid-Sussex Railway opened their line from Horsham to Pulborough and Petworth in 1859, which was extended to Ford and Littlehampton in 1863. Receipts from tolls had peaked at £2044 for the five years from 1835 to 1840, when a <b>dividend</b> of 11.8 percent was paid, but dropped quickly, raising just £389 for years between 1870 and 1875, when the <b>dividend</b> was 1 percent.|$|E
5|$|In 1889 the {{partnership}} {{was transformed into}} a limited company, Charles Churchill & Co Ltd (company registration number 29931). There followed a period of exceptional growth, and in 1896 a <b>dividend</b> of 230% was paid on the company's share capital of £5,500.|$|E
50|$|Debt-financed <b>Dividends</b> Received Limitation -Code Section 246A disallows {{the benefit}} of the <b>dividends</b> {{received}} deduction for debt financed purchases of corporate portfolio stock. As stated by the Joint Committee on Taxation, the provision reduces the deduction for <b>dividends</b> received on debt-financed portfolio stock. Therefore, the <b>dividends</b> received deduction is available only with respect to <b>dividends</b> “attributable” to stock financed through other means besides debt. A simple ratio is computed to determine what percentage of an investment is debt-financed. As a result, the <b>dividends</b> received deduction is reduced by the percentage of the investment funded by debt.|$|R

50|$|<b>Dividends</b> paid by {{the firms}} are viewed {{positively}} both by the investors and the firms. The firms which do not pay <b>dividends</b> are rated in oppositely by investors thus affecting the share price. The people who support relevance of <b>dividends</b> clearly state that regular <b>dividends</b> reduce uncertainty of the shareholders i.e. the earnings of the firm is discounted at a lower rate, ke thereby increasing the market value. However, its exactly opposite {{in the case of}} increased uncertainty due to non-payment of <b>dividends.</b>|$|R

Despite this the group was among the biggest machine tool organisations in the world, employing 2,000 people and having sales of £14M.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{receipts}} {{were initially}} insufficient {{to cover the}} six per cent <b>dividend</b> on the £5,697 that the Conservators had invested, they added the difference to the capital, so that the debt steadily increased. This state of affairs was challenged in 1735, when it was decreed that the original capital had been repaid, and the poor should now benefit, but the decision was overturned in 1738 on appeal.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Corzine coauthored (with Bob Graham) a tax-cut {{proposal}} {{aimed at}} lowering the marginal tax bracket from 15% to 10% {{on the first}} $19,000 of taxable income. In 2002, he proposed a tax cut that exempted the first $10,000 of income from the $765 of Social Security taxes for both employers and employees.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between <b>dividends</b> and corporate governance in five East Asian countries {{over the period}} 1994 - 2003, comparing the outcome and substitute models, is investigated. Evidence of a pre-crisis negative {{relationship between}} <b>dividends</b> and governance indicates that <b>dividends</b> act {{as a substitute for}} other corporate governance mechanisms during this exuberant period. A strong positive relationship between governance and <b>dividends</b> emerges post-crisis, consistent with substantial improvements in governance empowering shareholders. The relationship is incremental to the effect of the legal regime, confirming that shareholder protection at the firm level is important to forcing firms to disgorge cash in an outcome model of <b>dividends.</b> corporate governance, financial crisis, <b>dividends,</b> emerging markets,...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{compares the}} value {{relevance}} of book value and <b>dividends</b> versus book value and reported earnings. Our work {{is motivated by}} recent research including Ohlson (1995), Feltham and Ohlson (1995), Bernard (1995), Burgstahler and Dichev (1997), Collins, Maydew and Weiss (1997), Barth, Beaver and Landsman (1998) and Hand and Landsman (1999). We justify modeling price in terms of book value and <b>dividends</b> in two ways. First, using Modigliani and Miller's (1959) argument, <b>dividends</b> may have a stronger correlation with permanent earnings than reported earnings. Second, we derive a model of price in terms of book value and <b>dividends</b> from basic analytical relationships. Three sets of findings are reported. First, overall, the variables, book value and <b>dividends,</b> have almost the same explanatory power as book value and reported earnings. Second, for firms with transitory earnings, <b>dividends</b> have greater explanatory power than earnings but book value and earnings have about the same explanatory power as book value and <b>dividends.</b> Most important, when earnings are transitory and book value is a poor indicator of value, <b>dividends</b> have the greatest explanatory power of the three variables. The value relevance of <b>dividends</b> is confirmed further in statistical tests using holdout samples. ...|$|R

5|$|Traffic, {{receipts}} and dividends steadily increased. Tolls rose from £1,468 in 1779 to £6,807 in 1821. The first <b>dividend</b> of 3.75 per cent was paid in 1786, and had reached 15.78 per cent by 1821. Figures for tonnage {{are not available}} for the early years, but were 79,359 tons in 1821. There was {{a dip in the}} carriage of merchandise in 1810, when the Kennet and Avon Canal opened and provided a more convenient route from Bristol to London, but it picked up again after 1819, when the North Wilts Canal opened, providing a link from Latton to Abingdon via Swindon and the Wilts and Berks Canal, which was easier than using the Thames. The highest <b>dividend</b> paid was in 1833, when shareholders received 26.33 per cent, after which {{receipts and}} dividends steadily dropped. In 1859 in order to allow the passage of a coal barge called the Queen Esther two of the locks were widened.|$|E
50|$|One school {{consists}} {{of people like}} James E. Walter and Myron J. Gordon (see Gordon model), who believe that current cash <b>dividends</b> are less risky than future capital gains.

Another school linked to Modigliani and Miller holds that investors don't really choose between future gains and cash <b>dividends.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We present {{evidence}} that the aggregate stock price and <b>dividends</b> are fractionally integrated. Considering this possibility, we examine relations between stock returns, <b>dividends</b> and the log dividend-price ratio. The log dividend-price ratio has a strong predictability for future values of fractionally differenced <b>dividends</b> in longhorizon regressions. Also, the theoretical dividend-price ratio constructed from the VAR with fractionally differenced <b>dividends</b> track the actual log dividend-price ratio more closely than that from the VAR with first differenced <b>dividends</b> or with stock returns. Moreover, {{the relationship between the}} log dividend-price ratio and fractionally differenced <b>dividends</b> holds stable regardless of sample periods under consideration.

40|$|<b>Dividends</b> {{seem to be}} {{more heavily}} taxed than capital gains. Why then do {{corporations}} pay <b>dividends</b> rather than repurchasing shares or retaining earnings? Either corporations are not acting in the interests of shareholders, or else shareholders desire <b>dividends</b> sufficiently for nontax reasons to offset the tax effect. In this paper, we measure the relative valuation of <b>dividends</b> and capital gains in the stock market, using a variant of the capital asset pricing model. We find that <b>dividends</b> are not valued differently systematically from capital gains. This finding is consistent with share price maximization by firms but inconsistent with the fact that most shareholders pay a heavier tax on <b>dividends.</b> We also show that the relative value of <b>dividends</b> provides an indirect measure of a marginal Tobin's q. The measured value of <b>dividends</b> relative to capital gains tends to be higher during prosperous periods, as is consistent with this interpretation. We hope that this time series on a marginal Tobin's q will prove to be useful in forecasting the rate of investment. ...|$|R
5|$|In 1853, {{with income}} no longer meeting {{operational}} costs, the canal was leased to the Bristol and Exeter Railway. From 1854, the company started {{to pay a}} <b>dividend</b> to its shareholders of 0.2%. Just ten years later, an Act of Parliament was obtained to sell the canal to the railway company and to abandon the Somerset section of the canal. The transfer took place on 13 April 1865, and the tub-boat canal was closed in 1867. The lifts were dismantled, {{and most of the}} route sold back to the original landowners.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to its losses, UBS announced a CHF 15billion rights offering {{to raise the}} additional funds need to shore up its depleted reserves of capital.

Marcel Ospel, who had been the architect of the merger that created UBS in 1998, also announced that he would step down as a chairman of the bank to be replaced by Peter Kurer, the bank's general counsel with virtually no banking experience. This ultimately proved very costly to UBS.|$|E

5|$|Ahead of {{the opening}} of the IPO, {{concerns}} were raised among both investors and Manchester United supporters regarding the details of the share offering. Although the share prospectus specified that the proceeds from the sale would go towards paying down the club's debts, it was revealed that much of the money would go directly to the Glazers. Furthermore, holders of class A shares would not be entitled to a regular <b>dividend,</b> and the structure of the share issue meant that the Glazers' class B shares had 10 times the voting power of class A shares, essentially denying a controlling interest in the club to anyone but the Glazers. These issues drove down interest and forced a drop in the share price from the planned $16–20 each to $14 each, representing a potential total sale value of $233million (£150million).|$|E
5|$|Although {{the company}} had {{permission}} to construct the railway, it still had to raise the capital for the construction works. The BS was not alone; four other new tube railway companies were looking for investors– the Waterloo and City Railway (W), the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway (CCE) and the Great Northern and City Railway (GN) (the three other companies that were put forward in bills in 1892) and the Central London Railway (CLR, which received royal assent in 1891). The original tube railway, the C, was also raising funds to construct extensions to its existing line. Only the W, which was the shortest line and was backed by the London and South Western Railway with a guaranteed <b>dividend,</b> was able to raise its funds without difficulty. For the BS and the rest, and others that came later, much of {{the remainder of the}} decade saw a struggle to find finance in an uninterested market.|$|E
