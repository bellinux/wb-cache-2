5|$|In one of {{his final}} acts as governor, Letcher proclaimed the first thanksgiving day in Kentucky on September 26, 1844. After leaving office, he resumed his law {{practice}} in Frankfort. In 1847, {{he was one of}} four contenders for a seat in the U.S. Senate. The other contenders consisted of two fellow Whigs and a Democrat. After twenty-eight ballots, no winner emerged, and Letcher's supporters withdrew his name and nominated <b>Joseph</b> <b>R.</b> Underwood, who eventually won the seat.|$|E
5|$|Old Court {{chief justice}} John Boyle {{resigned}} {{to accept a}} federal judgeship. The General Assembly decided to speed the reconciliation of {{the two sides of}} the controversy by naming New Court partisan George Bibb as Boyle's replacement.

The governor appointed George Robertson and <b>Joseph</b> <b>R.</b> Underwood, who were both confirmed by the Senate.|$|E

5|$|Breathitt {{was elected}} to {{represent}} Logan County in the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1811, and was re-elected every year until 1815. In the gubernatorial election of 1828, the Democrats chose William T. Barry as their candidate for governor. Initially, they offered the nomination for lieutenant governor to Judge John P. Oldham, but Oldham declined, and Breathitt was chosen as his replacement. Barry lost the governorship to National Republican Thomas Metcalfe, but Breathitt defeated Metcalfe's running mate <b>Joseph</b> <b>R.</b> Underwood by more than 1,000 votes.|$|E
5|$|Burton v.

United States, 196 U.S. 283 (1905) and Burton v. United States, 202 U.S. 344 (1906). Burton was convicted of acting as counsel to Rialto Grain and Securities Company in the United States Postmaster General's investigation of Rialto for mail fraud.|$|E
5|$|Charles W. Holliday and <b>Joseph</b> <b>R.</b> Coelho {{devised a}} new key in 2004 to {{identify}} the Sphecius species, examining 4,451 wasps among the five New World species, and noting that 98% of the female S. convallis wasps examined had yellow markings on gastral tergites one to four (or fewer) and S.grandis had 98% yellow markings from tergites one to five (or more). The 2% percent of S.grandis that overlapped with S.convallis were determined by density of the punctation in colour of the first tergum against the second. The markings on S.grandis males {{were found to be}} the same as on females.|$|E

5|$|Ecnomiohyla rabborum is {{classified}} under the genus Ecnomiohyla of the treefrog subfamily Hylinae, family Hylidae. It was first described in 2008 {{by a team}} of herpetologists consisting of <b>Joseph</b> <b>R.</b> Mendelson III, Jay M. Savage, Edgardo Griffith, Heidi Ross, Brian Kubicki, and Ronald Gagliardo. During its discovery in 2005, it was initially misidentified by the team as Ecnomiohyla fimbrimembra, but Kubicki recognized it as a new species. The type specimens were raised in captivity. They were obtained from tadpoles collected by Griffith and Ross from an area near El Valle de Antón, Coclé, Panama on July 15, 2005.|$|E
5|$|Hispanic men {{and women}} have reached the top ranks of the Coast Guard, serving their country in {{sensitive}} leadership positions on domestic and foreign shores. In 1991, LTJG Katherine Tiongson became the first Hispanic-American female to command an afloat unit. In 2006, Ronald J. Rábago was the first Hispanic-American promoted to Rear Admiral (lower half). In 2009, Rear Admiral <b>Joseph</b> <b>R.</b> Castillo became the first Hispanic-American district commander in the U.S. Coast Guard. Hispanics currently account for 11% of the enlisted personnel, and 9% of the United States Coast Guard Academy's student body.|$|E
5|$|In the {{afternoon}} of September 2 Schmitt radioed 1st Battalion for an airdrop of supplies. A US plane attempted the drop, but the perimeter was so small and the slopes so steep that virtually all the supplies went into North Korean hands. The men in the perimeter did, however, recover from a drop made later at 19:00 some supplies and ammunition. Private First Class <b>Joseph</b> <b>R.</b> Ouellette, of H Company, left the perimeter to gather weapons, ammunition, and grenades from the North Korean dead. On several occasions he was attacked, and on one such occasion a North Korean soldier suddenly attacked Ouellette, who killed the North Korean in hand-to-hand combat.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} found that the western cicada killer wasp is capable of {{thermoregulation}} which enables them to maintain territories during the day. A study by <b>Joseph</b> <b>R.</b> Coelho showed that during territorial patrolling the species had a high and regulated thorax temperature. Experiments found that the wasp has the ability to shift heat from its thorax to its abdomen and that the abdomen is generally kept colder than the thorax. Dead wasps that were placed in the sun reached abnormally high temperatures when compared to those on nearby plants.|$|E
5|$|Metcalfe {{resigned}} {{his seat}} in the House on June 1, 1828 in order {{to run for the}} governorship of Kentucky. He was chosen as the candidate of the National Republican Party at their nominating convention and was the first gubernatorial candidate in the state to be chosen using this method. He defeated William T. Barry by a margin of 709 votes, but his running mate, <b>Joseph</b> <b>R.</b> Underwood, was badly defeated by the Democratic-Republican nominee, John Breathitt. Metcalfe's election in 1828 marked the first time the governorship had been won by a candidate who was not a Democratic-Republican. However, only one Democratic-Republican would hold the office between Metcalfe's term and the election of Lazarus W. Powell in 1851.|$|E
5|$|The first president, <b>Joseph</b> <b>R.</b> Williams, {{designed}} {{a curriculum that}} required more scientific study than practically any undergraduate institution of the era. It balanced science, liberal arts, and practical training. The curriculum excluded Latin and Greek studies since most applicants did not study any classical languages in their rural high schools. However, it did require three hours of daily manual labor, which kept costs down for both {{the students and the}} College. Despite Williams' innovations and his defense of education for the masses, the State Board of Education saw Williams' curriculum as elitist. They forced him to resign in 1859 and reduced the curriculum to a two-year vocational program.|$|E

5|$|The {{structural}} engineering firm Worthington, Skilling, Helle & Jackson worked to implement Yamasaki's design, developing the tube-frame structural system {{used in the}} buildings. The Port Authority's Engineering Department served as foundation engineers, <b>Joseph</b> <b>R.</b> Loring & Associates as electrical engineers, and Jaros, Baum & Bolles (JB) as mechanical engineers. Tishman Realty & Construction Company was the general contractor on the World Trade Center project. Guy F. Tozzoli, director of the World Trade Department at the Port Authority, and the Port Authority's Chief Engineer, Rino M. Monti, oversaw the project.|$|E
5|$|Confederate Maj. Gen. Henry Heth's division, from Lt. Gen. A.P. Hill's Third Corps, {{advanced}} towards Gettysburg. Heth deployed no cavalry and led, unconventionally, {{with the}} artillery battalion of Major William J. Pegram. Two infantry brigades followed, commanded by Brig. Gens. James J. Archer and <b>Joseph</b> <b>R.</b> Davis, proceeding easterly in columns along the Chambersburg Pike. Three miles (5km) west of town, about 7:30 a.m., Heth's two brigades met light resistance from cavalry vedettes and deployed into line. Eventually, they reached dismounted troopers from Col. William Gamble's cavalry brigade. The first {{shot of the}} battle was claimed to be fired by Lieutenant Marcellus E. Jones of the 8th Illinois Cavalry, fired at an unidentified man on a gray horse over a half-mile away; the act was merely symbolic. Buford's 2,748 troopers would soon be faced with 7,600 Confederate infantrymen, deploying from columns into line of battle.|$|E
5|$|In 1957 Briskin was {{embroiled in}} a {{controversy}} related to the control of MGM. As part of a battle between <b>Joseph</b> <b>R.</b> Vogel and Joseph Tomlinson, Briskin was brought in {{as a member of}} the Board of Directors of MGM, along with MGM's former production head, Louis B. Mayer, and also as a producer for the studio. However, the special board meeting which was held to appoint the two executives was held to be illegal by the Delaware Chancery Court, and the Mayer and Briskin appointments were overturned. The conflict continued on throughout the year, until MGM held a stockholders' meeting in October. During the meeting, the shareholders agreed to expand the board by adding ten new directors. Tomlinson's group was clearly routed, gaining only a single seat of the ten; that single seat was Briskin.|$|E
