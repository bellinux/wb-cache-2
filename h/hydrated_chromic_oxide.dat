Eight crossbred barrows were equipped with T-cannulas in the distal ileum. Four animals received a free protein diet and another four received a diet containing meat and bone meal as the only protein source in the diet. The treatments consisted in evaluating the <b>chromic</b> <b>oxide,</b> acid-insoluble ash naturally occurring in the diet, cellulose and lignin as markers to determine the apparent and standardized digestibility of the amino acids contained in the meat and bone meal. All data were submitted to analysis of variance and means were compared using the Tukey test, with a significance of 5 %. The CIAD, obtained using <b>chromic</b> <b>oxide</b> as external marker, were lower (P< 0. 05) than those obtained when acid insoluble ash, lignin and cellulose were used as markers, observing differences for all the amino acids evaluated.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to compare the methods of feed {{digestibility}} determination in fish and subsequently develop a technique for fish feed digestibility estimations using microtracer. The review of current methods showed {{that none of the}} existing methods fulfil adequately the criterion of an ideal method when employing external markers. Therefore microtracer F-Ni was used in this study and a series of experiments was conducted to evaluate the digestibility coefficients in fish (rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss) using microtracer F-Ni as a marker and compare its suitability with the conventional Cr 203 and acid insoluble ash (AIA) markers. The particle counts of microtracer F-Ni per unit weight were validated in Experiment 1, as it was essential to establish a consistent count of particles per unit weight for the calculation of digestibility values. Both direct counting and colour development methods were used for this purpose. Results showed that microtracer F-Ni marker contained on average 64 particle per mg. The sequential uniformity in the rate of passage of the microtracer through the digestive tract were tested in Experiment 2, using similar diets with four inclusion levels to select one level for further digestibility studies. One percent inclusion level was found to be the best as the rate of increase in concentration {{in different parts of the}} digestive tract and feces were sequential and progressive for all the three days tested. Apparent digestibility coefficients (ADC) of protein and dry matter were determined and compared employing different fecal collection procedure and different collection interval using this marker with <b>chromic</b> <b>oxide</b> marker and acid insoluble ash marker in Experiment 3. Results indicated that the ADC values generated by using microtracer F-Ni were consistent and in close agreement with the ADC values calculated by using <b>chromic</b> <b>oxide</b> as marker in all the situations. The ADC determined by using AIA were inconsistent and higher than the ADC calculated by both <b>chromic</b> <b>oxide</b> and microtracer F-Ni markers. When tnicrotracer F-Ni and <b>chromic</b> <b>oxide</b> were incorporated into the same diet, ADC values calculated were higher than values obtained with individual marker inclusion. In Experiment 4, protein and dry matter digestibility of fish meal and sunflower meal ingredients were determined and compared using microtracer F-Ni, Cr 203 and AIA markers. Digestibility coefficients of nutrients generated using microtracer resulted ADC values similar (P> 0. 05) to those using <b>chromic</b> <b>oxide</b> as external marker.

40|$|Graduation date: 1965 Digestibility {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} with dairy heifers to determine the digestibility of orchard grass, Dactylis glomerata, and also to evaluate the accuracy of various indicator techniques in pasture digestibility experiments. <b>Chromic</b> <b>oxide</b> {{was used as an}} external indicator to predict fecal dry matter output in three digestion trials. Cut grass was fed in one of the trials and corn silage in the other two. The internal indicators fecal nitrogen and protein of feed and feces were studied in two of the trials in which one conventional and one grazing trial were involved. The experimental animals consisted of six approximately two year old Holstein heifers and six Jersey heifers of the same ages. All animals were in about the fifth month of pregnancy. In the experiments, five grams of <b>chromic</b> <b>oxide</b> in gelatin capsules were fed to the animals twice a day at 7 A. M. and 4 P. M. Solka-floc, which is a pure cellulose material, was used as a carrier for <b>chromic</b> <b>oxide.</b> Fecal grab samples were collected from the rectum of grazing animals at 6 A. M. and 4 P. M. The <b>chromic</b> <b>oxide</b> recoveries in the feces of the stall fed animals fed orchard grass ranged from 98. 4 to 99. 2 percent, averaging 98. 8 percent. The average difference between the predicted and actual fecal dry matter output was 23. 1 g. This magnitude of difference yielded a 1. 01 percent error of prediction. However, <b>chromic</b> <b>oxide</b> recoveries for the silage trials were considerably lower, estimated as 79. 9 and 74. 9 percent for trials III and IV respectively. These low recoveries of <b>chromic</b> <b>oxide</b> resulted in a rather high error of prediction of fecal dry matter output with silages. The average errors of prediction for the grass forage dry matter intakes using fecal nitrogen and protein indigestibility techniques were found to be 1. 4 and - 6. 4 percent, respectively. The respective differences between the average actual and predicted forage dry matter intakes were 86. 1 and - 405. 2 g. Based on {{the results of this study}} the fecal nitrogen index technique appears to be superior to the protein indigestibility technique. The digestion coefficients of ether extracts were found to be higher for the conventional trial with pasture than for that of the grazing trial, while the reverse was true for the nitrogen free extracts. The average TDN and digestible energy values for orchard grass dry matter in the conventional trial were found to be 67. 1 and 68. 0 percent, respectively. The difference in estimations of the TDN and digestible energy values between total collection and fecal nitrogen technique was 0. 5 percent, which may be regarded as a reasonable error in digestibility experiments. The TDN and digestible energy values of the grazing trial were slightly higher than that of the conventional trial. The digestible energy determinations were highly correlated with the calculated TDN values. It was concluded that <b>chromic</b> <b>oxide</b> and fecal nitrogen may be used effectively in pasture digestibility experiments.

Dezoito ovinos (56, 5 ± 4, 6 kg PV) foram designados aleatoriamente a dietas compostas de 25, 50 ou 75 % de concentrado e feno de Coast cross por 25 dias. As fezes foram coletadas por cinco dias para determinação da digestibilidade aparente da MS. As amostras de alimentos e fezes foram incubadas no rúmen de três bovinos por 144 horas, para obtenção das frações indigestíveis. Óxido crômico foi administrado a 4, 0 g/animal/dia. A acurácia foi avaliada pela comparação do viés médio (DAMS predito - DAMS observado) entre os indicadores; a precisão, por meio da raiz quadrada do erro de predição e do erro residual; e a robustez, pelo estudo da regressão entre o viés e o consumo de matéria seca, o nível de concentrado e o peso vivo. A recuperação fecal e a acurácia das estimativas da digestibilidade aparente da MS foram maiores para FDAi, seguida pela FDNi, LDAi, pelo óxido crômico e depois pela lignina em detergente ácido. O viés linear foi significativo apenas para FDAi, FDNi e LDAi. O uso de óxido crômico permitiu estimativas mais precisas da digestibilidade aparente da MS. Todos os indicadores foram robustos quanto à variação no consumo de matéria seca e apenas LDAi e óxido crômico foram robustos quanto aos níveis de concentrado na dieta. O óxido crômico não foi robusto quando houve variação no peso vivo animal. Assim, a FDAi é o indicador mais recomendado na estimativa da digestibilidade aparente da MS em ovinos quando o objetivo é comparar aos dados da literatura, enquanto o óxido crômico é mais recomendado quando o objetivo é comparar tratamentos dentro de um mesmo experimento.

Eighteen wethers (56. 5 ± 4. 6 kg BW) were randomly assigned to diets containing 25, 50 or 75 % of concentrate and Coast cross hay for 25 days. Feces were collected during the five days to determine apparent digestibility of dry matter and samples of feed and feces were incubated for 144 hours in bovine rumen to obtain the indigestible fractions. <b>Chromic</b> <b>oxide</b> (4. 0 g/animal) was offered daily. Accuracy was evaluated by comparing mean bias of estimates (predicted dry matter apparent digestibility - observed dry matter apparent digestibility) among markers. Precision was assessed by the root mean square prediction error and the residual error; robustness was studied by the regression between bias and dry matter intake, diet concentrate level and animal body weight. Fecal recovery and accuracy of dry matter apparent digestibility estimates were higher for indigestible acid detergent fiber, followed by indigestible neutral detergent fiber, indigestible acid detergent lignin and <b>chromic</b> <b>oxide,</b> and at last for acid detergent lignin. Linear bias was significant only for indigestible acid detergent fiber, indigestible neutral detergent fiber and indigestible acid detergent lignin. By using <b>chromic</b> <b>oxide</b> it was possible to estimate dry matter apparent digestibility more precisely. All markers were robust regarding to variation of dry matter intake while only indigestible acid detergent lignin and <b>chromic</b> <b>oxide</b> were robust regarding to concentrate levels in the diet. <b>Chromic</b> <b>oxide</b> was not robust when animal body weight varied.

50|$|The Ellingham curve for the {{reaction}} 2C(s) + (g) → 2CO(g) slopes down and falls below the curves {{for all the}} metals. Hence, carbon can normally act as a reducing agent for all metal oxides at very high temperatures. But chromium formed at these temperatures reacts with carbon to form its carbide, which gives undesirable properties to the chromium metal obtained. Hence, for high temperature reduction of <b>chromic</b> <b>oxide,</b> carbon cannot be used.|$|R

40|$|The {{intestinal}} {{absorption of}} trivalent and hexavalent chromium (Cr) given orally (experiment I) or infused in the intestine (experiment II) {{was investigated in}} rats. The nonabsorbable form of chromium 51 (Cr 2 O 3) and water-soluble and more absorbable Na 2 51 CrO 4 (the hexavalent form of Cr) were compared. Total retention of chromium given orally ranged around 15 percent of the dose, regardless of the chromium compounds applied. The absorption rate of <b>chromic</b> <b>oxide,</b> which is considered a nonabsorbable compound, was 14. 4 {{as a percentage of}} chromium intake. This result indicates that some loss of chromium has {{to be taken into account}} in metabolic trials made by the indicator method. In isolated rat intestine, from the injected Cr 2. 5 % of <b>chromic</b> <b>oxide</b> and 43. 2 % of sodium chromate were absorbed during an hour (experiment II). The absorbed chromium was transferred to the liver where the liver tissue retained 10. 9 % of <b>chromic</b> <b>oxide</b> and 51. 1 % of sodium chromate. Radioactivity of v. cava caudalis following intestinal injection of Na 2 CrO 4 was thirtyfold greater than after Na 2 CrO 4 dosing. This phenomenon can be explained by the lower blood clearance of chromate. Different absorption rate of chromate depending on the route of administration could be due to the fact that the hexavalent form given orally was reduced to Cr 3 + in the acidic environment of the stomach. When Na 2 CrO 4 was infused directly in the intestine of rats, such reduction could not occur. This means that the acidic gastric juice might play a role in inhibiting the intestinal absorption of Na 2 CrO 4 when this compound is given orally...|$|R

Fourteen F 1 Red Angus × Nellore bulls averaging 12 months old and 287 kg were kept in individual stalls. The animals were fed elephant grass silage, corn silage or signal grass hay, supplemented or not with 20 % of concentrate mixture. The experiment consisted of two 13 -day experimental periods according to a 2 × 2 Latin square design with seven squares grouping. The animals received 10 g of <b>chromic</b> <b>oxide</b> and 10 g of titanium dioxide through esophageal sounder daily. Fecal grab samples were obtained directly from the rectum of the animals at 1 : 30 a. m., 3 : 00 a. m., 4 : 30 a. m., 6 : 00 a. m., 7 : 30 a. m., 9 : 00 a. m., 10 : 30 a. m., 12 : 00 p. m., 1 : 30 p. m., 3 : 00 p. m., 4 : 30 p. m., 6 : 00 p. m., 7 : 30 p. m., 9 : 00 p. m., 10 : 30 p. m. and 12 : 00 a. m.

40|$|The diets fed {{to growing}} animals are very {{important}} to ensure that young animals have the proper nutrients available for growth. When feeding dairy heifers, a farmer’s goal is to feed a very digestible diet that will provide nutrients to keep dairy heifers healthy and allow them to grow faster, while spending less money on feed. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine whether feeding heifers diets containing dry or ensiled forage (haylage) improved digestibility. Our hypothesis was that incorporating hay into the diet of 16 -week-old dairy heifers would provide a more digestible source of nutrients. For this study, 12 heifers were randomly assigned to treatments, with 6 heifers fed hay-based diets and the other 6 heifers fed haylage-based diets. The heifers were housed in individual pens and fed individually on a daily basis for 8 days. Fecal samples were collected during the last 3 days of the feeding period. The fecal collection was achieved by collecting fecal samples from individual heifers every 6 hours over a 3 -day period. Digestibility of the diets and nutrients were determined using <b>chromic</b> <b>oxide</b> as an external marker. In order to determine the digestibility of haylage or hay diets fed to the heifers, the percent of <b>chromic</b> <b>oxide</b> in feed was compared to the percent of <b>chromic</b> <b>oxide</b> in feces. The neutral detergent fiber (NDF) of the feeds and feces was determined using the Ankom Fiber Analysis System. Data were analyzed using the Proc Mixed procedure of the Statistical Analysis System. The dry matter digestibility of the diets were similar between treatments (P = 0. 19) and was 68. 4 % for the hay diet and 66. 6 % for the haylage diet. The NDF digestibility was also similar between diets (P = 0. 21) with an NDF digestibility of 68. 4 % for hay and 66. 1 % for haylage diets. In summary, feeding dairy heifers hay-based diets did not significantly improve either the dry matter or NDF digestibility of the diets...|$|R

The Bureau's procedure consists of roasting the waste catalyst with sodium hydroxide (naoh) or sodium carbonate (na 2 co 3), followed by water leaching. The chromium from the leach liquor was recovered utilizing an oxidation-reduction reaction with ph adjustment to form a hydrous <b>chromic</b> <b>oxide</b> (cr 2 o 3. Xh 2 o) precipitate. The roast-leach procedure produced chromium extractions greater than 89. 7 pct, with product recovery in excess of 99 pct from the leach liquor. The costs of the naoh and na 2 co 3 roast processes, including sizing and equipment-related recommendations, were determined by the Bureau's office of process evaluation. The economic evaluation indicates that producing a cr 2 o 3 product, at the present time, is not competitive with the present-day cost of imported chromites. The estimated average operating cost for both processes was $ 5. 44 /Lb of recovered cr 2 o 3 concentrate.
