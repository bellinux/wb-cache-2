2500|$|<b>Homer's</b> biographers offer varying {{accounts}} of the events surrounding both the painting's conception and initial development. <b>Homer's</b> first biographer, William Howe Downes, wrote that the ducks used for the painting had been purchased by the artist for his Thanksgiving dinner; he so admired their plumage that he painted them instead. <b>Homer's</b> nephew told another of <b>Homer's</b> biographers, Philip Beam, that {{a friend of the}} artist named Phineas W. Sprague shot the birds in Prouts Neck that autumn and hung them on <b>Homer's</b> studio door, and the arrangement inspired the painting's design.

But while there, <b>Homer</b> sees a do it yourself barbecue pit and is compelled to buy it instead of anything that might help him with his work. <b>Homer</b> tries to install the pit, but bungles the job when he drops the parts of the barbecue into wet cement.

As a nervous <b>Homer</b> watches the game at Moe's Tavern, Washington scores {{at the last second}} to win the game. <b>Homer</b> becomes happy and Bart tells Lisa that she still loves <b>Homer,</b> in which she agrees. <b>Homer</b> cancels his bowling date with Barney and—on the Sunday after the Super Bowl—makes good on his promise to go hiking with Lisa.|$|E
