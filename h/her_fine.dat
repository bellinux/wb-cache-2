This long poem, composed between 1940 and 1965, is often critically regarded as her best work and {{also one of}} the finest poems of the twentieth century. It gives a deep and detailed analysis of her epoch and her approach to it, including her important encounter with Isaiah Berlin (1909–97) in 1945. Her talent in composition and translation is evidenced in <b>her</b> <b>fine</b> translations of the works of poets writing in French, English, Italian, Armenian, and Korean.|$|E
5|$|Parry {{was born}} in Merthyr Tydfil in 1841, the seventh of eight {{children}} of Daniel and Elizabeth Parry (née Richards). The family was musically inclined, with all family members singing in the chapel choir. Parry's mother, who performed at church functions, was remembered for <b>her</b> <b>fine</b> voice; two of Parry's sisters, Elizabeth and Jane, and a brother, Henry, gained some prominence in the United States as vocalists. He left school at age nine {{to work in the}} mines as the family needed the income. Young Parry worked a 56-hour week for twelve and a half pence while at the mine. By age 12, Parry was working at the puddling furnaces of the Cyfarthfa Ironworks, where his father also worked.|$|E
5|$|In Petersburg, Virginia, the {{two women}} moved out of broken seats in the black (and back) section of the bus, where state {{segregation}} laws mandated they sit, and into the white section. Inspired by a conversation they had been having about Gandhian civil disobedience, {{the two women}} refused {{to return to the}} rear even after the police were called. They were arrested and jailed. Murray and McBean initially were defended by the NAACP, but when the pair were convicted only of disorderly conduct rather than violating segregation laws, the organization ceased to represent them. The Workers' Defense League (WDL), a socialist labor rights organization that also was beginning to take civil rights cases, paid <b>her</b> <b>fine.</b> A few months later the WDL hired Murray for its administrative committee.|$|E

When she responded that the Communist Party had paid for her clothes, any credibility she had with the jury was destroyed. Judge Horton warned spectators to stop laughing at her testimony or he would eject them.|$|E
25|$|Lemlich quickly made a {{name for}} herself among her fellow workers, leading several strikes of shirtwaist makers and {{challenging}} the mostly male leadership of the union to organize women garment workers.

500|$|On 17 April 1910, Wallis was {{confirmed}} at Christ Episcopal Church, Baltimore, and between 1912 and 1914 her uncle Warfield {{paid for her}} to attend Oldfields School, the most expensive girls' school in Maryland. There she became a friend of heiress Renée du Pont, a daughter of Senator T. Coleman du Pont of the du Pont family, and Mary Kirk, whose family founded Kirk Silverware. A fellow pupil at one of Wallis's schools recalled, [...] "She was bright, brighter than all of us. She {{made up her mind}} to go {{to the head of the}} class, and she did." [...] Wallis was always immaculately dressed and pushed herself hard to do well. A later biographer wrote of her, [...] "Though Wallis's jaw was too heavy for her to be counted beautiful, <b>her</b> <b>fine</b> violet-blue eyes and petite figure, quick wits, vitality, and capacity for total concentration on her interlocutor ensured that she had many admirers." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} year, Cardinale starred opposite Jean-Paul Belmondo as Vénus in the 18th-century set adventure Cartouche, {{which made}} her a major star in France. She also played Angiolina, the romantic interest of Anthony Franciosa in Bolognini's Senilità, a character which film writer Jacek Klinowski describes as [...] "a spirited and strikingly beautiful twenty-year-old". In 1962, Cardinale was interviewed by the writer Alberto Moravia, who focused exclusively on her sexuality and body image in film, treating her as an object. Cardinale remarked to him: [...] "I used my body as a mask, as a representation of myself". The interview was published in Esquire under the title [...] "The Next Goddess of Love". Cardinale was amused {{to discover that the}} interview had inspired the writer to publish La dea dell'amore ("Goddess of Love") the following year, in which one of the characters, with <b>her</b> <b>fine</b> physical appearance and natural curves, closely resembled Cardinale. Just a few years later, she played a similar character in a film based on another novel by Moravia, Time of Indifference.|$|E
500|$|Davey's debut album, Something Ilk, was {{recorded}} at {{a studio in}} Wales, produced by Ben Hillier whose previous credits included Blur and Elbow, and released in 2004. RTÉ reviewer Harry Guerin said it was [...] "high on presence and very low on filler" [...] and gave it three out of five stars. Hot Press remarked, [...] "Not only is her voice elfin, immediate and distinct the songs are also hugely compelling. They are digestible without being lightweight, austere in places without seeming detached". The Irish Independents Paul Byrne described it as [...] "one of the best Irish albums of 2004". Davey performed a nationwide tour in September 2004. She also supported Graham Coxon and Supergrass during tours they undertook that year. The singer later dismissed Something Ilk, saying [...] "I think the record company [...] thought I was an indie rock chick when they signed me and that album is very much other people's idea of what I should sound like. [...] I didn't have the confidence {{to say no to}} some of the things [...] suggested". Davey claimed not to [...] "know my arse from my elbow when I signed for them" [...] and did not like performing those songs in a live arena. Despite this, the Irish Independent described her as [...] "very talented—far more so than [...] Hayes" [...] but regretted that she had [...] "failed to find an audience for <b>her</b> <b>fine</b> debut Something Ilk".|$|E
500|$|The title {{character}} of Grey's Anatomy, Meredith, has received both overwhelmingly positive and weary feedback by critics along {{the course of}} the show, with the development of the character garnering praise from majority critics. Earlier reactions for Meredith were mixed; in a 2006 review, Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times dubbed to her as [...] "the heroine of Grey's Anatomy". A reviewer for BuddyTV praised the distinct uniqueness in the character calling Meredith an [...] "unconventional heroine" [...] adding that the character was, [...] "Neither black nor white but always...wait for it...many shades of grey. The reviewer and to add that even in her lighter moments, she has still been [...] "dark and twisty." [...] The sentiment was shared by Glenn Diaz who remarked, [...] "You gotta love Mer when she's gloomy." [...] When Pompeo did not receive a nomination 61st Primetime Emmy Awards, for her work as Meredith, Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times suggested that Pompeo, [...] "has worked very hard [...] to make Meredith Grey an interesting character", and should have received a nomination. IGN Monfette, less impressed by the character, criticized her storyline as [...] "some bizarrely under-developed sub-plot about depression and giving Derek a season's worth of reconsidering to do." [...] Robert Rorke of the New York Post was critical of Meredith's relationship with Derek Shepherd, writing: [...] "She used to be the queen of the romantic dilemmas, but lately, she's been a little dopey, what with the endless 'McDreamy' soliloquies." [...] The development of the character has received praise from critics. Reviewing {{the first part of the}} eighth season, TV Fanatic wrote: [...] "this season belongs to Meredith Grey. She is the heart and soul of the show and has been outstanding. This is a character that used to be so dark and twisty and has now grown into a more mature woman. Ellen Pompeo has been at the top of her game this season." [...] Rick Porter reviewing the episode How to Save a Life from the eleventh season for Zap2it wrote, [...] "Without Meredith, and without one of Pompeo's strongest performances in her long time on the show, [...] "How to Save a Life" [...] would have run the risk of coming across as a baldly manipulative death episode, the likes of which the show has done several times before. He added. [...] "How to Save a Life" [...] may not be the ideal Emmy-submission episode for Ellen Pompeo, considering Meredith is off screen for more than half of it. But it's among the best work she's ever done on the show." [...] Janalen Samson of BuddyTV lauded the Meredith's development throughout the series saying, [...] "When one considers how this character has grown over eleven seasons, it really is amazing. Kudos to Ellen Pompeo for <b>her</b> <b>fine</b> work. She's actually done the impossible, because I actually care what happens to Meredith Grey." [...] Reviewing the season 12 premiere Sledgehammer critics including Alex Hawkins of the Western Gazette again highlighted Pompeo's due for an Emmy Award.|$|E

[...] She experimented {{in a wide}} variety of media, and developed a style that is at once abstract and lyrical. Much of her art was intended and used to illustrate her published books of poetry. Some of her art pioneered a new technique created by her, which she called wax painting. It involves a controlled flow and manipulation of poured colored molten wax onto canvas, board, or paper. She also used techniques of cut paper and collage in her art, often supplemented by India ink and acrylics. The subjects she focused on in her art were drawn from her rich, symbolic imagination and dream life. She developed a preference for [...] "primitive" [...] art, whose unassuming simplicity she felt was capable of representing the images she wished to portray.|$|E
