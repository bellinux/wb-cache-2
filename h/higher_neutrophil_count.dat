30|$|Preferential {{expression}} of IFNγ-inducible genes in neutrophils (and {{to some extent}} in monocytes) during active TB indicates the involvement of these cells in IFNγ-mediated TB pathogenesis [56]. Neutrophils are frequently infected by Mtb and are abundant {{at the site of}} active disease. Although these cells may help in the containment of the bacilli during the initial phase of infection, their involvement in TB pathogenesis is supported by a number of studies. It has been shown that the frequency of neutrophils at the site of active disease correlates with the disease severity [57]. <b>Higher</b> <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> (neutrophilia) is associated with low sputum conversion and poor TB prognosis [57, 58]. Increased frequency of neutrophils at the affected site has also been demonstrated in susceptible mouse strains and their depletion from these animals resulted in the enhanced resistance to Mtb [59]. Interestingly, IFNγ has been shown to increase neutrophil lifespan which may potentially contribute to neutrophilia in the infected animals. Besides, the functional activity of neutrophils is also bolstered by IFNγ [60].|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to identify the main risk factors for death by New World visceral leishmaniasis and establish a coherent pathogenic substrate of severe disease based on clinical findings. METHODS: Seventy-six deceased inpatients and 320 successfully treated inpatients with VL were studied in a case control study. RESULTS: Bacterial infection and bleeding were mutually exclusive events leading to death. Five risk factors were unique for death by bacterial infection (malnutrition, pulmonary rales, severe anemia, severe absolute neutropenia and <b>higher</b> <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count),</b> while another six were unique for death by bleeding (jaundice, severe relative neutropenia, severe thrombocytopenia, liver injury, kidney failure, higher bone marrow parasite load). Bacterial infection, bleeding, severe anemia, diarrhea, dyspnea, edema, jaundice and bone marrow parasite load were the main syndromes of visceral leishmaniasis among successfully treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: The data support the idea that bacterial infections are due to immune paralysis. Broad organ and system involvement is plausibly due to the high production of proinflammatory cytokines, whose actions fit well with visceral leishmaniasis. The syndromes and causative mediators are typical of a slowly developing systemic inflammatory response syndrome...|$|E

The demonstration of the prominent involvement of interleukin (IL) - 1 in disease pathogenesis has provided {{the rationale for the}} treatment with biologic medications that antagonize this cytokine. The three IL- 1 blockers that have been tested so far (anakinra, canakinumab and rilonacept) have all been proven effective and safe, although only canakinumab is currently approved for use in sJIA.

In this review, we analyze the published literature on IL- 1 inhibitors in sJIA and discuss the rationale underlying the use of these medications, the results of therapeutic studies, and the controversial issues...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Previously, we {{suggested}} that oxaliplatin (L-OHP) -related grade 3 / 4 hypersensitivity reactions occurred {{immediately after the}} initiation, but grade 1 / 2 reactions did not. This {{study was conducted to}} clarify the risk factors for L-OHP-related hypersensitivity reactions. Methods: Clinical data from 108 Japanese patients with colorectal cancer were analyzed, who were treated with L-OHP-containing regimens, FOLFOX 4 and/or mFOLFOX 6. The risk factors examined included demographic data, preexisting allergies, laboratory test data, treatment regimen, treatment line of therapy, pretreatment with steroids, total number of cycles and cumulative amount of L-OHP. Results: The incidence of grade 1 / 2 and grade 3 / 4 hypersensitivity reactions were found at 13. 0 % (14 / 108) and 9. 3 % (10 / 108), respectively. Female (P= 0. 037), preexisting allergies (P= 0. 004) and lower level of lactate dehydrogenase (P= 0. 003) were risk factors for grade 1 / 2 hypersensitivity reactions, and <b>higher</b> <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> (P= 0. 043) and lower monocyte count (P= 0. 007) were for grade 3 / 4 reactions.

40|$|Patients {{with acute}} lobar nephronia (ALN) require a longer {{duration}} of antimicrobial treatment {{than those with}} acute pyelonephritis (APN), and ALN is associated with renal scarring. The {{aim of this study}} was to provide an understanding of ALN by comparing the clinical features of pediatric patients with ALN and APN. Methods: We enrolled all of the patients with ALN (confirmed by computed tomography) admitted to our hospital from 1999 to 2012 in the ALN group. In addition, each patient diagnosed with APN who was matched for sex, age, and admission date to each ALN patient was enrolled in the APN group. The medical charts of patients in these two groups were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed for comparison. Results: The fever duration after hospitalization in the ALN group and the APN group were 4. 85  ±  2. 33 days and 2. 30  ±  1. 47 days respectively. The microbiological distributions and the majority of susceptibilities were similar in the ALN and APN groups.

Objective: We aimed to establish reference intervals {{for a wide range}} of hematologic and plasma biochemistry variables for 2 species of Australian tree frogs, describe morphologic features of leukocytes, and analyze the effects of season, year, and parasite status on blood values. Methods: Blood specimens were collected from reference populations of wild adult Australian tree frogs, Litoria caerulea and L infrafrenata, for analysis of hematologic (manual) variables, plasma biochemical (automated) analytes, and plasma and serum proteins using automated methods, refractometry, and electrophoresis. Results: Inter- and intraspecies differences were found in L caerulea (n = 80) and L infrafrenata (n = 66) frogs for hematologic and biochemical variables.

40|$|IF 5. 008 International audienceBevacizumab is used {{to treat}} glioblastoma; however, no current {{biomarker}} predicts its efficacy. We used an exploratory cohort of patients treated with the radiochemotherapy then bevacizumab or chemotherapy at recurrence (N = 265). Bevacizumab use increased median overall survival (OS) 18. 7 vs 11. 3 months, p = 0. 0014). In multivariate analysis, age, initial surgery, <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count,</b> Karnofsky status > 70 % and bevacizumab administration were independent prognostic factors of survival. We found an interaction between bevacizumab use and baseline <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count.</b> The cut-off value for the <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> was set at 6000 /mm(3). Only patients with a <b>high</b> <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> benefited from the bevacizumab treatment (17. 3 vs 8. 8 months p < 0. 0001).

40|$|This {{retrospective}} {{cross-sectional study}} examined {{if the white}} cell count (WCC) is increased in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and if so, is it due to PCOS or to the associated obesity? Body mass index (BMI) was calculated and body composition was measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis. Of the 113 women studied, 36 had PCOS and 77 did not. The mean WCC was higher in the PCOS group compared with the non-PCOS group (8. 9 x 10 (9) /l vs 7. 4 x 10 (9) /l p = 0. 002). This increase was due to a <b>higher</b> <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> (5. 6 x 10 (9) /l vs 4. 3 x 10 (9) /l; p = 0. 003). There was a leucocytosis (WCC > 11 x 10 (9) /l) present in 19 % of the PCOS group compared with 1 % in the non-PCOS group (p 7. 7 x 10 (9) /l) in 14 % of the PCOS group compared with 4 % in the non-PCOS group (p < 0. 001). On regression analysis, however, the only independent variable which explained both the increased WCC and the increased neutrophil count was PCOS. We found that PCOS is {{associated with an increased}} WCC due to increased neutrophils, which supports the evidence that PCOS is associated with low-grade inflammation. The increase appears to be due to the underlying PCOS, and not to the increased adiposity associated with PCOS...|$|E

A striking finding was the marked neutrophilia in BAL samples from patients with BOS, in the carefully screened absence of infection. A statistically <b>higher</b> <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> was {{also present in}} the sLTR group relative to the normal group. Median BAL neutrophil count in BOS was 100 × 103 /ml, range 13 – 1, 661 103 /ml (p < 0. 001 relative to normal subjects and sLTR). Median BAL neutrophil count in sLTR was 7 × 103 /ml, range 1 – 81 103 /ml (p < 0. 01 relative to normal subjects). Normal subjects had a median BAL neutrophil count of 3 × 103 /ml, range 1 – 7 103 /ml. There was evidence of a predominance of CD 8 lymphocytes in BAL from sLTR and BOS with a lower CD 4 /CD 8 ratio in both compared to normal subjects (p < 0. 05). EBB mononuclear cell counts, class II major histocompatibility complex expression, and T-cell activation markers were normal in BOS, {{in contrast to the}} sLTR group. Our data may be consistent with BOS, representing a relative resolution of an active mononuclear cell chronic inflammation, perhaps at the expense of airway fibrosis.

40|$|Sex {{influences}} the severity {{and evolution of}} various inflammatory conditions. Although many studies have demonstrated the role of sex hormones in immune response modulation, recent clinical data revealed significant sex differences in inflammatory markers in prepubertal children, suggesting a genetic contribution. We studied several immune functions depending on X-linked genes in healthy adults of both sexes: the respiratory burst of purified neutrophils, the CD 99 and CD 11 b expression of stimulated leukocytes as markers of adhesion and diapedesis, {{and the production of}} inflammatory cytokines in whole blood after incubation with lipopolysaccharide for 24 h. The percentage of monocytes expressing CD 99 was higher in men than in women, thus confirming the higher CD 99 expression reported in males using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. In addition, we observed a higher tumor necrosis factor α and tendency toward higher interleukin (IL) 6 production in men after lipopolysaccharide stimulation. These differences may contribute to the higher mortality reported in men with septic shock. Tumor necrosis factor α production significantly correlated with monocyte count, with men having a higher monocyte count than women. When cytokine levels were normalized to monocyte counts, a higher IL- 8 production was found in women, which may explain the <b>higher</b> <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> observed in girls with acute inflammatory diseases, because IL- 8 is a major neutrophil chemoattractant. These sex differences regarding the activation of certain X-linked genes involved in innate immunity confirm our clinical observations, thus supporting the role of sex chromosomes in inflammatory response.

40|$|Background: The {{pathophysiology}} of sepsis is incompletely understood. Impaired bioavailability of L-arginine, {{the substrate}} for NO synthesis, {{is linked to}} sepsis severity, and plasma arginase {{has been linked to}} hypoargininemia in other disease states. Circulating neutrophils are increased in sepsis and constitutively express arginase. We investigated whether plasma arginase activity is increased in human sepsis and whether this is associated with neutrophil numbers and activation. Methods: We used HPLC and a radiometric assay to evaluate plasma amino acid concentrations and plasma arginase activity. The relationships between plasma arginase activity, <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count,</b> <b>neutrophil</b> activity and plasma L-arginine and arginine metabolites were evaluated in 44 sepsis patients and 25 controls. Results: Plasma arginase activity was increased in sepsis patients, correlated with <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> (r= 0. 44; p= 0. 003), but was independent of sepsis severity (SOFA or APACHE II score). Plasma HNP 1 - 3 correlated with <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> (r= 0. 31; p= 0. 04), was elevated in shock (median 180 ng/mL vs. 83 ng/mL sepsis without shock, p= 0. 0006) and correlated with SOFA score. Sepsis patients with <b>high</b> <b>neutrophil</b> <b>counts</b> had significantly <b>higher</b> plasma HNP 1 - 3 and arginase activity and lower plasma L-arginine concentrations than those with lower <b>neutrophil</b> <b>counts</b> and controls.

Objectives We investigated differences in the basic hematological indices in wrestlers compared to sedentary controls. Patients and Methods The blood samples containing anticoagulant were collected from 12 male elite wrestlers (age = 24 ± 1. 2 years, weight = 76 ± 5 Kg) {{with a history of}} more than 9. 5 years of experience and from 13 apparently healthy male silent controls (age = 24 ± 0. 8 years, weight = 85 ± 4 Kg). All the participants were at rest for 24 hours during the blood collection. Red blood cell (RBC) count, hemoglobin (Hb) concentration, packed cell volume (PCV), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular Hb concentration (MCHC), total and differential white blood cell (WBC) counts, and platelet count were analyzed using an automated hematology analyzer. Results Concentration of Hb (154 ± 2 g/L), PCV (45. 3 ± 0. 6 %), and lymphocyte percent (22. 6 ± 3 %) were lower in wrestlers than in the controls (Hb: 165 ± 3 g/L, PCV: 48. 6 ± 0. 8 %, and lymphocyte: 33. 2 ± 2 %). However, <b>higher</b> <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> (68. 7 ± 3 %) was seen in the athletes than in the controls (60. 6 ± 2 %). The other indices showed no differences between the two groups.

ObjectiveTo evaluate the safety and feasibility of sputum induction in ILD and to compare sputum cellular profiles with paired bronchoalveolar lavage fluid results. Materials and methodsTwenty patients underwent sputum induction with 4. 5 % saline within 2 weeks of bronchoalveolar lavage. Total, differential cell counts and cellular viability were assessed. Wilcoxon test and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient were used and a p< 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. ResultsFrom a total of 20 subjects (mean age 49. 4 ± 16. 4 years, 70 % male) a satisfactory sputum sample was obtained in 15 subjects (75 %). Induction was stopped in one subject, due to {{a significant decrease in}} PEF. The cell profiles for induced sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were different (p< 0. 05), except for eosinophils, and there were no significant correlations between the two methods. Compared to sputum reference values there was an increase of lymphocytes (3. 2 % vs 0. 5 %) and eosinophils (1. 4 % vs 0. 0 %). Comparing sarcoidosis and hypersensitivity pneumonitis sputum, both diseases had an increase in lymphocytes (4. 4 vs 3. 9 %), with a significant <b>higher</b> <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> in hypersensitivity pneumonitis (65. 4 % vs 10. 6 % p< 0. 05), a finding also seen in BALF.

This study examined if the morphology of femoral plaques was related to that of carotid plaques. MethodsThe echogenicity of femoral and carotid plaques of 102 patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) was studied and classified as echolucent or echorich according to the gray-scale median (GSM) value, which was 53. 6 for femoral plaques and 55. 2 for carotid plaques. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and neutrophil count were also measured. ResultsEcholucent carotid plaques were more frequent in patients with echolucent than in those with echorich femoral plaques (55. 8 % vs 32. 0 %; P <. 01). At multivariate analysis, femoral GSM lower than the median was the only significant predictor of echolucent carotid plaques (odds ratio [OR], 3. 87; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 53 - 9. 83). Patients with echolucent femoral plaques had higher serum CRP levels (P <. 01) and a <b>higher</b> <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> (P =. 029) than patients with echorich femoral plaques. However, univariate analysis showed that neutrophil count (OR, 3. 48; 95 % CI, 1. 23 - 9. 85) but not hs-CRP was associated with echolucent carotid plaques. At multivariate analysis, neutrophil count exceeding the median remained associated with echolucent carotid plaques (OR, 5. 71; 95 % CI, 1. 37 - 23. 85), whereas the association between femoral and carotid echolucency was attenuated (OR, 3. 75; 95 % CI, 0. 98 - 4. 43). ConclusionsIn PAD, the presence of echolucent femoral plaques {{is associated with a}} greater prevalence of echolucent carotid plaques, probably as a consequence of a more pronounced inflammatory profile. This confirms and extends the finding that plaque echolucency is a multivessel phenomenon. Prospective studies are needed to assess whether carotid screening in PAD patients might contribute to improving clinical decision-making...|$|E

Asymptomatic cerebral microembolization can be detected by transcranial Doppler (TCD) and has been associated with increased risk of early stroke recurrence in patients with recently symptomatic carotid stenosis. In the present study, we sought to determine whether spontaneous microembolization was associated with <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> in patients with recently symptomatic carotid stenosis. METHODS: We continuously monitored Transcranial Doppler (TCD) spectra of middle cerebral artery blood flow ipsilateral to recently symptomatic carotid artery stenosis in 60 consecutive patients. Microembolic signals (MES) were diagnosed by experienced observers blinded to leukocyte count and high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) level measurement. RESULTS: We found MES in 20 (33. 3 %) patients. Microembolization was associated with <b>higher</b> <b>neutrophil</b> <b>counts</b> (p= 0. 003).

40|$|Meningitis is {{referred}} to as an inflammatory process of the leptomeninges and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the sub-arachnoid space of the brain. We have investigated glucose status in CSF in different types of meningitis together with detailed medical history in children. In addition, we have also carried out the detailed cytological and microbiological examinations. A total of 40 subjects were investigated. We observed that the glucose level was significantly decreased (< 20 mg/dl) in 65 %, moderately decreased (20 - 40 mg/dl) in 20 % and mildly decreased (40 - 50 mg/dl) in 15 % of the patients in our study. Patients with Pyogenic meningitis had tremendously reduced glucose level (9. 0 mg/dl) in their CSF whereas in viral meningitis the CSF glucose level is highly variable (10 to 65 mg/dl). Furthermore, 5 (12. 5 %) patients showed high lymphocyte counts and 34 (85 %) patients showed <b>high</b> <b>neutrophil</b> <b>counts.</b> Interestingly, in Pyogenic meningitis, the <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> was very <b>high</b> compared to that in viral meningitis.

40|$|Dysferlinopathies include Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy type 2 B and Miyoshi Myopathy, which exhibit an {{autosomal}} recessive inheritance {{pattern of the}} dysferlin gene and characteristic inflammatory infiltrate in muscle. A study of prospective treatment options was conducted on SJL/J mice, a natural model for dysferlinopathy. The animals are immunocompetent but have elevated levels of circulating T-cells. A baseline termination of SJL/J mice was made at 14 weeks, and differential leukocyte counts determined for these animals through microscopy. After administration of resveratrol and Coenzyme Q 10 exclusively and in combination to the four treatment groups for approximately three months, the remaining six groups (negative and positive controls as well as four treatment groups) were terminated and differential leukocyte counts once again determined. Eosinophil counts were significantly higher in the baseline termination group than all other experimental groups assessed except for the negative control SWR/J mice, possessing normal muscle and used in research as a general purpose strain. Eosinophil granules are suggested to reduce inflammation caused by other leukocytes. At onset of dysferlinopathy between four and six weeks of age, the increase in eosinophil counts could very likely be a compensation mechanism to decrease initial inflammation in the muscular tissues of the dysferlinopathic mice. Neutrophil counts of the baseline termination group were significantly higher only {{when compared to the}} resveratrol/Coenzyme Q 10 combination group. Neutrophils are linked to early inflammatory responses and often sensitised in self-antigen recognition characteristic of autoimmune disease, a known complication in the SJL strain. Thus the <b>higher</b> <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> in the six week old mice is probably related to inflammation at disease onset, but may also be indicative of autoimmunity; whereas the eosinophil counts may possibly play a more definitive role in the pathogenesis of dysferlinopathy.

40|$|Introduction: Leukocytosis, {{predominantly}} neutrophilia, {{has previously}} been described following ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The exact contribution of this phenomenon to the clinical outcome of STEMI {{is yet to be}} shown. We examined cellular inflammatory response to STEMI in the blood and its association with in-hospital mortality and/or adverse clinical events. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 404 patients who were admitted with the diagnosis of acute STEMI at Madani Heart Hospital from March 2010 to March 2012 were studied. The complete blood cell count (CBC) was obtained from all patientswithin 12 - 24 hours of the onset of symptoms. Total leukocytes were counted and differential count was obtained for neutrophils, lymphocytes and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were evaluated. Association of cellular response with the incidence of post-MI mortality/complications was assessed by multiple logistic regression analyses. Results: In-hospital mortality and post-STEMI complication rate were 3. 7 % and 43. 6 %, respectively. Higher age (P= 0. 04), female gender (0. 002), lower ejection fraction (P< 0. 001) and absolute neutrophil count (P= 0. 04) were predictors of mortality. Pump failure in the form of acute pulmonary edema or cardiogenic shock occurred in 35 (8. 9 %) of patients. Higher leukocyte (P< 0. 03) and neutrophil counts (P< 0. 03) and higher NLR (P= 0. 01) were predictors of failure. The frequency of ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VT/VF) at the first day was associated with <b>higher</b> <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> (P< 0. 001) and higher NLR level (P< 0. 001). In multivariate analysis neutrophil count was an independent predictor of mortality (OR= 2. 94; 1. 1 - 8. 4, P= 0. 04), and neutrophil count [OR= 1. 1, CI (1. 01 - 1. 20), P= 0. 02], female gender [OR= 2. 34, CI (1. 02 - 4. 88), P= 0. 04] and diabetes [OR= 2. 52, CI (1. 21 - 5. 2), P= 0. 003] were independent predictors of heart failure. Conclusion: A single CBC analysis may help to identify STEMI patients at risk for mortality and heart failure, and total neutrophil count is the most valuable in predicting both...|$|E
40|$|Background: This study {{investigated}} whether {{the time from}} emergency room registration to appendectomy (ETA) would affect the incidence of perforation and postoperative complications in patients with acute appendicitis. Methods: Patients who underwent an appendectomy at the Ren-Ai branch of Taipei City Hospital between January 2010 and October 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. Their demographics, white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, body temperature, computed tomography scan usage, operation method, pathology report, postoperative complication, length of hospital stay, and ETA were abstracted. Multivariate analysis was performed to search the predictors, including ETA, of outcomes for the perforation and postoperative complication rates. Results: A total of 236 patients {{were included in the}} study. Perforation occurred in 12. 7 % (30 / 236) and postoperative complications developed in 24. 1 % (57 / 236) of these patients. There were 121 patients with ETA 24 hours; patients with ETA > 24 hours had significantly longer hospital stay. Univariate analysis showed that perforated patients were significantly older, and had higher C-reactive protein level, longer hospital stay, and higher complication rate. Patients who developed postoperative complications were significantly older, and had <b>higher</b> <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count,</b> less use of computed tomography, and higher open appendectomy rate. After multivariate analysis, age ≥ 55  years was the only predictor for perforation [odds ratio (OR)  =  3. 65; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1. 54 – 8. 68]; for postoperative complications, age ≥ 55  years (OR =  1. 65; 95 % CI, 1. 84 – 3. 25), perforated appendicitis (OR =  3. 17; 95 % CI, 1. 28 – 7. 85), and open appendectomy (OR =  3. 21; 95 % CI, 1. 36 – 7. 58) were associated. ETA was not a significant predictor in both analyses. Conclusion: In our study, it was observed that although longer ETA was associated with longer hospitalization, ETA was not correlated with postoperative complications. Our results inclined toward the position that appendectomy can be performed as a semielective surgery...|$|E
40|$|A {{clinical}} prediction {{rule for}} diagnosing {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} {{in the emergency}} department Key Messages 1. Several features increased the likelihood of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) : previous contact with a patient with SARS, fever, myalgia (muscle aches), malaise (feeling unwell), abnormal chest radiograph, and abnormal lymphocyte and low platelet counts. Age older than 65 years or younger than 1 years, sputum production, abdominal pain, sore throat, runny nose, and <b>high</b> <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> decreased the likelihood of SARS. 2. We derived a risk index that used data easily obtained in emergency departments, and identified patients with low and high likelihood of SARS during an outbreak. 3. Study data were obtained by reviewing medical records. Some patients may have had symptoms and findings that were not recorded in the records. Characteristics that identify patients with a high likelihood of SARS may differ in settings that are not large outbreaks. Hong Kong Med J 2008; 14 (Suppl 5) :S 8 - 1...|$|R
30|$|In cancer {{patients}} lymphopenia is the surrogate of an impaired cell-mediate immunity, while neutrophilia is acknowledged {{as a response}} to systematic inflammation (Grivennikov et al. 2010). Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is suggested as a marker for general immune response to various stress stimuli. NLR was described to be correlated with the severity of clinical progress in severely ill patients {{in the intensive care unit}} (Zahorec 2001); emerging evidences have shown that NLR has a prognostic value in patients with solid tumors (McMillan 2009); pretreatment <b>high</b> <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> has been reported as a poor prognostic factor for survival in patients with renal cell carcinoma (Négrier et al. 2002), metastatic melanoma (Schmidt et al. 2005), and advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (Teramukai et al. 2009); in addition to be a prognostic score in patients with cancer (Proctor et al. 2011; Wei et al. 2014; Rossi et al. 2015; Pinato et al. 2012), NLR was found to be an helpful tool in the prediction of response to treatment (Edge et al. 2010).|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Severe asthma is a {{heterogeneous}} {{disease and the}} relationship between airway inflammation and airway remodelling is poorly understood. We sought to define sputum mediator profiles in severe asthmatics categorised by CT-determined airway geometry and sputum differential cell counts. Methods In a single centre cross-sectional observational study we recruited 59 subjects with severe asthma that underwent sputum induction and thoracic CT. Quantitative CT analysis of the apical segment of the right upper lobe (RB 1) was performed. Forty-one mediators in sputum samples were measured of which 21 mediators that were assessable in > 50 % of samples were included in the analyses. Results Independent of airway geometry, sputum MMP 9 and IL- 1 β were elevated in those groups with a <b>high</b> sputum <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> while sputum ICAM was elevated in those subjects with a low sputum <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count.</b> In contrast, sputum CCL 11, IL- 1 α and fibrinogen were different in groups stratified by both sputum <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> and airway geometry. Sputum CCL 11 concentration was elevated in subjects with a low sputum <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> and <b>high</b> luminal and total RB 1 area, whereas sputum IL 1 α was increased in subjects with a <b>high</b> sputum <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> and low total RB 1 area. Sputum fibrinogen was elevated in those subjects with RB 1 luminal narrowing and in those subjects with neutrophilic inflammation without luminal narrowing. Conclusions We have demonstrated that sputum mediator profiling reveals a number of associations with airway geometry. Whether these findings reflect important biological phenotypes that might inform stratified medicine approaches requires further investigation. </p...|$|R
40|$|Dengue fever {{is gaining}} {{importance}} in Singapore {{with an increase}} in the number of cases and mortality in recent years. Although prolonged and saddleback fever have been reported in dengue fever, there are no specific studies on their significance in dengue. This study aims to examine the prevalence of prolonged and saddleback fever in dengue as well as their associations with dengue severity. A total of 2843 polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) confirmed dengue patients admitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital from 2004 to 2008 were included in the study. Sixty-nine percent of them were male with a median age of 34 years. Prolonged fever (fever > 7 days duration) was present in 572 (20. 1 %) of patients. Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), dengue shock syndrome (DSS) and severe dengue (SD) were significantly more likely to occur in patients with prolonged fever. Mucosal bleeding, anorexia, diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting, lethargy, rash, clinical fluid accumulation, hepatomegaly, nosocomial infection, leukopenia, <b>higher</b> <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count,</b> higher hematocrit, higher alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST), higher creatinine, lower protein and prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) were significantly associated with prolonged fever but not platelet count or prothrombin time (PT). Saddleback fever was present in 165 (5. 8 %). Although DHF and SD were more likely to occur in patients in those with saddleback fever, DSS was not. Compared with prolonged fever, saddleback fever did not show many significant associations except for diarrhea, abdominal pain, clinical fluid accumulation, hematocrit and platelet change, and lower systolic blood pressure. This study demonstrates that prolonged fever may be associated with various warning signs and more severe forms of dengue (SD, DSS, DHF), while saddleback fever showed associations with DHF and SD but not DSS. The presence of prolonged or saddleback fever in dengue patients should therefore prompt detailed evaluation for complications of dengue, as well as early investigation to evaluate for development of nosocomial infection...|$|E
40|$|Objective. The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the predictive value of <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> for no-reflow in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who underwent successful primary percutaneous intervention (PCI). Methods. We conducted a retrospective study of 361 patients diagnosed with acute STEMI between 2011 and 2015. All patients underwent successful PCI within 12 [*]h from the onset of symptoms. Angiographic no-reflow was diagnosed based on a post-PCI thrombolysis in myocardial infarction flow grade[*]≤[*] 2 without mechanical obstruction. According to a <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> cut-off determined by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, patients were divided into two groups: group A (neutrophil count[*]<[*] 9. 14 [*]×[*] 109 /L) and group B (neutrophil count[*]≥[*] 9. 14 [*]×[*] 109 /L). Results. Compared to patients in the normal reflow group, patients with no-reflow had <b>higher</b> <b>neutrophil</b> <b>counts</b> (P< 0. 05). The incidence rate of no-reflow in group A (18, 9. 3 %) was significantly lower than that in group B (38). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that a neutrophil count[*]≥[*] 9. 14 [*]×[*] 109 /L was independently predictive for no-reflow (odds ratio[*]=[*] 4. 474, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 610 – 12. 433, P= 0. 004) after adjusting for potential confounders.

The {{aim of this}} study was to research the proportions of patients treated with first- to third-line chemotherapy and to find influential factors for the introduction of chemotherapy and survival benefit from chemotherapy. Materials and methods: Data were collected retrospectively on patients who met the following criteria: adenocarcinoma, diagnosed between June 2007 and March 2015 at our hospital, stage IIIB or IV, and EGFR wild type. A nonchemotherapy group of patients who did not receive chemotherapy was compared with a chemotherapy group of patients who received it. The patients who had received first- to third-line chemotherapy between June 2007 and November 2015 at our hospital were also analyzed. Results: During the study period, 46 patients did not receive chemotherapy, while 148, 89, and 48 received first-, second- and third-line chemotherapy, respectively. As predictive factors for unlikely chemotherapy, multivariate logistic analysis detected Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) ≥ 2, hemoglobin < 13. 2 g/dL, creatinine clearance (Ccr) < 50. 4 mL/min, and CRP ≥ 0. 53 mg/dL. As factors predicting shorter survival after chemotherapy, multivariate Cox proportional-hazard analyses detected age ≥ 75 years, ECOG PS ≥ 2, lower lymphocyte counts, and higher CRP for the first line; female, <b>higher</b> <b>neutrophil</b> <b>counts,</b> lower lymphocyte counts, reduced Ccr, hyponatremia, and shorter interval between first- and second-line chemotherapy for the second line; and age ≥ 75 years, body mass index < 18. 5 kg/m 2, <b>higher</b> <b>neutrophil</b> <b>counts,</b> lower lymphocyte counts, hyponatremia, higher lactate dehydrogenase, and higher CRP for the third line. Conclusion: Approximately 76 % of patients were treated with first-line chemotherapy. Of those patients, 61 % and 34 % proceeded to second- and third-line chemotherapy, respectively. For patients with poor PS, anemia, reduced Ccr, and higher CRP, it is difficult to introduce chemotherapy.

30|$|The {{preoperative}} immunophenotype of RCC {{patients with}} ‘early’ (<pT 3) and advanced (≥pT 3) stage tumors {{were compared to}} investigate tumor stage-dependent alterations (Table  1). The[*]≥[*]pT 3 group had higher {{white blood cell counts}} due to an increased number of granulocytes. Leukocyte numbers correlated with tumor stages (p[*]=[*] 0.031). The number of monocytes and lymphocytes were higher in the advanced group (though not significantly), whereas DC counts were lower. Patients with tumor stages[*]<[*]pT 3 possessed 10.9 cells/μl MDC 1 and 5.11 cells/μl PDC, while 7.8 cells/μl MDC 1 and 4.51 cells/μl PDC were present in the advanced RCC stages[*]≥[*]pT 3.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{study the}} epidemiologic, clinical, laboratory, and radiologic features, {{prognostic}} indicators, and short-term to medium-term outcomes {{for children with}} {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} (SARS) and to validate the performance characteristics of a clinical case definition, calculated with respect to SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) seroconversion. METHODS: Children 12 years was associated with methylprednisolone therapy for severe illness. After exclusion of the only infant, an age of > 12 years was associated with oxygen requirements. Sore throat, <b>high</b> <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> at presentation, and peak neutrophilia were independent factors predicting severe illness. The clinical case definition demonstrated good sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (97. 8 %, 92. 7 %, 88 %, and 98. 7 %, respectively) for diagnostic accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Children are susceptible to SARS-CoV infection. Teenagers resemble adults with respect to disease progression and may develop severe illness. The short-term to medium-term outcomes are good. Sore throat and initial and peak neutrophilia seem to be predictors of severe illness. Our clinical case definition performed well in the epidemic. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Low {{serum albumin}} is {{predictive}} of poor survival in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). We evaluated {{the ability of}} the pretreatment albumin/globulin ratio (AGR) to predict long-term mortality in patients with NPC. METHODS: This retrospective study examined an unselected cohort of 694 patients with NPC who had documented pretreatment total serum protein and serum albumin levels (ALB). AGR was calculated as [AGR = ALB/(total serum protein [...] ALB) ]. Survival analysis was used to evaluate the predictive value of AGR. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis demonstrated that a low pretreatment serum AGR (< 1. 4) was an independent predictor of poor OS (P  =  0. 029) and DMFS (P  =  0. 033). A low AGR was significantly associated with advanced stage disease (P< 0. 001), high white blood cell count (P  =  0. 033), <b>high</b> <b>neutrophil</b> <b>count</b> (P  =  0. 047), high total serum protein (P< 0. 001) and low ALB (P< 0. 001).
