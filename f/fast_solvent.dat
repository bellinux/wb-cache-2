40|$|Large scale {{molecular}} dynamics simulations {{are used to}} study the dispersion of nanoparticles (NPs) in a polymer film during solvent evaporation. As the solvent evaporates, a dense polymer-rich skin layer forms at the liquid/vapor interface, which is either NP rich or poor depending {{on the strength of}} the NP/polymer interaction.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{establish}} the diltiazem hydrochloride release mechanism from the chitosan-alginate matrix tablet (MCB/AS) and chitosan-carrageenan matrix tablet (MCS/CSI). The weight loss for MCS/CSI is mainly due to the weight loss of the matrix while for MCB/AS it is mainly due to the diltiazem hydrochloride released from the tablet. Using the Peppa's model the release order for MCS/CSI was n = 1. 07 +/- 0. 13 and for MCB/AS was n = 0. 76 +/- 0. 02. Thus, MCS/CSI has a transport mechanism, and for MCB/AS the drug release mechanism is a combined process of diffusion and relaxation. MCB/AS has an elastic modulus (G' = 10 (5) Pa) one order of magnitude higher than MCS/CSI (G' = 10 (4) Pa).

The solute molecule was vibrationally excited by the photo-excitation of the auzlenyl group to the S 1 state through the fast internal conversion, and the rate of solvent thermalization due to the vibrational energy relaxation was determined. The thermalization rates for 1 -alkylazulenes and bridged azulene-anthracenes were faster than that of azulene. Based on the results of the thermalization rates of 1 -alkylazulenes, we concluded that the acceleration of the energy dissipation from the azulenyl group induced the faster energy dissipation from the solute to the solvent. The vibrational normal mode analysis suggests that the density of the vibrational modes and anharmonic coupling between the vibrational modes induce the faster intramolecular energy redistribution. In xenon, the solvent thermalization rates were close to the energy dissipation rates of the solute molecule reported using transient absorption spectroscopy. On the other hand, in the chlorofluorocarbon, the ratio of the thermalization rate to the dissipation rate was a dependent of the molecular species, and especially <b>faster</b> <b>solvent</b> thermalization rate of 9 -(6 -(azulen- 1 -yl) hexyl) anthracene was predicted.
