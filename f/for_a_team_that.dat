5|$|Jones {{earned the}} {{role as a}} varsity starter for Apple Valley as an eighth grader for the 200910 season. That year, he {{averaged}} 16.8 points per game and 8.1 assists per game, starting every game <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>that</b> went 208. That season he received his first recruiting letter (at age 13) from USC.|$|E
5|$|After Leafs General Manager Pat Quinn {{was unwilling}} to give Joseph a {{four-year}} contract (he offered three years), he left after the 2001–02 season to sign with the Detroit Red Wings. Some also speculated {{that the relationship between}} Quinn and Joseph was frosty because Quinn had benched Joseph in the Salt Lake City Olympics after the first game, although Joseph himself denied the rumours, saying that he played a bad first game against Sweden (losing 5–2) and that Martin Brodeur played very well {{for the rest of the}} tournament, earning his spot as the starter. Joseph had also hinted at wanting to play <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>that</b> could win it all, implying the Leafs were not such a team. Joseph's move to Detroit was highly publicized and unpopular in Toronto.|$|E

5|$|Before 1902, Manchester United {{were known}} as Newton Heath, during which time they first played their {{football}} matches at North Road and then Bank Street in Clayton. However, both grounds were blighted by wretched conditions, the pitches ranging from gravel to marsh, while Bank Street suffered from clouds of fumes from its neighbouring factories. Therefore, following the club's rescue from near-bankruptcy and renaming, the new chairman John Henry Davies decided in 1909 that the Bank Street ground was not fit <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>that</b> had recently won the First Division and FA Cup, so he donated funds {{for the construction of}} a new stadium. Not one to spend money frivolously, Davies scouted around Manchester for an appropriate site, before settling on a patch of land adjacent to the Bridgewater Canal, just off the north end of the Warwick Road in Old Trafford.|$|E
5|$|In the men's tournament, Fiji secured {{their first}} Olympic medal with {{emphatic}} 43–7 win over Great Britain, as South Africa won bronze with big win over Japan. Having never previously won an Olympic medal of any colour, Fiji won gold at the Deodoro Stadium by demolishing Britain in the final. The opening minute saw Osea Kolinisau left one {{and one with}} Tom Mitchell and although his fellow captain halted his progress, Kolinisau {{was still able to}} stretch and touch the ball down behind his head. Almost straight away, Fiji had a second try. Samisoni Viriviri muscled his way past two players before offloading to Jerry Tuwai to score under the posts. After that Britain were shell shocked and Fiji were in no mood to show any compassion racking up a further five tries. A silver medal is still a considerable achievement <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>that</b> was only formed ten weeks prior the tournament. Aside from the one-sided nature of the final, it still must rank among the most unexpected of British success stories at these Rio Games. Where other teams on the sevens circuit had been preparing two years or longer for the moment when rugby returned to the Olympic fold after a 92-year wait, Team Great Britain coach Amor only got his players {{together for the first time}} on May 30. England, Wales and Scotland all compete as separate nations in the World Sevens Series, where their results veered between the disappointing and disastrous, this season.|$|E
25|$|<b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>that</b> {{is losing}} a game, a fresh striker can bring more benefit in {{circumventing}} an opposed defence line composed of relatively tired players. <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>that</b> is winning a game, a fresh midfielder or a defender can bring more benefit in strengthening the defence against the opposition's attackers (who may be fresh substitutes themselves). In this situation, {{it is usually}} imaginative attacking flair players who are replaced by tough-tackling defensive midfielders or defenders.|$|E

25|$|The {{move was}} {{controversial}} and is frequently maligned by fans and writers {{who thought that}} owner Tom Hicks was placing {{too much emphasis on}} one player instead of utilizing team resources to acquire several players, especially <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>that</b> lacked pitching talent.

25|$|Formations can be {{deceptive}} in analysing <b>a</b> particular <b>team's</b> {{style of}} play. <b>For</b> instance, <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>that</b> plays <b>a</b> nominally attacking 4–3–3 formation can quickly revert to a 4–5–1 if a coach instructs {{two of the}} three forwards to track back in midfield.|$|R
25|$|In {{the match}} between Eighteen of Victoria and the All-England Eleven led by H. H.

25|$|Brown's time at UNC {{also saw}} renewed {{popularity}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>that</b> had long {{played in the}} shadow of the school's powerhouse basketball team. Games at Kenan Memorial Stadium were almost always sold out, the highlight being a standing-room only crowd of 62,000 that watched the Tar Heels play Florida State in 1997, still the largest crowd to watch a college football game on campus in the state of North Carolina. Brown also spearheaded a major renovation to Kenan Stadium that featured upgraded team facilities and an expansion to 60,000 seats.|$|E
25|$|This success, however, was short-lived. Despite {{a strong}} regular season showing {{that left the}} Stingrays tied with the South Division (and American Conference) leader Charlotte Checkers and North Division leader Kalamazoo Wings, the team ended up fourth seed in the 2010 Kelly Cup playoffs, falling three games to two {{in the first round}} to the {{eventual}} champions, the Cincinnati Cyclones. <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>that</b> was the first in the ECHL to reach 30 wins that season (in a 53 victory over the Reading Royals in front of a record sellout crowd of 10,570), the first round defeat was disappointing to players and fans alike.|$|E
50|$|In 1977, Ruthven again battled injuries, {{pitching}} in 25 games (23 starts). Even though his ERA didn't change much (rising to 4.23), Ruthven finished with only <b>a</b> 7-13 record <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Braves <b>team</b> <b>that</b> lost 101 games.|$|R

25|$|McAllister's {{performances}} in the cup {{caught the eye of}} Leicester City manager Gordon Milne. He signed for the English club, along with Motherwell teammate Ally Mauchlen, for a combined fee of £350,000 in August 1985. Although Mauchlen's greater experience cast McAllister as the 'make-weight' in the deal, he soon rose to prominence as an attacking force in Leicester midfield, impressing manager and fans alike with his accurate passing to feet, and confident range of skills on the ball. During his first season at Filbert Street he adapted well to regular First Division football, and began to rise to prominence in creating chances <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>that</b> included Steve Lynex and Alan Smith.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the 2001 season, star {{free agent}} shortstop Alex Rodriguez, {{was signed by}} the Rangers in the most lucrative deal in {{baseball}} history: a 10-year, $252 million contract. The move was considered controversial and was frequently maligned by fans and writers who thought that owner Tom Hicks was placing {{too much emphasis on}} one player instead of utilizing team resources to acquire several players, especially <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>that</b> lacked pitching talent. Club officials maintained that Rodriguez would be the cornerstone of future postseason success. Although Rodriguez's individual performance was outstanding, the Rangers continued to struggle and manager Jerry Narron was fired following the 2002 season. He was replaced by seasoned manager Buck Showalter.|$|E
25|$|The Astros {{were playing}} great {{baseball}} throughout the season. José Cruz and Enos Cabell both stole 30 bases. Joe Niekro {{had a great}} year with 21 wins and 3.00 ERA. J. R. Richard won 18 games and set a new personal strikeout record at 313. Joe Sambito came into his own with 22 saves as the Astros closer. Things were going as they should <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>that</b> could win the west. The Astros and Reds battled the final month of the season. The Reds pulled ahead of the Astros by a game and a half. Later that month they split a pair and the Reds kept the lead. That would be how it would end. The Astros finished with their best record to that point at 89–73 and 1½ games behind the NL winner Reds.|$|E

25|$|In 1952, Rogers Hornsby, {{an alleged}} {{former member of}} the Ku Klux Klan, took over as manager of the Browns. Despite past accusations of racism, Hornsby was less {{hesitant}} to use Paige than Boudreau was four years before. Paige was so effective that when Hornsby was fired by Veeck, his successor Marty Marion seemed not to want to risk going more than three games without using Paige in some form. By July 4, with Paige having worked in 25 games, Casey Stengel named him to the American League All-Star team, making him the first black pitcher on an AL All-Star team. The All-Star game was cut short after five innings due to rain and Paige never got in. Stengel resolved to name him to the team the following year. Paige finished the year 12–10 with a 3.07 ERA <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>that</b> lost ninety games.|$|E
25|$|Shafer {{was hired}} by Syracuse University head {{football}} coach Doug Marrone in 2009. He was hired as the defensive coordinator <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>that</b> allowed 32.7 points per game in the 2008 season. The defense went from being 101st {{in the country to}} the top 20 under Shafer. Under Shafer, Syracuse's defense ranked 7th in the nation in 2010 in total defense (from 37th), 12th in the nation in first downs allowed (from 27th), 10th in pass defense (from 85th), 14th in pass efficiency defense (from (113th), and 13th in scoring defense (from 81st). While at Syracuse, he coached 2012 1st round draft pick Chandler Jones, who was the highest draft pick from Syracuse since Dwight Freeney in 2002. Shafer was officially named the head coach of the Orange on January 9, 2013 after Doug Marrone left to become the head coach of the Buffalo Bills.|$|E
25|$|Bobby Valentine — in 1995, {{the former}} Texas Rangers manager {{took over as}} manager of the Chiba Lotte Marines. That season, the team {{surprised}} most Japanese baseball fans by finishing in second place (69–58–3), a remarkable feat <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>that</b> had not won the Japanese Pacific league pennant since 1974. However, Valentine was fired abruptly due to the personal conflict with general manager Tatsuro Hirooka, despite having a two-year contract. In 2004, Valentine began his second stint as manager of the Chiba Lotte Marines. In 2005, he led the Marines to their first Pacific League pennant in 31 years and a four-game sweep of the Hanshin Tigers in the Japan Series. In 2008, Valentine {{was the subject of}} the ESPN Films documentary The Zen of Bobby V. The film followed Valentine and his 2007 Chiba Lotte Marines team. The Zen of Bobby V. was an official selection at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival. The Marines decided to let Valentine go after the 2009 season after an extensive smear campaign led by club president Ryuzo Setoyama, which ironically backfired and resulted in an overflow of support for Valentine by local fans. In the end, Valentine was fired, even though a petition to extend his contract was presented to the organization with 112,000 signatures.|$|E
