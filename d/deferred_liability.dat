40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{importance}} of deferred tax assets and liabilities for a sample of large U. S. corporations between 1993 and 2004 and documents substantial heterogeneity in the deferred tax positions of different firms. In 2004, 25 firms {{in a sample of}} 73 reported net deferred tax assets and 48 reported net <b>deferred</b> tax <b>liabilities.</b> Firms differ substantially in the composition of their deferred tax assets and liabilities. The largest components of deferred tax assets for sample firms are Loss and Credit Carryforwards and Employment and Post-employment Benefits. The largest components of <b>deferred</b> tax <b>liabilities</b> are Property, Plant & Equipment and Leases. Total deferred tax assets for sample firms with net deferred tax assets in 2004 were $ 61. 9 billion, while total <b>deferred</b> tax <b>liabilities</b> for sample firms with net <b>deferred</b> tax <b>liabilities</b> were $ 223. 8 billion. A five percentage point decline in the federal statutory corporate tax rate could reduce net income at sample firms with net deferred tax assets by as much as $ 8. 8 billion, since a statutory rate cut would reduce the value of deferred tax assets and this change would be reflected on the income statement. We use data on the sales, market value, and assets of sample firms, relative to aggregate data for the U.

Selection of these companies is because fixed assets revaluation is one of the components of deferred taxes. Fixed Assets Revaluation will cause deferred tax asset or liability depend on the comparison of the company recorded value and the market value. When the company recorded value is larger than the market value of assets would cause <b>deferred</b> tax <b>liability,</b> and in contrast if the company recorded value is lower than the market value of assets would cause deferred tax asset. 120 firms are the total sample of this study. This study uses Feltham & Ohlson’s price model in order to regress the value relevance of the sample. Dependent variable that used in this study is closed price per share. Independent variables that used in this study are deferred tax assets and liabilities and other components of deferred taxes (net deferred taxes, net deferred tax assets, net <b>deferred</b> tax <b>liabilities,</b> and net <b>deferred</b> tax based on quintile distribution).
