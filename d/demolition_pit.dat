25|$|In August 1963, Lair {{received}} {{an order to}} cut Route 7 between the Plain of Jars and the Vietnamese border. After Lair's training, PARU troopers, accompanying and directing 12 platoons of Hmong from their Special Guerrilla Units, infiltrated to a portion of Route 7 that ran along steep cliffs. The saboteurs planted double cratering charges in each of 120 <b>demolition</b> <b>pits</b> they dug, and exfiltrated. When the explosions blew {{in the middle of}} the night, two sections of clifftop road migrated downwards. Once again, Lair let Pop Buell claim credit. The Route 7 communist supply line would remain cut until November.|$|R
50|$|Dirt tracks {{tend to be}} {{somewhat}} more makeshift and more versatile than asphalt pavements, and can be converted for use in other motorsports. For instance, Little Valley Speedway in Little Valley, New York is a half-mile dirt track that can be converted into a figure-8 track, a <b>demolition</b> derby <b>pit,</b> or a tractor pull straightaway.|$|R
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the sampling activities undertaken and the analytical results obtained in a soil sampling and analyses study performed for the 218 E- 8 Borrow <b>Pit</b> <b>Demolition</b> Site (218 E- 8 Demolition Site). The 218 E- 8 Demolition Site {{is identified as}} a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) treatment unit that will be closed {{in accordance with the}} applicable laws and regulations. The site was used for the thermal treatment of discarded explosive chemical products. No constituents of concern were found in concentrations indicating contamination of the soil by 218 E- 8 Demolition Site activities...|$|R
5|$|The brigade {{was again}} ordered into active duty {{to play a}} {{supporting}} role in the Gulf War in 1990. It officially switched to active service on 6 December 1990 at Brooklyn, New York. It participated in Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm and earned two campaign streamers {{for participation in the}} conflict. On 11 March 1991 it was released from active military service and reverted to reserve status. The next day, while still in the country, the brigade was one of numerous units thought to have been exposed to chemical agents released during the Khamisiyah <b>Pit</b> <b>demolition.</b> Much of the NATO invasion force in the country at the time is suspected to have been exposed to these agents.|$|R
5000|$|In 1994, British Coal {{sponsored}} Arnfield’s exhibition A Tribute to Coal Mining in Nottinghamshire at Nottingham University's Djanogly Art Gallery. She {{then held}} a further 20 exhibitions of her mining art {{under the title}} [...] "Images of Coal" [...] at museums and art galleries across the UK. In her mining paintings, Marjorie Arnfield focused on historical mining methods, social aspects of mining communities, and the <b>demolition</b> of the <b>pits.</b> Her mining paintings were purchased by private collections, museums and art galleries. Opening an exhibition of Arnfield's coal mining art at Woodhorn Colliery Museum, journalist Kate Adie said [...] "It is only through Marjorie's images that young people of future generations will learn about this once-great industry coal-mining." ...|$|R
2500|$|In September 1997, {{the celebrity}} {{steeplejack}} Fred Dibnah {{was hired by}} Safeway supermarkets to demolish the unused [...] concrete chimney {{that was part of}} the abandoned oil refinery. Safeway had planned for the 2,500-ton chimney to be demolished on 18 September in front of a large crowd of invited guests. This would have been the first time Fred Dibnah's <b>demolition</b> technique of <b>pit</b> props and fire (without explosives) had been attempted on a concrete chimney and it was also the tallest chimney he had ever attempted to fell. However the chimney unexpectedly collapsed the previous day whilst Fred and his team were making the final preparations for the controlled demolition, fortunately without injury. The incident is described in detail in various biographies and by Fred himself in his public speaking events afterwards. Fred Dibnah later presented Safeway head office staff with brass paper weights (made from material salvaged from the chimney) stamped [...] "The Great Canvey Island Chimney Disaster 1997".|$|R
5000|$|Eudo endowed {{the town}} with several {{religious}} institutions. The foremost of these was St. John's Abbey (built 1095-1116), built close {{to the site of}} the Saxon church of St John the Evangelist, discovered during the creation of St Botolph’s Roundabout. Stephan, Abbot of York, sent 13 monks to Essex to inhabit the Abbey, with Pope Paschal II granting a petition to make their leader Hugh the first Abbot of the Abbey in 1104. The Abbot of Colchester had a seat in the House of Lords. Also in 1104 the Abbey was granted the right to hold a fair on St John’s Green outside of the Abbey grounds. Upon Eudo’s death in 1120 on his estate at Préaux in Normandy his remains were brought to England to be interred at the Abbey on 28 February 1120. The Abbey underwent reconstruction in 1133 after a large fire which had consumed part of the town affected the building. A large precinct wall was constructed around the Abbey in the 12th century, some of which still stands along the north end of Mersea Road despite a 140m stretch of it being pulled down in the 1970s for the creation of a roundabout. As a Benedictine monastery lay folk were not permitted within the Abbey, and so the parish church of St Giles was built on the edge of the Abbey’s precinct to serve them in 1171. Although the church still stands as the Colchester Masonic Centre, large portions of the associated graveyard and earlier Roman features were removed and destroyed by building contractors with little archaeological investigation during the creation of a car park in the 1970s and 1980s. Eudo also founded the Hospital of St Mary Magdalen in 1100. This was built in the North-West corner of the junction between what is now Magdalen Street and Brook Street, deliberately placing it outside of the walled town to keep the leper patients away from the healthy population. This hospital was controlled by St John’s Abbey, who paid for the upkeep of its inmates with an annual sum of £6 from the Abbey’s estate in Brightlingsea. As the hospital had its own monks and officials the Abbey’s level of control became a matter of dispute during the latter Middle Ages. [...] In 1189 the monks at the hospital were granted the right to hold their own fair. Eudo is also supposed to have rebuilt the Saxon Chapel of St Helena, which was built into the remains of the Roman Theatre on Maidenburgh Street, and to have improved the port at the Hythe. [...] Unrelated to Eudo, but contemporary with him, was the construction of the first Augustinian monastery in Britain at St Botolph's Priory outside of South Gate close to the Abbey. The Priory was originally the site of a Saxon church in honour of St Botolph which housed some of his relics, and also Saint Denis. Pope Pascal II granted a priest called Ainulf, the leader of a group of priests at the church who had all studied the Austin rites in France, the rite to found the Priory, which in August 1116 was granted control over all of the Augustinian monasteries in England. The Priory was granted the right to hold a fair on the feast day of St Denis (9 October). However, despite the Priories eminent position it was relatively poor in comparison to the Abbey of St John. Secular buildings in the Norman town included the Moot Hall which was significantly rebuilt in 1160, which was unusual in its appearance for non-religious structures of the period due to the extravagant nature of its decorations, making it perhaps the most decorated secular building in the country in the 11th century. These included a carved stone door and carved windows created by the same mason who worked on Rochester Cathedral and Dover Priory, featuring carvings of King Solomon and The Queen of Sheba (emblematic of the wise judgements of the courts held in the Hall). Other secular buildings made from Roman rubble include the numerous Stone houses built around the town. Many of these 11th-century dwellings were demolished in the 1970s, including one on Lion Walk and one behind what is now the JobCentre. Numerous robber trenches and <b>demolition</b> <b>pits</b> from this period have been found around the town from which the Roman building material for these structures was mined, as well as large complexes of lime kilns built from Roman tiles for baking oyster shells to obtain lime for mortar.|$|R
