5|$|To {{increase}} their incomes, many farmers have diversified; {{the average income}} from non-farming business activities on farms in Wales in 2013/2014 was £4,900. Tourism-related activities accounted for much of this; these included bed and breakfast accommodation, self-catering accommodation in redundant outbuildings or purpose-built units, bunkhouses for walkers and provision of food-related services in cafés, restaurants, farm shops, pick-your-own and farmer's markets. Indoor and outdoor leisure and recreational facilities are provided by some farmers including paint-balling, laser-combat games, pony trekking, mountain biking and many other activities. Caravans, camp sites and parking provide alternative uses for land, and wind turbines can provide <b>extra</b> <b>income</b> from land still farmed in the normal way.|$|E

The family was forced to live in squalor {{for a number of}} years while Dunstan established his legal practice; during this time, they took in boarders as a source of <b>extra</b> <b>income.</b> Gretel later gave birth to two sons, Andrew and Paul.|$|E

The bank failed in 1923, {{in the aftermath of}} the Depression of 1920–21; Kimball lost his $3000 investments in bank stock and was forced to take a lower-paying job at another bank.

5|$|Olga escaped revolutionary Russia {{with her}} second husband and their two sons in February 1920. They joined her mother, the Dowager Empress, in Denmark. In exile, Olga acted as {{companion}} and secretary to her mother, and was often sought out by Romanov impostors {{who claimed to be}} her dead relatives. She met Anna Anderson, the best-known impostor, in Berlin in 1925. After the Dowager Empress's death in 1928, Olga and her husband purchased a dairy farm in Ballerup, near Copenhagen. She led a simple life: raising her two sons, working on the farm and painting. During her lifetime, she painted over 2,000 works of art, which provided <b>extra</b> <b>income</b> for both her family and the charitable causes she supported.|$|E
5|$|At {{the close}} of the 1991 season, a {{proposal}} was tabled {{for the establishment of a}} new league that would bring more money into the game overall. The Founder Members Agreement, signed on 17 July 1991 by the game's top-flight clubs, established the basic principles for setting up the FA Premier League. The newly formed top division would have commercial independence from The Football Association and the Football League, giving the FA Premier League licence to negotiate its own broadcast and sponsorship agreements. The argument given at the time was that the <b>extra</b> <b>income</b> would allow English clubs to compete with teams across Europe. Although Dyke played a significant role in the creation of the Premier League, Dyke and ITV would lose out in the bidding for broadcast rights as BSkyB won with a bid of £304million over five years with the BBC awarded the highlights package broadcast on Match of the Day.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{shows the}} trading {{of coffee in}} Huehuetla, an {{indigenous}} municipality located in “Sierra Norte” {{in the state of}} “Puebla”. The information was obtained by: 1) Surveys to peasants; 2) Interviews to coffee traders; 3) In-field work; and 4) Secondary information. The results show that peasants have a low school level, with small surface of land and due to conditions of poverty and marginalization are forced to sell their product a lower price than their real value. The majority of the producers sell the coffee to small traders that go to their communities and few of them sell it to some kind of organization, nevertheless due the recurrent crisis in the price of coffee these organizations hardly remain.

5|$|Promotion, and the <b>extra</b> <b>income</b> {{this would}} bring, now became {{a matter of}} {{considerable}} concern to Scott. In the Royal Navy however, opportunities for career advancement were both limited and keenly sought after by ambitious officers. Early in June 1899, while home on leave, {{he had a chance}} encounter in a London street with Clements Markham, who was now knighted and President of the Royal Geographical Society (RGS), and learned for the first time of an impending Antarctic expedition with the Discovery, {{under the auspices of the}} RGS. It was the opportunity for early command and a chance to distinguish himself, rather than any predilection for polar exploration which motivated Scott, according to Crane. What passed between them on this occasion is not recorded, but a few days later, on 11 June, Scott appeared at the Markham residence and volunteered to lead the expedition.|$|E
5|$|The Elementary Education Act 1880 {{insisted on}} {{compulsory}} attendance from 5–10 years. For poorer families, ensuring their children attended school proved difficult, {{as it was}} more tempting to send them working if the opportunity to earn an <b>extra</b> <b>income</b> was available. Attendance Officers often visited the homes of children who failed to attend school, which often proved to be ineffective. Children {{under the age of}} 13 who were employed were required to have a certificate to show they had reached the educational standard; employers of these children who weren't able to show this were penalised. An act brought into force thirteen years later went under the name of the Elementary Education (School Attendance) Act 1893, which stated a raised minimum leaving age to 11. Later the same year, the act was also extended for blind and deaf children, who previously had no means of an official education. This act was later amended in 1899 to raise the school leaving age up to 12 years of age.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to make a diagnostic and characterization of the production and marketing of bovine milk in double purpose production systems, also known as tropical dairy, in the premises of Dobladero in José Azueta Veracruz, Mexico. Thirty Milk producers from the Local Livestock Association (AsociaciÃ³n Ganadera Local) were interviewed from May to July 2010. The results show that the production units are common parcels, with traditional pasturage on rain-fed conditions in a dry tropical weather, and supplementary feeding during dry seasons. A mixture of Zebu and Swiss cattle breeds predominate along with other europeans; the cow milking takes place daily in the morning and manually by the same producer and with the help of their families in most of the cases. Two forms were detected to market fluid milk: 1) Selling it to local cheese producers and 2) Selling it to Nestlé gatherer. It is concluded that tropical dairy in these premises fulfills different functions: a) sources of self-employment and incomes, b) provision of raw materials to the dairy agro-industry, c) generation of <b>extra</b> <b>incomes</b> from selling calves at weaning, d) use of by-products of agriculture and agribusiness in the region and e) development of roots and pride of being a farmer in the zone.
