50|$|Humerus {{fractures}} {{are among}} the most common of fractures. Proximal fractures make up 5% of all fractures and 25% of humerus fractures, middle fractures about 60% of humerus fractures (12% of all fractures), and distal fractures the remainder. Among proximal fractures, 80% are one-part, 10% are two-part, and the remaining 10% are three- and four-part. The most common location of proximal fractures is at the surgical neck of the humerus. Incidence of proximal fractures increases with age, with about 75% of cases occurring among people over the age of 60. In this age group, about three times as many women than men experience a proximal fracture. Middle fractures are also common among the elderly, but they frequently occur among physically active young adult men who experience physical trauma to the humerus. Distal fractures are rare among adults, occurring primarily in children who experience physical trauma to the <b>elbow</b> <b>region.</b>|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} a computational method that detects 'identities' in tRNA genes by using principal component analysis to classify the sequences of bases in tRNA genes into groups of similar sequences and then comparing the distribution of sequences of bases, in order to extract characteristic bases that are conserved within a group but differ between groups. These classification and comparison procedures are applied recursively to classify the sequences into hierarchical groups, so that multiple levels of characteristic sites can be detected. By using this computational method, {{we were able to}} detect many characteristic sites in the T and D domains of tRNAs, as well as the characteristic sites that had already been detected experimentally. This suggests that bases not only in the contact regions but also in the <b>elbow</b> <b>regions,</b> which determine the structure and dynamics of the whole tRNA molecule, are important to the tRNA-aminoacyl tRNA synthetase recognition...|$|R

The macaque monkeys were performing a center-out reaching task (distance to targets was 4 cm, target radius was 0.8 to 1 cm), with her right arm attached to exoskeletal robotic manipulandum (KINARM), corresponding to the initial manual training described in [30]. The animal had been implanted (after reaching task proficiency level of approximately 80 % success) in M 1 and PMd, representing the right shoulder and <b>elbow</b> <b>regions,</b> with multiple 'Utah' microelectrode arrays (10 × 10 electrode grid). The total number of units in the data was 185 and 97 for M 1 and PMd, respectively.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Rock {{climbing}} is {{an extreme}} sport that is fast gaining interest in the Western Cape. Due to the physical nature of the sport, climbers often suffer neuromusculoskeletal (NMS) injuries. Physiotherapists are first-line practitioners who diagnose and treat NMS injuries, but no previous study has been conducted regarding common NMS injuries amongst rock climbers in the Western Cape. OBJECTIVE: To determine the common NMS injuries amongst rock climbers, and the relationships between independent variables and injury. METHOD: A Quantitative, cross-sectional, retrospective descriptive study design utilised a self developed survey based on the literature. This was completed by rock climbers from an indoor climbing gym in Cape Town and two outdoor crags in the Western Cape. Out {{of the total population}} of 650 climbers, 247 were conveniently sampled to complete the self-administered SURVEY, making the results generalisable to the climbing population. RESULTS: Finger flexor tendon pulley injuries were the most commonly diagnosed NMS injury. Injury to the fingers, hand and <b>elbow</b> <b>regions</b> were the most common self-reported injury by area. The risk of suffering climbing-related injuries was significantly correlated to gender, setting, grade and type of climbing, but not to frequency of climbing. CONCLUSION: The results of this study could assist physiotherapists to assess and manage the common NMS injuries that occur in this group of extreme athletes, as well as to raise awareness amongst rock climbers in the Western Cape about potential risk of injury.

50|$|Humerus {{fractures}} usually occur after physical trauma, falls, excess physical stress, or pathological conditions. Proximal humerus fractures {{most often}} occur among elderly patients with osteoporosis who fall on an outstretched arm. Less frequently, proximal fractures occur from motor vehicle accidents, gunshots, and violent muscle contractions from an electric shock or seizure. Other {{risk factors for}} proximal fractures include having a low bone mineral density, having impaired vision and balance, and tobacco smoking. A stress fracture of the proximal and shaft regions can occur after an excessive amount of throwing, such as pitching in baseball. Middle fractures are usually caused by either physical trauma or falls. Physical trauma to the humerus shaft tends to produce transverse fractures whereas falls tend to produce spiral fractures. Metastatic breast cancer may also cause fractures in the humerus shaft. Long spiral fractures of the shaft that are present in children may indicate physical abuse. Distal fractures usually occur {{as a result of}} physical trauma to the <b>elbow</b> <b>region.</b> If the elbow is bent during the trauma, then the olecranon is driven upward, producing a T- or Y-shaped fracture or displacing one of the condyles. Falls that produce humerus fractures among the elderly are usually accompanied by a preexisting risk factor for bone fracture, such as osteoporosis, a low bone density, or vitamin B deficiency.|$|E
40|$|Translating ribosomes bypass a 50 {{nucleotide}} coding gap in bacteriophage T 4 gene 60 mRNA between codons 46 and 47 {{in order}} to synthesize the full-length protein. Bypassing of the coding gap requires peptidyl-tRNA 2 Gly detachment from a GGA codon (codon 46) followed by re-pairing at a matching GGA codon just before codon 47. Using negative selection, based on the sacB gene from Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli mutants were isolated which reduce bypassing efficiency. All of the mutations are in the gene for tRNA 2 Gly. Most of the mutations disrupt the hydrogen bonding interactions between the D- and T-loops (G 18 *psi 55 and G 19 *C 56) which stabilize the <b>elbow</b> <b>region</b> in nearly all tRNAs. The lone mutation not in the <b>elbow</b> <b>region</b> destabilizes the anticodon stem at position 40. Previously described Salmonella typhimurium mutants of tRNA 2 Gly, which reduce {{the stability of the}} T-loop, were also tested and found to decrease bypassing efficiency. Each tRNA 2 Gly mutant is functional in translation (tRNA 2 Gly is essential), but has a decoding efficiency 10 - to 20 -fold lower than wild-type. This suggests that rigidity of the <b>elbow</b> <b>region</b> and the anticodon stem is critical for both codon-anticodon stability and bypassing...|$|E
40|$|Background Peripheral nerves at the <b>elbow</b> <b>region</b> {{are prone}} to {{entrapment}} neuropathies and injuries. To make accurate assessment, clinicians need stereoscopic display of the nerves to observe them at all angles. Objectives To obtain a stereoscopic display of the peripheral nerves at the <b>elbow</b> <b>region</b> based on magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data using three post-processing methods of volume rendering (VR), maximum intensity projection (MIP), and fiber tractography, and to evaluate the difference and correlation between them. Subjects and Methods Twenty-four elbows of 12 healthy young volunteers were assessed by 20 encoding diffusion direction MR DTI scans. Images belonging to a single direction (anterior-posterior direction, perpendicular to the nerve) were subjected to VR and MIP reconstruction. All raw DTI data were transferred to the Siemens MR workstation for fiber tractography post-processing. Imaging qualities of fiber tractography and VR/MIP were evaluated by two observers independently based on a custom evaluation scale. Results Stereoscopic displays of the nerves were obtained in all 24 elbows by VR, MIP, and fiber tractography post-processing methods. The VR/MIP post-processing methods were easier to perform compared to fiber tractography. There {{was no significant difference}} among the scores of fiber tracking and VR/MIP reconstruction for single direction. The imaging quality scores of fiber tractography and VR/MIP were significantly correlated based on intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) analysis (ICC ranged 0. 709 - 0. 901), which suggested that the scores based on fiber tractography and VR/MIP for the same sample were consistent. Inter- and intraobserver agreements were good to excellent. Conclusion Stereoscopic displays of the peripheral nerves at the <b>elbow</b> <b>region</b> can be achieved by using VR, MIP, and fiber tracking post-processing methods based on raw DTI images. VR and MIP reconstruction could be used as preview tools before fiber tracking to determine whether the raw images are satisfactory...|$|E

According to the ILAE classification, the etiology of WS could be symptomatic or cryptogenic. An idiopathic etiology was considered too. In literature, there was never previously described a transition from WS to JME. Methods: The proband, (male) was referred to our Department at the age of 8 months because he showed clusters of symmetric spasms. Interictal EEG recording displayed an hypsarrhythmic pattern. The clinical and EEG data suggested WS diagnosis. At 1 year of age increasing long and thick hair in both <b>elbow</b> <b>regions</b> was observed. This picture suggested an additional diagnosis of “Hairy Elbows Syndrome”. During follow-up, the neurological examination was normal and the EEGs showed age appropriate background activity without abnormalities until 12 years of age, when he experienced some clusters of bilateral, arrhythmic myoclonic jerks, synchronous with generalized discharges of 4 Hz spike-wave. This features suggested JME diagnosis. Results: We report a child with WS with onset at 8 months of age followed by JME at 12 years of age. This unusual evolution, never reported previously, suggests that both seizure types may share some pathophysiological processes genetically determined, which produce a susceptibility to seizure. Conclusion: This case documents a new transition type from WS to JME and improves the knowledge about the spectrum of seizure susceptibility. These findings suggest that some genes other than those currently known and nonconventional genetic factors can play a role in seizure predisposition...|$|R

Sequence alignment of these TLSs suggests {{the existence of a}} tertiary D-loop–T-loop interaction consisting of 2 bp, analogous to those in the <b>elbow</b> <b>region</b> of canonical tRNAs. The conserved G 18 ·Ψ 55 pair of regular tRNAs is found to covary in these TLSs between G·U (possibly also modified to G·Ψ) and A·G. We have mutated the relevant bases in turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV) and examined the mutants for symptom development on Chinese cabbage plants and for accumulation of genetic reversions. Development of symptoms is shown to rely on the presence of either A·G or G·U in the original mutants or in revertants. This finding supports the existence and functional importance of this tertiary interaction. The fact that only G·U and A·G are accepted at this position appears to result from steric and energetic limitations related to the highly compact nature of the <b>elbow</b> <b>region.</b> We discuss the implications of these findings for the various possible functions of the valine-accepting TLS...|$|E

Dihedral angles along the phosphate-ribose backbone (alpha, beta, gamma, epsilon, zeta) and dihedral angles of glycosyl bonds (chi) are selected as movable parameters. The calculated displacement of each atom agrees with experimental data. In modes with frequencies higher than 130 cm- 1, the motions are localized around each stem and the <b>elbow</b> <b>region</b> of the L-shape. On the other hand, collective motions such as bending or twisting of arms are seen in modes with lower frequencies. Hinge axes and bend angles are calculated without prior knowledge. Movements in modes with very low frequencies are combinations of hinge bending motions with various hinge axes and bend angles. The thermal fluctuations of dihedral angles well reflect the structural characters of transfer RNAs.

40|$|AbstractPipelines {{are often}} {{referred}} as “lifelines” and this demonstrates that pipelines {{play an important}} role in human's life. Due to huge length and wide geographical distribution of pipelines, they are subjected to more seismic hazards. Seismic wave propagations affect the operation of buried pipelines which influence safety of these systems during and after earthquakes. Wave propagation causes out-of-phase displacements through pipe's longitudinal axis. As a result of more gradient and concentration of stresses and strains, damages increase in bend areas. Considering this subjects, it is crucial to study the buried pipelines’ behavior especially in elbow regions. The interaction between soil and pipe has been evaluated by using nonlinear springs as suggested by American Lifeline Alliance which can consider slipping between pipe and soil. In 3 D finite element models used in this study, applied wave is distributed spatially as a sine wave over the longitudinal leg of elbow. Results showed that mechanical properties of soil can affect the response of pipe in <b>elbow</b> <b>region.</b> In the presented paper, in addition to using beam model, a beam - shell hybrid model is used to find the pipe response in the <b>elbow</b> <b>region</b> and the results of these two methods are compared...|$|E

This was an indication of successful musculocutaneous nerve transfer because musculocutaneous nerve innervates biceps. The patient was then soon put to a training session and a testing session. During training session, the patient was sitting in an upright position and shown each of the 27 normal movements (such as shoulder adduction/abduction, hand open/close, elbow flexion/extension etc.) on a video. After each demonstration, the patient followed the movement 10 times, exerting a moderate force, held for 2.5 seconds. The patient was given 5 seconds of rest after each attempt. During the test session, the patient performed 5 sets of the 27 movements in random order. He was first shown a video of a movement, then asked to follow the repeated video of the same movement simultaneously after 2 seconds.|$|R
