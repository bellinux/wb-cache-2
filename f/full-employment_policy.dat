40|$|The lump-of-labor fallacy {{has been}} {{called one of the}} “best known fallacies in economics. ” It is widely cited in {{disparagement}} of policies for reducing the standard hours of work, yet the authenticity of the fallacy claim is questionable, and explanations of it are inconsistent and contradictory. This article discusses recent occurrences of the fallacy claim and investigates anomalies in the claim and its history. S. J. Chapman's coherent and formerly highly regarded theory of the hours of labor is reviewed, and it is shown how that theory could lend credence to the job-creating potentiality of shorter working time policies. It concludes that substituting a dubious fallacy claim for an authentic economic theory may have obstructed fruitful dialogue about working time and the appropriate policies for regulating it. lump-of-labor fallacy, hours of work, <b>full-employment</b> <b>policy,...</b>|$|E
40|$|Finland has an {{advanced}} welfare state system, which extends social protection {{for everyone in}} the country. The system is anchored in a <b>full-employment</b> <b>policy,</b> a steeply progressive taxation system, and a strong, benevolent and resourceful state, endowed with the authority to regulate the economic and social life of people. This system has been established through the institutionalization of various social insur-ance schemes and schemes for pensions, health care, childcare, free and compulsory education, etc. In the 1990 s, the Finnish state experienced an economic crisis, borne out of flawed economic reforms like the deregulation of the financial market and other changes that aimed at hastening Finland’s European Union (EU) membership. The crisis forced the government to tighten the preconditions for availing of welfare benefits. Some notable changes made during the crisis have not yet been rescinded even after it ended. Nevertheless, the crisis underlined the value of the welfare state system in helping ordinary people to successfully insulate themselves against any serious hardship during the period. As a result, the system is very popular in Finland...|$|E
40|$|The modern {{welfare state}} and <b>full-employment</b> <b>policies</b> have common {{intellectual}} roots. In the 1930 s and 1940 s, Keynesian visions of full employment and Beveridge-inspired ideas {{of a universal}} welfare state grew up in about the same intellectual environment. Both ideas emphasized a government’s responsibility {{for the welfare of}} its citizens. The two ideas were also projected by approximately the same individuals. From the very beginning, welfare-state arrangements and <b>full-employment</b> <b>policies</b> were regarded as strongly complementary. Both were designed to improve the economic security of the individual, although welfare-state arrangements deal largely with life-cycle considerations, while <b>full-employment</b> <b>policies</b> focus on the situation at a given point in time. They were also believed to support each other. Not only would high aggregate employment help finance the welfare state by boosting the tax base and keeping down the number of beneficiaries. A reverse causation was also assumed: various welfare-state arrangements were often asserted to contribute to full employment. Hence a virtuous circle was postulated between the welfare state and full employment. Governments also constructed specific institutional arrangements and regulations that were explicitly designed to strengthen the consistency and complementarity between the welfare state and <b>full-employment</b> <b>policies.</b> Actual economic and social developments during the first decades after World War II seemed to support the view of a harmonious, indeed symbiotic,relation between the welfare state and <b>full-employment</b> <b>policies.</b> It turned out to be possible to combine full employment with high economic security and a gradually more even distribution of income, which are important ambitions of the welfare state. Exactly what, then, were the asserted complementarities between the welfare state and <b>full-employment</b> <b>policies,</b> and why do these complementarities look less convincing today? I would like to organize the discussion of these questions around four issues: (i) the influence of welfare-state arrangements on short-term macroeconomic stability; (ii) the long-term incentive effects of welfare-state arrangements, and related taxes, on aggregate employment and unemployment; (iii) the role of explicit administrative measures to boost aggregate employment in the long run; and (iv) the employment consequences of various labor-market regulations designed to fulfill much the same purposes as traditional welfare-state arrangements. The paper concludes with (v) a discussion, using a simple macro model, of how various welfare-state arrangements affect the contemporary employment crisis in Western Europe.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{relationship}} between financial structure and the welfare consequences of fixed exchange rate regimes in small open emerging economies with downward nominal wage rigidity. The paper presents two surprising results. First, a pegging economy {{might be better off}} with a closed than with an open capital account. Second, the welfare gain from switching from a peg to the optimal (<b>full-employment)</b> monetary <b>policy</b> might be larger in financially open economies than in financially closed ones. ∗We thank Andy Neumeyer and the editors, Carmen Reinhart and Miguel Fuentes for helpful comments...|$|R
40|$|This {{analysis}} {{reflects on}} the importance of political parties, and the policies they implement when in government, in determining the level of equalities/inequalities in a society, the extent of the welfare state (including the level of health care coverage by the state), the employment/unemployment rate, and the level of population health. The study looks at the impact of the major political traditions in the advanced OECD countries during the golden years of capitalism (1945 - 1980) [...] social democratic, Christian democratic, liberal, and ex-fascist [...] in four areas: (1) the main determinants of income inequalities, such as the overall distribution of income derived from capital versus labor, wage dispersion in the labor force, the redistributive effect of the welfare state, and the levels and types of employment/unemployment; (2) levels of public expenditures and health care benefits coverage; (3) public support of services to families, such as child care and domiciliary care; and (4) the level of population health as measured by infant mortality rates. The results indicate that political traditions more committed to redistributive policies (both economic and social) and <b>full-employment</b> <b>policies,</b> such as the social democratic parties, were generally more successful in improving the health of populations, such as reducing infant mortality. The erroneous assumption of a conflict between social equity and economic efficiency, as in the liberal tradition, is also discussed. The study aims at filling a void in the growing health and social inequalities literature, which rarely touches {{on the importance of}} political forces in influencing inequalities. The data used in the study are largely from OECD health data for 1997 and 1998; the OECD statistical services; the comparative welfare state data set assembled by Huber, Ragin and Stephens; and the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.
