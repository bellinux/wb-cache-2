5|$|On September 22, 2017, Chelsea Manning {{was denied}} entry to Canada from the United States {{because of her}} {{criminal}} record. According to a letter from Canadian immigration officials, posted online by Manning, she is inadmissible due to being convicted of offenses equivalent to treason in Canada. Manning told Reuters that she had planned to vacation in Montreal and Vancouver, but was stopped at a Quebec border crossing by the Canada Border Services Agency {{on the evening of}} September 21 and detained overnight. She said she would retain a Canadian lawyer to challenge the <b>inadmissibility</b> finding before a Canadian tribunal.|$|E

This document only listed the values of APFs in several European countries (for reference); and declares the <b>inadmissibility</b> {{of the use of}} laboratory efficiency for predicting the protective properties at the workplace.|$|E
25|$|Schopenhauer praises Kant for his {{distinction}} between appearance and the things-in-themselves that appear, whereas {{the general consensus}} in German Idealism {{was that this was}} the weakest spot of Kant’s theory, since according to Kant causality can find application on objects of experience only, and consequently, things-in-themselves cannot be the cause of appearances, as Kant argued. The <b>inadmissibility</b> of this reasoning was also acknowledged by Schopenhauer. He insisted that this distinction was a true conclusion, drawn from false premises.|$|E
25|$|Both {{houses of}} Parliament finally {{approved}} the bill on June 30, {{the last day}} of the Parliamentary session. UMP voted in favour, the Communists and Socialists against, and UDF split over it between those voting against and those abstaining from voting. Socialist deputy Patrick Bloche defended a motion of <b>inadmissibility,</b> claiming that the law was unconstitutional and thus that the Assembly had to refuse it; Communist deputies and president of the UDF François Bayrou announced that they supported the motion. The motion was voted down, predictably, because the UMP ruling party had an absolute majority in the Assembly.|$|E
25|$|Immanuel Kant {{regarded}} masturbation as {{a violation}} of the moral law. In the Metaphysics of Morals (1797) he made the a posteriori argument that 'such an unnatural use of one's sexual attributes' strikes 'everyone upon his thinking of it' as 'a violation of one's duty to himself', and suggested that it was regarded as immoral even to give it its proper name (unlike the case of the similarly undutiful act of suicide). He went on, however, to acknowledge that 'it is not so easy to produce a rational demonstration of the <b>inadmissibility</b> of that unnatural use', but ultimately concluded that its immorality lay in the fact that 'a man gives up his personality … when he uses himself merely as a means for the gratification of an animal drive'.|$|E
25|$|Alexander Orakhelashvili cites {{a number}} {{cases in which}} {{international}} tribunals have ruled that international organizations, including the Security Council, are bound by general international law. He says that inclusion of explicit clauses about the <b>inadmissibility</b> of acquisition of territory by war and requiring respect of territorial integrity and sovereignty of a state demonstrates that the Council {{does not intend to}} offend peremptory norms in these specific ways. The resolution also acknowledges that these principles must be part of an accepted settlement. That is confirmed by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties which reiterates the prohibition on the use of force and provides that any settlement obtained by the threat or use of force in violation of the principles of international law embodied in the Charter of the United Nations or conflicting with a peremptory norm of general international law is invalid. According to Hans-Paul Gasser, ‘doubtful’ wording of the Council’s resolutions must always be construed {{in such a way as}} to avoid conflict with fundamental international obligations.|$|E
500|$|The {{draft of}} the {{application}} to the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation was considered in the paper [...] "Current legal issues relevant to forensic-psychiatric expert evaluation" [...] by Elena Shchukina and Sergei Shishkov focusing on the <b>inadmissibility</b> of appealing against the expert report without regard for {{the scope of the}} evaluated case. While talking about appealing against [...] "the reports", the authors of the paper, according to lawyer Dmitry Bartenev, mistakenly identify the reports with actions of the experts (or an expert institution) and justify the impossibility of the [...] "parallel" [...] examination and evaluation of the actions of the experts without regard for the scope of the evaluated case. Such a conclusion made by the authors appears clearly erroneous because abuse by the experts of rights and legitimate interests of citizens including trial participants, of course, may be a subject for a separate appeal.|$|E
2500|$|A 1999 policy {{letter from}} {{immigration}} officials defined [...] "public charge" [...] and identified which benefits are considered in public charge determinations, {{and the policy}} letter underlies current regulations and other guidance on the public charge grounds of <b>inadmissibility</b> and deportability. Collectively, the various sources addressing the meaning of public charge have historically suggested that an alien's receipt of public benefits, per se, is unlikely to result in the alien being deemed to be removable on public charge grounds.|$|E

2500|$|L'Auberge rouge(CNRS Éditions), by {{historian}} Thierry Boudignon, {{challenges the}} official theory {{and suggests that}} {{the case of the}} Red Inn was a terrible miscarriage of justice based on rumors, dubious witnesses, and the need to [...] "make an example". It is based on the documents from local and national archives, analyses the procedures of the instruction (preparation of the case), and shows that patois was an obstacle because the clerk of the court [...] "interpreted" [...] in French testimony given in patois, rather than simply translating what witnesses said. It concludes that the objective of the magistrates was to develop a convincing narrative in order to influence the decision of the jury. [...] Facts forbidden by law were presented in order to discredit the couple; the <b>inadmissibility</b> of some evidence didn't prevent the legal system from using it to secure a conviction.|$|E
2500|$|Glenn Perry {{asserts that}} because the French version {{resolves}} ambiguities in the English text, and is more consistent with the other clauses of the treaty, it is the correct interpretation. He argues that [...] "it is an accepted rule that the various language versions must be considered together, with the ambiguities of one version elucidated by the other". He cites Article 33 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which states that except when a treaty provides that one text shall prevail [...] "the meaning which best reconciles the texts, having regard to the object and purpose of the treaty, shall be adopted". He furthermore argues that {{the context of the}} passage, in a treaty that reaffirms [...] "'territorial integrity', 'territorial inviolability,' and 'the <b>inadmissibility</b> of the acquisition of territory by war' - taken together cannot be reconciled with anything less than full withdrawal". He argues that the reference to [...] "secure and recognized borders" [...] can be interpreted in several ways, and only one of them contradicts the principle of full withdrawal.|$|E
2500|$|Under Israeli control, {{members of}} all {{religions}} are largely granted {{access to their}} holy sites. The major exceptions being security limitations placed on some Arabs from the West Bank and Gaza Strip from accessing holy sites due to their <b>inadmissibility</b> to Jerusalem, as well as limitations on Jews from visiting the Temple Mount due to both politically motivated restrictions (where {{they are allowed to}} walk on the Mount in small groups, but are forbidden to pray or study while there) and religious edicts that forbid Jews from trespassing on what may be the site of the Holy of the Holies. Concerns have been raised about possible attacks on the al-Aqsa Mosque after a serious fire broke in the mosque in 1969 (started by Denis Michael Rohan, an Australian fundamentalist Christian found by the court to be insane). Riots broke out following the opening of an exit in the Arab Quarter for the Western Wall Tunnel on the instructions of the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which prior Prime Minister Shimon Peres had instructed to be put on hold for the sake of peace (stating [...] "it has waited for over 1000 years, it could wait a few more").|$|E
6000|$|The preacher {{proceeds}} to brush aside the common--I had almost said vulgar--apologetic pretext that Jesus was using ad hominem arguments, or [...] "accommodating" [...] his better knowledge to popular ignorance, {{as well as}} to point out the <b>inadmissibility</b> of the other alternative, that he shared the popular ignorance. And to those who hold the latter view sarcasm is dealt out with no niggard hand.|$|E
60|$|Your Committee found great {{impediment}} in {{the production}} of evidence, not only on account of the general doctrines supposed to exist concerning its <b>inadmissibility,</b> drawn from its own alleged natural incompetency, or from its inapplicability under the pleading of the impeachment of this House, but also from the mode of proceeding in bringing it forward. Here evidence which we thought necessary to the elucidation of the cause was not suffered, upon the supposed rules of examination in chief and cross-examination, and on supposed rules forming a distinction between evidence originally produced on the charge and evidence offered on the reply.|$|E
6000|$|The subject followed; {{it was in}} plain, unaffected, gentlemanlike English, such as Mr. Knightley used even to {{the woman}} {{he was in love}} with, how to be able to ask her to marry him, without attacking the {{happiness}} of her father. Emma's answer was ready at the first word. [...] "While her dear father lived, any change of condition must be impossible for her. She could never quit him." [...] Part only of this answer, however, was admitted. The impossibility of her quitting her father, Mr. Knightley felt as strongly as herself; but the <b>inadmissibility</b> of any other change, he could not agree to. He had been thinking it over most deeply, most intently; he had at first hoped to induce Mr. Woodhouse to remove with her to Donwell; he had wanted to believe it feasible, but his knowledge of Mr. Woodhouse would not suffer him to deceive himself long; and now he confessed his persuasion, that such a transplantation would be a risk of her father's comfort, perhaps even of his life, which must not be hazarded. Mr. Woodhouse taken from Hartfield!--No, he felt that it ought not to be attempted. But the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this, he trusted his dearest Emma would not find in any respect objectionable; it was, that he should be received at Hartfield; that so long as her father's happiness in other words his life--required Hartfield to continue her home, it should be his likewise.|$|E
6000|$|Your Committee finds but one instance, in {{the whole}} course of Parliamentary impeachments, in which {{evidence}} offered by the Commons has been rejected on the plea of <b>inadmissibility</b> or incompetence. This was {{in the case of}} Lord Strafford's trial; when the copy of a warrant (the same not having any attestation to authenticate it as a true copy) was, on deliberation, not admitted,--and your Committee thinks, as the case stood, with reason. But even in this one instance the Lords seemed to show a marked anxiety not to narrow too much the admissibility of evidence; for they confined their determination [...] "to this individual case," [...] as the Lord Steward reported their resolution; and he adds,--"They conceive this could be no impediment or failure in the proceeding, because the truth and verity of it would depend on the first general power given to execute it, which they who manage the evidence for the Commons say they could prove."[36] Neither have objections to evidence offered by the prisoner been very frequently made, nor often allowed when made. In the same case of Lord Strafford, two books produced by his Lordship, without proof by whom they were written, were rejected, (and on a clear principle,) [...] "as being private books, and no records."[37] On both these occasions, the questions were determined by the Lords alone, without any resort to the opinions of the Judges. In the impeachments of Lord Stafford, Dr. Sacheverell, and Lord Wintoun, no objection to evidence appears in the Lords' Journals to have been pressed, and not above one taken, which was {{on the part of the}} Managers.|$|E
6000|$|The {{second point}} of {{objection}} belongs to this review only {{in common with}} all other works of periodical criticism: at least, it applies in common to the general system of all, whatever exception there may be in favour of particular articles. Or if it attaches to THE EDINBURGH REVIEW, and to its only corrival (THE QUARTERLY), with any peculiar force, this results from the superiority of talent, acquirement, and information which both have so undeniably displayed; and which doubtless deepens the regret though not the blame. I am referring to the substitution of assertion for argument; to the frequency of arbitrary and sometimes petulant verdicts, not seldom unsupported even by a single quotation from the work condemned, which might at least have explained the critic's meaning, {{if it did not}} prove the justice of his sentence. Even where this is not the case, the extracts are too often made without reference to any general grounds or rules from which the faultiness or <b>inadmissibility</b> of the qualities attributed may be deduced; and without any attempt to show, that the qualities are attributable to the passage extracted. I have met with such extracts from Mr. Wordsworth's poems, annexed to such assertions, as led me to imagine, that the reviewer, having written his critique before he had read the work, had then pricked with a pin for passages, wherewith to illustrate the various branches of his preconceived opinions. By what principle of rational choice can we suppose a critic to have been directed (at least in a Christian country, and himself, we hope, a Christian) who gives the following lines, portraying the fervour of solitary devotion excited by the magnificent display of the Almighty's works, as a proof and example of an author's tendency to downright ravings, and absolute unintelligibility? ...|$|E
60|$|Now the {{interesting}} fact about the yellow {{branch of the}} human race is, not that they had so juvenile a constitution, but that they have it; that it has persisted practically unchanged from prehistoric ages. It is certainly surprising in this kaleidoscopic world whose pattern is constantly changing as time merges one combination of its elements into another, that {{on the other side of}} the globe this set should have remained the same. Yet in spite of the lapse of years, in spite of the altered conditions of existence, in spite of an immense advance in civilization, such a primitive state of society has continued there to the present day, in all its essentials what it was when as nomads the race forefathers wandered peacefully or otherwise over the plains of Central Asia. The principle helped them to expand; it has simply cramped them ever since. For, instead of dissolving like other antiquated views, it has become, what it was bound to become if it continued to last, crystallized into an institution. It had practically reached this condition when it received a theoretical, not to say a theological recognition which gave it mundane immortality. A couple of millenniums ago Confucius consecrated filial duty by making it the basis of the Chinese moral code. His hand was the finishing touch of fossilification. For since the sage set his seal upon the system no one has so much as dreamt of changing it. The idea of confuting Confucius would be an act of impiety such as no Chinaman could possibly commit. Not that the <b>inadmissibility</b> of argument is due really to the authority of the philosopher, but that it lies ingrained in the character of the people. Indeed the genius of the one may be said to have consisted in divining the genius of the other. Confucius formulated the prevailing practice, and in so doing helped to make it perpetual. He gave expression to the national feeling, and like expressions, generally his, served to stamp the idea all the more indelibly upon the national consciousness.|$|E
