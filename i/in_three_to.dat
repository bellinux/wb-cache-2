5|$|Malaria: During {{the early}} 1940s, quinine {{was the chief}} anti-malarial drug. Made from the bark of the South American cinchona tree, quinine was in short supply during the war, so {{scientists}} began searching for an alternative treatment. The test subjects allowed themselves to be bitten by malarial mosquitoes and when the fever reached its peak <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>to</b> four days, were given experimental treatments. At the University of Minnesota, twelve CPS men underwent tests to determine the recovery period for those infected with malaria. This research documented the debilitating effects {{of the disease and}} the amount of time required for a complete recovery.|$|E
5|$|Mobilization of the Red Army {{had begun}} {{before the last}} round of {{meetings}} in Moscow. On June 7, the Army was ordered to prepare for an attack against Lithuania. As of June 5, all Soviet forces in the Baltic region were assigned to command of Semyon Timoshenko, People's Commissar for Defense. The Soviets gathered their forces on Lithuania′s eastern border in modern-day Belarus; they consisted of five divisions and supporting units from the 3rd and the 11th Armies. The armies included 221,260 soldiers, operating 1,140 airplanes and 1,513 tanks. Lithuania already housed 18,786 Soviet troops within its territory. At the time the Lithuanian Army comprised 28,005 troops and owned 118 planes. The Soviets readied hospitals for the wounded and prisoner-of-war camps. On June 11, {{under the command of}} General Dmitry Pavlov, the Soviets finalized their attack plan and assigned specific tasks to all units. The orders were to cross the border silently, use bayonets as gunshots would be noticed, and to maneuver around defensive forces in order to occupy the territory more quickly. The Soviets expected {{to take control of the}} entire territory <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>to</b> four days.|$|E

25|$|Pearl {{farmers can}} culture a pearl {{by placing a}} nucleus, usually a piece of {{polished}} mussel shell, inside the oyster. <b>In</b> <b>three</b> <b>to</b> seven years, the oyster can produce a perfect pearl. These pearls are not as valuable as natural pearls, but look exactly the same. In fact, {{since the beginning of}} the 20th century, when several researchers discovered how to produce artificial pearls, the cultured pearl market has far outgrown the natural pearl market.|$|E
25|$|With {{attractive}} {{deep green}} foliage and large, brightly coloured flower {{species that are}} held outside the canopy, B.victoriae is a popular garden plant. It requires a sunny aspect in well drained soil, and is sensitive to frost. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 27 to 41 days to germinate. It is easy to propagate from seed, but rather difficult from cuttings. It grows quickly, and flowers <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>to</b> four years from seed. George recommends only light pruning, not below the green foliage.|$|E

25|$|Predatory coccinellids {{are usually}} found on plants which harbour their prey. They {{lay their eggs}} near their prey, to {{increase}} the likelihood the larvae will find the prey easily. In Harmonia axyridis, eggs hatch <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>to</b> four days from clutches numbering from a few to several dozen. Depending on resource availability, the larvae pass through four instars over 10–14 days, after which pupation occurs. After a teneral period of several days, the adults become reproductively active {{and are able to}} reproduce again later, although they may become reproductively quiescent if eclosing late in the season. Total life span is one to two years on average.|$|E

25|$|Use {{of trucks}} was {{constrained}} {{by the lack of}} fuel and high costs of synthetic gasoline on the German side, and the losses of equipment in 1941–1942 on the Soviet side. The Soviets managed their losses with the formation of 76 horse transport battalions of 500 horses each, and employed reindeer in the Arctic and camels in the South. But overcoming shortage of horses themselves was insurmountable: a work horse matures <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>to</b> four years; farm stocks were already depleted of horses as well as tractors. Western European nations, starting with the United Kingdom, witnessed shortage of horses since the 1920s and adjusted their armies accordingly. Germany of the 1920s managed to restore their population of horses, but then it declined again as farm horses were replaced by motor power.|$|E
25|$|The larvae hatch <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>to</b> six days, eat voraciously and moult {{three times}} as they grow. They feed not only on aphids but also on many other types of insects and even prey on larger creatures, such as caterpillars. They can consume large numbers of prey and {{completely}} destroy aphid colonies. When food is scarce they turn cannibal and eat each other. After two to three weeks, the mature larvae secrete silk and build round, parchment-like cocoons in concealed positions on plants. From these, the adults emerge ten to fourteen days later. The length {{of the life cycle}} (under 4 weeks in summer conditions) is greatly influenced by the temperature and there may be several generations each year under favourable conditions.|$|E

25|$|The {{first line}} {{treatment}} is change of lifestyle (e.g., Dietary Guidelines for Americans and physical activity). However, if <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>to</b> six months of efforts at remedying risk factors prove insufficient, then drug treatment is frequently required. Generally, the individual disorders that compose the metabolic syndrome are treated separately. Diuretics and ACE inhibitors {{may be used to}} treat hypertension. Cholesterol drugs may be used to lower LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels, if they are elevated, and to raise HDL levels if they are low. Use of drugs that decrease insulin resistance, e.g., metformin and thiazolidinediones, is controversial; this treatment is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Weight loss medications may result in weight loss. As obesity is often recognized as the culprit behind many of the additional symptoms, with weight loss and lifestyle changes in diet, physical activity, the need for other medications may diminish.|$|E
25|$|The mandibular stylet tips {{have small}} teeth, and through {{alternately}} moving these stylets back and forth, the insect cuts {{a path through}} tissue for the maxillary bundle to reach an appropriately sized blood vessel. Pressure from the blood vessel itself fills the insect with blood <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>to</b> five minutes. The bug then withdraws the stylet bundle from the feeding position and retracts {{it back into the}} labial groove, folds the entire unit back under the head, and returns to its hiding place. It takes between five and ten minutes for a bed bug to become completely engorged with blood. In all, the insect may spend less than 20 minutes in physical contact with its host, and does not try to feed again until it has either completed a moult or, if an adult, has thoroughly digested the meal.|$|E
25|$|One or two African-American troupes {{dominated}} {{the scene for}} much of the late 1860s and 1870s. The first of these was Brooker and Clayton's Georgia Minstrels, who played the Northeast around 1865. Sam Hague's Slave Troupe of Georgia Minstrels formed shortly thereafter and toured England to great success beginning in 1866. In the 1870s, white entrepreneurs bought most of the successful black companies. Charles Callender obtained Sam Hague's troupe in 1872 and renamed it Callender's Georgia Minstrels. They became the most popular black troupe in America, and the words Callender and Georgia came to be synonymous with the institution of black minstrelsy. J. H. Haverly in turn purchased Callender's troupe in 1878 and applied his strategy of enlarging troupe size and embellishing sets. When this company went to Europe, Gustave and Charles Frohman took the opportunity to promote their Callender's Consolidated Colored Minstrels. Their success was such that the Frohmans bought Haverly's group and merged it with theirs, creating a virtual monopoly on the market. The company split <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>to</b> better canvas the nation and dominated black minstrelsy throughout the 1880s. Individual black performers like Billy Kersands, James A. Bland, Sam Lucas, Martin Francis and Wallace King grew as famous as any featured white performer.|$|E
