5000|$|Comments by opponents: Opponents {{agree that}} a {{constitutional}} amendment is necessary to address uncertainties in the law but disagree as to what uncertainties should be addressed and how the law should be changed. The amendment fails to address crucial issues, such as what charges {{are subject to the}} constitutional <b>fee</b> <b>cap</b> and whether an application for a home equity loan may be taken orally. Because the courts tend to favor lenders on these issues, failure of the amendment to address the issues is the same as settling the issues in the lenders’ favor to the detriment of borrowers. Moreover, the amendment does not provide enough protection to home equity line of credit borrowers, who are enticed into taking advances on the loan by the use of preprinted checks.|$|E

In cross-sectional analysis at both country and firm level, we find that these net benefits arise from the prohibition of non-audit services and the placing of a <b>cap</b> on total <b>fees</b> charged by the auditor. Furthermore, we find investors in firms with low earnings quality appear to perceive the greatest benefits from the proposed reforms...|$|R

There is also a 50-cent administrative fee to cover costs of lenders verifying whether a borrower qualifies for the loan, such as determining whether the consumer is still paying off a previous loan.

The statewide database does not allow a loan to be issued to a consumer by a licensed payday lender if the loan {{would result in a}} violation of state statute. A borrower's cumulative payday loans cannot exceed 25 percent of the individual's gross monthly income.|$|R

40|$|As of September 2012, the {{undergraduate}} tuition <b>fee</b> <b>cap</b> at English universities was raised from £ 3375 to £ 9000 per annum. This article explores the rationales underpinning prospective students' decision {{whether or not}} to apply to higher education following the fee increase, specifically, how this decision is influenced by perceptions of study-related debt and expected earnings. The article draws on data obtained from prospective undergraduates in year 13 and conceptualises their decision-making using the notion of ‘bounded rationality’. The data show that participant's primary response to the fee increase and associated study-related debt is that ‘there is no point worrying’. This is because in the short term, a higher education degree is considered vital to securing employment in a competitive labour market. In the long term, there is a perception that the income contingent nature of student loan repayments makes the Treasury, not the student, liable for any resultant financial losses...|$|E
