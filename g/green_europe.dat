A number of expatriates, living far from any polling station, {{said they had}} been unable to vote online, because they had not received the necessary login codes, or because of errors when they attempted to log in and cast their vote. Others said they had abstained deliberately, considering that they should not be voting in an election when the results would primarily affect residents of France. Others considered that the candidates were necessarily ill-suited to represent the interests of expatriates scattered over often vast and diverse territories. Based on projections from the 2007 presidential election results, the carving of constituencies should have resulted in a 9-to-2 division of the seats between the UMP and the Socialists, however French expatriates ended up electing seven Socialists, one <b>Green</b> (<b>Europe</b> Écologie - Les Verts) and three UMP deputies. The results were likely impacted by low turnout and support for Francois Hollande following his presidential election.|$|E

40|$|Unlike most nation-states, the EU {{faces the}} {{challenge}} of actively creating and sustaining myths about its polity. In this article we explore if and under what conditions {{the story of a}} 'Green Europe' represents a successful new myth on the European project, which is appealing to present and future generations and capable of generating legitimacy for EU politics. Exploring the narratives of policy leaders (storytellers) we trace the functional role of environmental policy for the EU polity as a whole, establish the legitimating role of environmental policy for the EU and search {{the extent to which the}} environmental narrative is constructed as an identity-building story. We argue that, while the actual performance of the EU in environmental policy might raise some doubts about the credibility and hence sustainability of the <b>Green</b> <b>Europe</b> myth, 'green' has become a brand attribute of the EU to the European public and carries a high level of legitimacy and potential for identification.
