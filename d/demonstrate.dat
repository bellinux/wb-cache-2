5|$|A {{statement}} is considered falsifiable {{if there is}} an observation or a test that could be made that would <b>demonstrate</b> that the {{statement is}} false. Statements that are not falsifiable cannot be examined by scientific investigation since they permit no tests that evaluate their accuracy. Creationists such as Henry M.

40|$|Based on {{the field}} investigations, this paper {{analyzes}} systematically the achievements and problems of constructing the <b>demonstrating</b> areas of the ecological rebuilding and economic sustainable development in Hexi, Gansu Province, and then the thoughts on constructing the <b>demonstrating</b> areas are brought forward. It is considered that all kinds of ecological <b>demonstrating</b> areas should be merged in order to construct large-scale characterized <b>demonstrating</b> areas which go beyond the district. In other words, in Hexi Region, Zhangye District should be constructed as the largest ecoagriculture <b>demonstrating</b> area of high technology; Wuwei District should be constructed as the largest ecological <b>demonstrating</b> area of agricultural comprehensive exploitation; JiuJia District, which is the shortened form of Jiuquan and Jiayuguan, should be constructed as the largest ecotourism <b>demonstrating</b> area; and Jinchang City should be constructed as the largest ecoindustry <b>demonstrating</b> area. At the same time, the constructing pattern should be selected according to the actual circumstances; science and technology should be applied to construct the <b>demonstrating</b> areas and accelerate the industrialization in the big market. Additionally, {{it is important to}} smooth the constructing system and implement the flexible and efficacious running mechanism, and it is suggested that the committee should be organized to administer the ecological <b>demonstrating</b> areas in Hexi Region...|$|R

5|$|Gilmore had {{suspected}} that C. fragilis and C. agilis were the same, but Ostrom {{was able to}} <b>demonstrate</b> this synonymy. This greatly expanded the known material pertaining to C. fragilis, and Ostrom was able to <b>demonstrate</b> that Ornitholestes was quite different from Coelurus. At the time, Dale Russell had proposed that C. agilis was a species of Elaphrosaurus based on the incomplete information then published; Ostrom was also able to <b>demonstrate</b> {{that this was not}} the case. Additionally, he showed that one of the three vertebrae Marsh had illustrated for C. fragilis was actually a composite of two vertebrae, one of which was later shown to come from another quarry and belonged not to Coelurus but to another, unnamed small theropod. This unnamed genus would not be the last small theropod from the Morrison Formation to be confused with Coelurus; a later discovery (1995) of a partial skeleton in Wyoming was first thought to be a new larger specimen of Coelurus, but further study showed it belonged to a different but related genus, Tanycolagreus.|$|E
