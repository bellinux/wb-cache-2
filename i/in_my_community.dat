40|$|Since 2006, I {{have had}} a number of residencies that have {{involved}} me working as a poet <b>in</b> <b>my</b> local area. Much of the work I have done has fed into the thinking behind aspects of my phd research around poetry as a vehicle for micro-history. From Mistress Quickly to Lil, Eliot’s ‘tarnished Venus’, within the western literary cannon, the voices of working class London women are fairly rare, and when they are present they are there for either comedic value or to stand in for coarseness or both. As a lyric poet from a working class London background, I needed to challenge that narrow archetype and stretch that voice in a way that convinces a reader. My residencies have helped me with that in a number of ways. The residences and people within the community who have participated in those projects have helped me listen more closely to the voice of <b>my</b> <b>community</b> peer group, play with colloquial phrases (Slanguage), think about and discuss issues of voice, dialect and idealect. <b>In</b> that way, <b>my</b> life as a community poet has fed directly into my life as an academic poet. I am also interested in looking at ways <b>in</b> which <b>my</b> <b>community</b> can be enriched by the academy. In 2011, UEL hosted a one day conference for public library reading groups as part of the East London Libraries Festival. Due to a change in senior management between the conference being agreed and taking place, {{there were a number of}} problems – to start with it was much smaller than it could have been.

After all, boxing hero Muhammed Ali said, [...] "The little white <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>community</b> would have come only through rape..." [...] As long as you remain silent, India will never open its mouth. Perhaps India may break its silence after all the Tamils have been killed. Until then, are you going to keep looking at India's mouth? They say that the war in Vanni is against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. They say that the Tigers are using the people as a human shield. If that is true, why do they come into the safety zone declared by the Government and kill people? This one evidence is enough that irrespective of whether the Tamil people are dependent on the Tigers or on the Government, they are going to be killed for the sole reason that they are Tamils. Is this not genocide? If India, Pakistan and China are supplying arms, Japan is giving economic aid, and moreover India is bullying Sri Lanka and thus killing Tamils, why don't you realize that you are also committing the same murder by your silence and your blindness?
