25|$|The second Turkish War (1787-92) and the Swedish {{war with}} Gustavus III (1788–90) heaped fresh burdens on his already heavily laden shoulders, and he {{suffered}} from the intrigues of his numerous jealous rivals, including the empress's latest favorite, A. M. Mamonov. All his efforts were directed towards {{the conclusion of the}} two oppressive wars by an honorable peace. The pause of Verela with Gustavus III (14 August 1790) was on the terms dictated by him. On the sudden death of Potemkin he was despatched to Jassy to prevent the peace congress there from breaking up, and succeeded, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> but insuperable difficulties, in concluding a treaty exceedingly advantageous to Russia (9 January 1792). For this service he received the thanks of the empress, the ribbon of St Andrew and 50,000 roubles.|$|E

25|$|The 1999 {{case was}} reopened by another court in 2008. The {{indictment}} from the prosecutor’s office, made public by Cumhuriyet, claimed blackmail and extortion. Among other things, it claimed that BAV used its female members to attract young scholars from rich families {{with the promise}} of sexual favors in exchange for attending events. It was claimed that the sexual activities of thousands of people were videotaped with hidden cameras for the purpose of blackmail. Members who wanted to leave the group were threatened that the tapes would be made public. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> these allegations against BAV, the Chairman of the Court announced in the hearing on 29 February 2008, that testimonies obtained through unlawful means may not be considered as evidence based on article 148 of the criminal code.|$|E
25|$|The two armies {{fought a}} series of minor actions August 2225 along the Rappahannock River, {{including}} Waterloo Bridge, Lee Springs, Freeman's Ford, and Sulphur Springs, resulting in a few hundred casualties. Together, these skirmishes kept the attention of both armies along the river. Heavy rains had swollen the river and Lee was unable to force a crossing. Pope considered an attack across the river to strike Lee's right flank, {{but he was also}} stymied by the high water. By this time, reinforcements from the Army of the Potomac were arriving from the Peninsula: Maj. Gen. Samuel P. Heintzelman's III Corps, Maj. Gen. Fitz-John Porter's V Corps, and elements of the VI Corps under Brig. Gen. George W. Taylor. Lee's new plan <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> these additional forces outnumbering him was to send Jackson and Stuart with half of the army on a flanking march to cut Pope's line of communication, the Orange & Alexandria Railroad. The Hotchkiss journal shows that Jackson, most likely, originally conceived the movement. In the journal entries for March 4 and 6 1863, General Stuart tells Hotchkiss that “Jackson was entitled to all the credit” for the movement and that Lee thought the proposed movement “very hazardous” and “reluctantly consented” to the movement. Pope would be forced to retreat and could be defeated while moving and vulnerable. Jackson departed on August 25 and reached Salem (present-day Marshall) that night.|$|E

500|$|At first, the Waldorf {{appeared}} {{destined for}} failure.

500|$|In March 1912 Heseltine {{returned}} to London and engaged a tutor {{to prepare for}} his university entrance examinations. He spent time with Delius at that summer's Birmingham Festival, and published his first music criticism, an article on Arnold Schoenberg {{that appeared in the}} Musical Standard in September 1912. Despite his mother's wishes and his lack of formal musical training, he hoped to make a career in music. He consulted Delius, who advised him that, if his mind was set, he should follow his instincts and pursue this objective <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> other considerations. Beecham, who knew both men, later sharply criticised this advice, on the grounds of Heseltine's immaturity and instability. [...] "Frederick should never have committed the psychological blunder of preaching the doctrine of relentless determination to someone incapable of receiving it". In the end Heseltine acceded to his mother's wishes. After passing the necessary examinations, he was accepted to study classics at Christ Church, Oxford, and began there in October 1913.|$|E
500|$|After {{the report}} was {{published}} on 3 September 2002, it was condemned by {{a wide variety of}} Bosnian and international figures. A spokesman for the ICTY told Radio Free Europe that [...] "any claim that the number of victims {{after the fall of the}} Srebrenica enclave was around the 2,000 mark, and most of those killed in battle, is an absolutely outrageous claim. It's utterly false, and it flies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> of the evidence painstakingly collected in the investigation into the tragedy." [...] He described the effort to minimise the number of victims as [...] "frankly, disgusting." [...] Carla del Ponte, the chief prosecutor of the ICTY, described the report's authors as [...] "totally blind, profoundly insensitive and clearly willing to obstruct all efforts to find reconciliation, truth and justice." [...] Del Ponte's legal adviser, Jean-Jacques Joris, criticised the report as [...] "a saddening example of revisionism and an element which certainly stands in the way of reconciliation in the region." [...] The ICTY prosecutors subsequently used the report as evidence in the trial in 2004 of Miroslav Deronjić; in their verdict, the judges called it [...] "one of the worst examples of revisionism in relation to [...] ".|$|E

I am also satisfied that Richard did not strike linesman Thompson as a result of a mistake or accident as suggested … Assistance can also be obtained from an incident that occurred less than three months ago in which the pattern of conduct of Richard was almost identical, including his constant resort to the recovery of his stick to pursue his opponent, as well as flouting the authority of and striking officials. On the previous occasion he was fortunate that teammates and officials were more effective in preventing him from doing injury to anyone and the penalty was more lenient in consequence. At the time he was warned there must be no further incident … The time for probation or leniency is past. Whether this type of conduct is the product of temperamental instability or willful defiance of the authority in the games does not matter. It is a type of conduct which cannot be tolerated by any player—star or otherwise. Richard will be suspended from all games both league and playoff for the balance of the current season.|$|E
500|$|Although Nielsen came {{to compose}} mainly at the piano, he only {{composed}} directly for it occasionally {{over a period}} of 40 years, creating works often with a distinctive style which slowed their international acceptance. Nielsen's own piano technique, an echo of which is probably preserved in three wax cylinders marked [...] "Carl Nielsen" [...] at the State Archives in Aarhus, seems to have been mediocre. Reviewing the 1969 recording of works by the pianist John Ogdon, John Horton commented on the early pieces: [...] "Nielsen's technical resources hardly measure up to the grandeur of his designs", whilst characterising the later pieces as [...] "major works which can stand comparison with his symphonic music". The anti-romantic tone of the Symphonic Suite, Op. 8 (1894) was described by a later critic as [...] "nothing less than a clenched fist straight <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> established musical convention". In Nielsen's words, the Chaconne, Op. 32 (1917) was [...] "a really big piece, and I think effective". It is not only inspired by the work of Bach, especially the chaconne for solo violin, but also by the virtuoso piano arrangements of Bach's music by composers such as Robert Schumann, Johannes Brahms and Ferruccio Busoni. Also on a large scale, and from the same year, is the Theme and Variations, Op. 41, in which critics have discerned the influences of Brahms and also of Max Reger, of whom Nielsen had earlier written to a friend [...] "I think that the public will be utterly unable to grasp Reger's work and yet I am a lot more sympathetic towards his efforts than towards... Richard Strauss".|$|E
500|$|The {{day before}} the 2016 NBA draft, LeVert {{authored}} {{an open letter to}} NBA general managers to assure them of his resiliency <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> of his doubters due to his injury. On June 23, LeVert was selected with the 20th overall pick in the 2016 draft by the Indiana Pacers. He became Michigan's fifth first-round draft selection since 2013 and the fourth player drafted from Michigan's 2012 entering class. His rights were later traded to the Brooklyn Nets on July 7, in exchange for Thaddeus Young. Dr. O'Malley, who had performed LeVert's most recent foot surgery, was on the Brooklyn Nets medical staff {{at the time of the}} trade. On July 14, he signed his rookie scale contract with the Nets. LeVert missed the 2016 NBA Summer League as well as preseason and resumed practicing near the beginning of the regular season. He began the season sidelined and still rehabbing his injury. He was cleared to play on December 4. He made his professional debut on December 7 against the Denver Nuggets. Although he went 0-of-3 from the field, he posted 4 rebounds and 3 steals in 9 minutes of play, becoming the first Net to post 3 steals in his debut since Chris Childs in 1994. Levert entered at the start of the second quarter and posted 3 steals and 3 rebounds in 5:15 of play before halftime. LeVert scored his first NBA points on December 10 against the San Antonio Spurs on a back door reverse layup assisted by Brook Lopez. LeVert posted double digit scoring for the first time with 12 points on December 30 against the Washington Wizards and former Michigan one-on-one training partner Burke's season-high 27 points. On February 3, Levert made his first NBA start against former Michigan teammate Robinson and the Indiana Pacers. On April 6 against the Orlando Magic, LeVert posted his first 20-point performance. Despite missing a large portion of the season, LeVert almost made the NBA All-Rookie team, finishing 12 in the voting for the 10-man team.|$|E

[...] Despite the rain, the ballroom filled with many of New York's First Families, who had paid $5.00 for the concert and dinner at the Waldorf. Mrs. William K. Vanderbilt donated the services of the New York Symphony Orchestra led by Walter Damrosch to provide the music for the event. Even with proper escort, women of the times generally did not venture into hotels, but those attending also toured the facilities. While Boldt made news by insisting the Waldorf's waiters be clean-shaven even though he wore a beard, his decision to hire young Oscar Tschirky was one of the key factors in the hotel's success. Oscar was personable, humble and very willing to tend to patrons' needs on an individual basis. More than thirty years later, Tschirky was able to recall the Waldorf's opening day and the names of many of the Social Register guests who made the hotel successful when it hosted the charity concert and dinner. Business soon picked up and it earned $4.5 million in its first year, exorbitant for that period. By 1895, the Waldorf added a five story addition. [...] This brought the hotel's ballroom down to the main floor; the move brought many parties and dinners which were formerly held in private homes, into the Waldorf. [...] Adjacent to the new ballroom was the Oak Room, where one could sit by large fireplaces where there were always logs on the hearth. [...] In winter, waiters would offer patrons complimentary baked potatoes with butter.|$|E
