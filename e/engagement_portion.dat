40|$|Human {{rights is}} unique in {{that it has a}} {{universal}} affect on everyone world-wide no matter his or her nationality, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religious beliefs or economic standing. In order to narrow this down, the intention of this thesis is to explore a specific topic in regards to the overlying issue of human rights. This thesis provides evidence of the mistreatment and blatant racism that is inflicted upon the Roma living in Italy and this paper makes the claim that this is the fault of the Italian government. The methodology used for the community <b>engagement</b> <b>portion</b> of the thesis is a combination of surveys and an interview. The findings reveal the opinions and sentiments towards the Roma, immigration, and the Italian government on a personal level. The conclusion sums up the general synopsis of the thesis and uses it in order to draw solutions to the initial problem of human rights injustices against the Roma minority living in Italy...|$|E

Although much research as looked at how players are engaged during moments of play, {{and how the}} performance of players during play can be engaging for observers, very little has looked at how the players themselves are engaged during moments of observation within the game. I propose a study to understand player <b>engagement</b> during <b>portions</b> of player observation. This will involve the clinical interview method focusing on player thought and <b>engagement</b> during <b>portions</b> of non-play while engaged in playing different genres of games...|$|R

40|$|Modern Web {{services}} are typically {{free and open}} access, often supported by advertising revenue. These attributes, however, leave services vulnerable to many forms of abuse, including sending spam via Web-based email accounts, inflating page rank scores by spamming backlinks on blogs, etc. However, many of these schemes are nontrivial to execute, requiring technical expertise and access to ancillary resources (e. g. IP diversity, telephone numbers, etc.). Thus, many scammers prefer to offload the execution of their abuse schemes onto hired labor. This desire to minimize effort has created a demand for workers to carry out malicious tasks. Meanwhile, various online labor marketplaces have emerged that connect employers with cheap, human workers. Abusers have turned to online freelancing sites to find workers willing to carry out numerous schemes. Outsourcing is an attractive option for entrepreneurial scammers, as the workers are typically cheap, technically adept, and exist in vast numbers. In this dissertation, we investigate how outsourcing impacts the security of Web services; no longer must service providers be wary of automated tools, they must now contend with inexpensive human labor willing to do any menial task. In {{the first part of}} the dissertation, we characterize the role of freelance labor in Web service abuse, analyzing over seven years of data from the popular crowdsourcing site Freelancer. com, as well data from our own active job solicitations. We identify the largest classes of abuse work, including account creation, social networking link generation and search engine optimization support, and characterize how pricing and demand have evolved in supporting this activity. We show that scammers heavily employ outsourced labor, with abuse jobs constituting approximately 30 % of the job solicitations on the site. Further, we demonstrate that workers quickly adapt their skill sets in responses to changes in demand for various abuse tasks. Lastly, the <b>engagement</b> <b>portion</b> of our study shows that workers actually deliver the promised goods, though the quality of the items is often variable. The second part of the dissertation focuses exclusively on the role of humans in circumventing CAPTCHAs. Human CAPTCHA solving services represent a heavily commercialized, outsourced abuse task, and we perform an in-depth analysis of this industry. CAPTCHAs are an ubiquitous defense used to protect open Web resources from being exploited at scale. In response to the widespread deployment of CAPTCHAs, a robust solving ecosystem has emerged, selling real-time human labor to bypass these protections. We analyze the behavior and dynamics of CAPTCHA-solving service providers, their price performance, and the underlying labor markets driving this economy. Ultimately, our work shows that CAPTCHAs are effective at differentiating between humans and computers. However, due to the vast number of human workers willing to solve CAPTCHAs for low wages, CAPTCHAs cannot necessarily prevent widespread abuse; instead, they serve as a low- cost economic impediment to abusers The results from these two studies demonstrate the increasing role that outsourcing plays in abusing Web services at scale. Furthermore, they suggest that Web services not only need to consider automated threats, but also must contend with an agile human labor pool. Lastly, they suggest one way to evaluate deployed security mechanisms, by monitoring the price and demand fluctuations for various abusively obtained product...|$|E

40|$|Stress {{plays a role}} in the {{exacerbation}} {{and possibly}} the development of functional lower urinary tract disorders. Chronic water avoidance stress (WAS) in rodents is a model with high construct and face validity to bladder hypersensitive syndromes, such as interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS), characterized by urinary frequency and bladder hyperalgesia and heightened stress responsiveness. Given the overlap of the brain circuits involved in stress, anxiety, and micturition, we evaluated the effects chronic stress has on bladder function, as well as its effects on regional brain activation during bladder filling. Female Wistar-Kyoto rats were exposed to WAS (10 days) or sham paradigms. One day thereafter, cystometrograms were obtained during titrated bladder dilation, with visceromotor responses (VMR) recorded simultaneously. Cerebral perfusion was assessed during passive bladder distension (20 -cmH 2 O) following intravenous administration of [14 C]-iodoantipyrine. Regional cerebral blood flow was quantified by autoradiography and analyzed in 3 -dimensionally reconstructed brains with statistical parametric mapping. WAS animals compared to controls demonstrated a decreased pressure threshold and visceromotor threshold triggering the voiding phase. At 20 -cmH 2 O, VMR was significantly greater in WAS animals compared to controls. WAS animals showed greater activation in cortical regions of the central micturition circuit, including the posterior cingulate, anterior retrosplenial, somatosensory, posterior insula, orbital, and anterior secondary ("supplementary") motor cortices, {{as well as in the}} thalamus, anterior hypothalamus, parabrachial and Barrington nuclei, and striatum. Seed analysis showed increased functional connectivity of WAS compared to control animals of the posterior cingulate cortex to the pontine parabrachial nucleus; of the Barrington nucleus to the anterior dorsal midline and ventrobasilar thalamus and somatosensory and retrosplenial cortices; and of the posterior insula to anterior secondary motor cortex. Our findings show a visceral hypersensitivity during bladder filling in WAS animals, as well as increased <b>engagement</b> of <b>portions</b> of the micturition circuit responsive to urgency, viscerosensory perception and its relay to motor regions coordinating imminent bladder contraction. Results are consistent with recent findings in patients with interstitial cystitis, suggesting that WAS may serve as an animal model to elucidate the mechanisms leading to viscerosensitive brain phenotypes in humans with IC/BPS...|$|R
40|$|Learning English as {{a foreign}} {{language}} (EFL), a highly valued skill in the Chilean marketplace, is an arduous and complex personal endeavor requiring high student motivation. Reflecting this challenge is the heightened anxiety among EFL students, whose work {{has been associated with}} historically meager results. Blended learning, the fusion of face-to-face and online content delivery and assessment, offers a promising solution to EFL learner reticence. Evidence suggests that an active online teacher presence in a blended EFL course can enhance student engagement. The {{purpose of this study was}} to discover the perceptions of EFL instructional specialists concerning (a) student involvement and <b>engagement</b> in online <b>portions</b> of blended courses, (b) marginal teacher presence in the online portions of blended courses, and (c) ways to improve student involvement in the online portions of the blended courses. Results of a systematic qualitative analysis, employing constant comparative data analysis of individual interviews with a sample of 10 voluntary EFL instructional specialists, indicated teachers need to take part in design of blended EFL courses to address these issues. The findings, coupled with theoretical frameworks of social-constructivism, transactional distance, diffusion of innovation, and universal design for instruction, served as the background for a proposed teacher training project resulting from this study. The study can contribute to positive social change by inviting EFL teachers to become more involved in blended course design, increasing their sense of ownership, sharing best practices for blended EFL teaching and learning, and creating conditions for more successful upward social mobility opportunities for Chilean university students who have acquired certifiable English language skills...|$|R
