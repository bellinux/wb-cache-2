5|$|Flights from Earth {{to other}} planets in the Solar System {{have a high}} energy cost. It {{requires}} almost {{the same amount of}} energy for a spacecraft to reach Jupiter from Earth's orbit as it does to lift it into orbit in the first place. In astrodynamics, this energy expenditure is defined by the net change in the spacecraft's velocity, or delta-v. The energy needed to reach Jupiter from an Earth orbit requires a delta-v of about 9km/s, compared to the 9.0–9.5km/s to reach a low Earth orbit from the ground. Gravity assists through planetary flybys (such as by Earth or Venus) can be used to reduce the energetic requirement (i.e. the fuel) at launch, at the cost of a significantly longer flight duration to reach a target such as Jupiter when compared to the direct trajectory. Ion thrusters capable of a delta-v of more than 10 kilometers/s were used on the Dawn spacecraft. This <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>enough</b> delta-v to do a Jupiter fly-by mission from a solar orbit of the same radius as that of Earth without gravity assist.|$|E
5|$|The {{electron}} microscope directs a focused {{beam of electrons}} at a specimen. Some electrons change their properties, such as movement direction, angle, and relative phase and energy as the beam interacts with the material. Microscopists can record these changes in the electron beam to produce atomically resolved images of the material. In blue light, conventional optical microscopes have a diffraction-limited resolution of about 200nm. By comparison, {{electron microscope}}s are limited by the de Broglie wavelength of the electron. This wavelength, for example, is equal to 0.0037nm for electrons accelerated across a 100,000-volt potential. The Transmission Electron Aberration-Corrected Microscope is capable of sub-0.05nm resolution, which <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>enough</b> to resolve individual atoms. This capability makes the electron microscope a useful laboratory instrument for high resolution imaging. However, electron microscopes are expensive instruments that are costly to maintain.|$|E

25|$|For instance, in the ABA {{transfer}} system {{a group of}} say eight racers {{sign up for the}} 17-18 Intermediate class. That <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>enough</b> to have three motos (four is the minimum). Moto #1 will have all eight racers. The first two finishers qualify for and do not race again until the Main. Moto #2 will be a second heat for the remaining six racers; again, the first two across the finish line from that group will go the Main. Finally, a third moto of the remaining four riders is run, from which the first two racers across the finish line will be taken to the Main, forming a six-man Main. The last two racers do not qualify (DNQ) and therefore do not race in the Main, do not collect any points, trophies, a chance to take a step in advancement to a higher amateur level or if they are professionals, prize money.|$|E

A writer for the website Pretty Much Amazing classified the song's [...] "hooks" [...] as [...] "catchy-as-hell" [...] and the synthesizers as [...] "bouncy", and concluded the review by naming the song [...] "pop excellence".

He finally wrote that [...] "the result <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>enough</b> to keep our obsession rolling through yet another summer stretch".

500|$|... "The key to {{understanding}} Smith," [...] Johnson wrote, [...] "was that, like other white Rhodesians, he clung to an almost Victorian {{view of the world}} both in moral values and in the easy assumptions of British primacy that characterised the empire." [...] Bill Schwarz took a similar line, writing that Smith and his supporters reacted to the British Empire's demise by imagining white Rhodesians to be [...] "the final survivors of a lost civilisation", charged with [...] "tak on the mantle of historic Britain" [...] in the imperial power's absence. [...] "He spoke endlessly about how Rhodesians had been more British than the British," [...] Boynton reflected, [...] "and how this small community of decent, fair-minded whites had been betrayed by, well, just about everybody he could think of... It was easy to mock Ian Smith, but he was right—both about the betrayals and about the quality of most African politicians". Smith's [...] "not in 1,000 years" [...] quote dominated his obituaries, a development that Peter Godwin, despite his critical stance regarding Smith and his policies, considered [...] "unfair and inaccurate": [...] "Over the years it has become shorn of all context and compressed into a free-floating clip that has now become his epitaph... But there <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>enough</b> for which to quite legitimately criticise Smith, without resorting to fabrication." ...|$|E

2500|$|It {{was also}} used as a private {{treatment}} of heroin addiction, a purpose {{for which it was}} championed by the author William S. Burroughs. Burroughs and others claimed that it was a [...] "metabolic regulator" [...] with a restorative dimension to a damaged or dysfunctional dopaminergic system. There <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>enough</b> anecdotal evidence to suggest that this offers a plausible route to an abstinence based model; however, no clinical trials have ever tested this hypothesis. A recent study indicates that apomorphine might be a suitable marker for assessing central dopamine system alterations associated with chronic heroin consumption. There is, however, no clinical evidence that apomorphine is an effective and safe treatment regimen for opiate addiction. [...] Early studies involved aversion therapy in alcoholism and anxiety, and modern reports are anecdotal, although some practitioners claimed to be using non-aversive methods.|$|E

2500|$|Dry {{fly fishing}} {{is done with}} line and flies that float, joined by a leader, usually made of fine {{polyamide}} monofilament line. The tapered leader is 3 to 5 meters long, thus nearly invisible where the fly is knotted, and the angler can replace the last meter of nylon as required. Unlike sinking fly (nymph) fishing, the [...] "take" [...] on dry flies is visible, explosive and exciting. While trout typically consume about 90% of their diet from below-water sources, the 10% of surface-level consumption by trout <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>enough</b> to keep most anglers busy. Additionally, beginning fly anglers generally prefer dry fly fishing because of the relative ease of detecting a strike and the instant gratification of seeing a trout strike their fly. Nymph fishing may be more productive, but dry fly anglers soon become addicted to the surface strike.|$|E
