5|$|In a 1989 {{review of}} the {{research}} on juvenile <b>delinquency</b> and violence, Lisabeth DiLalla and Gottesman found <b>delinquency</b> could be transitory or continuous, and genes contributed more to the continuous type. In 1991 the same authors published a critique of the then-prevalent idea of antisocial behavior being transmitted through generations by child abuse alone in antisocial families. They stated that a review by Cathy Spatz Widom and the studies she cited had missed an element: children maltreated in families might have been targets because their genes might have influenced them into committing antisocial acts and attracting such treatment from parents.|$|E

5|$|The {{popularity}} and circulation of comic books about superheroes declined following World War II, and comic books about horror, crime and romance took larger {{shares of the}} market. However, controversy arose over alleged links between comic books and juvenile <b>delinquency,</b> focusing in particular on crime and horror titles. In 1954, publishers implemented the Comics Code Authority to regulate comic content.|$|E
40|$|Lenders’ {{evaluation}} of the hotel industry’s prospects can be assessed using a metric called the relative risk premium, which we introduce in this report. Similar to the canary in a coal mine, changes in the relative rates that lenders charge for hotel loans, as compared to those for office buildings, give an early warning of relative hotel loan <b>delinquencies.</b> This metric {{is based on the}} practice of lenders charging higher interest rates for hotel loans than on office buildings. The relative risk premium measure is defined as the interest rate on hotels minus interest rate on office buildings. Changes in this measure predict relative hotel loan <b>delinquencies</b> (<b>delinquencies</b> on hotel loans minus <b>delinquencies</b> on office building loans). Office loans are an appropriate benchmark to measure the relative health of hotel loans because office building occupancy has a relationship with the economy and with room-night demand. Spreads on hotel loans widen when lenders anticipate higher hotel <b>delinquencies</b> relative to offices and narrow during periods when relative <b>delinquencies</b> for hotels are expected to drop. We also find three other bellwethers for hotel delinquencies: an increase in the volatility of hotel REIT returns (risk), a negative shock to expected earnings forecasts (which signals lower expected future profitability), or an increase in unemployment. Interestingly, the converse situation doesn’t hold, and an increase in relative <b>delinquencies</b> is not useful in predicting a rise in the relative risk premium...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} effect of {{mortgage}} prepayment penalties on borrowers’ prepayments and <b>delinquencies</b> by exploiting a 2007 reform in Italy that reduced penalties on outstanding mortgages and banned penalties on newly-issued mortgages. Using a unique dataset of mortgages issued by a large Italian lender, we provide evidence that: 1) before the reform, mortgages issued to riskier borrowers included larger penalties; 2) higher prepayment penalties decreased borrowers’ prepayments; and 3) higher prepayment penalties did not affect borrowers’ <b>delinquencies.</b> Moreover, we find suggestive evidence that prepayment penalties affected mortgage pricing, as well as prepayments and <b>delinquencies</b> through borrowers’ mortgage selection at origination, most notably for riskier borrowers...|$|R
5|$|By 1954, the Comics Code Authority {{had been}} {{established}} in response to increasing public disapproval of comic book content. The backlash was inspired by Frederic Wertham, who hypothesized that mass media (especially comic books) {{was responsible for the}} rise in juvenile <b>delinquency,</b> violence and homosexuality, particularly in young males. Parents forbade their children from reading comic books, and there were several mass burnings. The Comics Code banned gore, innuendo and excessive violence, stripping Batman of his menace and transforming the Joker into a goofy, thieving trickster without his original homicidal tendencies.|$|E

5|$|The first {{science fiction}} magazine, Amazing Stories, {{appeared}} in 1926. By {{the end of}} the 1930s, the genre was flourishing in the United States, but World War II and its attendant paper shortages led to the demise of several magazines. In the late 1940s, the market began to recover. From a low of eight active US magazines in 1946, the field expanded to 20 just four years later. Galaxys appearance in 1950 was part of this boom. According to sf historian and critic Mike Ashley, its success was the main reason for a subsequent flood of new releases: 22 more science fiction magazines appeared by 1954, when the market dipped again as a side effect of US Senate hearings into the putative connection between comic books and juvenile <b>delinquency.</b>|$|E
5|$|By early April, pro-Heiner ads from Citizens for a Sound Government revived {{charges of}} taking bailouts and tax <b>delinquency</b> against Bevin and {{attacked}} Comer for accepting {{thousands of dollars}} in farm subsidies. Within days, the candidates appeared at a debate where Bevin challenged Heiner to publicly denounce the ads; Heiner responded with a silent smile. Bevin's public challenge to the ad prompted a Lexington television station to pull it after two weeks on the air. Bevin made a $200,000 combined television and radio ad buy to defend himself against the ads and began a telephone survey that touted his conservative credentials while highlighting Heiner's past positions on issues such as gun control before asking how these statements affect the person's view of each candidate. Heiner said the survey was a negative push poll, but Bevin insisted it was a legitimate poll. By the end of April, polls showed that Heiner's lead had evaporated and that the race was essentially a three-way dead heat between him, Bevin, and Comer.|$|E

5|$|Fortunately for Villiers, {{his case}} {{was not to}} be prosecuted with the utmost rigour. He was to some degree {{protected}} by the joint efforts of Boringdon's friends and the Whig George Tierney, as well as his own quick action in surrendering his property through writs of extent; and the <b>delinquency</b> of Joseph Hunt, Treasurer of the Ordnance attracted attention and saved Villiers from the full wrath of the finance committee. Their report on the matter noted that the writ of extent had been to the amount of £264,000, but only £91,000 had been raised from the sale of his property, and about £30,000 from securities and the bond posted for him when he took office. The committee recommended the abolition of the office of Paymaster of Marines and the transfer of its duties to the Treasurer of the Navy, a recommendation which was not immediately acted upon. Villiers was left, in Boringdon's estimation, with a debt of £1,500–2,000, an annual income of £2,000–3,000, and the property in Cranbourne Lodge.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{exposure}} in children is also correlated with neuropsychiatric {{disorders such as}} {{attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}} and anti-social behaviour. Elevated lead levels in children are correlated with higher scores on aggression and <b>delinquency</b> measures. A correlation has also been found between prenatal and early childhood lead exposure and violent crime in adulthood. Countries with the highest air lead levels have also been found to have the highest murder rates, after adjusting for confounding factors. A May 2000 study by economic consultant Rick Nevin theorizes that lead exposure explains 65% to 90% of the variation in violent crime rates in the US. A 2007 paper by the same author claims to show a strong association between preschool blood lead and subsequent crime rate trends over several decades across nine countries. Lead {{exposure in}} childhood appears to increase school suspensions and juvenile detention among boys. It is believed that the U.S. ban on lead paint in buildings in the late 1970s, as well as the phaseout of leaded gasoline in the 1970s and 1980s, partially helped contribute to the decline of violent crime in the United States since the early 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Spanning World War II, when American comics {{provided}} {{cheap and}} disposable escapist entertainment {{that could be}} read and then discarded by the troops, the Golden Age of comic books covered the late 1930s to the late 1940s. A number of major superheroes were created during this period, including Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Captain Marvel, and Captain America. In subsequent years comics were blamed for a rise in juvenile crime statistics, although this rise was shown to be {{in direct proportion to}} population growth. When juvenile offenders admitted to reading comics, it was seized on as a common denominator; one notable critic was Fredric Wertham, author of the book Seduction of the Innocent (1954), who attempted to shift the blame for juvenile <b>delinquency</b> from the parents of the children to the comic books they read. The result was a decline in the comics industry. To address public concerns, in 1954 the Comics Code Authority was created to regulate and curb violence in comics, marking {{the start of a new}} era.|$|E
40|$|With {{the farm}} boom ending in 2009, many farmers have become {{less able to}} repay {{short-term}} loans. As farm profit margins erode and farm loan <b>delinquencies</b> rise, some in the agricultural industry worry that lending standards will tighten—as {{they did in the}} farm debt crisis of the 1980 s.; One barometer of future agricultural credit conditions is agricultural bankers. Experience and access to information give these bankers a unique perspective on agricultural credit conditions. In fact, several Federal Reserve banks survey agricultural bankers in their district to tap this source of information. But how reliable are regional Federal Reserve agricultural credit surveys? And can a regional survey shed light on future loan <b>delinquencies</b> and credit standards nationwide?; Briggeman examines the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s Survey of Agricultural Credit Conditions to explore these questions. He concludes that the Survey of Agricultural Credit Conditions reliably predicts farm loan repayment rates in the district and provides valuable insight into future farm loan <b>delinquencies</b> and credit standards nationwide. The most recent Survey data suggest that the nation’s farm loan <b>delinquencies</b> will continue to rise in the year ahead, which may cause collateral requirements to stay elevated heading into 2010. ...|$|R

5|$|Upon {{repeal of}} Prohibition and {{the passage of}} the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, the ABC issued {{regulations}} that prohibited bars and liquor stores from selling alcohol to a person under 21, which was considered the age of majority at that time. In 1939, it became a criminal offense to sell alcohol to a person under 21, and for a person under 21 to purchase or consume alcohol in a licensed establishment. The state criminalized the underage possession of alcohol in motor vehicles and other public areas in 1957, possibly in response to young New Jerseyans traveling to New York, where the drinking age was 18, and returning home with liquor. For many years laws against underage drinking and the serving of alcohol to minors did not apply on private property, though an adult who supplied a substantial amount of liquor to an underage person could possibly be prosecuted for contributing to the <b>delinquency</b> of a minor Furthermore, arrests and criminal prosecutions for underage drinking in bars or public areas were very uncommon before the 1980s.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} loan pricing of risk {{in a market}} with short term leases (hotels) {{relative}} to longer term leases (office properties) with respect to how news on the economy, capital and real estate markets is incorporated in loan pricing using a vector autoregression (VAR) framework. The hotel loan pricing data provides a unique laboratory to study loan pricing adjustments given the short-term nature of the hotel leases. We examine the information content of hotel credit spreads in two stages. After establishing the impact of economic variables on loan pricing and the informational content of the incremental risk spread, we next examine how loan pricing adjusts in response to expected <b>delinquencies.</b> We find that improvement in general economic conditions, an increase in forward looking corporate profitability, an increase in capital availability and/or {{an increase in the}} demand for hotel services forecast a decline in the hotel risk premium differential. Thus, the relative loan prices—the spread—reflect systematic risk. We also find that hotel spreads themselves contain important economic information. Unexpected increases in hotel spreads predict hotel <b>delinquencies.</b> In other words, lenders appear to set interest rates on hotel mortgages in anticipation of hotel <b>delinquencies</b> and foreclosures in future periods.
