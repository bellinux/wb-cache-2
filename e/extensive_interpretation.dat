50|$|Most authors {{distinguish}} between comprehensive and <b>extensive</b> <b>interpretations.</b> The latter {{are held to}} bind only persons to whom they are directed, unless promulgated to the Universal Church, because, being extensive, they enforce a sense {{not included in the}} law and are equivalent to a new law; the former are held to bind all without need of promulgation, because the sense explained in a comprehensive interpretation being already included in the law, such decrees are not new laws and do not need further promulgation. Many canonists follow an opposite view; without distinguishing between comprehensive and <b>extensive</b> <b>interpretations,</b> they maintain that any decree interpreting a law in itself obscure and doubtful binds only those to whom it is directed, unless promulgated to the Universal Church. They base their opinion upon the doctrine that, when a law is in itself doubtful and obscure an authentic interpretation, i.e., a declaration obliging people to put that law into practice in a certain definite sense, is equivalent to a new law; hence the necessity of its promulgation. These authors, however, admit that no promulgation is necessary, either when the same declaration has been repeatedly given, so as to have established what is termed the Stylus Curiae (a custom similar to that mentioned above in connection with the authority of judicial sentences), or when the declaration in question, though given only once, has been universally accepted, so as to have become the common practice of the Church.|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{association}} between national identification and the endorsement of Kurdish minority rights amongst Kurds and Turks in Turkey, by examining the moderating effects of ethnic and civic conceptions of nationhood and ethnic identification on this relationship. It builds on previous research concerning ethnic and civic distinctions of nationhood by applying these concepts in an assimilationist society rather than on countries within the European context. It also builds on the social identity approach by including the role of ethnic identification as a moderator. Findings indicate {{that there is a}} directly negative effect of national identification on the endorsement of Kurdish minority rights, but that amongst both groups civic conceptions of nationhood decrease this negative effect. Among Turks, it was similarly found that ethnic conceptions of nationhood decrease the negative association between national identification and endorsement of minority rights. Among Kurds, ethnic and civic conceptions of nationhood did not moderate this relationship, indicating that research on more <b>extensive</b> <b>interpretations</b> of nationhood among minority group members in assimilationist societies is needed. This study serves as an example of alternative approaches to nationhood in assimilationist societies...|$|R
40|$|The {{right to}} self-defense {{is a central}} concept in {{international}} law and a fundamental principle in the system of states. It can be used only if the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) has not taken the necessary steps to maintain peace. Additionally,, a state which decides to exercise this right must keep the UNSC informed as to the measures it is implementing and the justification. However, most states seem {{to agree on the}} principles regulating {{the use of force in}} international relations, they frequently have different and sometimes divergent conceptions as to the meaning and the implications of the Genera Convention on Rules of War adopted in 1949. Consequently, the principles regulating the use of force are constantly being weakened by both conventional and customary international laws. State actors have therefore attempted to provide <b>extensive</b> <b>interpretations</b> of Article 51 of the United Nations Charter in order to broaden the normative content of the law on the use of force to suit their own polices.

5000|$|Urban {{agriculture}} {{is defined by}} the United Nations Development Programme as [...] "the growing, processing, and distribution of food and other products through intensive plant cultivation and animal husbandry in and around cities.” A more <b>extensive</b> <b>interpretation,</b> which considers multiple aspects of the pratice is described by The Council for Agriculture, Science and Technology as [...] "a complex system encompassing a spectrum of interests, from a traditional core of activities associated with the production, processing, marketing, distribution, and consumption, to a multiplicity of other benefits and services that are less widely acknowledged and documented. These include recreation and leisure; economic vitality and business entrepreneurship, individual health and well-being; community health and well-being; landscape beautification; and environmental restoration and remediation.” Urban agriculture localizes production and distribution of food, often with the larger goal of tackling food insecurity {{in a way that is}} environmentally and socially sustainable. In West Oakland, growing food on a small-scale, ecologically sustainable and socially-minded way is an effort to combat the Food Desert in West Oakland. West Oakland’s high levels of food insecurity stems from racial, ethnic, and socio-economic disparities- a history of poverty, unfulfilled industrialization, and environmental racism. As a result, urban {{agriculture is}} often connected to the larger movement for Food Justice.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThough Lake Whitefish are ecologically, {{culturally}} and economically important to aboriginal {{communities in the}} Northwest Territories, Canada, growth characteristics of the fish populations have not received <b>extensive</b> <b>interpretations,</b> resulting in a lack of quantitative information to support fisheries management efforts in subarctic great lake systems. The overall objective {{of this study is}} to investigate spatiotemporal variations of growth characteristics of Lake Whitefish populations in Great Slave Lake (GSL) from 1972 – 2009. Using hierarchical Bayesian statistics, we structured four candidate growth models: generalized (GGM), logistic (LGM), Gompertz (PGM), and von Bertalanffy (VBM), with four parameterization scenarios combining all possible options of varying or constant L∞ and K. In terms of deviance information criterion (DIC) and multimodel inference (MMI), the plausibility of the candidate models was evaluated to select the best combinations of growth models and the parameter scenarios. The GGM with varying L∞ and K best delineated the fish growth characteristics in almost all areas of GSL, while the fish growth model parameterized with constant L∞ and varying K performed best in the shallow western basin. The VGM where L∞ and K were varied partially described fish growth in the shallow waters. Applying the MMI-based growth analysis, we found that smaller and slower-growing fish were mainly distributed in deep waters, while larger and faster-growing fish inhabited shallow waters. These spatiotemporal variations of fish growth characteristics have been attributed to the presence of coupled impacts derived from both climate-driven and anthropogenic events...|$|R
40|$|This article {{assesses the}} extent to which the Ukrainian crisis has {{challenged}} our traditional understanding of international law. The first section reveals that no extension of the scope of Article 2 (4), which prohibits threat or use of force only in ‘international relations’, can be observed. Use of internal violence has been condemned, but by reference to other legal arguments. By contrast, the use of force by a rebel group, a secessionist party or by public authorities is not prohibited as such in general international law. In the second section, it is shown that Russia did not refer to a possible right to intervene in a civil war, but has rather invoked an intervention by invitation, in a first stage by what it considered the official Ukrainian authority (President Yanukovich), in a second by the government of a new (Crimean) state. However, these <b>extensive</b> <b>interpretations</b> of international law (allowing an intervention on the sole basis of a collapsed power or of a self-proclaimed government invitation) were never accepted by the community of states as a whole. The third section finally investigates the invocation of the ex injuria jus non oritur principle. Beyond a positive answer to the question of whether international law has been ‘confirmed rather than weakened’ by the events in Ukraine, it is argued that the Ukrainian crisis illustrates the persistent tensions that surround classical rules of international law, such as self-determination, territorial integrity and, more generally, non-intervention. info:eu-repo/semantics/inPres...|$|R
