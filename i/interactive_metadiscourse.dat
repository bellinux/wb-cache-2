40|$|Abstract—This study {{presents}} a qualitative, {{comparative study of}} <b>interactive</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> in the academic writing of two groups of Native speakers of English and Native speakers of Arabic doctorate students {{working in the field}} of linguistics. It investigates the writers ’ capability to deploy the propositional discourse and interpretations in a coherent and convincing way appropriate to the projected readers ’ comprehensive abilities. A small-scale sample of 80 ‘discussion ’ and ‘conclusion ’ chapters constitutes this corpus. This small-size corpus aligns with the contemporary trends in corpus-based work in the fields of English where smaller, more focused corpora, which have been set up for a specific research or pedagogical purpose, {{are much more likely to}} yield insights that are directly relevant to teaching and learning for specific purposes. Using Hyland's (2005) interpersonal model of metadiscourse, the discussion and conclusion chapters have been compared to examine the influence of intercultural and local institute academic culture contexts on the writers ’ use of <b>interactive</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> devices. The findings revealed a significant influence of the local institute culture on the Arab academic writing in most of the interactive subcategories.

40|$|Abstract. This study aims {{to examine}} the use of {{interactive}} and interactional metadiscursive features in ESP articles written by Iranian and English native speakers. The analysis is based on a corpus of 15 research articles from Persian-written and 15 from English-written in ESP field. The selected corpus was analyzed through the model suggested by Hyland (2005). Results of the study showed that both groups used interactive and interactional features in their articles. In both groups, writers used an <b>interactive</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> more than an interactional one. Moreover, there were significant differences on the particular occurrence of some categories in interactive and interactional features...|$|E
40|$|The {{title of}} this thesis is Interpersonal Metadiscourse Markers used in Michelle Obama Speech. It has two objectives. First, it is aimed at finding out the types of {{interpersonal}} metadiscourse markers in each sentences used in Michelle Obama Speech. Second, it is aimed to explain the functions of them. This research uses qualitative research, because the research does not give the numeral or statictics, but just depends on {{the knowledge of the}} researcher in analyzing the data. The data of this study were analyzed by using some steps; first, reading the speech transcript; second, identifying and classifying the interpersonal metadiscourse markers, then, describing the function of interpersonal metadiscourse markers, and the last steps is interpreting the data and drawing conclusion. The result showed that there are two categories of interpersonal metadiscourse markers used in Michelle Obama Speech; those are interactive and interactional metadiscourse. There are 165 (44, 2 %) <b>interactive</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> and 209 (55, 8 %) interactional metadiscourse. Kinds of <b>interactive</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> found in Michelle Obama Speech are 145 (38, 8 %) transitional which is the highest percentage, because transitional is conjunction that functions to relate one sentence with other sentences, next is 9 (2, 4 %) frame markers, then 7 (1, 8 %) code glosses and the last is 4 (1, 1 %) evidentials. Meanwhile, kinds of interactional metadiscourse found in Michelle Obama Speech are 40 (10, 7 %) hedges, 8 (2, 1 %) boosters, after that 135 (36 %) self mentions. Self Mentions is the dominant interactional metadiscourse, because when Michelle Obama speaks about her opinion, she gives statement to audience who became author for them and the last for interactional category is 26 (7, 0 %) engagement marker...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to seek two types of {{interpersonal}} model of Hyland (2005) used in conclusion sections of 30 Master Theses of English Teaching, English Literature, and English Translation written by male and female graduate students. These conclusion sections were categorized into two groups of male and female writers: 15 conclusion sections belonged to male writers and other 15 conclusion sections belonged to female writers. The <b>interactive</b> and interactional <b>metadiscourse</b> markers were counted and analyzed to find if male or female writers utilize these metadiscourse markers differently or similarly in conclusion sections of English disciplines (Translation, Teaching, and Literature). These metadiscourse markers were analyzed descriptively and referentially. The descriptive analysis show that both male and female writers in Translation, Teaching and Literature applied more interactional markers than interactive ones. In Translation and Teaching, female writers used more interactional resources comparing to male writers. But, in Literature, male writers employed more interactional markers than female writers. The referential statistics indicate that in English Translation and English Literature, there are significant differences between male and female writers concerning use of <b>Interactive</b> and Interactional <b>metadiscourse</b> Markers, while in English Teaching, there are not any significant differences between male and female writers regarding use of these metadiscourse Markers...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{illuminate}} the differences between Persian and English in online headlines in terms of applying metadiscourse markers in the first two months of the year 2015. To fulfill this purpose, 100 Persian and English online headlines (each 50 headlines) were chosen randomly from English and Persian newscasts such as VOA, CNN, Bistosi (20 : 30), and Bashgahkhabarnegaran. The specific research areas of interest was whether online Persian and English headlines differed in making use of metadiscourse markers. The corpus was recorded and divided in two groups of Persian online headlines and English online headlines. According to Hyland’s (2005) model, <b>interactive</b> and interactional <b>metadiscourse</b> markers were identified in online headlines. Corpus analysis showed that according to descriptive statistics, Persian and English were not significantly different in using metadiscourse markers in online headlines.

40|$|The {{original}} {{impetus for}} this cross-linguistic study {{came from a}} need to explore the effect of cultural factors and generic conventions on the use and distribution of metadiscourse within a single genre. To this end, the study as a contrastive rhetoric research, examined a corpus of 60 newspaper editorials (written in English and Persian) culled from 10 elite newspapers in America and Iran. Based on Hyland’s (2005) model of <b>metadiscourse,</b> both <b>interactive</b> and interactional <b>metadiscourse</b> resources were analyzed. The results disclosed that genre conventions had a determining role in the writers’ choice of some metadiscourse resources that contributed to some similarities in the use and distribution of metadiscourse resources across English and Persian data. In addition, some {{differences were found between}} two sets of editorials which were attributed to cultural/linguistic backgrounds of both groups of editorialists. The interactional category and attitude markers proved to be the predominant metadiscourse category and subcategory in newspaper editorials genre. Overall, the findings suggested that metadiscourse has a decisive role in the construction of persuasion in newspaper editorials genre...|$|R
40|$|Writing {{projects}} are socially-situated identities. The rhetorically-loaded aspects of writing, like metadiscourse marking, {{are more prone}} to carry such identities. Through analyzing metadiscourse strategies employment in Persian and English (as the lingua franca of academic discourse community) research articles, this study makes an attempt to find out whether Persian native writers take on the identity and norms of the discourse community in writing in their own language or preserve the cultural identity and norms of their native language. A comparison of 36 Persian and 36 English research articles showed that, on the whole, the norms of Persian language in the use of metadiscourse were {{different from that of the}} academic discourse community. Closer analysis revealed more similarities in the employment of <b>interactive</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> used to guide the readers, and significant differences in the use of interactional metadiscourse that could represent the specific cultural identity of the Persian writers...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} metadiscourse in the persuasive essays of fourth graders from both {{urban and rural}} communities: 224 students in South Korea and 188 in the US. Each student was asked to write a persuasive essay {{in his or her}} native Korean or English in response to a story not previously read or discussed. Analysis with a taxonomy developed by Hyland (2004) indicated significant differences in the metadiscourse by country. In terms of <b>interactive</b> <b>metadiscourse,</b> South Korean students used more sentence-level transitions than U. S. students, who used more frame markers and endophoric markers. With regard to interactional metadiscourse, U. S. students used more hedges, boosters, engagement markers, and self-mentions in their essays. This study also compared the students′ essays by the type of community in which the writers lived. In the US the essays of students in rural communities contained more hedges, whereas those of students in urban areas included significantly more self-mentions. In South Korea, no significant difference was detected in the metadiscourse of students living in rural and urban areas...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} a corpus of ninety discussion sections of applied linguistics research articles, {{with the goal}} of analyzing different aspects of academic written discourse. Three types of texts were considered: English texts written by native speakers of English, English texts written by Iranians (as non-natives of English), and Persian texts written by Iranians. In order to understand the cultural differences between Persian and English-speaking researchers, the following metadiscourse sub-types adapted from Hyland's (2004) model were examined: transitions, frame markers, endophoric markers, evidentials, code glosses, hedges, boosters, attitude markers, engagement markers, and self-mentions. The first five comprise <b>interactive</b> <b>metadiscourse,</b> and the rest comprise interactional metadiscourse. After the detailed analysis of the metadiscourse types in question, chi-square tests were carried out to clarify the probable differences. The analysis revealed how academic writings of these groups differed in their rhetorical strategies using metadiscourse type because of their respective mother tongues. However, the different groups were found to use all sub-types of metadiscourse. Yet, some subcategories were used differently by the writers of these two languages. In addition, interactive metadiscoursal factors (those resources which help to guide the reader through the text such as transitions, frame markers, etc.) were used significantly more than interactional metadiscoursal factors (those resources involve the reader in the argument such as hedges, boosters, etc.) by both groups...|$|E
40|$|Conference Theme: Corpus et Orbis - Interpreting the World through CorporaIn this paper, a {{corpus of}} 59, 20 - 25 -minute long, 5 -person group oral EAP {{assessments}} spanning 20 hours and 150, 309 words of L 1 Hong Kong L 2 English learner was constructed. The data, graded by teacher-raters as between A to C grades using an in-house can-do scale for successful academic stance, interaction and comprehensibility, was annotated for 22 error types, an exhaustive range of <b>interactive</b> and interpersonal <b>metadiscourse</b> (following Hyland, 2005) {{and a range}} of temporal, prosodic, lexical and syntactic markers (or 'fluencemes') of (dis) fluency (following Götz, 2013). The results suggest that successful, frequent use of metadiscourse (particularly engagement markers and topic shifts) is the primary indicator of raters' positive evaluation of student performance in L 2 academic tutorial discussion alongside temporal fluencemes (namely speech rate per minute). Identical repeats and errors of idiom / collocation are salient to raters' negative appraisals, while other L 2 errors and other individual prosodic (e. g. pauses), lexical (e. g. reformulations) and syntactic fluencemes (e. g. interrupted structures, dependent clauses) do not particularly feature in raters' positive (or negative) evaluations. The detailed cross-sectional data afforded via this kind of corpus analysis serves as quantitative evidence of the linguistic features involved in grading decisions across the rubric, which can (and should) be used in discussions of standardisation and moderation for the raters involved...|$|R
40|$|The {{topic of}} gender {{differences}} {{has proved to be}} a popular line of inquiry for researchers for decades, and the recent growing interest in the pervasive phenomenon of metadiscourse makes it a major domain in the research of discourse analysis and corpus-based analyses. This study extends the investigation of gender and metadiscourse to newspaper opinion columns. The study seeks to explore both gender and metadiscourse in media texts by analyzing a corpus of British and Saudi opinion columns. Using corpus-linguistics techniques, the study aims to investigate gender differences in the writings of men and women columnists regarding their use of metadiscourse and selected linguistic and stylistic features. Drawing on Hyland’s (2005) model of metadiscourse, the study further aims to compare the use of metadiscourse markers among both columnists in order to identify which categories predominate in this type of discourse and how they are distributed according to cultural preferences. The corpus consists of 320 opinion columns totaling 273, 773 words, selected from four elite newspapers. The columns were searched electronically using concordancing software programs and then all the metadiscourse devices were examined qualitatively in context to determine their actual functions. All frequencies reported have been normalized and tested statistically. Results confirmed that there were 33, 854 metadiscourse tokens in the corpus, an average of 105. 49 occurrences per column or 3 elements of metadiscourse in every 25 words in each of the two corpora. Findings revealed both male and female columnists showed more similarities than differences in their overall use of metadiscourse especially in the interactive dimension. In spite of that, some significant gender-based variations in the use of interactional dimension of metadiscourse were also found. Female columnists used more self-mentions, engagement markers, adjectives, pronouns, and adverbs than their male counterparts, and tended to adopt a personalized engaging subjective style that relies on personal experiences. In contrast, male columnists used more hedges, verbs, numerical terms, and swear words, and tended to adopt a more factual informative style. In addition, results revealed that both columnists made use of <b>interactive</b> and interactional <b>metadiscourse,</b> and some statistically significant variations in the amount and type of metadiscourse were reported. The study concludes that metadiscourse is a useful concept in the discourse of opinion columns and that gender is a significant source of variation that influences the linguistic and the stylistic choices of opinion columnists along with the genre’s conventions...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focused on}} {{challenges}} faced by non-native researchers writing their scientific papers for publication in English. To publish in peer-reviewed international mainstream journals, researchers {{should be able to}} write in a genre-specific and persuasive manner. Academic writing requires explicit organization of texts, caution in making claims, signposting connections, and creating coherence and clarity in the text. The research article (RA) is a key genre of scientific publishing with a special communicative and rhetorical structure. The structure and language of the RA partly depend on the disciplinary knowledge-making practices and writing conventions applied in the field of research. The subjects of this study were doctoral and post-doctoral researchers in Materials Science at Tampere University of Technology (TUT), all of them non-native speakers of English. The objective of the study was twofold: first, to explore the experiences, perceptions, attitudes, challenges, and wishes for further training of the researchers writing in English; second, to examine how they employed certain linguistic devices to present the results of their research. The study applied two methods to answer the research questions: an e-mailed questionnaire and a descriptive analysis of published sample RAs written by the subjects. Swales’ Create-A-Research-Space (CARS) model for RA introductions and Hyland’s model of <b>interactive</b> and interactional <b>metadiscourse</b> were used as investigative tools to study certain rhetorical and textual features. On the whole, the TUT respondents showed a positive attitude to writing in English. Approximately half of them felt disadvantaged in writing RAs when compared to native speakers. The researchers considered “creating text flow and coherence to make my reasoning easy to understand” and “expressing my interpretation of the results with an appropriate degree of confidence” most challenging. Both skills involve the ability to write reader-friendly and professionally convincing text. Most sample RAs followed the 3 -move rhetorical pattern of the CARS model. Most of the metadiscoursal items were interactive, which is characteristic of quantitative RAs in natural sciences and engineering. Overall, the writers employed a rather limited selection of metadiscoursal devices. Since proofreaders often pay attention only to obvious lexico-grammatical mistakes in scientific papers, an interactive system with early-stage consultation between writers and proofreaders can help to create persuasive and genre-specific argumentation. Discipline-based writing instruction and materials on textual and rhetorical organization beyond the sentence level could help writers to construct coherent texts...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Metadiscourse markers as rhetorical devices {{refer to}} ‘self-reflective {{linguistic}} expressions’ (Hyland, 2004) {{that make the}} writers more powerful in interaction. Since metadiscourse is a rhetorical device, it could be different based on the user’s culture and mother tongue. In this study, three groups of research articles including native English (NE), native Persian (NP), and non-native English (NNE) articles (written by Iranian academics) were analyzed based on Hyland and Tse’s (2004) taxonomy plus two metadiscourse strategies by Abdi et al. (2010). The {{difference between the two}} cultures of English and Persian represented in texts was examined in terms of the impact of English as L 2 on the non-native English research articles written by Iranian academic writers. To find the significant difference among the three corpora, the researchers used chi-square test. The findings of analyzing about 9000 lines of 26 published research articles on ELT and theoretical linguistics revealed the native Persian academic writers used <b>interactive</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> markers in their L 1 writings more than the native English and non-native English academic writers (Iranian) whereas they used the least number of interactional metadiscourse (with the exception of self mentions). It was interesting that Persian academic writers used the most number of interactional metadiscourse markers when they wrote in L 2 (English). Regarding the other variable of the study i. e. gender, the findings further proved no relevance between gender and metadiscourse marker...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to describe}} rhetorical moves, metadiscourse types and resources used {{to accompany the}} moves in English abstract section of undergraduate students’ (thesis) article at STKIP PGRI Jombang. Moreover, this research also explains how the metadiscourse functions are applied {{in relation to the}} moves. The method of this study is qualitative research. The data collected using non-participant observation method and note taking techniques were analyzed with the theory of rhetorical moves in abstracts and metadiscourse. The results show that from 42 abstracts, only few abstracts from science belong to informational abstracts. Humanities tends to use three moves with the pattern PMR (Purpose, Method, Results); meanwhile, science andsocial science tend to use four moves with the pattern BPMR (Background, Purpose, Method, Results). On the whole, interactional metadiscourse is infrequently used. In terms of functions of metadiscourse in relation to moves, discourse goal (sub-type of frame markers) characterizes Move 2. Then, the resources of boosters which characterize move 4 are show, found, obtained, embodied, and revealed. Conclude (resources of frame markers sub-type—discourse stage) characterizes move 5. Some metadiscourse types related to the moves applied are evidentials, hedges, boosters, attitude markers and self-mentions. There are also certain resources in certain metadiscourse types which exist in certain move such as the resource of transitions and code glosses. In conclusion, only few abstracts from science support support Day’s (1995) model. In the use of metadiscourse, the use of <b>interactive</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> is dominant. From 10 types of metadiscourse, transitions are frequently employed...|$|E
