2500|$|Although known {{mostly as}} a {{photographer}} and model, Matuschka's works on paper and canvas remain a constant and essential element of her art. Since {{the turn of the}} century she has returned to abstraction, her primary art form. She credits the artist Jennifer Bartlett, who taught her to be responsible for <b>every</b> <b>square</b> <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> the surface one's working on. When she began studying at SVA, she switched from figurative work to abstract painting. [...] "I wouldn't have discovered my main infatuation, or jazz, if not for Jennifer", the artist once wrote.|$|E
2500|$|Abrahamson {{used only}} one Room set, wanting {{to create an}} {{authentic}} experience for Tremblay. The set, built on a soundstage at Pinewood Toronto Studios, was [...] To design it, Abrahamson hired Montreal production designer Ethan Tobman, who set out with the idea [...] "that <b>every</b> <b>square</b> <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> Room needed to have a backstory." [...] To fit the crew and equipment into the small space, he made each piece of the set removable. However, as Abrahamson and cinematographer Danny Cohen wanted the camera to always shoot scenes from inside Room, the lens was always positioned within the set even {{if the rest of}} the camera was outside. There were as many as eight cameramen at a time inside the Room set with Larson and Tremblay. The actors also made the props decorating the set.|$|E
60|$|Tapestries, he said, {{were to the}} North of Europe what fresco was to the South--our climate, amongst other reasons, guiding us in {{our choice}} of {{material}} for wall-covering. England, France, and Flanders were the three great tapestry countries--Flanders with its great wool trade being the first in splendid colours and superb Gothic design. The keynote of tapestry, the secret of its loveliness, was, he told the audience, the complete filling up <b>of</b> <b>every</b> corner and <b>square</b> <b>inch</b> <b>of</b> surface with lovely and fanciful and suggestive design. Hence the wonder of those great Gothic tapestries where the forest trees rise in different places, one over the other, each leaf perfect in its shape and colour and decorative value, while in simple raiment of beautiful design knights and ladies wandered in rich flower gardens, and rode with hawk on wrist through long green arcades, and sat listening to lute and viol in blossom- starred bowers or by cool gracious water springs. Upon the other hand, when the Gothic feeling died away, and Boucher and others began to design, they gave us wide expanses of waste sky, elaborate perspective, posing nymphs and shallow artificial treatment. Indeed, Boucher met with scant mercy at Mr. Morris's vigorous hands and was roundly abused, and modern Gobelins, with M. Bougereau's cartoons, fared no better.|$|R

Bradley crooked his finger upon {{the opposite side of the}} panel and pulled toward him, steadily but with considerable force.
