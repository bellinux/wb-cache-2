25|$|In 2003 the Russian {{historian}} V. Totfalushin found {{a document}} in the Russian State <b>Historical</b> <b>Archives</b> which casts doubts on Savin’s claimed age and provides some interesting details about him. The document is {{an excerpt from}} the official memo by the Russian Minister of Internal Affairs on the status of the surviving veterans of the Grande Armée still residing in Russia. According to this document, dated 1834, the French authorities had contacted the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs with a note that Nicolas Savin had requested permission to leave Russia and return home. The memo specifies that, according to the French authorities, Savin was born in Rouen, in Normandy, and had served as a non-commissioned officer in the 24th Chasseurs à Cheval before being captured in 1812 and sent to Saratov, where he had gained Russian citizenship (poddanstvo) in 1813. The memo further notes that in 1816 Savin had married the daughter of a local merchant and had had two sons, Pavel (born in 1821) and Alexander (born in 1828), and two daughters, Avdotia (born in 1823) and Akulina (born in 1825). Totfalushin’s research also questions Savin’s final age, noting that in another document, which Savin submitted to the local authorities in Khvalynsk in 1839, he indicated that he was 52 years old, which means he was born about 1787.|$|E

500|$|The {{extensive}} <b>historical</b> <b>archives</b> of the North-West Mounted Police {{were combined}} {{with those of}} its successor, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), in 1920, although the early archives from 1873 to 1885 had been destroyed in a fire in 1897. For most of the 20th century, the RCMP kept most of these <b>historical</b> <b>archives</b> closed, with the material inaccessible except to selected researchers, trusted to maintain a particular perspective on the police's history. Historians had few other sources {{to work with other}} than the force's own published annual accounts, autobiographies by members of the police, and popular narratives from the 19th century, and so their works tended to mirror the established image of the mounted police.
