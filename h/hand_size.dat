25|$|Different populations within Cape Dwarf Chameleons {{were found}} to have {{different}} preferences regarding Perch Diameter. The two main populations, Kogelberg and Stellenbosch, were seen to have different behavior. Kogelberg tended to use perches that were significantly wider on average than perches used by the Stellenbosch site which chose perches by random. <b>Hand</b> <b>size</b> has a direct correlation with grip strength on both broad and narrow dowels, rod-like structures, in both populations. The longer the tail length, the greater the strength. This species prefers to sleep on perches of specific diameters that correspond to their specific morphology. Animals from habitats characterized by wider perches are also stronger than their counterparts living in habitats with narrow branches. This has led to sexual selection for chameleons with specific traits like <b>hand</b> <b>size</b> and tail length.|$|E
25|$|At the January 2011 Senior Bowl weigh-in, Carimi was the second-tallest {{player at}} 6 feet 7⅛ inches (2.01 m), had the second-longest arms (35¼inches), {{and had the}} second-longest {{wingspan}} (83¼inches; second to Mississippi State’s Derek Sherrod). His <b>hand</b> <b>size</b> was 10⅜inches, and he weighed in at 315 pounds, 10 pounds lighter than his playing weight in college. ESPN analysts rated him the third-best player at the Senior Bowl.|$|E
25|$|Battle Magnus {{make up the}} characters' decks. Outside of battle, {{the player}} assembles a deck of Magnus for each party member, from {{which he or she}} draws random hands during {{subsequent}} combats. <b>Hand</b> <b>size,</b> deck size and maximum combo size increase as the player upgrades the party members' class by finding character-specific Magnus and having them applied at the church. Weapon cards are used to fight with, Armor cards to block with, and Effect cards cause different effects, such as healing. Each Magnus has a Spirit Number in the corner ranging from 1-9. The Spirit Numbers are utilized during battle in order to create straights and same-number groupings (pairs, three-of-a-kinds, etc.), resulting in an increased damage effect. On cards with multiple spirit numbers, the player can select which number they want to use by rolling the C-stick.|$|E

5000|$|Some decks contain [...] "special rules" [...] which {{alter the}} basic ones. These may {{decrease}} <b>hand</b> <b>sizes</b> to three cards, for example, or may even create a card type other than Actions and Things. While infinitely versatile, these {{are most often}} used to tell players how to win.|$|R
50|$|Both the VP9 and VP40 use Heckler & Koch's {{ergonomic}} handgun grip {{design that}} includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels {{that allow the}} pistol's to fit any and all <b>hand</b> <b>sizes.</b> Molded finger grooves {{in the front of}} the pistol's grip also instinctively position the shooters hand for optimal shooting.|$|R

5000|$|Beyond that, if one card denies {{something}} and another permits it, the denial takes precedence (e.g., [...] "nobody can draw cards" [...] trumps [...] "draw a card"). If cards contradict {{each other on}} the same issue, the more specific one takes precedence (e.g., [...] "this player's <b>hand</b> <b>size</b> is seven" [...] trumps [...] "everyone's <b>hand</b> <b>size</b> is four"). Finally, if contradictory cards are equally specific, the last-played one takes precedence.|$|E

There is no one set size for furoshiki, they can range from <b>hand</b> <b>sized</b> to larger than bed-sheets. The most common sizes are 45 cm (17.7 inch) and 68-72 cm (26.7-28.3 inch).|$|R

50|$|Once {{the second}} phase is over (you {{do not want to}} or cannot play any more cards), then you must discard from your hand any cards {{exceeding}} your <b>hand</b> <b>size</b> limit. The <b>hand</b> <b>size</b> limit of a player (at the end of his turn) is equal to the number of bullets currently shown on the card that lies under his character card. Then it is the next player's turn, in clockwise order.|$|E
50|$|The 110 BA {{also comes}} stock with a Heckler & Koch PSG1 style pistol grip. The grip is a target-type grip which {{contains}} an adjustable palm shelf. A hex bolt {{rather than a}} rotating dial tightens or loosens the palm shelf.

40|$|Hand dexterity {{is crucial}} for humans to {{interactions}} with the external environment. Many {{activities of daily living}} (ADLs) such as pressing, grasping, writing and typing would be unattainable without a skillfully and proficiently functioning hand. Sexagenarians and older often experience difficulties in hand dexterity, which seriously impair their ability to perform ADLs. This study described the aging-related changes in <b>hand</b> muscle <b>size</b> and dexterity; and addressed the conflicting literature regarding the extent of atrophy to either the intrinsic or extrinsic hand muscles in the elderly. The overall hypotheses for this study were 1) that elderly adults show an aging-related decrease in <b>hand</b> muscle <b>size</b> and strength, especially a greater decrease in the intrinsic hand muscles, 2) elderly adults show an aging-related decrease in hand dexterity and 3) <b>hand</b> muscle <b>size</b> and strength are positively related to hand dexterity. This study examined <b>hand</b> muscle <b>sizes</b> with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and examined hand strength and other functional measures. This study found aging-related decreases in muscle <b>size,</b> muscle strength, <b>hand</b> dexterity. Furthermore, intrinsic muscles showed a greater aging-related decrease in volume and strength a...|$|R

50|$|The U.S. Army {{initially}} {{required the}} MHS {{to be more}} effective, accurate, and reliable than the M9 pistol.

The weapon will fit various <b>hand</b> <b>sizes</b> and will mount targeting enablers using Picatinny rails.
