5|$|At 9a.m. on July4, Berger {{left her}} {{apartment}} for the Mother Earth offices. Fifteen minutes later a deadly explosion took place. The bomb <b>had</b> <b>exploded</b> prematurely, shaking the sixth story of Berger's tenement building, wrecking the three upper floors and killing Berg, Caron, Hanson, and a woman, Marie Chavez, who apparently {{was not involved}} in the conspiracy. Berkman arranged the dead men's funerals.|$|E
5|$|On 13 August 1994, a bomb {{planted by}} the IRA near the pier was defused by a {{controlled}} explosion. A similar bomb {{by the same}} perpetrators <b>had</b> <b>exploded</b> in Bognor Regis on the same day. The bombing was intended to mark the 25th anniversary of the start of The Troubles. The pier was closed for several days owing to police investigation.|$|E
5|$|For the {{interior}} scenes used {{to depict the}} first moments of the Impala being hit, the actors were required {{to sit in the}} car in front of a blue screen; this allowed for the truck's headlights to later be added in with visual effects. The car itself was attached to a separate rig that was built to replicate the impact of the crash. As the scene was shot, the rig flipped the car onto its side. The passenger-side window was then shattered, though the actors were protected by a sheet of Lexan that had been placed very close to the window; at the same time, cannons beneath the frame blew out pieces of rubber glass to give the appearance that the window <b>had</b> <b>exploded</b> onto them.|$|E

5|$|Initial aerial firing {{tests with}} the Vulcan cannon {{on the second}} {{aircraft}} were successful, but on 17 December, {{there was an explosion}} during a firing burst and the J65 engine suffered severe compressor stalls. Tony LeVier immediately shut down the engine and glided back to make a successful deadstick landing at Rogers Dry Lake. An investigation later showed that one of the 20mm cannon rounds <b>had</b> <b>exploded</b> in the breech, blowing the bolt out the rear of the gun and through the structure into the forward fuselage fuel cell. Jet fuel had run into the gun bay, and leaked out of the compartment door seals and into the left engine air intake. The engine immediately flooded with fuel, causing the compressor stalls.|$|E
5|$|The {{intensity}} of the fire fed by pure oxygen caused the pressure to rise to , which ruptured the Command Module's inner wall at 6:31:19 (23:31:19 GMT, initial phase of the fire). Flames and gases then rushed outside the Command Module through open access panels to two levels of the pad service structure. Intense heat, dense smoke, and ineffective gas masks designed for toxic fumes rather than heavy smoke hampered the ground crew's attempts to rescue the men. There were fears the Command Module <b>had</b> <b>exploded,</b> or soon would, and that the fire might ignite the solid fuel rocket in the launch escape tower above the Command Module, which would have likely killed nearby ground personnel, and possibly have destroyed the pad.|$|E
5|$|The video focuses {{solely on}} lead singer, Jason Wade, {{as the rest}} of the band members do not appear in the video. The video begins by showing Wade sitting alone on a bed, with {{pictures}} of him and his girlfriend on the wall. He proceeds to walk around the house, while various things in the room he's in begin to explode around him, such as the bed and pictures in the bedroom, and various food and drink items in the kitchen. Near the end things begin going in reverse, and everything that <b>had</b> <b>exploded</b> is put back together. The video ends with Wade sitting back on the bed with his girlfriend now lying next to him.|$|E

5|$|In June 1943, Mayer {{encountered}} Robert S. Johnson, {{a future}} ace from the 56th Fighter Group of the US Eighth Air Force. Johnson's P-47 Thunderbolt had been badly shot-up by some Focke Wulf Fw 190s during a routine mission. As Johnson limped home, with a canopy {{that would not}} open and hydraulic fluid and oil covering his windscreen, Mayer pulled alongside him in his Fw 190. Mayer looked the wounded P-47 over, and then circled to come in from Johnson's six-o'clock {{to give it the}} coup de grâce. The first gun pass failed to knock the heavy American fighter out of the sky. Mayer made two more runs on Johnson, without success. After running out of ammunition, Mayer pulled alongside Johnson, saluted him and headed for home. Johnson landed his plane, and counted more than 200 holes, without even moving around the airplane. He also saw that a 20mm cannon shell <b>had</b> <b>exploded</b> just behind his headrest, which had made it impossible to open his canopy.|$|E
5|$|Nico Rosberg {{made his}} pit stop shortly thereafter, {{putting on the}} soft {{compound}} tyre, while Hamilton stayed out. In the meantime, Vettel had moved up into third place, right behind his teammate Räikkönen. Hamilton came into the pitlane on lap 22, and problems with his stop saw him lose position to Rosberg. Räikkönen briefly led the race but followed suit one lap later and made a pit stop, only to come out behind both Red Bull drivers. More trouble was ahead for Ferrari, as Vettel, {{who was in the}} lead at that point, retired on lap 27, when he crashed into the barriers after his rear right tyre <b>had</b> <b>exploded.</b> This incident sent the safety car out, bringing the field back together. Rosberg was now leading the race from Hamilton, Verstappen, Ricciardo and Räikkönen.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Navy {{conducted}} two inquiries {{into the}} reasons for the ship's quick demise. The first, held soon after the ship's loss, concluded that Hoods aft magazine <b>had</b> <b>exploded</b> after one of Bismarcks shells penetrated the ship's armour. A second inquiry was held after complaints that the first board had failed to consider alternative explanations, such as an explosion of the ship's torpedoes. It was more thorough than the first board and concurred with the first board's conclusion. Despite the official explanation, some historians continued to believe that the torpedoes caused the ship's loss, while others proposed an accidental explosion inside one of the ship's gun turrets that reached down into the magazine. Other historians have concentrated on the cause of the magazine explosion. The discovery of the ship's wreck in 2001 confirmed the conclusion of both boards, although the exact reason the magazines detonated is likely to remain unknown since that area of the ship was destroyed in the explosion.|$|E

5|$|The {{culmination}} of Thor missile training was {{to participate in}} a missile launch. Originally it was intended that all Thor missile crews would carry out at least one launch, but it soon became apparent that the cost would be prohibitive. Nonetheless, 21 RAF crews visited the United States for training, culminating in operational training launches from Vandenberg. This was known as Integrated Weapons System Training (IWST). The first of these launches was a launch codenamed Lions Roar. Despite the fact that a Thor missile <b>had</b> <b>exploded</b> on the launch pad just a few days before, the launch was viewed by dignitaries including Brigadier Godfrey Hobbs, the Director of Public Relations at the Ministry of Defence; Air Vice-Marshal Walter Sheen, the RAF commander at the British Joint Staff Mission; and Air Vice-Marshal Augustus Walker, the commander of No. 1 Group. After delays due to weather and technical problems, the missile was successfully launched on 16 April 1959. In all, there were nine IWST launches, the last of which, codenamed Red Caboose, was on 21 January 1960.|$|E
