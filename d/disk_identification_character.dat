40|$|Flow is {{a concept}} used to {{describe}} the pleasurable immersion that individuals experience, often in recreational activities such as video games. A key component in many video games is the player's avatar; through which the player experiences the game world and game play. Past theory suggests that flow and the identification of a player with their avatar are vital aspects of video games and it is this that differentiates them from other forms of media. However, research on the relationship between flow and avatar/character identification is in its infancy. This study aimed to further examine these two concepts and their relationship within video games. This study consisted of 306 participants, who completed a series of self-report questionnaires online. As hypothesised, it was found that <b>character</b> <b>identification</b> was strongly and positively related to flow. It was also found that only the video game specific characteristics of similarity to character and customisation were negatively and positively related to flow respectively. Furthermore, similarity but not customisation was related to <b>character</b> <b>identification,</b> and that similarity was strongly and positively related to <b>character</b> <b>identification.</b> Other findings include Openness to Experience being positively related to <b>character</b> <b>identification,</b> and Extraversion being negatively related to <b>character</b> <b>identification.</b> 9 page(s...|$|R

Researchers Cote and Allahar (1996), Bennett (1994), and Buchmann (1989) have identified mass media as a key contributor to this new transitional life stage, specifically discussing the influential potential of television. As individuals identify with various televised content, fictional characters establish role models that individuals then emulate. The series Friends, in particular, portrayed this Twixter life stage. This thesis addresses Kelman 2 ̆ 7 s (1961) theory of identification {{as it relates to}} the series Friends by interviewing 14 women who demographically fit within the Twixter life stage. Four prominent themes emerged: Initial <b>identification,</b> <b>character</b> <b>identification,</b> episode identification and life stage identification. It was found that the initial draw to the series was a strong <b>identification</b> with the <b>characters</b> as quasi-mentors, the characters relationships or the socialization of the series among their peers. It was this initial interpersonal attraction that precipitated avid viewership and built a parasocial relationship which interviewing evidenced each woman 2 ̆ 7 s strong <b>identification</b> with the <b>characters,</b> events within various episodes and particularly the life stage of the characters. As Friends reflected the Twixter life stage, the majority of the women disclosed that they perceived their life stage as similar to the life stage of the characters on Friends, strongly supporting the premise that identification is the key to influence...|$|R
