5|$|After {{creating}} custom plugins for the 3D {{computer graphics}} software, Burrows {{claimed that the}} team could create and test entire race tracks within five minutes. The custom plugin used for creating tracks consisted of a 450 <b>kilobyte</b> file, which contained polygon subdividing and data on artificial intelligence, effectively cutting down the time to create tracks from six hours to five minutes. In order to the play the game as soon as possible, the team developed the user interface in the XML markup language, which allowed revisions {{to be made for}} the content at any time. However, Burrows recalled that the only downside to converting everything to XML was that the game was always in danger of becoming too large for the PlayStation Portable's Universal Media Disc. The game's cover art was designed by Popgun, who also designed the logos for games released by EA Sports.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} ways to {{represent}} tries, corresponding to different trade-offs between memory use and speed of the operations. The basic form is that of a linked set of nodes, where each node contains an array of child pointers, one for each symbol in the alphabet (so for the English alphabet, one would store 26 child pointers and for the alphabet of bytes, 256 pointers). This is simple but wasteful in terms of memory: using the alphabet of bytes (size 256) and four-byte pointers, each node requires a <b>kilobyte</b> of storage, and when there is little overlap in the strings' prefixes, the number of required nodes is roughly the combined length of the stored strings. Put another way, the nodes {{near the bottom of the}} tree tend to have few children and there are many of them, so the structure wastes space storing null pointers.|$|E

50|$|An unusual {{feature of}} the Z-2 was switch-selectable CPU speed; 250 or 500 {{nanosecond}} cycle time were available. The ZPU speed was 4 MHz {{at a time when}} less than 2 MHz was normal, and boards from other manufacturers might still require the slower speed. The ZPU card in the Z-2 could address up to 64 <b>kilobytes</b> of RAM. However, the 16KZ memory card supported bank-switching with 8 banks of 64 <b>kilobytes</b> each. When using the 16KZ, the maximum RAM of the Z-2 was limited by the available S-100 slots. If 16 of the slots were occupied by 16KZ cards, then the system had 4 banks of 64 <b>kilobytes</b> each, for a total of 256 <b>kilobytes.</b>|$|R

2500|$|The problem started {{because on}} both {{mainframe}} computers and later personal computers, storage was expensive, from {{as low as}} $10 per <b>kilobyte,</b> to in many cases as much as or even more than US$100 per <b>kilobyte.</b> It was therefore very important for programmers to reduce usage. Since programs could simply prefix [...] "19" [...] to the year of a date, most programs internally used, or stored on disc or tape, data files where the date format was six digits, in the form MMDDYY, MM as two digits for the month, DD as two digits for the day, and YY as two digits for the year. As space on disc and tape was also expensive, this also saved money by reducing the size of stored data files and data bases.|$|E

2500|$|The set of binary prefixes {{that were}} {{eventually}} adopted, now {{referred to as}} the [...] "IEC prefixes", bytes of RAM, one gibibyte or 1GiB of RAM is 10243 bytes, and so on. were first proposed by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry's (IUPAC) Interdivisional Committee on Nomenclature and Symbols (IDCNS) in 1995. At that time, it was proposed that the terms <b>kilobyte</b> and megabyte be used only for 103 bytes and 106 bytes, respectively. The new prefixes kibi (kilobinary), mebi (megabinary), gibi (gigabinary) and tebi (terabinary) were also proposed at the time, and the proposed symbols for the prefixes were kb, Mb, Gb and Tb respectively, rather than Ki, Mi, Gi and Ti. The proposal was not accepted at the time.|$|E
2500|$|The use of {{the same}} unit prefixes with two {{different}} meanings has caused confusion.

[...] Accordingly, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) requires that SI prefixes only be used in the decimal sense: <b>kilobyte</b> and megabyte denote one thousand bytes and one million bytes respectively (consistent with SI), while new terms such as kibibyte, mebibyte and gibibyte, having the symbols KiB, MiB, and GiB, denote 1024 bytes, [...] bytes, and [...] bytes, respectively.

It was similar in this to machines produced by SWTPC, Gimix, and several other suppliers. TSC produced a Unix-like operating system uniFlex which ran only on such machines. OS-9 Level II, also took advantage of such memory management facilities.

5000|$|The <b>kilobyte</b> is a {{multiple}} of the unit byte for digital information.

In information technology, particularly in reference to main memory capacity, <b>kilobyte</b> is traditionally used to denote 1024 (210) bytes.
