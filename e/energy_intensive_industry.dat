We first represent both <b>energy</b> <b>intensive</b> and <b>energy</b> sector <b>industries</b> visually through network diagrams for the years 1997, 2002, and 2007.

40|$|<b>Energy</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>industries</b> {{are one of}} {{the fields}} in which strong {{increases}} of energy efficiency and deep decarbonisation strategies are particularly challenging. Although European <b>energy</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>industries</b> have already achieved significant energy and greenhouse gas reductions in the past, much remains to be done to make a significant contribution to achieving European as well as national climate mitigation targets of greenhouse gas emission reductions by - 80 % or more (compared to the baseline of 1990). North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) is a European hotspot for coping with this challenge, accommodating more than 10 % of the <b>energy</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>industries</b> of the EU 28. It is also the first German state to have adopted its own Climate Law, enacting state-wide CO 2 emission reductions by 80 % until 2050 compared to 1990. The state government initiated the project "Platform Climate Protection and Industry North-Rhine Westphalia" to identify and develop the necessary far-reaching low carbon innovation strategies for <b>energy</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>industries.</b> Heart of the project was a dialogue process, which involved a broad spectrum of stakeholders from steel, chemical, aluminium, cement, glass and paper producing industries. Besides enhancing and broadening the knowledge on high efficiency and low-carbon technologies within industries, the aim was to explore possible pathways and preconditions for the application of these technologies in <b>energy</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>industries</b> as well as to strengthen the motivation of companies for initiatives and investments in technologies with lower CO 2 emissions. The results of the dialogue shall provide a basis for a possible low-carbon industry roadmap NRW and may also serve as an example for other industrialized regions in the EU and globally.

These include existing limitations as well as chances in the respective sectors on the state level, regarding their economic and technical structures as well as their innovation systems.

40|$|The {{allocation}} {{rules for}} phase one EU ETS emissions permits demonstrates that energy generators were lobbying winners because they successfully blocked differential treatment (rules) from <b>energy</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>industries,</b> who cannot pass-on real or nominal costs of permits to consumers. As a result, these generators benefited from windfall profits. In phase three, {{the reverse is}} true; <b>energy</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>industries</b> successfully established differential rules. These rules will provide <b>energy</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>industries</b> with free allocations while most generators {{will be subject to}} 100 per cent auctioning, thus removing the windfall profit mechanism for generators. Literature applying public choice theory to this case study predicted free permit allocations but not windfall profits for generators nor the change in allocation rules in phase three. This paper presents the argument that a shift in Wilson’s Typology from client to interest group politics best explains these changes and provides a good framework for other jurisdictions considering emissions trading reforms. This dynamism in Wilson’s Typology is demonstrated by comparing the positions of industry associations representing energy generators and <b>energy</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>industries</b> with the two directives before and after consultations, which facilitates the identification of lobbying winners and losers. The EU ETS case study is fertile ground for testing regulatory theories that explain shifts away from clientelist policies with high levels of rent-seeking and towards more optimal policy equilibriums. This paper provides both a theoretical framework and empirical evidence for how emissions trading policy can be improved, despite rent-seeking, once it clears the legislative hurdle...|$|R

40|$|Managing {{energy demand}} is {{essential}} to energy security and climate change mitigation. The industrial sector accounts for over a fifth of UK primary energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions. <b>Energy</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>industry</b> is uniquely restricted {{in the way it}} uses energy and emits greenhouse gasses. In this thesis, the potential of radical measures to achieve significant energy demand reduction and emissions abatement in UK <b>energy</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>industry</b> is assessed. Adopted is a multidisciplinary approach combining thermodynamic and techno-economic analysis techniques. Bottom-up assessments are applied to key energy intensive sectors of industry to capture the diverse and interactive array of technological characteristics invisible from a top-down perspective. Detailed projection models are built to design and analyse technology roadmaps for the sectors out to 2050. In an illustrative roadmap assessment, the technological pathways of radical process transition and carbon sequestration were each shown to achieve about 80 % abatement in 2050 from 1990 emissions levels. Radical process transition achieved greater abatement before 2030 and this was reflected in lower cumulative emissions over the full period. Higher risk is associated with carbon sequestration from its reliance on timely access to CO 2 transport and storage technology to compensate for lower short-medium term abatement. Although, combining carbon sequestration with high levels of biomass combustion indicated the largest potential abatement to 2050. Abatement economics in the iron and steel sector are notably sensitive to resource costs and the carbon trading price. The carbon trading price influences relative production costs in favour of higher abating pathways, but increases absolute costs. This signals the need for supportive policy measures that accelerate technology development and deployment while mitigating the risk of the carbon trading price to competitiveness. Some carbon capture technologies reduce relative production cost {{even in the absence of}} a carbon price, but this excludes the cost of CO 2 transport and storage. Meanwhile, radical process transition pathways have a higher dependence on the future prices of natural gas, electricity, and scrap. Future work should focus on expanding the economic appraisal to other sectors and to indirect costs, as well as incorporating wider material efficiency strategies and running different future scenarios...|$|E
