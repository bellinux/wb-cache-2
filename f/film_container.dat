50|$|The Glen cinema {{was opened}} in 1901 {{then known as}} ‘The Glen’ and ‘The Royal Animated Pictures’. On the {{afternoon}} of 31 December 1929, during a children's matinee, a freshly shown film was put in its metal can, in the spool room, where it began to issue thick black smoke. Nitrocellulose film, as used at this time, can burn on its own without needing any supply of air. When an assistant film operator spotted the smoke coming from a <b>film</b> <b>container,</b> he tried to smother the flammable film but the container sprang open and smoke and fumes entered the hall. Soon the smoke filled the auditorium containing about one thousand children. Panic set in. Children ran downstairs so fast and in such numbers that they piled up behind the escape door which led to Dyers Wynd. The door could not be opened, as {{it was designed to}} open inwards and was padlocked. The following day, Paisley was stunned by the news that seventy children had died in the crush in the worst cinema disaster in British history.|$|E

50|$|The {{producers}} nearly {{suffered a}} catastrophe following {{the filming of}} the bridge explosion. To ensure they captured the one-time event, multiple cameras from several angles were used. Ordinarily, the film would have been taken by boat to London, but due to the Suez crisis this was impossible; therefore the film was taken by air freight. When the shipment failed to arrive in London, a worldwide search was undertaken. To the producers' horror the <b>film</b> <b>containers</b> were found a week later on an airport tarmac in Cairo, sitting in the hot sun. Although it was not exposed to sunlight, the heat-sensitive colour film stock should have been hopelessly ruined; however, when processed the shots were perfect and appeared in the film.|$|R
50|$|To {{fulfill its}} {{reconnaissance}} role, the XF-12 contained three separate photographic compartments aft of the wing. One vertical, one split vertical, and one trimetrogon each using a six-inch Fairchild K-17 camera. For night reconnaissance missions, the XF-12 {{had a large}} hold in the belly which accommodated 18 high-intensity photo-flash bombs; these were ejected over the target area. All of the bays were equipped with electrically operated, inward retracting doors (again designed for maximum aerodynamic cleanliness). The camera lenses were electrically heated to eliminate distortion. All of this combined to allow full photo operations during high speed flights. The XF-12 also carried a variety of photographic equipment, including complete darkroom facilities to permit the development and printing of films in flight. This was augmented by adjustable storage racks, able to handle any size <b>film</b> <b>containers</b> and additional photo equipment. This allowed the Army Intelligence units to have immediate access to the intelligence the aircraft was able to collect, with no delay in processing.|$|R

Casting can be quantified with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology. However, chemical shift artifact and image distortion may influence the accuracy of MRI when common socket/casting materials are used. We used a purpose-designed rig to examine seven different materials commonly used in socket fabrication during exposure to MRI. The rig incorporated glass marker tubes filled with water doped with 1 g/L copper sulfate (CS) and 9 plastic sample vials (<b>film</b> <b>containers)</b> to hold the specific material specimens. The specimens were scanned 9 times in different configurations. The absolute mean difference of the glass marker tube length was 1. 39 mm (2. 98 %) (minimum = 0. 13 mm [0. 30 %], maximum = 5. 47 mm [14. 03 %], standard deviation = 0. 89 mm). The absolute shift for all materials was < 1. 7 mm. This was less than the measurement tolerance of +/– 2. 18 mm based on voxel (three-dimensional pixel) dimensions. The results show that MRI is an accurate and repeatable method for dimensional measurement when using matter containing water. Additionally, silicone and plaster of paris plus 1 g/L CS do not show a significant shape distortion nor do they interfere with the MRI image of the residual limb...|$|R

40|$|Developments in X-ray {{synchrotron}} radiation sources and electronic area detectors {{have allowed the}} development of new X-ray diffraction techniques to investigate polymeric materials at high temporal and spatial resolution. These developments are illustrated by studies of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET). The fabrication of <b>films</b> and <b>containers</b> of PET typically involves mechanical deformation at elevated temperatures close to its Tg. Such processing can have major effects on the degree of polymer orientation and crystallinity and hence on the physical properties of the material. This paper describes the time-resolved X-ray diffraction technique developed to investigate the strain-induced crystallisation in PET under industrial processing conditions with 40 milliseconds time resolution. The investigation of the structural variation in orientation and crystallinity across the wall of a container fabricated from PET using an X-ray beam as small as 2 µm diameter is also described.

Protein film forming solutions were {{cast in the}} presence of two different glycerol concentrations and the film con- taining higher plasticizer amount was laminated with an additional corn zein layer. Both lamination process and lower glycerol concentration led to reduce film moisture content, total soluble matter and elongation at break, while both film tensile strength and water vapour barrier properties resulted enhanced. The obtained bioplastics were then processed by a new laboratory plastic moulding equip- ment specifically designed and fabricated to convert protein-based <b>films</b> to shaped <b>containers.</b> The use of either lower plasticizer concentration or corn zein lamination gave rise to potentially satisfactory vacuum thermoformed containers with acceptable resistance and stability...|$|R
40|$|Food {{packaging}} extensively uses plastic <b>films</b> and <b>containers</b> of petroleum-based polymers {{for their}} excellent functional properties and competitive price. Plastic packaging {{has become a}} central focus of waste reduction efforts, particularly in aesthetic terms of damage to flora and fauna. Presently, consumers require greater quality and longer shelf lives for their foodstuffs, while they demand {{a reduction in the}} quantity of packaging materials used. In the present study, poly-ethylenglycol (PEG), glycerol, and olive oil were incorporated into whey protein concentrate (WPC) through emulsification to produce films. Whey protein films were prepared by dispersing 10 % whey protein concentrate in tap water and plasticized with different levels of glycerol, PEG or olive oil. The emulsion films were evaluated for mechanical properties, water vapor permeability (WVP) and opacity. Increasing the levels of glycerol or PEG in the films resulted in a decrease in modulus and tensile strength. Increasing glycerol content of the films at oil/protein ratios of 0. 2 and 0. 4 led to slight increases in elongation. Increasing the oil/protein ratio further resulted in a decrease in elongation for all films. No significant difference in WVP and opacity was observed between films made from mixtures of various proportions of whey protein concentrate-glycerol with increasing PEG (addition) {{at all levels of the}} plasticizer. These results suggest that a whey protein based edible films is a viable alternative packaging process for food and improvement of shelf life...|$|R

40|$|Linear {{thermoplastic}} polyesters {{are commonly}} used in high volume applications such as food <b>containers,</b> <b>films</b> and textile fibers. The physical and mechanical properties of these materials are well documented and are a function of chemical structure and morphology (e. g. semi-crystalline, amorphous, etc.). Polyesters, as are many organic polymers, are quite flammable. Polydimethylsiloxane homopolymer exhibits low mechanical strength and, even at high molecular weight, exists as a viscous fluid rubbery gum due to its low glass transition temperature of approximately- 123 °C. However, {{one of the many}} attractive properties of this polymer is its relatively low flammability and if properly designed, organic “sand-like ” silicates are produced in oxidizing atmospheres at elevated temperatures (e. g. 500 - 700 °C).

40|$|Preface. This {{report is}} a product of the Cornell “open burning group, ” which formed in Winter 2002 to assess the extent and {{environmental}} health significance of open burning of household wastes and agricultural plastics in New York State (NYS), and begin work towards reducing these practices in order to protect public health and the environment. The report focuses on disposal of agricultural plastics—rather than on the household waste stream—for reasons that include the importance of agriculture in NY and the role of Cornell’s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences in working with NYS agriculture and the environment. Background and rationale. Plastics (LDPE, HDPE, polystyrene resins) have become ubiquitous in agriculture: In dairy farming they are used as silage bags, bunker silo covers, bale wraps and twines; in nurseries and ornamental horticulture they are used as hoophouse covers, trays and containers; in fruit and vegetable production, as row covers and mulch <b>films.</b> Plastic pesticide <b>containers</b> are used in all sectors of agriculture. Increasingly, plastics are substituted for the longer lasting materials previously used in agriculture (e. g., silage bags in place of concrete silos, plastic hoop houses in place of glass green houses) because of production efficiency and economics. More than half the plastics are disposed by burning onfarm, with most of the remainder buried or dumped on-farm. Due to inefficiencies of open combustion, emissions from open burning are much greater per mass of material burned than emissions from controlled incineration (e. g., 20 times as much dioxin, 40 times as much particulate matter). These emissions pose risks to human health...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Excessive {{wound healing}} {{following}} glaucoma filtration surgery {{is the main}} determinant of surgical failure, resulting from the activation of human Tenon's capsule fibroblasts (HTFs). To mitigate the excessive wound healing, the topicall use of antiproliferative agents, such as mitomycin C (MMC) and 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU), has increased the surgery success rate, but the traditional administration of these agents {{can result in a}} variety of toxicities with nonspecific damage. However, modulation of the wound healing process to prevent excessive fibroblast proliferation and scar formation can {{play a major role in}} improving the outcome of surgery. Therefore, the search for alternative modes of drug delivery and new agents is needed to minimize the ocular complications and improve the success of surgery. We have shown that there is a postoperative overexpression of the LDL receptor (LDLr) in the activated HTFs may provide a novel target for drug delivery systems. Presentation of the Hypothesis We hypothesize that antifibrotic agents (MMC) encapsulated in LDLr targeting drug delivery system (LDL-MMC-chitosan nanoparticles) may be proposed in anti-scarring therapy to increase the safety and effectiveness and to reduce toxicity. Testing the Hypothesis A chitosan-based polymeric predrug of MMC was synthesized and its cytotoxicity was proved to be low. In addition, we propose hyaluronic acid <b>film</b> as a <b>container</b> to release LDL-MMC-chitosan nanoparticles gradually at subconjunctival filtering site after glaucoma filtration surgery to eliminate the LDL-MMC-chitosan nanoparticles. Implications of the Hypothesis and discussion This strategy can be applicable to anti-scarring therapy during excessive conjunctival wound healing. This hypothesis integrates advantages of the targeting drug delivery and antifibrotic agents, such as high efficiency, convenience, and lower the toxicity. </p...|$|R
40|$|The peanut {{is one of}} {{the crops}} chosen for use in NASA's Advanced Life Support Program (ALS). The peanut is a source of both oil and protein. After oil is {{extracted}} from the peanut, a protein rich flour remains. An edible peanut protein film is one use for this flour. Two types of film are developed for this study, one set of film contains 10 % fat while the other set contains no fat. For film without fat the defatting of the peanut by the Soxhlet method {{is the first step in}} the manufacturing process of the film. Secondly, the protein is precipitated at its isoelectric point (pH 4. 5) and centrifuged to separate the protein from the non-protein. After freeze-drying the protein it is milled in a ceramic ball mill to decrease particle size and sifted through a series of sieves to determine particle size distribution. Those particles retained on the 100 mesh sieves are utilized for film formation. Larger particles are re-ground and sifted. Five grams of protein is mixed with 50 mL of distilled water, 70 mL of 80 % ethanol, 15 mL of 6 N ammonium hydroxide and a plasticizer. This mixture is heated for 30 minutes until the temperature reaches 70 C. The mixture is then poured onto a level Teflon coated glass surface. After allowing the film to form overnight under a ventilation hood, it is manually removed from the plate. The processes and methods adopted have created flexible films of uniform thickness that are free of air bubbles. Thickness of films made from defatted peanut protein and partially defatted peanut protein were 0. 10 Lm and 0. 13 Lm respectively. Films with natural peanut fat are approximately three times as flexible and almost four times as strong as the films made without fat. Further research will be performed to evaluate its mechanical properties. This paper will greatly contribute to food preservation and waste management. Potential applications of this <b>film</b> are edible/biodegradable <b>containers,</b> wrapping for food preservation (against water, oxygen and oil), storage packets for seasonings or other ingredients and encapsulation for pharmaceutical use...|$|R
40|$|Polyethylene (PE) {{presents}} a large class of polymers with an exponentially growing consumption worldwide. Although possessing {{a relatively simple}} chemical formula of the repeating CHx units, the chain length, the type and length of the branching, and density, offer a wide scope of possible PE grades, each suitable for different types of commercial application. Since the 1950 s, several types of ethylene polymerisation catalysts and polymerisation processes have been developed. Linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) {{is one of the}} most versatile types of PE, being used for the production of thin <b>films,</b> bags, toys, <b>containers,</b> pipes, covers and flexible tubing. The production of LLDPE involves the co-polymerisation of ethylene with α-olefins using Phillips, Ziegler-Natta or metallocene-type catalysts in gas, slurry or solution phase processes. In this PhD dissertation, the triethylaluminium-induced in-situ ethylene oligomerisation properties of Cr/Ti/SiO 2 Phillips-type catalysts have been studied in order to offer an alternative route for the incorporation of short-chain branching inside the PE, without the need of an additional α-olefin feed, multiple reactors or catalysts. The production of PE with “reverse” co-monomer incorporation without any externally added co-monomer via the in-situ oligomerisation of ethylene opens the possibility for the industrial production of this specific type of LLDPE using a single catalyst. The practical advantages are numerous. First of all, the elimination of a separate co-monomer feed decreases the price of raw materials. The costs of the purification, transport and chances of reactor poisoning are thus also decreased. The catalyst can be utilised within the existing Phillips polymerisation lines, while the whole process in order to produce PE with reverse SCBD can be performed within a single-reactor system in contrast to dual-reactor systems. Furthermore, the compatibility issues of the catalysts used in tandem catalysis could be also avoided. This was achieved through the integration of multiple analytical techniques, i. e. STXM, UV-Vis-NIR DRS, DRIFTS, GC, GC-MS, NMR, SEM-EDX and XRD; and the development and use of new operando setups. Ultimately, the characterisation methods and setups developed for the research of this catalytic system can be applicable for other studies involving solid catalysts, especially in the case of very sensitive materials when a highly controlled reaction atmosphere or when the minimal sample manipulation is required. The presented findings open a new era of Phillips-type polymerisation catalysis, while the developed characterisation methods offer a unique approach to study other catalytic systems in great detail...|$|R
