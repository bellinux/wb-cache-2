5|$|There are {{a number}} of common misconceptions {{regarding}} sex and pregnancy. Douching after sexual intercourse is not an effective form of birth control. Additionally, it is associated with a number of health problems and thus is not recommended. Women can become pregnant the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> have sexual intercourse and in any sexual position. It is possible, although not very likely, to become pregnant during menstruation.|$|E
5|$|For Bradford, {{it was the}} <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> {{had played}} at Wembley in their 93-year history. City {{finished}} sixth during the regular league season only winning a play-off place with a victory {{on the final day}} of the season. They came from two goals down during the semi-finals against Blackpool to gain a place in the play-off final. Having been relegated the previous season, Notts County had the chance to win an instant promotion back to the First Division. They finished fourth during the regular season and defeated Crewe Alexandra in the semi-final by drawing the away tie and winning by one-goal in the second leg at home.|$|E
5|$|For the Viet Cong, the Battle of Ap Bac {{marked the}} <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> stood and fought a large South Vietnamese formation—despite being outnumbered {{by more than}} five to one. Against {{overwhelming}} odds, the Viet Cong had achieved their first de facto victory; they had successfully held off well-equipped ARVN forces supported by artillery and armored units {{as well as by}} American airpower. Viet Cong casualties were limited to 18 soldiers killed and 39 wounded, even though their positions had been hit by more than 600 rounds of artillery, napalm and other ordnance released by 13 warplanes and five UH-1 gunships.|$|E

In a hard-fought game, the Seminoles lost, 2621, earning their first loss of the season. After winning their next two games, Florida State lost to NC State, Clemson, and 19th-ranked Florida, the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> had three consecutive losses since 1983. Florida State ended the regular season with a conference record of 53, but because one of those losses had been against a Coastal Division opponent, Florida State finished with the best Atlantic Division record and was named that division's representative to the ACC Championship Game.|$|E
5|$|On another {{occasion}} during the war, when {{the lady in}} waiting who usually picked them up from the hospital was detained and sent a carriage without an attendant, Tatiana and her sister Olga decided to go shopping for the <b>first</b> <b>time.</b> <b>They</b> ordered the carriage to stop near a group of shops and went {{into one of the}} stores, where they were unrecognized because of their nurses' uniforms. They came back out without buying anything when they realized they did not have money with them and wouldn't have known how to use it even if they did. The next day they asked Chebotareva how to use money.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 2009–10 season, it was {{reported}} that Schroeder intended to leave the University of Minnesota and join the Everett Silvertips, a team in the major junior Western Hockey League. This was denied by Schroeder, who wanted to spend at least another year with the Golden Gophers. The Golden Gophers finished the season with a losing record, the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> had done so in more than 10years, and lost in the first round of the playoffs, the second time in the past 33 years that had happened. Schroeder finished with 9 goals and 28 points in 37 games, tied for the team lead in points, the lowest for the team's leading scorer since 1962.|$|E

5|$|That summer, Victoria and Albert spent a rainy {{holiday in}} the west of Scotland at Loch Laggan, but heard from their doctor, Sir James Clark, that his son had enjoyed dry, sunny days farther east at Balmoral Castle. The tenant of Balmoral, Sir Robert Gordon, died {{suddenly}} in early October, and Albert began negotiations {{to take over the}} lease from the owner, the Earl Fife. In May the following year, Albert leased Balmoral, which he had never visited, and in September 1848 he, his wife and the older children went there for the <b>first</b> <b>time.</b> <b>They</b> came to relish the privacy it afforded.|$|E
5|$|The Phillies {{returned}} home to play the Washington Nationals before the break.

The team's five-game winning streak ended on July 12, when they lost to the Nationals 5–3 in 10 innings with 15 strikeouts. The Phillies ended the unofficial first half of their season with another loss, bowing to the Nationals 10–3 in the series' rubber match.|$|E
5|$|With his US Open win, Nadal had {{captured}} {{two of the}} year's slams while Federer had won the other two. This was the fourth time that Nadal and Federer had won all four of slams in the same year, following their sweeps in 2006, 2007, and 2010. Additionally, on 11 September 2017, Nadal and Federer were ranked No. 1 and No. 2, respectively, {{which was the first}} time since 20 March 2011 that they held the top two spots in the ATP rankings. The <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> occupied the top of the singles rankings was in 2005.|$|E

5|$|After {{reaching}} {{the age of}} 30 without developing a serious interest in a woman, Hand thought he was destined for bachelorhood. But, during a 1901 summer holiday in the Québec resort of La Malbaie, he met 25-year-old Frances Fincke, a graduate of Bryn Mawr College. Though indecisive in most matters, he waited {{only a few weeks}} before proposing. The more cautious Fincke postponed her answer for almost a year, while Hand wrote to and occasionally saw her. He also began to look more seriously for work in New York City. The next summer, both Hand and Fincke returned to La Malbaie, {{and at the end of}} August 1902, they became engaged and kissed for the <b>first</b> <b>time.</b> <b>They</b> married on December 6, 1902, shortly after Hand had accepted a post with the Manhattan law firm of Zabriskie, Burrill & Murray. The couple had three daughters: Mary Deshon (born 1905), Frances (born 1907), and Constance (born 1909). Hand proved an anxious husband and father. He corresponded regularly with his doctor brother-in-law about initial difficulties in conceiving and about his children's illnesses. He survived pneumonia in February 1905, taking months to recover.|$|E
5|$|As {{physical}} {{on the ice}} as Bouchard was, he {{was also}} regarded as a clean player and only rarely participated in hockey fights. Immensely strong, most players avoided engaging him in fights and Bouchard more often would be the person to break up combatants. However, it was a fight involving Bouchard {{which led to a}} significant change in the role of referees. During the 1946–47 season, Bouchard became involved in a prolonged and one-sided fight with Boston's Terry Reardon. Due to the fight, Clarence Campbell, president of the NHL, added to the duties of referees; for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> had the responsibility of breaking up fights. Then there was the time in March 1947, in a game in Boston, as the Canadiens were coming back onto the ice for the beginning of the third period, a female fan attacked Bouchard spearing him with a hat pin. Bouchard responded by pushing the woman away forcefully. A few moments later, Boston police were leading Bouchard out to a police car. According to Bouchard, Pat Egan of the Boston Bruins, interceded and talked the police out of the arrest.|$|E
5|$|Bradman {{thought his}} faster bowlers could not extract much bounce {{from the surface}} and soon removed the short leg fielder, and pursued a 63 {{off-side}} field with three slips and a deep point, trying to encourage the English openers {{to cut through the}} vacant area between the slips and extra cover. However, they declined Bradman's incentive and decided to bat in a low-risk manner, favouring straight-batted shots. After 80 minutes of batting, England's openers reached 50, the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> had put on a half-century in the series. Hutton and Washbrook appeared set for the long haul, and did not react to the applause. They continued on cautiously, and persisted in eschewing the cross-batted cut and pull shots and relying on the safe accumulation of singles.|$|E

5|$|Continued {{investment}} in players followed in successive seasons, and results began {{to match the}} upturn in player quality. City reached the 2011 FA Cup Final, their first major final in over 30 years, after defeating derby rivals Manchester United in the semi-final, the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> had knocked their rival out of a cup competition since 1975. They defeated Stoke City 1–0 in the final, securing their fifth FA Cup, the club's first major trophy since winning the 1976 League Cup. In the same week, the club qualified for the UEFA Champions League {{for the first time}} since 1968 with a 1–0 Premier League win over Tottenham Hotspur. On the last day of the 2010–11 season, City passed Arsenal for third place in the Premier League, thereby securing qualification directly into the Champions League group stage.|$|E
5|$|In August 2011, Arsenal {{suffered}} their heaviest league {{defeat in}} 84 years as they lost 8–2 to Manchester United at Old Trafford. Arsenal had not lost a league game {{by such a}} margin since 1927 when they lost 7–0 to West Ham United in the old Football League First Division. This was also the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> had conceded eight goals in a game since 1896, when they lost 8–0 to the now defunct Loughborough in the old Football League Second Division. A year later, striker Robin van Persie joined United, having stated {{that he would not}} renew his contract with Arsenal. It was speculated that he would move to a club overseas, but signed for the Manchester club, the first Arsenal player to do so since Viv Anderson in 1987. Ferguson called Wenger to push through a deal when he learnt of the contract situation. Van Persie was instrumental in United's league win of 2012–13 – Ferguson's last, and coincidentally received a guard of honour by his former teammates before United faced Arsenal at the Emirates in April 2013.|$|E
5|$|In July 1907, Dallas {{joined the}} assay {{office of the}} Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company, and also {{enrolled}} in the local technical college, where he took night classes in chemistry and technical drawing. He showed an early interest in aviation, fuelled by the establishment in 1911 of the Mount Morgan chapter of the Queensland Aero Club. Dallas {{and his younger brother}} Norvel built a glider, which was wrecked by an untimely gust of wind the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> tried to launch it. The two brothers continued to build model gliders in spite of this initial disaster, and Stan corresponded with pioneer aviators in France, England, and the United States. He later transferred to a higher-paying job driving trucks for Iron Island ironstone quarries. Stan and Norvel once again built their own flying machine while Stan was working on Iron Island. They experimented with this seaplane on nearby Marble Island, notorious for its treacherous waters; Stan lost this aeroplane in the sea.|$|E
