50|$|A <b>dolman</b> <b>sleeve</b> is {{a sleeve}} set {{into a very}} low armscye; in fact, the armscye may extend to the waistline, in which case {{there will be no}} underarm seam in the blouse. Dolman sleeves were very popular in ladies {{clothing}} during the Civil War. They had the effect of making the shoulders look sloped therefore minimizing the appearance of the waist. The early 21st century <b>dolman</b> <b>sleeve</b> describes a sleeve cut as one with the bodice, which can taper to the wrist or be cut widely.|$|E

50|$|During this period, {{synthetic}} yarns {{that took}} dyes easily were used. Leather-look plastic also {{helped to create}} a vibrant feel to accessories such as shoes, umbrellas and additional clothing items such as mini-skirts. While in this era, clothing became split along lines of age, there were overriding oversized trends including: midi skirts, <b>Dolman</b> <b>sleeves,</b> loose jackets and shapeless frocks. Another factor contributing to the trends of this period was the “post-industrial boom” that helped to generate wealth in the United States. Jackie Kennedy, wife of President John F. Kennedy, became a model of French fashions and helped to spur {{the spread of the}} miniskirt, along with Twiggy, who gained iconic status as the face and body of the era wearing the shapeless mod dresses that were a huge trend.

40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU CommunityThis dissertation explores the wartime fashion culture {{of the city of}} Los Angeles during the Second World War in order to explore consumption-based tensions that emerged in response to federal restrictions for the purpose of conservation. The War Production Board's General Limitation Order L- 85 took decisions over the measurements of clothing (i. e. hem width or sleeve length), the presence of embellishments (i. e. pockets or <b>dolman</b> <b>sleeves),</b> and the general silhouette of fashion (i. e. relative skirt fullness) {{out of the hands of}} fashion designers. Through L- 85, the fashion industry, an industry once famous for the principle of planned obsolesce, was transformed for the duration of the war into an "effective mechanism" of war that could satisfy the dual needs of the military and civilians. Even more so, through their use of patriotic marketing strategies, L- 85 potentially helped consumers first articulate, and later demonstrate, their acknowledgement of the war effort. By purchasing streamlined, simplified fashions, female consumers, in the words of fashion designer Gilbert Adrian, could "register taste without extravagance," and thus potentially participate in a communal performance of patriotism...|$|R

5000|$|Graham herself {{designed}} the Frontier costume, a stylized {{version of a}} 19th century homespun dress. It consisted of a long pale pink gingham jumper with asymmetric collar over a simple, long-sleeved white blouse. The gown's color was selected to suggest optimism and freshness. An open short white loose-fitting jacket with <b>dolman</b> style <b>sleeves</b> completed the garment. Her hair was worn loose, but pulled back from her face with a strip of cloth. The overall effect of set and costume {{is one of a}} rugged pioneer woman joyously at home in [...] "the vastness of the American landscape before it was fully tamed by the settlers." ...|$|R
