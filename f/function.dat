50|$|More than 25 {{different}} generalizations of bent <b>functions</b> {{are described}} in. There are algebraic generalizations (q-valued bent <b>functions,</b> p-ary bent <b>functions,</b> bent <b>functions</b> over a finite field, generalized Boolean bent <b>functions</b> of Schmidt, bent <b>functions</b> from a finite Abelian group into {{the set of}} complex numbers on the unit circle, bent <b>functions</b> from a finite Abelian group into a finite Abelian group, non Abelian bent <b>functions,</b> vectorial G-bent <b>functions,</b> multidimensional bent <b>functions</b> on a finite Abelian group), combinatorial generalizations (symmetric bent <b>functions,</b> homogeneous bent <b>functions,</b> rotation symmetric bent <b>functions,</b> normal bent <b>functions,</b> self-dual and anti-self-dual bent <b>functions,</b> partially defined bent <b>functions,</b> plateaued <b>functions,</b> Z-bent <b>functions</b> and quantum bent <b>functions)</b> and cryptographic generalizations (semi-bent <b>functions,</b> balanced bent <b>functions,</b> partially bent <b>functions,</b> hyper-bent <b>functions,</b> bent <b>functions</b> of higher order, k-bent <b>functions).</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} {{a new class of}} <b>functions</b> in topological spaces, namely, s*g-α-proper <b>functions.</b> Also, we study the basic properties and characterizations of these <b>functions.</b> One of the most important of equivalent definitions to the s*g-α-proper <b>functions</b> gives by using s*g-α-limit points of nets. Moreover we define and study s*g-α-perfect <b>functions</b> and s*g-α-compact <b>functions</b> in topological spaces and we study the relation between s*g-α-proper <b>functions</b> and each of proper <b>functions,</b> s*g-α-perfect <b>functions,</b> closed <b>functions,</b> s*g-α-closed <b>functions</b> and s*g-α-compact <b>functions</b> and we give an example when the converse may not be true.

50|$|About 180 <b>functions</b> are predefined. These {{belong to}} the {{categories}} basic <b>functions,</b> trigonometric and hyperbolic <b>functions,</b> non-differentiable <b>functions,</b> probability <b>functions,</b> special <b>functions,</b> programmable <b>functions,</b> iterations and fractals, differential and integral equations.|$|R
5|$|Placing {{an integer}} {{superscript}} after the name or {{symbol of a}} <b>function,</b> as if the <b>function</b> were being raised to a power, commonly refers to repeated <b>function</b> composition rather than repeated multiplication. Thus, f 3(x) may mean f(f(f(x))); in particular, f −1(x) usually denotes the inverse <b>function</b> of f. Iterated functions are {{of interest in the}} study of fractals and dynamical systems. Babbage was the first to study the problem of finding a functional square root f 1/2(x).|$|E
5|$|The binary {{logarithm}} <b>function</b> may {{be defined}} as the inverse <b>function</b> to the power of two <b>function,</b> which is a strictly increasing <b>function</b> over the positive real numbers and therefore has a unique inverse.|$|E
5|$|The {{selective}} {{pressure that}} shaped the original lemuriform toothcomb {{has been a}} topic of considerable debate since the 1970s. Evidence {{can be seen as}} supporting a grooming <b>function,</b> food procurement <b>function,</b> or both. In the early 1900s, there was less debate. Grooming was seen as the primary <b>function</b> since primates lack the claws needed to adequately comb the fur, although prosimian primates (strepsirrhines and tarsiers) possess at least one grooming claw on each foot to compensate. Grooming—in the form of fur-combing—is generally considered the primary <b>function</b> and original role of the lemuriform toothcomb, and subsequent changes in morphology across multiple lineages have altered its <b>function</b> and obscured its original <b>function.</b>|$|E
30|$|It {{is worth}} {{mentioning}} that many <b>functions</b> in applied science are the KL <b>functions</b> (see [16]). In fact, semialgebraic <b>functions,</b> real subanalytic <b>functions,</b> semiconvex <b>functions,</b> and uniformly convex <b>functions</b> are all KL <b>functions.</b>|$|R
30|$|From Definition  3, {{it follows}} that 2 -convex <b>functions</b> are just convex <b>functions.</b> Furthermore, 1 -convex <b>functions</b> are {{increasing}} <b>functions</b> and 0 -convex <b>functions</b> are nonnegative <b>functions.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Bent <b>functions</b> have maximal minimum {{distance}} to the set of affine <b>functions.</b> In other words, they achieve the maximal {{minimum distance}} to all the coordinate <b>functions</b> of affine monomials. In this paper we introduce {{a new class of}} bent <b>functions</b> which we call hyper-bent <b>functions.</b> <b>Functions</b> within this class achieve the maximal minimum distance to all the coordinate <b>functions</b> of all bijective monomials. We provide an explicit construction for such <b>functions.</b> We also extend our results to vectorial hyper-bent <b>functions.</b> Key words.

5|$|This {{exhibits}} the Kronecker delta <b>function</b> as {{a discrete}} analog of the Dirac delta <b>function.</b>|$|E
5|$|This {{is merely}} a {{heuristic}} characterization. The Dirac delta is not a <b>function</b> {{in the traditional sense}} as no <b>function</b> defined on the real numbers has these properties. The Dirac delta <b>function</b> can be rigorously defined either as a distribution or as a measure.|$|E
40|$|We {{introduced}} and studied some new classes of <b>functions</b> called (e ∗, s) -continuous <b>functions,</b> (e, s) -continuous <b>functions</b> and (a, s) -continuous <b>functions.</b> These new notions of <b>functions</b> generalize {{the class of}} almost contra-super-continuous <b>functions.</b> Some properties and several characterizations {{of these types of}} <b>functions</b> are obtained. We investigate the relationships between these classes of <b>functions</b> and other classes of non-continuous <b>functions.</b> ...|$|R
30|$|More {{complicated}} descriptors {{originate from}} random field theory and are introduced with the <b>functions</b> applied over the random sets of data. Among {{the most commonly}} applied statistical descriptor <b>functions</b> are n-point probability <b>functions,</b> surface correlation <b>functions,</b> pore-size <b>functions,</b> cluster <b>functions,</b> nearest neighbor <b>functions,</b> linear path <b>functions</b> and others (Matheron 1975; Torquato 2002).|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} some contra continuous <b>functions</b> in weak structure spaces such as contra (M,w) -continuous <b>functions,</b> contra (alpha(m),w) -continuous <b>functions,</b> contra (sigma(m),w) -continuous <b>functions,</b> contra (pi(m),w) -continuous <b>functions</b> and contra (beta(m),w) -continuous <b>functions.</b> We investigate their characterization {{and relationships}} among such <b>functions...</b>|$|R
5|$|Thus {{the complex}} {{exponential}} <b>function</b> is a periodic <b>function</b> with period 2πi.|$|E
5|$|The {{convergence}} of both series has very different properties. Even if the Taylor series has positive convergence radius, the resulting series may not {{coincide with the}} function; but if the <b>function</b> is analytic then the series converges pointwise to the <b>function,</b> and uniformly on every compact subset of the convergence interval. Concerning the Fourier series, if the <b>function</b> is square-integrable then the series converges in quadratic mean, but additional requirements are needed to ensure the pointwise or uniform convergence (for instance, if the <b>function</b> is periodic and of class C1 then the convergence is uniform).|$|E
25|$|The {{logarithm}} of {{a characteristic}} <b>function</b> is a cumulant generating <b>function,</b> which {{is useful for}} finding cumulants; some instead define the cumulant generating <b>function</b> as the logarithm of the moment-generating <b>function,</b> and call the logarithm of the characteristic <b>function</b> the second cumulant generating <b>function.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{evolutive}} supermathematical <b>functions</b> (FSM ─ Ev) {{are discussed}} in the papers [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. They are combinations of the four types of FSM (centric <b>functions</b> (FC), excentric <b>functions</b> (FE), elevated <b>functions</b> (FEl) and exotic <b>functions</b> (FEx), taken by two, called centricoexcentric <b>functions,</b> elevatoexotic <b>functions,</b> centricoelevated <b>functions,</b> and so forth) ...|$|R

25|$|In mathematics, a {{continuous}} <b>function</b> is a <b>function</b> for which sufficiently {{small changes in}} the input result in arbitrarily small changes in the output.

25|$|In {{this case}} the tree <b>function</b> calls the forest <b>function</b> by single recursion, but the forest <b>function</b> calls the tree <b>function</b> by {{multiple}} recursion.|$|E
25|$|According to Jung, {{people use}} all four {{cognitive}} functions. However, one <b>function</b> is generally {{used in a}} more conscious and confident way.

25|$|An abelian <b>function</b> is a meromorphic <b>function</b> on an abelian variety, {{which may}} be {{regarded}} therefore as a periodic <b>function</b> of n complex variables, having 2n independent periods; equivalently, it is a <b>function</b> in the <b>function</b> field of an abelian variety.|$|E
25|$|An {{injective}} partial <b>function</b> may be inverted to an injective partial <b>function,</b> and {{a partial}} <b>function</b> {{which is both}} injective and surjective has an injective <b>function</b> as inverse.

25|$|The {{characteristic}} <b>function</b> always exists when {{treated as}} a <b>function</b> of a real-valued argument, unlike the moment-generating <b>function.</b> There are relations between {{the behavior of the}} characteristic <b>function</b> of a distribution and properties of the distribution, such as the existence of moments and the existence of a density <b>function.</b>|$|E
