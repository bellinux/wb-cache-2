The paper was based on theoretical analysis, and did not claim an observational detection of the proposed satellite nucleus, but estimated that it would have a diameter of about 30km, with the main nucleus being about 70km across, and would orbit in about three days at a distance of about 180km. This analysis was confirmed by observations in 1996 using Wide-Field Planetary Camera 2 of the Hubble Space Telescope which had taken images of the comet that revealed the satellite.|$|E

40|$|Mongolian grasslands are {{a natural}} dust source region and they {{contribute}} to anthropogenic dust due to the long tradition of raising livestock there. Past decades of abrupt changes in a nomadic society necessitate a study {{on the effects of}} livestock trampling on <b>dust</b> <b>emissions,</b> so that research studies may help maintain a sustainable ecosystem and well-conditioned atmospheric environment. In this study, we conducted a mini wind tunnel experiment (using a PI-SWERL ®  device) to measure <b>dust</b> <b>emissions</b> fluxes from trampling (at three disturbance levels of livestock density, N) and zero trampling (natural as the background level) at test areas in a Mongolian temperate grassland. Moreover, we scaled anthropogenic <b>dust</b> <b>emissions</b> to natural <b>dust</b> <b>emissions</b> as a relative consequence of livestock trampling. We found a substantial increase in <b>dust</b> <b>emissions</b> due to livestock trampling. This effect of trampling on <b>dust</b> <b>emissions</b> was persistent throughout all wind friction velocities, u * (varying from 0. 44 to 0. 82  m s − 1). Significantly higher dust loading occurs after a certain disturbance level has been reached by the livestock trampling. Our results suggest that both friction velocity (u *) and disturbance level of livestock density (N) have an enormous combinational effect on <b>dust</b> <b>emissions</b> from the trampling test surface. This means that the effect of livestock trampling on <b>dust</b> <b>emissions</b> can be seen or revealed when wind is strong. Our results also emphasize that better management for livestock allocation coupled with strategies to prevent anthropogenic dust loads are needed.

40|$|Predicting the {{influences}} of dust on atmospheric composition, climate, and human health requires accurate knowledge of <b>dust</b> <b>emissions,</b> but large uncertainties persist in quantifying mineral sources. This study presents a new method for combined use of satellite-measured radiances and inverse modeling to spatially constrain the amount and location of <b>dust</b> <b>emissions.</b> The technique is illustrated with {{a case study in}} May 2008; the <b>dust</b> <b>emissions</b> in Taklimakan and Gobi deserts are spatially optimized using the GEOSChem chemical transport model and its adjoint constrained by aerosol optical depth (AOD) that are derived over the downwind dark-surface region in China from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) reflectance with the aerosol single scattering properties consistent with GEOS-chem. The adjoint inverse modeling yields an overall 51 % decrease in prior <b>dust</b> <b>emissions</b> estimated by GEOS-Chem over the Taklimakan-Gobi area, with more significant reductions south of the Gobi Desert. The model simulation with optimized <b>dust</b> <b>emissions</b> shows much better agreement with independent observations from MISR (Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer) AOD and MODIS Deep Blue AOD over the dust source region and surface PM 10 concentrations. The technique of this study can be applied to global multi-sensor remote sensing data for constraining <b>dust</b> <b>emissions</b> at various temporal and spatial scales, and hence improving the quantification of dust effects on climate, air quality, and human health...|$|R

40|$|We present {{simulations}} {{of the dust}} cycle during present and glacial climate states, using a model, which explicitly simulates the control of <b>dust</b> <b>emissions</b> {{as a function of}} seasonal and interannual changes in vegetation cover. The model produces lower absolute amounts of <b>dust</b> <b>emissions</b> and deposition than previous {{simulations of}} the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) dust cycle. However, the simulated 2 - to 3 -fold increase in emissions and deposition at the LGM compared to today, is in agreement with marine- and ice-core observations, and consistent with previous simulations. The mean changes are accompanied by a prolongation of the length of the season of <b>dust</b> <b>emissions</b> in most source regions. The increase is most pronounced in Asia, where LGM <b>dust</b> <b>emissions</b> are high throughout the winter, spring and summer rather than occurring primarily in spring as they do today. Changes in the seasonality of <b>dust</b> <b>emissions,</b> and hence atmospheric loading, interact with changes in the seasonality of precipitation, and hence of the relative importance of wet and dry deposition processes at high northern latitudes. As a result, simulated dust deposition rates in the high northern latitudes show high interannual variability. Our results suggest that the high dust concentration variability shown by the Greenland ice core records during the LGM is a consequence of changes in atmospheric circulation and precipitation locally rather than a result of changes in the variability of <b>dust</b> <b>emissions.</b> 19 page(s...|$|R

Acontrolled study was conducted on haulage roads to assess the efficacy of using a lignosulphonate-based dust palliative, compared with a water-only strategy to suppress dust. Asection of road that is representative of a typical mine haulage road was chosen for the study.

The preferential dust source (PDS) scheme enables large-scale mapping of geomorphology in terms of importance for <b>dust</b> <b>emissions</b> but has not been independently tested other than at local scales.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the relative importance}} of climate change (CC) and anthropogenic land cover change (ALCC) for the <b>dust</b> <b>emissions</b> and burden changes between the late nineteenth century and today. For this purpose, the climate-aerosol model ECHAM 6 -HAM 2 is complemented by a new scheme to derive potential dust sources at runtime using the vegetation cover provided by the land component JSBACH of ECHAM 6. <b>Dust</b> <b>emissions</b> are computed online using information from the ECHAM 6 atmospheric component. This allows us to account for changes in land cover and climate interactively and to distinguish between emissions from natural and agricultural dust sources. For today's climate we find that nearly 10 % of dust particles are emitted from agricultural areas. According to our simulations, global annual <b>dust</b> <b>emissions</b> have increased by 25 % between the late nineteenth century and today (e. g., from 729 Tg/a to 912 Tg/a). Globally, CC and ALCC (e. g., agricultural expansion) have both contributed to this change (56 % and 40 %, respectively). There are however large regional differences. For example, change in <b>dust</b> <b>emissions</b> in Africa are clearly dominated by CC. Global dust burden have increased by 24. 5 % since the late nineteenth century, which results in a clear-sky radiative forcing at top of the atmosphere of similar to 0. 14 W/m(2). Based on these findings, we recommend that both climate changes and anthropogenic land cover changes should be considered when investigating long-term changes in <b>dust</b> <b>emissions...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{sediment}} availability {{as a major}} control on <b>dust</b> <b>emissions</b> within arid environments is of growing interest in aeolian geomorphology. Theoretical models suggest that during arid phases thegeomorphic features which supply dust to the airstream may become exhausted of wind erodible sediments (Bullard and McTainsh, 2003). As a result, major dust source areas tend {{to be associated with}} fluvial depocentres in arid and semi-arid settings, where periodic flood inundation events re-supply the system with fine erodible sediments (Prospero et al., 2002). Previous research has suggested that aeolian-fluvial interactions are an important mechanism controlling <b>dust</b> <b>emissions</b> from Australia’s principal dust source regions, the Lake Eyre and Murray-Darling Basins (Bullard and McTainsh, 2003; McTainsh, 1998). Field studies on the Diamantina River floodplain have indicated that aeolian and fluvial systems are linked at annual time scales (McTainsh et al., 1999; McTainsh et al., 2002). In this study we seek to characterise the nature of this linkage and how it may affect <b>dust</b> <b>emissions</b> from eastern Australia. In particular we examine the role of fluvial processes in aeolian sediment supply/exhaustion cycles and the temporal scales over which these processes operate.

Through comparison with observed <b>dust</b> <b>emissions,</b> we show that the scheme provides a reasonable prediction of areas of emission in the Chihuahuan Desert and in the Lake Eyre Basin. The classification is also applied to point source data from the Western Sahara to enable comparison of the relative importance of different land surfaces for <b>dust</b> <b>emissions.</b> We indicate how the scheme could be used to provide an improved characterization of preferential dust sources in global dust-cycle models.
