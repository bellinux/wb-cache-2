25|$|The KR175 {{used the}} {{standard}} Kabinenroller steering system, with a steering bar connected {{directly to the}} track rods of the front wheels, providing an extremely direct response best suited to small, measured inputs. The KR175's steering bar was made from tubular steel. The <b>gearshift</b> <b>lever,</b> {{on the right side}} of the cockpit, had a secondary lever on it which operated the clutch. The throttle was operated by a twist-grip on the left handlebar. The foot brake pedal, which was the only pedal in the car, operated brakes on all three wheels mechanically, using cables. The handbrake lever operated similarly.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} {{dual-mode}} ignition, the KR200 had a steering bar reminiscent of {{that of an}} aircraft. To steer the KR200, the driver would swivel the steering bar about its axis from the horizontal (straight-ahead) position instead of rotating it as with a conventional steering wheel. The mechanism was connected directly to the track rods of the front wheels, providing an extremely direct response best suited to small amounts of movement, unlike other common steering mechanisms which involved reduction gearing. The <b>gearshift</b> <b>lever</b> had a secondary lever on it which, when actuated, would {{put the car in}} neutral regardless of what gear it had been in before, although the transmission would have to be shifted back to first before the car would be able to move from a standstill.|$|E
2500|$|Presented at the April 2014 New York Auto Show and {{mirroring}} the European [...] "Giallo" [...] and [...] "Limited Edition" [...] yellow-painted special editions, Scion released 1500 {{units of the}} [...] "Release Series 1.0" [...] in similar Yuzu Yellow paint. Its starting price is [...] and it features TRD bodykit and quad-tip exhaust system, along with TRD lowered suspension, TRD steering wheel and shift knob and the highest specification (dual [...] A/C, HID headlamps with LED daytime running lamps, push-button start-stop) plus a numbered commemorative plaque near the <b>gearshift</b> <b>lever.</b>|$|E
50|$|Power for the C4 was {{provided}} by the same unit used in the CS, a 1003 cc four-cylinder engine (two valves per cylinder) with a 58.0 mm bore, a 95.0 mm stroke, a magneto ignition AND Solex carburetor; it was rated at 22 KW at 2800 rpm. The vehicle transmission (which was also used in the CC and CS models, the only difference being the longer length of the <b>gearshift</b> <b>levers,</b> necessitated by the longer chassis) provided three speeds, with power being sent to the rear wheels (a differential was not used on the rear-wheel power distribution scheme until the 1925 model, however). The suspension used semi-elliptic leaf springs in both the front and rear as well as fitted friction type dampers.|$|R
50|$|In most {{vehicles}} with manual transmission, gears are selected by manipulating a lever called a gear stick, shift stick, <b>gearshift,</b> gear <b>lever,</b> gear selector, or shifter {{connected to the}} transmission via linkage or cables and mounted on the floor, dashboard, or steering column. Moving the lever forward, backward, left, and right into specific positions selects particular gears.|$|R
5000|$|In 1966, Huffman {{introduced}} a new long-wheelbase bicycle frame called the Rail. The new frame was approximately 4" [...] to 5" [...] longer than previous models. The new frame became Huffman's base model until 1968. In 1968, {{in an effort to}} market a children's bicycle with an automotive theme, Huffman designers added a car-type steering wheel in place of handlebars to the Rail frame, which became the Huffy Wheel. Tall [...] "stick-shift" [...] derailleur gear shift levers mounted on the frame top-tube imitated the <b>gearshift</b> <b>levers</b> of popular muscle cars of the day, while many banana-seat cycles were fitted with tall chromed sissy bar passenger backrests {{at the rear of the}} seat. In mid-1968, Huffman released the Flaming Stack chain guard, which was designed to look like the distinctive side exhaust pipe covers on the Corvette sports car. Later that same year, Huffman released a new Slingshot model with 16" [...] front dragster wheel, and 20" [...] rear. The new 1969 models where the last year for the three-bar Rail frame style. In 1970 Huffman deleted their three-bar frame and went to a two-bar Rail frame, eventually adding additional two-tone fade paint jobs along with Persons striped seats. These designs continued in production until 1971 when new safety and manufacturing restrictions from the BMA (Bicycle Manufacturers Association), the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and other U.S. federal agencies forced the discontinuance of the Wheel, the top-tube mounted [...] "stick-shift", the [...] "sissy bar", and many other stylized features of children's bicycle designs.|$|R

50|$|The Model 20 was {{equipped}} with a side-valve, in-line 2,704cc four-cylinder engine developing 22 bhp. The engine was installed in the front, driving the rear wheels through a transmission shaft. The gearbox had three forward gears, with the <b>gearshift</b> <b>lever</b> positioned {{to the right of}} the driver.|$|E
50|$|Model year 2016 saw {{the return}} of the SR {{performance}} model. Available with either 4 or 6 cylinder engines it comes equipped with 18 inch alloy wheels, sport decklid spoiler, unique sport interior with blue piping on the seats, SR logo floormats, and leather wrapped steering wheel and <b>gearshift</b> <b>lever.</b>|$|E
50|$|Campagnolo ErgoPower is an {{integrated}} <b>gearshift</b> and brake <b>lever</b> system designed by Campagnolo for racing bicycles. It allows shifting gears {{without having to}} remove a hand from the bars, unlike previous down tube shifting systems. It was launched in 1992 to compete with Shimano Total Integration (STI). It is characterized by having three separate levers per unit: one for braking, one for upshifts, and a third for downshifts with the thumb. Ergopower levers may be disassembled for servicing.|$|R
50|$|SRAM Double Tap is an {{integrated}} <b>gearshift</b> and brake <b>lever</b> system designed by SRAM Corporation for racing bicycles. It allows shifting gears {{without having to}} remove a hand from the bars, unlike previous down tube shifting systems. It was launched in late 2005 to compete with Shimano Total Integration and Campagnolo ErgoPower. It is characterized by having a single shift lever per unit that the rider moves inward a short distance for upshifts and a longer distance for downshifts. It is lighter and smaller than competitors because it has few parts.|$|R
50|$|RAMI {{models were}} made of diecast zamac metal alloy - only wheels and tires were plastic (Rixon 2005, p. 72). Some early models, like the Marne Taxi are made in diecast halves joining {{down the middle of}} the car - this faux pas was avoided on most other models. Seats and thin fenders were diecast metal on R.A.M.I. models, which is a bit rare as many diecast {{manufacturers}} of early brass era vehicles (like French Minialuxe) often use plastic. Plastic is easier to work with for 'spidery' parts such as wheel spokes, thin fenders, steering tillers, and long <b>gearshift</b> and brake <b>levers</b> (Sinclair 1979, p. 391). Occasionally, a dab of glue can be spied at the base of a lever or a tiller (Rixon 2005, p. 72). RAMI tops, even those purportedly of cloth were diecast in metal as well. Thus models were heavy, especially if one was used to handling plastic Minialuxe vehicles (Gibson 1971, 23).|$|R
50|$|Carried {{over from}} the 207 RC, the {{interior}} received grinium finish decor with front and rear bucket seats as well as RC front and rear mat covers. The steering wheel too, with a granium finish ring and numbered from 1 to 2000. The <b>gearshift</b> <b>lever</b> knob, pedal assembly, foot rest and door sill are in aluminium.|$|E
50|$|The second {{generation}} series H200 of RegiusAce was completely restyled {{and is currently}} in production. Transmission choices are a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic, with the <b>gearshift</b> <b>lever</b> integrated into the instrument panel so as to allow front seat passengers access {{to the rear of}} the vehicle from the inside. A moderate restyle was completed November 2005.|$|E
5000|$|The {{shift pattern}} for most underbone or {{miniature}} motorcycles {{with an automatic}} centrifugal clutch is also modified for two key reasons—to enable the less-experienced riders to shift the gears without problems of [...] "finding" [...] neutral, and also due to the greater force needed to [...] "lift" [...] the <b>gearshift</b> <b>lever</b> (because the gearshift pedal of an underbone motorcycle also operates the clutch). The <b>gearshift</b> <b>lever</b> of an underbone has two ends. The rider clicks down the front end with the left toe {{all the way to}} the top gear and clicks down the rear end with the heel all the way down to neutral, while miniatures still retain a single-end lever, with the rider clicks down to upshift and lift the lever up to downshift (or vice versa). Some underbone models such as the Honda Wave have a [...] "rotary" [...] shift pattern, which means that the rider can shift directly to neutral from the top gear, but for safety reasons this is only possible when the motorcycle is stationary. Some models also have gear position indicators for all gear positions at the instrument panel.|$|E
5000|$|All modern Saabs (except the 9000 and 9-2X) have a {{floor-mounted}} ignition. This is {{for many}} reasons, {{some of which}} follow: Saab believes this is a safer position {{in case of an}} accident. The driver's knee often jerks upward in a collision; the compact and dense ignition module on the steering column of many other cars has shattered many kneecaps. Saabs have bolstered dashboards for both front seat occupants. Also, the floor-mounted position yields more space, allowing modern Saabs to have a metal bar that rotates over and up into the ignition when the key is turned to the [...] "Lock" [...] position. This makes Saabs very challenging to hot-wire. Ergonomically, the ignition's location next to the parking brake <b>lever,</b> <b>gearshift,</b> and seatbelt, saves time. Last of all, the ignition is located on the floor because, in the aircraft that inspired Saab automobiles, the throttle controls were all located on the floor. Originally Saabs also had the key located {{on the right side of}} the steering column, but when they changed from a column shift to a floor shift, the ignition key followed, except in the Sonett III and 9000.|$|R
5000|$|The Series S Bearcat of 1917 {{brought the}} first large {{change to the}} model. While it {{retained}} the 120 in wheelbase, its body now featured an enclosed cockpit with step-over sides. It continued to be right-hand drive with external <b>gearshift</b> and brake <b>levers.</b> The main change was a new Stutz-designed 360 in3 L 16-valve four-cylinder engine. It was cast in a single block had a heat-treated nickel crank and camshafts. For 1919, the Series G was similar, but the mid-1919 Series H bodies featured cut-down sides to make cockpit entrance easier. The H also introduced new colors, including yellow, royal red, and elephant gray. By the end of 1919, price for a Bearcat had risen to $3,250 (equivalent to $ in , {{the same as the}} roadster and slightly less than the touring coupe). The 1920 Series K was again similar, but prices rose to $3,900 (equivalent to $ in [...] ) {{in the wake of a}} postwar auto sales boom. The 1921 series K featuring a new “DH” engine with a detachable head was introduced, but a switch to left-hand drive in the following KLDH (L for left) meant the end of the Bearcat, since its narrow front seat and cockpit did not leave room for centrally located gear and brake levers. By 1922, the famed Bearcat name was missing from model lists and sales literature. For 1923, the roadster was renamed the Bearcat, but the name would again disappear in 1924.|$|R
50|$|HSD {{technology}} {{produces a}} full hybrid vehicle {{which allows the}} car to run on the electric motor only, as opposed to most other brand hybrids which cannot and are considered mild hybrids. The HSD also combines an electric drive and a planetary gearset which performs similarly to a continuously variable transmission. The Synergy Drive is a drive-by-wire system with no direct mechanical connection between the engine and the engine controls: both the gas pedal/accelerator and the <b>gearshift</b> <b>lever</b> in an HSD car merely send electrical signals to a control computer.|$|E
50|$|The 650 {{remained}} {{popular in}} Japan, and although some were exported to Europe in the 70s, subsequent models were produced {{primarily for the}} domestic market. The penultimate model in the W series was the W1SA with stylistic changes, but most importantly with the <b>gearshift</b> <b>lever</b> {{on the left side}} and the rear brake pedal on the right side, which is the standard configuration for Japanese motorcycles. The final version was the 1973 W3 model (aka RS650) with upgraded suspension as well as twin disc brakes in front. W series production ceased in 1974.|$|E

5000|$|The driver could down-shift {{for passing}} by fully {{depressing}} the accelerator. The clutch {{was needed to}} change between low and high range. The fluid drive system allowed the driver to stop at a light or in traffic and remain in gear without depressing the clutch. The driver could, if not concerned with fast acceleration, drive the car all day long in high range, stopping and starting, without ever having to touch the clutch pedal or <b>gearshift</b> <b>lever</b> unless faster acceleration or reversing was required. For this reason, DeSotos and Dodges were favored by city cab companies from the mid Forties to early Fifties.|$|E
50|$|Einar meets Jean at {{the diner}} and invites {{her to come back}} and live with him and Griff after a camping trip. The camping trip is cover for {{carrying}} out a request from Mitch to set the bear who handicapped him free. The plan does not go off without a hitch as Griff accidentally knocks the <b>gearshift</b> <b>lever</b> into neutral while Einar is luring the bear into the cage, freeing the bear who attacks Einar. Griff drives Einar to the hospital, where he and Jean attempt to reconcile. Back at the ranch, Mitch survives a peaceful confrontation with the bear from his past. It flees to the mountains where it belongs.|$|E
50|$|After {{crossing}} the finishing line, Park raised a No. 3 Earnhardt hat that hanged on his <b>gearshift</b> <b>lever</b> and thrust {{it out of}} the car to holding it high in tribute to Earnhardt. Park also performed a spin, drove towards Michael Waltrip and made a brief stop with the exchanging a high-five. As Park celebrated, he received a call from Earnhardt's wife Teresa Earnhardt who watched the race at the Dale Earnhardt, Inc. shop in Mooresville, North Carolina. According to Park, Teresa was emotional, but happy. The race took three hours, thirty-four minutes and twenty-one seconds to complete, and the margin of victory was 0.138 seconds.|$|E
50|$|Available in coupe and {{convertible}} bodies, {{they are}} versions of Bentley Continental GT V8 with increased engine power to @6000rpm and 680 Nm@1700rpm, increased agility and body control {{to match the}} engine's higher output, lowered suspension through an aerodynamic front splitter, discrete side sills and rear diffuser in Beluga gloss black; new exclusive 20-inch wheels with open-spoke design, red-painted brake calipers, optional new sports exhaust, optional duo-tone interiors, choice of interior trim in seventeen hide colours, unique contrast centre stripe for the hide-trimmed roof lining matching the colour of the main hide, knurled chrome detailing to the <b>gearshift</b> <b>lever</b> and ventilation controls, Piano Black veneers, 'V8 S' on each sill tread plate.|$|E
5000|$|The Dyna Junior was {{characterized}} by simple lines and few frills. Exterior decoration {{was limited to the}} grille inherited from the Dyna X. The car had exposed hinges on the trailing edge of the two passenger doors that opened [...] "Suicide"-style. There were no external door handles, so opening the door required reaching in through the sliding plastic side windows to reach the interior latch. There was likewise no external trunk lid, with the rear storage compartment accessed by folding down the backrest of the two-place bench-seat. The interior was spartan, with a single centre-mounted dial for the speedometer and a <b>gearshift</b> <b>lever</b> sprouting from the dashboard as in the Dyna X.|$|E
5000|$|The 1939 models joined other American {{cars in the}} use of a column-mounted <b>gearshift</b> <b>lever.</b> This freed front-seat {{passenger}} space and remained the industry standard through the 1960s, when [...] "bucket seats" [...] came into vogue. Hudson became the first car manufacturer to use foam rubber in its seats. The Hudson Terraplane was dropped. For 1940 Hudson introduced coil spring independent front suspension, aircraft style shock absorbers mounted within the front springs and true center-point steering on all its models, a major advance in performance among cars in this price range. Despite all these changes, Hudson sales for 1940 were lower than 1939 and the company lost money again. The advent of military contracts the following year brought relief.|$|E
5000|$|The second Actros {{generation}} {{comes with}} an electronic sequential gearbox that Mercedes-Benz has dubbed the [...] "Telligent Gearbox". It pushes forward the principle used in some earlier Mercedes-Benz tractors; using the <b>gearshift</b> <b>lever</b> to command a pneumatically actuated system that changes the gears. The Telligent gearbox utilizes a computer, together with a load-sensing system on the fifth-wheel coupling, to estimate the proper gear that the truck must be in. For example, {{if you want to}} upshift, the computer estimates the load on the tractor and the current engine mode, and gives you the proper gear for decreasing engine RPM. On the other hand, if you want to downshift, the computer assumes you wish to overtake, and gives you a proper gear for acceleration.|$|E

The <b>gearshift</b> <b>lever</b> had a secondary lever on it which, when actuated, would {{put the car in}} neutral regardless of what gear it had been in before, although the transmission would have to be shifted back to first before the car would be able to move from a standstill.|$|E
50|$|Apart {{from the}} {{increase}} in width and the IRS badge on {{the rear of the}} car, other changes included a revised grille and new hood badge. There was also a new line of chrome trim on the side, starting near the rear edge of the door and ending {{at the front of the}} car with integrated signal/marker lights, which were moved from their earlier position in the corners of the grille. New smaller front bumpers and a convertible top patterned after the one from the Herald completed the exterior differences. On the interior the fly-off handbrake lever was moved to the transmission tunnel between two revised seats, the <b>gearshift</b> <b>lever</b> was shortened and the white painted steel dashboard was now always covered by walnut, which had been optional in the TR4.|$|E
5000|$|The {{fortunes}} of the Davis company waned later in the 1920s. Later Davises were obsolete, and sales began to slip from the peak sales of the early 1920s. In February 1928, the company was acquired by the Automotive Corporation of America, led by Villor P. Williams. [...] Williams was interested in gaining an automobile on which to install his Parkmobile device. The Parkmobile was a device which hydraulically raised the car up via a set of smaller wheels inboard of the standard ones. This allowed the vehicle to be rolled sideways into a parallel parking space. It operated [...] "through the regular <b>gearshift</b> <b>lever</b> in conjunction with an extra lever operated from the transmission." [...] The six-cylinder Davis was now renamed the New York Six, while the 8-cylinder model remained a Davis. Both of these were to get the Parkmobile device, only a few did, however. Any 1929 models were simply ones built using leftover 1928 parts.|$|E
50|$|Fitted with {{coil spring}} {{suspension}} and drum brakes, the AML lacks hydraulic assist on either brakes or steering; only front wheels steer. Consequently, {{the steering wheel}} requires considerable strength to turn while the vehicle is in motion - while stationary it remains effectively locked. Much like the Ferret, rear wheel drive is transmitted directly to epicyclic hub reduction gears, also known as bevel boxes. The motor and gearbox have been harnessed via a centrifugal clutch with electromagnetic control, {{eliminating the need for}} a clutch pedal. This type of clutch is automatically engaged by gripping the knob of the <b>gearshift</b> <b>lever,</b> which is located behind the driver's seat in the hull floor. The gearbox assembly consists of two separate gearboxes, one for high and the other for low gear. The low-range gearbox is designed for off-road use and has a reverse gear and a top gear, while the high-range box is for operation on roads and has three low gears and one overdrive. There is a hydraulic dual-circuit handbrake operating on the gearbox output shaft.|$|E
5000|$|In 1970, a Subaru {{dealership}} {{received a}} special order {{request from the}} Tohoku Electric Power Company for Subaru to build an all-weather vehicle with 4WD, as the company was currently using jeeps that were open to the weather. The jeeps could not seal out the cold weather, {{and did not have}} adequate heaters for winter use. The 4WD traction was advantageous in traveling on poor roads, but the jeeps were of a 30-year-old design and something more modern was desired. A car with 4WD would be more comfortable. Tohoku Electric asked that the Subaru 1000 station wagon be converted from front-wheel drive to 4WD. Given the design of the drivetrain being used in Subarus of the time, it was considered relatively easy to simply attach a driveshaft {{to the back of the}} transmission and add a rear differential that powered the rear wheels. A transfer case was also installed so that the 4WD system could be disengaged with an additional <b>gearshift</b> <b>lever</b> installed next to the transmission gearshift.|$|E
5000|$|Most modern manual-transmission {{vehicles}} are {{fitted with a}} synchronized gear box. Transmission gears are always in mesh and rotating, but gears on one shaft can freely rotate or be locked to the shaft. The locking mechanism for a gear consists of a collar (or dog collar) on the shaft which is able to slide sideways so that teeth (or dogs) on its inner surface bridge two circular rings with teeth on their outer circumference: one attached to the gear, one to the shaft hub. When the rings are bridged by the collar, that particular gear is rotationally locked to the shaft and determines the output speed of the transmission. The <b>gearshift</b> <b>lever</b> manipulates the collars using a set of linkages, so arranged so that one collar may be permitted to lock only one gear at any one time; when [...] "shifting gears", the locking collar from one gear is disengaged before that of another is engaged. One collar often serves for two gears; sliding in one direction selects one transmission speed, {{in the other direction}} selects another.|$|E
5000|$|In 1970 GAZ-21 Volga was {{replaced}} by GAZ-24 and the V8 adoption followed soon, dubbed GAZ-24-24. As the sedan's standard gearbox was now a four on the floor manual, the selector lever was accordingly altered. Unofficially these cars were called [...] "Chasers", and despite their novelty, the engine torque was disproportional to the chassis ability (to prevent excessive burnouts, the factory improvised by adding a 100 kg metal plate into the boot rather than altering the suspension design). This meant a very low service life and also required very professional driving. For that reason, the factory did not even bother creating a special select indicator, and externally it resembled a manual transmission <b>gearshift</b> <b>lever</b> (some cars even lacked a single brake pedal, and instead had the clutch/brake pedal layout that dubbed each other). The GAZ-24 had the common cord-actuated parking brakes, thus the central shaft brake was removed and replaced by an extension housing to fit the shorter driveshaft of the GAZ-24. GAZ-24-24 would be produced alongside standard GAZ-24 until 1985. That year the car got a major facelift and internal modernisation with engine and chassis elements from the GAZ-3102 Volga, resulting in the GAZ-24-10 model. The Chaser became GAZ-24-34 and was produced until 1993.|$|E
