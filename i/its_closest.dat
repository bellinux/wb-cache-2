5|$|B.menziesiis inflorescences {{resemble}} those of no other banksia; <b>its</b> <b>closest</b> relatives were felt by George to be B.speciosa (showy banksia) and B.baxteri (bird's nest banksia), which differs from B.menziesii in having yellow flowers and leaves with deep triangular lobes. In 2002, a molecular study by Austin Mast showed <b>its</b> <b>closest</b> relatives to be {{the members of the}} series Crocinae.|$|E

5|$|A 2015 genetic {{study by}} {{evolutionary}} biologist Emma Harrower and colleagues of C.violaceus and <b>its</b> <b>closest</b> relatives {{suggests that the}} group (section Cortinarius) originated in Australasia and began diverging from a common ancestor around 12 million {{years ago in the}} Miocene, with C.violaceus itself diverging from <b>its</b> <b>closest</b> relative around 3.9 million years ago. The fact that these species diverged relatively recently indicates that some form of dispersal must have taken place across large bodies of water. The original plant hosts were flowering plants (angiosperms), and C.violaceus—or its direct ancestor—developed a symbiotic relationship with pines, as well as multiple flowering plants; this may have facilitated its expansion across the Northern Hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|Architecturally, {{the castle}} is unusual for this period. Its design appears {{somewhat}} backward, particularly {{in comparison to}} the nearby fortification of Harry's Walls, built {{at the same time as}} the castle, but which adopted a more contemporary design that employed bastions. <b>Its</b> <b>closest</b> equivalents are the blockhouses built by Henry VIII on the River Thames.|$|E

5|$|He thought <b>its</b> <b>closest</b> {{relative}} {{was clearly}} Banksia serrata and then B.ornata, {{and that the}} three formed a link with western species. Since Brown's original publication had treated all of Fraser's specimens as syntypes (shared type specimens) for the species, George also chose a lectotype (a single specimen {{to serve as the}} type specimen).|$|E
5|$|He thought <b>its</b> <b>closest</b> {{relatives}} to be Banksia speciosa and B.baxteri, {{and that it}} also formed a link with eastern species, particularly Banksia serrata. Since Brown's original publication had treated all of Fraser's specimens as syntypes for the species, George also chose a lectotype, selecting a tree that Fraser had received from Macleay in May 1828.|$|E

5|$|Long range {{forecasts}} {{brought the}} storm near Bermuda. However Debby remained over 900mi (1,450km) {{from the island}} at <b>its</b> <b>closest</b> approach. Though the storm was forecast to remain {{far away from the}} Gulf of Mexico, investors tracking the storm caused the price of crude oil to rise 60cents a barrel due to the potential impact to oil installations.|$|E

5|$|Voyager 1 began photographing Jupiter in January 1979 {{and made}} <b>its</b> <b>closest</b> {{approach}} on March 5, 1979, {{at a distance}} of 349,000km from Jupiter's center. This close approach allowed for greater image resolution, though the flyby's short duration meant that most observations of Jupiter's moons, rings, magnetic field, and radiation environment were made in the 48-hour period bracketing the approach, even though Voyager1 continued photographing the planet until April. It was soon followed by Voyager2, which made <b>its</b> <b>closest</b> approach on July 9, 1979, 576,000km away from the planet's cloud tops. The probe discovered Jupiter's ring, observed intricate vortices in its atmosphere, observed active volcanoes on Io, a process analogous to plate tectonics on Ganymede, and numerous craters on Callisto.|$|E

5|$|A subfamily, the Diplodocinae, {{was erected}} to include Diplodocus and <b>its</b> <b>closest</b> relatives, {{including}} Barosaurus. More distantly related is the contemporaneous Apatosaurus, {{which is still}} considered a diplodocid, although not a diplodocine, {{as it is a}} member of the subfamily Apatosaurinae. The Portuguese Dinheirosaurus and the African Tornieria have also been identified as close relatives of Diplodocus by some authors. The Diplodocoidea comprise the diplodocids, as well as dicraeosaurids, rebbachisaurids, Suuwassea, Amphicoelias and possibly Haplocanthosaurus, and/or the nemegtosaurids. This clade is the sister group to Macronaria (camarasaurids, brachiosaurids and titanosaurians).|$|E
5|$|Albertosaurus is {{a member}} of the {{theropod}} family Tyrannosauridae, in the subfamily Albertosaurinae. <b>Its</b> <b>closest</b> relative is the slightly older Gorgosaurus libratus (sometimes called Albertosaurus libratus; see below). These two species are the only described albertosaurines; other undescribed species may exist. Thomas Holtz found Appalachiosaurus to be an albertosaurine in 2004, but his more recent unpublished work locates it just outside Tyrannosauridae, in agreement with other authors.|$|E
