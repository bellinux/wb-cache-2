40|$|This paper {{reports a}} {{comparison}} of the effectiveness and practicality of using different multi-metal deposition processes for <b>finger</b> <b>mark</b> development. The work investigates whether modifications can be made to improve the performance of the existing process published by Schnetz. Secondly, we compare the ability of different multi-metal deposition processes to develop finger marks on a range of surfaces with that of other currently used development processes. All published multi-metal deposition processes utilise an initial stage of colloidal gold deposition followed by enhancement of the marks with using a physical developer. All possible combinations of colloidal gold and physical developer stages were tested. The method proposed by Schnetz was shown to be the most effective process, however a modification which reduced the pH of the enhancement solution was revealed to provide the best combination of effectiveness and practicality. In trials comparing the modified formulation with vacuum metal deposition, superglue and powder suspensions on surfaces which typically give low <b>finger</b> <b>mark</b> yields (cling film, plasticised vinyl, leather and masking tape), the modified method produced significantly better results over existing processes for cling film and plasticised vinyl. The modified formulation was found to be ineffective on both masking tape and leather. It is recommended that further tests be carried out on the modified multi-metal deposition formulation to establish whether it could be introduced for operational work on cling film material in particular.

40|$|Further {{developments}} in fingermark detection {{rely heavily on}} improving our knowledge of latent fingermark composition. Investigations into the factors responsible for compositional variation, such as traits including age, gender and lifestyle habits, {{as well as a}} better understanding of fingermark degradation processes, are vital to overcome the limitations of current development methods. In recent years, there has been much interest in employing mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) for these purposes due to its ability to simultaneously identify and map the substances present on surfaces [1]. A number of investigations have applied SIMS, MALDI and DESI MSI techniques to the examination of both endogenous and exogenous fingermark components. Results so far indicate the potential of MSI to be applied to in - depth studies into the factors that influence <b>finger</b> <b>mark</b> composition.

40|$|Fingerprints are a {{worldwide}} well known tool {{for law enforcement}} agencies to reach the individualization of people convicted of a crime. Moreover, all major countries have huge fingerprint databases and efficient automated systems (AFIS) to perform electronic screening of fingerprints marks recovered by crime scene investigation. Fingerprints are permanent and even if, from a scientific point of view, {{they could not be}} considered unique, friction ridge is highly selective and allows a discrimination between different individuals with a very high proficiency. Up to now, the most common techniques for enhancing latent fingerprints from articles collected in the crime scene are based on chemical-physical processes, or optical detection techniques, based on absorption, photoluminescence, diffused reflection or ultraviolet imaging, with appropriate band-pass and/or narrow-band filtering. Chemical-physical processes have shown really good performances, but they are destructive with respect to the latent <b>finger</b> <b>mark</b> deposit and in most cases these methods partially affect subsequent DNA analysis. On the other side, optical detection processes have the advantage of being non-destructive of the fingerprint. As a result, these techniques allow later performing of DNA analysis and/or the further application of conventional fingerprint development procedures. The majority of the optical techniques, {{with the possible exception of}} the ultraviolet inspection, allow further biological analysis. And as the aforementioned methods have the advantage of being non alterative with the respect of the fingerprint deposit, subsequent application of chemical and/or physical methods is not precluded. Moreover, some recent studies are investigating the X-ray fluorescence of fingerprints, and some others are attempting to discriminate the IR spectrum of the <b>finger</b> <b>mark</b> deposit from the IR spectrum of the surface. It is easy to understand how crucial is to develop a robust technique of optical analysis, able to reach a high-resolution imaging of finger marks, requiring no chemical conventional or non-conventional pre-process and producing no modification either on the finger perspiration deposit or on the background surface. The proper image of the fingerprint, obtained from the item surface, could allow us to perform a complete fingerprint analysis, which potentially leads us to the individualization of the perpetrator. Moreover, fingerprint imaging could exactly point out the particular region of the whole surface where we can surely find the DNA of the donor, with a higher probability of successful analysis...|$|E
