40|$|We {{investigated}} the temporal dynamics of <b>dust</b> <b>entrainment</b> in the Bodélé Depression, Central Sahara, {{to better understand}} the intra-annual variability of aerosol emission in the world's largest dust source. The linkages between <b>dust</b> <b>entrainment</b> and large-scale meteorological factors were examined by correlating several meteorological variables in the Mediterranean and Africa north of the equator with the aerosol concentrations in the Bodélé Depression separately for winter and summer. The methodological tools applied are NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data and the aerosol index of the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS-AI), available for 15 years from 1978 to 1993. We found that dust mobilisation during the Harmattan season is highly dependent on air pressure variability in the Mediterranean area. High pressure {{to the north of the}} Bodélé intensifies the NE trade winds, leading to an increased entrainment of dust in the Bodélé Depression. In summer, dust mobilization cannot be explained by the large scale meteorological conditions. This highlights the importance of local to regional wind systems linked to the northernmost position of the intertropical convection zone (ITCZ) during this time...|$|E
40|$|As {{longwall}} shields {{are lowered}} {{in preparation for}} advance, dust from the canopy falls directly into the air stream with the potential of becoming entrained. Historical dust sampling data from the early 1980 s shows that shield advance contributed an average of 12 percent to the airborne respirable dust levels found on longwalls in the United States. Data from the 1990 s indicates that shield dust liberation had increased {{to an average of}} 23 percent. Increased longwall production levels over this time resulted in the need to move a larger number of shields during each shift, while an increase in air velocities on the face was also occurring.

Here, {{we try to}} find the {{mechanism}} of <b>dust</b> <b>entrainment</b> by the gust wind by analyzing observation data and numerical simulation result. First, the ultra-sonic anemometer-thermometer data during the dust storm periods in 2000 - 2004 have been analyzed. It is revealed that the air motion during dust storm can be divided into three parts, the turbulent small eddies, the gust wind, and large scale basic flow. In the lower part of atmospheric boundary layer, the descending component of basic flow suppresses the dust particles keeping them within the bottom layers. But the gust wind has coherent structure, and due to the gust wind not turbulence, the dust can entrain from lower to upper levels. Second, we use Lagrangian Stochastic Model to simulate the particle trajectory during dust storm period. The wind condition comes from the observation wind profiles. It includes basic flow profile, gust wind profile and turbulent intensity. When there are only turbulent fluctuations, particles have random trajectories and can reach 250 m height. Once adding gust wind, particles are carried in the air stream and have the potential to be transported to great heights (higher than 500 m) and over great distances. But if no gust wind and adding descending component of basic flow, particles are only accumulated in the bottom of layer. The simulation result shows that the mechanism of <b>dust</b> <b>entrainment</b> during strong wind is mainly due to the gust wind...|$|E

40|$|Numerous parameterizations {{have been}} {{developed}} for predicting wind erosion, yet the physical mechanism of dust emission is not fully understood. Sandblasting is thought to be the primary mechanism, but recent studies suggest that dust emission by direct aerodynamic entrainment can be significant under certain conditions. In this work, using wind tunnel experiments, we investigated some of the lesser understood aspects of dust emission in sandblasting and aerodynamic entrainment for three soil types, namely clay, silty clay loam, and clay loam. First, we explored the role of erodible surface roughness on dust emitted by aerodynamic entrainment. Second, we compared the emitted dust concentration in sandblasting and aerodynamic entrainment under a range of wind friction velocities. Finally, we explored the sensitivity of emitted dust particle size distribution (PSD) to soil type and wind friction velocity in these two processes. The dust concentration in aerodynamic entrainment showed strong positive correlation, no significant correlation, and weak negative correlation, for the clay, silty clay loam, and clay loam, respectively, with the erodible soil surface roughness. The <b>dust</b> in aerodynamic <b>entrainment</b> was significant constituting up to 28. 3, 41. 4, and 146. 4 % compared to sandblasting for the clay, silty clay loam, and clay loam, respectively.

Earth Surface Processes and Landforms, 40 (14), pp. 1982 – 1988., which has been published in final form at [URL] This article may be used for non-commercial purposes in accordance with Wiley Terms and Conditions for Self-Archiving. The roles of pre-frontal, frontal and post-frontal winds as the primary wind systems for <b>dust</b> <b>entrainment</b> and transport in Australia are well established. While the relevance of each system has been observed across different wind erosion events in central Australia, the entrainment of dust by all three winds during the passage of an individual front has not been demonstrated until now. Synoptic information, satellite aerosol and imagery, meteorological and dust concentration data are presented for a single case study erosion event in the lower Lake Eyre Basin. This event demonstrates variable dust transport in three different directions from one of the southern Hemisphere's most significant source regions, and the changing nature of the active dust pathways during the passage of a frontal system. While only a single dust event is considered, the findings show the complexity of mineral aerosol emission and transport patterns even within an individual dust outbreak. For the lower Lake Eyre Basin, this appreciation of pathway behaviour is significant for better understanding the role of aeolian inputs from the dominant Australian source to surrounding marine systems. In a wider context, the findings exhibit the detailed insights into major dust source dynamics that can be obtained from high resolution spatial and particularly temporal data, as used in combination.

40|$|An intense {{dust storm}} {{occurred}} during 19 – 20 May 2007 over the Taklimakan Desert in northwestern China. In the following days, the space-borne lidar CALIOP tracked an optically thin, highly elevated, horizontally extensive dust veil that was transported intercontinentally over the eastern Asia, Pacific Ocean, North America, and Atlantic Ocean. A global aerosol transport model (SPRINTARS) also simulated the dust veil quite well {{and provided a}} 3 -D view of the dust intercontinental transport. The SPRINTARS simulation revealed that the dust veil travels at 4 – 10 km altitudes with a thickness of 1 – 4 km along the isentropic surface between 310 K and 340 K. The transport speed is about 1500 km/d. The estimated dust amounts exported to the Pacific is 30. 8 Gg, of which 65 % is deposited in the Pacific and 18 % is transported to the North Atlantic. These results imply that the dust veil can fertilize the open oceans, provide background dust to the atmosphere remote from the sources. The entrainment mechanism that injects dust particles into the free atmosphere is important for understanding {{the formation of the}} dust veil and the subsequent long-range transport. We used a regional dust transport model (RC 4) to analyze the <b>dust</b> emission and <b>entrainment</b> over the source region. The RC 4 analysis revealed that strong northeasterly surface winds associated with a low pressure invade into the Taklimakan Desert through the east side corridor and form a strong up-slope wind along the high and steep mountainside of the Tibetan Plateau, blowing up large amounts of dust into the air. The updraft further brings the lofted dust particles up to the free troposphere (about 9 km MSL) where the westerly generally blows.

It was referred to as the ‘Red Dawn’ event. Along its course across the state of New South Wales, the dust plume passed over Canberra, the capital of Australia located some 300 km from Sydney. In this study we identified the sources of the dust and tracked the progression of the dust storm using satellite imagery. We also examined the meteorological conditions that {{led to the formation of}} the dust plume. We also investigated the microbial and lipid composition, grain-size distribution, pollen content and geochemical composition of several samples of the dust that fell in Canberra (called ‘Canberra dust’), with particular attention paid to the ratio of some rare earth elements as well as strontium and neodymium isotopes. This was done to identify a geochemical and palynological ‘fingerprint’ of this dust to determine the source of the material. Collectively, the meteorological and fingerprinting analyses identified the principal location of <b>dust</b> <b>entrainment</b> as between the large playa Lakes Gairdner and Torrens in arid South Australia, some 1600 km away from Canberra. We also determined through Sr isotope analyses and other elements measured in the dust that fell in Canberra and the township of Eden, located south of Sydney, that the dust changed composition slightly over a few hours, being the consequence of local <b>dust</b> <b>entrainment</b> along the path of the dust plume across South Australia and New South Wales. In addition, we present a scenario which explains dust transport away from the direction of the major dust plume.

The aridity of the Australian continent and high climatic variability result in widespread dust raising in the arid and semi-arid areas and transport to the humid margins and surrounding oceans.

Dust raising is greatest in the Lake Eyre Basin, including the Simpson Desert, and Murray-Darling Basin where internal drainage renews supplies of fine particles to the arid zone.

In particular, it is controlled by the saturation length characterizing the distance it takes for the particle flux to reach a new equilibrium after a change in flow conditions. The saturation of mass density of particles entrained into transport and the relaxation of particle and fluid velocities constitute the main relevant relaxation mechanisms leading to saturation of the sediment flux. Here we present a theoretical model for sediment transport which, for the first time, accounts for both these relaxation mechanisms and for the different types of sediment entrainment prevailing under different environmental conditions.

We find that only micron sized dust grains and smaller can be entrained in EUV driven winds. The maximum grain size is set by dust settling in the disc rather than aerodynamic drag in the wind. More generally, there is a linear relationship between the base flow density and the maximum entrainable grain size in the wind. A pileup of micron sized dust grains can occur in the upper atmosphere at critical radii in the disc as grains decouple from the low-density wind. Entrainment is a strong function of location in the disc, resulting in a size sorting of grains in the outflow [...] -the largest grain being carried out between 10 [...] 20 AU. The peak dust density for each grain size occurs at the inner edge of its own entrainment region. Comment: 20 pages, 13 figures, Accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|E
40|$|Dust {{explosion}} hazards {{in areas}} where combustible dusts are found have caused loss of life and halted business operations in some instances. The elimination of secondary dust explosion hazards, i. e. reducing dust dispersion, can be characterized in shock-tubes to understand shock-dust interactions. For this reason, a new shock-tube test section was developed and integrated into an existing shock-tube facility. The test section has large windows {{to allow for the}} use of the shadowgraph technique to track dust-layer growth behind a passing normal shock wave, and it is designed to handle an incident shock wave up to Mach 2 to impersonate real-industry scenarios. The characterization experiments presented herein demonstrate the advantages of the authors? test techniques toward providing new physical insights over a wider range of data than what have been available heretofore in the literature. First, the effect of shock strength on the <b>dust</b> <b>entrainment</b> process was explored by subjecting limestone dust to Mach numbers ranging from 1. 10 to 1. 60. Also, the effect of dust-layer thickness on the entrainment process was observed by performing tests with two different layer depths, namely 3. 2 - and 12. 7 -mm thicknesses. New data were collected to develop correlations between the shock strength and the <b>dust</b> <b>entrainment</b> height as a function of time for each layer depth. The longer observation time and higher camera framing rates led to the discovery of trends not previously observed by earlier studies, such as a clear transition time between the early, linear growth regime and a much-slower, average growth regime. This second regime is however accompanied by surface instabilities that can lead to a much larger variation in the edge of the dust layer than seen in the early growth regime. In addition, for the linear growth regime, there was no significant difference in the dust-layer height growth between the two layer thicknesses; however, the larger thickness led to higher growth rates and much larger surface instabilities at later times. Next, we conducted experiments to elucidate the effect of particle size and size polydispersity on dust cloud formation phenomena behind blast waves. Through systematic modification of the span of the particle size distribution, the striking effect of polydispersity on the entrainment process was demonstrated. Moreover, correlations between linear dust rise rate and particle size and size polydispersity have been developed. Finally, recommendations for numerical modelers of this field and NFPA 654, Standard for the Prevention of Fire and Dust Explosions from the Manufacturing, Processing, and Handling of Combustible Particulate Solids are provided for developing a better dust explosion hazard assessment tool...|$|E
40|$|Recent field {{observations}} {{demonstrate that}} a significant discrepancy exists between models and measurements of large dust aerosol particles at remote sites. We assess the fraction of this bias explained by assumptions involving four different dust production processes. These include dust source size distribution (constant or dynamically changing according to saltation and sandblasting theory), wind speed distributions (using mean wind or a probability density function (PDF)), parent soil aggregate size distribution, and the discretization (number of bins) in the dust size distribution. The <b>Dust</b> <b>Entrainment</b> and Deposition global model is used to simulate the measurements from the Puerto Rican Dust Experiment (PRIDE) (2000). Using wind speed PDFs from observed National Centers for Environmental Prediction winds results in small changes in downwind size distribution for the production which neglects sandblasting, but it results in significant changes when production includes sandblasting. Saltation-sandblasting generally produces more large dust particles than schemes which neglect sandblasting. Parent soil aggregate size distribution {{is an important factor}} when calculating size-distributed dust emissions. Changing from a soil with large grains to a soil with smaller grains increases by 50 % the fraction of large aerosols (D > 5 μm) modeled at Puerto Rico. Assuming that the coarse medium sand typical of West Africa dominates all source regions produces the best agreement with PRIDE observations...|$|E

Results from the most recent round (1992 - 1996) of the Coal Worker's X-ray Surveillance Programs indicate that approximately 8 % of the examined miners who had at least 25 years of mining experience were diagnosed with Coal Worker Pneumoconiosis (CWP) (category 1 / 0 +). During the period between 1995 - 1999, mine operators and MSHA inspectors collected 9968 and 1365 dust samples respectively, from longwall designated occupation (DO) personnel. Analysis of these samples showed that 1970 (20 %) of the mine operator samples and 25. 8 (19 %) of the MSHA samples 5 exceeded the 2 mg/m 3 dust standard. The continued development of CWP in coal mine workers and the magnitude of respirable dust over-exposures in longwall mining occupations illustrate the need for improved dust control technology on longwalls. Figure 1 illustrates the major longwall dust sources as determined in the early 1990 's. 4 This article describes the ongoing research to find ways to minimise shearer dust levels as a function of changes in dust control parameters, and research to determine the impact of high air velocities on shield <b>dust</b> <b>entrainment...</b>|$|E
40|$|Substantial {{impacts of}} dust aerosol on climate and {{environment}} have increased, that {{why there is}} a need to better understand and eventually predict the atmospheric dust cycle. Along these lines, several dust models have been developed [Tegen and Fung, 1994; Nickovic and Dobricic, 1996; Nickovic et al., 2001] and used for studying dust processes. The major phases of the atmospheric dust cycle consists on: emission, transport, wet and dry deposition. In this work, the atmospheric dust cycle has been integrated in ALADIN model. The emission processes are treated in SURFEX (SURFace EXternalisée) by the DEAD module (<b>Dust</b> <b>Entrainment</b> And Deposition) [Grini and al., 2006]. The first step consists of an improvement of the dust emission scheme (version SURFEX) by introducing the soil aggregate distribution and size-depending energy thresholds for particle release during sandblasting [Alfaro and Gomes, 2001]. The second step deals with the treatment of the transport and the removal processes of dust aerosols in ALADIN. The coupled ALADIN_SURFEX system is used to simulate the March 7 - 13 West Africa dust storm. To validate the results, we used the daily mean AOD (Aerosol Optical Depth) from AQUA-MODIS satellite data and the local AOD and concentration measurements available in the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analyses (AMMA) data base. 1...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} based on dust aerosol cycle {{modelling}} in the atmospheric model ALADIN (Aire Limitée Adaptation dynamique Développement InterNational) coupled with the EXternalised SURFace scheme SURFEX. Its main {{goal is to create}} an appropriate mineral dust emission parameterization compatible with the global database of land surface parameters ECOCLIMAP, and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) soil type database in SURFEX. An improvement on the <b>Dust</b> <b>Entrainment</b> And Deposition scheme (DEAD) is proposed in this paper by introducing the geographical variation of surface soil size distribution, the Marticorena and Bergametti (1995) formulation of horizontal saltation flux and the Shao et al. (1996) formulation of sandblasting efficiency α. To show the importance of the modifications introduced in the DEAD, both sensitivity and comparative studies are conducted in 0 dimensions (0 -D) and then in 3 dimensions (3 -D) between the old DEAD and the new DEAD. The results of the 0 -D simulations indicate that the revised DEAD scheme represents the dust source emission better, particularly in the Bodélé depression, and provides a reasonable friction threshold velocity. In 3 -D simulations, small differences are found between the DEAD and the revised DEAD for the simulated Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) compared with the AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) photometer measurements available in the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analyses (AMMA) databases. For the surface concentration, a remarkable improvement is noted for the revised DEAD scheme...|$|E
