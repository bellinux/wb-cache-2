The transport had difficulty in <b>getting</b> <b>down</b> the winding road from Centuripe because of a large crater which took the sappers twelve hours to fill in and also because the Germans in their retreat scattered mortar bombs and shells in the area.|$|E
25|$|Younis is {{regarded}} as one of the best players of spin bowling in the world, being particularly strong on the leg side. His favourite and trademark shot is the flick, but it has also been his shortcoming, with him being particularly prone to falling lbw during the early stages of his innings. He is also prone to <b>getting</b> <b>down</b> on one knee and driving extravagantly. But this flamboyance is coupled with grit. One of his main weaknesses is playing away from the body, he also has a tendency to leave straight balls, a trait that has been exploited by bowlers in the past, particularly by the Australian attack. Along with Mohammad Yousuf and the now retired Inzamam-ul-Haq, he formed a formidable middle order batting line up for Pakistan.|$|E

Pitino characterized the incident as [...] "a case of someone <b>getting</b> <b>down</b> and needing a couple of hugs to get their spirits lifted a little bit". Pitino later added that he thought the transfer of point guard Travis Ford from Missouri [...] bringing additional competition in the backcourt for the 199192 season [...] may have played into Farmer's brief departure.|$|E

500|$|An {{excerpt from}} [...] premiered as the song's music video in August 2009 on Disney Channel {{to promote the}} home release of the film. The video begins with Cyrus and her backup dancers atop a stage in a crowded outdoor concert. Cyrus is dressed as Hannah Montana and is wearing a {{business}} suit. As Cyrus begins singing, she and the dancers engage in intricate choreography. The video then transitions to a clip from Hannah Montana: The Movie in which Cyrus' character is <b>getting</b> <b>down</b> from a private airplane. The video continues to alternate between Cyrus performing and more film clips; scenes include Stewart taking off her Hannah Montana wig and interacting with Travis Body, her love interest in the film, portrayed by actor Lucas Till. Midway through the video, Cyrus and her dancers exit the stage through a back door and instantly enter sporting western clothing with Cyrus in a western teal button up shirt, a checkered red and white table cloth with purple ruffles pettiskirt or a petticoat, and cowboy boots.|$|E
500|$|Cliff White of NME {{called the}} album [...] "almost a voyeur's delight", {{and was not}} {{favorable}} of Gaye's sensual themes, stating [...] "Although <b>getting</b> <b>down,</b> getting mellow, and getting it on are paramount considerations {{in the privacy of}} my own home, I don't particularly want to be party to someone else's night life. Not on record anyway... Like peeking through the windows of the Gaye residence in the wee wee hours. Perhaps that's your kick, but personally I find it a mite frustrating." [...] White also criticized the album's sound, describing the songs as [...] "all expressions of the same mood. Sensual, satisfied, and spaced out", and calling I Want You [...] "simply the explorative aftermath of Let's Get It On. The sweet nuthin's of a drowsy, sweat-streaked lover." [...] Robert Christgau of The Village Voice wrote favorably of the album's sound quality. However, he criticized the lyrical content, as well as Ware's involvement in songwriting, stating [...] "was it Ware who instructed Marvin to eliminate all depth and power from his voice? I mean, if you're into insisting on sex it's in bad taste to whine about it." ...|$|E

HitFix's Melinda Newman {{described}} the song as a [...] "loop-driven to <b>getting</b> <b>down</b> with your lady, who’s taking off her clothes as quickly as she can". According to Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine, in [...] "Cabaret", Timberlake compares the love to a burlesque and noted that the song resembles producer Timbaland's earlier work. Andy Kellman of Allmusic wrote that the song features Timbaland's signature sound and finds Timberlake proclaiming more [...] "clever/nauseating" [...] lyrics: [...] "If sex is a contest, then you're coming first"; [...] "'Cause I got you saying Jesus so much, it's like we're laying in a manger." [...] The chorus is consisted of Timberlake singing [...] "It's a cabaret" [...] while being accompanied by Timbaland, who repeats [...] "Put on a show, get on the floor". According to Stern, in his part with a duration about two minutes, Drake raps raunchy and fast-talking lines, [...] "I’mma fuck you like we’re having an affair". Nick Krewen of Toronto Star wrote that Drake raps lines [...] "about a sexual tête-à-tête amidst a melee of scattershot rhythms".|$|E

500|$|As the German {{ground forces}} {{advanced}} across the Ukraine in August and September, the air units of JG52 kept pace – constantly {{moving on to}} forward airbases. The Gruppe was involved in providing cover for the southern crossings over the Dneiper, the capture of Poltava, the First Battle of Kharkov and then crossing the Perekop isthmus into the Crimea. They often flew three or four missions a day when weather permitted. [...] By the end of October Graf was mastering his flying technique, becoming adept at low-level flying, and had achieved 20 victories. The rains arrived in November, turning the airfields to mud and limiting air operations {{and the number of}} serviceable aircraft. Graf’s unit was moved forward to Taganrog to support the battle for Rostov. Once the snow arrived, freezing the ground, operations picked up again. In heavy combat over and around the see-saw battle, Graf had doubled his score to 42 by the end of 1941, making him one of the Gruppe’s leading pilots. On New Year’s Day 1942, III./JG52 was transferred to the relative comfort of the large Kharkov-Rogan airfield, with its closed hangars. The blizzard conditions (often <b>getting</b> <b>down</b> to −20°C overnight) made flying virtually impossible. On 24 January, Graf was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross for his victories to date. Soon after, he was sent on rotation back home on leave. Within a month, his regular wingman, Steinbatz, was also awarded the Knight’s Cross for a similar score.|$|E

As the music begins, she puts on a pair Swarovski crystal earrings before the camera switches to inside the club. where it descends from the ceiling amongst the Las Vegas-style crystal chandeliers. Choreographer Frank Gatson Jr. called the club, [...] "the best dance party in town," [...] where Lopez played several different characters. Both the scenery and artist were styled to pay homage to her background as a professional dancer, she said she wanted the video to [...] "introduce people to a new J.Lo-ration of party people". In one scene, she plays a dominant queen of the party who watches from above, on a balcony surrounded by servants. When portraying this character, Lopez was styled with [...] "a big beehive bun, gold gladiator heels and a glittery gold gown with Gaga-esque detailing in its high collar and leaves." [...] The 'queen' character [...] "dangles lazily on a couch" [...] and [...] "regally oversees a crowd of people <b>getting</b> <b>down</b> on the dancefloor."
